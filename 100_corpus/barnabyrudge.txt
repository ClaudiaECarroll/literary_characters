PREFACE.
As it is Mr. Waterton's opinion that ravens are gradu-
ally becoming extinct in England, I offer a few words
here about mine.
The raven in this story is a compound of two great
originals, of whom I have been, at different times, the
proud possessor. The first was in the bloom of his youth
when he was discovered in a modest retirement in Lon-
don by a friend of mine and given to me. He had from
the first, as Sir Hugh Evans says of Anne Page, “good
gifts,” which he improved by study and attention in a
most exemplary manner. He slept in a stable-gener-
ally on horseback—and so terrified a Newfoundland dog
by his preternatural sagacity, that he has been known,
by the mere superiority of his genius, to walk off unmo-
lested with the dog's dinner, from before his face. He
was rapidly rising in acquirements and virtues when, in
an evil hour, his stable was newly painted. He ob-
served the workmen closely, saw that they were careful
of the paint, and immediately burned to possess it. On
their going to dinner, he ate up all they had left behind,
consisting of a pound or two of white lead; and this
youthful indiscretion terminated in death.
While I was yet inconsolable for his loss, another
friend of mine in Yorkshire discovered an older and
more gifted raven at a village public-house, which he
prevailed upon the landlord to part with for a considera-
tion, and sent up to me. The first act of this Sage was
to administer to the effects of his predecessor, by disin-
terring all the cheese and halfpence he had buried in the
garden a work of immense labour and research, to
which he devoted all the energies of his mind. When
he had achieved this task he applied himself to the ac-
quisition of stable language, in which he soon became such
an adept that he would perch outside my window and
drive imaginary horses with great skill all day. Per-

haps even I never saw him at his best, for his former
master sent his duty with him, “and if I wished the bird
to come out very strong, would I be so good as show
him a drunken man”—which I never did, having (un-
fortunately) none but sober people at hand. But I could
hardly have respected him more, whatever the stimu-
lating influences of this sight might have been. He had
not the least respect, I am sorry to say, for me in return,
or for any body but the cook; to whom he was attached-
but only, I fear, as a Policeman might have been. Once I
met him unexpectedly, about half a mile off, walking
down the middle of the public street, attended by a
pretty large crowd, and spontaneously exhibiting the
whole of his accomplishments. His gravity under those
trying circumstances I never can forget, nor the extra-
ordinary gallantry with which, refusing to be brought
home, he defended himself behind a pump, until over-
powered by numbers. It may have been that he was
too bright a genius to live long, or it may have been that
he took some pernicious substance into his bill, and
thence into his maw—which is not improbable, seeing
that he new-pointed the greater part of the garden-wall
by digging out the mortar, broke countless squares of
glass by scraping away the putty all round the frames,
and tore up and swallowed, in splinters, the greater
part of a wooden staircase of six steps and a landing-
but after some three years he too was taken ill, and died
before the kitchen fire. He kept his eye to the last upon
the meat as it roasted, and suddenly turned over on his
back with a sepulchral cry of “Cuckoo!”
After this mournful deprivation, I was, for a long
time, ravenless. The kindness of another friend at
length provided me with another raven; but he is not a
genius. He leads the life of a hermit, in my little
orchard, on the summit of Shakespeare's Gad's Hill;
he has no relish for society; he gives no evidence of ever
cultivating his mind; and he has picked up nothing but
meat since I have known him-except the faculty of
barking like a dog.
Of the story of BARNABY RUDGE itself, I do not think
I can say anything here, more to the purpose than the
following passages from the original Preface:
“No account of the Gordon Riots having been to my

knowledge introduced into any Work of Fiction, and
the subject presenting very extraordinary and remark-
able features, I was led to project this Tale.
“It is unnecessary to say, that those shameful tumults,
while they reflect indelible disgrace upon the time in
which they occurred, and all who had act or part in
them, teach a good lesson. That what we falsely call a
religious cry is easily raised by men who have no re-
ligion, and who in their daily practice set at nought the
commonest principles of right and wrong; that it is be-
gotten of intolerance and persecution; that it is sense-
less, besotted, inveterate, and unmerciful; all History
teaches us. But perhaps we do not know it in our hearts
too well, to profit by even so humble an example as the
“No Popery' riots of Seventeen Hundred and Eighty.
“Howeverimperfectly those disturbances are set forth
in the following pages, they are impartially painted by
one who has no sympathy with the Romish Church, al-
though he acknowledges, as most men do, some esteemed
friends among the followers of its creed.
“It may be observed that, in the description of the
principal outrages, reference has been had to the best
authorities of that time, such as they are; and that the
account given in this Tale, of all the main features of
the Riots, is substantially correct.
“It may be further remarked, that Mr. Dennis's allu-
sions to the flourishing condition of his trade in those
days, have their foundation in Truth, and not in the
Author's fancy. Any file of old Newspapers, or odd
volume of the Annual Register, will prove this, with
terrible ease.
“Even the case of Mary Jones, dwelt upon with so
much pleasure by the same character, is no effort of in-
vention. The facts were stated, exactly as they are
stated here, in the House of Commons. Whether they
afforded as much entertainment to the merry gentlemen
assembled there, as some other most affecting circum-
stances of a similar nature mentioned by Sir Samuel
Romilly, is not recorded.”
That the case of Mary Jones may speak the more em-
phatically for itself, I now subjoin it, as related by Sir
William Meredith in a speech in Parliament, “on Fre-
quent Executions,” made in 1777.

BARNABY RUDGE.
inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal; .
but, whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry ap.
pealed to the mounting block itself as evidence, and
triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same
place to that very day, the doubters never failed to be
put down by a large majority, and all true believers
exulted as in a victory.
Whether these, and many other stories of the like na-
ture, were true or untrue, the Maypole was really an
old house, a very old house, perhaps as old as it claimed
to be, and perhaps older, which will sometimes happen
with houses of an uncertain, as with ladies of a certain,
age. Its windows were old diamond-paned lattices, its
floors were sunken and uneven, its ceilings blackened
by the hand of time and heavy with massive beams.
Over the doorway was an ancient porch, quaintly and
grotesquely carved; and here on summer evenings the
more favoured customers smoked and drank-ay, and
sang many a good song, too, sometimes-reposing on
two grim-looking, high-backed settles, which, like the
twin dragons of some fairy tale, guarded the entrance
to the mansion.
In the chimneys of the disused rooms, swallows had
built their nests for many a long year, and from earliest
spring to latest autumn whole colonies of sparrows
chirped and twittered in the eaves. There were more
pigeons about the dreary stable-yard and out-buildings
than anybody but the landlord could reckon up. The
wheeling and circling fiights of runts, fantails, tumbiers,
and pouters, were perhaps not quite consistent with the
grave and sober character of the building, but the mo-
notonous cooing, which never ceased to be raised by some
among them all day long, suited it exactly, and seemed
.to lull it to rest. With its overhanging stories, drowsy
little panes of glass, and front bulging out and project-
ing over the pathway, the old house looked as if it were
nodding in its sleep. Indeed, it needed no very great
stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblances to
humanity. The bricks of which it was built had origin-
ally been a deep dark red, but had grown yellow and
discoloured like an old man's skin; the sturdy timbers
had decayed like teeth; and here and there the ivy, like
a warm garment to comfort it in its age, wrapt its green
leaves closely round the time-worn walls.

BARNABY RUDGE.
It was a hale and hearty age though, still: and in the
summer or autumn evenings, when the glow of the set-
ting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adja-
cent forest, the old house, partaking of its lustre, seemed
their fit companion, and to have many good years of
life in him yet.
The evening with which we have to do was neither a
summer nor an autumn one, but the twilight of a day
in March, when the wind howled dismally among the
bare branches of the trees, and rumbling in the wide
chimneys, and driving the rain against the windows of
the Maypole Inn, gave such of its frequenters as chanced
to be there at the moment an undeniable reason for pro-
longing their stay, and caused the landlord to prophesy
that the night would certainly clear at eleven o'clock
precisely—which, by a remarkable coincidence, was the
hour at which he always closed his house.
The name of him upon whom the spirit of prophecy
thus descended was John Willet, a burly, large-headed
man, with a fat face, which betokened profound obsti-
nacy and slowness of apprehension, combined with a
very strong reliance upon his own merits. It was John
Willet's ordinary boast, in his more placid moods, that
if he were slow he was sure; which assertion could, in
one sense at least, be by no means gainsaid, seeing that
he was in everything unquestionably the reverse of fast,
and withal one of the most dogged and positive fellows
in existence-always sure that what he thought or said
or did was right, and holding it as a thing quite settled
and ordained by the laws of nature and Providence that
anybody who said or did or thought otherwise must be
inevitably and of necessity wrong.
Mr. Willet walked slowly up to the window, flattened
his fat nose against the cold glass, and shading his eyes
that his sight might not be affected by the ruddy glow
of the fire, looked abroad. Then he walked slowly back
to his old seat in the chimney-corner, and, composing
himself in it with a slight shiver, such as a man
might give way to and so acquire an additional relish
for the warm blaze, said, looking round upon his
guests:
“It'll clear at eleven o'clock. No sooner and no later.
Not before and not arterwards.”
“How do you make out that?” said a little man in

BARNABY RUDGE.
the opposite corner. “The moon is past the full, and
she rises at nine.”
John looked sedately and solemnly at his questioner
until he had brought his mind to bear upon the whole
of his observations, and then made answer, in a tone
which seemed to imply that the moon was peculiarly
his business and nobody else's.
“Never you mind about the moon. Don't you trouble
yourself about her. You let the moon alone, and I'll
let you alone.”
"No offence I hope ?” said the little man.
Again John waited leisurely until the observations
had thoroughly penetrated to his brain, and then reply-
ing, “No offence as yet,” applied a light to his pipe and
smoked in placid silence; now and then casting a side-
long look at a man wrapped in a loose riding-coat with
huge cuffs ornamented with tarnished silver lace and
large metal buttons, who sat apart from the regular fre-
quenters of the house, and wearing a hat flapped over
his face, which was still further shaded by the hand on
which his forehead rested, looked unsociable enough.
There was another guest, who sat, booted and spurred,
at some distance from the fire also, and whose thoughts
-to judge from his folded arms and knitted brows, and
from the untasted liquor before him-were occupied
with other matters than the topics under discussion or
the persons who discussed them. This was a young man
of about eight-and-twenty, rather above the middle
height, and though of a somewhat slight figure, grace-
fully and strongly made. He wore his own dark hair,
and was accoutred in a riding-dress, which, together
with his large boots (resembling in shape and fashion
those worn by our Life Guardsmen at the present day),
showed indisputable traces of the bad condition of the
roads. But travel-stained though he was, he was well
and even richly attired, and without being over-dressed
looked a gallant gentleman.
Lying upon the table beside him, as he had carelessly
thrown them down, were a heavy riding-whip and a
slouched hat, the latter worn no doubt as being best suited
to the inclemency of the weather. There, too, were a pair
of pistols in a holster-case, and a short riding-cloak.
Little of his face was visible, except the long dark lashes
which concealed his downcast eyos, but an air of care-

less ease and natural gracefulness of demeanour per-
vaded the figure and seemed to comprehend even these
slight accessories, which were all handsome, and in
good keeping.
Towards this young gentleman the eyes of Mr. Willet
wandered but once, and then as if in mute inquiry
whether he had observed his silent neighbour. It was
plain that John and the young gentleman had often met
before. Finding that his look was not returned, or in-
deed observed by the person to whom it was addressed,
John gradually concentrated the whole power of his eyes
into one focus, and brought it to bear upon the man in
the flapped hat, at whom he came to stare in course of
time with an intensity so remarkable that it affected his .
fireside cronies, who all, as with one accord, took their
pipes from their lips and stared with open mouths at the
stranger likewise.
The sturdy landlord had a large pair of dull fish-like
eyes, and the little man who hazarded the remark about
the moon (and who was the parish-clerk and bell-ringer
of Chigwell; a village hard" by) had little round black
shiny eyes like beads; moreover this little man wore at
the knees of his rusty black breeches, and on his rusty
black coat, and all down his long flapped waistcoat, little
queer buttons like nothing except his eyes; but so like
them that as they twinkled and glistened in the light of
the fire, which shone too in his bright shoe-buckles, he
seemed all eyes from head to foot, and to be gazing with
every one of them at the unknown customer. No won-
der that a man should grow restless under such an in-
spection as this, to say nothing of the eyes belonging to
short Tom Cobb, the general chandler and post-office
keeper, and long Phil Parkes, the ranger, both of whom,
infected by the example of their companions, regarded
him of the flapped hat no less attentively.
The stranger became restless; perhaps from being ex-
posed to this raking fire of eyes, perhaps from the nature
of his previous meditations—most probably from the
latter cause, for as he changed his position and looked
hastily round, he started to find himself the object of
such keen regard, and darted an angry and suspicious
glance at the fireside group. It had the effect of im-
mediately diverting all eyes to the chimney, except
those of John Willet, who finding himself, as it were,

caught in the fact, and not being (as has been already
observed) of a very ready nature, remained staring at
his guest in a particularly awkward and disconcerted
manner.
66 Well!” said the stranger.
Well. There was not much in well. It was not a
long speech. “I thought you gave an order," said the
landlord, after a pause of two or three minutes for con-
sideration.
The stranger took off his hat and disclosed the hard
features of a man of sixty or thereabouts, much weather-
beaten and worn by time, and the naturally harsh ex-
pression of which was not improved by a dark handker-
chief which was bound tightly round his head, and,
while it served the purpose of a wig, shaded his fore-
head, and almost hid his eyebrows. If it were intended
to conceal or divert attention from a deep gash, now
healed into an ugly seam, which when it was first in-
flicted must have laid bare his cheek-bone, the object
was but indifferently attained, for it could scarcely fail
to be noted at a glance. His complexion was of a cadav-
erous hue, and he had a grizzly jagged beard of some
three weeks' date. Such was the figure (very meanly
and poorly clad) that now rose from the seat, and stalk-
ing across the room sat down in a corner of the chimney,
which the politeness or fears of the little clerk very
readily assigned to him.
“A highwayman!” whispered Tom Cobb to Parkes the
ranger.
“Do you suppose highwaymen don't dress handsomer
than that?” replied Parkes. “It's a better business than
you think for, Tom, and highwaymen don't need or use
to be shabby, take my word for it.”
Meanwhile, the subject of their speculations had done
due honour to the house by calling for some drink,
which was promptly supplied by the landlord's son Joe,
a broad-shouldered, strapping young fellow of twenty,
whom it pleased his father still to consider a little boy,
and to treat accordingly. Stretching out his hands to
warm them by the blazing fire, the man turned his head
towards the company, and after running his eye sharply
over them, said in a voice well suited to his appearance:
“ What house is that which stands a mile or so from
here?”


## p. 7 (#21) ###############################################


BARNABY RUDGE.
“Public-house?” said the landlord, with his usual de-
liberation.
“Public-house, father!” exclaimed Joe, “where's the
public-house within a mile or so of the Maypole? He
means the great house--the Warren-naturally and of
course. The old red-brick house, sir, that stands in its
own grounds?”
“Ay,” said the stranger.
“And that fifteen or twenty years ago stood in a
park five times as broad, which with other and richer
property has bit by bit changed hands and dwindled
away--more's the pity!” pursued the young man.
“Maybe,” was the reply. “But my question related
to the owner. What it has been I don't care to know,
and what it is I can see for myself.”
The heir-apparent to the Maypole pressed his finger
on his lips, and glancing at the young gentleman already
noticed, who had changed his attitude when the house
was first mentioned, replied in a lower tone:
6 The owner's name is Haredale, Mr. Geoffrey Hare-
dale, and”—again he glanced in the same direction as
before--and a worthy gentleman too-hem!”
Paying as little regard to this admonitory cough, as to
the significant gesture that had preceded it, the stranger
pursued his questioning.
“I turned out of my way coming here, and took the
footpath that crosses the grounds. Who'was the young
lady that I saw entering the carriage? His daughter?”
"Why, how should I know, honest man?” replied
Joe, contriving, in the course of some arrangements
about the hearth, to advance close to his questioner and
pluck him by the sleeve, “I didn't see the young lady,
you know. Whew! There's the wind again and rain
-well it is a night!”
“Rough weather indeed!” observed the strange man.
“You're used to it?” said Joe, catching at anything
which seemed to promise a diversion of the subject.
“Pretty well,” returned the other. “About the young
lady-has Mr. Haredale a daughter?”
"No, no,” said the young fellow, fretfully, “he's a
single gentleman-he's--be quiet, can't you, man? Don't
you see this talk is not relished yonder?”
Regardless of this whispered remonstrance and affect-
ing not to hear it, his tormentor provokingly continued:


## p. 8 (#22) ###############################################

BARNABY RUDGE.
“Single men have had daughters before now. Per-
haps she may be his daughter, though he is not
married.”
“What do you mean,” said Joe, adding in an under
tone as he approached him again, “ You'll come in for
it presently, I know you will!”
“I mean no harm," returned the traveller, boldly,
" and have said none that I know of. I ask a few ques-
tions—as any stranger may, and not unnaturally--about
the inmates of a remarkable house in a neighbourhood
which is new to me, and you are as aghast and dis-
turbed as if I were talking treason against King George.
Perhaps you can tell me why, sir, for (as I say) I am a
stranger, and this is Greek to me?”
The latter observation was addressed to the obvious
cause of Joe Willet's discomposure, who had risen and
was adjusting his riding-cloak preparatory to sallying
abroad. Briefly replying that he could give him no in-
formation, the young man beckoned to Joe, and hand-
ing him a piece of money in payment of his reckoning,
hurried out attended by young Willet himself, who,
taking up a candle, followed to light him to the house
door.
While Joe was absent on this errand, the elder Willet
and his three companions continued to smoke with pro-
found gravity, and in a deep silence, each having his
eyes fixed on a huge copper boiler that was suspended
over the fire. After some time John Willet slowly shook
his head, and thereupon his friends slowly shook theirs;
but no man withdrew his eyes from the boiler, or altered
the solemn expression of his countenance in the slightest
degree.
At length Joe returned—very talkative and concilia-
tory, as though with a strong presentiment that he was
going to be found fault with.
“Such a thing as love is!” he said, drawing a chair
near the fire, and looking round for sympathy. “He has
set off to walk to London-all the way to London. His
nag gone lame in riding out here this blessed afternoon,
and comfortably littered down in our stable at this min-
ute; and he giving up a good hot. supper and our best
bed, because Miss Haredale has gone to a masquerade up
in town, and he has set his heart upon seeing her! I don't
think I could persuade myself to do that, beautiful as she

is—but then I'm not in love (at least I don't think I am),
and that's the whole difference.”
“ He is in love, then?" said the stranger.
“Rather,” replied Joe. “He'll never be more in love,
and may very easily be less.”
“Silence, sir!” cried his father.
“What a chap you are, Joe!” said Long Parkes.
“Such a inconsiderate lad!" murmured Tom Cobb.
“Putting himself forward and wringing the very nose
off his own father's face!” exclaimed the parish-clerk,
metaphorically.
“What have I done?” reasoned poor Joe.
“ Silence, sir!" returned his father, what do you
mean by talking, when you see people that are more
than two or three times your age, sitting still and silent
and not dreaming of saying a word?”
“ Why, that's the proper time for me to talk, isn't it?”
said Joe, rebelliously.
“ The proper time, sir!" retorted his father, “the
proper time's no time.”
“Ah, to be sure!” muttered Parkes, nodding gravely
to the other two, who nodded likewise, observing under
their breaths that that was the point.
“ The proper time's no time, sir,” repeated John Wil-
let; “ when I was your age I never talked, I never
wanted to talk. I listened and improved myself, that's
what I did.”
“And you'd find your father rather a tough customer
in argeyment, Joe, if anybody was to try and tackle
him,” said Parkes.
“For the matter o' that, Phil!” observed Mr. Willet,
blowing a long, thin, spiral cloud of smoke out of the
corner of his mouth, and staring at it abstractedly as
it floated away; “for the matter o’ that, Phil, argey-
ment is a gift of Natur. If Natur has gifted a man with
powers of argeyment, a man has a right to make the
best of 'em, and has not a right to stand on false deli-
cacy, and deny that he is so gifted; for that is a turning
of his back on Natur, a flouting of her, a slighting
of her precious caskets, and a proving of one's self
to be a swine that isn't worth her scattering pearls
before.”
The landlord pausing here for a very long time, Mr.
Parkes naturally concluded that he had brought his dis-

sir.”
course to an end; and therefore, turning to the young
man with some austerity, exclaimed:
“You hear what your father says, Joe? You wouldn't
much like to tackle him in argeyment, I'm thinkin',
"_IF,” said John Willet, turning his eyes from the
ceiling to the face of his interrupter, and uttering the
monosyllable in capitals, to apprise him that he had put
in his oar, as the vulgar say, with unbecoming and ir-
reverent haste; “IF,” sir, Natur has fixed upon me the
gift of argeyment, why should I not own to it, and
rather glory in the same? Yes, sir, I am a tough cus-
tomer that way. You are right, sir. My toughness has
been proved, sir, in this room many and many a time,
as I think you know; and if you don't know," added
John, putting his pipe in his mouth again, “so much
the better, for I an't proud and am not going to tell you."
A general murmur from his three cronies, and a gen-
eral shaking of heads at the copper boiler, assured John
Willet that they had had good experience of his powers,
and needed no further evidence to assure them of his
superiority. John smoked with a little more dignity,
and surveyed them in silence.
“It's all very fine talking,” muttered Joe, who had
been fidgeting in his chair with divers uneasy gestures.
“But if you mean to tell me that I'm never to open my
lips—”
“Silence, sir!” roared his father. “No, -you never
are. When your opinion's wanted, you give it. When
you're spoke to, you speak. When your opinion's
not wanted, and you're not spoke to, don't you give an
opinion and don't you speak. The world's undergone a
nice alteration since my time, certainly. My belief is
that there an't any boys left--that there isn't such a
thing as a boy—that there's nothing now between a male
baby and a man—and that all the boys went out with
his blessed Majesty King George the Second.”
“That's a very true observation, always excepting the
young princes,” said the parish-clerk, who, as the repre-
sentative of church and state in that company, held
himself bound to the nicest loyalty. “If it's godly and
righteous for boys, being of the ages of boys, to behave
themselves like boys, then the young princes must be
boys and cannot be otherwise.”

“Did you ever hear tell of mermaids, sir?” said Mr.
Willet.
“ Certainly I have,” replied the clerk.
“Very good," said Mr. Willet. “According to the
constitution of mermaids, so much of a mermaid as is
not a woman must be a fish. According to the consti-
tution of young princes, so much of a young prince (if
anything) as is not actually an angel, must be godly and
righteous. Therefore, if it's becoming and godly and
righteous in the young princes (as it is at their ages)
that they should be boys, they are and must be boys, and
cannot by possibility be anything else.”
This elucidation of a knotty point being received with
such marks of approval as to put John Willet into a
good humour, he contented himself with repeating to
his son his command of silence, and addressing the
stranger, said:
“If you had asked your questions of a grown-up per-
son-of me or any of these gentlemen-you'd have had
some satisfaction, and wouldn't have wasted breath.
Miss Haredale is Mr. Geoffrey Haredale's niece.”
“Is her father alive?” said the man, carelessly.
“No,” rejoined the landlord, “he is not alive, and he
is not dead”
“Not dead!” cried the other.
“ Not dead in a common sort of way,” said the landlord.
The cronies nodded to each other, and Mr. Parkes re-
marked in an under tone, shaking his head meanwhile
as who should say, “Let no man contradict me, for I
won't believe him,” that John Willet was in amazing
force to-night, and fit to tackle a Chief Justice.
The stranger suffered a short pause to elapse, and then
asked abruptly, “What do you mean?”
“More than you think for, friend,” returned John
Willet. “Perhaps there's more meaning in them words
than you suspect.”.
“Perhaps there is,” said the strange man, gruffly;
“but what the devil do you speak in such mysteries for?
You tell me first that a man is not alive, nor yet dead-
then, that he's not dead in a common sort of way—then
that you mean a great deal more than I think for. To
tell you the truth, you may do that easily; for so far as
I can make out, you mean nothing. What do you mean,
I ask again?"-

“That,” returned the landlord, a little brought down
from his dignity by the stranger's surliness, “is a May-
pole story, and has been any time these four-and-twenty
years. That story is Solomon Daisy's story. It belongs
to the house; and nobody but Solomon Daisy has ever
told it under this roof, or ever shall--that's more.”
The man glanced at the parish-clerk, whose air of con-
sciousness and importance plainly betokened him to be
the person referred to, and, observing that he had taken
his pipe from his lips, after a very long whiff to keep it
alight, and was evidently about to tell his story without
further solicitation, gathered his large coat about him,
and shrinking further back was almost lost in the gloom
of the spacious chimney corner, except when the flame,
struggling from under a great faggot whose weight
almost crushed it for the time, shot upward with a strong
and sudden glare, and illuminating his figure for a mo-
ment, seemed afterwards to cast it into deeper obscurity
than before.
By this flickering light, which made the old room with
its heavy timbers and pannelled walls look as if it were
built of polished ebony—the wind roaring and howling
without, now rattling the latch and creaking the hinges
of the stout oaken door, and now driving at the case-
ment as though it would beat it in-by this light, and
under circumstances so auspicious, Solomon Daisy be-
gan his tale:
“It was Mr. Reuben Haredale, Mr. Geoffrey's elder
brother”
Here he came to a dead stop, and made so long a pause
that even John Willet grew impatient and asked why he
did not proceed.
“Cobb,” said Solomon Daisy, dropping his voice and
appealing to the post-office keeper; “what day of the
month is this?"
“The nineteenth.”'
“Of March,” said the clerk, bending forward, “the
nineteenth of March; that's very strange.”
In a low voice they all acquiesced, and Solomon went
on:
“It was Mr. Reuben Haredale, Mr. Geoffrey's elder
brother, that twenty-two years ago was the owner of
the Warren, which, as Joe has said-not that you re-
member it, Joe, for a boy like you can't do that, but be-

cause you have often heard me say so—was then a much
larger and better place, and a much more valuable prop-
erty than it is now. His lady was lately dead, and he
was left with one child—the Miss Haredale you have
been inquiring about—who was then scarcely a year old.”
Although the speaker addressed himself to the man
who had shown so much curiosity about this same
family, and made a pause here as if expecting some ex-
clamation of surprise or encouragement, the latter made
no remark, nor gave any indication that he heard or was
interested in what was said. Solomon therefore turned
to his old companions, whose noses were brightly illumin-
ated by the deep red glow from the bowls of their pipes:
assured, by long experience, of their attention, and re-
solved to show his sense of such indecent behaviour.
“Mr. Haredale,” said Solomon, turning his back upon
the strange man, “left this place when his lady died,
feeling it lonely like, and went up to London, where he
stopped some months; but finding that place as lonely
as this—as I suppose and have always heard say-he
suddenly came back again with his little girl to the
Warren, bringing with him besides, that day, only two
women servants, and his steward and a gardener."
Mr. Daisy stopped to take a whiff at his pipe, which
was going out, and then proceeded-at first in a snuf-
fling tone, occasioned by keen enjoyment of the tobacco
and strong pulling at the pipe, and afterwards with in-
creasing distinctness:
“-Bringing with him two women servants, and his
steward and a gardener. The rest stopped behind up in
London, and were to follow next day. It happened that
that night, an old gentleman who lived at Chigwell Row,
and had long been poorly, deceased, and an order came
to me at half after twelve o'clock at night to go and
toll the passing-bell.”
There was a movement in the little group of listeners,
sufficiently indicative of the strong repugnance any
one of them would have felt to have turned out at such
a time upon such an errand. The clerk felt and under-
stood it, and pursued his theme accordingly :
“It was a dreary thing, especially as the grave-digger
was laid up in his bed, from long working in a damp
soil and sitting down to take his dinner on cold tomb-
stones, and I was consequently under obligations to go

leva whethand and Sesh
alone, for it was too late to hope to get any other com-
panion. However, I wasn't unprepared for it, as the old
gentleman had often made it a request that the bell
should be tolled as soon as possible after the breath was
out of his body, and he had been expected to go for some
days. I put as good a face upon it as I could, and
muffling myself up (for it was mortal cold), started out
with a lighted lantern in one hand and the key of the
church in the other."
* At this point of the narrative the dress of the strange
man rustled, as if he had turned himself to hear more
distinctly. Slightly pointing over his shoulder, Solomon
elevated his eyebrows and nodded a silent inquiry to
Joe whether this was the case. Joe shaded his eyes
with his hand and peered into the corner, but could make
out nothing, and so shook his head.
“It was just such a night as this; blowing a hurri-
cane, raining heavily, and very dark-I often think
now, darker than I ever saw it before or since; that may
be my fancy, but the houses were all close shut and the
folks in doors, and perhaps there is only one other man
who knows how dark it really was. I got into the church,
chained the door back so that it should keep ajar-for,
to tell the truth, I didn't like to be shut in there alone-
and putting my lantern on the stone seat in the little
corner where the bell-rope is, sat down beside it to trim
the candle.
“I sat down to trim the candle, and when I had done
so, I could not persuade myself to get up again and go
about my work. I don't know how it was, but I thought
of all the ghost stories I had ever heard, even those that
I had heard when I was a boy at school, and had for-
gotten long ago; and they didn't come into my mind
one after another, but all crowding at once, like. I
recollected one story there was in the village, how that
on a certain night in the year (it might be that very
night for anything I knew), all the dead people came
out of the ground and sat at the head of their own graves
till inorning. This made me think how many people I
had known, were buried between the church door and
the churchyard gate, and what a dreadful thing it would
be to have to pass among them and know them again,
so earthy and unlike themselves. I had known alĩ the
niches and arches in the church from a child; still, I

couldn't persuade myself that those were their natural
shadows which I saw on the pavement, but felt sure
there were some ugly figures hiding among 'em and
peeping out. Thinking on in this way, I began to think
of the old gentleman who was just dead, and I could
have sworn, as I looked up the dark chancel, that I saw
him in his usual place, wrapping his shroud about him,
and shivering as if he felt it cold. All this time I sat
listening and listening, and hardly dared to breathe.
At length I started up and took the bell-rope in my
hands. At that minute there rang—not that bell, for I
had hardly touched the rope—but another!
“I heard the ringing of another bell, and a deep bell
too, plainly. It was only for an instant, and even then
the wind carried the sound away, but I heard it. I
listened for a long time, but it rang no more. I had
heard of corpse candles, and at last I persuaded myself
that this must be a corpse bell tolling of itself at mid-
night for the dead. I tolled my bell-how, or how long,
I don't know-and ran home to bed as fast as I could
touch the ground.
“I was up early next morning after a restless night,
and told the story to my neighbours. Some were serious
and some made light of it. I don't think anybody be-
lieved it real. But, that morning, Mr. Reuben Hare-
dale was found murdered in his bedchamber; and in his
hand was a piece of the cord attached to an alarm-bell
outside the roof, which hung in his room and had been
cut asunder, no doubt by the murderer when he seized it.
“That was the bell I heard.
“A bureau was found opened, and a cash-box, which
Mr. Haredale had brought down that day, and was sup-
posed to contain a large sum of money, was gone. The
steward and gardener were both missing and both sus-
pected for a long time, but they were never found,
though hunted far and wide. And far enough they
might have looked for poor Mr. Rudge, the steward,
whose body-scarcely to be recognized by his clothes
and the watch and ring he wore—was found, months
afterwards, at the bottom of a piece of water in the
grounds, with a deep gash in the breast where he had
been stabbed with a knife. He was only partly dressed;
and the people all agreed that he had been sitting up
reading in his own room, where there were many traces

of blood, and was suddenly fallen upon and killed before
his master.
“Everybody now knew that the gardener must be the
murderer, and though he has never been heard of from
that time to this, he will be, mark my words. The
crime was committed this day two-and-twenty years--
on the nineteenth of March, one thousand seven hundred
and fifty-three. On the nineteenth of March in some
year—no matter when I know it, I am sure of it, for
we have always, in some strange way or other, been
brought back to the subject on that day ever since-on
the nineteenth of March in some year, sooner or later,
that man will be discovered.”
CHAPTER II.
“A STRANGE story!” said the man who had been the
cause of the narration. “Stranger still if it comes about
as you predict. Is that all?”
A question so unexpected, nettled Solomon Daisy not
a little. By dint of relating the story very often, and
ornamenting it (according to village report) with a few
flourishes suggested by the various hearers from time
to time, he had come by degrees to tell it with great
effect; and “is that all?" after the climax, was not what
he was accustomed to.
“Is that all?" he repeated, “yes, that's all, sir. And
enough too, I think.”
“I think so too. My horse, young man! He is but a
hack hired from a roadside posting house, but he must
carry me to London to-night.”
“To-night,” said Joe.
“To-night,” returned the other. “What do you stare
at? This tavern would seem to be a house of call for all
the gaping idlers of the neighbourhood!”
At this remark, which evidently had reference to the
scrutiny he had undergone, as mentioned in the fore-
going chapter, the eyes of John Willet and his friends
were diverted with marvellous rapidity to the copper
boiler again. Not so with Joe, who, being a mettlesome
fellow, returned the stranger's angry glance with a
steady look, and rejoined.

“It is not a very bold thing to wonder at your going
on to-night. Surely you have been asked such a harm-
less question in an inn before, and in better weather
than this. I thought you mightn't know the way, as
you seem strange to this part.”
“The way," repeated the other, irritably.
“Yes. Do you know it?"
“I'll-humph!--I'll find it,” replied the man, waving
his hand and turning on his heel. “Landlord, take the
reckoning here.”
John Willett did as he was desired; for on that point
he was seldom slow, except in the particulars of giving
change and testing the goodness of any piece of coin
that was proffered to him, by the application of his teeth
or his tongue, or some other test, or, in doubtful cases,
by a long series of tests terminating in its rejection.
The guest then wrapped his garments about him so as
to shelter himself as effectually as he could from the
rough weather, and without any word or sign of fare-
well betook himself to the stable-yard. Here Joe (who
had left the room on the conclusion of their short dia-
logue) was protecting himself and the horse from the
rain under the shelter of an old pent-house roof.
“He's pretty much of my opinion,” said Joe, patting
the horse upon the neck. “I'll wager that your stopping
here to-night would please him better than it would
please me.”
“He and I are of different opinions, as we have been
more than once on our way here,” was the short reply.
“So I was thinking before you came out, for he has
felt your spurs, poor beast.”
The stranger adjusted his coat collar about his face,
and made no answer.
“You'll know me again, I see,” he said, marking the
young fellow's earnest gaze, when he had sprung into
the saddle.
“The man's worth knowing, master, who travels a
road he don't know, mounted on a jaded horse, and
leaves good quarters to do it on such a night as this."
“You have sharp eyes and a sharp tongue, I find.”
“Both I hope from nature, but the last grows rusty
sometimes for want of using."
“Use the first less too, and keep their sharpness for
your sweethearts, boy,” said the man.

So saying he shook his hand from the bridle, struck
him roughly on the head with the butt end of his whip,
and galloped away; dashing through the mud and dark-
ness with a headlong speed, which few badly mounted
horsemen would have cared to venture, even had they
been thoroughly acquainted with the country; and
which, to one who knew nothing of the way he rode,
was attended at every step with great hazard and
danger.
The roads, even within twelve miles of London, were
at that time ill-paved, seldom repaired, and very badly
made. The way this rider traversed had been ploughed
up by the wheels of heavy wagons, and rendered rotten
by the frosts and thaws of the preceding winter, or pos-
sibly of many winters. Great holes and gaps had been
worn into the soil, which, being now filled with water
from the late rains, were not easily distinguishable even
by day; and a plunge into any one of them might have
brought down a surer-footed horse than the poor beast
now urged forward to the fullest extent of his powers.
Sharp flints and stones rolled from under his hoofs con-
tinually; the rider could scarcely see beyond the animal's
head, or farther on either side than his own arm would
have extended. At that time, too, all the roads in the
neighbourhood of the metropolis were infested by foot-
pads or highwaymen, and it was a night, of all others,
in which any evil-disposed person of this class might
have pursued his unlawful calling with little fear of
detection.
Still, the traveller dashed forward at the same reck-
less pace, regardless alike of the dirt and wet which flew
about his head, the profound darkness of the night, and
the probability of encountering some desperate charac-
ters abroad. At every turn and angle, even where a
deviation from the direct course might have been least
expected, and could not possibly be seen until he was
close upon it, he guided the bridle with an unerring
hand, and kept the middle of the road. Thus he sped
onward, raising himself in the stirrups, leaning his body
forward until it almost touched the horse's neck, and
flourishing his heavy whip above his head with the fer-
your of a madman.
There are times when, the elements being in unusual
commotion, those who are bent on daring enterprises, or

agitated by great thoughts, whether of good or evil, feel
a mysterious sympathy with the tumult of nature, and
are roused into corresponding violence. In the midst of
thunder, lightning, and storm, many tremendous deeds
have been committed; men, self-possessed before, have
given a sudden loose to passions they could no longer
control. The demons of wrath and despair have striven
to emulate those who ride the whirlwind and direct the
storm; and man, lashed into madness with the roaring
winds and boiling waters, has become for the time as
wild and merciless as the elements themselves.
Whether the traveller was possessed by thoughts
which the fury of the night had heated and stimulated
into a quicker current, or was merely impelled by some
strong motive to reach his journey's end, on he swept
more like a hunted phantom than a man, nor checked
his pace until, arriving at some cross roads, one of which
led by a longer road to the place whence he had so lately
started, he bore down so suddenly on a vehicle which
was coming towards him, that in the effort to avoid it
he well nigh pulled his horse upon his haunches, and
narrowly escaped being thrown.
“Yoho!” cried the voice of a man. “What's that?
who goes there?”
“A friend!” replied the traveller.
" A friend!" repeated the voice. “Who calls himself
a friend and rides like that, abusing Heaven's gifts in
the shape of horseflesh, and endangering, not only his
own neck (which might be no great matter) but the
necks of other people?"
“You have a lantern there, I see,” said the traveller,
dismounting, “lend it me for a moment. You have
wounded my horse, I think, with your shaft or wheel.”
“Wounded him!” cried the other, “if I haven't killed
him, it's no fault of yours. What do you mean by gal-
loping along the king's highway like that, eh?”
“Give me the light,” returned the traveller, snatching
it from his hand, and don't ask idle questions of a man
who is in no mood for talking.”
“If you had said you were in no mood for talking
before, I should perhaps have been in no mood for light-
ing,” said the voice. Hows’ever as it's the poor horse
that's damaged and not you, one of you is welcome to
the light at all events—but it's not the crusty one."

The traveller returned no answer to this speech, but
holding the light near to his panting and reeking beast,
examined him in limb and carcase. Meanwhile the
other man sat very composedly in his vehicle, which
was a kind of chaise with a depository for a large bag
of tools, and watched his proceedings with a careful
eye.
The looker-on was a round, red-faced, sturdy yeoman,
with a double chin, and a voice husky with good living,
good sleeping, good humour, and good health. He was
past the prime of life, but Father Time is not always a
hard parent, and, though he tarries for none of his chil-
dren, often lays his hand lightly upon those who have
used him well; making them old men and women inex-
orably enough, but leaving their hearts and spirits young
and in full vigour. With such people the grey head is
but the impression of the old fellow's hand in giving
them his blessing, and every wrinkle but a notch in the
quiet calendar of a well spent-life.
The person whom the traveller had so abruptly encoun-
tered was of this kind: bluff, hale, hearty, and in a green
old age, at peace with himself, and evidently disposed to
to be so with all the world. Although muffled up in divers
coats and handkerchiefs—one of which, passed over his
crown and tied in a convenient crease of his double chin,
secured his three-cornered hat and bob-wig from blow-
ing off his head—there was no disguising his plump and
comfortable figure; neither did certain dirty finger-
marks upon his face give it any other than an odd and
comical expression, through which its natural good
humour shone with undiminished lustre.
“He is not hurt," said the traveller at length, raising
his head and the lantern together.
“You have found that out at last, have you?” re-
joined the old man. “My eyes have seen more light
than yours, but I wouldn't change with you.”
“What do you mean?”
“Mean! I could have told you he wasn't hurt, five
minutes ago. Give me the light, friend; ride forward
at a gentler pace; and good-night.”
In handing up the lantern, the man necessarily cast
its rays full on the speaker's face. Their eyes met at
the instant. He suddenly dropped it and crushed it
with his foot.

“ Did you never see a locksmith before, that you start
as if you had come upon a ghost ?” cried the old man in
the chaise,“ or is this,” he added, hastily, thrusting his
hand into the tool basket and drawing out a hammer,
“a scheme for robbing me? I know these roads, friend.
When I travel them, I carry nothing but a few shillings,
and not a crown's worth of them. I tell you plainly,
to save us both trouble, that there's nothing to be got
from me but a pretty stout arm, considering my years,
and this tool, which, mayhap from long acquaintance
with, I can use pretty briskly. You shall not have it
all your own way, I promise you, if you play at that
game.” With these words he stood upon the defensive.
“I am not what you take me for, Gabriel Varden,"
replied the other.
76 Then what and who are you?” returned the lock..
smith. “You know my name, it seems. Let me know
yours.”
“I have not gained the information from any confi.
dence of yours, but from the inscription on your cart,
which tells it to all the town,” replied the traveller.
“You had better eyes for that then you had for your
horse then,” said Varden, descending nimbly from his
chaise. “Who are you? Let me see your face.”
While the locksmith alighted, the traveller had re-
gained his saddle, from which he now confronted the
old man, who, moving as the horse moved in chafing
under the tightened rein, kept close beside him.
“Let me see your face, I say.”
“Stand off!"
“No masquerading tricks,” said the locksmith,” and
tales at the club to-morrow, how Gabriel Varden was
frightened by a surly voice and a dark night. Stand-
let me see your face.”
Finding that further resistance would only involve
him in a personal struggle with an antagonist by no
means to be despised, the traveller threw back his
coat, and stooping down looked steadily at the lock-
smith.
Perhaps two men more powerfully contrasted, never
opposed each other face to face. The ruddy features of
the locksmith so set off and heightened the excessive
paleness of the man on horseback, that he looked like a
bloodless ghost, while the moisture, which hard riding

had brought out upon his skin, hung there in dark and
heavy drops, like dews of agony and death. The coun-
tenance of the old locksmith was lighted up with the
smile of one expecting to detect in this unpromising
stranger some latent roguery of eye and lip, which would
reveal a familiar person in that arch disguise, and spoil
his jest. The face of the other, sullen and fierce, but
shrinking too, was that of a man who stood at bay;
while his firmly closed jaws, his puckered mouth, and
more than all a certain stealthy motion of the hand
within his breast, seemed to announce a desperate pur-
pose very foreign to acting, or child's play.
Thus they regarded each other for some time, in
silence.
“Humph !” he said when he had scanned his features;
“ I don't know you.
“Don't desire to ?” returned the other, muffling him-
self as before.
“I don't,” said Gabriel; “to be plain with you, friend,
you don't carry in your countenance a letter of recom-
mendation.”
“It's not my wish,” said the traveller. “My humour is
to be avoided.”
“Well,” said the locksmith, bluntly, “I think you'll
have your humour.”
“I will, at any cost,” rejoined the traveller. “In
proof of it, lay this to heart—that you were never in
such peril of your life as you have been within these few
moments; when you are within five minutes of breath-
ing your last, you will not be nearer death than you
have been to-night!"
“Aye!” said the sturdy locksmith.
“ Aye! and a violent death.”
“From whose hand?”
"From mine,” replied the traveller.
With that he put spurs to his horse, and rode away;
at first plashing heavily through the mire at a smart
trot, but gradually increasing in speed until the last
sound of his horse's hoofs died away upon the wind;
when he was again hurrying on at the same furious gal-
lop, which had been his pace when the locksmith first
encountered him.
Gabriel Varden remained standing in the road with
the broken lantern in his hand, listening in stupefied

silence until no sound reached his ear but the moaning
of the wind, and the fast-falling rain; when he struck
himself one or two smart blows in the breast by way of
rousing himself, and broke into an exclamation of sur-
prise.
“What in the name of wonder can this fellow be! a
madman? a highwayman? a cut-throat? If he had not
scoured off so fast, we'd have seen who was in most
danger, he or I. I never nearer death than I have
been to-night! I hope I may be no nearer to it for a
score of years to come-if so, I'll be content to be no
farther from it. My stars!—a pretty brag this to a stout
man-pooh, pooh!”
Gabriel resumed his seat, and looked wistfully up the
road by which the traveller had come; murmuring in a
half whisper:
“The Maypole-two miles to the Maypole. I came the
other road from the Warren after a long day's work at
locks and bells, on purpose that I should not come by the
Maypole and break my promise to Martha by looking in
—there's resolution! It would be dangerous to go on to
London without a light; and it's four miles, and a good
half mile besides, to the Halfway-House; and between
this and that is the very place where one needs a light
most. Two miles to the Maypole! I told Martha I
wouldn't; I said I wouldn't, and I didn't-there's resolu-
tion.
Repeating these two last words very often, as if to
compensate for the little resolution he was going to show
by piquing himself on the great resolution he had shown,
Gabriel Varden quietly turned back, determining to
get a light at the Maypole, and to take nothing but a
light.
When he got to the Maypole, however, and Joe, re-
sponding to his well-known hail, came running out to
the horse's head, leaving the door open behind him, and
disclosing a delicious perspective of warmth and bright-
ness—when the ruddy gleam of the fire, streaming
through the old red curtains of the common room, seemed
to bring with it, as part of itself, a pleasant hum of
voices, and a fragrant odour of steaming grog and rare
tobacco, all steeped as it were in the cheerful glow-
when the shadows, flitting across the curtain, showed
that those inside had risen from their snug seats, and

were making room in the snuggest corner (how well he
knew that corner!) for the honest locksmith, and a broad
glare, suddenly streaming up, bespoke the goodness of
the crackling log from which a brilliant train of sparks
was doubtless at that moment whirling up the chimney
in honour of his coming—when, superadded to these
enticements, there stole upon him from the distant
kitchen a gentle sound of frying, with a musical clatter
of plates and dishes, and a savoury smell that made
even the boisterous wind a perfume-Gabriel felt his
firmness oozing rapidly away. He tried to look stoically
at the tavern, but his features would relax into a look of
fondness. He turned his head the other way, and the
cold, black country seemed to frown him off, anddrive
him for a refuge into its hospitable arms.
“The merciful man, Joe,” said the locksmith, “is
merciful to his beast. I'll get out for a little while.”
And how natural it was to get out. And how unnatu-
ral it seemed for a sober man to be plodding wearily
along through miry roads, encountering the rude buffets
of the wind and pelting of the rain, when there was a
clean floor covered with crisp white sand, a well-swept
hearth, a blazing fire, a table decorated with white cloth,
bright pewter fiagons, and other tempting preparations
for a well-cooked meal-when there were these things,
and company disposed to make the most of them, all
ready to his hand and entreating him to enjoyment!
CHAPTER III.
SUCH were the locksmith's thoughts when first seated
in the snug corner, and slowly recovering from a pleas-
ant defect of vision-pleasant because occasioned by the
wind blowing in his eyes—which made it a matter of
sound policy and duty to himself, that he should take
refuge from the weather, and tempted him, for the same
reason, to aggravate a slight cough, and declare he felt
but poorly. Such were still his thoughts more than a
full hour afterwards, when, supper over, he still sat with
shining, jovial face in the same warm nook, listening to
the cricket-like chirrup of little Solomon Daisy, and bear-

“I wish he may be an honest man, that's all,” said
Solomon, winding up a variety of speculations relative
to the stranger, concerning whom Gabriel had com-
pared notes with the company, and so raised a grave
discussion; “I wish he may be an honest man.”
“So we all do, I suppose, don't we?” observed the
locksmith.
* “I don't,” said Joe.
“No!” cried Gabriel.
“No. He struck me with his whip, the coward, when
he was mounted and I afoot, and I should be better
pleased that he turned out what I think of him.”
“And what may that be, Joe?
"No good, Mr. Varden. You may shake your head,
father, but I say no good, and will say no good, and I
would say no good a hundred times over, if that would
bring him back to have the drubbing he deserves.
“Hold your tongue, sir,” said John Willet.
“I won't, father. It's all along of you that he ven-
tured to do what he did. Seeing me treated like a child,
and put down like a fool, he plucks up a heart and has a
fling at a fellow that he thinks-and may well think too
-hasn't a grain of spirit. But he's mistaken, as I'll show
him, and as I'll show all of you before long.”
“Does the boy know what he's a saying of!” cried the
astonished John Willet.
1 “Father,” returned Joe, “I know what I say and
mean, well-better than you do when you hear me. I
can bear with you, but I cannot bear the contempt that
your treating me in the way you do, brings upon me
from others every day. Look at other young men of
my age. Have they no liberty, no will, no right to
speak? Are they obliged to sit mumchance, and to be
ordered about till they are the laughing stock of young
and old? I am a bye-word all over Chigwell, and I say
-and it's fairer my saying so now, than waiting till you
are dead, and I have got your money-I say, that before
long I shall be driven to break such bounds, and that
when I do, it won't be me that you'll have to blame, but
your own self, and no other.”
John Willet was so amazed by the exasperation and
boldness of his hopeful son, that he sat as one bewil-

dered, staring in a ludicrous manner at the boiler, and
endeavouring, but quite ineffectually, to collect his
tardy thoughts, and invent an answer. The guests,
scarcely less disturbed, were equally at a loss; and at
length, with a variety of muttered, half-expressed con-
dolences, and pieces of advice, rose to depart; being at
the same time slightly muddled with liquor.
The honest locksmith alone addressed a few words of
coherent and sensible advice to both parties, urging
John Willet to remember that Joe was nearly arrived at
man's estate, and should not be ruled with too tight a
hand, and exhorting Joe himself to bear with his father's
caprices, and rather endeavour to turn them aside by
temperate remonstrance than by ill-timed rebellion.
This advice was received as such advice usually is. On
John Willet it made almost as much impression as on
the sign outside the door, while Joe, who took it in the
best part, avowed himself more obliged than he could
well express, but politely intimated his intention, never-
theless, of taking his own course uninfluenced by any-
body.
“You have always been a very good friend to me, Mr.
Varden,” he said, as they stood without, in the porch,
and the locksmith was equipping himself for his journey
home; “I take it very kind of you to say all this, but
the time's nearly come when the Maypole and I must
part company."
“Roving stones gather no moss, Joe,” said Gabriel.
“Nor mile-stones much,” replied Joe. “I'm little
better than one here, and see as much of the world.”
“ Then, what would you do, Joe,” pursued the lock-.
smith, stroking his chin reflectively. ** What could you
be? where could you go, you see?"
“I must trust to chance, Mr. Varden.”
“A bad thing to trust to, Joe. I don't like it.
I always tell my girl, when we talk about a husband for
her, never to trust to chance, but to make sure before-
hand that she has a good man and true, and then chance
will neither make her nor break her. What are you
fidgeting about there, Joe? Nothing gone in the
harness, I hope?".
“No, no,” said Joe-finding, however, something very
engrossing to do in the way of strapping and buckling
---- Miss Dolly quite well?”

“Hearty, thankye. She looks pretty enough to be
well, and good too.”
“She's always both, sir—".
“ So she is, thank God!”
“I hope,” said Joe, after some hesitation, “that you
won't tell this story against me—this of my having been
beat like the boy they'd made of me—at all events, till I
have met this man again and settled the account. It'll
be a better story then.”
" Why, who should I tell it to?” returned Gabriel.
“ They know it here, and I'm not likely to come across
anybody else who would care about it.”
“That's true enough,” said the young fellow with a
sigh. “I quite forgot that. Yes, that's true!”
So saying, he raised his face, which was very red-
no doubt from the exertion of strapping and buckling as
aforesaid—and giving the reins to the old man, who had
by this time taken his seat, sighed again and bade him
good-night.
“Good-night!” cried Gabriel. “Now think better of
what we have just been speaking of, and don't be rash,
there's a good fellow! I have an interest in you, and
wouldn't have you cast yourself away. Good-night!”
Returning his cheery farewell with cordial good will,
Joe Willet lingered until the sound of wheels ceased to
vibrate in his ears, and then, shaking his head mourn-
fully, re-entered the house.
Gabriel Varden went his way towards London, think-
ing of a great many things, and most of all of flaming
terms in which to relate his adventure, and so account
satisfactorily to Mrs. Varden for visiting the Maypole,
despite certain solemn covenants between himself and
that lady. Thinking begets, not only thought, but
drowsiness occasionally, and the more the locksmith
thought, the more sleepy he became.
A man may be very sober—or at least firmly set upon
his legs on that neutral ground which lies between the
confines of perfect sobriety and slight tipsiness-and
yet feel a strong tendency to mingle up present circum-
stances with others which have no manner of connexion
with them; to confound all consideration of persons,
things, times, and places; and to jumble his disjointed
thoughts together in a kind of mental kaleidoscope,
producing combinations as unexpected as they are

transitory. This was Gabriel Varden's state, as, nodding
in his dog sleep, and leaving his horse to pursue a road
with which he was well acquainted, he got over the
ground unconsciously, and drew nearer and nearer
home. He had roused himself once, when the horse
stopped until the turnpike gate was opened, and had
cried a lusty “good-night!” to the toll-keeper; but then
he awoke out of a dream about picking a lock in the
stomach of the Great Mogul, and even when he did
wake, mixed up the turnpike man with his mother-in-
law, who had been dead twenty years. It is not surpris-
ing, therefore, that he soon relapsed, and jogged heavily
along, quite insensible to his progress.
And, now, he approached the great city, which lay
outstretched before him like a dark shadow on the
ground, reddening the sluggish air with a deep dull
light, that told of labyrinths of public ways and shops,
and swarms of busy people. Approaching nearer and
nearer yet, this halo began to fade, and the causes which
produced it slowly to develop themselves. Long lines
of poorly lighted streets might be faintly traced, with
here and there a lighter spot, where lamps were clustered
about a square or market, or round some great building;
after a time these grew more distinct, and the lamps
themselves were visible; slight yellow specks, that
seemed to be rapidly snuffed out, one by one, as
intervening obstacles hid them from the sight. Then,
sounds arose—the striking of church clocks, the distant
bark of dogs, the hum of traffic in the streets; then out-
lines might be traced-tall steeples looming in the air
and piles of unequal roofs oppressed by chimneys; then,
the noise swelled into a louder sound, and forms grew
more distinct and numerous still, and London-visible
in the darkness by its own faint light, and not by that
of Heaven-was at hand.
The locksmith, however, all unconscious of its near
vicinity, still jogged on, half sleeping and half waking,
when a loud cry at no great distance ahead, roused him
with a start.
For a moment or two he looked about him like a man
who had been transported to some strange country in
his sleep, but soon recognizing familiar objects, rubbed
his eyes lazily, and might have relapsed again, but that
the cry was repeated—not once or twice or thrice, but

many times, and each time, if possible, with increased
vehemence. Thoroughly aroused, Gabriel, who was a:
bold man and not easily daunted, made straight to the
spot, urging on his stout little horse as if for life or
death.
The matter indeed looked sufficiently serious, for,
coming to the place whence the cries had proceeded, he
descried the figure of a man extended in an apparently
lifeless state upon the pathway, and, hovering round
him, another person with a torch in his hand, which he
waved in the air with a wild impatience, redoubling
meanwhile those cries for help which had brought the
locksmith to the spot.
“What's here to do?” said the old man, alighting.
“How's this-what-Barnaby?”
The bearer of the torch shook his long loose hair back
from his eyes, and thrusting his face eagerly into that
of the locksmith, fixed upon him a look which told his
history at once.
“You know me, Barnaby?” said Varden.
He nodded-not once or twice, but a score of times,
and that with a fantastic exaggeration which would have
kept his head in motion for an hour, but that the lock-
smith held up his finger, and fixing his eye sternly upon
him caused him to desist; then pointed to the body with
an inquiring look.
. “There's blood upon him,” said Barnaby with a shudder.
“It makes me sick.”
“How came it there?” demanded Varden.
“Steel, steel, steel!” he replied fiercely, imitating with
his hand the thrust of a sword.
• Is he robbed?” said the locksmith.
Barnaby caught him by the arm, and nodded “Yes;"
then pointed towards the city.
"Oh!” said the old man, bending over the body and
looking round as he spoke into Barnaby's pale face,
strangely lighted up by something which was not in-
tellect." The robber made off that way, did he? Well,
well, never mind that just now. Hold your torch this
way-a little farther off-SO. Now stand quiet, while I
try to see what harm is done.”.
With these words he applied himself to a closer ex-
amination of the prostrate form, while Barnaby, hold-
ing the torch as he had been directed, looked on in

silence, fascinated by interest or curiosity, but repelled,
nevertheless, by some strong and secret horror which
convulsed him in every nerve.
As he stood, at that moment, half shrinking back
and half bending forward, both his face and his figure
were full in the strong glare of the link, and as dis-
stinctly revealed as though it had been broad day. He
was about three-and-twenty years old, and though
rather spare, of a fair height and strong make. His
hair, of which he had a great profusion, was red, and
hanging in disorder about his face and shoulders, gave
to his restless looks an expression quite unearthly-en-
hanced by the paleness of his complexion and the glassy
lustre of his large protruding eyes. Startling as this
aspect was, the features were good, and there was some-
thing even plaintive in his wan and haggard aspect.
But, the absence of the soul is far more terrible in a
living man than in a dead one; and in this unfortunate
being its noblest powers were wanting.
His dress was of green, clumsily trimmed here and
there—apparently by his own hands-with gaudy lace;
brightest where the cloth was most worn and soiled, and
poorest where it was at the best. A pair of tawdry
ruffles dangled at his wrists, while his throat was nearly
bare. He had ornamented his hat with a cluster of
peacock's feathers, but they were limp and broken, and
now trailed negligently down his back. Girt to his side
was the steel hilt of an old sword without blade or
scabbard; and some parti-coloured ends of ribands and
poor glass toys completed the ornamental portion of his
attire. The Auttered and confused disposition of all
the motley scraps that formed his dress, bespoke, in a
scarcely less degree than his eager and unsettled man-
ner, the disorder of his mind, and by a grotesque con-
trast set off and heightened the more impressive wildness
of his face.
“ Barnaby,” said the locksmith, after a hasty but care-
ful inspection, “this man is not dead, but he has a wound
in his side, and is in a fainting-fit.”
“I know him, I know him!” cried Barnaby, clapping
his hands.
“Know him?" repeated the locksmith.
“ Hush!” said Barnaby, laying his fingers on his lips.
“He went out to-day a wooing. I wouldn't for a light

guinea that he should never go a wooing again, for, if
he did, some eyes would grow dim that are now as bright
as-see, when I talk of eyes, the stars come out! Whose
eyes are they? If they are angels' eyes, why do they
look down here and see good men hurt, and only wink
and sparkle all the night?"
“Now Heaven help this silly fellow,” murmured the
perplexed locksmith, can he know this gentleman?
His mother's house is not far off; I had better see if she
can tell me who he is. Barnaby, my man, help me to
put him in the chaise, and we'll ride home together.”
“I can't touch him!” cried the idiot, falling back, and
shuddering as with a strong spasm; “ he's bloody!"
“It's in his nature I know," muttered the locksmith,
“it's cruel to ask him, but I must have help. Barnaby
-good Barnaby-dear Barnaby—if you know this gen-
tleman, for the sake of his life and everybody's life that
loves him, help me to raise him and lay him down.”
“ Cover him then, wrap him close-don't let me see it
-smell it-hear the word. Don't speak the word
don't!”
"No, no, I'll not. There, you see he's covered now.
Gently. Well done, well done!”
They placed him in the carriage with great ease, for
Barnaby was strong and active, but all the time they
were so occupied he shivered from head to foot, and evi-
dently experienced an ecstacy of terror.
This accomplished, and the wounded man being cov-
ered with Varden's own great-coat, which he took off for
the purpose, they proceeded onward at a brisk pace:
Barnaby gaily counting the stars upon his fingers, and
Gabriel inwardly congratulating himself upon having an
adventure now, which would silence Mrs. Varden upon
the subject of the Maypole, for that night, or there was
no faith in woman.

CHAPTER IV.
-
-
--
In the venerable suburb-it was a suburb once-of
Clerkenwell, towards that part of its confines which is
nearest to the Charter House, and in one of those cool,
shady streets, of which a few, widely scattered and dis-
persed, yet remain in such old parts of the metropolis
-each tenement quietly vegetating like an ancient citi-
zen who long ago retired from business, and dozing on
in its infirmity until in course of time it tumbles down,
and is replaced by some extravagant young heir, flaunt-
ing in stucco and ornamental work, and all the vanities
of modern days-in this quarter, and in a street of this
description, the business of the present chapter lies.
At the time of which it treats, though only six-and-
sixty years ago, a very large part of what is London
now had no existence. Even in the brains of the wildest
speculators, there had sprung up no long rows of streets
connecting Highgate with Whitechapel, no assemblages
of palaces in the swampy levels, nor little cities in the
open fields. Although this part of town was then, as
now, parcelled out in streets, and plentifully peopled,
it wore a different aspect. There were gardens to many
of the houses, and trees by the pavement side; with an
air of freshness breathing up and down, which in these
days would be sought in vain. Fields were nigh at
hand, through which the New River took its winding
course, and where there was merry hay-making in the
summer time. Nature was not so far removed, or hard
to get at, as in these days; and although there were
busy trades in Clerkenwell, and working jewellers by
scores, it was a purer place, with farm-houses nearer to
it than many modern Londoners would readily believe,
and lovers' walks at no great distance, which turned
into squalid courts, long before the lovers of this age
were born, or, as the phrase goes, thought of.
In one of these streets, the cleanest of them all, and
on the shady side of the way for good housewives
know that sunlight damages their cherished furniture,
and so choose the shade rather than its intrusive glare
--there stood the house with which we have to deal. It

was a modest building, not very straight, not large, not
tall; not bold-faced, with great staring windows, but a
shy blinking house, with a conical roof going up into a
peak over its garret window of four small panes of glass,
like a cocked hat on the head of an elderly gentleman
with one eye. It was not built of brick or lofty stone,
but of wood and plaster; it was not planned with a dull
and wearisome regard to regularity, for no one window
matched the other, or seemed to have the slightest ref-
erence to anything besides itself.
The shop-for it had a shop—was, with reference to
the first floor, where shops usually are; and there all
resemblance between it and any other shop stopped short
and ceased. People who went in and out didn't go up a
flight of steps to it, or walk easily in upon a level with
the street, but dived down three steep stairs, as into a
cellar. Its floor was paved with stone and brick, as that
of any other cellar might be; and in lieu of window
framed and glazed it had a great black wooden flap or
shutter, nearly breast high from the ground, which
turned back in the day-time, admitting as much cold air
as light, and very often more. Behind this shop was a
wainscoted parlour, looking first into a paved yard, and
beyond that again into a little terrace garden raised
some feet above it. Any stranger would have supposed
that this wainscoted parlour, saving for the door of com-
munication by which he had entered, was cut off and
detached from all the world; and indeed most strangers
on their first entrance were observed to grow extremely
thoughtful, as weighing and pondering in their minds
whether the upper rooms were only approachable by lad-
ders from without; never suspecting that two of the most
unassuming and unlikely doors in existence, which the
most ingenious mechanism on earth must of necessity
have supposed to be the doors of closets, opened out of
this room-each without the smallest preparation, or so
much as a quarter of an inch of passage—upon two dark
winding flights of stairs, the one upward, the other
downward, which were the sole means of communica-
tion between that chamber and the other portions of
the house.
With all these oddities, there was not a neater, more
scrupulously tidy, or more punctiliously ordered house,
in Clerkenwell, in London,in all England. There were not

cleaner windows, or whiter floors, or brighter stoves, or
more highly shining articles of furniture in old mahog-
any; there was not more rubbing, scrubbing, burnishing,
and polishing, in the whole street put together, nor was
this excellence attained without some cost and trouble
and great expenditure of voice, as the neighbours were
frequently reminded when the good lady of the house
overlooked and assisted in its being put to rights on
cleaning days—which were usually from Monday morn-
ing till Saturday night, both days inclusive.
Leaning against the door-post of this, his dwelling,
the locksmith stood early in the morning after he had
met the wounded man, gazing disconsolately at a great
wooden emblem of a key, painted in vivid yellow to
resemble gold, which dangled from the house-front, and
swung to and fro with a mournful creaking noise, as if
complaining that it had nothing to unlock. Sometimes
he looked over his shoulder into the shop, which was so
dark and dingy with numerous tokens of his trade, and
so blackened by the smoke of a little forge, near which
his 'prentice was at work, that it would have been diffi-
cult for one unused to such espials to have distinguished
anything but various tools of uncouth make and shape,
great bunches of rusty keys, fragments of iron, half-
finished locks, and such like things, which garnished the
walls and hung in clusters from the ceiling.
After a long and patient contemplation of the golden
key, and many such backward glances, Gabriel stepped
into the road, and stole a look at the upper windows.
One of them chanced to be thrown open at the moment,
and a roguish face met his; a face lighted up by the
loveliest pair of sparkling eyes that ever locksmith
looked upon; the face of a pretty, laughing girl; dimpled
and fresh and healthful—the very impersonation of
good-humour and blooming beauty.
“Hush!" she whispered, bending forward and point-
ing archly to the window underneath. “Mother is still
asleep."
“Still, my dear," returned the locksmith, in the same
tone. "You talk as if you had been asleep all night,
instead of little more than half an hour. But I'm very
thankful. Sleep's a blessing—no doubt about it.” The
last few words he muttered to himself.
“How cruel of you to keep us up so late this morning,

and never tell us where you were, or send us word!” said
the girl.
“Ah, Dolly, Dolly!" returned the locksmith, shaking
his head and smiling, “ how cruel of you to run up stairs
to bed! Come down to breakfast, madcap, and come
down lightly, or you'll wake your mother. She must be
tired, I am sure-I am.”
Keeping these latter words to himself, and returning
his daughter's nod, he was passing into the workshop,
with the smile she had awakened still beaming on his
face, when he just caught sight of his 'prentice's brown
paper cap ducking down to avoid observation, and
shrinking from the window back to its former place,
which the wearer no sooner reached than he began to
hammer lustily.
“Listening again, Simon!” said Gabriel to himself.
“That's bad. What in the name of wonder does he ex-
pect the girl to say, that I always catch him listening
when she speaks, and never at any other time! A bad
habit, Sim, a sneaking, underhanded way. Ah! you
may hammer, but you won't beat that out of me if you
work at it till your time's up!"
So saying, and shaking his head gravely, he re-entered
the workshop, and confronted the subject of these re-
marks.
“There's enough of that just now," said the lock-
smith. “You needn't make any more of that con-
founded clatter. Breakfast's ready.”
“Sir,” said Sim, looking up with amazing politeness,
and a peculiar little bow cut short off at the neck. “I
shall attend you immediately.”
“I suppose," muttered Gabriel, “ that's out of the
'Prentice's Garland, or the 'Prentice's Delight, or the
'Prentice's Warbler, or the 'Prentice's Guide to the Gal-
lows, or some such improving text-book. Now he's
going to beautify himself-here's a precious lock-
smith!”
Quite unconscious that his master was looking on
from the dark corner by the parlour door, Sim threw off
the paper cap, sprang from his seat, and in two extra-
ordinary steps, something between skating and minuet
dancing, bounded to a washing place at the other end of
the shop, and there removed from his face and hands
all traces of his previous work-practising the same

step all the time with the utmost gravity. This done,
he drew from some concealed place a little scrap of
looking-glass, and with its assistance arranged his hair,
and ascertained the exact state of a little carbuncle on
his nose. Having now completed his toilet, he placed
the fragment of mirror on a low bench, and looked over
his shoulder at so much of his legs as could be reflected
in that small compass with the greatest possible com-
placency and satisfaction.
Sim, as he was called in the blacksmith's family, or
Mr. Simon Tappertit, as he called himself, and required
all men to style him out of doors, on holidays and Sun-
days out, was an old-fashioned, thin-faced, sleek-haired,
sharp-nosed, small-eyed little fellow, very little more
than five feet high, and thoroughly convinced in his own
mind that he was above the middle size; rather tall, in
fact, than otherwise. Of his figure, which was well
enough formed, though somewhat of the leanest, he en-
tertained the highest admiration; and with his legs,
which, in knee-breeches, were perfect curiosities of
littleness, he was enraptured to a degree amounting to
enthusiasm. He also had some majestic, shadowy ideas,
which had never been quite fathomed by his intimate
friends, concerning the power of his eye. Indeed he had
been known to go so far as to boast that he could utterly
quell and subdue the haughtiest beauty by a simple pro-
cess, which he termed "eyeing her over;" but it must be
added, that neither of this faculty, nor of the power he
claimed to have, through the same gift, of vanquishing
and heaving down dumb animals, even in a rabid state,
had he ever furnished evidence which could be deemed
quite satisfactory and conclusive.
It may be inferred from these premises that in the
small body of Mr. Tappertit there was locked up an am-
bitious and aspiring soul. As certain liquors confined
in casks too cramped in their dimensions, will ferment,
and fret, and chafe in their imprisonment, so the spirit-
ual essence or soul of Mr. Tappertit would sometimes
fume within that precious cask, his body, until, with
great foam and froth and splutter, it would force a vent,
and carry all before it. It was his custom to remark, in
reference to any one of these occasions, that his soul
had got into his head; and in this novel kind of intoxi-
cation, many scrapes and mishaps befel him, which he

had frequently concealed with no small difficulty from
his worthy master.
Sim Tappertit, among the other fancies upon which his
before-mentioned soul was forever feasting and regaling
itself (and which fancies, like the liver of Prometheus,
grew as they were fed upon), had a mighty notion of his
order; and had been heard by the servant-maid openly
expressing his regret that the 'prentices no longer carried
clubs wherewith to mace the citizens: that was his
strong expression. He was likewise reported to have
said that in former times a stigma had been cast upon
the body by the execution of George Barnwell, to which
they should not have basely submitted, but should have
demanded him of the legislature-temperately at first;
then by an appeal to arms, if necessary—to be dealt
with as they in their wisdom might think fit. These
thoughts always led him to consider what a glorious
engine the 'prentices might yet become if they had but
a master spirit'at their head; and then he would darkly
and to the terror of his hearers hint at certain reckless
fellows that he knew of, and at a certain Lion Heart
ready to become their captain, who, once afoot, would
make the Lord Mayor tremble on his throne..
In respect of dress and personal decoration, Sim Tap-
pertit was no less of an adventurous and enterprising
character. He had been seen beyond dispute to pull off
ruffles of the finest quality at the corner of the street on
Sunday nights, and to put them carefully in his pocket
before returning home: and it was quite notorious that
on all great holiday occasions it was his habit to ex-
change his plain steel knee-buckles for a pair of glitter-
ing paste, under cover of a friendly post, planted most
conveniently in that same spot. Add to this that he was
in years just twenty, in his looks much older, and in
conceit at least two hundred; that he had no objection
to be jested with, touching his admiration of his master's
daughter; and had even, when called upon at a certain
obscure tavern to pledge the lady whom he honoured
with his love, toasted with many winks and leers, a fair
creature whose Christian name, he said, began with a
D—;-and as much is known of Sim Tappertit, who has
by this time followed the locksmith in to breakfast, as is
necessary to be known in making his acquaintance.
It was a substantial meal; for, over and above the or-

dinary tea equipage, the board creaked beneath the
weight of a jolly round of beef, a ham of the first magni-
tude, and sundry towers of buttered Yorkshire cake,
piled slice upon slice in most alluring order. There was
also a goodly jug of well-browned clay, fashioned into
the form of an old gentleman, not by any means unlike
the locksmith, atop of whose bald head was a fine white
froth answering to his wig, indicative, beyond dispute,
of sparkling home-brewed ale. But, better far than fair
home-brewed, or Yorkshire cake, or ham, or beef, or
anything to eat or drink that earth or air or water can
supply, there sat, presiding over all, the locksmith's rosy
daughter, before whose dark eyes even beef grew in-
significant, and malt became as nothing.
Fathers should never kiss their daughters when young
men are by. It's too much. There are bounds to human
endurance. So thought Sim Tappertit when Gabriel
drew those rosy lips to his—those lips within Sim's
reach from day to day, and yet so far off. He had a
respect for his master, but he wished the Yorkshire cake
might choke him.
"Father,” said the locksmith's daughter, when this
salute was over, and they took their seats at table,
“what is this I hear about last night?”
“All true, my dear; true as the Gospel, Doll.”
“Young Mr. Chester robbed, and lying wounded in
the road, when you came up?"
“Ay-Mr. Edward. And beside him, Barnaby calling
for help with all his might. It was well it happened as
it did; for the road's a lonely one, the hour was late,
and, the night being cold, and poor Barnaby even less
sensible than usual from surprise and fright, the young
gentleman might have met his death in a very short
time.”
“I dread to think of it!" cried his daughter with a
shudder. “How did you know him?”
“Know him!” returned the locksmith. “I didn't know
him-how could I? I had never seen him, often as I
had heard and spoken of him. I took him to Mrs.
Rudge's; and she no sooner saw him than the truth
came out.”
“Miss Emma, father-if this news should reach her,
enlarged upon as it is sure to be, she will go distracted.”
“Why lookye there again, how a man suffers for

being good-natured," said the locksmivil. “Miss Emma
was with her uncle at the masquerade at Carlisle House,
where she had gone, as the people at the Warren told
me, sorely against her will. What does your block-
head father, when he and Mrs. Rudge have laid their
heads together, but goes there when he ought to be abed,
makes interest with his friend the doorkeeper, slips him
on a mask and domino, and mixes with the masquers.”
“And like himself to do so!” cried the girl, putting
her fair arm round his neck, and giving him a most
enthusiastic kiss.
“Like himself!” repeated Gabriel, affecting to grum-
ble, but evidently delighted with the part he had taken,
and with her praise. “Very like himself-so your
mother said. However, he mingled with the crowd,
and prettily worried and badgered he was, I warrant
you, with people squeaking, ‘Don't you know me?' and
I've found you out,' and all that kind of nonsense in
his ears. He might have wandered on till now, but in
a little room there was a young lady who had taken off
her mask, on account of the place being very warm,
and was sitting alone.”
“ And that was she?" said his daughter, hastily.
“And that was she,” replied the locksmith; "and I no
sooner whispered to her what the matter was-as softly,
Doll, and with nearly as much art as you could have
used yourself—than she gives a kind of scream and faints
away.”
“What did you do-wbat happened next?” asked his
daughter.
"Why, the masks came flocking round, with a general
noise and hubbub, and I thought myself in luck to get
clear off, that's all,” rejoined the locksmith. “What
happened when I reached home you may guess, if you
didn't hear it. Ah! Well, it's a poor heart that never
rejoices. Put Toby this way, my dear.”
This Toby was the brown jug of which previous men-
tion has been made. Applying his lips to the worthy
old gentleman's benevolent forehead, the locksmith, who
had all this time been ravaging among the eatables,
kept them there so long, at the same time raising the
vessel slowly in the air, that at length Toby stood on his
head upon his nose, when he smacked his lips and set
him on the table again with fond reluctance.

Although Sim Tappertit had taken no share in this
conversation, no part of it being addressed to him, he
had not been wanting in such silent manifestations of
astonishment, as he deemed most compatible with the
favourable display of his eyes. Regarding the pause
which now ensued, as a particularly advantageous op-
portunity for doing great execution with them upon the
locksmith's daughter (who he had no doubt was looking
at him in mute admiration), he began to screw and twist
his face, and especially those features, into such extra-
ordinary, hideous, and unparalleled contortions, that
Gabriel, who happened to look towards him, was stricken
with amazement.
“Why, what the devil's the matter with the lad?” cried
the locksmith. “Is he choking?"
“Who?" demanded Sim, with some disdain.
“Who? why you,” returned his master. “What do
you mean by making those horrible faces over your
breakfast?"
“Faces are matters of taste, sir,” said Mr. Tappertit,
rather discomfited; not the less so because he saw the
locksmith's daughter smiling.
“Sim," rejoined Gabriel, laughing heartily. “Don't
be a fool, for I'd rather see you in your senses. These
young fellows,” he added, turning to his daughter, “ are
always committing some folly or another. There was a
quarrel between Joe Willet and old John last night-
though I can't say Joe was much in fault either. He'll
be missing one of these mornings, and will have gone
away on some wild goose errand, seeking his for-
tune. Why, what's the matter, Doll? You are making
faces now. The girls are as bad as the boys, every
bit!”
“It's the tea,” said Dolly, turning alternately very
red and very white, which is no doubt the effect of a
slight scald “ so very hot.”
Mr. Tappertit looked immensely big at a quartern
loaf on the table, and breathed hard.
“Is that all?" returned the locksmith. “Put some
more milk in it. Yes, I'm sorry for Joe, because he is a
likely young fellow, and gains upon one every time one
sees him. But he'll start off, you'll find. Indeed, he told
me as much himself!"
“Indeed!” cried Dolly, in a faint voice. “In-deed!”

“Is the tea tickling your throat still, my dear?” said
the locksmith.
But, before his daughter could make him any answer,
she was taken with a troublesome cough, and it was
such a very unpleasant cough that, when she left off,
the tears were starting in her bright eyes. The good-
natured locksmith was still patting her on the back and
applying such gentle restoratives, when a message ar-
rived from Mrs. Varden, making known to all whom it
might concern, that she felt too indisposed to rise after
her great agitation and anxiety of the previous night;
and therefore desired to be immediately accommodated
with the little black teapot of strong mixed tea, a couple
of rounds of buttered toast, a middling-sized dish of beef
and ham cut thin, and the Protestant Manual in two vol-
umes, post octavo. Like some other ladies who in re-
mote ages flourished upon this globe, Mrs. Varden was
most devout when most ill-tempered. Whenever she
and her husband were at unusual variance, then the
Protestant Manual was in high feather.
Knowing from experience what these requests por-
tended, the triumvirate broke up; Dolly, to see the
orders executed with all despatch; Gabriel, to some
out-of-door work in his little chaise; and Sim, to his
daily duty in the workshop, to which retreat he carried
the big look, although the loaf remained behind.
Indeed, the big look increased immensely, and when
he had tied his apron on, became quite gigantic. It
was not until he had several times walked up and down
with folded arms, and the longest strides he could take,
and had kicked a great many small articles out of his
way, that his lip began to curl. At length a gloomy
derision came over his features, and he smiled; uttering,
meanwhile, with supreme contempt, the monosyllable
“ Joe!”
“I eyed her over while he talked about the fellow,"
he said, “and that was of course the reason of her
being confused. Joe!”
He walked up and down again much quicker than
before, and if possible with longer strides, sometimes
stopping to take a glance at his legs and sometimes to
jerk out and cast from him another “ Joe!” In the
course of a quarter of an hour or so he again assumed the
paper cap and tried to work. No. It could not be done.

“I'll do nothing to-day,” said Mr. Tappertit, dashing
it down again, “but grind. I'll grind up all the tools.
Grinding will suit my present humour well. Joe!”
Whirr-r-r-r. The grindstone was soon in motion; the
sparks were flying off in showers. This was the occu-
pation for his heated spirit.
Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r.
“Something will come of this!” said Mr. Tappertit,
pausing as if in triumph, and wiping his heated face
upon his sleeve. “Something will come of this. I hope
it mayn't be human gore!"
Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r.
CHAPTER V.
As soon as the business of the day was over, the lock-
smith sallied forth, alone, to visit the wounded gentle-
man, and ascertain the progress of his recovery. The
house where he had left him was in a by-street in South-
wark, not far from London Bridge; and thither he hied
with all speed, bent upon returning with as little delay
as might be, and getting to bed betimes.
The evening was boisterous-scarcely better than the
previous night had been. It was not easy for a stout
man like Gabriel to keep his legs at the street corners, or
to make head against the high wind, which often fairly
got the better of him and drove him back some paces,
or, in defiance of all his energy, forced him to take
shelter in an arch or doorway until the fury of the gust
was spent. Occasionally a hat or wig, or both, came
spinning and trundling past him, like a mad thing;
while the more serious spectacle of falling tiles and
slates, or of masses of brick and mortar or fragments
of stone-coping rattling upon the pavement near at
hand, and splitting into fragments, did not increase the
pleasure of the journey, or make the way less dreary.
“A trying night for a man like me to walk in!” said
the locksmith, as he knocked softly at the widow's door.
“I'd rather be in old John's chimney corner, faith!”
"Who's there?" demanded a woman's voice from
within. Being answered, it added a hasty word of wel-
come, and the door was quickly opened.
She was about forty-perhaps two or three years

ol.der—with a cheerful aspect, and a face that had once
been pretty. It bore traces of affliction and care, but
they were of an old date, and Time had smoothed them.
Anyone who had bestowed but a casual glance on
Barnaby might have known that this was his mother,
from the strong resemblance between them; but where
in his face there was wildness and vacancy, in hers
there was the patient composure of long effort and quiet
resignation.
One thing about this face was very strange and
startling. You could not look upon it in its most cheer-
ful mood without feeling that it had some extraordinary
capacity of expressing terror. It was not on the sur-
face. It was in no one feature that it lingered. You
could not take the eyes, or mouth, or lines upon the
cheek, and say if this or that were otherwise, it would
not be so. Yet there it always lurked-something for-
ever dimly seen, but ever there, and never absent for a
moment. It was the faintest, palest shadow of some
look, to which an instant of intense and most unutter-
able horror only could have given birth; but indistinct
and feeble as it was, it did suggest what that look must
have been, and fixed it in the mind as if it had had ex-
istence in a dream.
More faintly imaged, and wanting force and purpose,
as it were, because of his darkened intellect, there was
this same stamp upon the son. Seen in a picture, it
must have had some legend with it, and would have
haunted those who looked upon the canvas. They who
knew the Maypole story, and could remember what the
widow was, before her husband's and his master's mur-
der, understood it well. They recollected how the change
had come, and could call to mind that when her son was
born, upon the very day the deed was known, he bore
upon his wrist what seemed a smear of blood but half
washed out.
“God save you, neighbour!” said the locksmith, as he
followed her, with the air of an old friend, into a little
parlour where a cheerful fire was burning.
“And you,” she answered, smiling. “Your kind
heart has brought you here again. Nothing will keep
you at home, I know of old, if there are friends to serve
or comfort, out of doors.”
“ Tut, tut," returned the locksmith, rubbing his hands

and warming them. “You women are such talkers.
What of the patient, neighbour?"
“He is sleeping now. He was very restless towards
daylight, and for some hours tossed and tumbled sadly.
But the fever has left him, and the doctor says he will
soon mend. He must not be removed until to-morrow."
“He has had visitors to-day-humph?” said Gabriel,
slily.
“Yes. Old Mr. Chester has been here ever since we
sent for him, and had not been gone many minutes when
you knocked.”
“No ladies ?” said Gabriel, elevating his eyebrows
and looking disappointed.
“A letter,” replied the widow.
“Come. That's better than nothing ;” cried the lock-
smith. “Who was the bearer ?"
“Barnaby, of course.”
“ Barnaby's a jewel !" said Varden, “and comes and
goes with ease where we who think ourselves much
wiser would make but a poor hand of it. He is not out
wandering again, I hope."
“Thank Heaven, he is in his bed, having been up all
night, as you know, and on his feet all day. He was
quite tired out. Ah, neighbour, if I could but see him
oftener so—if I could but tame down that terrible rest-
lessness”
“In good time," said the locksmith, kindly, “in good
time-don't be down-hearted. To my mind, he grows
wiser every day.”
The widow shook her head. And yet, though she
knew the locksmith sought to cheer her, and spoke from
no conviction of his own, she was glad to hear even
this praise of her poor benighted son.
“He will be a'cute man yet.” resumed the locksmith.
"Take care, when we are growing old and foolish,
Barnaby doesn't put us to the blush, that's all. But our
other friend,” he added, looking under the table and
about the floor—“sharpest and cunningest of all the
sharp and cunning ones—where's he ?”
“In Barnaby's room,” rejoined the widow, with a
faint smile.
“Ah! He's a knowing blade!” said Varden, shaking
his head. “I should be sorry to talk secrets before him.
Oh ! he's a deep customer; I've no doubt he can read,

and write, and cast accounts, if he chooses. What was
that-him tapping at the door?”
“No," returned the widow. “It was in the street, I
think. Hark! Yes. There again ! 'Tis some one
knocking softly at the shutter. Who can it be?”
They had been speaking in a low tone, for the invalid
lay overhead, and the walls and ceilings being thin and
poorly built, the sound of their voices might otherwise
have disturbed his slumber! The party without, who-
ever it was, could have stood close to the shutter without
hearing anything spoken ; and, seeing the light through
the chinks and finding all so quiet, might have been
persuaded that only one person was there.
“Some thief or ruffian, may be,” said the locksmith.
“Give me the light.”
“No, no,” she returned, hastily. “Such visitors have
never come to this poor dwelling. Do you stay here.
You're within call at the worst. I would rather go my-
self—alone.”
“Why?” said the locksmith, unwillingly relinquish-
ing the candle he had caught up from the table.
“Because I don't know why-because the wish is
strong upon me,” she rejoined. “There again-do not
detain me, I beg of you!"
Gabriel looked at her in great surprise to see one who
was usually so mild and quiet thus agitated, and with
so little cause. She left the room and closed the door
behind her. She stood for a moment as if hesitating,
with her hand upon the lock. In this short interval the
knocking came again, and a voice close to the window
-a voice the locksmith seemed to recollect, and to have
some disagreeable association with-whispered, “Make
haste.
The words were uttered in that low, distinct voice
which finds its way so readily to sleepers' ears, and
wakes them in a fright. For a moment it startled even
the locksmith; who involuntarily drew back from the
window and listened.
The wind rumbling in the chimney made it difficult to
hear what passed, but he could tell that the door was
opened, that there was the tread of a man upon the
creaking boards, and then a moment's silence-broken
by a suppressed something which was not a shriek, or
groan, or cry for help, and yet might have been either

or all three; and the words “My God!” uttered in a
voice it chilled him to hear.
He rushed out upon the instant. There, at last, was
that dreadful look-the very one he seemed to know so
well and yet had never seen before-upon her face.
There she stood, frozen to the ground, gazing with
starting eyes, and livid cheeks, and every feature fixed
and ghastly, upon the man he had encountered in the
dark last night. His eyes met those of the locksmith.
It was but a flash, an instant, a breath upon a polished
glass, and he was gone.
Thé locksmith was upon him-had the skirts of his
streaming garment almost in his grasp—when his arms
were tightly clutched, and the widow flung herself upon
the ground before him.
“ The other way-the other way," she cried. “He
went the other way. Turn-turn!”
“The other way! I see him now," rejoined the lock-
smith, pointing-“yonder-there-there is his shadow
passing by that light. What—who is this? Let me go.”
“Come back, come back !” exclaimed the woman,
clasping him; "do not touch him on your life. I charge
you, come back. He carries other lives besides his own.
Come back!”
“What does this mean?” cried the locksmith.
“No matter what it means, don't ask, don't speak,
don't think about it. He is not to be followed, checked,
or stopped. Come back!”
The old man looked at her in wonder, as she writhed
and clung about him; and borne down by her passion,
suffered her to drag him into the house. It was not
until she had chained and double-locked the door, fast-
ened every bolt and bar with the heat and fury of a
maniac, and drawn him back into the room, that she
turned upon him, once again, that stony look of horror,
and sinking down into a chair, covered her face, and
shuddered, as though the hand of death were on her.

CHAPTER VI.
BEYOND all measure astonished by the strange occur-
rences which had passed with so much violence and
rapidity, the locksmith gazed upon the shuddering fig-
ure in the chair like one half stupefied, and would have
gazed much longer, had not his tongue been loosened by
compassion and humanity.
“Ỹou are ill,” said Gabriel. “Let me call some neigh-
bour in."
“Not for the world,” she rejoined, motioning to him
with her trembling hand, and still holding her face
averted. “It is enough that you have been by, to see
this."
“Nay, more than enough-or less," said Gabriel.
“Be it so,” she returned. As you like. Ask me no
questions, I entreat you.”
“Neighbour,” said the locksmith, after a pause. “Is
this fair, or reasonable, or just to yourself? Is it like
you, who have known me so long and sought my advice
in all matters like you, who from a girl have had a
strong mind and a staunch heart?"
"I have had need of them,” she replied. “I am grow-
ing old, both in years and care. Perhaps that, and too
much trial, have made them weaker than they used to
be. Do not speak to me.”
“How can I see what I have seen, and hold my peace?”
returned the locksmith. “Who was that man, and why
has his coming made this change in you?”
She was silent, but held to the chair as though to save
herself from falling on the ground.
“I take the licence of an old acquaintance, Mary,"
said the locksmith, “who has ever had a warm regard
for you, and maybe has tried to prove it when he could.
Who is this ill-favoured man, and what has he to do
with you? Who is this ghost, that is only seen in the
black nights and bad weather? How does he know, and
why does he haunt this house, whispering through
chinks and crevices, as if there was that between him
and you, which neither durst so much as speak aloud of?
Who is he?"

“You do well to say he haunts this house,” returned
the widow, faintly. "His shadow has been upon it
and me, in light and darkness, at noonday and at
midnight. And now, at last, he has come in the
body!"
“But he couldn't have gone in the body,” returned the
locksmith, with some irritation, “if you had left my
arms and legs at liberty. What riddle is it?".
“ It is one,” she answered, rising as she spoke, “that
must remain forever as it is. I dare not say more than
that."
“Dare not!" repeated the wondering locksmith.
“Do not press me,” she replied. “I am sick and faint,
and every faculty of life seems dead within me. No!
Do not touch me either.”
Gabriel, who had stepped forward to render her assist-
ance, fell back as she made this hasty exclamation, and
regarded her in silent wonder.
“Let me go my way alone,” she said, in a low voice,
“ and let the hands of no honest man touch mine to-
night.” When she had tottered to the door, she turned,
and added with a stronger effort, “This is a secret,
which, of necessity, I trust to you. You are a true man.
As you have ever been good and kind to me-keep it.
If any noise was heard above, make some excuse-say
anything but what you really saw, and never let a word
or look between us recall this circumstance. I trust to
you. Mind, I trust to you. How much I trust, you
never can conceive.”
Casting her eyes upon him for an instant, she with-
drew, and left him there alone.
Gabriel, not knowing what to think, stood staring at
the door with a countenance full of surprise and dismay.
The more he pondered on what had passed, the less able
he was to give it any favourable interpretation. To
find this widow woman, whose life for so many years
had been supposed to be one of solitude and retirement,
and who, in her quiet suffering character, had gained
the good opinion and respect of all who knew her—to
find her linked mysteriously with an ill-omened man,
alarmed at his appearance, and yet favouring his es-
cape, was a discovery that pained as much as it startled
him. Her reliance on his secrecy, and his tacit acquies-
cence, increased his distress of mind. If he had spoken

boldly, persisted in questioning her, detained her when
she rose to leave the room, made any kind of protest,
instead of silently compromising himself, as he felt he
had done, he would have been more at ease.
“Why did I let her say it was a secret, and she trusted
it to me!” said Gabriel, putting his wig on one side to
scratch his head with greater ease, and looking ruefully
at the fire. “I have no more readiness than old John
himself. Why didn't I say firmly, 'You have no right
to such secrets, and I demand of you to tell me
what this means,' instead of standing gaping at her,
like an old mooncalf as I am! But there's my weakness.
I can be obstinate enough with men if need be, but
women may twist me round their fingers at their
pleasure.”
He took his wig off outright as he made this declara-
tion, and, warming his handkerchief at the fire, began to
rub and polish his bald head with it, until it glistened
again.
- And yet,” said the locksmith, softening under this
soothing process, and stopping to smile, “ it may be noth-
ing. Any drunken brawler trying to make his way into
the house, would have alarmed a quiet soul like her. But
then”—and here was the vexation—“how came it to be
that man; how comes he to have this influence over her;
how came she to favour his getting away from me; and,
more than all, how came she not to say it was a sudden
fright, and nothing more? It's a sad thing to have, in
one minute, reason to mistrust a person I have known so
long, and an old sweetheart into the bargain: but what
else can I do, with all this upon my mind!-Is that Bar-
naby outside there?”.
“Ay!” he cried, looking in and nodding. “Sure enough
it's Barnaby-how did you guess?”
“By your shadow," said the locksmith.
“Oho!” cried Barnaby, glancing over his shoulder.
“He's a merry fellow, that shadow, and keeps close to
me, though I am silly. We have such pranks, such
walks, such runs, such gambols on the grass! Sometimes
he'll be half as tall as a church steeple, and sometimes no
bigger than a dwarf. Now, he goes on before, and now
behind, and anon he'll be stealing slily on, on this side, or
on that, stopping whenever I stop, and thinking I can't
see him, though I have my eye on him sharp enough.

Oh! he's a merry fellow. Tell me-is he silly too! I
think he is.”
66 Why?” asked Gabriel.
“Because he never tires of mocking me, but does it all
day long.–Why don't you come?”
* Where?”
“Up stairs. He wants you. Stay-where's his
shadow ? Come. You ’re a wise man; tell me that."
“Beside him, Barnaby; beside him, I suppose,” re-
turned the locksmith.
“No!” he replied, shaking his head. “Guess again.”
“ Gone out a walking, maybe?”
“ He has changed shadows with a woman,” the idiot
whispered in his ear, and then fell back with a look of
triumph. “Her shadow's always with him, and his
with her. That's sport, I think, eh?”
“ Barnaby,” said the locksmith, with a grave look;
- come hither, lad.”
“I know what you want to say. I know!” he replied,
keeping away from him. “But I'm cunning, I'm silent.
I only say so much to you-are you ready?” As he
spoke, he caught up the light, and waved it with a wild
laugh above his head.
“Softly-gently,” said the locksmith, exerting all his
influence to keep him calm and quiet. “I thought you
had been asleep,”
“So I have been asleep,” he rejoined, with widely-
opened eyes. “There have been great faces coming and
going—close to my face, and then a mile away-low
places to creep through, whether I would or no-high
churches to fall down from-strange creatures crowded
up together neck and heels, to sit upon the bed—that's
sleep, eh?”
“Dreams, Barnaby, dreams," said the locksmith.
“Dreams!” he echoed, softly, drawing closer to him.
“Those are not dreams.”
“What are,” replied the locksmith, “if they are
not?"
“I dreamed,” said Barnaby, passing his arm through
Varden's, and peering close into his face as he answered
in a whisper, “I dreamed just now that something-it
was in the shape of a man-followed me-came softlv
after me—wouldn't let me be—but was always hiding and
crouching, like a cat in dark corners, waiting till I should

pass; when it crept out and came softly after me. Did
you ever see me run?”
“Many a time, you know.”
“You never saw me run as I did in this dream. Still
it came creeping on to worry me. Nearer, nearer,
nearer-I ran faster-leaped-sprang out of bed, and to
the window-and there, in the street below—but he is
waiting for us. Are you coming?”.
“What in the street below, Barnaby?” said Varden,
imagining that he traced some connexion between this
vision and what had actually occurred.
Barnaby looked into his face, muttered incoherently,
waved the light above his head again, laughed, and,
drawing the locksmith's arm more tightly through his
own, led him up the stairs in silence.
They entered a homely bedchamber, garnished in a
scanty way with chairs whose spindle-shanks bespoke
their age, and other furniture of very little worth; but
clean and neatly kept. Reclining in an easy chair be-
fore the fire, pale and weak from loss of blood, was Ed-
ward Chester, the young gentleman who had been the
first to quit the Maypole on the previous night, and who,
extending his hand to the locksmith, welcomed him as
his preserver and friend.
“Say no more, sir, say no more,” said Gabriel. “I hope
I would have done at least as much for any man in such
a strait, and most of all for you, sir. A certain young
lady,” he added, with some hesitation, “has done us
many a kind turn, and we naturally feel-I hope I give
you no offence in saying this, sir?"
The young man smiled and shook his head; at the
same time moving in his chair as if in pain.
“It's no great matter," he said, in answer to the lock-
smith's sympathising look, “a mere uneasiness arising
at least as much from being cooped up here, as from the
slight wound I have, or from the loss of blood. Be
seated, Mr. Varden.”
“If I may make so bold, Mr. Edward, as to lean upon
your chair," returned the locksmith, accommodating his
action to his speech, and bending over him, “I'll stand
here, for the convenience of speaking low. Barnaby is
not in his quietest humour to-night, and at such times
talking never does him good.”
They both glanced at the subject of this remark, who

ito Lomogok mebehind the lo
had taken a seat on the other side of the fire, and,
smiling vacantly, was making puzzles on his fingers
with a skein of string.
“Pray, tell me, sir,” said Varden, dropping his voice
still lower, “exactly what happened last night. I
have my reason for inquiring. You left the Maypole
alone?”
“ And walked homeward alone, until I had nearly
reached the place where you found me, when I heard the
gallop of a horse.”
“-Behind you?” said the locksmith.
“Indeed, yes-behind me. It was a single rider, who
soon overtook me, and checking his horse, inquired the
way to London.”
“You were on the alert, sir, knowing how many high-
waymen there are, scouring the roads in all directions?"
said Varden.
“I was, but I had only a stick, having imprudently left
my pistols in their holster-case with the landlord's son.
I directed him as he desired. Before the words had
passed my lips, he rode upon me furiously, as if bent on
trampling me down beneath his horse's hoofs. In start-
ing aside, I slipped and fell. You found me with this
stab and an ugly bruise or two, and without my purse-
in which he found little enough for his pains. And
now, Mr. Varden,” he added, shaking the locksmith by
the hand, “saving the extent of my gratitude to you,
you know as much as I.”
“Except,” said Gabriel, bending down yet more, and
looking cautiously towards their silent neighbour, “ex-
cept in respect of the robber himself. What like was he,
sir? Speak low, if you please. Barnaby means no
harm, but I have watched him oftener than you, and I
know, little as you would think it, that he's listening
now.”
It required a strong confidence in the locksmith's
veracity to lead any one to this belief, for every sense
and faculty that Barnaby possessed seemed to be fixed
upon his game, to the exclusion of all other things.
Something in the young man's face expressed this
opinion, for Gabriel repeated what he had just said,
more earnestly than before, and with another glance
towards Barnaby, again asked what like the man was.
“The night was so dark,” said Edward, “the attack

So sudden, and he so wrapped and muffled up, that I can
hardly say. It seems that
“Don't mention his name, sir," returned the lock-
smith, following his look towards Barnaby; “I know he
saw him. I want to know what you saw."
“All I remember is,” said Edward, “that as he checked
his horse his hat was blown off. He caught it and re-
placed it on his head, which I observed was bound with
a dark handkerchief. A stranger entered the Maypole
while I was there, whom I had not seen-for I sat apart
for reasons of my own—and when I rose to leave the
room and glanced round, he was in the shadow of the
chimney and hidden from my sight. But, if he and the
robber were two different persons, their voices were
strangely and most remarkably alike; for directly the
man addressed me in the road, I recognized his speech
again.”
“It is as I feared. The very man was here to-night,”
thought the locksmith, changing colour. “What dark
history is this!"
“Halloa !” cried a hoarse voice in his ear. “Halloa,
halloa, halloa ! Bow Wow wow. What's the matter
here!' Hal-loa!”
The speaker—who made the locksmith start, as if he
had seen some supernatural agent—was a large raven,
who had perched upon the top of the easy-chair, unseen
by him and Edward, and listened with a polite attention
and a most extraordinary appearance of comprehending
every word, to all they had said up to this point; turn-
ing his head from one to the other, as if his office were
to judge between them, and it were of the very last im-
portance that he should not lose a word.
“Look at him!” said Varden, divided between admir-
ation of the bird and a kind of fear of him. “Was there
ever such a knowing imp asthat! Oh, he's a dreadful
fellow!”
The raven, with his head very much on one side, and
his bright eye shining like a diamond, preserved a
thoughtful silence for a few seconds, and then replied
in a voice so hoarse and distant, that it seemed to come
through his thick feathers rather than out of his mouth.
“Halloa, halloa, halloa ! What's the matter here!
Keep up your spirits. Never say die. Bow wow wow.
I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil. Hurrah !” And

" . I more do," said what I was himself on
then, as if exulting in his infernal character, he began
to whistle.
“I more than half believe he speaks the truth. Upon
my word I do,” said Varden. “Do you see how he looks
at me, as if he knew what I was saying?”
To which the bird, balancing himself on tiptoe, as it
were, and moving his body up and down, in a sort of
grave dance, rejoined, “I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a
devil,” and flapped his wings against his sides as if he
were bursting with laughter. Barnaby clapped his
hands, and fairly rolled upon the ground in an ecstacy
of delight.
“Strange companions, sir,” said the locksmith, shak-
ing his head and looking from one to the other. “The
bird has all the wit.”
“Strange indeed!” said Edward, holding out his fore-
finger to the raven, who, in acknowledgment of the
attention, made a dive at it immediately with his iron
bill. “Is he old?”
“A mere boy, sir," replied the locksmith. “A hundred
and twenty, or thereabouts. Call him down, Barnaby,
my man.”
“Call him!” echoed Barnaby, sitting upright upon the
floor, and staring vacantly at Gabriel, as he thrust his
his hair back from his face. “But who can make him
come! He calls me, and makes me go where he will.
He goes on before, and I follow. He's the master, and
I'm the man. Is that the truth, Grip?”
The raven gave a short, comfortable, confidential kind
of croak-a most expressive croak, which seemed to say,
“ You needn't let these fellows into our secrets. We
understand each other. It's all right.”
“I make him come?" cried Barnaby, pointing to the
bird. “Him, who never goes to sleep, or so much as
winks! Why, any time of night, you may see his eyes
in my dark room, shining like two sparks. And every
night, and all night too, he's broad awake, talking to
himself, thinking what he shall do to-morrow, where
we shall go, and what he shall steal, and hide, and bury.
I make him come! Ha, ha, ha!”
On second thoughts, the bird appeared disposed to
come of himself. After a short survey of the ground,
and a few sidelong looks at the ceiling and at everybody
present in turn, he fluttered to the floor, and went to

Barnaby-not in a hop, or walk, or run, but in a pace
like that of a very particular gentleman with exceed-
ingly tight boots on, trying to walk fast over loose peb-
bles. Then, stepping into his extended hand, and con-
descending to be held out at arm's length, he gave vent
to a succession of sounds, not unlike the drawing of
some eight or ten dozen of long corks, and again as-
serted his brimstome birth and parentage with great
distinctness.
The locksmith shook his head-perhaps in some doubt
of the creature's being really nothing but a bird-per-
haps in pity for Barnaby, who by this time had him in
his arms, and was rolling about with him on the ground.
As he raised his eyes from the poor fellow he en-
countered those of his mother, who had entered the
room, and was looking on in silence.
She was quite white in the face, even to her lips, but
had wholly subdued her emotion, and wore her usual
quiet look. Varden fancied as he glanced at her that
she shrunk from his eye! and that she busied herself
about the wounded gentleman to avoid him the better.
It was time he went to bed, she said. He was to be
removed to his own home on the morrow, and he had
already exceeded his time for sitting up, by a full hour.
Acting on this hint, the locksmith prepared to take his
leave.
“By-the-bye,” said Edward, as he shook him by the
hand, and looked from him to Mrs. Rudge and back
again, " what noise was that below? I heard your voice
in the midst of it, and should have inquired before, but
our other conversation drove it from my memory.
What was it?”
The locksmith looked towards her and bit his lip.
She leant against the chair and bent her eyes upon the
ground. Barnaby, too—he was listening.
-“Some mad or drunken fellow, sir,” Varden at
length made answer, looking steadily at the window as
he spoke. “He mistook the house and tried to force an
entrance.”
She breathed more freely, but stood quite motionless.
As the locksmith said “Good-night," and Barnaby
caught up the candle to light him down the stairs, she
took it from him, and charged him—with more haste
and earnestness than so slight an occasion appeared to

warrant-not to stir. The raven followed them to satisfy
himself that all was right below, and when they reached
the street-door, stood on the bottom stair drawing corks
out of number.
With a trembling hand she unfastened the chain and
bolts and turned the key. As she had her hand upon
the latch, the locksmith said in a low voice :
“I have told a lie to-night, for your sake, Mary, and
for the sake of bygone times and old acquaintance,
when I would scorn to do so for my own. I hope I may
have done no harm, or led to none. I can't help the .
suspicions you have forced upon me, and I am loth, I
tell you plainly, to leave Mr. Edward here. Take care
he comes to no hurt. I doubt the safety of this roof,
and am glad he leaves it so soon. Now let me go.”
For a moment she hid her face in her hands and wept;
but resisting the strong impulse which evidently moved
her to reply, opened the door-no wider than was suffi.
cient for the passage of his body-and motioned him
away. As the locksmith stood upon the step, it was
chained and locked behind him, and the raven, in fur-
therance of these precautions, barked like a lusty house-
dog.
* In league with that ill-looking figure that might
have fallen from a gibbet-he listening and hiding here
-Barnaby first upon the spot last night-can she who
has always borne so fair a name be guilty of such crimes
in secret!” said the locksmith, musing. “Heaven for-
give me if I am wrong, and send me just thoughts; but
she is poor, the temptation may be great, and we daily
hear of things as strange. Ay, bark away, my friend.
If there's any wickedness going on, that raven's in it,
I'll be sworn."

CHAPTER VII.
MRS. VARDEN was a lady of what is commonly called
an uncertain temper—a phrase which being interpreted
signifies a temper tolerably certain to make everybody
more or less uncomfortable. Thus it generally happened,
that when other people were merry, Mrs. Varden was
dull; and that when other people were dull, Mrs. Varden
was disposed to be amazingly cheerful. Indeed the
worthy housewife was of such a capricious nature, and
she not only attained a higher pitch of genius than Mac-
beth, in respect of her ability to be wise, amazed, tem-
perate and furious, loyal and neutral in an instant, but
would sometimes ring the changes backwards and for-
wards on all possible moods and flights in one short
quarter of an hour; performing, as it were, a kind of
triple bob major on the peal of instruments in the female
belfry, with a skilfulness and rapidity of execution that
astonished all who heard her.
It had been observed in this good lady (who did not
want for personal attractions, being plump and buxom
to look at, though like her fair daughter, somewhat short
in stature) that this uncertainty of disposition strength-
ened and increased with her temporal prosperity; and
divers wise men and matrons on friendly terms with the
locksmith and his family, even went so far as to assert,
that a tumble-down some half-dozen rounds in the
world's ladder-such as the breaking of the bank in which
her husband kept his money, or some little fall of that
kind—would be the making of her, and could hardly
fail to render her one of the most agreeable companions
in existence. Whether they were right or wrong in this
conjecture, certain it is that minds, like bodies, will
often fall into a pimpled, ill-conditioned state from mere
excess of comfort, and like them, are often successfully
cured by remedies in themselves very nauseous and un-
palatable.
Mrs. Varden's chief aider and abettor, and at the same
time her principal victim and object of wrath, was her
single domestic servant, one Miss Miggs; or as she was
called, in conformity with those prejudices of society

which lop and top from poor handmaidens all such gen-
teel excrescenses—Miggs. This Miggs was a tall young
lady, very much addicted to pattens in private life; slen-
der and shrewish, of a rather uncomfortable figure, and
though not absolutely ill-looking, of a sharp and acid
visage. As a general principle and abstract proposition,
Miggs held the male sex to be utterly contemptible and
unworthy of notice; to be fickle, false, base, sottish,
inclined to perjury, and wholly undeserving. When
particularly exasperated against them (which, scandal
said, was when Sim Tappertit slighted her most) she
was accustomed to wish with great emphasis that the
whole race of women could but die off, in order that the
men might be brought to know the real value of
the blessings by which they set so little store; nay, her
feeling for her order ran so high that she sometimes de-
clared, if she could only have good security for a fair,
round number-say ten thousand-of young virgins fol-
lowing her example, she would, to spite mankind, hang,
drown, stab, or poison herself, with a joy past all ex-
pression.
It was the voice of Miggs that greeted the locksmith
when he knocked at his own house, with a shrill cry of
“Who's there?”
“ Me, girl, me,” returned Gabriel.
“What, already, sir!" said Miggs, opening the door
with a look of surprise. “We were just getting on our
nightcaps to sit up-me and mistress. Oh, she has been
so bad!”
Miggs said this with an air of uncommon candour and
concern; but the parlour-door was standing open, and
as Gabriel very well knew for whose ears it was designed,
he regarded her with anything but an approving look
as he passed in.
“Master's come home, mim,” cried Miggs, running
before him into the parlour. “You was wrong, mim,
and I was right. I thought he wouldn't keep us up so
late two nights running, mim. Master's always consid-
erate so far. I'm so glad, mim, on your account. I'm
a little”–here Miggs simpered—“a little sleepy myself;
I'll own it now, mim, though I said I wasn't when
you asked me. It ain't of no consequence, mim, of
course.”
“You had better," said the locksmith, who most de-

voutly wished that Barnaby's raven was at Miggs'ankles,
“ you had better get to bed at once then."
“Thanking you kindly, sir,” returned Miggs, “I
couldn't take my rest in peace, nor fix my thoughts upon
my prayers, otherwise than that I knew mistress was
comfortable in her bed this night; by rights she should
have been there hours ago.”
“You're talkative, mistress,” said Varden, pulling off
his great coat, and looking at her askew.
“Taking the hint, sir,” cried Miggs, with a flushed
face, “and thanking you for it most kindly, I will make
bold to say, that if I give offense by having considera-
tion for my mistress, I do not ask your pardon, but
am content to get myself into trouble and to be in suf-
fering.”
Here Mrs. Varden, who with her countenance shrouded
in a large nightcap, had been all this time intent upon
the Protestant Manual, looked round, and acknowledged
Miggs' championship by commanding her to hold her
tongue.
Every little bone in Miggs' throat and neck developed
itself with a spitefulness quite alarming, as she replied,
“ Yes, mim, I will."
“How do you find yourself now, my dear ?" said the
locksmith, taking a chair near his wife (who had re-
sumed her book), and rubbing his knees hard as he
made the inquiry :
“You're very anxious to know, an't you?” returned
Mrs. Varden, with her eyes upon the print. “You, that
have not been near me all day, and wouldn't have been
if I was dying !”
“My dear Martha,” said Gabriel.
Mrs. Varden turned over to the next page; then went
back again to the bottom line over leaf to be quite sure
of the last words, and then went on reading with an ap-
pearance of the deepest interest and study.
“My dear Martha,” said the locksmith,“ how can you
say such things, when you know you don't mean them?
If you were dying! Why, if there was anything seri-
ous the matter with you, Martha, shouldn't I be in con-
stant attendance upon you?”
“Yes!” cried Mrs. Varden, bursting into tears, " yes,
you would. I don't doubt it, Varden. Certainly you
would. That's as much as to tell me that you would be

hovering round me like a vulture, waiting till the breath
was out of my body, that you might go and marry some-
body else.”
Miggs groaned in sympathy-a little, short groan,
checked in its birth, and changed into a cough. It
seemed to say, “I can't help it. It's wrung from me by
the dreadful brutality of that monster master.”
“But you'll break my heart one of these days," added
Mrs. Varden, with more resignation," and then we shall
both be happy. My only desire is to see Dolly comfort-
ably settled, and when she is, you may settle me as
soon as you like.”
“Ah!” cried Miggs—and coughed again.
Poor Gabriel twisted his wig about in silence for a
long time, and then said, mildly, “ Has Dolly gone to
bed?"
“Your master speaks to you,” said Mrs. Varden, look-
ing sternly over her shoulder at Miss Miggs in waiting.
"No, my dear, I spoke to you,” suggested the lock-
smith.
“Did you hear me, Miggs?” cried the obdurate lady,
stamping her foot upon the ground. “You are beginn-
ing to despise me now, are you? But this is example!"
At this cruel rebuke, Miggs, whose tears were always
ready, for large or small parties, on the shortest notice
and the most reasonable terms, fell a crying violently;
holding both her hands tight upon her heart meanwhile,
as if nothing less would prevent its splitting into small
fragments. Mrs. Varden, who likewise, possessed that
faculty in high perfection, wept too, against Miggs; and
with such effect that Miggs gave in after a time,
and except for an occasional sob, which seemed to
threaten some remote intention of breaking out again,
left her mistress in possession of the field. Her supe-
riority being thoroughly asserted, that lady soon desisted
likewise, and fell into a quiet melancholy.
The relief was so great, and the fatiguing occurrences
of last night so completely overpowered the locksmith,
that he nodded in his chair, and would doubtless have
slept there all night, but for the voice of Mrs. Varden,
which, after a pause of some five minutes, awoke him
with a start.
“If I am ever,” said Mrs. V.-not scolding, but in a
sort of monotonous remonstrance—“in spirits, if I am

ever cheerful, if I am ever more than usually disposed
to be talkative and comfortable, this is the way I am
treated.”
“Such spirits as you was in too, mim, but half an
hour ago!” cried Miggs. “I never see such company!”
“Because,” said Mrs. Varden, “because I never in-
terfere or interrupt, because I never question where
anybody comes or goes; because my whole mind and
soul is bent on saving where I can save, and labouring
in this house_therefore, they try me as they do.”
“ Martha,” urged the locksmith, endeavouring to look
as wakeful as possible, “what is it you complain of ? I
really came home with every wish and desire to be
happy. I did indeed.”
What do I complain of!" retorted his wife. "Is it a
chilling thing to have one's husband sulking and fall-
ing asleep directly he comes home-to have him freez-
ing all one's warm-heartedness, and throwing cold
water over the fireside ? Is it natural, when I knew he
went out upon a matter in which I am as much in-
terested as anybody can be, that I should wish to know
all that has happened, or that he should tell me without
my begging and praying him to do it? Is that natural,
or is it not ?”
“I am very sorry, Martha," said the good-natured
locksmith. “I was really afraid you were not disposed
to talk pleasantly; I'll tell you everything; I shall only
be too glad, my dear.”
“No, Varden,” returned his wife, rising with dignity.
“I dare say—thank you! I'm not a child to be cor-
rected one minute and petted the next-I'm a little too
old for that, Varden. Miggs, carry the light. You can
be cheerful, Miggs, at least.”
Miggs, who, to this moment, had been in the very
depths of compassionate despondency, passed instantly
into the liveliest state conceivable, and tossing her head
as she glanced towards the locksmith, bore off her mis-
tress and the light together.
“Now who would think,” thought Varden, shrugging
his shoulders and drawing his chair nearer to the fire,
“that that woman could ever be pleasant and agreeable?
And yet she can be. Well, well, all of us have our
faults. I'll not be hard upon hers, We have been man
and wife too long for that,”?

BARNABY RUDGE.
He dozed again-not the less pleasantly, perhaps, for
his hearty temper. While his eyes were closed, the door
leading to the upper stairs was partly opened; and a head
appeared, which at sight of him hastily drew back again.
“I wish, murmured Gabriel, waking at the noise, and
looking round the room, “I wish somebody would
marry Miggs. But that's impossible ! I wonder whether
there's any madman alive who would marry Miggs!”
This was such a vast speculation that he fell into a
doze again, and slept until the fire was quite burnt out.
At last he roused himself; and having double-locked the
street-door according to custom, and put the key in his
pocket, went off to bed.
He had not left the room in darkness many minutes
when the head again appeared, and Sim Tappertit en-
tered, bearing in his hand a little lamp.
“What the devil business has he to stop up so late!"
muttered Sim, passing into the workshop, and setting it
down upon the forge. “Here's half the night gone
already. There's only one good that has ever come to
me, out of this cursed old rusty mechanical trade, and
that's this piece of ironmongery, upon my soul!”
As he spoke, he drew from the right hand, or rather
right leg pocket of his smalls, a clumsy large-sized key,
which he inserted cautiously in the lock his master had
secured, and softly opened the door. That done, he re-
placed his piece of secret workmanship in his pocket;
and leaving the lamp burning, and closing the door care-
fully and without noise, stole out into the street-as little
suspected by the locksmith in his sound, deep sleep, as by
Barnaby limself in his phantom-haunted dreams.

CHAPTER VIII.
CLEAR of the locksmith's house, Sim Tappertit laid
aside his cautious manner, and assuming in its stead
that of a ruffling, swaggering, roving blade, who would
rather kill a man than otherwise, and eat him too if
needful, made the best of his way along the darkened
streets.
Half pausing for an instant now and then to smite his
pocket and assure himself of the safety of his master
key, he hurried on to Barbican, and turning into one of
the narrowest of the narrow streets which diverged from
that centre, slackened his pace and wiped his heated
brow, as if the termination of his walk were near at
hand.
It was not a very choice spot for midnight expeditions,
being in truth one of more than questionable character,
and of an appearance by no means inviting. From the
main street he had entered, itself little better than an
alley, a low-browed doorway led into a blind court or
yard, profoundly dark, unpaved, and reeking with stag-
nant odours. Into this ill-favoured pit the locksmith's
vagrant 'prentice groped his way, and stopping at a
house from whose defaced and rotten front the rude
effigy of a bottle swung to and fro like some gibbeted
malefactor, struck thrice upon an iron grating with his
foot. After listening in vain for some response to his
signal, Mr. Tappertit became impatient, and struck the
grating thrice again.
A further delay ensued, but it was not of long dura-
tion. The ground seemed to open at his feet, and a
ragged head appeared.
* Is that the captain ?” said a voice as ragged as the
head.
“Yes,” replied Mr. Tappertit, haughtily, descending
as he spoke, “who should it be ?”
“It's so late, we gave you up," returned the voice, as
its owner stopped to shut and fasten the grating. “You're
late, sir.”
“ Lead on,” said Mr. Tappertit, with a gloomy ma-

jesty, “and make remarks when I require you. For-
ward!”
This latter word of command was perhaps somewhat
theatrical and unnecessary, inasmuch as the descent
was by a very narrow, steep, and slippery flight of
steps, and any rashness or departure from the beaten
track must have ended in a yawning water-butt. But
Mr. Tappertit being like some other great commanders,
favourable to strong effects, and personal display, cried
“Forward!" again, in the hoarsest voice he could as-
sume; and led the way, with folded arms and knitted
brows, to the cellar down below, where there was a
small copper fixed in one corner, a chair or two, a form
and table, a glimmering fire, and a truckle-bed, covered
with a ragged patchwork rug.
“Welcome, noble captain!" cried a lanky figure, rising
as from a nap.
The captain nodded. Then, throwing off his outer
coat, he stood composed in all his dignity, and eyed his
follower over. .
“What news to-night?” he asked, when he had looked
into his very soul.
“Nothing particular,” replied the other, stretching
himself—and he was so long already that it was quite
alarming to see him do it-“how come you to be so
late?"
“No matter," was all the captain deigned to say in
answer. “Is the room prepared?"
“ It is,” replied his follower.
“The comrade—is he here?”
“Yes. And a sprinkling of the others — you hear
'em?"
"Playing skittles!” said the captain, moodily. “Light-
hearted revellers!”
There was no doubt respecting the particular amuse-
ment in which these heedless spirits were indulging, for
even in the close and stifling atmosphere of the vault,
the noise sounded like distant thunder. It certainly ap-
peared, at first sight, a singular spot to choose, for that
or any other purpose of relaxation, if the other cellars
answered to the one in which this brief colloquy took
place; for the floors were of sodden earth, the walls and
roof of damp bare brick tapestried with the tracks of
snails and slugs; the air was sickening, tainted, and

offensive. It seemed from one strong flavour which was
uppermost among the various odours of the place, that it
had, at no very distant period, been used as a storehouse
for cheeses; a circumstance which, while it accounted
for the greasy moisture that hung about it, was agree-
ably suggestive of rats. It was naturally damp besides,
and little trees of fungus sprung from every mouldering
corner.
The proprietor of this charming retreat and owner of
the ragged head before mentioned-for he wore an old
tie-wig as bare and frouzy as a stunted hearth-broom--
had by this time joined them; and stood a little apart,
rubbing his hands, wagging his hoary bristled chin, and
smiling in silence. His eyes were closed; but had they
been wide open it would have been easy to tell, from the
attentive expression of the face he turned towards them
-pale and unwholesome as might be expected in one of
his underground existence—and from a certain anxious
raising and quivering of the lids, that he was blind.
“Even Stagg hath been asleep,” said the long comrade,
nodding towards this person.
“Sound, captain, sound!” cried the blind man; “what
does my noble captain drink-is it brandy, rum, usque-
baugh? Is it soaked gunpowder or blazing oil? Give it
a name, heart of oak, and we'd get it for you, if it was
wine from a bishop's cellar, or melted gold from King
George's mint.”
“See,” said Mr. Tappertit, haughtily, “ that it's some-
thing strong, and comes quick; and so long as you take
care of that, you may bring it from the devil's cellar if
you like.”
• Boldly said, noble captain!” rejoined the blind man.
“ Spoken like the 'Prentices' Glory. Ha, ha! From the
devil's cellar! A brave joke! The captain joketh. Ha,
ha, ha!”
"I'll tell you what, my fine feller,” said Mr. Tappertit,
eyeing the host over as he walked to a closet and took
out a bottle and glass as carelessly as if he had been in
full possession of his sight, “if you make that row, you'll
find that the captain's very far from joking, and so I tell
you.”
“He's got his eyes on me!” cried Stagg, stopping short
on his way back, and affecting to screen his face with
the bottle. “I feel 'em though I can't see 'em. Take

'em off, noble captain. Remove 'em, for they pierce
like gimlets.”
Mr. Tappertitsmiled grimly at his comrade; and twist-
ing out one more look-a kind of ocular screw-under
the in Auence of which the blind man feigned to undergo
great anguish and torture, bade him, in a softened tone,
approach, and hold his peace.
* I obey you, captain,” cried Stagg, drawing close to
him and filling out a bumper without spilling a drop by
reason that he held his little finger at the brim of the
glass, and stopped at the instant the liquor touched it;
• drink, noble governor. Death to all masters, life to all
'prentices, and love to all fair damsels. Drink, brave
general, and warm your gallant heart!"
Mr. Tappertit condescended to take the glass from his
outstretched hand. Stagg then dropped on one knee,
and gently smoothed the calves of his legs, with an air
of humble admiration.
" That I had but eyes!” he cried, “to behold my cap-
tain's symmetrical proportions! That I had but eyes, to
look upon these twin invaders of domestic peace!"
“Get out!” said Mr. Tappertit, glancing downward at
his favourite limbs. “Go along, will you, Stagg!"
“When I touch my own afterwards,” cried the host,
smiting them reproachfully, “I hate 'em. Comparatively
speaking, they've no more shape than wooden legs, be-
side these models of my noble captain's.”
“Yours!” exclaimed Mr. Tappertit. “No, I should
think not. Don't talk about those precious old tooth-
picks in the same breath with mine; that's rather
too much. Here. Take the glass. Benjamin. Lead
on. To business!”
With these words he folded his arms again; and frown-
ing with a sullen majesty, passed with his companion
through a little door at the upper end of the cellar, and
disappeared, leaving Stagg to his private meditations.
The vault they entered, strewn with sawdust and dimly
lighted, was between the outer one from which they had
just come, and that in which the skittle players were
diverting themselves; as was manifested by the increased
noise and clamour of tongues, which was suddenly
stopped, however, and replaced by a dead silence, at a
signal from the long comrade. Then, this young gentle-
man, going to a little cupboard, returned with a thigh-

bone, which in former times must have been part and
parcel of some individual at least as long as himself,
and placed the same in the hands of Mr. Tappertit; who,
receiving it as a sceptre and staff of authority, cocked
his three-cornered hat fiercely on the top of his head,
and mounted a large table, whereon a chair of state,
cheerfully ornamented with a couple of skulls, was
placed ready for his reception.
He had no sooner assumed this position than another
young gentleman appeared, bearing in his arms a huge
clasped book, who made him a profound obeisance, and
delivering it to the long comrade, advanced to the table,
and turning his back upon it, stood there Atlas-wise.
Then, the long comrade got upon the table too; and seat-
ing himself in a lower chair than Mr. Tappertit's, with
much state and ceremony, placed the large book on the
shoulders of their mute companion as deliberately as if
he had been a wooden desk, and prepared to make en-
tries therein with a pen of corresponding size.
When the long comrade had made these preparations,
he looked towards Mr. Tappertit; and Mr. Tappertit,
flourishing the bone, knocked nine times therewith
upon one of the skulls. At the ninth stroke, a third
young gentleman emerged from the door leading to the
skittle-ground, and bowing low, awaited his commands.
“ 'Prentice!” said the mighty captain, “who waits
without?”
The 'prentice made answer that a stranger was in at-
tendance, who claimed admission into that secret society
of 'Prentice Knights, and a free participation in their
rights, privileges, and immunities. Thereupon Mr.
Tappertit flourished the bone again, and giving the
other skull a prodigious rap on the nose, exclaimed,
"Admit him!” At these dread wordsthe 'prentice bowed
once more, and so withdrew as he had come.
There soon appeared at the same door, two other
'prentices, having between them a third, whose eyes
were bandaged, and who was attired in a bag-wig, and
a broad-skirted coat, trimmed with tarnished lace; and
who was girded with a sword, in compliance with the
laws of the Institution regulating the introduction of
candidates, which required them to assume this courtly
dress, and kept it constantly in lavender, for their con-
venience. One of the conductors of this novice held a

rusty blunderbuss pointed towards his ear, and the other
a very ancient sabre, with which he carved imaginary
offenders as he came along in a sanguinary and anatomi-
cal manner.
As this silent group advanced, Mr. Tappertit fixed his
hat upon his head. The novice then laid his hand upon
his breast and bent before him. When he had humbled
himself sufficiently, the captain ordered the bandage to
be removed, and proceeded to eye him over.
“Ha!” said the captain, thoughtfully, when he had
concluded this ordeal. “Proceed."
The long comrade read aloud as follows: “Mark Gil-
bert. Age, nineteen. Bound to Thomas Curzon, hosier,
Golden Fleece, Aldgate. Loves Curzon's daughter.
Cannot say that Curzon's daughter loves him. Should
think it probable. Curzon pulled his ears last Tuesday
week.”
“How!” cried the captain, starting.
“For looking at his daughter, please you,” said the
novice.
“Write Curzon down, Denounced," said the captain.
“Put a black cross against the name of Curzon."
“So please you,” said the novice, “that's not the worst
-he calls his 'prentice idle dog, and stops his beer unless
he works to his liking. He gives Dutch cheese, too,
eating Cheshire, sir, himself; and Sundays out are only
once a month.”'
“This,” said Mr. Tappertit, gravely, “is a flagrant
case. Put two black crosses to the name of Curzon.”
“If the society," said the novice, who was an ill-look-
ing, one-sided, shambling lad, with sunken eyes set close
together in his head—“if the society would burn his
house down--for he's not insured-or beat him as he
comes home from his club at night, or help me carry
off his daughter, and marry her at the Fleet, whether
she gave consent or no-"
Mr. Tappertit waved his grizzly truncheon as an ad-
monition to him not to interrupt, and ordered three black
crosses to the name of Curzon.
“Which means," he said, in gracious explanation,
“ vengeance, compleie and 'terrible. 'Prentice, do you
love the Constitution?”
To which the novice (being to that end instructed by
his attendant sponsors), replied, “I do!”

BARNABY RUDGE.
69
“The Church, the State, and everything established-
but the masters?" quoth the captain.
Again the novice said “I do."
Having said it, he listened meekly to the captain,who, in
an address prepared for such occasions, told him how that
under that same Constitution (which was kept in a strong
box somewhere, but where exactly he could not find out,
or he would have endeavoured to procure a copy of it)
the 'prentices had, in times gone by, had frequent holi-
days of right, broken people's heads by scores, defied
their masters, nay, even achieved some glorious murders
in the streets, which privileges had gradually been
wrested from them, and in all which noble aspirations
they were now restrained; how the degrading checks
imposed upon them were unquestionably attributable to
the innovating spirit of the times, and how they united
therefore to resist all change, except such change as
would restore those good old English customs, by which
they would stand or fall. After illustrating the wisdom
of going backward, by reference to that sagacious fish,
the crab, and the not unfrequent practice of the mule
and donkey, he described their general objects; which
were briefly vengeance on their Tyrant Masters (of
whose grevious and unsupportable oppression no 'pren-
tice could entertain a moment's doubt), and the restora-
tion, as aforesaid, of their ancient rights and holidays;
for neither of which objects were they now quite ripe,
being barely twenty strong, but which they pledged
themselves to pursue with fire and sword when needful.
Then he described the oath which every member of that
small remnant of a noble body took, and which was of a
dreadful and impressive kind; binding him at the bid-
ding of his chief to resist and obstruct the Lord Mayor,
sword-bearer, and chaplain; to despise the authority of
the sheriffs; and to hold the court of aldermen as naught;
but not on any account, in case the fullness of time
should bring a general rising of 'prentices, to damage or
in any way disfigure Temple Bar, which was strictly
constitutional and always to be approached with rever-
ence. Having gone over these several heads with great
eloquence and force, and having further informed the
novice that this society had had its origin in his own
teeming brain, stimulated by a swelling sense of wrong
and outrage, Mr. Tappertit demanded whether he had

strength of heart to take the mighty pledge required, or
whether he would withdraw while retreat was yet within
his power.
To this, the novice made rejoinder that he would take
the vow, though it should choke him; and it was ac-
cordingly administered with many impressive circum-
stances, among which the lighting up of the two skulls
with a candle-end inside of each, and a great many
flourishes with the bone, were chiefly conspicuous; not
to mention a variety of grave exercises with the blunder-
buss and sabre, and some dismal groaning by unseen
'prentices without. All these dark and direful cere-
monies being at length completed, the table was put
aside, the chairs of state removed, the sceptre locked up
in its usual cupboard, the doors of communication be-
tween the three cellars thrown freely open, and the
'Prentice Knights resigned themselves to merriment.
But Mr. Tappertit, who had a soul above the vulgar herd,
and who, on account of his greatness, could only afford
to be merry now and then, threw himself on a bench
with the air of a man who was faint with dignity. He
looked with an indifferent eye, alike on skittles, cards,
and dice, thinking only of the locksmith's daughter, and
the base, degenerate days on which he had fallen.
“My noble captain neither games, nor sings, nor
dances,” said his host, taking a seat beside him. “Drink,
gallant general!"
Mr. Tappertit drained the proffered goblet to the dregs;
then thrust his hands into his pockets, and with a lower-
ing visage walked among the skittles, while his fol-
lowers (such is the influence of a superior genius) re-
strained the ardent ball, and held his little shins in dumb
respect.
"If I had been born a corsair or a pirate, a brigand,
genteel highwayman or patriot-and they're the same
thing,” thought Mr. Tappertit, musing among the nine-
pins, “I should have been all right. But to drag out
an ignoble existence unbeknown to mankind in general
-patience! I will be famous yet. A voice within me
keeps on whispering Greatness. I shall burst out one
of these days, and when I do, what power can keep me
down? I feel my soul getting into my head at the idea.
More drink there!”
“The novice,” pursued Mr. Tappertit, not exactly in a

voice of thunder, for his tones, to say the truth, were
rather cracked and shrill—but very impressively, not-
withstanding—“where is he?"
“Here, noble captain!” cried Stagg. “One stands
beside me who I feel is a stranger.”
“Have you,” said Mr. Tappertit, letting his gaze fall
on the party indicated, who was indeed the new knight,
by this time restored to his own apparel; “have you the
impression of your street-door key in wax?”.
The long comrade anticipated the reply by producing
it from the shelf on which it had been deposited.
“Good,” said Mr. Tappertit, scrutinising it attentively,
while a breathless silence reigned around; for he had
constructed secret door-keys for the whole society, and
perhaps owed something of his influence to that mean
and trivial circumstance-on such slight accidents do
even men of mind depend!“this is easily made. Come
hither, friend.”
With that, he beckoned the new knight apart, and,
putting the pattern in his pocket, motioned to him to
walk by his side.
“And so," he said, when they had taken a few turns
up and down, “you-you love your master's daughter?”
“I do,” said the 'prentice. “Honour bright. No
chaff, you know.”
“Have you,” rejoined Mr. Tappertit, catching him by
the wrist, and giving him a look which would have been
expressive of the most deadly malevolence, but for an
accidental hiccup that rather interfered with it; “have
you a-a rival?”
“Not as I know on,” replied the 'prentice.
“If you had, now,” said Mr. Tappertit—what would
you-eh?”
The 'prentice looked fierce and clenched his fists.
“It is enough,” cried Mr. Tappertit, hastily; "we
understand each other. We are observed. I thank
you.”
So saying, he cast him off again; and calling the long
comrade aside after taking a few hasty turns by himself,
bade him immediately write, and post against the wall, a
notice, proscribing one Joseph Willet (commonly known
as Joe) of Chigwell; forbidding all ’Prentice Knights to
succour, comfort, or hold communion with him; and
requiring them, on pain of excommunication, to molest,

hurt, wrong, annoy, and pick quarrels with the said
Joseph, whensoever or wheresoever they, or any of
them, should happen to encounter him.
Having relieved his mind by this energetic proceeding,
he condescended to approach the festive board, and,
warming by degrees, at length deigned to preside, and
even to enchant the company with a song. After this,
he rose to such a pitch as to consent to regale the society
with a hornpipe, which he actually performed to the
music of a fiddle (played by an ingenious member), with
such surpassing agility and brilliancy of execution, that
the spectators could not be sufficiently enthusiastic in
their admiration; and their host protested, with tears in
his eyes, that he had never truly felt his blindness until
that moment.
But the host withdrawing--probably to weep in secret
-soon returned with the information that it wanted
little more than an hour of day, and that all the cocks
in Barbican had already begun to crow, as if their lives
depended on it. At this intelligence, the 'Prentice
Knights rose in haste, and marshalling into a line, filed
off one by one and dispersed with all speed to their sev-
eral homes, leaving their leader to pass the grating last.
“Good night, noble captain,” whispered the blind man
as he held it open for his passage out; “farewell, brave
general. Bye-bye, illustrious commander. Good luck
go with you for a-conceited, bragging, empty-headed,
duck-legged idiot.”
With which parting words, coolly added as he listened
to his receding footsteps and locked the grate upon him-
self, he descended the steps, and lighting the fire below
the little copper, prepared, without any assistance, for
his daily occupation; which was to retail at the area-
head above pennyworths of broth and soup, and savoury
puddings, compounded of such scraps as were to be
bought in the heap for the least money at Fleet Market
in the evening time; and for the sale of which he had
need to have depended chiefly on his private connexion,
for the court had no thoroughfare, and was not that
kind of place in which many people were likely to take
the air, or to frequent as an agreeable promenade.

CHAPTER IX.
CHRONICLERS are privileged to enter where they list,
to come and go through keyholes, to ride upon the
wind, to overcome, in their soarings up and down, all
obstacles of distance, time and place. Thrice blessed be
this last consideration, since it enables us to follow the
disdainful Miggs even into the sanctity of her chamber,
and to hold her in sweet companionship through the
dreary watches of the night!
Miss Miggs, having undone her mistress, as she
phrased it (which means, assisted to undress her), and
having seen her comfortably to bed in the back room on
the first floor, withdrew to her own apartment, in the
attic story. Notwithstanding her declaration in the
locksmith's presence, she was in no mood for sleep; so,
putting her light upon the table and withdrawing the
little window curtain, she gazed out pensively at the
wild night sky.
Perhaps she wondered what star was destined for her
habitation when she had run her little course below;
perhaps speculated which of those glimmering spheres
might be the natal orb of Mr. Tappertit; perhaps mar-
velled how they could gaze down on that perfidious
creature, man, and not sicken and turn green as chem-
ists' lamps; perhaps thought of nothing in particular.
Whatever she thought about, there she sat, until her at-
tention, alive to anything connected with the insinu-
ating 'prentice, was attracted by a noise in the next
room to her own-his room; the room in which he slept,
and dreamed-it might be, sometimes dreamed of her.
That he was not dreaming now, unless he was taking
a walk in his sleep, was clear, for every now and then
there came a shuffling noise, as though he was engaged
in polishing the whitewashed wall; then a gentle creak-
ing of his door; then the faintest indication of his
stealthy footsteps on the landing-place outside. Noting
this latter circumstance, Miss Miggs turned pale and
shuddered, as mistrusting his intentions: and more than
once exclaimed, below her breath, “Oh! what a Provi-
dence it is, as I am bolted in !"—which, owing doubtless

to her alarm, was a confusion of ideas on her part be-
tween a bolt and its use; for though there was one on
the door, it was not fastened.
Miss Miggs' sense of hearing, however, having as sharp
an edge as her temper, and being of the same snappish and
suspicious kind, very soon informed her that the footsteps
passed her door, and appeared to have some object quite
separate and disconnected from herself. At this discov-
ery she became more alarmed than ever, and was about
to give utterance to those cries of “ Thieves!” and “ Mur-
der!” which she had hitherto restrained, when it oc-
curred to her to look softly out, and see that her fears
had some good palpable foundation.
Looking out accordingly, and stretching her neck
over the hand-rail, she descried, to her great amazement,
Mr. Tappertit completely dressed, stealing down stairs,
one step at a time, with his shoes in one hand and a
lamp in the other. Following him with her eyes, and
going down a little way herself to get the better of an
intervening angle, she beheld him thrust his head in at
the parlour door, draw it back again with great swift-
ness, and immediately begin a retreat up stairs with
all possible expedition.
“Here's mysteries!” said the damsel, when she was
safe in her own room again, quite out of breath, “ Oh
gracious, here's mysteries!"
The prospect of finding anybody out in anything,
would have kept Miss Miggs awake under the influence
of henbane. Presently, she heard the step again, as she
would have done if it had been that of a feather en-
dowed with motion and walking down on tiptoe. Then
gliding out as before, she again beheld the form of the
'prentice; again he looked cautiously in at the parlour
door, but this time, instead of retreating, he passed in
and disappeared.
Miggs was back in her room, and had her head out of
the window, before an elderly gentleman could have
winked and recovered from it. Out he came at the
street door, shut it carefully behind him, tried it with
his knee, and swaggered off, putting something in his
pocket as he went along. At this spectacle Miggs cried
“ gracious!” again, and then, “ goodness gracious!” and
then “goodness gracious me!” and then, candle in hand,
went down stairs as he had done. Coming to the work--

shop, she saw the lamp burning on the forge, and every-
thing as Sim had left it.
“Why, I wish I may only have a walking funeral, and
never be buried decent with a mourning-coach and
feathers, if the boy hasn't been and made a key for his
own self!" cried Miggs. “Oh, the little villain
This conclusion was not arrived at without considera.
tion, and much peeping and peering about; nor was it
unassisted by the recollection that she had on several
occasions come upon the 'prentice suddenly, and found
him busy at some mysterious occupation. Lest the fact
of Miss Miggs calling him, on whom she stooped to cast
a favourable eye, a boy, should create surprise in any
breast, it may be observed that she invariably affected
to regard all male bipeds under thirty as mere chits and
infants; which phenomenon is not unusual in ladies of
Miss Miggs's temper, and is, indeed, generally found
to be the associate of such indomitable and savage
virtue.
Miss Miggs deliberated within herself for some little
time, looking hard at the shop-door while she did so, as
though her eyes and thoughts were both upon it; and
then, taking a sheet of paper from a drawer, twisted it
into a long, thin spiral tube. Having filled this instru-
ment with a quantity of small coal dust from the forge,
she approached the door, and dropping on one knee
before it, dexterously blew into the keyhole as much of
these fine ashes as the lock would hold. When she had
filled it to the brim in a very workmanlike and skilful
manner, she crept up stairs again, and chuckled as she
went.
“There!” cried Miggs, rubbing her hands, “now let's
see whether you won't be glad to take some notice of
me, mister. He, he, he! You'll have eyes for somebody
besides Miss Dolly now, I think. A fat-faced puss she
is, as ever I come across!”
As she uttered this criticism, she glanced approvingly
at her small mirror, as who should say, I thank my
stars that can't be said of me-as it certainly could not;
for Miss Miggs's style of beauty was of that kind which
Mr. Tappertit himself had not inaptly termed, in private,
“scraggy.”
“I don't go to bed this night!” said Miggs, wrapping
herself in a shawl, and drawing a couple of chairs near

the window, flouncing down upon one, and putting her
feet upon the other, “till you come home, my lad. I
wouldn't," said Miggs, viciously, “no, not for five-and-
forty pound!”
With that, and with an expression of face in which a
great number of opposite ingredients, such as mischief,
cunning, malice, triumph, and patient expectation, were
all mixed up together in a kind of physiognomical
punch, Miss Miggs composed herself to wait and listen,
like some fair ogress who had set a trap and was watch-
ing for a nibble from a plump young traveller.
She sat there, with perfect composure, all night. At
length, just upon break of day, there was a footstep in
the street, and presently she could hear Mr. Tappertit
stop at the door. Then she could make out that he
tried his key--that he was blowing into it—that he
knocked it on the nearest post to beat the dust out-
that he took it under a lamp to look at it—that he poked
bits of stick into the lock to clear it--that he peeped into
the keyhole, first with one eye, and then with the other-
that he tried the key again—that he couldn't turn it, and
what was worse couldn't get it out—that he bent it-
that then it was much less disposed to come out than
before—that he gave it a mighty twist and a great pull,
and then it came out so suddenly that he staggered
backwards—that he kicked the door-that he shook it,
finally, that he smote his forehead, and sat down on the
step in despair.
When this crisis had arrived, Miss Miggs, affecting
to be exhausted with terror, and to cling to the window-
sill for support, put out her night-cap and demanded in
a faint voice who was there.
Mr. Tappertit cried, “Hush !" and, backing into the
road, exhorted her in frenzied pantomime to secrecy
and silence.
“ Tell me one thing,” said Miggs. “Is it thieves ?”
“No-no-no !" cried Mr. Tappertit.
“Then,” said Miggs, more faintly than before, “it's
fire. Where is it, sir ? It's near this room, I know.
I've a good conscience, sir, and would much rather die
than go down a ladder. All I wish is, respecting my
love to my married sister, Golden Lion Court, number

post,

ryny
"Miggs!” cried Mr. Tappertit, “don't you know me ?
Sim, you know-Sim-”
“Oh! what about him!” cried Miggs clasping her
hands. “Is he in any danger ? Is he in the midst of
flames and blazes! Oh, gracious, gracious !"
“Why, I'm here, ain't I ?” rejoined Mr. Tappertit,
knocking himself on the breast. “Don't you see me?
What a fool you are, Miggs !”
“There!” cried Miggs, unmindful of this compliment.
“Why—so it-goodness, what is the meaning of—if
you please, mim, here's—”
“No, no!” cried Mr. Tappertit, standing on tiptoe, as
if by that means he, in the street, were any nearer being
able to stop the mouth of Miggs in the garret. Don't!
-I've been out without leave, and something or an-
other's the matter with the lock. Come down, and
undo the shop-window, that I may get in that
way.”
"I dursn't do it, Simmun,” cried Miggs—for that was
her pronunciation of his christian name. “I dursn't do it,
indeed. You know, as well as anybody, how particular
I am. And to come down in the dead of night, when
the house is wrapped in slumbers and weiled in obscur-
ity.” And there she stopped and shivered, for her
modesty caught cold at the very thought.
“But, Miggs,” cried Mr. Tappertit, getting under the
lamp, that she might see his eyes. “My darling
Miggs—”
Miggs screamed slightly.
"_That I love so much, and never can help thinking
of,” and it is impossible to describe the use he made of
his eyes when he said this—“ do—for my sake, do.”
“Oh Simmun,” cried Miggs, “this is worse than all.
I know if I come down, you'll go, and—”
“And what, my precious!” said Mr. Tappertit.
“And try,” said Miggs, hysterically, “to kiss me, or
some such dreadfulness; I know you will!”
“I swear I won't,” said Mr. Tæppertit, with remark-
able earnestness. “Upon my soul, I won't. It's getting
broad day, and the watchman's waking up. Angelic
Miggs! If you'll only come and let me in, I promise you
faithfully and truly I won't.”
Miss Miggs, whose gentle heart was touched, did not
wait for the oath (knowing how strong the temptation

was, and fearing he might forswear himself), but tripped
lightly down the stairs, and with her own fair hands
drew back the rough fastenings of the workshop win-
dow. Having helped the wayward 'prentice in, she
faintly articulated the words,“ Simmun is safe!” and
yielding to her woman's nature, immediately became
insensible.
“I knew I should quench her,” said Sim, rather em-
barrassed by this circumstance." Of course I was cer-
tain it would come to this, but there was nothing else to
be done-if I hadn't eyed her over, she wouldn't have
come down. Here. Keep up a minute, Miggs. What
a slippery figure she is! There's no holding her, com-
fortably. Do keep up a minute, Miggs, will you?"
As Miggs, however, was deaf to all entreaties, Mr.
Tappertit leant her against the wall as one might dis-
pose of a walking-stick or umbrella, until he had secured
the window, when he took her in his arms again, and,
in short stages and with great difficulty-arising mainly
from her being tall and his being short, and perhaps in
some degree from that peculiar physical conformation on
which he had already remarked-carried her up stairs,
and planting her in the same umbrella or walking-stick
fashion, just inside her own door, left her to her repose.
“He may be as cool as he likes,” said Miss Miggs, re-
covering as soon as she was left alone; “ but I'm in his
confidence and he can't help himself, nor couldn't if he
was twenty Simmunses!”
CHAPTER X.
It was on one of those mornings, common in early
spring, when the year, fickle and changeable in its
youth like all other created things, is undecided whether
to step backward into winter or forward into summer,
and in its uncertainty inclines now to the one and now
to the other, and now to both at once—wooing summer
in the sunshine, and lingering still with winter in the
shade—it was, in short, on one of those mornings, when
it is hot and cold, wet and dry, bright and lowering, sad
and cheerful, withering and genial, in the compass of
one short hour, that old John Willet, who was dropping

asleep over the copper boiler, was roused by the sound
of a horse's feet, and glancing out at window, beheld a
traveller of goodly promise checking his bridle at the
Maypole door.
He was none of your flippant young fellows who
would call for a tankard of mulled ale and make them-
selves as much at home as if they had ordered a hogs-
head of wiņe; none of your audacious young swaggerers,
who would even penetrate into the bar—that solemn
sanctuary—and, smiting old John upon the back, inquire
if there was never a pretty girl in the house, and where
he hid his little chambermaids, with a hundred other
impertinences of that nature; none of your free-and-
easy companions who would scrape their boots upon the
fire-dogs in the common room, and be not at all particu-
lar on the subject of spittoons; none of your unconscion-
able blades, requiring impossible chops, and taking un-
heard-of pickles for granted. He was a staid, grave,
placid gentleman, something past the prime of life, yet
upright in his carriage, for all that, and slim as a grey-
hound. He was well mounted. upon a sturdy chestnut
cob, and had the graceful seat of an experienced horse-
man; while his riding gear, though free from such fop-
peries as were then in vogue, was handsome and well
chosen. He wore a riding coat of a somewhat brighter
green than might have been expected to suit the taste of
a gentleman of his years, with a short, black, velvet
cape, and laced pocket-holes and cuffs, all of a jaunty
fashion; his linen, too, was of the finest kind, worked in
a rich pattern at the wrists and throat, and scrupulously
white. Although he seemed, judging from the mud he
had picked up on the way, to have come from London,
his horse was as smooth and cool as his own iron-grey
periwig and pig-tail. Neither man nor beast had turned
a single hair; and, saving for his soiled skirts and spat-
terdashes, this gentleman with his blooming face, white
teeth, exactly-ordered dress, and perfect calmness,
might have come from making an elaborate and leisurely
toilet, to sit for an equestrian portrait at old John
Willet's gate.
It must not be supposed that John observed these
several characteristics by other than very slow degrees,
or that he took in more than half a one at a time, or that
he even made up his mind upon that, without a great

deal of very serious consideration. Indeed, if he had
been distracted in the first instance by questionings and
orders, it would have taken him at the least a fortnight
to have noted what is here set down; but it happened
that the gentleman, being struck with the old house, or
with the plump pigeons which were skimming and
curtseying about it, or with the tall may pole, on the
top of which a weathercock, which had been out of order
for fifteen years, performed a perpetual walk to the
music of its own creaking, sat for some little time look-
ing round in silence. Hence John, standing with his
hand upon the horse's bridle, and his great eyes on the
rider, and with nothing passing to divert his thoughts,
had really got some of these little circumstances into his
brain by the time he was called upon to speak.
“A quaint place this,” said the gentleman-and his
voice was as rich as his dress. “Are you the landlord?”
“At your service, sir,” replied John Willet.
“You can give my horse good stabling, can you, and
me an early dinner (I am not particular what, so that it
be cleanly served), and a decent room-of which there
seems to be no lack in this great mansion,” said the
stranger, again running his eyes over the exterior.
“You can have, sir,” returned John, with a readiness
quite surprising, "anything you please.”
“It's well I am easily satisfied,” returned the other,
with a smile, “or that might prove a hardy pledge, my
friend.” And saying so, he dismounted, with the aid of
the block before the door, in a twinkling.
“Hallo there! Hugh!" roared John. "I ask your
pardon, sir, for keeping you standing in the porch; but
my son has gone to town on business, and the boy being,
as I may say, of a kind of use to me, I'm rather put
out when he's away. Hugh!-a dreadful idle vagrant
fellow, sir-half a gipsy, as I think—always sleeping
in the sun in summer, and in the straw in winter time,
sir-Hugh! Dear Lord, to keep a gentleman a waiting
here, through him!-Hugh! I wish that chap was dead,
I do indeed.”
“Possibly he is,” returned the other. “I should think
if he were living, he would have heard you by this time.”
“In his fits of laziness, he sleeps so desperate hard,"
said the distracted host, “ that if you were to fire off
cannon-balls into his ears, it wouldn't wake him, sir.”

The guest made no remark upon this novel cure for
drowsiness, and recipe for making people lively, but
with his hands clasped behind him, stood in the porch,
apparently very much amused to see old John, with the
bridle in his hand, wavering between a strong impulse
to abandon the animal to his fate, and a half disposition
to lead him into the house, and shut him up in the par-
lour, while he waited on his master.
“Pillory the fellow, here he is at last!" cried John in
the very height and zenith of his distress. “Did you
hear me a calling, villain?”
The figure he addressed made no answer, but putting
his hand upon the saddle, sprang into it at a bound,
turned the horse's head towards the stable, and was
gone in an instant.
“Brisk enough when he is awake," said the guest.
“Brisk enough, sir!" replied John, looking at the
place where the horse had been, as if not yet under-
standing quite what had become of him. “He melts,
I think. He goes like a drop of froth. You look at
him and there he is. You look at him again, and—there
he isn't.”
Having, in the absence of any more words, put this
sudden climax to what he had faintly intended should
be a long explanation of the whole life and character
of his man, the oracular John Willet led the gentleman
up the wide dismantled staircase into the Maypole's
best apartment.
It was spacious enough in all conscience, occupying
the whole depth of the house, and having at either end
a great bay-window, as large as many modern rooms.
in which some few panes of stained glass, emblazoned
with fragments of armorial bearings, though cracked,
and patched, and shattered, yet remained, attesting by
their presence that the former owner had made the
very light subservient to his state, and pressed the sun
itself into his list of flatterers, bidding it, when it shone
into his chamber, reflect the badges of his ancient family
and take new hues and colours from their pride.
But those were old days, and now every little ray came
and went as it would, telling the plain, bare, searching
truth. Although the best room of the inn, it had the
melancholy aspect of grandeur in decay, and was much
too vast for comfort. Rich rustling hangings waving

on the walls; and, better far, the rustling of youth and
beauty's dress; the light of woman's eyes, outshining
the tapers and their own rich jewels; the sound of gentle
tongues, and music, and the tread of maiden feet, had
once been there, and filled it with delight. But they
were gone, and with them all its gladness. It was no
longer a home; children were never born and bred
there; the fireside had become mercenary-a something
to be bought and sold-a very courtezan; let who would
die, or sit beside, or leave it, it was still the same-it
missed nobody, cared for nobody, had equal warmth and
smiles for all. God help the man whose heart ever
changes with the world, as an old mansion when it be-
comes an inn!
No effort had been made to furnish this chilly waste,
but before the broad chimney a colony of chairs and
tables had been planted on a square of carpet, flanked
by a ghostly screen, enriched with figures, grinning and
grotesque. After lighting with his own hands the fag-
gots which were heaped upon the hearth, old John with-
drew to hold grave counsel with his cook touching the
stranger's entertainment; while the guest himself, see-
ing small comfort in the yet unkindled wood, opened a
lattice in the distant window, and basked in a sickly
gleam of cold March sun.
Leaving the window now and then to rake the crack-
ling logs together, or pace the echoing room from end to
end, he closed it when the fire was quite burnt up, and
having wheeled the easiest chair into the warmest corner,
summoned John Willet.
“ Sir," said John.
He wanted pen, ink and paper. There was an old
standish on the high mantel-shelf containing a dusty
apology for all three. Having set this before him, the
landlord was retiring, when he motioned him to stay.
“ There's a house not far from here,” said the guest,
when he had written a few lines, “which you call the
Warren, I believe?"
As this was said in the tone of one who knew the fact,
and asked the question as a thing of course, John con-
tented himself with nodding his head in the affirmative;
at the same time taking one hand out of his pockets to
cough behind, and then putting it in again.
“I want this note,” said the guest, glancing on what

83
he had written, and folding it, “conveyed there without
loss of time, and an answer brought back here. Have
you a messenger at hand?"
John was thoughtful for a minute or thereabouts, and
then said yes.
“Let me see him,” said the guest.
This was disconcerting; for Joe being out, and Hugh
engaged in rubbing down the chestnut cob, he designed
sending on the errand, Barnaby, who had just then
arrived in one of his rambles, and who, so that he
thought himself employed on grave and serious business,
would go anywhere.
“Why, the truth is,” said John, after a long pause,
“that the person who'd go quickest is a sort of natural,
as one may say, sir; and though quick of foot, and as
much to be trusted as the post itself, he's not good at
talking, being touched and flighty, sir.”
“You don't,” said the guest, raising his eyes to John's
fat face, “you don't mean-what's the fellow's name-
you don't mean Barnaby?”
“Yes, I do,” returned the landlord, his features turning
quite expressive with surprise.
“How comes he to be here?” inquired the guest, lean-
ing back in his chair; speaking in the bland, even tone,
from which he never varied; and with the same soft,
courteous, never-changing smile upon his face. “I
saw him in London last night.”
“He's forever, here one hour, and there the next,"
returned old John, after the usual pause to get the ques-
tion in his mind. “Sometimes he walks, and some-
times runs. He's known along the road by everybody,
and sometimes comes here in a cart or chaise, and some-
times riding double. He comes and goes, through wind,
rain, snow, and hail, and on the darkest nights. Noth-
ing hurts him.”
“He goes often to this Warren, does he not?” said the
guest, carelessly. “I seem to remember his mother tell-
ing me something to that effect yesterday. But I was
not attending to the good woman much."
“You're right, sir,” John made answer, “he does.
His father, sir, was murdered in that house.”
“So I have heard,” returned the guest, taking a gold
toothpick from his pocket with the same sweet smile.
“A very disagreeable circumstance for the family."

84
BARNABY RUDGE.
" Very,” said John, with a puzzled look, as if it oc-
curred to him, dimly and afar off, that this might by
possibility be a cool way of treating the subject.
"All the circumstances after a murder,” said the guest,
soliloquising, “must be dreadfully unpleasant-so much
bustle and disturbance-no repose-a constant dwelling
upon one subject-and the running in and out, and up
and down stairs, intolerable. I wouldn't have such a
thing happen to anybody I was nearly interested in, on
any account. 'Twould be enough to wear one's life out.
You were going to say, friend—” he added, turning to
John again.
“Only that Mrs. Rudge lives on a little pension from
the family, and that Barnaby's as free of the house as
any cat or dog about it," answered John. “Shall he do
your errand, sir?"
“Oh, yes,” replied the guest. “Oh, certainly. Let
him do it by all means. Please to bring him here that
I may charge him to be quick. If he objects to come you
may tell him it's Mr. Chester. He will remember my
name, I dare say."
John was so very much astonished to find who his
visitor was, that he could express no astonishment at
all, by looks or otherwise, but left the room as if he
were in the most placid and imperturbable of all pos-
sible conditions. It has been reported that when he got
down stairs, he looked steadily at the boiler for ten
minutes by the clock, and all that time never once left
off shaking his head; for which statement there would
seem to be some ground of truth and feasibility, inas-
much as that interval of time did certainly elapse be-
fore he returned with Barnaby to the guest's apart-
ment.
“ Come hither, lad,” said Mr. Chester. “You know
Mr. Geoffrey Haredale?”
Barnaby laughed, and looked at the landlord as though
he would say, “ You hear him?” John, who was greatly
shocked at this breach of decorum, clapped his finger
to his nose, and shook his head in mute remonstrance.
“He knows him, sir,” said John, frowning aside at
Barnaby, “as well as you or I do.”
“I haven't the pleasure of much acquaintance with
the gentleman,” returned his guest. "You may have.
Limit the comparison to yourself, my friend."


## p. 85 (#99) ##############################################

BARNABY RUDGE.
Although this was said with the same easy affability,
and the same smile, John felt himself put down, and
laying the indignity at Barnaby's door, determind to
kick his raven, on the very first opportunity.
“Give that,” said the guest, who had by this time
sealed the note, and who beckoned his messenger towards
him as he spoke, “into Mr. Haredale's own hands.
Wait for an answer, and bring it back to me-here. If
you should find that Mr. Haredale is engaged just now,
tell him-can he remember a message, landlord ?”.
“When he chooses, sir," replied John. “He won't
forget this one.
“How are you sure of that?"
John merely pointed at him as he stood with his head
bent forward, and his earnest gaze fixed closely on his
questioner's face; and nodded sagely.
Tell him then, Barnaby, should he be engaged,” said
Mr. Chester, “that I shall be glad to wait his con-
venience here, and to see him (if he will call) at any
time this evening. At the worst I can have a bed here,
Willet, I suppose?”
Old John, immensely flattered by the personal noto-
riety implied in this familiar form of address, answered,
with something like a knowing look, “I should believe
you could, sir,” and was turning over in his mind vari-
ous forms of eulogium, with the view of selecting one
appropriate to the qualities of his best bed, when his
ideas were put to flight by Mr. Chester giving Barnaby
the letter, and bidding him make all speed away.
“Speed!” said Barnaby, folding the little packet in
his breast. “Speed! If you want to see hurry and
mystery, come here. Here!”
With that, he put his hand, very much to John Willet's
horror, on the guest's fine broadcloth sleeve, and led
him stealthily to the back window.
“Look down there,” he said, softly; “ do you mark
how they whisper in each other's ears, then dance and
leap, to make believe they are in sport? Do you see
how they stop for a moment, when they think there is
no one looking, and mutter among themselves again;
and then how they roll and gambol, delighted with the
mischief they've been plotting? Look at 'em now. See
how they whirl and plunge. And now they stop again,
and whisper cautiously together-little thinking, mind,

how often I have lain upon the grass and watched them.
I say—what is it that they plot and hatch? Do you
know?"
“ They are only clothes,” returned the guest; “such
as we wear; hanging on those lines to dry, and flutter-
ing in the wind."
* Clothes!” echoed Barnaby, looking close into his
face, and falling quickly back. “Ha ha! Why, how
much better to be silly, than as wise as you! You don't
see shadowy people there, like those that live in sleep-
not you. Nor eyes in the knotted panes of glass, nor
swift ghosts when it blows hard, nor do you hear voices
in the air, nor see men stalking in the sky-not you! I
lead a merrier life than you, with all your cleverness.
You're the dull men. We're the bright ones. Ha! ha!
I'll not change with you, clever as you are—not I!”
With that, he waved his hat above his head, and
darted off.
“A strange creature, upon my word!” said the guest,
pulling out a handsome box, and taking a pinch of
snuff.
“He wants imagination,” said Mr. Willet, very slowly
and after a long silence; “that's what he wants. I've
tried to instil it into him, many and many's a time; but”
-John added this, in confidence—“he an't made for it;
that's the fact.”
To record that Mr. Chester smiled at John's remark
would be little to the purpose, for he preserved the same
conciliatory and pleasant look at all times. He drew
his chair nearer to the fire though, as a kind of hint
that he would prefer to be alone, and John, having
no reasonable excuse for remaining, left him to him-
self.
Very thoughtful old John Willet was, while the dinner
was preparing; and if his brain was ever less clear at
one time than another, it is but reasonable to suppose
that he addled it in no slight degree by shaking his head
so much that day. That Mr. Chester, between whom
and Mr. Haredale, it was notorious to all the neighbour-
hood, a deep and bitter animosity existed, should come
down there for the sole purpose, as it seemed, of seeing
him, and should chose the Maypole for their place of
meeting, and should send to him express, were stumbling-
blocks John could not overcome. The only resource he

judge your home and makinger i guest,"
had was to consult the boiler and wait impatiently for
Barnaby's return.
But Barnaby delayed beyond all precedent. The visi-
tor's dinner was served, removed, his wine was set, the
fire replenished, the hearth clean swept; the light waned
without, it grew dusk, became quite dark, and still no
Barnaby appeared. Yet, though John Willet was full of
wonder and misgiving, his guest sat cross-legged in the
easy chair, to all appearance as little ruffled in his
thoughts as in his dress—the same calm, easy, cool
gentleman, without care or thought beyond his golden
toothpick.
“Barnaby's late,” John ventured to observe, as he
placed a pair of tarnished candlesticks, some three feet
high, upon the table, and snuffed the lights they held.
“He is rather so,” replied the guest, sipping his wine.
“ He will not be much longer, I dare say.”
John coughed, and raked the fire together.
“As your roads bear no very good character, if I may
judge from my son's mishap, though,” said Mr. Chester,
“and as I have no fancy to be knocked on the head-
which is not only disconcerting at the moment, but
places one, besides, in a ridiculous position with respect
to the people who chance to pick one up—I shall stop
here to-night. I think you said you had a bed to spare."
“Such a bed, sir,” returned John Willet; “aye, such a
bed as few, even the gentry's houses, own. A fixter
here, sir. I've heard say that bedstead is nigh two hun-
dred years of age. Your noble son—a fine young gen-
tleman-slept in it last, sir, half a year ago."
“Upon my life, a recommendation!” said the guest,
shrugging his shoulders and wheeling his chair nearer
to the fire. “See that it be well aired, Mr. Willet,
and let a blazing fire be lighted there at once. This
house is something damp and chilly.”
John raked the faggots up again, more from habit
than presence of mind, or any reference to this remark,
and was about to withdraw, when a bounding step was
heard upon the stair, and Barnaby came panting in.
“He'll have his foot in the stirrup in an hour's time,” he
cried, advancing. “He has been riding hard all day-has
just come home-but will be in the saddle again as soon
as he has eat and drank, to meet his loving friend.”
“ Was that his message?” asked the visitor, looking
to thet a blazining daggots .

up; but without the smallest discomposure—or at least
without the smallest show of any.
“ All but the last words,” Barnaby rejoined. “He
meant those. I saw that in his face.”
“This for your pains,” said the other, putting money
in his hand, and glancing at him steadfastly. “This
for your pains, sharp Barnaby.”.
“For Grip, and me, and Hugh, to share among us,”
he rejoined, putting it up, and nodding as he counted it
on his fingers. “Grip one, me two, Hugh three; the
dog, the goat, the cats—well, we shall spend it pretty
soon, I warn you. Stay. Look. Do you wise men see
nothing there, now?”.
He bent eagerly down on one knee, and gazed intently
at the smoke which was rolling up the chimney in a
thick black cloud. John Willet, who appeared to con-
sider himself particularly and chiefly referred to under
the term wise men, looked that way likewise, and with
great solidity of feature.
“Now, where do they go to when they spring so fast
up there?” asked Barnaby; "eh? Why do they tread so
closely on each other's heels, and why are they always
in a hurry_which is what you blame me for, when I
only take pattern by those busy folk about me. More
of 'em! catching to each other's skirts; and as fast
as they go, others come! What a merry dance it is! I
would that Grip and I could frisk like that!”
“What has he in that basket at his back?” asked the
guest after a few moments, during which Barnaby was
still bending down to look higher up the chimney, and
earnestly watching the smoke.
“In this?” he answered, jumping up before John
Willet could reply--shaking it as he spoke, and stooping
his head to listen. “In this! What is there here? Tell
him!”
“A devil, a devil, a devil!” cried a hoarse voice.
“Here's money!” said Barnaby, chinking it in his
hand, “ money for a treat, Grip!"
“Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" replied the raven; “keep
up your spirits. Never say die. Bow, wow, wow!"
Mr. Willet, who appeared to entertain strong doubts
whether a customer in a laced coat and fine linen could
be supposed to have any acquaintance even with the ex-
istence of such unpolite gentry as the bird claimed to

belong to, took Barnaby off at this juncture, with the
view of preventing any other improper declarations,
and quitted the room with his very best bow.
CHAPTER XI.
THERE was great news that night for the regular May-
pole customers, to each of whom, as he straggled in to
occupy his allotted seat in the chimney corner, John with
a most impressive slowness of delivery, and in an apo-
plectic whisper, communicated the fact that Mr. Chester
was alone in the large room up stairs, and was waiting
the arrival of Mr. Geoffrey Haredale, to whom he had
sent a letter (doubtless of a threatening nature) by the
hands of Barnaby, then and there present.
For a little knot of smokers and solemn gossips, who
had seldom any new topics of discussion, this was a per-
fect godsend. Here was a good, dark-looking mystery
progressing under that very roof-brought home to the
fireside as it were, and enjoyable without the smallest
pains or trouble. It is extraordinary what a zest and
relish it gave to the drink, and how it heightened the
flavour of the tobacco. Every man smoked his pipe
with a face of grave and serious delight, and looked at
his neighbour with a sort of quiet congratulation. Nay,
it was felt to be such a holiday and special night, that,
on the motion of little Solomon Daisy, every man (in-
cluding John himself) put down his sixpence for a can
of flip, which grateful beverage was brewed with all
despatch, and set down in the midst of them on the brick
floor ; both that it might simmer and stew before the
fire, and that its fragrant steam, rising up among
them and mixing with the wreaths of vapour from their
pipes, might shroud them in a delicious atmosphere of
their own, and shut out all the world. The very furni-
ture of the room seemed to mellow and deepen in its
tone; the ceiling and walls looked blacker and more
highly polished, the curtains of a ruddier red; the fire
burnt clear and high, and the crickets in the hearth-stone
chirped with a more than wonted satisfaction,
There were present two, however, who showed but
little interest in the general contentment. Of these one

was Barnaby himself, who slept, or, to avoid being beset
with questions, feigned to sleep, in the chimney-corner;
the other, Hugh, who, sleeping too, lay stretched upon
the bench on the opposite side, in the full glare of the
blazing fire.
The light that fell upon this slumbering form showed it
in all its muscular and handsome proportions. It was that
of a young man, of a hale, athletic figure, and a giant's
strength, whose sunburnt face and swarthy throat, over-
grown with jet black hair, might have served a painter
for a model. Loosely attired, in the coarsest and rough-
est garb, with scraps of straw and hay-his usual bed-
clinging here and there, and mingling with his uncombed
locks, he had fallen asleep in a posture as careless as his
dress. The negligence and disorder of the whole man,
with something fierce and sullen in his features, gave
him a picturesque appearance that attracted the regards
even of the Maypole customers who knew him well, and
caused Long Parkes to say that Hugh looked more like
a poaching rascal to-night than ever he had seen him
yet.
“He's waiting here, I suppose,” said Solomon, “to
take Mr. Haredale's horse.”
" That's it, sir,” replied John Willet. “He's not often
in the house, you know. He's more at his ease among
horses than men. I look upon him as a animal him-
self.”
Following up this opinion with a shrug that seemed
meant to say, “We can't expect everybody to be like us,”
John put his pipe into his mouth again, and smoked like
one who felt his superiority over the general run of man-
kind.
“That chap, sir,” said John, taking it out again after
a time, and pointing at him with the stem, “though he's
got all his faculties about him-bottled up and corked
down if I may so, somewheres or another”
“Very good!” said Parkes, nodding his head. “A
very good expression, Johnny. You'll be a tackling
somebody presently. You're in twig to-night, I see.”
“Take care,” said Mr. Willet, not at all grateful for
the compliment, “ that I don't tackle you, sir, which I
shall certainly endeaver to do, if you interrupt me when
I'm making observations. That chap, I was a saying,
though he has all his faculties about him, somewheres

or another, bottled up and corked down, has no more
imagination than Barnaby has. And why hasn't he?”
The three friends shook their heads åt each other;
saying, by that action, without the trouble of opening
their lips, “ Do you observe what a philosophical mind
our friend has?"
“Why hasn't he?” said John, gently striking the
table with his open hand. “Because they was never
drawed out of him when he was a boy. That's why.
What would any of us have been, if our fathers hadn't
drawed our faculties out of us? What would my boy
Joe have been, if I hadn't drawed his faculties out
of him? Do you mind what I'm a saying of, gentle-
men?”
“Ah! we mind you,” cried Parkes. “Go on improv-
ing of us, Johnny.”
*Consequently, then,” said Mr. Willet, “ that chap,
whose mother was hung when he was a little boy, along
with six others, for passing bad notes—and it's a blessed
thing to think how many people are hung in batches
every six weeks for that, and such like offences, as
showing how wide awake our government is—that chap
was then turned loose, and had to mind cows, and
frighten birds away, and what not, for a few pence to
live on, and so got on by degrees to mind horses, and to
sleep in course of time in lofts and litter, instead of under
haystacks and hedges, till at last he come to be hostler
at the Maypole for his board and lodging and a annual
trifle—that chap that can't read nor write, and has never
had much to do with anything but animals, and has
never lived in any way but like the animals he has lived
among, is a aninial. And,” said Mr. Willet, arriving at
his logical conclusion,“ is to be treated accordingly.”
“Willet,” said Solomon Daisy, who had exhibited some
impatience at the intrusion of so unworthy a subject on
their more interesting theme, “when Mr. Chester come
this morning, did he order the large room ?”
“He signified, sir,” said John, “ that he wanted a
large apartment. Yes. Certainly.”
“Why, then, I'll tell you what,” said Solomon, speak-
ing softly and with an earnest look. “He and Mr.
Haredale are going to fight a duel in it.”
Everybody looked at Mr. Willet, after this alarming
suggestion. Mr. Willet looked at the fire, weighing in

his own mind the effect which such an occurrence would
be likely to have on the establishment.
• “Well,” said John, “I don't know-I am sure-I re-
member that when I went up last, he had put the lights
upon the mantel-shelf.”
“It's as plain,” returned Solomon, “as the nose on
Parkes's face”—Mr. Parkes, who had a large nose,
rubbed it, and looked as if he considered this a personal
allusion=“they'll fight in that room. You know by
the newspapers what a common thing it is for gentlemen
to fight in coffee-houses without seconds. One of 'em
will be wounded or perhaps killed in this house.”
“That was a challenge that Barnaby took, then, eh?”
said John.
"-Inclosing a slip of paper with the measure of his
sword upon it, I'll bet a guinea," answered the little
man. “We know what sort of a gentleman Mr. Hare-
dale is. You have told us what Barnaby said about his
looks when he came back. Depend upon it I'm right.
Now, mind.”
The flip had had no flavour till now. The tobacco had
been of mere English growth, compared with its present
taste. A duel in that great old rambling room up stairs,
and the best bed ordered already for the wounded
man!
“Would it be swords or pistols, now?” said John.
“Heaven knows. Perhaps both,” returned Solomon.
“ The gentlemen wear swords, and may easily have
pistols in their pockets-most likely have, indeed. If
they fire at each other without effect, then they'll draw,
and go to work in earnest.”
A shade passed over Mr. Willet's face as he thought
of broken windows and disabled furniture, but bethink-
ing himself that one of the party would probably be left
alive to pay the damage, he brightened up again.
“And then,” said Solomon, looking from face to face,
"then we shall have one of those stains upon the floor
that never come out. If Mr. Haredale wins, depend
upon it, it'll be a deep one; or if he loses, it will per-
haps be deeper still, for he'll never give in, unless he's
beaten down. We know him better, eh?”
“Better indeed!” they whispered all together.
“As to ever being got out again,” said Solomon, “I
tell you it never will, or can be. Why, do you know
ome deep, he'll n better, i togetsolomoknot
own. We they whisperain," said Solomu know

that it has been tried, at a certain house that we are ac-
quainted with?”
* “ The Warren!” cried John! “No, sure!"
“Yes, sure-yes. It's only known by very few. It
has been whispered about, though, for all that. They
planed the board away, but there it was. They went
deep, but it went deeper. They put new boards down,
but there was one great spot that came through still,
and showed itself in the old place. And-harkye-draw
nearer-Mr. Geoffrey made that room his study, and sits
there, always, with his foot (as I have heard) upon it;
and he believes through thinking of it long and very
much that it will never fade until he finds the man who
did the deed.”
As this recital ended, and they all drew closer round
the fire, the tramp of a horse was heard without.
“ The very man !" cried John, starting up. “Hugh!
Hugh !”
The sleeper staggered to his feet, and hurried after
him. John quickly returned, ushering in with great at-
tention and deference (for Mr. Haredale was his land-
lord) the long-expected visitor, who strode into the room
clanking his heavy boots upon the floor; and looking
keenly round upon the bowing group, raised his hat in
acknowledgment of their profound respect.
“You have a stranger here, Willet, who sent to me,”
he said, in a voice which sounded naturally stern and
deep. “Where is he ?”
"In the great room up-stairs, sir,” answered John.
“Show the way. Your staircase is dark, I know.
Gentlemen, good-night."
With that he signed to the landlord to go on before;
and went clanking out, and up the stairs; old John, in
his agitation, ingeniously lighting everything but the
way, and making a stumble at every second step.
"Stop!” he said, when they reached the landing. “I
can announce myself. Don't wait.”
He laid his hand upon the door, entered, and shut it
heavily. Mr. Willet was by no means disposed to stand
there listening by himself, especially as the walls were
very thick; so descended, with much greater alacrity
than he had come up, and joined his friends below,

CHAPTER XII.
THERE was a brief pause in the state-room of the May-
pole, as Mr. Haredale tried the lock to satisfy himself
that he had shut the door securely, and, striding up the
dark chamber to where the screen enclosed a little patch
of light and warmth, presented himself, abruptly and in
silence, before the smiling guest.
If the two had no greater sympathy in their inward
thoughts than in their outward bearing and appearance,
the meeting did not seem likely to prove a very calm or
pleasant one. With no great disparity between them
in point of years, they were, in every other respect, as
unlike and far removed from each other as two men
could well be. The one was soft-spoken, delicately made,
precise, and elegant; the other, a burly, square-built
man, negligently dressed, rough and abrupt in manner,
stern, and, in his present mood, forbidding both in look
and speech. The one preserved a calm and placid smile;
the other, a distrustful frown. The new-comer, indeed,
appeared bent on showing by his every tone and gesture
his determined opposition and hostility to the man he
had come to meet. The guest who received him, on the
other hand, seemed to feel that the contrast between
them was all in his favour, and to derive a quiet exulta-
tion from it which put him more at his ease than ever.
“Haredale,” said this gentleman, without the least
appearance of embarrassment or reserve, “I am very
glad to see you.”
º “Let us dispense with compliments. They are mis-
placed between us,” returned the other, waving his
hand, “and say plainly what we have to say. You have
asked me to meet you. I am here. Why do we stand
face to face again?”
“Still the same frank and sturdy character, I see!”
“Good or bad, sir, I am,” returned other, leaning his
arm upon the chimney-piece, and turning a haughty
look upon the occupant of the easy-chair, “the man I
used to be. I have lost no old likings or dislikings; my
memory has not failed me by a hair's breadth. You
ask me to give you a meeting. I say, I am here,”

“Our meeting, Haredale,” said Mr. Chester, tapping
his snuff-box, and following with a smile the impatient
gesture he had made—perhaps unconsciously—towards
his sword, “is one of conference and peace, I hope?”
“I have come here," returned the other, “at your de-
sire, holding myself bound to meet you, when and where
you would. I have not come to bandy pleasant speeches,
or hollow professions. You are a smooth man of the
world, sir, and at such play have me at a disadvantage.
The very last man on this earth with whom I would en-
ter the lists to combat with gentle compliments and
masked faces, is Mr. Chester, I do assure you. I am not
his match at such weapons, and have reason to believe
that few men are.”
“You do me a great deal of honour, Haredale,” re-
turned the other, most composedly, “and I thank you.
I will be frank with you—”.
“I beg your pardon-will be what?"
“Frank-open-perfectly candid.”
“Hah!” cried Mr. Haredale, drawing in his breath.
“But don't let me interrupt you."
“So resolved am I to hold this course," returned the
other, tasting his wine with great deliberation, “that I
have determined not to quarrel with you, and not to be
betrayed into a warm expression or a hasty word.”
“There again,” said Mr. Haredale, “you have me at a
great advantage. Your self-command"
“Is not to be disturbed, when it will serve my pur-
pose, you would say,” rejoined the other, interrupting
him with the same complacency. “Granted. I allow
it. And I have a purpose to serve now. So have you.
I am sure our object is the same. Let us attain it like
sensible men, who have ceased to be boys some time.
Do you drink?”
“With my friends," returned the other.
“At least,” said Mr. Chester, “ you will be seated?”
“I will stand,” returned Mr. Haredale, impatiently,
“ on this dismantled beggared hearth, and not pollute it,
fallen as it is, with mockeries. Go on!”.
“You are wrong, Haredale," said the other, crossing
his legs, and smiling as he held his glass up in the
bright glow of the fire. “You are really very wrong.
The world is a lively place enough, in which we must
accommodate ourselves to circumstances, sail with the

stream as glibly as we can, be content to take froth for
substance, the surface for the depth, the counterfeit for
the real coin. I wonder that no philosopher has ever es-
tablished that our globe itself is hollow. It should be,
if Nature is consistent in her works.”
“ You think it is, perhaps ?”
“I should say,” he returned, sipping his wine, “there
could be no doubt about it. Well; we, in our trifling
with this jingling toy, have had the ill luck to jostle
and fall out. We are not what the world calls friends;
but we are as good and true and loving friends for all
that, as nine out of every ten of those on whom it
bestows the title. You have a niece, and I a son--a fine
lad, Haredale, but foolish. They fall in love with each
other, and form what this same world calls an attach-
ment; meaning a something fanciful and false like all
the rest, which, if it took its own free time, would
break like any other bubble. But it may not have its
own free time—will not, if they are left alone—and the
question is, shall we two, because society calls us
enemies, stand aloof, and let them rush into each other's
arms, when, by approaching each other sensibly, as we
do now, we can prevent it, and part them?”
“I love my niece,” said Mr. Haredale, after a short
silence. “It may sound strangely in your ears; but I
love her.”
“Strangely, my good fellow!" cried Mr. Chester,
lazily filling his glass again, and pulling out his tooth-
pick. “Not at all. I like Ned too-or, as you say, love
him—that's the word among such near relations. I'm
very fond of Ned. He's an amazingly good fellow, and
a handsome fellow-foolish and weak as yet; that's all.
But the thing is, Haredale-for I'll be very frank, as I
told you I would at first-independently of any dislike
that you and I might have to being related to each
other, and independently of the religious differences
between us--and damn it, that's important-I couldn't
afford a match of this description. Ned and I couldn't
do it. It's impossible.”
"Curb your tongue, in God's name, if this conversa-
tion is to last,”retorted Mr. Haredale, fiercely. “I have
said I love my niece. Do you think that, loving her,
I would have her fling her heart away on any man
who had your blood in his veins?".

BARNABY RUDGE.
“ You see,” said the other, not at all disturbed, “the
advantage of being so frank and open. Just what I was
about to add, upon my honour! I am amazingly at-
tached to Ned-quite doat upon him, indeed—and even
if we could afford to throw ourselves away, that very
objection would be quite unsuperable. I wish you'd take
some wine.”
“Mark me,” said Mr. Haredale, striding to the table,
and laying his hand upon it heavily. “If any man be-
lieves—presumes to think—that I, in word, or deed, or in
the wildest dream, ever entertained remotely the idea of
Emma Haredale's favouring the suit of one who
was akin to you—in any way-I care not what-he lies.
He lies, and does me grievous wrong, in the mere
thought.”
“Haredale," returned the other, rocking himself to
and fro as in assent, and nodding at the fire, “it's ex-
tremely manly, and really very generous in you to meet
me in this unreserved and handsome way. Upon my
word, those are exactly my sentiments, only expressed
with much more force and power than I could use-you
know my sluggish nature, and you will forgive me, I am
sure.'
“While I would restrain her from all correspondence
with your son, and sever their intercourse here, though
it should cause her death,” said Mr. Haredale, who had
been pacing to and fro, “I would do it kindly and ten-
derly if I can. I have a trust to discharge which my
nature is not formed to understand, and, for this reason,
the bare fact of there being any love between them
comes upon me to-night, almost for the first time.”
“I am more delighted than I can possibly tell you,”
rejoined Mr. Chester, with the utmost blandness,” to find
my own impression so confirmed. You see the advan-
tage of our having met. We understand each other.
We quite agree. We have a most complete and thorough
explanation, and we know what course to take. Why
don't you taste your tenant's wine? It's really very
good.”
“Pray who,” said Mr. Haredale, “have aided Emma,
or your son? Who are their go-betweens and agents-
do you know?”
"All the good people hereabouts—the neighbourhood
in general, I think,” returned the other, with his most

affable smile. “The messenger I sent to you to-day,
foremost among them all.”
“The idiot? Barnaby?”
“You are surprised? I am glad of that, for I was
rather so myself. Yes. I wrung that from his mother
-a very decent sort of woman–from whom, indeed, I
chiefly learnt how serious the matter had become, and
so determined to ride out here to-day, and hold a parley
with you on this neutral ground. You're stouter than
you used to be, Haredale, but you look extremely well.”
“Our business, I presume, is nearly at an end,” said
Mr. Haredale, with an expression of impatience he was
at no pains to conceal. “Trust me, Mr. Chester, my
niece sħall change from this time. Í will appeal,” he
added, in a lower tone, “to her woman's heart, her
dignity, her pride, her duty-”
“I shall do the same by Ned,” said Mr. Chester, re-
storing some errant faggots to their places in the grate
with the toe of his boot. “If there is anything real in the
world, it is those amazingly fine feelings and those na-
tural obligations which must subsist between father and
son. I shall put it to him on every ground of moral and
religious feeling. I shall represent to him that we can-
not possibly afford it—that I have always looked for-
ward to his marrying well, for a genteel provision for
myself in the autumn of life—that there are a great
many clamourous dogs to pay, whose claims are perfectly
just and right, and who must be paid out of his wife's
fortune. In short, that the very highest and most hon-
ourable feelings of our nature, with every consideration
of filial duty and affection, and all that sort of thing,
imperatively demand that he should run away with an
heiress.”
“ And break her heart as speedily as possible?” said
Mr. Haredale, drawing on his glove.
“There Ned will act exactly as he pleases," returned
the other, sipping his wine; “that's entirely his affair.
I wouldn't for the world interfere with my son, Hare-
dale, beyond a certain point. The relationship between
father and son, you know, is positively quite a holy kind
of bond. Won't you let me persuade you to take one
glass of wine? Well! as you please, as you please,” he
added, helping himself again.
“Chester,” said Mr. Haredale, after a short silence,

during which he had eyed his smiling face from time to
time intently, “ you have the head and heart of an evil
spirit in all matters of deception.”
“Your health!” said the other, with a nod. “But I
have interrupted you—”.
“If now," pursued Mr. Haredale, “ we should find it
difficult to separate these young people, and break off
their intercourse—if, for instance, you find it difficult
on your side, what course do you intend to take?”
“Nothing plainer, my good fellow, nothing easier,”
returned the other, shrugging his shoulders and stretch-
ing himself more comfortably before the fire. “I shall
then exert those powers on which you flatter me so
highly—though, upon my word, I don't deserve your
compliments to their full extent--and resort to a few
little trivial subterfuges for rousing jealousy and re-
sentment. You see?”
“In short, justifying the means by the end, we are,
as a last resource for tearing them asunder, to resort to
treachery and—and lying,” said Mr. Haredale.
“Oh, dear, no. Fie, fie!”returned the other, relishing
a pinch of snuff extremely. “Not lying. Only a little
management, a little diplomacy, a little-intriguing,
that's the word.”
“I wish,” said Mr. Haredale, moving to and fro, and
stopping and moving on again, like one who was ill at
ease, “ that this could have been foreseen or prevented.
But as it has gone so far, and it is necessary for us to
act, it is of no use shrinking or regretting. Well! I
shall second your endeavours to the utmost of my
power. There is one topic in the whole wide range of
human thoughts on which we both agree. We shall act
in concert, but apart. There will be no need, I hope, for
us to meet again.”
“Are you going,” said Mr. Chester, rising with a
graceful indolence. “Let me light you down the stairs.”
“Pray keep your seat,” returned the other, drily, “I
know the way.” So, waving his hand slightly, and
putting on his hat as he turned upon his heel, he went
clanking out as he had come, shut the door behind him,
and tramped down the echoing stairs.
"Pah! A very coarse animal, indeed!” said Mr. Ches-
ter, composing himself in the easy chair again, “Ą
rough brute. Quite a human badger!”

John Willet and his friends, who had been listening
intently for the clash of swords or firing of pistols in
the great room, and had indeed settled the order in
which they should rush in when summoned-in which
procession old John had carefully arranged that he
should bring up the rear-were very much astonished
to see Mr. Haredale come down without a scratch, call
for his horse, and ride away thoughtfully at a footpace.
After some consideration it was decided that he had
left the gentleman above, for dead, and had adopted
this stratagem to divert suspicion or pursuit.
As this conclusion involved the necessity of their
going up-stairs forth with, they were about to ascend in
the order they had agreed upon, when a smart ringing
at the guest's bell, as if he had pulled it vigourously,
overthrew all their speculations, and involved them in
great uncertainty and doubt. At length Mr. Willet
agreed to go up-stairs himself, escorted by Hugh
and Barnaby, as the strongest and stoutest fellows on
the premises, who were to make their appearance under
pretence of clearing away the glasses.
Under this protection, the brave and broad-faced John
boldly entered the room, half a foot in advance, and
received an order for a boot-jack without trembling,
but when it was brought, and he lent his sturdy shoulder
to the guest, Mr. Willet was observed to look very hard
into his boots as he pulled them off, and, by opening his
eyes much wider than usual, to appear to express some
surprise and disappointment at not finding them full
of blood. He took occasion, too, to examine the gentle-
man as closely as he could, expecting to discover sundry
loop-holes in his person, pierced by his adversary's
sword. Finding none, however, and observing in course
of time that his guest was as cool and unruffled, both in
his dress and temper, as he had been all day, old John
at last heaved a deep sigh, and began to think no duel
had been fought that night.
“And now, Willet,” said Mr. Chester, “if the room's
well aired, I'll try the merits of that famous bed.”
“The room, sir,” returned John, taking up a candle,
and nudging Barnaby and Hugh to accompany them,
in case the gentleman should unexpectedly drop down
faint or dead from some internal wound, “the room's
as warm as any toast in a tankard. Barnaby, take you

that other candle, and go on before. Hugh, follow up,
sir, with the easy chair.”
In this order—and still, in his earnest inspection, hold-
ing his candle very close to the guest; now making him
feel extremely warm about the legs, now threatening
to set his wig on fire, and constantly begging his pardon
with great awkwardness and embarrassment-John led
the party to the best bed-room, which was nearly as
large as the chamber from which they had come, and
held, drawn out near the fire for warmth, a great old
spectral bedstead, hung with faded brocade, and orna-
mented, at the top of each carved post, with a plume of
feathers that had once been white, but with dust and
age had now grown hearse-like and funereal.
“Good-night, my friends," said Mr. Chester, with a
sweet smile, seating himself, when he had surveyed the
room from end to end, in the easy chair which his at-
tendants wheeled before the fire. “Good-night! Barnaby,
my good fellow, you say some prayers before you go to
bed, I hope?"
Barnaby nodded. “He has some nonsense that he
calls his prayers, sir," returned old John, officiously.
“I'm afraid there ain't much good in 'em.”'
“And Hugh?” said Mr. Chester, turning to him.
“Not 1,” he answered. “I know his "-pointing to
Barnaby—“they're well enough. He sings 'em some-
times in the straw. I listen.”
“He's quite a animal, sir,” John whispered in his ear,
with dignity. “You'll excuse him, I'm sure. If he has
any soul at all, sir, it must be such a very small one, that
it don't signify what he does or doesn't in that way.
Good-night, sir!"
The guest rejoined “God bless you!" with a fervour
that was quite affecting; and John, beckoning his guards
to go before, bowed himself out of the room, and left
him to his rest in the Maypole's ancient bed.

CHAPTER XIII.
IF Joseph Willet, the denounced and proscribed of
’prentices, had happened to be at home when his father's
courtly guest presented himself before the Maypole door
—that is, if it had not perversely chanced to be one of the
half-dozen days in the whole year on which he was at
liberty to absent himself for as many hours without
question or reproach-he would have contrived, by hook
or crook, to dive to the very bottom of Mr. Chester's
mystery, and to come at his purpose with as much cer-
tainty as though he had been his confidential adviser.
In that fortunate case, the lovers would have had quick
warning of the ills that threatened them, and the aid of
various timely and wise suggestions to boot; for all
Joe's readiness of thought and action, and all his sym-
pathies and good wishes, were enlisted in favor of the
young people, and were staunch in devotion to their
cause. Whether this disposition arose out of his old pre-
possessions in favour of the young lady, whose history
had surrounded her in his mind, almost from his cradle,
with circumstances of unusual interest; or from his at-
tachment towards the young gentleman, into whose con-
fidence he had, through his shrewdness and alacrity,
and the rendering of sundry important services as a spy
and messenger, almost imperceptibly glided; whether
they had their origin in either of these sources, or in
the habit natural to youth, or in the constant badgering
and worrying of his venerable parent, or in any hidden
little love affair of his own which gave him something
of a fellow feeling in the matter, it is needless to inquire
-especially as Joe was out of the way, and had no op-
portunity on that particular occasion of testifying to his
sentiments either on one side or the other.
It was in fact the twenty-fifth of March, which, as
most people know to their cost, is and has been time out
of mind, one of those unpleasant epochs termed quarter-
days. On this twenty-fifth of March, it was John
Willet's pride annually to settle, in hard cash, his ac-
count with a certain vintner and distiller in the city of
London; to give into whose hands a canvas bag con-

taining the exact amount, and not a penny more or less,
was the end and object of a journey for Joe, so surely
as the year and day came round.
This journey was performed upon an old grey mare,
concerning whom John had an indistinct set of ideas
hovering about him, to the effect that she could win a
plate or cup if she tried. She never had tried, and
probably never would now, being some fourteen or fif-
teen years of age, short in wind, long in body, and
rather the worse for wear in respect of her mane and
tail. Notwithstanding these slight defects, John per-
fectly gloried in the animal; and when she was brought
round to the door by Hugh, actually retired into the
bar, and there, in a secret grove of lemons, laughed with
pride.
“There's a bit of horseflesh, Hugh!” said John, when
he had recovered enough self-command to appear at the
door again. “There's a comely creatur! There's high
mettle! There's bone!”
There was bone enough beyond all doubt; and so Hugh
seemed to think, as he sat sideways in the saddle, lazily
doubled up with his chin nearly touching his knees;
and heedless of the dangling stirrups and loose bridle-
rein, sauntered up and down on the little green before
the door.
“Mind you take good care of her, sir,” said John, ap-
pealing from this insensible person to his son and heir,
who now appeared, fully equipped and ready. “Don't
you ride hard.”
"I should be puzzled to do that, I think, father,” Joe
replied, casting a disconsolate look at the animal.
“None of your impudence, sir, if you please,” retorted
old John. "What would you ride, sir? A wild ass or
zebra would be too tame for you, wouldn't he, eh, sir?
You'd like to ride a roaring lion, wouldn't you, sir, eh,
sir? Hold your tongue, sir.” When Mr. Willet, in his
differences with his son, had exhausted all the questions
that occurred to him, and Joe had said nothing at all
in answer, he generally wound up by bidding him hold
his tongue.
“And what does the boy mean," added Mr. Willet,
after he had stared at him for a little time, in a species
of stupefaction, “by cocking his hat to such an extent!
Are you a going to kill the wintner, sir?”

“No,” said Joe, tartly; “ I'm not. Now your mind's
at ease, father.”
“With a milintary air, too!” said Mr. Willet, survey.
ing him from top to toe; “ with a swaggering, fire-eat-
ing, biling-water drinking sort of way with him! And
what do you mean by pulling up the crocuses and snow-
drops, eh, sir?”
"It's only a nosegay,” said Joe, reddening. “There's
no harm in that, I hope?”
“You're a boy of business, you are, sir!" said Mr.
Willet, disdainfully, “to go supposing that wintners
care for nosegays.”
“I don't suppose anything of the kind,” returned Joe.
“Let them keep their red noses for bottles and tankards.
These are going to Mr. Varden's house."
"And do you suppose he minds such things as cro-
cuses?" demanded John.
“I don't know, and to say the truth, I don't care,"
said Joe. “Come father, give me the money, and in
the name of patience let me go."
“There it is, sir," replied John; “and take care of it;
and mind you don't make too much haste back, but
give the mare a long rest. Do you mind?”
“Ay, I mind,” returned Joe. “She'll need it, Heaven
knows."
“And don't you score up too much at the Black Lion,”
said Joe. “Mind that too."
“Then why don't you let me have some money of my
own?” retorted Joe, sorrowfully; "why don't you, father?
What do you send me into London for, giving me only
the right to call for my dinner at the Black Lion, which
you're to pay for the next time you go, as if I was not
to be trusted with a few shillings? Why do you use me
like this? It's not right of you. You can't expect me
to be quiet under it.”
“Let him have money!” cried John, in a drowsy re-
verie. “What does he call money-guineas? Hasn't
he got money? Over and above the tolls, hasn't he one
and sixpence?"
“One and sixpence!” repeated his son, contemptuously.
“Yes, sir," returned John, “one and sixpence. When
I was your age, I had never seen so much money, in a
heap. A shilling of it is in case of accidents—the mare
casting a shoe, or the like of that. The other sixpence

is to spend in the diversions of London; and the diver-
sion I recommend is going to the top of the Monument,
and sitting there. There's no temptation there, sir-no
drink-no young women-no bad characters of any sort
-nothing but imagination. That's the way I enjoyed
myself when I was your age, sir."
To this, Joe made no answer, but beckoning Hugh,
leaped into the saddle and rode away; and a very stal-
wart, manly horseman he looked, deserving a better
charger than it was his fortune to bestride. John stood
staring after him, or rather after the grey mare (for he
had no eyes for her rider), until man and beast had been
out of sight some twenty minutes, when he began to
think they were gone, and slowly re-entering the house,
fell into a gentle doze.
The unfortunate grey mare, who was the agony of
Joe's life, floundered along at her own will and pleasure
until the Maypole was no longer visible, and then, con-
tracting her legs into what in a puppet would have been
looked upon as a clumsy and awkward imitation of a
canter, mended her pace all at once, and did it of her
own accord. The acquaintance with her rider's usual
mode of proceeding, which suggested this improvement
in hers, impelled her likewise to turn up a bye-way,
leading—not to London, but through lanes running
parallel with the road they had come, and passing
within a few hundred yards of the Maypole, which led
finally to an inclosure surrounding a large, old, red-brick
mansion—the same of which mention was made as the
Warren in the first chapter of this history. Coming to
a dead stop in a little copse thereabout, she suffered her
rider to dismount with right good-will, and to tie her to
the trunk of a tree.
“Stay there, old girl,” said Joe, “and let us see
whether there's any little commission for me to-day.”
So saying, he left her to browze upon such stunted grass
and weeds as happened to grow within the length of her
tether, and passing through a wicket gate, entered the
grounds on foot.
The pathway, after a very few minutes' walking,
brought him close to the house, towards which, and
especially towards one particular window, he directed
many covert glances. It was a dreary, silent building,
with echoing courtyards, desolated turret-chambers,

and whole suites of rooms shut up and mouldering to ruin.
The terrace-garden, dark with the shade of overhang-
ing trees, had an air of melancholy that was quite op-
pressive. Great iron gates, disused for many years, and
red with rust, drooping on their hinges and overgrown
with long rank grass, seemed as though they tried to
sink into the ground, and hide their fallen state among
the friendly weeds. The fantastic monsters on the walls,
green with age and damp, and covered here and there
with moss, looked grim and desolate. There was a
sombre aspect even on that part of the mansion which
was inhabited and kept in good repair, that struck the
beholder with a sense of sadness; of something forlorn
and failing, whence cheerfulness was banished. It would
have been difficult to imagine a bright fire blazing in the
dull and darkened rooms, to picture any gaiety of heart
or revelry that the frowning walls shut in. It seemed a
place where such things had been, but could be no more
-the very ghost of a house, haunting the old spot in its
old outward form, and that was all.
Much of this decayed and sombre look was attributa-
ble, no doubt, to the death of its former master, and the
temper of its present occupant; but remembering the
tale connected with the mansion, it seemed the very
place for such a deed, and one that might have been its
predestined theatre years upon years ago. Viewed with
reference to this legend, the sheet of water where the
steward's body had been found appeared to wear a black
and sullen character, such as no other pool might own;
the bell upon the roof, that had told the tale of murder
to the midnight-wind, became a very phantom whose
voice would raise the listener's hair on end; and every
leafless bough that nodded to another had its stealthy
whispering of the crime.
Joe paced up and down the path, sometimes stopping
in affected contemplation of the building or the prospect,
sometimes leaning against a tree with an assumed air
of idleness and indifference, but always keeping an eye
upon the window he had singled out at first. After some
quarter of an hour's delay, a small white hand was
waved to him for an instant from this casement, and the
young man, with a respectful bow, departed; saying
under his breath, as he crossed his horse again, “No
errand for me to-day!”

But the air of smartness, the cock of the hat to which
John Willet had objected, and the spring nosegay, all
betokened some little errand of his own, having a more
interesting object than a vintner or even a locksmith.
So, indeed, it turned out; for when he had settled with
the vintner—whose place of business was down in some
deep cellars hard by Thames Street, and who was as pur-
ple-faced an old gentleman as if he had all his life sup-
ported their arched roof on his head—when he had
settled the account, and taken the receipt, and declined
tasting more than three glasses of old sherry, to the un-
bounded astonishment of the purple-face vintner, who,
gimlet in hand, had projected an attack upon at least a
score of dusty casks, and who stood transfixed, or mo-
rally gimleted as it were, to his own wall—when he had
done all this, and disposed besides of a frugal dinner at
the Black Lion in Whitechapel; spurning the Monument
and John's advice, he turned his steps towards the lock-
smith's house, attracted by the eyes of blooming Dolly
Varden.
Joe was by no means a sheepish fellow, but, for all that,
when he got to the corner of the street in which the lock-
smith lived, he could by no means make up his mind to
walk straight to the house. First he resolved to stroll up
another street for five minutes, then up another street for
five minutes more, and so on until he had lost full half
an hour, when he made a bold plunge and found himself
with a red face and a beating heart in the smoky work-
shop.
"Joe Willet, or his ghost?" said Varden, rising from
the desk at which he was busy with his books, and look-
ing at him under his spectacles. “Which is it? Joe in
the flesh, eh? That's hearty. And how are all the Chig-
well company, Joe?”
“Much as usual, sir—they and I agree as well as
ever.”
“Well, well!” said the locksmith. “We must be
patient, Joe, and bear with old folks' foibles. How's
the mare, Joe? Does she do the four miles an hour as
easily as ever? Ha, ha, ha! Does she, Joe? Eh! What
have we there, Joe-a nosegay!"
“A very poor one, sir-I thought Miss Dolly ”
“No, no," said Gabriel, dropping his voice, and
shaking his head, “not' Dolly, Give 'em to her

mother. Would you mind giving 'em to Mrs. Varden,
Joe?”
“Oh, no, sir,” Joe replied, and endeavouring, but not
with the greatest possible success, to hide his disappoint-
ment. “I shall be very glad, I'm sure.”
“That's right,” said the locksmith, patting him on the
back. “It don't matter who has 'em, Joe?"
“Not a bit, sir.” Dear heart, how the words stuck in
his throat !
“Come in,” said Gabriel. “I have just been called to
tea. She's in the parlour.”
“She,” thought Joe. “Which of 'em, I wonder—Mrs.
or Miss ?” The locksmith settled the doubt as nearly as
if it had been expressed aloud, by leading him to the
door, and saying, “Martha, my dear, here's young
Mr. Willet.”
Now, Mrs. Varden, regarding the Maypole as a sort of
human man-trap, or decoy for husbands; viewing its
proprietor, and all who aided and abetted him, in the
light of so many poachers among Christian men; and
believing, moreover, that the publicans coupled with
sinners in Holy Writ were veritable lincensed victual-
lers, was far from being favourably disposed towards her
visitor. Wherefore she was taken faint directly; and
being duly presented with the crocuses and snowdrops,
divined on further consideration that they were the oc-
casion of the languor which had seized upon her spirits.
“I'm afraid I couldn't bear the room another minute,"
said the good lady, “if they remained here. Would
you excuse my putting them out of window ?”
Joe begged she wouldn't mention it on any account,
and smiled feebly as he saw them deposited on the sill
outside. If anybody could have known the pains he had
taken to make up that despised and misused bunch of
flowers !
“I feel it quite a relief to get rid of them, I assure
you," said Mrs. Varden. “I'm better already.” And
indeed she did appear to have plucked up her spirits.
Joe expressed his gratitude to Providence for this
favourable dispensation, and tried to look as if he didn't
wonder where Dolly was.
“You're sad people at Chigwell, Mr. Joseph," said
Mrs. V.
“I hope not, ma'am," returned Joe.

"You're the cruellest and most inconsiderate people
in the world,” said Mrs. Varden, bridling. “I wonder
old Mr. Willet, having been a married man himself,
doesn't know better than to conduct himself as he does.
His doing it for profit is no excuse. I would rather pay
the money twenty times over, and have Varden come
home like a respectable and sober tradesman. If there
is one character,” said Mrs. Varden with great emphasis,
“that offends and disgusts me more than another, it is
a sot.”
“Come, Martha, my dear,” said the locksmith cheerily,
“let us have tea, and don't let us talk about sots. There
are none here, and Joe don't want to hear about them,
I dare say."
At this crisis, Miggs appeared with toast.
“I dare say he does not,” said Mrs. Varden; "and I
dare say you do not, Varden. It's a very unpleasant
subject, I have no doubt, though I won't say its per-
sonal”—Miggs coughed—“whatever I may be forced to
think”—Miggs sneezed expressively. “You never will
know, Varden, and nobody at young Mr. Willet's age-
you'll excuse me, sir-can be expected to know, what
a woman suffers when she is waiting at home under
such circumstances. If you don't believe me, as I know
you don't, here's Miggs, who is only too often a witness
of it—ask her.”
“Oh! she were very bad the other night, sir, indeed
she were,” said Miggs. “If you hadn't the sweetness
of an angel in you, mim, I don't think you could abear
it, I raly don't,"
“Miggs,” said Mrs. Varden, “you're profane."
“ Begging your pardon, mim," returned Miggs, with
shrill rapidity, “such was not my intentions, and such
I hope is not my character, though I am but a servant."
“Answering me, Miggs, and providing yourself,"
retorted her mistress, looking round with dignity, “is
one and the same thing. How dare you speak of angels
in connection with your sinful fellow-beings—mere”—
said Mrs. Varden, glancing at herself in a neighbouring
mirror, and arranging the ribbon of her cap in a more
becoming fashion—“ mere worms and grovellers as we
are!”
“I did not intend, mim, if you please, to give offence,"
said Miggs, confident in the strength of her compliment,

and developing strongly in the throat as usual, "and I
did not expect it would be took as such. I hope I know
my own unworthiness, and that I hate and despise
myself and all my fellow-creatures as every practical
Christian should.”
“You'll have the goodness, if you please,” said Mrs.
Varden, loftily, “ to step up stairs and see if Dolly has
finished dressing, and to tell her that the chair that
was ordered for her will be here in a minute, and that
if she keeps it waiting, I shall send it away that instant.
I'm sorry to see that you don't take your tea, Varden,
and that you don't take yours, Mr. Joseph; though of
course it would be foolish for me to expect that any-
thing that can be had at home, and in the company
of females, would please you."
This pronoun was understood in the plural sense, and
included both gentlemen, upon both of whom it was
rather hard and undeserved, for Gabriel had applied
himself to the meal with a very promising appetite, until
it was spoilt by Mrs. Varden herself, and Joe had as
great a liking for the female society of the locksmith's
house-or for a part of it at all events—as man could
well entertain.
But he had no opportunity to say anything in his own
defence, for at that moment Dolly herself appeared, and
struck him quite dumb with her beauty. Never had
Dolly looked so handsome as she did then, in all the
glow and grace of youth, with all her charms increased
a hundred fold by a most becoming dress, by a thousand
little coquettish ways which nobody could assume with a
better grace, and all the sparkling expectation of that
accursed party. It is impossible to tell how Joe hated
that party, wherever it was, and the people who were
going to it, whoever they were.
And she hardly looked at him-no, hardly looked at
him. And when the chair was seen through the open
door coming blundering into the workshop, she actually
clapped her hands and seemed glad to go. But Joe gave
her his arm—there was some comfort in that-and
handed her into it. To see her seat herself inside, with
her laughing eyes brighter than diamonds, and her hand
-surely she had the prettiest hand in the world-on the
ledge of the open window, and her little finger provok-
ingly and pertly tilted up, as if it wondered why Joe

didn't squeeze or kiss it! To think how well one or two
of the modest snowdrops would have become that deli-
cate bodice, and how they were laying neglected outside
the parlour window! To see how Miggs looked on, with
a face expressive of knowing how all this loveliness was
got up, and of being in the secret of every string and
pin and hook and eye, and of saying it ain't half as real
as you think, and I could look quite as well myself if I
took the pains! To hear that provoking, precious little
scream when the chair was hoisted on its poles, and to
catch that transient but not-to-be-forgotten vision of the
happy face within—what torments and aggravations,
and yet what delights were these! The very chairmen
seemed favoured rivals as they bore her down the street.
There never was such an alteration in a small room in
a small time as in that parlour when they went back to
finish tea. So dark, so deserted, so perfectly disen-
chanted. It seemed such sheer nonsense to be sitting
tamely there, when she was at a dance with more lovers
than man could calculate fluttering about her—with the
whole party doting on and adoring her, and wanting to
marry her. Miggs was hovering about, too; and the
fact of her existence, the mere circumstance of her ever
having been born, appeared, after Dolly, such an unac-
countable practical joke. It was impossible to talk. It
couldn't be done. He had nothing left for it but to stir
his tea round, and round, and round, and ruminate on
all the fascinations of the locksmith's lovely daughter.
Gabriel was dull, too. It was a part of the certain un-
certainty of Mrs. Varden's temper, that when they were
in this condition, she should be gay and sprightly.
“I need have a cheerful disposition, I am sure,” said
the smiling housewife, “to preserve any spirits at all;
and how I do it I can scarcely tell.”
“Ah, mim,” sighed Migg, “ begging your pardon for
the interruption, “there an't a many like you.”
“Take away, Miggs,” said Mrs. Varden, rising, “take
away, pray. I know I'm a restraint here, and as I wish
everybody to enjoy themselves as they best can, I feel I
had better go.”
“No, no, Martha,” cried the locksmith. “Stop here.
I'm sure we shall be very sorry to lose you, eh, Joe!”
Joe started and said, “ Certainly."
"Thank you, Varden, my dear,” returned his wife;

“but I know your wishes better. Tobacco and beer, or
spirits, have much greater attractions than any I can
boast of, and therefore I shall go and sit up stairs and
look out of window, my love. Good-night, Mr. Joseph.
I'm very glad to have seen you, and only wish I could
have provided something more suitable to your taste.
Remember me very kindly, if you please, to old Mr.
Willet, and tell him that whenever he comes here I have
a crow to pluck with him. Good-night!”
Having uttered these words with great sweetness of
manner, the good lady dropped a curtsey remarkable
for its condescension, and serenely withdrew.
And it was for this Joe had looked forward to the
twenty-fifth of March for weeks and weeks, and had
gathered the flowers with so much care, and had cocked
his hat, and made himself so smart! This was the end
of all his bold determination, resolved upon for the
hundredth time, to speak out to Dolly and tell her how
he loved her! To see her for a minute-for but a minute
-to find her going out to a party and glad to go; to be
looked upon as a common pipe-smoker, beer-bibber,
spirit-guzzler, and tosspot! He bade farewell to his
friend, the locksmith, and hastened to take horse at the
Black Lion, thinking, as he turned towards home, as
many another Joe has thought before and since, that here
was an end to all his hopes, that the thing was impossible
and never could be-that she didn't care for him—that he
was wretched for life—and that the only congenial
prospect left him was to go for a soldier or a sailor, and
get some obliging enemy to knock his brains out as soon
as possible.

CHAPTER XIV.
JOE WILLET rode leisurely along in his desponding
mood, picturing the locksmith's daughter going down
long country dances, and poussetting dreadfully with
bold strangers—which was almost too much to bear-
when he heard the tramp of a horse's feet behind him,
and looking back, saw a well-mounted gentleman ad-
vancing at a smart canter. As this rider passed, he
checked his speed, and called him of the Maypole by his
name. Joe set spurs to the grey mare, and was at his
side directly.
“I thought it was you, sir,” he said, touching his hat.
“A fair evening, sir. Glad to see you out of doors,
again.”
The gentleman smiled and nodded. “What gay do-
ings have been going on to-day, Joe? Is she as pretty
as ever? Nay, don't blush, man.”.
“If I coloured at all, Mr. Edward,” said Joe, “which
I didr.'t know I did, it was to think I should have been
such a fool as ever to have any hope of her. She's as
far out of my reach as-heaven is."
“Well, Joe, I hope that's not altogether beyond it,"
said Edward, good-humouredly. “Eh ?”
“Ah!" sighed Joe. “It's all very fine talking, sir.
Proverbs are easily made in cold blood. But it can't be
helped. Are you bound for our house, sir?"
“Yes. As I am not quite strong yet, I shall stay
there to-night, and ride home coolly in the morning.”
“If you're in no particular hurry,” said Joe, after a
short silence, “and will bear with the pace of this poor
jade, I shall be glad to ride on with you to the Warren,
sir, and hold your horse when you dismount. It'll save
you from having to walk from the Maypole, there and
back again. I can spare the time well, sir, for I am too
soon.”
“ And so am I," returned Edward, “ though I was un-
consciously riding fast just now, in compliment I sup-
pose to the pace of my thoughts, which were travelling
fast. We will keep together, Joe, willingly, and be as
good company as may be. And cheer up, cheer up,

think of the locksmith's daughter with a stout heart.
and you shall win her yet.”
Joe shook his head; but there was something so cheery
in the buoyant, hopeful manner of this speech, that his
spirits rose under its influence, and communicated as it
would seem some new impulse even to the grey mare,
who, breaking from her sober amble into a gentle trot,
emulated the pace of Edward Chester's horse, and ap-
peared to flatter herself that he was doing his very best.
It was a fine dry night, and the light of a young
moon, which was then just rising, shed around that
peace and tranquility which gives to evening time its
most delicious charm. The lengthened shadows of the
trees, softened as if reflected in still water, threw their
carpet on the path the travellers pursued, and the light
wind stirred yet more softly than before, as though it
were soothing Nature in her sleep. By little and little
they ceased talking, and rode on side by side in a pleas-
ant silence.
“The Maypole lights are brilliant to-night,” said
Edward, as they rode along the lane from which, while
the intervening trees were bare of leaves, that hostelry
was visible.
“Brilliant indeed, sir,” returned Joe, rising in his
stirrups to get a better view. “Lights in the large
room, and a fire glimmering in the best bed-chamber?
Why, what company can this be for, I wonder!”
“Some benighted horseman wending towards London,
and deterred from going on to-night by the marvellous
tales of my friend, the highwayman, I suppose,” said
Edward.
“He must be a horseman of good quality to have such
accommodations. Your bed too, sir?"
“No matter, Joe. Any other room will do for me.
But come—there's nine striking. We may push on.”
They cantered forward at as brisk a pace as Joe's
charger could attain, and presently stopped at the little
copse where he had left her in the morning. Edward
dismounted, gave his bridle to his companion, and
walked with a light step towards the house.
A female servant was waiting at a side gate in the
garden-wall, and admitted him without delay. He
hurried along the terrace-walk, and darted up a flight of
broad steps leading into an old and gloomy hall, whose

walls were ornamented with rusty suits of armour,
äntlers, weapons of the chase, and such like garniture.
Here he paused, but not long; for as he looked round,
as if expecting the attendant to have followed, and
wondering she had not done so, a lovely girl appeared,
whose dark hair next moment rested on his breast.
Almost at the same instant a heavy hand was laid upon
her arm, Edward felt himself thrust away, and Mr.
Haredale stood between them.
He regarded the young man sternly without reinoving
his hat; with one hand clasped his niece, and with the
other, in which he held his riding-whip, motioned him
towards the door. The young man drew himself up,
and returned his gaze.
“ This is well done of you, sir, to corrupt my servants,
and enter iny house unbidden and in secret, like a thief!"
said Mr. Haredale. “Leave it, sir, and return no more.”
“Miss Haredale's presence,” returned the young man,
“and your relationship to her, give you a licence which,
if you are a brave man, you will not abuse. You have
compelled me to this course, and the fault is yours—not
mine.”
“It is neither generous, nor honourable, nor the act of
a true man, sir," retorted the other, “ to tamper with
the affections of a weak, trusting girl, while you shrink,
in your unworthiness, from her guardian and protector,
and dare not meet the light of day. More than this Í
will not say to you, save that I forbid you this house,
and require you to be gone."
“It is neither generous, nor honourable, nor the act
of a true man to play the spy,” said Edward. “Your
words imply dishonour, and I reject them with the scorn
they merit.”
"You will find,” said Mr. Haredale, calmly, “your
trusty go-between in waiting at the gate by which you
entered. I have played no spy's part, sir. I chanced to
see you pass the gate, and followed. You might have
heard me knocking for admission, had you been less
swift of foot, or lingered in the garden. Please to with-
draw. Your presence here is offensive to me and dis-
tressful to my niece.” As he said these words, he passed
his arm about the waist of the terrified and weeping
girl, and drew her closer to him; and though the habitual
severity of his manner was scarcely changed, there was

yet apparent in the action an air of kindness and sym-
pathy for her distress.
“Mr. Haredale,” said Edward, “your arm encircles
her on whom I have set my every hope and thought,
and to purchase one minute's happiness for whom I
would gladly lay down my life; this house is the casket
that holds the precious jewel of my existence. Your
niece has plighted her faith to me, and I have plighted
mine to her. What have I done that you should hold
me in this light esteem, and give me these discourteous
words?”
- You have done that, sir,” answered Mr. Haredale,
" which must be undone. You have tied a lover's knot
here which must be cutasunder. Take good heed of what
I say. Must. I cancel the bond between ye. I reject
you, and all of your kith and kin—all false, hollow,
heartless stock."
“ High words, sir,” said Edward, scornfully.
5 Words of purpose and meaning, as you will find,”
replied the other. “ Lay them to heart.”
* Lay you then, these," said Edward. “Your cold and
sullen temper, which chills every breast about you,
which turns affection into fear, and changes duty into
dread, has forced us on this secret course, repugnant to
our nature and our wish, and far more foreign, sir, to us
than you. I am not a false, a hollow, or a heartless man;
the character is yours, who poorly venture on these in-
jurious terms, against the truth, and under the shelter
whereof I reminded you just now. You shall not cancel
the bond between us. I will not abandon this pursuit.
I rely upon your niece's truth and honour, and set your
influence at nought. I leave her with a confidence in
her pure faith, which you will never weaken, and with
no concern but that I do not leave her in some gentler
care.”
With that he pressed her cold hand to his lips, and once
more encountering and returning Mr. Haredale's steady
look, withdrew.
A few words to Joe as he mounted his horse sufficiently
explained what had passed, and renewed all that young
gentleman's despondency with tenfold aggravation.
They rode back to the Maypole without exchanging a
syllable, and arrived at the door with heavy hearts.

as they rode up, shouting for Hugh, was out directly, and
said with great importance as he held the young man's
stirrup:
“He's comfortable in bed—the best bed. A thorough
gentleman; the smilingest, affablest gentleman I ever
had to do with.”
“Who, Willet?” said Edward, carelessly, as he dis-
mounted.
“Your worthy father, sir,” replied John. “Your hon-
ourable, venerable father.”
“What does he mean?” said Edward, looking with a
mixture of alarm and doubt at Joe.
“What do you mean?” said Joe. “Don't you see Mr.
Edward doesn't understand, father?'
“Why, didn't you know of it, sir?” said John, opening
his eyes wide. “How very singular! Bless you, he's
been here ever since noon to-day, and Mr. Haredale has
been having a long talk with him, and hasn't been gone
an hour.”
“My father, Willet!”
“Yes, sir, he told me soma handsome, slim, upright
gentleman in green-and-gold. In your room up yonder,
sir. No doubt you can go in, sir,” said John, walking
backwards into the road and looking up at the window.
“He hasn't put out his candles yet, I see.”
Edward glanced at the window also, and hastily mur-
muring that he had changed his mind-forgotten some-
thing—and must return to London, mounted his horse
again and rode away; leaving the Willets, father and
son, looking at each other in mute astonishment.

CHAPTER XV.
At noon next day John Willet's guest sat lingering
over his breakfast in his own home, surrounded by a
variety of comforts, which left the Maypole's highest
flight and utmost stretch of accommodation at an infinite
distance behind, and suggested comparisons very much
to the disadvantage and disfavour of that venerable
tavern.
In the broad, old-fashioned window-seat—as capacious
as many modern sofas, and cushioned to serve the
purpose of a luxurious settee-in the broad old-fashioned
window-seat of a roomy chamber Mr. Chester lounged,
very much at his ease, over a well-furnished breakfast-
table. He had exchanged his riding-coat for a hand-
some morning gown, his boots for slippers ; had been at
great pains to atone for the having been obliged to make
his toilet when he rose without the aid of dressing-case
and tiring equipage; and having gradually forgotten
through these means the discomforts of an indifferent
night and an early ride, was in a state of perfect com-
placency, indolence, and satisfaction.
The situation in which he found himself, indeed, was
particularly favourable to the growth of those feelings,
for, not to mention the lazy influence of a late and
lonely breakfast, with the additional sedative of a news-
paper, there was an air of repose about his place of
residence peculiar to itself, and which hangs about it
even in these times, when it is more bustling and busy
than it was in days of yore.
There are still worse places than the Temple on a
sultry day for basking in the sun or resting idly in the
shade. There is yet a drowsiness in its courts and a
dreamy dullness in its trees and gardens; those who
pace its lanes and squares may yet hear the echoes of
their footsteps on the sounding stones, and read upon its
gates, in passing from the tumult of the Strand or Fleet
Street, “Who enters here leaves noise behind.” There
is still the plash of falling water in fair Fountain Court,
and there are yet nooks and corners where dun-haunted

students may look down from their dusty garrets on a
vagrant ray of sunlight patching the shade of the tall
houses, and seldom troubled to reflect a passing
stranger's form. There is yet in the Temple something
of a clerkly, monkish atmosphere, which public offices
of law have not disturbed, and even legal firms have
failed to scare away. In summer time its pumps suggest
to thirsty idlers springs cooler, and more sparkling, and
deeper than other wells; and as they trace the spillings
of full pitchers on the heated ground, they snuff the
freshness, and, sighing, cast sad looks towards the
Thames, and think of baths and boats, and saunter on
despondent.
It was in a room in Paper Buildings—a row of goodly
tenements, shaded in front by ancient trees, and look-
ing, at the back, upon the Temple Gardens-that this,
our idler, lounged; now taking up again the paper he
had laid down a hundred times; now trifling with the
fragments of his meal; now pulling forth his golden
toothpick, and glancing leisurely about the room, or out
at window into the trim garden walks, where a few
early loiterers were already pacing to and fro. Here a
pair of lovers met to quarrel and make up; there a dark-
eyed nursery-maid had better eyes for Templars than
her charge; on this hand an ancient spinster, with her
lapdog in a string, regarded both enormities with scorn-
ful sidelong looks; on that a weazen old gentleman,
ogling the nursery-maid, looked with like scorn upon
the spinster, and wondered she didn't know she was no
longer young. Apart from all these, on the river's mar-
gin two or three couple of business-talkers walked slowly
up and down in earnest conversation; and one young
man sat thoughtfully on a bench, alone.
“Ned is amazingly patient!” said Mr. Chester, glanc-
ing at this last-named person as he set down his teacup
and plied the golden toothpick, “immensely patient!
He was sitting yonder when I began to dress, and has
scarcely changed his posture since. A most eccentric
dog!"
Ăs he spoke the figure rose and came towards him
with a rapid pace.
: “Really, as if he had heard me,” said the father, re-
suming his newspaper with a yawn. “Dear Ned!"
Presently the room-door opened, and the young man

entered; to whom his father gently waved his hand and
smiled.
“Are you at leisure for a little conversation, sir?” said
Edward.
“Surely, Ned. I am always at leisure. You know my
constitution. Have you breakfasted ?”
“Three hours ago.”
“What a very early dog!” cried his father, contem-
plating him from behind the toothpick, with a languid
smile.
“ The truth is,” said Edward, bringing a chair forward,
and seating himself near the table, “that I slept but ill
last night, and was glad to rise. The cause of my un-
easiness cannot but be known to you, sir; and it is upon
that I wish to speak.”
“My dear boy,” returned his father, “ confide in me,
I beg. But you know my constitution-don't be prosy,
Ned.”
“I will be plain and brief,” said Edward.
“Don't say you will, my good fellow,” returned his
father, crossing his legs, " or you certainly will not.
You are going to tell me,”
“Plainly this, then,” said the son, with an air of great
concern, " that I know where you were last night-from
being on the spot, indeed—and whom you saw, and what
your purpose was.”
“You don't say so!” cried his father. “Iam delighted
to hear it. It saves us the worry, and terrible wear and
tear of a long explanation, and is a great relief for both.
At the very house! Why didn't you come up? I should
have been charmed to see you."
“I knew that what I had to say would be better said
after a night's reflection, when both of us were cool,”
returned the son.
6. 'Fore Gad, Ned,” rejoined the father, “I was cool
enough last night. That detestable Maypole! By some
infernal contrivance of the builder, it holds the wind and
keeps it fresh. You remember the sharp east wind that
blew so hard five weeks ago? I give you my honour it
was rampant in that old house last night, though out of
doors there was a dead calm. But you were saying,”
6. I was about to say, Heaven knows how seriously
and earnestly, that you have made me wretched, sir.
Will you hear me gravely for a moment?"

“My dear Ned,” said his father, “I will hear you with
the patience of an anchorite. Oblige me with the milk.”
“I saw Miss Haredale last night," Edward resumed,
when he had complied with this request; “her uncle,
in her presence, immediately after your interview, and,
as of course I know, in consequence of it, forbade me
the house, and, with circumstances of indignity which
are of your creation, I am sure, commanded me to leave
it on the instant.”
“For his manner of doing so, I give you my honour,
Ned, I am not accountable,” said his father. “That
you must excuse. He is a mere boor, a log, a brute with
no address in life. Positively a fly in the jug. The first
I have seen this year."
Edward rose, and paced the room. His imperturbable
parent sipped his tea.
“Father,” said the young man, stopping at length
before him, “we must not trifle in this matter. We
must not deceive each other or ourselves. Let me pur-
sue the manly, open part I wish to take, and do not re-
pel me by this unkind indifference.”
"Whether I am indifferent or no," returned the other,
“I leave you, my dear boy, to judge. A ride of twenty-
five or thirty miles, through miry roads—a Maypole
dinner-a tete-a-tete with Haredale, which, vanity
apart, was quite a Valentine and Orson business--a
Maypole bed—a Maypole landlord, and a Maypole ret-
inue of idiots and centaurs—whether the voluntary
endurance of these things looks like indifference, dear
Ned, or like the excessive anxiety and devotion, and all
that sort of thing, of a parent, you shall determine for
yourself.”
“I wish you to consider, sir,” said Edward, “ in what
a cruel situation I am placed. Loving Miss Haredale
as I do,”
“My dear fellow,” interrupted his father, with a com-
passionate smile, “ you do nothing of the kind. You
don't know anything about it. There's no such thing,
I assure you. Now, do take my word for it. You have
good sense, Ned-great good sense. I wonder you
should be guilty of such amazing absurdities. You
really surprise me.”
“I repeat,” said his son, firmly, “that I love her.
You have interposed to part us, and have, to the extent

I have just now told you of, succeeded. May I induce
you, sir, in time, to think more favourably of our at-
tachment, or is it your intention and your fixed design
to hold us asunder if you can?"
“My dear Ned,” returned his father, taking a pinch
of snuff and pushing his box towards him, “that is my
purpose most undoubtedly.”
"The time that has elapsed,” rejoined his son, “since
I began to know her worth, has flown in such a dream
that until now I have hardly once paused to reflect upon
my true position. What is it? From my childhood I
have been accustomed to luxury and idleness, and have
been bred as though my fortune were large, and my
expectations almost without a limit. The idea of wealth
has been familiarised to me from my cradle. I have
been taught to look upon those means, by which men
raise themselves to riches and distinction, as being be-
yond my heeding, and beneath my care. I have been,
as the phrase is, liberally educated, and am fit for
nothing. I find myself at last wholly dependent upon
you, with no resource but in your favour. In this mo-
mentous question of my life we do not, and it would
seem we never can, agree. I have shrunk instinctively
alike from those to whom you have urged me to pay
court, and from the motives of interest and gain which
have rendered them in your eyes visible objects for my
suit. If there never has been thus much plain-speaking
between us before, sir, the fault has not been mine,
indeed. If I seem to speak too plainly now, it is, believe
me, father, in the hope that there may be a franker
spirit, a worthier reliance, and a kinder confidence be-
tween us in time to come.”
“My good fellow,” said his smiling father, “you quite
affect me. Go on, my dear Edward, I beg. But remem-
ber your promise. There is great earnestness, vast can-
dour, a manifest sincerity in all you say, but I fear I
observe the faintest indications of.a tendency to prose.”
“I am very sorry, sir.”
“I am very sorry too, Ned, but you know that I can-
not fix my mind for any long period upon one subject.
If you'll come to the point at once, I'll imagine all that
ought to go before, and conclude it said. Oblige me
with the milk again. Listening invariably makes me
feverish.”

123
“What I would say, then, tends to this,” said Edward.
“I cannot bear this absolute dependence, sir, even upon
you. Time has been lost and opportunity thrown away,
but I am yet a young man, and may retrieve it. Will
you give me the means of devoting such abilities and
energies as I possess to some worthy pursuit ? Will
you let me try to make for myself an honourable path
in life? For any term you please to name—say for five
years, if you will-I will pledge myself to move no
further in the matter of our difference without your
full concurrence. During that period I will endeavour
earnestly and patiently, if ever man did, to open some
prospect for myself, and free you from the burden you
fear I should become if I married one whose worth and
beauty are her chief endowments. Will you do this,
sir ? At the expiration of the term we agree upon, let
us discuss this subject again. Till then, unless it is re-
vived by you, let it never be renewed between us.”
“My dear Ned," returned his father, laying down his
newspaper, at which he had been glancing carelessly,
and throwing himself back in the window-seat, “I be-
lieve you know how very much I dislike what are called
family affairs, which are only fit for plebian Christmas
days, and have no manner of business with people of
our condition. But as you are proceeding upon a mis-
take, Ned-altogether upon a mistake-I will conquer
my repugnance to entering on such matters, and give
you a perfectly plain and candid answer, if you will do
me the favour, to shut the door.”
Edward having obeyed him, he took an elegant little
knife from his pocket, and paring his nails, continued :
“You have to thank me, Ned, for being of good family;
for your mother, charming person as she was, and almost
broken-hearted, and so forth, as she left me, when she
was prematurely compelled to become immortal-had
nothing to boast of in that respect.”
“Her father was at least an eminent lawyer, sir,” said
Edward.
“Quite right, Ned; perfectly so. He stood high at the
bar, had a great name and great wealth, but having
risen from nothing—I have always closed my eyes to
the circumstance and steadily resisted its contempla-
tion, but I fear his father dealt in pork, and that his
business did once involve cowheel and sausages-he

wished to marry his daughter into a good family. He
had his heart's desire, Ned. I was a younger son's
younger son, and I married her. We each had our
object, and gained it. She stepped at once into the
politest and best circles, and I stepped into a fortune
which I assure you was very necessary to my comfort
quite indispensable. Now, my good fellow, that fortune
is among the things that have been. It is gone, Ned,
and has been gone-how old are you? I always forget.”
“ Seven-and-twenty, sir.”
“Are you, indeed?” cried his father, raising his eye-
lids in a languishing surprise. “So much! Then I should
say, Ned, that as nearly as I remember, its skirts van-
ished from human knowledge about eighteen or nine-
teen years ago. It was about that time when I came to
live in these chambers (once your grandfather's, and
bequeathed by that extremely respectable person to me),
and commenced to live upon an inconsiderable annuity
and my past reputation."
“You are jesting with me, sir,” said Edward.
“Not in the slightest degree, I assure you,” returned
his father, with great composure. “ These family topics
are so extremely dry, that I am sorry to say they don't
admit of any such relief. It is for that reason, and be-
cause they have an appearance of business, that I dis-
like them so very much. Well! You know the rest.
A son, Ned, unless he is old enough to be a companion
that is to say, unless he is some two or three and
twenty-is not the kind of thing to have about one. He
is a restraint upon his father, his father is a restraint
upon him, and they make each other mutually uncom-
fortable. Therefore, until within the last four years or
30-I have a poor memory for dates, and if I mistake,
you will correct me in your own mind—you pursued
your studies at a distance, and picked up a great va-
riety of accomplishments. Occasionally we passed a
week or two together here, and disconcerted each other
as only such near relations can. At last you came.
home. I candidly tell you, my dear boy, that if you
had been awkward and overgrown, I should have ex-
ported you to some distant part of the world!”
“I wish with all my soul you had, sir," said Edward.
“No, you don't, Ned,” rejoined his father, coolly; “you
are mistaken, I assure you. I found you a handsome,

prepossessing, elegant fellow, and I threw you into the
society I can still command. Having done that, my
dear fellow, I consider that I have provided for you in
life, and rely on your doing something to provide for
me in return."
“I do not understand your meaning, sir.”
“My meaning, Ned, is obvious-I observe another fly
in the cream-jug, but have the goodness not to take it
out as you did the first, for their walk, when their legs
are milky, is extremely ungraceful and disagreeable-
my meaning is, that you must do as I did; that you
must marry well and make the most of yourself.”
“A mere fortune-hunter!” cried the son, indignantly.
“What in the devil's name, Ned, would you be?”
returned the father. “ All men are fortune-hunters, are
they not? The law, the church, the court, the camp,
see how they are all crowded with fortune-hunters,
jostling each other in the pursuit. The Stock-exchange,
the pulpit, the counting-house, the royal drawing-
room, the Senate—what but fortune-hunters are they
filled with? A fortune-hunter! Yes. You are one; and
you would be nothing else, my dear Ned, if you were
the greatest courtier, lawyer, legislator, prelate, or
merchant, in existence. If you are squeamish and
moral, Ned, console yourself with the reflection that
at the worst your fortune-hunting can make but one
person miserable or unhappy. How many people do
you suppose these other kinds of huntsmen crush
in following their sport-hundreds at a step? Or
thousands?"
The young man leant his head upon his hand, and made
no answer.
“I am quite charmed," said the father, rising, and
walking slowly to and fro-stopping now and then to
glance at himself in a mirror, or survey a picture
through his glass, with the air of a connoisseur, “that
we have had this conversation, Ned, unpromising as it
was. It establishes a confidence between us which is
quite delightful, and was certainly necessary, though
how you can ever have mistaken our position and
designs, I confess I cannot understand. I conceived,
until I found your fancy for this girl, that all these
points were tacitly agreed upon between us.”
“I knew you were embarrassed, sir,” returned the

son, raising his head for a moment, and then falling
into his former attitude, “but I had no idea we were
the beggared wretches you describe. How could I
suppose it, bred as I have been; witnessing the life you
have always led; and the appearance you have always
made?”
“My dear child," said the father—"for you really
talk so like a child that I must call you one-you were
bred upon a careful principle; the very manner of your
education, I assure you, maintained my credit surpris-
ingly. As to the life I lead, I must lead it, Ned. I must
have these little refinements about me. I have always
been used to them, and I cannot exist without them.
They must surround me, you observe, and therefore
they are here. With regard to our circumstances, Ned,
you may set your mind at rest upon that score. They
are desperate. Your own appearance is by no means
despicable, and our joint pocket-money alone devours
our income. That's the truth.”
" Why have I never known this before? Why have
you encouraged me, sir, to an expenditure and mode of
life to which we have no right or title?”
“My good fellow," returned his father, more compas-
sionately than ever, “if you made no appearance how
could you possibly succeed in the pursuit for which I
destined you? As to our mode of life, every man has a
right to live in the best way he can; and to make him-
self as comfortable as he can, or he is an unnatural
scoundrel. Our debts, I grant, are very greaty and
therefore it the more behooves you, as a young man of
principle and honour, to pay them off as speedily as
possible.”
“ The villain's part," muttered Edward, “ that I have
unconsciously played! Ito win the heart of Emma Hare-
dale! I would, for her sake, I had died first!”
“I am glad you see, Ned,” returned his father, “ how
perfectly self-evident it is, that nothing can be done in
that quarter. But apart from this, and the necessity
of your speedily bestowing yourself in another (as you
know you could to-morrow, if you chose), I wish you'd
look upon it pleasantly. In a religious point of view
alone, how could you ever think of uniting yourself to
a Catholic, unless she was amazingly rich? You who
ought to be so very Protestant, coming of such a Prot-

estant family as you do. Let us be moral, Ned, or we
are nothing. Even if one could set that objection aside,
which is impossible, we come to another which is quite
conclusive. The very idea of marrying a girl whose
father was killed, like meat! Good God, Ned, how dis-
agreeable! Consider the impossibility of having any re-
spect for your father-in-law under such circumstances
-think of his having been 'viewed' by jurors, and 'sat
upon' by coroners, and of his very doubtful position in
the family ever afterwards. It seems to me such an in-
delicate sort of thing that I really think the girl ought
to have been put to death by the state to prevent its hap-
pening. But I tease you, perhaps. You would rather be
alone? My dear Ned, most willingly. God bless you.
I shall be going out presently, but we shall meet to-
night, or if not to-night, certainly to-morrow. Take
care of yourself in the meantime for both our sakes.
You are a person of great consequence to me, Ned--of
vast consequence, indeed. God bless you!”
With these words, the father, who had been arranging
his cravat in the glass, while he uttered them in a dis-
connected, careless manner, withdrew, humming a tune
as he went. The son, who had appeared so lost in
thought as not to hear or understand them, remained
quite still and silent. After the lapse of half an hour or
so, the elder Chester, gaily dressed, went out. The
younger still sat with his head resting on his hands, in
what appeared to be a kind of stupor.

CHAPTER XVI.
A SERIES of pictures representing the streets of London
in the night, even at the comparatively recent date of
this tale, would present to the eye something so very
different in character from the reality which is witnessed
in these times, that it would be difficult for the beholder
to recognise his most familiar walks in the altered as-
pect of little more than half a century ago.
They were, one and all, from the broadest and best to
the narrowest and least frequented, very dark. The oil
and cotton lamp, though regularly trimmed twice or
thrice in the long winter nights, burnt feebly at the
best; and at a late hour, when they were unassisted by
the lamps and candles in the shops, cast but a narrow
track of doubtful light upon the footway, leaving the
projecting doors and house-fronts in the deepest gloom.
Many of the courts and lanes were left in total darkness;
those of the meaner sort, where one glimmering light
twinkled for a score of houses, being favoured in no
slight degree. Even in these places, the inhabitants had
often good reason for extinguishing their lamp as soon
as it was lighted; and, the watch being utterly inefficient
and powerless to prevent them, they did so at their
pleasure. Thus, in the lightest thoroughfares, there was
at every turn some obscure and dangerous spot whither
a thief might fiy for shelter, and few would care to fol-
low; and the city being belted round by fields, green
lanes, waste grounds and lonely roads, dividing it at that
time from the suburbs that have joined it since, escape,
even where the pursuit was hot, was rendered easy.
It is no wonder that with these favouring circumstances
in full and constant operation, street robberies, often
accompanied by cruel wounds, and not unfrequently by
loss of life, should have been of nightly occurrence in
the very heart of London, or that quiet folks should have
had great dread of traversing its streets after the shops
were closed. It was not unusual for those who wended
home alone at midnight to keep the middle of the road,
the better to guard against surprise from lurking foot-
pads; few would venture to repair at a late hour to

Kentish Town or Hampstead, or even to Kensington or
Chelsea, unarmed and unattended; while he who had
been loudest and most valiant at the supper-table or the
tavern, and had but a mile or so to go, was glad to fee a
link-boy to escort him home.
There were many other characteristics—not quite so
disagreeable—about the thoroughfares of London then,
with which they had been long familiar. Some of
the shops, especially those to the eastward of Temple
Bar, still adhered to the old practice of hanging out a
sign; and the creaking and swinging of these boards in
their iron frames on windy nights formed a strange and
mournful concert for the ears of those who lay awake
in bed or hurried through the streets. Long stands of
hackney-chairs and groups of chairmen, compared with
whom the coachmen of our day are gentle and polite,
obstructed the way and filled the air with clamour;
night-cellars, indicated by a little stream of light cross-
ing the pavement, and stretching out half-way into the
road, and by the stifled roar of voices from below,
yawned for the reception and entertainment of the most
abandoned of both sexes; under every shed and bulk
small groups of link-boys gamed away the earnings of
the day; or one more weary than the rest, gave way to
sleep, and let the fragment of his torch fall hissing on
the puddled ground.
Then there was the watch with staff and lantern cry-
ing the hour, and the kind of weather; and those who
woke up at his voice and turned them round in bed,
were glad to hear it rained, or snowed, or blew, or froze,
for very comfort's sake. The solitary passenger was
startled by the chairmen's cry of “By your leave there!"
as two came trotting past him with their empty vehicle
-carried backwards to show its being disengaged-and
hurried to the nearest stand. Many a private chair too,
inclosing some fine lady, monstrously hooped and fur-
belowed, and preceded by running-footmen bearing
flambeaux-for which extinguishers are yet suspended
before the doors of a few houses of the better sort--
made the way gay and light as it danced along, and
darker and more dismal when it had passed. It was
not unusual for these running gentry, who carried it
with a very high hand, to quarrel in the servants' hall
while waiting for their masters and mistresses; and, fall-

are tales among us that you have sold yourself to the
devil, and I know not what."
"We all have, have we not?” returned the stranger,
looking up. “If we were fewer in number, perhaps he
would give better wages."
"It goes rather. hard with you, indeed," said the fel-
low, as the stranger disclosed his haggard, unwashed
face, and torn clothes. “What of that? Be merry,
master. A stave of a roaring song now —”.
“Sing you, if you desire to hear one,” replied the other,
shaking him roughly off; "and don't touch me if you're
a prudent man; I carry arms which go off easily—they
have done so, before now—and make it dangerous for
strangers, who don't know the trick of them, to lay
hands upon me.”
“Do you threaten?" said the fellow.
“Yes," returned the other, rising and turning upon
him, and looking fiercely round as if in apprehension of
a general attack.
His voice, and look, and bearing—all expressive of the
wildest recklessness and desperation-daunted while
they repelled the bystanders. Although in a very differ-
ent sphere of action now, they were not without much
of the effect they had wrought at the Maypole Inn.
“I am what you all are, and live as you all do,” said
the man, sternly, after a short silence. “I am in hiding
here like the rest, and if we were surprised, would per-
haps do my part with the best of ye. If it's my humour
to be left to myself, let me have it. Otherwise”-and
here he swore a tremendous oath—“there'll be mischief
done in this place, though there are odds of a score
against me.”
A low murmur, having its origin perhaps in a dread
of the man and the mystery that surrounded him, or per-
haps in a sincere opinion on the part of some of those
present, that it would be an inconvenient precedent to
meddle too curiously with a gentleman's private affairs
if he saw reason to conceal them, warned the fellow
who had occasioned this discussion that he had best
pursue it no further. After a short time the strange
man lay down upon a bench to sleep, and when they
thought of him again, they found that he was gone.
Next night, as soon as it was dark, he was abroad
again and traversing the streets. he was before the lock-

smith's house more than once, but the family were out,
and it was close shut. This night he crossed London
Bridge and passed into Southwark. As he glided down
a bye-street, a woman with a little basket on her arm,
turned into it at the other end. Directly he observed
her, he sought the shelter of an archway, and stood
aside until she had passed. Then he emerged cautiously
from his hiding place, and followed..
She went into different shops to purchase various
kinds of household necessaries, and round every place at
which she stopped he hovered like her evil spirit; fol-
lowing her when she reappeared. It was nigh eleven
o'clock, and the passengers in the streets were thinning
fast, when she turned, doubtless to go home. The
phantom still followed her.
She turned into the same bye-street in which he had
seen her first, which, being free from shops, and narrow,
was extremely dark. She quickened her pace here, as
though distrustful of being stopped, and robbed of such
trifling property she carried with her. She crept along
on the other side of the road. Had she been gifted with
the speed of wind, it seemed as if the terrible shadow
would have tracked her down.
At length the widow-for she it was reached her own
door, and panting for breath, paused to take the key
from her basket. In a flush and glow, with the haste
she had made, and the pleasure of being safe at home,
she stooped to draw it out, when, raising her head, she
saw him standing silently beside her; the apparition of
a dream.
His hand was on her mouth, but that was needless,
for her tongue clove to its roof, and her power of utter-
ance was gone. “I have been looking for you many
nights. Is the house empty? Answer me. Is any one
inside ?”
She could only answer by a rattle in her throat.
“Make me a sign."
She seemed to indicate that there was no one there.
He took the key, unlocked the door, carried her in, and
secured it carefully behind them,

CHAPTER XVII.
It was a chilly night, and the fire in the widow's par-
lour had burnt low. Her strange companion placed her
in a chair, and stooping down before the half-extin-
guished ashes, raked them together and fanned them
with his hat. From time to time he glanced at her over
his shoulder, as though to assure himself of her remain-
ing quiet and making no effort to depart; and that done,
busied himself about the fire again.
It was not without reason that he took these pains, for
his dress was dank and drenched with wet, his jaws
rattled with cold, and he shivered from head to foot. It
had rained hard during the previous night and for some
hours in the morning; but since noon it had been fine.
Wheresoever he had passed the hours of darkness, his
condition sufficiently betokened that many of them had
been spent beneath the open sky. Besmeared with mire;
his saturated clothes clinging with a damp embrace
about his limbs; his beard unshaven, his face unwashed,
his meagre cheeks worn into deep hollows-a more mis-
erable wretch could hardly be, than this man who now
cowered down upon the widow's hearth, and watched
the struggling flame with bloodshot eyes.
She had covered her face with her hands, fearing, as
it seemed, to look towards him. So they remained for
some short time in silence. Glancing round again, he
asked at length:
“Is this your house?”
“It is. Why, in the name of Heaven, do you darken
it?”
“Give me meat and drink,” he answered, sullenly, “or
I dare do more than that. The very marrow in my bones
is cold with wet and hunger. I must have warmth and
food, and I will have them here."
“You were the robber on the Chigwell road.”
“I was.”
“And nearly a murderer then.”
“ The will was not wanting. There was one came

upon me and raised the hue-and-cry, that it would have
gone hard with, but for his nimbleness. I made a thrust
at him.”
“You thrust your sword at him!” cried the widow,
looking upwards. “You hear this man ! you hear and
saw !"
He looked at her, as, with her head thrown back, and
her hands tight clenched together, she uttered these
words in agony of appeal. Then starting to his feet as
she had done, he advanced towards her.
“Beware!" she cried in a suppressed voice, whose
firmness stopped him midway. "Do not so much as
touch me with a finger, or you are lost; body and soul,
you are lost.” .
“Hear me,” he replied, menacing her with his hand.
“I, that in a form of a man live the life of a hunted
beast ! that in the body am a spirit, a ghost upon the
earth, a thing from which all creatures shrink, save
those cursed beings of another world, who will not leave
me-I am, in my desperation of this night, past all fear
but that of the hell in which I exist from day to day.
Give the alarm, cry out, refuse to sħelter me. I will not
hurt you. But I will not be taken alive; and so surely as
you threaten me above your breath, I fall a dead man
on this floor. The blood with which I sprinkle it, be on
you and yours, in the name of the Evil Spirit that tempts
men to their ruin !”.
As he spoke, he took a pistol from his breast, and
firmly clutched it in his hand..
“Remove this man from me, good Heaven !” cried
the widow. “In thy grace and mercy, give him one
minute's penitence, and strike him dead!"
“It has no such purpose,” he said, confronting her.
“It is deaf. Give me to eat and drink, lest I do that it
cannot help my doing, and will not do for you.”
“ Will you leave me, if I do thus much ? Will you
leave and return no more ?”.
“ I will promise nothing,” he rejoined, seating himself
at the table, “nothing but this I will execute my threat
if you betray me.”
She rose at length, and going to a closet or pantry in
the room, brought out some fragments of cold meat and
bread and put them on the table. He asked for brandy,
and for water. These she produced likewise; and he

ate and drank with the voracity of a famished hound. All
the time he was so engaged, she kept at the uttermost
distance of the chamber, and sat there shuddering, but
with her face towards him. She never turned her back
upon him once, and although when she passed him (as
she was obliged to do in going to and from the cupboard)
she gathered the skirts of her garment about her, as
if even its touching his by chance were horrible to
think of, still, in the midst of all this dread and terror,
she kept her face directed to his own, and watched his
every movement.
His repast ended-if that can be called one, which
was a mere ravenous satisfying of the calls of hunger
- he moved his chair towards the fire again, and warm-
ing himself before the blaze which had now sprung
brightly up, accosted her once more.
“I am an outcast, to whom a roof above his head is
often an uncommon luxury, and the food a beggar
would reject is delicate fare. You live here at your ease.
Do you live alone?”
“I do not,” she made answer, with an effort.
“ Who dwells here besides?”
“ One--it is no matter who. You had best begone, or
he may find you here. Why do you linger?”
“For warmth,” he replied, spreading out his hands
before the fire. “For warmth. You are rich, perhaps?”
“ Very,” she said, faintly. “Very rich. No doubt I.
am very rich.”
" At least you are not penniless. You have some
money. You were making purchases to-night."
“I have a little left. It is but a few shillings.”
os Give me your purse. You had it in your hand at
the door. Give it to me.”
She stepped to the table and laid it down. He reached
across, took it up, and told the contents into his hand.
As he was counting them, she listened for a moment, and
sprung towards him.
- Take what there is, take all, take more if more were
there, but go before it is too late. I have heard a way-
ward step without, I know full well. It will return
directly. Begone.”
“What do you mean?”.
“Do not stop to ask. I will not answer. Much as I
dread to touch you, I would drag you to the door if I

possessed the strength, rather than you should lose an
instant. Miserable wretch! fly from this place.”
“If there are spies without, I am safer here,” replied
the man, standing aghast. “I will remain here, and
will not fly till the danger is past.”
“It is too late!” cried the widow, who had listened for
the step, and not to him. “Hark to that foot upon the
ground. Do you tremble to hear it! It is my son, my
idiot son!”
As she said this wildly, there came a heavy knocking
at the door. He looked at her, and she at him.
“Let him come in,” said the man, hoarsely. “I fear
him less than the dark, houseless night. He knocks
again. Let him come in!”
" The dread of this hour,” returned the widow, “has
been upon me all my life, and I will not. Evil will fall
upon him, if you stand eye to eye. My blighted boy!
Oh! all good angels who know the truth-hear a poor
mother's prayer, and spare my boy from knowledge of
this man!
“He rattles at the shutters !” cried the man. “He
calls you. That voice and cry! It was he who grappled
with me in the road. Was it he?"
She had sunk upon her knees, and so knelt down,
moving her lips, but uttering no sound. As he gazed
upon her, uncertain what to do or where to turn, the
shutters flew open. He had barely time to catch a knife
from the table, sheathe it in the loose sleeve of his coat,
hide in the closet, and do all with the lightning's speed,
when Barnaby tapped at the bare glass, and raised the
sash exultingly.
“Why, who can keep out Grip and me!” he cried,
thrusting in his head, and staring round the room.
“ Are you there, mother? How long you keep us from
the fire and light.”
She stammered some excuse and tendered him her
hand. But Barnaby sprung lightly in without assistance,
and putting his arms about her neck, kissed her a hun-
dred times.
“We have been afield, mother-leaping ditches,
scrambling through hedges, running down steep banks,
up and away, and hurrying on. The wind has been
blowing, and the rushes and young plants bowing and
bending to it, lest it should do them harm, the cowards

-and Grip—ha, ha, ha!-brave Grip, who cares for
nothing, and when the wind rolls him over in the dust,
turns manfully to bite it-Grip, bold Grip, has quarrelled
with every little bowing twig--thinking, he told me,
that it mocked him—and has worried it like a bull-dog.
Ha, ha, ha!”
The raven, in his little basket at his master's back,
hearing this frequent mention of his name in a tone
of exultation, expressed his sympathy by crowing like
a cock, and afterwards running over his various phrases
of speech with such rapidity, and in so many varieties
of hoarseness, that they sounded like the murmurs of a
crowd of people.
“He takes such care of me besides!” said Barnaby.
“ Such care, mother! He watches all the time I sleep,
and when I shut my eyes and make-believe to slumber,
he practises new learning softly; but he keeps his eye
on me the while, and if he sees me laugh, though never
so little, stops directly. He won't surprise me till he's
perfect.”
The raven crowed again in a rapturous manner which
plainly said, “Those are certainly some of my char-
acteristics, and I glory in them.” In the meantime,
Barnaby closed the window and secured it, and coming
to the fire-place, prepared to sit down with his face to
the closet. But his mother prevented this, by hastily
taking that side herself, and motioning him towards the
other.
“How pale you are to-night!” said Barnaby, leaning
on his stick. “We have been cruel, Grip, and made
her anxious!”
Anxious in good truth, and sick at heart! The listener
held the door of his hiding-place open with his hand,
and closely watched her son. Grip-alive to everything
his master was unconscious of–had his head out of the
basket, and in return was watching him intently with
his glistening eye.
“ He flaps his wings,” said Barnaby, turning almost
quickly enough to catch the retreating form and clos-
ing door, “as if there were strangers here; but Grip
is wiser than to fancy that. Jump, then!”
Accepting this invitation with a dignity peculiar to
himself, the bird hopped up on his master's shoulder,
from that to his extended hand, and so to the ground.

Barnaby unstrapping the basket and putting it down in
a corner with the lid open, Grip's first care was to shut
it down with all possible despatch, and then to stand
upon it. Believing, no doubt, that he had now rendered
it utterly impossible, and beyond the power of mortal
man, to shut him up in it any more, he drew a great
many corks in triumph, and uttered a corresponding
number of hurrahs.
“Mother!” said Barnaby, laying aside his hat and stick,
and returning to the chair from which he had risen, “I'll
tell you where we have been to-day and what we have
been doing—shall I?”
She took his hand in hers, and holding it, nodded the
word she could not speak.
“You mustn't telì,” said Barnaby, holding up his
finger, “for it's a secret, mind, and only known to me
and Grip, and Hugh. We had the dog with us, but he's
not like Grip, clever as he is, and doesn't guess it yet,
I'll wager. Why do you look behind me so ?”
“Did I?" she answered, faintly. “I didn't know I did.
Come nearer me.”
“You are frightened!” said Barnaby, changing colour.
“Mother-you don't see—”.
“See what?”
“There's—there's none of this about, is there?” he an-
swered in a whisper, drawing closer to her and clasping
the mark upon his wrist. "I am afraid there is, some-
where. You make my hair stand on end and my flesh.
creep. Why do you look like that? Is it in the room as
I have seen it in my dreams, dashing the ceiling and the
walls with red? Tell me. Is it?"
He fell into a shivering fit as he put the question, and
shutting out the light with his hands, sat shaking in
every limb until it had passed away. After a time he
raised his head and looked about him.
“Is it gone?”
“There has been nothing here,” rejoined his mother,
soothing him. “Nothing indeed, dear Barnaby. Look!
You see there are but you and me.”
He gazed at her vacantly, and, becoming reassured by
degrees, burst into a wild laugh.
But let us see,” he said, thoughtfully. “Were we
talking? Was it you and me? Where have we been?”
“Nowhere but here.”

“Aye, but Hugh and I,” said Barnaby, “that's it.
Maypole Hugh and I, you know, and Grip—we have
been lying in the forest, and among the trees by the road-
side, with a dark-lantern after night came on, and the
dog in a noose ready to slip him when the man came by.”
What man?"
“The robber; him that the stars winked at, We have
waited for him after dark these many nights, and we
shall have him. I'd know him in a thousand. Mother,
see here! This is the man. Look!"
He twisted his handkerchief round his head, pulled
his hat upon his brow, wrapped his coat about him, and
stood up before her: so like the original he counterfeited,
that the dark figure peering out behind him might have
passed for his own shadow.
“Ha, ha, ha! We shall have him,” he cried, ridding
himself of the semblance as hastily as he had assumed it.
“ You shall see him, mother, bound hand and foot, and
brought to London at a saddle-girth; and you shall hear
of him at Tyburn Tree if we have luck. Šo Hugh says.
You're pale again, and trembling. And why do you .
look behind me so?”
“It is nothing,” she answered. “I am not quite well.
Go you to bed, dear, and leave me here.”
"To bed!” he answered. “I don't like bed. I like to
lie before the fire, watching the prospects in the burn-
ing coals—the rivers, hills, and dells, in the deep, red
sunset, and the wild faces. I am hungry, too, and Grip
· has eaten nothing since broad noon. Let us to supper.
Grip! to supper, lad!”
The raven flapped his wings, and, croaking his satis-
faction, hopped to the feet of his master, and there held
his bill open, ready for snapping up such lumps of meat
as he should throw him. Of these he received about a
score in rapid succession, without the smallest .discom-
posure.
«« That's all,” said Barnaby.
“More!” cried Grip. “More!”
But it appearing for a certainty that no more was to
be had, he retreated with his store; and disgorging the
morsels one by one from his pouch, hid them in various
corners--taking particular care, however, to avoid the
closet, as being doubtful of the hidden man's propen-
sities and power of resisting temptation. When he had

concluded these arrangements he took a turn or two
across the room, with an elaborate assumption of having
nothing on his mind (but with one eye hard upon his
treasure all the time), and then, and not till then, began
to drag it out, piece by piece, and eat it with the utmost
relish.
Barnaby, for his part, having pressed his mother to
eat, in vain, made a hearty supper too. Once, during
the progress of his meal, he wanted more bread from the
closet and rose to get it. She hurriedly interposed to
prevent him, and summoning her utmost fortitude,
passed into the recess, and brought it out herself.
“Mother,” said Barnaby, looking at her steadfastly as
she sat down beside him, after doing so; “is to-day my
birthday?"
“To-day!" she answered. “Don't you recollect it was
but a week or so ago, and that summer, autumn, and
winter have to pass before it comes again?”
“I remember that it has been so till now," said Barnaby.
“But I think to-day must be my birthday too, for all that.”
· She asked him why? “I'll tell you why," he said. “I
have always seen you-I didn't let you know it, but I
have-on the evening of that day grow very sad. I have
seen you cry when Grip and I were most glad; and look
frightened with no reason; and I have touched your
hand, and felt that it was cold-as it is now. Once,
mother (on a birthday that was, also) Grip and I thought
of this after we went up stairs to bed, and when it was
midnight, striking one o'clock, we came down to your
door to see if you were well. You were on your knees.
I forget what it was you said. Grip, what was it we
heard her say that night?”
“ I'm a devil!” rejoined the raven, promptly.
“No, no,” said Barnaby. “But you said something in a
prayer; and when you rose and walked about, you looked
(as you have done ever since, mother, towards night on
my birthday) just as you do now. I have found that
out, you see, though I am silly. So I say you're wrong;
and this must be my birthday-my birthday, Grip!"
The bird received this information with a crow of such
duration, as a cock, gifted with intelligence beyond all
others of his kind, might usher in the longest day with.
Then, as if he had well considered the sentiment, and
regarded it as apposite to birthdays, he cried, “Never

say die!" a great many times, and flapped his wings for
emphasis.
The widow tried to make light of Barnaby's remark,
and endeavoured to divert his attention to some new sub-
ject; too easy a task at all times, as she knew. His sup-
per done, Barnaby, regardless of her entreaties, stretched
himself on the mat before the fire; Grip perched upon
his leg, and divided his time between dozing in the grate-
ful warmth, and endeavouring (as it presently appeared)
to recall a new accomplisment he had been studying all
day.
X long and profound silence ensued, broken only by
some change of position on the part of Barnaby, whose
eyes were still wide open and intently fixed upon the
fire; or by an effort of recollection on the part of Grip,
who would cry in a low voice from time to time, “Polly
put the ket” and there stop short, forgetting the re-
mainder, and go off in a doze again.
After a long interval Barnaby's breathing grew more
deep and regular, and his eyes were closed. But even
then the unquiet spirit of the raven interposed. “Polly
put the ket-” cried Grip, and his master was broad
awake again.
At length Barnaby slept soundly; and the bird with
his bill sunk upon his breast, his breast itself puffed out
into a comfortable, alderman-like form, and his bright
eye growing smaller and smaller, really seemed to be
subsiding into a state of repose. Now and then he mut-
tered in a sepulchral voice, “Polly put the ket-” but
very drowsily, and more like a drunken man than a re-
flecting raven.
The widow, scarcely venturing to breathe, rose from
her seat. The man glided from the closet, and extin-
guished the candle.
"—tle on," cried Grip, suddenly struck with an idea
and very much excited."—tle on. Hurrah! Polly put
the ket-tle on, we'll all have tea; Polly put the ket-tle
on, we'll all have tea. Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! I'm a
devil, I'm a devil, I'm a ket-tle on, keep up your spirits,
never say die, bow, wow, wow, I'm a devil, I'm a ket-tle,
I'm a-Polly put the ket-tle on, we'll all have tea.”
They stood rooted to the ground, as though it had been
a voice from the grave.
But even this failed to awaken the sleeper. He turned

over towards the fire, his arm fell to the ground, and his
head dropped heavily upon it. The widow and her un-
welcome visitor gazed at him and at each other for a
moment, and then she motioned him towards the door."
“Stay,” he whispered. “You teach your son well.”
“I have taught him nothing that you heard to-night.
Depart instantly or I will rouse him.”
"You are free to do so. Shall I rouse him ?"
“You dare not do that.”
“ I dare do anything, I have told you. He knows me
well, it seems. At least I will know him.”
“Would you kill him in his sleep?” cried the widow,
throwing herself between them.
“Woman,” he returned, between his teeth, as he mo-
tioned her aside, “I would see him nearer, and I will.
If you want one of us to kill the other, wake him.”
With that he advanced, and bending down over the
prostrate form, softly turned back the head and looked
into the face. The light of the fire was upon it, and its
every lineament was revealed distinctly. He contem-
plated it for a brief space, and hastily uprose.
“Observe,” he whispered in the widow's ear; “in him,
of whose existence I was ignorant until to-night, I have
you in my power. Be careful how you use me. Be
careful how you use me. I am destitute and starving
and a wanderer upon the earth. I may take a sure and
slow revenge.”
“ There is some dreadful meaning in your words. I
do not fathom it."
“There is a meaning in them, and I see you fathom
it to its very depth. You have anticipated it for years;
you have told me as much. I leave you to digest it.
Do not forget my warning.”
He pointed, as he left her, to the slumbering form,
and stealthily withdrawing, made his way into the street.
She fell on her knees beside the sleeper, and remained
like one stricken into stone, until the tears which fear
had frozen so long came tenderly to her relief.
" Oh, Thou,” she cried, “who hast taught me such
deep love for this one remnant of the promise of a
happy life, out of whose affliction, even, perhaps the
comfort springs that he is ever a relying, loving child
to me-never growing old or cold at heart, but needing
my care and duty in his manly strength as in his cradle

time-help him in his darkened walk through this sad
world, or he is doomed, and my poor heart is broken !"
CHAPTER XVIII.
GLIDING along the silent streets, and holding his
course where they were darkest and most gloomy, the
man who had left the widow's house crossed London
Bridge, and arriving in the City, plunged into the back
ways, lanes, and courts, between Cornhill and Smith-
field; with no more fixedness of purpose than to lose
himself among their windings, and baffle pursuit, if any
one were dogging his steps.
It was the dead time of the night, and all was quiet.
Now and then a drowsy watchman's footsteps sounded
on the pavement, or the lamplighter on his rounds went
flashing past, leaving behind a little track of smoke
mingled with glowing morsels of his hot red link. He
hid himself even from these partakers of his lonely
walk, and, shrinking in some arch or doorway when
they passed, issued forth again when they were gone
and so pursued his solitary way.
To be quarterless and alone in the open country, hear-
ing the wind moan and watching for day through the
whole long, weary night; to listen to the falling rain,
and crouch for warmth beneath the lee of some old barn
or rick, or in the hollow of a tree; are dismal things-
but not so dismal as the wandering up and down where
shelter is, and beds and sleepers are by thousands; a
houseless, rejected creature. To pace the echoing stones
from hour to hour, counting the dull chimes of the clocks;
to watch the lights twinkling in chamber windows, to
think what happy forgetfulness each house shuts in;
that here are children coiled together in their beds, here
youth, here age, here poverty, here wealth, all equal in
their sleep, and all at rest; to have nothing in common
with the slumbering world around, not even sleep,
Heaven's gift to all its creatures, and be akin to nothing
but despair; to feel, by the wretched contrast with every-
thing on every hand, more utterly alone and cast away
than in a trackless desert; this is a kind of suffering
on which the rivers of great cities close full many a

segnt streark towne, solice
time, and which the solitude in crowds alone awakens.
The miserable man paced up and down the streets—so
long, so wearisome, so like each other-and often cast a
wistful look towards the east, hoping to see the first
faint streaks of day. But obdurate night had yet pos-
session of the sky, and his disturbed and restless walk
found no relief.
One house in a back street was bright with the cheer-
ful glare of lights; there was the sound of music in it,
too, and the tread of dancers, and there were cheerful
voices, and many a burst of laughter. To this place-to
be near something that was awake and glad—he returned
again and again; and more than one of those who left
it when the merriment was at its height, felt it a check
upon their mirthful mood to see him fitting to and fro
like an uneasy ghost. At last the guests departed, one
and all; and then the house was close shut up, and be-
came as dull and silent as the rest.
His wanderings brought him at one time to the city
jail. Instead of hastening from it as a place of ill omen,
and one he had cause to shun, he sat down on some
steps hard by, and, resting his chin upon his hand, gazed
upon its rough and frowning walls as though even they
became a refuge in his jaded eyes. He paced it round
and round, came back to the same spot, and sat down
again. He did this often, and once, with a hasty move-
ment, crossed to where some men were watching in the
prison lodge, and had his foot upon the steps as though
determined to accost them. But looking round, he saw
that the day began to break, and failing in his purpose,
turned and fled.
He was soon in the quarter he had lately traversed,
and pacing to and fro again as he had done before. He
was passing down a mean street, when from an alley
close at hand some shouts of revelry arose, and there
came straggling forth a dozen madcaps, whooping and
calling to each other, who, parting noisily, took different
ways and dispersed in smaller groups.
Hoping that some low place of entertainment which
would afford him a safe refuge might be near at hand,
he turned into this court when they were all gone, and
looked about for a half-opened door, or lighted window,
or other indication of the place whence they had come.
It was so profoundly dark, however, and so ill-favoured,
Hopingford him a court whed door, ore they haavoured,

that he concluded they had but turned up there, missing
their way, and were pouring out again when he observed
them. With this impression, and finding there was no
outlet but that by which he had entered, he was about
to turn, when from a grating near his feet a sudden
stream of light appeared, and the sound of talking came.
He retreated into a doorway to see who these talkers
were, and to listen to them.
The light came to the level of the pavement as he did
this, and a man ascended bearing in his hand a torch.
This figure unlocked and held open the grating as for
the passage of another, who presently appeared, in the
form of a young man of small stature and uncommon
self-importance, dressed in an obsolete and very gaudy
fashion.
“Good-night, noble captain,” said he with the
torch. “Farewell, commander. Good luck, illustrious
general!"
In return to these compliments the other bade him hold
his tongue, and keep his noise to himself; and laid upon
him many similar injunctions, with great fluency of
speech and sternness of manner.
“Commend me, captain, to the stricken Miggs,” re-
turned the torch-bearer, in a lower voice. “My captain
flies at higher game than Miggses. Ha, ha, ha! My
captain is an eagle, both as respects his eye and soar-
ing wings. My captain breaketh hearts as other bache-
lors break eggs at breakfast.”
“What a fool you are, Stagg!" said Mr. Tappertit,
stepping on the pavement of the court, and brushing
from his legs the dust he had contracted in his passage
upward.
“His precious limbs!” cried Stagg, clasping one of
his ankles. “Shall a Miggs aspire to these proportions!
No, no, my captain. We will inveigle ladies fair, and
wed them in our secret cavern. We will unite ourselves
with blooming beauties, captain.”
“I'll tell you what, my buck,” said Mr. Tappertit, re-
leasing bis leg; “I'll trouble you not to take liberties,
and not to broach certain questions unless certain ques-
tions are broached to you. Speak when you're spoke to
on particular subjects, and not otherwise. Hold the
torch up till I've got to the end of the court, and then
kennel yourself, do you hear?”

“I hear you, noble captain."
“Obey then,” said Mr. Tappertit, haughtily. “Gentle-
men, lead on?” With which word of command (ad-
dressed to an imaginary staff or retinue) he folded his
arms, and walked with surpassing dignity down the
court.
His obsequious follower stood holding the torch above
his head, and then the observer saw for the first time,
from his place of concealment, that he was blind. Some
involuntary motion on his part caught the quick ear of
the blind man, before he was conscious of having moved
an inch towards him, for he turned suddenly and cried,
“Who's there?”
“A man,” said the other, advancing. “A friend!”
“A stranger!" rejoined the blind man. “Strangers
are not my friends. What do you do there?”
“I saw your company come out, and waited here till
they were gone. I want a lodging.”
“A lodging at this time!” returned Stagg, pointing
towards the dawn as though he saw it. “Do you know
the day is breaking ?”
“I know it,” rejoined the other, “to my cost. I have
been traversing this iron-heated town all night.”
“You had better traverse it again," said the blind
man, preparing to descend, “till you find some lodgings
suitable to your taste. I don't let any."
“Stay!” čried the other, holding him.by the arm.
“I'll beat this light about that hangdog face of yours
(for hangdog it is, if it answers to your voice), and rouse
the neighbourhood besides, if you detain me,” said the
blind man. “Let me go. Do you hear?”
“Do you hear!" returned the other, chinking a few
shillings together, and hurriedly pressing them into his
hand. “I beg nothing of you. I will pay you for the
shelter you give me. Death! Is it much to ask of such
as you! I have come from the country and desire to
rest where there are none to question me. I am faint,
exhausted, worn out, almost dead. Let me lie down,
like a dog, before your fire. I ask no more than that.
If you would be rid of me, I will depart to-morrow.”
“If a gentleman has been unfortunate on the road,"
muttered Stagg, yielding to the other, who, pressing on
him, had already gained a footing on the steps—" and
can pay for his accommodation"

“I will pay you with all I have. I am just now past
the want of food, God knows, and wish but to purchase
shelter. What companion have you below ?”
“None.”
“Then fasten your grate there, and show me the way.
Quick.”
The blind man complied after a moment's hesitation,
and they descended together. The dialogue had passed
as hurriedly as the words could be spoken, and they
stood in his wretched room before he had had time to
recover from his first surprise.
“May I see where that door leads to, and what is be-
yond?" said the man, glancing keenly round. “You
will not mind that?"
“I will show you myself. Follow me, or go before.
Take your choice.”
He bade him lead the way, and, by the light of the
torch which his conductor held up for the purpose, in-
spected all three cellars narrowly. Assured that the
blind man had spoken truth, and that he lived there
alone, the visitor returned with him to the first, in which
a fire was burning, and flung himself with a deep groan
upon the ground before it.
His host pursued his usual occupation without seem-
ing to heed him any further. But directly he fell asleep
-and he noted his falling into a slumber, as readily as
the keenest-sighted man could have done—he knelt
down beside him, and passed his hand lightly but care-
fully over his face and person.
His sleep was checkered with starts and moans, and
sometimes with a muttered word or two. His hands
were clenched, his brow bent, and his mouth firmly set.
All this, the blind man accurately marked; and as if his
curiosity were strongly awakened, and he had already
some inkling of his mystery, he sat watching him, if the
expression may be used, and listening, until it was broad
day.

CHAPTER XIX.
DOLLY VARDEN's pretty little head was yet bewildered
by various recollections of the party, and her bright
eyes were yet dazzled by a crowd of images dancing
before them like motes in the sunbeams, among which
the effigy of one partner in particular did especially
figure, the same being a young coachmaker (a master
in his own right), who had given her to understand,
when he handed her into the chair at parting, that it was
his fixed resolve to neglect his business from that time
and die slowly for the love of her-Dolly's head, and
eyes, and thoughts, and seven senses were all in a state
of flutter and confusion for which the party was ac-
countable, although it was now three days old, when,
as she was sitting listlessly at breakfast, reading all
manner of fortunes (that is to say, of married and flour-
ishing fortunes) in the grounds of her teacup, a step was
heard in the workshop, and Mr. Edward Chester was
descried through the glass door, standing among the
rusty locks and keys, like love among the roses-for
which apt comparison the historian may by no means
take any credit to himself, the same being the invention
in a sentimental mood of the chaste and modest Miggs,
who, beholding him from the doorsteps she was then
cleaning, did, in her maiden meditation, give utterance
to the simile.
The locksmith, who happened at the moment to have
his eyes thrown upward and his head backward, in an
intense communing with Toby, did not see his visitor,
until Mrs. Varden, more watchful than the rest, had de-
sired Sim Tappertit to open the glass door and give him
admission–from which untoward circumstance the good
lady argued (for she could deduce a precious moral from
the most trifling event) that to take a draught of small
ale in the morning was to observe a pernicious, irre-
ligious, and Pagan custom, the relish whereof should
be left to swine and Satan, or at least to Popish persons,
and should be shunned by the righteous as a work of sin
and evil. She would, no doubt, have pursued her admo-
nition much further, and would have founded on it a

long list of precious precepts of inestimable value, but
that the young gentleman standing by in a somewhat
uncomfortable and discomfited manner while she read
her spouse this lecture, occasioned her to bring it to a
premature conclusion.
“I'm sure you'll excuse me, sir,” said Mrs. Varden,
rising and curtseying. " Varden is so very thought-
less, and needs so much reminding-Sim, bring a chair
here.”
Mr. Tappertit obeyed, with a flourish implying that he
did so under protest.
“And you can go, Sim,” said the locksmith.
Mr. Tappertit obeyed again, still under protest; and
betaking himself to the workshop, began seriously to
fear that he might find it necessary to poison his master,
before his time was out.
In the meantime, Edward returned suitable replies to
Mrs. Varden's courtesies, and that lady brightened up
very much; so that when he accepted a dish of tea from
the fair hands of Dolly, she was perfectly agreeable.
“I'm sure if there's anything we can do—Varden or
I, or Dolly either—to serve you, sir, at any time, you
have only to say it, and it shall be done,” said Mrs. V.
“I am much obliged to you, I am sure,” returned Ed-
ward. “You encourage me to say that I have come
here now, to beg your good offices.”
Mrs. Varden was delighted beyond measure.
“It occurred to me that probably your fair daughter
might be going to the Warren, either to-day or to-mor-
row,” said Edward, glancing at Dolly; “and if so, and you
will allow her to take charge of this letter, ma'am, you
will oblige me more than I can tell you. The truth is,
that while I am very anxious it should reach its destina-
tion, I have particular reasons for not trusting it to any
other conveyance; so that without your help, I am
wholly at a loss,”
“ She was not going that way, sir, either to-day, or
to-morrow, nor, indeed, all next week,” the lady
graciously returned, “but we shall be very glad to put
ourselves out of the way on your account, and if you
wish it, you may depend upon its going to-day. You
might suppose,” said Mrs Varden, frowning at her hus-
band, “from Varden's sitting there so glum and silent,
that he objected to this arrangement; but you must not

mind that, sir, if you please. It's his way at home.
Out of doors, he can be cheerful and talkative enough.”
Now, the fact was, that the unfortunate locksmith,
blessing his stars to find his helpmate in such good
humour, had been sitting with a beaming face, hearing
this discourse with a joy past all expression. Wherefore
this sudden attack quite took him by surprise.
“My dear Martha,” he said.
“Oh, yes, I dare say,” interrupted Mrs. Varden, with
a smile of mingled scorn and pleasantry. “Very dear!
We all know that.”
“No, but, my good soul,” said Gabriel, “ you are quite
mistaken. You are indeed. I was delighted to find you
so kind and ready. I waited, my dear, anxiously, I as-
sure you, to hear what you would say.”
“You waited anxiously,” repeated Mrs. V. “Yes!
Thank you, Varden. You waited, as you always do,
that I might bear the blame, if any came of it. But I
am used to it,” said the lady, with a kind of solemn
titter, "and that's my comfort!”
“I give you my word, Martha—” said Gabriel.
“Let me give you my word, my dear," interposed his
wife, with a Christian smile, “that such discussions as
these between married people, are much better left
alone. Therefore, if you please, Varden, we'll drop the
subject. I have no wish to pursue it. I could. · I might
say a great deal. But I would rather not. Pray don't
say any more.”
“I don't want to say any more,” rejoined the goaded
locksmith.
“Well then, don't,” said Mrs. Varden.
“Nor did I begin it, Martha,” added the locksmith,
good-humouredly, “I must say that.”
“You did not begin it, Varden!” exclaimed his wife,
opening her eyes very wide and looking round upon the
company, as though she would say, You hear this man!
" You did not begin it, Varden! But you shall not say
I was out of temper. No, you did not begin it, oh,
dear, no, not you, my dear.”
“Well, well," said the locksmith. “That's settled
then."
“Oh, yes,” rejoined his wife, “ quite. If you like to
say Dolly began it, my dear, I shall not contradict you.
I know my duty. I need know it, I am sure. I am

often obliged to bear it in mind, when my inclination
perhaps would be for the moment to forget it. Thank
you, Varden.” And so, with a mighty show of humility
and forgiveness, she folded her hands, and looked
round again, with a smile which plainly said, “If you
desire to see the first and foremost among female
martyrs, here she is, on view!”
This little incident, illustrative though it was of Mrs.
Varden's extraordinary sweetness and amiability, had
so strong a tendency to check the conversation and to
disconcert all parties but that excellent lady, that only
a few monosyllables were uttered until Edward with-
drew; which he presently did, thanking the lady of the
house a great many times for her condescension, and
whispering in Dolly's ear that he would call on the mor-
row, in case there should happen to be an answer to the
note-which, indeed, she knew without his telling, as
Barnaby and his friend Grip had dropped in on the
previous night to prepare her for the visit which was
then terminating.
Gabriel, who had attended Edward to the door, came
back with his hands in his pockets; and, after fidgeting
about the room in a very uneasy manner, and casting a
great many sidelong looks at Mrs. Varden (who with
the calmest countenance in the world was five fathoms
deep in the Protestant Manual), inquired of Dolly how
she meant to go. Dolly supposed by the stage-coach,
and looked at her lady mother, who finding herself
silently appealed to, dived down at least another fathom
into the Manual, and became unconscious of all earthly
things.
“Martha_” said the locksmith.
“I hear you, Varden,” said his wife, without rising
to the surface.
“I am sorry, my dear, you have such an objection to
the Maypole and old John, for otherways as it's a very
fine morning, and Saturday's not a busy day with us,
we might have all three gone to Chigwell in the chaise
and had quite a happy day of it.”
Mrs. Varden immediately closed the Manual, and
bursting into tears, requested to be led up stairs.
“What is the matter now, Martha? inquired the
locksmith.
To which Martha rejoined, “Oh! don't speak to me,”

and protested in agony that if anybody had told her so
she wouldn't have believed it.
“But, Martha," said Gabriel, putting himself in the
way as she was moving off with the aid of Dolly's
shoulder, “wouldn't have believed what? Tell me
what's wrong now. Do tell me. Upon my soul I don't
know. Do you know, child? Damme!” cried the lock-
smith, plucking at his wig in a kind of frenzy, “no-
body does know, I verily believe, but Miggs!"
“Miggs,” said Mrs. Varden, faintly, and with symp-
toms of approaching incoherence, " is attached to me,
and that is sufficient to draw down hatred upon her in
this house. She is a comfort to me whatever she may
be to others.”
“She's no comfort to me,” cried Gabriel, made bold by
despair. “She's the misery of my life. She's all the
plagues of Egypt in one.”
“She's considered so, I have no doubt,” said Mrs.
Varden. “I was prepared for that; its natural; it's of a
piece with the rest. When you taunt me as you do to
my face, how can I wonder that you taunt her behind
her back!” And here the incoherence coming on very
strong, Mrs. Varden wept, and laughed, and sobbed,
and shivered, and hiccoughed, and choked; and said
she knew it was very foolish but she couldn't help it;
and that when she was dead and gone, perhaps they
would be sorry for it—which really under the circum-
stances did not appear quite so probable as she seemed
to think—with a great deal more to the same effect. In
a word, she passed with great decency through all the
ceremonies incidental to such occasions; and being sup-
ported up-stairs, was deposited in a highly spasmodic
state on her own bed, where Miss Miggs shortly after-
wards flung herself upon the body.
The philosophy of all this was, that Mrs. Varden wanted
to go to Chigwell; that she did not want to make any
concession or explanation; that she would only go on
being implored and entreated so to do; and that she
would accept no other terms. Accordingly, after a vast
amount of moaning and crying up-stairs, and much
damping of foreheads, and vinegaring of temples, and
hartshorning of noses, and so forth; and after most
pathetic adjurations from Miggs, assisted by warm
brandy-and-water not over-weak, and divers other cor-

dials, also of a stimulating quality, administered at first
in teaspoonsful and afterwards in increasing doses, and
of which Miss Miggs herself partook as a preventive
measure (for fainting is infectious); after all these
remedies, and many more too numerous to mention, but
not to take, had been applied; and many verbal consola-
tions, moral, religious, and miscellaneous, had been
superadded thereto; the locksmith humbled himself, and
the end was gained.
“If it's only for the sake of peace and quietness,
father,” said Dolly, urging him to go up-stairs.
“Oh, Doll, Doll,” said her good-natured father. If
you ever have a husband of your own-”.
Dolly glanced at the glass.
“Well, when you have,” said the locksmith, “never
faint, my darling. More domestic unhappiness has
come of easy fainting, Doll, than from all the greater
passions put together. Remember that, my dear, if you
would be really happy, which you never can be, if your
husband isn't. And a word in your ear, my precious.
Never have a Miggs about you !"
With this advice he kissed his blooming daughter on
the cheek, and slowly repaired to Mrs. Varden's room;
where that lady, lying all pale and languid on her couch,
was refreshing herself with a sight of her new bonnet,
which Miggs, as a means of calming her scattered
spirits, displayed to the best advantage at her bedside.
“Here's master, mim,” said Miggs. “Oh, what a hap-
piness it is when man and wife come round again! Oh,
gracious, to think that him and her should ever have a
word together !” In the energy of these sentiments,
which were uttered as an apostrophe to the heavens in
general, Miss Miggs perched the bonnet on the top of
her own head, and folding her hands, turned on her
tears.
“I can't help it,” cried Miggs. “I couldn't, if I was
to be drownded in ’em. She has such a forgiving spirit!
She'll forget all that has passed, and go along with you,
siroh, if it was to the world's end, she'd go along with ..
you.”
Mrs. Varden, with a faint smile, gently reproved her
attendent for this enthusiasm, and reminded her at the
same time that she was far to unwell to venture out
that day.

“Oh, no, you're not, mim, indeed you're not,” said
Miggs. I repeal to master; master knows you're not,
mim. The hair and motion of the shay, will do you
good, mim, and you must not give way, you must not,
raly. She must keep up, mustn't she, sir, for all our
sakes? I was a telling her that, just now. She must
remember us, even if she forgets herself. Master will
persuade you, mim, I'm sure. There's Miss Dolly's a
going, you know, and master, and you, and all so happy
and so comfortable. Oh !” cried Miggs, turning on the
tears again, previous to quitting the room in great
emotion, “I never see such a blessed one as she is for
the forgiveness of her spirit, I never, never, never did.
Nor more did master neither; no, nor no one-never !"
For five minutes or thereabouts, Mrs. Varden re-
mained mildly opposed to all her husband's prayers that
she would oblige him by taking a day's pleasure, but
relenting, at length, she suffered herself to be persuaded,
and granting him her free forgiveness (the merit where-
of, she meekly said, rested with the Manual and not
with her), desired that Miggs might come and help her
dress. The handmaid attended promptly, and it is but
justice to their joint exertions to record that, when the
good lady came down-stairs in course of time, completely
decked out for the journey, she really looked as if noth-
ing had happened, and appeared in the very best health
imaginable.
As to Dolly, there she was again, the very pink and
pattern of good looks, in a smart little cherry-coloured
mantle, with a hood of the same drawn over her head,
and upon the top of that hood, a little straw hat trim-
med with cherry-coloured ribbons, and worn the merest
trifle on one side-just enough, in short, to make it the
wickedest and most provoking headdress that ever ma-
licious milliner devised. And not to speak of the manner
in which these cherry-coloured decorations brightened
her eyes, or vied with her lips, or shed a new bloom on
her face, she wore such a cruel little muff, and such a
heart-rending pair of shoes, and was so surrounded and
hemmed in, as it were, by aggravations of all kinds,
that when Mr. Tappertit, holding the horse's head, saw
her come out of the house alone, such impulses came
over him to decoy her into the chaise and drive off like
mad, that he would unquestionably have done it, but for

of his clericald marry
sitatechis excited aim
certain uneasy doubts besetting him as to the shortest
way to Gretna Green; whether it was up the street or
down, or up the right hand turning or the left; and
whether, supposing all the turnpikes to be carried by
storm, the blacksmith in the end would marry them on
credit; which, by reason of his clerical office, appeared,
even to his excited imagination, so unlikely, that he
hesitated. And while he stood hesitating and looking
post-chaises-and-six at Dolly, out came his master and
his mistress, and the constant Miggs, and the oppor-
tunity was gone forever. For now the chaise creaked
upon its spring, and Mrs. Varden was inside; and now
it creaked again, and more than ever, and the lock-
smith was inside; and now it bounded once, as if its
heart beat lightly, and Dolly was inside; and now it was
gone and its place was empty, and he and that dreary
Miggs were standing in the street together.
The hearty locksmith was in as good a humour as if
nothing had occurred for the last twelve months to put
him out of his way, Dolly was all smiles and graces,
and Mrs. Varden was agreeable beyond all precedent.
As they jogged through the streets talking of this thing
and of that, who should be descried upon the pavement
but that very coachmaker, looking so genteel that
nobody would have believed he had ever had anything
to do with a coach but riding in it, and bowing like any
nobleman. To be sure Dolly was confused when she
bowed again, and to be sure the cherry-coloured ribbons
trembled a little when she met his mournful eye, which
seemed to say, “I have kept my word, I have begun, the
business is going to the devil, and you're the cause of
it.” There he stood, rooted to the ground: as Dolly said,
like a statue; and as Mrs. Varden said, like a pump;
till they turned the corner: and when her father thought
it was like his impudence, and her mother wondered
what he meant by it, Dolly blushed again till her very
hood was pale.
But on they went, not the less merrily for this, and
there was the locksmith in the incautious fulness of his
heart “pulling-up” at all manner of places, and evinc-
ing a most intimate acquaintance with all the taverns
on the road, and all the landlords and all the landladies,
with whom, indeed, the little horse was on equally
friendly terms, for he kept on stopping of his own

accord. Never were people so glad to see other people
as these landlords and landladies were to behold Mr.
Varden and Mrs. Varden and Miss Varden; and wouldn't
they get out, said one; and they really must walk up-
stairs, said another; and she would take it ill and be
quite certain they were proud if they wouldn't have a
little taste of something, said a third; and so on, that it
really was quite a Progress rather than a ride, and one
continued scene of hospitality from beginning to end.
It was pleasant enough to be held in such esteem, not
to mention the refreshments; so Mrs. Varden said noth-
ing at the time, and was all affability and delight--but
such a body of evidence as she collected against the
unfortunate locksmith that day, to be used thereafter as
occasion might require, never was got together for mat-
rimonial purposes.
In course of time and in course of a pretty long
time, too-for these agreeable interruptions delayed
them not a little--they arrived upon the skirts of the
Forest, and riding pleasantly on among the trees, came
at last to the Maypole, where the locksmith's cheerful
“Yoho!” speedily brought to the porch old John, and
after him young Joe, both of whom were so transfixed
at sight of the ladies, that for a moment they were per-
fectly unable to give them any welcome, and could do
nothing but stare.
It was only for a moment, however, that Joe forgot
himself, for speedily reviving, he thrust his drowsy
father aside-to Mr. Willet's mighty and inexpressible
indignation-and darting out, stood ready to help them
to alight. It was necessary for Dolly to get out first.
Joe had her in his arms—yes, though for a space of
time no longer than you could count one in, Joe had her
in his arms. Here was a glimpse of happiness!
It would be difficult to describe what a flat and com-
monplace affair the helping Mrs. Varden out afterwards
was, but Joe did it, and did it too with the best grace
in the world. Then old John, who, entertaining a dull
and foggy sort of idea that Mrs. Varden wasn't fond of
him, had been in some doubt whether she might not
have come for purposes of assault and battery, took
courage, hoped she was well, and offered to conduct her
into the house. This tender being amicably received,
they marched in together, Joe and Dolly followed arm-

in-arm (happiness again!), and Varden brought up the
rear.
Old John would have it that they must sit in the bar,
and nobody objecting, into the bar they went. All bars
are snug places, but the Maypole's was the very snug-
gest, cosiest, and completest bar that ever the wit of
man devised. Such amazing bottles in old oaken pigeon-
holes, such gleaming tankards dangling from pegs at
about the same inclination as thirsty men would hold
them to their lips; such sturdy little Dutch kegs ranged
in rows on shelves; so many lemons hanging in separ-
ate nets, and forming the fragrant grove already men-
tioned in this chronicle, suggestive, with goodly loaves
of snowy sugar stowed away hard by, of punch, ideal-
ized beyond all mortal knowledge; such closets, such
presses, such drawers full of pipes, such places for put-
ting things away in hollow window-seats, all crammed
to the throat with eatables, drinkables, or savoury condi-
ments; lastly, and to crown all, as typical of the, im-
mense resources of the establishment and its defiances
to all visitors to cut and come again, such a stupendous
cheese!
It is a poor heart that never rejoices—it must have
been the poorest, weakest, and most watery heart that
ever beat, which would not have warmed towards the
Maypole bar. Mrs. Varden's did directly. She could no
more have reproached John Willet among those house-
hold gods, the kegs and bottles, lemons, pipes, and cheese,
than she could have stabbed him with his own bright
carving-knife. The order for dinner, tooit might have
soothed a savage. “A bit of fish,” said John to the
cook, “and some lamb chops (breaded, with plenty of
ketchup), and a good salad, and a roast spring chicken,
with a dish of sausages and mashed potatoes, or some-
thing of that sort.” Something of that sort! The re-
sources of these inns! To talk carelessly about dishes,
which in themselves were a first-rate holiday kind of
dinner, suitable to one's wedding day, as something of
that sort: meaning, if you can't get a spring chicken,
any other trifle in the way of poultry will do-such as a
peacock, perhaps ! The kitchen, too, with its great,
broad, cavernous chimney; the kitchen, where nothing in
the way of cookery seemed impossible; where you could
believe in anything to eat they chose to tell you of. Mrs.

nsekeeping a head quite of these
Varden returned from the contemplation of these
wonders to the bar again, with a head quite dizzy and
bewildered. Her housekeeping capacity was not large
enough to comprehend them. She was obliged to go to
sleep. Waking was pain in the midst of such im-
mensity.
Dolly, in the meanwhile, whose gay heart and head
ran upon other matters, passed out at the garden door,
and glancing back now and then (but of course not
wondering if Joe saw her), tripped away by a path
across the fields with which she was well acquainted, to
discharge her mission at the Warren; and this deponent
hath been informed and verily believes, that you might
have seen many less pleasant objects than the cherry-
coloured mantle and ribbons as they went fluttering
along the green meadows in the bright light of the day,
like giddy things as they were.
CHAPTER XX.
THE proud consciousness of her trust, and the great
importance she derived from it, might have advertised
it to all the house if she had had to run the gauntlet of
its inhabitants; but as Dolly had played in every dull
room and passage many and many a time, when a child,
and had ever since been the humble friend of Miss
Haredale, whose foster sister she was, she was as free
of the building as the young lady herself. So, using no
greater precaution than holding her breath and walking
on tiptoe as she passed the library door, she went straight
to Emma's room as a privileged visitor.
It was the liveliest room in the building. The chamber
was sombre like the rest for the matter of that, but the
presence of youth and beauty would make a prison
cheerful (saving, alas ! that confinement withers them),
and lend some charms of their own to the gloomiest
scene. Birds, flowers, books, drawing, music, and a
hundred such graceful tokens of feminine loves and
cares, filled it with more of life and human sympathy
than the whole house besides seemed made to hold.
There was heart in the room; and who that has a heart,
ever fails to recognise the silent presence of another!

Embing som
Dolly had one undoubtedly, and it was not a tough one
either, though there was a little mist of coquettishness
about it, such as sometimes surrounds that sun of life
in its morning, and slightly dims its lustre. Thus, when
Emma rose to greet her, and kissing her affectionately
on the cheek, told her, in her quiet way, that she had
been very unhappy, the tears stood in Dolly's eyes, and
she felt more sorry than she could tell; but next moment
she happened to raise them to the glass, and really there
was something there so exceedingly agreeable that, as
she sighed, she smiled, and felt surprisingly consoled.
“I have heard about it, miss,” said Dolly, and it's very
sad indeed, but when things are at the worst they are
sure to mend.”
“But are you sure they are at the worst?” asked
Emma, with a smile.
“Why, I don't see how they can very well be more
unpromising than they are; I really don't,” said Dolly.
“And I bring something to begin with.”
“Not from Edward?"
Dolly nodded and smiled, and feeling in her pockets
(there were pockets in those days) with an affectation of
not being able to find what she wanted, which greatly
enhanced her importance, at length produced the letter.
As Emma hastily broke the seal and became absorbed
in its contents, Dolly's eyes, by one of these strange
accidents for which there is no accounting, wandered
to the glass again. She could not help wondering
whether the coachmaker suffered very much, and quite
pitied the poor man.
It was a long letter-a very long letter, written close
on all four sides of the sheet of paper, and crossed after-
wards; but it was not a consolatory letter, for as Emma
read it she stopped from time to time to put her hand-
kerchief to her eyes. To be sure Dolly marvelled greatly
to see her in so much distress, for to her thinking a love
affair ought to be one of the best jokes, and the slyest,
merriest kind of thing in life. But she set it down in
her own mind that all this came from Miss Haredale's
being so constant, and that if she would only take on
with some other young gentlemen-just in the most in-
nocent way possible, to keep her first lover up to the
mark-she would find herself inexpressibly comforted.
“I am sure that's what I should do if it was me,”

thought Dolly. “To make one's sweetheart miserable
is well enough and quite right, but to be made miserable
one's self is a little too much!”
However, it wouldn't do to say so, and therefore she
sat looking on in silence. She needed a pretty consid-
erable stretch of patience, for when the long letter had
been read once all through it was read again, and when it
had been read twice all through it was read again. During
this tedious process, Dolly beguiled the time in the most
improving manner that occurred to her, by curling her
hair on her fingers, with the aid of the looking-glass be-
fore mentioned, and giving it some killing twists.
Everything has an end. Even young ladies in love
cannot read their own letters forever. In course of
time the packet was folded up, and it only remained to
write the answer.
But as this promised to be a work of time likewise,
Emma said she would put it off until after dinner, and
that Dolly must dine with her. As Dolly had made up
her mind to do so before-hand, she required very little
pressing; and when they had settled this point, they
went to walk in the garden.
They strolled up and down the terrace walks, talking
incessantly—at least, Dolly never left off once-and
making that quarter of the sad and mournful house quite
gay. Not that they talked loudly or laughed much, but
they were both so very handsome, and it was such a
breezy day, and their light dresses and dark curls ap-
peared so free and joyous in their abandonment, and.
Emma was so fair, and Dolly so rosy, and Emma so
delicately shaped, and Dolly so plump, and-in short,
there are no flowers for any garden like such flowers,
let horticulturists say what they may, and both house
and garden seemed to know it, and to brighten up sen-
sibly.
After this came the dinner and the letter-writing, and
some more talking, in the course of which Miss Hare-
dale took occasion to charge upon Dolly certain flirtish
and inconstant propensities, which accusations Dolly
seemed to think very complimentary indeed, and to be
mightily amused with. Finding her quite incorrigible
in this respect, Emma suffered her to depart; but not
before she had confided to her that important and never-
şufficiently-to-be-taken-care-of answer, and endowed

her, moreover, with a pretty little bracelet as a keepsake.
Having clasped it on her arm, and again advised her
half in earnest to amend her roguish ways, for she knew
she was fond of Joe at heart (which Dolly stoutly denied,
with a great many haughty protestations that she hoped
she could do better than that indeed! and so forth), she
bade her farewell; and after calling her back to give her
more supplementary messages for Edward, than any-
body with tenfold the gravity of Dolly Varden could
be reasonably expected to remember, at length dis-
missed her.
Dolly bade her good-bye, and tripping lightly down
the stairs arrived at the dreaded library door, and was
about to pass it again on tiptoe, when it opened, and
behold! there stood Mr. Haredale. Now, Dolly had from
her childhood associated with this gentleman the idea
of something grim and ghostly, and being at the mo-
ment conscience-stricken besides, the sight of him
threw her into such a flurry that she could neither ac-
knowledge his presence nor run away, so she gave a
great start, and then with downcast eyes stood still and
trembled. :
“Come here, girl," said Mr. Haredale, taking her by
the hand. “I want to speak to you."
“If you please, sir, I'm in a hurry,” faltered Dolly,
“and-and you have frightened me by coming so sud-
denly upon me, sir-I would rather go, sir, if you'll be
so good as to let me.”
"Immediately,” said Mr. Haredale, who had by this
time led her into the room and closed the door. « You
shall go directly. You have just left Emma?”
“Yes, sir, just this minute. Father's waiting for me,
sir, if you'll please to have the goodness—”.
"I know, I know,” said Mr. Haredale. “Answer me
a question. What did you bring here to-day?”
“Bring here, sir?” faltered Dolly.
“You will tell me the truth, I am sure. Yes.”
Dolly hesitated for a little while, and somewhat em-
boldened by his manner, said at last, “Well, then, sir,
it was a letter.”
“From Mr. Edward Chester, of course. And you are
the bearer of the answer?”
Dolly hesitated again, and not being able to decide
upon any other course of action, burst into tears.
sir, if know, I know did you brine 11

.
“You alarm yourself without cause,” said Mr. Hare-
dale. “Why are you so foolish? Surely you can answer
me. You know that I have but to put the question to
Emma and learn the truth directly. Have you the
answer with you?”
Dolly had what is popularly called a spirit of her own,
and being now fairly at bay, made the best of it.
“Yes, sir,” she rejoined, trembling and frightened as
she was. “Yes, sir, I have. You may kill me if you
please, sir, but I won't give it up. I'm very sorry-but
I won't. There, sir."
“I commend your firmness and your plain-speaking,”
said Mr. Haredale. “Rest assured that I have as little
desire to take your letter as your life. You are a very
discreet messenger and a good girl.”
Not feeling quite certain, as she afterwards said,
whether he might not be “coming over her” with these
compliments, Dolly kept as far from him as she could,
cried again, and resolved to defend her pocket (for the
letter was there) to the last extremity.
“I have some design,” said Mr. Haredale after a short
silence, during which a smile, as he regarded her, had
struggled through the gloom and melancholy that was
natural to his face,“ of providing a companion for my
niece; for her life is a very lonely one. Would you like
the office? You are the oldest friend she has, and the
best entitled to it.”.
“I don't know, sir," answered Dolly, not sure but he
was bantering her; “I can't say. I don't know what
they might wish at home. I couldn't give an opinion,
sir.”
“If your friends had no objection, would you have
any?” said Mr. Haredale. “Come. There's a plain ques-
tion; and easy to answer.”
“None at all that I know of, sir,” replied Dolly. “I
should be very glad to be near Miss Emma, of course,
and always am."
" That's well,” said Mr. Haredale. “That is all I had
to say. You are anxious to go. Don't let me detain
you.lly didn't had no soon the h
Dolly didn't let him, nor did she wait for him to try,
for the words had no sooner passed his lips than she was
out of the room, out of the house, and in the fields
again.

The first thing to be done, of course, when she came
to herself, and considered what a flurry she had been in,
was to cry afresh; and the next thing, when she re-
flected how well she had got over it, was to laugh heart-
ily. The tears once banished gave place to the smiles,
and at last Dolly laughed so much that she was fain to
lean against a tree, and give vent to her exultation.
When she could laugh no longer and was quite tired.
she put her head-dress to rights, dried her eyes, looked
back very merrily and triumphantly at the Warren
chimneys, which were just visible, and resumed her
walk.
The twilight had come on, and it was quickly growing
dusk, but the path was so familiar to her from frequent
traversing that she hardly thought of this, and certainly
felt no úneasiness at being alone. Moreover, there was
the bracelet to admire; and when she had given it a
good rub, and held it out at arm's length, it sparkled
and glittered so beautifully on her wrist, that to look at
it in every point of view and with every possible turn of
the arm, was quite an absorbing business. There was
the letter too, and it looked so mysterious and knowing,
when she took out of her pocket, and it held, as she
knew, so much inside, that to turn it over and over, and
think about it, and wonder how it began, and how it
ended, and what it said all through, was another matter
of constant occupation. Between the bracelet and the
letter, there was quite enough to do without thinking of
anything else; and admiring each by turns, Dolly went
on gaily.
As she passed through a wicket gate to where the
path was narrow, and lay between two hedges gar-
nished here and there with trees, she heard a rustling
close at hand, which brought her to a sudden stop. She
listened. All was very quiet, and she went on again-
not absolutely frightened, but a little quicker than
before, perhaps, and possibly not quite so much at her
ease, for a check of that kind is startling.
She had no sooner moved on again, than she was con-
scious of the same sound, which was like that of a per-
son tramping stealthily among bushes and brushwood.
Looking towards the spot whence it appeared to come,
she almost fancied she could make out a crouching
figure. She stopped again. All was quiet as before.

On she went once more—decidedly faster now-and
tried to sing softly to herself. It must be the wind.
But how came the wind to blow only when she walked,
and cease when she stood still? She stopped involun-
tarily as she made the reflection, and the rustling noise
stopped likewise. She was really frightened now, and
was yet hesitating what to do, when the bushes crackled
and snapped, and a man came plunging through them,
close before her.
CHAPTER XXI.
It was for the moment an inexpressible relief to Dolly,
to recognise in the person who forced himself into the
path so abruptly, and now stood directly in her way,
Hugh of the Maypole, whose name she uttered in a tone
of delightful surprise that came from her heart.
“Was it you?' she said; "how glad I am to see you!
and how could you terrify me so ?”
In answer to which, he said nothing at all, but stood
quite still, looking at her.
“Did you come to meet me?" asked Dolly.
Hugh nodded, and muttered something to the effect
that he had been waiting for her, and had expected her
sooner.
“I thought likely they would send,” said Dolly, greatly
re-assured by this.
“Nobody sent me,” was his sullen answer. “I came
of my own accord.”
The rough bearing of this fellow, and his wild, uncouth
appearance, had often filled the girl with a vague appre-
hension even when other people were by, and had occa-
sioned her to shrink from him involuntarily. The hav-
ing him for an unbidden companion in so solitary a place,
with the darkness fast gathering about them, renewed
and even increased the alarm she had felt at first.
If his manner had been merely dogged and passively
fierce, as usual, she would have had no greater dislike
to his company than she always felt-perhaps, indeed,
would have been rather glad to have had him at hand.
But there was something of coarse, bold admiration in
his look, which terrified her very much. She glanced
timidly towards him, uncertain whether to go forward

or retreat, and he stood gazing at her like a handsome
satyr; and so they remained for some short time with-
out stirring or breaking silence. At length Dolly took
courage, shot past him, and hurried on.
“Why do you spend so much breath in avoiding me?"
said Hugh, accommodating his pace to hers, and keep-
ing close at her side.
"I wish to get back as quickly as I can, and you walk
too near me,” answered Dolly.
“Too near!” said Hugh, stooping over her so that she
could feel his breath upon her forehead. “Why too
near? You're always proud to me, mistress.”
“I am proud to no one. You mistake me," answered
Dolly. “Fall back, if you please, or go on.”
“Ñay, mistress," he rejoined, endeavouring to draw
her arm through his. “I'll walk with you."
She released herself, and clenching her little hand,
struck him with right good will. At this, Maypole Hugh
burst into a roar of laughter, and passing his arm about
her waist, held her in his strong grasp as easily as if she
had been a bird.
“Ha, ha, ha! Well done, mistress! Strike again. You
shall beat my face, and tear my hair, and pluck my
beard up by the roots, and welcome, for the sake of your
bright eyes. Strike again, mistress. Do. Ha, ha, ha!
I like it."
“Let me go,” she cried, endeavouring with both her
hands to push him off. “Let me go this moment.”
“You had as good be kinder to me, Sweetlips,” said
Hugh. “You had, indeed. Come. Tell me now. Why
are you always so proud? I don't quarrel with you for
it. I love you when you're proud. Ha, ha, ha! You
can't hide your beauty from a poor fellow; that's a com-
fort!"
She gave him no answer, but as he had not yet checked
her progress, continued to press forward as rapidly as
she could. At length, between the hurry she had made,
her terror, and the tightness of his embrace, her strength
failed her, and she could go no further.
“Hugh,” cried the panting girl, “ good Hugh; if you
will leave me I will give you anything-everything I
have—and never tell one word of this to any living
creature."
“You had best not,” he answered. “Harkye, little

dove, you had best not. All about here know me, and
what I dare do if I have a mind. If ever you are going
to tell, stop when the words are on your lips, and think
of the mischief you'll bring, if you do, upon some inno-
cent heads that you wouldn't wish to hurt a hair of.
Bring trouble on me, and I'll bring trouble and some-
thing more on them in return. I care no more for them
than for so many dogs; not so much-why should I?
I'd sooner kill a man than a dog any day. I've never
been sorry for a man's death in all my life, and I have
for a dog's.”
There was something so thoroughly savage in the
manner of these expressions, and the looks anl gestures
by which they were accompanied, that her great fear of
him gave her new strength, and enabled her by a sudden
effort to extricate herself and run fleetly from him. But
Hugh was as nimble, strong, and swift of foot, as any
man in broad England, and it was but a fruitless expen-
diture of energy, for he had her in his encircling arms
again before she had gone a hundred yards.
“Softly, darling-gently-would you fly from rough
Hugh, that loves you as well as any drawing-room
“I would,” she answered, struggling to free herself
again. “I will. Help!”
*“ A fine for crying out,” said Hugh. “Ha, ha, ha! A
fine, pretty one, from your lips. I pay myself! Ha, ha,
ha!"
"Help! Help! Help!” As she shrieked with the ut-
most violence she could exert, a shout was heard in
answer, and another, and another.
“ Thank Heaven!” cried the girl, in an ecstasy. “Joe,
dear Joe, this way. Help!”
Her assailant paused, and stood irresolute for a mo-
ment, but the shouts drawing nearer and coming quick
upon them, forced him to a speedy decision. He released
her, whispered with a menacing look, “Tell him : and
see what follows!” and, leaping the hedge, was gone in
an instant. Dolly darted off, and fairly ran into Joe
Willet's open arms.
“What is the matter? are you hurt? what was it? who
was it? where is he? what was he like?” with a great
many encouraging expressions and assurances of safety,
were the first words Joe poured forth. But poor little
gallant?"

Dolly was so breathless and terrified that for some time
she was quite unable to answer him, and hung upon his
shoulder, sobbing and crying as if her heart would break.
Joe had not the smallest objection to have her hanging
on his shoulder; no, not the least, though it crushed the
cherry-coloured ribbons sadly, and put the smart little
hat out of all shape. But he couldn't bear to see her
cry; it went to his very heart. He tried to console her,
bent over her, whispered to her-some say kissed her,
but that's a fable. At any rate, he said all the kind and
tender things he could think of, and Dolly let him go
on and didn't interrupt him once, and it was a good ten
minutes before she was able to raise her head and thank
him.
“What was it that frightened you?” said Joe.
A man whose person was unknown to her had fol-
lowed her, she answered; he began by begging, and
went on to threats of robbery, which he was on the
point of carrying into execution, and would have exe-
cuted, but for Joe's timely aid. The hesitation and con-
fusion with which she said this, Joe attributed to the
fright she had sustained, and no suspicion of the truth
occurred to him for a moment.
“Stop when the words are on your lips.” A hundred
times that night, and very often afterwards, when the
disclosure was rising to her tongue, Dolly thought of
that, and repressed it. A deeply rooted dread of the
man; the conviction that his ferocious nature, once
roused, would stop at nothing; and the strong as-
surance that if she impeached him, the full measure of
his wrath and vengeance would be wreaked on Joe, who
had preserved her; these were considerations she had
not the courage to overcome, and inducements to
secrecy too powerful for her to surmount.
Joe, for his part, was a great deal too happy to inquire
very curiously into the matter; and Dolly being yet too
tremulous to walk without assistance, they went for-
ward very slowly, and in his mind very pleasantly,
until the Maypole lights were near at hand, twinkling
their cheerful welcome, when Dolly stopped suddenly,
and with a half scream exclaimed.
“ The letter !"
“What letter?" inquired Joe.
" That I was carrying-I had it in my hand, My

169
bracelet, too,” she said, clasping her wrists. "I have lost
them both.”
“Do you mean just now?” said Joe.
“Either I dropped them then, or they were taken
from me,” answered Dolly, vainly searching her pocket
and rustling her dress. "They are gone, both gone.
What an unhappy girl I am!" With these words, poor
Dolly, who to do her justice was quite as sorry for the
loss of the letter as for the bracelet, fell a crying again,
and bemoaned her fate most movingly.
Joe tried to comfort her with the assurance that,
directly he had housed her safely in the Maypole, he
would return to the spot with a lantern (for it was now
quite dark) and make strict search for the missing
articles, which there was great probability of his find-
ing, as it was not likely that anybody had passed that
way since, and she was not conscious of their having
been taken forcibly from her. Dolly thanked him very
heartily for this offer, though with no great hope of his
quest being successful; and so, with many lamentations
on her side, and many hopeful words on his, and much
weakness on the part of Dolly and much tender support-
ing on the part of Joe, they reached the Maypole bar at
last, where the locksmith and his wife and old John were
yet keeping high festival.
Mr. Willet received the intelligence of Dolly's trouble
with that surprising presence of mind and readiness of
speech for which he was so eminently distinguished
above all other men. Mrs. Varden expressed her sym-
pathy for her daughter's distress by scolding her roundly
for being so late; and the honest locksmith divided him-
self between condoling with and kissing Dolly, and shak-
ing hands heartily with Joe, whom he could not suffi-
ciently praise or thank.
In reference to this latter point, old John was far from
agreeing with his friend; for besides that he by no
means approved of an adventurous spirit in the abstract,
it occurred to him that if his son and heir had been seri-
ously damaged in the scuffle, the consequences would
assuredly have been expensive and inconvenient, and
might perhaps have proved detrimental to the Maypole
business. Wherefore, and because he looked with no
favourable eye upon young girls, but rather considered
that they and the whole female sex were a kind of non-

sensical mistake on the part of Nature, he took occasion
to retire and shake his head in private at the boiler; in-
spired by which silent oracle, he was moved to give Joe
various stealthy nudges with his elbow, as a paternal
reproof and gentle admonition to mind his own business
and not make a fool of himself.
Joe, however, took down the lantern and lighted it;
and arming himself with a stout stick, asked whether
Hugh was in the stable.
“He's lying asleep before the kitchen fire, sir,” said
Mr. Willet. “What do you want him for?”
“I want him to come with me to look after this brace-
let and letter,” answered Joe. “Hallo there! Hugh!”
Dolly turned pale as death, and felt as if she must
faint forthwith. After a few moments, Hugh came
staggering in, stretching himself and yawning accord-
ing to custom, and presenting every appearance of hav-
ing been roused from a sound nap.
“Here, sleepy-head,” said Joe, giving him the lantern.
“Carry this, and bring the dog, and that small cudgel
of yours. And woe betide the fellow if we come upon
him."
“What fellow?” growled Hugh, rubbing his eyes and
shaking himself.
“What fellow?" returned Joe, who was in a state of
great valour and bustle; “a fellow you ought to know
of, and be more alive about. It's well for the like of
you, lazy giant that you are, to be snoring your time
away in chimney-corners, when honest men's daughters
can't cross even our quiet meadows at nightfall without
being set upon by footpads, and frightened out of their
precious lives.”
“They never rob me,” cried Hugh, with a laugh. “I
have got nothing to lose. But I'd as lief knock them
at head as any other men. How many are there?”
“ Only one,” said Dolly, faintly, for everybody looked
at her.
“And what was he like, mistress?” said Hugh, with a
glance at young Willet, só slight and momentary that
the scowl it conveyed was lost on all but her. "About
my height?”
“Not-not so tall,” Dolly replied, scarce knowing
what she said.
“ His dress,” said Hugh, looking at her keenly, “like

-like any of ours, now? I know all the people here-
abouts, and maybe could give a guess at the man, if I
had anything to guide me.”
Dolly faltered and turned paler yet; then answered
that he was wrapped in a loose coat and had his face
hidden by a handkerchief, and that she could give no.

“You wouldn't know him if you saw him, then, be-
like?” said Hugh, with a malicious grin.
“I should not,” answered Dolly, bursting into tears
again. “I don't wish to see him. I can't bear to think
of him. I can't talk about him any more. Don't go to
look for these things, Mr. Joe, pray don't. I entreat
you not to go with that man.”
“Not to go with me,” cried Hugh. “I'm too rough
for them all. They're all afraid of me. Why, bless
you, mistress, I've the tenderest heart alive. I love all
the ladies, ma’am,” said Hugh, turning to the locksmith's
wife.
Mrs. Varden opined that if he did, he ought to be
ashamed of himself, such sentiments being more con-
sistent (so she argued) with a benighted Mussulman or
wild Islander than with a staunch Protestant. Arguing
from this imperfect state of his morals, Mrs. Varden
further opined that he had never studied the Manual.
Hugh admitting that he never had, and moreover that
he couldn't read, Mrs. Varden declared, with much
severity, that he ought to be even more ashamed of him-
self than before, and strongly recommended him to
save up his pocket-money for the purchase of one, and
further to teach himself the contents with all convenient
diligence. She was still pursuing this train of discourse,
when Hugh somewhat unceremoniously and irreverently
followed his young master out, and left her to edify the
rest of the company. This she proceeded to do, and
finding that Mr. Willet's eyes were fixed upon her with
an appearance of deep attention, gradually addressed
the whole of her discourse to him, whom she entertained
with a moral and theological lecture of considerable
length, in the conviction that great workings were
taking place in his spirit. The simple truth was, how-
ever, that Mr. Willet, although his eyes were wide open
and he saw a woman before him whose head by long
and steady looking at seemed to grow bigger and bigger

until it filled the whole bar, was to all other intents and
purposes fast asleep; and so sat leaning back in his
chair, with his hands in his pockets, until his son's return
caused him to wake up with a deep sigh, and a faint im-
pression that he had been dreaming about pickled pork
and greens-a vision of his slumbers which was no
doubt referable to the circumstance of Mrs. Varden's
having frequently pronounced the word “Grace” with
much emphasis; which word, entering the portals of
Mr. Willet's brain as they stood ajar, and coupling itself
with the words“ before meat,” which were there ranging
about, did in time suggest a particular kind of meat to-
gether with that description of vegetable which is
usually its companion.
The search was wholly unsuccessful. Joe had groped
along the path a dozen times, and among the grass, and
in the dry ditch, and in the hedge, but all in vain. Dolly,
who was quite inconsolable for her loss, wrote a note to
Miss Haredale giving her the same account of it that
she had given at the Maypole, which Joe undertook to
deliver as soon as the family were stirring next day.
That done, they sat down to tea in the bar, where there
was an uncommon display of buttered toast, and in
order that they might not grow faint for want of sus-
tenance, and might have a decent halting-place or half-
way house between dinner and supper-a few savoury
trifies in the shape of great rashers of broiled ham,
which being well cured, done to a turn, and smoking
hot, sent forth a tempting and delicious fragrance.
Mrs. Varden was seldom very Protestant at meals,
unless it happened that they were under-done, or over-
done, or indeed that anything occurred to put her out of
humour. Her spirits rose considerably on beholding
these goodly preparations, and from the nothingness of
good works, she passed to the somethingness of ham and
toast with great cheerfulness. Nay, under the influence
of these wholesome stimulants, she sharply reproved her
daughter for being low and despondent (which she con-
sidered an unacceptable frame of mind), and remarked,
as she held her own plate for a fresh supply, that it would
be well for Dolly, who pined over the loss of a toy and a
sheet of paper, if she would reflect upon the voluntary
sacrifices of the missionaries in foreign parts, who lived
chiefly on salads.

The proceedings of such a day occasioned various
fluctuations in the human thermometer, and especially
in instruments so sensitively and delicately constructed
as Mrs. Varden. Thus, at dinner Mrs. V. stood at sum-
mer heat; genial, smiling, and delightful. After dinner,
in the sunshine of the wine, she went up at least half á
dozen degrees, and was perfectly enchanting. As its
effect subsided, she fell rapidly, went to sleep for an
hour or so at temperate, and woke at something below
freezing. Now she was at summer heat again, in the
shade; and when tea was over, and old John, producing
a bottle of cordial from one of the oaken cases, insisted
on her sipping two glasses thereof in slow succession,
she stood steadily at ninety for one hour and a quarter.
Profiting by experience, the locksmith took advantage
of this genial weather to smoke his pipe in the porch,
and in consequence of this prudent management, he was
fully prepared, when the glass went down again, to
start homewards directly.
The horse was accordingly put in, and the chaise
brought round to the door. Joe, who would on no ac-
count be dissuaded from escorting them until they had
passed the most dreary and solitary part of the road, led
out the grey mare at the same time; and having helped
Dolly into her seat (more happiness!) sprung gaily into
the saddle. Then, after many good-nights and admoni-
tions to wrap up, and glancing of lights, and handing in
of cloaks and shawls, the chaise rolled away, and Joe
trotted beside it-on Dolly's side, no doubt, and pretty
close to the wheel, too.

CHAPTER XXII.
op off her bend, all ch!
It was a fine, bright night, and for all her lowness of
spirits Dolly kept looking up at the stars in a manner so
bewitching (and she knew it!) that Joe was clean out of
his senses, and plainly showed that if ever a man were
—not to say over head and ears, but over the Monument
and the top of Saint Paul's, in love, that man was him-
self. The road was a very good one; not at all a jolting
road, or an uneven one; and yet Dolly held the side of
the chaise with one little hand, all the way. If there
had been an executioner behind him with an uplifted
axe ready to chop off his head if he touched that hand
Joe couldn't have helped doing it. From putting his own
hand upon it as if by chance, and taking it away again
after a minute or so, he got to riding along without taking
it off at all; as if he, the escort, were bound to do that as
an important part of his duty, and had come out for the
purpose. The most curious circumstance about this little
incident was, that Dolly didn't seem to know of it. She
looked so innocent and unconscious when she turned
her eyes on Joe, that it was quite provoking.
She talked though; talked about her fright, and about
Joe's coming up to rescue her, and about her gratitude,
and about her fear that she might not have thanked him
enough, and about their always being friends from that
time forth—and about all that sort of thing. And when
Joe said, not friends he hoped, Dolly was quite surprised,
and said not enemies she hoped; and when Joe said,
couldn't they be something much better than either,
Dolly all of a sudden found out a star which was brighter
than all the other stars, and begged to call his attention
to the same, and was ten thousand times more innocent
and unconscious than ever.
In this manner they travelled along, talking very little
above a whisper, and wishing the road could be stretched
out to some dozen times its natural length at least that
was Joe's desire—when, as they were getting clear of
the forest and emerging on the more frequented road,
they heard behind them the sound of a horse's feet at a
round trot, which growing rapidly louder as it grew

nearer, elicited a scream from Mrs. Varden, and the cry
“à friend!” from the rider, who now came panting up,
and checked his horse beside them.
“This man again !” cried Dolly, shuddering.
“Hugh!” said Joe. “What errand are you upon ?"
“I come to ride back with you,” he answered,
glancing covertly at the locksmith's daughter. “He sent
me.”
“My father !” said poor Joe, adding under his breath,
with a very unfilial apostrophe, “ Will he never think
me man enough to take care of myself ?”
“ Aye!" returned Hugh to the first part of the in-
quiry. “The roads are not safe just now,” he says,
and you'd better have a companion.”
“Ride on, then,” said Joe. “I'm not going to turn
yet.”
Hugh complied, and they went on again. It was his
whim or humour to ride immediately before the chaise,
and from this position he constantly turned his head
and looked back. Dolly felt that he looked at her, but
she averted her eyes and feared to raise them once, so
great was the dread with which he had inspired her.
This interruption and the consequent wakefulness of
Mrs. Varden, who had been nodding in her sleep up to
this point, except for a minute or two at a time, when
she roused herself to scold the locksmith for maliciously
taking hold of her to prevent her nodding herself out
of the chaise, put a restraint upon the whispered con-
versation, and made it difficult of resumption. Indeed,
before they had gone another mile, Gabriel stopped at
his wife's desire, and that good lady protested she would
not hear of Joe's going a step further on any account
whatever. It was in vain for Joe to protest on the other
hand that he was by no means tired, and would turn
back presently, and would see them safely past such
and such a point, and so forth. Mrs. Varden was obdu-
rate, and being so was not to be overcome by mortal
agency.
“Good-night-if I must say it,” said Joe, sorrowfully.
“Good-night,” said Dolly. She would have added,
“ Take care of that man, and pray don't trust him,"
but he had turned his horse's head, and was standing
close to them. She had, therefore, nothing for it but to
suffer Joe to give her hand a gentle squeeze, and when

aher handsing a chavon't you te
the chaise had gone on for some distance, to look back
and wave it, as he still lingered on the spot where they
had parted, with the tall, dark figure of Hugh beside
him.
What she thought about going home, and whether the
coachmaker held as favourable a place in her medita-
tions as he had occupied in the morning, is unknown.
They reached home at last—at last, for it was a long
way, made none the shorter by Mrs. Varden's grumbling.
Miggs, hearing the sound of wheels, was at the door
immediately.
“Here they are; Simmun! Here they are!” cried
Miggs, clapping her hands, and issuing forth to help her
mistress to alight. “Bring a chair, Simmun. Now,
ain't you the better for it, mim? Don't you feel more
yourself than you would have done if you'd have stopped
at home? Oh, gracious! how cold you are! Goodness
me, sir, she's a perfect heap of ice.”
"I can't help it, my good girl. You had better take
her in to the fire,” said the locksmith. .
“Master sounds unfeeling, mim,” said Miggs, in a tone
of commiseration, “but such is not his intentions, I'm
sure. After what he has seen of you this day, I never
will believe but that he has a deal more affection in his
heart than to speak unkind. Come in and sit yourself
down by the fire; there's a good dear-do."
Mrs. Varden complied. The locksmith followed with
his hands in his pockets, and Mr. Tappertit trundled off
with the chaise to a neighbouring stable.
“Martha, my dear,” said the locksmith, when they
reached the parlour, “if you'll look to Dolly yourself,
or let somebody else do it, perhaps it will be only kind
and reasonable. She has been frightened, you know,
and is not at all well to-night.”
. In fact Dolly had thrown herself upon the sofa, quite
regardless of all the little finery of which she had been
so proud in the morning, and with her face buried in her
hands was crying very much.
At first sight of this phenomenon (for Dolly was by
no means accustomed to displays of this sort, rather
learning from her mother's example to avoid them as
much as possible) Mrs. Varden expressed her belief that
never was any woman so beset as she: that her life was
a continued scene of trial; that whenever she was dis-

posed to be well and cheerful, so sure were the people
around her to throw, by some means or other, a damp
upon her spirits; and that, as she had enjoyed herself
that day, and Heaven knew it was very seldom she did
enjoy herself, so she was now to pay the penalty. To
all such propositions Miggs assented freely. Poor
Dolly, however, grew none the better for these restora-
tives, but rather worse, indeed; and seeing that she was
really ill, both Mrs. Varden and Miggs were moved to
compassion, and tended her in earnest.
But even then, their very kindness shaped itself into
their usual course of policy, and though Dolly was in a
swoon, it was rendered clear to the meanest capacity
that Mrs. Varden was the sufferer. Thus when Dolly
began to get a little better, and passed into that stage
in which matrons hold that remonstrance and argument
may be successfully applied, her mother represented to
her, with tears in her eyes, that if she had been flurried
and worried that day, she must remember it was the
common lot of humanity, and in especial of womankind,
who, through the whole of their existence must expect no
less, and were bound to make up their minds to meek
endurance and patient resignation. Mrs. Varden en-
treated her to remember that one of these days she
would, in all probability, have to do violence to her
feelings so far as to be married; and that marriage, as
she might see every day of her life (and truly she did),
was a state requiring great fortitude and forbearance.
She represented to her in lively colours that if she (Mrs.
V.) had not, in steering her course through this vale of
tears, been supported by a strong principle of duty which
alone upheld and prevented her from drooping, she must
have been in her grave many years ago; in which case
she desired to know what would have become of that
errant spirit (meaning the locksmith), of whose eyes she
was the very apple, and in whose path she was, as it
were, a shining light and guiding star?
Miss Miggs also put in her word to the same effect.
She said that indeed and indeed Miss Dolly might take
pattern by her blessed mother, who, she always had said,
and always would say, though she were to be hanged,
drawn, and quartered for it next minute, was the mild-
est, amiablest, forgivingest-spirited, longest-suffering-
est female as ever she could have believed; the mere

narration of whose excellencies had worked such a whole-
some change in the mind of her own sister-in-law that,
whereas before she and her husband lived like cat and
dog, and were in the habit of exchanging brass candle-
sticks, pot-lids, flat-irons, and other such strong resent-

couple upon earth; as could be proved any day on ap-
plication at Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin,
second bell handle on the right-hand door-post. After
glancing at herself as a comparatively worthless vessel,
but still as one of some desert, she besought her to bear
in mind that her aforesaid dear and only mother was
of a weakly constitution and excitable temperament,
who had constantly to sustain afflictions in domestic
life, compared with which, thieves and robbers were as
nothing, and yet never sunk down or gave. way to des-
pair or wrath, but, in prize-fighting phraseology, always
came up to time with a cheerful countenance, and went
in to win as if nothing had happened. When Miggs
had finished her solo, her mistress struck in again, and
the two together performed a duet to the same pur-
pose; the burden being, that Mrs. Varden was perse-
cuted perfection, and Mr. Varden, as the representative
of mankind in that apartment, a creature of vicious and
brutal habits, utterly insensible to the blessings he en-
joyed. Of so refined a character, indeed, was their
talent of assault under the mask of sympathy, that
when Dolly, recovering, embraced her father tenderly,
as in vindication of his goodness, Mrs. Varden ex-
pressed her solemn hope that this would be a lesson to
him for the remainder of his life, and that he would do
some little justice to a woman's nature ever afterwards
-in which aspiration Miss Miggs, by divers sniffs and
coughs, more significant than the longest oration, ex-
pressed her entire concurrence.
But the great joy of Miggs's heart was, that she not
only picked up a full account of what had happened,
but had the exquisite delight of conveying it to Mr.
Tappertit for his jealousy and torture. For that gen-
tleman, on account of Dolly's indisposition, had been
requested to take his supper in the workshop, and it
was conveyed thither by Miss Miggs's own fair hands.
“Oh, Simmun!" said the young lady, “such goings
on to-day! Oh, gracious me, Simmun!”

Mr. Tappertit, who was not in the best of humours,
and who disliked Miss Miggs more when she laid her
hand on her heart and panted for breath than at any
other time, as her deficiency of outline was most ap-
parent under such circumstances, eyed her over in his
loftiest style, and deigned to express no curiosity what-
ever,
“I never heard the like, nor nobody else,” pursued
Miggs. “The idea of interfering with her. What people.
can see in her to make it worth their while to do so,
that's the joke-he, he, he!”
Finding there was a lady in the case, Mr. Tappertit
haughtily requested his fair friend to be more explicit,
and demanded to know what she meant by “her.”
“Why, that Dolly," said Miggs, with an extremely
sharp emphasis on the name. “But, oh, upon my word
and honour, young Joseph Willet is a brave one; and he
do deserve her, that he do."
“Woman!” said Mr. Tappertit, jumping off the counter
on which he was seated; "beware!”
“My stars, Simmum!” cried Miggs, in affected aston-
ishment. “You frighten me to death! What's the
matter?”
“There are strings,” said Mr. Tappertit, flourishing his
bread-and-cheese knife in the air, “in the human heart
that had better not be wibrated. That's what's the
matter."
“Oh, very well-if you're in a huff,” cried Miggs, turn-
ing away.
*Huff or no huff,” said Mr. Tappertit, detaining her
by the wrist. “What do you mean, Jezebel? What
were you going to say? Answer me!”
Notwithstanding this uncivil exhortation, Miggs
gladly did as she was required; and told him how that
their young mistress, being alone in the meadows after
dark, had been attacked by three or four tall men, who
would have certainly borne her away and perhaps mur-
dered her, but for the timely arrival of Joseph Willet,
who with his own single hand put them all to flight,
and rescued her; to the lasting admiration of his fel-
low-creatures generally, and to the eternal love and
gratitude of Dolly Varden.
“Very good,” said Mr. Tappertit, fetching a long
breath when the tale was told, and rubbing his hair up

till it stood stiff and straight on end all over his head.
“His days are numbered."
“Oh, Šimmun!”
“I tell you,” said the 'prentice, “his days are num-
bered. Leave me. Get along with you."
Miggs departed at his bidding, but less because of his
bidding than because she desired to chuckle in secret.
When she had given vent to her satisfaction she returned
to the parlour; where the locksmith, stimulated by quiet-
ness and Toby, had become talkative, and was disposed
to take a cheerful review of the occurrences of the day.
But Mrs. Varden, whose practical religion (as is not un-
common) was usually of the retrospective order, cut him
short by declaiming on the sinfulness of such junketings,
and holding that it was high time to go to bed. To bed
therefore she withdrew, with an aspect as grim and
gloomy as that of the Maypole's own state couch; and
to bed the rest of the establishment soon afterwards
repaired.
CHAPTER XXIII.
TWILIGHT had given place to night some hours, and it
was high noon in those quarters of the town in which
“the world” condescended to dwell—the world being
then, as now, of very limited dimensions and easily
lodged—when Mr. Chester reclined upon a sofa in his
dressing-room in the Temple, entertaining himself with
a book.
He was dressing, as it seemed, by easy stages, and
having performed half the journey, was taking a long
rest. Completely attired as to his legs and feet in the
trimmest fashion of the day, he had yet the remainder
of his toilet to perform. The coat was stretched, like a
refined scarecrow, on its separate horse; the waistcoat
was displayed to the best advantage; the various orna-
mental articles of dress were severally set out in most
alluring order; and yet he lay dangling his legs between
the sofa and the ground, as intent upon his book as if
there was nothing but bed before him.
“Upon my honour,” he said, at length raising his eyes
to the ceiling with the air of a man who was reflecting
seriously on what he had read; “upon my honour, the

most masterly composition, the most delicate thoughts,
the finest code of morality, and the most gentlemanly
sentiments in the universe! Ah Ned, Ned, if you would
but form your mind by such precepts, we should have
but one common feeling on every subject that could pos-
sibly arise between us!”
This apostrophe was addressed, like the rest of his re-
marks, to empty air: for Edward was not present, and
the father was quite alone.
“My Lord Chesterfield,” he said, pressing his hand
tenderly upon the book as he laid it down, " if I could
but have profited by your genius soon enough to have
formed my son on the model you have left to all wise
fathers, both he and I would have been rich men. Shak-
speare was undoubtedly very fine in his way; Milton
good, though prosy; Lord Bacon deep, and decidedly
knowing; but the writer who should be his country's
pride is my Lord Chesterfield.”
He became thoughtful again, and the toothpick was
in requisition.
“I thought I was tolerably accomplished as a man of
the world,” he continued;“ Í flattered myself that I was
pretty well versed in all those little arts and graces
which distinguish men of the world from boors or peas-
ants, and separate their character from those intensely
vulgar sentiments which are called the national char-
acter. Apart from any natural prepossession in my
own favour, I believed I was. Still, in every page of
this enlightened writer, I find some captivating hypoc-
risy which has never occurred to me before, or some
superlative piece of selfishness to which I was utterly a
stranger. I should quite blush for myself before this
stupendous creature, if, remembering his precepts, one
might blush at anything. An amazing man! a noble-
man indeed! any King or Queen may make a Lord, but
only the Devil himself—and the Graces-can make a
Chesterfield.”
Men who are thoroughly false and hollow, seldom try
to hide those vices from themselves; and yet in the very
act of avowing them, they lay claim to the virtues
they feign most to despise. “For,” say they, “this is
honesty, this is truth. All mankind are like us, but they
have not the candour to avow it.” The more they af-
fect to deny the existence of any sincerity in the world,

the more they would be thought to possess it in its
boldest shape; and this is an unconscious compliment to
Truth on the part of these philosophers, which will turn
the laugh against them to the Day of Judgment.
Mr. Chester, having extolled his favourite author as
above recited, took up the book again in the excess of
his admiration and was composing himself for a further
perusal of its sublime morality, when he was disturbed
by a noise at the outer door; occasioned as it seemed by
the endeavours of his servant to obstruct the entrance of
some unwelcome visitor.
“ A late hour for an importunate creditor,” he said,
rising his eyebrows with as indolent an expression of
wonder as if the noise were in the street, and one with
which he had not the smallest personal concern. “Much
after their accustomed time. The usual pretence, I sup-
pose. No doubt a heavy payment to make up to-morrow.
Poor fellow, he loses time, and time is money, as the
good proverb says—I never found it out, though. Well.
What now? You know I am not at home.”
6 A man, sir," replied the servant, who was to the
full as cool and negligent in his ways as his master,
“has brought home the riding-whip you lost the other
day. I told him you were out, but he said he was to
wait while I brought it in, and wouldn't go till I did.”
“He was quite right,” returned his master, “and
you're a blockhead, possessing no judgment or discretion
whatever. Tell him to come in, and see that he rubs
his shoes for exactly five minutes first."
The man laid the whip on a chair, and withdrew.
The master, who had only heard his foot upon the
ground and had not taken the trouble to turn round and
look at him, shut his book, and pursued the train of
ideas his entrance had disturbed.
6. If time were money," he said, handling his snuff-
box, “I would compound with my creditors, and give
them-let me see—how much a day? There's my nap
after dinner-an hour—they're extremely welcome to
that, and to make the most of it. In the morning, be-
tween my breakfast and the paper, I could spare them ·
another hour; in the evening, before dinner, say another.
Three hours a day. They might pay themselves in
calls, with interest, in twelve months. I think I shall
propose it to them. Ah, my centaur, are you there?"

“ Here I am,” replied Hugh, striding in, followed by
a dog as rough and sullen as himself; “and trouble
enough I've had to get here. What do you ask me to
come for, and keep me out when I do come?”
“My good fellow,” returned the other, raising his
head a little from the cushion, and carelessly surveying
him from top to toe, “I am delighted to see you, and to
have, in your being here, the very best proof that you
are not kept out. How are you?”
“I'm well enough,” said Hugh, impatiently.
“ You look a perfect marvel of health. Sit down.”
“I'd rather stand,” said Hugh.
“Please yourself, my good fellow," returned Mr.
Chester, rising, slowly pulling off the loose robe he wore,
and sitting down before the dressing-glass. “Please
yourself by all means.”
Having said this in the politest and blandest tone pos-
sible, he went on dressing, and took no further notice
of his guest, who stood in the same spot, uncertain
what to do next, eyeing him sulkily from time to time.
“Are you going to speak to me, master?” he said, after
a long silence.
“My worthy creature,” returned Mr. Chester, “you
are a little ruffled and out of humour. I'll wait till
you're quite yourself again. I am in no hurry."
This behaviour had its intended effect. It humbled
and abashed the man, and made him still more irresolute
and uncertain. Hard words he could have returned,
violence he would have repaid with interest; but this
cool, complacent, contemptuous, self-possessed recep-
tion, caused him to feel his inferiority more completely
than the most elaborate arguments. Everything con-
tributed to this effect. His own rough speech, contrasted
with the soft, persuasive accents of the other; his rude
bearing, and Mr. Chester's polished manner; the dis-
order and negligence of his ragged dress, and the elegant
attire he saw before him: with all the unaccustomed
luxuries and comforts of the room, and the silence that
gave him leisure to observe these things, and feel how
ill at ease they made him; all these influences, which
have too often some effect on tutored minds and become
of almost resistless power when brought to bear on such
a mind as his, quelled Hugh completely. He moved by
little and little nearer Mr. Chester's chair, and glancing

over his shoulder at the reflection of his face in the
glass, as if seeking for some encouragement in its ex-
pression, said at length, with a rough attempt at con-
ciliation:
“Are you going to speak to me, master, or am I to go
away?”
“Špeak you,” said Mr. Chester, “speak you, good
fellow. I have spoken, have I not? I am waiting for
you.”
“Why, look’ee, sir,” returned Hugh, with increased
embarrassment, “ am I the man that you privately left
your whip with before you rode away from the May-
pole, and told to bring it back whenever he might want
to see you on a certain subject?”
“No doubt the same, or you have a twin brother,"
said Mr. Chester, glancing at the reflection of his anxious
face; “ which is not probable, I should say."
“Then I have come, sir," said Hugh, “and I have
brought it back, and something else along with it. A
letter, sir, it is, that I took from the person who had
charge of it.” As he spoke, he laid upon the dressing-
table Dolly's lost epistle. The very letter that had cost
her so much trouble.
“ Did you obtain this by force, my good fellow?" said
Mr. Chester, casting his eye upon it without the least
perceptible surprise or pleasure.
“Not quite,” said Hugh. “Partly.”.
“Who was the messenger from whom you took it?”
“A woman. One Varden's daughter."
“Oh, indeed!” said Mr. Chester, gaily. “What else did
you take from her?”
“What else?”
“Yes," said the other, in a drawling manner, for he
was fixing a very small patch of sticking-plaster on a
very small pimple near the corner of his mouth. “What
else?”
“Well—a kiss,” replied Hugh, after some hesitation.
“And what else?”
“Nothing."
“I think,” said Mr. Chester, in the same easy tone,
and smiling twice or thrice to try if the patch adhered
_“I think there was something else. I have heard a
trifle of jewellery spoken of-a mere trifle-a thing of
such little value, indeed, that you may have forgotten

it. Do you remember anything of the kind-such as a'
bracelet, now, for instance?"
Hugh with a muttered oath thrust his hand into his
breast, and drawing the bracelet forth, wrapped in a
scrap of hay, was about to lay it on the table likewise,
when his patron stopped his hand and bade him put it
up again.
“You took that for yourself, my excellent friend,” he
said, “and may keep it. I am neither a thief nor a re-
ceiver. Don't show it to me. You had better hide it
again, and lose no time. Don't let me see where you put
it either,” he added, turning away his head.
“You're not a receiver!” said Hugh, bluntly, despite
the increasing awe in which he held him. “What do
you call that, master?” striking the letter with his heavy
hand.
“I call that quite another thing," said Mr. Chester,
coolly. I shall prove it presently, as you will see. You
are thirsty, I suppose?”
Hugh drew his sleeve across his lips, and gruffly
answered yes.
“Step to that closet, and bring me a bottle you will
see there, and a glass.”
He obeyed. His patron followed him with his eyes,
and when his back was turned, smiled as he had never
done when he stood beside the mirror. On his return,
he filled the glass and bade him drink. That dram de-
spatched, he poured him out another, and another.
*“How many can you bear?” he said, filling the glass
again.
“As many as you like to give me. Pour on. Fill
high. A bumper with a bead in the middle! Give me
enough of this,” he added, as he tossed it down his hairy
throat, “and I'll do murder if you ask me!"
“As I don't mean to ask you, and you might possibly
do it without being invited if you went on much
further,” said Mr. Chester, with great composure, we
will stop, if agreeable to you, my good friend, at the
next glass. You were drinking before you came here."
“I always am when I can get it,” cried Hugh, boister-
ously, waving the empty glass above his head, and
throwing himself into a rude dancing attitude. “I al-
ways am. Why not? Ha, ha, ha! What's so good to
me as this? What ever has been? What else has kept

awaving tire of a me I shold ha
away the cold on bitter nights, and driven hunger off in
starving times? What else has given me the strength
and courage of a man, when men would have left me to
die, a puny child? I should never have had a man's
heart but for this. I should have died in a ditch. Where's
he who when I was a weak and sick wretch, with trem-
bling legs and fading sight, bade me cheer up as this
did? I never knew him; not I. I drink to the drink,
master. Ha, ha, ha!”
“You are an exceedingly cheerful young man,” said
Mr.Chester, putting on his cravat with great deliberation,
and slightly moving his head from side to side to settle
his chin in its proper place. “Quite a boon com-
panion."
“Do you see this hand, master,” said Hugh, “and
this arm?” baring the brawny limb to the elbow. “It
was once mere skin and bone, and would have been
dust in some poor churchyard by this time, but for the
drink.”
“You may cover it,” said Mr. Chester, “it's suffi-
ciently real in your sleeve.”
“Ishould never have been spirited up to take a kiss from
the proud little beauty, master, but for the drink,” cried
Hugh. “Ha, ha, ha! It was a good one. As sweet as
honeysuckle, I warrant you. I thank the drink for it.
I'll drink to the drink again, master. Fill me one more.
Come. One more!"
“You are such a promising fellow,” said his patron,
putting on his waistcoat with great nicety, and taking
no heed of this request, “ that I must caution you against
having too many impulses from the drink, and getting
hung before your time. What's your age?"
“I don't know.”
“At any rate,” said Mr. Chester, “ you are young
enough to escape what I may call a natural death for
some years to come. How can you trust yourself in my
hands on so short an acquaintance, with a halter round
your neck. What a confiding nature yours must be!"
Hugh fell back a pace or two and surveyed him with a
look of mingled terror, indignation and surprise. Re-
garding himself in the glass with the same complacency
as before, and speaking as smoothly as if he were dis-
cussing some pleasant chit-chat of the town, his patron
went on:

“Robbery on the king's highway, my young friend, is
a very dangerous and ticklish occupation. It is pleasant,
I have no doubt, while it lasts; but like many other
pleasures in this transitory world, it seldom lasts long.
And really if, in the ingenạousness of youth, you open
your heart so readily on the subject, I am afraid your
career will be an extremely short one.”
“How's this?” said Hugh. “What do you talk of,
master? Who was it set me on?”
“ Who?" said Mr. Chester, wheeling sharply round.
and looking full at him for the first time. “I didn't hear
you. Who was it?”
Hugh faltered and muttered something which was not
audible.
“Who was it? I am curious to know,” said Mr.
Chester, with surpassing affability. “Some rustic beauty,
perhaps? But be cautious, my good friend. They are
not always to be trusted. Do take my advice now, and
be careful of yourself.”
With these words he turned to the glass again, and
went on with his toilet.
Hugh would have answered him that he, the questioner
himself, had set him on, but the words stuck in his
throat. The consummate art with which his patron had
led him to this point, and managed the whole conversa-
tion, perfectly baffled him. He did not doubt that if he
had made the retort which was on his lips when Mr.
Chester turned round and questioned him so keenly, he
would straightway have given him into custody and had
him dragged before a justice with the stolen propety
upon him; in which case it was as certain he would have
been hung as it was that he had been born. The ascen-
dency which it was the purpose of the man of the world
to establish over this savage instrument, was gained
from that time. Hugh's submission was complete. He
dreaded him beyond description; and felt that accident
and artifice had spun a web about him which at a touch
from such a master-hand as his would bind him to the
gallows.
With these thoughts passing through his mind, and
yet wondering at the very same time how he who came
there rioting in the confidence of this man (as he thought),
should be so soon and so thoroughly subdued, Hugh
stood cowering before him, regarding him uneasily from

time to time, while he finished dressing. When he had
done so, he took up the letter, broke the seal, and throw-
ing himself back in his chair, read it leisurely through.
“ Very neatly worded, upon my life! Quite a woman's
letter, full of what people call tenderness, and disinter-
estedness, and heart, and all that sort of thing!"
As he spoke, he twisted it up, and glancing lazily
round at Hugh as though he would say “You see this?”
held it in the flame of the candle. When it was in full
blaze, he tossed it into the grate, and there it smouldered
away.
“ It was directed to my son,” he said, turning to Hugh,
and you did quite right to bring it here. I opened it on
my own responsibility, and you see what I have done
with it. Take this for your trouble.”
Hugh stepped forward to receive the piece of money
he held out to him. As he put it in his hand he added:
“If you should happen to find anything else of this
sort, or to pick up any kind of information you may
think I would like to have, bring it here, will you, my
good fellow?”
This was said with a smile which implied-or Hugh
thought it did—“ fail to do so at your peril!” He an-
swered that he would.
“And don't,” said his patron, with an air of the very
kindest patronage,“ don't be at all downcast or uneasy
respecting that little rashness we have been speaking
of. Your neck is as safe in my hands, my good fellow,
as though a baby's fingers clasped it, I assure you. Take
another glass. You are quieter now.”
Hugh accepted it from his hand, and looking stealthily
at his smiling face, drank ihe contents in silence.
“Don't you-ha, ha!-don't you drink to the drink any
more?” said Mr. Chester, in his most winning manner.
“To you, sir," was the sullen answer, with something
approaching to a bow. “I drink to you."
* Thank you. God bless you. By-the-bye, what is
your name, my good soul? You are called Hugh, I
know, of course—your other name?”
“ I have no other name.”
“A very strange fellow! Do you mean that you never
knew one, or that you don't choose to tell it? Which?”
“I'd tell it if I could,” said Hugh, quickly. “I can't.
I have been always called Hugh; nothing more. I never

knew, nor saw, nor thought about a father; and I was
a boy of six—that's not very old—when they hung my
mother up at Tyburn for a couple of thousand men to
stare at. They might have let her live. She was poor
enough.”
“How very sad!” exclaimed his patron, with a con-
descending smile. “I have no doubt she was an ex-
ceedingly fine woman.”
“You see that dog of mine?” said Hugh, abruptly.
“Faithful, I dare say? ” rejoined his patron, looking
at him through his glass; "and immensely clever? Vir-
tuous and gifted animals, whether man or beast, always
are so very hideous.”
“Such a dog as that, and one of the same breed, was
the only living thing except me that howled that day,”
said Hugh. “Out of the two thousand odd—there was
a larger crowd for its being a woman—the dog and I
alone had any pity. If he'd have been a man, he'd have
been glad to be quit of her, for she'd have been forced
to keep him lean and half-starved; but being a dog, and
not having a man's sense, he was sorry.”
“It was dull of the brute, certainly,” said Mr. Chester,
“and very like a brute.”
Hugh made no rejoinder, but whistling to his dog,
who sprung up at the sound and came jumping and
sporting about him, bade his sympathising friend good-
night.
* Good-night,” he returned. “Remember; you're safe
with me-quite safe. So long as you deserve it, my
good fellow, as I hope you always will, you have a friend
in me, on whose silence you may rely. Now do be care-
ful of yourself, pray do, and consider what jeopardy
you might have stood in. Good-night! bless you."
Hugh truckled before the hidden meaning of those
words as much as such a being could, and crept out of
the door so submissively and subserviently—with an
air, in short, so different from that with which he had
entered—that his patron on being left alone smiled more
than ever.
“And yet,” he said, as he took a pinch of snuff, “I do
not like their having hanged his mother. The fellow
has a fine eye, and I am sure she was handsome. But
very probably she was coarse—red nosed, perhaps, and
had clumsy feet. Aye, it was all for the best, no doubt.”

With this comforting reflection, he put on his coat,
took a farewell glance at the glass, and summoned his
man, who promptly attended, followed by a chair and
its two bearers.
“Foh!” said Mr. Chester. “The very atmosphere
that centaur has breathed, seems tainted with the cart
and ladder. Here, Peak. Bring some scent and sprinkle
the floor; and take away the chair he sat upon, and air
it; and dash a little of that mixture upon me. I am
stifled!”
The man obeyed; and the room and its master being
both purified, nothing remained for Mr. Chester but to
demand his hat, to fold it jauntily under his arm, to take
his seat in the chair and be carried off, humming a
fashionable tune.
CHAPTER XXIV.
How the accomplished gentleman spent the evening
in the midst of a dazzling and brilliant circle; how he
enchanted all those with whom he mingled by the grace
of his deportment, the politeness of his manner, the
vivacity of his conversation, and the sweetness of his
voice; how it was observed in every corner, that Chester
was a man of that happy disposition that nothing ruf-
fied him, that he was one on whom the world's cares
and errors sat lightly as his dress, and in whose smiling
face a calm and tranquil mind was constantly reflected;
how honest men, who by instinct knew him better, bowed
down before him nevertheless, deferred to his every
word, and courted his favourable notice; how people,
who really had good in them, went with the stream, and
fawned and flattered, and approved, and despised them-
selves while they did so, and yet had not the courage to
resist; how, in short, he was one of those who are re-
ceived and cherished in society (as the phrase is) by
scores who individually would shrink from and be re-
pelled by the object of their lavish regard; are things
of course which will suggest themselves. Matter so
commonplace needs but a passing glance, and there an
end.

and mimics of that creed-are of two sorts. They who

believe their merit neglected and unappreciated, make

Be sure that the coldest-hearted misanthropes are ever
of this last order.
Mr. Chester sat up in bed next morning, sipping his
coffee, and remembering with a kind of contemptuous
satisfaction how he had shone last night, and how he
had been caressed and courted, when his servant brought
in a very small scrap of dirty paper, tightly sealed in
two places, on the inside whereof was inscribed in pretty
large text these words: “A friend. Desiring of a con-
ference. Immediate. Private. Burn it when you've
read it.”
“Where, in the name of the Gunpowder Plot, did you
pick up this?” said his master.
It was given him by a person then waiting at the door,
the man replied.
" With a cloak and dagger?" said Mr. Chester.
With nothing more threatening about him, it ap-
peared, than a leather apron and a dirty face. “Let
ħim come in.” In he came—Mr. Tappertit; with his
hair still on end, and a great lock in his hand, which he
put down on the floor in the middle of the chamber as if
he were about to go through some performances in which
it was a necessary agent.
“Sir,” said Mr. Tappertit, with a low bow, “I thank
you for this condescension, and am glad to see you.
Pardon the menial office in which I am engaged, sir,
and extend your sympathies to one who, humble as
his appearance is, has inn’ard workings far above his
station."
Mr. Chester held the bed-curtain farther back and
looked at him with a vague impression that he was some
maniac, who had not only broken open the door of his
place of confinement, but had brought away the lock.
Mr. Tappertit bowed again, and displayed his legs to the
best advantage.
"You have heard, sir," said Mr. Tappertit, laying his
hand upon his breast, "of G. Varden, locksmith and
bell-hanger and repairs neatly executed in town and
country, Clerkenwell, London?"
" What then?” asked Mr. Chester,
“I am his 'prentice, sir.”

“ What then?"
“Ahem!” said Mr. Tappertit. “Would you permit
me to shut the door, sir, and will you further, sir, give
me your honour bright, that what passes between us is
in the strictest confidence?”
Mr. Chester laid himself calmly down in bed again,
and turning a perfectly undisturbed face towards the
strange apparition, which had by this time closed the
door, begged him to speak out, and to be as rational as
he could, without putting himself to any very great per-
sonal inconvenience.
“ In the first place, sir," said Mr. Tappertit, producing
a small pocket-handkerchief, and shaking it out of the
folds, “as I have not a card about me (for the envy of
masters debases us below that level) allow me to offer
the best substitute that circumstances will admit of. If
you will take that in your own hand, sir, and cast your
eye on the right-hand corner,” said Mr. Tappertit, offer-
ing it with a graceful air, “you will meet with my
credentials.”
“ Thank you," answered Mr. Chester, politely accept-
ing, and turning to some blood-red characters at one
end. “Four. Simon Tappertit. One.' Is that the—”
“Without the numbers, sir, that is my name,” replied
the 'prentice. “They are merely intended as directions
to the washerwoman, and have no connection with my-
self or family. Your name, sir,” said Mr. Tappertit,
looking very hard at his nightcap, “is Chester, I sup-
pose ? You needn't pull it off, sir, thank you. I ob-
serve E. C. from here. We will take the rest for
granted.”
“Pray, Mr. Tappertit,” said Mr. Chester, “has that
complicated piece of ironmongery which you have done
me the favour to bring with you any immediate con-
nexion with the business we are to discuss ?”
“It has not, sir,” rejoined the 'prentice. “It's going
to be fitted on a ware’us door in Thames Street.'
“Perhaps, as that is the case,” said Mr. Chester,
"and as it has a stronger flavour of oil than I usually
refresh my bedroom with, you will oblige me so far as
to put it outside the door.”
* By all means, sir,” said Mr. Tappertit, suiting the
action to the word.
“You'll excuse my mentioning it, I hope ?”

“Don't apologise, sir, I beg. And now, if you please,
to business.”
During the whole of this dialogue Mr. Chester had
suffered nothing but his smile of unvarying serenity and
politeness to appear upon his face. Sim Tappertit, who
had far too good an opinion of himself to suspect that
anybody could be playing upon him, thought within
himself that this was something like the respect to which
he was entitled, and drew a comparison from this cour-
teous demeanour of a stranger by no means favourable
to the worthy locksmith.
“From what passes in our house,” said Mr. Tappertit,
“I am aware, sir, that your son keeps company
with a young lady against your inclinations. Sir, your
son has not used me well.”
“Mr. Tappertit,” said the other, “you grieve me be-
yond description."
“Thank you, sir," replied the 'prentice. “I m glad to
hear you say so. He's very proud, sir, is your son; very
haughty.”
“I am afraid he is haughty,” said Mr. Chester. “ Do
you know I was really afraid of that before; and you
confirm me?"
“To recount the menial offices I've had to do for your
son, sir,” said Mr. Tappertit; “the chairs I've had to
hand him, the coaches I've had to call for him, the
numerous degrading duties, wholly unconnected with
my indenters, that I've had to do for him, would fill a
family Bible. Besides which, sir, he is but a young man
himself, and I do not consider 'thank’ee, Sim,' a proper
form of address on those occasions.”
“Mr. Tappertit, your wisdom is beyond your years.
Pray go on.”
"I thank you for your good opinion, sir,” said Sim,
much gratified, “and will endeavour so to do. Now, sir,
on this account (and perhaps for another reason or two
which I needn't go into) I am on your side. And what
I tell you is this—that as long as our people go back-
wards and forwards, to and fro, up and down, to that
there jolly old Maypole, lettering, messaging, and fetch-
ing and carrying, you couldn't help your son keeping
company with that young lady by deputy-not if he
was minded night and day by all the Horse Guards, and
every man of 'em in the very fullest uniform.”

Mr. Tappertit stopped to take breath after this, and
then started fresh again.
“Now, sir, I am coming to the point. You will in-
quire of me, ‘how is this to be prevented?' I'll tell you
how. If an honest, civil, smiling gentleman like
you,”
“Mr. Tappertit really—"
“No, no, I'm serious," rejoined the 'prentice, “I am,
upon my soul. If an honest, civil, smiling gentleman
like you, was to talk but ten minutes to our old woman
-that's Mrs. Varden-and flatter her up a bit, you'd
gain her over forever. Then there's this point got-
that her daughter Dolly”—here a flush came over Mr.
Tappertit's face—" wouldn't be allowed to be a go-
between from that time forward; and till that point's
got, there's nothing ever will prevent her. Mind that.
“Mr. Tappertit, your knowledge of human nature—”
“Wait a minute,” said Sim, folding his arms with a
dreadful calmness. “Now I come to the point. Sir,
there is a villain at that Maypole, a monster in human
shape, a vagabond of the deepest dye, that unless you
get rid of, and have kidnapped and carried off at the
very least-nothing less will do—will marry your son to
that young woman, as certainly and surely as if he was
the Archbishop of Canterbury himself. He will, sir, for
the hatred and malice he bears to you; let alone the
pleasure of doing a bad action, which to him is its own
reward. If you knew how this chap, this Joseph Willet
—that's his name—comes backwards and forwards to
our house, libelling, and denouncing, and threatening
you, and how I shudder when I hear him, you'd hate
him worse than I do-worse than I do, sir,” said Mr.
Tappertit, wildly, putting his hair up straighter, and
making a crunching noise with his teeth; “if sich a
thing is possible.”
“A little private vengeance in this, Mr. Tappertit?"
“Private vengeance, sir, or public sentiment, or both
combined-destroy him," said Mr. Tappertit. “Miggs
says so too. Miggs and me both say so. We can't bear
the plotting and undermining that takes place. Our
souls recoil from it. Barnaby Rudge and Mrs. Rudge
are in it likewise; but the villain, Joseph Willet, is the
ringleader. Their plottings and schemes are known to
me and Miggs. If you want information of 'em apply

to us. Put Joseph Willet down, sir. Destroy him.
Crush him. And be happy.”
With these words, Mr. Tappertit, who seemed to expect
no reply, and to hold it as a necessary consequence of
his eloquence that his hearer should be utterly stunned,
dumbfounded, and overwhelmed, folded his arms so
that the palm of each hand rested on the opposite
shoulder, and disappeared after the manner of those
mysterious warners of whom he had read in cheap
story-books.
"That fellow,” said Mr. Chester, relaxing his face
when he was fairly gone, “is good practice. I have
some command of my features, beyond all doubt. He
fully confirms what I suspected, though; and blunt tools
are sometimes found of use, where sharper instruments
would fail. I fear I may be obliged to make great havoc
among these worthy people. A troublesome necessity!
I quite feel for them.”.
With that he fell into a quiet slumber-subsided into
such a gentle, pleasant sleep, that it was quite infantine.
CHAPTER XXV.
LEAVING the favoured, and well-received, and flat-
tered of the world; him of the world most worldly, who
never compromised himself by an ungentlemanly action,
and never was guilty of a manly one; to lie smilingly
asleep-for even sleep, working but little change in his
dissembling face, became with him a piece of cold, con-
ventional hypocrisy-we follow in the steps of two slow
travellers on foot, making towards Chigwell.
Barnaby and his mother. Grip in their company
of course.
The widow, to whom each painful mile seemed longer
than the last, toiled wearily along; while Barnaby,
yieding to every inconstant impulse, fluttered here and
there, now leaving her far behind, now lingering far
behind himself, now darting into some by-lane or path
and leaving her to pursue her way alone, until he steal-
thily emerged again and came upon her with a wild shout
of merriment, as his wayward and capricious nature
prompted. Now he would call to her from the topmost

branch of some high tree by the roadside; now, using
his tall staff as a leaping-pole, come flying over ditch or
hedge or five-barred gate; now run with surprising swift-
ness for a mile or more on the straight road, and halt-
ing, sport upon a patch of grass with Grip till she came
up. These were his delights; and when his patient
mother heard his merry voice, or looked into his flushed
and healthy face, she would not have abated them by
one sad word or murmur, though each had been to her
a source of suffering in the same degree as it was to him
of pleasure.
It is something to look upon enjoyment, so that it be
free and wild and in the face of nature, though it is but
the enjoyment of an idiot. It is something to know that
Heaven has left the capacity of gladness in such a crea-
ture's breast; it is something to be assured that, how-
ever lightly men may crush that faculty in their fel-
lows, the Great Creator of mankind imparts it even to
his despised and slighted work. Who would not rather
see a poor idiot happy in the sunlight, than a wise man
pining in a darkened jail!
Ye men of gloom and austerity, who paint the face of
Infinite Benevolence with an eternal frown; read in the
Everlasting Book, wide open to your view, the lesson it
would teach. Its pictures are not in black and sombre
hues, but bright and glowing tints; its music-save when
ye drown it-is not in sighs and groans, but songs and
cheerful sounds. Listen to the million voices in the
summer air, and find one dismal as your own. Remem-
ber, if you can, the sense of hope and pleasure which
every glad return of day awakens in the breasts of all
your kind who have not changed their nature; and learn
some wisdom even from the witless, when their hearts
are lifted up, they know not why, by all the mirth and
happiness it brings.
The widow's breast was full of care, was laden heavily
with secret dread and sorrow; but her boy's gaiety of
heart gladdened her, and beguiled the long journey.
Sometimes he would bid her lean upon his arm, and
would keep beside her steadily for a short distance; but
it was more his nature to be rambling to and fro, and
she better liked to see him free and happy, even than
to have him near her, because she loved him better
than herself.

She had quitted the place to whicil they were travel-
ling, directly after the event which had changed her
whole existence; and for two-and-twenty years had never
had courage to revisit it. It was her native village.
How many recollections crowded on her mind when it
appeared in sight!
Two-and-twenty years. Her boy's whole life and
history. The last time she looked back upon those roofs
among the trees, she carried him in her arms, an infant.
How often since that time had she sat beside him night
and day, watching for the dawn of mind that never
came; how had she feared, and doubted, and yet hoped,
long after conviction forced itself upon her! The little
stratagems she had devised to try him, the little tokens
he had given in his childish way-not of dullness but of
something infinitely worse, so ghastly and unchild-like
in its cunning-came back as vividly as if but yesterday
had intervened. The room in which they used to be;
the spot in which the cradle stood; he old and elfin-like
in face, but ever dear to her, gazing at her with a wild
and vacant eye, and crooning some uncouth song as she
sat by and rocked him; every circumstance of his infancy
came thronging back, and the most trival, perhaps, the
most distinctly.
His older childhood, too; the strange imaginings he
had; his terror of certain senseless things-familiar ob-
jects he endowed with life; the slow and gradual break-
ing out of that one horror, in which, before his birth, his
darkened intellect began; how, in the midst of all, she
had found some hope and comfort in his being unlike
another child, and had gone on almost believing in the
slow development of his mind until he grew a man, and
then his childhood was complete and lasting; one after
another, all these old thoughts sprung up within her,
strong after their long slumber and bitterer than ever.
She took his arm and they hurried through the village
street. It was the same as it was wont to be in old
times, yet different too, and wore another air. The
change was in herself, not it; but she never thought of
that, and wondered at its alteration, and where it lay,
and what it was.
The people all knew Barnaby, and the children of the
place came flocking round him as she remembered to
have done with their fathers and mothers, round some

silly beggarman, when a child herself. None of them
knew her; they passed each well-remembered house, and
yard, and homestead; and striking into the fields, were
soon alone again.
The Warren was the end of their journey. Mr. Hare-
dale was walking in the garden, and seeing them as they
passed the iron-gate, unlocked it, and bade them enter
that way.
“At length you have mustered heart to visit the old
place,” he said to the widow. “I am glad you have.”
“For the first time, and the last, sir,” she replied.
“The first for many years, but not the last?"
“The very last.”
“You mean,” said Mr. Haredale, regarding her with
some surprise, “that having made this effort, you are
resolved not to persevere and are determined to relapse?
This is unworthy of you. I have often told you, you
should return here. You would be happier here than
elsewhere, I know. As to Barnaby, it's quite his home.”
“And Grip's,” said Barnaby, holding the basket open.
The raven hopped gravely out, and perching on his
shoulder and addressing himself to Mr. Haredale, cried
-as a hint, perhaps, that some temperate refreshment
would be acceptable—“Polly put the ket-tle on, we'll
all have tea!”
“Hear me, Mary,” said Mr. Haredale, kindly, as he
motioned her to walk with him towards the house.
“Your life has been an example of patience and forti-
tude, except in this one particular, which has often given
me great pain. It is enough to know that you were
cruelly involved in the calamity which deprived me of
an only brother, and Emma of her father, without being
obliged to suppose (as I sometimes am) that you associ-
ate us with the author of our joint misfortunes.”
“ Associate you with him, sir!" she cried.
“Indeed,” said Mr. Haredale, “I think you do. I
almost believe that because your husband was bound
by so many ties to our relation, and died in his service
and defence, you have come in some sort to connect us
with his murder."
“ Alas !” she answered. “You little know my heart,
sir. You little know the truth !"
“It is natural that you should do so; it is very prob-
able you may, without being conscious of it,” said Mr.

Haredale, speaking more to himself than to her. “We
are a fallen house. Money, dispensed with the most
lavish hand, would be a poor recompense for suffering
like yours; and thinly scattered by hands so pinched
and tied as ours, it becomes a miserable mockery. I
feel it so, God knows,” he added, hastily. “Why should
I wonder if she does !”
"You do me wrong, dear sir, indeed,” she rejoined,
with great earnestness; “and yet when you come to
hear what I desire your leave to say”
“I shall find my doubts confirmed ?” he said, observ.
ing that she faltered and became confused. “Well !"
He quickened his pace for a few steps, but fell back
again to her side, and said:
€“ And have you come all this way at last, solely to
speak to me ?"
She answered, “Yes.”
“A curse,” he muttered,“ upon the wretched state of
us proud beggars, from whom the poor and rich are
equally at a distance; the one being forced to treat us
with a show of cold respect; the other condescending to
us in their every deed and word, and keeping more aloof
the nearer they approach us. Why, if it were pain to
you(as it must have been to break for this slight pur-
pose the chain of habit forged through two-and-twenty
years, could you not let me know your wish, and beg
me to come to you?”
“There was not time, sir,” she rejoined. “I took my
resolution but last night, and taking it, felt that I must
not lose a day-a day! an hour-in having speech with
you.”
They had by this time reached the house. Mr. Hare-
dale paused for a moment, and looked at her as if sur-
prised by the energy of her manner. Observing, however,
that she took no heed of him, but glanced up, shudder-
ing, at the old walls with which such horrors were con-
nected in her mind, he led her by a private stair into his
library, where Emma was seated in a window, reading.
The young lady, seeing who approached, hastily rose
and laid aside her book, and with many kind words, and
not without tears, gave her a warm and earnest wel-
come. But the widow shrunk from her embrace as
though she feared her, and sunk down trembling on a
chair.

“It is the return to this place after so long an ab-
sence,” said Emma, gently. “Pray ring, dear uncle-
or stay – Barnaby will run himself and ask for
wine,"
“Not for the world,” she cried. “It would have
another taste-I could not touch it. I want but a min-
ute's rest. Nothing but that.”
Miss Haredale stood beside her chair, regarding her
with silent pity. She remained for a little time quite
still; then rose and turned to Mr. Haredale, who had sat
down in his easy chair, and was contemplating her with
fixed attention.
The tale connected with the mansion borne in mind,
it seemed, as has been already said, the chosen theatre
for such a deed as it had known. The room in which
this group were now assembled_hard by the very cham-
ber where the act was done-dull, dark, and sombre;
heavy with worm-eaten books; deadened and shut in by
faded hangings, muffling every sound; shadowed mourn-
fully by trees whose rustling boughs gave ever and anon
a spectral knocking at the glass; wore, beyond all others
in the house, a ghostly, gloomy air. Nor were the group
assembled there unfitting tenants of the spot. The
widow, with her marked and startling face and down-
cast eyes; Mr. Haredale stern and despondent ever; his
niece beside him, like, yet most unlike the picture of her
father, which gazed reproachfully down upon them from
the blackened wall; Barnaby, with his vacant look and
restless eye; were all in keeping with the place, and
actors in the legend. Nay, the very raven, who had
hopped upon the table, and with the air of some old
necromancer appeared to be profoundly studying a great
folio volume that lay open on a desk, was strictly in
unison with the rest, and looked like the embodied spirit
of evil biding his time of mischief.
“I scarcely know," said the widow, breaking silence,
“how to begin. You will think my mind disordered.”
“The whole tenor of your quiet and reproachless life
since you were last here," returned Mr. Haredale,
mildly, “shall bear witness for you. Why do you
fear to awaken such a suspicion? You do not
speak to strangers. You have not to claim our inter-
est or consideration for the first time. Be more
yourself. Take heart. Any advice or assistance that

201
I can give you, you know is yours of right, and freely
yours.”
“What if I came, sir,” she rejoined, “I who have but
one other friend on earth, to reject your aid from this
moment, and to say that henceforth I launch myself
upon the world, alone and unassisted, to sink or swim,
as Heaven may decree!"
“You would have, if you came to me for such a pur-
pose,” said Mr. Haredale, calmly, “some reason to as-
sign for conduct so extraordinary, which-if one may
entertain the possibility of anything so wild and strange
-would have its weight, of course.”
“ That, sir,” she answered, “is the misery of my dis-
tress. I can give no reason whatever. My own bare
word is all that I can offer. It is my duty, my imper-
ative and bounden duty. If I did not discharge it, I
should be a base and guilty wretch. Having said that,
my lips are sealed, and I can say no more.”
As though she felt relieved at having said so much,
and had nerved herself to the remainder of her task,
she spoke from this time with a firmer voice and
heightened courage.
“Heaven is my witness, as my own heart is—and
yours, dear young lady, will speak for me, I know-that
I have lived, since that time we all have bitter reason
to remember, in unchanging devotion and gratitude to
this family. Heaven is my witness that go where I
may, I shall preserve those feelings unimpaired. And
it is my witness, too, that they alone impel me to the
course I must take, and from which nothing now shall
turn me, as I hope for mercy.”
“ These are strange riddles," said Mr. Haredale.
“In this world, sir,” she replied, “they may, perhaps,
never be explained. In another, the truth will be dis-
covered in its own good time. And may that time,”
she added, in a low voice, “be far distant!"
“Let me be sure,” said Mr. Haredale, “ that I under-
stand you, for I am doubtful of my own senses. Do
you mean that you are resolved voluntarily to deprive
yourself of those means of support you have received
from us so long—that you are determined to resign the
annuity we settled on you twenty years ago-to leave
house, and home, and goods, and begin life anew-and
this, for some secret reason or monstrous fancy which

is incapable of explanation, which only now exists, and
has been dormant all this time? In the name of God,
under what delusion are you labouring?”
“ As I am deeply thankful,” she made answer, “ for
the kindness of those, alive and dead, who have owned
this house; and as I would not have its roof fall down
and crush me or its very walls drip blood, my name
being spoken in their hearing; I never will again sub-
sist on their bounty, or let it help me to subsistence.
You do not know,” she added, suddenly, “to what uses
it may be applied; into what hands it may pass. I do,
and I renounce it."
“ Surely,” said Mr. Haredale, “its uses rest with you."
“ They did. They rest with me no longer. It may be
-it is—devoted to purposes that mock the dead in their
graves. It can never prosper with me. It will bring
some other heavy judgment on the head of my dear son,
whose innocence will suffer for his mother's guilt.”
“What words are these?” cried Mr. Haredale, regard-
ing her with wonder. “Among what associates have
you fallen? Into what guilt have you ever been be-
trayed?"
"I am guilty, and yet innocent; wrong, yet right; good
in intention, though constrained to shield and aid the
bad. Ask me no more questions, sir; but believe that I
am rather to be pitied than condemned. I must leave
my house to-morrow, for while I stay there, it is
haunted. My future dwelling, if I am to live in peace,
must be a secret. If my poor boy should ever stray
this way, do not tempt him to disclose it or have him
watched when he returns; for if we are hunted, we
must fly again. And now this load is off my mind, I
beseech you—and you, dear Miss Haredale, too-to trust
me if you can, and think of me kindly as you have been
used to do. If I die and cannot tell my secret even
then (for that may come to pass), it will sit the lighter
on my breast in that hour for this day's work; and on
that day, and every day until it comes, I will pray for
and thank you both, and trouble you no more.”
With that she would have left them but they detained
her, and with many soothing words and kind entreaties
besought her to consider what she did, and above all to
repose more freely upon them, and say what weighed so
sorely on her mind. Finding her deaf to their persua-

sions, Mr. Haredale suggested, as a last resource, that she
should confide in Emma, of whom, as a young person
and one of her own sex, she might stand in less dread
than of herself. From this proposal, however, she re-
coiled with the same indescribable repugnance she had
manifested when they met. The utmost that could be
wrung from her was a promise that she would receive
Mr. Haredale at her own house next evening, and in the
meantime reconsider her determination and their dis-
suasions—though any change on her part, as she told
them, was quite hopeless. This condition made at last,
they reluctantly suffered her to depart, since she would
neither eat nor drink within the house; and she, and
Barnaby, and Grip, accordingly went out as they had
come, by the private stair and garden gate; seeing and
being seen of no one by the way.
It was remarkable in the raven that during the whole
interview he had kept his eye on his book with exactly
the air of a very sly human rascal, who, under the mask
of pretending to read hard, was listening to everything.
He still appeared to have the conversation very strongly
in his mind, for although, when they were alone again,
he issued orders for the instant preparation of innumer-
able kettles for purposes of tea, he was thoughtful, and
rather seemed to do so from an abstract sense of duty,
than with any regard to making himself agreeable, or
being what is commonly called good company.
They were to return by the coach. As there was an
interval of full two hours before it started, and they
needed rest and some refreshment, Barnaby begged hard
for a visit to the Maypole. But his mother, who had no
wish to be recognised by any of those who had known
her so long, and who feared besides that Mr. Haredale
might, on second thoughts, despatch some messenger to
that place of entertainment in quest of her, proposed to
wait in the churchyard instead. As it was easy for
Barnaby to buy and carry thither such humble viands
as they required, he cheerfully assented, and in the
churchyard they sat down to take their frugal dinner,
Here again, the raven was in a highly reflective state;
walking up and down when he had dined, with an air
of elderly complacency which was strongly suggestive
of his having his hands under his coat-tails; and appear-
ing to read the tombstones with a very critical taste.

Sometimes, after a long inspection of an epitaph, he
would strop his beak upon the grave to which it referred,
and cry in hoarse tones, “ I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a
devil!” but whether he addressed his observations to any
supposed person below, or merely threw them off as a
general remark, is a matter of uncertainty.
It was a quiet, pretty spot, but a sad one for Barnaby's
mother; for Mr. Reuben Haredale lay there, and near the
vault in which his ashes rested, was a stone to the mem-
ory of her own husband, with a brief inscription record-
ing how and when he had lost his life. She sat here,
thoughtful and apart, until their time was out, and the
distant horn told that the coach was coming.
Barnaby, who had been sleeping on the grass, sprung
up quickly at the sound; and Grip, who appeared to
understand it equally well, walked into his basket
straightway, entreating society in general (as though he
intended a kind of satire upon them in connexion with
churchyards) never to say die on any terms. They were
soon on the coach-top and rolling along the road.
It went round by the Maypole, and stopped at the
door. Joe was from home, and Hugh came sluggishly
out to hand up the parcel that it called for. There was
no fear of old John coming out. They could see him
from the coach roof fast asleep in his cosey bar. It was
a part of John's character. He made a point of going
to sleep at the coach's time. He despised gadding about;
he looked upon coaches as things that ought to be in-
dicted; as disturbers of the peace of mankind; as rest-
less, bustling, busy, horn-blowing contrivances, quite
beneath the dignity of men, and only suited to giddy
girls that did nothing but chatter and go a-shopping.
“We know nothing about coaches here, sir,” John would
say, if any unlucky stranger made inquiry touching the
offensive vehicles; “ we don't book for 'em; we'd rather
not; they're more trouble than they're worth, with their
noise and rattle. If you like to wait for 'em you can;
but we don't know anything about 'em; they may call
and they may not—there's a carrier—he was looked upon
as quite good enough for us, when I was a boy.”
She dropped her veil as Hugh climbed up, and while
he hung behind and talked to Barnaby in whispers. But
neither he nor any other person spoke to her, or noticed
her, or had any curiosity about her; and so, an alien,

she visited and left the village where she had been born,
and had lived a merry child, a comely girl, a happy
wife—where she had known all her enjoyment of life,
and had entered on its hardest sorrows.
CHAPTER XXVI.
" AND you're not surprised to hear this, Varden,” said
Mr. Haredale. “Well! You and she have always been
the best friends, and you should understand her if any.
body does.”
“I ask your pardon, sir,” rejoined the locksmith. “I
didn't say I understood her. I wouldn't have the pre-
sumption to say that of any woman. It's not so easily
done. But I am not so much surprised, sir, as you ex-
pected me to be, certainly.”
“May I ask why not, my good friend?”
“I have seen, sir,” returned the locksmith with evident
reluctance, “I have seen in connexion with her, some-
thing that has filled me with distrust and uneasiness.
She has made bad friends, how, or when, I don't know;
but that her house is a refuge for one robber and
cut-throat at least, I am certain. There, sir! Now it's
out.”
“Varden!"
“My own eyes, sir, are my witnesses, and for her sake
I would be willingly half-blind, if I could but have the
pleasure of mistrusting 'em. I have kept the secret till
now, and it will go no further than yourself, I know;
but I tell you that with my own eyes—broad awake-I
saw, in the passage of her house one evening after dark,
the highwayman who robbed and wounded Mr. Edward
Chester, and on the same night threatened me.”
“And you made no effort to detain him?” said Mr.
Haredale, quickly.
“Sir," returned the locksmith, “she herself prevented
me-held me, with all her strength, and hung about me
until he had got clear off.” And having gone so far, he
related circumstantially all that had passed upon the
night in question.
This dialogue was held in a low tone in the lock-
smith's little parlour, into which honest Gabriel had

shown his visitor on his arrival. Mr. Haredale had
called upon him to entreat his company to the widow's,
that he might have the assistance of his persuasion and
influence; and out of this circumstance the conversation
had arisen.
“I forbore,” said Gabriel, “from repeating one word
of this to anybody, as it could do her no good and might
do her great harm. I thought and hoped, to say the
truth, that she would come to me, and talk to me about
it, and tell me how it was; but though I have purposely
put myself in her way more than once or twice, she has
never touched upon the subject-except by a look. And
indeed,” said the good-natured locksmith, “there was
a good deal in the look, more than could have been put
into a great many words. It said, among other matters,
'Don't ask me anything,' so imploringly that I didn't ask
her anything. You'll think me an old fool, I know, sir.
If it's any relief to call me one, pray do."
“I am greatly disturbed by what you tell me,” said
Mr. Haredale, after a silence. “What meaning do you
attach to it?"
The locksmith shook his head, and looked doubtfully
out of window at the failing light.
“She cannot have married again,” said Mr. Haredale.
“Not without our knowledge, surely, sir.”
“She may have done so in the fear that it would lead,
if known, to some objection or estrangement. Suppose
she married incautiously—it is not improbable, for her
existence has been a lonely and monotonous one for
years—and the man turned out a ruffian, she would be
anxious to screen him, and yet would revolt from his
crimes. This might be. It bears strongly on the whole
drift of her discourse yesterday, and would quite explain
her conduct. Do you suppose Barnaby is privy to these
circumstances ?”
“Quite impossible to say, sir,” returned the locksmith,
shaking his head again, “and next to impossible to find
out from him. If what you suppose is really the case, I
tremble for the lad-a notable person, sir, to put to bad
uses”
“It is not possible, Varden,” said Mr. Haredale, in a
still lower tone of voice than he had spoken yet, “ that
we have been blinded and deceived by this woman from
the beginning? It is not possible that this connexion

"don'tnd-twentrandsome, It makes with a t' she is:
was formed in her husband's lifetime, and led to his and
my brother's—”
“Good God, sir,” cried Gabriel, interrupting him,
"don't entertain such dark thoughts for a moment.
Five-and-twenty years ago, where was there a girl like
her ? A gay, handsome, laughing, bright-eyed damsel !
Think what she was, sir. It makes my heart ache now,
even now, though I'm an old man, with a woman for a
daughter, to think what she was and what she is. We
all change, but that's with Time; Time does his work
honestly, and I don't mind him. A fig for Time, sir.
Use him well, and he's a hearty fellow, and scorns to
have you at a disadvantage. But care and suffering
(and those have changed her) are devils, sir-secret,
stealthy, undermining devils—who tread down the
brightest flowers in Eden, and do more havoc in a month
than Time does in a year. Picture to yourself for one
minute what Mary was before they went to work with
her fresh heart and face—do her that justice—and say
whether such a thing is possible.”
“You're a good fellow, Varden,” said Mr. Haredale,
“and are quite right. I have brooded on that subject
so long, that every breath of suspicion carries me back
to it. You are quite right.”
“It isn't, sir, cried the locksmith, with brightened
eyes, and sturdy, honest voice; “it isn't because I courted
her before Rudge, and failed, that I say she was too
good for him. She would have been as much too good
for me. But she was too good for him; he wasn't free
· and frank enough for her. I don't reproach his memory
with it, poor fellow; I only want to put her before you
as she really was. For myself, I'll keep her old picture
in my mind; and thinking of that, and what has altered
her, I'll stand her friend, and try to win her back to
peace. And damme, sir,” cried Gabriel, “with your
pardon for the word, I'd do the same if she had married
fifty highwaymen in a twelvemonth; and think it in the
Protestant Manual too, though Martha said it wasn't,
tooth and nail, till doomsday!"
If the dark little parlour had been filled with a dense
fog, which, clearing away in an instant, left it all radi-
ance and brightness, it could not have been more sud-
denly cheered than by this outbreak on the part of the
hearty locksmith. In a voice nearly as full and round

as his own, Mr. Hardale cried, “ Well said!” and bade
him come away without more parley. The locksmith
complied right willingly; and both getting into a hack-
ney-coach which was waiting at the door, drove off
straightway.
They alighted at the street-corner, and dismissing
their conveyance, walked to the house. To their first
knock at the door there was no response. A second met
with the like result. But in answer to the third, which
was of a more vigorous kind, the parlour window-sash
was gently raised, and a musical voice cried:
“Haredale, my dear fellow, I am extremely glad to
see you. How very much you have improved in your
appearance since our last meeting! I never saw you
looking better. How do you do?”
Mr. Haredale turned his eyes towards the casement
whence the voice proceeded, though there was no need
to do so, to recognise the speaker, and Mr. Chester
waved his hand, and smiled a courteous welcome.
“The door will be opened immediately,” he said.
“There is nobody but a very dilapidated female to per-
form such offices. You will excuse her infirmities? If
she were in a more elevated station of society, she would
be gouty. Being but a hewer of wood and drawer of
water, she is rheumatic. My dear Haredale, these are
natural class distictions, depend upon it.”.
Mr. Haredale, whose face resumed its lowering
and distrustful look the moment he heard the voice,
inclined his head stiffly, and turned his back upon the
speaker.
“Not opened yet!" said Mr. Chester. “Dear me! I
hope the aged soul has not caught her foot in some un-
lucky cobweb by the way. She is there at last! Come
in, I beg!”
Mr. Karedale entered, followed by the locksmith.
Turning with a look of great astonishment to the old
woman who had opened the door, he inquired for Mrs.
Rudge—for Barnaby. They were both gone, she replied,
wagging her ancient head, for good. There was a gen-
tleman in the parlour, who perhaps could tell them more.
That was all she knew.
“Pray, sir,” said Mr. Haredale, presenting himself
before this new tenant, “where is the person whom I
came here to see?”

“My dear friend,” he returned “I have not the least
idea."
“Your trifling is ill-timed,” retorted the other, in a
suppressed tone and voice, “and its subject ill-chosen.
Reserve it for those who are your friends, and do not
expend it on me. I lay no claim to the distinction, and
have the self-denial to reject it.”
“My dear, good sir,” said Mr. Chester, “ you are
heated with walking. Sit down, I beg. Our friend is—"
“Is but a plain, honest man,” returned Mr. Haredale,
“and quite unworthy of your notice.”
“Gabriel Varden by name, sir,” said the locksmith,
bluntly.
“A worthy English yeoman!” said Mr. Chester. “A
most worthy yeoman, of whom I have frequently heard
my son Ned-darling fellow-speak, and have often
wished to see. Varden, my good friend, I am glad to
know you. You wonder now,” he said, turning languidly
to Mr. Haredale, “to see me here. Now, I am sure you
do.”
Mr. Haredale glanced at him-not fondly or admir-
ingly-smiled, and held his peace.
“The mystery is solved in a moment,” said Mr. Ches-
ter; “in a moment. Will you step aside with me one
instant. You remember our little compact in reference
to Ned, and your dear niece, Haredale? You remember
the list of assistants in their innocent intrigue? You re-
member these two people being among them? My dear
fellow, congratulate yourself, and me. I have bought
them off.”
“You have done what?” said Haredale.
“Bought them off,” returned his smiling friend. “I
have found it necessary to take some active steps towards
setting this boy and girl attachment quite at rest, and
have begun by removing these two agents. You are
surprised? Who can withstand the influence of a little
money! They wanted it, and have been bought off.
We have nothing more to fear from them. They are
gone."
“Gone!" echoed Mr. Haredale. “Where?”
“My dear fellow-and you must permit me to say
again, that you never looked so young; so positively
boyish as you do to-night-the Lord knows where; I be-
lieve Columbus himself wouldn't find them. Between

you and me they have their hidden reasons, but upon
that point I have pledged myself to secrecy. She ap-
pointed to see you here to-night, I know, but found it
inconvenient, and couldn't wait. Here is the key of the
door. I am afraid you'll find it inconveniently large;
but as the tenement is yours, your good nature will ex-
cuse that, Haredale, I am certain!"
CHAPTER XXVII.
MR. HAREDALE stood in the widow's parlour with the
door-key in his hand, gazing by turns at Mr. Chester
and at Gabriel Varden, and occasionally glancing down-
ward at the key as in the hope that of its own accord it
would unlock the mystery; until Mr. Chester, putting
on his hat and gloves, and sweetly inquiring whether
they were walking in the same direction, recalled him
to himself.
“No,” he said. “Our roads diverge-widely, as you
know. For the present, I shall remain here.”
“You will be hipped, Haredale; you will be miserable,
melancholy, utterly wretched,” returned the other. “It's
a place of the very last description for a man of your
temper. I know it will make you very miserable."
“Let it,” said Mr. Haredale, sitting down; "and thrive
upon the thought. Good-night.”
Feigning to be wholly unconscious of the abrupt wave
of the hand which rendered this farewell tantamount to
a dismissal, Mr. Chester retorted with a bland and heart-
felt benediction, and inquired of Gabriel in what direc-
tion he was going.
“Yours, sir, would be too much honour for the like of
me," replied the locksmith, hesitating.
“I wish you to remain here a little while, Varden,”
said Mr. Haredale, without looking towards them. “I
have a word or two to say to you.”
"I will not intrude upon your conference another
moment,” said Mr. Chester with inconceivable politeness.
“ May it be satisfactory to you both! God bless you!"
So saying, and bestowing upon the locksmith a most
refulgent smile, he left them.
“A deplorably constituted creature, that rugged per-

son,” he said, as he walked along the street; “he is an
atrocity that carries its own punishment along with it-
a bear that knaws himself. And here is one of the ines-
timable advantages of having a perfect command over
one's inclinations. I have been tempted, in these two
short interviews, to draw upon that fellow fifty times.
Five men in six would have yielded to the impulse. By
suppressing mine I wound him deeper and more keenly
than if I were the best swordsman in all Europe, and he
the worst. You are the wise man's very last resource,” he
said, tapping the hilt of his weapon; “ we can but appeal
to you when all else is said and done. To come to you
before, and thereby spare our adversaries so much, is a
barbarian mode of warfare, quite unworthy any man
with the remotest pretensions to delicacy of feeling, or
refinement."
He smiled so very pleasantly as he communed with
himself after this manner, that a begger was embold-
ened to follow him for alms, and to dog his footsteps for
some distance. He was gratified by the circumstance,
feeling.it complimentary to his power of feature, and as
a reward suffered the man to follow him until he called
a chair, when he graciously dismissed him with a fer-
vent blessing.
“Which is as easy as cursing,” he wisely added, as
he took his seat, “ and more becoming to the face. To
Clerkenwell, my good creatures, if you please!” The
chairmen were rendered quite vivacious by having such
a courteous burden, and to Clerkenwell they went at a
fair round trot.
Alighting at a certain point he had indicated to them
upon the road, and paying them something less than
they had expected from a fare of such gentle speech, he
turned into the street in which the locksmith dwelt, and
presently stood beneath the shadow of the Golden Key.
Mr. Tappertit, who was hard at work by lamp-light,
in a corner of the workshop, remained unconscious of
his presence until a hand upon his shoulder made him
start and turn his head.
“ Industry,” said Mr. Chester, “is the soul of business,
and the key-stone of prosperity. Mr. Tappertit, I shall
expect you to invite me to dinner when you are Lord
Mayor of London.”
“Sir," returned the 'prentice, laying down his ham-

mer, and rubbing his nose on the back of a very sooty
hand, “I scorn the Lord Mayor and everything that be-
longs to him. We must have another state of society,
sir, before you catch me being Lord Mayor. How de
do, sir?"
• The better, Mr. Tappertit, for looking into your in-
genious face once more. I hope you are well.”
“I am as well, sir,” said Sim, standing up to get
nearer to his ear, and whispering hoarsely, “ as any
man can be under the aggrawations to which I am ex-
posed. My life's a burden to me. If it wasn't for
wengeance, I'd play at pitch and toss with it on the
losing hazard.”
“Is Mrs. Varden at home?” said Mr. Chester.
“Sir,” returned Sim, eyeing him over with a look of
concentrated expression, “she is. Did you wish to see
her?”
Mr. Chester nodded.
“ Then come this way, sir,” said Sim, wiping his face
upon his apron. “Follow me, sir. Would you permit
me to whisper in your ear, one half a second?”
“By all means.
Mr. Tappertit raised himself on tiptoe, applied his lips
to Mr. Chester's ear, drew back his head without saying
anything, looked hard at him, applied them to his ear
again, again drew back, and finally whispered, “The
name is Joseph Willet. Hush! I say no more.”
Having said that much, he beckoned the visitor, with
a mysterious aspect, to follow him, to the parlour door,
where he announced him in the voice of a gentleman-
usher. “Mr. Chester.”
“And not Mr. Ed’dard, mind,” said Sim, looking into
the door again, and adding this by way of postscript in
his own person; “it's his father.”
“But do not let his father,” said Mr. Chester, advanc-:.
ing hat in hand, as he observed the effect of this last
explanatory announcement, “ do not let his father be
any check or restraint on your domestic occupations,
Miss Varden.”
“Oh! Now! There! An't I always a saying it!"
exclaimed Miggs, clapping her hands. “If he an't been
and took Missis for her own daughter. Well, she do
look like it, that she do. Only think of that, mim!”
“Is it possible," said Mr. Chester, in his softest tones,

213
" that this is Mrs. Varden! I am amazed. That is not
your daughter, Mrs. Varden! No, no. Your sister.”
“My daughter, indeed, sir," returned Mrs. V.. blush-
ing with great juvenility.
* Ah, Mrs. Varden!” cried the visitor. "Ah, ma’am
-humanity is indeeed a happy lot, when we can repeat
ourselves in others, and still be young as they. You
must allow me to salute you—the custom of the country,
my dear madam-your daughter too."
Dolly showed some reluctance to perform this cere-
mony, but was sharply reproved by Mrs. Varden, who
insisted on her undergoing it that minute. For pride,
she said with great severity, was one of the seven
deadly sins, and humility and lowliness of heart were
virtues. Wherefore she desired that Dolly would be
kissed immediately, on pain of her just displeasure; at
the same time giving her to understand that whatever
she saw her mother do, she might safely do herself,
without being at the trouble of any reasoning or reflec-
tion on the subject—which, indeed, was offensive and
undutiful, and in direct contravention of the church
catechism.
Thus admonished, Dolly complied, though by no
means willingly; for there was a broad, bold look of ad-
miration in Mr. Chester's face, refined and polished
though it sought to be, which distressed her very much.
As she stood with downcast eyes, not liking to look up.
and meet his, he gazed upon her with an approving air,
and then turned to her mother.
“My friend Gabriel (whose acquaintance I only made
this very evening) should be a happy man, Mrs. Varden.”
“Ah!” sighed Mrs. V., shaking her head.
“Ah!” echoed Miggs.
“Is that the case?” said Mr. Chester, compassionately.
“Dear me!"
“Master has no intentions, sir,” murmured Miggs, as
she sidled up to him, “but to be as grateful as his natur
will let him, for everythink he owns which it is in
his powers to appreciate. But we never, sir”-said
Miggs, looking sideways at Mrs. Varden, and interlard-
ing her discourse with a sigh—“we never know the full
value of some wines and fig-trees till we lose 'em. So
much the worse, sir, for them as has the slighting of 'em
on their consciences when they're gone to be in full blow

elsewhere." And Miss Miggs cast up her eyes to signify
where that might be.
As Mrs. Varden distinctly heard, and was intended to
hear, all that Miggs said, and as these words appeared
to convey in metaphorical terms a presage or foreboding
that she would at some early period droop beneath her
trials and take an easy flight towards the stars, she im-
mediately began to languish, and taking a volume of
the Manual from a neighbouring table, leant her arm
upon it as though she were Hope and that her Anchor.
Mr. Chester perceiving this, and seeing how the volume
was lettered on the back, took it gently from her hand,
and turned the fluttering leaves.
“My favourite book, dear madam. How often, how
very often in his early life-before he can remember"
-(this clause was strictly true) “have I deduced little
easy moral lessons from its pages for my dear son
Ned! You know Ned?"
Mrs. Varden had that honour, and a fine affable young
gentleman he was.
“You're a mother, Mrs. Varden," said Mr. Chester,
taking a pinch of snuff, “and you know what I, as a
father, feel, when he is praised. He gives me some un-
easiness—much uneasiness-he's of a roving nature,
ma’am-from flower to flower—from sweet to sweet-
but his is the butterfly time of life, and we must not
be hard upon such trifling.”
He glanced at Dolly. She was attending evidently
to what he said. Just what he desired!
6 The only thing I object to in this little trait of Ned's,
is,” said Mr. Chester, "--and the mention of his name re-
minds me, by the way, that I am about to beg the favour
of a minute's talk with you alone—the only thing I ob-
ject to in it, is, that it does partake of insincerity. Now,
however I may attempt to disguise the fact from myself
in my affection for Ned, still I always revert to this-
that if we are not sincere, we are nothing. Nothing
upon earth. Let us be sincere, my dear madam,”
“—and Protestant,” murmured Mrs. Varden.
“—and Protestant above all things. Let us be sincere
and Protestant, strictly moral, strictly just (though al-
ways with a leaning towards mercy), strictly honest,
and strictly true, and we gain-it is a slight point, cer-
tainly, but still it is something tangible; we throw up a

215
groundwork and foundation, so to speak, of goodness,
on which we may afterwards erect some worthy super-
structure.”
Now, to be sure, Mrs. Varden thought, here is a per-
fect character. Here is a meek, righteous, thorough-
going Christian, who, having mastered all these quali-
ties, so difficult of attainment; who, having dropped a
pinch of salt on the tails of all the cardinal virtues,
and caught them every one; makes light of their pos-
session, and pants for more morality. For the good
woman never doubted (as many good men and women
never do), that this slighting kind of profession—this
setting so little store by great matters, this seeming to
say, “I am not proud, I am what you hear, but I con-
sider myself no better than other people; let us change
the subject, pray”—was perfectly genuine and true.
He so contrived it, and said it in that way that it ap-
peared to have been forced from him, and its effect was
marvellous.
Aware of the impression he had made-few men were
quicker than he at such discoveries—Mr. Chester fol-
lowed up the blow by propounding certain virtuous
maxims, somewhat vague and general in their nature,
doubtless, and occasionally partaking of the character
of truisms, worn a little out at elbow, but delivered in
so charming a voice and with such uncommon serenity
and peace of mind, that they answered as well as the
best. Nor is this to be wondered at; for as hollow ves-
sels produce a far more musical sound in falling than
those which are substantial, so it will oftentimes be
found that sentiments which have nothing in them make
the loudest ringing in the world, and are the most
relished.
Mr. Chester, with the volume gently extended in one
hand, and with the other planted lightly on his breast,
talked to them in the most delicious manner possible;
and quite enchanted all his hearers, notwithstanding
their conflicting interests and thoughts. Even Dolly,
who, between his keen regards and her eyeing over by
Mr. Tappertit, was put quite out of countenance, could
not help owning within herself that he was the sweet-
est-spoken gentleman she had ever seen. Even Miss
Miggs, who was divided between admiration of Mr.
Chester and a moral jealousy of her young mistress, had

sufficient leisure to be propitiated. Even Mr. Tapper-
tit, though occupied as we have seen in gazing at his
heart's delight, could not wholly divert his thoughts
from the voice of the other charmer. Mrs. Varden, to
her own private thinking, had never been so improved
in all her life; and when Mr. Chester, rising and cray-
ing permission to speak to her apart, took her by the
hand and led her at arm's length up-stairs to the best
sitting-room, she almost deemed him something more
than human.
“Dear madam,” he said, pressing her hand delicately
to his lips; “be seated.”
Mrs. Varden called up quite a courtly air, and became
seated.
“You guess my object?" said Mr. Chester, drawing a
chair towards her. “You divine my purpose? Iam an
affectionate parent, my dear Mrs. Varden.”
“ That I am sure you are, sir,” said Mrs. V.
“ Thank you,"returned Mr. Chester, tapping his snuff-
box lid. "Heavy moral responsibilities rest with
parents, Mrs. Varden.”
Mrs. Varden slightly raised her hands, shook her head,
and looked at the ground as though she saw straight
through the globe, out at the other end, and into the
immensity of space beyond.
“I may confide in you," said Mr. Chester, “without
reserve. I love my son, ma'am, dearly; and loving him
as I do, I would save him from working certain misery.
You know of his attachment to Miss Haredale. You
have abetted him in it, and very kind of you it was
to do so. I am deeply obliged to you—most deeply
obliged to you—for your interest in his behalf; but, my
dear ma'am, it is a mistaken one, I do assure you."
Mrs. Varden stammered that she was sorry-
“Sorry, my dear ma'am,” he interposed. “Never be
sorry for what is so very amiable, so very good in inten-
tion, so perfectly like yourself. But there are grave and
weighty reasons, pressing family considerations, and
apart even from these, points of religious difference,
which interpose themselves, and render their union im-
possible; utterly impossible. I should have mentioned
these circumstances to your husband: but he has-you
will excuse my saying this so freely-he has not your
quickness of apprehension or depth of moral sense.

What an extremely airy house this is, and how beauti-
fully kept! For one like myself—a widower so long-
these tokens of female care and superintendence have
inexpressible charms.”
Mrs. Varden began to think (she scarcely knew why)
that the young Mr. Chester must be in the wrong, and
the old Mr. Chester must be in the right.
“My son Ned,” resumed her tempter, with his most
winning air, “has had, I am told, your lovely daughter's
aid, and your open-hearted husband's.”
"-Much more than mine, sir,” said Mrs. Varden; "a
great deal more. I have often had my doubts. It's a—”
“A bad example,” suggested Mr. Chester. “It is. No
doubt it is. Your daughter is at that age when to set
before her an encouragement for young persons to rebel
against their parents on this most important point is
particularly injudicious. You are quite right. I ought
to have thought of that myself, but it escaped me, I con-
fess—so far superior are your sex to ours, dear madam,
in point of penetration and sagacity.”
Mrs. Varden looked as wise as if she had really said
something to deserve this compliment-firmly believed
she had, in short-and her faith in her own shrewdness
increased considerably.
“My dear ma'am," said Mr. Chester, “ you embolden
me to be plain with you. My son and I are at variance
on this point. The young lady and her natural guardian
differ upon it also. And the closing point is that my
son is bound, by his duty to me, by his honour, by every
solemn tie and obligation, to marry some one else.”
“Engaged to marry another lady!” quoth Mrs. Varden,
holding up her hands.
“My dear madam, brought up, educated, and trained,
expressly for that purpose. Expressly for that purpose.
Miss Haredale, I am told, is a very charming creature.”
“Iam her foster-mother and should know—the best
young lady in the world," said Mrs. Varden.
“I have not the smallest doubt of it. I am sure she is.
And you who have stood in that tender relation towards
her are bound to consult her happiness. Now, can I-
as I have said to Haredale, who quite agrees--can I pos-
sibly stand by and suffer her to throw herself away (al-
though she is of a Catholic family), upon a young fellow
who, as yet, has no heart at all? It is no imputation upon

him to say he has not, because young men who have
plunged deeply into the frivolities and conventionalities
of society very seldom have. Their hearts never grow,
my dear ma'am, till after thirty. I don't believe, no, I
do not believe, that I had any heart myself when I was
Ned's age.”
“Oh, sir,” said Mrs. Varden, “I think you must have
had. It's impossible that you, who have so much now,
can ever have been without any."
“I hope,” he answered, shrugging his shoulders
meekly, “I have a little; I hope, a very little—Heaven
knows! But to return to Ned; I have no doubt you
thought, and therefore interfered benevolently in his
behalf, that I objected to Miss Haredale. How very
natural! My dear madam, I object to him—to him-
emphaticically to Ned himself."
Mrs. Varden was perfectly aghast at the disclosure.
“He has, if he honourably fulfils this solemn obliga-
tion of which I have told you—and he must be honoura-
ble, dear Mrs. Varden, or he is no son of mine-a fortune
within his reach. He is of most expensive, ruinously
expensive habits; and if, in a moment of caprice and
wilfulness, he were to marry this young lady, and so
deprive himself of the means of gratifying the tastes to
which he has been so long accustomed, he would-my
dear madam, he would break the gentle creature's heart.
Mrs. Varden, my good lady, my dear soul, I put it to
you—is such a sacrifice to be endured? Is the female
heart a thing to be trified with in this way? Ask your
own, my dear madam. Ask your own, I beseech you."
"Truly,” thought Mrs. Varden, “this gentleman is a
saint. But,” she added aloud, and not unnaturally,
“if you take Miss Emma's lover away, sir, what be-
comes of the poor thing's heart then?"
• The very point,” said Mr. Chester, not at all abashed,
“to which I wished to lead you. A marriage with my
son, whom I should be compelled to disown, would be
followed by years of misery; they would be separated,
my dear madam, in a twelvemonth. To break off this
attachment, which is more fancied than real, as you and
I know very well, will cost the dear girl but a few tears,
and she is happy again. Take the case of your own
daughter, the young lady down-stairs, who is your
breathing image”—Mrs. Varden coughed and simpered

_"there is a young man (I am sorry to say, a dissolute
fellow, of very indifferent character), of whom I have
heard Ned speak-Bullet was it-Pullet-Mullet—”
“There is a young man of the name of Joseph Willet,
sir,” said Mrs. Varden, folding her hands loftily.
“That's he,” cried Mr. Chester. “Suppose this Joseph
Willet, now, were to aspire to the affections of your
charming daughter, and were to engage them.”
“It would be like his impudence,” interposed Mrs.
Varden, bridling, “ to dare to think of such a thing!"
“My dear madam, that's the whole case. I know it
would be like his impudence. It is like Ned's impudence
to do as he has done; but you would not on that account,
or because of a few tears from your beautiful daughter,
refrain from checking their inclinations in their birth.
I meant to have reasoned thus with your husband when
I saw him at Mrs. Rudge's this evening,”
“My husband,” said Mrs. Varden, interposing with
emotion, “ would be a great deal better at home than
going to Mrs. Rudge's so often. I don't know what he
does there. I don't see what occasion he has to busy
himself in her affairs at all, sir.”
“If I don't appear to express my concurrence in those
last sentiments of yours," returned Mr. Chester, “quite
so strongly as you might desire, it is because his being
there, my dear madam, and not proving conversational,
led me hither, and procured me the happiness of this in-
terview with one, in whom the whole management, con-
duct, and prosperity of her family are centered, I
perceive.”
With that he took Mrs. Varden's hand again, and
having pressed it to his lips with the high-flown gal-
lantry of the day-a little burlesqued to render it the.
more striking in the good lady's unaccustomed eyes-
proceeded in the same strain of mingled sophistry, ca-
jolery, and flattery, to entreat that her utmost influence
might be exerted to restrain her husband and daughter
from any further promotion of Edward's suit to Miss
Haredale, and from aiding or abetting either party in
any way. Mrs. Varden was but a woman, and had her
share of vanity, obstinacy, and love of power. She en-
tered into a secret treaty of alliance, offensive and
defensive, with her insinuating visitor; and really did
believe, as many others would have done who saw and

heard him, that in so doing she furthered the ends of
truth, justice, and morality, in a very uncommon de-
gree.
Overjoyed by the success of his negotiation, and
mightily amused within himself, Mr. Chester conducted
her down-stairs in the same state as before; and having
repeated the previous ceremony of salutation, which
also as before comprehended Dolly, took his leave; first
completing the conquest of Miss Miggs's heart, by in-
quiring if “this young lady” would light him to the
door,
"Oh, mim," said Miggs, returning with the candle.
“Oh, gracious me, mim, there's a gentleman! Was there
ever such an angel to talk as he is--and such a sweet-
looking man. So upright and noble, that he seems to
despise the very ground he walks on; and yet so mild
and condescending, that he seems to say 'but I will take
notice on it too. And to think of his taking you for
Miss Dolly, and Miss Dolly for your sister-oh, my
goodness me, if I was master wouldn't I be jealous of
him!”
Mrs. Varden reproved her handmaid for this vain-
speaking; but very gently and mildly-quite smilingly
indeed-remarking that she was a foolish, giddy, light-
headed girl, whose spirits carried her beyond all bounds,
and who didn't mean half she said, or she would be
quite angry with her.
“For my part,” said Dolly, in a thoughtful manner,
· I half believe Mr. Chester is something like Miggs in
that respect. For all his politeness and pleasant speak-
ing, I am pretty sure he was making game of us, more
than once."
“If you venture to say such a thing again, and to
speak ill of people behind their backs in my presence,
miss,” said Mrs. Varden, “Ishall insist upon your taking
a candle_and going to bed directly. How dare you,
Dolly? I'm astonished at you. The rudeness of your
whole behaviour this evening has been disgraceful. Did
anybody ever hear,” cried the enraged matron, bursting
into tears, “ of a daughter telling her own mother she
has been made game of!"
What a very uncertain temper Mrs. Varden's was!

CHAPTER XXVIII.
REPAIRING to a noted coffee-house in Covent Garden
when he left the locksmith's, Mr. Chester sat long over
a late dinner, entertaining himself exceedingly with the
whimsical recollection of his recent proceedings, and
congratulating himself very much on his great clever-
ness. Influenced by these thoughts, his face wore an
expression so benign and tranquil, that the waiter in
immediate attendance upon him felt he could almost
have died in his defence, and settled in his own
mind (until the receipt of the bill, and a very small fee
for the very great trouble, disbused it of the idea) that
such an apostolic customer was worth half-a-dozen of
the ordinary run of visitors, at least.
A visit to the gaming-table—not as a heated, anxious
venturer, but one whom it was quite a treat to see
staking his two or three pieces in deference to the follies
of society, and smiling with equal benevolence on
winners and losers—made it late before he reached
home. It was his custom to bid his servant go to bed
at his own time unless he had orders to the contrary,
and to leave a candle on the common stair. There was
a lamp on the landing by which he could always light
it when he came home late, and having a key of the
door about him he could enter and go to bed at his
pleasure.
He opened the glass of the dull lamp, whose wick,
burnt up and swollen like a drunkard's nose, came flying
off in little carbuncles at the candle's touch, and scatter-
ing hot sparks about rendered it a matter of some difficulty
to kindle the lazy taper; when a noise, as of a man
snoring deeply some steps higher up, caused him to
pause and listen. It was the heavy breathing of a
sleeper, close at hand. Some fellow had laid down on
the open staircase, and was slumbering soundly. Having
lighted the candle at length and opened his own door,
he softly ascended, holding the taper high above his
head, and peering cautiously about; curious to see what
kind of man had chosen so comfortless a shelter for his
lodging

BARNABY RUDGE.
With his head upon the landing and his great limbs
flung over half a dozen stairs, as carelessly as though
he were a dead man whom drunken bearers had thrown
down by chance, there lay Hugh, face uppermost, his
long hair drooping like some wild weed upon his wooden
pillow, and his huge chest heaving with the sounds
which so unwontedly disturbed the place and hour. He
who came upon him so unexpectedly was about to break
his rest by thrusting him with his foot, when, glancing
at his upturned face, he arrested himself in the very ac-
tion, and stooping down and shading the candle with his
hand, examined his features closely. Close as his first
inspection was, it did not suffice, for he passed the light,
still carefully shaded as before, across and across his
face, and yet observed him with a searching eye.
While he was thus engaged, the sleeper, without any
starting or turning round, awoke. There was a kind of
fascination in meeting his steady gaze so suddenly which
took from the other the presence of mind to withdraw
his eyes, and forced him, as it were, to meet his look.
So they remained staring at each other, until Mr. Ches-
ter at last broke silence, and asked him, in a low voice,
why he lay sleeping there.
"I thought,” said Hugh, struggling into a sitting pos-
ture and gazing at him intently still, “ that you were a
part of my dream. It was a curious one. I hope it may
never come true, master.”
“What makes you shiver?”
“ The—the cold, I suppose,” he growled, as he shook
himself, and rose. “I hardly know where I am yet.”
“Do you know me?" said Mr. Chester.
“Ay. I know you,” he answered. “I was dreaming
of you-we're not where I thought we were. That's a
comfort.”
He looked round him as he spoke, and in particular
looked above his head, as though he half expected to be
standing under some object which had had existence in
his dream. Then he rubbed his eyes and shook himself
again, and followed his conductor into his own rooms.
Mr. Chester lighted the candles which stood upon his
dressing-table, and wheeling an easy chair towards the
fire, which was yet burning, stirred up a cheerful blaze,
sat down before it, and bade his uncouth visitor “Come
here,” and draw his boots off.

“ You have been drinking again, my fine fellow," he
said, as Hugh went down on one knee, and did as he
was told.
“As I'm alive, master, I've walked the twelve long
miles, and waited here I don't know how long, and had
no drink between my lips since dinner-time at noon."
“And can you do nothing better, my pleasant friend,
than fall asleep, and shake the very building with your
snores?” said Mr. Chester. “Can't you dream in your
straw at home, dull dog as you are, that you need come
here to do it? Reach me those slippers, and tread softly."
Hugh obeyed in silence.
“And harkee, my dear young gentleman,” said Mr.
Chester, as he put them on, “the next time you dream,
don't let it be of me, but of some dog or horse with whom
you are better acquainted. Fill the glass once-you'll
find it and the bottle in the same place--and empty it to
keep yourself awake.”
Hugh obeyed again-even more zealously—and hav-
ing done so, presented himself before his patron.
“Now,” said Mr. Chester, “what do you want with
me?"
“ There was news to-day,” returned Hugh. “Your
son was at our house-came down on horseback. He
tried to see the young woman, but couldn't get sight of
her. He left some letter or some message which our
Joe had charge of, but he and the old one quarrelled
about it when your son had gone, and the old one
wouldn't let it be delivered. He says (that's the old one
does) that none of his people shall interfere and
get him into trouble. He's a landlord, he says, and
lives on everybody's custom.” .
“He's a jewel,” smiled Mr. Chester, “and the better
for being a dull one. Well?”
“Varden's daughter-that's the girl I kissed-
"—And stole the bracelet from upon the king's high-
way,” said Mr. Chester composedly. “Yes; what of
her?
“She wrote a note at our house to the young woman,
saying she lost the letter I brought to you, and you burnt.
Our Joe was to carry it, but the old one kept him at
home all the next day, on purpose that he shouldn't.
Next morning he gave it to me to take; and here it is.”
“You didn't deliver it, then, my good friend?” said

BARNABY RUDGE.
Mr. Chester, twirling Dolly's note between his finger
and thumb, and feigning to be surprised.
“I supposed you'd want to have it," retorted Hugh.
“ Burn one, burn all, I thought.”
“My devil-may-care acquaintance," said Mr. Chester ·
-“really if you do not draw some nicer distinctions,
your career will be cut short with most surprising sud-
denness. Don't you know that the letter you brought
to me was directed to my son, who resides in this very
place? And can you descry no difference between his
letters and those addressed to other people?”
“If you don't want it," said Hugh, disconcerted by
this reproof, for he had expected high praise, “give it
me back, and I'll deliver it. I don't know how to please
you, master.”
" I shall deliver it,” returned his patron, putting it
away after a moment's consideration, “myself. Does
the young lady walk out on fine mornings?"
“ Mostly—about noon is her usual time."
“ Alone?”
“ Yes, alone.”
66 Where?”
“In the grounds before the house. Them that the
footpath crosses.”
“If the weather should be fine, I may throw myself
in her way to-morrow, perhaps,” said Mr. Chester, as
coolly as if she were one of his ordinary acquaintance.
“Mr. Hugh, if I should ride up to the Maypole door,
you will do me the favour only to have seen me once.
You must suppose your gratitude, and endeavour to
forget my forbearance in the matter of the bracelet. It
is natural it should break out, and it does you honour;
but when other folks are by, you must, for your own
sake and safety, be as like your usual self as though
you owed me no obligation whatever, and had never
stood within these walls. You comprehend me?”
Hugh understood him perfectly. After a pause he
muttered that he hoped his patron would involve him in
no trouble about this last letter; for he had kept it back
solely with the view of pleasing him. He was contin-
uing in this strain, when Mr. Chester with a most be-
neficent and patronising air cut him short by saying:
“My good fellow, you have my promise, my word, my
sealed bond (for a verbal pledge with me is quite as good),

that I will always protect you so long as you deserve it.
Now do set your mind at rest. Keep it at ease, I beg of
you. When a man puts himself in my power so thor-
oughly as you have done, I really feel as though he had
a kind of claim upon me. I am more disposed to mercy
and forbearance under such circumstances than I can
tell you, Hugh. Do look upon me as your protector, and
rest assured, I entreat you, that on the subject of that
indiscretion, you may preserve, as long as you and I are
friends, the lightest heart that ever beat within a human
breast. Fill that glass once more to cheer you on your
road homewards-I am really quite ashamed to think
how far you have to go—and then God bless you for the
night.”
* They think,” said Hugh, when he had tossed the
liquor down, “that I am sleeping soundly in the stable.
Ha, ha, ha! The stable door is shut, but the steed's gone,
master.”
“ You are a most convivial fellow,"returned his friend,
“and I love your humour of all things. Good-night!
Take the greatest possible care of yourself, for my sake!"
It was remarkable that during the whole interview,
each had endeavoured to catch stolen glances of the
other's face, and had never looked full at it. They in-
terchanged one brief and hasty glance as Hugh went
out, averted their eyes directly, and so separated. Hugh
closed the double doors behind him, carefully and with-
out noise; and Mr. Chester remained in his easy chair,
with his gaze intently fixed upon the fire.
“Well!” he said, after meditating for a long time-
and said with a deep sigh and an uneasy shifting of his
attitude, as though he dismissed some other subject from
his thoughts, and returned to that which had held pos-
session of them all the day—“the plot thickens; I have
thrown the shell; it will explode, I think, in eight-and-
forty hours, and should scatter these good folks amaz-
ingly. We shall see!”
He went to bed and fell asleep, but had not slept long
when he started up and thought that Hugh was at the
outer door, calling in a strange voice, very different from
his own, to be admitted. The delusion was so strong
upon him, and was so full of that vague terror of the
night in which such visions have their being, that he
rose, and taking his sheathed sword in his hand, opened

the door, and looked out upon the staircase, and towards
the spot where Hugh had lain asleep; and even spoke to
him by name. But all was dark and quiet, and creeping
back to bed again, he fell, after an hour's uneasy watch-
ing, into a second sleep, and woke no more till morning.
CHAPTER XXIX.
THE thoughts of worldly men are forever regulated by
a moral law of gravitation, which, like the physical one,
holds them down to earth. The bright glory of day, and
the silent wonders of a starlit night, appeal to their
minds in vain. There are no signs in the sun, or in the
moon, or in the stars, for their reading. They are like
some wise men, who, learning to know each planet by
its Latin name, have quite forgotten such small heavenly
constellations as Charity, Forbearance, Universal Love,
and Mercy, although they shine by night and day so
brightly that the blind may see them; and who, looking
upward at the spangled sky, see nothing there but the
reflection of their own great wisdom and book-learning.
It is curious to imagine these people of the world, busy
in thought, turning their eyes toward the countless
spheres that shine above us, and making them reflect
the only images their minds contain. The man who
lives but in the breath of princes has nothing in his
sight but stars for courtiers' breasts. The envious man
beholds his neighbours' honours even in the sky; to the
money-hoarder, and the mass of worldly folk, the whole
great universe above glitters with sterling coin-fresh
from the mint-stamped with the sovereign's head,
coming always between them and heaven, turn where
they may. So do the shadows of our own desires stand
between us and our better angels, and thus their bright-
ness is eclipsed.
Everything was fresh and gay, as though the world
were but that morning made, when Mr. Chester rode at
a tranquil pace along the Forest road. Though early in
the season, it was warm and genial weather; the trees
were budding into leaf, the hedges and the grass were
green, and the air was musical with songs of birds, and

227
high above them all the lark poured out her richest
melody. In shady spots, the morning dew sparkled on
each young leaf and blade of grass; and where the sun
was shining, some diamond drops yet glistened brightly,
as in unwillingness to leave so fair a world, and have
such brief existence. Even the light wind, whose rust-
ling was as gentle to the ear as softly falling water, had
its hope and promise; and, leaving a pleasant fragrance
in its track as it went fluttering by, whispered of its in-
tercourse with Summer, and of his happy coming.
The solitary rider went glancing on among the trees,
from sunlight into shade and back again, at the same
even pace-looking about him, certainly, from time to
time, but with no greater thought of the day or the
scene through which he moved than that he was for-
tunate (being choicely dressed) to have such favourable
weather. He smiled very complacently at such times,
but rather as if he were satisfied with himself than with
anything else: and so went riding on, upon his chestnut
cob, as pleasant to look upon as his own horse, and
probably far less sensitive to the many cheerful influ-
ences by which he was surrounded.
In course of time the Maypole's massive chimneys rose
upon his view: but he quickened not his pace one jot,
and with the same cool gravity rode up to the tavern-
porch. John Willet, who was toasting his red face be-
fore a great fire in the bar, and who, with surpassing
foresight and quickness of apprehension, had been think-
ing, as he looked at the blue sky, that if that state of
things lasted much longer, it might ultimately become
necessary to leave off fires and throw the windows
open, issued forth to hold his stirrup; calling lustily for
Hugh.
"Oh, you're here, are you, sir?” said John rather sur-
prised by the quickness with which he appeared. “Take
this here valuable animal into the stable, and have more
than particular care of him if you want to keep your
place. A mortal lazy fellow, sir; he needs a deal of
Iooking after.”
“But you have a son," returned Mr. Chester, giving
his bridle to Hugh as he dismounted, and acknowledg-
ing his salute by a careless motion of his hand towards
his hat. “Why don't you make him useful?”
“Why, the truth is, sir,” replied John with great im-

portance, “that my son—what, you're a listening, are
you, villain?”
"Who's listening?" returned Hugh, angrily. “A treat,
indeed, to hear you speak! Would you have me take
him in till he's cool?”
“Walk him up and down further off, then, sir,” cried
old John, “and when you see me and a noble gentleman
entertaining ourselves with talk, keep your distance.
If you don't know your distance, sir,” added Mr. Willet,
after an enormously long pause, during which he fixed
his great dull eyes on Hugh, and waited with exem-
plary patience for any little property in the way of ideas
that might be coming to him, “ we'll find a way to teach
you, pretty soon.”
Hugh shrugged his shoulders scornfully, and in his
reckless, swaggering way, crossed to the other side of
the little green, and there, with the bridle slung loosely
over his shoulder, led the horse to and fro, glancing at
his master every now and then from under his bushy
eyebrows, with as sinister an aspect as one would desire
to see.
Mr. Chester, who, without appearing to do so, had
eyed him attentively during his brief dispute, stepped
into the porch, and turning abruptly to Mr. Willet,
said:
“You keep strange servants, John."
“Strange enough to look at, sir, certainly," answered
the host; “but out of doors; for horses, dogs, and the
like of that; there ain't a better man in England than is
that Maypole Hugh yonder. He an't fit for indoors,”
added Mr. Willet, with the confidențial air of a man
who felt his own superior nature, “ I do that; but if that
chap had only a little imagination, sir—" .
“He's an active fellow now, I dare swear,” said Mr.
Chester, in a musing tone, which seemed to suggest that
he would have said the same had there been nobody to
hear him.
“ Active, sir,” retorted John, with quite an expression
on his face; “that chap! Hallo there! You, sir! Bring
that horse here, and go and hang my wig on the weather-
cock, to show this gentleman whether you're one of the
lively sort or not."
Hugh made no answer, but throwing the bridle to his
master, and snatching his wig from his head, in a man-

229
ner so unceremonious and hasty, that the action discom-
posed Mr. Willet not a little, though performed at his
own special desire, climbed nimbly to the very summit
of the maypole before the house, and hanging the wig
upon the weathercock, sent it twirling round like a roast-
ing jack. Having achieved this performance, he cast
it on the ground, and sliding down the pole with incon-
ceivable rapidity, alighted on his feet almost as soon as
it had touched the earth.
“ There, sir,” said John, relapsing into his usual stolid
state, “you won't see that at many houses besides the
Maypole, where there's good accommodation for man
and beast-nor that neither, though that with him is
nothing."
This last remark bore reference to his vaulting on
horseback, as upon Mr. Chester's first visit, and disap-
pearing by the stable gate.,
“That with him is nothing,” repeated Mr. Willet,
brushing his wig with his wrist, and invariably resolv-
ing to distribute a small charge for dust and damage to
that article of dress, through the various items of his
guest's bill; “he'll get out of aʼmost any window in the
house! There never was such a chap for flinging him-
self about and never hurting his bones. It's my opinion,
sir, that it's pretty near all owing to his not having
any imagination; and that if imagination could be
(which it can't) knocked into him, he'd never be able
to do it any more. But we was talking, sir, about my
son.”
“True, Willet, true,” said his visitor, turning again
towards the landlord with his accustomed serenity of
face. “My good friend, what about him?”
It has been reported that Mr. Willet, previously to
making answer, winked. But as he never was known
to be guilty of such' lightness of conduct either before
or afterwards, this may be looked upon as a malicious
invention of his enemies—founded, perhaps, upon the
undisputed circumstances of his taking his guest by
the third breast button of his coat, counting down-
ward from the chin, and pouring his reply into his
“Sir,” whispered John, with dignity, “I know my
duty. We want no love-making here, sir, unbeknown
to parents. I respect a certain young gentleman, tak-
ear:

ing him in the light of a young gentleman; I respect
a certain young lady, taking her in the light of a young
lady; but of the two as a couple, I have no knowledge,
sir, none whatever. My son, sir, is upon his patrole.”
“I thought I saw him looking through the corner
window but this moment,” said Mr. Chester, who natur-
ally thought that being on patrole implied walking about
somewhere.
“No doubt you did, sir,” returned John. “He is upon
his patrole of honour, sir, not to leave the premises. Me
and some friends of mine that use the Maypole of an
evening, sir, considered what was best to be done with
him, to prevent his doing anything unpleasant in op-
posing your desires; and we've put him on his patrole.
And what's more, sir, he won't be off his patrole for a
pretty long time to come, I can tell you that.”
When he had communicated this bright idea, which
had had its origin in the perusal by the village cronies
of a newspaper, containing among other matters an
account of how some officer pending the sentence of
some court-martial had been enlarged on parole, Mr.
Willet drew back from his guest's ear, and without any
visible alteration of feature chuckled thrice audibly.
This nearest approach to a laugh in which he ever in-
dulged (and that but seldom and only on extreme occa-
sions) never even curled his lip or effected the smallest
change in-no, not so much as a slight wagging of-his
great, fat, double chin, which at these times, as at all
others, remained a perfect desert in the broad map of his
face : one changeless, dull, tremendous blank.
Lest it should be a matter of surprise to any that Mr.
Willet adopted this bold course in opposition to one whom
he had often entertained, and who had always paid his
way at the Maypole gallantly, it may be remarked that
it was his very penetration and sagacity in this respect
which occasioned him to indulge in those unusual demon-
strations of jocularity just now recorded. For Mr.
Willet, after carefully balancing father and son in his
mental scales, had arrived at the distinct conclusion
that the old gentleman was a better sort of customer
than the young one. Throwing his landlord into the
same scale, which was already turned by this considera-
tion, and heaping upon him again his strong desires to
run counter to the unfortunate Joe, and his opposition as

a general principle to all matters of love and matrimony,
it went down to the very ground straightway, and sent
the light cause of the younger gentleman flying upwards
to the ceiling. Mr. Chester was not the kind of man to
be by any means dim-sighted to Mr. Willet's motives,
but he thanked him as graciously as if he had been one
of the most disinterested martyrs that ever shone on
earth; and leaving him with many complimentary reli-
ances on his great taste and judgment to prepare what-
ever dinner he might deem most fitting the occasion,
bent his steps towards the Warren.
Dressed with more than his usual elegance; assuming
a gracefulness of manner which, though it was the re-
sult of long study, sat easily upon him and became him
well; composing his features into their most serene and
prepossessing expression; and setting in short that
guard upon himself, at every point, which denoted that
he attached no slight importance to the impression he
was about to make; he entered the bounds of Miss Hare-
dale's usual walk. He had not gone far, or looked about
him long, when he descried coming towards him a
female figure. A glimpse of the form and dress as she
crossed a little wooden bridge which lay between them
satisfied him that he had found her whom he desired to
see. He threw himself in her way, and a very few paces
brought them close together.
He raised his hat from his head, and yielding the path,
suffered her to pass him. Then, as if the idea had but
that moment occurred to him, he turned hastily back
and said in an agitated voice:
“I beg pardon-do I address Miss Haredale ?"
She stopped in some confusion at being so unexpect-
edly accosted by a stranger, and answered, “ Yes."
“Something told me,” he said, looking a compliment
to her beauty, “that it could be no other. Miss Hare-
dale, I bear a name which is not unknown to you—which
it is a pride, and yet a pain to me to know, sounds pleas-
antly in your ears. I am a man advanced in life, as you
see. I am the father of him whom you honour and dis-
tinguish above all other men. May I for weighty rea-
sons, which fill me with distress, beg but a minute's
conversation with you here ?”
Who that was inexperienced in deceit, and had a frank
and youthful heart, could doubt the speaker's truth-

could doubt it, too, when the voice that, spoke was like
the faint echo of one she knew. So well, and so much
loved to hear ? She inclined her head, and stopping
cast her eyes upon the ground.
“A little more apart-among these trees. It is an
old man's hand, Miss Haredale, an honest one, be-
lieve me.”
She put hers in it as he said these words, and suffered
him to lead her to a neighbouring seat.
“You alarm me, sir,” she said in a low voice. You
are not the bearer of any ill news, I hope ?”
“Of none that you anticipate,” he answered, sitting
down beside her. “Edward is well-quite well. It is
of him I wish to speak, certainly; but I have no misfor-
tune to communicate.”
She bowed her head again, and made as though she
would have begged him to proceed; but said nothing.
“I am sensible that I speak to you at a disadvantage,
dear Miss Haredale. Believe me that I am not so for-
getful of the feelings of my younger days as not to know
that you are little disposed to view me with favour. You
have heard me described as cold-hearted, calculating,
selfish ”
“I have never, sir,"—she interposed with an altered
manner and a firmer voice; “I have never heard you
spoken of in harsh or disrespectful terms. You do a
great wrong to Edward's nature if you believe him cap-
able of any mean or base proceeding.”
“Pardon me, my sweet young lady, but your uncle—”
“Nor is it my uncle's nature either,” she replied,
with a heightened colour in her cheek. “It is not his
nature to stab in the dark, nor is it mine to love such
deeds.”
She rose as she spoke, and would have left him; but
he detained her with a gentle hand, and besought her in
such persuasive accents to hear him but another minute,
that she was easily prevailed upon to comply, and so sat
down again.
“And it is,” said Mr. Chester, looking upwards, and
apostrophising the air, “it is this frank, ingenuous,
noble nature, Ned, that you can wound so lightly. Shame
--shame upon you, boy!”
She turned towards him quickly, and with a scornful
look and flashing eyes. There were tears in Mr. Ches-

son a you, he sa
flinman's
ter's, but he dashed them hurriedly away, as though un-
willing that his weakness should be known, and regarded
her with mingled admiration and compassion.
“I never until now,” he said, “believed that the frivo-
lous actions of a young man could move me like these
of my own son. I never knew till now the worth of a
woman's heart, which boys so lightly win, and lightly
fling away. Trust me, dear young lady, that I never
until now did know your worth; and though an abhor-
rence of deceit and falsehood has impelled me to seek
you out, and would have done so had you been the poor-
est and least gifted of your sex, I should have lacked the
fortitude to sustain this interview could I have pictured
you to my imagination as you really are.”
Oh! If Mrs. Varden could have seen the virtuous gen-
tleman as he said these words, with indignation spark-
ling from his eyes—if she could have heard his broken,
quivering voice-if she could have beheld him as he
stood bareheaded in the sunlight, and with unwonted
energy poured forth his eloquence!
With a haughty face, but pale and trembling too,
Emma regarded him in silence. She neither spoke nor
moved, but gazed upon him as though she would look
into his heart.
“I throw off,” said Mr. Chester, “ the restraint which
natural affection would impose on some men, and reject
all bonds but those of truth and duty. Miss Haredale,
you are deceived; you are deceived by your unworthy
lover and my unworthy son."
Still she looked at him steadily, and still said not one
word.
“I have ever opposed his professions of love for you;
you will do me the justice, dear Miss Haredale, to re-
member that. Your uncle and myself were enemies in
early life, and if I had sought retaliation I might have
found it here. But as we grow older, we grow wiser-
better I would fain hope-and from the first I have op-
posed him in this attempt. I foresaw the end, and would
have spared you if I could.”
“Speak plainly, sir,” she faltered. “You deceive me
or are deceived yourself. I do not believe you-Icannot
- I should not."
“First,” said Mr.Chester, soothingly, “for there may be
in your mind some latent angry feeling to which I would

not appeal, pray take this letter. It reached my hands
by chance, and by mistake, and should have accounted
to you (as I am told) for my son's not answering some
other note of yours. God forbid, Miss Haredale,” said
the good gentleman, with great emotion, “that there
should be in your gentle breast one causeless ground of
quarrel with him. You should know, and you will see,
that he was in no fault here."
There appeared something so very candid, so scrupu-
lously honourable, so very truthful and just in this course
-something which rendered the upright person who re-
sorted to it so worthy of belief-that Emma's heart, for
the first time, sunk within her. She turned away, and
burst into tears.
“I would,” said Mr. Chester, leaning over her, and
speaking in mild and quite venerable accents; “I would,
dear girl, it were my task to banish, not increase,
those tokens of your grief. My son, my erring son-I
will not call him deliberately criminal in this, for men so
young, who have been inconstant twice or thrice before,
act without reflection, almost without a knowledge of
the wrong they do—will break his plighted faith to you;
has broken it even now. Shall I stop here, and having
given you this warning, leave it to be fulfilled, or shall
I go on?”
“ You will go on, sir,” she answered, “and speak more
plainly yet, in justice both to him and me.”
“My dear girl," said Mr. Chester, bending over her
more affectionately still, “whom I would call my
daughter, but the Fates forbid, Edward seeks to break
with you upon a false and most unwarrantable pretence.
I have it on his own showing; in his own hand. Forgive
me, if I have had a watch upon his conduct; I am his
father; I had a regard for your peace and his honour,
and no better resource was left me. There lies on his
desk at this moment, ready for transmission to you, a
letter, in which he tells you that our poverty—our pov-
erty; his and mine, Miss Haredale-forbids him to pursue
his claim upon your hand; in which he offers, volun-
tarily proposés, to free you from your pledge, and talks
magnanimously (men do so, very commonly, in such
cases) of being in time more worthy your regard-and
so forth. A letter, to be plain, in which he not only jilts
you—pardon the word; I would summon to your aid

235
your pride and dignity--not only jilts you, I fear, in
favour of the object whose slighting treatment first
inspired his brief passion for yourself and gave it birth
in wounded vanity, but affects to make a merit and a
virtue of the act.”
She glanced proudly at him once more, as by an invol-
untary impulse, and with a swelling breast rejoined:
“If what you say be true, he takes much needless trouble,
sir, to compass his design. He is very tender of my
peace of mind. I quite thank him.”
“ The truth of what I tell you, dear young lady,” he
replied, “you will test by the receipt or non-receipt of
the letter of which I speak. Haredale, my dear fellow,
I am delighted to see you, although we meet under
singular circumstances, and upon a melancholy occa-
sion. I hope you are very well.”
At these words the young lady raised her eyes, which
were filled with tears, and seeing that her uncle indeed
stood before them, and being quite unequal to the trial
of hearing or of speaking one word more, hurriedly
withdrew and left them. They stood looking at each
other and at her retreating figure, and for a long time
neither of them spoke.
- What does this mean? Explain it,” said Mr. Hare-
dale at length. “Why are you here, and why with her?”
“My dear friend,” rejoined the other, resuming his
accustomed manner with infinite readiness, and throw-
ing himself upon the bench with a weary air, “you told
me not very long ago, at that delightful old tavern of
which you are the esteemed proprietor (and a most
charming establishment it is for persons of rural pur-
suits and in robust health, who are not liable to take
cold), that I had the head and heart of an evil spirit in
all matters of deception. I thought at that time, I really
did think, you flattered me. But now I begin to wonder
at your discernment, and vanity apart, do honestly be-
lieve you spoke the truth. Did you ever counterfeit ex-
treme ingenuousness and honest indignation? My dear
fellow, you have no conception, if you never did, how
faint the effort makes one.'
Mr. Haredale surveyed him with a look of cold con-
tempt. “You may evade an explanation, I know,” he
said, folding his arms. “But I must have it. I can
wait.”

“Not at all. Not at all, my good fellow. You shali
not wait a moment,” returned his friend, as he lazily
crossed his legs. “The simplest thing in the world. It
lies in a nut-shell. Ned has written her a letter-a boy-
ish, honest, sentimental composition, which remains as
yet in his desk, because he hasn't had the heart to send
it. I have taken a liberty, for which my parental affec-
tion and anxiety are a sufficient excuse, and possessed
myself of the contents. I have described them to your
niece (a most enchanting person, Haredale; quite an
angelic creature), with a little colouring and description
adapted to our purpose. It's done. You may be quite
easy. It's all over. Deprived of their adherents and
mediators; her pride and jealousy roused to the utmost;
with nobody to undeceive her, and you to confirm me,
you will find that their intercourse will close with her
answer. If she receives Ned's letter by to-morrow noon,
you may date their parting from to-morrow night. No
thanks, I beg; you owe me none. I have acted for my-
self, and if I have forwarded our compact with all the
ardour even you could have desired, I have done so
selfishly, indeed.”
“I curse the compact, as you call it, with my whole
heart and soul,” returned the other. “It was made in
an evil hour. I have bound myself to a lie; I have
leagued myself with you; and though I did so with a
righteous motive, and though it cost me such an effort
as happily few men know, I hate and despise myself for
the deed.”
"You are very warm,” said Mr. Chester, with a lan-
guid smile.
“I am warm. I am maddened by your coldness.
'Death, Chester, if your blood ran warmer in your veins,
and there were no restraints upon me, such as those that
hold and drag me back—well; it is done; you tell me so,
and on such a point I may believe you. When I am
most remorseful for this treachery, I will think of you
and your marriage, and try to justify myself in such
remembrances, for having torn asunder Emma and your
son, at anycost. Our bond is cancelled now, and we
may part."
Mr. Chester kissed his hand gracefully; and with the
same tranquil face he had preserved throughout-even
when he had seen his companion so tortured and trans-

ported by his passion that his whole frame was shaken-
lay in his lounging posture on the seat and watched him
as he walked away.
“My scape-goat and my drudge at school,” he said,
raising his head to look after him; “my friend of later
days, who could not keep his mistress when he had won,
her, and threw me in her way to carry off the prize; I'
triumph in the present and the past. Bark on, ill-
favoured, ill-conditioned cur; fortune has ever been
with me-I like to hear you.”
The spot where they had met was in an avenue of
trees. Mr. Haredale not passing out on either hand
had walked straight on. He chanced to turn his head
when at some considerable distance, and seeing that his
late companion had by that time risen and was looking
after him, stood still as though he half expected him to.
follow and waited for his coming up.
“It may come to that one day, but not yet,” said Mr.
Chester, waving his hand, as though they were the best
of friends, and turning away. “Not yet, Haredale.
Life is pleasant enough to me; dull and full of heaviness
to you. No. To cross swords with such a man-to in-
dulge his humour unless upon extremity-would be weak
indeed.”
For all that, he drew his sword as he walked along,
and in an absent humour ran his eye from hilt to point
full twenty times. But thoughtfulness begets wrinkles;
remembering this, he soon put it up, smoothed his con-
tracted brow, hummed a gay tune with greater gaiety
of manner, and was his unruffled self again.

CHAPTER XXX.
A HOMELY proverb recognises the existence of a trouble-
some class of persons who, having an inch conceded
them, will take an ell. Not to quote the illustrious ex.
amples of those heroic scourges of mankind, whose
amiable path in life has been from birth to death through
blood, and fire, and ruin, and who would seem to have
existed for no better purpose than to teach mankind
that as the absence of pain is pleasure, so the earth,
purged of their presence, may be deemed a blessed place
—not to quote such mighty instances it will be sufficient
to refer to old John Willet.
Old John having long encroached a good standard
inch, full measure, on the liberty of Joe, and having
snipped off a Flemish ell in the matter of the parole,
grew so despotic and so great, that his thirst for con-
quest knew no bounds. The more young Joe submitted,
the more absolute old John became. The ell soon faded
into nothing. Yards, furlongs, miles arose; and on went
old John in the pleasantest manner possible, trimming
off an exuberance in this place, shearing away some
liberty of speech or action in that, and conducting him-
self in his small way with as much high mightiness and
majesty as the most glorious tyrant that ever had his
statue reared in the public ways of ancient or of modern
times.
As great men are urged on to the abuse of power
(when they need urging, which is not often) by their
flatterers and dependents, so old John was impelled to
these exercises of authority by the applause and admira-
tion of his Maypole cronies, who, in the intervals of their
nightly pipes and pots, would shake their heads and say
that Mr. Willet was a father of the good old English
sort; that there was no new-fangled notions or modern
ways in him; that he put them in mind of what their
fathers were when they were boys; that there was no
mistake about him; that it would be well for the country
if there were more like him, and more was the pity that
there were not; with many other original remarks of
that nature. Then they would condescendingly give

Joe to understand that it was all for his good, and he
would be thankful for it one day; and in particular, Mr.
Cobb would acquaint him, that when he was his age his
father thought no more of giving him a parental kick,
or a box on the ears, or a cuff on the head, or some little
admonition of that sort, than he did of any other ordi-
nary duty of life; and he would further remark, with
looks of great significance, that but for this judicious
bringing up he might have never been the man he was
at that present speaking; which was probable enough,
as he was, beyond all question, the dullest dog of the
party. In short, between old John, and old John's
friends, there never was an unfortunate young fellow so
bullied, badgered, worried, fretted, and browbeaten;
so constantly beset, or made so tired of his life, as poor
Joe Willet.
This had come to be the recognised and established
state of things; but as John was very anxious to flourish
his supremacy before the eyes of Mr. Chester, he did
that day exceed himself, and did so goad and chaff his
son and heir that, but for Joe's having made a solemn
vow to keep his hands in his pockets when they were not
otherwise engaged, it is impossible to say what he might
have done with them. But the longest day has an end,
and at length Mr. Chester came down-stairs to mount
his horse, which was ready at the door.
As old John was not in the way at the moment, Joe,
who was sitting in the bar ruminating on his dismal
fate and the manifold perfections of Dolly Varden, ran
out to hold the gent's stirrup, and assist him to mount.
Mr. Chester was scarcely in the saddle, and Joe was in
in the very act of making him a graceful bow, when old
John came diving out of the porch and collared him.
“None of that, sir,” said John, “none of that, sir.
No breaking of patroles. How dare you come out of
the door, sir, without leave? You're trying to get away,
sir, are you, and to make a traitor of yourself again?
What do you mean, sir?”
“Let me go, father,” said Joe, imploringly, as he
marked the smile upon their visitor's face, and observed
the pleasure his disgrace afforded him. “This is too
bad. Who wants to get away?”.
" Who wants to get away!cried John, shaking him.
“Why you do, sir, you do. You're the boy, sir,” added

John, collaring with one hand, and aiding the effect of
a farewell bow to the visitor with the other, “ that wants
to sneak into houses, and stir up differences between
noble gentlemen and their sons, are you, eh? Hold your
tongue, sir.”
Joe made no effort to reply. It was the crowning
circumstance of his degradation. He extricated himself
from his father's grasp, darted an angry look at the de-
parting guest, and returned into the house.
“But for her," thought Joe, as he threw his arms upon
a table in the common room,and laid his head upon them,
“but for Dolly, who I couldn't bear should think me the
rascal they would make me out to be if I ran away, this
house and I should part to-night.”
It being evening by this time, Solomon Daisy, Tom
Cobb, and Long Parkes, were all in the common room
too, and had from the window been witnesses of what
occurred. Mr. Willet joining them soon afterwards, re-
ceived the compliments of the company with great
composure, and lighting his pipe, sat down among them.
“We'll see, gentlemen,” said John, after a long pause,
“who's the master of this house, and who isn't. We'll
see whether boys are to govern men, or men are to
govern boys.”
“And quite right too,” assented Solomon Daisy, with
some approving nods; "quite right, Johnny. Very good,
Johnny. Well said, Mr. Willet. Brayvo, sir.”
John slowly brought his eyes to bear upon him, looked
at him for a long time, and finally made answer, to the
unspeakable consternation of his hearers, “When I
want encouragement from you, sir, I'll ask you for it.
You let me alone, sir. I can get on without you, I hope.
Don't you tackle me, sir, if you please.”
“Don't take it ill, Johnny; I didn't mean any harm,"
pleaded the little man.
“Very good, sir,” said John, more than usually obsti-
nate after his late success. “Never mind, sir. I can
stand pretty firm of myself, sir, I believe, without being
shored up by you.” After having given utterance to
this retort, Mr. Willet fixed his eyes upon the boiler, and
fell into a kind of tobacco-trance.
The spirits of the company being somewhat damped
by this embarrassing line of conduct on the part of their
host, nothing more was said for a long time; but at

241
length Mr. Cobb took upon himself to remark, as he rose
to knock the ashes out of his pipe, that he hoped Joe
would thenceforth learn to obey his father in all things;
that he had found, that day, he was not one of the sort
of men to be trifled with; and that he would recommend
him, poetically speaking, to mind his eye for the future.
“I'd recommend you, in return,” said Joe, looking up
with a flushed face, “not to talk to me.”
“Hold your tongue, sir,” cried Mr. Willet, suddenly
rousing himself, and turning round.
“I won't, father,” cried Joe, smiting the table with
his fist, so that the jugs and glasses rung again; “these
things are hard enough to bear from you; from anybody
else I never will endure them any more. Therefore I
say, Mr. Cobb, don't talk to me."
Why, who are you,” said Mr. Cobb, sneeringly,
“that you're not to be talked to, eh, Joe?”
To which Joe returned no answer,.but, with a very
omnious shake of the head, resumed his old position,
which he would have peacefully preserved until the
house shut up at night, but that Mr. Cobb, stimulated
by the wonder of the company at the young man's pre-
sumption, retorted with sundry taunts, which proved too
much for flesh and blood to bear. Crowding into one
moment the vexation and the wrath of years, Joe started
up, overturned the table, fell upon his long enemy,
pummelled him with all his might and main, and finished
by driving him with surprising swiftness against a heap
of spittoons in one corner; plunging into which, head
foremost, with a tremendous crash, he lay at full length
among the ruins, stunned and motionless. Then, with-
out waiting to receive the compliments of the bystanders
on the victory he had won, he retreated to his own bed-
chamber, and considering himself in a state of siege,
piled all the portable furniture against the door by way
of barricade.
“I have done it now,” said Joe, as he sat down upon
his bedstead and wiped his heated face. “I knew it
would come at last. The Maypole and I must part
company. I'm a roving vagabond-she hates me for
evermore—it's all over !"

CHAPTER XXXI.
PONDERING on his unhappy lot, Joe satand listened for a
long time, expecting every moment to hear their creaking
footsteps on the stairs, or to be greeted by his worthy
father with a summons to capitulate unconditionally,and
deliver himself up straightway. But neither voice nor
footstep came; and though some distant echoes, as of clos-
ing doors and people hurrying in and out of rooms, re-
sounding from time to time through the great passages,
and penetrating to his remote seclusion, gave note of un-
usual commotion down-stairs, no nearer sound disturbed
his place of retreat, which seemed the quieter for these
far-off noises, and was as dull and full of gloom as'any
hermit's cell.
It came on darker and darker. The old-fashioned fur-
niture of the chamber, which was a kind of hospital for
all the invalided movables in the house, grew indistinct
and shadowy in its many shapes; chairs and tables,
which by day were as honest cripples as need be, as-
sumed a doubtful and mysterious character; and one old
leprous screen of faded India leather and gold bind-
ing, which had kept out many a cold breath of air in
days of yore, and shut in many a jolly face, frowned on
him with a spectral aspect, and stood at full height in
its allotted corner, like some gaunt ghost who waited to
be questioned. A portrait opposite the window—a queer,
old grey-eyed general, in an oval frame-seemed to wink
and doze as the light decayed, and at length, when the
last faint glimmering speck of day went out, to shut its
eyes in good earnest, and fall sound asleep. There was
such a hush and mystery about everything that Joe
could not help following its example; and so went off
into slumber likewise, and dreamed of Dolly till the
clock of Chigwell church struck two..
Still nobody came. The distant noises in the house
had ceased, and out of doors all was quiet too; save for
the occasional barking of some deep-mouthed dog, and
the shaking of the branches by the night wind. He
gazed mournfully out of the window at each well-known

and creeping back to his former seat, thought about the
late uproar, until, with long thinking of, it seemed to
have occurred a month ago. Thus, between dozing, and
thinking, and walking to the window and looking out,
the night wore away; the grim old screen, and the kin-
dred chairs and tables, began slowly to reveal themselves
in their accustomed forms; the grey-eyed general seemed
to wink and yawn and rouse himself; and at last he was
broad awake again, and very uncomfortable and cold
and haggard he looked in the dull grey light of morning.
The sun had begun to peep above the forest trees, and
already flung across the curling mist bright bars of gold,
when Joe dropped from his window on the ground be-
low a little bundle and his trusty stick, and prepared to
descend himself.
It was not a very difficult task, for there were so many
projections and gable ends in the way, that they formed
a series of clumsy steps, with no greater obstacle than
a jump of some few feet at last. Joe, with his stick and
bundle on his shoulder, quickly stood on the firm earth,
and looked up at the old Maypole, it might be for the
last time.
He didn't apostrophise it, for he was no great scholar.
He didn't curse it, for he had little ill-will to give to
anything on earth. He felt more affectionate and kind
to it than ever he had done in all his life before, so said
with all his heart, “God bless you!" as a parting wish,
and turned away.
He walked along at a brisk pace, big with great
thoughts of going for a soldier and dying in some foreign
country where it was very hot and sandy, and
leaving God knows what unheard-of wealth in prize-
money to Dolly, who would be very much affected when
she came to know of it; and full of such youthful visions,
which were sometimes sanguine and sometimes melan-
choly, but always had her for their main point and
centre, pushed on vigourously until the noise of London
sounded in his ears, and the Black Lion hove in sight.
It was only eight o'clock then, and very much aston-
ished the Black Lion was to see him walking in with
dust upon his feet at that early hour, with no grey mare
to bear him company. But as he ordered breakfast to
be got ready with all speed, and on its being set before
him gave indisputable tokens of a hearty appetite, the
as to y hour, wirted breakf before

Lion received him, as usual, with a hospitable welcome;
and treated him with those marks of distinction which,
as a regular customer, and one within the freemasonry
of the trade, he had a right to claim.
This Lion or landlord-for he was called both man and
beast, by reason of his having instructed the artist who
painted his sign, to convey into the features of the lordly
brute, whose effigy it bore, as near a counterpart of his
own face as his skill could compass and devise—was a
gentleman almost as quick of apprehension, and of al-
most as subtle a wit, as the mighty John himself. But
the difference between them lay in this; that whereas
Mr. Willet's extreme sagacity and acuteness were the
efforts of unassisted nature, the Lion stood indebted, in
no small amount, to beer; of which he swigged such co-
pious draughts, that most of his faculties were utterly
drowned and washed away, except the one great faculty
of sleep, which he retained in surprising perfection.
The creaking Lion over the house-door was, therefore,
to say the truth, rather a drowsy, tame and feeble lion;
and as these social representatives of a savage class are
usually of a conventional character (being depicted, for
the most part, in impossible attitudes and of unearthly
colours), he was frequently supposed by the more ignor-
ant and uninformed among the neighbours to be the
veritable portrait of the host as he appeared on the occa-
sion of some great funeral ceremony or public mourning.
“What noisy fellow is that in the next room?” said
Joe, when he had disposed of his breakfast, and had
washed and brushed himself.
6. A recruiting serjeant,” replied the Lion.
Joe started involuntarily. Here was the very thing
he had been dreaming of all the way along.
“And I wish,” said the Lion, “he was anywhere else
but here. The party make noise enough, but they won't
call for much. There's great cry there, Mr. Willet, but
very little wool. Your father wouldn't like 'em, I
know."
Perhaps not much under any circumstances. Perhaps
if he could have known what was passing at that mo-
ment in Joe's mind, he would have liked them still less.
“Is he recruiting for a-for a fine regiment?" said
Joe, glancing at a little round mirror that hung in the
bar,

“I believe he is,” replied the host. “It's much the
same thing, whatever regiment he's recruiting for.
I'm told there an't a deal of difference between a fine
man and another one, when they're shot through and
through.”
“They're not all shot,” said Joe.
“No," the Lion answered, “not all. Those that are
-supposing it's done easy-are the best off in my
opinion.”
"Ah!" retorted Joe, “but you don't care for glory.”
“For what?” said the Lion.
“Glory."
.“No," returned the Lion, with supreme indifference.
“I don't. You're right in that, Mr. Willet. When
Glory comes here, and calls for anything to drink and
changes a guinea to pay for it, I'll give it him for noth-
ing. It's my belief, sir, that the Glory's arms wouldn't
do a very strong business.”
These remarks were not at all comforting. Joe walked
out, stopped at the door of the next room and listened.
Thé serjeant was describing a military life. It was all
drinking, he said, except that there were frequent inter-
vals of eating and love-making. A battle was the finest
thing in the world—when your side won it-and Eng-
lishmen always did that. “Supposing you should be
killed, sir?” said a timid voice in one corner. “Well,
sir, supposing you should be,” said the serjeant, “what
then? Your country loves you, sir; his Majesty King
George the Third loves you; your memory is honoured,
revered, respected; everybody's fond of you, and grate-
ful to you; your name's wrote down at full length in a
book in the War-office. Damme, gentlemen, we must
all die some time or another, eh?”
The voice coughed, and said no more.
Joe walked into the room. A group of half-a-dozen
fellows had gathered together in the tap-room, and were
listening with greedy ears. One of them, a carter in a
smock frock, seemed wavering and disposed to enlist.
The rest, who were by no means disposed, strongly
urged him to do so (according to the custom of man-
kind), backed the serjeant's arguments, and grinned
among themselves. “I say nothing, boys,” said the
serjeant, who sat a little apart drinking his liquor. “For
lads of spirit”-here he cast an eye on Joe_" this is

the time. It. I hope ater. We
the time. I don't want to inveigle you. The king's not
come to that, I hope. Brisk young blood is what we
want; not milk and water. We won't take five men out
of six. We want top-sawyers, we do. I'm not a-going
to tell tales out of school, but, damme, if every gentle-
man's son that carries arms in our corps, through being
under a cloud and having little differences with his
relations, was counted up”-here his eye fell on Joe
again, and so good-naturedly that Joe beckoned him out.
He came directly.
“You're a gentleman, by G-!” was his first remark,
as he slapped him on the back. “You're a gentleman
in disguise. So am I. Let's swear a friendship.”
Joe didn't exactly do that, but he shook hands with
him and thanked him for his good opinion.
“You want to serve,” said his new friend. “You
shall. You were made for it. You're one of us by
nature. What'll you take to drink?"
“Nothing just now,” replied Joe, smiling faintly. “I
haven't quite made up my mind.”
“A mettlesome fellow like you, and not made up his
mind!” cried the serjeant. “Here-let me give the bell
a pull, and you'll make up your mind in half a minute, I
know.”
“You're right so far," answered Joe, “for if you pull
the bell here, where I'm known, there'll be an end of my
soldiering inclinations in no time. Look in my face.
You see me, do you?”
“I do,” replied the serjeant, with an oath, “and a finer ·
young fellow or one better qualified to serve his king
and country, I never set my's—he used an adjective in
this place—"eyes on.”
“Thank you,” said Joe, “I didn't ask you for want of
a compliment, but thank you all the same. Do I look
like a sneaking fellow or a liar?”
The serjeant rejoined with many choice asservations
that he didn't; and that if his (the serjeant's) own father
were to say he did, he would run the old gentleman
through the body cheerfully and consider it a meri-
torious action.
Joe expressed his obligation, and continued: “You
can trust me then, and credit what I say. I believe I
shall enlist into your regiment to-night. The reason I
don't do so now is because I don't want until to-night to

do what I can't recall. Where shall I find you this
evening?"
His friend replied with some unwillingness, and after
much ineffectual entreaty having for its object the im-
mediate settlement of the business, that his quarters
would be at the Crooked Billet in Tower Street; where
he would be found waking until midnight, and sleeping
until breakfast-time to-morrow.
“And if I do come—which it's a million to one I shall
-when will you take me out of London?" demanded
Joe.
“To-morrow morning, at half-after eight o'clock,” re-
plied the serjeant. “You'll go abroad-a country where
it's all sunshine and plunder—the finest climate in the
world.”
“To go abroad,” said Joe, shaking hands with him,
“is the very thing I want. You may expect me.”
“You're the kind of lad for us,” cried the serjeant,
holding Joe's hand in his, in the excess of his admira-
tion. “You're the boy to push your fortune! I don't
say it because I bear you an envy, or would take away
from the credit of the rise you'll make, but if I had been
bred and taught like you, I'd have been a colonel by this
time.” .
“Tush, man!” said Joe, “I'm not so young as that.
Needs must when the devil drives; and the devil that
drives me is an empty pocket and an unhappy home.
For the present, good-bye.”
“For king and country!” cried the serjeant, flourish-
ing his cap.
*For bread and meat!” cried Joe, snapping his fingers.
And so they parted.
He had very little money in his pocket; so little, in-
deed, that after paying for his breakfast (which he was
too honest and perhaps too proud to score up to his
father's charge) he had but a penny left. He had courage,
notwithstanding, to resist all the affectionate importu-
nities of the serjeant, who waylaid him at the door with
many protestations of eternal friendship, and did in
particular request that he would do him the favour to
accept of only one shilling as a temporary accommoda-
tion. Rejecting his offers both of cash and credit, Joe
walked away with stick and bundle as before, bent upon
getting through the day as he best could, and going

down to the locksmith's in the dusk of the evening; for
it should go hard, he had resolved, but he would have a
parting word with charming Dolly Varden.
He went out by Islington and so on to Highgate, and
sat on many stones and gates, but there were no voices
in the bells to bid him turn. Since the time of noble
Whittington, fair flower of merchants, bells have come
to have less sympathy with humankind. They only ring
for money and on state occasions. Wanderers have
increased in number; ships leave the Thames for dis-
tant regions, carrying from stem to stern no other cargo;
the bells are silent; they ring out no entreaties or re-
grets; they are used to it and have grown wordly.
Joe bought a roll, and reduced his purse to the condi-
tion (with a difference) of that celebrated purse of For-
tunatus, which, whatever were its favoured owner's
necessities, had one unvarying amount in it. In these
real times, when all the Faries are dead and buried,
there are still a great many purses which possess that
quality. The sum-total they contain is expressed in
arithmetic by a circle, and whether it be added to or
multiplied by its own amount, the result of the problem
is more easily stated than any known in figures.
Evening drew on at last. With the desolate and soli-
tary feeling of one who had no home or shelter, and was
alone utterly in the world for the first time, he bent his
steps towards the locksmith's house. He had delayed till
now, knowing that Mrs. Varden sometimes went out
alone, or with Miggs for her sole attendant, to lectures
in the evening; and devoutly hoping that this might be
one of her nights of moral culture..
He had walked up and down before the house, on the
opposite side of the way, two or three times, when, as he
returned to it again, he caught a glimpse of a fluttering
skirt at the door. It was Dolly's to whom else could it
belong? no dress but hers had such a flow as that. He
plucked up his spirits, and followed it into the workshop
of the Golden Key.
His darkening the door caused her to look round. Oh,
that face!“If it hadn't been for that,” thought Joe,
“I should never have walked into poor Tom Cobb.
She's twenty times handsomer than ever. She might
marry a Lord!”
He didn't say this. He only thought it-perhaps

looked it also. Dolly was glad to see him, and was so
sorry her father and mother were away from home. Joe
begged she wouldn't mention it on any account.
Dolly hesitated to lead the way into the parlour, for
there it was nearly dark; at the same time she hesitated
to stand talking in the workshop, which was yet light
and open to the street. They had got by some means,
too, before the little forge; and Joe having her hand in
his (which he had no right to have, for Dolly only gave
it him to shake), it was so like standing before some
homely altar being married, that it was the most em-
barrassing state of things in the world.
“I have come,” said Joe, “ to say good-bye-to say
good-bye for I don't know how many years; perhaps
forever. I am going abroad.”
Now this was exactly what he should not have said.
Here he was, talking like a gentleman at large who was
free to come and go and roam about the world at his
pleasure, when that gallant coachmaker had vowed but
the night before that Miss Varden held him bound in
adamantine chains; and had positively stated in so many
words that she was killing him by inches, and that in a
fortnight more or thereabouts he expected to make a
decent end and leave the business to his mother.
Dolly released her hand and said, “Indeed!” She re-
marked in the same breath that it was a fine night, and,
in short, betrayed no more emotion than the forge itself.
“I couldn't go,” said Joe, “without coming to see you.
I hadn't the heart to.”
Dolly was more sorry than she could tell that he
should have taken so much trouble. It was such a long
way, and he must have such a deal to do. And how
was Mr. Willet—that dear old gentleman”.
“Is this all you say!” cried Joe.
All! Good gracious, what did the man expect! She
was obliged to take her apron in her hand and run her
eyes along the hem from corner to corner, to keep her-
self from laughing in his face—not because his gaze
confused her- not at all.
Joe had small experience in love affairs, and had no
notion how different young ladies are at different times;
he had expected to take Dolly up again at the very point
where he had left her after that delicious evening ride,
and was no more prepared for such an alteration than
ad lot to take ung ladion

bye.”
to see the sun and moon change places. He had buoyed
himself up all day with an indistinct idea that she would
certainly say “Don't go,” or “Don't leave us,” or “Why
do you go?” or “Why do you leave us?” or would give
him some little encouragement of that sort; he had even
entertained the possibility of her bursting into tears, of
her throwing herself into his arms, of her falling down
in a fainting fit without previous word or sign; but any
approach to such a line of conduct as this had been
so far from his thoughts that he could only look at her
in silent wonder.
Dolly in the meanwhile turned to the corners of her
apron, and measured the sides, and smoothed out the
wrinkles, and was as silent as he. At last, after a long
pause, Joe said good-bye. “Good-bye” said Dolly
with as pleasant a smile as if he were going into the
next street, and were coming back to supper; “good-
“Come,” said Joe, putting out both his hands, “Dolly,
dear Dolly, don't let us part like this. I love you dearly,
with all my heart and soul; with as much truth and
earnestness as ever man loved woman in this world, I
do believe. I am a poor fellow, as you know-poorer
now than ever, for I have fled from home, not being
able to bear it any longer, and must fight my own way
without help. You are beautiful, admired, are loved by
everybody, are well off and happy; and may you ever
be so! Heaven forbid I should ever make you other-
wise; but give me a word of comfort. Say something
kind to me. I have no right to expect it of you, I know,
but I ask it because I love you, and shall treasure the
slightest word from you all through my life. Dolly,
dearest, have you nothing to say to me?”
No. Nothing. Dolly was a coquette by nature, and
a spoilt child. She had no notion of being carried by
storm in this way. The coachmaker would have been
dissolved in tears, and would have knelt down, and
called himself names, and clasped his hands, and beat
his breast, and tugged wildly at his cravat, and done all
all kinds of poetry. Joe had no business to be going
abroad. He had no right to be able to do it. If he was
in adamantine chains, he couldn't.
“I have said good-bye,” said Dolly, “twice. Take
your arm away directly, Mr. Joseph, or I'll call Miggs."

“I'll not reproach you,"answered Joe; “it's my fault,
no doubt. I have thought sometimes that you didn't
quite despise me, but I was a fool to think so. Every
one must, who has seen the life I have led-you most of
all. God bless you!"
He was gone, actually gone. Dolly waited a little
while, thinking he would return, peeped out at the door,
looked up the street and down as well as the increasing
darkness would allow, came in again, waited a little
longer, went up-stairs humming a tune, bolted herself
in, laid her head down on her bed, and cried as if her
heart would break. And yet such natures are made up
of so many contradictions, that if Joe Willet had come
back that night, next day, next week, next month, the
odds are a hundred to one she would have treated him
in the very same manner, and have wept for it after-
wards with the very same distress.
She had no sooner left the workshop than there cau-
tiously peered out from behind the chimney of the forge
a face which had already emerged from the same con-
cealment twice or thrice unseen, and which, after satis-
fying itself that it was now alone, was followed by a
leg, a shoulder, and so on by degrees until the form of
Mr. Tappertit stood confessed, with a brown paper cap
stuck negligently on one side of its head, and its arms
very much a-kimbo.
• Have my ears deceived me,” said the 'Prentice, or
do I dream? Am I to thank thee, Fortun', or to cuss
thee-which ?”
He gravely descended from his elevation, took down
his piece of looking-glass, planted it against the wall
upon the usual bench, twisted his head round, and looked
closely at his legs.
“If they're a dream,” said Sim, “let sculptures have
such wisions, and chisel 'em out when they wake.
This is reality. Sleep has no such limbs as them.
Tremble, Willet, and despair. She's mine! She's
mine!”
With these triumphant expressions he seized a ham-
mer and dealt a heavy blow at a vice, which in his
mind's eye represented the sconce or head of Joseph
Willet. That done, he burst into a peal of laughter
which startled Miss Miggs even in her distant kitchen,
and dipping his head into a bowl of water, had recourse

to a jack-towel inside the closet door, which served the
· double purpose of smothering his feelings and drying his
face.
Joe, disconsolate and down-hearted, but full of
courage too, on leaving the locksmith's house, made the
best of his way to the Crooked Billet, and there inquired
for his friend the sergeant, who, expecting no man less,
received him with open arms. In the course of five
minutes after his arrival at that house of entertainment
he was enrolled among the gallant defenders of his
native land, and within half an hour was regaled with
a steaming supper of boiled tripe and onions, prepared,
as his friend assured him more than once, at the ex-
press command of his most Sacred Majesty the King.
To this meal, which tasted very savoury after his long
fasting, he did ample justice; and when he had fol-
lowed it up, or down, with a variety of loyal and patriotic
toasts, he was conducted to a straw mattrass in a loft
over the stable, and locked in there for the night.
The next morning he found that the obliging care of
his martial friend had decorated his hat with sundry
parti-coloured streamers, which made a very lively
appearance ; and in company with that officer and
three other military gentlemen newly enrolled, who
were under a cloud so dense that it only left three shoes,
a boot, and a coat and a half visible among them, re-
paired to the river-side. Here they were joined by a
corporal and four more heroes, of whom two were drunk
and daring and two sober and penitent, but each of
whom, like Joe, had his dusty stick and bundle. The party
embarked in a passage-boat bound for Gravesend,
whence they were to proceed on foot to Chatham; the
wind was in their favour, and they soon left London
behind them, a mere dark mist-a giant phantom in the
air.

CHAPTER XXXII.
MISFORTUNES, saith the adage, never come singly.
There is little doubt that troubles are exceedingly gre-
garious in their nature, and flying in flocks, are apt to
perch capriciously; crowding on the heads of some poor
wights until there is not an inch of room left on their
unlucky crowns, and taking no more notice of others
who offer as good resting-places for the soles of their
feet than if they had no existence. It may have
happened that a flight of troubles brooding over London,
and looking out for Joseph Willet, whom they couldn't
find, darted down hap-hazard on the first young man
that caught their fancy, and settled on him instead.
However this may be, certain it is that on the day of
Joe's departure they swarmed about the ears of Edward
Chester, and did so buzz and flap their wings, and per-
secute him, that he was most profoundly wretched.
It was evening, and just eight o'clock, when he and
his father, having wine and dessert set before them,
were left to themselves for the first time that day.
They had dined together, but a third person had been
present during the meal, and until they met at the
table they had not seen each other since the previous
night.
Edward was reserved and silent, Mr. Chester was
more than usually gay; but not caring, as it seemed, to
open a conversation with one whose humour was so dif-
ferent, he vented the lightness of his spirit in smiles and
sparkling looks, and made no effort to awaken his at-
tention. So they remained for some time: the father
lying on a sofa with his accustomed air of graceful neg-
ligence; the son seated opposite to him with downcast
eyes, busied, it was plain, with painful and uneasy
thoughts.
“My dear Edward,” said Mr. Chester, at length, with
a most engaging laugh, “ do not extend your drowsy
influence to the decanter. Suffer that to circulate, let
you spirits be never so stagnant.”
Edward begged his pardon, passed it, and relapsed into
his former state.

“You do wrong not to fill your glass,” said Mr. Ches-
ter, holding up his own before the light. “ Wine in
moderation-not in excess, for that makes men ugly-
has a thousand pleasant influences. It brightens the
eye, improves the voice, imparts a new vivacity to
one's thoughts and conversation: you should try it,
Ned.”
“Ah, father!” cried his son, “if—"
“My good fellow,” interposed the parent, hastily, as he
set down his glass, and raised his eyebrows with a
startled and horrified expression, “ for Heaven's sake
don't call me by that obsolete and ancient name. Have
some regard for delicacy. Am I grey, or wrinkled, do I
go on crutches, have I lost my teeth, that you adopt
such a mode of address? Good God, how very coarse!"
"I was about to speak to you from my heart, sir,” re-
turned Edward, “in the confidence which should sub-
sist between us; and you check me in the outset.”
“Now do, Ned, do not,” said Mr. Chester, raising his
delicate hand imploringly,“ talk in that monstrous man-
ner. About to speak from your heart. Don't you know
that the heart is an ingenious part of our formation-
the centre of the blood vessels and all that sort of thing
-which has no more to do with what you say or think
than your knees have? How can you be so very vul-
gar and absurd? These anatomical allusions should be
left to gentlemen of the medical profession. They are
really not agreeable in society. You quite surprise me,
Ned.”
“Well! there are no such things to wound, or heal,
or have regard for. I know your creed, sir, and will say
no more," returned his son."
“There again,” said Mr. Chester, sipping his wine,
“you are wrong. I distinctly say there are such things.
We know there are. The hearts of animals—of bul-
locks, sheep, and so forth-are cooked and devoured, as
I am told, by the lower classes, with a vast deal of
relish, Men are sometimes stabbed to the heart, shot to
the heart, but as to speaking from the heart, or to the
heart, or being warm-hearted, or cold-hearted, or broken-
hearted, or being all heart, or having no heart-pah!
these things are nonsense, Ned.”
“No doubt, sir,” returned his son, seeing that he
paused for him to speak. “No doubt.”

“ There's Haredale's niece, your late flame,” said Mr.
Chester, as a careless illustration of his meaning. “No
doubt in your mind she was all heart once. Now she
has none at all. Yet she is the same person, Ned,
exactly.”
“She is a changed person, sir,” cried Edward, redden-
ing, “and changed by vile means, I believe.”
You have had a cool dismissal, have you?” said
his father. “Poor Ned! I told you last night what
would happen. May I ask you for the nut-crack-
ers?”
“She has been tampered with, and most treacherously
deceived,” cried Edward, rising from his seat. "I never
will believe that the knowledge of my real position,
given her by myself, has worked this change. I know
she is beset and tortured. But though our contract is
at an end, and broken past all redemption; though I
charge upon her want of firmness and want of truth,
both to herself and me; I do not now, and never will
believe, that any sordid motive, or her own unbiased
will, has led her to this course-never!”
“You make me blush,” returned his father gaily,
“for the folly of your nature, in which-but we never
know ourselves—I devoutly hope there is no reflection
of my own. With regard to the young lady herself, she
has done what is very natural and proper, my dear
fellow; what you yourself proposed, as I learn from
Haredale; and what I predicted-with no great exercise
of sagacity--she would do. She supposed you to be rich,
or at least quite rich enough; and found you poor.
Marriage is a civil contract; people marry to better their
worldly condition and improve appearances; it is an
affair of house and furniture, of liveries, servants, equip-
age, and so forth. The lady being poor and you poor
also, there is an end of the matter. You cannot enter
upon these considerations, and have no manner of busi-
ness with the ceremony. I drink her health in this
glass, and respect and honour her for her extreme good
sense. It is a lesson to you. Fill yours, Ned.”
“It is a lesson,” returned his son, “ by which I hope I

spoiled,” said Edward, warmly, “Heaven keep me from
its knowledge.”
“Come, sir," returned his father, raising himself a
little on the sofa, and looking straight towards him;
“we have had enough of this. Remember, if you please,
your interest, your duty, your moral obligations, your
filial affections, and all that sort of thing which is so
very delightful and charming to reflect upon, or you will
repent it."
· * I shall never repent the preservation of my self-re-
spect, sir,” said Edward. “Forgive me if I say that I
will not sacrifice it at your bidding, and that I will not
pursue the track which you would have me take, and to
which the secret share you have had in this late separa-
tion tends."
His father rose a little higher still, and looking at him
as though curious to know if he were quite resolved and
earnest, dropped gently down again, and said in the
calmest voice-eating his nuts meanwhile:
“Edward, my father had a son, who being a fool like
you, and, like you, entertaining low and disobedient
sentiments, he disinherited and cursed one morning
after breakfast. The circumstances occur to me with a
singular clearness of recollection this evening. I re-
member eating muffins at the time, with marmalade.
He led a miserable life (the son, I mean), and died
early; it was a happy release on all accounts; he de-
graded the family very much. It is a sad circumstance,
Edward, when a father finds it necessary to resort to
such strong measures.”
“It is,” replied Edward, “and it is sad when a son,
proffering him his love and duty in their best and truest
sense, finds himself repelled at every turn, and forced
to disobey. Dear father,” he added, more earnestly,
though in a gentler tone, “I have reflected many times
on what occurred between us when we first discussed
this subject. Let there be confidence between us; not
in terms, but truth. Hear what I have to say."
“As I anticipate what it is, and cannot fail to do so,
Edward,” returned his father, coldly, “I decline. I
couldn't possibly. I am sure it would put me out of
temper, which is a state of mind I cannot endure. If
you intend to mar my plans for your establishment in
life, and the preservation of that gentility and becoming

pride which our family have so long sustained-if, in
short, you are resolved to take your own course, you
must take it, and my curse with it. I am very sorry,
but there's really no alternative.”
“The curse may pass your lips,” said Edward, “but it
will be but empty breath. I do not believe that any man
on earth has greater power to call one down upon his
fellow-least of all, upon his own child-than he has to
make one drop of rain or flake of snow fall from the
clouds above us at his impious bidding. Beware, sir,
what you do."
“You are so very irreligious, so exceedingly undutiful,
so horribly profane,” rejoined his father, turning his
face lazily towards him, and cracking another nut,
“that I positively must interrupt you here. It is quite
impossible we can continue to go on upon such terms as
these. If you will do me the favour to ring the bell, the
servant will show you to the door. Return to this roof
no more, I beg you. Go, sir, since you have no moral
sense remaining, and go to the devil, at my express
desire. Good-day.”
Edward left the room without another word or look,
and turned his back upon the house forever.
The father's face was slightly flushed and heated, but
his manner was quite unchanged, as he rang the bell
again, and addressed his servant on his entrance.
“Peak, if that gentleman who has just gone out”.
“I beg your pardon, sir, Mr. Edward?”
“ Were there more than one, dolt, that you ask the
question? If that gentleman should send here for his
wardrobe, let him have it, do you hear? If he should
call himself at any time, I'm not at home. You'll tell
him so, and shut the door.
So it soon got whispered about that Mr. Chester was
very unfortunate in his son, who had occasioned him
great grief and sorrow. And the good people who heard
this and told it again, marvelled the more at his equa-
nimity and even temper, and said what an amiable nature
that man must have, who, having undergone so much,
could be so placid and so calm. And when Edward's
name was spoken, Society shook its head and laid its
finger on its lip and sighed, and looked very grave;
and those who had sons about his age waxed wrathful
and indignant, and hoped, for Virtue's sake, that he was

dead. And the world went on turning round as usual
for five years, concerning which this Narrative is silent.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
ONE wintry evening, early in the year of our Lord one
thousand seven hundred and eighty, a keen north wind
arose as it grew dark, and night came on with black
and dismal looks. A bitter storm of sleet, sharp, dense,
and icy-cold, swept the wet streets, and rattled on the
trembling windows. Sign-boards, shaken past endur-
ance in their creaking frames, fell crashing on the pave-
ment; old tottering chimneys reeled and staggered in
the blast; and many a steeple rocked again that night,
as though the earth were troubled.
It was not a time for those who could by any means
get light and warmth to brave the fury of the weather.
In coffee-houses of the better sort, guests crowded round
the fire, forgot to be political, and told each other with a
secret gladness that the blast grew fiercer every minute.
Each humble tavern by the water-side had its group of
uncouth figures round the hearth; who talked of vessels
foundering at sea, and all hands lost, related many a
dismal tale of shipwreck and drowned men, and hoped
that some they knew were safe, and shook their heads
in doubt. In private dwellings, children clustered near
the blaze; listening with timid pleasure to the tales of
ghosts and goblins and tall figures clad in white stand-
ing by bedsides, and people who had gone to sleep in old
churches and being overlooked had found themselves
alone there at the dead hour of the night: until they
shuddered at the thought of the dark rooms up-stairs,
yet loved to hear the wind moan too, and hoped it would
continue bravely. From time to time these happy in-
door people stopped to listen, or one held up his finger
and cried “Hark!” and then, above the rumbling in the
chimney, and the fast pattering on the glass, was heard
a wailing, rushing sound, which shook the walls as
though a giant's hand were on them; then a hoarse roar
as if the sea had risen, then such a whirl and tumult
that the air seemed mad; and then, with a lengthened

inuby, glowint that evening abroad to see
howl, the waves of wind swept on, and left a moment's
interval of rest.
Cheerily, though there were none abroad to see it,
shone the Maypole light that evening. Blessings on the
red-deep, ruby, glowing red-old curtain of the win-
dow; blending into one rich stream of brightness, fire
and candle, meat, drink, and company, and gleaming
like a jovial eye upon the bleak waste out of doors!
Within, what carpet like its crunching sand, what music
merry as its crackling logs, what perfume like its
kitchen's dainty breath, what weather genial as its hearty
warmth! Blessings on the old house, how sturdily it
stood! How did the vexed wind chafe and roar about
its stalwart roof; how did it pant and strive with its
wide chimneys, which still poured forth from their
hospitable throats great clouds of smoke, and puffed
defiance in its face; how, above all, did it drive and
rattle at the casement, emulous to extinguish that cheer-
ful glow, which would not be put down and seemed the
brighter for the conflict.
The profusion, too, the rich and lavish bounty of that
goodly tavern! It was not enough that one fire roared
and sparkled on its spacious hearth; in the tiles which
paved and compassed it five hundred flickering fires
burnt brightly also. It was not enough that one red
curtain shut the wild night out, and shed its cheerful
influence on the room. In every saucepan lid, and
candlestick, and vessel of copper, brass, or tin that
hung upon the walls, were countless ruddy hangings,
flashing and gleaming with every motion of the blaze,
and offering, let the eye wander where it might, in-
terminable vistas of the same rich colour. The old oak
wainscoting, the beams, the chairs, the seats, reflected
it in a deep dull glimmer. There were fires and red cur-
tains in the very eyes of the drinkers, in their buttons,
in their liquor, in the pipes they smoked.
Mr. Willet sat in what had been his accustomed place
five years before, with his eyes on the eternal boiler;
and had sat there since the clock struck eight, giving no
other signs of life than breathing with a loud and con-
stant snore (though he was wide awake), and from time
to time puttting his glass to his lips, or knocking the
ashes out of his pipe and filling it anew. It was now
half-past ten. Mr. Çobb and long Phil Parkęs were his

companions, as of old, and for two mortal hours and a
half none of the company had pronounced one word.
Whether people, by dint of sitting together in the same
place and the same relative positions, and doing exactly
the same things for a great many years, acquire a sixth
sense, or some unknown power of influencing each other
which serves them in its stead, is a question for philos-
ophy to settle. But certain it is that old John Willet,
Mr. Parkes, and Mr. Cobb, were one and all firmly of
opinion that they were very jolly companions—rather
choice spirits than otherwise; that they looked at each
other every now and then as if there were a perpetual
interchange of ideas going on among them; that no man
considered himself or his neighbour by any means silent;
and that each of them nodded occasionally when he
caught the eye of another, as if he would say, “You
have expressed yourself extremely well, sir, in relation
to that sentiment, and I quite agree with you.”
The room was so very warm, the tobacco so very good,
and the fire so very soothing, that Mr. Willet by degrees
began to dose; but as he had perfectly acquired, by dint
of long habit, the art of smoking in his sleep, and as his
breathing was pretty much the same, awake or asleep,
saving that in the latter case he sometimes experienced
a slight difficulty in respiration (such as a carpenter
meets with when he is planing and comes to a knot),
neither of his companions was aware of the circum-
stance, until he met with one of these impediments and
was obliged to try again.
“Johnny's dropped off,” said Mr. Parkes in a whisper.
“Fast as a top," said Mr. Cobb.
Neither of them said any more until Mr. Willet came
to another knot-one of surpassing obduracy—which
bade fair to throw him into convulsions, but which he
got over at last without waking by an effort quite su-
perhuman.
“He sleeps uncommon hard,” said Mr. Cobb.
Mr. Parkes, who was possibly a hard sleeper himself,
replied with some disdain “Not a bit on it;" and directed
his eyes towards a handbill pasted over the chimney-
piece, which was decorated at the top with a wood-cut
representing a youth of tender years running away very
fast, with a bundle over his shoulder at the end of a stick,
and—to carry out the idea—a finger-post and a mile stone

beside him. Mr. Cobb likewise turned his eyes in the
same direction and surveyed the placard as if it were :
the first time he had ever beheld it. Now, this was a
document which Mr. Willet had himself indited on the
disappearance of his son Joseph, acquainting the no-
bility and gentry and the public in general with the cir-
cumstances of his having left his home; describing his
dress and appearance; and offering a reward of five
pounds to any person or persons who would pack him
up and return him safely to the Maypole at Chigwell, or
lodge him in any of his Majesty's jails until such time
as his father should come and claim him. In this ad-
vertisement Mr. Willet had obstinately persisted, despite
the advice and entreaties of his friends, in describing his
son as a “young boy;" and furthermore as being from
eighteen inches to a couple of feet shorter than he really
was; two circumstances which perhaps accounted, in
some degree, for its never having been productive of
any other effect than the transmission to Chigwell at
various times, and at a vast expense, of some five-and-
forty runaways varying from six years old to twelve.
Mr. Cobb and Mr. Parkes looked mysteriously at this
composition, at each other, and at old John. From the
time he had pasted it up with his own hands, Mr. Willet
had never by word or sign alluded to the subject, or en-
couraged any one else to do so. Nobody had the least
notion what his thoughts or opinions were connected
with it; whether he remembered it or forgot it; whether
he had any idea that such an event had ever taken
place. Therefore, even while he slept, no one ventured
to refer to it in his presence; and for such sufficient
reasons these his chosen friends were silent now.
Mr. Willet had got by this time into such a complica-
tion of knots, that it was perfectly clear he must wake
or die. He chose the former alternative, and opened his
eyes.
“ If he don't come in five minutes,” said John, “I shall
have supper without him.”
The antecedent of this pronoun had been mentioned
for the last time at eight o'clock. Messrs. Parkes and
Cobb being used to this style of conversation, replied
without difficulty that to be sure Solomon was very late,
and they wondered what had happened to detain him.
“He an't blown away, I suppose,” said Parkes, “It's

enough to carry a man of his figure off his legs, and easy
. too. Do you hear it? It blows great guns, indeed.
There'll be many a crash in the Forest to-night, I reckon,
and many a broken branch upon the ground to-morrow.”
“It won't break anything in the Maypole, I take it,
sir,” returned old John. “Let it try. I give it leave-
what's that.”
“ The wind,” cried Parkes. “It's howling like a Chris-
tian, and has been all night long."
“Did you ever, sir,” asked John, after a minute's con-
templation, “hear the wind say “Maypole?'”
“Why, what man ever did?" said Parkes.
“Norahoy, perhaps,” added John.
“No. Nor that neither.”
“Very good, sir,” said Mr. Willet, perfectly unmoved;
“then if that was the wind just now, and you'll wait a
little time without speaking, you'll hear it say both
both words very plain.”
Mr. Willet was right. After listening for a few mo-
ments, they could clearly hear, above the roar and tumult
out of doors, this shout repeated; and that with a
shrillness and energy which denoted that it came from
some person in great distress or terror. They looked at
each other, turned pale, and held their breath. No man
stirred.
It was in this emergency that Mr. Willet displayed
something of that strength of mind and plentitude of
mental resource which rendered him the admiration of
all his friends and neighbours. After looking at Messrs.
Parkes and Cobb for some time in silence, ho clapped his
two hands to his cheeks, and sent forth a roar which
made the glasses dance and rafters ring-a long-sus-
tained, discordant bellow, that rolled onward with the
wind, and startling every echo, made the night a hun-
dred times more boisterous-a deep, loud, dismal bray,
that sounded like a human gong. Then, with every vein
in his head and face swollen with the great exertion, and
his countenance suffused with a lively purple, he drew a
little nearer to the fire, and turning his back upon it,
said with dignity:
“If that's any comfort to anybody, they're welcome to
it. If it an't, I'm sorry for 'em. If either of you two
gentlemen likes to go out and see what's the matter, you
can. I'm not curious, myself,”

While he spoke the cry drew nearer and nearer, foot-
steps passed the window, the latch of the door was
raised, it opened, was violently shut again, and Solomon
Daisy, with a lighted lantern in his hand, and the rain
streaming from his disordered dress, dashed into the
room.
A more complete picture of terror than the little man
presented it would be difficult to imagine. The pers-
piration stood in beads upon his face, his knees knocked
together, his every limb trembled, the power of articula-
tion was quite gone; and there he stood, panting for
breath, gazing on them with such livid, ashy looks, that
they were infected with his fear, though ignorant of its
occasion, and, reflecting his dismayed and horror-
stricken visage, stared back again without venturing
to question him; until John Willet, in a fit of tem-
porary insanity, made a dive at his cravat, and, seizing
him by that portion of his dress, shook him to and fro
until his very teeth appeared to rattle in his head.
“Tell us what's the matter, sir,” said John, “ or I'll
kill you. Tell us what's the matter, sir, or in another
second I'll have your head under the biler. How dare
you look like that? Is anybody a following of you?
What do you mean? Say something, or I'll be the death
of you, I will.”
Mr. Willet, in his frenzy, was so near keeping his
word to the very letter (Solomon Daisy's eyes already
beginning to roll in an alarming manner, and certain
guttural sounds, as of a choking man, to issue from his
throat), that the two bystanders, recovering in some de-
gree, plucked him off his victim by main force, and
placed the little clerk of Chigwell in a chair. Direct-
ing a fearful gaze all round the room, he implored them
in a faint voice to give him some drink; and above all
to lock the house-door and close and bar the shutters of
the room, without a moment's loss of time. The latter
request did not tend to reassure his hearers, or to fill
them with the most comfortable sensations; they com-
plied with it, however, with the greatest expedition; and
having handed him a bumper of brandy and water, nearly
boiling hot, waited to hear what he might have to tell
them.
“Oh, Johnny,” said Solomon, shaking him by the
hand. “Oh, Parkes. Oh, Tommy Cobb. Why did I

leave this house to-night! On the nineteenth of March
-of all nights in the year, on the nineteenth of March!"
They all drew closer to the fire. Parkes, who was
nearest to the door, started and looked over his shoulder.
Mr. Willet, with great indignation, inquired what the
devil he meant by that-and then said “God forgive
me,” and glanced over his own shoulder, and came a
little nearer.
“When I left here to-night,” said Solomon Daisy, “I
little thought what day of the month it was. I have
never gone alone into the church after dark on this
day for seven-and-twenty years. I have heard it said
that as we keep our birthdays when we are alive, so
the ghosts of dead people, who are not easy in their
graves, keep the day they died upon. How the wind
roars!”
Nobody spoke. All eyes were fastened on Solomon.
“I might have known,” he said, “what night it was
by the foul weather. There's no such night in the whole
year round as this is always. I never sleep quietly in
my bed on the nineteenth of March.”
“Go on,” said Tom Cobb, in a low voice. “Nor I
neither.”
Solomon Daisy raised his glass to his lips; put it down
upon the floor with such a trembling hand that the
spoun tinkled in it like a little bell; and continued thus:
“Have I ever said that we were always brought back
to this subject in some strange way, when the nineteenth
of this month comès round? Do you suppose it was by
accident I forgot to wind up the church-clock? I never
forgot it at any other time, though it's such a clumsy
thing that it has to be wound up every day. Why should
it escape my memory on this day of all others?
“I made as much haste down there as I could when I
went from here, but I had to go home first for the keys,
and the wind and rain being dead against me all the
way, it was pretty well as much as I could do at times
to keep my legs. I got there at last, opened the church-
door and went in. I had not met a soul all the way,
and you may judge whether it was dull or not. Neither
of you would bear me company. If you could have
known what was to come, you'd have been in the right.
“The wind was so strong that it was as much as I
could do to shut the church-door by putting my whole

265
weight against it; and, even as it was, it burst wide
open twice, with such strength that any of you would
have sworn, if you had been leaning against it as I was,
that somebody was pushing on the other side. However,
I got the key turned, went into the belfry, and wound
up the clock—which was very near run down, and would
have stood stock-still in half an hour.
“As I took up my lantern again to leave the church,
it came upon me all at once that this was the nineteenth
of March. It came upon me with a kind of shock, as if
a hand had struck the thought upon my forehead; at the
very same moment I heard a voice outside the tower-
rising from among the graves.”
Here old John precipitately interrupted the speaker,
and begged that if Mr. Parkes (who was seated opposite
to him and was staring directly over his head) saw any-
thing he would have the goodness to mention it. Mr.
Parkes apologised, and remarked that he was only lis-
tening; to which Mr. Willet angrily retorted that his
listening with that kind of expression in his face was
not agreeable, and that if he couldn't look like other
people he had better put his pocket-handkerchief over his
head. Mr. Parkes with great submission pledged him-
self to do so, if again required, and John Willet turning
to Solomon desired him to proceed. After waiting until
a violent gust of wind and rain, which seemed to shake
even that sturdy house to its foundation, had passed
away, the little man complied:
“Never tell me that it was my fancy, or that it was
any other sound which I miştook for that I tell you of.
I heard the wind whistle through the arches of the
church. I heard the steeple strain and creak. I heard
the rain as it came driving against the walls. I felt the
bells shake. I saw the ropes sway to and fro. And I
heard that voice.”
“What did it say?" asked Tom Cobb.
“I don't know what. I don't know that it spoke. It
gave a kind of cry, as any one of us might do, if some-
thing dreadful followed us in a dream, and came upon
us unawares; and then it died off, seeming to pass quite
round the church.”
“I don't see much in that,” said John, drawing a long
breath, and looking round him like a man who felt re-
lieved.

266
BARNABY RUDGE.
“Perhaps not,” returned his friend, “but that's not
all.”
“What more do you mean to say, sir, is to come?”
asked John, pausing in the act of wiping his face upon
his apron. “What are you a going to tell us of next?”
" What I saw.”
“Saw!" echoed all three, bending forward.
“When I opened the church-door to come out,” said
the little man, with an expression of face which bore
ample testimony to the sincerity of his conviction,
“ when I opened the church-door to come out, which I
did suddenly, for I wanted to get it shut again before
another gust of wind came up, there crossed me—so
close that by stretching out my finger I could have
touched it-something in the likeness of a man. It was
bare-headed to the storm. It turned its face without
stopping and fixed its eyes on mine. It was a ghost-a
spirit.”
“Whose?” they all three cried together.
In the excess of his emotion (for he fell back trembling
in his chair, and waved his hand as if entreating them to
question him no further) his answer was lost on all but
old John Willet, who happened to be seated close beside
him.
“Who?” cried Parkes and Tom Cobb, looking eagerly
by turns at Solomon Daisy and Mr. Willet. “Who was it?"
“ Gentlemen,” said Mr. Willet, after a long pause,
“you needn't ask. The likeness of a murdered man.
This is the nineteenth of March.”
A profound silence ensued.
“If you'll take my advice,” said John, “we had better,
one and all, keep this a secret. Such tales would not
be liked at the Warren. Let us keep it to ourselves
for the present time at all events, or we may get into
trouble, and Solomon may lose his place. Whether it
was really as he says, or whether it wasn't, is no matter.
Right or wrong nobody would believe him. As to the
probabilities, I don't myself think,” said Mr. Willet,
eyeing the corners of the room in a manner which
showed that, like some other philosophers, he was not
quite easy in his theory, “that a ghost as has been a
man of sense in his lifetime would be out a-walking in
such weather-I only know that I wouldn't, if I was one."
But this heretical doctrine was strongly opposed by

BARNABY RUDGE.
267
the other three, who quoted a great many precedents to
show that bad weather was the very time for such ap-
pearances; and Mr. Parkes (who had had a ghost in his
family by the mother's side) argued the matter with so
much ingenuity and force of illustration, that John was
only saved from having to retract his opinion by the
opportune appearance of supper, to which they applied
themselves with a dreadful relish. Even Solomon Daisy
himself, by dint of the elevating influences of fire, lights,
brandy, and good company, so far recovered as to
handle his knife and fork in a highly creditable man-
ner, and to display a capacity both of eating and drink-
ing, such as banished all fear of his having sustained
any lasting injury from his fright.
Supper done, they crowded round the fire again, and,
as is common on such occasions, propounded all manner
of leading questions calculated to surround the story
with new horrors and surprises. But Solomon Daisy,
notwithstanding those temptations, adhered so steadily
to his original account, and repeated it so often, with
such slight variations, and with such solemn assevera-
tions of its truth and reality, that his hearers were (with
good reason) more astonished than at first. As he took
John Willet's view of the matter in regard to the pro-
priety of not bruiting the tale abroad, unless the spirit
should appear to him again, in which case ii would be
necessary to take immediate counsel with the clergy-
man, it was solemnly resolved that it should be hushed
up and and kept quiet. And as most men like to have
a secret to tell which may exalt their own importance,
they arrived at this conclusion with perfect unanimity.
As it was by this time growing late, and was long
past their usual hour of separating, the cronies parted
for the night. Solomon Daisy, with a fresh candle in
his lantern, repaired homewards under the escort of
long Phil Parkes and Mr. Cobb, who were rather more
nervous than himself. Mr. Willet, after seeing them to
the door, returned to collect his thoughts with the as-
sistance of the boiler, and to listen to the storm of wind
and rain, which had not yet abated one jot of its fury.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
BEFORE old John had looked at the boiler quite twenty
minutes he got his ideas into a focus, and brought them
to bear upon Solomon Daisy's story. The more he
thought of it, the more impressed he became with a
sense of his own wisdom, and a desire that Mr. Haredale
should be impressed with it likewise. At length, to the
end that he might sustain a principal and important
character in the affair, and might have the start of
Solomon and his two friends, through whose means he
knew the adventure, with a variety of exaggerations,
would be known to at least a score of people, and most
likely to Mr. Haredale himself, by breakfast-time to-
morrow, he determined to repair to the Warren before
going to bed.
“He's my landlord,” thought John, as he took a candle
in his hand, and setting it down in a corner out of the
wind's way, opened a casement in the rear of the house,
looking towards the stables. “We haven't met of late
years so often as we used to do—changes are taking
place in the family—it's desirable that I should stand as
well with them, in point of dignity, as possible-the
whispering about of this here tale will anger him-it's
good to have confidences with a gentleman of his natur',
and set one's self right besides. Halloa there! Hugh!-
Hugh. Hal-loa!”
When he had repeated this shout a dozen times, and
startled every pigeon from its slumbers, a door in one
the ruinous old buildings opened, and a rough voice de-
manded what was amiss now, that a man couldn't even
have his sleep in quiet.
“What! Haven't you sleep enough, growler, that
you're not to be knocked up for once?" said John.
“No," replied the voice, as the speaker yawned and
shook himself. “Not half enough."
“I don't know how you can sleep, with the wind a bel-
lowsing and roaring about you, making the tiles fly like
a pack of cards,” said John; “but no matter for that.
Wrap yourself up in something or another, and come

here, for you must go as far as the Warren with me.
And look sharp about it.”
Hugh, with much low growling and muttering, went
back into his lair; and presently re-appeared, carrying
a lantern and a cudgel, and enveloped from head to foot
in an old, frowsy, slouching horse-cloth. Mr. Willet
received this figure at the back door, and ushered him
into the bar, while he wrapped himself in sundry great-
coats and capes, and so tied and knotted his face in
shawls and handkerchiefs, that how he breathed was a
mystery.
"You don't take a man out of doors at near midnight
in such weather, without putting some heart into him,
do you, master?” said Hugh.
. Yes, I do, sir,” returned Mr. Willet. “I put the heart
(as you call it) into him when he has brought me safe
home again, and his standing steady on his legs an't of
so much consequence. So hold that light up, if you
please, and go on a step or two before to show the way.”
Hugh obeyed with a very indifferent grace and a long-
ing glance at the bottles. Old John, laying strict in-
junctions on the cook to keep the doors locked in his
absence, and to open to nobody but himself on pain of
dismissal, followed him into the blustering darkness out
of doors. :
The way was wet and dismal, and the night so black,
that if Mr. Willet had been his own pilot he would have
walked into a deep horsepond within a few hundred
yards of his own house, and would certainly have ter-
minated his career in that ignoble sphere of action.
But Hugh, who had a sight as keen as any hawk's, and,
apart from that endowment, could have found his way
blindfold to any place within a dozen miles, dragged
old John along, quite deaf to his remonstrances, and
took his own course without the slightest reference to,
or notice of, his master. So they made head against the
wind as they best could: Hugh crushing the wet grass
beneath his heavy tread, and stalking on after his ordi-
nary savage fashion; John Willet following at arm's
length, picking his steps, and looking about him, now
for bogs and ditches, and now for such stray ghosts as
might be wandering abroad, with looks of as much dis-
may and uneasiness as his immovable face was capable
of expressing
minds of his a deepad been hisl, and the

or thatit keep is it less
At length they stood upon the broad gravel-walk be-
fore the Warren house. The building was profoundly
dark, and none were moving near it but themselves.
From one solitary turret-chamber, however, there shone
a ray of light; and towards this speck of comfort in the
cold, cheerless, silent scene, Mr. Willet bade his pilot
lead him.
“The old room,” said John, looking timidly upwards;
“Mr. Reuben's own apartment, God be with us! Í
wonder his brother likes to sit there, so late at night,
on this night too."
“Why, where else should he sit?" asked Hugh, holding
the lantern to his breast, to keep the candle from the
wind, while he trimmed it with his fingers. “It's
snug enough, an't it ?”
“Snug !” said John, indignantly. “You have a com-
fortable idea of snugness, you have, sir. Do you know
what was done in that room, you ruffian ?”
“Why, what is it the worse for that !” cried Hugh,
looking into John's fat face. “Does it keep out the
rain, and snow, and wind, the less for that? Is it less
warm or dry, because a man was killed there? Ha, ha,
ha! Never believe it, master. One man's no such
matter as that comes to.”
Mr. Willet fixed his dull eyes on his follower, and
began–by a species of inspiration-to think it just
barely possible that he was something of a dangerous
character, and that it might be advisable to get rid of
him one of these days. He was too prudent to say any-
thing, with the journey home before him; and therefore
turned to the iron gate before which this brief dialogue
had passed, and pulled the handle of the bell that hung
beside it. The turret in which the light appeared being
at one corner of the building, and only divided from the
path by one of the garden-walks, upon which this gate
opened, Mr. Haredale threw up the window directly,
and demanded who was there.
“ Begging pardon, sir,” said John, “I knew you sat
up late, and made bold to come round, having a word to
say to you."
* Willet—is it not?”
“Of the Maypole-at your service, sir.”
Mr. Haredale closed the window and withdrew. He
presently appeared at a door in the bottom of the turret,

271
and coming across the garden-walk unlocked the gate
and let them in.
“ You are a late visitor, Willet. What is the matter?”
“Nothing to speak of, sir,” said John; “ an idle tale,
I thought you ought to know of; nothing more.”
“Let your man go forward with the lantern, and give
me your hand. The stairs are crooked and narrow.
Gently with your light, friend. You swing it like a
censer."
Hugh, who had already reached the turret, held it more
steadily, and ascended first, turning round from time to
time to shed its light downward on the steps. Mr. Hare-
dale following next, eyed his lowering face with no
great favour; and Hugh, looking down on him, returned
his glances with interest, as they climbed the winding
stair.
It terminated in a little ante-room adjoining that from
which they had seen the light. Mr. Haredale entered
first, and led the way through it into the latter chamber,
where he seated himself at a writing-table from which
he had risen when they rang the bell.
“Come in,” he said, beckoning to old John, who re-
mained bowing at the door. “Not you, friend,” he
added hastily to Hugh, who entered also. “Willet,
why do you bring that fellow here?”
“Why, sir," returned John, elevating his eyebrows,
and lowering his voice to the tone in which the question
had been asked him, “he's a good guard, you see.”
. “Don't be too sure of that,” replied Mr. Haredale,
looking towards him as he spoke. * I doubt it. He has
an evil eye.”
“There's no imagination in his eye,” returned Mr.
Willet, glancing over his shoulder at the organ in ques-
tion, “ certainly.”
“There is no good there, be assured,” said Mr. Hare-
dale. “Wait in that little room, friend, and close the
door between us.”
Hugh shrugged his shoulders, and with a disdainful
look, which showed, either that he had overheard, or
that he had guessed the purport of their whispering, did
as he was told. When he was shut out, Mr. Haredale
turned to John, and bade him go on with what he had
to say, but not to speak too loud, for there were quick
ears yonder,

BARNABY RUDGE.
Thus cautioned, Mr. Willet, in an oily whisper, recited
all that he had heard and said that night; laying par-
ticular stress upon his own sagacity, upon his great re-
gard for the family, and upon his solicitude for their
peace of mind and happiness. The story moved his au-
ditor much more than he had expected. Mr. Haredale
often changed his attitude, rose and paced the room,
returned again, desired him to repeat, as nearly as he
could, the very words that Solomon had used; and gave
so many other signs of being disturbed, and ill at ease,
that even Mr. Willet was surprised.
“You did quite right,” he said, at the end of a long
conversation,“ to bid them keep this story secret. It is
a foolish fancy on the part of this weak-brained man,
bred in his fears and superstition. But Miss Haredale,
though she would know it to be so, would be disturbed
by it if it reached her ears; it is too nearly connected
with a subject very painful to us all, to be heard
with indifference. You were most prudent, and have
laid me under a great obligation. I thank you very
much.”
This was equal to John's most sanguine expectations;
but he would have preferred Mr. Haredale's looking at
him when he spoke, as if he really did thank him, to his
walking up and down, speaking by fits and starts, often
stopping with his eyes fixed on the ground, moving
hurriedly on again, like one distracted, and seeming
almost unconscious of what he said or did.
This, however, was his manner; and it was so em-:
barrassing to John that he sat quite passive for a long
time, not knowing what to do. At length he rose. Mr.
Haredale stared at him for a moment as though he had
quite forgotten his being present, then shook hands with
him and opened the door. Hugh, who was, or feigned
to be, fast asleep on the ante-chamber floor, sprang up
on their entrance, and throwing his cloak about him,
grasped his stick and lantern, and prepared to descend
the stairs.
“Stay,” said Mr. Haredale. “Will this man drink ?"
“Drink! He'd drink the Thames up, if it was strong
enough, sir,” replied John Willet. “He'll have some-
thing when he gets home. He's better without it, now,
sir.”
“Nay. Half the distance is done,” said Hugh. “What

273
a hard master you are! I shall go home the better for
one glassful, half-way. Come!”
As John made no reply, Mr. Haredale brought out a
glass of liquor, and gave it to Hugh, who, as he took it
in his hand, threw part of it upon the floor.
“What do you mean by splashing your drink about a
gentleman's house, sir?” said John.
“ I'm drinking a toast,” Hugh rejoined, holding the
glass above his head, and fixing his eyes on Mr. Hare-
dale's face, "a toast to this house and its master."
With that he muttered something to himself, and drank
the rest, and setting down the glass, preceded them
without another word.
John was a good deal scandalised by this observance,
but seeing that Mr. Haredale took little heed of what
Hugh said or did, and that his thoughts were otherwise
employed, he offered no apology, and went in silence
down the stairs, across the walk, and through the garden-
gate. They stopped upon the outer side for Hugh to
hold the light while Mr. Haredale locked it on the inner;
and then John saw with wonder (as he often afterwards
related), that he was very pale, and that his face had
changed so much and grown so haggard since their
entrance, that he almost seemed another man.
They were in the open road again, and John Willet
was walking on behind his escort, as he had come, think-
ing very steadily of what he had just now seen, when
Hugh drew him suddenly aside, and almost at the same
instant three horsemen swept past—the nearest brushed
his shoulder even then—who, checking their steeds as
suddenly as they could, stood still and waited for their
coming up.

CHAPTER XXXV.
WHEN John Willet saw that the horecmen wheeled
smartly round, and drew up three ? www in the narrow
road, waiting for him and his man to join them, it oc-
curred to him with unusual precipitation that they must
be highwaymen; and had Hugh been armed with a
blunderbuss, in place of his stout cudgel, he would cer-
tainly have ordered him to fire it off at a venture, and
would, while the word of command was obeyed, have
consulted his own personal safety in immediate flight.
Under the circumstances of disadvantage, however, in
which he and his guard were placed, he deemed it pru-
dent to adopt a different style of generalship, and there-
fore whispered his attendant to address them in the most
peaceable and courteous terms. By way of acting up
to the spirit and letter of this instruction, Hugh stepped
forward, and flourishing his staff before the very eyes of
the rider nearest to him, demanded roughly what he and
his fellows meant by so nearly galloping over them, and
why they scoured the king's highway at that late hour
of night.
The man whom he addressed was beginning an angry
reply in the same strain, when he was checked by the
horseman in the centre, who, interposing with an air of
authority, inquired in a somewhat loud but not harsh or
unpleasant voice:
** Pray, is this the London road?”
“If you follow it right, it is,” replied Hugh, roughly,
“Nay, brother,” said the same person, “you're but a
curlish Englishman, if Englishman you be—which I
should much doubt but for your tongue. Your com-
panion, I am sure, will answer me more civilly. How
say you, friend?”
I say it is the London road, sir,” answered John.
“And I wish,” he added in a subdued voice, as he turned
to Hugh, “that you was in any other road, you vaga-
bond. Are you tired of your life, sir, that you go a try-
ing to provoke three great neck-or-nothing chaps, that
could keep on running over us, back’ards and for’ards,

till we was dead and then take our bodies up behind’em
and drown us ten miles off?”
“How far is it to London?" inquired the same speaker.
“Why, from here, sir,” answered John, persuasively,
“it's thirteen very easy mile.”
The adjective was thrown in as an inducement to the
travellers to ride away with all speed; but, instead of
having the desired effect, it elicited from the same per-
son the remark, “ Thirteen miles! That's a long dis-
tance!" which was followed by a short pause of inde-
cision.
“Pray," said the gentleman, “are there any inns here-
abouts?"
At the word “inns,” John plucked up his spirit in a
surprising manner; his fears rolled off like smoke; all the
landlord stirred within him.
“ There are no inns,” rejoined Mr. Willet, with a strong
emphasis on the plural number; “but there's a Inn-
one Inn—the Maypole Inn. That's a Inn indeed. You
won't see the like of that Inn often.”
“You keep it, perhaps?” said the horseman, smiling.
“I do, sir, replied John, greatly wondering how he
had found this out.
“And how far is the Maypole from here?”
“About a mile”-John was going to add it was the
easiest mile in all the world, when the third rider, who
had hitherto kept a little in the rear, suddenly inter-
posed:
“And have you one excellent bed, landlord? Hem?
A bed that you can recommend a bed that you are
sure is well aired—a bed that has been slept in by some
perfectly respectable and unexceptionable person!"
"We don't take in no tagrag and bobtail at our
house, sir," answered John. “And as to the bed it-
self_1
“Say, as to three beds,” interposed the gentleman who
had spoken before; “ for we shall want three if we stay,
though my friend only speaks of one.”
“No, no, my lord; you are too good, you are too kind;
but your life is of far too much importance to the nation
in these portentous times to be placed upon a level with
one so useless and so poor as mine. A great cause, my
lord, a mighty cause depends on you. You are its leader
and its champion, its advanced guard and its van. It

is the cause of our altars and our homes, our country
and our faith. Let me sleep on a chair—the carpet-
anywhere. No one will repine if I take cold or fever.
Let John Grueby pass the night beneath the open sky-no
one will repine for him. But forty thousand men of this
our island in the wave (exclusive of women and child-
ren) rivet their eyes and thoughts on Lord George Gor-
don; and every day, from the rising up of the sun to the
going down of the same, pray for his health and vigour.
My lord,” said the speaker, rising in his stirrups, " it is
a glorious cause, and must not be forgotten. My lord,
it is a mighty cause, and must not be endangered. My
lord, it is a holy cause, and must not be deserted.”
“It is a holy cause,” exclaimed his lordship, lifting
up his hat with great solemnity. “Amen!"
“John Grueby," said the long-winded gentleman in
a tone of mild reproof, “his lordship said Amen.”
“I heard my lord, sir,” said the man, sitting like a
statue on his horse.
“ And do not you say Amen, likewise?”
To which John Grueby made no reply at all, but sat
looking straight before him.
“You surprise me, Grueby,” said the gentleman.
“ At a crisis like the present, when Queen Elizabeth,
that maiden monarch, weeps within her tomb, and
Bloody Mary, with a brow of gloom and shadow, stalks
triumphants
“Oh, sir,” cried the man, gruffly, “where's the use
of talking of Bloody Mary, under such circumstances
as the present, when my lord's wet through and tired
with hard riding? Let's either go on to London, sir, or
put up at once; or that unfortunate Bloody Mary will
have more to answer for—and she's done a deal more
harm in her grave than she ever did in her lifetime, I
believe."
By this time Mr. Willet, who had never heard so
many words spoken together at one time, or delivered
with such volubility and emphasis as by the long-winded
gentleman; and whose brain, being wholly unable to
sustain or compass them, had quite given itself up for
lost; recovered so far as to observe that there was
ample accommodation at the Maypole for all the party:
good beds; neat wines; excellent entertainment for man
and beast; private rooms for large or small parties;

dinners dressed upon the shortest notice; choice sta-
bling, and a lock-up coach-house; and, in short, to run
over such recommendatory scraps of language as were
painted up on various portions of the building, and
which, in the course of some forty years, he had learnt
to repeat with tolerable correctness. He was consider-
ing whether it was at all possible to insert any novel
sentences to the same purpose, when the gentleman who
had spoken first, turning to him of the long wind, ex-
claimed, “ What say you, Gashford? Shall we tarry at
this house he speaks of, or press forward? You shall
decide."
“I would submit, my lord, then,” returned the person
he appealed to, in a silky tone, “that your health and
spirits-so important, under Providence, to our great
cause, our pure and truthful cause”—here his lordship
pulled off his hat again, though it was raining hard-
* require refreshment and repose.”
“Go on before, landlord, and show the way,” said
Lord George Gordon; “we will follow at a footpace.”
“If you'll give me leave, my lord,” said John Grueby,
in a low voice, “I'll change my proper place, and ride
before you. The looks of the landlord's friend are not
over honest, and it may be as well to be cautious with
him.”
“John Grueby is quite right," interposed Mr. Gash-
ford, falling back hastily. “My lord, a life so precious
as yours must not be put in peril. Go forward, John,
by all means. If you have any reason to suspect the
fellow, blow his brains out.”
John made no answer, but looking straight before
him, as his custom seemed to be when the secretary
spoke, bade Hugh push on, and followed close behind
him. Then came his lordship, with Mr. Willet at his
bridle rein; and, last of all, his lordship's secretary-
for that, it seemed, was Gashford's office.
Hugh strode briskly on, often looking back at the
servant, whose horse was close upon his heels, and
glancing with a leer at his holster case of pistols, by
which he seemed to set great store. He was a square-
built, strong-made, bull-necked fellow, of the true
English breed; and as Hugh measured him with his eye,
he measured Hugh, regarding him meanwhile with a
look of bluff disdain. He was much older than the

Maypole man, being to all appearance five-and-forty;
but was one of these self-possessed, hard-headed, im-
perturbable fellows, who, if they ever are beat at fisti-
cuffs, or other kind of warfare, never know it, and go
on coolly till they win.
“If I led you wrong, now,” said Hugh, tauntingly,
“you'd-ha, ha, ha!—you'd shoot me through the head,
I suppose."
John Gruedy took no more notice of this remark than
if he had been deaf and Hugh dumb; but kept riding
on, quite comfortably, with his eyes fixed on the horizon.
“ Did you ever try a fall with a man when you were
young, master?" said Hugh. “Can you make any play
at single stick?”
John Grueby looked at him sideways with the same
contented air, but deigned not a word in answer.
“-Like this?” said Hugh, giving his cudgel one of
those skilful flourishes, in which the rustic of that time
delighted. “Whoop!"
">Or that,” returned John Grueby, beating down his
guard with his whip, and striking him on the head with
its butt end. “Yes, I played a little once. You wear
your hair too long; I should have cracked your crown if
it had been a little shorter.”
It was a pretty smart, loud-sounding rap as it was,
and evidently astonished Hugh; who for the moment
seemed disposed to drag his new acquaintance from his
saddle. But his face betokening neithermalice, triumph,
rage, nor any lingering idea that he had given him of-
fence; his eyes gazing steadily in the old direction, and
his manner being as careless and composed as if he
had merely brushed away a fly; Hugh was so puzzled,
and so disposed to look upon him as a customer of almost
supernatural toughness, that he merely laughed, and
cried “ Well done!" then, sheering off a little, led the
way in silence."
Before the lapse of many minutes the party halted at
the Maypole door. Lord George and his secretary,
quickly dismounting, gave their horses to their servant,
who, under the guidance of Hugh, repaired to the stables.
Right glad to escape from the inclemency of the night,
they followed Mr. Willet into the common room, and
stood warming themselves and drying their clothes be-
fore the cheerful fire, while he busied himself with such

orders and preparations as his guest's high quality re-
quired.
As he bustled in and out of the room, intent on these
arrangements, he had an opportunity of observing the
two travellers, of whom, as yet, he knew nothing but
the voice. The lord, the great personage, who did the
Maypole so much honour, was about the middle height,
of a slender make, and sallow complexion, with an
aquiline nose, and long hair of a reddish brown, combed
perfectly straight and smooth about his ears, and slightly
powdered, but without the faintest vestige of a curl.
He was attired, under his great coat, in a full suit of
black, quite free from any ornament, and of the most
precise and sober cut. The gravity of his dress, together
with a certain lankness of cheek and stiffness of deport-
ment, added nearly ten years to his age, but his figure
was that of one not yet past thirty. As he stood musing
in the red glow of the fire, it was striking to observe his
very bright large eye, which betrayed a restlessness of
thought and purpose, singularly at variance with the
studied composure and sobriety of his mien, and with
his quaint and sad apparel. It had nothing harsh or
cruel in its expression; neither had his face, which was
thin and mild, and wore an air of melancholy; but it
was suggestive of an indefinable uneasiness, which in-
fected those who looked upon him, and filled them with
a kind of pity for the man: though why it did so, they
would have had some trouble to explain.
Gashford, the secretary, was taller, angularly made,
high shouldered, bony, and ungraceful. His dress, in
imitation of his superior, was demure and staid in the
extreme, his manner formal and constrained. This
gentleman had an overhanging brow, great hands and
feet and ears, and a pair of eyes that seemed to have
made an unnatural retreat into his head, and to have
dug themselves a cave to hide in. His manner was
smooth and humble, but very sly and slinking. He
wore the aspect of a man who was always lying in wait
for something that wouldn't come to pass; but he looked
patient, very patient, and fawned like a spaniel dog.
Even now, while he warmed and rubbed his hands be-
fore the blaze, he had the air of one who only presumed
to enjoy it in his degree as a commoner; and, though he
knew his lord was not regarding him, he looked into his

face from time to time, and with a meek and deferential
manner smiled as if for practice.
Such were the guests whom old John Willet, with a fixed
and leaden eye, surveyed a hundred times, and to whom
he now advanced with a state candlestick in each hand,
beseeching them to follow him into a worthier chamber.
“For, my lord,” said John-it is odd enough, but cer-
tain people seem to have as great a pleasure in pro-
nouncing titles as their owners have in wearing them-
“this room, my lord, isn't at all the sort of place for your
lordship, and I have to beg your lordship's pardon for
keeping you here, my lord, one minute."
With this address John ushered them up-stairs into the
state apartment, which, like many other things of state,
was cold and comfortless. Their own footsteps, rever-
berating through the spacious room, struck upon their
hearing with a hollow sound, and its damp and chilly
atmosphere was rendered doubly cheerless by contrast
with the homely warmth they had deserted.
It was of no use, however, to propose a return to the
place they had quitted, for the preparations went on so
briskly that there was no time to stop them. John, with
the tail candlestick in his hands, bowed them up to the
fireplace; Hugh, striding in with a lighted brand and
pile of firewood, cast it down upon the hearth, and set
it in a blaze; John Grueby (who had a great blue cockade
in his hat, which he appeared to despise mightily)
brought in the portmanteau he had carried on his horse
and placed it on the floor; and presently all three were
busily engaged in drawing out the screen, laying the
cloth, inspecting the beds, lighting fires in the bed-
rooms, expediting the supper, and making everything
as easy and as snug as might be on so short a notice.
In less than an hour's time supper had been served, and
ate, and cleared away; and Lord George and his secre-
tary, with slippered feet and legs stretched out before
the fire, sat over some hot mulled wine together.
“So ends, my lord,” said Gashford, filling his glass
with complacency, “the blessed work of a most blessed
day.”
« And a blessed yesterday,” said his lordship, raising
his head.
“Ah!”—and here the secretary clasped his hands—"a
blessed yesterday indeed! The Protestants of Suffolk

are godly men and true. Though others of our country-
men have lost their way in darkness, even as we, my
lord, did lose our road to-night, theirs is the light and
glory.”
“Did I move them, Gashford?” said Lord George.
“Move them, my lord! Move them! They cried to be
led on against the Papists, they vowed a dreadful ven-
geance on their heads, they roared like men possessed—”
“But not by devils,” said his lord.
“By devils! my lord! By angels.”
“Yes-oh, surely-by angels, no doubt,” said Lord
George, thrusting his hands into his pockets, taking
them out again to bite his nails, and looking uncom-
fortably at the fire. “Of course by angels-eh, Gash-
ford?""
“You do not doubt it, my lord?” said the secretary.
“No-no," returned his lord. “No. Why should I?
I suppose it would be mighty irreligious to doubt it-
wouldn't it, Gashford? Though there certainly were,"
he added, without waiting for an answer, “some plaguy
ill-looking characters among them."
“When you warmed," said the secretary, looking
sharply at the other's downcast eyes, which brightened
slowly as he spoke; “when you warmed into that noble
outbreak: when you told them that you were never of
the luke-warm or the timid tribe, and bade them take
heed that they were prepared to follow one who would
lead them on, though to the very death; when you spoke
of a hundred and twenty thousand men across the Scot-
tish border who would take their own redress at any
time, if it were not conceded; when you cried, ‘Perish
the Pope and all his base adherents; the penal laws
against them shall never be repealed while Englishmen
have hearts and hands'-and waved your own and
touched your own sword; and when they cried “No
Popery! and you cried “No; not even if we wade in
blood, and they threw up their hats and cried ‘Hurrah!
not even if we wade in blood; No Popery! Lord George!
Down with the Papists—Vengeance on their heads;'
when this was said and done, and a word from you, my
lord, could raise or still the tumult-ah! then I felt what
greatness was indeed, and thought, When was there
power like this of Lord George Gordon's!”
: “It's a great power. You're right. It is a great

power !” he cried, with sparkling eyes. “But—dear
Gashford-did I really say all that?”
“And how much more!” cried the secretary, looking
upwards. “Ah! how much more!"
“And I told them what you say, about the one hun-
dred and forty thousand men in Scotland, did I!” he
asked with evident delight. “That was bold.”
“Our cause is boldness. Truth is always bold.”
“ Certainly. So is religion. She's bold, Gashford ?”
“The true religion is, my lord.”
“And that's ours," he rejoined, moving uneasily in
his seat, and biting his nails as though he would pare
them to the quick. There can be no doubt of ours being
the true one. You feel as certain of that as I do, Gash-
ford, don't you ?”
“Does my lord ask me,” whined Gashford, drawing
his chair nearer with an injured air, and laying his
broad, flat hand upon the table; “me,” he repeated,
bending the dark hollows of his eyes upon him with an
unwholesome smile, “who, stricken by the magic of his
eloquence in Scotland but a year ago, abjured the errors
of the Romish Church, and clung to him as one whose
timely hand had plucked me from a pit?”
“True. No-no. I–I didn't mean it,” replied the
other, shaking him by the hand, rising from his seat,
and pacing restlessly about the room. “It's a proud
thing to lead the people, Gashford,” he added, as he
made a sudden halt.
“By force of reason, too,” returned the pliant secretary.
“Ay, to be sure. They may cough, and jeer, and
groan in Parliament, and call me fool and madman, but
which of them can raise this human sea, and make it
swell and roar at pleasure? Not one.”
“Not one,” repeated Gashford.
“Which of them can say for his honesty what I can
say for mine; which of them has refused a minister's
bribe of one thousand pounds a year to resign his seat
in favour of another? Not one."
“Not one,” repeated Gashford again, taking the lion's
share of the mulled wine between whiles.
“ And as we are honest, true, and in a sacred cause,
Gashford,” said Lord George, with a heightened colour
and in a louder voice, as he laid his fevered hand upon
his shoulder, “and are the only men who regard the

mass of people out of doors, or are regarded by them, we
will uphold them to the last, and will raise a cry against
these un-English Papists which shall re-echo through the
country, and roll with a noise like thunder. I will be
worthy of the motto on my coat of arms, ‘Called and
chosen and faithful.””
“Called,” said the secretary, “by Heaven.”
“I am.”
“Chosen by the people.”
“ Yes.”
“Faithful to both.”
“To the block !"
It would be difficult to convey an adequate idea of the
excited manner in which he gave these answers to the
secretary's promptings; of the rapidity of his utterance,
or the violence of his tone and gesture; in which, strug-
gling through his Puritan demeanour, was something
wild and ungovernable which broke through all re-
straint. For some minutes he walked rapidly up and
down the room, then stopping suddenly, exclaimed:
“Gashford-you moved them yesterday too. Oh, yes!
You did.”
"I shone with a reflected light, my lord,” replied the
humble secretary, laying his hand upon his heart. “I
did my best.”
“You did well,” said his master, “and are a great
and worthy instrument. If you will ring for John
Grueby to carry the portmanteau into my room, and
will wait here while I undress, we will dispose of busi-
ness as usual, if you're not too tired.”
“ Too tired, my lord! But this is his consideration!
Christian from head to foot.” With which soliloquy,
the secretary tilted the jug, and looked very hard into
the mulled wine, to see how much remained.
John Willet and John Grueby appeared together.
The one bearing the great candlesticks, and the other the
portmanteau, showed the deluded lord'into his chamber;
and left the secretary alone, to yawn and shake himself,
and finally to fall asleep before the fire.
“Now, Mr. Gashford, sir,” said John Grueby in his
ear, after what appeared to him a moment of uncon-
sciousness, “my lord's abed.”
“Oh. Very good, John," was the mild reply. “Thank
you, John. Nobody need sit up. I know my room."

“I hope you're not a going to trouble your head to-
night, or my lord's head neither, with anything more
about Bloody Mary,” said John.“I wish the blessed
old creetur had never been born.”
“I said you might go to bed, John,"returned the secre-
tary. “You didn't hear me, I think.”
"Between Bloody Marys, and blue cockades, and
glorious Queen Besses, and no Poperys, and Protestant
associations, and making of speeches," pursued John
Grueby, looking, as usual, a long way off, and taking
no notice of this hint, “my lord's half off his head.
When we go out o’ doors, such a set of ragamuffins
comes a shouting after us 'Gordon for ever!' that I'm
ashamed of myself and don't know where to look. When
we're indoors, they come a roaring and screaming about
the house like so many devils; and my lord, instead of
ordering them to be drove away, goes out into the
balcony and demeans himself by making speeches to
'em, and calls 'em “Men of England,' and 'Fellow-
countrymen,' as if he was fond of 'em and thanked 'em
for coming. I can't make it out, but they're all mixed
up somehow or another with that unfort'nate Bloody
Mary, and call her name out until they're hoarse.
They're all Protestants too-every man and boy among
'em, and Protestants is very fond of spoons, I find, and
silver plate in general, whenever area-gates is left open
accidentally. I wish that was the worst of it, and that
no more harm might be to come; but if you don't stop
these ugly customers in time, Mr. Gashford (and I
know you; you're the man that blows the fire), you'll
find 'em grow a little bit too strong for you. One of
these evenings, when the weather gets warmer and Prot-
estants are thirsty, they'll be pulling London down
and I never heard that Bloody Mary went as far as
that.”
Gashford had vanished long ago, and these remarks .
had been bestowed on empty air. Not at all discom-
posed by the discovery, John Grueby fixed his hat on,
wrong side foremost, that he might be unconscious of
the shadow of the obnoxious cockade, and withdrew to
bed; shaking his head in a very gloomy and prophetic
manner until he reached his chamber.

· CHAPTER XXXVI.
GASHFORD, with a smiling face, but still with looks
of profound deference and humility, betook himself
towards his master's room, smoothing his hair down as he
went, and humming a psalm tune. As he approached
Lord George's door he cleared his throat and hummed
more vigourously.
There was a remarkable contrast between this man's
occupation at the moment, and the expression of his
countenance, which was singularly repulsive and mali-
cious. His beetling brow almost obscured his eyes; his
lip was curled contemptuously; his very shoulders
seemed to sneer in stealthy whisperings with his great
flapped ears.
6 Hush!” he muttered softly, as he peeped in at the
chamber-door. “He seems to be asleep. Pray Heaven
he is! Too much watching, too much care, too much
thought-ah! Lord preserve him for a martyr! He is a
saint, if ever saint drew breath on this bad earth.”
Placing his light upon a table, he walked on tiptoe to
the fire, and sitting in a chair before it with his back
towards the bed, went on communing with himself like
one who thought aloud:
“The saviour of his country and his country's relig-
ion, the friend of his poor countrymen, the enemy of
the proud and harsh; beloved of the rejected and op-
pressed, adored by forty thousand bold and loyal Eng.
Tish hearts—what happy slumbers his should be!" And
here he sighed, and warmed his hands, and shook his
head as men do when their hearts are full, and heaved
another sigh, and warmed his hands again.
“Why, Gashford ?” said Lord George, who was lying
broad awake upon his side, and had been staring at him
from his entrance.
“My—my lord,” said Gashford, starting and looking
round as though in great surprise. “I have disturbed
you!”
“I have not beun sleeping.”
“Not sleeping!” he repeated, with assumed confusion.
“What can I say for having in your presence given ut-

terance to thoughts--but they were sincere—they were
sincere!” exclaimed the secretary, drawing his sleeve
in a hasty way across his eyes, “and why should I re-
gret you're having heard them?”
“Gashford,” said the poor lord, stretching out his
hand with manifest emotion. “Do not regret it. You
love me well, I know—too well. I don't deserve such
homage.”
Gashford made no reply but grasped the hand and
pressed it to his lips. Then rising, and taking from the
trunk a little desk, he placed it on a table near the fire,
unlocked it with a key he carried in his pocket, sat
down before it, took out a pen, and, before dipping it
in the inkstand, sucked it—to compose the fashion of
his mouth, perhaps, on which a smile was hovering yet.
“How do our numbers stand since last enrolling-
night?” inquired Lord George. “Are we really forty
thousand strong, or do we still speak in round numbers
when we take the Association at that amount?"
. “Our total now exceeds that number by a score and
three,” Gashford replied, casting his eyes upon his
papers:
* The funds?”
“Not very improving; but there is some manna in
the wilderness, my lord. Hem! On Friday night the
widows' mites dropped in. 'Forty scavengers, three and
fourpence. An aged pew-opener of St. Martin's parish,
sixpence. A bell-ringer of the established church, six-
pence. A Protestant infant, newly born, one halfpenny.
The United Link Boys, three shillings-one bad. The
anti-popish prisoners in Newgate, five and fourpence.
A friend in Bedlam, half-a-crown. Dennis, the hangman,
one shilling.”
“That Dennis,” said his lordship, “is an earnest man.
I marked him in the crowd in Welbeck Street, last
Friday.”
“A good man,” rejoined the secretary; "a staunch,
sincere, and truly zealous man.”
“He should be encouraged,” said Lord George. “Make
a note of Dennis. I'll talk with him.”
Gashford obeyed, and went on reading from his list:
6. The Friends of Reason, half-a-guinea. The Friends
of Liberty, half-a-guinea. The Friends of Peace, half-a-
guinea. The Friends of Charity, half-a-guinea. The

287
Friends of Mercy, half-a-guinea. The Associated Re-
memberers of Bloody Mary, half-a-guinea. The United
Bull-Dogs, half-a-guinea.""
“ The United Bull-Dogs,” said Lord George, biting his
nails most horribly, “ are a new society, are they not?”
“Formerly the Prentice Knights, my lord. The in-
dentures of the old members expiring by degrees, they
changed their name, it seems, though they still have
’prentices among them, as well as workmen.
“What is their president's name?” inquired Lord
George.
“President,” said Gashford, reading, “Mr. Simon
Tappertit.”
"I remember him. The little man, who sometimes
brings an elderly sister to our meetings, and sometimes
another female too, who is conscientious, I have no
doubt, but not well-favoured ?".
“ The very same, my lord.”
" Tappertit is an earnest man,” said Lord George,
thoughtfully. “Eh, Gashford?”
“One of the foremost among them all, my lord. He
snuffs the battle from afar like a war-horse. He throws
his hat up in the street as if he were inspired, and makes
most stirring speeches from the shoulders of his friends."
“Make a note of Tappertit,” said Lord George Gordon.
“We may advance him to a position of trust.”
“That,” rejoined the secretary, doing as he was told,
“is all-except Mrs. Varden's box (fourteenth time of
opening), fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver and
copper, and half-a-guinea in gold; and Miggs (being the
savings of a quarter's wages), one-and-threepence.”
“Miggs,” said Lord George. “Is that a man?"
“ The name is entered on the list as a woman,” replied
the secretary. “I think she is the tall, spare female of
whom you spoke just now, my lord, as not being well-
favoured, who sometimes comes to hear the speeches-
along with Tappertit and Mrs. Varden.”
“Mrs. Varden is the elderly lady, then, is she?".
The secretary nodded, and rubbed the bridge of his
nose with the feather of his pen.
“She is a zealous sister,” said Lord George. “Her
collection goes on prosperously, and is pursued with fer-
vour. Has her husband joined?”
“A malignant,” returned the secretary, folding up his

papers. “Unworthy such a wife. He remains in outer
darkness, and steadily refuses.”
“The consequences be upon his own head! Gash-
ford!”
“My lord!”
“You don't think,” he turned restlessly in his bed as
he spoke, “these people will desert me when the hour
arrives?' I have spoken boldly for them, ventured
much, suppressed nothing. They'll not fall off, will
they?"
"No fear of that, my lord,” said Gashford, with a
meaning look, which was rather the involuntary expres-
sion of his own thoughts than intended as any confirma-
tion of his words, for the other's face was turned away.
“Be sure there is no fear of that.”
“Nor,” he said, with a more restless motion than be-
fore, “ of their—but they can sustain no harm from
leaguing for that purpose. Right is on our side, though
Might may be against us. You feel as sure of that as
I–honestly, you do?”
The secretary was beginning with “You do not
doubt,” when the other interrupted him, and impatiently
rejoined:
* Doubt. No. Who says I doubt? If I doubted,
should I cast away relatives, friends, everything, for
this unhappy country's sake; this unhappy country,”
he,cried, springing up in bed, after repeating the phrase
“unhappy country's sake” to himself, at least a dozen
times, “forsaken of God and man, delivered over to a
dangerous confederacy of Popish powers; the prey of
corruption, idolatry, and despotism! Who says I doubt?
Am I called, and chosen, and faithful? Tell me. Am
I, or am I not?”
“To God, the country, and yourself," cried Gashford.
“I am. I will be. I say again, I will be: to the block.
Who says as much! Do you? Does any man alive?”
The secretary drooped his head with an expression of
perfect acquiescence in anything that had been said or
might be; and Lord George, gradually sinking down
upon his pillow, fell asleep.
Although there was something very ludicrous in his
vehement manner, taken in conjunction with his meagre
aspect and ungraceful presence, it would scarcely have
provoked a smile in any man of kindly feeling; or even

289
if it had, he would have felt sorry and almost angry
with himself next moment for yielding to the impulse.
This lord was sincere in his violence and in his waver-
ing. A nature prone to false enthusiasm, and the vanity
of being a leader, were the worst qualities apparent in
his composition. All the rest was weakness-sheer
weakness; and it is the unhappy lot of thoroughly weak
men that their very sympathies, affections, confidences
-all the qualities which in better-constituted minds are
virtues-dwindle into foibles, or turn into downright
vices.
Gashford, with many a sly look towards the bed, sat
chuckling at his master's folly until his deep and heavy
breathing warned him that he might retire. Locking
his desk and replacing it within the trunk (but not be-
fore he had taken from a secret lining two printed hand-
bills), he cautiously withdrew; looking back as he went
at the pale face of the slumbering man, above whose
head the dusty plumes, that crowned the Maypole couch,
waved drearily and sadly as though it were a bier. :
Stopping on the staircase to listen that all was quiet,
and to take off his shoes lest his footsteps should alarm
any light sleeper who might be near at hand, he de-
scended to the ground floor and thrust one of his bills
beneath the great door of the house. That done, he
crept softly back to his own chamber, and from the win-
dow let another fall-carefully wrapped round a stone
to save it from the wind-into the yard below.
They were addressed on the back “ To every Protest-
ant into whose hands this shall come,” and bore within
what follows:
“Men and Brethren. Whoever shall find this letter
will take it as a warning to join, without delay, the
friends of Lord George Gordon. There are great events
at hand; and the times are dangerous and troubled.
Read this carefully, keep it clean and drop it somewhere
else. For King and Country. Union.”
“More seed, more seed,” said Gashford, as he closed
the window. “ When will the harvest come!"

CHAPTER XXXVII.
To surround anything, however monstrous or ridicu-
lous, with an air of mystery, is to invest it with a secret
charm, and power of attraction which to the crowd is
irresistible. False priests, false prophets, false doctors,
false patriots, false prodigies of every kind, veiling their
proceedings in mystery, have always addressed them-
selves at an immense advantage to the popular credulity,
and have been, perhaps, more indebted to that resource
in gaining and keeping for a time the upper hand of
Truth and Common Sense, than to any half-dozen items
in the whole catalogue of imposture. Curiosity is, and
has been from the creation of the world, a master-pas-
sion. To awaken it, to gratify it by slight degrees, and
yet leave something always in suspense, is to establish
the surest hold that can be had, in wrong, on the un-
thinking portion of mankind.
If a man had stood on London Bridge, calling till he
was hoarse, to the passers-by, to join with Lord George
Gordon, although for an object which no man under-
stood, and which in that very incident had a charm of
its own—the probability is that he might have influenced
a score of people in a month. If all zealous Protestants
had been publicly urged to join an association for the
avowed purpose of singing a hymn or two occasionally,
and hearing some indifferent speeches made, and ulti-
mately of petitioning Parliament not to pass an act for
abolishing the penal laws against Roman Catholic
priests, the penalty of perpetual imprisonment de-
nounced against those who educated children in that
persuasion, and the disqualification of all members of
the Romish Church to inherit real property in the United
Kingdom by right of purchase or descent-matters so
far removed from the business and bosoms of the mass
might perhaps have called together a hundred people.
But when vague rumours got abroad, that in this
Protestant association a secret power was mustering
against the government for undefined and mighty
purposes; when the air was filled with whispers of a
confederacy among the Popish powers to degrade and

291
enslave England, establish an inquisition in London,
and turn the pens of Smithfield market into stakes and
caldrons; when terrors and alarm which no man under-
stood were perpetually broached, both in and out of
Parliament, by one enthusiast who did not understand
himself, and bygone bugbears which had lain quietly
in their graves for centuries, were raised again to haunt
the ignorant and credulous; when all this was done, as
it were, in the dark, and secret invitations to join the
Great Protestant Association in defense of religion, life
and liberty, were dropped in the public ways, thrust
under the house doors, tossed in at the windows, and
pressed into the hands of those who trod the streets by
night; when they glared from every wall, and shone on
every post and pillar, so that stocks and stones appeared
infected with the common fear, urging all men to join
together blindfold in resistance of they knew not what,
they knew not why—then the mania spread, indeed, and
the body, still increasing every day, grew forty thousand
strong..
So said, at least, in this month of March, 1780, Lord
George Gordon, the Association's president. Whether
it was the fact or otherwise, few men knew, or cared to
ascertain. It had never made any public demonstration;
had scarcely ever been heard of save through him; had
never been seen; and was supposed by many to be the
mere creature of his disordered brain. He was accustomed
to talk largely about numbers of men-stimulated, as it
was inferred, by certain successful disturbances, arising
out of the same subject, which had occurred in Scotland
in the previous year; was looked upon as a crack-brained
member of the lower house, who attacked all parties
and sided with none, and was very little regarded. It
was known that there was discontent abroad-there
always is; he had been accustomed to address the people
by placard, speech, and pamphlet, upon other questions;
nothing had come, in England, of his past exertions,
and nothing was apprehended from his present. Just
as he has come upon the reader, he had come, from time
to time, upon the public, and been forgotten in a day; as
suddenly as he appears in these pages, after a blank of
five long years, did he and his proceedings begin to force
themselves, about this period, upon the notice of thou-
sands of people, who had mingled in active life during

the whole interval, and who, without being deaf or
blind to passing events, had scarcely ever thought of
him before.
“My lord,” said Gashford in his ear, as he drew the
curtains of his bed betimes; “my lord!”
“ Yes—who's that?” What is it?"
• The clock has struck nine,” returned the secretary,
with meekly folded hands. “You have slept well? I
hope you have slept well? If my prayers are heard, you
are refreshed indeed.”
“ To say the truth, I have slept so soundly,” said Lord
George, rubbing his eyes and looking round the room,
" that I don't remember quite—what place is this?”
“My lord!” cried Gashford, with a smile.
“Oh!" returned his superior. “Yes. You're not a
Jew, then?”
“ A Jew!” exclaimed the pious secretary, recoiling.
“I dreamed that we were Jews, Gashford. You and I
- both of us-Jews with long beards.”
“Heaven forbid, my lord! We might as well be
Papists."
"I suppose we might," returned the other, very
quickly. “Eh? You really think so, Gashford?”
“Surely I do,” the secretary cried, with looks of great
surprise.
“Humph!” he muttered. “Yes, that seems reason-
able.”
“I hope, my lord—” the secretary began.
“Hope!” he echoed, interrupting him. “Why do you
say you hope? There's no harm in thinking of such
things."
“Not in dreams," returned the secretary.
“In dreams! No, nor waking either.”
-"Called, and chosen, and faithful,”” said Gashford,
taking up Lord George's watch, which lay upon a chair,
and seeming to read the inscription on the seal ab-
stractedly.
It was the slightest action possible, not obtruded on
his notice, and apparently the result of a moment's ab-
sence of mind, not worth remark. But as the words
were uttered, Lord George, who had been going on im-
petuously, stopped short, reddened, and was silent.
Apparently quite unconscious of this change in his de-
meanor, the wily secretary stepped a little apart, under

pretence of pulling up the window-blind, and returning,
when the other had had time to recover, said:
“ The holy cause goes bravely on, my lord. I was not
idle, even last night. I dropped two of the handbills
before I went to bed, and both are gone this morning.
Nobody in the house has mentioned the circumstance of
finding them, though I have been down stairs full half
an hour. One or two recruits will be their first fruit, I
predict; and who shall say how many more, with
Heaven's blessing on your inspired exertions!”
“It was a famous device in the beginning," replied
Lord George, “ an excellent device, and did good service
in Scotland. It was quite worthy of you. You remind
me not to be a sluggard, Gashford, when the vineyard is
menaced with destruction, and may be trodden down by
Papist feet. Let the horses be saddled in half an hour.
We must be up and doing!"
He said this with a heightened colour, and in a tone of
such enthusiasm, that the secretary deemed all further
prompting needless, and withdrew.
-"Dreamed he was a Jew,” he said, thoughtfully, as
he closed the bedroom door. “He may come to that be-
fore he dies. It's like enough. Well! After a time, and
provided I lost nothing by it, I don't see why that religion
shouldn't suit me as well as any other. There are rich
men among the Jews; shaving is very troublesome-
yes, it would suit me well enough. For the present,
though, we must be Christian to the core. Our prophetic
motto will suit all creeds in their turn, that's a comfort.”
Reflecting on this source of consolation, he reached the
sitting-room, and rang the bell for breakfast.
Lord George was quickly dressed (for his plain toilet
was easily made), and as he was no less frugal in his
repasts than in his Puritan attire, his share of the meal
was soon despatched. The secretary, however, more
devoted to the good things of this world, or more intent
on sustaining his strength and spirits for the sake of the
Protestant cause, ate and drank to the last minute, and
required indeed some three or four reminders from John
Grueby, before he could resolve to tear himself away
from Mr. Willet's plentiful providing.
At length he came down stairs, wiping his greasy
mouth, and having paid John Willet's bill, climbed into
his saddle. Lord George, who had been walking up and

down before the house talking to himself with earnest
gestures, mounted his horse, and returning old John
Willet's stately bow, as well as the parting salutation of
a dozen idlers whom the rumour of a live lord being
about to leave the Maypole had gathered round the
porch, they rode away, with stout John Grueby in the
rear.
If Lord George Gordon had appeared in the eyes of
Mr. Willet, overnight, a nobleman of somewhat quaint
and odd exterior, the impression was confirmed this
morning, and increased a hundred fold. Sitting bolt
upright upon his bony steed, with his long, straight hair
dangling about his face and fluttering in the wind; his
limbs all angular and rigid; his elbows stuck out on
either side ungracefully, and his whole frame jogged
and shaken at every motion of his horse's feet; a more
grotesque or more ungainly figure can hardly be con-
ceived. In lieu of whip, he carried in his hand a great
gold-headed cane, as large as any footman carries in
these days; and his various modes of holding this un-
wieldy weapon—now upright before his face like the
sabre of a horse-soldier, now over his shoulder like a
musket, now between his finger and thumb, but always
in some uncouth and awkward fashion-contributed in
no small degree to the absurdity of his appearance.
Stiff, lank, and solemn, dressed in an unusual manner,
and ostentatiously exhibiting—whether by design or
accident-all his peculiarities of carriage, gesture, and
conduct; all the qualities, natural and artificial, in
which he differed from other men; he might have moved
the sternest looker-on to laughter, and fully provoked
the smiles and whispered jests which greeted his depart-
ure from the Maypole inn.
Quite unconscious, however, of the effect he produced,
he trotted on beside his secretary, talking to himself
nearly all the way, until they came within a mile or two
of London, when now and then some passenger went
by who knew him by sight, and pointed him out to some
one else, and perhaps stood looking after him, or cried
in jest or earnest as it might be,“ Hurrah, Geordie! No
Popery!" At which he would gravely pull off his hat,
and bow When they reached the town and rode along
the streets, these notices became more frequent; some
laughed, some hissed, some turned their heads and smiled,

295
some wondered who he was,some ran along the pavement
by his side and cheered. When this happened in a crush
of carts and chairs and coaches, he would make a dead
stop, and pulling off his hat, cry, “ Gentlemen, No
Popery!" to which the gentlemen would respond with
lusty voices, and with three times three; and then, on
he would go again with a score or so of the raggedest
following at his horse's heels, and shouting till their
throats were parched.
The old ladies too—there were a great many old ladies
in the streets, and these all knew him. Some of them,
not those of the highest rank, but such as sold fruit from
baskets and carried burdens—clapped their shrivelled
hands, and raised a weazen, piping, shrill “Hurrah,
my lord.” Others waved their hands or handkerchiefs,
or shook their fans or parasols, or threw up windows
and called in haste to those within, to come and see.
All those marks of popular esteem, he received with
profound gravity and respect; bowing very low, and so
frequently that his hat was more off his head than on;
and looking up at the houses as he passed along, with
the air of one who was making a public entry, and yet
was not puffed up or proud.
So they rode (to the deep and unspeakable disgust of
John Grueby), the whole length of Whitechapel, Lead-
enhall Street, and Cheapside, and into Saint Paul's
Churchyard. Arriving close to the cathedral, he halted;
spoke to Gashford; and looking upwards at its lofty
dome, shook his head, as though he said, “ The Church in
Danger!” Then, to be sure, the bystanders stretched
their throats indeed; and he went on again with mighty
acclamations from the mob, and lower bows than ever.
So along the Strand, up Swallow Street, into the Ox-
ford-road, and thence to his house in Welbeck Street,
near Cavendish Square, whither he was attended by a
few dozen idlers: of whom he took leave on the steps
with this brief parting, “Gentlemen, No Popery. Good-
day. God bless you:” This being rather a shorter ad-
dress than they expected, was received with some dis-
pleasure, and cries of " A speech! a speech!" which
might have been complied with, but that John Grueby,
making a mad charge upon them with all three horses,
on his way to the stables, caused them to disperse into
the adjoining fields, where they presently fell to pitch

and toss, chuckfarthing, odd or even, dog-fighting, and
other Protestant recreations.
In the afternoon Lord George came forth again,
dressed in a black velvet coat, and trousers and waist of
the Gordon plaid, all of the same Quaker cut; and in
this costume, which made him look à dozen times more
strange and singular than before, went down on foot to
Westminster. Gashford, meanwhile, bestirred himself
in business matters; with which he was still engaged
when, shortly after dusk, John Grueby entered and an-
nounced a visitor.
“Let him come in," said Gashford.
“Here! come in!” growled John to somebody without.
“You're a Protestant, an't you?”
“I should think so," replied a deep, gruff voice.
“You've the look of it,” said John Grueby. “I'd have
known you for one anywhere.” With which remark he
gave the visitor admission, retired, and shut the door.
The man who now confronted Gashford was a squat,
thick-set personage, with a low, retreating forehead, a
coarse shock head of hair, and eyes so small and near
together that his broken nose alone seemed to prevent
their meeting and fusing into one of the usual size. A
dingy handkerchief twisted like a cord about his neck,
left its great veins exposed to view, and they were
swollen and starting, as though with gulping down
strong passions, malice, and ill-will. His dress was of
threadbare velveteen-a faded, rusty, whitened black,
like the ashes of a pipe or a coal fire after a day's ex-
tinction; discoloured with the soils of many a stale de-
bauch, and reeking yet with pot-house odours. In lieu
of buckles at his knees, he wore unequal loops of pack-
thread; and in his grimy hands he held a knotted stick,
the knob of which was carved into a rough likeness of his
own vile face. Such was the visitor who doffed his
three-cornered hat in Gashford's presence, and waited,
leering, for his notice.
“Ah! Dennis!” cried the secretary. “Sit down.”
“I see my lord down yonder-” cried the man, with a
jerk of his thumb towards the quarter that he spoke of,
"and he says to me, says my lord, “If you've nothing to
do, Dennis, go up to my house and talk with Muster
Gashford. Of course I'd nothing to do, you know.
These an’t my working hours. Ha, ha! I was a taking

the air when I see my lord, that's what I was doing. I
takes the air by night, as the howls does, Muster Gash-
ford.”
"And sometimes in the daytime, eh?” said the secre-
tary-" when you go out in state, you know.”
“Ha, ha!” roared the fellow, smiting his leg; “for a
gentleman as’ull say a pleasant thing in a pleasant way,
give me Muster Gashford agin' all London and West-
minster! My lord an't a bad ’un at that, but he's a fool
to you. Ah, to be sure—when I go out in state.”
" And have your carriage,” said the secretary; "and
your chaplain, eh? and all the rest of it?”
“You'll be the death of me,” cried Dennis, with an-
other roar, “you will. But what's in the wind now,
Muster Gashford,” he asked, hoarsely, “eh? Are we to
be under orders to pull down one of them Popish chapels
—or what?”
“Hush!" said the secretary, suffering the faintest
smile to play upon his face. “Hush! God bless me,
Dennis! We associate, you know, for strictly peace-
able and lawful purposes.”
“I know, bless you,” returned the man, thrusting his
tongue into his cheek; “I entered a' purpose, didn't I!”
“No doubt,” said Gashford, smiling as before. And
when he said so, Dennis roared again, and smote his
leg still harder, and falling into fits of laughter, wiped
his eyes with the corners of his neckerchief, and cried,
“Muster Gashford agin' all England hollow!"
“Lord George and I were talking of you last night,”
said Gashford, after a pause. “He says you are a very
earnest fellow.”.
“So I am,” returned the hangman.
“And that you truly hate the Papists."
“So I do,” and he confirmed it with a good round
oath. “Lookye here, Muster Gashford,” said the fellow,
laying his hat and stick upon the floor, and slowly beat-
ing the palm of one hand with the fingers of the other.
“ Ob-serve. I'm a constitutional officer that works for
my living, and does my work creditable. Do I, or do I
not?"
“Unquestionably.”
“Very good. Stop a minute. My work is sound, Prot-
estant, constitutional, English work. Is it, or is it not?”
“No man alive can doubt it.”

"Nor dead neither. Parliament says this here-says
Parliament, 'If any man, woman, or child does any-
thing which goes again a certain number of our acts' --
how many hanging laws may there be at this present
time, Muster Gashford? Fifty?”
“I don't exactly know how many,” replied Gashford,
leaning back in his chair and yawning; “ a great num-
ber, though.”
“Well; say fifty. Parliament says, “If any man,
woman, or child does anything again any one of them
fifty acts, that man, woman, or child shall be worked
off by Dennis. George the Third steps in when they
number very strong at the end of a sessions, and says,
“These are too many for Dennis. I'll have half for my-
self and Dennis shall have half for himself; and some-
times he throws me in one over that I don't expect, as he
did three years ago, when I got Mary Jones, a young
woman of nineteen who come up to Tyburn with a in-
fant at her breast, and was worked off for taking a
piece of cloth off the counter of a shop in Ludgate-hill,
and putting it down again when the shopman see her;
and who had never done any harm before, and only
tried to do that in consequence of her husband having
been pressed three weeks previous, and she being left
to beg, with two young children-as was proved upon
the trial. Ha, ha!-Well! That being the law and the
practice of England, is the glory of England, an't it,
Muster Gashford?”
“ Certainly,” said the secretary.
“And in times to come,” pursued the hangman, “if
our grandsons should think of their grandfathers' times,
and find these things altered, they'll say, “Those were
days indeed, and we've been going down hill ever since.'
Won't they, Muster Gashford?”
“I have no doubt they will,” said the secretary.
“Well, then, look here,” said the hangman. “If these
Papists gets into power, and begins to boil and roast
instead of hang, what becomes of my work! If they
touch my work that's a part of so many laws, what
becomes of the laws in general, what becomes of the
religion, what becomes of the country! Did you ever
go to church, Muster Gashford ?”
"Ever!” repeated the secretary with some indignation;
66 of course.”

“Well,” said the ruffian, “I've been once-twice,
counting the time I was christened-and when I heard
the Parliament prayed for, and thought how many new
hanging laws they made every sessions, I considered
that I was prayed for. Now mind, Muster Gashford,”
said the fellow, taking up his stick and shaking it with
a ferocious air, “I mustn't have my Protestant work
touched, nor this state of Protestant things altered in no
degree, if I can help it; I mustn't have no Papists inter-
fering with me, unless they come to me to be worked
off in course of law; I mustn't have no biling, no roast-
ing, no frying-nothing but hanging. My lord may well
call me an earnest fellow. In support of the great
Protestant principle of having plenty of that, I'll," and
here he beat his club upon the ground, “burn, fight, kill
-do anything you bid me, so that it's bold and devilish
—though the end of it was that I got hung myself.
There, Muster Gashford!”
He appropriately followed up this frequent prostitu-
tion, of a noble word to the vilest purposes, by pouring
out in a kind of ecstacy at least a score of most tre-
mendous oaths; then wiped his heated face upon his .
neckerchief, and cried, “No Popery! I'm a religious man,
by G !"
Gashford had leant back in his chair, regarding him
with eyes so sunken and so shadowed by his heavy
brows, that for aught the hangman saw of them, he
might have been stone blind. He remained smiling in
silence for a short time longer, and then said, slowly
and distinctly:
“You are indeed an earnest fellow, Dennis-a most
valuable fellow—the staunchest man I know of in our
ranks. But you must calm yourself; you must be peace-
ful, lawful, mild as any lamb. I am sure you will be,
though.”
“Ay, ay, we shall see, Muster Gashford, we shall see.
You won't have to complain of me,” returned the
other, shaking his head.
“Iam sure I shall not,” said the secretary, in the same
mild tone and with the same emphasis. “We shall
have, we think, about next month or May, when this
Papist relief bill comes before the house, to convene our
whole body for the first time. My lord has thoughts of
our walking in procession through the streets-just as

an innocent display of strength-and accompanying our
petition down to the door of the House of Commons.”
“The sooner the better,” said Dennis, with another
oath.
"We shall have to draw up in divisions, our numbers
being so large; and, I believe I may venture to say,” re-
sumed Gashford, affecting not to hear the interruption,
“though I have no direct instructions to that effect-
that Lord George has thought of you as an excellent
leader for one of these parties. I have no doubt you
will be an admirable one."
“ Try me,” said the fellow, with an ugly wink.
“ You would be cool, I know,” pursued the secretary,
still smiling and still managing his eyes so that he could
watch him closely, and really not be seen in turn, “obe-
dient to orders and perfectly temperate. You would
lead your party into no danger, I am certain.”
“I'd lead them, Muster Gashford_"—the hangman
was beginning in a reckless way, when Gashford started
forward, laid his finger on his lips, and feigned to write,
just as the door was opened by John Grueby.
“Oh!” said John, looking in, “here's another Prot-
estant.”
“Some other room, John,” cried Gashford, in his
blandest voice. “I am engaged just now.”
But John had brought this new visitor to the door, and
he walked in unbidden, as the words were uttered; giv-
ing to view the form and features, rough attire and reck-
less air of Hugh.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
THE secretary put his hand before his eyes to shade
them from the glare of the lamp, and for some moments
looked at Hugh with a frowning brow, as if he remem-
bered to have seen him lately, but could not call to mind
where, or on what occasion. His uncertainty was very
brief, for, before Hugh had spoken a word, he said, as
his countenance cleared up:
“Ay, ay, I recollect. *It's quite right, John, you
needn't wait. Don't go, Dennis.”
“Your servant, master,” said · Hugh, as Grueby dis-
appeared.
*Yours, friend,” returned the secretary, in his smooth-
est manner. “What brings you here? We left nothing
behind us, I hope?”
Hugh gave a short laugh, and, thrusting his hand
into his breast, produced one of the handbills, soiled and
dirty from lying out of doors all night, which he laid
upon the secretary's desk, after flattening it upon his
knee and smoothing out the wrinkles with his heavy
palm.
“Nothing but that, master. It fell into good hands,
you see.”
“What is this!” said Gashford, turning it over with
an air of perfectly natural surprise. “Where did you
get it from, my good fellow; what does it mean? I don't
understand this at all.”
A little disconcerted by this reception, Hugh looked
from the secretary to Dennis, who had risen and was
standing at the table too, observing the stranger by
stealth, and seeming to derive the utmost satisfaction
from his manners and appearance. Considering himself
silently appealed to by this action, Mr. Dennis shook his
head thrice, as if to say of Gashford, “ No. He don't know
anything at all about it. I know he don't. I'll take my
oath he don't;" and hiding his profile from Hugh with
one long end of his frowsy neckerchief, nodded and
chuckled behind this screen in extreme approval of the
secretary's proceedings.
“It tells the man that finds it to come here, don't it?”
you so hat is the tig og fellow;

asked Hugh. “I'm no scholar, myself, but I showed it
to a friend, and he said it did.”
“It certainly does,” said Gashford, opening his eyes
to their utmost width; “really this is the most remark-
able circumstance I have ever known. How did you
come by this piece of paper, my good friend?”.
“Muster Gashford,” wheezed the hangman under his
breath, “agin' all Newgate!”
Whether Hugh heard him, or saw by his manner that
he was being played upon, or perceived the secretary's
drift of himself, he came in his blunt way to the point
at once.
“Here!” he said, stretching out his hand and taking
it back; “never mind the bill, or what it says, or what
it don't say. You don't know anything about it, master
-no more do I—no more does he,” glancing at Dennis.
“None of us know what it means, or where it comes
from: there's an end of that. Now I want to make
one against the Catholics, I'm a No-Popery man, and
ready to be sworn in. That's what I've come here for.”
“Put him down on the roll, Muster Gashford,” said
Dennis, approvingly. “That's the way to go to work-
right to the end at once, and no palaver."
“What's the use of shooting wide of the mark, eh,
old boy!” cried Hugh.
“My sentiments all over!" rejoined the hangman.
“ This is the sort of chap for my division, Muster Gash-
ford. Down with him, sir. Put him on the roll. I'd
stand godfather to him, if he was to be christened in a
bonfire made of the ruins of the Bank of England.”
With these and other expressions of confidence of the
like flattering kind, Mr. Dennis gave him a hearty slap
on the back, which Hugh was not slow to return.
“No Popery, brother!” cried the hangman.
“No Property, brother!" responded Hugh.
“Popery, Popery,” said the secretary, with his usual
mildness.
“It's all the same!” cried Dennis. “It's all right.
Down with him, Muster Gashford. Down with every-
body, down with everything! Hurrah for the Prot-
estant religion! That's the time of day, Muster Gash-
ford!"
The secretary regarded them both with a very favour-
able expression of countenance, while they gave loose

303
to these and other demonstrations of their patriotic pur-
pose; and was about to make some remark aloud, when
Dennis, stepping up to him, and shading his mouth with
his hand, said in a hoarse whisper, as he nudged him
with his elbow:
“Don't split upon a constitutional officer's profession,
Muster Gashford. There are popular prejudices, you
know, and he mightn't like it. Wait till he comes to
be more intimate with me. He's a fine-built chap, an't
he?"
“A powerful fellow indeed!"
“Did you ever, Muster Gashford,” whispered Dennis,
with a horrible kind of admiration, such as thåt with
which a cannibal might regard his intimate friend, when
hungry-“ did you ever” — and here he drew still closer
to his ear, and fenced his mouth with both his open
hands—“see such a throat as his? Do but cast your
eye upon it. There's a neck for stretching, Muster
Gashford!”
The secretary assented to this proposition with the
best grace he could assumemit is difficult to feign a true
professional relish: which is eccentric sometimes—and
after asking the candidate a few unimportant questions,
proceeded to enroll him a member of the Great Protest-
ant Association of England. If anything could have
exceeded Mr. Dennis's joy on the happy conclusion of
this ceremony, it would have been the rapture with
which he received the announcement that the new mem-
ber could neither read nor write: those two arts being
(as Mr. Dennis swore) the greatest possible curse a civil-
ised community could know, and militating more
against the professional emoluments and usefulness of
the great constitutional office he had the honor to hold
than any adverse circumstances that could present them-
selves to his imagination.
The enrolment being completed, and Hugh having
been informed by Gashford, in his peculiar manner, of
the peaceful and strictly lawful objects contemplated by
the body to which he now belonged during which
recital Mr. Dennis nudged him very much with his
elbow, and made divers remarkable faces--the secre-
tary gave them both to understand that he desired to be
alone. Therefore they took their leaves without delay,
and came out of the house together.

“Are you walking, brother?” said Dennis.
“Ay!” returned Hugh. “Where you will.”
- That's social,” said his new friend. “Which way
shall we take? Shall we go and have a look at doors
. that we shall make a pretty good clattering at before
long-eh, brother?”
Hugh answering in the affirmative, they went slowly
down to Westminster, where both houses of Parliament
were then sitting. Mingling in the crowd of carriages,
horses, servants, chairmen, link-boys, porters, and
idlers of all kinds, they lounged about; while Hugh's
new friend pointed out to him significantly the weak
parts of the building, how easy it was to get into the
lobby, and so to the very door of the House of Commons;
and how plainly, when they marched down there in
grand array, their roars and shouts would be heard by
the members inside; with a great deal more to the same
purpose, all of which Hugh received with manifest
delight.
He told him, too, who some of the Lords and Com-
mons were by name, as they came in and out; whether
they were friendly to the Papists or otherwise; and
bade him take notice of their liveries and equipages,
that he might be sure of them in case of need. Some-
times he drew him close to the windows of a passing
carriage, that he might see its master's face by the light
of the lamps: and both in respect of people and localities,
he showed so much acquaintance with everything
around, that it was plain he had often studied there
before; as indeed, when they grew a little more con-
fidential, he confessed he had.
Perhaps the most striking part of all this was the
number of people—never in groups of more than two or
three together—who seemed to be skulking about the
crowd for the same purpose. To the greater part of
these, a slight nod or a look from Hugh's companion
was sufficient greeting; but, now and then, some man
would come and stand beside him in the throng,
and without turning his head or appearing to com-
municate with him, would say a word or two in a low
voice, which he would answer in the same cautious
manner. Then they would part like strangers. Some
of these men often re-appeared again unexpectedly in
the crowd close to Hugh, and, as they passed by, pressed

305
his hand, or looked him sternly in the face; but they
never spoke to him, nor he to them; no, not a word.
It was remarkable, too, that whenever they happened
to stand where there was any press of people, and Hugh
chanced to be looking downward, he was sure to see an
arm stretched out-under his own, perhaps, or perhaps
across him—which thrust some paper into the hand or
pocket of a bystander, and was so suddenly withdrawn
that it was impossible to tell from whom it came; nor
could he see in any face, on glancing quickly round, the
least confusion or surprise. They often trod upon a
paper like the one he carried in his breast, but his com-
panion whispered him not to touch it or to take it up
-not even to look towards it--so there they let them
lie and passed on.
When they had paraded the street and all the avenues
of the building in this manner for near two hours, they
turned away, and his friend asked him what he thought
of what he had seen, and whether he was prepared for
a good hot piece of work if it should come to that. “The
hotter the better,” said Hugh, “I'm prepared for any-
thing." "So am I," said his friend, and so are many
of us;" and they shook hands upon it with a great oath,
and with many terrible imprecations on the Papists.
As they were thirsty by this time, Dennis proposed
that they should repair together to The Boot, where
there was good company and strong liquor. Hugh
yielding a ready assent, they bent their steps that way
with no loss of time.
This Boot was a lone house of public entertainment,
situated in the fields at the back of the Foundling Hos-
pital; a very solitary spot at that period, and quite de-
serted after dark. The tavern stood at some distance
from any high road, and was approachable only by a
dark and narrow lane; so that Hugh was much surprised
to find several people drinking there, and great merri-
ment going on. He was still more surprised to find
among them almost every face that had caught his
attention in the crowd; but his companion having whis-
pered him outside the door that it was not considered
good manners at The Boot to appear at all curious about
the company, he kept his own counsel, and made no
show of recognition.
Before putting his lips to the liquor which was brought

for them, Dennis drank in a loud voice the health of
Lord George Gordon, President of the Great Protestant
Association, which toast Hugh pledged likewise, with
corresponding enthusiasm. A fiddler who was present,
and who appeared to act as the appointed minstrel of
the company, forthwith struck up a Scotch reel; and
that in tones so invigorating, that Hugh and his friend
(who had both been drinking before) rose from their
seats as by previous concert, and to the great admira-
tion of the assembled guests, performed an extempora-
neous No-Popery Dance.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
THE applause which the performance of Hugh and his
new friend elicited from the company at The Boot had
not yet subsided, and the two dancers were still panting
from their exertions, which had been of a rather extreme
and violent character, when the party was reinforced
by the arrival of some more guests, who, being a de-
tachment of United Bulldogs, were received with very
flattering marks of distinction and respect.
The leader of this small party-for, including himself,
they were but three in number—was our old acquaint-
ance, Mr. Tappertit, who seemed, physically speaking,
to have grown smaller with years (particularly as to his
legs, which were stupendously little), but who, in a
moral point of view, in personal dignity and self-
esteem, had swelled into a giant. Nor was it by any
means difficult for the most unobservant person to de-
tect this state of feeling in the quandam Prentice, for
it not only proclaimed itself impressively and beyond
mistake in his majestic walk and kindling eye, but found
a striking means of revelation in his turned-up nose,
which scouted all things of earth with deep disdain, and
sought communion with its kindred skies.
Mr. Tappertit, as chief or captain of the Bulldogs,
was attended by his two lieutenants; one, the tall com-
rade of his younger life; the other, a 'Prentice Knight in
days of yore-Mark Gilbert, bound in the olden time to
Thomas Curzon of the Golden Fleece. These gentle-
men, like himself, were now emancipated from their

307
'prentice thraldom, and served as journeymen; but they
were, in humble emulation of his great example, bold
and daring spirits, and aspired to a distinguished state
in great political events. Hence their connection with
the Protestant Association of England, sanctioned by
the name of Lord George Gordon; and hence their
present visit to The Boot.
“Gentlemen!” said Mr. Tappertit, taking off his hat
as a great general might in addressing his troops.
“Well met. My lord does me and you the honour to
send his compliments per self.”
“You've seen my lord, too, have you?” said Dennis.
“ I see him this afternoon."
“My duty called me to the Lobby when our shop shut
up; and I saw him there, sir,” Mr. Tappertit replied, as
he and his lieutenants took their seats. "How do you do?"
“Lively, master, lively,” said the fellow. “Here's a
new brother, regularly put down in black and white by
Muster Gashford; a credit to the cause; one of the stick-
at-nothing sort; one arter my own heart. D’ye see him?
Has he got the looks of a man that'll do, do you think?"
he cried, as he slapped Hugh on the back.
“Looks or no looks,” said Hugh, with a drunken
flourish of his arm, “ I'm the man you want. I hate the
Papists, every one of 'em. They hate me and I hate
them. They do me all the harm they can, and I'll do
them all the harm I can. Hurrah!”
“Was there ever,” said Dennis, looking round the
room when the echo of his boisterous voice had died
away, “was there ever such a game boy! Why, I mean
to say, brothers, that if Muster Gashford had gone a
hundred mile and got together fifty men of the common
run, they wouldn't have been worth this one."
The greater part of the company implicitly subscribed
to this opinion, and testified their faith in Hugh by nods
and looks of great significance. Mr. Tappertit sat and
contemplated him for a long time in silence, as if he
suspended his judgment; then drew a little nearer to
him, and eyed him over more carefully; then went close
up to him, and took him apart into a dark corner.
" I say,” he began, with a thoughtful brow, “haven't
I seen you before?"
“It's like you may,” said Hugh, in his careless way.
“I don't know; shouldn't wonder.”

BARNABY RUDGE.
“No, but it's very easily settled,” returned Sim. “Look
at me. Did you ever see me before? You wouldn't be
likely to forget it, you know, if you ever did. Look at
me. Don't be afraid, I won't do you any harm. Take
a good look-steady now.”
The encouraging way in which Mr. Tappertit made
this request, and coupled it with an assurance that he
needn't be frightened, amused Hugh mightily—so much,
indeed, that he saw nothing at all of the small man be-
fore him, through closing his eyes in a fit of hearty
laughter, which shook his great broad sides until they
ached again.
“Come!” said Mr. Tappertit, growing a little impa-
tient under this disrespectful treatment. “Do you know
me, feller?”
"Not I,” cried Hugh. “Ha, ha, ha! Not I! But I
should like to.”
“And yet I'd have wagered a seven-shilling piece,"
said Mr. Tappertit, folding his arms, and confronting
him with his legs wide apart and firmly planted on the
ground, “that you once were hostler at the Maypole.”
Hugh opened his eyes on hearing this, and looked at
him in great surprise.
6--And so you were, too,” said Mr. Tappertit, push-
ing him away, with a condescending playfulness.
“When did my eyes ever deceive-unless it was a young
woman! Don't you know me now?"
“Why, it an't-” Hugh faltered.
“An't it?" said Mr. Tappertit. “Are you sure of
that? You remember G. Varden, don't you?”
Certainly Hugh did, and he remembered D. Varden
too; but that he didn't tell him.
“You remember coming down there, before I was out
of my time, to ask after a vagabond that had bolted off,
and left his disconsolate father a prey to the bitterest
emotions, and all the rest of it—don't you?” said Mr.
Tappertit.
Of course I do!” cried Hugh. “And I saw you
there.”
“Saw me there!” said Mr. Tappertit. “Yes, I should
think you did see me there. The place would be trouled
to go on without me. Don't you remember my thinking
you liked the vagabond, and on that account going to
quarrel with you; and then finding you detested him

worse than poison, going to drink with you? Don't you
remember that?”
“To be sure,” cried Hugh.
“Well! and are you in the same mind now?” said Mr.
Tappertit.
« Yes!” roared Hugh.
“You speak like a man,” said Mr. Tappertit, “and
I'll shake hands with you.” With these conciliatory ex-
pressions he suited the action to the word; and Hugh
meeting his advances readily, they performed the cere-
mony with a show of great heartiness.
“I find," said Mr. Tappertit, looking round on the as-
sembled guests, “that brother What's-his-name and I
are old acquaintance. You never heard anything more
of that rascal, I suppose, eh?”
“Not a syllable," replied Hugh. “I never want to. I
don't believe I ever shall. He's dead long ago, I
hope."
*It's to be hoped, for the sake of mankind in general
and the happiness of society, that he is,” said Mr.
Tappertit, rubbing his palm upon his legs, and looking
at it between whiles. “Is your other hand at all
cleaner? Much the same. Well, I'll owe you another
shake. We'll suppose it done, if you've no objection.”
Hugh laughed again, and with such thorough aban-
donment to his mad humour, that his limbs seemed dis-
located, and his whole frame in danger of tumbling to
pieces; but Mr. Tappertit, so far from receiving this ex-
treme merriment with any irritation, was pleased to
regard it with the utmost favour, and even to join in it,
so far as one of his gravity and station could, with any
regard to that decency and decorum which men in high
places are expected to maintain.
Mr. Tappertit did not stop here, as many public char-
acters might have done, but calling up his brace of lieu-
tenants, introduced Hugh to them with high commenda-
tion; declaring him to be a man who, at such times as
those in which they lived, could not be too much
cherished. Further, he did him the honour to remark
that he would be an acquisition of which even the
United Bulldogs might be proud; and finding, upon
sounding him, that he was quite ready and willing to
enter the society (for he was not at all particular, and
would have leagued himself that night with anything,
regard it witment with an so far from rec

or anybody, for any purpose whatsoever), caused the
necessary preliminaries to be gone into upon the spot.
This tribute to his great merit delighted no man more
than Mr. Dennis, as he himself declared with several
rare and surprising oaths; and indeed it gave unmingled
satisfaction to the whole assembly.
“Make anything you like of me!” cried Hugh, flour-
ishing the can he had emptied more than once. “Put
me on any duty you please. I'm your man. I'll do it.
Here's my captain-here's my leader. Ha, ha, ha! Let
him give me the word of command, and I'll fight the
whole Parliament House single-handed, or set a lighted
torch to the King's Throne itself!" With that he smote
Mr. Tappertit on the back with such violence that his
little body seemed to shrink into a mere nothing; and
roared again until the very foundlings near at hand were
startled in their beds.
In fact, a sense of something whimsical in their com-
panionship seemed to have taken entire possession of
his rude brain. The bare fact. of being patronised by a
great man whom he could have crushed with one hand,
appeared in his eyes so eccentric and humourous, that a
kind of ferocious merriment gained the mastery over
him, and quite subdued his brutal nature. He roared
and roared again; toasted Mr. Tappertit a hundred times;
declared himself a Bulldog to the core; and vowed to be
faithful to him to the last drop of blood in his veins.
All these compliments Mr. Tappertit received as
matters of course—flattering enough in their way, but
entirely attributable to his vast superiority. His digni-
fied self-possession only delighted Hugh the more; and,
in a word, the giant and dwarf struck up a friendship
which bade fair to be of long continuance, as the one
held it to be his right to command, and the other con-
sidered it an exquisite pleasantry to obey. Nor was
Hugh by any means a passive follower, who scrupled to
act without precise and definite orders; for when Mr.
Tappertit mounted on an empty cask which stood by
way of rostrum in the room, and volunteered a speech
upon the alarming crisis then at hand, he placed himself
beside the orator, and though he grinned from ear to ear
at every word he said, threw out such expressive hints to
scoffers in the management of his cudgel, that those who
were at first the most disposed to interrupt, became re-

remarkably attentive, and were the loudest in their ap-
probation.
It was not all noise and jest, however, at The Boot,
nor were the whole party listeners to the speech. There
were some men at the other end of the room (which was
a long, low-roofed chamber) in earnest conversation all
the time; and when any of this group went out, fresh
people were sure to come in soon afterwards and sit
down in their places, as though the others had relieved
them on some watch or duty; which it was pretty clear
they did, for these changes took place by the clock, at
intervals of half an hour. These persons whispered very
much among themselves, and kept aloof, and often
looked round, as jealous of their speech being overheard;
some two or three among them entered in books what
seemed to be reports from the others; when they were
not thus employed, one of them would turn to the news-
papers which were strewn upon the table, and from the
St. James's Chronicle, the Herald, Chronicle, or Public
Advertiser, would read to the rest in a low voice some
passage having reference to the topic in which they were
all so deeply interested. But the great attraction was a
pamphlet called The Thunderer, which espoused their
own opinions, and was supposed at that time to emanate
directly from the Association. This was always in re-
quest; and whether read aloud, to an eager knot of listen-
ers, or by some solitary man, was certain to be followed
by stormy talking and excited looks.
In the midst of all his merriment, and admiration of
his captain, Hugh was made sensible by these and other
tokens of the presence of an air of mystery, akin to that
which had so much impressed him out of doors. It was
impossible to discard a sense that something serious was
going on, and that under the noisy revel of the public-
house there lurked unseen and dangerous matter. Little
affected by this, however, he was perfectly satisfied with
his quarters, and would have remained there till morn-
ing, but that his conductor rose soon after midnight, to
go home; Mr. Tappertit following his example, left him
no excuse to stay. So they all three left the house
together; roaring a No-Popery song until the fields
resounded with the dismal noise.
“Cheer up, captain!” cried Hugh, when they had
roared themselves out of breath. “Another stave!"

Mr. Tappertit, nothing loth, began again; and so the
three went staggering on, arm-in-arm, shouting like
madmen, and defying the watch with great valour. In-
deed this did not require any unusual bravery or bold-
ness, as the watchmen of that time, being selected for
the office on account of excessive age and extraordinary
infirmity, had a custom of shutting themselves up tight
in their boxes on the first symptoms of disturbance, and
remaining there until they disappeared. In these pro-
ceedings Mr. Dennis, who had a gruff voice and lungs
of considerable power, distinguished himself very much,
and acquired great credit with his two companions.
“What a queer fellow you are!” said Mr. Tappertit.
“You're so precious sly and close. Why don't you ever
tell what trade you're of ?”
“Answer the captain instantly," cried Hugh, beating
his hat down on his head; “why don't you ever tell
what trade you're of?”
“I'm of as gen-teel a calling, brother, as any man in
England-as light a business as any gentleman could
desire.”
“ Was you 'prenticed to it?" asked Mr. Tappertit.
“No. Natural genius,” said Mr. Dennis. *No'pren-
ticing. It come by natur'. Muster Gashford knows
my calling. Look at that hand of mine-many and
many a job that hand has done with a neatness and dex-
terity never known afore. When I look at that hand,”
said Mr. Dennis, shaking it in the air, “and remember
the helegant bits of work it has turned off, I feel quite
molloncholy to think it should ever grow old and feeble.
But sich is life!”
He heaved a deep sigh as he indulged in these reflec-
tions, and putting his fingers with an absent air on
Hugh's throat, and particularly under his left ear, as if
he were studying the anatomical development of that
part of his frame, shook his head in a despondent man-
ner and actually shed tears.
"You're a kind of artist, I suppose-eh!” said Mr.
Tappertit.
** Yes," rejoined Dennis; “yes-I may call myself a
artisi-a fancy workman-art improves natur—that's
my motto.”
*And what do you call this?” said Mr. Tappertit, taking
his stick out of his hand.

"That's my portrait atop,” Dennis replied; “d'ye
think it's like?”
“Why, it's a little too handsome,” said Mr. Tappertit.
“Who did it? You?"
“I!” repeated Dennis, gazing fondly on his image.
“I wish I had the talent. That was carved by a friend
of mine, as is now no more. The very day afore he died
he cut that with his pocket-knife from memory! I'll
die game,' says my friend,' and my last moments shall
be dewoted to making Dennis's picter.' That's it.”
“That was a queer fancy, wasn't it?” said Mr. Tap-
pertit.
" It was a queer fancy,” rejoined the other, breathing
on his fictitious nose, and polishing it with the cuff of
his coat, “but he was a queer subject altogether—a kind
of gipsy-one of the finest, stand-up men you ever see.
Ah! He told me some things that would startle you a
bit, did that friend of mine, on the morning when he
died.”
“You were with him at the time, were you?” said Mr.
Tappertit.
** Yes,” he answered, with a curious look, “I was there.
Oh! yes, certainly I was there. He wouldn't have gone
off half as comfortable without me. I had been with
three or four of his family under the same circumstances.
They were all fine fellows.”
“They must have been fond of you,” remarked Mr.
Tappertit, looking at him sideways.
"I don't know that they were exactly fond of me,”
said Dennis, with a little hesitation, “but they all had
me near 'em when they departed. I come in for their
wardrobes, too. This very handkecher that you see
round my neck belonged to him that I've been speak-
ing of-him as did that likeness.”
· Mr. Tappertit glanced at the article referred to, and
appeared to think that the deceased's ideas of dress were
of a peculiar and by no means an expensive kind. He
made no remark upon the point, however, and suffered
his mysterious companion to proceed without inter-
ruption.
*These smalls,” said Dennis, rubbing his legs; "these
very smalls—they belonged to a friend of mine that's
left off sich incumbrances forever; this coat, too-I've
often walked behind this coat in the streets and won-

dered whether it would ever come to me; this pair of
shoes have danced a hornpipe for another man afore my
eyes full half-a-dozen times a least: and as to my hat,"
he said, taking it off and whirling it round upon his fist
-“Lord! I've seen this hat go up Holborn on the box
of a hackney-coach-ah, many and many a day!”
“You don't mean to say their old wearers are all
dead, I hope?" said Mr. Tappertit, falling a little distance
from him as he spoke.
“Every one of 'em,” replied Dennis. “Every man
Jack!"
There was something so very ghastly in this circum-
stance and it appeared to account, in such a very strange
and dismal manner, for his faded dress—which, in this
new aspect, seemed discoloured by the earth from graves
—that Mr. Tappertit abruptly found he was going an-
other way, and, stopping short, bade him good-night
with the utmost heartiness. As they happened to be
near the Old Bailey, and Mr. Dennis knew there were
turnkeys in the lodge with whom he could pass the
night and discuss professional subjects of common in-
terest among them before a rousing fire and over a so-
cial glass, he separated from his companions without
any great regret, and warmly shaking hands with Hugh,
and making an early appointment for their meeting at
The Boot, left them to pursue their road.
“That's a strange sort of man,” said Mr. Tappertit,
watching the hackney-coachman's hat as it went bob-
bing down the street. “I don't know what to make of
him. Why can't he have his smalls made to order, or
wear live clothes, at any rate ?”
“He's a lucky man, captain,” cried Hugh. “I should
like to have such friends as his."
“I hope he don't get 'em to make their wills, and then
knock 'em on the head,” said Mr. Tappertit, musing.
“But come. The United B.'s expect me. On !-What's
the matter ?”
“I quite forgot,” said Hugh, who had started at the
striking of a neighbouring clock. “I have somebody
to see to-night-I must turn back directly. The drink-
ing and singing put it out of my head. It's well I re-
membered it !"
Mr. Tappertit looked at him as though he were about
to give utterance to some very majestic sentiments in

reference to this act of desertion, but as it was clear,
from Hugh's hasty manner, that the engagement was
one of a pressing nature, he graciously forbore, and
gave him his permission to depart immediately, which
Hugh acknowledged with a roar of laughter.
“Good-night, captain,” he cried. “I am yours to the
death, remember!”
“Farewell !” said Mr. Tappertit, waving his hand.
“Be bold and vigilant.”
“No Popery, captain!" roared Hugh.
“ England in blood first!” cried his desperate leader.
Whereat Hugh cheered and laughed, and ran off like a
greyhound.
"That man will prove a credit to my corps,” said
Simon, turning thoughtfully upon his heel. “And let
me see. In an altered state of society-which must
ensue if we break out and are victorious—when the
locksmith's child is mine, Miggs must be got rid of some-
how, or she'll poison the tea-kettle one evening when
I'm out. He might marry Miggs, if he was drunk
enough. It shall be done. I'll make a note of it."
CHAPTER XL.
LITTLE thinking of the plan for his happy settlement
in life which had suggested itself to the teeming brain
of his provident commander, Hugh made no pause until
Saint Dunstan's giants struck the hour above him, when
he worked the handle of a pump which stood hard by,
with great vigour, and thrusting his head under the
spout, let the water gush upon him until a little stream
ran down from every uncombed hair, and he was wet to
the waist. Considerably refreshed by this ablution,
both in mind and body, and almost sobered for the time,
he dried himself as best he could; then crossed the road,
and plied the knocker of the Middle Temple gate.
The night-porter looked through a small grating in
the portal with a surly eye, and cried “Halloa!” which
greeting Hugh returned in kind, and bade him open
quickly.
“We don't sell beer here,” cried the man; “ what else
do you want?”

BARNABY RUDGE.
“To come in,” Hugh replied, with a kick at the door.
"Where to go to?"
“ Paper-Buildings.”
“ Whose chambers?”
“Sir John Chester's." Each of which answers he em-
phasised with another kick.
After a little growling on the other side, the gate was
opened, and he passed in: undergoing a close inspection
from the porter as he did so.
“You wanting Sir John at this time of night!” said
the man.
“Ay!” said Hugh. “I! What of that?”
“Why, I must go with you, and see that you do, for I
don't believe it.”
“Come along, then.”
Eyeing him with suspicious looks, the man, with key
and lantern, walked on at his side, and attended him to
Sir John Chester's door, at which Hugh gave one knock,
that echoed through the dark staircase like a ghostly
summons, and made the dull light tremble in the drowsy
lamp.
“Do you think he wants me now?” said Hugh.
Before the man had time to answer, a footstep was
heard within, a light appeared, and Sir John, in his
dressing-gown and slippers, opened the door.
“I ask your pardon, Sir John,” said the porter, pulling
off his hat. “Here's a young man says he wants to
speak to you. It's late for strangers. I thought it best
to see that all was right.”
"Aha!” cried Sir John, raising his eyebrows. “It's
you, messenger, is it? Go in. Quite right, friend, I
commend your prudence highly. Thank you. God bless
you. Good-night.”
To be commended, thanked, God-blessed, and bade
good-night by one who carried “Sir” before his name,
and wrote himself M. P. to boot, was something for a
porter. He withdrew with much humility and rever-
ence. Sir John followed his late visitor into the dress-
ing-room, and sitting in his easy chair before the fire,
and moving it so that he could see him as he stood, hat
in hand, beside the door, looked at him from head to
foot.
The old face, calm and pleasant as ever; the complex-
ion quite juvenile in its bloom and clearness; the same

smile; the wonted precision and elegance of dress; the
white, well-ordered teeth; the delicate hands; the com-
posed and quiet manner; everything as it used to be: no
marks of age or passion, envy, hate, or discontent: all
unruffled and serene, and quite delightful to behold.
He wrote himself M. P.--but how? Why, thus. It
was a proud family--more proud, indeed, than wealthy.
He had stood in danger of arrest; of bailiffs, and a jail
-a vulgar jail, to which the common people with small
incomes went. Gentlemen of ancient houses have no
privilege of exemption from such cruel laws-unless
they are of one great house, and then they have. A
proud man of his stock and kindred had the means of
sending him there. He offered—not indeed to pay his
debts, but to let him sit for a close borough until his own
son came of age, which, if he lived, would come to pass in
twenty years. It was quite as good as an Insolvent Act,
and infinitely more genteel. So Sir John Chester was a
member of Parliament.
But how Sir John? Nothing so simple, or so easy.
One touch with a sword of state, and the transforma-
tion is effected. John Chester, Esquire, M. P., attended
court—went up with an address-headed a deputation.
Such elegance of manner, so many graces of deportment,
such powers of conversation, could never pass unno-
ticed. Mr. was too common for such merit. A man so
gentlemanly should have been-but Fortune is capri-
cious-born a Duke: just as some Dukes should have
been born labourers. He caught the fancy of the king,
knelt down a grub, and arose a butterfly. John Chester,
Esquire, was knighted and became Sir John.
"I thought when you left me this evening, my esteemed
acquaintance,” said Sir John, after a pretty long silence,
“that you intended to return with all despatch?”
“So I did, master.”
“And so you have?” he retorted, glancing at his watch.
“Is that what you would say?”
Instead of replying, Hugh changed the leg on which
he leant, shuffled his cap from one hand to the other,
looked at the ground, the wall, the ceiling, and finally
at Sir John himself; before whose pleasant face he low-
ered his eyes again, and fixed them on the floor.
“And how have you been employing yourself in the
meanwhile?” quoth Sir John, lazily crossing his legs.

BARNABY RUDGE.
“Where have you been? what harm have you been
doing?”
6 No harm at all, master,” growled Hugh, with hu-
mility. I have only done as you ordered.”
“ As I what?" returned Sir John.
“Well then,” said Hugh, uneasily, “as you advised,
or said I ought, or said I might, or said that you
would do if you was me. Don't be so hard upon me,
master.”
Something like an expression of triumph in the perfect
control he had established over this rough instrument
appeared in the knight's face for an instant; but it
vanished directly, as he said-paring his nails while
speaking:
“When you say I ordered you, my good fellow, you
imply that I directed you to do something for me—some-
thing I wanted done-something for my own ends and
purposes—you see? Now I am sure I needn't enlarge
upon the extreme absurdity of such an idea, however
unintentional; so please, and here he turned his eyes
upon him-“to be more guarded. Will you?”
“I meant to give you no offence,” said Hugh. “I
don't know what to say. You catch me up so very
short.”
“ You will be caught up much shorter, my good friend
-infinitely shorter-one of these days, depend upon it,”
replied his patron, calmly. “By-the-bye, instead of
wondering why you have been so long, my wonder
should be why you came at all. Why did you?”
“ You know, master," said Hugh, “that I couldn't
read the bill I fourd, and that supposing it to be some-
thing particular from the way it was wrapped up, I
brought it here.”
“And could you ask no one else to read it, Bruin?”
said Sir John.
“No one that I could trust with secrets, master.
Since Barnaby Rudge was lost sight of for good and all-
and that's five years ago I haven't talked with any one
but you."
“You have done me honour, I am sure.”
“I have come to and fro, master, all through that
time, when there was anything to tell, because I knew
that you'd be angry with me if I stayed away,” said
Hugh, blurting the words qut, after an embarrassed

319
silence; "and because I wished to please you, if I could,
and not to have you go against me. There. That's the
true reason why I came to-night. You know that, master,
I am sure.”
“You are a specious fellow," returned Sir John, fix-
ing his eyes upon him, “and carry two faces under
your hood, as well as the best. Didn't you give me in
this room, this evening, any other reason; no dislike of
anybody who has slighted you, lately, on all occasions,
abused you, treated you with rudeness, acted towards
you, more as if you were a mongrel dog than a man
like himself?”
“To be sure I did!” cried Hugh, his passion rising, as
the other meant it should; “and I say it all over now,
again. I'd do anything to have some revenge on him,
anything. And when you told me that he and the
Catholics would suffer from those who joined together
under that handbill, I said I'd make one of 'em, if their
master was the devil himself. I am one of 'em. See
whether I am as good as my word, and turn out to be
among the foremost or no. I mayn't have much head,
master, but I've head enough to remember those that
use me ill. You shall see, and so shall he, and so shall
hundreds more, how my spirit backs me when the time
comes. My bark is nothing to my bite. Some that I
know had better have a wild lion among 'em than me,
when I am fairly loose-they had!”
The knight looked at him with a smile of far deeper
meaning than ordinary; and pointing to the old cup-
board, followed him with his eyes while he filled and
drank a glass of liquor; and smiled when his back was
turned, with deeper meaning yet.
“You are in a blustering mood, my friend,” he said,
wben Hugh confronted him again.
“Not I, master!” cried Hugh. “I don't say half I
mean. I can't. I haven't got the gift. There are
talkers enough among us; I'll be one of the doers.”
"Oh! you have joined those fellows, then?" said Sir
John, with an air of most profound indifference.
“Yes. I went up to the house you told me of, and
got put down upon the muster. There was another man
there named Dennis—”
“ Dennis, eh!” cried Sir John, laughing. “Ay, ay) a
pleasant fellow, I believe?”

“A roaring dog, master-one after my own heart-
hot upon the matter too-red-hot.”
“So I have heard,” replied Sir John, carelessly. “You
don't happen to know his trade, do you?”
“He wouldn't say,” cried Hugh. " He keeps it secret."
“Ha, ha!" laughed Sir John, “A strange fancy-a
weakness with some persons-you'll know it one day, I
dare swear!"
“We're intimate already,” said Hugh.
“Quite natural! And have been drinking together,
eh?” pursued Sir John. “Did you say what place you
went to in company, when you left Lord George's?”
Hugh had not said or thought of saying, but he told
him; and this inquiry being followed by a long train of
questions, he related all that had passed both in and out
of doors, the kind of people he had seen, their numbers,
state of feeling, mode of conversation, apparent expec-
tations and intentions. His questioning was so artfully
contrived, that he seemed even in his own eyes to vol-
unteer all this information, rather than to have it
wrested from him; and he was brought to this state of
feeling so naturally, than when Mr. Chester yawned at
length and declared himself quite wearied out, he made
a rough kind of excuse for having talked so much.
“There-get you gone,” said Sir John, holding the
door open in his hand. “You have made a pretty even-
ing's work. I told you not to do this. You may get
into trouble. You'll have an opportunity of revenging
yourself on your proud friend Haredale, though, and
for that you'd hazard anything, I suppose?"
“I would,” retorted Hugh, stopping in his passage
out and looking back; “but what do I risk! What do I
stand a chance of losing, master? Friends, home? A
fig for 'em all; I have none; they are nothing to me.
Give me a good scuffle; let me pay off old scores in a
bold riot where there are men to stand by me; and then
use me as you like it don't matter much to me what
the end is!”
“What have you done with that paper?” said Sir John.
“I have it here, master.”
“Drop it again as you go along, it's as well not to
keep such things about you”
Hugh nodded, and touching his cap with an air of as
much respect as he could summon up, departed.

Sir John, fastening the doors behind him, went back
to his dressing-room, and sat down once again before
the fire, at which he gazed for a long time, in earnest
meditation.
“ This happens fortunately," he said, breaking into a
smile; “ and promises well. Let me see. My relative
and I, who are the most Protestant fellows in the world,
give our worst wishes to the Roman Catholic cause; and
to Saville, who introduces their bill, I have a personal
objection besides; but as each of us has himself for the
first article in his creed, we cannot commit ourselves by
joining with a very extravagant madman, such as this
Gordon most undoubtedly is. Now, really, to foment
his disturbances in secret, through the medium of such
a very apt instrument as my savage friend here, may
further our real ends; and to express at all becoming
seasons, in moderate and polite terms, a disapprobation
of his proceedings, though we agree with him in princi-
ple, will certainly be to gain a character for honesty and
uprightness of purpose, which cannot fail to do us infinite
service, and to raise us into some importance. Good!
So much for public grounds. As to private considera-
tions, I confess that if these vagabonds would make
some. riotous demonstration (which does not appear
impossible), and would inflict some little chastisement
on Haredale as a not inactive man among his sect, it
would be extremely agreeable to my feelings, and
would amuse me beyond measure. Good again! Per-
haps better!"
· When he came to this point he took a pinch of snuff;
then beginning slowly to undress, he resumed his medi-
tations, by saying, with a smile:
“I fear, I do fear exceedingly, that my friend is fol-
lowing fast in the footsteps of his mother. His intimacy
with Mr. Dennis is very ominous. But I have no doubt
he must have come to that end any way. If I lend him
a helping hand the only difference is that he may, upon
the whole, drink a few gallons, or puncheons, or hogs-
heads less in this life than he otherwise would. It's no
business of mine. It's a matter of very small im-
portance!”.
So he took another pinch of snuff and went to bed.

BARNABY RUDGE.
CHAPTER XLI.
FROM the workshop of the Golden Key there issued
forth a tinkling sound, so merry and good-humoured
that it suggested the idea of some one working blithely,
and made quite pleasant music. No man who ham-
mered on a dull, monotonous duty could have brought
such cheerful notes from steel and iron; none but a
chirping, healthy, honest-hearted fellow, who made the
best of everything, and felt kindly towards everybody,
could have done it for an instant. He might have been
a coppersmith, and still been musical. If he had sat in
a jolting wagon, full of rods of iron, it seemed as if he
would have brought some harmony out of it.
Tink, tink, tink-clear as a silver bell, and audible at
every pause of the streets' harsher noises, as though it
said, “I don't care; nothing puts me out; I am resolved
to be happy.” Women scolded, children squalled, heavy
carts went rumbling by, horrible cries proceeded from
the lungs of hawkers; still it struck in again, no higher,
no lower, no louder, no softer; not thrusting itself on
people's notice a bit the more for having been outdone
by louder sounds—tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.
It was a perfect embodiment of the still small voice,
free from all cold, hoarseness, huskiness, or unhealthi-
ness of any kind; foot-passengers slackened their pace,
and were disposed to linger near it; neighbours who had
got up splenetic that morning felt good-humour stealing
on them as they heard it, and by degrees became quite
sprightly; mothers danced their babies to its ringing;
still the same magical tink, tink, tink, came gaily from
the workshop of the Golden Key.
Who but the locksmith could have made such music!
A gleam of sun shining through the unsashed window,
and chequering the dark workshop with a broad patch
of light, fell upon him, as though attracted by his sunny
heart. There he stood working at his anvil, his face all
radiant with exercise and gladness, his sleeves turned
up, his wig pushed off his shining forehead-the easiest,
freest, happiest man in all the world. Beside him sat a
sleek cat, purring and winking in the light, and falling

every now and then into an idle doze, as from excess of
comfort. Toby looked on from a tall bench hard by; one
beaming smile, from his broad nut-brown face down to
the slack-baked buckles in his shoes. The very locks
that hung around had something jovial in their rust,
and seemed like gouty gentlemen of hearty natures,
disposed to joke on their infirmities. There was nothing
surly or severe in the whole scene. It seemed impossible
that any one of the innumerable keys could fit a churlish
strong-box or a prison-door. Cellars of beer and wine,
rooms where there were fires, books, gossip and cheering
laughter—these were their proper sphere of action.
Places of distrust and cruelty, and restraint, they would
have left quadruple-locked forever.
Tink, tink, tink. The locksmith paused at last, and
wiped his brow. The silence roused the cat, who, jump-
ing softly down, crept to the door, and watched with
tiger eyes a bird-cage in an opposite window. Gabriel
lifted Toby to his mouth, and took a hearty draught.
Then, as he stood upright, with his head flung back,
and his portly chest thrown out, you would have seen
that Gabriel's lower man was clothed in military gear.
Glancing at the wall beyond, there might have been
espied, hanging on their several pegs, a cap and feather,
broad-sword, sash, and coat of scarlet; which any man
learned in such matters would have known from their
make and pattern to be the uniform of a serjeant in the
Royal East London Volunteers.
As the locksmith put his mug down, empty, on the
bench, whence it had smiled on him before, he glanced
at these articles with a laughing eye, and looking down
at them with his head a little on one side, as though he
would get them all into a focus, said, leaning on his
hammer:
“ Time was, now, I remember, when I was like to run
mad with the desire to wear a coat of that colour. If
any one (except my father) had called me a fool for my
pains, how I should have fired and fumed! But what a
fool I must have been, sure-ly!”
“Ah!" sighed Mrs. Varden, who had entered unob-
served. “A fool indeed. A man at your time of life,
Varden, should know better now.”
“Why, what a ridiculous woman you are, Martha,”
said the locksmith, turning round with a smile,

BARNABY RUDGE.
“Certainly," replied Mrs. V., with great demureness.
“Of course I am. I know that, Varden. Thank you."
“I mean,” began the locksmith.
« Yes,” said his wife, “I know what you mean. You
speak quite plain enough to be understood, Varden. It's
very kind of you to adapt yourself to my capacity, I am
sure.”
“ Tut, tut, Martha,” rejoined the locksmith; “ don't
take offence at nothing. I mean, how strange it is of
you to run down volunteering, when it's done to defend
you and all the other women, and our own fireside and
everybody else's, in case of need.”
“It's unchristian,” cried Mrs. Varden, shaking her
head.
“Unchristian!” said the locksmith. “Why what the
devil_”
Mrs. Varden looked at the ceiling, as in expectation
that the consequence of his profanity would be the im-
mediate descent of the four-post bedstead on the second
floor, together with the best sitting-room on the first;
but no visible judgment occurring, she heaved a deep
sigh, and begged her husband, in a tone of resignation,
to go on, and by all means to blaspheme as much as pos-
sible, because he knew she liked it.
The locksmith did for a moment seemed disposed to
gratify her, but he gave a great gulp, and mildly re-
joined:
“I was going to say, what on earth do you call it
unchristian for? Which would be most unchristian,
Martha-to sit quietly down and let our houses be sacked
by a foreign army, or to turn out like men and drive 'em
off? Shouldn't I be a nice sort of a Christian, if I crept
into a corner of my own chimney and looked on while
a parcel of whiskered savages bore off Dolly-or you?"
When he said “or you,” Mrs. Varden, despite herself,
relaxed into a smile. There was something compli-
mentary in the idea. “In such a state of things as
that, indeed -” she simpered.
“As that!” repeated the locksmith. “Well, that would
be the state of things directly. Even Miggs would go.
Some black tambourine-player, with a great turban on,
would be bearing her off, and, unless the tambourine-
player was proof against kicking and scratching, it's
my belief he'd have the worst of it. Ha, ha, ha! I'd for-

325
give the tambourine-player. I wouldn't have him inter-
fered with on any account, poor fellow.” And here
the locksmith laughed again so heartily, that tears
came into his eyes-much to Mrs. Varden's indignation,
who thought the capture of so sound a Protestant and
estimable a private character as Miggs by a pagan negro,
a circumstance too shocking and awful for contem-
plation.
The picture Gabriel had drawn, indeed, threatened
serious consequences, and would indubitably have led
to them, but luckily at that moment a light footstep
crossed the threshold, and Dolly, running in, 'threw her
arm's round her old father's neck, and hugged him
tight.
* Here she is at last” cried Gabriel. “And how well
you look, Doll, and how late you are, my darling!”
How well she looked? Well? Why, if he had ex-
hausted every laudatory adjective in the dictionary, it
wouldn't have been praise enough. When and where
was there ever such a plump, roguish, comely, bright-
eyed, enticing, bewitching, captivating, maddening little
puss in all this world, as Dolly! What was the Dolly of
five years ago, to the Dolly of that day! How many
coach-makers, saddlers, cabinet-makers, and professors
of other useful arts, had deserted their fathers, mothers,
sisters, brothers, and, most of all, their cousins, for the
love of her! How many unknown gentlemen-supposed
to be of mighty fortunes, if not titleshad waited round
the corner after dark, and tempted Miggs the incorrupt-
ible, with golden guineas, to deliver offers of marriage
folded up in love-letters! How many disconsolate
fathers and substantial tradesmen had waited on the
locksmith for the same purpose, with dismal tales of how
their sons had lost their appetites, and taken to shut
themselves up in dark bedrooms, and wandering in deso-
late suburbs with pale faces, and all because of Dolly
Varden's loveliness and cruelty! How many young
men, in all previous times of unprecedented steadiness,
had turned suddenly wild and wicked for the same rea-
son, and, in ecstacy of unrequited love, taken to wrench
off door-knockers, and invert the boxes of rheumatic
watchmen! How had she recruited the king's service,
both by sea and land, through rendering desperate his
loving subjects between the ages of eighteen and twenty-

five! How many young ladies had publicly professed,
with tears in their eyes, that for their tastes she was
much too short, too tall, too bold, too cold, too stout, too
thin, too fair, too dark-too everything but handsome!
How many old ladies, taking counsel together, had
thanked Heaven their daughters were not like her, and
had hoped she might come to no harm, and had thought
she would come to no good, and had wondered what
people saw in her, and had arrived at the conclusion
that she was “ going off” in her looks, or had never
come on in them, and that she was a thorough imposi-
tion and a popular mistake!
And yet here was this same Dolly Varden, so whim-
sical and hard to please that she was Dolly Varden still,
all smiles and dimples, and pleasant looks, and caring
no more for the fifty or sixty young fellows who at that
very moment were breaking their hearts to marry her,
than if so many oysters had been crossed in love and
opened afterwards.
Dolly hugged her father, as has been already stated,
and having hugged her mother also, accompanied both
into the little parlour, where the cloth was already laid
for dinner, and where Miss Miggs—a trifle more rigid
and bony than of yore-received her with a sort of
hysterical gasp, intended for a smile. Into the hands
of that young virgin she delivered her bonnet and walk-
ing dress (all of a dreadful, artful, and designing kind),
and then said with a laugh, which rivalled the lock-
smith's music, “How glad I always am to be at home
again!”
** And how glad we always are, Doll,” said her father,
putting back the dark hair from her sparkling eyes, “to
have you at home. Give me a kiss.”
If there had been anybody of the male kind there to
see her do it, but there was not; it. was a mercy.”
“I don't like your being at the Warren,” said the lock-
smith, “I can't bear to have you out of my sight. And
what is the news over yonder, Doll?”
“What news there is I think you know already," 1
plied his daughter. “I am sure you do, though.”
“Ay?” cried the locksmith. “What's that?"
“Come, come,” said Dolly, “ you know very well. I
want you to tell me why Mr. Haredale-oh, how gruff
he is again, to be sure—has been away from home for

327
some days past, and why he is travelling about (we know
he is travelling, because of his letters) without telling
his own niece why or wherefore.”
“Miss Emma doesn't want to know, I'll swear," re-
turned the locksmith.
“I don't know that,” said Dolly ; “but I do, at any
rate. Do tell me. Why is he so secret, and what is this
ghost story, which nobody is to tell Miss Emma, and
which seems to be mixed up with his going away ? Now
I see you know by your colouring so.”
“What the story means or is, or has to do with it, I
know no more than you, my dear,” returned the lock-
smith, "except that it's some foolish fear of little Solo-
mon's—which has, indeed, no meaning in it, I suppose.
As to Mr. Haredale's journey, he goes, as I believe-"
“Yes,” said Dolly.
“As I believe,” resumed the locksmith, pinching her
cheek, “ on business, Doll. What it may be, is quite
another matter. Read Blue Beard, and don't be too
curious, pet; it's no business of yours or mine, depend
upon that; and here's dinner, which is much more to
the purpose.”
Dolly might have remonstrated against this summary
dismissal of the subject, notwithstanding the appearance
of dinner, but at the mention of Blue Beard Mrs. Varden
interposed, protesting she could not find it in her con-
science to sit tamely by and hear her child recommended
to peruse the adventures of a Turk and Mussulman-far
less of a fabulous Turk, which she considered that
potentate to be. She held that in such stirring and
tremendous times as those in which they lived, it would
be much more to the purpose if Dolly became a regular
subscriber to the Thunderer, where she would have an
opportunity of reading Lord George Gordon's speeches
word for word, which would be a greater comfort and
solace to her, than a hundred and fifty Blue Beards ever
could impart. She appealed in support of this propo-
sition to Miss Miggs, then in waiting, who said that in-
deed the peace of mind she had derived from the perusal
of that paper generally, but especially of one article of
the very last week as ever was, entitled “Great Britain
drenched in gore,” exceeded all belief; the same compo-
sition, she added, had also wrought such a comforting
effect on the mind of a married sister of hers, then resi-

dent at Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin, second
bell-handle on the right hand door-post, that, being in a
delicate state of health, and in fact, expecting an ad-
dition to her family, she had been seized with fits directly
after its perusal, and had raved of the inquisition ever
since; to the great improvement of her husband and
friends. Miss Miggs went on to say that she would
recommend all those whose hearts were hardened to
hear Lord George themselves, whom she commended
first, in respect of his steady Protestantism, then of his
oratory, then of his eyes, then of his nose, then of his
legs, and lastly of his figure generally, which she looked
upon as fit for any statue, prince, or angel, to which
sentiment Mrs. Varden fully subscribed.
Mrs. Varden having cut in, looked at a box upon the
mantel-shelf, painted in imitation of a very red-brick
dwelling-house, with a yellow roof; having at top a
real chimney, down which voluntary subscribers dropped
their silver, gold, or pence, into the parlour; and on
the door the counterfeit presentment of a brass plate,
whereon was legibly inscribed, “Protestant Associa-
tion”—and looking at it, said that it was to her a source
of poignant misery to think that Varden never had, of
all his substance, dropped anything into that temple,
save once in secret-as she afterwards discovered-two
fragments of tobacco-pipe, which she hoped would not
be put down to his last account. That Dolly, she was
grieved to say, was no less backward in her contribu-
tions, better loving, as it seemed, to purchase ribbons
and such gauds, than to encourage the great cause, then
in such heavy tribulation; and that she did entreat her
(her father she much feared could not be moved) not to
despise, but imitate, the bright example of Miss Miggs,
who flung her wages, as it were, into the very counte-
nance of the Pope, and bruised his features with her
quarter's money.
“Oh, mim,” said Miggs, “don't relude to that. I had
no intentions, mim, that nobody should know. Such
sacrifices as I can make, are quite a widder's mite. It's
all I have,” cried Miggs with a great burst of tears--for
with her they never came on by degrees—“but it's made
up to me in other ways; it's well made up.”
This was quite true, though not perhaps in the sense
that Miggs intended. As she never failed to keep her

329
self-denial full in Mrs. Varden's view, it drew forth so
many gifts of caps and gowns and other articles of dress,
that upon the whole the red-brick house was perhaps the
best investment for her small capital she could possibly
have it upon; returning her interest, at the rate of seven
or eight per cent. in money, and fifty at least in per-
sonal repute and credit.
“ You needn't cry, Miggs," said Mrs. Varden, herself
in tears, “ you needn't be ashamed of it, though your
poor mistress is on the same side.”
Miggs howled at this remark in a peculiarly dismal
way, and said she knowed that master hated her. That
it was a dreadful thing to live in families and have dis-
likes, and not give satisfactions. That to make divisions
was a thing she could not bear to think of, neither could
her feelings let her do it. That if it was master's wishes
as she and him should part, it was best they should part,
and she hoped he might be the happier for it, and always
wishes him well, and that he might find somebody as.
would meet his dispositions. It would be a hard trial,
she said, to part from such a missis, but she could meet
any suffering when her conscience told her she was in
the rights, and therefore she was willing even to go that
lengths. She did not think, she added, that she could
long survive the separations, but, as she was hated and
looked upon unpleasant, perhaps her dying as soon as
possible would be the best endings for all parties. With
this affecting conclusion, Miss Miggs shed more tears,
and sobbed abundantly.
"Can you bear this, Varden?” said his wife in a
solemn voice, laying down her knife and fork.
“Why, not very well, my dear,” rejoined the locksmith,
“but I try to keep my temper.”
“Don't let there be words on my account, mim,” sobbed
Miggs. “It's much the best that we should part. I
wouldn't stay-oh, gracious me!-and make dissen-
sions, not for a annual gold mine, and found in tea and
sugar.”
Lest the reader should be at any loss to discover the
cause of Miss Miggs's deep emotion, it may be whis-
pered apart that, happening to be listening, as her cus-
tom sometimes was, when Gabriel and his wife conversed
together, she had heard the locksmith's joke relative to
the foreign black who played the tambourine and burst-

M
ing with the spiteful feelings which the taunt awoke in
her fair breast, exploded in the manner we have wit-
nessed. Matters having now arrived at a crisis, the
locksmith, as usual, and for the sake of peace and quiet-
ness, gave in.
“What are you crying for, girl?” he said. What's the
matter with you? What are you talking about hatred
for? I don't hate you; I don't hate anybody. Dry your
eyes and make yourself agreeable, in Heaven's name,
and let us all be happy while we can.”
The allied powers deeming it good generalship to con-
sider this a sufficient apology on the part of the enemy,
and confession of having been in the wrong, did dry
their eyes and take it in good part. Miss Miggs ob-
served that she bore no malice, no not to her greatest
foe, whom she rather loved the more indeed, the greater
persecution she sustained. Mrs. Varden approved of
this meek and forgiving spirit in high terms, and inci-
.dentally declared as a closing article of agreement, that
Dolly should accompany her to the Clerkenwell branch
of the association, that very night. This was an ex-
traordinary instance of her great prudence and policy;
having had this end in view from the first, and enter-
ing a secret misgiving that the locksmith (who was bold
when Dolly was in question) would object, she had
backed Miss Miggs up to this point, in order that she
might have him at a disadvantage. The manoeuvre
succeeded so well that Gabriel only made a wry face,
and with the warning he had just had, fresh in his
mind, did not dare to say one word.
The difference ended, therefore, in Miggs being pre-
sented with a gown by Mrs. Varden and half-a-crown
by Dolly, as if she had eminently distinguished herself
in the paths of morality and goodness. Mrs. V., ac-
cording to custom, expressed her hope that Varden
would take a lesson from what had passed and learn more
generous conduct for the time to come; and the dinner
being now cold and nobody's appetite very much im-
proved by what had passed, they went on with it, as
Mrs. Varden said, “ like Christians.”
As there was to be a grand parade of the Royal East
London Volunteers that afternoon, the locksmith did no
more work; but sat down comfortably with his pipe in
his mouth, and his arm round his pretty daughter's

331
waist, looking lovingly on Mrs. V., from time to time,
and exhibiting from the crown of his head to the sole of
his foot one smiling surface of good humour. And to
be sure, when it was time to dress him in his regi-
mentals, and Dolly, hanging about him in all kinds of
graceful, winning ways, helped to button and buckle
and brush him up and get him into one of the tightest
coats that ever was made by mortal tailor, he was the
proudest father in all England.
“What a handy jade it is!” said the locksmith to Mrs.
Varden, who stood by with folded hands-rather proud
of her husband too—while Miggs held his cap and sword
at arm's length, as if mistrusting that the latter might
run some one through the body of its own accord; “but
never marry a soldier, Doll, my dear.”
Dolly didn't ask why not, or say a word, indeed, but
stooped her head down very low to tie his sash.
“I never wear this dress," said honest Gabriel, “but
I think of poor Joe Willet. I loved Joe; he was always
a favourite of mine. Poor Joe!— Dear heart, my girl,
don't tie me in so tight.”.
Dolly laughed—not like herself at all-the strangest
little laugh that could be—and held her head down lower
still.
“Poor Joe!” resumed the locksmith, muttering to him-
self; “I always wish he had come to me. I might have
made it up between them, if he had. Ah! old John made
a great mistake in his way of acting by that lad-a
great mistake. Have you nearly tied that sash, my
dear.”
What an ill-made sash it was! There it was, loose
again and trailing on the ground. Dolly was obliged to
kneel down, and recommence at the beginning.
“Never mind young Willet, Varden," said his wife,
frowning; “you might find some one more deserving to
talk about, I think.”
Miss Miggs gave a great sniff to the same effect.
“Nay, Martha,” cried the locksmith, “don't let us
bear too hard upon him. If the lad is dead indeed, we'll
deal kindly by his memory." .
“A runaway and a vagabond!” said Mrs. Varden.
Miss Miggs expressed her concurrence as before.
“A runaway, my dear, but not a vagabond,” returned
the locksmith in a gentle tone. “He behaved himself

well, did e de—always—and was a handsome, manly
fellow. Don't call him a vagabond, Martha.”
Mrs. Varden coughed-and so did Miggs.
“He tried hard to gain your good opinion, Martha, I
can tell you,” said the locksmith smiling, and stroking
his chin. “Ah! that he did. It seems but yesterday that
he followed me out to the Maypole door one night, and
begged me not to say how like a boy they used him-
say here, at home, he meant, though at the time, I re-
collect, I didn't understand. “And how's Miss Dolly,
sir?' says Joe,” pursued the locksmith, musing sorrow-
fully. * Ah! Poor Joe!”
“Well, I declare!” cried Miggs. “Oh! goodness gra-
cious me!"
“What's the matter now?” said Gabriel, turning
sharply to her.
“Why, if here an't Miss Dolly,” said the handmaid,
stooping down to look into her face, “a giving way to
floods of tears. Oh, mim! oh, sir! Raly it's give me such
a turn,” cried the susceptible damsel, pressing her hand
upon her side to quell the palpitation of her heart, “ that
you might knock me down with a feather.”
The locksmith, after glancing at Miss Miggs as if he
could have wished to have a feather brought straight-
way, looked on with a broad stare while Dolly hurried
away, followed by that sympathising young woman;
then turning to his wife, stammered out, “Is Dolly ill?
Have I done anything? Is it my fault?"
“Your fault!” cried Mrs. V., reproachfully. “There
-you had better make haste out.”
* What have I done?” said poor Gabriel. “It was
agreed that Mr. Edward's name was never to be men-
tioned, and I have not spoken of him, have I?”
Mrs. Varden merely replied that she had no patience
with him, and bounced off after the other two. The
unfortunate locksmith wound his sash about him, girded
on his sword, put on his cap, and walked out.
“I am not much of a dab at my exercise,” he said
under his breath, “but I shall get into fewer scrapes at
that work than at this. Every man came into the world
for something; my department seems to be to make
every woman cry without meaning it. It's rather hard.”
But he forgot it before he reached the end of the
street, and went on with a shining face, nodding to the

neighbours, and showering about his friendly greetings
like mild spring rain,
CHAPTER XLII.
THE Royal East London Volunteers made a brilliant
sight that day: formed into lines, squares, circles, tri-
angles and what not, to the beating of drums and the
streaming of flags; and performed a vast number of
complex evolutions, in all of which Serjeant Varden
bore a conspicuous share. Having displayed their mili-
tary prowess to the utmost in these warlike shows, they
marched in glittering order to the Chelsea Bunhouse
and regaled in the adjacent taverns until dark. Then
at sound of drum they all fell in again and returned
amidst the shouting of His Majesty's lieges to the place
from whence they came.
The homeward march being somewhat tardy-owing
to the unsoldierlike behaviour of certain corporals, who
being gentlemen of sedentary pursuits in private life and
excitable out of doors, broke several windows with their
bayonets and rendered it imperative on the commanding
officer to deliver them over to a strong guard, with
whom they fought at intervals as they came along-it
was nine o'clock when the locksmith reached home. A
hackney-coach was waiting near his door; and as he
passed it Mr. Haredale looked from the window and
called him by his name.
“The sight of you is good for sore eyes,” said the
locksmith, stepping up to him. “I wish you had walked
in though, rather than waited here."
“ There is nobody at home, I find,” Mr. Haredale an.
swered; “besides, I desired to be as private as I could.
“Humph!” muttered the locksmith, looking round ar
his house. “Gone with Simon Tappertit to that precious
Branch, no doubt.”
Mr. Haredale invited him to come into the coach, and,
if he were not tired or anxious to go home, to ride with
him a little way that they might have some talk to.
gether. Gabriel cheerfully complied, and the coachmals
mounting his box, drove off.
“Varden,” said Mr. Haredale, after a minute's pause

“ you will be amazed to hear what errand I am on; it
will seem a very strange one.”
“I have no doubt it's a reasonable one, sir, and has a
meaning in it,” replied the locksmith, “or it would not
be yours at all. Ħave you just come back to town, sir?"
“But half an hour ago.”
“Bringing no news of Barnaby or his mother?” said
the locksmith, dubiously. “Ah! you needn't shake your
head, sir. It was a wild-goose chase. I feared that,
from the first. You exhausted all reasonable means of
discovery when they went away. To begin again after
so long a time has passed is hopeless, sir-quite hopeless.”
“Why, where are they?” he returned impatiently.
“Where can they be? Above ground?
“God knows,” rejoined the locksmith, “many that I
knew above it five years ago have their beds under the
grass now. And the world is a wide place. It's a hope-
less attempt, sir, believe me. We must leave the dis-
covery of this mystery, like all others, to time, and acci-
dent, and Heaven's pleasure.”
“ Varden, my good fellow,” said Mr. Haredale, “I
have a deeper meaning in my present anxiety to find
them out, than you can fathom. It is not a mere whim;
it is not the casual revival of my old wishes and desires;
but an earnest, solemn purpose. My thoughts and
dreams all tend to it, and fix it in my mind. I have no
rest by day or night; I have no peace or quiet; I am
haunted.”
His voice was so altered from its usual tones, and his
manner bespoke so much emotion, that Gabriel, in his
wonder, could only sit and look towards him in the dark-
ness, and fancy the expression of his face.
“Do not ask me,” continued Mr. Haredale, “to explain
myself. If I were to do so, you would think me the vic-
tim of some hideous fancy. It is enough that this is so,
and that I cannot-no, I cannot-lie quietly in my bed,
without doing what will seem to you incomprehensible.”
“Since when, sir,” said the locksmith after a pause,
“has this uneasy feeling been upon you?”
Mr. Haredale hesitated for some moments, and then
replied: “Since the night of the storm. In short, since
the last nineteenth of March.”
As though he feared that Varden might express sur-
prise, or reason with him, he hastily went on:

“ You will think, I know, I labour under some delu-
sion. Perhaps I do. But it is not a morbid one; it is a
wholesome action of the mind, reasoning on actual
occurrences. You know the furniture remains in Mrs.
Rudge's house, and that it has been shut up, by my
orders, since she went away, save once a week or so,
when an old neighbour visits it to scare away the rats.
I am on my way there now.”
“For what purpose?” asked the locksmith.
“To pass the night there,” he replied; "and not to-
night alone, but many nights. This is a secret which I
trust to you in case of an unexpected emergency. You
will not come, unless in case of strong necessity, to me,
from dusk to broad day, I shall be there. Emma, your
daughter, and the rest, suppose me out of London, as I
have been until within this hour. Do not undeceive
them. This is the errand I am bound upon. I know I
may confide it to you, and I rely upon your questioning
me no more at this time.”
With that, as if to change the theme, he led the
astounded locksmith back to the night of the Maypole
highwayman, to the robbery of Edward Chester, to the
reappearance of the man at Mrs. Rudge's house, and to
all the strange circumstances which afterwards occurred.
He even asked him carelessly about the man's height,
his face, his figure, whether he was like any one he had
ever seen-like Hugh, for instance, or any man he had
known at any time—and put many questions of that
sort, which the locksmith, considering them as mere
devices to engage his attention and prevent his express-
ing the astonishment he felt, answered pretty much at
random.
At length, they arrived at the corner of the street in
which the house stood, where Mr. Haredale, alighting,
dismissed the coach. “If you desire to see me safely
lodged,” he said, turning to the locksmith with a gloomy
smile, “ you can.”
Gabriel, to whom all former marvels had been nothing
in comparison with this, followed him along the narrow
pavement in silence. When they reached the door, Mr.
Haredale softly opened it with a key he had about him,
and closing it when Varden entered, they were left in
thorough darkness.
They groped their way into the ground-floor room.

BARNABY RUDGE.
Here Mr. Haredale struck a light, and kindled a pocket-
taper he had brought with him for the purpose. It was
then, when the flame was full upon him, that the lock-
smith saw for the first time how haggard, pale, and
changed he looked; how worn and thin he was; how
perfectly his whole appearance coincided with all that
he had said so strangely as they rode along. It was not
an unnatural impulse in Gabriel, after what he had
heard, to note curiously the expression of his eyes. It
was perfectly collected and rational-so much so, indeed,
that he felt ashamed of his momentary suspicion, and
dropped his own when Mr. Haredale looked towards him,
as if he feared they would betray his thoughts.
“Will you walk through the house?” said Mr. Hare-
dale, with a glance towards the window, the crazy shut-
ters of which were closed and fastened. “Speak low."
There was a kind of awe about the place which
would have rendered it difficult to speak in any other
manner. Gabriel whispered “Yes,” and followed him
up-stairs.
Everything was just as they had seen it last. There
was a sense of closeness from the exclusion of fresh air,
and a gloom and heaviness around, as though long im-
prisonment had made the very silence sad. The homely
hangings of the beds and windows had begun to droop;
the dust lay thick upon their dwindling folds; and damps
had made their way through ceiling, wall, and floor.
The boards creaked beneath their tread, as if resenting
the unaccustomed intrusion; nimble spiders, paralysed
by the taper's glare, checked the motion of their hun-
dred legs upon the wall, or dropped like lifeless things
upon the ground; the death-watch ticked, and the
scampering feet of rats and mice rattled behind the
wainscot.
As they looked about them on the decaying furniture,
it was strange to find how vividly it presented those to
whom it had belonged, and with whom it was once
familiar. Grip seemed to perch again upon his high-
backed chair; Barnaby to crouch in his old favourite
corner by the fire; the mother to resume her usual seat,
and watch him as of old. Even when they could sepa-
rate these objects from the phantoms of the mind
which they invoked, the latter only glided out of sight,
but lingered near them still; for then they seemed to

337
lurk in closets and behind the doors, ready to start out
and suddenly accost them in well-remembered tones.
They went down-stairs, and again into the room they
had just now left. Mr. Haredale unbuckled his sword
and laid it on the table, with a pair of pocket pistols;
then told the locksmith he would light him to the door.
“But this is a dull place, sir,” said Gabriel, lingering;
“may no one share your watch?”
He shook his head, and so plainly evinced his wish to
be alone, that Gabriel could say no more. In another
moment the locksmith was standing in the street,
whence he could see that the light once more travelled
up-stairs, and soon returning to the room below, shone
brightly through the chinks in the shutters.
If ever man were sorely puzzled and perplexed the
locksmith was that night. Even when snugly seated
by his own fireside, with Mrs. Varden opposite in a
night-cap and night-jacket, and Dolly beside him (in a
most distracting dishabille) curling her hair, and smiling
as if she had never cried in all her life and never could
-even then, with Toby at his elbow and his pipe in his
mouth, and Miggs (but that perhaps was not much)
falling asleep in the back-ground, he could not quite
discard his wonder and uneasiness. So, in his dreams-
still there was Mr. Haredale, haggard and careworn,
listening in the solitary house to every sound that stirred.
with the taper shining through the chinks until the day
should turn it pale and end his lonely watching.
CHAPTER XLIII.
NEXT morning brought no satisfaction to the lock-
smith's thoughts, nor next day, nor the next, nor many
others. Often after nightfall he entered the street, and
turned his eyes towards the well-known house; and as
surely as he did so, there was the solitary light, still
gleaming through the crevices of the window-shutter,
while all within was motionless, noiseless, cheerless, as
a grave. Unwilling to hazard Mr. Haredale's favour
by disobeying his strict injunction, he never ventured
to knock at the door or to make his presence known in
any way. But whenever strong interest and curiosity

knowus vigil. vbreak hea
attracted him to the spot—which was not seldom—the
light was always there.
If he could have known what passed within, the
knowledge would have yielded him no clue to this mys-
terious vigil. At twilight, Mr. Haredale shut himself
up, and at daybreak he came forth. He never missed a
night, always came and went alone, and never varied
his proceedings in the least degree.
The manner of his watch was this. At dusk, he
entered the house in the same way as when the lock-
smith bore him company, kindled a light, went through
the rooms, and narrowly examined them. That done,
he returned to the chamber on the ground-floor, and
laying his sword and pistols on the table, sat by it until
morning..
He usually had a book with him, and often tried to
read, but never fixed his eyes or thoughts upon it for
five minutes together. The slightest noise without
doors caught his ear; a step upon the pavement seemed
to make his heart leap.
He was not without some refreshment during the long
lonely hours; generally carrying in his pocket a sand-
wich of bread and meat, and a small flask of wine. The
latter, diluted with large quantities of water, he drank
in a heated, feverish way, as though his throat were
dried; but he scarcely ever broke his fast, by so much
as a crumb of bread.
If this voluntary sacrifice of sleep and comfort had its
origin, or as the locksmith on consideration was disposed
to think, in any superstitious expectation of the fulfil-
ment of a dream or vision connected with the event on
which he had brooded for so many years, and if he
had waited for some ghostly visitor who walked abroad
when men lay sleeping in their beds, he showed no trace
of fear or wavering. His stern features expressed in.
flexible resolution; his brows were puckered, and his
lips compressed, with deep and settled purpose; and
when he started at a noise and listened, it was not with
the start of fear but hope, and catching up his sword as
though the hour had come at last, he would clutch it in
his tight-clenched hand, and listen, with sparkling eyes
and eager looks, until it died away.
These disappointments were numerous, for they ensued
on almost every sound, but his constancy was not

339
shaken. Still, every night he was at his post, the same
stern, sleepless sentinel; and still night passed, and
morning dawned, and he must watch again.
This went on for weeks; he had taken a lodging at
Vauxhall in which to pass the day and rest himself; and
from this place, when the tide served, he usually came
to London Bridge from Westminster by water, in order
that he might avoid the busy streets.
One evening, shortly before twilight, he came his ac-
customed road upon the river's bank, intending to pass
through Westminster Hall into Palace Yard, and there
take boat to London Bridge as usual. There was a pretty
large concourse of people assembled round the Houses
of Parliament, looking at the members as they entered
and departed, and giving vent to rather noisy demon-
strations of approval or dislike, according to their own
opinions. As he made his way among the throng, he
heard once or twice the No-Popery cry, which was then
becoming pretty familiar to the ears of most men; but
holding it in very slight regard, and observing that the
idlers were of the lowest grade, he neither thought nor
cared about it, but made his way along with perfect in-
difference.
There were many little knots and groups of persons
in Westminster Hall: some few looking upwards at its
noble ceiling; and at the rays of evening light, tinted by
the setting sun, which streamed in aslant through its
small windows, and growing dimmer by degrees, were
quenched in the gathering gloom below; some, noisy
passengers, mechanics going home from work, and
otherwise, who hurried quickly through, waking the
echoes with their voices, and soon darkening the small
door in the distance, as they passed into the street be-
yond; some, in busy conference together on politics or
private matters, pacing slowly up and down with eyes
that sought the ground, and seeming, by their attitudes,
to listen earnestly from head to foot. Here, a dozen
squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air; there,
a solitary man, half clerk, half mendicant, paced up
and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait: at
his elbow passed an errand-lad, swinging his basket
round and round, and with his shrill whistle riving the
very timbers of the roof; while a more observant
schoolboy, half-way through, pocketed his ball, and eyed

the distant beadle as he came looming on. It was that
time of evening when if you shut your eyes and open
them again, the darkness of an hour appears to have
gathered in a second. The smooth-worn pavement,
dusty with footsteps, still called upon the lofty walls to
reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly,
save when the closing of some heavy door resounded
through the building like a clap of thunder, and drowned
all other noises in its rolling sound.
Mr. Haredale, glancing only at such of these groups
as he passed nearest to, and then in a manner betoken-
ing that his thoughts were elsewhere, had nearly
traversed the Hall, when two persons before him caught
his attention. One of these, a gentleman in elegant
attire, carried in his hand a cane, which he twirled in a
jaunty manner as he loitered on; the other, an obsequi-
ous, crouching, fawning figure, listened to what he said
-at times throwing in a humble word himself-and,
with his shoulders shrugged up to his ears, rubbed his
hands submissively, or answered at intervals by an
inclination of the head, half-way between a nod of
acquiescence and a bow of most profound respect.
In the abstract there was nothing very remarkable
in this pair, for servility waiting on a handsme suit of
clothes and a cane-not to speak of gold and silver
sticks or wands of office—is common enough. But there
was that about the well-dressed man, yes, and about the
other likewise, which struck Mr. Haredale with no
pleasant feeling. He hesitated, stopped, and would
have stepped aside and turned out of his path, but at
the moment the other two faced about quickly, and
stumbled upon him before he could avoid them.
The gentleman with the cane lifted his hat and had
begun to tender an apology, which Mr. Haredale had
begun as hastily to acknowledge and walk away, when
he stopped short and cried, “Haredale! God bless me,
this is strange, indeed!”
“ It is,” he returned, impatiently; "yes—a—”.
“My dear friend,” cried the other, detaining him,
“why such great speed? One minute, Haredale, for
the sake of old acquaintance.”
“I am in haste," he said. “Neither of us has sought
this meeting. Let it be a brief one. Good-night!”
“Fie, fie!" replied Sir John (for it was he), *how very

churlish! We were speaking of you. Your name was
on my lips-perhaps you heard me mention it? No? I
am sorry for that. I am really sorry. You know our
friend here, Haredale? This is really a most remark-
able meeting!"
The friend, plainly very ill at ease, had made bold to
press Sir John's arm, and to give him other significant
hints that he was desirous of avoiding this introduction.
As it did not suit Sir John's purpose, however, that
it should be evaded, he appeared quite unconscious
of these silent remonstrances, and inclined his hand
towards him, as he spoke, to call attention to him more
particularly.
The friend, therefore, had nothing for it but to muster
up the pleasantest smile he could, and to make a con-
ciliatory bow as Mr. Haredale turned his eyes upon him.
Seeing that he was recognised, he put out his hand in
an awkward and embarrassed manner, which was not
mended by its contemptuous rejection.
"Mr. Gashford!” said Haredale, coldly. “It is as I
have heard, then. You have left the darkness for the
light, sir, and hate those whose opinions you formerly
held, with all the bitterness of a renegade. You are an
honour, sir, to any cause. I wish the one you espouse
at present much joy of the acquisition it has made.”
The secretary rubbed his hands and bowed, as though
he would disarm his adversary by humbling himself be-
fore him. Sir John Chester again exclaimed, with an
air of great gaiety, “Now, really, this is a most remark-
able meeting!” and took a pinch of snuff with his usual
self-possession.
“Mr. Haredale,” said Gashford, stealthily raising his
eyes, and letting them drop again when they met the
other's steady gaze, “is too conscientious, too honoura-
ble, too manly, I am sure, to attach unworthy motives to
an honest change of opinions, even though it implies a
doubt of those he holds himself. Mr. Haredale is too
just, too generous, too clear-sighted in his moral vision,
" Yes, sir?” he rejoined, with a sarcastic smile, finding
that the secretary stopped. “You were saying”
Gashford meekly shrugged his shoulders, and looking
on the ground again, was silent.
“No, but let us really,” interposed Sir John at this
to-

juncture, “ let us really, for a moment, contemplate the
very remarkable character of this meeting. Haredale,
my dear friend, pardon me if I think you are not suffi-
ciently impressed with its singularity. Here we stand,
by no previous appointment or arrangement, three old
schoolfellows, in Westminster Hall: three old boarders
in a remarkably dull and shady seminary at St. Omer's,
where you, being Catholic, and of necessity educated
out of England, were brought up: and where I, being a
promising young Protestant at that time, was sent to
learn the French tongue from a native of Paris!"
“Add to the singularity, Sir John,” said Mr. Haredale,
“that some of you Protestants of promise are at this
moment leagued in yonder building to prevent our hav-
ing the surpassing and unheard-of privilege of teaching
our children to read and write-here-in this land,
where thousands of us enter your service every year,
and to preserve the freedom of which, we die in bloody
battles abroad, in heaps; and that others of you, to the
number of some thousands as I learn, are led on to look
on all men of my creed as wolves and beasts of prey, by
this man Gashford. Add to it besides, the bare fact that
this man lives in society, walks the streets in broad day
- I was about to say, holds up his head, but that he does
not-and it will be strange, and very strange, I grant
you."
“Oh! you are hard upon our friend, replied Sir John,
with an engaging smile. “You are really very hard
upon our friend!”
“Let him go on, Sir John,” said Gashford, fumbling
with his gloves. “Let him go on, I can make allow-
ances, Sir John. I am honoured with your good opinion,
and I can dispense with Mr. Haredale's. Mr. Haredale
is a sufferer from the penal laws, and I can't expect his
favour.”
“ You have so much of my favour, sir," retorted Mr.
Haredale, with a bitter glance at the third party in their
conversation, “ that I am glad to see you in such good
company. You are the essence of your great Associa-
tion, in yourselves.”
“Now, there you mistake,” said Sir John, in his most
benignant way. “There—which is a most remarkable
circumstance for a man of your punctuality and exact-
ness, Haredale-you fall into error. I don't belong to

343
the body; I have an immense respect for its members,
but I don't belong to it; although I am, it is certainly
true, the conscientious opponent of your being relieved.
I feel it my duty to be so; it is a most unfortunate
necessity; and cost me a bitter struggle. Will you try
this box? If you don't object to a trifling infusion of a
very chaste scent, you'll find its flavour exquisite.”
“I ask your pardon, Sir John," said Mr. Haredale, de-
clining the proffer with a motion of his hand, “for hav-
ing ranked you among the humble instruments who are
obvious and in all men's sight. I should have done
more justice to your genius. Men of your capacity plot
in secret and safety, and leave exposed posts to the
duller wits."
“Don't apologise, for the world,” replied Sir John
sweetly, “old friends, like you and I, may be allowed
some freedoms, or the deuce is in it."
Gashford, who had been very restless all this time,
but had not once looked up, now turned to Sir John,
and ventured to mutter something to the effect that he
must go, or my lord would perhaps be waiting.
“Don't distress yourself, good sir,” said Mr. Haredale,
“I'll take my leave, and put you at your ease-” which
he was about to do without ceremony, when he was
stayed by a buzz and murmer at the upper end of the
Hall, and, looking in that direction, saw Lord George
Gordon coming on, with a crowd of people round him.
There was a lurking look of triumph, though very dif-
ferently expressed, in the faces of his two companions,
which made it a natural impulse on Mr. Haredale's
part not to give way to his leader, but to stand there
while he passed. He drew himself up and, clasping his
hands behind him, looked on with a proud and scornful
aspect, while Lord George slowly advanced (for the
press was great about him) towards the spot where they
were standing.
He had left the House of Commons but that moment,
and had come straight down into the Hall, bringing with
him, as his custom was, intelligence of what had been
said that night in reference to the Papists, and what
petitions had been presented in their favour, and who
had supported them, and when the bill was to be brought
in, and when it would be advisable to present their
own Great Protestant petition. All this he told the

persons about him in a loud voice, and with great abun-
dance of ungainly gesture. Those who were nearest
him made comments to each other, and vented threats
and murmurings; those who were outside the crowd
cried “Silence,” and “Stand back,” or closed in upon
the rest, endeavouring to make a forcible exchange of
places; and so they came driving on in a very disord-
erly and irregular way, as it is the manner of a crowd
to do.
When they were very near to where the Secretary,
Sir John, and Mr. Haredale stood, Lord George turned
round and, making a few remarks of a sufficiently vio-
lent and incoherent kind, concluded with the usual
sentiment, and called for three cheers to back it. While
these were in the act of being given with great energy,
he extricated himself from the press, and stepped up to
Gashford's side. Both he and sir John being well
known to the populace, they fell back a little, and left
the four standing together.
“ Mr. Haredale, Lord George,” said Sir John Chester,
seeing that the nobleman regarded him with an inquisi-
tive look. “A Catholic gentleman unfortunately-most
unhappily a Catholic—but an esteemed acquaintance of
mine, and once of Mr. Gashford's. My dear Mr. Haredale,
this is Lord George Gordon.”
“I should have known that, had I been ignorant of
his lordship's person,” said Mr. Haredale. “I hope there
is but one gentleman in England who, addressing an
ignorant and excited throng, would speak of a large
body of his fellow-subjects in such injurious language
as I heard this moment. For shame, my lord, for
shame!”
“I cannot talk to you, sir," replied Lord George in a
loud voice, and waving his hand in a disturbed and
agitated manner; "we have nothing in common.”
“We have much in common-many things—all that
the Almighty gave us,” said Mr. Haredale, “and com-
mon charity, not to say common sense and common
decency, should teach you to refrain from these pro-
ceedings. If every one of those men had arms in their
hands at this moment, as they have them in their heads,
I would not leave this place without telling you that you
disgrace your station.”
“I don't hear you, sir,” he replied in the same manner

BARNABY RUDGE.
345
as before; “I can't hear you. It is indifferent to me
what you say. Don't retort, Gashford,” for the secre-
tary had made a show of wishing to do so; “I can hold
no communion with the worshippers of idols.”
As he said this he glanced at Sir John, who lifted his
hands and eyebrows as if deploring the intemperate con-
duct of Mr. Haredale, and smiled in admiration of the
crowd and of their leader.
“He retort!” cried Haredale. “Look you here, my
lord. Do you know this man?”
Lord George replied by laying his hand upon the
shoulder of his cringing secretary, and viewing him with
a smile of confidence.
“This man,” said Mr. Haredale, eyeing him from top
to toe, “who in his boyhood was a thief, and has been
from that time to this a servile, false, and truckling
knave: this man who has crawled and crept through
life, wounding the hand he licked, and biting those he
fawned upon: this sycophant, who never knew what
honour, truth, or courage meant; who robbed his bene-
factor's daughter of her virtue, and married her to break
her heart, and did it with stripes and cruelty: this crea-
ture, who has whined at kitchen windows for the broken
food, and begged for halfpence at our chapel doors: this
apostle of the faith, whose tender conscience cannot bear
the altars where his vicious life was publicly denounced.
Do you know this man?"
“Oh, really-you are very, very hard upon our friend!”
exclaimed Sir John.
“Let Mr. Haredale go on,” said Gashford, upon whose
unwholesome face the perspiration had broken out dur-
ing this speech, in blotches of wet; “I don't mind him,
Sir John; it's quite as indifferent to me what he says as
it is to my lord. · If he reviles my lord, as you have
heard, Sir John, how can I hope to escape?”
“Is it not enough, my lord,” Mr. Haredale continued,
“that I, as good a gentleman as you, must hold my
property, such as it is, by a trick at which the state con-
nives because of these hard laws; and that we may not
teach our youth in schools the common principles of
right and wrong; but must we be denounced and ridden
by such men as this! Here is a man to head your No-
Popery cry! For shame! For shame!"
The infatuated nobleman had glanced more than once

at Sir John Chester, as if to inquire whether there was
any truth in these statements concerning Gashford, and
Sir John had as often plainly answered, by a shrug or
look, “Oh, dear me! no.” He now said, in the same loud
key, and in the same strange manner as before:
“I have nothing to say, sir, in reply, and no desire to
hear anything more. I beg you won't obtrude your con-
versation or these personal attacks upon me. I shall
not be deterred from doing my duty to my country and
my countrymen by any such attempts, whether they pro-
ceed from emissaries of the Pope or not, I assure you.
Come, Gashford!”
They had walked on a few paces while speaking, and
were now at the Hall-door, through which they passed
together. Mr. Haredale, without any leave-taking,
turned away to the river stairs, which were close at
hand, and hailed the only boatman who remained there.
But the throng of people—the foremost of whom had
heard every word that Lord George Gordon said, and
among all of whom the rumour had been rapidly dis-
persed that the stranger was a Papist who was bearding
him for his advocacy of the popular cause-came pour-
ing out pell-mell, and, forcing the nobleman, his secre-
tary, and Sir John Chester on before them, so that they
appeared to be at their head, crowded to the top of the
stairs where Mr. Haredale waited until the boat was
ready, and there stood still, leaving him on a little clear
space by himself.
They were not silent, however, although inactive. At
first some indistinct mutterings arose among them,
which were followed by a hiss or two, and these swelled
by degrees into a perfect storm. Then one voice said,
“Down with the Papists!" and there was a pretty gen-
eral cheer, but nothing more. After à lull of a few mo-
ments, one man cried out, “Stone him;" another, “Duck
him;" another, in a stentorian voice, “No Popery!"
This favourite cry the rest re-echoed, and the mob,
which might have been two hundred strong, joined in a
general shout.
Mr. Haredale had stood calmly on the brink of the
steps until they made this demonstration, when he looked
round contemptuously, and walked at a slow pace down
the stairs. He was pretty near the boat when Gashford,
as if without intention, turned about, and directly after-

wards a great stone was thrown by some hand in the
crowd, which struck him on the head, and made him
stagger like a drunken man.
The blood sprung freely from the wound, and trickled
down his coat. He turned directly, and rushing up the
steps with a boldness and passion which made them all
fall back, demanded:
“Who did that? Show me the man who hit me."
Not a soul moved; except some in the rear who slunk
off, and, escaping to the other side of the way, looked
on like indifferent spectators.
“Who did that?" he repeated. “Show me the man
who did it. Dog, was it you? It was your deed, if not
your hand I know you."
He threw himself on Gashford as he said the words,
and hurled him to the ground. There was a sudden
motion in the crowd, and some laid hands upon him,
but his sword was out, and they fell off again.
“My lord—Sir John”-he cried, “draw one of you-
you are responsible for this outrage, and I look to you.
Draw, if you are gentlemen.” With that he struck Sir
John upon the breast with the flat of his weapon, and
with a burning face and flashing eyes stood upon his
guard; alone, before them all.
For an instant, for the briefest space of time the mind
can readily conceive, there was a change in Sir John's
smooth face, such as no man ever saw there. The next
moment he stepped forward, and laid one hand on Mr.
Haredale's arm, while with the other he endeavoured
to appease the crowd.
“My dear friend, my good Haredale, you are blinded
with passion-it's very natural, extremely natural-but
you don't know friends from foes.”
“I know them all, sir, I can distinguish well,” he
retorted, almost mad with rage. “Sir John, Lord George
- do you hear me? Are you cowards ?”
“Never mind, sir,” said a man, forcing his way be-
tween and pushing him towards the stairs with friendly
violence, “never mind asking that. For God's sake,
get away. What can you do against this number?
And there are as many more in the next street, who'll
be round directly”-indeed they began to pour in as he
said the words—" you'd be giddy from that cut in the
first heat of a scuffle. Now do retire, sir, or, take my

word for it, you'll be worse used than you would be if
every man in the crowd was a woman, and that woman
Bloody Mary. Come, sir, make haste—as quick as you
can.”
Mr. Haredale, who began to turn faint and sick, felt
how sensible this advice was, and descended the steps
with his unknown friend's assistance. John Grueby (for
John it was) helped him into the boat, and giving her
a shove off, which sent her thirty feet into the tide,
bade the waterman pull away like a Briton, and walked
up again as composedly as if he had just landed.
There was at first a slight disposition on the part of the
mob to resent this interference; but John looking par-
ticularly strong and cool, and wearing besides Lord
George's livery, they thought better of it, and contented
themselves with sending a shower of small missiles after
the boat, which plashed harmlessly in the water, for she
had by this time cleared the bridge, and was darting
swiftly down the centre of the stream.
From this amusement they proceeded to giving Prot-
estant knocks at the doors of private houses, breaking
a few lamps, and assaulting some stray constables.
But, it being whispered that a detachment of Life
Guards had been sent for, they took to their heels with
great expedition, and left the street quite clear.
CHAPTER XLIV.
WHEN the concourse separated, and, dividing into
chance clusters, drew off in various directions, there
still remained upon the scene of the late disturbance
one man. This man was Gashford, who, bruised by his
late fall, and hurt in a much greater degree by the in-
dignity he had undergone, and the exposure of which he
had been the victim, limped up and down, breathing
curses and threats of vengeance.
It was not the secretary's nature to waste his wrath in
words. While he vented the froth of his malevolence
in these effusions, he kept a steady eye on two men, who,
having disappeared with the rest when the alarm was
spread, had since returned, and were now visible in the

moonlight, at no great distance, as they walked to and
fro, and talked together.
He made no move towards them, but waited patiently
on the dark side of the street, until they were tired of
strolling backwards and forwards and walked away in
company. Then he followed, but at some distance;
keeping them in view, without appearing to have that
object, or being seen by them.
They went up Parliament Street, past Saint Martin's
Church, and away by Saint Giles's to Tottenham Court
Road, at the back of which, upon the western side, was
then a place called the Green Lanes. This was a retired
spot, not of the choicest kind, leading into the fields.
Great heaps of ashes; stagnant pools, overgrown with
rank grass and duckweed; broken turnstiles; and the
upright posts of palings long since carried off for fire-
wood, which menaced all heedless walkers with their
jagged and rusty nails; were the leading features of the
landscape; while here and there a donkey, or a ragged
horse, tethered to a stake, and cropping off a wretched
meal from the coarse stunted turf, were quite in keeping
with the scene, and would have suggested (if the houses
had not done so, sufficiently, of themselves) how very
poor the people were who lived in the crazy huts adja-
cent, and how fool-hardy it might prove for one who
carried money, or wore decent clothes, to walk that way
alone, unless by daylight.
Poverty has its whims and shows of taste, as wealth
has. Some of these cabins were turreted; some had
false windows painted on their rotten walls; one had a
mimic clock, upon a crazy tower of four feet high, which
screened the chimney; each in its little patch of ground
had a rude seat or arbour. The population dealt in
bones, in rags, in broken glass, in old wheels, in birds,
and dogs. These, in their several ways of stowage, filled
the gardens, and shedding a perfume, not of the most
delicious nature, in the air, filled it besides with yelps,
and screams, and howling.
Into this retreat, the secretary followed the two men
whom he had held in sight, and here he saw them safely
lodged, in one of the meanest houses, which was but a
room, and that of small dimensions. He waited with-
out, until the sound of their voices, joined in a discord-
ant song, assured him they were making merry, and

then approaching the door, by means of a tottering plank
which crossed the ditch in front, knocked at it with his
hand.
“Muster Gashford!” said the man who opened it, tak-
ing his pipe from his mouth, in evident surprise. “Why,
who'd have thought of this here honour! Walk in, Muster
Gashford-walk in, sir.”
Gashford required no second invitation, and entered
with a gracious air. There was a fire in the rusty grate
(for though the spring was pretty far advanced, the
nights were cold), and on a stool beside it Hugh sat
smoking. Dennis placed a chair, his only one, for the
secretary, in front of the hearth; and took his seat again
upon the stool he had left when he rose to give the
visitor admission.
“What's in the wind now, Muster Gashford ?” he said,
as he resumed his pipe, and looked at him askew, “Any
orders from head-quarters? Are we going to begin?
What is it, Muster Gashford ?
“Oh, nothing, nothing,” rejoined the secretary with
a friendly nod to Hugh. “We have broken the
ice, though. We had a little spurt to-day- eh,
Dennis?”
“A very little one,” growled the hangman. “Not
half enough for me.”
“ Nor me neither!” cried Hugh. “Give us something
to do with life in it-with life in it, master. Ha, ha!”
“Why, you wouldn't,” said the secretary, with his
worst expression of face, and in his mildest tones, “have
anything to do, with—with death in it?”
“I don't know that,” replied Hugh. “I'm open to
orders. I don't care; not I.”
“Nor I!” vociferated Dennis.
“Brave fellows!” said the secretary, in as pastor-like
a voice as if he was commending them for some un-
common act of valour and generosity. “By-the-bye"
-and here he stopped and warmed his hands: then sud-
denly looked up-" who threw that stone to-day?”
Mr. Dennis coughed and shook his head, as who should
say, “A mystery indeed!” Hugh sat and smoked in
silence.
“It was well done?” said the secretary, warming his
hands again. “I should like to know that man.”
“Would you?” said Dennis, after looking at his face

BARNABY RUDGE.
351
to assure himself that he was serious. “Would you like
to know that man, Muster Gashford?”
“I should indeed,” replied the secretary.
" Why, then, Lord love you,” said the hangman, in
his hoarsest chuckle, as he pointed with his pipe to
Hugh, “there he sets. That's the man. My stars and
halters, Muster Gashford,” he added in a whisper, as he
drew his stool close to him and jogged him with his
elbow, “what a interesting blade he is! He wants as
much holding in as a thorough-bred bulldog. If it
hadn't been for me to-day, he'd have had that 'ere Roman
down, and made a riot of it in another minute.”
“And why not?” cried Hugh in a surly voice, as he
overheard this last remark. “Where's the good of
putting things off? Strike while the iron's hot; that's
what I say."
“Ah!” retorted Dennis, shaking his head, with a kind
of pity for his friend's ingenuous youth; “but suppose
the iron an't hot, brother? You must get people's blood
up afore you strike, and have 'em in the humour. There
wasn't quite enough to provoke 'em to-day, I tell you.
If you had your way, you'd have spoilt the fun to come,
and ruined us.”
“ Dennis is quite right,” said Gashford, smoothly.
“He is perfectly correct. Dennis has great knowledge
of the world.”
“I ought to have, Muster Gashford, seeing what a
many people I've helped out of it, eh?” grinned the
hangman, whispering the words behind his hand.
The secretary laughed at this, just as much as Dennis
could desire, and when he had done, said, turning to
Hugh:
“Dennis's policy was mine, as you may have observed.
You saw, for instance, how I fell when I was set upon.
I made no resistance. I did nothing to provoke an out-
break. Oh, dear, no!"
“No, by the Lord Harry!” cried Dennis with a noisy
laugh, “you went down very quiet, Muster Gashford-
and very flat besides. I thinks to myself at the time
'it's all up with Muster Gushford! I never see a man
lay flatter nor more still—with the life in him—than you
did to-day. He's a rough ’un to play with, is that 'ere
Papist, and that's the fact.”
The secretary's face, as Dennis roared with laughter,

and turned his wrinkled eyes on Hugh, who did the
like, might have furnished a study for the devil's pic-
ture. He sat quite silent until they were serious again,
and then said, looking round:
“We are very pleasant here; so very pleasant, Dennis,
that but for my lord's particular desire that I should sup
with him, and the time being very near at hand, I should
be inclined to stay, until it would be hardly safe to go
homeward. I come up on a little business-yes, I do-
as you supposed. It's very flattering to you; being this.
If we ever should be obliged—and we can't tell, you
know—this is a very uncertain world—”.
“I believe you, Muster Gashford,” interposed the
hangman with a grave nod. “The uncertainties as I've
seen in reference to this here state of existence, the un-
expected contingencies as have come about! Oh, my
eye!” Feeling the subject much too vast for expression,
he puffed at his pipe again, and looked the rest.
“I say,” resumed the secretary, in a slow, impressive
way; “we can't tell what may come to pass; and if we
should be obliged against our wills, to have recourse to
violence, my lord (who has suffered terribly to-day, as
far as words can go) consigns to you two-bearing in
mind my recommendation of you both, as good staunch
men, beyond all doubt and suspicion—the pleasant task
of punishing this Haredale. You may do as you please
with him or his, provided that you show no mercy, and no
quarter, and leave no two beams of his house standing
where the builder placed them. You may sack it, burn
it, do with it as you like, but it must come down; it must
be razed to the ground; and he, and all belonging to
him, left as shelterless as new-born infants whom their
mothers have exposed. Do you understand me?” said
Gashford, pausing and pressing his hands together
gently.
“Understand you, master!” cried Hugh. “You speak
plain now. Why, this is hearty!"
“I knew you would like it," said Gashford, shaking
him by the hand; “I thought you would. Good-night!
Don't rise, Dennis: I would rather find my way alone.
I may have to make other visits here, and it's pleasant
to come and go without disturbing you. I can find my
way perfectly well. Good-night!”
He was gone, and had shut the door behind him.

They looked at each other, and nodded approvingly:
Dennis stirred up the fire.
“ This looks a little more like business!” he said.
“Ay, indeed!” cried Hugh; “this suits me!"
“I've heerd it said of Muster Gashford,” said the hang-
man, “that he'd a surprising memory and wonderful
firmness—that he never forgot, and never forgave.
Let's drink his health!”
Hugh readily complied-pouring no liquor on the floor
when he drank this toast-and they pledged the secretary
as a man after their own hearts in a bumper.
CHAPTER XLV.
WHILE the worst passions of the worst men were thus
working in the dark, and the mantle of religion, assumed
to cover the ugliest deformities, threatened to become
the shroud of all that was good and peaceful in society,
a circumstance occurred which once more altered the
position of two persons from whom this history has long
been separated, and to whom it must now return.
In a small English country town, the inhabitants of
which supported themselves by the labour of their
hands in plaiting and preparing straw for those who
made bonnets and other articles of dress and ornament
from that material-concealed under an assumed name,
and living in a quiet poverty which knew no change,
no pleasures, and few cares but that of struggling on
from day to day in the one great toil for bread-dwelt
Barnaby and his mother. Their poor cottage had known
no stranger's foot since they sought the shelter of its
roof five years before; nor had they in all that time held
any commerce or communication with the old world
from which they had fled. To labour in peace, and de-
vote her labour and her life to her poor son, was all the
widow sought. If happiness can be said at any time to
be the lot of one on whom a secret sorrow preys, she
was happy now. Tranquility, resignation, and her
strong love of him who needed it so much, formed the
small circle of her quiet joys; and while that remained
unbroken she was contented.
For Barnaby himself, the time which had flown by

354
BARNBAY RUDGE.
had passed him like the wind. The daily suns of years
had shed no brighter gleam of reason on his mind; no
dawn had broken on his long, dark night. He would sit
sometimes-often for days together-on a low seat by
the fire or by the cottage door, busy at work (for he had
learnt the art his mother plied), and listening, God help
him, to the tales she would repeat as a lure to keep him
in her sight. He had no recollection of these little nar-
ratives; the tale of yesterday was new upon the morrow;
but he liked them at the moment; and when the humour
held him would remain patiently within doors, hearing
her stories like a little child, and working cheerfully
from sunrise until it was too dark to see.
At other times—and then their scanty earnings were
barely sufficient to furnish them with food, though of
the coarsest sort-he would wander abroad from dawn
of day until the twilight deepened into night. Few in
that place, even of the children, could be idle, and he had
no companions of his own kind. Indeed there were not
many who could have kept up with him in his rambles,
had there been a legion. But there were a score of vaga-
bond dogs belonging to the neighbours who served his
purpose quite as well. With two or three of these, or
sometimes with a full half-dozen barking at his heels,
he would sally forth on some long expedition that con-
sumed the day; and though on their return at nightfall
the dogs would come home limping and sore-footed, and
almost spent with their fatigue, Barnaby was up and
off again at sunrise with some new attendants of the
same class, with whom he would return in like manner.
On all these travels Grip, in his little basket at his mas-
ter's back, was a constant member of the party, and
when they set off in fine weather and in high spirits, no
dog barked louder than the raven.
Their pleasures on these excursions were simple
enough. A crust of bread and scrap of meat, with water
from the brook or spring, sufficed for their repast. Bar-
naby's enjoyments were to walk, and run, and leap, till
he was tired; then to lie down on the long grass, or by
the growing corn, or in the shade of some tall tree, look-
ing upwards at the light clouds as they floated over the
blue surface of the sky, and listening to the lark as she
poured out her brilliant song. There were wild-flowers
to pluck-the bright red poppy, the gentle harebell, the

355
cowslip, and the rose. There were birds to watch; fish;
ants; worms; hares or rabbits, as they darted across the
distant pathway in the wood and so were gone: millions
of living things to have an interest in, and lie in wait
for, and clap hands and shout in memory of, when they
had disappeared. In default of these, or when they
wearied, there was the merry sunlight to hunt out, as it
crept in aslant through leaves and boughs of trees, and
hid far down-deep, deep, in hollow places—like a silver
pool, where nodding branches seemed to bathe and
sport; sweet scents of summer air breathing over fields
of beans or clover; the perfume of wet leaves or moss;
the life of waving trees, and shadows always changing.
When these or any of them tired, or in excess of pleas-
ing tempted him to shut his eyes, there was slumber in
the midst of all these soft delights, with the gentle wind
murmuring like music in his ears, and everything around
melting into one delicious dream.
Their hut-for it was little more-stood on the out-
skirts of the town, at a short distance from the high
road, but in a secluded place, where few chance passen-
gers strayed at any season of the year. It had a plot of
garden-ground attached, which Barnaby, in fits and
starts of working, trimmed, and kept in order. Within
doors and without, his mother laboured for their com-
mon good; and hail, rain, snow, or sunshine found no
difference in her.
Though so far removed from the scenes of her past
life, and with so little thought or hope of ever visiting
them again, she seemed to have a strange desire to
know what happened in the busy world. Any old news-
paper or scrap of intelligence from London she caught at
with avidity. The excitement it produced was not of a
pleasurable kind, for her manner at such times ex-
pressed the keenest anxiety and dread; but it never
faded in the least degree. Then, and in stormy, winter
nights, when the wind blew loud and strong, the old ex-
pression came into her face, and she would be seized
with a fit of trembling, like one who had an ague. But
Barnaby noted little of this; and putting a great con-
straint upon herself, she usually recovered her accus-
tomed manner before the change had caught his ob-
servation.
Grip was by no means an idle or unprofitable member

356
BARNABY RUDGE.
of the humble household. Partly by dint of Barnaby's
tuition, and partly by pursuing a species of self-instruc-
tion common to his tribe, and exerting his powers of ob-
servation to the utmost, he had acquired a degree of
sagacity which rendered him famous for miles round.
His conversational powers and surprising performances
were the universal theme: and as many persons came to
see the wonderful raven, and none left his exertions un-
rewarded when he condescended to exhibit, which was
not always, for genius is capricious-his earnings formed
an important item in the common stock. Indeed the
bird himself appeared to know his value well; for though
he was perfectly free and unrestrained in the presence
of Barnaby and his mother, he maintained in public an
amazing gravity and never stooped to any other gratui-
tous performances than biting the ankles of vagabond
boys (an exercise in which he much delighted), killing a
fowl or two occasionally, and swallowing the dinners of
various neighbouring dogs, of whom the boldest held
him in great awe and dread.
Time had glided on in this way, and nothing had hap-
pened to disturb or change their mode of life, when, one
summer's night in June, they were in their little garden,
resting from the labours of the day. The widow's work
was yet upon her knee and strewn upon the ground about
her; and Barnaby stood leaning on his spade, gazing
at the brightness in the west and singing softly to him-
self.
“A brave evening, mother! If we had, chinking in
our pockets, but a few specks of that gold which is
piled up yonder in the sky, we should be rich for life.”
“We are better as we are,” returned the widow with
a quiet smile. “Let us be contented, and we do not
want and need not care to have it, though it lay shin-
ing at our feet.”
“Ay!” said Barnaby, resting with crossed arms on his
spade, and looking wistfully at the sunset, “that's well
enough, mother; but gold's a good thing to have. I wish
that I knew where to find it. Grip and I could do much
with gold, be sure of that.”
“What would you do?” she asked.
“What! A world of things. We'd dress finely-you
and I, I mean; not Grip-keep horses, dogs, wear bright
colours and feathers, do no more work, live delicately

BARNABY RUDGE.
357
and at our ease. Oh, we'd find uses for it, mother, and
uses that would do us good. I would I knew where gold
was buried. How hard I'd work to dig it up!"
“You do not know," said his mother, rising from her
seat, and laying her hand upon his shoulder, “what men
have done to win it, and how they have found, too late,
that it glitters brightest at a distance, and turns quite
dim and dull when handled.”
“Ay, ay; so you say; so you think,” he answered, still
looking eagerly in the same direction. “For all that,
mother, I should like to try.”
“Do you not see,” she said, “how red it is? Nothing
bears so many stains of blood, as gold. Avoid it. None
have such cause to hate its name as we have. Do not so
much as think of it, dear love. It has brought such
misery and suffering on your head and mine as few have
known, and God grant few may have to undergo. I
would rather we were dead and laid down in our graves,
than you should ever come to love it."
For a moment Barnaby withdrew his eyes and looked
at her with wonder. Then, glancing from the redness
in the sky to the mark upon his wrist as if he would
compare the two, he seemed about to question her with
earnestness, when a new object caught his wandering
attention, and made him quite forgetful of his purpose.
This was a man with dusty feet and garments, who
stood, bareheaded, behind the hedge that divided their
patch of garden from the pathway, and leant meekly
forward as if he sought to mingle with their conversa-
tion, and waited for his time to speak. His face was
turned towards the brightness, too, but the light that
fell upon it showed that he was blind, and saw it not.
“A blessing on those voices!” said the wayfarer. “I
feel the beauty of the night more keenly when I hear
them. They are like eyes to me. Will they speak
again, and cheer the heart of a poor traveller?”
"Have you no guide?” asked the widow, after a mo-
ment's pause.
“None but that,” he answered, pointing with his staff
towards the sun, “and sometimes a milder one at night,
but she is idle now.”
“Have you travelled far?”
“A weary way and long,” rejoined the traveller as he
shook his head. “A weary, weary way. I struck my

stick just now upon the bucket of your well-be pleased
to let me have a draught of water, lady.”
“Why do you call me lady?" she returned. “Iam as
poor as you."
“Your speech is soft and gentle, and I judge by
that,” replied the man. “The coarsest stuffs and finest
silks are-apart from the sense of touch-alike to me. I
cannot judge you by your dress.”
“Come round this way," said Barnaby, who had
passed out at the garden gate and now stood close beside
him. “Put your hand in mine. You're blind and al-
ways in the dark, eh? Are you frightened in the dark?
Do you see great crowds of faces, now? Do they grin
and chatter?”
" Alas!" returned the other, “I see nothing. Wak-
ing or sleeping, nothing."
Barnaby looked curiously at his eyes, and touching
them with his fingers, as an inquisitive child might, led
him towards the house.
“ You have come a long distance,” said the widow,
meeting him at the door. “How have you found your
way so far?”
of Use and necessity are good teachers, as I have heard
-the best of any,” said the blind man, sitting down
upon the chair to which Barnaby had led him, and put-
ting his hat and stick upon the red-tiled floor. “May
neither you nor your son ever learn under them. They
are rough masters.”
“ You have wandered from the road, too,” said the
widow, in a tone of pity.
“Maybe, maybe," returned the blind man, with a
sigh and yet with something of a smile upon his face,
“that's likely. Handposts and milestones are dumb,
indeed, to me. Thank you the more for this rest and
this refreshing drink!”
As he spoke he raised the mug of water to his mouth.
It was clear and cold and sparkling, but not to his taste,
nevertheless, or his thirst was not very great, for he
only wetted his lips and put it down again.
He wore, hanging with a long strap round his neck, a
kind of scrip or wallet, in which to carry food. The
widow set some bread and cheese before him, but he
thanked her, and said that through the kindness of the
charitable he had broken his fast once since morning,

359
and was not hungry. When he had made her this re-
ply, he opened his wallet and took out a few pence,
which it was all it appeared to contain.
“Might I make bold to ask,” he said, turning towards
where Barnaby stood looking on, “ that one who has
the gift of sight would lay this out for me in bread to
keep me on my way? Heaven's blessing on the young
feet that will bestir themselves in aid of one so helpless
as a sightless man!”
Barnaby looked at his mother, who nodded assent; in
another moment he was gone upon his charitable errand.
The blind man sat listening with an attentive face until
long after the sound of his retreating footsteps was in-
audible to the widow, and then said suddenly and in a
very altered tone:
“There are various degrees and kinds of blindness,
widow. There is the connubial blindness, ma'am, which
perhaps you may have observed in the course of your own
experience, and which is a kind of wilful and self-bandag-
ing blindness. There is the blindness of party, ma'am,
and public men, which is the blindness of a mad bull
in the midst of a regiment of soldiers clothed in red.
There is the blind confidence of youth, which is the
blindness of young kittens, whose eyes have not yet
opened on the world; and there is that physical blind-
ness, ma'am, of which I am, contrairy to my own desire,
a most illustrious example. Added to these, ma'am, is
that blindness of the intellect, of which we have a speci-
men in your interesting son, and which, having some-
times glimmerings and dawnings of the light, is scarcely
to be trusted as a total darkness. Therefore, ma'am, I
have taken the liberty to get him out of the way for a
short time, while you and I confer together, and this
precaution arising out of the delicacy of my sentiments
towards yourself, you will excuse me, ma’am, I know."
Having delivered himself of this speech with many
flourishes of manner, he drew from beneath his coat a
flat stone bottle, and holding the cork between his teeth,
qualified his mug of water with a plentiful infusion of
the liquor it contained. He politely drained the bumper
to her health, and the ladies, and setting it down empty,
smacked his lips with infinite relish.
“I am a citizen of the world, ma’am," said the blind
man, corking his bottle, “and if I seem to conduct

myself with freedom, it is therefore. You wonder who
I am, ma'am, and what has brought me here. Such
experience of human nature as I have leads me to that
conclusion, without the aid of eyes by which to read
the movements of your soul as depicted in your feminine
features. I will satisfy your curiosity immediately,
ma'am, im-mediately.” With that he slapped his bottle
on its broad back, and having put it under his garment
as before, crossed his legs and folded his arms, and
settled himself in his chair, previous to proceeding any
further.
The change in his manner was so unexpected, the
craft and wickedness of his deportment were so much
aggravated by his condition for we are accustomed to
see in those who have lost a human sense, something in
its place almost divine—and this alteration bred so many
fears in her whom he addressed, that she could not pro-
nounce one word. After waiting, as it seemed, for
some remark or answer, and waiting in vain, the visitor
resumed:
“Madam, my name is Stagg. A friend of mine who
has desired the honour of meeting with you any time
these five years past has commissioned me to call upon
you. I should be glad to whisper that gentleman's
name in your ear.-Zounds, ma'am, are you deaf? Do
you hear me say that I should be glad to whisper my
friend's name in your ear?”.
“ You need not repeat it,” said the widow, with a
stified groan; “I see too well from whom you come.”
“But as a man of honour, ma'am," said the blind
man, striking himself on the breast, “whose credentials
must not be disputed, I take leave to say that I will
mention that gentleman's name. Ay, ay,” he added,
seeming to catch with his quick ear the very motion of
her hand, “but not aloud. With your leave, ma’am, I
desire the favour of a whisper.”
She moved towards him, and stooped down. He
muttered a word in her ear; and, wringing her hands,
she paced up and down the room like one distracted.
The blind man, with perfect composure, produced his
bottle again, mixed another glass-full; put it up as be-
fore; and, drinking from time to time, followed her with
his face in silence.
“You are slow in conversation, widow,” he said after

a time, pausing in his draught. “We shall have to
talk before your son."
“What would you have me do," she answered.
" What do you want?”
“ We are poor, widow, we are poor," he retorted,
stretching out his right hand, and rubbing his thumb
upon his palm.
“Poor!” she cried. “And what am I?”
“ Comparisons are odious," said the blind man. “I
don't know, I don't care. I say that we are poor. My
friend's circumstances are indifferent, and so are mine.
We must have our rights, widow, or we must be bought
off. But you know that, as well as I, so where is the.
use of talking?"
She still walked wildly to and fro. At length, stop-
ping abruptly before him, she said:
“Is he near here?”.
“He is. Close at hand.”
“Then I am lost!”
“Not lost, widow,” said the blind man, calmly; “ only
found. Shall I call him?”
“Not for the world,” she answered, with a shudder.
“ Very good,” he replied, crossing his legs again, for
he had made as though he would rise and walk to the
door. “As you please, widow. His presence is not
necessary that I know of. But both he and I must live;
to live, we must eat and drink; to eat and drink, we
must have money-I say no more."
“Do you know how pinched and destitute I am?" she
retorted. “I do not think you do, or can. If you had
eyes, and could look round you on this poor place, you
would have pity on me. Oh! let your heart be softened
by your own affliction, friend, and have some sympathy
with mine."
The blind man snapped his fingers as he answered:
“-Beside the question, ma'am, beside the question.
I have the softest heart in the world, but I can't live
upon it. Many a gentleman lives well upon a soft head,
who would find a heart of the same quality a very great
drawback. Listen to me. This is a matter of business,
with which sympathies and sentiments have nothing to
do. As a mutual friend, I wish to arrange it in a satis-
factory manner, if possible; and thus the case stands.
If you are very poor now, it's your own choice. You

have friends who, in case of need, are always ready to
help you. My friend is in a more destitute and desolate
situation than most men, and you and he being linked
together in a common cause, he naturally looks to you
to assist him. He has boarded and lodged with me a
long time (for as I said just now, I am very soft-hearted),
and I quite approve of his entertaining this opinion.
You have always had a roof over your head; he has
always been an outcast. You have your son to com-
fort and assist you; he has nobody at all. The advan-
tages must not be all one side. You are in the same
boat, and we must divide the ballast a little more
equally.”
She was about to speak, but he checked her, and went
on.
“The only way of doing this is by making up a little
purse now and then for my friend; and that's what I
advise. He bears you no malice that I know of, ma'am:
so little, that although you have treated him harshly
more than once, and driven him, I may say, out of doors,
he has that regard for you that I believe, even if you
dipappointed him now, he would consent to take charge
of your son, and to make a man of him.”
He laid a great stress on these latter words, and
paused, as if to find out what effect they had produced.
She only answered by her tears.
“He is a likely lad," said the blind man, thoughtfully,
“ for many purposes, and not ill-disposed to try his for-
tune in a little change and bustle, if I may judge from
what I heard of his talk with you to-night. Come. In
a word, my friend has pressing necessity for twenty
pounds. You, who can give up an annuity, can get that
sum for him. It's a pity you should be troubled. You
seem very comfortable here, and it's worth that much
to remain so. Twenty pounds, widow, is a' moderate
demand. You know where to apply for it; a post will
bring it to you. Twenty pounds."
She was about to answer him again, but again he
stopped her.
"Don't say anything hastily; you might be sorry
for it. Think of it a little while. Twenty pounds-of
other people's money-how easy! Turn it over in your
mind. I'm in no hurry. Night's coming on, and, if I
don't sleep here, I shall not go far. Twenty pounds!

363
Consider of it, ma'am, for twenty minutes; give each
pound a minute; that's a fair allowance. I'll enjoy the
air the while, which is very mild and pleasant in these
parts.” .
With these words he groped his way to the door, carry-
ing his chair with him. Then seating himself under a
spreading honeysuckle, and stretching his legs across
the threshold, so that no person could pass in or out
without his knowledge, he took from his pocket a pipe,
flint, steel, and tinder-box, and began to smoke. It was
a lovely evening, of that gentle kind and at that time
of year when the twilight is most beautiful. Pausing
now and then to let his smoke curl slowly off, and to
sniff the grateful fragrance of the flowers, he sat there
at his ease, as though the cottage were his proper dwell-
ing, and he had held undisputed possession of it all his
life—waiting for the widow's answer and for Barnaby's
return.
CHAPTER XLVI.
WHEN Barnaby returned with the bread, the sight of
the pious old pilgrim smoking his pipe, and making
himself so thoroughly at home, appeared to surprise
even him; the more so, as that worthy person, instead
of putting up the loaf in his wallet as a scarce and pre-
cious article, tossed it carelessly on the table, and pro-
ducing his bottle, bade him sit down and drink.
“For I carry some comfort, you see,” he said. “Taste
that. Is it good?”
The water stood in Barnaby's eyes as he coughed from
the strength of the draught, and answered in the affirma-
tive.
“ Drink some more," said the blind man; “don't be
afraid of it. You don't taste anything like that,
often, eh?”
“Often,” cried Barnaby. “Never!”
“Too poor?" returned the blind man with a sigh. “Ay.
That's bad. Your mother, poor soul, would be happier
if she was richer, Barnaby.”
“Why, so I tell her the very thing I told her just
before you came to-night, when all that gold was in the
sky,” said Barnaby, drawing his chair nearer to him,

and looking eagerly in his face. “Tell me. Is there
any way of being rich that I could find out?” .
“Any way! A hundred ways.”
“Ay, ay ? he returned. “Do you say so? Whaü are
they? Nay, mother, it's for your sake I ask; not mine;
for yours, indeed. What are they?"
The blind man turned his face, on which there was a
smile of triumph, to where the widow stood in great dis-
tress, and answered:
“Why, they are not to be found out by stay-at-homes,
my good friend.”
“By stay-at-homes!” cried Barnaby, plucking at his
sleeve. “But I am not one. Now, there you mistake.
I am often out before the sun, and travel home when he
has gone to rest. I am away in the woods before the
day has reached the shady places, and am often there
when the bright moon is peeping through the boughs,
and looking down upon the other moon that lives in
water. As I walk along, I try to find, among the grass
and moss, some of that small money for which she works
so hard and used to shed so many tears. As I lie asleep
in the shade, I dream of it-dream of digging it up in
heaps; and spying it out, hidden under bushes; and see-
ing it sparkle, as the dew-drops do, among the leaves.
But I never find it. Tell me where it is. I'd go there,
if the journey were a whole year long, because I know
she would be happier when I came home and brought
some with me. Speak again. I'll listen if you talk all
night."
The blind man passed his hand lightly over the poor
fellow's face, and finding that his elbows were planted
on the table, that his chin rested on his two hands, that
he leaned eagerly forward, and that his whole manner
expressed the utmost interest and anxiety, paused for a
minute as though he desired the widow to observe this
fully, and then made answer:
It's in the world, bold Barnaby, the merry world;
not in solitary places like those you pass your time in,
but in crowds, where there's noise and rattle.”
"Good! good!” cried Barnaby, rubbing his hands.
“Yes! I love that. Grip loves it too. It suits us both.
That's brave!
66- The kind of places," said the blind man, “that a
young fellow likes; and in which a good son may do

more for his mother, and himself to boot, in a month,
than he could here in all his life—that is, if he had a
friend, you know, and some one to advise with.”
“ You hear this, mother?” cried Barnaby, turning to
her with delight. “Never tell me we shouldn't heed it,
if it lay shining at our feet. Why do we heed it so much
now? Why do you toil from morning until night?"
“Surely,” said the blind man, “surely. Have you no
answer, widow? Is your mind,” he slowly added, “not
made up yet?”
“Let me speak with you,” she answered, “ apart.”
“ Lay your hand upon my sleeve,” said Stagg, rising
from the table, “and lead me where you will. Courage,
bold Barnaby. We'll talk more of this; I've a fancy
for you. Wait there till I come back. Now, widow.”
She led him out at the door, and into the little garden
where they stopped.
“You are a fit agent,” she said, in a half breathless
manner, “and well represent the man who sent you
here.”
“I'll tell him that you said so," Stagg retorted. “He
has a regard for you, and will respect me the more (if
possible) for your praise. We must have our rights, .
widow."
“Rights! Do you know," she said, “that a word from
me-
“Why do you stop?" returned the blind man calmly,
after a long pause.“ Do I know that a word from you
would place my friend in the last position of the dance
of life? Yes, I do. What of that? It will never be
spoken, widow.”
“You are sure of that?"
“Quite—so sure, that I don't come here to discuss the
question. I say we must have our rights, or we must be
bought off. Keep to that point, or let me return to my
young friend, for I have an interest in the lad, and desire
to put him in the way of making his fortune. Bah!
you needn't speak,” he added hastily; “I know what
you would say: you have hinted at it once already.
Have I no feeling for you because I am blind? No, I
have not. Why do you expect me, being in darkness,
to be better than men who have their sight-why should
you? Is the hand of Heaven more manifest in my hav-
ing no eyes, than in your having two? It's the cant of
me Why do you se.

you folks to be horrified if a blind man robs, or lies, or
steals; oh, yes, it's far worse in him who can barely live
on the few half-pence that are thrown to him in streets,
than in you, who can see, and work, and are not depend-
ent on the mercies of the world. A curse on you! You
who have five senses may be wicked at your pleasure;
we who have four, and want the most important, are to
live and be moral on our affliction. The true charity
and justice of rich to poor, all the world over!”
He paused a moment when he had said these words,
and caught the sound of money jingling in her hand.
“Well?” he cried, quickly resuming his former man-
ner. “That should lead to something. The point,
widow ?”
“ First answer me one question,” she replied. “You
say he is close at hand. Has he left London?”
“ Being close at hand, widow, it would seem he has,"
returned the blind man.
“I mean for good? You know that.”
“ Yes, for good. The truth is, widow, that his making
a longer stay there might have had disagreeable conse-
quences. He has come away for that reason.”
• “Listen,” said the widow, telling some money out,
upon a bench beside them. “ Count.”
"Six," said the blind man, listening attentively. “Any
more?"
“ They are the savings,” she answered “of five years.
Six guineas.”
He put out his hand for one of the coins; felt it care-
fully, put it between his teeth, rung it on the bench,
and nodded to her to proceed.
“ These have been scraped together and laid by, lest
sickness or death should separate my son and me. They
have been purchased at the price of much hunger, hard
labour, and want of rest. If you can take them-do-on
condition that you leave this place upon the instant, and
enter no more into that room, where he sits now, expect-
ing your return.”
* Six guineas,” said the blind man, shaking his head,
“though of the fullest weight that were ever coined, fall
very far short of twenty pounds, widow."
“For such a sum. as you know, I must write to a dis-
tant part of the country. To do that, and receive an
answer, I must have time”.

“ Two days?” said Stagg.
“More."
“Four days?"
“ A week. Return on this day week, at the same
hour, but not to the house. Wait at the corner of the
lane."
“Of course,” said the blind man, with a crafty look,
“ I shall find you there?”
“Where else can I take refuge? Is it not enough that
you have made a beggar of me, and that I have sacri-
ficed my whole store, so hardly earned, to preserve this
home?"
“Humph!” said the blind man, after some considera-
tion. Set me with my face towards the point you speak
of, and in the middle of the road. Is this the spot?”
“It is.”
“On this day week at sunset. And think of him
within doors.-For the present, good night."
She made him no answer, nor did he stop for any. He
went slowly away, turning his head from time to time,
and stopping to listen, as if he were curious to know
whether he was watched by any one. The shadows of
night were closing fast around, and he was soon lost in
the gloom. It was not, however, until she had traversed
the lane from end to end, and made sure that he was
gone, that she re-entered the cottage, and hurriedly
barred the door and window.
“Mother!” said Barnaby. “What is the matter?
Where is the blind man?”
“ He is gone.”
“Gone!' he cried, starting up. “I must have more
talk with him. Which way did he take?”
“I don't know,” she answered, folding her arms about
him. “You must not go out to-night. There are ghosts
and dreams abroad.”
“ Ay?” said Barnaby, in a frightened whisper.
“It is not safe to stir. We must leave this place
to-morrow.”
“ This place! This cottage—and the little garden,
mother!"
“Yes! To-morrow morning at sunrise. We must
travel to London; loose ourselves in that wide place-
there would be some trace of us in any other town-then
travel on again, and find some new abode.”

Little persuasion was required to reconcile Barnaby
to anything that promised change. In another minute,
he was wild with delight; in another, full of grief at the
prospect of parting with his friends the dogs; in another,
wild again; then he was fearful of what she had said to
prevent his wandering abroad that night, and full of
terrors and strange questions. His lightheartedness in
the end surmounted all his other feelings, and lying
down in his clothes to the end that he might be ready
on the morrow, he soon fell fast asleep before the poor
turf fire.
His mother did not close her eyes, but sat beside him,
watching. Every breath of wind sounded in her ears
like that dreaded footstep at the door, or like that hand
upon the latch, and made the calm summer night a
night of horror. At length the welcome day appeared.
When she had made the little preparations which were
needful for their journey, and had prayed upon her
knees with many tears, she roused Barnaby, who jumped
up gaily at her summons.
His clothes were few enough, and to carry Grip was a
labour of love. As the sun shed his earliest beams upon
the earth, they closed the door of their deserted home,
and turned away. The sky was blue and bright. The
air was fresh and filled with a thousand perfumes.
Barnaby looked upward, and laughed with all his heart.
But it was a day he usually devoted to a long ramble,
and one of the dogs—the ugliest of them all-came
bounding up, and jumping round him in the fulness of
his joy. He had to bid him go back in a surly tone, and
his heart smote him while he did so. The dog retreated;
turned with a half-incredulous, half-imploring look;
came a little back; and stopped..
It was the last appeal of an old companion and a
faithful friend-cast off. Barnaby could bear no more,
and as he shook his head and waved his playmate home,
he burst into tears.
“Oh, mother, mother, how mournful he will be when
he scratches at the door, and finds it always shut!"
There was such a sense of home in the thought that,
though her own eyes overflowed, she would not have
obliterated the recollection of it, either from her own
mind or from his, for the wealth of the whole wide
world.

CHAPTER XLVII.
In the exhaustless catalogue of Heaven's mercies to
mankind, the power we have of finding some germs of
comfort in the hardest trials must ever occupy the fore-
most place; not only because it supports and upholds us
when we most require to be sustained, but because in this
source of consolation there is something, we have reason
to believe, of the divine spirit; something of that good-
ness which detects amidst our own evil doings a redeem-
ing quality; something which, even in our fallen nature,
we possess in common with the angels; which had its
being in the old time when they trod the earth, and
lingers on it yet, in pity.
How often, on their journey, did the widow remember
with a grateful heart that out of his deprivation Bar-
naby's cheerfulness and affection sprung! How often
did she call to mind that, but for that, he might have
been sullen, morose, unkind, far removed from her---
vicious, perhaps, and cruel! How often had she cause
for comfort, in his strength, and hope, and in his simple
nature! Those feeble powers of mind which rendered
him so soon forgetful of the past, save in brief gleams
and flashes-even they were a comfort now. The world
to him was full of happiness; in every tree, and plant,
and flower, in every bird, and beast, and tiny insect
whom a breath of summer wind laid low upon the
ground, he had delight. His delight was hers; and
where many a wise son would have made her sorrowful,
this poor light-hearted idiot filled her breast with thank-
fulness and love.
Their stock of money was low, but from the hoard she
had told into the blind man's hand the widow had with-
held one guinea. This, with the few pence she possessed
besides, was to two persons of their frugal habits a
goodly sum in bank. Moreover, they had Grip in com-
pany; and when they must otherwise have changed the
guinea, it was but to make him exhibit outside an ale-
house door, or in a village street, or in the grounds or
gardens of a mansion of the better sort, and scores, who
usum in banku must otherwise, hit outside ar
to make him or in the groves, who

would have given nothing in charity, were ready to
bargain for more amusement from the talking bird.
One day-for they moved slowly, and, although they
had many rides in carts and wagons, were on the road
a week— Barnaby, with Grip upon his shoulder and his
mother following, begged permission at a trim lodge to
go up to the great house, at the other end of the avenue,
and show his raven. The man within was inclined to
give them admittance, and was indeed about to do so,
when a stout gentleman with a long whip in his hand,
and a flushed face which seemed to indicate that he had
had his morning's draught, rode up to the gate, and
called in a loud voice and with more oaths than the oc-
casion seemed to warrant to have it opened directly.
" Who hast thou got here?” said the gentleman
angrily, as the man threw the gate wide open, and
pulled off his hat, "who are these? Eh? art a beggar,
woman?”
The widow answered, with a curtsey, that they were
poor travellers.
“ Vagrants,” said the gentleman, “vagrants and vaga-
bonds. Thee wish to be made acquainted with the cage,
dost thee—the cage, the stocks, and the whipping-post?
Where dost come from?”
She told him in a timid manner-for he was very loud,
hoarse, and red-faced,and besought him not to be
angry, for they meant no harm and would go upon their
way that moment.
"Don't be too sure of that,” replied the gentleman,
"we don't allow vagrants to roam about this place! I
know what thou want'st-stray linen drying on hedges,
and stray poultry, eh? What hast got in that basket,
lazy hound?”
"Grip, Grip, Grip-Grip the clever, Grip the wicked,
Grip the knowing-Grip, Grip, Grip,” cried the raven,
whom Barnaby had shut up on the approach of this
stern personage.
“I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil, Never say die.
Hurrah, Bow, wow, wow, Polly put the kettle on, we'll all
have tea.”
“Take the virmin out, scoundrel,” said the gentleman,
“ and let me see him.
Barnaby, thus condescendingly addressed, produced
his bird, but not without much fear and trembling, and

371
set him down upon the ground; which he had no sooner
done than Grip drew fifty corks at least, and then began
to dance; at the same time eyeing the gentleman with
surprising insolence of manner, and screwing his head
so much on one side that he appeared desirous of screw-
ing it off upon the spot.
The cork-drawing seemed to make a greater impres-
sion on the gentleman's mind than the raven's power
of speech, and was indeed particularly adapted to his
habits and capacity. He desired to have that done
again, but despite his being very peremptory, and not-
withstanding that Barnaby coaxed to the utmost, Grip
turned a deaf ear to the request, and preserved a dead
silence.
“Bring him along," said the gentleman, pointing to
the house. But Grip, who had watched the action, an.
ticipated his master, by hopping on before them-con-
stantly flapping his wings, and screaming “cook!"
meanwhile, as a hint perhaps that there was company
coming, and a small collation would be acceptable.
Barnaby and his mother walked on, on either side of
the gentleman on horseback, who surveyed each of
them from time to time in a proud and coarse manner,
and occasionally thundered out some question, the tone
of which alarmed Barnaby so much that he could find
no answer, and, as a matter of course, could make him
no reply. On one of these occasions, when the gentle-
man appeared disposed to exercise his horsewhip, the
widow ventured to inform him in a low voice and with
tears in her eyes that her son was of weak mind.
“An idiot, eh?” said the gentleman, looking at Bar-
naby as he spoke. “And how long hast been an
idiot?”
“She knows,” was Barnaby's timid answer, pointing
to his mother—“1-always, I believe.”
“From his birth,” said the widow.
“I don't believe it,” cried the gentleman, “not a bit
of it. It's an excuse not to work. There's nothing like
flogging to cure that disorder. I'd make a difference in
him in ten minutes, I'll be bound.”
“Heaven has made none in more than twice ten years,
sir,” said the widow mildly.
" Then why don't you shut him up? we pay enough
for county institutions, damn 'em. But thou'd rather

drag him about to excite charity-of course. Ay, I know
thee."
Now this gentleman had various endearing appella-
tions among his intimate friends. By some he was
called “a country gentleman of the true school,” by
some “a fine old country gentleman,” by some “a
sporting gentleman,” by some “a thorough-bred Eng-
lishman,'' by some “a genuine John Bull;" but they all
agreed in one respect, and that was, that it was a pity
that there were not more like him, and that, because
there were not, the country was going to rack and ruin
every day. He was in the commission of the peace, and
could write his name almost legibly; but his greatest
qualifications were that he was more severe with poach-
ers, was a better shot, a harder rider, had better horses.
kept better dogs, could eat more solid food, drink more
strong wine, go to bed every night more drunk and get
up every morning more sober, than any man in the
county. In knowledge of horse-flesh he was almost
equal to a farrier, in stable learning he surpassed his
own head groom, and in gluttony not a pig on his estate
was a match for him. He had no seat in Parliament
himself, but he was extremely patriotic, and usually
drove his voters up to the poll with his own hands. He
was warmly attached to church and state, and never
appointed to the living in his gift any but a three-bottle
man and a first-rate fox-hunter. He mistrusted the
honesty of all poor people who could read and write, and
had a secret jealousy of his own wife (a young lady
whom he had married for what his friends called “the
good old English reason,” that her father's property ad-
joined his own) for possessing those accomplishments in
a greater degree than himself. In short, Barnaby being
an idiot, and Grip a creature of mere brute instinct, it
would be very hard to say what this gentleman was.
He rode up to the door of a handsome house approached
by a great flight of steps, where a man was waiting to
take his horse, and led the way into a large hall, which,
spacious as it was, was tainted with the fumes of last
night's stale debauch. Great-coats, riding-whips, bridles,
top-boots, spurs, and such gear, were strewn about on
all sides, and formed, with some huge stags' antlers and
a few portraits of dogs, and horses, its principal embel-
lishments.

Throwing himself into a great chair (in which, by-the-
bye, he often snored away the night when he had been,
according to his admirers; a finer country gentleman
than usual) he bade the man tell his mistress to come
down: and presently there appeared, a little flurried; as
it seemed, by the unwonted summons, a lady much
younger than himself, who had the appearance of being
in delicate health and not too happy.
“Here! Thou'st no delight in following the hounds as
an English woman should have,” said the gentleman,
“ See to this here. That'll please thee, perhaps.”
The lady smiled, sat down at a little distance from
him, and glanced at Barnaby with a look of pity.
“He's an idiot, the woman says,” observed the gentle-
man, shaking his head; “I don't believe it."
“Are you his mother?" asked the lady.
She answered yes.
“What's the use of asking her?" said the gentleman,
thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets. “She'lí
tell thee so, of course. Most likely he's hired, at so
much a day. There. Get on. Make him do some-
thing.”
Grip having by this time recovered his urbanity, con-
descended, at Barnaby's solicitation, to repeat his vari-
ous phases of speech, and to go through the whole of his
performances with the utmost success. The corks and
The never say die afforded the gentleman so much de-
light that he demanded the repetition of this part of the
entertainment, until Grip got into his basket, and posi-
tively refused to say another word, good or bad. The
lady, too, was much amused with him; and the closing
point of his obstinacy so delighted her husband that he
burst into a roar of laughter, and demanded his price.
Barnaby looked as though he didn't understand his
meaning. Probably he did not.
“His price,” said the gentleman, rattling the money
in his pockets, “what dost want for him? How much?”
“He's not to be sold,” replied Barnaby, shutting up the
basket in a great hurry and throwing the strap over his
shoulder. "Mother, come away.”
“Thou seest how much of an idiot he is, book-learner,”
said the gentleman looking scornfully at his wife. “He
can make a bargain. What dost want for him, old
woman?”

“He is my son's constant companion," said the widow.
“He is not to be sold, sir, indeed.”
“ Not to be sold!” cried the gentleman, growing ten
times redder, hoarser, and louder than before. “Not
to be sold!"
“ Indeed no,” she answered. “We have never thought
of parting with him, sir, I do assure you."
He was evidently about to make a very passionate
retort, when a few murmured words from his wife hap-
pening to catch his ear, he turned sharply round, and
said, “Eh? What?"
“ We can hardly expect them to sell the bird against
their own desires,” she faltered. “If they prefer to keep
him—”
“Prefer to keep him!” he echoed! “ These people who
go tramping about the country, a pilfering and vaga-
bondising on all hands, prefer to keep a bird, when a
landed proprietor and a justice asks his price! That old
woman's been to school. I know she has. Don't tell
me no,” he roared to the widow, “I say yes.”
Barnaby's mother pleaded guilty to the accusation,
and hoped there was no harm in it.
“No harm!” said the gentleman. “No. No harm.
No harm, ye old rebel, not a bit of harm. If my clerk
was here, I'd set ye in the stocks, I would, or lay ye in
jail for prowling up and down, on the look-out for petty.
larcenies, ye limb of a gipsy. Here, Simon, put these
pilferers out, shove 'em into the road, out with 'em! Ye
don't want to sell the bird, ye that come here to beg,
don't ye? If they an't out in double quick, set the dogs
upon 'em!”
They waited for no further dismissal, but fled precipi-
tately, leaving the gentleman to storm away by himself
(for the poor lady had already retreated), and making a
great many vain attempts to silence Grip, who, excited
by the noise, drew corks enough for a city feast as they
hurried down the avenue, and appeared to congratulate
himself beyond measure on having been the cause of
the disturbance. When they had nearly reached the
lodge another servant, emerging from the shrubbery,
feigned to be very active in ordering them off, but this
man put a crown into the widow's hand, and whispering
that his lady sent it, thrust them gently from the gate.
This incident only suggested to the widow's mind,

when they halted at an alehouse some miles further on,
and heard the justice's character as given by his friends,
that perhaps something more than capacity of stomach
and taste for the kennel and the stable were required
to form either a perfect country gentleman, a thorough-
bred Englishman, or a genuine John Bull; and that pos-
sibly the terms were sometimes misappropriated, not to
say disgraced. She little thought then that a circum-
stance so slight would ever influence their future for-
tunes; but time and experience enlightened her in this
respect.
"Mother,” said Barnaby, as they were sitting next
day in a wagon which was taking them to within ten
miles of the capital, “ we're going to London first, you
said. Shall we see that blind man there?”
She was about to answer “Heaven forbid!” but
checked herself, and told him no, she thought not; why
did he ask?
“He's a wise man,” said Barnaby, with a thoughtful
countenance. “I wish that we may meet with him
again. What was it he said of crowds? That gold was
to be found where people crowded, and not among the.
trees and in such quiet places? He spoke as if he loved
it; London is a crowded place; I think we shall meet
him there.”
“But why do you desire to see him, love?" she asked.
“Because,” said Barnaby, looking wistfully at her,
“he talked to me about gold, which is a rare thing, and
say what you will, a thing you would like to have, I
know. And because he came and went away so strangely
- just as white-headed old men come sometimes to my
bed's foot in the night, and say what I can't remember
when the bright day returns. He told me that he'd
come back. I wonder why he broke his word!”
“But you never thought of being rich and gay before,
dear Barnaby. You have always been contented.”
He laughed and bade her say that again, then cried,
“Ay, ay-oh, yes," and laughed once more. Then some-
thing passed that caught his fancy, and the topic wan-
dered from his mind, and was succeeded by another just
as fleeting.
But it was plain from what he had said, and from his
returning to the point more than once that day, and on
the next, that the blind man's visit, and indeed his

words, had taken strong possession of his mind. -
Whether the idea of wealth had occurred to him for the
first time on looking at the golden clouds that evening
-and images were often presented to his thoughts by
outward objects quite as remote and distant; or whether
their poor and humble way of life had suggested it, by
contrast, long ago; or whether the accident (as he would
deem it) of the blind man pursuing the current of his
own remarks, had done so at the moment; or he had
been impressed by the mere circumstance of the man
being blind, and, therefore, unlike any one with whom
he had talked before; it was impossible to tell. She
tried every means to discover, but in vain; and the
probability is that Barnaby himself was equally in the
dark.
It filled her with uneasiness to find him harping on
this string, but all that she could do was to lead him
quickly to some other subject, and to dismiss it from his
brain. To caution him against their visitor, to show
any fear or suspicion in reference to him, would only
be, she feared, to increase that interest with which Bar-
naby regarded him, and to strengthen his desire to meet
him once again. She hoped, by plunging into the crowd,
to rid herself of her terrible pursuer, and then, by jour-
neying to a distance and observing increased caution,
if that were possible, to live again unknown, in secrecy
and peace.
They reached, in course of time, their halting-place
within ten miles of London, and lay there for the night,
after bargaining to be carried on for a trifle next day,
in a light van which was returning empty, and was to
start at five o'clock in the morning. The driver was
punctual, the road good-save for the dust, the weather
being very hot and dry—and at seven in the forenoon
of Friday, the second of June, one thousand seven hun-
dred and eighty, they alighted at the foot of Westmin-
ster Bridge, bade their conductor farewell, and stood
alone, together, on the scorching pavement. For the
freshness which night sheds upon such thoroughfares
had already departed, and the sun was shining with
uncommon lustre.

CHAPTER XLVIII.
UNCERTAIN where to go next, and bewildered by the
crowd of people who were already astir, they sat down
in one of the recesses of the bridge to rest. They soon
became aware that the stream of life was all pouring
one way, and that a vast throng of persons were cross-
ing the river from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore in
unusual haste and evident excitement. They were, for
the most part, in knots of two or three or sometimes
half-a-dozen; they spoke little together-many of them
were quite silent-and hurried on as if they had one
absorbing object in view which was common to them all.
They were surprised to see that nearly every man in
this great concourse, which still came pouring past,
without slackening in the least, wore in his hat a blue
cockade, and that the chance passengers who were not
so decorated appeared timidly anxious to escape obser-
vation or attack, and gave them the wall as if they would
conciliate them. This, however, was natural enough,
considering their inferiority in point of numbers; for
the proportion of those who wore blue cockades to those
who were dressed as usual, was at least forty or fifty to
one. There was no quarrelling, however; the blue
cockades went swarming on, passing each other when
they could, and making all the speed that was possible
in such a multitude, and exchanged nothing more than
looks, and very often not even those, with such of the
passers-by as were not of their number.
At first the current of people had been confined to the
two pathways, and but a few more eager stragglers
kept the road. But after half an hour or so, the pas-
sage was completely blocked up by the great press,
which, being now closely wedged together, and impeded
by the carts and coaches it encountered, moved but
slowly, and was sometimes at a stand for five or ten
minutes together.
After the lapse of nearly two hours, the numbers
began to diminish visibly, and gradually dwindling
away, by little and little, left the bridge quite clear,
save that, now and then, some hot and dusty man with

the cockade in his hat, and his coat thrown over his
shoulder, went panting by, fearful of being too late, or
stopped to ask which way his friends had taken, and
being directed, hastened on again like one refreshed.
In this comparative solitude, which seemed quite strange
and novel after the late crowd, the widow had for the
first time an opportunity of inquiring, of an old man
who came and sat beside them, what was the meaning
of that great assemblage.
" Why, where have you come from," he returned,
" that you haven't heard of Lord George Gordon's great
association? This is the day that he presents the peti-
tion against the Catholics, God bless him!”
- What have all these men to do with that?" she asked.
“What have they to do with it!" the old man replied.
“Why, how you talk! Don't you know his lordship has
declared he won't present it to the house at all, unless it
is attended to the door by forty thousand good and true
men at least? There's a crowd for you!"
"A crowd indeed!” said Barnaby. “Do you hear
that, mother!”
“And they're mustering yonder, as I'm told,” resumed
the old man, “nigh upon a hundred thousand strong.
Ah! Let Lord George alone. He knows his power.
There'll be a good many faces inside them three windows
over there,” and he pointed to where the House of
Commons overlooked the river, “that'll turn pale when
good Lord George gets up this afternoon, and with
reason too! Ay, ay. Let his lordship alone. Let him
alone. He knows! And so, with much mumbling and
chuckling and shaking of his forefinger, he rose, with
the assistance of his stick, and tottered off.
“Mother!” said Barnaby, “that's a brave crowd he
talks of. Come!”
“Not to join it!” cried his mother.
“Yes, yes,” he answered, plucking at her sleeve.
“Why not? Come!”
“ You don't know,” she urged, “what mischief they
may do, where they may lead you, what their meaning
is. Dear Barnaby, for my sake”
“For your sake!” he cried, patting her hand. “Well!
It is for your sake, mother. You remember what the
blind man said about the gold. Here's a brave crowd!
Come! Or wait till I come back-yes, yes, wait here."

She tried with all the earnestness her fears engendered
to turn him from his purpose, but in vain. He was
stooping down to buckle on his shoe, when a hackney-
coach passed them rather quickly, and a voice inside
called to the driver to stop.
“Young man,” said a voice within.
“Who's that?” cried Barnaby, looking up.
“Do you wear this ornament?" returned the stranger,
holding out a blue cockade.
“In Heaven's name, no. Pray do not give it him!”
exclaimed the widow.
“Speak for yourself, woman,” said the man within the
coach, coldly. “Leave the young man to his choice;
he's old enough to make it, and to snap your apron-
strings. He knows, without your telling, whether he
wears the sign of a loyal Englishman or not."
Barnaby, trembling with impatience, cried “ Yes! yes,
yes, I do,” as he had cried a dozen times already. The
man threw him a cockade, and crying “Make haste to
Saint George's Fields,” ordered the coachman to drive
on fast; and left them.
With hands that trembled with his eagerness to fix
the bauble in his hat, Barnaby was adjusting it as he
best could, and hurriedly replying to the tears and en-
treaties of his mother, when two gentlemen passed on
the opposite side of the way. Observing them, and
seeing how Barnaby was occupied, they stopped, whis-
pered together for an instant, turned back, and came
over to them. .
“Why are you sitting here?" said one of them, who
was dressed in a plain suit of black, wore long lank hair,
and carried a great cane. “Why have you not gone
with the rest?"
“I am going, sir,” replied Barnaby, finishing his task,
and putting his hat on with an air of pride. “I shall be
there directly.”
“Say 'my lord,' young man, when his lordship does
you the honour of speaking to you," said the second
gentleman mildly. If you don't know Lord George
Gordon when you see him, it's high time you should.”
“Nay, Gashford,” said Lord George, as Barnaby
pulled off his hat again and made him a low bow, “it's
no great matter on a day like this, which every English-
man will remember with delight and pride. Put on

your hat, friend, and follow us, for you lag behind and
are late. It's past ten now. Didn't you know that the
hour for assembling was ten o'clock?"
Barnaby shook his head and looked vacantly from
one to the other.
“You might have known it, friend,” said Gashford,
“it was perfectly understood. How came you to be so
ill informed?"
“He cannot tell you, sir,” the widow interposed. “It's
of no use to ask him. We are but this morning come
from a long distance in the country, and know nothing
of these matters.”
“ The cause has taken a deep root, and has spread in
its branches far and wide,” said Lord George to his secre-
tary. “This is a pleasant hearing. I thank Heaven
for it.”
“Amen!” cried Gashford with a solemn face.
“You do not understand me, my lord,” said the
widow. “Pardon me, but you cruelly mistake my
meaning. We know nothing of these matters. We
have no desire or right to join in what you are about to
do. This is my son, my poor afflicted son, dearer to me
than my own life. In mercy's name, my lord, go your
way alone, and do not tempt him into danger!"
“My good woman,” said Gashford, “how can you!
Dear me! What do you mean by tempting and by
danger? Do you think his lordship is a roaring lion,
going about and seeking whom he may devour? God
bless me!”
“No, no, my lord, forgive me,” implored the widow,
lạying both her hands upon his breast, and scarcely
knowing what she did or said in the earnestness of her
supplication, “but there are reasons why you should
hear my earnest, mother's prayer, and leave my son
with me. Oh, do. He is not in his right senses, he is
not, indeed!”
“ It is a bad sign of the wickedness of these times,”
said Lord George, evading her touch, and colouring
deeply, “that those who cling to the truth and support
the right cause are set down as mad. Have you the
heart to say this of your own son, unnatural mother!”
“I am astonished at you!” said Gashford, with a kind
of meek severity, “This is a very sad picture of female
depravity.”

“He has surely no appearance," said Lord George,
glancing at Barnaby, and whispering in his secretary's
ear, “ of being deranged? And even if he had, we must
not construe any trifling peculiarity into madness. Which
of us,”—and here he turned red again—“would be safe,
if that were made the law!"
“Not one,” replied the secretary; “ in that case, the
greater the zeal, the truth, and talent; the more direct
the call from above; the clearer would be the madness.
With regard to this young man, my lord,” he added,
with a lip that slightly curled as he looked at Barnaby,
who stood twirling his hat, and stealthily beckoning
them to come away, “he is as sensible and self-pos-
sessed as any one I ever saw.".
“And you desire to make one of this great body?” said
Lord George, addressing him; “and intended to make
one, did you?”
"Yes-yes,” said Barnaby, with sparkling eyes. “To
be sure I did! I told her so myself.”
“I see,” replied Lord George, with a reproachful glance
at the unhappy mother. “I thought so. Follow me
and this gentleman, and you shall have your wish."
Barnaby kissed his mother tenderly on the cheek, and
bidding her be of good cheer, for their fortunes were
both made now, did as he was desired. She, poor
woman, followed too-with how much fear and grief it
would be hard to tell.
They passed quickly through the Bridge-road, where
the shops were all shut up (for the passage of the great
crowd and the expectation of their return. had alarmed
the tradesmen for their goods and windows), and where,
in the upper stories, all the inhabitants were congre-
gated, looking down into the street below, with faces
variously expressive of alarm, of interest, of expectancy,
and indignation. Some of these applauded, and some
hissed; but regardless of these interruptions—for the
noise of a vast congregation of people at a little distance
sounded in his ears like the roaring of a sea—Lord George
Gordon quickened his pace, and presently arrived before
Saint George's Fields.
They were really fields at that time, and of consider-
able extent. Here an immense multitude was collected,
bearing flags of various kinds and sizes, but all of the
same colour-blue, like the cockades-some sections

marching to and fro in military array, and others drawn
up in circles, squares, and lines. A large portion, both
of the bodies which paraded the ground and of those
.which remained stationary, were occupied in singing
hymns or psalms. With whomsoever this originated,
it was well done; for the sound of so many thousand
voices in the air must have stirred the heart of any man
within him, and could not fail to have a wonderful
effect upon enthusiasts, however mistaken.
Scouts had been posted in advance of the great body
to give notice of their leader's coming. These falling
back, the word was quickly passed through the whole
host, and for a short interval there ensued a profound
and death-like silence, during which the mass was so
still and quiet that the fluttering of a banner caught the
eye, and became a circumstance of note. Then they
burst into a tremendousshout, into another, and another,
and the air seemed rent and shaken, as if by the dis-
charge of cannon.
“Gashford,” said Lord George, pressing his secre-
tary's arm tight within his own, and speaking with as
much emotion in his voice as in his altered face, “I am
called indeed now. I feel and know it. I am the
leader of a host. If they summoned me at this moment
with one voice to lead them on to death, I'd do it-yes,
and fall first myself.”
“It is a proud sight," said the secretary. “It is a
noble day for England, and for the great cause through-
out the world. Such homage, my lord, as I, an humble
but devoted man, can render-"
“What are you doing!” cried his master, catching him
by both hands; for he had made a show of kneeling at
his feet. “Do not unfit me, dear Gashford, for the solemn
duty of this glorious day-_" the tears stood in the eyes
of the poor gentleman as he said the words.—“Let us
go among them; we have to find a place in some division
for this new recruit-give me your hand.”
Gashford slid his cold, insidious palm into his master's
grasp, and so, hand in hand, and followed still by Barnaby
and by his mother too, they mingled with the concourse.
They had by this time taken to their singing again,
and as their leader passed between their ranks, they
raised their voices to their utmost. Many of those who
were banded together to support the religion of their

country, even unto death, had never heard a hymn or
psalm in all their lives. But these fellows having for
the most part strong lungs, and being naturally fond of
singing, chanted any ribaldry or nonsense that occurred
to them, feeling pretty certain that it would not be
detected in the general chorus, and not caring very
much if it were. Many of these voluntaries were sung
under the very nose of Lord George Gordon, who, quite
unconscious of their burden, passed on with his usual
stiff and solemn deportment, very much edified and
delighted by the pious conduct of his followers.
So they went on and on, up this line, down that, round
the exterior of this circle, and on every side of that hol-
low square; and still there were lines, and squares, and
circles out of number to review. The day being now
intensely hot, and the sun striking down his fiercest
rays upon the field, those who carried heavy banners
began to grow faint and weary; most of the number
assembled were fain to pull off their neckcloths, and
throw their coats and waistcoats open; and some towards
the centre, quite overpowered by the excessive heat,
which was of course rendered more unendurable by the
multitude around them, lay down upon the grass, and
offered all they had about them for a drink of water.
Still, no man left the ground, not even of those who were
so distressed; still, Lord George, steaming from every
pore, went on with Gashford; and still Barnaby and his
mother followed close behind them.
They had arrived at the top of a long line of some eight
hundred men in single file, and Lord George had turned
his head to look back, when a loud cry of recognition-
in that peculiar and half-stifled tone which a voice
has when it is raised in the open air and in the midst of
a great concourse of persons-was heard, and a man
stepped with a shout of laughter from the rank, and
smote Barnaby on the shoulders with his heavy hand.
“How now!” he cried. “Barnaby Rudge! Why,
where have you been hiding for these hundred years!"
Barnaby had been thinking within himself that the
smell of the trodden grass brought back his old days at
cricket, when he was a young boy and played on Chigwell
Green. Confused by this sudden and boisterous ad-
dress, he stared in a bewildered manner at the man,
and could scarcely say, “What! Hugh!"

"Hugh!" echoed the other; "ay, Hugh-Maypole
Hugh! You remember my dog? He's alive now, and
will know you, I warrant. What, you wear the colour,
do you? Well done! Ha, ha, ha!”
"You know this young man, I see,” said Lord George.
“Know him, my lord! as well as I know my own
right hand. My captain knows him. We all know
him.”
" Will you take him into your division?”
“It hasn't in it a better, nor a nimbler, nor a more
active man, than Barnaby Rudge,” said Hugh. “Show
me the man that says it has! Fall in, Barnaby. He
shall march, my lord, between me and Dennis, and he
shall carry,” he added, taking a flag from the hand of a
tired man who tendered it, “the gayest silken streamer
in this valiant army."
“In the name of God, no!” shrieked the widow, dart-
ing forward. “Barnaby—my lord-see-he'll come back
-Barnaby-Barnaby!"
6 Women in the field!” cried Hugh, stepping between
them, and holding her off. “Holloa! My captain
there!"
“What's the matter here?” cried Simon Tappertit,
bustling up in a great heat. “Do you call this order?”
“Nothing like it, captain," answered Hugh, still hold-
ing her back with his outstretched hand. “It's against
all orders. Ladies are carrying off our gallant soldiers
from their duty. The word of command, captain!
They're filing off the ground. Quick!"
“Close!” cried Simon, with the whole power of his
lungs. “Form! March!”.
She was thrown to the ground; the whole field was in
motion; Barnaby was whirled away into the heart of a
dense mass of men, and she saw him no more.

CHAPTER XLIX.
THE mob had been divided from its first assemblage
into four divisions: the London, the Westminster, the
Southwark, and the Scotch. Each of these divisions
being subdivided into various bodies, and these bodies
being drawn up in various forms and figures, the gen-
eral arrangement was, except to the few chiefs and
leaders, as unintelligible as the plan of a great battle to
the meanest soldier in the field. It was not without its
method, however; for, in a very short space of time after
being put in motion, the crowd had resolved itself into
three great parties, and were prepared, as had been
arranged, to cross the river by different bridges, and
make for the House of Commons in separate detach-
ments.
At the head of that division which had Westminster
Bridge for its approach to the scene of action, Lord
George Gordon took his post, with Gashford at his right
hand, and sundry ruffians of most unpromising appear-
ance forming a kind of staff about him. The conduct
of a second party, whose route lay by Blackfriars, was
entrusted to a committee of management, including
perhaps a dozen men; while the third, which was to go
by London Bridge, and through the main streets, in
order that their numbers and their serious intentions
might be the better known and appreciated by the citi-
zens, were led by Simon Tappertit (assisted by a few
subalterns, selected from the Brotherhood of United
Bull-dogs), Dennis the hangman, Hugh, and some
others.
The word of command being given, each of these
great bodies took the road assigned to it, and departed
on its way in perfect order and profound silence. That
which went through the city greatly exceeded the others
in number, and was of such prodigious extent that when
the rear began to move, the front was nearly four
miles in advance, notwithstanding that the men
marched three abreast and followed very close upon
each other.
At the head of this party, in the place where Hugh,

in the madness of his humour, had stationed him, and
walking between that dangerous companion and the
hangman, went Barnaby; as many a man among the
thousands who looked on that day afterwards remem-
bered well. Forgetful of all other things in the ecstacy
of the moment, his face flushed and his eyes sparkling
with delight, heedless of the weight of the great banner
he carried, and mindful only of its flashing in the sun
and rustling in the summer breeze, on he went, proud,
happy, elated past all telling—the only light-hearted, un-
designing creature in the whole assembly.
“What do you think of this?” asked Hugh, as they
passed through the crowded streets, and looked up at
the windows which were thronged with spectators.
“They have all turned out to see our flags and
streamers? Eh, Barnaby? Why, Barnaby's the greatest
man of all the pack! His flag's the largest of the lot,
the brightest too. There's nothing in the show like
Barnaby. All eyes are turned on him. Ha, ha, ha!”
“Don't make that din, brother,” growled the hang-
man, glancing with no very approving eyes at Barnaby
as he spoke. "I hope he don't think there's nothing to
be done but carrying that there piece of blue rag, like
a boy at a breaking-up. You're ready for action, I hope,
eh? You, I mean,” he added, nudging Barnaby roughly
with his elbow. “What are you staring at? Why don't
you speak?” .
Barnaby had been gazing at his flag, and looked va-
cantly from his questioner to Hugh.
“He don't understand your way,” said the latter.
“Here, I'll explain it to him. Barnaby, old boy, attend
to me,”
“I'll attend,” said Barnaby, looking anxiously round;
“but I wish I could see her somewhere."
“See who?" demanded Dennis in a gruff tone. “You
an't in love, I hope, brother? That an't the sort of thing
for us, you know. We mustn't have no love here.”
“She would be proud indeed to see me now, eh, Hugh?"
said Barnaby. “Wouldn't it make her glad to see me
at the head of this large show? She'd cry with joy, I
know she would. Where can she be. She never sees
me at my best, and what do I care to be gay and fine if
she's not by?”
“Why, what palaver's this?" asked Mr. Dennis with

supreme disdain. “We an't got no sentimental mem-
bers among us, I hope.”
“ Don't be uneasy, brother,” cried Hugh, “he's only
talking of his mother.”
“Of his what?" said Mr. Dennis with a strong oath.
“His mother.”
“ And have I combined myself with this here section,
and turned out on this here memorable day, to hear
men talk about their mothers!” growled Mr. Dennis with
extreme disgust. “The notion of a man's sweetheart's
bad enough, but a man's mother!”—and here his disgust
was so extreme that he spat upon the ground, and could
say no more.
“ Barnaby's right,” cried Hugh with a grin, “i and I
say it. Lookee, bold lad. If she's not here to see, it's
because I've provided for her, and sent half a dozen
gentlemen, every one of 'em with a blue flag (but not
half as fine as yours), to take her, in state, to a grand
house all hung round with gold and silver banners, and
everything else you please, where she'll wait till you
come, and want for nothing.”
“Ay!” said Barnaby, his face beaming with delight;
“have you indeed ? That's a good hearing. That's fine!
Kind Hugh.”
“But nothing to what will come, bless you,” retorted
Hugh, with a wink at Dennis, who regarded his new :
companion in arms with great astonishment.
“No, indeed?” cried Barnaby.
“Nothing at all,” said Hugh. “Money, cocked hats
and feathers, red coats and gold lace; all the fine things
there are, ever were, or will be; will belong to us if we
are true to that noble gentleman–the best man in the
world-carry our flags for a few days, and keep 'em
safe. That's all we've got to do.”
“Is that all?” cried Barnaby with glistening eyes, as
he clutched his pole the tighter; “I warrant you I keep
this one safe, then. You have put it in good hands.
You know me, Hugh. Nobody shall wrest this flag
away.'
“Well said!” cried Hugh. “Ha, ha! Nobly said!
That's the old stout Barnaby, that I have climbed and
leaped with, many and many a day-I knew I was not
mistaken in Barnaby-Don't you see, man,” he added in
a whisper, as he slipped to the other side of Dennis,

" that the lad's a natural, and can be got to do anything,
if you take him the right way. Letting alone the fun
he is, he's worth a dozen men, in earnest, as you'd find
if you tried a fall with him. Leave him to me. You
shall soon see whether he's of use or not.”
Mr. Dennis received these explanatory remarks with
many nods and winks, and softened his behaviour
towards Barnaby from that moment. Hugh, laying his
finger on his nose, stepped back into his former place,
and they proceeded in silence.
It was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon
when the three great parties met at Westminster, and,
uniting in one huge mass, raised a tremendous shout.
This was not only done in token of their presence, but
as a signal to those on whom the task devolved that it
was time to take possession of the lobbies of both
Houses, and of the various avenues of approach, and of
the gallery stairs. To the last-named place, Hugh and
Dennis, still with their pupil between them, rushed
straightway, Barnaby having given his flag into the
hands of one of their own party, who kept them at the
outer door. Their followers pressing on behind, they were
borne as on a great wave to the very doors of the gal-
lery, whence it was impossible to retreat, even if they
had been so inclined, by reason of the throng which
choked up the passages. It is a familiar expression, in
describing a great crowd, that a person might have
walked upon the people's heads. In this case it was
actually done; for a boy who had by some means got
among the concourse, and was in imminent danger of
suffocation, climbed to the shoulders of a man beside
him, and walked upon the people's hats and heads into
the open street; traversing in his passage the whole
length of two staircases and a long gallery. Nor was
the swarm without less dense; for a basket which had
been tossed into the crowd was jerked from head to head,
and shoulder to shoulder, and went spinning and whirl-
ing on above them, until it was lost to view, without
ever once falling in among them or coming near the
ground.
Through this vast throng, sprinkled doubtless here
and there with honest zealots, but composed for the most
part of the very scum and refuse of London, whose
growth was fostered by bad criminal laws, bad prison

regulations, and the worst conceivable police, such of
the members of both Houses of Parliament as had not
taken the precaution to be already at their posts were
compelled to fight and force their way. Their carriages
were stopped and broken; the wheels wrenched off; the
glasses shivered to atoms; the panels beaten in; drivers,
footmen, and masters, pulled from their seats and rolled
in the mud. Lords, commoners, and reverend bishops,
with little distinction of person or party, were kicked
and pinched and hustled; passed from hand to hand
through various stages of ill-usage; and sent to their
fellow-senators at last with their clothes hanging in
ribands about them, their bagwigs torn off, themselves
speechless and breathless, and their persons covered
with the powder which had been cuffed and beaten out
of their hair. One lord was so long in the hands of the
populace that the Peers as a body resolved to sally
forth and rescue him, and were in the act of doing so,
when he happily appeared among them covered with
dirt and bruises, and hardly to be recognised by those
who knew him best. The noise and uproar were on the
increase every moment. The air was filled with execra-
tions, hoots, and howlings. The mob raged and roared
like a mad monster as it was, unceasingly, and each
new outrage served to swell its fury.
Within doors, matters were even yet more threatening.
Lord George-preceded by a man who carried the im-
mense petition on a porter's knot through the lobby to
the door of the House of Commons, where it was re-
ceived by two officers of the house, who rolled it up to
the table ready for presentation—had taken his seat at
an early hour, before the Speaker went to prayers. His
followers pouring in at the same time, the lobby and all
the avenues were immediately filled, as we have seen.
Thus the members were not only attacked in their pas-
sage through the streets, but were set upon within the
very walls of Parliament; while the tumult, both within
and without, was so great, that those who attempted to
speak could scarcely hear their own voices, far less con-
sult upon the course it would be wise to take in such
extremity, or animate each other to dignified and firm
resistance. So sure as any member, just arrived, with
dress disordered and dishevelled hair, came struggling
through the crowd in the lobby, it yelled and screamed

in triumph, and when the door of the House partially and
cautiously opened by those within for his admission, gave
them a momentary glimpse of the interior, they grew
more wild and savage, like beasts at the sight of prey,
and made a rush against the portal, which strained its
locks and bolts in their staples, and shook the very
beams.
The strangers' gallery, which was immediately above
the door of the House, had been ordered to be closed on
the first rumour of disturbance, and was empty; save
that now and then Lord George took his seat there, for
the convenience of coming to the head of the stairs
which led to it, and repeating to the people what had
passed within. It was on these stairs that Barnaby,
Hugh, and Dennis were posted. There were two flights,
short, steep, and narrow, running parallel to each other,
and leading to two little doors communicating with a
low passage which opened on the gallery. Between
them was a kind of well, or unglazed skylight, for the
admission of light and air into the lobby, which might
be some eighteen or twenty feet below.
Upon one of these little staircases-not that at the
head of which Lord George appeared from time to time,
but the other-Gashford stood with his elbow on the
bannister, and his cheek resting on his hand, with his
usual crafty aspect. Whenever he varied this attitude
in the slightest degree-so much as by the gentlest mo-
tion of his arm—the uproar was certain to increase, not
merely there, but in the lobby below; from which place,
no doubt, some man who acted as fugleman to the rest
was constantly looking up and watching him.
“ Order!” cried Hugh, in a voice which made itself
heard even above the roar and tumult, as Lord George
appeared at the top of the staircase. “News! News
from my lord!”
The noise continued, notwithstanding his appearance,
until Gashford looked round. There was silence imme-
diately—even among the people in the passages without,
and on the other staircase, who could neither see nor
hear, but to whom, notwithstanding, the signal was
conveyed with marvellous rapidity.
“Gentlemen,” said Lord George, who was very pale
and agitated, “We must be firm. They talk of delays,
but we must have no delays. They talk of taking your

petition into consideration next Tuesday, but we must
have it considered now. Present appearances look bad
for our success, but we must succeed and will!”
“We must succeed and will!" echoed the crowd. And
so, among their shouts and cheers and other cries, he
bowed to them and retired, and presently came back
again. There was another gesture from Gashford, and
a dead silence directly.
“I am afraid,” he said, this time, “that we have little
reason, gentlemen, to hope for any redress from the pro-
ceedings of Parliament. But we must redress our own
grievances, we must meet again, we must put our trust
in Providence, and it will bless our endeavours.”
This speech being a little more temperate than the
last, was not so favourably received. When the noise
and exasperation were at their height, he came back
once more, and told them that the alarm had gone
forth for many miles round; that when the King heard
of their assembling together in that great body, he had
no doubt his Majesty would send down private orders
to have their wishes complied with; and—with the
manner of his speech as childish, irresolute, and uncer-
tain-was proceeding in this strain, when two gentle-
men suddenly appeared at the door where he stood, and
pressing past him and coming a step or two lower down
upon the stairs, confronted the people.
The boldness of this action quite took them by sur-
prise. They were not the less disconcerted, when one
of the gentlemen, turning to Lord George, spoke thus-
in a loud voice that they might hear him well, but quite
coolly and collectedly:
“You may tell these people, if you please, my lord,
that I am General Conway of whom they have heard;
and that I oppose this petition and all their proceedings,
and yours. I am a soldier, you may tell them, and I
will protect the freedom of this place with my sword.
You see, my lord, that the members of this House are
all in arms to-day; you know that the entrance to it is a
narrow one; you cannot be ignorant that there are men
within these walls who are determined to defend that
pass to the last, and before whom many lives must fall
if your adherents persevere. Have a care what you do.”
And my Lord George,” said the other gentleman, .
addressing him in like manner, “I desire them to hear

this, from me-Colonel Gordon-your near relation. If
a man among this crowd, whose uproar strikes us deaf,
crosses the threshold of the House of Commons, I swear
to run my sword that moment-not into his, but into
your body!”
With that they stepped back again, keeping their
faces towards the crowd; took each an arm of the mis- .
guided nobleman; drew him into the passage and shut
the door; which they directly locked and fastened on
the inside.
This was so quickly done, and the demeanour of both
gentlemen—who were not young men either—was so
gallant and resolute, that the crowd faltered and stared
at each other with irresolute and timid looks. Many
tried to turn towards the door; some of the faintest-
hearted cried that they had best go back, and called to
those behind to give way; and the panic and confusion
were increasing rapidly, when Gashford whispered
Hugh.
6 What now!” Hugh roared aloud, turning towards
them. “Why go back? Where can you do better than
here, boys? One good rush against these doors, and one
below at the same time, will do the business. Rush on,
then! As to the door below, let those stand back who
are afraid. Let those who are not afraid try who shall
be the first to pass it. Here goes! Look out down
there!”
Without the delay of an instant, he threw himself
headlong over the bannisters into the lobby below. He
had hardly touched the ground when Barnaby was at
his side. The chaplain's assistant and some members
who were imploring the people to retire immediately
withdrew; and then, with a great shout, both crowds
threw themselves against the doors pell-mell, and be-
sieged the House in earnest.
At that moment, when a second onset must have
brought them into collision with those who stood on the
defensive within-in which case great loss of life and
bloodshed would inevitably have ensued—the hindmost
portion of the crowd gave way, and the rumour spread
from mouth to mouth that a messenger had been de-
spatched by water for the military, who were forming in
the street. Fearful of sustaining a charge in the narrow
passages in which they were so closely wedged to-

gether, the throng poured out as impetuously as they
had flocked in. As the whole stream turned at once,
Barnaby and Hugh went with it; and so, fighting and
struggling and trampling on fallen men, and being
trampled on in turn themselves, they and the whole
mass floated by degrees into the open street, where a
large detachment of the Guards, both horse and foot,
came hurrying up, clearing the ground before them so
rapidly that the people seemed to melt away as they
advanced.
The word of command to halt being given, the soldiers
formed across the street; the rioters, breathless and ex-
hausted with their late exertions, formed likewise,
though in a very irregular and disorderly manner. The
commanding officer rode hastily into the open space
between the two bodies, accompanied by a magistrate
and an officer of the House of Commons, for whose ac-
commodation a couple of troopers had hastily dis-
mounted. The Riot Act was read, but not a man stirred.
In the first rank of the insurgents Barnaby and Hugh
stood side by side. Somebody had thrust into Barnaby's
hands, when he came out into the street, his precious
flag; which being now rolled up and tied round the pole,
looked like a giant quarter-staff as he grasped it firmly
and stood upon his guard. If ever man believed with his
whole heart and soul that he was engaged in a just
cause, and that he was bound to stand by his leader to
the last, poor Barnaby believed it of himself and Lord
George Gordon.
After an ineffectual attempt to make himself heard,
the magistrate gave the word and the Horse Guards
came riding in among the crowd. But, even then, he
galloped here and there, exhorting the people to disperse;
and although heavy stones were thrown at the men,
and some were desperately cut and bruised, they had
no orders but to make prisoners of such of the rioters as
were the most active, and to drive the people back with
the flat of their sabres. As the horses came in among
them, the throng gave way at many points, and the
Guards, following up their advantage, were rapidly
clearing the ground, when two or three of the foremost,
who were in a manner cut off from the rest by the
people closing round them, made straight towards
Barnaby and Hugh, who had no doubt been pointed out

as the two men who dropped into the lobby: laying
about them now with some effect, and inflicting on the
more turbulent of their opponents a few slight flesh
wounds, under the influence of which a man dropped,
here and there, into the arms of his fellows, amid much
groaning and confusion.
At the sight of the gashed and bloody faces, seen for
a moment in the crowd, and hidden by the press around
them, Barnaby turned pale and sick. But he stood his
ground, and grasping his pole more firmly yet, kept his
eye fixed on the nearest soldier-nodding his head mean-
while, as Hugh, with a scowling visage, whispered in
his ear.
The soldier came spurring on, making his horse rear
as the people pressed about him, cutting at the hands of
those who would have grasped his rein and forced his
charger back, and waving to his comrades to follow-
and still Barnaby, without retreating an inch, waited
for his coming. Some called to him to fly, and some
were in the very act of closing round him to prevent his
being taken, when the pole swept the air above the
people's heads, and the man's saddle was empty in an
instant.
Then he and Hugh turned and fled; the crowd opening
to let them pass, and closing up again so quickly that
there was no clue to the course they had taken. Panting
for breath, hot, dusty, and exhausted with fatigue, they
reached the river side in safety, and getting into a boat
with all despatch were soon out of any immediate
danger.
As they glided down the river, they plainly heard the
people cheering; and supposing they might have forced
the soldiers to retreat, lay upon their oars for a few
minutes, uncertain whether to return or not. But the
crowd passing along Westminster Bridge soon assured
them that the populace were dispersing; and Hugh
rightly guessed from this that they had cheered the
magistrate for offering to dismiss the military on con-
dition of their immediate departure to their several
homes, and that he and Barnaby were better where they
were. He advised, therefore, that they should proceed
to Blackfriars, and, going ashore at the bridge, make
the best of their way to The Boot; where there was not
only good entertainment and safe lodging, but where

395
they would certainly be joined by many of their late
companions. Barnaby assenting, they decided on this
course of action, and pulled for Blackfriars accordingly.
They landed at a critical time, and fortunately for
themselves at the right moment. For, coming into
Fleet Street, they found it in an unusual stir; and in-
quiring the cause, were told that a body of Horse Guards
had just galloped past, and that they were escorting
some rioters whom they had made prisoners to Newgate
for safety. Not at all ill-pleased to have so narrowly
escaped the cavalcade, they lost no more time in asking
questions, but hurried to The Boot with as much speed
as Hugh considered it prudent to make, without appear-
ing singular or attracting an inconvenient share of
public notice.
CHAPTER L.
THEY were among the first to reach the tavern, but
they had not been there many minutes when several
groups of men who had formed part of the crowd came
straggling in. Among them were Simon Tappertit and
Mr. Dennis; both of whom, but especially the latter,
greeted Barnaby with the utmost warmth, and paid him
many compliments on the prowess he had shown.
" Which,” said Dennis, with an oath, as he rested his
bludgeon in a corner with his hat upon it, and took his
seat at the same table with them, “it does me good to
think of. There was a opportunity! But it led to noth-
ing. For my part, I don't know what would. There's
no spirit among the people in these here times. Bring
something to eat and drink here. I'm disgusted with
humanity.”
« On what account?" asked Mr. Tappertit, who had
been quenching his fiery face in a half-gallon can.
“Don't you consider this a good beginning, mister?"
“Give me security that it an't a ending," rejoined the
hangman. " When that soldier went down, we might
have made London ours; but no—we stand, and gape,
and look on-the justice (I wish he had had a bullet in
each eye, as he would have had, if we'd gone to work
my way) says, “My lads, if you'll give me your word to
disperse, I'll order off the military'-our people sets up a

hurrah, throws up the game with the winning cards in
their hands, and skulks away like a pack of tame curs
as they are. Ah," said the hangman, in a tone of deep
disgust, “it makes me blush for my feller creeturs. I
wish I had been born a ox, I do!”
“You'd have been quite as agreeable a character if
you had been, I think,” returned Simon Tappertit, going
out in a lofty manner.
“Don't be too sure of that," rejoined the hangman,
calling after him; “if I was a horned animal at the
present moment, with the smallest grain of sense, I'd
toss every man in this company, excepting them two,"
meaning Hugh and Barnaby, “ for his manner of con-
ducting himself this day.”
With which mournful review of their proceedings,
Mr. Dennis sought consolation in cold boiled beef and
beer; but without at all relaxing the grim and dissatis-
fied expression of his face, the gloom of which was
rather deepened than dissipated by their grateful influ-
ence.
The company who were thus libelled might have re-
taliated by strong words, if not by blows, but they were
dispirited and worn out. The greater part of them had
fasted since morning; all had suffered extremely from
the excessive heat; and between the day's shouting, ex-
ertion, and excitement, many had quite lost their voices,
and so much of their strength that they could hardly
stand. Then they were uncertain what to do next; fear-
ful of the consequences of what they had done already,
and sensible that after all they had carried no point, but
had indeed left matters worse than they had found them.
Of those who had come to The Boot, many dropped off
within an hour; such of them as were really honest and
sincere never, after the morning's experience, to return,
or to hold any communication with their late compan-
ions. Others remained but to refresh themselves, and
then went home desponding; others who had theretofore
been regular in their attendance avoided the place alto-
gether. The half-dozen prisoners whom the Guards had
taken were magnified by report into half a hundred at
least; and their friends, being faint and sober, so slack-
ened in their energy, and so drooped beneath these
dispiriting influences, that by eight o'clock in the even-
ing Dennis, Hugh, and Barnaby, were left alone. Even

they were fast asleep upon the benches, when Gash-
ford's entrance roused them.
“Oh! You are here then?” said the secretary. “Dear
me!”
“Why, where should we be, Muster Gashford ?" Dennis
rejoined, as he rose into a sitting posture.
“Oh, nowhere, nowhere,” he returned with excessive
mildness. “The streets are filled with blue cockades.
I rather thought you might have been among them. I
am glad you are not.”
“You have orders for us, master, then?" said Hugh.
“Oh, dear, no. Not I. No orders, my good fellow.
What orders should I have? You are not in my service.”
“Muster Gashford,” remonstrated Dennis, “we belong
to the cause, don't we?”
“The cause!” repeated the secretary, looking at him
in a sort of abstraction. “There is no cause. The cause
is lost.”
“Lost!"
“Oh, yes. You have heard, I suppose? The petition
is rejected by a hundred and ninety-two to six. It's
quite final. We might have spared ourselves some
trouble. That, and my lord's vexation, are the only
circumstances I regret; I am quite satisfied in all other
respects.”
As he said this he took a penknife from his pocket,
and putting his hat upon his knee, began to busy him-
self in ripping off the blue cockade which he had worn
all day; at the same time humming a psalm tune which
had been very popular in the morning, and dwelling on
it with a gentle regret.
His two adherents looked at each other, and at him, as
if they were at a loss how to pursue the subject. At
length Hugh, after some elbowing and winking between
himself and Mr. Dennis, ventured to stay his hand,
and to ask him why he meddled with that “riband in his
hat.
“Because," said the secretary, looking up with some-
thing between a snarl and a smile, “because to sit still
and wear it, or fall asleep and wear it, or run away and
wear it, is a mockery. That's all, friend.”
“What would you have us do, master?” cried Hugh.
“Nothing,” returned Gashford, shrugging his shoul-
ders, “nothing. When my lord was reproached and

threatened for standing by you, I, as a prudent man,
would have had you do nothing. When the soldiers
were trampling you under their horses' feet, I would
have you do nothing. When one of them was struck
down by a daring hand, and I saw confusion and dis-
may in all their faces, I would have had you do nothing
- just what you did, in short. This is the young man
who had so little prudence and so much boldness. Ah!
I am sorry for him.”
“Sorry, master!” cried Hugh.
“Sorry, Muster Gashford!" echoed Dennis.
“In case there should be a proclamation out to-morrow
offering five hundred pounds, or some such trifle, for his
apprehension, and in case it should include another man
who dropped into the lobby from the stairs above,” said
Gashford, coldly; “still, do nothing.”
“Fire and fury, master!” cried Hugh, starting up.
“What have we done, that you should talk to us like
this!”
“Nothing,” returned Gashford with a sneer. “If you
are cast into prison; if the young man,” here he looked
hard at Barnaby's attentive face—“is dragged from us
and from his friends; perhaps from the people whom he
loves and whom his death would kill; is thrown into jail,
brought out and hanged before their eyes; still, do
nothing. You'll find it your best policy, I have no
doubt."
“Come on!” cried Hugh, striding towards the door.
“Dennis-Barnaby—come on!”
“Where? To do what?" said Gashford, slipping past
him, and standing with his back against it.
“ Anywhere! Anything!” cried Hugh. “Stand aside,
master, or the window will serve our turn as well. Let
us out!”
“Ha, ha, ha! You are of such-of such an impetuous
nature,” said Gashford, changing his manner for one
of the utmost goodfellowship and the pleasantest
raillery; “ you are such an excitable creature-but you'll
drink with me before you go?”
“Oh, yes-certainly,” growled Dennis, drawing his
sleeve across his thirsty lips. “No malice, brother.
Drink with Muster Gashford!"
Hugh wiped his heated brow, and relaxed into a smile.
The artful secretary laughed outright.

“Some liquor here! Be quick, or he'll not stop, even
for that. He is a man of such desperate ardour!” said
the smooth setretary, whom Mr. Dennis corroborated
with sundry nods and muttered oaths. “Once roused,
he is a fellow of such fierce determination!”
Hugh poised his sturdy arm aloft, and clapping Bar-
naby on the back, bade him fear nothing. They shook
hands together-poor Barnaby evidently possessed with
the idea that he was among the most virtuous and dis-
interested heroes in the world—and Gashford laughed
again.
“I hear,” he said smoothly, as he stood among them
with a great measure of liquor in his hand, and filled
their glasses as quickly and as often as they chose, “I
hear-but I cannot say whether it be true or false—that
the men who are loitering in the streets to-night are half
disposed to pull down a Romish chapel or two and that
they only want leaders. I even heard mention of those
in Duke Street, Lincoln's-Inn Fields and in Warwick
Street, Golden Square; but common report, you know-
you are not going?”
—“To do nothing, master, eh?” cried Hugh. “No
jails and halter for Barnaby and me. They must be
frightened out of that. Leaders are wanted, are they?
Now, boys!"
“A most impetuous fellow!” cried the secretary. “Ha,
ha! A courageous, boisterous, most vehement fellow.
A man who
There was no need to finish the sentence, for they had
rushed out of the house and were far beyond hearing.
He stopped in the middle of a laugh, listened, drew on
his gloves, and, clasping his hands behind him, paced
the deserted room for a long time, then bent his steps
towards the busy town and walked into the streets.
They were filled with people, for the rumour of that
day's proceedings had made a great noise. Those per-
sons who did not care to leave home were at their doors
or windows, and one topic of discourse prevailed on
every side. Some reported that the riots were effectu-
ally put down; others that they had broken out again;
some said that Lord George Gordon had been sent
- under a strong guard to the Tower; others that an at-
tempt had been made upon the King's life; that the sol-
diers had been again called out, and that the noise of

musketry in a distant part of the town had been plainly
heard within an hour. As it grew darker these stories
became more direful and mysterious; and often, when
some frightened passenger ran past with tidings that
the rioters were not far off and were coming up, the
doors were shut and barred, lower windows made secure,
and as much consternation engendered as if the city
were invaded by a foreign army.
Gashford walked stealthily about, listening to all he
heard, and diffusing or confirming, whenever he had an
opportunity, such false intelligence as suited his own
purpose; and, busily occupied in this way, turned into
Holborn for the twentieth time, when a great many
women and children came flying along the street-often
panting and looking back-and the confused murmur
of numerous voices struck upon his ear. Assured by
these tokens, and by the red light which began to flash
upon the houses on either side, that some of his friends
were indeed approaching, he begged a moment's shelter
at a door which opened as he passed, and running with
some other persons to an upper window, looked out
upon the crowd.
They had torches among them, and the chief faces
were distinctly visible. That they had been engaged in
the destruction of some building was sufficiently appar-
ent, and that it was a Catholic place of worship was
evident from the spoils they bore as trophies, which
were easily recognisable for the vestments of priests,
and rich fragments of altar furniture. Covered with
soot, and dirt, and dust, and lime; their garments torn
to rags; their hair hanging wildly about them; their
hands and faces jagged and bleeding with the wounds
of rusty nails; Barnaby, Hugh, and Dennis hurried on
before them all, like hideous madmen. After them, the
dense throng came fighting on: some singing; some
shouting in triumph; some quarrelling among them-
selves; some menacing the spectators as they passed;
some with great wooden fragments, on which they
spent their rage as if they had been alive, rending them
limb from limb, and hurling the scattered morsels high
into the air; some in a drunken state, unconscious of
the hurts they had received from falling bricks, and
stones, and beams; one borne upon a shutter, in the
very midst, covered with a dingy cloth, a senseless,

ghastly heap. Thus-a vision of coarse faces, with here
and there a blot of flaring smoky light; a dream of
demon heads and savage eyes, and sticks and iron bars
uplifted in the air, and whirled about; a bewildering
horror, in which so much was seen, and yet so iittle,
which seemed so long and yet so short, in which there
were so many phantoms, not to be forgotten all through
life, and yet so many things that could not be observed
in one distracting glimpse-it flitted onward and was
gone.
As it passed away upon its work of wrath and ruin, a
piercing scream was heard. A knot of persons ran
towards the spot, Gashford, who just then emerged into
the street, among them. He was on the outskirts of the
little concourse, and could not see or hear what passed
within; but one who had a better place informed him
that a widow woman had descried her son among the
rioters.
“Is that all?" said the secretary, turning his face
homewards. “Well! I think this looks a little more
like business!"
CHAPTER LI.
PROMISING as these outrages were to Gashford's view,
and much like business as they looked, they extended
that night no farther. The soldiers were again called
out, again they took half-a-dozen prisoners, and again
the crowd dispersed after a short and bloodless scuffle.
Hot and drunken though they were, they had not yet
broken all bounds and set all law and government at
defiance. Something of their habitual deference to the
authority erected by society for its own preservation yet
remained among them, and had its majesty been vindi-
cated in time the secretary would have had to digest a
bitter disappointment.
By midnight the streets were clear and quiet; and save
that there stood, in two parts of the town, a heap of
nodding walls and pile of rubbish, where there had been
at sunset a rich and handsome building, everything
wore its usual aspect. Even the Catholic gentry and
tradesmen, of whom there were many, resident in differ-
ent parts of the city and its suburbs, had no fear for

their lives and property, and but little indignation for
the wrong they had already sustained in the plunder and
destruction of their temples of worship. An honest con-
fidence in the government under whose protection they
had lived for many years, and a well-founded reliance
on the good feeling and right thinking of the great mass
of the community, with whom, notwithstanding their
religious differences, they were every day in habits of
confidential, affectionate, and friendly intercourse, re-
assured them, even under the excesses that had been
committed; and convinced them that they who were
Protestants in anything but the name were no more to
be considered as abettors of these disgraceful occur-
rences than they themselves were chargeable with the
uses of the block, the rack, the gibbet, and the stake in
cruel Mary's reign.
The clock was on the stroke of one, when Gabriel
Varden, with his lady and Miss Miggs, sat waiting in the
little parlour. This fact; the toppling wicks of the
dull, wasted candles; the silence that prevailed; and
above all the nightcaps of both maid and matron, were
sufficient evidence that they had been prepared for bed
some time ago, and had some strong reason for sitting up
so far beyond their usual hour.
If any other corroborative testimony had been re-
quired, it would have been abundantly furnished in the
actions of Miss Miggs, who, having arrived at that rest-
less state and sensitive condition of the nervous system
which are the result of long watching, did, by a con-
stant rubbing and tweaking of her nose, a perpetual
change of position (arising from the sudden growth of
imaginary knots and knobs in her chair), a frequent
friction of her eyebrows, the incessant recurrence of a
small cough, a small groan, a gasp, a sigh, a sniff, a
spasmodic start, and by other demonstrations of that
nature, so file down and rasp, as it were, the patience
of the locksmith, that after looking at her in silence for
some time, he at last broke out into this apostrophe:
“Miggs, my good girl, go to bed-do go to bed.
You're really worse than the dripping of a hundred
water-butts outside the window, or the scratching of as
many mice behind the wainscot. I can't bear it. Do
go to bed, Miggs. To oblige me-do.”
“You haven't got nothing to untie, sir," returned

Miss Miggs but Missis hase locksmith's
Miss Miggs. “and therefore your requests does not sur-
prise me. But Missis has—and while you set up, mim”
-she added, turning to the locksmith's wife, “I couldn't,
no not if twenty times the quantity of cold water was
aperiently running down my back at this moment, go
to bed with a quiet spirit.”
Having spoken these words, Miss Miggs made divers
efforts to rub her shoulders in an impossible place, and
shivered from head to foot; thereby giving the beholders
to understand that the imaginary cascade was still in
full flow, but that a sense of duty upheld her under that,
and all other sufferings, and nerved her to endurance.
Mrs. Varden being too sleepy to speak, and Miss
Miggs having, as the phrase is, said her say, the lock-
smith had nothing for it but to sigh and be quiet as he
could.
But to be quiet with such a basilisk before him was
impossible. If he looked another way, it was worse to
feel that she was rubbing her cheek, or twitching her
ear, or winking her eye, or making all kinds of extra-
ordinary shapes with her nose, than to see her do it. If
she was for a moment free from any of these complaints, it
was only because of her foot being asleep, or of her arm
having got the fidgets, or of her leg being doubled up
with a cramp, or of some other horrible disorder which
racked her whole frame. If she did enjoy a moment's
ease, then with her eyes shut and her mouth wide open,
she would be seen to sit very stiff and upright in her
chair; then to nod a little way forward, and stop with a
jerk; then to nod a little farther forward, and stop with
another jerk; then to recover herself; then to come for-
ward again-lower-lower-lower-by very slow de-
grees, until, just as it seemed impossible that she could
preserve her balance for another instant, and the lock-
smith was about to call out in an agony, to save her
from dashing down upon her forehead and fracturing
her skull, then all of a sudden and without the smallest
notice, she would come upright and rigid again with
her eyes open, and in her countenance an expression of
defiance, sleepy but yet most obstinate, which plainly
said, “I've never once closed 'em since I looked at you
last, and I'll take my oath of it!"
At length, after the clock had struck two, there was
a sound at the street door, as if somebody had fallen

against the knocker by accident. Miss Miggs immedi-
ately jumping up and clapping her hands, cried with a
drowsy mingling of the sacred and profane, “ Ally Loo-
yer, mim! there's Simmuns's knock?"
“Who's there?” said Gabriel.
“Me!” cried the well-known voice of Mr. Tappertit.
Gabriel opened the door, and gave him admission.
He did not cut a very ir sinuating figure; for a man of
his stature suffers in a crowd; and having been active
in yesterday morning's work, his dress was literally
crushed from head to foot; his hat being beaten out of
all shape, and his shoes trodden down at heel like slip-
pers. His coat fluttered in strips about him, the buckles
were torn away both from his knees and feet, half his
neckerchief was gone, and the bosom of his shirt was
rent to tatters. Yet notwithstanding all these personal
disadvantages; despite his being very weak from heat
and fatigue; and so begrimed with mud and dust that he
might have been in a case, for anything of the real
texture (either of his skin or apparel) that the eye could
discern; he stalked haughtily into the parlour, and
throwing himself into a chair, and endeavoring to thrust
his hands into the pockets of his small-clothes, which
were turned inside out and displayed upon his legs, like
tassels, surveyed the household with a gloomy dignity.
“Simon," said the locksmith gravely, “How comes it
that you return home at this time of night, and in this
condition?. Give me an assurance that you have not
been among the rioters, and I am satisfied.”
“Sir," replied Mr. Tappertit, with a contemptuous
look, “I wonder at your assurance in making such de-
mands."
“You have been drinking,” said the locksmith.
“ As a general principle, and in the most offensive
sense of the words, sir,” returned the journeyman with
great self-possession, “I consider you a liar. In that
last observation you have unintentionally-uninten-
tionally, sir-struck upon the truth."
“Martha,” said the locksmith, turning to his wife, and
shaking his head sorrowfully, while a smile at the ab-
surd figure before him still played upon his open face,
“I trust it may turn out that this poor lad is not the vic-
tim of the knaves and fools we have so often had words
about, and who have done so much harm to-day. If he

has been at Warwick Street or Duke Street to-night,”
“He has been at neither, sir,” cried Mr. Tappertit in
a loud voice, which he suddenly dropped into a whisper
as he repeated, with eyes fixed upon the locksmith, "he
has been at neither."
“I am glad of it, with all my heart,” said the locksmith
in a serious tone; “ for if he had been, and it could be
proved against him, Martha, your Great Association
would have been to him the cart that draws men to the
gallows and leaves them hanging in the air. It would,
as sure as we're alive!"
Mrs. Varden was too much scared by Simon's altered
manner and appearance, and by the accounts of the
rioters which had reached her ears that night, to offer
any retort, or to have recourse to her usual matrimonial
policy. Miss Miggs wrung her hands and wept.
“He was not at Duke Street or at Warwick Street, G.
Varden,” said Simon, sternly: “but he was at West-
minster. Perhaps, sir, he kicked a county member;
perhaps, sir, he tapped a lord-you may stare, sir, I re-
peat it-blood flowed from noses, and perhaps he tapped
a lord. Who knows? This,” he added, putting his hand
into his waistcoat-pocket, and taking out a large tooth,
at the sight of which both Miggs and Mrs. Varden
screamed, " this was a bishop's. Beware, G. Varden!”
“Now, I would rather,” said the locksmith hastily,
“have paid five hundred pounds than had this come to
pass. You idiot, do you know what peril you stand in?”
“I know it, sir,” replied his journeyman, “and it is
my glory. I was there, everybody saw me there. I
was conspicuous and prominent. I will abide the con-
sequences.”
The locksmith, really disturbed and agitated, paced to
and fro in silence-glancing at his former'prentice every
now and then-and at length stopping before him, said:
“Get to bed and sleep for a couple of hours that you
may wake penitent, and with some of your senses about
you. Be sorry for what you have done, and we will try
to save you. If I call him by five o'clock,” said Varden,
turning hurriedly to his wife, “and he washes himself
clean and changes his dress, he may get to the Tower
Stairs, and away by the Gravesend tide-boat, before any
search is made for him. From there he can easily get
on to Canterbury, where your cousin will give him work

till this storm has blown over. I am not sure that I do
right in screening him from the punishment he deserves,
but he has lived in this house, man and boy, for a dozen
years, and I should be sorry if for this one day's work
he made a miserable end. Lock the front door, Miggs,
and show no light towards the street when you go up
stairs. Quick, Simon! Get to bed!”
“And do you suppose, sir," retorted Mr. Tappertit,
with a thickness and slowness of speech which con-
trasted forcibly with the rapidity and earnestness of his
kind-hearted master—" and do you suppose, sir, that I
am base and mean enough to accept your servile propo--
sition? Miscreant!”
“ Whatever you please, Sim, but get to bed. Every
minute is of consequence. The light here, Miggs!”
“Yes, yes, oh, do! Go to bed directly,” cried the two
women together.
Mr. Tappertit stood upon his feet, and pushing his
chair away to show that he needed no assistance,
answered, swaying himself to and fro, and managing
his head as if it had no connexion whatever with his
body:
“You spoke of Miggs, sir—Miggs may be smothered!”
“Oh, Simmun!” ejaculated that young lady in a faint
voice. “Oh, mim! Oh, sir! Oh, goodness gracious,
what a turn he has give me?”
“ This family may all be smothered, sir," returned Mr.
Tappertit, after glancing at her with a smile of ineffable
disdain, “ excepting Mrs. V. I have come here, sir, for
her sake, this night. Mrs. Varden, take this piece of
paper. It's a protection, ma'am. You may need it.”
With these words he held out at arm's length a dirty,
crumpled scrap of writing. The locksmith took it from
him, opened it, and read as follows:
“All good friends to our cause, I hope will be par-
ticular, and do no injury to the property of any true
Protestant. I am well assured that the proprietor of
this house is a staunch and worthy friend to the cause.
• GEORGE GORDON.”
“What's this!" said the locksmith, with an altered
face.
“Something that'll do you good service, young feller,".

replied his journeyman, “as you'll find. Keep that
safe, and where you can lay your hand upon it in an
instant. And chalk 'No Popery' on your door to-
morrow night, and for a week to come—that's all.”
“This is a genuine document,” said the locksmith, “I
know, for I have seen the hand before. What threat
does it imply? What devil is abroad?”
“A fiery devil,” retorted Sim; “ a flaming, furious
devil. Don't you put yourself in its way, or you're
done for, my buck. Be warned in time, G. Varden.
Farewelly
But here the two women threw themselves in his way
-especially Miss Miggs, who fell upon him with such
fervour that she pinned him against the wall—and con-
jured him in moving words not to go forth till he was
sober; to listen to reason; to think of it; to take some
rest, and then determine.
“ I tell you,” said Mr. Tappertit, “that my mind is
made up. My bleeding country calls me and I go!
Miggs, if you don't get out of the way, I'll pinch you."
Miss Miggs, still clinging to the rebel, screamed once
vociferously-but whether in the distraction of her
mind, or because of his having executed his threat, is
uncertain.
“Release me,” said Simon, struggling to free himself
from her chaste but spider-like embrace. “Let me go!
I have made arrangements for you in an altered state
of society, and mean to provide for you comfortably in
lífe—there! Will that satisfy you?"
“Oh, Simmun!” cried Miss Miggs. “Oh, my blessed
Simmun! Oh, mim! what are my feelings at this con-
flicting moment!”
Of a rather turbulent description, it would seem, for
her nightcap had been knocked off in the scuffle, and
she was on her knees upon the floor, making a strange
revelation of blue and yellow curl-papers, straggling
locks of hair, tags of staylaces, and strings of it's im-
possible to say what; panting for breath, clasping her
hands, turning her eyes upwards, shedding abundance
of tears, and exhibiting various other symptoms of the
acutest mental suffering.
“I leave,” said Simon, turning to his master, with an
utter disregard of Miggs's maiderily affection, “a box
of things up stairs. Do what you like with 'em. I don't

want 'em. I'm never coming back here any more.
Provide yourself, sir, with a journeyman; I'm my
country's journeyman; henceforward that's my line of
business.”
“Be what you like in two hours' time, but now go up
to bed,” returned the locksmith, planting himself in the
doorway. “Do you hear me? Go to bed!”
“I hear you, and defy you, Varden,” rejoined Simon
Tappertit. “This night, sir, I have been in the country,
planning an expedition which shall fill your bell-hang-
ing soul with wonder and dismay. The plot demands
my utmost energy. Let me pass!”
“I'll knock you down if you coine near the door.," re-
plied the locksmith. “You had better go to bed!”
Simon made no answer, but gathering himself up as
straight as he could, plunged headforemost at his old
master, and the two went driving out into the workshop
together, plying their hands and feet so briskly that
they looked like half-a-dozen, while Miggs and Mrs.
Varden screamed for twelve.
It would have been easy for Varden to knock his old
'prentice down, and bind him hand and foot; but as he
was loth to hurt him in his then defenceless state, he
contented himself with parrying his blows when he
could, taking them in perfect good part when he could
not, and keeping between him and the door, until a fa-
vourable opportunity should present itself for forcing
him to retreat up-stairs, and shutting him up in his own
room. But, in the goodness of his heart, he calculated
too much upon his adversary's weakness, and forgot
that drunken men who have lost the power of walking
steadily can often run. Watching his time, Simon
Tappertit made a cunning show of falling back, stag-
gered unexpectedly forward, brushed past him, opened
the door (he knew the trick of that lock well), and
darted down the street like a mad dog. The locksmith
paused for a moment in the excess of his astonishment,
and then gave chase.
It was an excellent season for a run, for at that silent
hour the streets were deserted, the air was cool, and the
flying figure before him distinctly visible at a great dis-
tance, as it sped away, with a long, gaunt shadow fol-
lowing at its heels. But the short-winded locksmith
had no chance against a man of Sim's youth and spare

409
figure, though the day had been when he could have
run him down in no time. The space between them
rapidly increased, and as the rays of the rising sun
streamed upon Simon in the act of turning a distant
corner, Gabriel Varden was fain to give up, and sit
down on a door-step to fetch his breath. Simon mean-
while, without once stopping, fled at the same degree of
swiftness to The Boot, where, as he well knew, some of
his company were lying, and at which respectable hos-
telry-for he had already acquired the distinction of
being in great peril of the law-a friendly watch had
been expecting him all night, and was even now on the
look-out for his coming
“Go thy ways, Sim, go thy ways,” said the locksmith,
as soon as he could speak. “I have done my best for
thee, poor lad, and would have saved thee, but the rope
is round thy neck, I fear.”
So saying, and shaking his head in a sorrowful .and
disconsolate manner, he turned back, and soon re-entered
his own house, where Mrs. Varden and the faithful
Miggs had been anxiously expecting his return.
Now Mrs. Varden (and by consequence Miss Miggs
likewise) was impressed with a secret misgiving that
she had done wrong; that she had, to the utmost of her
small means, aided and abetted the growth of disturb-
ances, the end of which it was impossible to foresee;
that she had led remotely to the scene which had just
passed; and that the locksmith's time for triumph and
reproach had now arrived indeed. And so strongly did
Mrs. Varden feel this, and so crest-fallen was she in
consequence, that while her husband was pursuing their
lost journeyman, she secreted under her chair the little
red-brick dwelling-house with the yellow roof, lest it
should furnish new occasion for reference to the painful
theme; and now hid the same still more with the skirts
of her dress.
But it happened that the locksmith had been thinking
of this very article on his way home, and that, coming
into the room and not seeing it, he at once demanded
where it was.
Mrs. Varden had no resource but to produce it, which
she did with many tears, and broken protestations that
if she could have known-
“Yes, yes,” said Varden, “ of course I know that. I

don't mean to reproach you, my dear. But recollect
from this time that all good things perverted to evil
purposes are worse than those which are naturally bad.
A thoroughly wicked woman is wicked indeed. When
religion goes wrong, she is very wrong, for the same
reason. Let us say no more about it, my dear.”.
So he dropped the red-brick dwelling-house on the
floor, and setting his heel upon it, crushed it into pieces.
The halfpence, and sixpences, and other voluntary con-
tributions, rolled about in all directions, but nobody
offered to touch them, or to take them up.
“That,” said the locksmith, “is easily disposed of, and
I would to Heaven that everything growing out of the
same society could be settled as easily.”
“It happens very fortunately, Varden,” said his wife,
with her handkerchief to her eyes, “that in case any
more disturbances should happen-which I hope not, I
sincerely hope not”
“I hope so too, my dear.”
“—That in case any should occur, we have the piece
of paper which that poor misguided young man
brought.”
“Ay, to be sure,” said the locksmith, turning quickly
round. “Where is that piece of paper?"
Mrs. Varden stood aghast as he took it from her out-
stretched hand, tore it into fragments, and threw them
under the grate.
“Not use it?" she said.
“Use it!” cried the locksmith. “No! Let them come
and pull the roof about our ears; let them burn us out of
house and home; I'd neither have the protection of their
leader, nor chalk their howl upon my door, though, for
not doing it, they shot me on my own threshold. Use
it! Let them come and do their worst. The first man
who crosses my door-step on such an errand as theirs,
had better be a hundred miles away.. Let him look to
it. The others may have their will. I wouldn't beg or
buy them off, if, instead of every pound of iron in the
place, there was a hundred weight of gold. Get you to
bed, Martha. I shall take down the shutters and go to
work.”
“So early!” said his wife.
“Ay,” replied the locksmith cheerily, “so early. Come
when they may, they shall not find us skulking and

hiding, as if we feared to take our portion of the light of
day, and left it all to them. So pleasant dreams to you,
my dear, and cheerful sleep!”
With that he gave his wife a hearty kiss, and bade
her delay no longer, or it would be time to rise before she
lay down to rest. Mrs. Varden quite amiably and
meekly walked up stairs, followed by Miggs, who,
although a good deal subdued, could not refrain from
sundry stimulative coughs and sniffs by the way, or
from holding up her hands in astonishment at the daring
conduct of master.
CHAPTER LII.
A MOB is usually a creature of very mysterious exist-
ence, particularly in a large city. Where it comes from
or whither it goes, few men can tell. Assembling and
dispersing with equal suddenness, it is as difficult to
follow to its various sources as the sea itself; nor does
the parallel stop here, for the ocean is not more fickle
and uncertain, more terrible when roused, more un-
reasonable or more cruel.
The people who were boisterous at Westminster upon
the Friday morning, and were eagerly bent upon the
work of devastation in Duke Street and Warwick Street
at night, were, in the mass, the same. Allowing for the
chance accessions of which any crowd is morally sure
in a town where there must always be a large number
of idle and profligate persons, one and the same mob
was at both places. Yet they spread themselves in
various directions when they dispersed in the afternoon,
made no appointment for re-assembling, had no definite
purpose or design, and, indeed, for anything they knew,
were scattered beyond the hope of future union.
At The Boot, which, as has been shown, was in a man-
ner the headquarters of the rioters, there were not,
upon this Friday night, a dozen people. Some slept in
the stable and outhouses, some in the common room,
some two or three in beds. The rest were in their usual
homes or haunts. Perhaps not a score in all lay in the
adjacent fields and lanes, and under haystacks, or near
the warmth of brick-kilns, who had not their accus-
tomed place of rest beneath the open sky. As to the

public ways within the town, they had their ordinary
nightly occupants, and no others; the usual amount of
vice and wretchedness, but no more.
The experience of one evening, however, had taught
the reckless leaders of disturbance that they had but to
show themselves in the streets to be immediately sur-
rounded by materials which they could have only kept
together when their aid was not required, at great risk,
expense and trouble. Once possessed of this secret,
they were as confident as if twenty thousand men, de-
voted to their will, had been encamped about them, and
assumed a confidence which could not have been sur-
passed, though that had really been the case. All day
Saturday they remained quiet. On Sunday they rather
studied how to keep their men within call, and in full
hope, than to follow out, by any very fierce measure, their
first day's proceedings.
"I hope,” said Dennis, as, with a loud yawn, he raised
his body from a heap of straw on which he been sleep-
ing, and supporting his head upon his hand, appealed to
Hugh on Sunday morning, - that Muster Gashford
allows some rest? Perhaps he'd have us at work again
already, eh?”
“It's not his way to let matters drop, you may be sure
of that,” growled Hugh in answer. I'm in no humour
to stir yet, though. I'm as stiff as a dead body and as
full of ugly scratches as if I had been fighting all day
yesterday with wild cats.”
“You've so much enthasiasm, that's it,” said Dennis,
looking with great admiration at the uncombed head,
matted beard and torn hands and face of the wild figure
before him; “you're such a devil of a fellow. You hurt
yourself a hundred times more than you need, because
you will be foremost in everything and will do more than
the rest."
“For the matter of that,” returned Hugh, shaking
back his ragged hair and glancing towards the door of
the stable in which they lay; "there's one yonder as
good as me. What did I tell you about him? Did I say
he was worth a dozen, when you doubted him.”
Mr. Dennis rolled lazily over upon his breast, resting
his chin upon his hand in imitation of the attitude in
which Hugh lay, said, as he, too, looked towards the door:
“Ay, ay, you knew him, brother, you knew him,

But who'd suppose to look at that chap, now, that he
could be the man he is! Isn't it a thousand cruel pities,
brother, that instead of taking his natural rest and
qualifying himself for further exertions in this here hon-
ourable cause, he should be playing at soldiers like a
boy? And his cleanliness, too!” said Mr. Dennis, who
certainly had no reason to entertain a fellow feeling
with anybody who was particular on that score; “what
weaknesses he's guilty of with respect to his cleanliness!
At five o'clock this morning there he was at the pump,
though any one would think he had gone through
enough the day before yesterday to be pretty fast asleep
at that time. But no-when I woke for a minute or two
there he was at the pump, and if you'd have seen him
sticking them peacock's feathers into his hat when he'd
done washing-ah! I'm sorry he's such a imperfect char-
acter, but the best on us is incomplete in some pint of view
or another.”
The subject of this dialogue and of these concluding
remarks, which were uttered in a tone of philosophical
meditation, was, as the reader will have divined, no other
than Barnaby, who, with his flag in his hand, stood sen-
try in the little patch of sunlight at the distant door, or
walked to and fro outside, singing softly to himself, and
keeping time to the music of some clear church bells.
Whether he stood still, leaning with both hands on the
flagstaff, or, bearing it upon his shoulder, paced slowly
up and down, the careful arrangement of his poor dress,
and his erect and lofty bearing, showed how high a
sense he had of the great importance of his trust, and
how happy and how proud it made him. To Hugh and
his companion, who lay in a dark corner of the gloomy
shed, he and the sunlight, and the peaceful Sabbath
sound to which he made response, seemed like a bright
picture framed by the door, and set off by the stable's
blackness. The whole formed such a contrast to them-
selves, as they lay wallowing like some obscene animals
in their squalour and wickedness on the two heaps of
straw, that for a few moments they looked on without
speaking, and felt almost ashamed.
“Ah!" said Hugh at length, carrying it off with a laugh.
“He's a rare fellow is Barnaby, and can do more with
less rest or meat, or drink, than any of us. As to his
soldiering, I put him on duty there."

“ Then there was a object in it, and a proper good
one too, I'll be sworn,” retorted Dennis with a broad
grin, and an oath of the same quality. “What was it,
brother?”
“Why, you see,” said Hugh, crawling a little nearer
to him, “that our noble captain yonder came in yester-
day morning rather the worse for liquor, and was-like
you and me-ditto last night.”
Dennis looked to where Simon Tappertit lay coiled
upon a truss of hay, snoring profoundly, and nodded.
“And our noble captain,” continued Hugh with
another laugh, “our noble captain and I have planned
for to-morrow a roaring expedition, with good profit
in it.”
“ Again the Papists ?” asked Dennis, rubbing his
hands.
“Ay, against the Papists-against one of 'em at least,
that some of us, and I for one, owe a good heavy grudge
to.”
“Not Muster Gashford's friend that he spoke to us
about in my house, eh?” said Dennis, brimfull of pleasant
expectation.
*The same man,” said Hugh.
“That's your sort,” cried Mr. Dennis, gaily shaking
hands with him, “that's the kind of game. Let's have
revenges and injuries, and all that, and we shall get on
twice as fast. Now you talk, indeed!”
“Ha, ha, ha! The captain,” added Hugh, “has
thoughts of carrying off a woman in the bustle, and-
ha, ha, ha!-and so have I!”
Mr. Dennis received this part of the scheme with a
wry face, observing that as a general principle he ob-
jected to women altogether, as being unsafe and slip-
pery persons, on whom there was no calculating with
any certainty, and who were never in the same mind
for four-and-twenty hours at a stretch. He might have
expatiated on this suggestive theme at much greater
length, but that it occurred to him to ask what connex-
ion existed between the proposed expedition and Bar-
naby's being posted at the stable door as sentry; to
which Hugh cautiously replied in these words:
“Why, the people we mean to visit were friends of
his, once upon a time, and I know that much of him to
feel pretty sure that if he thought we were going to do
for four-and-tw this suggesti te him to asdit

them any harm, he'd be no friend to our side, but would
lend a ready hand to the other. So I've persuaded him
(for I know him of old) that Lord George has picked him
out to guard this place to-morrow while we're away, and
that it's a great honour-and so he's on duty now, and as
proud of it as if he was a general. Ha, ha! What do
you say to me for a careful man as well as a devil of a
one?”
Mr. Dennis exhausted himself in compliments, and
then added:
“But about the expedition itself—”
“About that,” said Hugh, “you shall hear all partic-
ulars from me and the great captain conjointly and
both together-for, see, he's waking up. Rouse your-
self, lion-heart. Ha, ha! Put a good face upon it, and
drink again. Another hair of the dog that bit you, cap-
tain! Call for drink! There's enough of gold and silver
cups and candlesticks buried underneath my bed,” he
added, rolling back the straw, and pointing to where
the ground was newly turned, “to pay for it, if it was
a score of casks full. Drink, captain!”
Mr. Tappertit received these jovial promptings with a
very bad grace, being much the worse, both in mind
and body, for his last two nights of debauch, and but in-
differently able to stand upon his legs. With Hugh's
assistance, however, he contrived to stagger to the
pump; and having refreshed himself with an abundant
draught of cold water, and a copious shower of the same
refreshing liquid on his head and face, he ordered some
rum and milk to be served; and upon that innocent
beverage and some biscuits and cheese made a pretty
hearty meal. That done, he disposed himself in an easy
attitude on the ground beside his two companions (who
were carousing after their own tastes), and proceeded
to enlighten Mr. Dennis in reference to to-morrow's
project.
That their conversation was an interesting one, was
rendered manifest by its length, and by the close at-
tention of all three. That it was not of an oppressively
grave character, but was enlivened by various pleas-
antries arising out of the subject, was clear from their
loud and frequent roars of laughter, which startled
Barnaby on his post, and made him wonder at their
levity. But he was not summoned to join them until

they had eaten,and drunk, and slept, and talked together
for some hours; not, indeed, until the twilight; when
they informed him that they were about to make a
slight demonstration in the streets-just to keep the
people's hands in, as it was Sunday night, and the public
might otherwise be disappointed—and that he was free
to accompany them if he would
Without the slightest preparation, saving that they
carried clubs and wore the blue cockade, they sallied
out into the streets; and, with no more settled design
than that of doing as much mischief as they could,
paraded them at random. Their numbers rapidly in-
creasing, they soon divided into parties; and agreeing
to meet by-and-by, in the fields near Welbeck Street,
scoured the town in various directions. The largest
body, and that which augmented with the greatest rapid-
ity, was the one to which Hugh and Barnaby belonged.
This took its way towards Moorfields, where there was
a rich chapel, and in which neighbourhood several
Catholic families were known to reside.
Beginning with the private houses so occupied, they
broke open the doors and windows; and while they de-
stroyed the furniture and left but the bare walls, made
a sharp search for tools and engines of destruction, such
as hammers, pokers, axes, saws, and such like instru-
ments. Many of the rioters made belts of cord, of
handkerchiefs, or any material they found at hand, and
wore these weapons as openly as pioneers upon a field-
day. There was not the least disguise or concealment
-indeed, on this night, very little excitement or hurry.
From the chapels, they tore down and took away the
very altars, benches, pulpits, pews and flooring; from
the dwelling-houses, the very wainscoting and stairs.
This Sunday evening's recreation they pursued like mere
workmen who had a certain task to do, and did it. Fifty
resolute men might have turned them at any moment;
a single company of soldiers could have scattered them
like dust; but no man interposed, no authority restrained
them, and, except by the terrified persons who fled from
their approach, they were as little heeded as if they
were pursuing their lawful occupations with the utmost
sobriety and good conduct.
In the same manner, they marched to the place of
rendezvous agreed upon, made great fires in the fields,

417
and reserving the most valuable of their spoils, burnt
the rest. Priestly garments, images of saints, rich
stuffs and ornaments, altar-furniture and household
goods, were cast into the flames, and shed a glare on the
whole country round; but they danced, and howled, and
roared about these fires till they were tired, and were
never for an instant checked.
As the main body filed off from this scene of action
and passed down Welbeck Street they came upon Gash-
ford, who had been a witness of their proceedings, and
was walking stealthily along the pavement. Keeping
up with him, and yet not seeming to speak, Hugh mut-
tered in his ear:
“Is this better, master?”
“No,” said Gashford. “It is not.”
“What would you have?” said Hugh. “Fevers are
never at their height at once. They must get on by
degrees.”
* I would have you,” said Gashford, pinching his arm
with such malevolence that his nails seemed to meet in
the skin; “I would have you put some meaning into
your work. Fools! Can you make no better bonfires
than of rags and scraps? Can you burn nothing
whole?”
"A little patience, master,” said Hugh. “Wait but a
few hours, and you shall see. Look for a redness in the
sky to-morrow night.”
With that, he fell back into his place beside Barnaby;
and when the secretary looked after him, both were lost
in the crowd.

CHAPTER LIII.
THE next day was ushered in by merry peals of bells,
and by the firing of the Tower guns; flags were hoisted
on many of the church steeples; the usual demonstra-
tions were made, in honour of the anniversary of the
King's birthday; and every man went about his pleasure
or business as if the city were in perfect order, and there
were no half-smouldering embers in its secret places
which on the approach of night would kindle up again,
and scatter ruin and dismay abroad. The leaders of the
riot, rendered still more daring by the success of last
night and by the booty they had acquired, kept steadily
together, and only thought of implicating the mass of
their followers so deeply that no hope of pardon or re-
ward might tempt them to betray their more notorious
confederates into the hands of justice.
Indeed, the sense of having gone too far to be for-
given, held the timid together no less than the bold.
Many, who would readily have pointed out the foremost
rioters and given évidence against them, felt that escape
by that means was hopeless, when their every act had
been observed by scores of people who had taken no
part in the disturbances; who had suffered in their per-
sons, peace or property, by the outrages of the mob;
who would be most willing witnesses, and whom the
government would, no doubt, prefer to any King's evi-
dence that might be offered. Many of this class had de-
serted their usual occupations on the Saturday morning;.
some had been seen by their employers, active in the
tumult; others knew they must be suspected, and that
they would be discharged if they returned; others had
been desperate from the beginning, and comforted them-
selves with the homely proverb, that, being hanged at
all, they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.
They all hoped and believed, in a greater or less degree,
that the government they seemed to have paralysed
would, in its terror, come to terms with them in the end,
and suffer them to make their own conditions. The least
sanguine among them reasoned with himself that, at the
worst, they were too many to be all punished, and that

419
he had as good a chance of escape as any other man.
The great mass never reasoned or thought at all, but
were stimulated by their own headlong passions, by
poverty, by ignorance, by the love of mischief, and the
hope of plunder.
One other circumstance is worthy of remark, and
that is, that from the moment of their first outbreak
at Westminster, every symptom of order or precon-
certed arrangement among them vanished. When they
divided into parties and ran to different quarters of the
town, it was on the spontaneous suggestion of the mo-
ment. Each party swelled as it went along, like rivers
as they roll towards the sea; new leaders sprang up as
they were wanted, disappeared when the necessity was
over, and reappeared at the next crisis. Each tumult
took shape and form from the circumstances of the mo-
ment; sober workmen going home from their day's
labour, were seen to cast down their baskets of tools
and become rioters in an instant; mere boys on errands
did the like. In a word, a moral plague ran through the
city. The noise, and hurry, and excitement, had for
hundreds and hundreds an attraction they had no firm-
ness to resist. The contagion spread, like a dread fever:
an infectious madness, as yet not near its height, seized
on new victims every hour, and society began to tremble
at their ravings.
It was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon
when Gashford looked into the lair described in the last
chapter, and seeing only Barnaby and Dennis there, in-
quired for Hugh.
He was out, Barnaby told him; had gone out more
than a hour ago, and had not yet returned.
“Dennis!” said the smiling secretary, in his smoothest
voice, as he sat down cross-legged on a barrel, “ Dennis!”
The hangman struggled into a sitting posture directly,
and with his eyes wide open, looked towards him.
“How do you do, Dennis?” said Gashford, nodding.
“I hope you have suffered no inconvenience from your
late exertions, Dennis?”
“I always will say of you, Muster Gashford,” returned
the hangman, staring at him, “that that 'ere quiet way
of yours might almost wake a dead man. It is,” he
added with a muttered oath--still staring at him in a
thoughtful manner-“so awful sly!"

BARNABY RUDGE.
“So distinct, eh, Dennis?”
“Distinct!” he answered, scratching his head, and
keeping his eyes upon the secretary's face; “I seem to
hear it, Muster Gashford, in my werry bones.”
“I am very glad your sense of hearing is so sharp,
and that I succeed in making myself so intelligible,”
said Gashford, in his unvarying, even tone. “Where is
your friend?”
Mr. Dennis looked round as in expectation of behold-
ing him asleep upon his bed of straw; then remember-
ing that he had seen him go out, replied:
“I can't say where he is, Muster Gashford, I expected
him back afore now. I hope it isn't time that we was
busy, Muster Gashford?” :
“Nay,” said the secretary, “who should know that as
well as you? How can I tell you, Dennis? You are
perfect master of your own actions, you know, and ac-
countable to nobody-except sometimes to the law, eh?”
Dennis, who was very much baffled by the cool matter-
of-course manner of this reply, recovered his self-
possession on his professional pursuits being referred
to, and pointing towards Barnaby, shook his head and
frowned.
“Hush!” cried Barnaby.
“Ah! Do hush about that, Muster Gashford,” said
the hangman in a low voice, “pop'lar prejudices—you
always forget-well, Barnaby, my lad, what's the
matter?”
"I hear him coming,” he answered. “Hark. Do
you mark that? That's his foot! Bless you, I know
his step, and his dog's too. Tramp, tramp, pit-pat, on
they come together, and, ha, ha, ha!-and here they ·
are!” he cried, joyfully, welcoming Hugh with both
hands, and then patting him fondly on the back, as if
instead of being the rough companion he was, he had
been one of the most prepossessing of men. “Here he
is, and safe too! I am glad to see him back again, old
Hugh!”
"I'm a Turk if he don't give me a warmer welcome
always than any man of sense,” said Hugh, shaking
hands with him with a kind of ferocious friendship,
strange enough to see. “How are you, boy?”
“ Hearty!” cried Barnaby, waving his hat. “Ha, ha,
ha! And merry too, Hugh! And ready to do anything

for the good cause, and the right, and to help the kind,
mild, pale-faced gentleman-the lord they used so ill-
eh, Hugh?”
"Ay!" returned his friend, dropping his hand, and
looking at Gashford for an instant with a changed
expression before he spoke to him. “Good day, master.”
* And good-day to you,” replied the secretary, nurs-
ing his leg. “And many good-days-whole years of
them, I hope. You are heated.”
“So would you have been, master," said Hugh, wip-
ing his face, " if you'd been running here as fast as I
have.”
“You know the news then? Yes, I supposed you
would have heard it.”
6 News! what news!”
“You don't?” cried Gashford, raising his eyebrows
with an exclamation of surprise. “Dear me! Come,
then I am the first to make you acquainted with your
distinguished position after all. Do you see the King's
Arms a-top?" he smilingly asked, as he took a large
paper from his pocket, unfolded it, and held it out for
Hugh's inspection.
6 Well!" said Hugh. “What's that to me?"
“Much. A great deal,” replied the secretary. “Read
“I told you, the first time I saw you, that I couldn't
read,” said Hugh, impatiently. “What in the devil's
name's inside of it?
“It is a proclamation from the King in Council,” said
Gashford, “dated to-day, and offering a reward of five
hundred pounds-five hundred pounds is a great deal of
money, and a large temptation to some people—to any
one who will discover the person or persons most active
in demolishing those chapels on Saturday night."
“Is that all?" cried Hugh, with an indifferent air. “I
knew of that.”
“ Truly I might have known you did,” said Gashford,
smiling and folding up the document again. “ Your
friend, I might have guessed-indeed I did guess-was
sure to tell you.”
“My friend!” stammered Hugh, with an unsuccessful
effort to appear surprised. “What friend?”
“Tut tut-do you suppose I don't know where you
have been?" retorted Gashford, rubbing his hands, and
it.”

beating the back of one on the palm of the other, and
looking at him with a cunning eye. “How dull you
think me! Shall I say his name?”.
“No,” said Hugh, with a hasty glance towards Dennis.
66 You have also heard from him, no doubt,” resumed
the secretary, after a moment's pause, “that the rioters
who have been taken (poor fellows) are committed for
trial, and that some very active witnesses have had the
temerity to appear against them. Among others—" and
here he clenched his teeth, as if he would suppress, by
force, some violent words that rose upon his tongue; and
spoke very slowly. “ Among others, a gentleman who
saw the work going on in Warwick Street; a Catholic
gentleman; one Haredale.”
Hugh would have prevented his uttering the word,
but it was out already. Hearing the name, Barnaby
turned swiftly round.
“Duty, duty, bold Barnaby!” cried Hugh, assuming
his wildest and most rapid manner, and thrusting into
his hand his staff and flag which leant against the wall.
“Mount guard without loss of time, for we are off upon
our expedition. Up, Dennis, and get ready! Take care
that no one turns the straw upon my bed, brave Bar-
naby; we know what's underneath it -eh? Now, master,
quick! What you have to say, say speedily, for the
little captain and a cluster of 'em are in the fields, and
only waiting for us. Sharp's the word, and strike's the
action. Quick!"
Barnaby was not proof against this bustle and de-
spatch. The look of mingled astonishment and anger
which had appeared in his face when he turned towards
them, faded from it as the words passed from his
memory, like breath from a polished mirror; and grasp-
ing the weapon which Hugh forced upon him, he proudly
took his station at the door, beyond their hearing.
“You might have spoiled our plans, master,” said
Hugh. “You, too, of all men!”
" Who would have supposed that he would be so
quick?" urged Gashford.
“He's as quick sometimes I don't mean with his
hands, for that you know, but with his head—as you, or
any man,” said Hugh. “Dennis, it's time we were
going; they're waiting for us; I came to tell you. Reach
me my stick and belt, Here! Lend a hand, master.

Fling this over my shoulder, and buckle it behind, will
“Brisk as ever!" said the secretary, adjusting it for
him as he desired.
“A man need be brisk to-day; there's brisk work
a-foot."
“There is, is there?” said Gashford. He said it with
such a provoking assumption of ignorance, that Hugh,
looking over his shoulder and angrily down upon him,
replied:
*Is there! You know there is! Who knows better
than you, master, that the first great step to be taken is
to make examples of these witnesses, and frighten all
men from appearing against us or any of our body, any
more?"
“There's one we know of,” returned Gashford, with
an expressive smile, “who is at least as well informed
upon that subject as you or I.”
“ If we mean the same gentleman, as I suppose we
do,” Hugh rejoined, softly, “I tell you this-he's as good
and quick information about everything as—” here he
paused and looked round, as if to make quite sure that
the person in question was not within hearing—"as
Old Nick himself. Have you done that, master? How
slow you are!”
“It's quite fast now," said Gashford, rising. “I say,
you didn't find that your friend disapproved of to-day's
little expedition? Ha, ha, ha! It is fortunate it jumps
so well with the witness' policy; for once planned, it
must have been carried out. And now you are going,
eh?”
“Now we are going, master!” Hugh replied. “Any
parting words ?"
“Oh, dear, no,” said Gashford sweetly. “None!”
“You're sure?” cried Hugh, nudging the grinning
Dennis.
“Quite sure, eh, Muster Gashford?” chuckled the hang-
man.
Gashford paused a moment, struggling with his
caution and his malice; then putting himself between
the two men, and laying a hand upon the arm of each,
said, in a cramped whisper:
“Do not, my good friends—I am sure you will not-
forget our talk one night in your house, Dennis-about

this person. No mercy, no quarter, no two beams of his
house to be left standing where the builder placed them!
Fire, the saying goes, is a good servant, but a bad master.
Make it his master; he deserves no better. But I am
sure you will be firm, I am sure you will be very resolute,
I am sure you will remember that he thirsts for your
lives, and those of all your brave companions. If you
ever acted like stanch fellows, you will do so to-day.
Won't you, Dennis-won't you, Hugh.”
The two looked at him, and at each other; then burst-
ing into a roar of laughter, brandished their staves
above their heads, shook hands, and hurried out.
When they had been gone a little time, Gashford fol-
lowed. They were yet in sight, and hastening to that
part of the adjacent fields in which their fellows had
already mustered; Hugh was looking back, and flour-
ishing his hat to Barnaby, who, delighted with his trust,
replied in the same manner, and then resumed his
pacing up and down before the stable-door, where his
feet had worn a path already. And when Gashford
himself was far distant, and looked back, for the last
time, he was still walking to and fro, with the same
measured tread; the most devoted and the blithest
champion that ever maintained a post, and felt his heart
lifted up with a brave sense of duty and determination
to defend it to the last.
Smiling at the simplicity of the poor idiot, Gashford
betook himself to Welbeck Street by a different path
from that which he knew the rioters would take, and
sitting down behind a curtain in one of the upper win-
dows of Lord George Gordon's house, waited impatiently
for their coming. They were so long, that although he
knew it had been settled they should come that way, he
had a misgiving they must have changed their plans
and taken some other route. But at length the roar of
voices was heard in the neighbouring fields, and soon
afterwards they came thronging past in a great body.
However, they were not all, nor nearly all, in one
body, but were, as he soon found, divided into four
parties, each of which stopped before the house to give
three cheers, and then went on; the leaders crying out
in what direction they were going, and calling on the
spectators to join them. The first detachment carrying,
by way of banners, some relics of the havoc they had

made in Moorfields, proclaimed that they were on their
way to Chelsea, whence they would return in the same
order, to make of the spoil they bore, a great bonfire,
near at hand. The second gave out that they were bound
for Wapping, to destroy a chapel; the third, that their
place of destination was East Smithfield, and their ob-
ject the same. All this was done in broad, bright, sum-
mer day. Gay carriages and chairs stopped to let them
pass, or turned back to avoid them; people on foot stood
aside in doorways, or perhaps knocked and begged per-
mission to stand at a window, or in a hall, until the
rioters had passed: but nobody interfered with them;
and when they had gone by, everything went on as
usual. -
There still remained the fourth body, and for that the
secretary looked with a most intense eagerness. At last
it came up. It was numerous, and composed of picked
men; for as he gazed down among them he recognized
many upturned faces which he knew well—those of
Simon Tappertit, Hugh, and Dennis in the front, of
course. They halted and cheered, as the others had
done; but when they moved again, they did not, like
them, proclaim what design they had. Hugh merely
raised his hat upon the bludgeon he carried, and glanc-
ing at a spectator on the opposite side of the way, was
gone.
Gashford followed the direction of his glance instinct-
ively, and saw, standing on the pavement, and wear-
ing the blue cockade, Sir John Chester. He held his
hat an inch or two above his head, to propitiate the
mob; and, resting gracefully on his cane, smiling pleas-
antly, and displaying his dress and person to the very
best advantage, looked on in the most tranquil state
imaginable. For all that, and quick and dexterous as
he was, Gashford had seen him recognize Hugh with
the air of a patron. He had no longer any eyes for the
crowd, but fixed his keen regards upon Sir John.
He stood in the same place and posture, until the last
man in the concourse had turned the corner of the street;
then very deliberately took the blue cockade out of his
hat; put it carefully in his pocket, ready for the next
emergency; refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff;
put up his box, and was walking slowly off, when a
passing carriage stopped, and a lady's hand let down

the glass. Sir John's hat was off again immediately.
After a minute's conversation at the carriage window,
in which it was apparent that he was vastly entertain-
ing on the subject of the mob, he stepped lightly in and
was driven away.
The secretary smiled, but he had other thoughts to
dwell upon, and soon dismissed the topic. Dinner was
brought him, but he sent it down untasted; and, in rest-
less pacings up and down the room, and constant glances
at the clock, and many futile efforts to sit down and
read, or go to sleep, or look out of the window, consumed
four weary hours. When the dial told him thus much
time had crept away, he stole up stairs to the top of the
house, and coming out upon the roof sat down, with his
face towards the east.
Heedless of the fresh air that blew upon his heated
brow, of the pleasant meadows from which he turned,
of the piles of roofs and chimneys upon which he looked,
of the smoke and rising mist he vainly sought to pierce,
of the shrill cries of children at their evening sports,
the distant hum and turmoil of the town, the cheerful
country breath that rustled past to meet it, and to droop
and die; he watched, and watched, till it was dark-
save for the specks of light that twinkled in the streets
below and far away-and, as the darkness deepened,
strained his gaze and grew more eager yet.
“Nothing but gloom in that direction, still!” he mut-
tered restlessly. “Dog! where is the redness in the sky
you promised me!”
CHAPTER LIV.
RUMOURS of the prevailing disturbances had, by this
time, begun to be pretty generally circulated through
the towns and villages round London, and the tidings
were everywhere received with that appetite for the
marvellous and love of the terrible which have probably
been among the natural characteristics of mankind since
the creation of the world. These accounts, however,
appeared, to many persons at that day—as they would
to us at present, but that we know them to be matter of
history—so monstrous and improbable, that a great
number of those who were resident at a distance, and

who were credulous enough on other points, were really
unable to bring their minds to believe that such things
could be; and rejected the intelligence they received on
all hands as wholly fabulous and absurd.
Mr. Willet-not so much, perhaps, on account of his
having argued and settled the matter with himself, as
by reason of his constitutional obstinacy-was one of
those who positively refused to entertain the current
topic for a moment. On this very evening, and perhaps
at the very time when Gashford kept his solitary watch,
old John was so red in the face with perpetually shaking
his head in contradiction of his three ancient cronies
and pot companions, that he was quite a phenomenon
to behold, and lighted up the Maypole porch, wherein
they sat together, like a monstrous carbuncle in a fairy
tale.
“Do you think, sir,” said Mr. Willet, looking hard at
Solomon Daisy-for it was his custom in cases of per-
sonal altercation to fasten upon the smallest man in the
party—“ do you think, sir, that I'm a born fool?”
“ No, no, Johnny,” returned Solomon, looking round
upon the little circle of which he formed a part; “we
all know better than that. You're no fool, Johnny.
No, no!"
Mr. Cobb and Mr. Parkes shook their heads in unison,
muttering, “No, no, Johnny, not you!" But as such
compliments had usually the effect of making Mr.
Willet rather more dogged than before, he surveyed
them with a look of deep disdain, and returned for
answer:
“ Then what do you mean by coming here and telling
me that this evening you're a going to walk up to Lon-
don together-you three-you—and have the evidence
of your own senses? An't,” said Mr. Willet, putting his
pipe in his mouth with an air of solemn disgust, “an't
the evidence of my senses enough for you?”
“But we haven't got it, Johnny,” pleaded Parkes,
humbly.
“You haven't got it, sir?" repeated Mr. Willet, eyeing
him from top to toe. “You haven't got it, sir? You
have got it, sir. Don't I tell you that his blessed
Majesty King George the Third would no more stand a
rioting and rollicking in his streets than he'd stand
being crowed over by his own Parliament?”

“Yes, Johnny, but that's your sense -- not your
senses,” said the adventurous Mr. Parkes.
“How do you know?" retorted John, with great dig-
nity. “You're a contradicting pretty free, you are, sir.
How do you know which it is? I am not aware I ever
told you, sir."
Mr. Parkes, finding himself in the position of having
got into metaphysics without exactly seeing his way out
of them, stammered forth an apology and retreated from
the argument. There then ensued a silence of some ten
minutes or a quarter of an hour, at the expiration of
which period Mr. Willet was observed to rumble and
shake with laughter, and presently remarked, in refer-
ence to his late adversary, “ that he hoped he had tackled
him enough.” Thereupon Messrs. Cobb and Daisy
laughed and nodded, and Parkes was looked upon as
thoroughly and effectually put down.
“Do you suppose, if all this was true, that Mr. Hare-
dale would be constantly away from home, as he is? "
said John, after another silence. “Do you think he
wouldn't be afraid to leave his house with them two
young women in it, and only a couple of men, or so?”
“Ay, but then you know,” returned Solomon Daisy,
“his house is a goodish way out of London, and they do
say that the rioters won't go more than two mile, or
three at farthest, off the stones. Besides, you know,
some of the Catholic gentlefolks have actually sent
trinkets and such-like down here for safety—at least, so
trin storybory s that you
“ The story goes!” said Mr. Willet testily. “Yes, sir.
The story goes that you saw a ghost last March. But
nobody believes it."
“ Well!” said Solomon, rising, to divert the attention
of his two friends, who tittered at this retort: “believed
or disbelieved, it's true; and true or not, if we mean to
go to London, we must be going at once. So shake
hands, Johnny, and good-night.”
“I shall shake hands,” returned the landlord, putting
his into his pockets, “with no man as goes to London
on such nonsensical errands.”
The three cronies were therefore reduced to the neces-
sity of shaking his elbows; having performed that cere-
mony, and brought from the house their hats, and sticks,
and great-coats, they bade him good-night and departed;

promising to bring him on the morrow full and true ac-
counts of the real state of the city, and if it were quiet,
to give him the full merit of his victory.
John Willet looked after them, as they plodded along
the road in the rich glow of a summer evening; and
knocking the ashes out of his pipe, laughed inwardly at
their folly, until his sides were sore. When he had quite
exhausted himself-which took some time, for he laughed
as slowly as he thought and spoke-he sat himself com-
fortably with his back to the house, put his legs upon
the bench, then his apron over his face, and fell sound
asleep.
How long he slept, matters not; but it was for no brief
space, for when he awoke the rich light had faded, the
sombre hues of night were falling fast upon the land-
scape, and a few bright stars were already twinkling
overhead. The birds were all at roost, the daisies on
the green had closed their fairy hoods, the honeysuckle
twining round the porch exhaled its perfume in a two-
fold degree, as though it lost its coyness at that silent
time and loved to shed its fragrance on the night; the
ivy scarcely stirred its deep green leaves. How tran-
quil and how beautiful it was!
Was there no sound in the air, besides the gentle rust-
ling of the trees and the grasshopper's merry chirp ?
Hark! Something very faint and distant, not unlike the
murmuring in a sea-shell. Now it grew louder, fainter
now, and now it altogether died away. Presently, it
came again, subsided, came once more, grew louder,
fainter-swelled into a roar. It was on the road, and
varied with its windings. All at once it burst into a dis-
tinct sound—the voices and the tramping feet of many
men.
It is questionable whether old John Willet, even then,
would have thought of the rioters, but for the cries of
his cook and housemaid, who ran screaming up-stairs
and locked themselves into one of the old garrets-
shrieking dismally when they had done so, by way of
rendering their place of refuge perfectly secret and se-
cure. These two females did afterwards depone that
Mr. Willet in his consternation uttered but one word,
and called that up the stairs in a stentorian voice,
six distinct times. But as this word was a monosyllable,
which, however inoffensive when applied to the quad-

ruped it denotes, is highly reprehensible when used in
connection with females of unimpeachable character,
many persons were inclined to believe that the young
women laboured under some hallucination caused by
excessive fear; and that their ears deceived them.
Be this as it may, John Willet, in whom the very
uttermost extent of dull-headed perplexity supplied the
place of courage, stationed himself in the porch, and
waited for their coming up. Once it dimly occurred to
him that there was a kind of door to the house, which
had a lock and bolts; and at the same time some
shadowy ideas of shutters to the lower windows flitted
through his brain. But he stood stock still, looking
down the road in the direction in which the noise was
rapidly advancing, and did not so much as take his
hands out of his pockets.
He had not to wait long. A dark mass, looming
through a cloud of dust, soon became visible; the mob
quickened their pace; shouting and whooping like sav-
ages, they came rushing on pell-mell; and in a few
seconds he was bandied from hand to hand, in the heart
of a crowd of men.
“Holloa!” cried a voice he knew, as the man who
spoke came clearing through the throng. “Where is
he? Give him to me. Don't hurt him. How now, old
Jack! Ha, ha, ha!”
Mr. Willet looked at him, and saw it was Hugh; but
he said nothing, and thought nothing.
“These lads are thirsty and must drink!” cried Hugh,
thrusting him back towards the house. “Bustle, Jack,
bustle. Show us the best-the very best—the over-proof
that you keep for your own drinking, Jack!".
John faintly articulated the words, “ Who's to pay?”
“He says 'Who's to pay!! ” cried Hugh, with a roar of
laughter which was loudly echoed by the crowd. Then
turning to John he added, “Pay! Why, nobody.”
John stared round at the mass of faces--some grin-
ning, some fierce, some lighted up by torches, some in-
distinct, some dusky and shadowy: some looking at him,
some at his house, some at each other-and while he was,
as he thought, in the very act of doing so, found him.
self, without any consciousness of having moved, in the
bar; sitting down in an arm-chair and watching the de-
struction of his property as if it were some queer play or

431
entertainment of an astonishing and stupefying nature,
but having no reference to himself—that he could make
out-at all.
Yes. Here was the bar—the bar that the boldest never
entered without special invitation--the sanctuary, the
mystery, the hallowed ground: here it was, crammed
with men, clubs, sticks, torches, pistols; filled with a
deafening noise, oaths, shouts, screams, hootings;
changed all at once into a bear-garden, a madhouse, an
infernal temple: men darting in and out, by door and
window, smashing the glass, turning the taps, drinking
liquor out of China punchbowls, sitting astride of casks,
smoking private and personal pipes, cutting down the
sacred grove of lemons, hacking and hewing at the cele-
brated cheese, breaking open inviolable drawers, putting
things in their pockets which didn't belong to them, di-
viding his own money before his own eyes, wantonly
wasting, breaking, pulling down and tearing up:
nothing quiet, nothing private; men everywhere-
above, below, overhead, in the bed-rooms, in the kitchen,
in the yard, in the stables-clambering in at windows
when there were doors wide open; dropping out of win-
dows when the stairs were handy; leaping over the ban-
nisters into chasms of passages: new faces and figures
presenting themselves every instant-some yelling, some
singing, some fighting, some breaking glass and crock-
ery, some laying the dust with the liquor they couldn't
drink, some ringing the bells till they pulled them down,
others beating them with pokers till they beat them into
fragments: more men still-more, more, more-swarm-
ing on like insects: noise, smoke, light, darkness, frolic,
anger, laughter, groans, plunder, fear, and ruin!
Nearly all the time while John looked on at this bewil-
dering scene Hugh kept near him; and though he was
the loudest, wildest, most destructive villain there, he
saved his old master's bones a score of times. Nay,
even when Mr. Tappertit, excited by liquor, came up,
and in assertion of his prerogative politely kicked John
Willet on the shins, Hugh bade him return the compli-
ment; and if old John had had sufficient presence of
mind to understand this whispered direction, and to
profit by it, he might no doubt, under Hugh’s protection,
have done so with impunity.
At length the band began to re-assemble outside the

.
house, and to call those within to join them, for they
were losing time. These murmurs increasing and at-
taining a high pitch, Hugh and some of those who yet
lingered in the bar, and who plainly were the leaders of
the troop, took counsel together, apart, as to what was
to be done with John to keep him quiet until their Chig-
well work was over. Some proposed to set the house on
fire and leave him in it; others, that he should be reduced
to a state of temporary insensibility, by knocking on the
head; others, that he should be sworn to sit where he
was until to-morrow at the same hour; others again,
that he should be gagged and taken off with them,
under a sufficient guard. All these propositions being
overruled, it was concluded, at last, to bind him in his
chair, and the word was passed for Dennis.
“Look’ee here, Jack!” said Hugh, striding up to him,
" we're going to tie you, hand and foot, but otherwise
you won't be hurt. D’ye hear?”
John Willet looked at another man, as if he didn't
know which was the speaker, and muttered something
about an ordinary every Sunday at two o'clock.
“You won't be hurt, I tell you, Jack-do you hear me?"
roared Hugh, impressing the assurance upon him by
means of a heavy blow on the back. "He's so dead
scared, he's wool-gathering, I think. Give him a drop
of something to drink here. Hand over, one of you.”
A glass of liquor being passed forward, Hugh poured
the contents down old John's throat. Mr. Willet feebly
smacked his lips, thrust his hand into his pocket, and
inquired what was to pay; adding, as he looked vacantly
round, that he believed there was a trifle of broken
glass-
“He's out of his senses for the time, it's my belief,”
said Hugh, after shaking him, without any visible effect
upon his system, until his keys rattled in his pocket.
"Where's that Dennis?”.
The word was again passed, and presently Mr. Dennis,
with a long cord bound about his middle, something
after the manner of a friar, came hurrying in, attended
by a body-guard of half-a-dozen of his men.
“Come! Be alive here!” cried Hugh, stamping his foot
upon the ground. “Make haste!”
Dennis, with a wink and .a nod, unwound the cord
from about his person, and raising his eyes to the ceil-

ing, looked all over it, and round the walls and cornice,
with a curious eye; then shook his head.
“Move, man, can't you!” cried Hugh, with another
impatient stamp of his foot. · “ Are we to wait here till
the cry has gone for ten miles round, and our work's in-
terrupted?”
“It's all very fine talking, brother," answered Dennis,
stepping towards him; “but unless-—” and here he
whispered in his ear—“unless we do it over the door, it
can't be done at all in this here room.”
“ What can't?” Hugh demanded.
“What can't!" retorted Dennis. “Why, the old man
can't.”
“Why, you weren't going to hang him!” cried Hugh.
“No, brother?” returned the hangman, with a stare.
“What else?
Hugh made no answer, but snatching the rope from
his companion's hands, proceeded to bind old John him-
self; but his very first move was so bungling and unskil-
ful, that Mr. Dennis entreated, almost with tears in his
eyes, that he might be permitted to perform the duty.
Hugh consenting, he achieved it in a twinkling.
“There!” he said, looking mournfully at John Willet,
who displayed no more emotion in his bonds than he
had shown out of them. “ That's what I call pretty,
and workmanlike. He's quite a picter now. But,
brother, just a word with you—now that he's ready
trussed, as one may say, wouldn't it be better for all
parties if we were to work him off? It would read un-
common well in the newspapers, it would indeed. The
public would think a great deal more on us!”
Hugh, inferring what his companion meant, rather
from his gestures than his technical mode of expressing
himself (to which, as he was ignorant of his calling, he
wanted the clue), rejected this proposition for the second
time, and gave the word “Forward!” which was echoed
by a hundred voices from without.
°• To the Warren!” shouted Dennis as he ran out, fol-
lowed by the rest. “A witness's house, my lads!"
A loud yell followed, and the whole throng hurried
off, mad for pillage and destruction. Hugh lingered be-
hind for a few moments to stimulate himself with more
drink, and to set all the taps running, a few of which
had accidentally been spared; then, glancing round the

despoiled and plundered room, through whose shattered
window the rioters had thrust the Maypole itself-for
even that had been sawn down-lighted a torch, clapped
the mute and motionless John Willet on the back, and
waving his light above his head, and uttering a fierce
shout, hastened after his companions.
CHAPTER LV.
JOHN WILLET, left alone in his dismantled bar, con-
tinued to sit staring about him; awake as to his eyes,
certainly, but with all his powers of reason and reflec-
tion in a sound and dreamless sleep.. He looked round
upon the room which had been for years, and was within
an hour ago, the pride of his heart, and not a muscle of
his face was moved. The night without looked black
and cold through the dreary gaps in the casement; the
precious liquids, now nearly leaked away, dripped with
a hollow sound upon the floor; the Maypole peered rue-
fully in through the broken window, like the bowsprit
of a wrecked ship; the ground might have been the bot-
tom of the sea, it was so strewn with precious fragments.
Currents of air rushed in, as the old doors jarred and
creaked upon their hinges; the candles flickered and
guttered down, and made long winding-sheets; the
cheery deep-red curtains flapped and fluttered idly in
the wind; even the stout Dutch kegs, overthrown and
lying empty in dark corners, seemed the mere husks of
good fellows whose jollity had departed, and who could
kindle with a friendly glow no more. John saw this
desolation, and yet saw it not. He was perfectly con-
tented to sit there, staring at it, and felt no more indig-
nation or discomfort in his bonds than if they had been
robes of honour. So far as he was personally concerned,
old Time lay snoring, and the world stood still.
Save for the dripping of the barrels, the rustling of
such light fragments of destruction as the wind affected,
and the dull creaking of the open doors, all was pro-
foundly quiet: indeed, these sounds, like the ticking of
the death-watch in the night, only made the silence they
invaded deeper and more apparent. But quiet or noisy,
it was all one to John. If a train of heavy artillery

436
could have come up and commenced ball practice outside
the window, it would have been all the same to him.
He was a long way beyond surprise. A ghost couldn't
have overtaken him.
By-and-by he heard a footstep-a hurried, and yet
cautious footstep-coming on towards the house. It
stopped, advanced again, then seemed to go quite round
it. Having done that, it came beneath the window,
and a head looked in.
It was strongly relieved against the darkness outside
by the glare of the guttering candles. A pale, worn,
withered face; the eyes-but that was owing to its gaunt
condition—unnaturally large and bright; the hair, a
grizzled black. It gave a searching glance all round
the room, and a deep voice said:
“Are you alone in this house?”
John made no sign, though the question was repeated
twice, and he heard it distinctly. After a moment's
pause, the man got in at the window. John was not at
all surprised at this, either. There had been so much
getting in and out of window in the course of the last
hour or so, that he had quite forgotten the door, and
seemed to have lived among such exercises from infancy.
The man wore a large, dark, faded cloak, and a
slouched hat; he walked up close to John, and looked at
him. John returned the compliment with interest. ·
“How long have you been sitting thus?” said the man.
John considered, but nothing came of it.
“Which way have the party gone?”
Some wandering speculations relative to the fashion
of the stranger's boots got into Mr. Willet's mind by
some accident or other, but they got out again in a
hurry, and left him in his former state.
“You would do well to speak,” said the man: “you
may keep a whole skin, though you have nothing else
left that can be hurt. Which way have the party gone?”
“That!” said John, finding his voice all at once, and
nodding with perfect good faith-he couldn't point; he
was so tightly bound-in exactly the opposite direction
to the right one.
“You lie!” said the man angrily, and with a threaten-
ing gesture. “I came that way. You would betray
me.”
It was so evident that John's imperturbability was

not assumed, but was the result of the late proceedings
under his roof, that the man stayed his hand in the very
act of striking him, and turned away.
John looked after him without so much as a twitch in
a single nerve of his face. He seized a glass, and hold-
ing it under one of the little casks until a few drops
were collected, drank them greedily off; then throwing
it down upon the floor impatiently, he took the vessel
in his hands and drained it into his throat. Some scraps
of bread and meat were scattered about, and on these
he fell next; eating them with voracity, and pausing
every now and then to listen for some fancied noise out-
side. When he had refreshed himself in this manner
with violent haste, and raised another barrel to his lips,
he pulled his hat upon his brow as though he were about
to leave the house, and turned to John.
“Where are your servants?”
Mr. Willet indistinctly remembered to have heard the
rioters calling to them to throw the key of the room
in which they were, out of window, for their keeping.
He therefore replied, “ Locked up.”
“ Well for them if they remain quiet, and well for
you if you do the like," said the man. “Now show me
the way the party went.”
This time Mr. Willet indicated it correctly. The man
was hurrying to the door, when suddenly there came
towards them on the wind, the loud and rapid tolling of
an alarm bell, and then a bright and vivid glare streamed
up, which illumined, not only the whole chamber, but
all the country.
It was not the sudden change from darkness to this
dreadful light, it was not the sound of distant shrieks
and shouts of triumph, it was not this dread invasion of
the serenity and peace of night, that drove the man
back as though a thunderbolt had struck him. It was
the bell. If the ghastliest shape the human mind has
ever pictured in its wildest dreams had risen up before
him, he could not have staggered backward from its
touch, as he did from the first sound of that loud iron
voice. With eyes that started from his head, his limbs
convulsed, his face most horrible to see, he raised one
arm high up into the air, and holding something vision-
ary, back and down, with his other hand, drove at it as
though he held a knife and stabbed it to the heart. He

437
clutched his hair, and stopped his ears, and travelled
madly round and round; then gave a frightful cry, and
with it rushed away; still, still, the bell tolled on and
seemed to follow him-louder and louder, hotter and
hotter yet. The glare grew brighter, the roar of voices
deeper; the crash of heavy bodies falling shook the air;
bright streams of sparks rose up into the sky; but louder
than them all-rising faster far, to Heaven-a million
times more fierce and furious-pouring forth dreadful
secrets after its long silence—speaking the language of
the dead—the bell—the bell !
What hunt of spectres could surpass that dread pur-
suit and flight! Had there been a legion of them on his
track, he could have better borne it. They would have
had a beginning and an end, but here all space was full.
The one pursuing voice was everywhere; it sounded in
the earth, the air; shook the long grass, and howled
among the trembling trees. The echoes caught it up,
the owls hooted as it flew upon the breeze, the nightin-
gale was silent and hid herself among the thickest
boughs; it seemed to goad and urge the angry fire, and
lash it into madness; everything was steeped in one pre-
vailing red; the glow was everywhere; nature was
drenched in blood; still the remorseless crying of that
awful voice—the bell, the bell !
It ceased; but not in his ears. The knell was at his
heart. No work of man had ever voice like that which
sounded there, and warned him that it cried unceasingly
to Heaven. Who could hear that bell and not know
what it said! There was murder in its every note-
cruel, relentless, savage murder—the murder of a con-
fiding man, by one who held his every trust. Its ring-
ing summoned phantoms from their graves. What face
was that, in which a friendly smile changed to a look
of half incredulous horror, which stiffened for a moment
into one of pain, then changed again into an imploring
glance at Heaven, and so fell idly down with upturned
eyes, like the dead stags he had often peeped at when a
little child: shrinking and shuddering—there was a
dreadful thing to think of now!-and clinging to an apron
as he looked! He sank upon the ground, and grovelling
down as if he would dig himself a place to hide in, cov-
esed his face and ears; but no, no, no—a hundred walls
and roofs of brass would not shut out that bell, for in it

spoke the wrathful voice of God, and from that voice
the whole wide universe could not afford a refuge!
While he rushed up and down, not knowing where to
turn, and while he lay crouching there, the work went
briskly on indeed. When they left the Maypole, the
rioters formed into a solid body, and advanced at a
quick pace towards the Warren. Rumour of their ap-
proach having gone before, they found the garden doors
fast closed, the windows made secure, and the house
profoundly dark: not a light being visible in any portion
of the building. After some fruitless ringing at the
bells, and beating at the iron gates, they drew off a few
paces to reconnoitre and confer upon the course it would
be best to take.
Very little conference was needed, when all were bent
upon one desperate purpose, infuriated with liquor, and
flushed with successful riot. The word being given to
surround the house, some climbed the gates or dropped
into the shallow trench and scaled the garden wall,
while others pulled down the solid iron fence, and while
they made a breach to enter by, made deadly weapons
of the bars. The house being completely encircled, a
small number of men were despatched to break open a
tool-shed in the garden; and during their absence on
this errand, the remainder contented themselves with
knocking violently at the doors, and calling to those
within to come down and open them on peril of their
lives.
No answer being returned to this repeated summons,
and the detachment who had been sent away coming
back with an accession of pickaxes, spades, and hoes,
they-together with those who had such arms already,
or carried (as many did) axes, poles, and crow-bars-
struggled into the foremost rank, ready to beset the
doors.and windows. They had not at this time more
than a dozen lighted torches among them; but when
these preparations were completed, flaming links were
distributed and passed from hand to hand with such
rapidity, that, in a minute's time, at least two-thirds of
the whole roaring mass, bore, each man, in his hand, a
blazing brand. Whirling these about their heads they
raised a loud shout, and fell to work upon the doors and
windows.
Amidst the clattering of heavy blows, the rattling of

broken glass, the cries and execrations of the mob, and
all the din and turmoil of the scene, Hugh and his
friends kept together at the turret door where Mr. Hare-
dale had last admitted him and old John Willet, and
spent their united force on that. It was a strong old
oaken door, guarded by good bolts and a heavy bar, but
it soon went crashing in upon the narrow stairs behind,
and made, as it were, a platform to facilitate their tear-
ing up into the rooms above. Almost at the same
moment, a dozen other points were forced, and at every
one the crowd poured in like water.
A few armed servant-men were posted in the hall,
and when the rioters forced an entrance there, they
fired some half-a-dozen shots. But these taking no
effect, and the concourse coming on like an army of
devils, they only thought of consulting their own safety,
and retreated, echoing their assailants' cries, and hoping
in the confusion to be taken for rioters themselves; in
which stratagem they succeeded, with the exception of
one old man who was never heard of again, and was
said to have had his brains beaten out with an iron bar
(one of his fellows reported that he had seen the old man
fall), and to have been afterwards burnt in the flames.
The besiegers being now in complete possession of the
house, spread themselves over it from garret to cellar,
and plied their demon labours fiercely. While some
small parties kindled bonfires underneath the windows,
others broke up the furniture and cast the fragments
down to feed the flames below; where the apertures in
the wall (windows no longer) were large enough, they
threw out tables, chests of drawers, beds, mirrors, pic-
tures, and flung them whole into the fire; while every
fresh addition to the blazing masses was received with
shouts, and howls, and yells, which added new and dis-
mal terrors to the conflagration. Those who had axes,
and had spent their fury on the movables, chopped and
tore down the doors and window frames, broke up the
flooring, hewed away the rafters, and buried men who
lingered in the upper rooms in heaps of ruins. Some
searched the drawers, the chests, the boxes, writing-
desks and closets, for jewels, plate and money; while
others, less mindful of gain and more mad for destruc-
tion, cast their whole contents into the court-yard with-
out examination, and called to those below to heap them

on the blaze. Men who had been into the cellars, and
had staved the casks, rushed to and fro stark mad, set-
ting fire to all they saw-often to the dresses of their
own friends—and kindling the building in so many parts
that some had no time for escape, and were seen, with
drooping hands and blackened faces, hanging senseless
on the window-sills to which they had crawled, until
they were sucked and drawn into the burning gulf.
The more the fire crackled and raged, the wilder and
more cruel the men grew; as though moving in that
element they became fiends, and changed their earthly
nature for the qualities that give delight in hell.
The burning pile, revealing rooms and passages red-
hot, through gaps made in the crumbling walls; the
tributarý fire that licked the outer bricks and stones,
with their long forked tongues, and ran up to meet the
glowing mass within; the shining of the flames
upon the villains who looked on and fed them;
the roaring of the angry blaze, so bright and high that
it seemed in its rapacity to have swallowed up the very
smoke; the living flakes the wind bore rapidly away and
hurried on with, like a storm of fiery snow; the noise-
less breaking of great beams of wood, which fell like
feathers on the heap of ashes, and crumbled in the very
act to sparks and powder; the lurid tinge that over-
spread the sky, and the darkness, very deep by contrast,
which prevailed around; the exposure to the coarse,
common gaze, of every little nook that home had made
a sacred place, and the destruction by rude hands of
every little household favourite which old associations
made a dear and precious thing; all this taking place-
not among pitying looks and friendly murmurs of com-
passion, but brutal shouts and exultations, which seemed
to make the very rats who stood by the old house too
long, creatures with some claim upon the pity and re-
gard of those it's roof had sheltered-combined to form
a scene never to be forgotten by those who saw it and
were not actors in the work, so long as life endured.
And who were they? The alarm-bell rang—and it was
pulled by no faint or hesitating hands—for a long time;
but not a soul was seen. Some of the insurgents said
that when it ceased they heard the shrieks of women,
and saw some garments fluttering in the air, as a party
of men bore away no unresisting burdens. No one

could say that this was true or false, in such an uproar;
but where was Hugh? Who among them had seen him,
since the forcing of the doors? The cry spread through
the body. Where was Hugh!
“Here!” he hoarsely cried, appearing from the dark-
ness; out of breath, and blackened with the smoke.
“ We have done all we can; the fire is burning itself
out; and even the corners where it hasn't spread are
nothing but heaps of ruins. Disperse, my lads, while
the coast's clear: get back by different ways; and meet
as usual!" With that, he disappeared again-contrary
to his wont, for he was always first to advance, and
last to go away-leaving them to follow homewards
as they would.
It was not an easy task to draw off such a throng. If
Bedlam gates had been flung open wide, there would
not have issued forth such maniacs as the frenzy of that
night had made. There were men there who danced
and trampled on the beds of flowers as though they trod
down human enemies, and wrenched them from the
stalks, like savages who twist human necks. There
were men who cast their lighted torches in the air, and
suffered them to fall upon their heads and faces, blister-
ing the skin with deep, unseemly burns. There were
men who rushed up to the fire, and paddled in it with
their hands as if in water; and others who were re-
strained by force from plunging in, to gratify their deadly
longing. On the skull of one drunken lad—not twenty
by his looks-who lay upon the ground with a bottle to
his mouth, the lead from the roof came streaming down
in a shower of liquid fire, white hot, melting his head
like wax. When the scattered parties were collected,
men-living yet, but singed as with hot irons-were
plucked out of the cellars, and carried off upon the
shoulders of others, who strove to wake them as they
went along, with ribald jokes, and left them, dead, in the
passages of hospitals. But of all the howling throng not
one learnt mercy from, or sickened at these sights; nor
was the fierce, besotted, senseless rage of one man
glutted.
Slowly, and in small clusters, with hoarse hurrahs and
repetitions of their usual cry, the assembly dropped
away. The last few red-eyed stragglers reeled after
those who had gone before; the distant noise of men

calling to each other, and whistling for others whom
they missed, grew fainter and fainter; at length even
these sounds died away, and silence reigned alone.
Silence indeed! The glare of the flames had sunk into
a fitful flashing light; and the gentle stars, invisible till
now, looked down upon the blackening heap. A dull
smoke hung upon the ruin as though to hide it from
those eyes of Heaven; and the wind forebore to move it.
Bare walls, roof open to the sky-chambers, where the
beloved dead had, many and many a fair day, risen to
new life and energy; where so many dear ones had been
sad and merry; which were connected with so many
thoughts and hopes, regrets and changes-all gone.
Nothing left but a dull and dreary blank-a smouldering
heap of dust and ashes—the silence and solitude of utter
desolation.
CHAPTER LVI.
THE Maypole cronies, little dreaming of the change so
soon to come upon their favourite haunt, struck through
the Forest path upon their way to London; and avoid-
ing the main road, which was hot and dusty, kept to the
by-paths and the fields. As they drew nearer to their
destination, they began to make inquiries of the people
whom they passed, concerning the riots, and the truth
or falsehood of the stories they had heard. The answers
went far beyond any intelligence that had spread to
quiet Chigwell. One man told them that that afternoon
the Guards, conveying to Newgate some rioters who had
been re-examined, had been set upon by the mob and com-
pelled to retreat; another, that the houses of two wit-
nesses near Clare Market were about to be pulled down
when he came away; another, that Sir George Saville's
house in Leicester Fields was to be burned that night,
and that it would go hard with Sir George if he fell into
the people's hands, as it was he who had brought in the
Catholic bill. All accounts agreed that the mob were
out, in stronger numbers and more numerous parties
than had yet appeared; that the streets were unsafe;
that no man's house or life was worth an hour's pur-
chase; that the public consternation was increasing
every moment; and that many families had already fled

the city. One fellow, who wore the popular colour,
damned them for not having cockades in their hats, and
bade them set a good watch to-morrow night upon the
prison doors, for the locks would have a straining;
another asked if they were fire-proof, that they walked
abroad without the distinguishing mark of all good and
true men; and a third, who rode on horseback, and was
quite alone, ordered them to throw, each man, a shilling
into his hat, towards the support of the rioters. Although
they were afraid to refuse compliance with this demand,
and were much alarmed by these reports, they agreed,
having come so far, to go forward and see the real state
of things with their own eyes. So they pushed on
quicker, as men do who are excited by portentious news;
and ruminating on what they had heard, spoke little to
each other.
It was now night, and as they came nearer to the city
they had dismal confirmation of this intelligence in three
great fires, all close together, which burnt fiercely and
were gloomily reflected in the sky. Arriving in the
immediate suburbs they found that almost every house
had chalked upon its door in large characters, “No
Popery,” that the shops were shut, and that alarm and
anxiety were depicted in every face they passed.
Noting these things with a degree of apprehension
which neither of the three cared to impart in its full ex-
tent to his companions, they came to a turnpike gate,
which was shut. They were passing through the turn-
stile on the path, when a horseman rode up from
London at a hard gallop, and called to the toll-keeper,
in a voice of great agitation, to open quickly in the
name of God.
The adjuration was so earnest and vehement, that
the man, with a lantern in his hand, came running out
----toll-keeper though he was—and was about to throw
the gate open, when happening to look behind him,
he exclaimed, “ Good Heaven, what's that! Another
fire!”
At this the three turned their heads and saw in the
distance-straight in the direction whence they had
come-a broad sheet of flame, casting a threatening light
upon the clouds, which glimmered as though the con-
flagration were behind them, and showed like a wrath-
ful sunset.

“My mind misgives me," said the horseman, “or I
know from what far building those flames come. Don't
stand aghast, my good fellow. Open the gate!”
“Sir,” cried the man, laying his hand upon his horse's
bridle as he let him through, “I know you now, sir;
be advised by me; do not go on. I saw them pass and
know what kind of men they are. You will be mur-
dered."
“So be it!” said the horseman, looking intently
towards the fire, and not at him who spoke.
“But sir-sir,” cried the man, grasping at his rein
more tightly yet, “if you do go on wear the blue riband.
Here, sir,” he added, taking one from his own hat, “it's
necessity, not choice, that makes me wear it; it's love
of life and home, sir. Wear it for this one night, sir;
only for this one night.
"Do!” cried the three friends, pressing round his horse.
“Mr. Haredale-worthy sir-good gentlemen-pray be
persuaded.”
" Who's that?” cried Mr. Haredale, stooping down to
look. “Did I hear Daisy's voice?”
“ You did, sir,” cried the little man. “Do be per-
suaded, sir. This gentleman says very true. . Your life
may hang upon it.”
50 Are you,” said Mr. Hardale abruptly, “afraid to
come with me?"
“I, sir?-N-n-no.”
“Put that riband in your hat. If we meet the rioters,
swear that I took you prisoner for wearing it. I will
tell them so with my own lips; for as I hope for mercy
when I die, I will take no quarter from them, nor shall
they have quarter from me, if we come hand to hand to-
night. Up here—behind me--quick! Clasp me tight
round the body, and fear nothing.”
In an instant they were riding away, at full gallop,
in a dense cloud of dust, and speeding on, like hunters
in a dream.
It was well the good horse knew the road he traversed,
for never once--no, never once in all the journey-did
Mr. Haredale cast his eyes upon the ground, or turn
them, for an instant, from the light towards which they
sped so madly. Once he said in a low voice “It is my
house,” but that was the only time he spoke. When
they came to dark and doubtful places, he never forgot

445
to put his hand upon the little man to hold him more
securely in his seat, but he kept his head erect and his
eyes fixed on the fire, then, and always.
The road was dangerous enough, for they went the
nearest way-headlong–far from the , highway_by
lonely lanes and paths, where wagon-wheels had worn
deep ruts; where hedge and ditch hemmed in the nar-
row strip of ground; and tall trees, arching overhead,
made it profoundly dark. But on, on, on, with neither
stop nor stumble, till they reached the Maypole door,
and could plainly see that the fire began to fade, as if
for want of fuel.
“Down-for one moment-for but one moment,” said
Mr. Haredale, helping Daisy to the ground, and follow-
ing himself. “ Willet-Willet—where are my niece and
servants-Willet!”
Crying to him distractedly, he rushed into the bar.
The landlord bound and fastened to his chair; the place
dismantled, stripped, and pulled about his ears-nobody
could have taken shelter here.
He was a strong man, accustomed to restrain himself
and repress his strong emotions; but this preparation
for what was to follow—though he had seen that fire
burning, and knew that his house must be razed to the
ground—was more than he could bear. He covered his
face with his hands for a moment, and turned away his
head.
"Johnny, Johnny,” said Solomon and the simple-
hearted fellow cried outright, and wrung his hands-
"oh, dear old Johnny, here's a change! That the May-
pole bar should come to this, and we should live to see
it! The old Warren, too, Johnny-Mr. Haredale-oh,
Johnny, what a piteous sight this is!"
Pointing to Mr. Haredale as he said these words, little
Solomon Daisy put his elbows on the back of Mr. Wil-
let's chair, and fairly blubbered on his shoulder.
While Solomon was speaking, old John sat, mute as a
stock-fish, staring at him with an unearthly glare, and
displaying, by every possible symptom, entire and com-
plete unconsciousness. But when Solomon was silent
again, John followed, with his great round eyes, the
direction of his looks, and did appear to have some
dawning distant notion that somebody had come to see
him,

“You know us, don't you, Johnny?” said the little
clerk, rapping himself on the breast. “ Daisy, you know
-Chigwell Church-bell-ringer-little desk on Sundays
-eh, Johnny?”
Mr. Willet reflected for a few moments, and then
muttered, as it were mechanically: “Let us sing to the
praise and glory of—”.
“ Yes, to be sure,” cried the little man, hastily; "that's
it—that's me, Johnny. You're all right now, ain't you?
Say you're all right, Johnny."
* Åll right?" pondered Mr. Willet, as if that were a
matter entirely between himself and his conscience.
“ All right? Ah!
“They haven't been misusing you with sticks, or
pokers, or any other blunt instruments—have they,
Johnny?" asked Solomon, with a very anxious glance
at Mr. Willet's head. “They didn't beat you, did they?"
John knitted his brow; looked downwards, as if he
were mentally engaged in some arithmetical calcula-
tions; then upwards, as if the total would not come at
his call; then at Solomon Daisy, from his eyebrow to his
shoe-buckle; then very slowly round the bar. And then
a great, round, leaden-looking, and not at all transparent
tear, came rolling out of each eye, and he said, as he
shook his head:
“If they'd only had the goodness to murder me, I'd
have thanked 'em kindly.”
“No, no, no, don't say that, Johnny,” whimpered his
little friend. “It's very, very bad, but not quite so bad
as that. No, no!”
“ Look’ee here, sir!” cried John, turning his rueful
eyes on Mr. Haredale, who had dropped on one knee,
and was hastily beginning to untie his bonds. “Look’ee
here, sir! The very Maypole—the old dumb Maypole-
stares in at the winder, as if it said, “John Willet, John
Willet, let's go and pitch ourselves in the nighest pool
of water as is deep enough to hold us, for our day is
over!”
“Don't, Johnny, don't,” cried his friend: no less af-
fected by this mournful effort of Mr. Willet's imagina-
tion, than by the sepulchral tone in which he had spoken
for the Maypole. “Please don't, Johnny!"
“ Your loss is great, and your misfortune a heavy one,”
said Mr. Haredale, looking restlessly towards the door;

"and this is not a time to comfort you. If it were, I
am in no condition to do so. Before I leave you, tell me
one thing, and try to tell me plainly, I implore you.
Have you seen or heard of Emma?”
“No!” said Mr. Willet.
“Nor any one but these bloodhounds?”
“No!”
“ They rode away, I trust in Heaven, before these
dreadful scenes began,” said Mr. Haredale, who, be-
tween his agitation, his eagerness to mount his horse
again, and the dexterity with which the cords were tied,
had scarcely yet undone one knot. “A knife, Daisy!"
“ You didn't,” said John, looking about, as though he
had lost his pocket-handkerchief or some such slight
article—“ either of you gentlemen-see a-a coffin any-
wheres, did you?”
.“ Willet!” cried Mr. Haredale. Solomon dropped the
knife, and instantly becoming limp from hand to foot,
exclaimed, “Good gracious!”
"_Because,” said John, not at all regarding them,
"a dead man called a little time ago, on his way
yonder. I could have told you what name was on the
plate, if he had brought his coffin with him, and left it
behind. If he didn't, it don't signify."
His landlord, who had listened to these words with
breathless attention, started that moment to his feet;
and, without a word, drew Solomon Daisy to the door,
mounted his horse, took him up behind again, and flew
rather than galloped towards the pile of ruins, which that
day's sun had shone upon, a stately house. Mr. Willet
stared after them, listened, looked down upon himself
to make quite sure that he was still unbound, and, with-
out any manifestation of impatience, disappointment or
surprise, gently relapsed into the condition from which
he had so imperfectly recovered. .
Mr. Haredale tied his horse to the trunk of a tree, and
grasping his companion's arm, stole softly along the
footpath and into what had been the garden of his house.
He stopped for an instant to look upon its smoking walls,
and at the stars that shone through roof and floor upon
the heap of crumbling ashes. Solomon glanced timidly
in his face, but his lips were tightly pressed together, a
resolute and stern expression sat up his brow, and not a
tear, a look, or gesture indicating grief, escaped him.

He drew his sword; felt for a moment in his breast, as
though he carried other arms about him; then grasping
Solomon by the wrist again, went with a cautious step
all round the house. He looked into every doorway and
gap in the wall; retraced his steps at every rustling of
the air among the leaves; and searched in every shad-
owed nook with outstretched hands. Thus they made
the circuit of the building: but they returned to the spot
from which they had set out, without encountering any
human being or finding the least trace of any concealed
straggler.
After a short pause, Mr. Haredale shouted twice or
thrice. Then cried aloud, “Is there any one hiding here
who knows my voice! There is nothing to fear now. If
any of my people are here, I entreat them to answer!"
He called them all by name; his voice was echoed in
many mournful tones; then all was silent as before.
They were standing near the foot of the turret, where
the alarm-bell hung. The fire had raged there, and the
floors had been sawn, and hewn, and beaten down, be-
sides. It was open to the night; but a part of the stair-
case still remained, winding upward from a great mound
of dust and cinders. Fragments of the jagged and
broken steps offered an insecure and giddy footing here
and there, and then were lost again, behind protruding
angles of the wall, or in the deep shadows cast upon it
by other portions of the ruin; for by this time the moon
had risen, and shone brightly.
As they stood there, listening to the echoes as they
died away, and hoping in vain to hear a voice they
knew, some of the ashes in this turret slipped and rolled
down. Startled by the least noise in that melancholy
place, Solomon looked up at his companion's face, and
saw that he had turned towards the spot, and that he
watched and listened keenly.
He covered the little man's mouth with his hand, and
looked again. Instantly, with kindling eyes, he bade
him on his life keep still, and neither speak nor move.
Then holding his breath, and stooping down, he stole
into the turret, with his drawn sword in his hand, and
disappeared.
Terrified to be left there by himself, under such deso-
late circumstances, and after all he had seen and heard
that night, Solomon would have followed, but there had

449
been something in Mr. Haredale's manner and his look,
the recollection of which held him spell-bound. He
stood rooted to the spot; and scarcely venturing to
breathe, looked up with mingled fear and wonder.
Again the ashes slipped and rolled-very, very softly
-again--and then again, as though they crumbled un-
derneath the tread of a stealthy foot. And now a figure
was dimly visible; climbing very softly; and often stop
ping to look down; now it pursued its difficult way; and
now it was hidden from the view again.
It emerged once more, into the shadowy and uncertain
light-higher now, but not much, for the way was steep
and toilsome, and its progress very slow. What phantom
of the brain did he pursue; and why did he look down
so constantly. He knew he was alone? Surely his
mind was not affected by that night's loss and agony.
He was not about to throw himself headlong from the
summit of the tottering wall. Solomon turned sick, and
clasped his hands. His limbs trembled beneath him,
and a cold sweat broke out upon his pallid face.
If he complied with Mr. Haredale's last injunction
now, it was because he had not the power to speak or
move. He strained his gaze, and fixed it on a patch of
moonlight, into which, if he continued to ascend, he
must soon emerge. When he appeared there, he would
try to call to him.
Again the ashes slipped and crumbled; some stones
rolled down, and fell with a dull, heavy sound upon the
ground below. He kept his eyes upon the piece of
moonlight. The figure was coming on, for its shadow
was already thrown upon the wall. Now it appeared-
and now looked round at him-and now-
The horror-stricken clerk uttered a scream that pierced
the air, and cried, “The ghost! The ghost!”.
Long before the echo of his cry had died away,
another form rushed out into the light, flung itself upon
the foremost one, knelt down upon its breast, and
clutched its throat with both hands.
“ Villain!” cried Mr. Haredale, in a terrible voice—for
it was he. “Dead and buried, as all men supposed
through your infernal arts, but reserved by Heaven for
this—at last—at last-I have you. You, whose hands
are red with my brother's blood, and that of his faithful
servant, shed to conceal your own atrocious guilt-you,

Rudze, double murderer and monster, I arrest you in
the name of God, who has delivered you into my hands.
No. Though you had the strength of twenty men,” he
added, as the murderer writhed and struggled, “you
could not escape me, or loosen my grasp to night!"
CHAPTER LVII.
BARNABY, armed as we have seen, continued to pace
up and down before the stable-door; glad to be alone
again, and heartly rejoicing in the unaccustomed silence
and tranquility. After the whirl of noise and riot in
which the last two days had been passed, the pleasures
of solitude and peace were enhanced a thousandfold.
He felt quite happy; and as he leaned upon his staff and
mused, a bright smile overspread his face, and none but
cheerful visions floated into his brain.
Had he no thoughts of her, whose sole delight he was,
and whom he had unconsciously plunged in such bitter
sorrow and such deep affliction? Oh, yes. She was at
the heart of all his cheerful hopes and proud reflections.
It was she whom all this honour and distinction were to
gladden; the joy and profit were for her. What delight
it gave her to hear of the bravery of her poor boy! Ah!
He would have known that, without Hugh's telling him.
And what a precious thing it was to know she lived so
happily, and heard with so much pride (he pictured to
himself her look when they told her) that he was in
such high esteem: bold among the boldest, and trusted
before them all. And when these frays were over, and
the good lord had conquered his enemies, and they were
all at peace again, and he and she were rich, what happi-
ness they would have in talking of these troubled times
when he was a great soldier: and when they sat alone
together in the tranquil twilight, and she had no longer
reason to be anxious for the morrow, what pleasure
would he have in the reflection that this was his doing
-his-poor foolish Barnaby's; and in patting her on the
cheek, and saying with a merry laugh, “Am I silly
now, mother-am I silly now?"
With a lighter heart and step, and eyes the brighter
for the happy tear that dimmed them for a moment,

Barnaby resumed his walk; and singing gaily to him-
self, kept guard upon his quiet post.
His comrade, Grip, the partner of his watch, though
fond of basking in the sunshine, preferred to-day to
walk about the stable; having a great deal to do in
the way of scattering the straw, hiding under it such
small articles as had been casually left about, and
haunting Hugh's bed, to which he seemed to have taken
a particular attachment. Sometimes Barnaby looked in
and called him, and then he came hopping out; but he
merely did this as a concession to his master's weakness,
and soon returned again to his own grave pursuits:
peering into the straw with his bill, and rapidly cover-
ing up the place, as if, Midas-like, he were whispering
secrets to the earth and burying them; constantly busy-
ing himself upon the sly; and affecting, whenever Bar-
naby came past, to look up in the clouds and have
nothing whatever on his mind: in short, conducting
himself, in many respects, in a more than usually
thoughtful, deep, and mysterious manner.
As the day crept on, Barnaby, who had no directions
forbidding him to eat and drink upon his post, but had
been, on the contrary, supplied with a bottle of beer and
a basket of provisions, determined to break his fast,
which he had not done since morning. To this end, he
sat down on the ground before the door, and putting his
staff across his knees in case of alarm or surprise, sum-
moned Grip to dinner.
This call the bird obeyed with great alacrity; crying,
as he sidled up to his master, “ I'm a devil, I'm a Polly,
I'm a kettle, I'm a Protestant, No Popery!" Having
learnt this latter sentiment from the gentry among
whom he had lived of late, he delivered it with uncom-
mon emphasis.
“Well said, Grip!” cried his master, as he fed him with
the daintiest bits.” “Well said, old boy!"
“Never say die, bow, wow, wow, keep up your spirits,
Grip, Grip, Grip, Holloa! We'll all have tea, I'm a Prot-
estant kettle, No Popery!” cried the raven.
“Gordon forever, Grip!” cried Barnaby
The raven, placing his head upon the ground, looked
at his master sideways, as though he would have said,
“Say that again!” Perfectly understanding his desire,
Barnaby repeated the phrase a great m:iny times. The

bird listened with profound attention; sometimes repeat-
ing the popular cry in a low voice, as if to compare the
two, and try if it would at all help him to this new
accomplishment; sometimes flapping his wings, or bark-
ing; and sometimes in a kind of desperation drawing a
multitude of corks, with extraordinary viciousness.
Barnaby was so intent upon his favourite, that he was
not at first aware of the approach of two persons on
horseback, who were riding at a footpace, and coming
straight towards his post. When he perceived them,
however, which he did when they were within some
fifty yards of him, he jumped hastily up, and ordering
Grip within doors, stood with both hands on his staff,
waiting until he should know whether they were friends
or foes.
He had hardly done so, when he observed that those
who advanced were a gentleman and his servant; almost
at the same moment he recognised Lord George Gordon,
before whom he stood uncovered, with his eyes turned
towards the ground.
“Good-day!” said Lord George, not reining in his
horse until he was close beside him. “Well!”
“ All quiet, sir, all safe!” cried Barnaby. “The rest
are away—they went by that path-that one. A grand
party!"
“ Ăy?” said Lord George, looking thoughtfully at him.
“And you?”
“Oh! They left me here to watch-to mount guard-
to keep everything secure till they come back. I'll do it,
sir, for your sake. You're a good gentleman; a kind
gentleman-ay, you are. There are many against you,
but we'll be a match for them, never fear!"
“What's that?” said Lord George-pointing to the
raven, who was peeping out of the stable-door-but still
looking thoughtfully, and in some perplexity, it seemed,
at Barnaby.
“Why, don't you know!" retorted Barnaby, with a
wondering laugh. “Not know what he is! A bird, to
be sure. My bird--my friend-Grip.”
“A devil, a kettle, å Grip, a Polly, a Protestant, No
Popery!” cried the raven.
" Though, indeed,” added Barnaby, laying his hand
upon the neck of Lord George's horse, and speaking
softly, “you had good reason to ask me what he is, for

sometimes it puzzles me—and I am used to him to
think he's only a bird. He's my brother, Grip is-
always with me-always talking-always merry-eh,
Grip
The raven answered by an affectionate croak, and
hopping on his master's arm, which he held downward
for that purpose, submitted with an air of perfect indif-
ference to be fondled, and turned his restless, curious
eye, now upon Lord George, and now upon his man.
Lord George, biting his nails in a discomfited manner,
regarded Barnaby for some time in silence; then beckon-
ing to his servant, said:
* Come hither, John.”
John Grueby touched his hat, and came.
“ Have you ever seen this young man before?” his
master asked him, in a low voice.
“Twice, my lord,” said John. "I see him in the
crowd last night and Saturday.”
“Did-did it seem to you that his manner was at all
wild or strange?” Lord George demanded, faltering.
“Mad,” said John, with emphatic brevity.”
“And why do you think him mad, sir?” said his master,
speaking in a peevish tone. “Don't use that word too
freely. Why do you think him mad?”
“My lord,” John Grueby answered, “look at his dress,
look at his eyes, look at his restless way, hear him cry
“No Popery! Mad, my lord.”
“So because one man dresses unlike another,” returned
his angry master, glancing at himself, “and happens
to differ from other men in his carriage and manner,
and to advocate a great cause which the corrupt and
irreligious desert, he is to be accounted mad, is he?”
“Stark, staring, raving, roaring mad, my lord,”
returned the unmoved John.
“Do you say this to my face?” cried his master, turn-
ing sharply upon him.
* To any man, my lord, who asks me,” answered John.
“Mr. Gashford, I find, was right,” said Lord George;
“I thought him prejudiced, though I ought to have
known a man like him better than to have supposed it
possible!”
“I shall never have Mr. Gashford's good word, my
lord,” replied John, touching his hat respectfully, “and
I don't covet it."

“ You are an ill-conditioned, most ungrateful fellow,”
said Lord George: “a spy, for anything I know. Mr.
Gashford is perfectly correct, as I might have felt con-
vinced he was. I have done wrong to retain you in my
service. It is a tacit insult to him as my choice and
confidential friend to do so, remembering the cause you
sided with on the day he was maligned at Westminster.
You will leave me to-night-nay, as soon as we reach
home. The sooner the better."
“If it comes to that, I say so, too, my lord. Let Mr.
Gashford have his will. As to my being a spy, my lord,
you know me better than to believe it, I am sure. I
don't know much about causes. My cause is the cause
of one man against two hundred; and I hope it always
will be.”
“You have said quite enough,” returned Lord George,
motioning him to go back. “I desire to hear no more."
“If you'll let me add another word, my lord,”returned
John Grueby, “I'd give this silly fellow a caution not to
stay here by himself. The proclamation is in a good many
hands already, and it's well known that he was con-
cerned in the business it relates to. He had better get
to a place of safety if he can, poor creature.”
“You hear what this man says?" cried Lord George,
addressing Barnaby, who had looked on and wondered
while this dialogue passed. “He thinks you may be
afraid to remain upon your post, and are kept here per-
haps against your will. What do you say?"
“I think, young man,” said John, in explanation,
“that the soldiers may turn out and take you; and that
if they do, you will certainly be hung by the neck till
you're dead-dead-dead. And I think you'd better go
from here, as fast as you can. That's what I think.”
“He's a coward, Grip, a coward!” cried Barnaby, put-
ting the raven on the ground, and shouldering his staff.
“Let them come! Gordon forever! Let them come!"
“Ay!” said Lord George, “let them! Let us see who
will venture to attack a power like ours; the solemn
league of a whole people. This a madman! You have
said well, very well. I am proud to be the leader of
such men as you!”
Barnaby's heart swelled within his bosom as he heard
these words. He took Lord George's hand and carried
it to his lips; patted his horse's crest, as if the affection

455
and admiration he had conceived for the man extended
to the animal he rode; then unfurled his flag, and
proudly waving it, resumed his pacing up and down.
Lord George, with a kindling eye and glowing cheek,
took off his hat, and flourishing it above his head, bade
him exultingly farewell—then cantered off at a brisk
pace; after glancing angrily round to see that his serv-
ant followed. Honest John set spurs to his horse and
rode after his master, but not before he had again warned
Barnaby to retreat, with many significant gestures,
which indeed he continued to make, and Barnaby to
resist, until the windings of the road concealed them
from each other's view.
Left to himself again with a still higher sense of the
importance of his post, and stimulated to enthusiasm by
the special notice and encouragement of his leader, Bar-
naby walked to and fro in a delicious trance rather than
as a walking man. The sunshine which prevailed
around was in his mind. He had but one desire un-
gratified. If she could only see him now!
The day wore on; its heat was gently giving place to
the cool of evening; a light wind sprung up, fanning
his long hair, and making the banner rustle pleasantly
above his head. There was a freedom and freshness in
the sound and in the time which chimed exactly with
his mood. He was happier than ever.
He was leaning on his staff looking towards the de-
clining sun, and reflecting with a smile that he stood
sentinel at that moment over buried gold, when two or
three figures appeared in the distance, making towards
the house at a rapid pace, and motioning with their
hands as though they urged its inmates to retreat from
some approaching danger. As they drew nearer, they
became more earnest in their gestures; and they were
no sooner within hearing than the foremost among them
crịed that the soldiers were coming up.
At these words Barnaby furled his flag, and tied it
round the pole. His heart beat high while he did so,
but he had no more fear or thought of retreating than
the pole itself. The friendly stragglers hurried past
him, after giving him notice of his danger, and quickly
passed into the house, where the utmost confusion im-
mediately prevailed. As those within hastily closed the
windows and the doors, they urged him by looks and

signs to fly without loss of time, and called to him many
times to do so; but he only shook his head indignantly
in answer, and stood the firmer on his post. Finding
that he was not to be persuaded, they took care of them-
selves; and leaving the place with only one old woman
in it, speedily withdrew.
As yet there had been no symptom of the news hav-
ing any better foundation than in the fears of those
who brought it, but The Boot had not been deserted five
minutes when there appeared, coming across the fields,
a body of men who, it was easy to see, by the glitter of
their arms and ornaments in the sun, and by their
orderly and regular mode of advancing-for they came
on as one man-were soldiers. In a very little time,
Barnaby knew that they were a strong detachment of
the Foot Guards, having along with them two gentle-
men in private clothes, and a small party of Horse; the
latter brought up the rear, and were not in number more
than six or eight.
They advanced steadily; neither quickening their pace
as they came nearer, nor raising any cry, nor showing
the least emotion or anxiety. Though this was a matter
of course in the case of regular troops, even to Barnaby
there was something particularly impressive and discon-
certing in it to one accustomed to the noise and tumult
of an undisciplined mob. For all that, he stood his
ground not a whit the less resolutely, and looked on un-
dismayed.
Presently, they marched into the yard, and halted.
The commanding officer despatched a messenger to the
horsemen, one of whom came riding back. Some words
passed between them, and they glanced at Barnaby;
who well remembered the man he had unhorsed at
Westminster, and saw him now before his eyes. The
man being speedily dismissed, saluted, and rode back
to his comrades, who were drawn up apart at a short
distance.
The officer then gave the word to prime and load. The
heavy ringing of the musket-stocks upon the ground,
and the sharp and rapid rattling of the ramrods in their
barrels, were a kind of relief to Barnaby, deadly though
he knew the purport of such sounds to be. When this
was done, other commands were given, and the soldiers
instantaneously formed in a single file all round the

+
house and stables; completely encircling them in every
part, at a distance, perhaps, of some half-dozen yards;
at least that seemed in Barnaby's eyes to be about the
space left between himself and those who confronted
him. The horsemen remained drawn up by themselves
as before.
The two gentlemen in private clothes, who had kept
aloof, now rode forward, one on either side the officer.
The proclamation having been produced and read by one
of them, the officer called on Barnaby to surrender.
He made no answer, but stepping within the door,
before which he had kept guard, held his pole crosswise
to protect it. In the midst of a profound silence he was
again called upon to yield.
Still he offered no reply. Indeed he had enough to do
to run his eye backward and forward along the half-
dozen men who immediately fronted him, and settle
hurriedly within himself at which of them he would
strike first when they pressed on him. He caught the
eye of one in the centre, and resolved to hew that fellow
down, though he died for it.
Again there was a dead silence, and again the same
voice called upon him to deliver himself up.
Next moment he was back in the stable, dealing blows
about him like a madman. Two of the men lay stretched
at his feet, the one he had marked dropped first-he had
a thought for that, even in the hot blood and hurry of
the struggle. Another blow-another! Down, mastered,
wounded in the breast by a heavy blow from the butt-
end of a gun (he saw the weapon in the act of falling)
-breathless-and a prisoner.
An exclamation of surprise from the officer recalled
him, in some degree, to himself. He looked round.
Grip, after working in secret all the afternoon, and
with redoubled vigour while everybody's attention was
distracted, had plucked away the straw from Hugh's
bed, and turned up the loose ground with his iron bill.
The hole had been recklessly filled to the brim, and
was merely sprinkled with earth. Golden cups,
spoons, candlesticks, coined guineas-all the riches were
revealed.
They brought spades and a sack; dug up everything
that was hidden there; and carried away more than two
men could lift. They handcuffed him and bound his

. arms, searched him, and took away all he had. Nobody
questioned or reproached him, or seemed to have much
curiosity about him. The two men he had stunned were
carried off by their companions in the same business-
like way in which everything else was done. Finally,
he was left under a guard of four soldiers with fixed
bayonets, while the officer directed in person the search
of the house and the other buildings connected with it.
This was soon completed. The soldiers formed again
in the yard; he was marched out, with his guard about
him; and ordered to fall in where a space was left. The
others closed up all round, and so they moved away,
with the prisoner in the centre.
When they came into the streets, he felt he was a
sight; and looking up as they passed quickly along,
could see people running to the windows a little too late,
and throwing up the sashes to look after him. Some-
times he met a staring face beyond the heads above him,
or under the arms of his conductors, or peering down
upon him from a wagon-top or coach-box; but this was
all he saw, being surrounded by so many men. The
very noises of the streets seemed muffled and subdued:
and the air came stale and hot upon him, like the sickly
breath of an oven.
Tramp, tramp. Tramp, tramp. Heads erect, shoulders
square, every man stepping in exact time—all so orderly
and regular--nobody looking at him-nobody seeming
conscious of his presence-he could hardly believe he
was a prisoner. But at the word, though only thought,
not spoken, he felt the handcuffs galling his wrists, the
cord pressing his arms to his sides; the loaded guns
levelled at his head; and those cold, bright, sharp, shin-
ing points turned towards him; the mere looking down
at which, now that he was bound. and helpless, made
the warm current of his life run cold.

CHAPTER LVIII.
THEY were not long in reaching the barracks, for the
officer who commanded the party was desirous to avoid
rousing the people by the display of military force in the
streets, and was humanely anxious to give as little op-
portunity as possible for any attempt at rescue; know-
ing that it must lead to bloodshed and loss of life, and
that, if the civil authorities by whom he was accom-
panied empowered him to order his men to fire, many
innocent persons would probably fall, whom curiosity or
idleness had attracted to the spot. He therefore led the
party briskly on, avoiding with a merciful prudence the
more public and crowded thoroughfares, and pursuing
those which he dėemed least likely to be infested by
disorderly persons. This wise proceeding not only en-
abled them to gain their quarters without any interrup-
tion, but completely baffled a body of rioters who had
assembled in one of the main streets, through which it
was considered certain they would pass, and who re-
mained gathered together for the purpose of releasing
the prisoner from their hands, long after they had de-
posited him in a place of security, closed the barrack
gates, and set a double guard at every entrance for its
better protection.
Arrived at this place, poor Barnaby was marched into
a stone-floored room, where there was a very powerful
smell of tobacco, a strong, thorough draft of air, and a
great wooden bedstead, large enough for a score of men.
Several soldiers in undress were lounging about, or eat-
ing from tin cans; military accoutrements dangled on
rows of pegs along the whitewashed wall; and some
half-dozen men lay fast asleep upon their backs, snoring
in concert. After remaining here just long enough to
note these things, he was marched out again, and con-
veyed across the parade-ground to another portion of
the building..
Perhaps a man never sees so much at a glance as
when he is in a situation of extremity. The chances are
a hundred to one that if Barnaby had lounged in at the
gate to look about him, he would have lounged out

ed acThe dry; alding; the cin their shi
again with a very imperfect idea of the place, and would
have remembered very little about it. But as he was
taken handcuffed across the gravelled area, nothing
escaped his notice. The dry, arid look of the dusty
square, and of the bare brick building; the clothes hang-
ing at some of the windows; and the men in their shirt
sleeves and braces, lolling with half their bodies out of
the others; the green sun-blinds at the officers' quarters,
and the little scanty trees in front; the drummer-boys
practising in a distant courtyard; the men on drill on
the parade; the two soldiers carrying a basket between
them, who winked to each other as he went by, and slily
pointed to their throats; the spruce serjeant who hurried
past with a cane in his hand, and under his arm a
clasped book with a vellum cover; the fellows in the
ground-floor rooms, furbishing and brushing up their dif-
ferent articles of dress, who stopped to look at him, and
whose voices as they spoke together echoed loudly
through the empty galleries and passages—everything,
down to the stand of muskets before the guard-house,
and the drum with a pipe-clayed belt attached, in one
corner, impressed itself upon his observation, as though
he had noticed them in the same place a hundred times,
or had been a whole day among them, in place of one
brief, hurried minute.
He was taken into a small paved back yard, and there
they opened a great door, plated with iron, and pierced
some five feet above the ground with a few holes to let
in air and light. Into this dungeon he was walked
straightway; and having locked him up there, and
placed a sentry over him, they left him to his medi-
tations.
The cell, or black hole, for it had those words painted
on the door, was very dark, and having recently accom-
modated a drunken deserter, by no means clean.
Barnaby felt his way to some straw at the further end,
and looking towards the door, tried to accustom himself
to the gloom, which, coming from the bright sunshine
out of doors, was not an easy task.
There was a kind of portico or colonnade outside, and
this obstructed even the little light that at the best
could have found its way through the small apertures
in the door. The footsteps of the sentinel echoed mo-
notonously as he paced its stone pavement to and fro

461
(reminding Barnaby of the watch he had so lately kept
himself); and as he passed and repassed the door, he
made the cell for an instant so black by the interposition
of his body, that his going away again seemed like the
appearance of a new ray of light, and was quite a cir-
cumstance to look for.
When the prisoner had sat some time on the ground,
gazing at the chinks, and listening to the advancing
and receding footsteps of his guard, the man stood still
upon his post. Barnaby, quite unable to think or to
speculate on what would be done with him, had been
lulled into a kind of doze by his regular pace; but his
stopping roused him; and then he became aware that
two men were in conversation under the colonnade, and
very near the door of his cell.
How long they had been talking there he could not
tell, for he had fallen into an unconsciousness of his real
position, and when the footsteps ceased, was answering
aloud some question which seemed to have been put to
him by Hugh in the stable, though of the fancied pur-
port, either of question or reply, notwithstanding that
he awoke with the latter on his lips, he had no recollec-
tion whatever. The first words that reached his ears
were these:
“Why is he brought here, then, if he has to be taken
away again so soon?”
“Why, where would you have him go? Damme, he's
not as safe anywhere as among the king's troops, is he?
What would you do with him? Would you hand him
over to a pack of cowardly civilians, that shake in their
shoes till they wear the soles out, with trembling at the
threats of the ragamuffins he belongs to?"
“That's true enough.”
“True enough!—I'll tell you what. I wish, Tom
Green, that I was a commissioned instead of a non-com-
missioned officer, and that I had the command of
two companies — only two companies — of my own
regiment. Call me out to stop these riots—give me the
needful authority, and half-a-dozen rounds of ball
cartridge—”
“Ay!" said the other voice. " That's all very well,
but they won't give the needful authority. If the magis-
trate won't give the word, what's the officer to do?”
Not very well knowing, as it seemed, how to over-

come this difficulty, the other man contented himself
with damning the magistrates.
" With all my heart,” said his friend.
“Where's the use of a magistrate?" returned the other
voice. “What's a magistrate in this case, but an im-
pertinent, unnecessary, unconstitutional sort of inter-
ference? Here's a proclamation. Here's a man referred
to in that proclamation. Here's proof against him, and
a witness on the spot. Damme! Take him out and
shoot him, sir. Who wants a magistrate?”
“ When does he go before Sir John Fielding?" asked
the man who had spoken first.
“To-night at eight o'clock," returned the other.
“Mark what follows. The magistrate commits him to
Newgate. Our people take him to Newgate. The riot-
ers pelt our people. Our people retire before the rioters.
Stones are thrown, insults are offered, not a shot's fired.
Why? Because of the magistrates. Damn the magis-
trates!”
When he had in some degree relieved his mind by
cursing the magistrates in various other forms of speech,
the man was silent, save for a low growling, still having
reference to those authorities, which from time to time
escaped him.
Barnaby, who had wit enough to know that this con-
versation concerned, and very nearly concerned, himself,
remained perfectly quiet until they ceased to speak,
when he groped his way to the door, and peeping through
the air-holes, tried to make out what kind of men they
were to whom he had been listening.
The one who condemned the civil power in such strong
terms was a serjeant-engaged just then, as the stream-
ing ribands in his cap announced, on the recruiting
service. He stood leaning sideways against a pillar
nearly opposite the door, and as he growled to himself,
drew figures on the pavement with his cane. The other
man had his back towards the dungeon, and Barnaby
could only see his form. To judge from that, he was a
gallant, manly, handsome fellow, but he had lost his left
arm. It had been taken off between the elbow and the
shoulder, and his empty coat-sleeve hung across his
breast.
It was probably this circumstance which gave him an
interest beyond any that his companion could boast of,

463
and attracted Barnaby's attention. There was some-
thing soldierly in his bearing, and he wore a jaunty cap
and jacket. Perhaps he had been in the service at one
time or other. If he had, it could not have been very
long ago, for he was but a young fellow now.
"Well, well,” he said thoughtfully, “ let the fault be
where it may, it makes a man sorrowful to come back
to old England, and see her in this condition."
“I suppose the pigs will join 'em next,” said the
serjeant, with an imprecation on the rioters, “now that
the birds have set 'em the example.”
“The birds!” repeated Tom Green.
“Ah-birds,” said the serjeant testily; “that's English,
an't it?"
“I don't know what you mean.”
“Go to the guard-house, and see. You'll find a bird
there, that's got their cry as pat as any of 'em, and
bawls ‘No Popery,' like a man-or like a devil, as he
says he is. I shouldn't wonder. The devil's loose in
London somewhere. Damme if I wouldn't twist his
neck round, on the chance, if I had my way.”
The young man had taken two or three steps away,
as if to go and see this creature, when he was arrested
by the voice of Barnaby.
“It's mine,” he called out, half laughing and half
weeping—“my pet, my friend Grip. Ha, ha, ha! Don't
hurt him, he has done no harm. I taught him; it's my
fault. Let me have him, if you please. He's the only
friend I have left now. He'll not dance, or talk, or
whistle for you, I know; but he will for me, because he
knows me, and loves me—though you wouldn't think
it—very well. You wouldn't hurt a bird, I'm sure.
You're a brave soldier, sir, and wouldn't harm a woman
or a child—no, no, nor a poor bird, I'm certain."
This latter adjuration was addressed to the serjeant,
whom Barnaby judged from his red coat to be high in
office, and able to seal Grip's destiny by a word. But
that gentleman, in reply, surlily damned him for a thief
and rebel as he was, and with many disinterested impre-
cations on his own eyes, liver, blood, and body, assured
him that if it rested with him to decide, he would put a
final stopper on the bird, and his master too.
“You talk boldly to a caged man,” said Barnaby, in
anger. “If I was on the other side of the door and

there were none to part us, you'd change your note-ay,
you may toss your head-you would! Kill the bird-do.
Kill anything you can, and so revenge yourself on
those who with their bare hands untied could do as
much to you!”
Having vented his defiance, he flung himself into the
furthest corner of his prison, and muttering, “Good-bye,
Grip--good-bye, dear old Grip!” shed tears for the first
time since he had been a captive, and hid his face in
the straw.
He had had some fancy, at first, that the one-armed
man would help him, or would give him a kind word in
answer. He hardly knew why, but he hoped and thought
so. The young fellow had stopped when he called out,
and checking himself in the very act of turning round,
stood listening to every word he said. Perhaps he built
his feeble trust on this; perhaps on his being young and
having a frank and honest manner. However that
might be, he built on sand. The other went away
directly he had finished speaking, and neither answered
him, nor returned. No matter. They were all against
him here; he might have known as much. Good-bye,
old Grip, good-bye!
After some time, they came and unlocked the door,
and called to him to come out. He rose directly, and
complied, for he would not have them think he was sub-
dued or frightened. He walked out like a man, and
looked from face to face.
None of them returned his gaze or seemed to notice it.
They marched him back to the parade by the way they
had brought him, and there they halted, among a body
of soldiers, at least twice as numerous as that which had
taken him prisoner in the afternoon. The officer he had
seen before bade him in a few brief words take notice
that if he attempted to escape, no matter how favourable
a chance he might suppose he had, certain of the men
had orders to fire upon him that moment. They then
closed round him as before, and marched him off again.
In the same unbroken order they arrived at Bow
Street, followed and beset on all sides by a crowd which
was continually increasing. Here he was placed before
a blind gentleman, and asked if he wished to say any-
thing. Not he. What had he got to tell them? After
a very little talking, which he was careless of and quite

465
indifferent to, they told him he was to go to Newgate,
and took him away.
He went out into the street, so surrounded and hemmed
in on every side by soldiers, that he could see nothing;
but he knew there was a great crowd of people, by the
murmur; and that they were not friendly to the soldiers,
was soon rendered evident by their yells and hisses.
How often and how eagerly he listened for the voice of
Hugh! No. There was not a voice he knew among
them all. Was Hugh a prisoner too? Was there no hope?
As they came nearer and nearer to the prison, the
hootings of the people grew more violent; stones were
thrown; and every now and then a rush was made
against the soldiers, which they staggered under. One
of them, close before him, smarting under a blow upon
the temple, levelled his musket, but the officer struck it
upwards with his sword, and ordered him on peril of his
life to desist. This was the last thing he saw with any
distinctness, for directly afterwards he was tossed about,
and beaten to and fro, as though in a tempestuous sea.
But go where we would, there were the same guards
about him. Twice or thrice he was thrown down, and
so were they; but even then he could not elude their
vigilance for a moment. They were up again and had
closed about him before he, with his wrists so tightly
bound, could scramble to his feet. Fenced in, thus, he
felt himself hoisted to the top of a low flight of steps, and
then for a moment he caught a glimpse of the fighting
in the crowd, and of a few red coats sprinkled together,
here and there, struggling to rejoin their fellows. Next
moment, everything was dark and gloomy, and he was
standing in the prison lobby; the centre of a group of
men.
A smith was speedily in attendance, who riveted upon
him a set of heavy irons. Stumbling on as well as he
could, beneath the unusual burden of these fetters, he
was conducted to a strong stone cell, where, fastening
the door with locks, and bolts, and chains, they left him,
well secured; having first, unseen by him, thrust in
Grip, who, with his head drooping and his deep black
plumes rough and rumpled, appeared to comprehend
and to partake his master's fallen fortunes.

BARNABY RUDGE.
CHAPTER I.
It is necessary at this juncture to return to Hugh, who .
having, as we have seen, called to the rioters to disperse
from about the Warren, and meet again as usual, glided
back into the darkness from which he had emerged, and
reappeared no more that night.
He paused in the copse which sheltered him from the
observation of his mad companions, and waited to ascer-
tain whether they drew off at his bidding, or still lin-
gered and called to him to join them. Some few, he
saw, were indisposed to go away without him, and made
towards the spot where he stood concealed, as though
they were about to follow in his footsteps, and urge him
to come back; but these men, being in their turn called
to by their friends, and in truth not greatly caring to ven-
ture into the dark parts of the grounds, where they
might be easily surprised and taken, if any of the neigh-
bors or retainers of the family were watching them from
among the trees, soon abandoned the idea, and hastily
assembling such men as they found of their mind at the
moment, straggled off.
When he was satisfied that the great mass of the in-
surgents were imitating this example, and that the
ground was rapidly clearing, he plunged into the thick-
est portion of the little wood; and crashing the branches
as he went, made straight towards a distant light:
guided by that, and by the sullen glow of the fire be-
hind him.
As he drew nearer and nearer to the twinkling beacon
towards which he bent his course, the red glare of a few
torches began to reveal itself, and the voices of men
speaking together in a subdued tone, broke the silence,
which, save for a distant shouting now and then, already
prevailed. At length he cleared the wood, and, spring-

ing across a ditch, stood in a dark lane, where a small
body of ill-looking vagabonds, whom he had left there
some twenty minutes before, waited his coming with
impatience.
They were gathered round an old post-chaise or chariot,
driven by one of themselves, who sat postilion-wise upon
the near horse. The blinds were drawn up and Mr. Tap-
pertit and Dennis kept guard at the two windows. The
former assumed the command of the party, for he chal-
lenged Hugh as he advanced towards them; and when
he did so, those who were resting on the ground about
the carriage rose to their feet and clustered round him.
“Well!” said Simon, in a low voice; “is all right?"
“Right enough," replied Hugh, in the same tone.
“ They're dispersing now-had begun before I came
away.”
“Ănd is the coast clear?”
“Clear enough before our men, I take it," said Hugh.
“ There are not many who, knowing of their work over
yonder, will want to meddle with 'em to-night. Who's
got some drink here?”
Everybody had some plunder from the cellar; half a
dozen flasks and bottles were offered directly. He se-
lected the largest, and putting it to his mouth sent the
wine gurgling down his throat. Having emptied it, he
threw it down and stretched out his hand for another,
which he emptied likewise at a draught. Another was
given him, and this he half emptied too. Reserving
what remained to finish with, he asked:
“Have you got anything to eat, any of you? I'm as
ravenous as a hungry wolf. Which of you was in the
larder-come?"
“I was, brother,” said Dennis, pulling off his hat and
fumbling in the crown. “There's a matter of cold veni-
son pasty somewhere or other here, if that'll do?”
“Đo!” cried Hugh, seating himself on the pathway.
“Bring it out! Quick! Show a light here and gather
round! Let me sup in state, my lads! Ha, ha, ha!”
Entering into his boisterous humour, for they all had
drunk deeply, and were as wild as he, they crowded
about him, while two of their number who had torches
held them up, one on either side of him, that his banquet
might not be despatched in the dark. Mr. Dennis, hav.
ing by this time succeeded in extricating from his hat a

great mass of pasty, which had been wedged in so tightly
that it was not easily got out, put it before him; and
Hugh, having borrowed a notched and jagged knife
from one of the company, fell to work upon it vigourously.
“I should recommend you to swallow a little fire
every day, about an hour afore dinner, brother,” said
Dennis, after a pause. “It seems to agree with you, and
to stimulate your appetite."
Hugh looked at him, and at the blackened faces by
which he was surrounded, and, stopping for a moment
to flourish his knife above his head, answered with a
roar of laughter.
“Keep order there, will you?” said Simon Tappertit.
“Why, isn't a man allowed to regale himself, noble
captain," retorted his lieutenant, parting the men who
stood between them, with his knife, that he might see
him_" to regale himself a little bit, after such work as
mine? What a hard captain! What a strict captain!
What a tyrannical captain! Ha, ha, ha!”
“I wish one of you fellers would hold a bottle to his
mouth to keep him quiet," said Simon, “unless you
want the military to be down upon us.”
“And what if they are down upon us!" retorted Hugh.
“ Who cares? Who's afraid? Let 'em come, I say, let
'em come. The more, the merrier. Give me bold
Barnaby at my side, and we two will settle the military,
without troubling any of you. Barnaby's the man for
the military. Barnaby's health!"
But as the majority of those present were by no means
anxious for a second engagement that night, being
already weary and exhausted, they sided with Mr.
Tappertit, and pressed him to make haste with his sup-
per, for they had already delayed too long. Knowing,
even in the height of his frenzy, that they incurred great
danger by lingering so near the scene of the late out-
rages, Hugh made an end of his meal without more
remonstrance, and rising, stepped up to Mr. Tappertit
and smote him on the back.
“Now then,” he cried, “I'm ready. There are brave
birds inside this cage, eh? Delicate birds—tender, lov-
ing, little doves. I caged 'em-I caged 'em-one more
peep!”
He thrust the little man aside as he spoke, and mount-
ing on the steps which were half let down, pulled down

the blind by force, and stared into the chaise like an
ogre into his larder.
“Ha, ha, ha! and did you scratch, and pinch, and
struggle, pretty mistress?” he cried, as he grasped a
little hand that sought in vain to free itself from his
grip: “you, so bright-eyed, and cherry-lipped, and
daintily-made? But I love you better for it, mistress.
Ay, I do. You should stab me and welcome, so that it
pleased you, and you had to cure me afterwards. I
love to see you proud and scornful. It makes you hand-
somer than ever; and who so handsome as you at any
time, my pretty one!"
“Come!” said Mr. Tappertit, who had waited during
this speech with considerable impatience. “There's
enough of that. Come down.”
The little hand seconded this admonition by thrusting
Hugh's great head away with all its force, and drawing
up the blind, amidst his noisy laughter, and vows that
he must have another look, for the last glimpse of that
sweet face had provoked him past all bearing. How-
ever, as the suppressed impatience of the party now
broke out in open murmurs, he abandoned this design,
and taking his seat upon the bar, contented himself
with tapping at the front windows of the carriage, and
trying to steal a glance inside; Mr. Tappertit, mounting
the steps and hanging on by the door, issued his direc-
tions to the driver with a commanding voice and atti-
tude; the rest got up behind, or ran by the side of the
carriage, as they could; some, in imitation of Hugh,
endeavoured to see the face he had praised so highly,
and were reminded of their impertinence by hints from
the cudgel of Mr. Tappertit. Thus they pursued their
journey by circuitous and winding roads; preserving,
except when they halted to take breath, or to quarrel
about the best way of reaching London, pretty good
order and tolerable silence.
In the meantime, Dolly-beautiful, bewitching, cap-
tivating little Dolly-her hair dishevelled, her dress
torn, her dark eyelashes wet with tears, her bosom
heaving-her face, now pale with fear, now crimsoned
with indignation-her whole self a hundred times more
beautiful in this heightened aspect than ever she had
been before—vainly strove to comfort Emma Haredale,
and to impart to her the consolation of which she stood

in so much need herself. The soldiers were sure to come;
they must be rescued; it would be impossible to convey
them through the streets of London, when they set the
threats of their guards at defiance, and shrieked to the
passengers for help. If they did this, when they came
into the more frequented ways, she was certain-she
was quite certain—they must be released. So poor
Dolly said, and so poor Dolly tried to think; but the
invariable conclusion of all such arguments was, that
Dolly burst into tears; she cried, as she wrung her
hands, what would they do or think, or who would com-
fort them, at home, at the Golden Key; and sobbed most
piteously
Miss Haredale, whose feelings were usually of a
quieter kind than Dolly's, and not so much upon the
surface, was dreadfully alarmed, and indeed had only
just recovered from a swoon. She was very pale, and
the hand which Dolly held was quite cold; but she bade
her, nevertheless, remember that, under Providence,
much must depend upon their own discretion; that if
they remained quiet and lulled the vigilance of the
ruffians into whose hands they had fallen, the chances
of their being able to procure assistance when they
reached the town, were very much increased; that un-
less society were quite unhinged, a hot pursuit must be
immediately commenced; and that her uncle, she might
be sure, would never rest until he had found them out and
rescued them. But as she said these latter words, the
idea that he had fallen in a general massacre of the
Catholics that night--no very wild or improbable sup-
position, after what they had seen and undergone-
struck her dumb; and, lost in the horrors they had
witnessed, and those they might be yet reserved for,
she sat incapable of thought, or speech, or outward show
of grief: as rigid, and almost as white and cold, as
marble.
Oh, how many, many times, in that long ride, did
Dolly think of her old lover-poor, fond, slighted Joe!
How many, many times, did she recall that night when
she ran into his arms from the very man now projecting
his hateful gaze into the darkness where she sat, and
leering through the glass in monstrous admiration!
And when she thought of Joe, and what a brave fellow
he was, and how he would have rode boldly up, and

dashed in among these villains now, yes, though they
were double the number--and here she clenched her
little hand, and pressed her foot upon the ground the
pride she felt for a moment in having won his heart,
faded in a burst of tears, and she sobbed more bitterly
than ever.
As the night wore on, and they proceeded by ways
which were quite unknown to them—for they could
recognise none of the objects of which they sometimes
caught a hurried glimpse-their fears increased; nor
were they without good foundation; it was not difficult
for two beautiful young women to find, in their being
borne they knew not whither, by a band of daring villains
who eyed them as some among these fellows did, reasons
for the worst alarm. When they at last entered Lon-
don by a suburb with which they were wholly unac-
quainted, it was past midnight, and the streets were
dark and empty. Nor was this the worst, for the
carriage stopping in a lonely spot, Hugh suddenly
opened the door, jumped in, and took his seat between
them.
It was in vain they cried for help. He put his arm
about the neck of each, and swore to stifle them with
kisses if they were not as silent as the grave.
“I come here to keep you quiet,” he said, “and that's
the means I shall take. So don't be quiet, pretty mis-
tresses-make a noise-do-and I shall like it all the
better.”
They were proceeding at a rapid pace, and apparently
with fewer attendants than before, though it was so
dark (the torches being extinguished) that this was mere
conjecture. They shrunk from his touch, each into the
farthest corner of the carriage; but shrink as Dolly
would, his arm encircled her waist, and held her fast.
She neither cried nor spoke, for terror and disgust de-
prived her of the power; but she plucked at his hand as
though she would die in the effort to disengage herself:
and crouching on the ground, with her head averted and
held down, repelled him with a strength she wondered
at as much as he. The carriage stopped again.
“Lift this one out,” said Hugh to the man who opened
the door, as he took Miss Haredale's hand, and felt how
heavily it fell. “She's fainted.”
“So much the better,” growled Dennis-it was that

BARNABY RUDGE.
amiable gentleman. “She's quiet. I always like 'em to
faint, unless they're very tender and composed.”
“Can you take her by yourself?" asked Hugh.
“I don't know till I try. I ought to be able to; I've
lifted up a good many in my time," said the hangman.
“Up then! She's no small weight, brother; none of these
here fine gals are. Up again! Now we have her.”
Having by this time hoisted the young lady into his
arms, he staggered off with his burden.
“Look ye, pretty bird,” said Hugh, drawing Dolly
towards him. “Remember what I told you-a kiss for
every cry. Scream if you love me, darling. Scream
once, mistress. Pretty mistress, only once if you love me.”
Thrusting his face away with all her force, and hold-
ing down her head, Dolly submitted to be carried out of
the chaise, and borne after Miss Haredale into a miser-
able cottage, where Hugh, after hugging her to his
breast, set her gently down upon the floor.
Poor Dolly! do what she would she only looked the
better for it, and tempted them the more. When her
eyes flashed angrily, and her ripe lips slightly parted,
to give her rapid breathing vent, who could resist it?
When she wept and sobbed as though her heart would
break, and bemoaned her miseries in the sweetest voice
that ever fell upon a listener's ear, who could be insen-
sible to the little winning pettishness which now and
then displayed itself even in the sincerity and earnest-
ness of her grief? When, forgetful for a moment of
herself, as she was now, she fell on her knees beside her
friend, and bent over her, and laid her cheek to hers,
and put her arms about her, what mortal eyes could
have avoided wandering to the delicate bodice, the
streaming hair, the neglected dress, the perfect abandon-
ment and unconsciousness of the blooming little beauty?
Who could look on and see her lavish caresses and en-
dearments, and not desire to be in Emma Haredale's
place; to be either her or Dolly; either the hugging or
the hugged? Not Hugh. Not Dennis.
“I tell you what it is, young women,” said Mr. Dennis,
“I ain't much of a lady's man myself, nor am I a party
in the present business further than lending a willing
hand to my friends, but if I see much more of this here
sort of thing, I shall become a principal instead of an
accessory. I tell you candid.”


## p. 8 (#506) ##############################################

BARNABY RUDGE.
“Why have you brought us here?” said Emma. “Are
we to be murdered?"
“Murdered!” cried Dennis, sitting down upon a stool,
and regarding her with great favour. “Why, my dear,
who'd murder such chickabiddies as you? If you was
to ask me, now, whether you was brought here to be
married, there might be something in it."
And here he exchanged a grin with Hugh, who re-
moved his eyes from Dolly for the purpose.
“No, no,” said Dennis, “there'll be no murdering, my
pets. Nothing of that sort. Quite the contrairy.”
“You are an older man than your companion, sir,”
said Emma, trembling. “Have you no pity for us? Do
you not consider that we are women?"
"I do indeed, my dear,” retorted Dennis. "It would
be very hard not to, with two such specimens afore my
eyes. Ha, ha! Oh, yes, I consider that. We all con-
sider that, miss."
He shook his head waggishly, leered at Hugh again,
and laughed very much, as if he had said a noble thing,
and rather thought he was coming out.
“There'll be no murdering, my dear. Not a bit on it.
I tell you what, though, brother,” said Dennis, cocking
his hat for the convenience of scratching his head, and
looking gravely at Hugh, “it's worthy of notice, as a
proof of the amazing equalness and dignity of our law,
that it don't make no distinction between men and wo-
men. I've heerd the judge say, sometimes, to a highway-
man or housebreaker as had tied the ladies neck and heels
-you'll excuse me making mention of it, my darlings-
and put 'em in a cellar, that he showed no consideration
to women. Now, I say that there judge didn't know his
business, brother; and that if I had been that there
highwayman or housebreaker I should have made
answer: 'What are you a talking of, my lord? I showed
the women as much consideration as the law does, and
what more would you have me do? If you was to count
up in the newspapers the number of females as have
been worked off in this here city alone, in the last ten
year, said Mr. Dennis, thoughtfully, “ you'd be surprised
at the total-quite amazed, you would. There's a dig-
nified and equal thing; a beautiful thing! But we've no
security for it's lasting. Now that they've begun to
favour these here Papists, I shouldn't wonder if they

went and altered even that, one of these days. Upon
my soul, I shouldn't.”
This subject, perhaps from being of too exclusive and
professional a nature, failed to interest Hugh as much
as his friend had anticipated. But he had no time to
pursue it, for at this crisis Mr. Tappertit entered pre-
cipitately, at sight of whom Dolly uttered a scream of
joy, and fairly threw herself into his arms.
I knew it, I was sure of it!" cried Dolly. “My dear
father's at the door. Thank God, thank God! Bless
you, Sim. Heaven bless you for this!”
Simon Tappertit, who had at first implicitly believed
that the locksmith's daughter, unable any longer to
suppress her secret passion for himself, was about to
give it full vent in its intensity, and to declare that she
was his forever, looked extremely foolish when she
said these words—the more so, as they were received
by Hugh and Dennis with a loud laugh, which made
her draw back and regard him with a fixed and earnest
look.
“Miss Haredale,” said Sim, after a very awkward
silence, “I hope you're as comfortable as circumstances
will permit of. Dolly Varden, my darling–my own,
my lovely one-I hope you're pretty comfortable like-
wise."
Poor little Dolly! She saw how it was; hid her face
in her hands; and sobbed more bitterly than ever.
“You meet in me, Miss V.,” said Simon, laying his
hand upon his breast,“ not a 'prentice, not a workman,
not a slave, not a wictim of your father's tyrannical be-
haviour, but the leader of a great people, the captain of
a noble band, in which these gentlemen are, as I may
say, corporals and serjeants. You behold in me, not a
private individual, but a public character; not a mender
of locks, but a healer of the wounds of his unhappy
country. Dolly V., sweet Dolly V., for how many years
have I looked forward to this present meeting! For how
many years has it been my intention to exalt and ennoble
you! Í redeem it. Believe in me, your husband. Yes,
beautiful Dolly-charmer-enslaver-S. Tappertit is all
your own!”
As he said these words he advanced towards her.
Dolly retreated till she could go no farther, and then
sank down upon the floor. Thinking it very possible

that this might be maiden modesty, Simon essayed to
raise her; on which Dolly, goaded to desperation, wound
her hands in his hair, and crying out amidst her tears
that he was a dreadful little wretch, and always had
been, shook, and pulled, and beat him until he was fain
to call for help, most lustily. Hugh had never admired
her half so much as at that moment.
“She's in an excited state to-night,” said Simon, as he
smoothed his rumpled feathers, “and don't know when
she's well off. Let her be by herself till to-morrow, and
that'll bring her down a little. Carry her into the next
house!”
Hugh had her in his arms directly. It might be that
Mr. Tappertit's heart was really softened by her distress,
or it might be that he felt it in some degree indecorous
that his intended bride should be struggling in the grasp
of another man. He commanded him, on second
thoughts, to put her down again, and looked moodily on
as she flew to Miss Haredale's side, and clinging to her
dress, hid her flushed face in its folds.
“They shall remain here together till to-morrow,"
said Simon, who had now quite recovered his dignity-
“till to-morrow. Come away!"
“Ay!” cried Hugh. “Come away, captain. Ha, ha,
“What are you laughing at?" demanded Simon,
sternly.
“Nothing, captain, nothing,” Hugh rejoined, and as
he spoke, and clapped his hand upon the shoulder of the
little man, he laughed again, for some unknown reason,
with tenfold violence.
Mr. Tappertit surveyed him from head to foot with
lofty scorn (this only made him laugh the more), and
turning to the prisoners, said:
“You'll take notice, ladies, that this place is well
watched on every side, and that the least noise is cer.
tain to be attended with unpleasant consequences.
You'll hear-both of you—more of our intentions to-
morrow. In the meantime, don't show yourself at the
window, or appeal to any of the people you may see pass
it, for if you do it will be known directly that you come
from a Catholic house, and all the exertions our men can
make may not be able to save your lives."
With this last caution, which was true enough, he
ha!”

turned to the door, followed by Hugh and Dennis. They
paused for a moment, going out, to look at them clasped
in each other's arms, and then left the cottage; fasten-
ing the door, and setting a good watch upon it, and in-
deed all round the house.
“I say,” growled Dennis, as they walked away in
company, that's a dainty pair. Muster Gashford's
one is as handsome as the other, eh?”
“Hush!” said Hugh, hastily. “Don't you mention
names. It's a bad habit.”
“I wouldn't like to be him, then (as you don't like
names), when he breaks it out to her; that's all,” said
Dennis. “She's one of them fine, black-eyed, proud
gals, as I wouldn't trust at such times with a knife too
near 'em. I've seen some of that sort afore now. I re-
collect one that was worked off, many year ago and
there was a gentleman in that case too—that says to me,
with her lip a trembling, but her hand as steady as ever
I see one: Dennis, I'm near my end, but if I had a dag-
ger in these fingers, and he was within my reach, I'd
strike him dead afore me;-ah, she did-and she'd have
done it too!”
“Strike who dead?” demanded Hugh.
“How should I know, brother?" answered Dennis.
“She never said; not she.”
Hugh looked, for a moment, as though he would have
made some further inquiry into this incoherent recollec-
tion; but Simon Tappertit, who had been meditating
deeply, gave his thoughts a new direction. .
“Hugh!” said Sim. “You have done well to-day.
You shall be rewarded. So have you, Dennis. There's
no young woman you want to carry off, is there?”
“N-no," returned that gentleman, stroking his griz-
zled beard, which was some two inches long. “None in
partickler, I think.”
“Very good,” said Sim; “then we'll find some other
way of making it up to you. As to you, old boy”-he
turned to Hugh—"you shall have Miggs (her that I
promised you, you know) within three days. Mind, I
pass my word for it.”
Hugh thanked him heartily; and as he did so, his
laughing fit returned with such violence that he was
obliged to hold his side with one hand, and to lean with
the other on the shoulder of his small captain, without

whose support he would certainly have rolled upon the
ground.
CHAPTER II.
THE three worthies turned their faces towards The
Boot, with the intention of passing the night in that
place of rendezvous, and of seeking the repose they so
much needed in the shelter of their old den; for now that
the mischief and destruction they had purposed were
achieved, and their prisoners were safely bestowed for
the night, they began to be conscious of exhaustion, and
to feel the wasting effects of the madness which had
led to such deplorable results.
Notwithstanding the lassitude and fatigue which op-
pressed him now, in common with his two companions,
and indeed with all who had taken an active share in
that night's work, Hugh's boisterous merriment broke
out afresh whenever he looked at Simon Tappertit, and
vented itself—much to that gentleman's indignation-
in such shouts of laughter as bade fair to bring the watch
upon them, and involve them in a skirmish, to which in
their present worn-out condition they might prove by no
means equal. Even Mr. Dennis, who was not at all
particular on the score of gravity or dignity, and who
had a great relish for his young friend's eccentric
humours, took occasion to remonstrate with him on this
imprudent behaviour, which he held to be a species of
suicide, tantamount to a man's working himself off with-
out being overtaken by the law, than which he could
imagine nothing more ridiculous or impertinent.
Not abating one jot of his noisy mirth for these re-
monstrances, Hugh reeled along between them, having
an arm of each, until they hove in sight of The Boot,
and were within a field or two of that convenient tavern.
He happened by great good luck to have roared and
shouted himself into silence by this time. They were
proceeding onward without noise, when a scout who
had been creeping about the ditches all night, to warn
any stragglers from encroaching further on what was
now such dangerous ground, peeped cautiously from his
hiding-place, and called to them to stop.
“Stop! and why?” said Hugh.

Because (the scout replied) the house was filled with
constables and soldiers; having been surprised that
afternoon. The inmates had fled or been taken into
custody, he could not say which. He had prevented a
great many people from approaching nearer, and he be-
lieved they had gone to the markets and such places to
pass the night. He had seen the distant fires, but they
were all out now. He had heard the people who passed
and repassed, speaking of them too, and could report
that the prevailing opinion was one of apprehension and
dismay. He had not heard a word of Barnaby-didn't
even know his name—but it had been said in his hear-
ing that some man had been taken and carried off to
Newgate. Whether this was true or false he could not
affirm.
The three took counsel together, on hearing this, and
debated what it might be best to do. Hugh, deeming it
possible that Barnaby was in the hands of the soldiers,
and at that moment under detention at The Boot, was
for advancing stealthily, and firing the house; but his
companions, who objected to such rash measures unless
they had a crowd at their backs, represented that if
Barnaby were taken he had assuredly been removed to
a stronger prison; they would never have dreamed, he
said, of keeping him all night in a place so weak and
open to attack. Yielding to this reasoning, and to their
persuasions, Hugh consented to turn back, and to repair
to Fleet Market; for which place, it seemed, a few of
their boldest associates had shaped their course, on re-
ceiving the same intelligence.
Feeling their strength recruited and their spirits
roused, now that there was a new necessity for action,
they hurried away, quite forgetful of the fatigue under
which they had been sinking but a few minutes before;
and soon arrived at their place of destination.
Fleet Market, at that time, was a long, irregular row
of wooden sheds and pent-houses, occupying the centre
of what is now called Farringdon Street. They were
jumbled together in a most unsightly fashion, in the
middle of the road; to the great obstruction of the thor-
oughfare and the annoyance of passengers, who were
fain to make their way, as they best could, among carts,
baskets, barrows, trucks, casks, bulks, and benches,
and to jostle with porters, hucksters, wagoners, and a

motley crowd of buyers, sellers, pickpockets, vagrants,
and idlers. The air was perfumed with the stench of
rotten leaves and faded fruit; the refuse of the butchers'
stalls, and offal and garbage of a hundred kinds. It was
indispensable to most public conveniences in those days,
that they should be public nuisances likewise; and Fleet
Market maintained the principle to admiration.
To this place, perhaps because its sheds and baskets
were a tolerable substitute for beds, or perhaps because
it afforded the means of a hasty barricade in case of
need, many of the rioters had straggled not only that
night, but for two or three nights before. It was now
broad day, but the morning being cold, a group of them
were gathered round a fire in a public-house, drinking
hot purl, and smoking pipes, and planning new schemes
for to-morrow.
Hugh and his two friends being known to most of
these men, were received with signal marks of appro-
bation, and inducted into the most honourable seats.
The room-door was closed and fastened to keep intruders
at a distance, and then they proceeded to exchange
news.
“The soldiers have taken possession of The Boot,
I hear,” said Hugh. “Who knows anything about it?"
Several cried that they did; but the majority of the
company having been engaged in the assault upon the
Warren, and all present having been concerned in one
or other of the night's expeditions, it proved that they
knew no more than Hugh himself; having been merely
warned by each other, or by the scout, and knowing
nothing of their own knowledge.
“We left a man on guard there to-day,” said Hugh,
looking round him, “who is not here." You know who
it is-Barnaby, who brought the soldier down, at West-
minster. Has any man seen or heard of him?"
They shook their heads, and murmured an answer in
the negative, as each man looked round and appealed to
his fellow; when a noise was heard without, and a man
was heard to say that he wanted Hugh-that he must
see Hugh.
“He is but one man,” cried Hugh to those who kept
the door; “let him come in.”
“Ay, áy!" muttered the others. “Let him come in.
Let him come in."

The door was accordingly unlocked and opened.
A one-armed man, with his head and face tied up with
a bloody cloth, as though he had been severely beaten,
his clothes torn, and his remaining hand grasping a
thick stick, rushed in among them, and panting for
breath, demanded which was Hugh.
“Here he is,” replied the person he inquired for.
“I am Hugh. What do you want with me?"
“I have a message for you,” said the man. “You
know one Barnaby."
“ What of him? Did he send the message?"
“Yes. He's taken. He's in one of the strong cells
in Newgate. He defended himself as well as he could,
but was overpowered by numbers. That's his message.”
“When did you see him?" asked Hugh, hastily.
“On his way to prison, where he was taken by a
party of soldiers. They took a by-road, and not the one
we expected. I was one of the few who tried to rescue
him, and he called to me to tell Hugh where he was.
We made a good struggle, though it failed. Look
here!”
He pointed to his dress and to his bandaged head, and
still panting for breath, glanced round the room; then
faced towards Hugh again.
“I know you by sight,” he said, “ for I was in the
crowd on Friday, and on Saturday, and yesterday, but I
didn't know your name. You're a bold fellow, I know.
So is he. He fought like a lion to-night, but it was of no
use. I did my best, considering that I want this limb.”
Again he glanced inquisitively round the room-or
seemed to do so, for his face was nearly hidden by the
bandage-and again facing sharply towards Hugh,
grasped his stick as if he half expected to be set upon
and stood on the defensive.
If he had any such apprehension, however, he was
speedily reassured by the demeanour of all present.
None thought of the bearer of the tidings. He was lost
in the news he brought. Oaths, threats and execrations
were vented on all sides. Some cried that if they bore
this tamely another day would see them all in jail; some
that they should have rescued the other prisoners, and
this would not have happened. One man cried in a loud
voice, “ Who'll follow me to Newgate!" and there was a
loud shout and a general rush towards the door,

But Hugh and Dennis stood with their backs against
it and kept them back until the clamour had so far sub-
sided that their voices could be heard, when they called
to them together that to go now, in broad day, would be
madness; and that if they waited until night and ar-
ranged a plan of attack, they might release, not only
their own companions, but all the prisoners, and burn
down the jail.
“Not that jail alone,” cried Hugh, “but every jail in
London. They shall have no place to put their prisoners
in. We'll burn them all down; make bonfires of them
every one! Here!” he cried, catching at the hangman's
hand. “Let all who're men here join with us. Shake
hands upon it. Barnaby out of jail, and not a jail left
standing! Who joins?"
Every man there. And they swore a great oath to re-
lease their friends from Newgate next night; to force
the doors and burn the jail; or perish in the fire them.
selves.
CHAPTER III.
On that same night-events so crowd upon each other
in convulsed and distracted times, that more than the
stirring incidents of a whole life often become com-
pressed into the compass of four-and-twenty hours-on
that same night, Mr. Haredale, having strongly bound
his prisoner, with the assistance of the sexton, and
forced him to mount his horse, conducted him to Chig-
well; bent upon procuring a conveyance to London
from that place, and carrying him at once before a
Justice. The disturbed state of the town would be, he
knew, a sufficient reason for demanding the murderer's
committal to prison before day break, as no man could
answer for the security of any of the watch-houses or
ordinary places of detention; and to convey a prisoner
through the streets when the mob were again abroad,
would not only be a task of great danger and hazard,
but would be to challenge an attempt at rescue. Direct-
ing the sexton to lead the horse, he walked close by the
murderer's side, and in this order they reached the vil-
lage about the middle of the night.
The people were all awake and up, for they were fear-

ful of being burnt in their beds, and sought to comfort
and assure each other by watching in company. A few
of the stoutest-hearted were armed and gathered in a
body on the green. To these, who knew him well, Mr.
Haredale addressed himself, briefly narrating what had
happened, and beseeching them to aid in conveying the
criminal to London before the dawn of day.
But not a man among them dared to help him by so
much as the motion of a finger. The rioters, in their
passage through the village, had menaced with their
fiercest vengeance any person who should aid in ex-
tinguishing the fire, or render the least assistance to
him, or any Catholic whomsoever. Their threats ex-
tended to their lives and all that they possessed. They
were assembled for their own protection, and could not
endanger themselves by lending any aid to him. This
they told him, not without hesitation and regret, as they
kept aloof in the moonlight and glanced fearfully at the
ghostly rider, who, with his head drooping on his breast
and his hat slouched down upon his brow, neither moved
nor spoke.
Finding it impossible to persuade them, and indeed
hardly knowing how to do so after what they had seen
of the fury of the crowd, Mr. Haredale besought them
that at least they would leave him free to act for him-
self, and would suffer him to take the only chaise and
pair of horses that the place afforded. This was not
acceded to without some difficulty, but in the end they
told him to do what he would, and go away from them
in Heaven's name.
Leaving the sexton at the horse's bridle, he drew out
the chaise with his own hands, and would have har-
nessed the horses, but that the post-boy of the village-
a soft-hearted, good-for-nothing, vagabond kind of fel-
low-was moved by his earnestness and passion, and,
throwing down a pitchfork with which he was armed,
swore that the rioters might cut him into mince-meat if
they liked, but he would not stand by and see an honest
gentleman, who had done no wrong, reduced to such
extremity, without doing what he could to help him.
Mr. Haredale shook him warmly by the hand, and
thanked him from his heart. In five minutes' time the
chaise was ready, and this good scapegrace in his sad-
dle. The murderer was put inside, the blinds were

drawn up, the sexton took his seat upon the bar, Mr.
Haredale mounted his horse and rode close beside the
door; and so they started in the dead of night, and in
profound silence, for London.
The consternation was so extreme thateven the horses
which had escaped the flames at the Warren could find
no friends to shelter them. They passed them on the
road, browzing on the stunted grass; and the driver told
them that the poor beasts had wandered to the village
first, but had been driven away lest they should bring
the vengeance of the crowd on any of the inhabit-
ants.
Nor was this feeling confined to such small places
where the people were timid, ignorant and unprotected.
When they came near London they met in the grey
light of morning more than one poor Catholic family
who, terrified by the threats and warnings of their
neighbours, were quitting the city on foot, and who told
them they could hire no cart or horse for the removal of
their goods, and had been compelled to leave them be-
hind, at the mercy of the crowd. Near Mile-end they
passed a house, the master of which, a Catholic gentle-
man of small means, having hired a wagon to remove
his furniture by midnight, had had it all brought down
into the street to await the vehicle's arrival, and save
time in the packing. But the man with whom he made
the bargain, alarmed by the fires that night, and by the
sight of the rioters passing his door, had refused to keep
it: and the poor gentleman, with his wife and servant
and their little children, were sitting trembling among
their goods in the open street, dreading the arrival of
day and not knowing where to turn or what to do.
It was the same, they heard, with the public convey-
ances. The panic was so great that the mails and stage-
coaches were afraid to carry passengers who professed
the obnoxious religion. If the drivers knew them, or
they admitted that they held that creed, they would not
take them, no, though they offered large sums; and
yesterday, people had been afraid to recognise Catholic
acquaintance in the streets, lest they should be marked
by spies, and burnt out, as it was called, in consequence.
One mild old man-a priest, whose chapel was destroyed;
a very feeble, patient, inoffensive creature—who was
trudging away, alone, designing to walk some distance

from town, and then try his fortune with the coaches,
told Mr. Haredale that he feared' he might not find a
magistrate who would have the hardihood to commit a
prisoner to jail on his complaint. But notwithstanding
these discouraging accounts they went on, and reached
the Mansion House soon after sunrise.
Mr. Haredale threw himself from his horse, but he
had no need to knock at the door, for it was already
open, and there stood upon the step a portly old man,
with a very red, or rather purple face, who, with an
anxious expression of countenance, was remonstrating
with some unseen person up-stairs, while the porter
essayed to close the door by degrees and get rid of him.
With the intense impatience and excitement natural to
one in his condition, Mr. Haredale thrust himself for-
ward and was about to speak, when the fat old gentle-
man interposed:
“My good sir,” said he, “pray let me get an answer.
This is the sixth time I have been here. I was here five
times yesterday. My house is threatened with destruc-
tion. It is to be burned down to-night, and was to have
been last night, but they had other business on their
hands. Pray let me get an answer.”
“My good sir," returned Mr. Haredale, shaking his
head, “my house is burned to the ground. But Heaven
forbid that yours should be. Get your answer. Be
brief, in mercy to me.”
“Now, you hear this, my lord?” said the old gentle-
man, calling up the stairs, to where the skirt of a dress-
ing-gown fluttered on the landing-place. “Here is a
gentleman here, whose house was actually burnt down
last night.”
“Dear me, dear me," replied a testy voice, “I am
very sorry for it, but what am I to do? I can't build it
up again. The chief magistrate of the city can't go and
be a rebuilding of people's houses, my good sir. Stuff
and nonsense!”
“But the chief magistrate of the city can prevent
people's houses from having any need to be rebuilt, if
the chief magistrate's a man, and not a dummy-can't
he, my lord?” cried the old gentleman in a choleric
manner.
“You are disrespectable, sir,” said the Lord Mayor-
“ leastways, disrespectful, I mean,"

20
BARNABY RUDGE.
“Disrespectful, my lord!” returned the old gentleman.
“I was respectful five times yesterday. I can't be re-
spectful forever. Men can't stand on being respectful
when their houses are going to be burnt over their heads,
with them in 'em! What am I to do, my lord? Am I to
have any protection!”
“I told you yesterday, sir,” said the Lord Mavor,
“that you might have an alderman in your house, if
you could get one to come.”
“What the devil's the good of an alderman?” returned
the choleric old gentleman..
"“_To awe the crowd, sir,” said the Lord Mayor.
“Oh, Lord ha' mercy!" whimpered the old gentleman,
as he wiped his forehead in a state of ludicrous distress,
6. to think of sending an alderman to awe a crowd!
Why, my lord, if they were even so many babies, fed
on mother's milk, what do you think they would care
for an alderman! Will you come?"
“I!” said the Lord Mayor, most emphatically, “cer-
tainly not.”
“Then what,” returned the old gentleman, “what am
I to do? Am I a citizen of England? Am I to have the
benefit of the laws? Am I to have any return for the
King's taxes?”
“I don't know, I am sure,” said the Lord Mayor;
“what a pity it is you're a Catholic! Why couldn't you
be a Protestant, and then you wouldn't have got your-
self into such a mess, I'm sure I don't know what is to
be done.—There are great people at the bottom of these
riots. -Oh, dear me, what a thing it is to be a public
character!—You must look in again in the course of the
day.-Would a javelin-man do?-Or there's Philips, the
constable-he's disengaged-he's not very old for a
man at his time of life, except in his legs, and if you
put him up at a window he'd look quite young by candle-
light, and might frighten 'em very much. -Oh, dear-
well-we'll see about it.”
“Stop!” cried Mr. Haredale, pressing the door open as
the porter strove to shut it, and speaking rapidly. “My
Lord Mayor, I beg you not to go away. I have a man
here who committed a murder eight-and-twenty years
ago. Half-a-dozen words from me on oath will justify
you in committing him to prison, for re-examination; I
only seek, just now, to have him consigned to a place of

safety. The least delay may involve his being rescued
by the rioters.”
« Oh, dear me!” cried the Lord Mayor. “God bless
my soul-and body-oh, Lor!-well I!--there are great
people at the bottom of these riots, you know. You
really mustn't.”
“My lord,” said Mr. Haredale, “the murdered gentle-
man was my brother; I succeeded to his inheritance;
there were not wanting slanderous tongues at that time
to whisper that the guilt of this most foul and cruel deed
was mine—mine, who loved him, as he knows, in
heaven, dearly. The time has come, after all these
years of gloom and misery, for avenging him, and bring-
ing to light a crime so artful and so devilish that it has
no parallel. Every second's delay on your part loosens
this man's bloody hands again, and leads to his escape.
My lord, I charge you hear me, and despatch this mat-
ter on the instant."
“Oh, dear me!” cried the chief magistrate; “these
an't business hours, you know—I wonder at you-how
ungentlemanly it is of you—you mustn't-you really
mustn't. And suppose you are a Catholic too?”
“I am,” said Mr. Haredale.
“God bless my soul, I believe people turn Catholics
a' purpose to vex and worrit me," cried the Lord Mayor.
“I wish you wouldn't come here; they'll be setting the
Mansion House afire next, and we shall have you to
thank for it. You must lock your prisoner up, sir-give
him to a watchman--and-and call again at a proper
time. Then we'll see about it!”
Before Mr. Haredale could answer, the sharp closing
of a door and drawing of its bolts, gave notice that the
Lord Mayor had retreated to his bedroom, and that
further remonstrance would be unavailing. The two
clients retreated likewise, and the porter shut them out
into the street.
“That's the way he puts me off," said the old gentle-
man, “I can get no redress and no help. What are you
going to do, sir?”
“To try elsewhere,” answered Mr. Haredale, who was
by this time on horseback.
“I feel for you, I assure you-and well I may, for we
are in a common cause,” said the old gentleman. “I
may not have a house to offer you to-night; let me ten-

der it while I can. On second thoughts, though,” he
added, putting up a pocket-book he had produced while
speaking, “I'll not give you a card, for if it was found
upon you, it might get you into trouble. Langdale-
that's my name vintner and distiller-Holborn Hill-
you're heartily welcome, if you'll come.”
Mr. Haredale bowed and rode off, close beside the
chaise as before; determining to repair to the house of
Sir John Fielding, who had the reputation of being a
bold and active magistrate, and fully resolved, in case
the rioters should come upon them, to do execution on
the murderer with his own hands, rather than suffer
him to be released.
They arrived at the magistrate's dwelling, however,
without molestation (for the mob, as we have seen, were
then intent on deeper schemes), and knocked at the door.
As it had been pretty generally rumoured that Sir John
was proscribed by the rioters, a body of thief-takers had
been keeping watch in the house all night. To one of
them Mr. Haredale stated his business, which appearing
to the man of sufficient moment to warrant his arousing
the justice, procured him an immediate audience.
No time was lost in committing the murderer to New-
gate—then a new building, recently completed at a vast
expense, and considered to be of enormous strength.
The warrant being made out, three of the thief-takers
bound him afresh (he had been struggling, it seemed, in
the chaise, and had loosened his manacles); gagged him
lest they should meet with any of the mob, and he should
call to them for help; and seated themselves along with
him in the carriage. These men being all well armed,
made a formidable escort; but they drew up the blinds
again, as though the carriage were empty, and directed
Mr. Haredale to ride forward, that he might not attract
attention by seeming to belong to it.
The wisdom of this proceeding was sufficiently obvious,
for as they hurried through the city they passed among
several groups of men, who if they had not supposed the
chase to be quite empty, would certainly have stopped
it. But those within keeping quite close, and the driver
tarrying to be asked no questions, they reached the
prison without interruption, and, once there, had him
out, and safe within its gloomy walls, in a twinkling.
With eager eyes and strained attention, Mr. Haredale

saw him chained, and locked, and barred up in his cell.
Nay, when he had left the jail, and stood in the free
street, without, he felt the iron plates upon the doors,
with his hands, and drew them over the stone wall, to
assure himself that it was real; and to exult in its being
so strong, and rough, and cold. It was not until he
turned his back upon the jail, and glanced along the
empty streets, so lifeless and quiet in the bright morning,
that he felt the weight upon his heart; that he knew he
was tortured by anxiety for those he had left at home;
and that home itself was but another bead in the long
rosary of his regrets.
CHAPTER IV.
THE prisoner, left to himself, sat down upon his bed-
stead: and resting his elbows on his knees, and his chin
upon his hands, remained in that attitude for hours. It
would be hard to say of what nature his reflections
were. They had no distinctness, and, saving for some
flashes now and then, no reference to his condition or
the train of circumstances by which it had been brought
about. The cracks in the pavement of his cell, the
chinks in the wall where stone was joined to stone, the
bars in the window, the iron ring upon the floor-such
things as these, subsiding strangely into one another,
and awakening an indescribable kind of interest and
amusement, engrossed his whole mind; and although at
the bottom of his every thought there was an uneasy
sense of guilt, and dread of death, he felt no more than
that vague consciousness of it which a sleeper has of
pain. It pursues him through his dreams, gnaws at the
heart of all his fancied pleasures, robs the banquet of
its taste, music of its sweetness, makes happiness itself
unhappy, and yet is no bodily sensation, but a phantom
without shape, or form, or visible presence; pervading
everything, but having no existence; recognisable every-
where, but nowhere seen, or touched, or met with face
to face, until the sleep is past, and waking agony
returns.
After a long time, the door of his cell opened. He
looked up; saw the blind man enter; and relapsed into
his former position,

Guided by his breathing, the visitor advanced to where
he sat; and stopping beside him, and stretching out his
hand to assure himself that he was right, remained, for
a good space, silent.
*This is bad, Rudge. This is bad,” he said at length.
The prisoner shuffled with his feet upon the ground
in turning his body from him, but made no other
answer.
“How were you taken?” he asked. “And where?
You never told me more than half your secret. No
matter; I know it now. How was it and where, eh?”
he asked again, coming still nearer to him.
“ At Chigwell,” said the other.
“At Chigwell! How came you there?"
“Because I went there, to avoid the man I stumbled
on,” he answered. “Because I was chased and driven
there, by him and Fate. Because I was urged to go
there, by something stronger than my own will. When
I found him watching in the house she used to live in,
night after night, I knew I never could escape him-
never! and when I heard the bell”.
He shivered; muttered that it was very cold; paced
quickly up and down the narrow cell; and sitting down
again, fell into his old posture.
" You were saying,” said the blind man, after another
pause, “that when you heard the bell”
“Let it be, will you?” he retorted in a hurried voice.
“It hangs there yet.”
The blind man turned a wistful and inquisitive face
towards him, but he continued to speak, without
noticing him.
“I went to Chigwell, in search of the mob. I have
been so hunted and beset by this man, that I knew my
only hope of safety lay in joining them. They had
gone on before; I followed them when it left off.”
66 When what left off?”.
“ The bell. They had quitted the place. I hoped
that some of them might be still lingering among the
ruins, and was searching for them when I heard—” he
drew a long breath, and wiped his forehead with his
sleeve-“his voice.”
“Saying what?"
“No matter what. I don't know. I was then at the
foot of the turret, where I did the—”

* Ay,” said the blind man, nodding his head with per-
fect composure, “I understand.”
“I climbed the stair, or so much of it as was left;
meaning to hide till he had gone. But he heard me;
and followed almost as soon as I set foot upon the
ashes."
“ You might have hidden in the wall, and thrown him
down, or stabbed him," said the blind man.
Might I? Between that man and me was one who
led him on-I saw it, though he did not-and raised
above his head a bloody hand. It was in the room
above that he and I stood glaring at each other on the
night of the murder, and before he fell he raised his
hand like that, and fixed his eyes on me. I knew the
chase would end there.”
“You have a strong fancy,” said the blind man, with
a smile.
“Strengthen yours with blood, and see what it will
come to.”
He groaned and rocked himself, and, looking up for
the first time, said, in a low, hollow voice:
“Eight-and-twenty years! Eight-and-twenty years!
He has never changed in all that time, never grown
older, nor altered in the least degree. He has been be-
fore me in the dark night and the broad sunny day; in
the twilight, the moonlight, the sunlight, the light of
fire, and lamp, and candle; and in the deepest gloom.
Always the same! In company, in solitude, on land, on
shipboard; sometimes leaving me alone for months, and
sometimes always with me. I have seen him, at sea,
come gliding in the dead of night along the bright re-
flection of the moon in the calm water; and I have seen
him, on quays and market-places, with his hand uplifted,
towering, the centre of a busy crowd, unconscious of the
terrible form that had its silent stand among them.
Fancy! Are you real? Am I? Are these iron fetters
riveted on me by the smith's hammer, or are they
fancies I can shatter at a blow?"
The blind man listened in silence.
“Fancy! Do I fancy that I killed him? Do I fancy
that, as I left the chamber where he lay, I saw the face
of a man peeping from a dark door, who plainly showed
me by his fearful looks that he suspected what I had
done? Do I remember that I spoke fairly to him—that

I drew nearer-nearer yet with the hot knife .n my
sleeve? Do I fancy how he died? Did he stagger back
into the angle of the wall into which I had hemmed
him, and, bleeding inwardly, stand, not fall, a corpse
before me? Did I see him, for an instant, as I see you
now, erect and on his feet-but dead?”
The blind man, who knew that he had risen, motioned
him to sit down again upon his bedstead; but he took no
notice of the gesture.
“It was then I thought, for the first time, of fastening
the murder upon him. It was then I dressed him in my
clothes, and dragged him down the back-stairs to the
piece of water. Do I remember listening to the bubbles
that came rising up when I had rolled him in? Do I
remember wiping the water from my face, and, because
the body splashed it there, in its descent, feeling as if it
must be blood?
“Did I go home when I had done? And oh, my God!
how long it took to do! Did I stand before my wife and
tell her? Did I see her fall upon the ground; and, when
I stooped to raise her, did she thrust me back with a
force that cast me off as if I had been a child, staining
the hand with which she clasped my wrist? Is that
fancy?
6. Did she go down upon her knees and call on Heaven
to witness that she and her unborn child renounced me
from that hour; and did she, in words so solemn that
they turned me cold-me, fresh from the horrors my own
hands had made--warn ine to fly while there was time;
for though she would be siler. t, being my wretched wife,
she would not shelter me? Did I go forth that night,
abjured of God and man, and anchored deep in hell, to
wander at my cable's length about the earth, and surely
be drawn down at last?"
“Why did you return?" said the blind man.
“Why is blood red? I could no more help it than I
could live without breath. I struggled against the im-
pulse, but I was drawn back through every difficult and
adverse circumstance, as by a mighty engine. Nothing
could stop me. The day and hour were none of my
choice. Sleeping and waking I had been among the old
haunts for years—had visited my own grave. Why did
I come back? Because this jail was gaping for me, and
he stood beckoning at the door."

“ You were not known?" said the blind man.
“I was a man who had been twenty-two years dead.
No. I was not known.”
“You should have kept your secret better.”
“My secret? Mine? It was a secret any breath of
air could whisper at its will. The stars had it in their
twinkling, the water in its flowing, the leaves in their
rustling, the seasons in their return. It lurked in
strangers' faces and their voices. Everything had lips
on which it always trembled. My secret!”
“It was revealed by your own act, at any rate,” said
the blind man.
“ The act was not mine. I did it, but it was not mine.
I was forced at times to wander round, and round, and
round that spot. If you had chained me up when the
fit was on me, I should have broken away and gone
there. As truly as the loadstone draws iron towards it,
so he, lying at the bottom of his grave, could draw me
near him when he would. Was that fancy? Did I like
to go there, or did I strive and wrestle with the power
that forced me?"
The blind man shrugged his shoulders, and smiled in-
credulously. The prisoner again assumed his old atti-
tude, and for a long time both were mute.
“I suppose, then,” said his visitor, at length breaking
silence, “that you are penitent and resigned; that you
desire to make peace with everybody (in particular,
with your wife who has brought you to this); and that
you ask no greater favour than to be carried to Tyburn
as soon as possible? That being the case, I had better
take my leave. I am not good enough to be company
for you.”
“Have I not told you," said the other fiercely, “that
I have striven and wrestled with the power that brought
me here? Has my whole life, for eight-and-twenty
years, been one perpetual struggle and resistance, and
do you think I want to lie down and die? Do all men
shrink from death-I most of all!"
“That's better said. That's better spoken, Rudge-
but I'll not call you that again-than anything you
have said yet,” returned the blind man, speaking more
familiarly, and laying his hand upon his arm. “ Lookye
-I never killed a man myself, for I have never been
placed in a position that made it worth my while. Far-

ther, I am not an advocate for killing men, and I don't
think I should recommend it or like it—for it's very
hazardous—under any circumstances. But as you had
the misfortune to get into this trouble before I made
your acquaintance, and as you have been my companion,
and have been of use to me for a long time now, I
overlook that part of the matter, and am only anx-
ious that you shouldn't die unnecessarily. Now, I
do not consider that, at present, it is at all neces-
sary.”
"What else is left me?" returned the prisoner. “To
eat my way through these walls with my teeth?”
“Something easier than that,” returned his friend.
“Promise me that you will talk no more of these fancies
of yours-idle, foolish things, quite beneath a man-and
I'll tell you what I mean.”
“Tell me,” said the other. .
“Your worthy lady with the tender conscience; your
scrupulous, virtuous, punctilious, but not blindly af-
fectionate wife—”
“ What of her?”
“Is now in London.”
“A curse upon her, be she where she may!”
“ That's natural enough. If she had taken her annuity
as usual, you would not have been here, and we should
have been better off. But that's apart from the busi-
ness. She's in London. Scared, as I suppose, and have
no doubt, by my representation when I waited upon her,
that you were close at hand (which I, of course, urged
only as an inducement to compliance, knowing that she
was not pining to see you), she left that place, and
travelled up to London.”
" How do you know?'
“From my friend, the noble captain-the illustrious
general—the bladder, Mr. Tappertit. I learnt from him
the last time I saw him, which was yesterday, that your
son who is called Barnaby-not after his father I
suppose”
* Death! does that matter now!"
"_You are impatient,” said the blind man calmly;
“it's a good sign, and looks like life-that your son
Barnaby had been lured away from her by one of his
companions who knew him of old, at Chigwell; and
that he is now among the rioters.”

“And what is that to me? If father and son be hanged
together, what comfort shall I find in that?”
“Stay-stay, my friend,” returned the blind man, with
a cunning look, “you travel fast to journeys' ends.
Suppose I track my lady out, and say thus much: 'You
want your son, ma'am-good. I, knowing those who
tempt him to remain among them, can restore him to
you, ma'am-good. You must pay a price, ma'am, for
his restoration-good again. The price is small, and
easy to be paid-dear ma'am, that's best of all." "
“What mockery is this?”
“Very likely, she may reply in those words. “No
mockery at all,' I answer. “Madam, a person said to be
your husband (identity is difficult of proof after lapse of
many years) is in prison, his life in peril—the charge
against him, murder. Now, ma'am, your husband has
been dead a long, long time. The gentleman never can
be confounded with him, if you will have the goodness
to say a few words, on oath, as to when he died, and
how; and that this person (who I am told resembles him
in some degree) is no more he than I am. Such testi-
mony will set the question quite at rest. Pledge your-
self to me to give it, ma'am, and I will undertake to keep
your son (a fine lad) out of harm's way until you have
done this trifling service, when he shall be delivered up
to you, safe and sound. On the other hand, if you
decline to do so, I fear he will be betrayed, and handed
over to the law, which will assuredly sentence him to
suffer death. It is, in fact, a choice between his life and
death. If you refuse, he swings. If you comply, the
timber is not grown, nor the hemp sown, that shall do
him any harm.??
“There is a gleam of hope in this!” cried the prisoner.
“A gleam?” returned his friend, “a noon-blaze; a
full and glorious daylight. Hush! I hear the tread of
distant feet. Rely on me.”
“ When shall I hear mgre?”
“ As soon as I do. I should hope, to-morrow. They
are coming to say that our time for talk is over. I hear
the jingling of the keys. Not another word of this just
now, or they may overhear us.”
As he said these words the lock was turned, and one
of the prison turnkeys appearing at the door, announced
that it was time for visitors to leave the jail.

“ So soon!” said Stagg, meekly. “But it can't be
helped. Cheer up, friend. This mistake will soon be
set at rest, and then you are a man again! If this
charitable gentleman will lead a blind man (who has
nothing in return but prayers) to the prison-porch and
set him with his face towards the west, he will do a
worthy deed. Thank you, good sir. I thank you very
kindly.“
So saying, and pausing for an instant at the door to
turn his grinning face towards his friend, he departed.
When the officer had seen him to the porch, he returned,
and again unlocking and unbarring the door of the cell,
set it wide open, informing its inmate that he was at
liberty to walk in the adjacent yard, if he thought
proper, for an hour.
The prisoner answered with a sullen nod, and being
left alone again, sat brooding over what he had heard,
and pondering upon the hopes the recent conversation
had awakened; gazing abstractedly, the while he did
so, on the light without, and watching the shadows
thrown by one wall on another, and on the stone-paved
ground. It was a dull, square yard, made cold and
gloomy by high walls, and seeming to chill the very sun-
light. The stone, so bare, and rough, and obdurate,
filled even him with longing thoughts of meadow-land
and trees; and with a burning wish to be at liberty. As
he looked, he rose, and leaning against the door-post,
gazed up at the bright blue sky, smiling even on that
dreary home of crime. He seemed, for a moment, to
remember lying on his back in some sweet-scented
place, and gazing at it through moving branches, long
ago.
His attention was suddenly attracted by a clanking
sound-he knew what it was, for he had startled him-
self by making the same noise in walking to the door.
Presently a voice began to sing, and he saw the shadow
of a figure on the pavement. It stopped-was silent all
at once, as though the person for a moment had for-
gotten where he was, but soon remembered-and so,
with the same clanking noise, the shadow disappeared.
He walked out into the court and paced it to and fro;
startling the echoes, as he went, with the harsh jangling
of his fetters. There was a door near his, which, like
his, stood ajar.

He had not taken half-a-dozen turns up and down the
yard, when, standing still to observe this door, he heard
the clanking sound again. A face looked out of the
grated window-he saw it very dimly, for the cell was
dark and the bars were heavy-and directly afterwards
a man appeared, and came towards him.
For the sense of loneliness he had, he might have been
in jail a year. Made eager by the hope of companion-
ship, he quickened his pace, and hastened to meet the
man half way-
What was this! His son!
They stood face to face, staring at each other. He
shrinking and cowed, despite himself; Barnaby strug-
gling with his imperfect memory, and wondering where
he had seen that face before. He was not uncertain
long, for suddenly he laid hands upon him, and striving
to bear him to the ground, cried:
“Ah! I know! You are the robber!”
He said nothing in reply at first, but held down his
head, and struggled with him silently. Finding the
younger man too strong for him, he raised his face,
looked close into his eyes, and said:
“I am your father.”
God knows what magic the name had for his ears;
but Barnaby released his hold, fell back, and looked at
him aghast. Suddenly he sprang towards him, put his
arms about his neck, and pressed his head against his
cheek.
Yes, yes, he was; he was sure he was. But where
had he been so long, and why had he left his mother by
herself, or worse than by herself, with her poor foolish
boy? And had she really been as happy as they said.
And where was she? Was she near there? She was
not happy now, and he in jail. Ah, no.
Not a word was said in answer; but Grip croaked
loudly, and hopped about them, round and round, as if
inclosing them in a magic circle, and invoking all the
powers of mischief.

CHAPTER V.
DURING the whole of this day, every regiment in or
near the metropolis was on duty in one or other part of
the town; and the regulars and militia, in obedience to
the orders which were sent to every barrack and station
within twenty-four hours' journey, began to pour in by
all the roads. But the disturbances had attained to such
a formidable height, and the rioters had grown, with
impunity, to be so audacious, that the sight of this great
force, continually augmented by new arrivals, instead
of operating as a check, stimulated them to outrages of
greater hardihood than any they had yet committed;
and helped to kindle a flame in London, the like of
which had never been beheld, even in its ancient and
rebellious times.
All yesterday, and on this day likewise, the com-
mander-in-chief endeavoured to arouse the magistrates
to a sense of their duty, and in particular the Lord
Mayor, who was the faintest-hearted and most timid of
them all. With this object, .larg'e bodies of the soldiery
were several times despatched to the Mansion House to
await his orders; but as he could, by no threats or per-
suasions, be induced to give any, and as the men re-
mained in the open street, fruitlessly for any good pur-
pose, and thrivingly for a very bad one, these laudable
attempts did harm rather than good. For the crowd,
becoming speedily acquainted with the Lord Mayor's
temper, did not fail to take advantage of it by boasting
that even the civil authorities were opposed to the
Papists, and could not find it in their hearts to molest
those who were guilty of no other offence. These vaunts
they took care to make within the hearing of the soldiers;
and they, being naturally loth to quarrel with the people,
received their advances kindly enough; answering,
when they were asked if they desired to fire upon their
countrymen, “No, they would be damned if they did;"
and showing much honest simplicity and good-nature.
The feeling that the military were No Popery men, and
were ripe for disobeying orders and joining the mob,
soon became very prevalent in consequence, Rumours

of their disaffection, and of their leaning towards the
popular cause, spread from mouth to mouth with
astonishing rapidity; and whenever they were drawn
up idly in the streets or squares there was sure to be a
crowd about them, cheering, and shaking hands, and
treating them with a great show of confidence and
affection.
By this time the crowd was everywhere; all conceal-
ment and disguise were laid aside, and they pervaded
the whole town. If any man among them wanted
money, he had but to knock at the door of a dwelling-
house, or walk into a shop and demand it in the rioters'
name, and his demand was instantly complied with.
. The peaceable citizens being afraid to lay hands upon
them, singly and alone, it may be easily supposed that
when gathered together in bodies they were perfectly
secure from interruption. They assembled in the streets,
traversed them at their will and pleasure, and publicly
concerted their plans. Business was quite suspended;
the greater part of the shops were closed; most of the
houses displayed a blue flag in token of their adherence
to the popular side; and even the Jews in Houndsditch,
Whitechapel, and those quarters, wrote upon their doors
or window-shutters, “ This House is a True Protestant.”
The crowd was the law, and never was the law held in
greater dread, or more implicitly obeyed.
It was about six o'clock in the evening, when a vast
mob poured into Lincoln's Inn Fields by every avenue,
and divided-evidently in pursuance of a previous de-
sign-into several parties. It must not be understood
that this arrangement was known to the whole crowd,
but that it was the work of a few leaders, who, mingling
with the men as they came upon the ground, and calling
to them to fall into this or that party, effected it as
rapidly as if it had been determined on by a coun-
cil of the whole number and every man had known his
place.
It was perfectly notorious to the assemblage that the
largest body, which comprehended about two-thirds of
the whole, was designed for the attack on Newgate. It
comprehended all the rioters who had been conspicuous
in any of their former proceedings; all those whom they
recommended as daring hands and fit for the work; all.
those whose companions had been taken in the riots, and

a great number of people who were relatives or friends of
feions in the jail. This last class included not only the
most desperate and utterly abandoned villains in Lon-
don, but some who were comparatively innocent. There
was more than one woman there, disguised in man's
attire, and bent upon the rescue of a child or brother.
There were the two sons of a man who lay under sen-
tence of death, and who was to be executed along with
three others on the next day but one. There was a great
party of boys whose fellow-pickpockets were in the
prison; and at the skirts of all a score of miserable
women, outcasts from the world, seeking to release
some other fallen creature as miserable as them-
selves, or moved by a general sympathy perhaps —
God knows—with all who were without hope, and
wretched.
Old swords, and pistols without ball or powder, sledge
hammers, knives, axes, saws, and weapons pillaged
from the butchers' shops; a forest of iron bars and
wooden clubs; long ladders for scaling the walls, each
carried on the shoulders of a dozen men; lighted
torches; tow smeared with pitch, and tar, and brim-
stone; staves roughly plucked from fence and paling;
and even crutches taken from crippled beggars in the
streets; composed their arms. When all was ready,
Hugh and Dennis, with Simon Tappertit between them,
led the way. Roaring and chafing like an angry sea,
the crowd pressed after them.
Instead of going straight down Holborn to the jail, as
all expected, their leaders took the way to Clerkenwell,
and pouring down a quiet street, halted before a lock-
smith's house—the Golden Key.
“Beat at the door,” cried Hugh to the men about him.
“ We want one of his craft to-night. Beat it in, if no
one answers."
The shop was shut. Both door and shutters were of a
strong and sturdy kind, and they knocked without effect.
But the impatient crowd raising a cry of “Set fire to
the house!" and torches being passed to the front, an
upper window was thrown open, and the stout old
locksmith stood before them.
“What now, you villains!” he demanded. “Where
is my daughter?”
“Ask no questions of us, old man,” retorted Hugh,

waving his comrades to be silent, “but come down, and
bring the tools of your trade. We want you.”
“Want me!” cried the locksmith, glancing at the
regimental dress he wore. “Ay, and if some that
I could name possessed the hearts of mice, ye should
have had me long ago. Mark me, my lad-and you
about him do the same. There are a score among ye
whom I see now and know, who are dead men from
this hour. Begone! and rob an undertaker's while you
can! You'll want some coffins before long."
“Will you come down?” cried Hugh.
“Will you give me my daughter, ruffian?” cried the
locksmith.
“I know nothing of her,” Hugh rejoined. “Burn the
door!”
“Stop!” cried the locksmith, in a voice that made
them falter-presenting, as he spoke, a gun. “Let an
old man do that. You can spare him better.”
The young fellow who held the light, and who was
stooping down before the door, rose hastily at these
words and fell back. The locksmith ran his eye along
the upturned faces and kept the weapon levelled at the
threshold of his house. It had no other rest than his
shoulder, but was as steady as the house itself.
“Let the man who does it take heed to his prayers,”
he said firmly; “I warn him.”
Snatching a torch from one who stood near him, Hugh
was stepping forward with an oath, when he was ar-
rested by a shrill and piercing shriek, and, looking up-
wards, saw a fluttering garment on the house-top.
There was another shriek, and another, and then a
shrill voice cried, “Is Simmun below!” At the same
moment a lean neck was stretched over the parapet and
Miss Miggs, indistinctly seen in the gathering gloom of
evening, screeched in a frenzied manner, “Oh! dear
gentlemen, let me hear Simmuns's answer from his own
lips. Speak to me, Simmun. Speak to me!"
Mr. Tappertit, who was not at all flattered by this
compliment, looked up, and bidding her hold her peace,
ordered her to come down and open the door, for they
wanted her master and would take no denial.
“Oh, good gentlemen!” cried Miss Miggs. “Oh, my
own precious, precious Simmun—"
“Hold your nonsense, will you!" retorted Mr. Tap-

pertit; “and come down and open the door. G. Varden,
drop that gun or it will be worse for you."
"Don't mind his gun,” screamed Miggs. “Simmun
and gentlemen, I poured a mug of table-beer right down
the barrel.”
The crowd gave a loud shout, which was followed by a
roar of laughter.
“It wouldn't go off, not if you was to load it up to the
muzzle,” screamed Miggs. “Simmun and gentlemen,
I'm locked up in the front attic, through the little door on
the right hand when you think you've got to the very
top of the stairs—and up the flight of corner steps, be-
ing careful not to knock your heads against the rafters,
and not to tread on one side in case you should fall into the
two-pair bed-room through the lath and plasture, which
do not bear, but the contrairy. Simmun and gentlemen,
I've been locked up here for safety, but my endeavours
has always been, and always will be, to be on the right
side-the blessed side-and to prenounce the Pope of
Babylon, and all her in ward and her outward workings,
which is Pagin. My sentiments is of little consequences,
I know," cried Miggs, with additional shrillness, “for
my positions is but a servant, and as sich, of humilities,
still I gives expressions to my feelings, and places my
reliances on them which entertains my own opinions!”
Without taking much notice of these outpourings of
Miss Miggs after she had made her first announcement
in relation to the gun, the crowd raised a ladder against
the window where the locksmith stood, and notwith-
standing that he closed, and fastened, and defended it
manfully, soon forced an entrance by shivering the
glass and breaking in the frames. After dealing a few
stout blows about him, he found himself defenceless, in
the midst of a furious crowd, which overflowed the
room and softened off in a confused heap of faces at the
door and window.
They were very wrathful with him (for he had
wounded two men), and even called out to those in front
to bring him forth and hang him on a lamp-post. But
Gabriel was quite undaunted, and looked from Hugh
and Dennis, who held him by either arm, to Simon
Tappertit, who confronted him.
6* You have robbed me of my daughter,” said the
locksmith, “who is far dearer to me than my life; and

you may take my life, if you will. I bless God that I
have been enabled to keep my wife free of this scene;
and that he has made me a man who will not ask mercy
at such hands as yours.”
"And a werry game old gentleman you are,” said Mr.
Dennis approvingly; " and you express yourself like a
man. What's the odds, brother, whether it's a lamp-
post to-night, or a feather-bed ten year to come, eh?”
The locksmith glanced at him disdainfully, but re-
turned no other answer.
“For my part,” said the hangman, who particularly
favoured the lamp-post suggestion, “I honour your
principles. They're mine exactly. In such sentiments
as them," and here he emphasised his discourse with an
oath, “ I'm ready to meet you or any man half-way.
Have you got a bit of cord anywheres handy? Don't
put yourself out of the way, if you haven't. “A hand-
kecher will do."
“Don't be a fool, master,” whispered Hugh, seizing
Varden roughly by the shoulder; "but do as you're bid.
You'll soon hear what you're wanted for. Do it!"
“ I'll do nothing at your request, or that of any
scoundrel here,” returned the locksmith. “If you want
any service from me, you may spare yourselves the pains
of telling me what it is. I tell you, beforehand, I'll do
nothing for you.”
Mr. Dennis was so affected by this constancy on the
part of the staunch old man that he protested-almost
with tears in his eyes—that to baulk his inclinations
would be an act of cruelty and hard dealing to which
he, for one, never could reconcile his conscience. The
gentleman, he said, had avowed in so many words that
he was ready for working off; such being the case, he
considered it their duty, as a civilised and enlightened
crowd, to work him off. It was not often, he observed,
that they had it in their power to accommodate them-
selves to the wishes of those from whom they had the
misfortune to differ. Having now found an individual
who expressed a desire which they could reasonably in-
dulge (and for himself he was free to confess that in
his opinion that desire did honour to his feelings), he
hoped they would decide to accede to his proposition
before going any further. It was an experiment which,
skilfully and dexterously performed, would be over in

five minutes, with great comfort and satisfaction to all
parties; and though it did not become him (Mr. Dennis)
to speak well of himself, he trusted he might be allowed
to say that he had practical knowledge of the subject,
and, being naturally of an obliging and friendly dispo-
sition, would work the gentleman off with a deal of
pleasure.
These remarks, which were addressed in the midst of
a frightful din and turmoil to those immediately about
him, were received with great favour; not so much,
perhaps, because of the hangman's eloquence, as on ac-
count of the locksmith's obstinacy. Gabriel was in im-
minent peril, and he knew it; but he preserved a steady
silence; and would have done so if they had been
debating whether they should roast him at a slow
fire.
As the hangman spoke there was some stir and con-
fusion on the ladder; and directly he was silent-so im-
mediately upon his holding his peace that the crowd
below had no time to learn what he had been saying, or
to shout in response-some one at the window cried:
“ He has a grey head. He is an old man. Don't hurt
him!”
The locksmith turned, with a start, towards the place
from which the words had come, and looked hurriedly
at the people who were hanging on the ladder and cling-
ing to each other.
“Pay no respect to my grey hair, young man,” he
said, answering the voice and not any one he saw. “I
don't ask it. My heart is green enough to scorn and
despise every man among you, band of robbers that you
are!"
This incautious speech by no means tended to appease
the ferocity of the crowd. They cried again to have him
brought out; and it would have gone hard with the hon-
est locksmith, but that Hugh reminded them, in answer,
that they wanted his services, and must have them.
“So, tell him what we want,” he said to Simon Tap-
pertit, “and quickly. And open your ears, master, if
you would ever use them after to-night.”
Gabriel folded his arms, which were now at liberty,
and eyed his old 'prentice in silence.
“Lookye, Varden,” said Sim, “ we're bound for New-
gate.”

“I know you are," returned the locksmith. “You
never said a truer word than that.”
“To burn it down, I mean," said Simon, “and force
the gates, and set the prisoners at liberty. You helped
to make the lock of the great door."
“I did,” said the locksmith. “You owe me no thanks
for that--as you'll find before long.”
“Maybe," returned his journeyman, “but you must
show us how to force it.”
“Must I!”
“Yes; for you know, and I don't You must come
along with us, and pick it with your own hands.".
“When I do," said the locksmith quietly, “my hands
shall drop off at the wrists, and you shall wear them,
Simon Tappertit, on your shoulders for epaulettes."
“We'll see that,” cried Hugh, interposing, as the in-
dignation of the crowd again burst forth. “You fill a
basket with the tools he'll want, while I bring him down
stairs. Open the doors below, some of you. And light
the great captain, others! Is there no business afoot, my
lads, that you can do nothing but stand and grumble?”
They looked at one another, and quickly dispersing,
swarmed over the house, plundering and breaking, ac-
cording to their custom, and carrying off such articles
of value as happened to please their fancy. They had
no great length of time for these proceedings, for the
basket of tools was soon prepared and slung over a man's
shoulders. The preparations being now completed, and
everything ready for the attack, those who were pillag-
ing and destroying in the other rooms were called down
to the workshop. They were about to issue forth, when
the man who had been last up stairs stepped forward,
and asked if the young woman in the garret (who was
making a terrible noise, he said, and kept on screaming
without the least cessation) was to be released?
For his own part, Simon Tappertit would certainly
have replied in the negative, but the mass of his com-
panions, mindful of the good service she had done in the
matter of the gun, being of a different opinion, he had
nothing for it but to answer yes. The man, accord-
ingly, went back again to the rescue, and presently re-
turned with Miss Miggs, limp and doubled up, and very
damp from much weeping.
As the young lady had given no tokens of conscious-
theing of breakbersing

ness on their way down stairs, the bearer reported her
either dead or dying; and being at some loss what to do
with her, was looking round for a convenient bench or
heap of ashes on which to place her senseless form,
when she suddenly came upon her feet by some mys-
terious means, thrust back her hair, stared wildly at Mr.
Tappertit, cried, “My Simmuns's life is not a wictim,"
and dropped into his arms with such promptitude that
he staggered and reeled some paces back beneath his
lovely burden.
"Oh, bother!” said Mr. Tappertit. “Here. Catch hold
of her, somebody. Lock her up again; she never ought
to have been let out.”
“My Simmun!” cried Miss Miggs, in tears, and faintly.
“My forever, ever blessed Simmun!”
“Hold up, will you,” said Mr. Tappertit, in a very un-
responsive tone, “I'll let you fall if you don't. What
are you sliding your feet off the ground for?”
“My angel Simmuns!” murmured Miggs—he pro-
mised”
“Promised! Well, and I'll keep my promise,” an-
swered Simon, testily. I mean to provide for you, don't
I? Stand up!”
“Where am I to go?” What is to become of me after
my actions of this night!” cried Miggs. “What resting-
places now remains but in the silent tombses!"
“I wish you was in the silent tombses, I do," cried Mr.
Tappertit, “and boxed up tight, in a good strong one.
Here,” he cried to one of the bystanders, in whose ear
he whispered for a moment: "Take her off, will you.
You understand where?”
The fellow nodded; and taking her in his arms, not-
withstanding her broken protestations, and her strug-
gles (which latter species of opposition, involving
scratches, was much more difficult of resistance), car-
ried her away. They who were in the house poured out
into the street; the locksmith was taken to the head of
the crowd, and required to walk between his two con-
ductors; the whole body was put in rapid motion; and
without any shouting or noise they bore down straight
on Newgate, and halted in a dense mass before the
prison gate,

CHAPTER VI.
BREAKING the silence they had hitherto preserved, they
raised a great cry as soon as they were ranged before
the jail, and demanded to speak with the governor.
Their visit was not wholly unexpected, for his house,
which fronted the street, was strongly barricaded, the
wicket-gate of the prison was closed up, and at no loop-
hole or grating was any person to be seen. Before they
had repeated their summons many times, a man ap-
peared upon the roof of the governor's house, and asked
what it was they wanted.
Some said one thing, some another, and some only
groaned and hissed. It being now nearly dark, and the
house high, many persons in the throng were not aware
that any one had come to answer them, and continued
their clamour until the intelligence was gradually dif-
fused through the whole concourse. Ten minutes or
more elapsed before any one voice could be heard with
tolerable distinctness; during which interval the figure
remained perched alone, against the summer-evening
sky, looking down into the troubled street.
“Are you,” said Hugh at length, “Mr. Akerman, the
head jailer here?”
“Of course he is, brother," whispered Dennis. But
Hugh, without minding him, took his answer from the
man himself.
“Yes,” he said. “I am.”
“You have got some friends of ours in your custody,
master.”
“I have a good many people in my custody." He
glanced downward, as he spoke, into the jail: and the
feeling that he could see into the different yards, and
that he overlooked everything which was hidden from
their view by the rugged walls, so lashed and goaded
the mob that they howled like wolves.
“Deliver up our friends," said Hugh, “and you may
keep the rest."
"It's my duty to keep them all. I shall do my duty.”
“If you don't throw the doors open, we shall break
'em down,” said Hugh; “ for we'll have the rioters out.”

“All I can do, good people,” Akerman replied, “is to
exhort you to disperse; and to remind you that the con-
sequences of any disturbances in this place will be very
severe, and bitterly repented by most of you, when it is
too late."
He made as though he would retire when he had said
these words, but he was checked by the voice of the
locksmith.
“Mr. Akerman,” cried Gabriel, “Mr. Akerman.”
“I will hear no more from any of you,” replied the
governor, turning towards the speaker, and waving his
hand.
“But I am not one of them,” said Gabriel. “I am an
honest man, Mr. Akerman; a respectable tradesman-
Gabriel Varden, the locksmith. You know me?"
“You among the crowd!” cried the governor in an
altered voice.
“Brought here by force-brought here to pick the
lock of the great door for them,” rejoined the locksmith.
“Bear witness for me, Mr Akerman, that I refuse to do
it; and that I will not do it, come what may of my re-
fusal. If any violence is done to me, please to re-
member this."
“Is there no way of helping you?” said the governor.
“ None, Mr. Akerman. You'll do your duty, and I'll
do mine. Once again, you robbers and cut-throats,"
said the locksmith, turning round upon them, “ I refuse.
Ah! Howl till you’re hoarse. I refuse.”
“Stay-stay!" said the jailer, hastily. “Mr. Varden,
I know you for a worthy man, and one who would do
no unlawful act except upon compulsion,”
"Upon compulsion, sir," interposed the locksmith, who
felt that the tone in which this was said conveyed the
speaker's impression that he had ample excuse for yield-
ing to the furious multitude who beset and hemmed him
in on every side, and among whom he stood an old man,
quite alone; “ upon compulsion, sir, I'll do nothing."
“Where is that man;" said the keeper, anxiously,
“who spoke to me just now?"
“Here!” Hugh replied.
“Do you know what the guilt of murder is, and that
by keeping that honest tradesman at your side you en-
danger his life!”
“ We know it very well,” he answered, "for what

else did we bring him here? Let's have our friends,
master, and you shall have your friend. Is that fair,
lads?”
The mob replied to him with a loud hurrah!
“You see how it is, sir?” cried Varden. “Keep 'em
out, in King George's name. Remember what I have
said. Good-night!"
There was no more parley. A shower of stones and
other missiles compelled the keeper of the jail to retire;
and the mob, pressing on, and swarming round the
walls, forced Gabriel Varden close up to the door.
In vain the basket of tools was laid upon the ground
before him, and he was urged in turn by promises, by
blows, by offers of reward, and threats of instant death,
to do the office for which they had brought him there.
“No,” cried the sturdy locksmith, “I will not!”
He had never loved his life so well as then, but noth-
ing could move him. The savage faces that glared upon
him, look where he would; the cries of those who
thirsted, like wild animals, for his blood; the sight of
men pressing forward, and trampling down their fellows,
as they strove to reach him, and struck at him above
the heads of other men, with axes and with iron bars;
all failed to daunt him. He looked from man to man,
and face to face, and still, with quickening breath and
lessening colour, cried firmly, “I will not!"
Dennis dealt him a blow upon the face which felled
him to the ground. He sprang up again like a man in
the prime of life, and with blood upon his forehead,
caught him by the throat.
"You cowardly dog!” he said; “ give me my daughter.
Give me my daughter.”
They struggled together. Some cried - kill him," and
some (but they were not near enough) strove to trample
him to death. Tug as he would at the old man's wrists,
the hangman could not force him to unclench his hands.
“Is this all the return you make me, you ungrateful
monster?” he articulated with great difficulty, and with
many oaths.
“Give me my daughter!” cried the locksmith, who
was now as fierce as those who gathered round him;
“ give me my daughter!”
He was down again, and up, and down once more,
and buffeting with a score of them, who bandied him

from hand to hand, when one tall fellow, fresh from a
slaughter-house, whose dress and great thigh-boots
smoked hot with grease and blood, raised a pole-axe,
and swearing a horrible oath, aimed it at the old man's
uncovered head. At that instant, and in the very act,
he fell himself as if struck by lightning, and over his
body a one-armed man came darting to the locksmith's
side. Another man was with him, and both caught the
locksmith roughly in their grasp.
“Leave him to us!" they cried to Hugh-struggling,
as they spoke, to force a passage backward through the
crowd. “Leave him to us. Why do you waste your
whole strength on such as he, when a couple of men can
finish him in as many minutes! You lose time. Re-
member the prisoners! remember Barnaby!”
The cry ran through the mob. Hammers began to
rattle on the walls; and every man strove to reach the
prison, and be among the foremost rank. Fighting
their way through the press and struggle, as desperately
as if they were in the midst of enemies rather than their
own friends, the two men retreated with the locksmith
between them, and dragged him through the very heart
of the concourse.
And now the strokes began to fall like hail upon the
gate, and on the strong building; for those who could
not reach the door spent their fierce rage on anything-
even on the great blocks of stone, which shivered their
weapons into fragments, and made their hands and arms
to tingle as if the walls were active in their stout re-
sistance, and dealt them back their blows. The clash
of iron ringing upon iron mingled with the deafening
tumult and sounded high above it, as the great sledge-
hammers rattled on the nailed and plated door: the
sparks flew off in showers; men worked in gangs, and
at short intervals relieved each other, that all their
strength might be devoted to the work; but there stood
the portal still, as grim and dark and strong as ever,
and, saving for the dints upon its battered surface, quite
unchanged.
While some brought all their energies to bear upon
this toilsome task; and some, rearing ladders against
the prison, tried to clamber. to the summit of the walls
they were too short to scale; and some again engaged a
body of police a hundred strong, and beat them back

and trod them under foot by force of numbers; others
besieged the house on which the jailer had appeared,
and, driving in the door, brought out his furniture and
piled it up against the prison gate, to make a bonfire
which should burn it down. As soon as this device was
understood, all those who had laboured hitherto cast
down their tools and helped to swell the heap, which
reached half-way across the street, and was so high that
those who threw more fuel on the top got up by ladders.
When all the keeper's goods were flung upon this costly
pile, to the last fragment, they smeared it with the pitch
and tar and rosin they had brought, and sprinkled it
with turpentine. To all the woodwork round the prison
doors they did the like, leaving not a joist or beam un-
touched. This infernal christening performed, they fired
the pile with lighted matches and with blazing tow, and
then stood by, awaiting the result.
The furniture being very dry, and rendered more com-
bustible by wax and oil, besides the arts they had used,
took fire at once. The flames roared high and fiercely,
blackening the prison wall, and twining up its lofty
front like burning serpents. At first, they crowded
round the blaze, and vented their exultation only in
their looks; but when it grew hotter and fiercer—when
it crackled, leaped, and roared, like a great furnace-
when it shone upon the opposite houses, and lighted up
not only the pale and wondering faces at the windows,
but the inmost corners of each habitation-when
through the deep red heat and glow, the fire was seen
sporting and toying with the door, now clinging to its
obdurate surface, now gliding off with fierce inconstancy
and soaring high into the sky, anon returning to fold it
in its burning grasp and lure it to its ruin—when it
shone and gleamed so brightly that the church clock of
St. Sepulchre's, so often pointing to the hour of death,
was legible as in broad day, and the vane upon its
steeple-top glittered in the unwonted light like some-
thing richly jewelled—when blackened stone and sombre
brick grew ruddy in the deep reflection, and windows
shone like burnished gold, dotting the longest distance
in the fiery vista with their specks of brightness—when
wall and tower, and roof and chimney-stack, seemed
drunk, and in the flickering glare appeared to reel and
stagger-when scores of objects, never seen before,

burst out upon the view, and things the most familiar
put on some new aspect—then the mob began to join
the whirl, and with loud yells, and shouts, and clamour,
such as happily is seldom heard, bestirred themselves to
feed the fire, and keep it at its height.
Although the heat was so intense that the paint on
the houses over against the prison parched and crackled
up, and swelling into boils as it were, from excess of
torture, broke and crumbled away; although the glass
fell from the window-sashes, and the lead and iron on
the roofs blistered the incautious hand that touched
them, and the sparrows in the eaves took wing, and
rendered giddy by the smoke, fell fluttering down upon
the blazing pile; still the fire was tended unceasingly by
busy hands, and round it men were going always. They
never slackened in their zeal, or kept aloof, but pressed
upon the flames so hard that those in front had much
ado to save themselves from being thrust in; if one man
swooned or dropped, a dozen struggled for his place,
and that, although they knew the pain, and thirst, and
pressure to be unendurable. Those who fell down in
fainting-fits, and were crushed or burnt, were carried to
an inn-yard close at hand, and dashed with water from
a pump; of which buckets full were passed from man to
man among the crowd; but such was the strong desire
of all to drink, and such the fighting to be first, that,
for the most part, the whole contents were spilled upon
the ground, without the lips of one man being mois-
tened.
Meanwhile, and in the midst of all the roar and out-
cry, those who were nearest to the pile heaped up again
the burning fragments that came toppling down, and
raked the fire about the door, which, although a sheet of
flame, was still a door, fast locked and barred, and kept
them out. Great pieces of blazing wood were passed,
besides, above the people's heads to such as stood about
the ladders, and some of these, climbing up to the top-
most stave, and holding on with one hand by the prison
wall, exerted all their skill and force to cast these fire-
brands on the roof, or down into the yards within. In
many instances their efforts were successful; which oc-
casioned a new and appaling addition to the horrors of
the scene; for the prisoners within, seeing from between
their bars that the fire caught in many places and thrived

fiercely, and being all locked up in strong cells for the
night, began to know that they were in danger of being
burnt alive. This terrible fear, spreading from cell to
cell, and from yard to yard, vented itself in such dismal
cries and wailings, and in such dreadful shrieks for help,
that the whole jail resounded with the noise; which was
loudly heard even above the shouting of the mob and
roaring of the flames, and was so full of agony and de-
spair, that it made the boldest tremble.
It was remarkable that these cries began in that quar-
ter of the jail which fronted Newgate Street, where it
was well known the men who were to suffer death on
Thursday were confined. And not only were these four
who had so short a time to live the first to whom the
dread of being burnt occurred, but they were, through-
out, the most importunate of all: for they could be
plainly heard, notwithstanding the great thickness of
the walls, crying that the wind set that way, and that
the flames would shortly reach them; and calling to the
officers of the jail to come and quench the fire from a
cistern which was in their yard, and full of water.
Judging from what the crowd without the walls could
hear from time to time, these four doomed wretches
never ceased to call for help, and that with as much dis-
traction, and in as great a frenzy of attachment to ex-
istence, as though each had an honoured, happy life
before him, instead of eight-and-forty hours of miser-
able imprisonment, and then a violent and shameful
death.
But the anguish and suffering of the two sons of
one of these men, when they heard, or fancied that they
heard, their father's voice, is past description. After
wringing their hands and rushing to and fro as if they
were stark mad, one mounted on the shoulders of his
brother, and tried to clamber up the face of the high
wall, guarded at the top with spikes and points of iron.
And when he fell among the crowd he was not deterred
by his bruises, but mounted up again, and fell again,
and, when he found the feat impossible, began to beat
the stones, and tear them with his hands, as if he could
that way make a breach in the strong building, and force
a passage in. At last, they cleft their way among the
mob about the door, though many men, a dozen times
their match, had tried in vain to do so, and were seen,

in-yes, in the fire, striving to prize it down with
crowbars.
Nor were they alone affected by the outcry from
within the prison. The women who were looking on
shrieked loudly, beat their hands together, stopped their
ears; and many fainted; the men who were not near
the walls and active in the seige, rather than to do noth-
ing, tore up the pavement of the street, and did so with
a haste and fury they could not have surpassed if that
had been the jail, and they were near their object. Not
one living creature in the throng was for an instant still.
The whole great mass were mad.
A shout! Another! Another yet, though few knew
why, or what it meant. But those around the gate had
seen it slowly yield, and drop from its topmost hinge.
It hung on that side by but one, but it was upright still,
because of the bar, and its having sunk, of its own
weight, into the heap of ashes at its foot. There was
now a gap at the top of the doorway, through which
could be descried a gloomy passage, cavernous and dark.
Pile up the fire!
It burnt fiercely. The door was red-hot, and the gap
wider. They vainly tried to shield their faces with their
hands, and standing as if in readiness for a spring,
watched the place. Dark figures, some crawling on
their hands and knees, some carried in the arms of others,
were seen to pass along the roof. It was plain the jail
could hold out no longer. The keeper, and his officers,
and their wives and children, were escaping. Pile up
the fire!
The door sank down again: it settled deeper in the
cinders—tottered-yielded-was down!
As they shouted again, they fell back for a moment,
and left a clear space about the fire that lay between
them and the jail entry. Hugh leapt upon the blazing
heap, and scattering a train of sparks into the air, and
making the dark lobby glitter with those that hung upon
his dress, dashed into the jail.
The hangman followed. And then so many rushed
upon their track, that the fire got trodden down and
thinly strewn about the street; but there was no need of
it now, for, inside and out, the prison was in flames.

CHAPTER VII.
DURING the whole course of the terrible scene which
was now at its height, one man in the jail suffered a
degree of fear and mental torment which had no paral-
lel in the endurance even of those who lay under the
sentence of death.
When the rioters first assembled before the building,
the murderer was roused from sleep—if such slumbers
as his may have that blessed name—by the roar of
voices and the struggling of a great crowd. He started
up as these sounds met his ear, and, sitting on his bed-
stead, listened.
After a short interval of silence the noise burst out
again. Still listening attentively, he made out, in course
of time, that the jail was besieged by a furious multi-
tude. His guilty conscience instantly arrayed these
men against himself, and brought the fear upon him
that he would be singled out and torn to pieces.
Once impressed with the terror of this conceit, every-
thing tended to confirm and strengthen it. His double
crime, the circumstances under which it had been com-
mitted, the length of time that had elapsed, and its dis-
covery in spite of all, made him as if it were, the visible
object of the Almighty's wrath. In all the crime and
vice and moral gloom of the great pest house of the
capital, he stood alone, marked and singled out by his
great guilt, a Lucifer among the devils. The other
prisoners were a host, hiding and sheltering each other
-a crowd like that without the walls. He was one man
against the whole united concourse; a single, solitary,
lonely man, from whom the very captives in the jail fell
off and shrunk appalled.
It might be that the intelligence of his capture hav-
ing been bruited abroad, they had come there purposely
to drag him out and kill him in the street; or it might
be that they were the rioters, and, in pursuance of an
old design, had come to sack the prison. But in either
case he had no belief or hope that they would spare him.
Every shout they raised, and every sound they made,
was a blow upon his heart. As the attack went on,

he grew more wild and frantic in his terror, tried to pull
away the bars that guarded the chimney and prevented
him from climbing up; called loudly on the turnkeys
to cluster round the cell and save him from the fury of
the rabble; or put him in some dungeon underground,
no matter of what depth, how dark it was, or loathsome,
or beset with rats and creeping things, so that it hid him
and was hard to find.
But no one came, or answered him. Fearful, even
while he cried to them, of attracting attention, he was
silent. By-and-by, he saw, as he looked from his grated
window, a strange glimmering on the stone walls and
pavement of the yard. It was feeble at first, and came
and went, as though some officers with torches were
passing to and fro upon the roof of the prison. Soon it
reddened, and lighted brands came whirling down,
spattering the ground with fire, and burning sullenly in
corners. One rolled beneath a wooden bench, and set it
in a blaze; another caught a water-spout, and so went
climbing up the wall, leaving a long straight track of
fire behind it. After a time, a slow thick shower of
burning fragments, from some upper portion of the
prison which was blazing nigh, began to fall before
his door. Remembering that it opened outwards, he
knew that every spark which fell upon the heap, and in
the act lost its bright life, and died an ugly speck of dust
and rubbish, helped to entomb him in a living grave.
Still, though the jail resounded with shrieks and cries
for help—though the fire bounded up as if each sep-
arate flaine had had a tiger's life, and roared as
though in every one there were a hungry voice—though
the heat began to grow intense, and the air suffocating,
and the clamour without increased, and the danger of
his situation even from one merciless element was every
moment more extreme-still he was afraid to raise his
voice again, lest the crowd should break in, and should,
of their own ears or from the information given them by
the other prisoners, get the clue to his place of confine-
ment. Thus fearful alike, of those within the prison
and those without; of noise and silence; light and dark-
ness; of being released, and being left there to die; he
was so tortured and tormented that nothing man has
ever done to man in the horrible caprice of power and
cruelty exceeds his self-inflicted punishment

Now, now, the door was down. Now they came rush-
ing through the jail, calling to each other in the vaulted
passages; clashing the iron gates dividing yard from
yard; beating at the doors of cells and wards; wrench-
ing off bolts and locks and bars; tearing down the door-
posts to get men out; endeavouring to drag them by
main force through gaps and windows where a child
could scarcely pass; whooping and yelling without a
moment's rest; and running through the heat and flames
as if they were cased in metal. By their legs, their
arms, the hair upon their heads, they dragged the
prisoners out. Some threw themselves upon the captives
as they got towards the door, and tried to file away their
irons; some danced about them with a frenzied joy, and
rent their clothes, and were ready, as it seemed, to tear
them limb from limb. Now a party of a dozen men
came darting through the yard into which the murderer
cast fearful glances from his darkened window;dragging
a prisoner along the ground whose dress they had nearly
torn from his body in their mad eagerness to set him
free, and who was bleeding and senseless in their hands.
Now a score of prisoners ran to and fro, who had lost
themselves in the intricacies of the prison, and were so
bewildered with the noise and glare that they knew not
where to turn or what to do; and still cried out for help,
as loudly as before. Anon some famished wretch whose
theft had been a loaf of bread, or a scrap of butcher's
meat, came skulking past; barefooted-going slowly
away because that jail, his house, was burning; not be-
cause he had any other, or had friends to meet, or old
haunts to revisit, or any liberty to gain, but liberty to
starve and die. And then a knot of highwaymen went
trooping by, conducted by the friends they had among
the crowd, who muffled their fetters as they went along,
with handkerchiefs and bands of hay, and wrapped
them in coats and cloaks, and gave them drink from
bottles, and held it to their lips, because of their hand-
cuffs, which there was no time to remove. All this, and
Heaven knows how much more, was done amidst a
noise, a hurry, and distraction, like nothing that we
know of, even in our dreams; which seemed forever on
the rise, and never to decrease for the space of a single
instant.
He was still looking down from his window upon these

things, when a band of men with torches, ladders, axes,
and many kinds of weapons, poured into the yard, and
hammering at his door, inquired if there were any
prisoner within. He left the window when he saw them
coming, and drew back into the remotest corner of the
cell; but although he returned them no answer, they had
a fancy that some one was inside, for they presently set
ladders against it, and began to tear away the bars at
the casement; not only that, indeed, but with pickaxes
to hew down the very stones in the wall.
As soon as they had made a breach at the window,
large enough for the admission of a man's head, one of
them thrust in a torch and looked all round the room.
He followed this man's gaze until it rested on himself,
and heard him demand why he had not answered, but
made him no reply.
In the general surprise and wonder, they were used to
this; without saying anything more, they enlarged the
breach until it was large enough to admit the body of a
man, and then came dropping down upon the floor, one
after another, until the cell was full. They caught him
up among them, handed him to the window, and those
who stood upon the ladders passed him down upon the
pavement of the yard. Then the rest came out, one
after another, and, bidding him fly, and lose no time, or
the way would be choked up, hurried away to rescue
others.
It seemed not a minute's work from first to last. He
staggered to his feet, incredulous of what had happened,
when the yard was filled again, and a crowd rushed on,
hurrying Barnaby among them. In another minute-
not so much; another minute! the same instant, with no
lapse or interval between!—he and his son were being
passed from hand to hand, through the dense crowd in
the street, and were glancing backward at a burning
pile which some one said was Newgate.
From the moment of their first entrance into the
prison, the crowd dispersed themselves about it, and
swarmed into every chink and crevice, as if they had a
perfect acquaintance with its innermost parts, and bore
in their minds an exact plan of the whole. For this im-
mediate knowledge of the place they were, no doubt, in
a great degree indebted to the hangman, who stood in
the lobby, directing some to go this way, some that, and

some the other; and who materially assisted in bringing
about the wonderful rapidity with which the release of
the prisoners was effected.
But this functionary of the law reserved one important
piece of intelligence, and kept it snugly to himself.
When he had issued his instructions relative to every
other part of the building, and the mob were dispersed
from end to end, and busy at their work, he took a
bundle of keys from a kind of cupboard in the wall, and
going by a private passage near the chapel (it joined the
governor's house, and was then on fire), betook himself
to the condemned cells, which were a series of small,
strong, dismal rooms, opening on a low gallery, guarded
at the end at which he entered by a strong iron wicket,
and at its opposite extremity by two doors and a thick
grate. Having double locked the wicket and assured
himself that the other entrances were well secured, he
sat down on a bench in the gallery, and sucked the head
of his stick, with an air of the utmost complacency,
tranquility, and contentment.
It would have been strange enough, a man's enjoying
himself in this quiet manner, while the prison was burn-
ing, and such a tumult was cleaving the air, though he
had been outside the walls. But here, in the very heart
of the building, and moreover with the prayers and cries
of the four men under sentence sounding in his ears,
and their hands, stretched out through the gratings in
their cell doors, clasped in frantic entreaty before his
very eyes, it was particularly remarkable. Indeed Mr.
Dennis appeared to think it an uncommon circumstance
and to banter himself upon it; for he thrust his hat on
one side as some men do when they are in a waggish
humour, sucked the head of his stick with a higher relish
and smiled as though he would say, “Dennis, you're a
rum dog; you're a queer fellow; you're capital company,
Dennis, and quite a character!”
He sat in this way for some minutes, while the four
men in the cells, certain that somebody had entered the
gallery, but could not see who, gave vent to such piteous
entreaties as wretches in their miserable condition may
be supposed to have been inspired with: urging, whoever
it was, to set them at liberty, for the love of Heaven;
and protesting, with great fervour, and truly enough,
perhaps, for the time, that if they escaped, they would

amend their ways, and would never, never, never again
do wrong before God or man, but would lead penitent
and sober lives, and sorrowfully repent the crimes they
had committed. The terrible energy with which they
spoke would have moved any person, no matter how
good or just (if any good or just person could have
strayed into that sad place that night), to have set them
at liberty; and, while he would have left any other
punishment to its free course, to have saved them from
this last dreadful and repulsive penalty; which never
turned a man inclined to evil, and has hardened thou-
sands who were half inclined to good.
Mr. Dennis, who had been bred and nurtured in the
good old school, and had administered the good old laws
on the good old plan, always once and sometimes twice
every six weeks, for a long time, bore these appeals
with a deal of philosophy. Being at last, however,
rather disturbed in his pleasant reflection by their repe-
tition, he rapped at one of the doors with his stick, and
cried:
“Hold your noise there, will you?"
At this they all cried together that they were to be
hanged on the next day but one; and again implored
his aid.
“Aid! For what!” said Mr. Dennis, playfully rapping
the knuckles of the hand nearest him.
“ To save us!” they cried.
“Oh, certainly,” said Mr. Dennis, winking at the wall
in the absence of any friend with whom he could humour
the joke. “And so you're to be worked off, are you,
brothers?”
“ Unless we are released to-night,” one of them cried,
" we are dead men!"
“I tell you what it is,” said the hangman, gravely;
“I'm afraid, my friend, that you're not in that 'ere state
of mind that's suitable to your condition, then; you're
not a going to be released; don't think it. Will you
leave off that 'ere indecent row? I wonder you an't
ashamed of yourselves, I do.”
He followed up this reproof by rapping every set of
knuckles, one after the other, and having done so, re-
sumed his seat again with a cheerful countenance.
“You've had law,” he said, crossing his legs and ele-
vating his eyebrows: “ laws have been made a' purpose

for you; a werry handsome prison's been made a' pur-
pose for you; a parson's kept a' purpose for you; a con-
stitootional officer's appointed a' purpose for you; carts
is maintained a' purpose for you—and yet you're not
contented! Will you hold that noise, you sir, in the
furthest?”
A groan was the only answer.
“ So well as I can make out,” said Mr. Dennis, in a
tone of mingled badinage and remonstrance, “ there's
not a man among you. I begin to think I'm on the op-
posite side and among the ladies; though, for the matter
of that, I've seen a many ladies face it out in a manner
that did honour to the sex. You, in number two, don't
grind them teeth of yours. Worse manners," said the
hangman, rapping at the door with his stick, “I never
see in this place afore. I'm ashamed on you. You're
a disgrace to the Bailey."
After pausing for a moment to hear if anything could
be pleaded in justification, Mr. Dennis resumed in a
sort of coaxing tone:
“Now look’ee here, you four. I'm come here to take
care of you, and see that you an't burnt, instead of the
other thing. It's no use your making any noise, for you
won't be found out by them as has broken in, and you'll
only be hoarse when you come to the speeches—which
is a pity. What I say in respect to the speeches always
is, 'Give it mouth.' That's my maxim. Give it mouth.
I've heerd,” said the hangman, pulling off his hat to take
his handkerchief from the crown and wipe his face, and
then putting it on again a little more on one side than
before, “I've heerd a eloquence on them boards—you
know what boards I mean—and have heerd a degree of
mouth given to them speeches, that they was as clear as
a bell, and as good as a play. There's a pattern! And
always, when a thing of this natur's to come off, what I
stand up for, is a proper frame of mind. Let us
have a proper frame of mind, and we can go through
with it, creditable-pleasant-sociable. Whatever you
do (and I address myself, in particular, to you in the
furthest), never snivel. I'd sooner by half, though
I lose by it, see a man tear his clothes a' purpose to spile
'em before they come to me, than to find him snivelling.
It's ten to one a better frame of mind, every way!”
While the hangman addressed them to this effect, in

the tone and with the air of a pastor in familiar conver-
sation with his flock, the noise had been in some degree
subdued; for the rioters were busy. in conveying the
prisoners to the Sessions House, which was beyond the
main walls of the prison, though connected with it, and
the crowd were busy too, in passing them from thence
along the street. But when he had got thus far in his
discourse, the sound of voices in the yard showed plainly
that the mob had returned and were coming that way;
and directly afterwards a violent crashing at the gate
below gave note of their attack upon the cells (as they
were called) at last.
It was in vain the hangman ran from door to door,
and covered the grates, one after another, with his hat,
in futile efforts to stifle the cries of the four men within;
it was in vain he dogged their outstretched hands, and
beat them with his stick, or menaced them with new
and lingering pains in the execution of his office; the
place resounded with their cries. These, together with
the feeling that they were now the last men in the jail,
so worked upon and stimulated the besiegers that, in an
incredibly short space of time, they forced the strong
gate down below, which was formed of iron rods two
inches square, drove in the two other doors as if they
had been but deal partitions, and stood at the end of the
gallery with only a bar or two between them and the
cells.
“Halloa!” cried Hugh, who was the first to look into
the dusky passage: “ Dennis before us! Well done, old
boy. Be quick, and open here, for we shall be suffocated
in the smoke, going out.”
“Go out at once, then,” said Dennis. “What do you
want here?”
66 Want!" echoed Hugh. “ The four men.”
“Four devils!” cried the hangman. “Don't you know
they’re left for death on Thursday? Don't you respect
the law-the constitootion-nothing? Let the four
men be.”
“Is this a time for joking?” cried Hugh. Do you hear
'em? Pull away these bars that have got fixed between
the door and the ground; and let us in."
“Brother,” said the hangman in a low voice, as he
stooped under pretence of doing what Hugh desired, but
only looked up in his face, “can't your leave these here

four men to me, if I've the whim? You do what you
like, and have what you like of everything for your
share-give me my share. I want these four men left
alone, I tell you!"
“Pull the bars down, or stand out of the way,” was
Hugh's reply.
“You can turn the crowd if you like; you know that
well enough, brother,” said the hangman, slowly.
“What! You will come in, will you?”
Yes."
“You won't let these men alone, and leave 'em to me?
You've no respect for nothing—haven't you?" said the
hangman, retreating to the door by which he had en-
tered, and regarding his companion with a scowl. “You
will come in, will you, brother?”
“I tell you, yes. What the devil ails you? Where
are you going?”
“No matter where I'm going,” rejoined the hangman,
looking in again at the iron wicket, which he had nearly
shut upon himself, and held ajar. “Remember where
you're coming. That's all!”
With that he shook his likeness at Hugh, and giving
him a grin, compared with which his usual smile was
amiable, disappeared and shut the door.
Hugh paused no longer, but goaded alike by the cries
of the convicts, and by the impatience of the crowd,
warned the man immediately behind him—the way was
only wide enough for one abreast-to stand back, and
wielded a sledge hammer with such strength that after a
few blows the iron bent and broke, and gave them free
admittance.
If the two sons of one of these men, of whom mention
has been made, were furious in their zeal before, they
had now the wrath and vigour of lions. Calling to the
man within each cell, to keep as far back as he could,
lest the axes crashing through the door should wound
him, a party went to work upon each one, to beat it in
by sheer strength and force the bolts and staples from
their hold. But although these two lads had the weakest
party and the worst armed, and did not begin until after
the others, having stopped to whisper to him through
the grate, that door was the first open, and that man
the first out. As they dragged him into the gallery to
knock off his irons, he fell down among them, a mere

heap of chains, and was carried out in that state on
men's shoulders with no sign of life.
The release of these four wretched creatures, and con-
veying them, astounded and bewildered, into the street
so full of life-a spectacle they had never thought to see
again, until they emerged from solitude and silence
upon that last journey, when the air should be heavy
with the pent-up breath of thousands, and the streets
and houses should be built and roofed with human faces,
not with bricks and tiles and stones—was the crowning
horror of the scene. Their pale and haggard looks and
hollow eyes; their staggering feet, and hands stretched
out as if to save themselves from falling; their wander-
ing and uncertain air; the way they heaved and gasped
for breath, as though in water, when they were first
plunged into the crowd; all marked them for the men.
No need to say “ this one was doomed to die;" there were
the words broadly stamped and branded on his face.
The crowd fell off, as if they had been laid out for burial,
and had risen in their shrouds; and many were seen to
shudder, as though they had been actually dead men,
when they chanced to touch or brush against their gar-
ments.
At the bidding of the mob, the houses were all illu-
minated that night-lighted up from top to bottom as
at a time of public gaiety and joy. Many years after-
wards, old people who lived in their youth near this part
of the city, remembered being in a great glare of light,
within doors and without, and as they looked, timid
and frightened children, from the windows, seeing a
face go by. Though the whole great crowd and all its
other terrors had faded from their recollection, this one
object remained; alone, distinct, and well-remembered.
Even in the unpractised minds of infants, one of these
doomed men, darting past, and but an instant seen,
was an image of force enough to dim the whole con-
course; to find itself an all-absorbing place, and hold it
ever after.
When this last task had been achieved, the shouts
and cries grew fainter; the clank of fetters, which had
resounded on all sides as the prisoners escaped, was
heard no more; all the noises of the crowd subsided into a
hoarse and sullen murmur as it passed into the distance;
and when the human tide had rolled away, a melan-

choly heap of smoking ruins marked the spot where it
had lately chafed and roared.
CHAPTER VIII.
ALTHOUGH he had had no rest upon the previous night,
and had watched with little intermission for some weeks
past, sleeping only in the day by starts and snatches,
Mr. Haredale, from the dawn of morning until sunset,
sought his niece in every place where he deerned it pos-
sible she could have taken refuge. All day long, noth-
ing save a draught of water passed his lips; though he
prosecuted his inquiries far and wide, and never so
much as sat down once.
In every quarter he could think of; at Chigwell and
in London; at the house of the trades’-people with whom
he dealt, and of the friends he knew; he pursued his
search. A prey to the most harrowing anxieties and
apprehensions, he went from magistrate to magistrate,
and finally to the Secretary of State. The only comfort
he received was from this minister, who assured him
that the Government, being now driven to the exercise of
the extreme prerogatives of the Crown, were determined
to exert them; that a proclamation would probably be out
upon the morrow, giving to the military discretionary
and unlimited power in the suppression of the riots; that
the sympathies of the King, the Administration, and both
Houses of Parliament, and indeed of all good men of
every religious persuasion, were strongly with the in-
jured Catholics; and that justice should be done them
at any cost or hazard. He told him, moreover, that other
persons whose houses had been burnt, had for a time
lost sight of their children or their relatives, but had ii
every case, within his knowledge, succeeded in discov-
ering them; that his complaint should be remembered,
and fully stated in the instructions given to the officers
in command, and to all the inferior myrmidons of jus-
tice; and that everything that could be done to help him,
should be done, with a good-will and in good faith.
Grateful for this consolation, feeble as it was in its
reference to the past, and little hope as it afforded him
in connection with the subject of distress which lay

nearest to his heart, and really thankful for the interest
the minister expressed, and seemed to feel, in his con-
dition, Mr. Haredale withdrew. He found himself, with
the night coming on, alone in the streets, and destitute
of any place in which to lay his head.
He entered an hotel near Charing Cross, and ordered
some refreshment and a bed. He saw that his faint and
worn appearance attracted the attention of the landlord
and his waiters, and thinking that they might suppose
him to be penniless, took out his purse and laid it on the
table. It was not that, the landlord said, in a faltering
voice. If he were one of those who had suffered by the
rioters, he durst not give him entertainment. He had a
family of children, and had been twice warned to be
careful in receiving guests. He heartily prayed his for-
giveness, but what could he do?
Nothing. No man felt that more sincerely than Mr.
Haredale. He told the man as much, and left the
house.
Feeling that he might have anticipated this occur-
rence, after what he had seen at Chigwell in the morn-
ing, where no man dared to touch a spade, though he
offered a large reward to all who would come and dig
among the ruins of his house, he walked along the
Strand; too proud to expose himself to another refusal,
and of too generous a spirit to involve in distress or ruin
any honest tradesman who might be weak enough
to give him shelter. He wandered into one of the
streets by the side of the river, and was pacing in a
thoughtful manner up and down, thinking of things
that had happened long ago, when he heard a servant-
man at an upper window call to another on the opposite
side of the street that the mob were setting fire to New-
gate.
To Newgate! where that man was! His failing strength
returned, his energies came back with tenfold vigour, on
an instant. If it were possible—if they should set the
murderer free-was he, after all he had undergone, to
die with the suspicion of having slain his own brother,
dimly gathering about him-
He had no consciousness of going to the jail; but there
he stood before it. There was the crowd, wedged and
pressed together in a dense, dark, moving mass; and
there were the flames soaring up into the air. His head

turned round and round, lights flashed before his eyes,
and he struggled hard with two men.
“Nay, nay,” said one. “Be more yourself, my good
sir. We attract attention here. Come away. What
can you do among so many men?"
“The gentleman's always for doing something," said
the other, forcing him along as he spoke. “I like him
for that. I do like him for that.”
They had by this time got him into a court, hard by
the prison. He looked from one to the other, and as he
tried to release himself, felt that he tottered on his feet.
He who had spoken first was the old gentleman whom
he had seen at the Lord Mayor's. The other was John
Grueby, who had stood by him so manfully at West-
minster.
“What does this mean?” he asked them faintly. “How
came we together?”
“On the skirts of the crowd,” returned the distiller;
“but come with us. Pray come with us. You seem to
know my friend here?”
“Surely,” said Mr. Haredale, looking in a kind of
stupor at John.
“He'll tell you, then,” returned the old gentleman,
“that I am a man to be trusted. He's my servant. He
was lately (as you know, I have no doubt) in Lord
George Gordon's service; but he left it, and brought, in
pure good will to me and others who are marked by the
rioters, such intelligence as he had picked up of their
designs.”.
“On one condition, please sir,” said John, touching
his hat. “No evidence against my lord-a misled man
-a kind-hearted man, sir. My lord never intended
this.”
“The condition will be observed, of course,” rejoined
the old distiller. “It's a point of honour. But come with
us, sir; pray come with us.”
John Grueby added no entreaties, but he adopted a
different kind of persuasion by putting his arm through
one of Mr. Haredale's, while his master took the other,
and leading him away with all speed.
Sensible, from a strange lightness in his head, and a
difficulty in fixing his thoughts on anything, even to the
extent of bearing his companions in his mind for a min-
ute together without looking at them, that his brain was

affected by the agitation and suffering through which
he had passed, and to which he was still a prey, Mr.
Haredale let them lead him where they would. As they
went along, he was conscious of having no command
over what he said or thought, and that he had a fear of
going mad.
The distiller lived, as he had told him when they first
met, on Holborn Hill, where he had great storehouses,
and drove a large trade. They approached his door by
a back entrance, lest they should attract the notice of
the crowd, and went into an upper room which faced
towards the street; the windows, however, in common
with those of every other room in the house, were boarded
up inside, in order that out of doors all might appear
quite dark.
They laid him on a sofa in this chamber, perfectly in-
sensible; but John immediately fetching a surgeon, who
took from him a large quantity of blood, he gradually
came to himself. As he was, for the time, too weak to
walk, they had no difficulty in persuading him to re-
main there all night, and got him to bed without loss of
a minute. That done, they gave him cordial and some
toast, and presently a pretty strong composing-draught,
under the influence of which he soon fell into a lethargy,
and for a time forgot his troubles.
The vintner, who was a very hearty old fellow, and a
worthy man, had no thoughts of going to bed himself,
for he had received several threatening warnings from
the rioters, and had indeed gone out that evening to try
and gather from the conversation of the mob whether
his house was to be the next attacked. He sat all night
in an easy-chair in the same room-dozing a little now
and then and received from time to time the reports of
John Grueby and two or three other trustworthy persons
in his employ, who went out into the streets as scouts;
and for whose entertainment an ample allowance of
good cheer (which the old vintner, despite his anxiety,
now and then attacked himself) was set forth in an
adjoining chamber.
These accounts were of a sufficiently alarming nature
from the first; but as the night wore on, they grew so
much worse, and involved such a fearful amount of
riot and destruction, that in comparison with these new
tidings all the previous disturbances sunk to nothing.

The first intelligence that came was of the taking of
Newgate, and the escape of all the prisoners, whose
track, as they made up Holborn and into the adjacent
streets, was proclaimed to those citizens who were shut
up in their houses by the rattling of their chains, which
formed a dismal concert, and was heard in every direc-
tion, as though so many forges were at work. The
flames, too, shone so brightly through the vintner's sky-
lights, that the rooms and staircases below were nearly
as light as in broad day; while the distant shouting of
the mob seemed to shake the very walls and ceilings.
At length they were heard approaching the house,
and some minutes of terrible anxiety ensued. They
came close up, and stopped before it; but after giving
three loud yells went on. And although they returned
several times that night, creating new alarms each time,
they did nothing there; having their hands full. Shortly
after they had gone away for the first time, one of the
scouts came running in with the news that they had
stopped before Lord Mansfield's house in Bloomsbury
Square.
Soon afterwards there came another, and another,
and then the first returned again, and so, by little and
little, their tale was this : That the mob gathering round
Lord Mansfield's house, had called on those within to
open the door, and receiving no reply (for Lord and
Lady Mansfield were at that moment escaping by the
back way), forced an entrance according to their usual
custom. That they then began to demolish the house
with great fury, and setting fire to it in several parts,
involved in a common ruin the whole of the costly furni-
ture, the plate and jewels, a beautiful gallery of pictures,
the rarest collection of manuscripts ever possessed by
any one private person in the world, and worse than all,
because nothing could replace this loss, the great Law
Library, on almost every page of which were notes in
the Judge's own hand; of inestimable value-being the
results of the study and experience of his whole life.
That while they were howling and exulting round the
fire, a troop of soldiers, with a magistrate among them,
came up, and being too late (for the mischief was by
that time done), began to disperse the crowd. That the
riot act being read, and the crowd still resisting, the
soldiers received orders to fire, and leveling their mus-

kets shot dead at the first discharge six men and a
woman, and wounded many persons; and loading again
directly, fired another volley, but over the people's heads,
it was supposed, as none were seen to fall. That there-
upon, and daunted by the shrieks and tumult, the crowd
began to disperse, and the soldiers went away, leaving
the killed and wounded upon the ground: which they
had no sooner done than the rioters came back again,
and taking up the dead bodies, and the wounded people,
formed into a rude procession, having the bodies in the
front! That in this order they paraded off with a hor-
rible merriment; fixing weapons in the dead men's hands
to make them look as if alive; and preceded by a fellow
ringing Lord Mansfield's dinner-bell with all his might.
The scouts reported further, that this party meeting
with some others who had been at similiar work else-
where, they all united into one, and drafting off a few
men with the killed and wounded, marched away to
Lord Mansfield's country seat at Caen Wood, between
Hampstead and Highgate; bent upon destroying that
house likewise, and lighting up a great fire there, which
from that height should be seen all over London. But
in this they were disappointed, for a party of horse
having arrived before them, they retreated faster than
they went, and came straight back to town.
There being now a great many parties in the streets,
each went to work according to its humour, and a dozen
houses were quickly blazing, including those of Sir John
Fielding and two other justices, and four in Holborn-
one of the greatest thoroughfares in London—which
were all burning at the same time, and burned until they
went out of themselves, for the people cut the engine
hose, and would not suffer the firemen to play upon the
flames. At one house near Moorfields they found in
one of the rooms some canary birds in cages, and these
they cast into the fire alive. The poor little creatures
screamed, it was said, like infants, when they were flung
upon the blaze; and one man was so touched that he
tried in vain to save them, which roused the indignation
of the crowd and nearly cost him his life.
At this same house one of the fellows who went
through the rooms, breaking the furniture and helping
to destroy the building, found a child's doll -a poor toy
-which he exhibited at the window to the mob below, as

the image of some unholy saint which the late occupants
had worshiped. While he was doing this another man,
with an equally tender conscience (they had both been
foremost in throwing down the canary birds for roast-
ing alive), took his seat on the parapet of the house, and
harangued the crowd from a pamphlet circulated by the
Association, relative to the true principles of Christi-
anity! Meanwhile the Lord Mayor, with his hands in
his pockets, looked on as an idle man might look at any
other show, and seem mightily satisfied to have got a
good place.
Such were the accounts brought to the old vintner by
his servants as he sat at the side of Mr. Haredale's bed,
having been unable even to doze after the first part of the
night; too much disturbed by his own fears, by the cries
of the mob, the light of the fires, and the firing of the
soldiers. Such, with the addition of the release of all
the prisoners in the New Jail at Clerkenwell, and as
many robberies of passengers in the streets as the crowd
had leisure to indulge in, were the scenes of which Mr.
Haredale was happily unconscious, and which were all
enacted before midnight.
CHAPTER IX.
WHEN darkness broke away and morning began to
dawn, the town wore a strange aspect indeed.
Sleep had scarcely been thought of all night. The
general alarm was so apparent in the faces of the in-
habitants, and its expression was so aggravated by
want of rest (few persons, with any property to lose,
having dared to go to bed since Monday), that a stran-
ger coming into the streets would have supposed some
mortal pest or plague to have been raging. In place of
the usual cheerfulness and animation of morning, every-
thing was dead and silent. The shops remained un-
closed, offices and warehouses were shut, the coach and
chair stands were deserted, no carts or wagons rumbled
through the slowly waking streets, the early cries were
all hushed; a universal gloom prevailed. Great num-
bers of people were out, even at daybreak, but they
flitted to and fro as though they shrank from the sound
a fr. were, outloom prevailearly cries"

of their own footsteps; the public ways were haunted
rather than frequented; and round the smoking ruins
people stood apart from one another and in silence, not
venturing to condemn the rioters, or to be supposed
to do so, even in whispers.
At the Lord President's in Piccadilly, at Lambeth
Palace, at the Lord Chancellor's in Great Ormond Street,
in the Royal Exchange, the Bank, the Guildhall, the Inns
of Court, the Courts of Law, and every chamber front-
ing the streets near Westminster Hall and the Houses
of Parliament, parties of soldiers were posted before
daylight. A body of Horse-Guards paraded Palace-
yard; an encampment was formed in the Park, where
fifteen hundred men and five battalions of Militia were
under arms; the Tower was fortified, the draw-bridges
were raised, the cannon loaded and pointed, and two
regiments of artillery busied in strengthening the
fortress and preparing it for defence. A numerous de-
tachment of soldiers were stationed to keep guard at
the New-River Head, which the people had threatened
to attack, and where, it was said, they meant to cut off
the main-pipes, so that there might be no water for the
extinction of the flames. In the Poultry, and on Corn-
hill, and at several other leading points, iron chains were
drawn across the street; parties of soldiers were dis-
tributed in some of the old city churches while it was
yet dark; and in several private houses (among them,
Lord Rockingham's in Grosvenor Square); which were
blockaded as though to sustain a siege, and had guns
pointed from the windows. When the sun rose, it shone
into handsome apartments filled with armed men; the
furniture hastily heaped away in corners, and made of
little or no account, in the terror of the time-on arms
glittering in city chambers, among desks and stools, and
dusty books-into little smoky churchyards in odd lanes
and by-ways, with soldiers lying down among the
tombs, or lounging under the shade of the one old tree,
and their pile of muskets sparkling in the light on
solitary sentries pacing up and down in courtyards,
silent now, but yesterday resounding with the din and
hum of business-everywhere on guard-rooms, garri-
sons, and threatening preparations.
As the day crept on, still more unusual sights were
witnessed in the streets. The gates of the King's Bench

and Fleet Prisons being opened at the usual hour, were
found to have notices affixed to them, announcing that
the rioters would come that night to burn them down.
The Wardens, too well knowing the likelihood there
was of this promise being fulfilled, were fain to set their
prisoners at liberty, and give them leave to move their
goods; so, all day, such of them as had any furniture
were occupied in conveying it, some to this place, some
to that, and not a few to the brokers' shops, where they
gladly sold it for any wretched price those gentry
chose to give. There were some broken men among
these debtors who had been in jail so long, and were so
miserable and destitute of friends, so dead to the world,
and utterly forgotten and uncared for, that they im-
plored their jailers not to set them free, and to sendº
them, if need were, to some other place of custody.
But they, refusing to comply, lest they should incur the
anger of the mob, turned them into the streets, where
they wandered up and down, hardly remembering the
ways untrodden by their feet so long, and crying—such
abject things those rotten-hearted jails had made them
-as they slunk off in their rags, and dragged their slip-
shod feet along the pavement.
Even of the three hundred prisoners who had escaped
from Newgate, there were some—a few, but there were
some-who sought their jailers out and delivered them-
selves up: preferring imprisonment and punishment to
the horrors of such another night as the last. Many of
the convicts, drawn back to their old place of captivity
by some indescribable attraction, or by a desire to exult
over it in its downfall and glut their revenge by seeing
it in ashes, actually went back in broad noon, and
loitered about the cells. Fifty were retaken at one time
on this next day, within the prison walls; but their fate
did not deter others, for there they went in spite of
everything, and there they were taken in twos and
threes, twice or thrice a day, all through the week. Of
the fifty just mentioned, some were occupied in en-
deavouring to rekindle the fire; but in general they
seemed to have no object in view but to prowl and
lounge about the old place; being often found asleep in
the ruins, or sitting talking there, or even eating and
drinking, as in a choice retreat.
Besides the notices on the gates of the Fleet and the

che lock at the mob pries the Ar
King's Bench, many similar announcements were left,
before one o'clock at noon, at the houses of private indi-
viduals; and further, the mob proclaimed their intention
of seizing on the Bank, the Mint, the Arsenal at Wool-
wich, and the Royal Palaces. The notices were seldom
delivered by more than one man, who, if it were at a
shop, went in, and laid it, with a bloody threat perhaps,
upon the counter; or if it were at a private house,
knocked at the door, and thrust it in the servant's hand.
Notwithstanding the presence of the military in every
quarter of the town, and the great force in the Park,
these messengers did their errands with impunity all
through the day. So did two boys who went down Hol-
born alone, armed with bars taken from the railings of
Lord Mansfield's house, and demanded money for the
rioters. So did a tall man on horseback, who made a
collection for the same purpose on Fleet Street, and re-
fused to take anything but gold.
A rumour had now got into circulation, too, which
diffused a greater dread all through London, even than
these publicly announced intentions of the rioters,
though all men knew that if they were successfully
effected there must ensue a national bankruptcy and
general ruin. It was said that they meant to throw the
gates of Bedlam open, and let all the madmen loose.
This suggested such dreadful images to the people's
minds, and was in deed and act so fraught with new
and unimaginable horrors in the contemplation, that it
beset them more than any loss or cruelty of which they
could foresee the worst, and drove many sane men
nearly mad themselves. •
So the day passed on: the prisoners moving their
goods; people running to and fro in the streets, carrying
away their property; groups standing in silence round
the ruins; all business suspended; and the soldiers, dis-
posed as has been already mentioned, remaining quite
inactive. So the day passed on, and dreaded night drew
near again.
At last, at seven o'clock in tbe evening, the Privy
Council issued a solemn proclamation that it was now
necessary to employ the military, and that the officers
had most direct and effectual orders, by an immediate
exertion of their utmost force, to repress the disturb-
ances; and warning all good subjects of the king to

keep themselves, their servants, and apprentices, within
doors that night. There was then delivered out to every
soldier on duty thirty-six rounds of powder and ball;
the drums beat; and the whole force was under arms at
sunset.
The city authorities, stimulated by these vigourous
measures, held a common council; passed a vote thank-
ing the military associations who had tendered their aid
to the civil authorities; accepted it; and placed them
under the direction of the two sheriffs. At the queen's
palace, a double guard, the yeomen on duty, the groom-
porters, and all other attendants, were stationed in the
passages and on the staircases at seven o'clock, with
strict instructions to be watchful on their posts all
night; and all the doors were locked. The gentlemen of
the Temple and the other Inns mounted guard within
their gates, and strengthened them with the great stones
of the pavement, which they took up for the purpose. In
Lincoln's Inn, they gave up the hall and commons to
the Northumberland militia, under the command of Lord
Algernon Percy; in some few of the city wards the bur-
gesses turned out, and, without making a very fierce
show, looked brave enough. Some hundreds of stout
gentlemen threw themselves, armed to the teeth, into
the halls of the different companies, double-locked and
bolted all the gates, and dared the rioters (among them-
selves) to come on at their peril. These arrangements
being all made simultaneously, or nearly so, were com-
pleted by the time it got dark; and then the streets were
comparatively clear, and were guarded at all the great
corners and chief avenues by the troops; while parties
of the officers rode up and down in all directions, order-
ing chance stragglers home, and admonishing the resi-
dents to keep within their houses, and, if any firing
ensued, not to approach the windows. More chains were
drawn across such of the thoroughfares as were of a
nature to favour the approach of a great crowd, and at
each of these points a considerable force was stationed.
All these precautions having been taken, and it being
now quite dark, those in command awaited the result in
some anxiety: and not without a hope that such vigilant
demonstrations might of themselves dishearten the popu-
lace and prevent any new outrages.
But in this reckoning they were cruelly mistaken, for

in half an hour, or less, as though the setting in of the
night had been their preconcerted signal, the rioters hav-
ing previously, in small parties, prevented the lighting
of the street lamps, rose like a great sea; and that in so
many places at once, and with such inconceivable fury,
that those who had the direction of the troops knew not,
at first, where to turn or what to do. One after another,
new fires blazed up in every quarter of the town, as
though it were the intention of the insurgents to wrap the
city in a circle of flames, which, contracting by degrees,
should burn the whole to ashes; the crowd swarmed and
roared in every street; and none but rioters and soldiers
being out of doors, it seemed to the latter as if all Lon-
don was arrayed against them, and they stood alone
against the town.
In two hours, six-and-thirty fires were raging—six-and
thirty great conflagrations. Among them the Borough
Clink in Tooley Street, the King's Bench, the Fleet, and
the New Bridewell. In almost every street there was a
battle; and in every quarter the muskets of the troops
were heard above the shouts and tumult of the mob.
The firing began in the Poultry, where the chain was
drawn across the road, where nearly a score of people
were killed on the first discharge. Their bodies having
been hastily carried into St. Mildred's Church by the sol-
diers, the latter fired again, and following fast upon the
crowd, who began to give way when they saw the exe-
cution that was done, formed across Cheapside, and
charged them at the point of the bayonet.
The streets were now a dreadful spectacle. The shouts
of the rabble, the shrieks of women, the cries of the
wounded, and the constant firing formed a deafening and
an awful accompaniment to the sights which every cor-
ner presented. Wherever the road was obstructed by
the chains, there the fighting and the loss of life were
greatest; but there was hot work and bloodshed in
almost every leading thoroughfare.
At Holborn Bridge, and on Holborn Hill, the confu-
sion was greater than in any other part; for the crowd
that poured out of the city in two great streams, one by -
Ludgate Hill, and one by Newgate Street, united at that
spot, and formed a mass so dense that at every volley
the people seemed to fall in heaps. At this place a large
detachment of soldiery were posted, who fired, now up

71
Fleet Market, now up Holborn, now up Snow Hill-con-
stantly raking the streets in each direction. At this
place, too, several large fires were burning, so that all
the terrors of that terrible night seemed to be concen-
trated in one spot.
Full twenty times, the rioters, headed by one man
who wielded an axe in his right hand, and bestrode a
brewer's horse of great size and strength, caparisoned
with fetters taken out of Newgate, which clanked and
jingled as he went, made an attempt to force a passage
at this point, and fire the vintner's house. Full twenty
times they were repulsed with loss of life, and still came
back again: and though the fellow at their head was
marked and singled out by all, and was a conspicuous
object as the only rioter on horseback, not a man could
hit him. So surely as the smoke cleared away, so surely
there was he; calling hoarsely to his companions,
brandishing his axe above his head, and dashing on as
though he bore a charmed life, and was proof against
ball and powder.
This man was Hugh; and in every part of the riot he
was seen. He headed two attacks upon the Bank,
helped to break open the Toll-houses on Blackfriars
Bridge, and cast the money into the street; fired two of
the prisons with his own hand; was here, and there, and
everywhere-always foremost-always active-striking
at the soldiers, cheering on the crowd, making his
horse's iron music heard through all the yell and uproar:
but never hurt or stopped. Turn him at one place, and
he made a new struggle in another; force him to retreat
at this point, and he advanced on that, directly. Driven
from Holburn for the twentieth time, he rode at the
head of a great crowd straight upon Saint Paul's, at-
tacked a guard of soldiers who kept watch over a body
of prisoners within the iron railings, forced them to re-
treat, rescued the men they had in custody, and with
this accession to his party, came back again, mad with
liquor and excitement, and hallooing them on like a
demon.
It would have been no easy task for the most careful
rider to sit a horse in the midst of such a throng and
tumult; but though this madman rolled upon his back
(he had no saddle) like a boat upon the sea, he never for
an instant lost his seat, or failed to guide him where he

would. Through the very thickest of the press, over
dead bodies and burning fragments, now on the pave-
ment, now in the road, now riding up a flight of steps
to make himself the more conspicuous to his party, and
now forcing a passage through a mass of human beings,
so closely squeezed together that it seemed as if the edge
of a knife would scarcely part them-on he went, as
though he could surmount all obstacles by the mere ex-
ercise of his will. And perhaps his not being shot was
in some degree attributable to this very circumstance;
for his extreme audacity, and the conviction that he
must be one of those to whom the proclamation referred,
inspired the soldiers with a desire to take him alive, and
diverted many an aim which otherwise might have been
more near the mark.
The vintner and Mr. Haredale, unable to sit quietly
listening to the noise without seeing what went on, had
climbed to the roof of the house, and hiding behind a.
stack of chimneys, were looking cautiously down into
the street, almost hoping that after so many repulses
the rioters would be foiled, when a great shout proclaimed
that a party were coming round the other way; and the
dismal jingling of those accursed fetters warned them
next moment that they too were led by Hugh. The
soldiers had advanced into Fleet Market and were dis-
persing the people there; so that they came on with
hardly any check, and were soon before the house.
“All's over now," said the vintner. “Fifty thousand
pounds will be scattered in a minute. We must save
ourselves. We can do no more, and shall have reason
to be thankful if we do as much.”
Their first inpulse was to clamber along the roofs of
the houses, and, knocking at some garret window for
admission, pass down that way into the street, and so
escape. But another fierce cry from below, and a general
upturning of the faces of the crowd, apprised them that
they were discovered, and even that Mr. Haredale was
recognised; for Hugh, seeing him plainly in the bright
glare of the fire, which in that part made it as light as
day, called to him by his name, and swore to have his
life.
“Leave me here,” said Mr. Haredale, "and in
Heaven's name, my good friend, save yourself! Come
on!” he muttered, as he turned towards Hugh and faced

him without any further effort at concealment: "this
roof is high, and if we close, we will die together!”
“Madness," said the honest vintner, pulling him back,
“sheer madness. Hear reason, sir. My good sir, hear
reason.. I could never make myself heard by knocking
at a window now; and even if I could, no one would be
bold enough to connive at my escape. Through the
cellars, there's a kind of a passage into the back street
by which we roll casks in and out. We shall have time
to get down there, before they can force an entry. Do
not delay an instant, but coine with me—for both our
sakes—for mine--my dear, good sir!”
As he spoke, and drew Mr. Haredale back, they had
both a glimpse of the street. It was but a glimpse, but it
showed them the crowd, gathering and clustering round
the house; some of the armed men pressing to the front
to break down the doors and windows, some bringing
brands from the nearest fire, some with lifted faces fol-
lowing their course upon the roof and pointing them
out to their companions: all raging and roaring like the
flames they lighted up. They saw some men thirsting
for the treasures of strong liquor which they knew were
stored within; they saw others, who had been wounded,
sinking down into the opposite doorways and dying,
solitary wretches, in the midst of all the vast assemblage;
here a frightened woman trying to escape; and there a
lost child, and there a drunken ruffian, unconscious of
the death-wound on his head, raving and fighting to the
last. All these things, and even such trivial incidents
as a man with his hat off, or turning round, or stooping
down, or shaking hands with another, they marked dis-
tinctly; yet in a glance so brief that, in the act of
stepping back, they lost the whole, and saw but the
pale faces of each other, and the red sky above them..
Mr. Haredale yielded to the entreaties of his com-
panion-more because he was resolved to defend him
than for any thought he had of his own life, or any care
he entertained for his own safety-and quickly re-enter-
ing the house, they descended the stairs together. Loud
blows were thundering on the shutters, crowbars were
already thrust beneath the door, the glass fell from the
sashes, a deep light shone through every crevice, and
they heard the voices of the foremost in the crowd so
close to every chink and keyhole that they seemed to be

hoarsely whispering their threats into their very ears.
They had but a moment reached the bottom of the cel-
lar-steps and shut the door behind them, when the mob
broke in.
The vaults were profoundly dark, and having no torch
or candle—for they had been afraid to carry one, lest it
should betray their place of refuge—they were obliged
to grope with their hands. But they were not long with-
out light, for they had not gone far when they heard the
crowd forcing the door; and, looking back among the
low-arched passages, could see them in the distance,
hurrying to and fro with flashing links, broaching the
casks, staving the great vats, turning off upon the right
hand and the left, into the different cellars, and laying
down to drink at the channels of strong spirits which
were already flowing on the ground.
They hurried on, not the less quickly for this; and had
reached the only vault which lay between them and the
passage out, when suddenly, from the direction in which
they were going, a strong light gleamed upon their
faces; and before they could slip aside, or turn back, or
hide themselves, two men (one bearing a torch) came
upon them, and cried in an astonished whisper, “ Here
they are!"
At the same instant they pulled off what they wore
upon their heads. Mr. Haredale saw before him Ed-
ward Chester, and then saw, when the vintner gasped
his name, Joe Willet.
Ay, the same Joe, though with an arm the less, who
used to make the quarterly journey on the grey mare to
pay the bill to the purple-faced vintner; and that very
same purple-faced vintner, formerly of Thames Street,
now looked him in the face, and challenged him by
name.
"Give me your hand,” said Joe softly, taking it
whether the astonished vintner would or no. “Don't
fear to shake it; it's a friendly one and a hearty one,
though it has no fellow. Why, how well you look and
how bluff you are! And you—God bless you, sir. Take
heart, take heart. We'll find them. Be of good cheer;
we have not been idle.”
There was something so honest and frank in Joe's
speech, that Mr. Haredale put his hand in his involun-
tarily, though their meeting was suspicious enough,

145
But his glance at Edward Chester, and that gentleman's
keeping aloof, were not lost upon Joe, who said bluntly,
glancing at Edward while he spoke: .
“Times are changed, Mr. Haredale, and times have
come when we ought to know friends from enemies,
and make no confusion of names. Let me tell you that
but for this gentleman you would most likely have been
dead by this time, or badly wounded at the best.”
" What do you say," asked Mr. Haredale.
“I say,” said Joe, “first, that it was a bold thing to
be in the crowd at all disguised as one of them though;
I won't say much about that, on second thoughts, for
that's my case, too. Secondly, that it was a brave and
glorious action—that's what I call it—to strike that fel-
low off his horse before their eyes!"
“What fellow? Whose eyes?"
“ What fellow, sir?” cried Joe; a fellow who has no
good-will to you, and who has the daring and deviltry in
him of twenty fellows. I know him of old. Once in
the house, he would have found you, here or anywhere.
The rest owe you no particular grudge, and, unless they
see you, will only think of drinking themselves dead.
But we lose time. Are you ready?”
“Quite,” said Edward. “Put out the torch, Joe, and
go on. And be silent, there's a good fellow.”
“Silent or not silent,” murmured Joe, as he dropped
the flaring link upon the ground, crushed it with his
foot, and gave his hand to Mr. Haredale, “it was a
brave and glorious action; no man can alter that.”
Both Mr. Haredale and the worthy vintner were too
amazed and too much hurried to ask any further ques-
tions, so followed their conductors in silence. It seemed,
from a short whispering which presently ensued between
them and the vintner, relative to the best way of escape,
that they had entered by the back-door, with the con-
nivance of John Grueby, who watched outside with the
key in his pocket, and whom they had taken into their
confidence. A part of the crowd coming up that way,
just as they entered, John had double-locked the door
again, and made off for the soldiers, so that means of
retreat was cut from under them.
However, as the front door had been forced, and this
minor crowd being anxious to get at the liquor, had no
fancy for losing time in breaking down another, but

had gone round and got in from Holborn with the rest,
the narrow lane in the rear was quite free of people.
So, when they had crawled through the passage indicated
by the vintner (which was a mere shelving-trap for the
admission of casks), and had managed with some dif-
ficulty to unchain and raise the door at the upper end,
they emerged into the street without being observed or
interrupted. Joe still holding Mr. Haredale tight, and
Edward taking the same care of the vintner, they hurried
through the streets at a rapid pace; occasionally stand-
ing aside to let some fugitives go by, or to keep out of
the way of the soldiers who followed them, and whose
questions, when they halted to put any, were speedily
stopped by one whispered word from Joe.
CHAPTER X.
WHILE Newgate was burning on the previous night,
Barnaby and his father, having been passed among the
crowd from hand to hand, stood in Smithfield, on the
outskirts of the mob, gazing at the flames like men who
had been suddenly aroused from sleep. Some moments
elapsed before they could distinctly remember where
they were, or how they got there; or recollected that
while they were standing idle and listless spectators of
the fire, they had tools in their hands which had been
hurriedly given them that they might free themselves
from their fetters.
Barnaby, heavily ironed as he was, if he had obeyed
his first impulse, or if he had been alone, would have
made his way back to the side of Hugh, who to his
clouded intellect now shone forth with the new lustre of
being his preserver and truest friend. But his father's
terror of remaining in the streets communicated itself
to him when he comprehended the full extent of his
fears, and impressed him with the same eagernes to fly
to a place of safety.
In a corner of the market, among the pens for cattle,
Barnaby knelt down, and pausing every now and then
to pass his hand over his father's face, or look up to him
with a smile, knocked off his irons. When he had seen
him spring, a free man, to his feet, and had given vent

ooping several e, this

to the transport of delight which the sight awakened,
he went to work upon his own, which soon fell rattling
down upon the ground, and left his limbs unfettered.

ered round a stooping figure to hide him from those who
passed-but unable to repress the clanking sound of
hammers, which told that they too were busy at the
same work—the two fugitives made towards Clerken-
well, and passing thence to Islington, as the nearest
point of egress, were quickly in the fields. After wan-
dering about for a long time, they found in a pasture
near Finchley a poor shed, with walls of mud, and roof
of grass and brambles, built for some cow-herd, but now
deserted. Here they lay down for the rest of the night.
They wandered two and fro when it was day, and once
Barnaby went off alone to a cluster of little cottages
two or three miles away, to purchase some bread and
milk. But finding no better shelter, they returned to
the same place, and lay down again to wait for night.
Heaven alone can tell with what vague thoughts of
duty and affection; with what strange promptings of
nature, intelligible to him as to a man of radiant mind
and most enlarged capacity; with what dim memories of
children he had played with when a child himself, who
had prattled of their fathers, and of loving them, and
being loved; with how many half-remembered, dreamy
associations of his mother's grief and tears and widow-
hood; he watched and tended this man. But that a
vague and shadowy crowd of such ideas came slowly on
him; that they taught him to be sorry when he looked
upon his haggard face, that they overflowed his eyes
when he stooped to kiss him, that they kept him waking
in a tearful gladness, shading him from the sun, fanning
him with leaves, soothing him when he started in his
sleep-ah! what a troubled sleep it was and wondering
when she would come to join them and be happy, is the
truth. He sat beside him all that day; listening for her
footsteps in every breath of air, looking for her shadow
on the gently waving grass, twiring the hedge flowers
for her pleasure when she came, and his when he awoke;
and stooping down from time to time to listen to his mut-
terings, and wonder why he was so restless in that quiet
place. The sun went down, and night came on, and he

was still quite tranquil; busied with these thoughts, às
if there were no other people in the world, and the dull
cloud of smoke hanging on the immense city in the dis-
tance, hid no vices, no crimes, no life or death, or cause
of disquiet-nothing but clear air.
But the hour had now come when he must go alone to
find out the blind man (a task that filled him with de-
light), and bring him to that place; taking especial care
that he was not watched or followed on his way back.
He listened to the directions he must observe, repeated
them again and again, and after twice or thrice return-
ing to surprise his father with a light-hearted laugh,
went forth at last upon his errand: leaving Grip, whom
he had carried from the jail in his arms, to his care.
Fleet of foot, and anxious to return, he sped swiftly
on towards the city, but could not reach it before the
fires began, and made the night angry with their dismal
lustre. When he entered the town-it might be that he
was changed by going there without his late compan-
ions, and on no violent errand, or by the beautiful soli.
tude in which he had passed the day, or by the thoughts
that had come upon him—but it seemed peopled by
a legion of devils. This flight and pursuit, this cruel
burning and destroying, these dreadful cries and stun-
ning noises, were they the good lord's noble cause!
Though almost stupefied by the bewildering scene,
still he found the blind man's house. It was shut up
and tenantless. He waited for a long while, but no one
came. At last he withdrew; and as he knew by this
time that the soldiers were firing, and many people must
have been killed, he went down into Holborn, where he
heard the great crowd was, to try if he could find Hugh,
and persuade him to avoid the danger, and return with
him.
If he had been stunned and shocked before, his horror
was increased a thousand-fold when he got into this
vortex of the riot, and not being an actor in the terrible
spectacle, had it all before his eyes. But there, in the
midst, towering above them all, close before the house
they were attacking now, was Hugh on horseback, call-
ing to the rest!
Sickened by the sight surrounding him on every side,
and by the heat and roar, and crash, he forced his way
among the crowd (where many recognised him, and with

shouts pressed back to let him pass), and in time was
nearly up with Hugh, who was savagely threatening
some one, but whom, or what he said, he could not, in
the great confusion, understand. At that moment the
crowd forced their way into the house, and Hugh-it
was impossible to see by what means, in such a con-
course--fell headlong down.
Barnaby was beside him when he staggered to his
feet. It was well he made him hear his voice, or Hugh,
with his uplifted axe, would have cleft his skull in
twain.
“Barnaby-you! Whose hand was that, that struck
me down?”
“Not mine."
“Whose!—I say, whose!” he cried, reeling back, and
looking wildly round. “What are we doing? Where
is he? Show me!”
“You are hurt,” said Barnaby-as indeed he was, in
the head, both by the blow he had received, and by his
horse's hoof. “Come away with me.”
As he spoke, he took the horse's bridle in his hand,
turned him and dragged Hugh several paces. This
brought them out of the crowd, which was pouring from
the street into the vintner's cellars.
“Where's—where's Dennis?” said Hugh, coming to a
stop, and checking Barnaby with his strong arm.
• Where has he been all day? What did he mean by
leaving me as he did, in the jail, last night? Tell me,
you-d'ye hear!”
With a flourish of his dangerous weapon, he fell down
upon the ground like a log. After a minute, though
already frantic with drinking and with the wound in
his head, he crawled to a stream of burning spirit which
was pouring down the kennel, and began to drink at it
as if it were a brook of water.
Barnaby drew him away and forced him to rise.
Though he could neither stand nor walk, he involuntarily
staggered to his horse, climbed upon his back, and
clung there, After vainly attempting to divest the
animal of his clanking trappings, Barnaby sprung up
behind him, snatched the bridle, turned into Leather
Lane, which was close at hand, and urged the frightened
horse into a heavy trot.
He looked back, once, before he left the street; and

looked upon a sight not easily to be erased, even from
his remembrance, so long as he had life.
The vintner's house, with half-a-dozen others near at
hand, was one great, glowing blaze. All night, no one
had essayed to quench the flames or stop their progress;
but now a body of soldiers were actively engaged in
pulling down two old wooden houses, which were every
moment in danger of taking fire, and which could
scarcely fail, if they were left to burn, to extend the
conflagration immensely. The tumbling down of nod-
ding walls and heavy blocks of wood, the hooting and
the execrations of the crowd, the distant firing of other
military detachments, the distracted looks and cries of
those whose habitations were in danger, the hurrying to
and fro of frightened people with their goods; the re-
flections in every quarter of the sky of deep red, soar-
ing flames, as though the last day had come and the
whole universe were burning; the dust, and smoke, and
drift of fiery particles, scorching and kindling all it fell
upon; the hot unwholesome vapour, the blight on every-
thing; the stars, the moon, and very sky obliterated-
made up such a sum of dreariness and ruin, that it
seemed as if the face of Heaven were blotted out, and
night, in its rest and quiet, and softened light, never
could look upon the earth again..
But there was a worse spectacle than this-worse by
far than fire and smoke, or even the rabble's unap-
peasable and maniac rage. The gutters of the street,
and every crack and fissure in the stones, ran with
scorching spirit, which, being dammed up by busy
hands, overflowed the road and pavement, and formed a
great pool in which the people dropped down dead by
dozens. They lay in heaps all round this fearful pond,
husbands and wives, fathers and sons, mothers and
daughters, women with children in their arms and babies
at their breasts, and drank until they died. While some
stooped with their lips to the brink and never raised
their heads again, others sprang up from their fiery
draught, and danced, half in a mad triumph, and half
in the agony of suffocation, until they fell, and steeped
their corpses in the liquor that had killed them. Nor
was even this the worst or most appalling kind of death
that happened on this fatal night. From the burning
cellars, where they drank out of hats, pails, buckets,

tubs, and shoes, some men were drawn, alive, but all
alight from head to foot; who, in their unendurable
anguish and suffering, making for anything that had
the look of water, rolled, hissing, in this hideous lake,
and splashed up liquid fire which lapped in all it met
with as it ran along the surface, and neither spared the
living nor the dead. On this last night of the great riots
--for the last night it was—the wretched victims of a
senseless outcry became themselves the dust and ashes
of the flames they had kindled, and strewed the public
streets of London.
With all he saw in this last glance fixed indelibly
upon his mind, Barnaby hurried from the city which
inclosed such horrors; and holding down his head, that
he might not even see the glare of the fires upon the
quiet landscape, was soon in the still country roads.
He stopped at about half a mile from the shed where
his father lay, and with some difficulty making Hugh
sensible that he must dismount, sunk the horse's furni-
ture in a pool of stagnant water, and turned the animal
loose. That done, he supported his companion as well
as he could, and led him slowly forward.
CHAPTER XI.
It was the dead of night, and very dark, when Bar-
naby, with his stumbling comrade, approached the
place where he left his father; but he could see him
stealing away into the gloom, distrustful even of him,
and rapidly retreating. After calling to him twice or
thrice that there was nothing to fear, but without effect,
he suffered Hugh to sink upon the ground, and followed
to bring him back.
He continued to creep away, until Barnaby was close
upon him; then turned, and said in a terrible, though
suppressed voice:
“Let me go. Do not lay hands upon me. You have
told her; and you and she together have betrayed me!”
Barnaby looked at him in silence.
“You have seen your mother!”
“No,” cried Barnaby, eagerly. “Not for a long time

-longer than I can tell. A whole year, I think. Is she
here?
His father looked upon him steadfastly for a few
minutes, and then said-drawing nearer to him as he
spoke, for, seeing his face, and hearing his words, it
was impossible to doubt his truth:
" What man is that?"
“ Hugh-Hugh. Only Hugh. You know him. He
will not harm you. Why, you're afraid of Hugh! Ha,
ha, ha! Afraid of gruff, old, noisy Hugh!"
“What man is he, I ask you?" he rejoined, so fiercely
that Barnaby stopped in his laugh, and shrinking back,
surveyed him with a look of terrified amazement.
“ Why, how stern you are! You make me fear you,
though you are my father. Why do you speak to me
so?"
-“I want,” he answered, putting away the hand
which his son, with a timid desire to propitiate him,
laid upon his sleeve—“I want an answer, and you give
me only jeers and questions. Who have you brought
with you to this hiding-place, poor fool; and where is
the blind man?”
“I don't know where. His house was close shut. I
waited, but no person came; that was no fault of mine.
This is Hugh-brave Hugh, who broke into that ugly
jail, and set us free. Aha! You like him now, do you?
You like him now!"
“Why does he lie upon the ground?”
“He has had a fall, and has been drinking. The fields
and trees go round, and round, and round with him, and
the ground heaves under his feet. You know him?
You remember? See!”
They had by this time returned to where he lay, and
both stooped over him to look into his face.
“I recollect the man,” his father murmured. “Why
did you bring him here?”
“Because he would have been killed if I had left him
over yonder. They were firing guns and shedding blood.
Does the sight of blood turn you sick, father? I see it
does by your face. That's like me—what are you look-
ing at?"
“At nothing!" said the murderer softly, as he started
back a pace or two, and gazed with sunken jaw and
staring eyes above his son's head, “At nothing!”

He remained in the same attitude and with the same
expression on his face for a minute or more; then glanced
slowly round as if he had lost something; and went shiv-
ering back towards the shed.
“Shall I bring him in, father?” asked Barnaby, who
had looked on wondering.
He only answered with a suppressed groan, and lying
down upon the ground, wrapped his cloak about his
head, and shrunk into the darkest corner.
Finding that nothing would rouse Hugh now, or
make him sensible for a moment, Barnaby dragged
him along the grass, and laid him on a little heap of
refuse hay and straw which had been his own bed;
first having brought some water from a running stream
hard by, and washed his wound, and laved his hands
and face. Then he lay down himself, between the two,
to pass the night; and looking at the stars fell fast
asleep.
Awakened early in the morning, by the sunshine and
the songs of birds, and hum of insects, he left them
sleeping in the hut, and walked into the sweet and
pleasant air. But he felt that on his jaded senses, op-
pressed and burdened with the dreadful scenes of last
night, and many nights before, all the beauties of open-
ing day, which he had so often tasted, and in which he
had had such deep delight, fell heavily. He thought of
the blithe mornings when he and the dogs went bound-
ing on together through the woods and fields; and the
recollection filled his eyes with tears. He had no con-
sciousness, God help him, of having done wrong, nor
had he any new perception of the merits of the cause in
which he had been engaged, or those of the men who
advocated it; but he was full of cares now, and regrets,
and dismal recollections, and wishes (quite unknown to
him before) that this or that event had never happened,
and that the sorrow and suffering of so many people
had been spared. And now he began to think how
happy they would be-his father, mother, he, and Hugh
-if they rambled away together, and lived in some
lonely place, where there were none of these troubles;
and that perhaps the blind man, who had talked so
wisely about gold, and told him of the great secrets he
knew, could teach them how to live without being
pinched by want. As this occurred to him, he was the

more sorry that he had not seen him last night; and he
was still brooding over this regret, when his father
came, and touched him on the shoulder.
“Ah!” cried Barnaby, starting from his fit of thought-
fulness. “Is it only you?”
“Who should it be?”
“I almost thought,” he answered, “it was the blind
man. I must have some talk with him, father.”
“And so must I, for without seeing him I don't know
where to fly or what to do, and lingering here is death.
You must go to him again, and bring him here.”
“Must I!” cried Barnaby, delighted; “that's brave,
father. That's what I want to do.”
: “But you must bring only him, and none other. And
though you wait at his door a whole day and night,
still you must wait, and not come back without him.”
“Don't you fear that,” he cried, gaily. “He shall,
come, he shall come.”
“ Trim off these gewgaws,” said his father, plucking
the scraps of ribbon and the feathers from his hat, “and
over your own dress wear my cloak. Take heed how
you go, and they will be too busy in the streets to notice
vou. Of your coming back you need take no account,
for he'll manage that safely."
“ To be sure!” said Barnaby. “To be sure he will! A
wise man, father, and one who can teach us to be rich !
Oh! I know him, I know him.”
He was speedily dressed, and as well disguised as he
could be. With a lighter heart he then set off upon his
second journey, leaving Hugh, who was still in a
drunken stupor, stretched upon the ground within the
shed, and his father walking to and fro before it.
The murderer, full of anxious thoughts, looked after
him, and paced up and down, disquieted by every breath
of air that whispered among the boughs, and by every
light shadow thrown by the passing clouds upon the
daisied ground. He was anxious for his safe return,
and yet, though his own life and safety hung upon it,
felt å relief while he was gone. In the intense selfish-
ness which the constant presence before him of his great
crimes, and their consequences here and hereafter,
engendered every thought of Barnaby, as his son,
was swallowed up and lost. Still, his presence was a
torture and reproach; in his wild eyes there were ter-

rible images of that guilty night; with his unearthly
aspect, and his half-formed mind, he seemed to the
murderer a creature who had sprung into existence from
his victim's blood. He could not bear his look, his voice,
his touch; and yet he was forced, by his own desperate
condition and his only hope of cheating the gibbet, to
have him by his side, and to know that he was insep-
arable from his single chance of escape.
He walked to and fro, with little rest, all day, revolv-
ing these things in his mind; and still Hugh lay, uncon-
scious, in the shed. At length, when the sun was setting,
Barnaby returned, leading the blind man, and talking
earnestly to him as they came along together.
The murderer advanced to meet them, and bidding his
son go on and speak to Hugh, who had just then stag-
gered to his feet, took his place at the blind man's elbow,
and slowly followed towards the shed.
“Why did you send him?” said Stagg. “Don't you
know it was the way to have him lost, as soon as found?”
“Would you have had me come myself?" returned the
other.
“Humph! Perhaps not. I was before the jail on
Tuesday night, but missed you in the crowd. I was out
last night, too. There was good work last night-gay
work--profitable work”-he added, rattling the money
in his pockets.
“ Have you—"
-“Seen your good lady? Yes.”
“Do you mean to tell me more, or not?”
“I'll tell you all," returned the blind man, with a
laugh. “Excuse me-but I love to see you so impatient.
There's energy in it."
“Does she consent to say the word that may save me?"
“No," returned the blind man, emphatically, as he
turned his face towards him. “No. Thus it is. She
has been at death's door since she lost her darling-has
been insensible, and I know not what. I tracked her to
a hospital, and presented myself (with your leave) at
her bed-side. Our talk was not a long one, for she was
weak, and there being people near, I was not quite easy.
But I told her all that you and I agreed upon, and pointed
out the young gentleman's position in strong terms.
She tried to soften me, but that, of course (as I told her),
was lost time. She cried and moaned, you may be sure;

all women do. Then, of a sudden, she found her voice
and strength, and said that Heaven would help her and
her innocent son; and that to Heaven she appealed
against us—which she did; in really very pretty lan-
guage, I assure you. I advised her, as a friend, not to
count too much on assistance from any such distant
quarter-recommended her to think of it-told her where
I lived—said I knew she would send to me before noon,
next day—and left her, either in a faint or shamming."
When he had concluded this narration, during which
he had made several pauses, for the convenience of
cracking and eating nuts, of which he seemed to have
a pocketful, the blind man pulled a flask from his pocket,
took a draught himself, and offered it to his companion.
“You won't, won't you?” he said, feeling that he
pushed it from him. “Well! Then the gallant gentle-
man who's lodging with you will. Hallo, bully!"
“Death!” said the other, holding him back. “ Will
you tell me what I am to do!"
“Do! Nothing easier. Make a moonlight flitting in
two hours' time with the young gentleman (he's quite
ready to go; I have been giving him good advice as we
came along), and get as far from London as you can.
Let me know where you are, and leave the rest to me.
She must come round; she can't hold out long; and as
to the chances of your being retaken in the meanwhile,
why, it wasn't one man who got out of Newgate, but
three hundred. Think of that, for your comfort.”
“ We must support life. How?”
“How!” repeated the blind man. “By eating and
drinking. And how get meat and drink, but by paying
for it! Money!” he cried, slapping his pocket. “Is money
the word? Why, the streets have been running money.
Devil send that the sport's not over yet, for these are
jolly times ; golden, rare, roaring, scrambling times.
Hallo, bully! Hallo! HalloDrink, bully, drink. Where
are ye there! Hallo!”
With such vociferations, and with a boisterous manner
which bespoke his perfect abandonment to the general
licence and disorder, he groped his way towards the
shed, where Hugh and Barnaby were sitting on the
ground.
"Put it about!” he cried, handing his flask to Hugh.
“The kennels run with wine and gold. Guinéas and

strong water flow from the very pumps. About with it,
don't spare it!".
Exhausted, unwashed, unshorn, begrimed with smoke
and dust, his hair clotted with blood, his voice quite
gone, so that he spoke in whispers; his skin parched up
by fever, his whole body bruised and cut and beaten
about, Hugh still took the flask, and raised it to his lips.
He was in the act of drinking, when the front of the
shed was suddenly darkened, and Dennis stood before
them.
“No offence, no offence," said that personage in a
conciliatory tone, as Hugh stopped in his draught, and
eyed him, with no pleasant look, from head to foot.
“No offence, brother. Barnaby here too, eh? How are
you, Barnaby? And two other gentlemen! Your humble
servant gentlemen. No offence to you either, I hope.
Eh, brothers?”
Notwithstanding that he spoke in this very friendly
and confident manner, he seemed to have considerable
hesitation about entering, and remained outside the roof.
He was rather better dressed than usual: wearing the
same suit of thread-bare black, it is true, but having round
his neck an unwholesome-looking cravat of yellowish
white; and, on his hands, great leather gloves, such as a
gardener might wear in following his trade. His shoes
were newly greased, and ornamented with a pair of rusty
iron buckles; the pack-thread at his knees had been re-
newed; and where he wanted buttons, he wore pins.
Altogether, he had something the look of a tipstaff, or a
bailiff's follower, desperately faded, but who had a no-
tion of keeping up the appearance of a professional char-
acter, and making the best of the worst means.
“ You're very snug here,” said Mr. Dennis, pulling
out a mouldy pocket-handkerchief, which looked like a
decomposed halter, and wiping his forehead in a nervous
manner.
“Not snug enough to prevent your finding us, it
seems,” Hugh answered, sulkily.
“Why, I'll tell you what, brother,” said Dennis, with
a friendly smile, - when you don't want me to know
which way you're riding, you must wear another sort of
bells on your horse. Ah! I know the sound of them you
wore last night, and have got quick ears for 'em; that's
the truth. Well, but how are you, brother?”

BARNABY RUDGE.
He had by this time approached, and now ventured to
sit down by him.
“How am I?" answered Hugh. “Where were you
yesterday? Where did you go when you left me in the
jail? Why did you leave me? And what did you mean
by rolling your eyes and shaking your fist at me, eh?"
"I shake my fist!-at you, brother,” said Dennis,
gently checking Hugh's uplifted hand, which looked
threatening.
" Your stick, then; it's all one."
Lord love you, brother, I meant nothing. You don't
understand me by half. I shouldn't wonder now,” he
added, in the tone of a desponding and an injured man,
“but you thought, because I wanted them chaps left in
the prison, that I was going to desert the banners?"
Hugh told him, with an oath, that he had thought so.
“ Well!” said Mr. Dennis, mournfully, “if you an't
enough to make a man mistrust his feller-creeturs, I
don't know what is. Desert the banners! Me! Ned
Dennis, as was so christened by his own father!—Is this
axe your'n, brother?”
“Yes, it's mine," said Hugh, in the same sullen man-
ner as before; “it might have hurt you if you had come
in its way once or twice last night. Put it down.”
“Might have hurt me!” said Mr. Dennis, still keeping
it in his hand, and feeling the edge with an air of
abstraction. "Might have hurt me! and me exerting
myself all the time to the werry best advantage. Here's
a world! And you're not a going to ask me to take a
sup out of that 'ere bottle, eh?"
Hugh passed it towards him. As he raised it to his
lips, Barnaby jumped up, and motioning them to be
silent, looked eagerly out.
“What's the matter, Barnaby?” said Dennis, glancing
at Hugh and dropping the flask, but still holding the
axe in his hand.
“Hush!” he answered softly. “What do I see glitter-
ing behind the hedge?”
• What!” cried the hangman, raising his voice to its
highest pitch, and laying hold of him and Hugh. “Not
-not soldiers, surely!”
That moment the shed was filled with armed men;
and a body of horse galloping into the field, drew up
before it.


## p. 89 (#587) #############################################

BARNABY RUDGE.
"There!” said Dennis, who remained untouched among
them when they had seized their prisoners; “it's them
two young ones, gentlemen, that the proclamation puts
a price on. This other's an escaped felon. I'm sorry
for it, brother,” he added, in a tone of resignation, ad-
dressing himself to Hugh; “but you've brought it on
yourself; you forced me to do it; you wouldn't respect
the soundest constitootional principles, you know; you
went and wiolated the werry framework of society. I had
sooner have given away a trifle in charity than done
this, I would upon my soul. If you'll keep fast hold on
’em, gentlemen, I think I can make a shift to tie 'em
better than you can.”
But this operation was postponed for a few moments
by a new occurrence. The blind man, whose ears were
quicker than most people's sight, had been alarmed, be-
fore Barnaby, by a rustling in the bushes, under cover
of which the soldiers had advanced. He retreated in-
stantly-had hidden somewhere for a minute-and
probably in his confusion mistaking the point at which
he had emerged, was now seen running across the open
meadow.
An officer cried directly that he had helped to plunder
a house last night. He was loudly called on to surren-
der. He ran the harder, and in a few seconds would
have been out of gun-shot. The word was given and
the men fired.
There was a breathless pause and a profound silence,
during which all eyes were fixed upon him. He had
been seen to start at the discharge, as if the report
had frightened him. But he neither stopped nor slack-
ened his pace in the least, and ran on full forty
yards further. Then, without one reel or stagger,
or sign of faintness or quivering of any limb, he
dropped.
Some of them hurried up to where he lay—the hang-
man with them. Everything had passed so quickly that
the smoke was not yet scattered, but curled slowly off
in a little cloud, which seemed like the dead man's spirit
moving solemnly away. There were a few drops of
blood upon the grass-more when they turned him over
—that was all.
“Look here! Look here!” said the hangman, stoop-
ing one knee beside the body, and gazing up with a dis-

consolate face at the officer and men! "Here's a pretty
sight!"
* Stand out of the way," replied the officer. “Ser-
jeant! see what he had about him.”
The man turned his pockets out upon the grass, and
counted, besides some foreign coins and two rings, five-
and-forty guineas in gold. These were bundled up in
a handkerchief and carried away; the body remained
there for the present, but six men and the serjeant were
left to take it to the nearest public-house.
“Now then, if you're going,” said the serjeant, clap-
ping Dennis on the back, and pointing after the officer
who was walking towards the shed.
To which Mr. Dennis only replied, “Don't talk to me!"
and then repeated what he had said before, namely,
“Here's a pretty sight!"
“It's not one that you care for much, I should think,"
observed the serjeant coolly.
“Why, who," said Mr. Dennis, rising, “should care
for it if I don't?”
“Oh! I didn't know you was so tender-hearted,” said
the serjeant. “That's all!”
“Tender-hearted!" echoed Dennis. “Tender-hearted!
Look at this man. Do you call this constitootional? Do
you see him shot through and through instead of being
worked off like a Briton? Damme, if I know which
party to side with. You're as bad as the other. What's
to become of the country if the military power's to go a
superseding the ciwilians in this way? Where's this poor
fellow-creetur's rights as a citizen, that he didn't have
me in his last moments! I was here. I was willing.
I was ready. These are nice times, brother, to have
the dead crying out against us in this way, and
sleep comfortably in our beds arterwards; werry
nice!”
Whether he derived any material consolation from
binding the prisoners, is uncertain; most probably he
did. At all events, his being summoned to that work
diverted him, for the time, from these painful reflec-
tions, and gave his thoughts a more congenial occupa-
tion.
They were not all three carried off together, but in two
parties; Barnaby and his father going by one road in
the centre of a body of foot; and Hugh, fast bound upon

a horse, and strongly guarded by a troop of cavalry, be-
ing taken by another.
They had no opportunity for the least communication,
in the short interval which preceded their departure; be-
ing kept strictly apart. Hugh only observed that Bar-
naby walked with a drooping head among his guard,
and, without raising his eyes, that he tried to wave his
fettered hand when he passed. For himself, he buoyed
up his courage as he rode along, with the assurance that
the mob would force his jail wherever it might be, and
set him at liberty. But when they got into London, and
more especially into Fleet Market, lately the stronghold
of the rioters, where the military were rooting out the
last remnant of the crowd, he saw that this hope was
gone, and felt that he was riding to his death.
CHAPTER XII.
MR. DENNIS having despatched this piece of business
without any personal hurt or inconvenience, and having
now retired into the tranquil respectability of private
life, resolved to solace himself with half an hour or so of
female society. With this amiable purpose in his mind,
he bent his steps towards the house where Dolly and
Miss Haredale were still confined, and whither Miss
Miggs had also been removed by order of Mr. Simon
Tappertit.
As he walked along the streets with his leather gloves
clasped behind him, and his face indicative of cheerful
thought and pleasant calculation, Mr. Dennis might have
been likened unto a farmer ruminating among his crops,
and enjoying by anticipation the bountiful gifts of
Providence. Look where he would, some heap of ruins
afforded him rich promise of a working off; the whole
town appeared to have been ploughed, and sown, and
nurtured by most genial weather; and a goodly harvest
was at hand.
Having taken up arms and resorted to deeds of vio-
lence, with the great main object of preserving the Old
Bailey in all its purity, and the gallows in all its pristine
usefulness and moral grandeur, it would perhaps be
going too far to assert that Mr. Dennis had ever dis-

tinctly contemplated and foreseen this happy state of
things. He rather looked upon it as one of those beau-
tiful dispensations which are inscrutably brought about
for the behoof and advantage of good men. He felt, as
it were, personally referred to, in this prosperous ripen-
ing for the gibbet; and had never considered himself so
much the pet and favourite child of destiny, or loved
that lady so well, or with such a calm and virtuous re-
liance, in all his life.
As to being taken up himself for a rioter, and pun-
ished with the rest, Mr. Dennis dismissed that possibility
from his thoughts as an idle chimera; arguing that the
line of conduct he had adopted at Newgate, and the ser-
vice he had rendered that day, would be more than a
set-off against any evidence which might identify him
as a member of the crowd. That any charge of com-
panionship which might be made against him by those
who were themselves in danger would certainly go for
nought. And that if any trivial indiscretion on his part
should unluckily come out, the uncommon usefulness of
his office, at present, and the great demand for the exer-
cise of its functions, would certainly cause it to be
winked at and passed over. In a word, he had played
his cards throughout with great care; had changed sides
at the very nick of time; had delivered up two of the
most notorious rioters, and a distinguished felon to boot;
and was quite at his ease.
Saving—for there is a reservation; and even Mr.
Dennis was not perfectly happy-saving for one circum-
stance; to wit, the forcible detention of Dolly and Miss
Haredale in a house almost adjoining his own. This
was a stumbling block; for if they were discovered and
released they could, by the testimony they had in their
power to give, place him in a situation of great jeopardy;
and to set them at liberty, first extorting from them an
oath of secrecy and silence, was a thing not to be thought
of. It was more, perhaps, with an eye to the danger
which lurked in this quarter than from his abstract love
of conversation with the sex, that the hangman, quick-
ening his steps, now hastened into their society, cursing
the amourous natures of Hugh and Mr. Tappertit with
great heartiness at.every step he took. .

were confined, Dolly and Miss Haredale withdrew in

silence to the remotest corner. But Miss Miggs, who
was particularly tender of her reputation, immediately
fell upon her knees and began to scream very loud,
crying, “What will become of me!”—“ Where is my
Simmuns!”—“Have mercy, good gentleman, on my
sex's weaknesses!" —with other doleful lamentations of
that nature, which she delivered with great propriety
and decorum.
“Miss, miss,” whispered Dennis, beckoning to her
with his forefinger, “come here—I won't hurt you.
Come here, my lamb, will you?”
On hearing this tender epithet, Miss Miggs, who had
left off screaming when he opened his lips, and had
listened to him attentively, began again: crying, “Oh,
I'm his lamb. He says I'm his lamb! Oh, gracious,
why wasn't I born old and ugly! Why was I ever made
to be the youngest of six, and all of 'em dead and in
their blessed graves, excepting one married sister,
which is settled in Golden Lion Court, number twenty-
sivin, second bell-handle on the-!"
“Don't I say I an't going to hurt you?” said Dennis,
pointing to a chair. - Why, miss, what's the matter?”
“I don't know what mayn't be the matter!” cried
Miggs, clasping her hands distractedly. “Anything
may be the matter!"
“But nothing is, I tell you,” said the hangman. “First
stop that noise, and come ard sit down here, will you,
chuckey?"
The coaxing tone in which he said these latter words
might have failed in its object, if he had not accompa-
nied them with sundry sharp jerks of his thumb over
one shoulder, and with divers winks and thrustings of
his tongue into his cheek, from which signals the damsel
gathered that he sought to speak to her apart concern-
ing Miss Haredale and Dolly. Her curiosity being very
powerful, and her jealousy by no means inactive, she
arose, and with a great deal of shivering and starting
back, and much muscular action among all the small
bones in her throat, gradually approached him,
“Sit down,” said the hangman.
Suiting the action to the word, he thrust her rather
suddenly and prematurely into a chair; and designing
to reassure her by a little harmless jocularity, such as
įs adapted to please and fascinate the sex, converted his

right forefinger into an ideal bradawl or gimlet, and
made as though he would screw the same into her side
-whereat Miss Miggs shrieked again, and evinced
symptoms of faintness.
"Lovey, my dear,” whispered Dennis, drawing his
chair close to hers. “When was your young man here
last, eh?”
“ My young man, good gentleman!" answered Miggs
in a tone of exquisite distress.
“Ah! Simmuns, you know-himı?” said Dennis.
“ Mine indeed!” cried Miggs, with a burst of bitter-
ness—and as she said it, she glanced towards Dolly.
“ Mine, good gentleman!”.
This was just what Mr. Dennis wanted, and expected.
66 Ah !” he said, looking so soothingly, not to say
amourously on Miggs, that she sat, as she afterwards re-
marked, on pins and needles of the sharpest Whitechapel
kind, not knowing what intentions might be suggesting
that expression to his features: “I was afraid of that.
I saw as much, myself. It's her fault. She will entice
'em.”
“I wouldn't," cried Miggs, folding her hands and look-
ing upwards with a kind of devout blankness, “I
wouldn't lay myself out as she does; I wouldn't be as
bold as her; I wouldn't seem to say to all male creeturs
come and kiss me'”—and here a shudder quite con-
vulsed her frame—“ for any earthly crowns as might be
offered. Worlds,” Miggs added solemnly, “should not
reduce me. No. Not if I was Wenis.”
“Well, but you are Wenus, you know," said Mr.
Dennis, confidentially
“No, I am not, good gentleman," answered Miggs,
shaking her head with an air of self-denial which
seemed to imply that she might be if she chose, but she
hoped she knew better. "No, I am not, good gentle-
man. Don't charge me with it.”
Up to this time she had turned round, every now and
then, to where Dolly and Miss Haredale had retierd,
and uttered a scream, or groan, or laid her hand upon
her heart and trembled excessively, with a view of
keeping up appearances, and giving them to understand
that she conversed with the visitor, under protest and
on compulsion, and at a great personal sacrifice for
their common good. But at this point, Mr. Dennis

looked so very full of meaning, and gave such a sin-
gularly expressive twitch to his face as a request to her
to come still nearer to him, that she abandoned these
little arts, and gave him her whole and undivider
attention.
“When was Simmuns here, I say?" quoth Dennis, in
her ear.
“ Not since yesterday morning; and then only for a
few minutes. Not all day, the day before.”
“You know he meant all along to carry off that one?”
said Dennis, indicating Dolly by the slightest possible
jerk of his head. “And to hand you over to somebody
else.”
Miss Miggs, who had fallen into a terrible state of
grief when the first part of this sentence was spoken, re-
covered a little at the second, and seemed by the sudden
check she put upon her tears to intimate that possibly
this arrangement might meet her views; and that it
might, perhaps, remain an open question.
“-But unfort'nately," pursued Dennis, who observed
this: “somebody else was fond of her too, you see; and
even if he wasn't, somebody else is took for a rioter, and
it's all over with him.”
Miss Miggs relapsed.
“Now I want,” said Dennis, “to clear this house, and
to see you righted. What if I was to get her off, out of
the way, eh
Miss Miggs, brightening again, rejoined, with many
breaks and pauses from excess of feeling, that tempta-
tions had been Simmuns's bane. That it was not his
faults, but hers (meaning Dolly's). That men did not
see through these dreadful arts as women did, and there-
fore was caged and trapped, as Simmun had been. That
she had no personal motives to serve far from it-on the
contrary, her intentions was good towards all parties.
But forasmuch as she knowed that Simmun, if united
to any designing and artful minxes (she would name no
names, for that was not her dispositions)—to any design-
ing and artful minxes-must be made miserable and un-
happy for life, she did incline towards prewentions.
Such, she added, was her free confessions. But as this
was private feelings, and might perhaps be looked upon
as wengeance, she begged the gentleman would say no
more. Whatever he said, wishing to do her duty by all

mankind, even by them as had ever been her bitterest
enemies, she would not listen to him. With that she
stopped her ears, and shook her head from side to side,
to intimate to Mr. Dennis that though he talked until he
had no breath left, she was as deaf as any adder.
“Lookee here, my sugar-stick," said Mr. Dennis, “if
your view's the same as mine, and you'll only be quiet
and slip away at the right time, I can have the house
clear to-morrow, and be out of this trouble. Stop,
though! there's the other.”
“ Which other, sir?” asked Miggs-still with her fin-
gers in her ears and her head shaking obstinately.
“Why, the tallest one, yonder,” said Dennis, as he
stroked his chin, and added, in an undertone to himself,
something about not crossing Muster Gashford.
Miss Miggs replied (still being profoundly deaf) that if
Miss Haredale stood in the way at all, he might make
himself quite easy on that score, as she had gathered,
from what passed between Hugh and Mr. Tappertit
when they were last there, that she was to be removed
alone (not by them, but by somebody else) to-morrow
night.
Mr. Dennis opened his eyes very wide at this piece of
information, whistled once, considered once, and finally
slapped his head once and nodded once, as if he had got
the clue to this mysterious removal, and so dismissed it,
Then he imparted his design concerning Dolly to Miss
Miggs, who was taken more deaf than before, when he
began; and so remained, all through.
The notable scheme was this: Mr. Dennis was immedi-
ately to seek out from among the rioters some daring
young fellow (and he had one in his eye, he said), who,
terrified by the threats he could hold out to him, and
alarmed by the capture of so many who were no better
and no worse than he, would gladly avail himself of
any help to get abroad, and out of harm's way, with his
plunder, even though his journey were incumbered by
an unwilling companion; indeed, the unwilling com-
panion being a beautiful girl, would probably be an addi-
tional inducement and temptation. Such a person found,
he proposed to bring him there on the ensuing night,
when the tall one was taken off, and Miss Miggs had
purposely retired; and then that Dolly should be gagged,
muffled in a cloak, and carried in any handy convey-

gry
ance down to the river's side; where there were abund-
ant means of getting her smuggled snugly off in any
small craft of doubtful character, and no questions
asked. With regard to the expense of this removal, he
would say, at a rough calculation, that two or three
silver tea or coffee pots, with something additional for
drink (such as a muffineer, or toast-rack), would more
than cover it. Articles of plate of every kind having
been buried by the rioters in several lonely parts of
London, and particularly, as he knew, in St. James's
Square, which, though easy of access, was little fre-
quented after dark, and had a convenient piece of water
in the midst, the needful funds were close at hand, and
could be had upon the shortest notice. With regard to
Dolly, the gentleman would exercise his own discretion.
He would be bound to do nothing but to take her away,
and keep her away. All other arrangements and dis-
positions would rest entirely with himself.
If Miss Miggs had had her hearing, no doubt she
would have been greatly shocked by the indelicacy of a
young female's going away with a stranger, by night
(for her moral feelings, as we have said, were of the
tenderest kind); but directly Mr. Dennis ceased to speak,
she reminded him that he had only wasted breath. She
then went on to say (still with her fingers in her ears)
that nothing less than a severe practical lesson would
save the locksmith's daughter from utter ruin; and that
she felt it, as it were, a moral obligation and a sacred
duty to the family, to wish that some one would devise
one for her reformation. Miss Miggs remarked, and
very justly, as an abstract sentiment which happened
to occur to her at the moment, that she dared to say
the locksmith and his wife would murmur and repine,
if they were ever, by forcible abduction or otherwise.
to lose their child; but that we seldom knew, in this
world, what was best for us: such being our sinful and
imperfect natures, that very few arrived at that clear
understanding.
Having brought their conversation to this satisfactory
end, they parted: Dennis, to pursue his design and take
another walk about his farm; Miss Miggs, to launch,
when he left her, into such a burst of mental anguish
(which she gave them to understand was occasioned by
certain tender things he had had the presumption and

audacity to say), that little Dolly's heart was quite
melted. Indeed, she said and did so much to soothe the
outraged feelings of Miss Miggs, and looked so beautiful
while doing so, that if that young maid had not had
ample vent for her surpassing spite, in a knowledge of
the mischief that was brewing, she must have scratched
her features on the spot.
CHAPTER XIII.
ALL next day, Emma Haredale, Dolly, and Miggs, re-
mained cooped up together in what had now been their
prison for so many days, without seeing any person, or
hearing any sound but the murmured conversation, in
an outer room, of the men who kept watch over them.
There appeared to be more of these fellows than there
had been hitherto; and they could no longer hear the
voices of women, which they had before plainly dis-
tinguished. Some new excitement, too, seemed to pre-
vail among them; for there was much stealthy going in
and out, and a constant questioning of those who were
newly arrived. They had previously been quite reckless
in their behaviour; often making a great uproar; quarrel-
ling among themselves, fighting, dancing, and singing.
They were now very subdued and silent, conversing
almost in whispers, and stealing in and out with a soft
and stealthy tread, very different from the boisterous
trampling in which their arrivals and departures had
hitherto been announced to the trembling captives.
Whether this change was occasioned by the presence
among them of some person of authority in their ranks,
or by any other cause, they were unable to decide.
Sometimes they thought it was in part attributable to
there being a sick man in the chamber, for last night
there had been a shuffling of feet, as though a burden
were brought in, and afterwards a moaning noise. But
they had no means of ascertaining the truth; for any
question or entreaty on their parts only provoked a
storm of execrations, or something worse; and they
were too happy to be left alone, unassailed by threats or
admiration, to risk even that comfort, by any voluntary
communication with those who held them in durance.

It was sufficiently evident, both to Emma and to the
locksmith's poor little daughter herself, that she, Dolly,
was the great object of attraction; and that so soon as
they should have leisure to indulge in the softer passion,
Hugh and Mr. Tappertit would certainly fall to blows
for her sake; in which latter case it was not very diffi-
cult to foresee whose prize she would become. With all
her old horror of that man revived, and deepened into a
degree of aversion and abhorrence which no language
can describe; with a thousand old recollections and re-
grets, and causes of distress, anxiety, and fear, besetting
her on all sides; poor Dolly Varden-sweet, blooming,
buxom Dolly-began to hang her head, and fade, and
droop, like a beautiful flower. The colour fled from her
cheeks, her courage forsook her, her gentle heart failed.
Unmindful of all her provoking caprices, forgetful of
all her conquests and inconstancy, with all her winning
little vanities quite gone, she nestled all the livelong
day in Emma Haredale's bosom; and sometimes calling
on her dear old grey-haired father, sometimes on her
mother, and sometimes even on her old home, pined
slowly away, like a poor bird in its cage.
Light hearts, light hearts, that float so gaily on a
smooth stream, that are so sparkling and buoyant in the
sunshine--down upon fruit, bloom upon flowers, blush
in summer air, life of the winged insect, whose whole
existence is a day-how soon ye sink in troubled water!
Poor Dolly's heart-a little, gentle, idle, fickle thing;
giddy, restless, fluttering; constant to nothing but bright
looks, and smiles, and laughter-Dolly's heart was
breaking
Emma had known grief, and could bear it better. She
had little comfort to impart, but she could soothe and
tend her, and she did so; and Dolly clung to her like a
child to its nurse. In endeavouring to inspire her with
some fortitude, she increased her own; and though the
nights were long and the days dismal, and she felt the
wasting influence of watching and fatigue, and had per-
haps a more defined and clear perception of their desti-
tute condition and its worst dangers, she uttered no com-
plaint. Before the ruffians, in whose power they were,
she bore herself so calmly, and with such an appearance,
in the midst of all her terror, of a secret conviction that
they dared not harm her, that there was not a man

among them but held her in some degree of dread; and
more than one believed she had a weapon hidden in her
dress, and was prepared to use it.
Such was their condition when they were joined by
Miss Miggs, who gave them to understand that she too
had been taken prisoner, because of her charms, and
detailed such feats of resistance she had performed (her
virtue having given her supernatural strength), that
they felt it quite a happiness to have her for a champion.
Nor was this the only comfort they derived at first from
Miggs's presence and society: for that young lady dis-
played such resignation and long-suffering, and so much
meek endurance, under her trials, and breathed in all
her chaste discourse a spirit of such holy confidence
and resignation, and devout belief that all would hap-
pen for the best, that Emma felt her courage strength-
ened by the bright example; never doubting but that
everything she said was true, and that she, like them,
was torn from all she loved, and agonised by doubt and
apprehension. As to poor Dolly, she was roused, at first,
by seeing one who came from home; but when she
heard under what circumstances she had left it, and into
whose hands her father had fallen, she wept more bit-
terly than ever, and refused all comfort.
Miss Miggs was at some trouble to reprove her for this
state of mind, and to entreat her to take example by
herself, who, she said, was now receiving back, with
interest, tenfold the amount of her subscriptions to the
red-brick dwelling-house, in the articles of peace of
mind and a quiet conscience. And, while on serious
topics, Miss Miggs considered it her duty to try her hand
at the conversion of Miss Haredale; for whose improve-
ment she launched into a polemical address at some
length, in the course whereof she likened herself unto
a chosen missionary, and that young lady to a cannibal
in darkness. Indeed she returned so often to these sub-
jects, and so frequently called upon them to take a
lesson from her-at the same time vaunting and, as it
were, rioting in, her huge unworthiness, and abundant
excess of sin—that, in the course of a short time, she
became, in that small chamber, rather a nuisance than
a comfort, and rendered them, if possible, even more
unhappy than they had been before.
The night had now come; and for the first time (for

their jailers had been regular in bringing food and
candles), they were left in darkness. Any change in
their condition in such a place inspired new fears; and
when some hours had passed, and the gloom was still
unbroken, Emma could no longer repress her alarm.
They listened attentively. There was the same mur-
muring in the outer room, and now and then a moan
which seemed to be wrung from a person in great pain,

these men seemed to be in darkness too; for no light
shone through the chinks in the door, nor were they
moving, as their custom was, but quite still: the silence
being unbroken by so much as the creaking of a
board.
At first Miss Miggs wondered greatly in her own mind
who this sick person might be; but arriving, on second
thoughts, at the conclusion that he was a part of the
schemes on foot, and an artful device soon to be employed
with great success, she opined, for Miss Haredale's com-
fort, that it must be some misguided Papist who had
been wounded: and this happy supposition encouraged
her to say, under her breath, “ Ally Looyer!” several
times.
“Is it possible,” said Emma, with some indignation,
" that you who have seen these men committing the out-
rages you have told us of, and who have fallen into
their hands, like us, can exult in their cruelties!"
“Personal considerations, miss,” rejoined Miggs,
“sinks into nothing afore a noble cause. Ally Looyer!
Ally Looyer! Ally Looyer, good gentlemen!"
It seemed, from the shrill pertinacity with which Miss
Miggs repeated this form of acclamation, that she was
calling the same through the keyhole of the door; but
in the profound darkness she could not be seen.
“If the time has come-Heaven knows it may come
at any moment—when they are bent on prosecuting the
designs, whatever they may be, with which they have
brought us here, can you still encourage and take part
with them?" demanded Emma.
“I thank my goodness-gracious-blessed-stars I can,
miss,” returned Miggs, with increased energy. “ Ally
Looyer, good gentlemen!"
Even Dolly, cast down and disappointed as she was,
revived at this, and bade Miggs hold her tongue directly.

among them but held her in some degree of dread; and
more than one believed she had a weapon hidden in her
dress, and was prepared to use it.
Such was their condition when they were joined by
Miss Miggs, who gave them to understand that she too
had been taken prisoner, because of her charms, and
detailed such feats of resistance she had performed (her
virtue having given her supernatural strength), that
they felt it quite a happiness to have her for a champion.
Nor was this the only comfort they derived at first from
Miggs's presence and society: for that young lady dis-
played such resignation and long-suffering, and so much
meek endurance, under her trials, and breathed in all
her chaste discourse a spirit of such holy confidence
and resignation, and devout belief that all would hap-
pen for the best, that Emma felt her courage strength-
ened by the bright example; never doubting but that
everything she said was true, and that she, like them,
was torn from all she loved, and agonised by doubt and
apprehension. As to poor Dolly, she was roused, at first,
by seeing one who came from home; but when she
heard under what circumstances she had left it, and into
whose hands her father had fallen, she wept more bit-
terly than ever, and refused all comfort.
Miss Miggs was at some trouble to reprove her for this
state of mind, and to entreat her to take example by
herself, who, she said, was now receiving back, with
interest, tenfold the amount of her subscriptions to the
red-brick dwelling-house, in the articles of peace of
mind and a quiet conscience. And, while on serious
topics, Miss Miggs considered it her duty to try her hand
at the conversion of Miss Haredale; for whose improve-
ment she launched into a polemical address at some
length, in the course whereof she likened herself unto
a chosen missionary, and that young lady to a cannibal
in darkness. Indeed she returned so often to these sub-
jects, and so frequently called upon them to take a
lesson from her-at the same time vaunting and, as it
were, rioting in, her huge unworthiness, and abundant
excess of sin—that, in the course of a short time, she
became, in that small chamber, rather a nuisance than
a comfort, and rendered them, if possible, even more
unhappy than they had been before.
The night had now come; and for the first time (for

their jailers had been regular in bringing food and
candles), they were left in darkness. Any change in
their condition in such a place inspired new fears; and
when some hours had passed, and the gloom was still
unbroken, Emma could no longer repress her alarm.
They listened attentively. There was the same mur-
muring in the outer room, and now and then a moan
which seemed to be wrung from a person in great pain,
who made an effort to subdue it, but could not. Even
these men seemed to be in darkness too; for no. light
shone through the chinks in the door, nor were they
moving, as their custom was, but quite still: the silence
being unbroken by so much as the creaking of a
board.
At first Miss Miggs wondered greatly in her own mind

“Which was you pleased to observe, Miss Varden?”
said Miggs, with a strong emphasis on the irrelative
pronoun.
Dolly repeated her request.
“Ho, gracious me!" cried Miggs, with hysterical de-
rision. “Ho, gracious me! Yes, to be sure I will. Ho,
yes! I am a abject slave, and a toiling, moiling, con-
stant-working, always-being-found-fault-with, never-
giving-satisfactions, nor-having-no-time-to-clean-one-
self, potter's wessel-an't I, miss! Ho, yes! My situa-
tions is lowly, and my capacities is limited, and my
duties is to humble myself afore the base, degenerating
daughters of their blessed mothers as is fit to keep com-
panies with holy saints but is born to persecutions from
wicked relations—and to demean myself before them as
is no better than Infidels-an't it, miss! Ho, yes! My
only becoming occupations is to help young flaunting
Pagins to brush and comb and titiwate theirselves into
whitening and suppulchres, and leave the young men to
think that there an't a bit of padding in it nor no pinching
ins nor fillings out nor pomatums nor deceits nor earthly
wanities-an't it, miss! Yes, to be sure it is—ho, yes!"
Having delivered these ironical passages with a most
wonderful volubility, and with a shrillness perfectly
deafening (especially when she jerked out the interjec-
tions), Miss Miggs, from mere habit, and not because
weeping was at all appropriate to the occasion, which
was one of triumph, concluded by bursting into a flood
of tears, and calling in an impassioned manner on the
name of Simmuns.
What Emma Haredale and Dolly would have done, or
how long Miss Miggs, now that she had hoisted her
true colours, would have gone on waving them before
their astonished senses, it is impossible to tell. Nor is
it necessary to speculate on these matters, for a startling
interruption occurred at that moment, which took their
whole attention by storm.
This was a violent knocking at the door of the house,
and then its sudden bursting open; which was immedi-
ately succeeded by a scuffle in the room without, and
the clash of weapons. Transported with the hope that
rescue had at length arrived, Emma and Dolly shrieked
aloud for help; nor were their shrieks unanswered; for
after a hurried interval a man, bearing in one hand a

drawn sword, and in the other a taper, rushed into the
chamber where they were confined.
It was some check upon their transport to find in this
person an entire stranger, but they appealed to him,
nevertheless, and besought him, in impassioned lan-
guage, to restore them to their friends.
“For what other purpose am I here?” he answered,
closing the door, and standing with his back against it.
“ With what object have I made my way to this place,
through difficulty and danger, but to preserve you?"
With a joy for which it was impossible to find adequate
expression, they embraced each other, and thanked
Heaven for this most timely aid. Their deliverer stepped
forward for a moment to put the light upon the table,
and immediately returning to his former position against
the door, bared his head, and looked on smilingly.
“You have news of my uncle, sir?" said Emma, turn-
ing hastily towards him.
“And of my father and mother?” added Dolly.
“Yes,” he said. “Good news.”
“They are alive and unhurt?" they both cried at
once.
“Yes, and unhurt,” he rejoined.

“I did not say close at hand," he answered smoothly;
“they are at no great distance. Your friends, sweet
one,” he added, addressing Dolly, “are within a few
hours' journey. You will be restored to them, I hope,
to-night.”
“My uncle, sir_” faltered Emma.
“Your uncle, dear Miss Haredale, happily--I say hap-
pily, because he has succeeded where many of our creed
have failed, and is safe—has crossed the sea, and is out
of Britain."
“I thank God for it,” said Emma, faintly.
“You say well. You have reason to be thankful:
greater reason than it is possible for you, who have seen
but one night of these cruel outrages, to imagine.”
“Does he desire,” said Emma, " that I should follow
him?"
“Do you ask if he desires it?” cried the stranger, in
surprise. “If he desires it! But you do not know the
danger of remaining in England, the difficulty of escape,
or the price hundreds would pay to secure the means,

when you make that inquiry. Pardon me. I had for-
gotten that you could not, being prisoner here.”
“I gather, sir,” said Emma, after a moment's pause,
“from what you hint at, but fear to tell me, that I have
witnessed but the beginning, and the least, of the vio-
lence to which we are exposed, and that it has not yet
slackened in its fury?”
He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, lifted up
his hands; and with the same smooth smile, which was
not a pleasant one to see, cast his eyes upon the ground,
and remained silent.
“ You may venture, sir, to speak plain," said Emma,
“ and to tell me the worst. We have undergone some
preparation for it.”
But here Dolly interposed and entreated her not to
hear the worst, but the best; and besought the gentle-
man to tell them the best, and to keep the remainder of
his news until they were safe among their friends again.
“It is told in three words,” he said, glancing at the
locksmith's daughter with a look of some displeasure.
“The people have risen to a man against us; the streets
are filled with soldiers who support them and do their
bidding. We have no protection but from above, and
no safety but in flight; and that is a poor resource; for
we are watched on every hand, and detained here both
by force and fraud. Miss Haredale, I cannot bear-be-
lieve me, that I cannot bear-by speaking of myself, or
what I have done, or am prepared to do, to seem to
vaunt my services before you. But, having powerful
Protestant connections, and having my whole wealth
embarked with theirs, in shipping and commerce, I hap-
pily possessed the means of saving your uncle. I have
the means of saving you; and in redemption of my
sacred promise, made to him, I am here; pledged not to
leave you until I have placed you in his arms. The
treachery or penitence of one of the men about you led
to the discovery of your place of confinement; and that I
have forced my way here, sword in hand, you see.”
“You bring,” said Emma, faltering, “some note or
token from my uncle?”.
“No, he doesn't,” cried Dolly, pointing at him earn-
estly: “now I am sure he doesn't. Don't go with him
for the world!”
“Hush, pretty fool-be silent,” he replied, frowning

angrily upon her. “No, Miss Haredale, I have no letter
nor any token of any kind; for while I sympathise with
you, and such as you, on whom misfortune so heavy and
so undeserved has fallen, I value my life. I carry,
therefore, no writing which, found upon me, would lead
to its certain loss. I never thought of bringing any other
token, nor did Mr. Haredale think of entrusting me with
one-possibly because he had good experience of my
faith and honesty, and owed his life to me.”
There was a reproof conveyed in these words which,
to a nature like Emma Haredale's, was well addressed.
But Dolly, who was differently constituted, was by no
means touched by it, and still conjured her, in all the
terms of affection and attachment she could think of,
not to be lured away.
“Time presses,” said their visitor, who, although he
sought to express the deepest interest, had something
cold and even in his speech, that grated on the ear; "and
danger surrounds us. . If I have exposed myself to it, in
vain, let it be so; but if you and he should ever meet
again, do me justice. If you decide to remain (as I
think you do), remember, Miss Haredale, that I left you
with a solemn caution, and acquitting myself of all the
consequences to which you expose yourself.”
“Stay, sir!” cried Emma-one moment, I beg you.
Cannot we”—and she drew Dolly closer to her-'cannot
we go together?”
“The task of conveying one female in safety through
such scenes as we must encounter, to say nothing of at-
tracting the attention of those who crowd the streets,”
he answered, “is enough. I have said that she will be
restored to her friends to-night. If you accept the service
I tender, Miss Haredale, she shall be instantly placed in
safe conduct, and that promise redeemed. Do you de-
cide to remain? People of all ranks and creeds are flying
from the town, which is sacked from end to end. Let
me be of use in some quarter. Do you stay or go?”.
“Dolly,” said Emma, in a hurried manner, "my dear
girl, this is our last hope. If we part now, it is only that
we may meet again in happiness and honour. I will
trust to this gentleman.”
“No-no-no!” cried Dolly, clinging to her. “Pray,
pray, do not!"
“You hear,” said Emma, “that to-night-only to-

night--within a few hours-think of that!-you will be
among those who would die of grief to lose you, and
who are now plunged in the deepest misery for your
sake. Pray for me, dear girl, as I will for you; and
never forget the many quiet hours we have passed
together. Say one 'God bless you! Say that at parting!"
But Dolly could say nothing; no, not when Emma
kissed her cheek a hundred times, and covered it with
tears, could she do more than hang upon her neck, and
sob, and clasp and hold her tight.
“We have time for no more of this,” cried the man,
unclenching her hands, and pushing her roughly off, as
he drew Emma Haredale towards the door. “Now!
Quick, outside there! are you ready?”
“Ay!” cried a loud voice, which made him start.
" Quite ready! Stand back here, for your lives!”
And in an instant he was felled like an ox in the
butcher's shambles-struck down as though a block of
marble had fallen from the roof and crushed him-and
cheerful light and beaming faces came pouring in-and
Emma was clasped in her uncle's embrace, and Dolly,
with a shriek that pierced the air, fell into the arms of
her father and mother.
What fainting there was, what laughing, what cry-
ing, what sobbing, what smiling, how much question-
ing, no answering, all talking together, all beside them-
selves with joy; what kissing, congratulating, embrac-
ing, shaking of hands, and falling into all these rap-
tures, over and over and over again; no language can
describe.
At length, and after a long time, the old locksmith
went up and fairly hugged two strangers, who had stood
apart and left them to themselves; and when they saw
-whom? Yes, Edward Chester and Joseph Willet.
“ See here!” cried the locksmith. “See here! where
would any of us have been without these two? Oh, Mr.
Edward, Mr. Edward-oh, Joe, Joe, how light, and yet
how full you have made my old heart to-night!"
• “It was Mr. Edward that knocked him down, sir,"
said Joe: “I longed to do it, but I gave it up to him.
Come, you brave and honest gentleman! Get your senses
together, for you haven't long to lie here.”
He had his foot upon the breast of their sham deliverer,
in the absence of a spare arm; and gave him a gentle

roll as he spoke. Gashford, for it was no other, crouch-
ing, yet malignant, raised his scowling face like sin sub-
dued, and pleaded to be gently used.
“I have access to all my lord's papers, Mr. Haredale,"
he said in a submissive voice: Mr. Haredale keeping his
back towards him, and not once looking round: “there
are very important documents among them. There are
a great many in secret drawers, and distributed in vari-
ous places, known only to my lord and me. I can give
some very valuable information, and render important
assistance to any inquiry. You will have to answer it
if I receive ill usage.
“Pah!” cried Joe, in deep disgust. “Get up, man;
you're waited for, outside. Get up, do you hear?”.
Gashford slowly rose, and picking up his hat, and
looking with a baffled malevolence, yet with an air of
despicable humility, all round the room, crawled out.
“And now, gentlemen,” said Joe, who seemed to be
the spokesman of the party, for all the rest were silent;
“the sooner we get back to the Black Lion the better,
perhaps.”
Mr. Haredale nodded assent, and drawing his niece's
arm through his, and taking one of her hands between
his own, passed out straightway, followed by the
locksmith, Mrs. Varden and Dolly-who would scarcely
have presented a sufficient surface for all the hugs and
caresses they bestowed upon her though she had been
a dozen Dollys. Edward Chester and Joe followed.
And did Dolly never once look behind--not once?
Was there not one little fleeting glimpse of the dark
eyelash, almost resting on her flushed cheek, and of
the downcast, sparkling eye it shaded? Joe thought
there was—and he is not likely to have been mis-
taken, for there were not many eyes like Dolly's, that's
the truth.
The outer room through which they had to pass was full
of men, among them Mr. Dennis, in safe keeping; and
there had been since yesterday, lying in hiding behind
a wooden screen which was now thrown down, Simon
Tappertit, the recreant ’Prentice, burnt and bruised,
and with a gun-shot wound in his body, and his legs-
his perfect legs, the pride and glory of his life, the com-
fort of his whole existence-crushed into shapeless ugli-
ness. Wondering no longer at the moans they had

heard, Dolly crept closer to her father, and shuddered
at the sight: but neither bruises, burns, nor gun-shot
wound, nor all the torture of his shattered limbs, sent
half so keen a pang to Simon's breast as Dolly passing
out, with Joe for her preserver.
A coach was ready at the door, and Dolly found her-
self safe and whole inside, between her father and
mother, with Emma Haredale and her uncle, quite real,
sitting opposite. But there was no Joe, no Edward, and
they had said nothing. They had only bowed once, and
kept at a distance. Dear heart! what a long way it was
to the Black Lion.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE Black Lion was so far off, and occupied such a
length of time in the getting at, that notwithstanding
the strong presumptive evidence she had about her of
the late events being real and of actual occurrence,
Dolly could not divest herself of the belief that she must
be in a dream which was lasting all night. Nor was
she quite certain that she saw and heard with her own
proper senses, even when the coach, in the fullness of
time, stopped at the Black Lion, and the host of that
tavern approached in a gush of cheerful light to help
them to dismount, and give them hearty welcome.
There too, at the coach door, one on one side, one
upon the other, were already Edward Chester and Joe
Willet, who must have followed in another coach: and
this was such a strange and unaccountable proceeding,
that Dolly was the more inclined to favour the idea of
her being fast asleep. But when Mr. Willet appeared-
old John himself-so heavy-headed and obstinate, and
with such a double chin as the liveliest imagination could
never in its boldest flights have conjured up in all its
vast proportions—then she stood corrected, and unwill-
ingly admitted to herself that she was broad awake.
And Joe had lost an arm-he-that well-made, hand-
some, gallant fellow! As Dolly glanced towards him,
and thought of the pain he must have suffered, and the
far-off places in which he had been wandering, and
wondered who had been his nurse, and hoped that who-
ever it was, she had been as kind and gentle and con-

109
siderate as she would have been, the tears came rising
to her bright eyes, one by one, little by little, until she
could keep them back no longer, and so, before them all,
wept bitterly.
"We are all safe now, Dolly,” said her father, kindly.
“We shall not be separated any more. Cheer up, my
love, cheer up!”
The locksmith's wife knew better, perhaps, than he,
what ailed her daughter. But Mrs. Varden being quite
an altered woman--for the riots had done that good-
added her word to his, and comforted her with similar
representations.
* Mayhap,” said Mr. Willet, senior, looking round
upon the company, “she's hungry. That's what it is,
depend upon it-I am, myself.”
The Black Lion, who, like old John, had been waiting
supper past all reasonable and conscionable hours,
hailed this as a philosophical discovery of the pro-
foundest and most penetrating kind; and the table being
already spread, they sat down to supper straightway.
The conversation was not of the liveliest nature, nor
were the appetites of some among them very keen.
But in both these respects old John more than atoned
for any deficiency on the part of the rest, and very much
distinguished himself.
It was not in point of actual conversation that Mr.
Willet shone so brilliantly, for he had none of his old
cronies to “ tackle," and was rather timorous of ventur-
ing on Joe, having certain vague misgivings within him
that he was ready on the shortest notice, and on receipt
of the slightest offence, to fell the Black Lion to the
floor of his own parlour, and immediately withdraw to
China or some other remote and unknown region, there
to dwell for evermore, or at least until he had got rid
of his remaining arm and both legs, and perhaps an
eye or so into the bargain. It was with a peculiar kind
of pantomime that Mr. Willet filled up every pause;
and in this he was considered by the Black Lion, who
had been his familiar for some years, quite to surpass
and go beyond himself, and outrun the expectations of
his most admiring friends.
The subject that worked in Mr. Willet's mind, and
occasioned these demonstrations, was no other than his
son's bodily disfigurement. which he had never yet got

himself thoroughly to believe or comprehend. Shortly
after their first meeting, he had been observed to
wander, in a state of great perplexity, to the kitchen,
and to direct his gaze towards the fire, as if in search of
his usual adviser in all matters of doubt and difficulty.
But there being no boiler at the Black Lion, and the
rioters having so beaten and battered his own that it
was quite unfit for further service, he wandered out
again, in a perfect bog of uncertainty and mental con-
fusion, and in that state took the strangest means of
resolving his doubts: such as feeling the sleeve of his
son's great-coat, as deeming it possible that his arm
might be there; looking at his own arms and those of
everybody else, as if to assure himself that two and not
one was the usual allowance; sitting by the hour to-
gether in a brown study, as if he were endeavouring to
recall Joe's image in his younger days, and to remember
whether he really had in those times one arm or a pair;
and employing himself in many other speculations of the
same kind.
Finding himself at this supper, surrounded by faces
with which he had been so well acquainted in old times,
Mr. Willet recurred to the subject with uncommon
vigour; apparently resolved to understand it now or
never. Sometimes, after every two or three mouthfuls,
he laid down his knife and fork, and stared at his son with
all his might-particularly at his maimed side; then he
looked slowly round the table until he caught some
person's eye, when he shook his head with great sol-
emnity, patted his shoulder, winked, or as one may say
-for winking was a very slow process with him-went
to sleep with one eye for a minute or two; and so, with
another solemn shaking of his head, took up his knife
and fork again, and went on eating. Sometimes, he put
his food into his mouth abstractedly, and, with all his
faculties concentrated on Joe, gazed at him in a fit of
stupefaction as he cut his meat with one hand, until he
was recalled to himself by symptoms of choking on his
own part, and was by that means restored to conscious-
ness. At other times he resorted to such small devices
as asking him for the salt, the pepper, the vinegar, the
mustard-anything that was on his maimed side-and
watching him as he handed it. By dint of these experi-
ments, he did at last so satisfy and convince himself that,

after a longer silence than he had yet maintained, he
laid down his knife and fork on either side his plate,
drank a long draught from a tankard beside him (still
keeping his eyes on Joe), and leaning backward in his
chair and fetching a long breath, said, as he looked all
round the board:
“It's been took off!”
“By George!” said the Black Lion, striking the table
with his hand, “he's got it!"
“Yes, sir,” said Mr. Willet, with the look of a man
who felt that he had earned a compliment, and deserved
it. “That's where it is. It's been took off.”
“Tell him where it was done,” said the Black Lion to
Joe.
“At the defence of the Savannah, father.”
“At the defence of the Salwanners," repeated Mr.
Willet, softly; again looking round the table.
“In America, where the war is,” said Joe.
“In America, where the war is,” repeated Mr. Willet.
“It was took off in the defence of the Salwanners in
America where the war is.” Continuing to repeat these
words to himself in a low tone of voice (the same infor-
mation had been conveyed to him in the same terms, at
least fifty times before), Mr. Willet arose from table,
walked round to Joe, felt his empty sleeve all the way
up, from the cuff to where the stump of his arm re-
mained; shook his hand; lighted his pipe at the fire,
took a long whiff, walked to the door, turned round once
when he had reached it, wiped his left eye with the back
of his forefinger, and said, in a faltering voice: “My
son's arm-was took off-at the defence of the-Sal-
wanners—in America—where the war is”—with which
words he withdrew, and returned no more that night.
Indeed, on various pretences, they all withdrew one
after another, save Dolly, who was left sitting there
alone. It was a great relief to be alone, and she was
crying to her heart's content, when she heard Joe's voice
at the end of the passage, bidding somebody good-night.
Good night! Then he was going elsewhere—to some
distance, perhaps. To what kind of home could he be
going, now that it was so late!
She heard him walk along the passage, and pass the
door. But there was a hesitation in his footsteps. He
turned back-Dolly's heart beat high-he looked in,

" Good-night!”—he didn't say Dolly, but there was
comfort in his not saying Miss Varden.
“Good-night!” sobbed Dolly
“I am sorry you take on so much, for what is past
and gone,” said Joe kindly. “Don't. I can't bear to
see you do it. Think of it no longer. You are safe and
happy now.”
Dolly cried the more.
“You must have suffered very much within these few
days—and yet you're not changed, unless it's for the
better. They said you were, but I don't see it. You
were — you were always very beautiful,” said Joe,
“but you are more beautiful than ever, now. You
are indeed. There can be no harm in my saying so,
for you must know it. You are told so very often, I
am sure.”
As a general principle, Dolly did know it, and was
told so very often. But the coach-maker had turned
out, years ago, to be a special donkey, and whether she
had been afraid of making similar discoveries in others,
or had grown by dint of long custom to be careless of
compliments generally, certain it is that although she
cried so much, she was better pleased to be told so now,
than ever she had been in all her life.
“I shall bless your name,” sobbed the locksmith's
little daughter, “as long as I live. I shall never hear it
spoken without feeling as if my heart would burst. I
shall remember it in my prayers, every night and morn-
ing till I die!"
* Will you?” said Joe, eagerly. “Will you indeed? It
makes me—well, it makes me very glad and proud to
hear you say so.”
Dolly still sobbed, and held her handkerchief to her
eyes. Joe still stood looking at her.
“Your voice,” said Joe, “ brings up old times so pleas-
antly, that, for the moment, I feel as if that night-
there can be no harm in talking of that night now-had
come back, and nothing had happened in the meantime.
I feel as if I hadn't suffered any hardships, but had
knocked down poor Tom Cobb only yesterday, and had
come to see you with my bundle on my shoulder before
running away. You remember?"
Remember! But she said nothing. She raised her
eyes for an instant. It was but a glance; a little tear-

113
ful, timid glance. It kept Joe silent, though, for a long
time.
“ Well,” he said stoutly, “it was to be otherwise, and
was. I have been abroad, fighting all the summer and
frozen up all the winter, ever since. I have come back
as poor in purse as I went, and crippled for life besides.
But, Dolly, I would rather have lost this other arm-ay, I
would rather have lost my head-than have come back
to find you dead, or anything but what I always pic-
tured you to myself, and what I always hoped and
wished to find you. Thank God for all!”
Oh, how much, and how keenly, the little coquette of
five years ago felt now! She had found her heart at
last. Never having known its worth till now, she had
never known the worth of his. How priceless it ap-
peared!
“I did hope once,” said Joe, in his homely way, “that
I might come back a rich man, and marry you. But I
was a boy then, and have long known better than that.
I am a poor, maimed, discharged soldier, and must be
content to rub through life as I can. I can't say, even
now, that I shall be glad to see you married, Dolly; but
I am glad—yes, I am, and glad to think I can say so-
to know that you are admired and courted, and can
pick and choose for a happy life. It's a comfort to me
to know that you'll talk to your husband about me; and
I hope the time will come when I may be able to like
him, and to shake hands with him, and to come and see
you as a poor friend who knew you when you were a
girl. God bless you!"
His hand did tremble; but for all that, he took it away
again, and left her.

CHAPTER XV.
By this Friday night-for it was on Friday in the riot
week that Emma and Dolly were rescued, by the timely
aid of Joe and Edward Chester—the disturbances were
entirely quelled, and peace and order were restored to
the affrighted city. True, after what had happened, it
was impossible for any man to say how long this better
state of things might last, or how suddenly new out-
rages, exceeding even those so lately witnessed, might
burst forth and fill its streets with ruin and bloodshed;
for this reason, those who had fled from the recent
tumults still kept at a distance, and many families,
hitherto unable to procure the means of flight, now
availed themselves of the calm, and withdrew into the
country. The shops, too, from Tyburn to Whitechapel,
were still shut; and very little business was transacted
in any of the places of great commercial resort. But,
notwithstanding, and in spite of the melancholy fore-
bodings of that numerous class of society who see with
the greatest clearness into the darkest perspectives, the
town remained profoundly quiet. The strong mili-
tary force disposed in every advantageous quarter,
and stationed at every commanding point, held the
scattered fragments of the mob in check; the search
after rioters was prosecuted with unrelenting vigour;
and if there were any among them so desperate and
reckless as to be inclined, after the terrible scenes they
had beheld, to venture forth again, they were so daunted
by these resolute measures that they quickly shrunk
into their hiding-places, and had no thought but for
their personal safety.
In a word, the crowd was utterly routed. Upwards of
two hundred had been shot dead in the streets. Two
hundred and fifty more were lying, badly wounded, in
the hospitals; of whom seventy or eighty died within a
short time afterwards. A hundred were already in cus-
tody, and more were taken every hour. How many
perished in the conflagrations or by their own excessos
is unknown; but that numbers found a terrible grave in
the hot ashes of the flames they had kindled, or crept

into vaults and cellars to drink in secret or to nurse their
sores, and never saw the light again, is certain. When
the embers of the fires had been black and cold for many
weeks, the labourers' spades proved this beyond a doubt.
Seventy-two private houses and four strong jails were
destroyed in the four great days of these riots. The
total loss of property, as estimated by the sufferers, was
one hundred and fifty-five thousand pounds; at the lowest
and least partial estimate of disinterested persons, it
exceeded one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds.
For this immense loss compensation was soon after-
wards made out of the public purse, in pursuance of a
vote of the House of Commons; the sum being levied on the
various wards in the city, on the county and the borough
of Southwark. Both Lord Mansfield and Lord Saville,
however, who had been great sufferers, refused to accept
of any compensation whatever.
The House of Commons, sitting on Tuesday with
locked and guarded doors, had passed a resolution to
the effect that, as soon as the tumults subsided, it would
immediately proceed to consider the petitions presented
from many of his Majesty's Protestant subjects, and
would take the same into its serious consideration.
While this question was under debate, Mr. Herbert, one
of the members present, indignantly rose and called
upon the House to observe that Lord George Gordon
was then sitting under the gallery with the blue cockade,
the signal of rebellion, in his hat. He was not only
obliged, by those who sat near, to take it out; but offer-
ing to go into the street to pacify the mob with the some-
what indefinite assurance that the House was prepared
to give them “the satisfaction they sought,” was ac-
tually held down in his seat by the combined force of
several members. In short, the disorder and violence
which reigned triumphant out of doors, penetrated into
the senate, and there, as elsewhere, terror and alarm
prevailed, and ordinary forms were for the time for-
gotten.
On the Thursday, both Houses, had adjourned until
the following Monday se’nnight, declaring it impossible
to pursue their deliberations with the necessary gravity
and freedom while they were surrounded by armed
troops. And now that the rioters were dispersed, the
citizens were beset with a new fear; for, finding their

public thoroughfares and all their usual places of resort
filled with soldiers entrusted with the free use of fire and
sword, they began to lend a greedy ear to the rumours
which were afloat of martial law being declared, and to
dismal stories of prisoners having been seen hanging on
lamp-posts in Cheapside and Fleet Street. These terrors
being promptly dispelled by a Proclamation declaring
that all the rioters in custody would be tried by a special
commission in due course of law, a fresh alarm was en-
gendered by its being whispered abroad that French
money had been found on some of the rioters, and that
the disturbances had been fomented by foreign powers
who sought to compass the overthrow and ruin of Eng-
land. This report, which was strengthened by the dif-
fusion of anonymous handbills, but which, if it had any
foundation at all, probably owed its origin to the circum-
stance of some few coins which were not English money
having been swept into the pockets of the insurgents
with other miscellaneous booty, and afterwards discov-
ered on the prisoners or the dead bodies—caused a great
sensation; and men's minds being in that excited state
when they are most apt to catch at any shadow of ap-
prehension, was bruited about with much industry.
All remaining quiet, however, during the whole of
this Friday, and on this Friday night, and no new dis-
coveries being made, confidence began to be restored,
and the most timid and desponding breathed again. In
Southwark no fewer than three thousand of the inhab-
itants formed themselves into a watch, and patrolled
the streets every hour. Nor were the citizens slow to
follow so good an example: and it being the manner of
peaceful men to be very bold when the danger is over,
they were abundantly fierce and daring; not scrupling
to question the stoutest passenger with great severity,
and carrying it with a very high hand over all errand-
boys, servant-girls, and 'prentices.
As day deepened into evening, and darkness crept
into the nooks and corners of the town, as if it were
mustering in secret and gathering strength to venture
into the open ways, Barnaby sat in his dungeon, won-
dering at the silence, and listening in vain for the noise
and outcry which had ushered in the night of late.
Beside him, with his hand in hers, sat one in whose
companionship he felt at peace. She was worn and

117
altered, full of grief, and heavy-hearted; but the same
to him.
“Mother,” he said, after a long silence: “how long-
how many days and nights—shall I be kept here?"
“Not many, dear. I hope not many."
“You hope! Ay, but your hoping will not undo these
chains. I hope, but they don't mind that. Grip hopes,
but who cares for Grip?"
The raven gave a short, dull, melancholy croak. It
said “Nobody," as plainly as a croak could speak.
“Who cares for Grip, excepting you and me?” said
Barnaby, smoothing the bird's rumpled feathers with
his hand. “He never speaks in this place; he never
says a word in jail; he sits and mopes all day in this
dark corner, dozing sometimes, and sometimes looking
at the light that creeps in through the bars, and shines
in his bright eye as if a spark from those great fires had
fallen into the room and was burning yet. But who
cares for Grip?"
The raven croaked again-“Nobody.”
“And, by the way,” said Barnaby, withdrawing his
hand from the bird, and laying it upon his mother's arm,
as he looked eagerly in her face; “if they kill me—they
may: I heard it said they would—what will become of
Grip when I am dead?”
The sound of the word, or the current of his own
thoughts, suggested to Grip his old phrase “ Never say
die!" But he stopped short in the middle of it, drew a
dismal cork, and subsided into a faint croak, as if he
lacked the heart to get through the shortest sentence.
" Will they take his life as well as mine?” said
Barnaby. “I wish they would. If you and I and he
could die together, there would be none to feel sorry, or
to grieve for us. But do what they will, I don't fear
them, mother!”
“They will not harm you,” she said, her tears chok-
ing her utterance. “They never will harm you, when
they know all. I am sure they never will."
"Oh! Don't you be too sure of that,” cried Barnaby,
with a strange pleasure in the belief that she was self-
deceived, and in his own sagacity. “They have marked
me, mother, from the first. I heard them say so to each
other when they brought me to this place last night;
and I believe them. Don't you cry for me. They said

that I was bold, and so I am, and so I will be. You may
think that I am silly, but I can die as well as another-
I have done no harm, have I?” he added quickly.
“None before Heaven,” she answered.
“Why, then,” said Barnaby, “ let them do their worst.
You told me once-you-when I asked you what death
meant, that it was nothing to be feared, if we did no
harm. Aha! mother, you thought I had forgotten
that!”
His merry laugh and playful manner smote her to the
heart. She drew him closer to her, and besought him
to talk to her in whispers and to be very quiet, for it was
getting dark, and their time was short, and she would
soon have to leave him for the night.
“ You will come to-morrow?” said Barnaby.
Yes. And every day. And they would never part
again.
He joyfully replied that this was well, and what he
wished, and what he had felt quite certain she would tell
him; and then he asked her where she had been so long,
and why she had not come to see him when he was a
great soldier, and ran through the wild schemes he had
had for their being rich and living prosperously, and,
with some faint notion in his mind that she was sad and
he had made her so, tried to console and comfort her,
and talked of their former life and his old sports and
freedom: little dreaming that every word he uttered
only increased her sorrow, and that her tears fell faster
at the freshened recollection of their lost tranquility.
“Mother,” said Barnaby, as they heard the man ap-
proaching to close the cells for the night, “when I
spoke to you just now about my father you cried ‘Hush!
and turned away your head. Why did you do so? Tell
me why, in a word. You thought he was dead. You
are not sorry that he is alive and has come back to us?
Where is he? Here?”
“Do not ask any one where he is, or speak about
him," she made answer.
“Why not?” said Barnaby. “Because he is a stern
man, and talks roughly? Well! I don't like him, or
want to be with him by myself; but why not speak about
him?"
“Because I am sorry that he is alive; sorry that he
has come back; and sorry that he and you have ever

119
met. Because, dear Barnaby, the endeavour of my life
has been to keep you two asunder.”
“Father and son asunder! Why?”.
“He has,” she whispered in his ear, “he has shed
blood. The time has come when you must know it. He
has shed the blood of one who loved him well, and
trusted him, and never did him wrong in word or deed.”
Barnaby recoiled in horror, and glancing at his stained
wrist for an instant, wrapped it, shuddering, in his
dress.
“But,” she added hastily, as the key turned in the
lock, “and although we shun him, he is your father,
dearest, and I am his wretched wife. They seek his
life, and he will lose it. It must not be by our means;
nay, if we could win him back to penitence, we should
be bound to love him yet. Do not seem to know him,
except as one who fled with you from the jail, and if
they question you about him, do not answer them. God
be with you through the night, dear boy! God be with
you!”
She tore herself away, and in a few seconds Barnaby
was alone. He stood for a long time rooted to the spot,
with his face hidden in his hands; then flung himself,
sobbing, upon his miserable bed.
But the moon came slowly up in all her gentle glory,
and the stars looked out, and through the small com-
pass of the grated window, as through the narrow
crevice of one good deed in a murky life of guilt, the
face of Heaven shone bright and merciful. He raised
his head; gazed upward at the quiet sky, which seemed
to smile upon the earth in sadness, as if the night, more
thoughtful than the day, looked down in sorrow on the
sufferings and evil deeds of men; and felt its peace sink
deep into his heart. He, a poor idiot, caged in his nar-
row cell, was as much lifted up to God, while gazing
on the mild light, as the freest and most favoured man
in all the spacious city; and in his ill-remembered
prayer, and in the fragment of the childish hymn,
with which he sung and crooned himself asleep, there
breathed as true a spirit as ever studied homily ex-
pressed, or old cathedral arches echoed.
As his mother crossed a yard on her way out, she saw,
through a grated door which separated it from another
court, her husband, walking round and round, with his
Sufferings his heart. He lifted up to

hands folded on his breast, and his head hung down.
She asked the man who conducted her if she might
speak a word with this prisoner. Yes, but she must be
quick, for he was locking up for the night, and there
was but a minute or so to spare. Saying this he unlocked
the door, and bade her go in.
It grated harshly as it turned upon its hinges, but he
was deaf to the noise, and still walked round and round
the little court, without raising his head or changing his
attitude in the least. She spoke to him, but her voice
was weak, and failed her. At length she put herself in
his track, and when he came near, stretched out her
hand and touched him.
He started backward, trembling from head to foot; but
seeing who it was, demanded why she came there. Be-
fore she could reply, he spoke again.
“Am I to live or die? Do you do murder too, or
spare?”
“My son-our son,” she answered, “is in this prison."
“What is that to me?” he cried, stamping impatiently
on the stone pavement. “I know it. He can no more
aid me than I can aid him. If you are come to talk of
him, begone!"
As he spoke he resumed his walk, and hurried round
the court as before. When he came again to where she
stood, he stopped, and said:
“Am I to live or die? Do you repent?"
o Oh!-do you?" she answered. “Will you, while
time remains? Do not believe that I could save you, if
I dared.”
“Say if you would,” he answered with an oath, as he
tried to disengage himself and pass on. “Say if you
would.”
“Listen to me for one moment,” she returned; “for
but a moment. I am but newly risen from a sick-bed,
from which I never hoped to rise again. The best
among us think, at such a time, of good intentions
half-performed and duties left undone. If I have ever,
since that fatal night, omitted to pray for your repent-
ance before death-if I omitted, even then, anything
which might tend to urge it on you when the horror of
your crime was fresh-if, in our later meeting, I yielded
to the dread that was upon me, and forgot to fall upon
my knees and solemnly adjure you, in the name of him

you sent to his account with Heaven, to prepare for the
retribution which must come, and which is stealing on
you now-I humbly before you, and 'in the agony of
supplication in which you see me, beseech that you will
let me make atonement.”
“What is the meaning of your canting words?” he
answered roughly. “Speak so that I may understand
“I will,” she answered, “I desire to. Bear with me -
for a moment more. The hand of Him who set his
curse on murder is heavy on us now. You cannot
doubt it. Our son, our innocent boy, on whom His anger
fell before his birth, is in this place in peril of his life-
brought here by your guilt; yes, by that alone, as Heaven
sees and knows, for he has been led astray in the dark-
ness of his intellect, and that is the terrible consequence
of your crime."
“If you come, woman-like, to load me with re-
proaches—” he muttered, again endeavouring to break
away.
“—I do not. I have a different purpose. You must
hear it. If not to-night, to-morrow; if not to-morrow,
at another time. You must hear it. Husband, escape
is hopeless-impossible.”
“You tell me so, do you?” he said, raising his mana-
cled hand, and shaking it. “You!”
“Yes,” she said, with indescribable earnestness. “But
why?"
To make me easy in this jail. To make the time
'twixt this and death pass pleasantly. For my good-
yes, for my good, of course,” he said, grinding his teeth,
and smiling at her with a livid face.
“Not to load you with reproaches,” she replied; “not
to aggravate the tortures and miseries of your condition,
not to give you one hard word, but to restore you to
peace and hope. Husband, dear husband, if you will
but confess this dreadful crime; if you will but implore
forgiveness of Heaven and of those whom you have
wronged on earth; if you will dismiss these vain uneasy
thoughts, which never can be realised, and will rely on
penitence and on the truth, I promise you, in the great
name of the Creator, whose image you have defaced,
that He will comfort and console you. And for myself,"
shę cried, clasping her hands, and looking upwards, “I

swear before Him, as he knows my heart and reads it
now, that from that hour I will love and cherish you as
I did of old, and watch you night and day in the short
interval that will remain to us, and soothe you with my
truest love and duty, and pray with you, that one
threatening judgment may be arrested, and that our
boy may be spared to bless God, in his poor way, in the
free air and light!”
He fell back and gazed at her while she poured out
these words, as though he were for a moment awed by
her manner, and knew not what to do. But anger and
fear soon got the mastery of him, and he spurned her
from him.
“Begone!” he cried. “Leave me; you plot, do you!
You plot to get speech with me, and let them know I
am the man they say I am. A curse on you and on your
boy.
* On him the curse has already fallen,” she replied,
wringing her hands.
“Let it fall heavier. Let it fall on one and all. I hate
you both. The worst has come to me. The only com-
fort that I seek or I can have will be the knowledge that
it comes to you. Now go!"
She would have urged him gently, even then, but he
menaced her with his chain.
“I say go—I say it for the last time. The gallows has
me in its grasp, and it is a black phantom that may
urge me on to something more. Begone! I curse the
hour that I was born, the man I slew and all the living
world!”
In a paroxysm of wrath, and terror, and the fear of
death, he broke from her, and rushed into the darkness
of his cell, where he cast himself jangling down upon
the stone floor, and smote it with his iron bands. The
man returned to lock the dungeon door, and having
done so, carried her away.
On that warm, balmy night in June, there were glad
faces and light hearts in all quarters of the town, and
sleep, banished by the late horrors, was doubly wel-
comed. On that night, families made merry in their
houses, and greeted each other on the common danger
they had escaped, and those who had been denounced,
ventured into the streets; and they who had been
plundered, got good shelter, Even the timorous Lord

Mayor, who was summoned that night before the Privy
Council to answer for his conduct, came back contented;
observing to all his friends that he had got off very well
with a reprimand, and repeating with huge satisfaction
his memorable defence before the Council, “that such
was his temerity, he thought death would have been his
potion.”
On that night, too, more of the scattered remnants of
the mob were traced to their lurking-places and taken;
and in the hospitals, and deep among the ruins they had
made, and in the ditches, and the fields, many un-
shrouded wretches lay dead: envied by those who had
been active in the disturbances, and who pillowed their
doomed heads in the temporary jails.
And in the Tower, in a dreary room whose thick
stone walls shut out the hum of life, and made a still-
ness which the records left by former prisoners with
those silent witnesses seemed to deepen and intensify;
remorseful for every act that had been done by every man
among the cruel crowd; feeling for the time their guilt
his own, and their lives put in peril by himself; and
finding, amidst such reflections, little comfort in fanati-
cism, or in his fancied call; sat the unhappy author
of all-Lord George Gordon.
He had been made prisoner that evening. “If you
are sure it's me you want,” he said to the officer, who
waited outside with the warrant for his arrest on a
charge of high treason, “I am ready to accompany
you-” which he did without resistance. He was con-
ducted first before the Privy Council, and afterwards to
the Horse Guards, and then was taken by way of West-
minster Bridge, and back over London Bridge (for the
purpose of avoiding the main streets), to the Tower,
under the strongest guard ever known to enter its gates
with a single prisoner.
Of all his forty thousand men, not one remained to
bear him company. Friends, dependents, followers-
none were there. His fawning secretary had played the
traitor; and he whose weakness had been goaded and
urged on by so many for their own purposes was deso-
late and alone,

CHAPTER XVI.
MR. DENNIS, having been made prisoner late in the
evening, was removed to a neighbouring round-house for
that night, and carried before a justice for examination
on the next day, Saturday. The charges against him
being numerous and weighty, and it being in particular
proved, by the testimony of Gabriel Varden, that he
had shown a special desire to take his life, he was com-
mitted for trial. Moreover he was honoured with the
distinction of being considered a chief among the in-
surgents, and received from the magistrate's lips the
complimentary assurance that he was in a position of
imminent danger, and would do well to prepare himself
for the worst.
To say that Mr. Dennis's modesty was not somewhat
startled by these honours, or that he was altogether
prepared for so flattering a reception, would be to claim
for him a greater amount of stoical philosophy than
even he possessed. Indeed, this gentleman's stoicism
was of that not uncommon kind which enables a man
to bear with exemplary fortitude the afflictions of his
friends, but renders him, by way of counterpoise, rather
selfish and sensitive in respect of any that happen to
befall himself. It is therefore no dispăragement to the
great officer in question to state, without disguise or
concealment, that he was at first very much alarmed,
and that he betrayed divers emotions of fear, until his
reasoning powers came to his relief, and set before him.
a more hopeful prospect.
In proportion as Mr. Dennis exercised these intellec-
tual qualities with which he was gifted, in reviewing
his best chances of coming off handsomely and with
small personal inconvenience, his spirits rose, and his
confidence increased. When he remembered the great
estimation in which his office was held, and the constant
demand for his services; when he bethought himself
how the Statute Book regarded him as a kind of Uni-
versal Medicine applicable to men, women, and children,
of every age and variety of criminal constitution; and
how high he stood, in his official capacity, in the favour

125
of the Crown, and both Houses of Parliament, the Mint,
the Bank of England, and the Judges of the land; when
he recollected that whatever ministry was in or out, he
remained their peculiar pet and panacea, and that for
his sake England stood single and conspicuous among
the civilised nations of the earth: when he called these
things to mind and dwelt upon them, he felt certain
than national gratitude must relieve him from the con-
sequences of his late proceedings, and would certainly
restore him to his old place in the happy social
system.
With these crumbs, or as one may say, with these
whole loaves of comfort to regale upon, Mr. Dennis took
his place among the escort that awaited him, and re-
paired to jail with a manly indifference. Arriving at
Newgate, where some of the ruined cells had been hastily
fitted up for the safe keeping of rioters, he was warmly
received by the turnkeys, as an unusual and interesting
case, which agreeably relieved their monotonous duties.
In this spirit he was fettered with great care, and con-
veyed into the interior of the prison.
“Brother,” cried the hangman, as, following an officer,
he traversed under these novel circumstances the re-
mains of passages with which he was well acquainted,
“am I going to be along with anybody?”
“If you'd have left more walls standing, you'd have
been alone,” was the reply. “As it is, we're cramped
for room, and you'll have company."
“Well,” returned Dennis, “I don't object to company,
brother. I rather like company. I was formed for
society, I was.”
“That's rather a pity, ain't it?” said the man.
“No,” answered Dennis, “I'm not aware that it is.
Why should it be a pity, brother?”
“Oh! I don't know,” said the man carelessly. “I
thought that was what you meant. Being formed for
society, and being cut off in your flower, you know—”
“I say,” interposed the other quickly, “what are you
talking of! Don't. Who's a going to be cut off in their
flowers?"
“Oh, nobody particular. I thought you was, perhaps,"
said the man.
Mr. Dennis wiped his face, which had suddenly grown
very hot, and remarking in a tremulous voice to his

conductor that he had always been fond of his joke,
followed him in silence until he stopped at a door.
" This is my quarters, is it?” he asked facetiously.
“ This is the shop, sir,” replied his friend.
He was walking in, but not with the best possible
grace, when he suddenly stopped, and started back.
“Halloa!” said the officer. “You're nervous.”
“Nervous!” whispered Dennis, in great alarm. “Well
I may be. Shut the door.”
"I will, when you're in," returned the man.
“But I can't go in there," whispered Dennis. “I can't
be shut up with that man. Do you want me to be throt-
tled, brother?”
The officer seemed to entertain no particular desire on
the subject one way or other, but briefly remarking that
he had his orders, and intended to obey them, pushed
him in, turned the key, and retired.
Dennis stood trembling with his back against the
door, and involuntarily raising his arm to defend him-
self, stared at a man, the only other tenant of the cell,
who lay, stretched at his full length, upon a stone bench,
and who paused in his deep breathing as if he were
about to wake. But he rolled over on one side, let his
arm fall negligently down, drew a long sigh, and mur-
muring indistinctly, fell fast asleep again.
Relieved in some degree by this, the hangman took
his eyes for an instant from the slumbering figure, and
glanced round the cell in search of some’vantage-ground
or weapon of defence. There was nothing movable
within it but a clumsy table which could not be dis-
placed without noise, and a heavy chair. Stealing on
tiptoe towards this latter piece of furniture, he retired
with it into the remotest corner, and intrenching him-
self behind it watched the enemy with the utmost vigi-
lance and caution.
The sleeping man was Hugh; and perhaps it was not
unnatural for Dennis to feel in a state of very uncom-
fortable suspense, and to wish with his whole soul that
he might never wake again. Tired of standing, he
crouched down in his corner after some time, and rested
on the cold pavement; but although Hugh's breathing
still proclaimed that he was sleeping soundly, he could
not trust him out of his sight for an instant. He was so
afraid of him and of some sudden onslaught, that he was

not content to see his closed eyes through the chair-
back, but every now and then rose stealthily to his
feet and peered at him with outstretched neck, to
assure himself that he really was still asleep, and was
not about to spring upon him when he was off his
guard.
He slept so long and so soundly that Mr. Dennis began
to think he might sleep on until the turnkey visited them.
He was congratulating himself upon these promising
appearances, and blessing his stars with much fervour,
when one or two unpleasant symptoms manifested
themselves: such as another motion of the arm, another
sigh, a restless tossing of the head. Then, just as it
seemed that he was about to fall heavily to the ground
from his narrow bed, Hugh's eyes opened.
It happened that his face was turned directly towards
his unexpected visitor. He looked lazily at him for
some half-dozen seconds without any aspect of surprise
or recognition; then suddenly jumped up, and with a
great oath pronounced his name.
“Keep off, brother, keep off!” cried Dennis, dodging
behind the chair. “Don't do me a mischief. I'm a
prisoner like you. I haven't the free use of my limbs.
I'm quite an old man. Don't hurt me!”
He whined out the last three words in such piteous
accents that Hugh, who had dragged away the chair,
and aimed a blow at him with it, checked himself, and
bade him get up.
“I'll get up, certainly, brother,” cried Dennis, anxious
to propitiate him by any means in his power, “I'll com-
ply with any request of yours, I'm sure. There—I'm
up now. What can I do for you? Only say the word,
and I'll do it.”
“What can you do for me!" cried Hugh, clutching
him by the collar with both hands, and shaking him as
though he were bent on stopping his breath by that
means. “What have you done for me?”
“ The best. The best that could be done,” returned
the hangman.
Hugh made him no answer, but shaking him in his
strong grip until his teeth chattered in his head, cast
him down upon the floor, and flung himself on the bench
again.
"If it wasn't for the comfort it is to me to see you

here,” he muttered, "I'd have crushed your head against
it; I would.”
It was some time before Dennis had breath enough to
speak, but as soon as he could resume his propitiary
strain he did so.
“I did the best that could be done, brother,” he
whined; “I did indeed. I was forced, with two bayo-
nets and I don't know how many bullets on each side of
me, to point you out. If you hadn't been taken, you'd have
been shot; and what a sight that would have been-a
fine young man like you!"
“Will it be a better sight now?” asked Hugh, raising
his head with such a fierce expression that the other
durst not answer him just then.
“A deal better,” said Dennis, meekly, after a pause.
“First, there's all the chances of the law, and they're
five hundred strong. We may get off scot-free. Un-
likelier things than that have come to pass. Even if we
shouldn't and the chances fail, we can but be worked off
once: and when it's well done, it's so neat, so skilful, so
captiwating, if that don't seem too strong a word, that
you'd hardly believe it could be brought to sich perfec-
tion. Kill one's fellow creatures off with muskets! - Pah!”
and his nature so revolted at the bare idea that he spat
upon the dungeon pavement.
His warming on this topic, which, to one unacquainted
with his pursuits and tastes, appeared like courage; to-
gether with his artful suppression of his own secret
hopes, and mention of himself as being in the same con-
dition with Hugh; did more to soothe that ruffian than
the most elaborate arguments could have done, or the
most abject submission. He rested his arms upon his
knees, and stooping forward, looked from beneath his
shaggy hair at Dennis with something of a smile upon
his face.
“The fact is, brother," said the hangman, in a tone of
greater confidence, “that you got into bad company.
The man that was with you was looked after more than
you, and it was him I wanted. As to me, what have I
got by it? Here we are in one and the same plight.”
“Lookee, rascal,” said Hugh, contracting his brows,
“I'm not altogether such a shallow blade but I know
you expected to get something by it, or you wouldn't
have done it. But it's done, and you're here, and it will

soon be all over with you and me; and I'd as soon die as
live, or live as die. Why should I trouble myself to have
revenge on you? To eat, and drink, and go to sleep, as
long as I stay here, is all I care for. If there was but a
little more sun to bask in, than can find its way into this
cursed place, I'd lie in it all day, and not trouble myself
to sit or stand up once. That's all the care I have for
myself. Why should I care for you?”
Finishing this speech with a growl like the yawn of a
wild beast, he stretched himself upon the bench again,
and closed his eyes once more.
After looking at him in silence for some moments,
Dennis, who was greatly relieved to find him in this
mood, drew the chair towards his rough couch and sat
down near him-taking the precaution, however, to keep
out of the range of his brawny arm.
“ Well said, brother; nothing could be better said,” he
ventured to observe. “We'll eat and drink of the best,
and sleep our best, and make the best of it every way.
Anything can be got for money. Let's spend it merrily.”
"Ay,” said Hugh, coiling himself in a new position.
“ Where is it?”
“ Why, they took mine from me at the lodge,” said
Mr. Dennis; but mine's a peculiar case.”
“Is it? They took mine, too."
“Why, then, I tell you what, brother,” Dennis began.
“You must look up your friends”
“My friends!” cried Hugh, starting up and resting on
his hands. “Where are my friends?"
“Your relations, then,” said Dennis.
“Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Hugh, waving one arm above
his head. “He talks of friends to me-talks of relations
to a man whose mother died the death in store for her
son, and left him, a hungry brat, without a face he
knew in all the world! He talks of this to me!”
“Brother,” cried the hangman, whose features under-
went a sudden change, “ you don't mean to say—”.
“I mean to say,” Hugh interposed, “ that they hung
her up at Tyburn. What was good enough for her, is
good enough for me. Let them do the like by me as
soon as they please—the sooner the better. Say no more
to me. I'm going to sleep.”
“But I want to speak to you; I want to hear more
about that,” said Dennis, changing colour.

“If you're a wise man,” growled Hugh, raising his
head to look at him with a frown, “you'll hold your
tongue. I tell you I'm going to sleep."
Dennis venturing to say something more in spite of
this caution, the desperate fellow struck at him with all
his force, and missing him, lay down again with many
muttered oaths and imprecations, and turned his face
towards the wall. After two or three ineffectual twitches
at his dress, which he was hardy enough to venture
upon, notwithstanding his dangerous humour, Mr.
Dennis, who burnt, for reasons of his own, to pursue
the conversation, had no alternative but to sit as
patiently as he could, waiting his further pleasure.
CHAPTER XVII.
A MONTH has elapsed—and we stand in the bed-cham-
ber of Sir John Chester. Through the half-opened win-
dow, the Temple Garden looks green and pleasant; the
placid river, gay with boat and barge, and dimpled with
the plash of many an oar, sparkles in the distance; the
sky is blue and clear; and the summer air steals gently
in, filling the room with perfume. The very town, the
smoky town, is radiant. High roofs and steeple tops,
wont to look black and sullen, smile a cheerful grey;
every old gilded vane, and ball, and cross, glitters anew
in the bright morning sun; and, high among them all,
St. Paul's towers up, showing its lofty crest in burnished
gold.
Sir John was breakfasting in bed. His chocolate and
toast stood upon a little table at his elbow; books and
newspapers lay ready to his hand upon the coverlet;
and, sometimes pausing to glance with an air of tran-
quil satisfaction round the well-ordered room, and some-
times to gaze indolently at the summer sky, he ate, and
drank, and read the news luxuriously.
The cheerful influence of the morning seemed to have
some effect, even upon his equable temper. His manner
was unusually gay; his smile more placid and agreeable
than usual; his voice more clear and pleasant. He laid
down the newspaper he had been reading; leaned back
upon his pillow with the air of one who resigned him-

131
self to a train of charming recollections; and after a
pause, soliloquised as follows:
“And my friend the centaur, goes the way of his
mama! I am not surprised. And his mysterious friend
Mr. Dennis, likewise! I am not surprised. And my old
postman, the exceedingly free-and-easy young madman
of Chigwell! I am quite rejoiced. It's the very best
thing that could possibly happen to him.”
After delivering himself of these remarks, he fell
again into his smiling train of reflection: from which he
roused himself at length to finish his chocolate, which
was getting cold, and ring the bell for more.
The new supply arriving, he took the cup from his
servant's hand; and saying with a charming affability,
“I am obliged to you, Peak,” dismissed him.
“It is a remarkable circumstance,” he mused, dallying
lazily with the tea-spoon, “ that my friend the madman
should have been within an ace of escaping, on his trial;
and it was a good stroke of chance (or, as the world
would say, a providential occurrence) that the brother
of my Lord Mayor should have been in court, with other
country justices, into whose very dense heads curiosity
had penetrated. For though the brother of my Lord
Mayor was decidedly wrong; and established his near
relationship to that amusing person beyond all doubt,
in stating that my friend was sane, and had to his
knowledge wandered about the country with a vaga-
bond parent, avowing revolutionary and rebellious senti-
ments; I am not the less obliged to him for volunteer-
ing that evidence. These insane creatures make such
very odd and embarrassing remarks, that they really
ought to be hanged for the comfort of society."
The country justice had indeed turned the wavering
scale against poor Barnaby, and solved the doubt that
trembled in his favour. Grip little thought how much
he had to answer for.
“They will be a singular party,” said Sir John, lean-
ing his head upon his hand, and sipping his chocolate;
“a very curious party. The hangman himself; the
centaur; and the madman. The centaur would make a
very handsome preparation in Surgeons' Hall, and would
benefit science extremely. I hope they have taken care
to bespeak him.-Peak, I am not at home, of course, to
anybody but the hair-dresser.”

This reminder to his servant was called forth by a
knock at the door, which the man hastened to open.
After a prolonged murmur of question and answer, he
returned; and as he cautiously closed the room-door be-
hind him, a man was heard to cough in the passage.
“Now, it is of no use, Peak,” said Sir John, raising
his hand in deprecation of his delivering any message;
“I am not at home. I cannot possibly hear you. I told
you I was not at home, and my word is sacred. Will
you never do as you are desired?”
Having nothing to oppose to this reproof, the man was
about to withdraw, when the visitor who had given oc-
casion to it, probably rendered impatient by delay,
knocked with his knuckles at the chamber-door, and
called out that he had urgent business with Sir John
Chester, which admitted of no delay.
“Let him in,” said Sir John. “My good fellow," he
added, when the door was opened, “how come you to
intrude yourself in this extraordinary manner upon the
privacy of a gentleman? How can you be so wholly
destitute of self-respect as to be guilty of such remark-
able ill-breeding?”
“My business, Sir John, is not of a common kind, I do
assure you,” returned the person he addressed. “If I
have taken any uncommon course to get admission to
you, I hope I shall be pardoned on that account.” .
“ Well! we shall see, we shall see,” returned Sir John,
whose face cleared up when he saw who it was, and
whose prepossessing smile was now restored. “I am
sure we have met before,” he added, in his winning
tone, “but really I forget your name?"
“My name is Gabriel Varden, sir."
“Vården, of course, Varden,” returned Sir John, tap-
ping his forehead. “Dear me, how very defective my
memory becomes! Varden to be sure-Mr. Varden the
locksmith. You have a charming wife, Mr. Varden,
and a most beautiful daughter. They are well?”
Gabriel thanked him, and said they were.
“I rejoice to hear it,” said Sir John. “ Commend me
to them when you return, and say that I wished I were
fortunate enough to convey, myself, the salute which I
entrust you to deliver. And what,” he asked very sweetly,
after a moment's pause, “can I do for you? You may
command me freely.”

“I thank you, Sir John,” said Gabriel, with some
pride in his manner, “but I have come to ask no favour
of you, though I come on business.-Private,” he added,
with a glance at the man, w:0 stood looking on, “and
very pressing business.”
“I cannot say you are the more welcome for being in-
dependent, and having nothing to ask of me,” returned
Sir John, graciously, “for I should have been happy to
render you a service; still, you are welcome on any
terms. Oblige me with some more chocolate, Peak, and
don't wait.”
The man retired, and left them alone.
“Sir John,” said Gabriel, “I am a working-man, and
have been so all my life. If I don't prepare you enough
for what I have to tell; if I come to the point too ab-
ruptly; and give you a shock, which a gentleman could
have spared you, or at all events lessened very much; I
hope you will give me credit for meaning well. I wish
to he careful and considerate, and I trust that in a
straight-forward person like me you'll take the will for
the deed.”
“Mr. Varden,” returned the other, perfectly composed
under this exordium; “I beg you'll take a chair. Choco-
late, perhaps, you don't relish? Well! it is an acquired
taste, no doubt.”
“ Sir John,” said Gabriel, who had acknowledged with
a bow the invitation to be seated, but had not availed
himself of it: “Sir John”—he dropped his voice and
drew nearer to the bed—“I am now come from New-
gate,"
“Good Gad!” cried Sir John, hastily sitting up in bed;
“from Newgate, Mr. Varden! How could you be so
very imprudent as to come from Newgate! Newgate,
where there are jail-fevers, and ragged people, and bare-
footed men and women, and a thousand horrors! Peak,
bring the camphor, quick! Heaven and earth, Mr.
Varden, my dear, good soul, how could you come from
Newgate ?
Gabriel returned no answer, but looked on in silence
while Peak (who had entered opportunely with the hot
chocolate) ran to a drawer, and returning with a bottle,
sprinkled his master's dressing-gown and the bedding;
and besides moistening the locksmith himself, plenti-
fully, described a circle round about him on the carpet.

When he had done this, he again retired; and Sir John,
reclining in an easy attitude upon his pillow, once more
turned a smiling face towards his visitor.
“You will forgive me, Mr. Varden, I am sure, for
being at first a little sensitive both on your account and
my own. I confess I was startled, notwithstanding your
delicate exordium. Might I ask you to do me the favour
not to approach any nearer?—You have really come
from Newgate!”
The locksmith inclined his head.
“In-deed! And now, Mr. Varden, all exaggeration
and embellishment apart,” said Sir John Chester, confi-
dentially, as he sipped his chocolate, “what kind of place
is Newgate?”
“A strange place, Sir John,” returned the locksmith,
" of a sad and doleful kind. A strange place, where
many strange things are heard and seen; but few more
strange than that I come to tell you of. The case is
urgent. I am sent here."
“Not-no, no-not from the jail?"
“Yes, Sir John; from the jail.”
“And my good, credulous, open-hearted friend,” said
Sir John, setting down his cup, and laughing—“by
whom?"
“By a man called Dennis—for many years the hang-
man, and to-morrow morning the hanged,” returned
the locksmith.
Sir John had expected-had been quite certain from
the first-that he would say he had come from Hugh,
and was prepared to meet him on that point. But this
answer occasioned him a degree of astonishment which,
for the moment, he could not, with all his command of
feature, prevent his face from expressing. He quickly
subdued it, however, and said in the same light tone:
“ And what does the gentleman require of me? My
memory may be at fault again, but I don't recollect
that I ever had the pleasure of an introduction to him,
or that I ever numbered him among my personal friends,
I do assure you, Mr. Varden.”
“Sir John,” returned the locksmith, gravely, “I will
tell you, as nearly as I can, in the words he used to me,
what he desires that you should know, and what you
ought to know without a moment's loss of time.”
Sir John Chester settled himself in a position of

135
greater repose, and looked at his visitor with an expres-
sion of face which seemed to say, “ This is an amusing
fellow! I'll hear him out.”
“You may have seen in the newspapers, sir,” said
Gabriel, pointing to the one which lay by his side, that
I was a witness against this man upon his trial some
days since; and that it was not his fault I was alive and
able to speak to what I knew.”
May have seen!” cried Sir John. “My dear Mr.
Varden, you are quite a public character, and live in all
men's thoughts most deservedly. Nothing can exceed
the interest with which I read your testimony, and re-
membered that I had the pleasure of a slight acquaint-
ance with you. I hope we shall haye your portrait
published?"
“ This morning, sir,” said the locksmith, taking no
notice of these compliments, “early this morning, a
message was brought to me from Newgate, at this man's
request, desiring that I would go and see him, for he
had something particular to communicate. I needn't tell
you that he is no friend of mine, and that I had never
seen him until the rioters beset my house."
Sir John fanned himself gently with the newspaper,
and nodded.
“I knew, however, from the general report,” resumed
Gabriel, “that the order for his execution to-morrow
went down to the prison last night; and looking upon
him as a dying man, I complied with his request.”
“You are quite a Christian, Mr. Varden,” said Sir
John; “and in that amiable capacity you increase my
desire that you should take a chair.”
“He said,” continued Gabriel, looking steadily at the
knight, “ that he had sent to me, because he had no
friend or companion in the whole world (being the com-
mon hangman), and because he believed, from the way
in which I had given my evidence, that I was an honest
man, and would act truly by him. He said that, being
shunned by every one who knew his calling, even by
people of the lowest and most wretched grade, and find-
ing, when he joined the rioters, that the men he acted
with had no suspicion of it (which I believe is true
enough, for a poor fool of an old 'prentice of mine was
one of them), he had kept his own counsel, up to the
time of his being taken and put in jail.”

BARNABY RUDGE.
“Very discreet of Mr. Dennis,” observed Sir John,
with a slight yawn, though still with the utmost affa-
bility, “but-except for your admirable and lucid man-
ner of telling it, which is perfect—not very interesting
to me.”
“When,” pursued the locksmith, quite unabashed and
wholly regardless of these interruptions, “when he was
taken to the jail, he found that his fellow-prisoner, in
the same room, was a young man, Hugh by name, a
leader in the riots, who had been betrayed and given up
by himself. From something which fell from this un-
happy creature, in the course of the angry words they
had at meeting, he discovered that his mother had suf-
fered the death to which they both are now condemned.
The time is very short, Sir John.”
The knight laid down his paper fan, replaced his cup
upon the table at his side, and, saving for the smile
that lurked about his mouth, looked at the locksmith
with as much steadiness as the locksmith looked at
him.
“ They have been in prison now a month. One con-
versation led to many more; and the hangman soon
found, from a comparison of time, and place, and dates,
that he had executed the sentence of the law upon this
woman himself. She had been tempted by want—as
so many people are-into the easy crime of passing
forged notes. She was young and handsome; and the
traders who employ men, women, and children in this
traffic, looked upon her as one who was well adapted
for their business, and who would probably go on with-
out suspicion for a long time. But they were mistaken;
for she was stopped in the commission of her very first
offence, and died for it. She was of gipsy blood, Sir
John-
It might have been the effect of a passing cloud which
obscured the sun, and cast a shadow on his face; but
the knight turned deadly pale. Still he met the lock-
smith's eye as before.
“She was of gipsy blood, Sir John,” repeated Gabriel,
“and had a high, free spirit. This, and her good looks,
and her lofty manner, interested some gentlemen who
were easily moved by dark eyes; and efforts were made
to save her. They might have been successful if she
would have given them any clue to her history. But
ft might havsun, and als pale.
Still men his lud which

she never would, or did. There was reason to suspect
that she would make an attempt upon her life. A watch
was set upon her night and day; and from that time she
never spoke again-”.
Sir John stretched out his hand towards his cup. The
locksmith going on, arrested it half-way.
-“Until she had but a minute to live. Then she broke
silence and said, in a low, firm voice which no one heard
but this executioner, for all other living creatures had
retired and left her to her fate, 'If I had a dagger within
these fingers and he was within my reach, I would strike
him dead before me, even now! The man asked · Who?'
She said, “The father of her boy.'”
Sir John drew back his outstretched hand, and seeing
that the locksmith paused, signed to him, with easy
politeness and without any new appearance of emotion,
to proceed.
* It was the first word she had ever spoken from which
it could be understood that she had any relative on
earth. "Was the child alive?' he asked. “Yes.' He
asked her where it was, its name, and whether she had
any wish respecting it. She had but one, she said. It
was that the boy might live, and grow, in utter ignor-
ance of his father, so that no arts might teach him to be
gentle and forgiving. When he became a man, she
trusted to the God of their tribe to bring the father and
the son together, and revenge her through her child. He
asked her other questions, but she spoke no more. In-
deed, he says she scarcely said this much to him, but
stood with her face turned upwards to the sky, and
never looked towards him once.”
Sir John took a pinch of snuff; glanced approvingly
at an elegant little sketch, entitled “Nature,” on the
wall; and raising his eyes to the locksmith's face again,
said, with an air of courtesy and patronage, “You were
observing, Mr. Varden”
“That she never,” returned the locksmith, who was
not to be diverted by any artifice from his firm manner,
and his steady gaze," that she never looked towards
him once, Sir John; and so she died, and he forgot her.
But, some years afterwards, a man was sentenced to
die the same death, who was a gipsy, too; a sunburnt,
swarthy fellow, almost a wild man; and while he lay in
prison, under sentence, he, who had seen the hangman

more than once while he was free, cut an image of him
on his stick, by way of braving death, and showing
those who attended on him how little he cared or thought
about it. He gave this stick into his hands at Tyburn,
and told him then that the woman I have spoken of had
left her own people to join a fine gentleman, and that,
being deserted by him and cast off by her old friends,
she had sworn within her own proud breast that, what-
ever her misery might be, she would ask no help of any
human being. He told him that she had kept her word
to the last; and that, meeting even him in the streets-
he had been fond of her once, it seems—she had slipped
from him by a trick, and he never saw her again, until,
being in one of the frequent crowds at Tyburn, with
some of his rough companions, he had been driven al-
most mad by seeing, in the criminal under another
name, whose death he had come to witness, herself.
Standing in the same place in which she had stood, he
told the hangman this, and told him, too, her real name,
which only her own people and the gentleman for whose
sake she had left them, knew.-That name he will tell
again, Sir John, to none but you."
"To none but me!" exclaimed the knight, pausing in
the act of raising his cup to his lips with a perfectly
steady hand, and curling up his little finger for the
better display of a brilliant ring with which it was
ornamented: “but me!-My dear Mr. Varden, how very
preposterous, to select me for his confidence! With you
at his elbow, too, who are so perfectly trustworthy!"
“Sir John, Sir John," returned the locksmith, “at
twelve to-morrow these men die. Hear the few words
I have to add, and do not hope to deceive me; for though
I am a plain man of humble station, and you are a
gentleman of rank and learning, the truth raises me to
your level, and I know that you anticipate the dis-
closure with which I am about to end, and that you be-
lieve this doomed man, Hugh, to be your son."
“Nay,” said Sir John, bantering him with a gay air;
“the wild gentleman, who died so suddenly, scarcely
went as far as that, I think?”
“He did not,” returned the locksmith, “for she had
bound him by some pledge, known only to these people,
and which the worst among them respect, not to tell
your name: but, in a fantastic pattern on the stick, he

he had carved some letters, and when the hangman
asked it, he bade him, especially if he should ever
meet with her son in after life, remember that place
well.”
“What place?"
“Chester.”
The knight finished his cup of chocolate with an ap-
pearance of infinite relish, and carefully wiped his lips
upon his handkerchief.
“Sir John," said the locksmith, “ this is all that has
been told to me; but since these two men have been left
for death, they have conferred together closely. See
them, and hear what they can add. See this Dennis,
and learn from him what he has not trusted to me. If
you, who hold the clue to all, want corroboration (which
you do not), the means are easy."
6 And to what,” said Sir John Chester, rising on his
elbow, after smoothing the pillow for its reception;
“my dear, good-natured, estimable Mr. Varden-with
whom I cannot be angry if I would—to what does all
this tend?"
“I take you for a man, Sir John, and I suppose it tends
to some pleading of natural affection in your breast,” re-
turned the locksmith. “I suppose to the straining of
every nerve and the exertion of all the influence you
have, or can make, in behalf of your miserable son, and
the man who has disclosed his existence to you. At the
worst, I suppose to your seeing your son and awakening
him to a sense of his crime and danger. He has no such
sense now. Think what his life must have been, when
he said in my hearing that if I moved you to anything
it would be to hastening his death, and ensuring his
silence, if you had it in your power!"
“And have you, my good Mr. Varden,” said Sir John,
in a tone of mild reproof, “ have you really lived to your
present age and remained so very simple and credulous
as to approach a gentleman of established character
with such credentials as these, from desperate men in
their last extremity, catching at any straw? Oh, dear!
Oh, fie, fie!”
The locksmith was going to interpose, but he stopped
him:
“On any other subject, Mr. Varden, I shall be de-
lighted-I shall be charmed-to converse with you, but

I owe it to my own character not to pursue this topic for
another moment.”
“ Think better of it, sir, when I am gone,” returned the
locksmith; “think better of it, sir. Although you have,
thrice within as many weeks, turned your lawful son,
Mr. Edward, from your door, you may have time, you
may have years, to make your peace with him, Sir John:
but that twelve o'clock will soon be here, and soon be
past forever."
“I thank you very much," returned the knight, kiss-
ing his delicate hand to the locksmith, “ for your guile-
less advice; and I only wish, my good soul, although
your simplicity is quite captivating, that you had a
little more worldly wisdom. I never so much regretted
the arrival of my hair-dresser as I do at this moment.
God bless you! Good-morning! You'll not forget my
message to the ladies, Mr. Varden? Peak, show Mr.
Varden to the door.”
Gabriel said no more, but gave the knight a parting
look and left him. As he quitted the room, Sir John's
face changed; and the smile gave place to a haggard
and anxious expression, like that of a weary actor jaded
by the performance of a difficult part. He rose from his
bed with a heavy sigh and wrapped himself in his morn-
ing-gown.
So, she kept her word,” he said, “and was constant
to her threat! I would I had never seen that dark face
of hers—I might have read these consequences in it,
from the first. This affair would make a noise abroad,
if it rested upon better evidence; but, as it is, and by not
joining the scattered links of the chain, I can afford to
slight it.—Extremely distressing to be the parent of such
an uncouth creature! Still, I gave him very good advice.
I told him he would certainly be hanged. I could have
done no more if I had known of our relationship; and
there are a great many fathers who have never done as
much for their natural children. The hair-dresser may
come in, Peak!"
The hair-dresser came in; and saw in Sir John Chester
(whose accommodating conscience was soon quieted by
the numerous precedents that occurred to him in sup-
port of his last observation) the same imperturbable,
fascinating, elegant gentleman he had seen yesterday,
and many yesterdays before.

CHAPTER XVIII.
As the locksmith walked slowly away from Sir John
Chester's chambers, he lingered under the trees which
shaded the path, almost hoping that he might be sum-
moned to return. He had turned back thrice, and still
loitered at the corner, when the clock struck twelve.
It was a solemn sound, and not merely for its refer-
ence to to-morrow; for he knew that in that chime the
murderer's knell was rung. He had seen him pass along
the crowded street amidst the execrations of the throng;
had marked his quivering lip and trembling limbs; the
ashy hue upon his face, his clammy brow, the wild dis-
traction of his eve-the fear of death that swallowed up
all other thoughts, and gnawed without cessation at his
heart and brain. He had marked the wandering look,
seeking for hope, and finding, turn where it would,
despair. He had seen the remorseful, pitiful, desolate
creature riding with his coffin by his side to the gibbet.
He knew that to the last he had been an unyielding, ob-
durate man; that in the savage terror of his condition
he had hardened, rather than relented, to his wife
and child; and that the last words which had passed his
white lips were curses on them as his enemies.
Mr. Haredale had determined to be. there and see it
done. Nothing but the evidence of his own senses could
satisfy that gloomy thirst for retribution which had been
gathering upon him for so many years. The locksmith
knew this, and when the chimes had ceased to vibrate,
hurried away to meet him.
“For these two men,” he said, as he went, “I can do
no more. Heaven have mercy on them! Alas! I say I
can do no more for them, but whom can I help? Mary
Rudge will have a home, and a firm friend when she
most wants one; but Barnaby-poor Barnaby—willing
Barnaby—what aid can I render him? There are many,
many men of sense, God forgive me,” cried the honest
locksmith, stopping in a narrow court to pass his hand
across his eyes, “I could better afford to lose than Bar-
naby. We have always been good friends, but I never
knew till now how much I loved the lad."

There were not many in the great city who thought of
Barnaby that day, otherwise than as an actor in a show
which was to take place to-morrow. But, if the whole
population had had him in their minds, and had wished
his life to be spared, not one among them could have
done so with a purer zeal or greater singleness of heart
than the good locksmith.
Barnaby was to die. There was no hope. It is not
the least evil attendant upon the frequent exhibition of
this last dread punishment, of Death, that it hardens
the minds of those who deal it out, and makes them,
though they be amiable men in other respects, indiffer-
ent to, or unconscious of, their great responsibility.
The word had gone forth that Barnaby was to die. It
went forth, every month, for lighter crimes. It was a
thing so common, that very few were startled by the
awful sentence, or cared to question its propriety. Just
then, too, when the law had been so flagrantly out-
raged, its dignity must be asserted. The symbol of its
dignity-stamped upon every page of the criminal
statute-book-was the gallows; and Barnaby was to die.
They had tried to save him. The locksmith had car-
ried petitions and memorials to the fountain-head, with
his own hands. But the well was not one of mercy, and
Barnaby was to die.
From the first, his mother had never left him, save at
night; and with her beside him, he was as usual con-
tented. On this last day, he was more elated and more
proud than he had been yet; and when she dropped the
book she had been reading to him aloud, and fell upon
his neck, he stopped in his busy task of folding a piece
of crape about his hat, and wondered at her anguish.
Grip uttered a feeble croak, half in encouragement, it
seemed, and half in remonstrance, but he wanted heart
to sustain it, and lapsed abruptly into silence.
With them, who stood upon the brink of the great
gulph which none can see beyond, Time, so soon to lose
itself in vast Eternity, rolled on like a mighty river,
swoln and rapid as it nears the sea. It was morning
but now; they had sat and talked together in a dream;
and here was evening. The dreadful hour of separa-
tion, which even yesterday had seemed so distant, was
at hand.
They walked out into the court-yard, clinging to each

other, but not speaking. Barnaby knew that the jail
was a dull, sad, miserable place, and looked forward to
to-morrow as to a passage from it to something bright
and beautiful. He had a vague impression, too, that he
was expected to be brave—that he was a man of great
consequence, and that the prison people would be glad
to make him weep. He trod the ground more firmly as
he thought of this, and bade her take heart and cry
no more, and feel how steady his hand was. “They
call me silly, mother. They shall see-to-morrow!"
Dennis and Hugh were in the court-yard. Hugh came ·
forth from his cell as they did, stretching himself as
though he had been sleeping. Dennis sat upon a bench
in a corner, with his knees and chin huddled together,
and rocked himself to and fro like a person in severe
pain.
The mother and son remained on one side of the court,
and these two men upon the other. Hugh strode up
and down, glancing fiercely every now and then at the
bright summer sky, and looking round, when he had
done so, at the walls.
“No reprieve, no reprieve! Nobody comes near us.
There's only the night left now!” moaned Dennis faintly,
as he wrung his hands. “Do you think they'll reprieve
me in the night, brother? I've known reprieves come in
the night, afore now. I've known 'em come as late as
five, six, and seven o'clock in the morning. Don't you
think there's a good chance yet-don't you? Say you
do. Say you do, young man," whined the miserable
creature, with an imploring gesture towards Barnaby,
“ or I shall go mad!"
" Better mad than sane, here,” said Hugh. “Go mad!”
“But tell me what you think. Somebody tell me what
he thinks!” cried the wretched object--so mean, and
wretched, and despicable, that even Pity's self might
have turned away, at sight of such a being in the like-
ness of a man-“ isn't there a chance for me--isn't there
a good chance for me? Isn't it likely they may be doing
this to frighten me? Don't you think it is? Oh!” he
almost shrieked, as he wrung his hands, “won't any-
body give me comfort!”
"You ought to be the best, instead of the worst,” said
Hugh, stopping before him. “Ha, ha, ha! See the
hangman, when it comes home to him!”

BARNABY RUDGE.
“You don't know what it is,” cried Dennis, actually
writhing as he spoke: “I do. That I should come to
be worked off! I! I! That I should come!”
“And why not?” said Hugh, as he thrust back his
matted hair to get a better view of his late associate.
“How often, before I knew your trade, did I hear you
talking of this as if it was a treat?"
“I ain't unconsistent,” screamed the miserable crea-
ture; “ I'd talk so again, if I was hangman. Some
other man has got my old opinions at this minute. That
makes it worse. Somebody's longing to work me off. I
know by myself that somebody must be!
“He'll soon have his longing,” said Hugh, resuming
his walk. “Think of that, and be quiet.”
Although one of these men displayed, in his speech
and bearing, the most reckless hardihood; and the other,
in his every word and action, testified such an extreme
of abject cowardice that it was humiliating to see him;
it would be difficult to say which of them would most
have repelled and shocked an observer. Hugh's was the
dogged desperation of a savage at the stake; the hang-
man was reduced to a condition little better, if any, than
that of a hound with the halter round his neck. Yet, as
Mr. Dennis knew and could have told them, these were
the two commonest states of mind in persons brought to
their pass. Such was the wholesale growth of the seed
sown by the law, that this kind of harvest was usually
looked for, as a matter of course.
In one respect they all agreed. The wandering and
uncontrollable train of thought, suggesting sudden
recollections of things distant and long forgotten and
remote from each other—the vague, restless craving for
something undefined, which nothing could satisfy the
swift flight of the minutes, fusing themselves into hours,
as if by enchantment—the rapid coming of the solemn
night--the shadow of death always upon them, and yet
so dim and faint, that objects the meanest and most
trivial started from the gloom beyond, and forced them-
selves upon the view-the impossibility of holding the
mind, even if they had been so disposed, to penitence
and preparation, or of keeping it to any point while one
hideous fascination tempted it away—these things were
common to them all, and varied only in their outward
tokens,

“Fetch me the book I left within-upon your bed,”
she said to Barnaby, as the clock struck.“ Kiss me
first!"
He looked in her face, and saw there that the time
was come. After a long embrace, he tore himself away,
and ran to bring it to her, bidding her not stir till he
came back. He soon returned, for a shriek recalled
him-but she was gone.
He ran to the yard gate and looked through. They
were carrying her away. She had said her heart would ·
break. It was better so.
“Don't you think,” whimpered Dennis, creeping up to
him as he stood with his feet rooted to the ground,
gazing at the blank walls—" don't you think there is
still a chance? It's a dreadful end; it's a terrible end
for a man like me. Don't you think there's a chance?
I don't mean for you, I mean for me. Don't let him
hear us” (meaning Hugh); “he's so desperate.”
“Now, then," said the officer, who had been lounging
in and out with his hands in his pockets, and yawning
as if he were in the last extremity for some subject of
interest; “it's time to turn in, boys.”
“Not yet,” cried Dennis, “not yet. Not for an hour
yet.”
“I say-your watch goes different from what it used
to,” returned the man. “Once upon a time it was al-
ways too fast. It's got the other fault now.”
"My friend,” cried the wretched creature, falling on
his knees, “my dear friend-you always were my dear
friend-there's some mistake. Some letter has been
mislaid, or some messenger has been stopped upon the
way. He may have fallen dead. I saw a man once
fall down dead in the street, myself, and he had papers
in his pocket. Send to inquire. Let somebody go to
inquire. They never will hang me. They never can.
Yes, they will,” he cried, starting to his feet with a ter-
rible scream. “They'll hang me by a trick, and keep
the pardon back. It's a plot against me. I shall lose
my life!" And uttering another yell, he fell in a fit
upon the ground.
“See the hangman when it comes home to him!”
cried Hugh again, as they bore him away. “Ha, ha, ha!
Courage, bold Barnaby, what care we! Your hand!
They do well to put us out of the world, for if we get

loose a second time, we wouldn't let them off so easy,
eh? Another shake! A man can die but once. If you
wake in the night, sing that out lustily, and fall asleep
again. Ha, ha, ha!”
Barnaby glanced once more through the grate into
the empty yard; and then watched Hugh as he strode to
the steps leading to his sleeping-cell. He heard him
shout, and burst into a roar of laughter, and saw him
flourish his hat. Then he turned away himself, like one
who walked in his sleep; and, without any sense of fear
or sorrow, lay down on his pallet, listening for the clock
to strike again.
CHAPTER XIX.
THE time wore on. The noises in the streets became
less frequent by degrees, until silence was scarcely
broken save by the bells in church towers, marking the
progress-softer and more stealthy while the city slum-
bered—of that Great Watcher with the hoary head, who
never sleeps or rests. In the brief interval of darkness
and repose which feverish towns enjoy, all busy sounds
were hushed; and those who awoke from dreams lay
listening in their beds, and longed for dawn, and wished
the dead of the night were past.
Into the street outside the jail's main wall workmen
came straggling at this solemn hour, in groups of two
or three, and meeting in the centre cast their tools upon
the ground and spoke in whispers. Others soon issued
from the jail itself, bearing on their shoulders planks,
and beams; these materials being all brought forth, the
rest bestirred themselves, and the dull sound of hammers
began to echo through the stillness.
Here and there among this knot of labourers, one,
with a lantern or a smoky link, stood by to light his fel-
lows at their work; and by its doubtful aid some might
be dimly seen taking up the pavement of the road, while
others held great upright posts, or fixed them in the
holes thus made for their reception. Some dragged
slowly on towards the rest an empty cart, which they
brought rumbling from the prison yard; while others
erected strong barriers across the street. All were busily
engaged. Their dusky figures moving to and fro, at that

unusual hour, so active and so silent, might have been
taken for those of shadowy creatures toiling at midnight
on some ghostly, unsubstantial work, which, like them-
selves, would vanish with the first gleam of day, and
leave but morning mist and vapour.
While it was yet dark, a few lookers-on collected, who
had plainly come there for the purpose and intended to
remain; even those who had to pass the spot on their
way to some other place lingered, and lingered yet, as
though the attraction of that were irresistible. Mean-
while the noise of saw and mallet went on briskly, min-
gled with the clattering of boards on the stone pavement
of the road, and sometimes with the workmen's voices
as they called to one another. Whenever the chimes of
the neighbouring church were heard—and that was every
quarter of an hour-a strange sensation, instantaneous
and indescribable, but perfectly obvious, seemed to per-
vade them all.
Gradually, a faint brightness appeared in the east, and
the air, which had been very warm all through the night,
felt cool and chilly. Though there was no daylight yet,
the darkness was diminished, and the stars looked pale.
The prison, which had been a mere black mass with
little shape or form, put on its usual aspect; and ever
and anon a solitary watchman could be seen upon its
roof, stopping to look down upon the preparations
in the street. This man, from forming, as it were,
part of the jail, and knowing, or being supposed to know,
all that was passing within, became an object of as much
interest, and was as eagerly looked for, and as awfully
pointed out, as if he had been a spirit.
By-and-bye, the feeble light grew stronger, and the
houses with their sign-boards and inscriptions stood
plainly out, in the dull grey morning. Heavy stage
wagons crawled from the inn-yard opposite; and travel-
lers peeped out; and as they rolled sluggishly away, cast
many a backward look towards the jail. And now the
sun's first beams came glancing into the street; and the
night's work, which in its various stages and in the
varied fancies of the lookers-on had taken a hundred
shapes, wore its own proper form-a scaffold and a
gibbet.
As the warmth of cheerful day began to shed itself
upon the scanty crowd, the murmur of tongues was

heard, shutters were thrown open, and blinds drawn up,
and those who had slept in rooms over against the
prison, where places to see the execution were let at
high prices, rose hastily from their beds. In some of
the houses, people were busy taking out the window
sashes for the better accommodation of spectators; in
others, the spectators were already seated, and beguil-
ing the time with cards, or drink, or jokes among
themselves. Some had purchased seats upon the house.
tops and were already crawling to their stations from
parapet and garret window. Some were yet bargaining
for good places, and stood in them in a state of inde-
cision: gazing at the slowly-swelling crowd, and at the
workmen as they rested listlessly against the scaffold-
affecting to listen with indifference to the proprietor's
eulogy of the commanding view his house afforded, and
the surpassing cheapness of his terms.
A fairer morning never shone. From the roofs and
upper stories of these buildings, the spires of city churches
and the great cathedral dome were visible, rising up
beyond the prison, into the blue sky, and clad in the
colour of light summer clouds, and showing in the clear
atmosphere their every scrap of tracery and fret-work,
and every niche and loophole. All was brightness and
promise, excepting in the street below, into which (for
it yet lay in shadow) the eye looked down as into a dark
trench, where in the midst of so much life, and hope,
and renewal of existence, stood the terrible instrument
of death. It seemed as if the very sun forbore to look
upon it.
But it was better, grim and sombre in the shade, than
when, the day being more advanced, it stood confessed
in the full glare and glory of the sun, with its black
paint blistering, and its nooses dangling in the light like
loathsome garlands. It was better in the solitude and
gloom of midnight with a few forms clustering about it,
ihan in the freshness and the stir of morning: the centre
of an eager crowd. It was better haunting the street
like a spectre, when men were in their beds, and influ-
encing perchance the city's dreams, than braving the
broad day, and thrusting its obscene presence upon their
waking senses.
Five o'clock had struck—six-seven--and eight. Along
the two main streets at either end of the cross-way, a

living stream had now set in, rolling towards the marts
of gain and business. Carts, coaches, wagons, trucks,
and barrows, forced a passage through the outskirts of
the throng, and clattered onward in the same direction.
Some of these, which were public conveyances and had
come from a short distance in the country, stopped; and
the driver pointed to the gibbet with his whip, though
he might have spared himself the pains, for the heads
of all the passengers were turned that way without his
help, and the coach windows were stuck full of staring
eyes. In some of the carts and wagons women might
be seen glancing fearfully at the same unsightly thing,
and even little children were held up above the people's
heads to see what kind of toy a gallows was, and learn
how men were hanged.
Two rioters were to die before the prison, who had
been concerned in the attack upon it; and one directly
afterwards in Bloomsbury Square. At nine o'clock a
strong body of military marched into the street, and
formed and lined a narrow passage into Holborn, which
had been indifferently kept all night by constables.
Through this another cart was brought (the one already
mentioned had been employed in the construction of the
scaffold), and wheeled up to the prison gate. These
preparations made, the soldiers stood at ease; the officers
lounged to and fro in the alley they had made, or talked
together at the scaffold's foot; and the concourse, which
had been rapidly augmenting for some hours, and still
received additions every minute, waited with an impa-
tience which increased with every chime of St. Sepul-
chre's clock, for twelve at noon.
Up to this time they had been very quiet, comparatively
silent, save when the arrival of some new party at a
window, hitherto unoccupied, gave them something
new to look at or to talk of. But as the hour approached
a buzz and hum arose, which, deepening every moment,
soon swelled into a roar and seemed to fill the air. No
words or even voices could be distinguished in this
clamour, nor did they speak much to each other; though
such as were better informed upon the topic than the
rest would tell their neighbours, perhaps that they
might know the hangman when he came out, by his
- being the shorter one: and that the man who was to
suffer with him was named Hugh: and that it was

Barnaby Rudge who would be hanged in Bloomsbury
Square.
The hum grew, as the time drew near, so loud that
those who were at the windows could not hear the
church-clock strike, though it was close at hand. Nor
had they any need to hear it, either, for they could see
it in the people's faces. So surely as another quarter
chimed, there was a movement in the crowd-as if some-
thing had passed over it—as if the light upon them had
been changed-in which the fact was readable as on a
brazen dial, figured by a giant's hand.
Three quarters past eleven! The murmur now was
deafening, yet every man seemed mute. Look where
you would among the crowd you saw strained eyes and
lips compressed; it would have been difficult for the most
vigilant observer to point this way or that and say that
yonder man had cried out. It were as easy to detect the
motion of lips in a sea-shell.
Three quarters past eleven! Many spectators who
had retired from the windows, came back refreshed, as
though their watch had just begun. Those who had
fallen asleep, roused themselves; and every person in
the crowd made one last effort to better his position-
which caused a press against the sturdy barriers that
made them bend and yield like twigs. The officers, who
until now had kept together, fell into their several posi-
tions, and gave the words of command. Swords were
drawn, muskets shouldered, and the bright steel wind-
ing its way among the crowd, gleamed and glittered in
the sun like a river. Along this shining path, two men
came hurrying on, leading a horse, which was speedily
harnessed to the cart at the prison door. Then, a pro-
found silence replaced the tumult that had so long been
gathering, and a breathless pause ensued. Every win-
dow was now choked up with heads; the house-tops
teemed with people-clinging to chimneys, peering over
gable-ends, and holding on where the sudden loosening
of any brick or stone would dash them down into the
street. The church tower, the church roof, the church-
yard, the prison leads, the very water-spouts and lamp-
posts-every inch of room-swarmed with human life.
At the first stroke of twelve the prison bell began to
toll. Then the roar--mingled now with cries of “Hats
off!” and “Poor fellows!” and, from some specks in the

151
great concourse, with a shriek or groan-burst forth
again. It was terrible to see-if any one in that dis-
traction of excitement could have seen-the world of
eager eyes, all strained upon the scaffold and the beam.
The hollow murmuring was heard within the jail as
plainly as without. The three were brought forth into
the yard, together, as it resounded through the air. They
knew its import well.
“D'ye hear?” cried Hugh, undaunted by the sound.
“They expect us! I heard them gathering when I woke
in the night, and turned over on t'other side and fell
asleep again. We shall see how they welcome the
hangman, now that it comes home to him. Ha, ha, ha!”
The Ordinary coming up at this moment, reproved
him for his indecent mirth, and advised him to alter
his demeanour.
“And why, master?” said Hugh. “Can I do better
than bear it easily? You bear it easily enough. Oh!
never tell me,” he cried, as the other would have spoken,
“for all your sad look and your solemn air, you think
little enough of it! They say you're the best maker of
lobster salads in London. Ha, ha! I've heard that,
you see, before now. Is it a good one, this morning-
is your hand in? How does the breakfast look? I hope
there's enough, and to spare, for all this hungry com-
pany that'll sit down to it, when the sight's over.”
“I fear,” observed the clergyman, shaking his head,
“ that you are incorrigible.”
“You're right. I am,” rejoined Hugh sternly. “Be
no hypocrite, master! You make a merry-making of
this, every month; let me be merry, too. If you want
a frightened fellow, there's one that'll suit you. Try
your hand upon him.”
He pointed, as he spoke, to Dennis, who, with his legs
trailing on the ground, was held between two men; and
who trembled so, that all his joints and limbs seemed
racked by spasms. Turning from this wretched spec-
tacle, he called to Barnaby, who stood apart.
“What cheer, Barnaby? Don't be downcast, lad.
Leave that to him.”
“Bless you,” cried Barnaby, stepping lightly towards
him, “ I'm not frightened, Hugh. "I'm quite happy. I
wouldn't desire to live now, if they'd let me. Look at
me! Am I afraid to die? Will they see me tremble?”

Hugh gazed for a moment at his face, on which there
was a strange, unearthly smile; and at his eye, which
sparkled brightly; and interposing between him and the
Ordinary, gruffly whispered to the latter:
“I wouldn't say much to him, master, if I was you.
He may spoil your appetite for breakfast, though you
are used to it.”
He was the only one of the three who had washed or
trimmed himself that morning. Neither of the others
had done so since their doom was pronounced. He still
wore the broken peacock's feather in his hat; and all his
usual scraps of finery were carefully disposed about his
person. His kindling eye, his firm step, his proud and
resolute bearing, might have graced some lofty act of
heroism; some voluntary sacrifice, born of a noble cause
and pure enthusiasm; rather than that felon's death.
But all these things increased his guilt. They were
mere assumptions. The law had declared it so, and so
it must be. The good minister had been greatly shocked,
not a quarter of an hour before, at his parting with
Grip. For one in his condition, to fondle a bird!
The yard was filled with people; bluff civic function-
aries, officers of justice, soldiers, the curious in such
matters, and guests who had been bidden as to a wed-
ding. Hugh looked around him, nodded gloomily to
some person in authority, who indicated with his hand
in what direction he was to proceed; and clapping Bar-
naby on the shoulder, passed out with the gait of a
lion.
They entered a large room, so near to the scaffold that
the voices of those who stood about it could be plainly
heard: some beseeching the javelin-men to take them
out of the crowd: others crying to those behind to stand
back, for they were pressed to death, and suffocating for
want of air.
In the middle of this chamber, two smiths, with ham-
mers, stood beside an anvil. Hugh walked straight up
to them, and set his foot upon it with a sound as though
it had been struck by a heavy weapon. Then, with
folded arms, he stood to have his irons knocked off:
scowling haughtily round, as those who were present
eyed him narrowly and whispered to each other.
It took so much time to drag Dennis in, that this cere-
mony was over with Hugh, and nearly over with

Barnaby, before he appeared. He no sooner came into
the place he knew so well, however, and among faces
with which he was so familiar, than he recovered
strength and sense enough to clasp his hands and make
a last appeal.
“Gentlemen, good gentlemen,” cried the abject crea-
ture, grovelling down upon his knees, and actually
prostrating himself upon the stone floor: “Governor,
dear governor-honourable sheriffs-worthy gentlemen
-have mercy upon a wretched man that has served his
Majesty, and the Law, and Parliament, for so many
years, and don't-don't let me die-because of a mis-
take."
“Dennis,” said the governor of the jail, “you know
what the course is, and that the order came with the
rest. You know that we could do nothing, even if we
would.”
“All I ask, sir-all I want and beg, is time, to make
it sure,” cried the trembling wretch, looking wildly
round for sympathy. “The King and Government
can't know it's me; I'm sure they can't know it's me;
or they never would bring me to this dreadful slaughter-
house. They know my name, but they don't know it's
the same man. Stop my execution-for charity's sake
stop my execution, gentlemen-till they can be told that
I've been hangman here, nigh thirty year. Will no one
go and tell them?” he implored, clenching his hands and
glaring round, and round, and round again will no
charitable person go and tell them!”
“Mr. Akerman,” said a gentleman who stood by, after
a moment's pause, “since it may possibly produce in this
unhappy man a better frame of mind, even at this last
minute, let me assure him that he was well known to
have been the hangman, when his sentence was con-
sidered.”
"s_But perhaps they think on that account that the
punishment's not so great,” cried the criminal, shuffling
towards this speaker on his knees, and holding up his
folded hands; * whereas it's worse, it's worse a hundred
times, to me than any man. Let them know that, sir.
Let them know that. They've made it worse to me
by giving me so much to do. Stop my execution till
they know that!”
The governor beckoned with his hand, and the two

men, who had supported him before, approached. He
uttered a piercing cry:
“Wait!" Wait. Only a moment-only one moment
more! Give me a last chance of reprieve. One of us
three is to go to Bloomsbury Square. Let me be the
one. It may come in that time; it's sure to come. In
the Lord's name let me be sent to Bloomsbury Square.
Don't hang me here. It's murder!”
They took him to the anvil: but even then he could
be heard above the clinking of the smith's hammers,
and the hoarse raging of the crowd, crying that he
know of Hugh's birth-that his father was living, and
was a gentleman of influence and rank-that he had
family secrets in his possession that he could tell
nothing unless they gave him time, but must die with
them on his mind; and he continued to rave in this sort
until his voice failed him, and he sank down a mere
heap of clothes between the two attendants.
It was at this moment that the clock struck the first
stroke of twelve, and the bell began to toll. The various
officers, with the two sheriffs at their head, moved
towards the door. All was ready when the last chime
came upon the ear.
They told Hugh this, and asked if he had anything
to say.
“To say!” he cried. “Not I. I'm ready.--Yes," he
added, as his eye fell upon Barnaby, “I have a word to
say, too. Come hither, lad.”
There was for the moment something kind, and even
tender, struggling in his fierce aspect, as he wrung his
poor companion by the hand. “I'll say this,” he cried,
looking firmly round, “that if I had ten lives to lose,
and the loss of each would give me ten times the agony of
the hardest death, I'd lay them all down-ay, I would,
though you gentlemen may not believe it—to save this
one. This one,” he added, wringing his hand again,
“ that will be lost through me.”
“Not through you," said the idiot, mildly. “Don't
· say that. You were not to blame. You have been
always very good to me. Hugh, we shall know what
makes the stars shine, now.”
“I took him from her in a reckless mood, and didn't
think what harm would come of it,” said Hugh, laying
his hand upon his head, and speaking in a lower voice.

155
“I ask her pardon and his. Look here," he added
roughly, in his former tone. “You see this lad?”
They murmured “Yes," and seemed to wonder why
he asked.
“That gentleman yonder” (pointing to the clergyman)
"has often in the last few days spoken to me of faith,
and strong belief. You see what I am-more brute than
man, as I have been often told-but I had faith enough
to believe, and did believe as strongly as any of you
gentlemen can believe anything, that this one life
would be spared. See what he is! Look at him!”
Barnaby had moved towards the door, and stood beck-
oning him to follow.
“ If this was not faith, and strong belief!” cried Hugh,
raising his right arm aloft, and looking upward like a
sarage prophet whom the near approach of Death had
filled with inspiration, “ where are they! What else
słould teach me-me, born as I was born, and reared as
I have been reared—to hope for any mercy in this
hardened cruel, unrelenting place. Upon these human
shambles, I, who never raised his hand in prayer till
now, call down the wrath of God! On that black tree,
of which I am the ripened fruit, I do invoke the curse of
al its victims, past, and present, and to come. On the
heid of that man, who, in his conscience, owns me for
his son, I leave the wish that he may never sicken on
his ied of down, but die a violent death as I do now, and
have the night-wind for his only mourner. To this I
say, Amen, amen!"
Hi: arm fell downward by his side; he turned and
movel towards them with a steady step, the man he had
been lefore.
“ Tlere is nothing more?” said the governor.
Hugh motioned Barnaby not to come near him (though
without looking in the direction where he stood) and
answered, “There is nothing more.”
“Moe forward!”
“_Tnless,” said Hugh, glancing hurriedly back,
“ —unless any person here has a fancy for a dog; and
not then, unless he means to use him well. There's one
belongs to me, at the house I came from, and it wouldn't
be easy to find a better. He'll whine at first, but he'll
soon gt over that.-You wonder that I think about a
dog jut now,” he added, with a kind of laugh. “If

any man deserved it of me half as well, I'd think of
him."
He spoke no more, but moved onward in his place,
with a careless air, though listening at the same time to
the Service for the Dead, with something between sullen
attention and quickened curiosity. As soon as he had
passed the door, his miserable associate was carried out;
and the crowd beheld the rest.
Barnaby would have mounted the steps at the same
time-indeed he would have gone before them, but in
both attempts he was restrained, as he was to undergo
the sentence elsewhere. In a few minutes the sheriffs
reappeared, the same procession was again formed, and
they passed through various rooms and passages to
another door-that at which the cart was waiting. He
held down his head to avoid seeing what he knew his
eyes must otherwise encounter, and took his seat scr-
rowfully, and yet with something of a childish pride and
pleasure, in the vehicle. The officers fell into their
places at the sides, in front, and in the rear; the sheriff's
carriages rolled on; a guard of soldiers surrounded the
whole; and they moved slowly forward through tie
throng and pressure towards Lord Mansfield's ruined
house.
It was a sad sight-all the show, and strength, and
glitter, assembled round one helpless creature-and
sadder yet to note, as he rode along, how his wandæing
thoughts found strange encouragement in the crovded
windows and the concourse in the streets; and low,
even then, he felt the influence of the bright sky, and
looked up, smiling, into its deep unfathomable blut. But
there had been many such sights since the riotí were
over-some so moving in their nature, and so repulsive,
too, that they were far more calculated to awaka pity
for the sufferers than respect for that law, whosestrong
arm seemed in more than one case to be as watonly
stretched forth now, that all was safe, as it hal been
basely paralysed in time of danger.
Two cripples-both mere boys-one with a leg of wood,
one who dragged his twisted limbs along by the help of
a crutch, were hanged in this same Bloomsbury Square.
As the cart was about to glide from under them, It was
observed that they stood with their faces from, hot to,
the house they had assisted to despoil; and their misery

157
was protracted that this omission might be remedied.
Another boy was hanged in Bow Street; other young
lads in various quarters of the town. Four wretched
women, too, were put to death. In a word, those who
suffered as rioters were, for the most part, the weakest,
meanest, and most miserable among them. It was an
exquisite satire upon the false religious joy which had
led to so much misery, that some of these people owned
themselves to be Catholics, and begged to be attended
by their own priests.
One young man was hanged in Bishopsgate Street,
whose aged, grey-headed father waited for him at the
gallows, kissed him at its foot when he arrived, and sat
there on the ground until they took him down. They
would have given him the body of his child; but he had
no hearse, no coffin, nothing to remove it in, being too
poor-and walked meekly away beside the cart that
took it back to prison, trying as he went to touch its
lifeless hand.
But the crowd had forgotten these matters, or cared
little about them if they lived in their memory:
and while one great multitude fought and hustled to
get near the gibbet before Newgate, for a parting look,
another followed in the train of poor lost Barnaby, to
swell the throng that waited for him on the spot.
CHAPTER XX.
On this same day, and about this very hour, Mr. Willet,
the elder, sat smoking his pipe in a chamber of the
Black Lion. Although it was hot summer weather, Mr.
Willet sat close to the fire. He was in a state of pro-
found cogitation, with his own thoughts, and it was his
custom at such times to stew himself slowly, under the
impression that that process of cookery was favourable
to the melting out of his ideas, which, when he began
to simmer, sometimes oozed forth so copiously as to
astonish even himself.
Mr. Willet had been several thousand times comforted
by his friends and acquaintance, with the assurance
that for the loss he had sustained in the Maypole, he
could “come upon the county.” But as this phrase

158
BARNABY RUDGE.
happened to bear an unfortunate resemblance to the
popular expression of " coming on the parish,” it sug-
gested to Mr. Willet's mind no more consolatory visions
than pauperism on an extensive scale, and ruin in a
capacious aspect. Consequently he had never failed to
receive the intelligence with a rueful shake of the head,
or a dreary stare, and had been always observed to ap-
pear much more melancholy after a visit of condolence
than at any other time in the whole four-and-twenty
hours.
It chanced, however, that sitting over the fire on this
particular occasion-perhaps because he was, as it were,
done to a turn; perhaps because he was in an unusually
bright state of mind; perhaps because he had considered
the subject so long; perhaps because of all these favouring
circumstances taken together-it chanced that, sitting
over the fire on this particular occasion, Mr. Willet did,
afar off and in the remotest depths of his intellect, per-
ceive a kind of lurking hint or faint suggestion, that out
of the public purse there might issue funds for the res-
toration of the Maypole to its former high place among
the taverns of the earth. And this dim ray of light did
so diffuse itself within him, and did so kindle up and
shine, that at last he had it as plainly and visibly before
him as the blaze by which he sat; and fully persuaded
that he was the first to make the discovery, and that he
had started, hunted down, fallen' upon, and knocked on
the head, a perfectly original idea which had never pre-
sented itself to any other man, alive or dead, he laid
down his pipe, rubbed his hands, and chuckled audibly.
“Why, father!” cried Joe, entering at the moment,
“you're in spirits to-day!"
“It's nothing partickler," said Mr. Willet, chuckling
again. “It's nothing at all partickler, Joseph. Tell me
something about the Salwanners.” Having preferred
this request, Mr. Willet chuckled a third time, and after
these unusual demonstrations of levity, he put his pipe
in his mouth again.
“What shall I tell you, father?” asked Joe, laying his
hand upon his sire's shoulder, and looking down into his
face. « That I have come back poorer than a church
moụse ? You know that. That I have come back
maimed and crippled? You know that.”
“It was took off,” muttered Mr. Willet, with his eyes

159
upon the fire, “at the defence of the Salwanners, in
America, where the war is.”
“Quite right,” returned Joe, smiling, and leaning
with his remaining elbow on the back of his father's
chair; “the very subject I came to speak to you about.
A man with one arm, father, is not of much use in the
busy world.”
This was one of those vast propositions which Mr.
Willet had never considered for an instant, and re-
quired time to “tackle.” Wherefore he made no an-
swer.
“At all events,” said Joe, “he can't pick and choose
his means of earning a livelihood, as another man may.
He can't say “I will turn my hand to this,' or 'I won't
turn my hand to that,' but must take what he can do,
and be thankful it's no worse. What did you say?"
Mr. Willet had been softly repeating to himself, in a
musing tone, the words “defence of the Salwanners:”
but he seemed embarrassed at having been overheard,
and answered, “Nothing.”
“Now, look here, father. Mr. Edward has come to
England from the West Indies. When he was lost
sight of (I ran away on the same day, father), he made
a voyage to one of the islands, where a school-friend of
his had settled; and, finding him, wasn't too proud to
be employed on his estate, and-and, in short, got on
well, and is prospering, and has come over here on busi-
ness of his own, and is going back again speedily. Our
returning nearly at the same time, and meeting in the
course of the late troubles, has been a good thing every
way; for it has not only enabled us to do old friends some
service, but has opened a path in life for me which I
may tread without being a burden upon you. To be
plain, father, he can employ me; I have satisfied myself
that I can be of real use to him; and I am going to carry
my one arm away with him, and to make the most of it.”
In the mind's eye of Mr. Willet the West Indies, and
indeed all foreign countries, were inhabited by savage
nations, who were perpetually burying pipes of peace,
flourishing tomahawks, and puncturing strange pat-
terns in their bodies. He no sooner heard this announce-
ment, therefore, than he leaned back in his chair, took
his pipe from his lips, and stared at his son with as much
dismay as if he already beheld him tied to a stake, and

tortured for the entertainment of a lively population.
In what form of expression his feelings would have
found a vent, it is impossible to say. Nor is it neces-
sary: for before a syllable occurred to him, Dolly Var-
den came running into the room, in tears, threw herself
on Joe's breast without a word of explanation, and
clasped her white arms round his neck.
“ Dolly!” cried Joe. “ Dolly!”
“Ay, call me that; call me that always,” exclaimed the
locksmith's little daughter; “ never speak coldly to me,
never be distant, never again reprove me for the follies
I have long repented, or I shall die, Joe.”
“I reprove you!” said Joe.
“Yes—for every kind and honest word you uttered
went to my heart. For you, who have borne so much
from me—for you, who owe your sufferings and pain
to my caprice-for you to be so kind—so noble to me,
Joe-”
He could say nothing to her. Not a syllable. There
was an odd sort of eloquence in his one arm, which had
crept round her waist: but his lips were mute.
"If you had reminded me by a word-only by one
short word,” sobbed Dolly, clinging yet closer to him,
“how little I deserved that you should treat me with
so much forbearance; if you had exulted only for one
moment in your triumph, I could have borne it better."
“Triumph!" repeated Joe, with a smile which seemed
to say, “I am a pretty figure for that.”
"Yes, triumph,” she cried, with her whole heart and
soul in her earnest voice and gushing tears; for it is
one. I am glad to think and know it is. I wouldn't be
less humbled, dear-I wouldn't be without the recollec-
tion of that last time we spoke together in this place-
no, not if I could recall the past, and make our parting
yesterday.”
Did ever lover look as Joe looked now!
“Dear Joe,” said Dolly, “I always loved you—in my
own heart I always did, although I was so vain and
giddy. I hoped you would come back that night. I
made quite sure you would. I prayed for it on my knees.
Through all these long, long years, I have never once
forgotten you, or left off hoping that this happy time
might come.”
The eloquence of Joe's arm surpassed the most impas-

161
sioned language; and so did that of his lips-yet he said
nothing, either.
“And now, at last,” cried Dolly, trembling with the
fervour of her speech, “ if you were sick, and shattered
in your every limb; if you were ailing, weak and sor-
rowful; if, instead of being what you are, you were in
everybody's eyes but mine the wreck and ruin of a man;
I would be your wife, dear love, with greater pride and
joy than if you were the stateliest lord in England!"
" What have I done,” cried Joe, “what have I done to
meet with this reward?”.
“You have taught me,” said Dolly, raising her pretty
face to his, “ to know myself and your worth; to be
something better than I was; to be more deserving of
your true and manly nature. In years to come, dear
Joe, you shall find that you have done so; for I will be,
not only now, when we are young and full of hope, but
when we have grown old and weary, your patient, gen-
tle, never-tiring wife. I will never know a wish or care
beyond our home and you, and I will always study how
to please you with my best affection and my most de.
voted love. I will: indeed I will!"
Joe could only repeat his former eloquence—but it was
very much to the purpose.
“They know of this at home,” said Dolly. “For
your sake I would leave even them; but they know it,
and are glad of it, and are as proud of you as I am, and
as full of gratitude. You'll not come and see me as a
poor friend who knew me when I was a girl, will you,
dear Joe?”
Well, well! It don't matter what Joe said in answer,
but he said a great deal; and Dolly said a great deal too:
and he folded Dolly in his one arm pretty tight, consider-
ing that it was but one; and Dolly made no resistance: and
if ever two people were happy in this world—which is
not an utterly miserable one, with all its faults-we
may, with some appearance of certainty, conclude that
they were.
To say that during these proceedings Mr. Willet the
elder underwent the greatest emotions of astonishment
of which our common nature is susceptible—to say
that he was in a perfect paralysis of surprise, and that he
wandered into the most stupendous and theretofore
unattainable heights of complicated amazement-would

be to shadow forth his state of mind in the feeblest and
lamest terms. If a roc, an eagle, a griffin, a flying ele-
phant, a winged sea-horse, had suddenly appeared, and,
taking him on his back, carried him bodily into the heart
of the “ Salwanners,” it would have been to him as an
every-day occurrence, in comparison with what he now
beheld. To be sitting quietly by, seeing and hearing
these things; to be completely overlooked, unnoticed,
and disregarded, while his son and a young lady were
talking to each other in the most impassioned manner,
kissing each other, and making themselves in all re-
spects perfectly at home; was a position so tremendous,
so inexplicable, so utterly beyond the widest range of
his capacity of comprehension, that he fell into a lethargy
of wonder, and could no more rouse himself than an en-
chanted sleeper in the first year of his fairy lease, a cen-
tury long.
"Father,” said Joe, presenting Dolly. “You know
who this is?”
Mr. Willet looked first at her, then at his son, then
back again at Dolly, and then made an ineffectual effort
to extract a whiff from his pipe, which had gone out
long ago.
"Say a word, father, if it's only "how d'ye do," "urged
Joe.
“Certainly, Joseph,"answered Mr. Willet. “Oh, yes!
Why not?”
“To be sure,” said Joe. “Why not?”
“Ah!” replied his father. “Why not?" and with this
remark, which he uttered in a low voice, as though he
were discussing some grave question with himself, he
used the little finger-if any of his fingers can be said to
have come under that denomination-of his right hand
as a tobacco-stopper, and was silent again.
And so he sat for half an hour at least, although
Dolly, in the most endearing of manners, hoped a dozen
times that he was not angry with her. So he sat for
half an hour, quite motionless, and looking all the while
like nothing so much as a great Dutch Pin or Skittle.
At the expiration of that period, he suddenly, and with-
out the least notice, burst (to the great consternation of
the young people) into a very loud and very short laugh;
and repeating, “ Ćertainly, Joseph. Oh, yes! Why not?"
went out for a walk.

CHAPTER XXI.
OLD John did not walk near the Golden Key, for be-
tween the Golden Key and the Black Lion there lay a
wilderness of streets-as everybody knows who is
acquainted with the relative bearings of Clerkenwell
and Whitechapel-and he was by no means famous for
pedestrian exercises. But the Golden Key lies in our
way, though it was out of his; so to the Golden Key this
chapter goes.
The Golden Key itself, fair emblem of the locksmith's
trade, had been pulled down by the rioters, and roughly
trampled under foot. But now it was hoisted up again
in all the glory of a new coat of paint, and showed more
bravely even than in days of yore. Indeed, the whole
house-front was spruce and trim, and so freshened up
throughout, that if there yet remained at large any of
the rioters who had been concerned in the attack upon
it, the sight of the old, goodly, prosperous dwelling, so
revived, must have been to them as gall and wormwood.
The shutters of the shop were closed, however, and
the window-blinds above were all pulled down, and in
place of its usual cheerful appearance, the house had a
look of sadness and an air of mourning, which the
neighbours, who in old days had often seen poor Bar-
naby go in and out, were at no loss to understand. The
door stood partly open; but the locksmith's hammer
was unheard; the cat sat moping on the ashy forge; all
was deserted, dark, and silent.
On the threshold of this door Mr. Haredale and Ed-
ward Chester met. The younger man gave place; and
both passing in with a familiar air, which seemed to
denote that they were tarrying there or were well-ac-
customed to go to and fro unquestioned, shut it behind
them.
Entering the old back parlour, and ascending the
flight of stairs, abrupt and steep, and quaintly fashioned
as of old, they turned into the best room, the pride of
Mrs. Varden's heart, and erst the scene of Miggs's house-
hold labours.

“ Varden brought the mother here last evening, he
told me?” said Mr. Haredale.
“She is above stairs now-in the room over here,”
Edward rejoined. “Her grief, they say, is past all tell-
ing. I needn't add-for that you know beforehand, sir
--that the care, humanity and sympathy of these good
people have no bounds."
"I am sure of that. Heaven repay them for it and
for much more! Varden is out?”
“He returned with your messenger, who arrived al-
most at the moment of his coming home himself. He
was out the whole night-but that of course you know.
He was with you the greater part of it?”
"He was. Without him, I should have lacked my
right hand. He is an older man than I; but nothing
can conquer him."

“He has a right to be. He has a right to be. A bet-
ter creature never lived. He reaps what he has sown
-no more.”
“It is not all men,” said Edward, after a moment's
hesitation, “who have the happiness to do that.”
“ More than you imagine,” returned Mr. Haredale.
" We note the harvest more than the seed time. You
do so in me.”
In truth his pale and haggard face and gloomy bear-
ing had so far influenced the remark that Edward was,
for the moment, at a loss to answer him.
“Tut, tut,” said Mr. Haredale, “'twas not very diffi-
cult to read a thought so natural. But you are mistaken
nevertheless. I have had my share of sorrows-more
than the common lot, perhaps-but I have borne them
ill. I have broken where I should have bent; and have
mused and brooded, when my spirit should have mixed
with all God's great creation. The men who learn
endurance are they who call the whole world brother.
I have turned from the world, and I pay the penalty."
Edward would have interposed, but he went on with-
out giving him time.
“It is too late to evade it now. I sometimes think,
that if I had to live my life once more, I might amend
this fault-not so much, I discover when I search my
mind, for the love of what is right, as for my own sake.
Buteven when I make these better resolutions, I instinct-

ively recoil from the idea of suffering again what I have
undergone; and in this circumstance I find the unwel-
come assurance that I should still be the same man,
though I could cancel the past, and begin anew, with
its experience to guide me.”
“Nay, you make too sure of that,” said Edward.
“You think so,” Mr. Haredale answered, “and I am
glad you do. I know myself better, and therefore dis-
trust myself more. Let us leave this subject for another
-not so far removed from it as it might, at first sight,
seem to be, Sir, you still love my niece, and she is still
attached to you."
“I have that assurance from her own lips,” said
Edward, “and you know-I am sure you know—that
I would not exchange it for any blessing life could give
me.”
“You are frank, honourable, and disinterested,” said
Mr. Haredale; “ you have forced the conviction that
you are so, even on my once-jaundiced mind, and I
believe you. Wait here till I come back.”
He left the room as he spoke; but soon returned with
his niece.
“On that first and only time,” he said, looking from
the one to the other, “when we three stood together
under her father's roof, I told you to quit it, and charged
you never to return."
“It is the only circumstance arising out of our love,"
observed Edward, “that I have forgotten.”
“You own a name," said Mr. Haredale, “I had deep
reason to remember. I was moved and goaded by
recollections of personal wrong and injury, I know, but
even now I cannot charge myself with having, then, or
ever, lost sight of a heartfelt desire for her true happi-
ness; or with having acted-however much I was mis-
taken-with any other impulse than the one pure, single,
earnest wish to be to her, as far as in my inferior nature
lay, the father she had lost.”
"Dear uncle," cried Emma, “I have known no parent
but you. I have loved the memory of others, but I have
loved you all my life. Never was father kinder to his
child than you have been to me, without the interval of
one harsh hour, since I can first remember.”
“You speak too fondly,” he answered, “and yet I
cannot wish you were less partial; for I have a pleasure

in hearing those words, and shall have in calling them
to mind, when we are far asunder, which nothing else
could give me. Bear with me for a moment longer,
Edward, for she and I have been together many years;
and, although I believe that in resigning her to you I
put the seal upon her future happiness, I find it needs
an effort.”
He pressed her tenderly to his bosom, and, after a
minute's pause resumed:
“I have done you wrong, sir, and I ask your forgive-
ness—in no common phrase, or show of sorrow; but with
earnestness and sincerity. In the same spirit, I acknowl-
edge to you both that the time has been when I connived
at treachery and falsehood—which, if I did not perpe-
trate myself, I still permitted—to rend you two asunder."
“You judge yourself too harshly,” said Edward. “Let
these things rest.”
“They rise up in judgment against me when I look
back, and not now for the first time,” he answered. “I
cannot part from you without your full forgiveness; for
busy life and I have little left in common now, and I
have regrets enough to carry into solitude, without addi-
tion to the stock."
“You bear a blessing from us both,” said Emma.
“Never mingle thoughts of me-of me who owe you so
much love and duty–with anything but undying affec-
tion and gratitude for the past, and bright hopes for the
future.”
“The future,” returned her uncle, with a melancholy
smile, “is a bright word for you, and its image should
be wreathed with cheerful hopes. Mine is of another
kind, but it will be one of peace, and free, I trust, from
care or passion. When you quit England I shall leave
it too. There are cloisters abroad; and now that the
two great objects of my life are set at rest, I know no
better home. You droop at that, forgetting I am grow-
ing old, and that my course is nearly run. Well, we
will speak of it again-not once or twice, but many
times; and you shall give me cheerful counsel, Emma.”
“And you will take it?" asked his niece.
“I'll listen to it,” he answered, with a kiss, “and it
will have its weight, be certain. What have I left to
say? You have, of late, been much together. It is
better and more fitting that the circumstances attendant

on the past, which wrought your separation, and sowed
between you suspicion and distrust, should not be en-
tered on by me.”
“Much, much better,” whispered Emma.
“I avow my share in them,” said Mr. Haredale,
“though I held it, at the time, in detestation. Let no
man turn aside, ever so slightly, from the broad path of
honour, on the plausible pretence that he is justified by
the goodness of his end. All good ends can be worked
out by good means. Those that cannot, are bad; and
may be counted so at once, and left alone.”
He looked from her to Edward, and said in a gentler
tone:
“In goods and fortune you are now nearly equal. I
have been her faithful steward, and to that remnant of
a richer property which my brother left her, I desire to
add, in token of my love, a poor pittance, scarcely worth
the mention, for which I have no longer any need. I
am glad you go abroad. Let our ill-fated house remain
the ruin it is. When you return, after a few thriving
years, you will command a better and a more fortunate
one. We are friends!”
Edward took his extended hand, and grasped it
heartily.
“You are neither slow nor cold in your response,” said
Mr. Haredale, doing the like by him, “and when I look
upon you now, and know you, I feel that I would choose
you for her husband. Her father had a generous nature,
and you would have pleased him well. I give her to
you in his name, and with his blessing. If the world
and I part in this act, we part on happier terms than
we have lived for many a day.”
He placed her in his arms, and would have left the
room, but that he was stopped in his passage to the
door by a great noise at a distance, which made them
start and pause.
It was a loud shouting, mingled with boisterous accla-
mations, that rent the very air. It drew nearer and
nearer every moment, and approached so rapidly that,
even while they listened, it burst into a deafening con-
fusion of sounds at the street-corner.
“ This must be stopped-quieted,” said Mr. Haredale,
hastily. “We should have foreseen this, and provided
against it. I will go out to them at once.”

But, before he could reach the door, and before Ed-
ward could catch up his hat and follow him, they were
again arrested by a loud shriek from above stairs: and
the locksmith's wife, bursting in, and fairly running
into Mr. Haredale's arms, cried out:
“She knows it all, dear sir! she knows it all! We
broke it out to her by degrees, and she is quite prepared.”
Having made this communication, and furthermore
thanked Heaven with great fervour and heartiness, the
good lady, according to the custom of matrons on all
occasions of excitement, fainted away directly.
They ran to the window, threw up the sash, and looked
into the crowded street. Among a dense mob of per-
sons, of whom not one was for an instant still, the lock-
smith's ruddy face and burly form could be descried,
beating about as though he was struggling with a rough
sea. Now, he was carried back a score of yards, now
on ward nearly to the door, now back again, now forced
against the opposite houses, now against those adjoin-
ing his own: now carried up a flight of steps, and
greeted by the outstretched hands of half a hundred
men, while the whole tumultuous concourse stretched
their throats and cheered with all their might. Though
he was really in a fair way to be torn to pieces in the
general enthusiasm, the locksmith, nothing discom-
posed, echoed their shouts till he was hoarse as they,
and, in a glow of joy and right good-humour, waved his
hat until the daylight shone between its brim and crown.
But in all the bandyings from hand to hand, and .
strivings to and fro, and sweepings here and there,
which-saving that he looked more jolly and more
radiant after every struggle-troubled his peace of mind
no more than if he had been a straw upon the water's
surface, he never once released his firm grasp of an arm,
drawn tight through his. He sometimes turned to clap
his friend upon the back, or whisper in his ear a word
of staunch encouragement, or cheer him with a smile;
but his great care was to shield him from the pressure,
and force a passage for him to the Golden Key. Passive
and timid, scared, pale, and wondering, and gazing at the
throng as if he were newly risen from the dead, and felt
himself a ghost among the living, Barnaby-not Bar-
naby in the spirit, but in flesh and blood, with pulses,
sinews, nerves, and beating heart, and strong affections

-clung to his stout old friend, and followed where he
led.
And thus, in course of time, they reached the door,
held ready for their entrance by no unwilling hands.
Then slipping in, and shutting out the crowd by main
force, Gabriel stood between Mr. Haredale and Edward
Chester, and Barnaby, rushing up the stairs, fell upon
his knees beside his mother's bed.
“Such is the blessed end, sir,” cried the panting lock-
smith, to Mr. Haredale, “ of the best day's work we ever
did. The rogues! it's been hard fighting to get away
from 'em. I almost thought, once or twice, they'd have
been too much for us with their kindness!"
They had striven, all the previous day, to rescue
Barnaby from his impending fate. Failing in their
attempts, in the first quarter to which they addressed
themselves, they renewed them in another. Failing
there, likewise, they began afresh at midnight; and
made their way, not only to the judge and jury who
had tried him, but to men of influence at court, to the
young Prince of Wales, and even to the antechamber of
the king himself. Successful, at last, in awakening an
interest in his favour, and an inclination to inquire more
dispassionately into his case, they had had an interview
with the minister, in his bed, so late as eight o'clock that
morning. The result of a searching inquiry (in which
they, who had known the poor fellow from his child-
hood, did other good service besides bringing it about)
was, that between eleven and twelve o'clock, a free
pardon to Barnaby Rudge was made out and signed,
and entrusted to a horse-soldier for instant conveyance
to the place of execution. This courier reached the spot
just as the cart appeared in sight; and Barnaby being
carried back to jail, Mr. Haredale, assured that all was
safe, had gone straight from Bloomsbury Square to the
Golden Key, leaving to Gabriel the grateful task of
bringing him home in triumph.
“I needn't say,” observed the locksmith, when he had
shaken hands with all the males in the house, and
hugged all the females, five-and-forty times, at least,
“that, except among ourselves, I didn't want to make
a triumph of it. But directly we got into the street we
were known, and this hubbub began. Of the two,” he
added, as he wiped his crimson face, “and after experi-

ence of both, I think I'd rather be taken out of my house
by a crowd of enemies, than escorted home by a mob of
friends!
It was plain enough, however, that this was mere talk
on Gabriel's part, and that the whole proceeding af-
forded him the keenest delight; for the people continu-
ing to make a great noise without, and to cheer as if
their voices were in the freshest order, and good for a
fortnight, he sent up-stairs for Grip (who had come home
at his master's back, and had acknowledged the favours
of the multitude by drawing blood from every finger
that came within his reach), and with the bird upon his
arm, presented himself at the first-floor window, and
waved his hat again until it dangled by a shred, be-
tween his fingers and thumb. This demonstration hav-
ing been received with appropriate shouts, and silence
being in some degree restored, he thanked them for their
sympathy; and taking the liberty to inform them that
there was a sick person in the house, proposed that
they should give three cheers for King George, three
more for Old England, and three more for nothing par-
ticular, as a closing ceremony. The crowd assenting,
substituted Gabriel Varden for the nothing particular;
and giving him one over, for good measure, dispersed
in high good-humour.
What congratulations were exchanged among the
inmates at the Golden Key, when they were left alone;
what an overflowing of joy and happiness there was
among them; how incapable it was of expression in
Barnaby's own person; and how he went wildly from
one to another, until he became so far tranquilised as
to stretch himself on the ground beside his mother's
couch, and fall into a deep sleep; are matters that need
not be told. And it is well they happened to be of this
class, for they would be very hard to tell, were their
narration ever so indispensable.
Before leaving this bright picture, it may be well to
glance at a dark and very different one which was pre-
sented to only a few eyes that same night.
The scene was a churchyard; the time, midnight; the
persons, Edward Chester, a clergyman, a grave-digger,
and the four bearers of a homely coffin. They stood
about a grave which had been newly dug, and one
of the bearers held up a dim lantern—the only light

there—which shed its feeble ray upon the book of prayer.
He placed it for a moment on the coffin, when he and
his companions were about to lower it down. There
was no inscription on the lid.
The mould fell solemnly upon the last house of this
nameless man; and the rattling dust left a dismal echo
even in the accustomed ears of those who had borne it
to its resting-place. The grave was filled in to the top,
and trodden down. They all left the spot together.
“You never saw him, living?" asked the clergyman,
of Edward.
“Often, years ago; not knowing him for my brother.”
“Never since?”
“Never. Yesterday he steadily refused to see me.
It was urged upon him, many times, at my desire.”
“Still he refused? That was hardened and unnatural.”
“Do you think so?”
“I infer that you do not?”
“You are right. We hear the world wonder, every
day, at monsters of ingratitude. Did it never occur to
you that it often looks for monsters of affection, as
though they were things of course?”
They had reached the gate by this time, and bidding
each other good-night, departed on their separate ways.
CHAPTER XXII.
That afternoon, when he had slept off his fatigue;
had shaved, and washed, and dressed, and freshened
himself from top to toe; when he had dined, comforted
himself with a pipe, an extra Toby, a nap in the great
arm-chair, and a quiet chat with Mrs. Varden on every-
thing that had happened, was happening or about to
happen, within the sphere of their domestic concern;
the locksmith sat himself down at the tea-table in
the little back parlour: the rosiest, cosiest, merriest,
heartiest, best-contented old buck, in Great Britain or
out of it.
There he sat, with his beaming eye on Mrs. V., and
his shining face suffused with gladness, and his capa-
cious waistcoat smiling in every wrinkle, and his jovial
humour peeping from under the table in the very plump-

ness of his legs: a sight to turn the vinegar of misan-
thropy into purest milk of human kindness. There he
sat, watching his wife as she decorated the room with
flowers for the greater honour of Dolly and Joseph
Willet, who had gone out walking, and for whom the
tea-kettle had been singing gaily on the hob full twenty
minutes, chirping as never kettle chirped before; for
whom the best service of real undoubted china, pat-
terned with divers round-faced mandarins holding up
broad umbrellas, was now displayed in all its glory; to
tempt whose appetites a clear, transparent, juicy ham,
garnished with cool green lettuce-leaves and fragrant
cucumber, reposed upon a shady table, covered with a
snow white cloth; for whose delight, preserves and jams,
crisp cakes and other pastry, short to eat, with cunning
twists, and cottage loaves, and rolls of bread both white
and brown, were all set forth in rich profusion; in whose
youth Mrs. V. herself had grown quite young, and stood
there in a gown of red and white: symmetrical in figure,
buxom in bodice, ruddy in cheek and lip, faultless in
ankle, laughing in face and mood, in all respects deli-
cious to behold—there sat the locksmith among all and
every these delights, the sun that shone upon them all:
the centre of the system: the source of light, heat, life,
and frank enjoyment in the bright household world.
And when had Dolly ever been the Dolly of that after-
noon? To see how she came in arm-and-arm with Joe;
and how she made an effort not to blush or seem at all
confused; and how, she made believe she didn't care to
sit on his side of the table; and how she coaxed the lock-
smith in a whisper not to joke; and how her colour came
and went in a little restless flutter of happiness which
made her do everything wrong, and yet so charmingly
wrong that it was better than right!-why, the lock-
smith could have looked on at this (as he mentioned to
Mrs. Varden when they retired for the night) for four-
and-twenty hours at a stretch, and never wished it
done.
The recollections, too, with which they made merry
over that long-protracted tea! The glee with which the
locksmith asked Joe if he remembered that stormy night
at the Maypole when he first asked after Dolly—the
laugh they all had about that night when she was going
out to the party in the sedan-chair-the unmerciful

173
manner in which they rallied Mrs. Varden about putting
those flowers outside that very window—the difficulty
Mrs. Varden found in joining the laugh against herself,
at first, and the extraordinary perception she had of the
joke when she overcame it—the confidential statements
of Joe concerning the precise day and hour when he was
first conscious of being fond of Dolly, and Dolly's blushing
admissions, half volunteered and half extorted, as to
the time from which she dated the discovery that she
“ didn't mind” Joe-here was an exhaustless fund of
mirth and conversation.
Then there was a great deal to be said regarding Mrs.
Varden's doubts, and motherly alarms, and shrewd sus-
picions: and it appeared that from Mrs. Varden's penetra-
tion and extreme sagacity nothing had ever been hid-
den. She had known it all along. She had seen it
from the first. She had always predicted it. She had
been aware of it before the principals. She had said
within herself (for she remembered the exact words)
“that young Willet is certainly looking after our Dolly,
and I must look after him.” Accordingly, she had
looked after him, and had observed many little circum-
stances (all of which she named) so exceedingly minute
that nobody else could make anything out of them even
now; and had, it seemed, from first to last, displayed
the most unbounded tact and most consummate general-
ship.
Of course the night when Joe would ride homeward
by the side of the chaise, and when Mrs. Varden would
insist upon his going back again, was not forgotten-
nor the night when Dolly fainted on his name being
mentioned nor the times upon times when Mrs. Var-
den, ever watchful and prudent, had found her pining
in her own chamber. In short, nothing was forgotten;
and everything by some means or other brought them
back to the conclusion that that was the happiest hour
in all their lives; consequently, that everything must
have occurred for the best, and nothing could be sug-
gested which would have made it better.
While they were in the full glow of such discourse as
this, there came a startling knock at the door, opening
from the street into the workshop, which had been kept
closed all day that the house might be more quiet. Joe,
as in duty bound, would hear of nobody but himself

going to open it; and accordingly left the room for that
purpose.
It would have been odd enough, certainly, if Joe had
forgotten the way to this door; and even if he had, as it
was a pretty large one and stood straight before him,
he could not easily have missed it. But Dolly, perhaps
because she was in the flutter of spirits before mentioned,
or perhaps because she thought he would not be able to
open it with his one arm-she could have had no other
reason-hurried out after him; and they stopped so long
in the passage—no doubt owing to Joe's entreaties that
she would not expose herself to the draught of July air
which must infallibly come rushing in on this same
door being opened-that the knock was repeated, in a
yet more startling manner than before.
“Is anybody going to open that door?” cried the lock-
smith. Or shall I come
Upon that Dolly went running back into the parlour,
all dimples and blushes; and Joe opened it with a mighty
noise, and other superfluous demonstrations of being in
a violent hurry.
“Well,” said the locksmith, when he reappeared:
“what is it? eh, Joe? what are you laughing at?"
“Nothing, sir. It's coming in.”
“Who's coming in? what's coming in?" Mrs. Varden,
as much at a loss as her husband, could only shake her
head in answer to his inquiring look; so the locksmith
wheeled his chair round to command a better view of
the room door, and stared at it with his eyes wide open,
and a mingled expression of curiosity and wonder shin-
ing in his jolly face.
Instead of some person or persons straightway appear-
ing, divers remarkable sounds were heard, first in the
workshop and afterwards in the little dark passage
between it and the parlour, as though some unwieldy
chest or heavy piece of furniture were being brought
in, by an amount of human strength inadequate to the
task. At length after much struggling and bumping,
and bruising of the wall on both sides, the door was
forced open as by a battering-ram; and the locksmith,
steadily regarding what appeared beyond, smote his
thigh, elevated his eyebrows, opened his mouth, and
cried in a loud voice expressive of the utmost conster-
nation:

“Damme, if it an't Miggs come back!”
The young damsel whom he named no sooner heard
these words, than deserting a very small boy and a very
large box by which she was accompanied, and advanc-
ing with such precipitation that her bonnet flew off her
head, burst into the room, clasped her hands (in which
she held a pair of pattens, one in each), raised her eyes
devotedly to the ceiling, and shed a flood of tears.
“The old story!" cried the locksmith, looking at her
in inexpressible desperation. “She was born to be a
damper, this young woman! nothing can prevent it!”
“Ho, màster, ho, mim!” cried Miggs, “can I constrain
my feelings in these here once agin united moments!
Ho, Mr. Warsen, here's blessedness among relations, sir!
Here's forgiveness of injuries, here's amicableness!”
The locksmith looked from his wife to Dolly, and from
Dolly to Joe, and from Joe to Miggs, with his eyebrows
still elevated and his mouth still open. When his eyes
got back to Miggs, they rested on her, fascinated.
"To think,” cried Miggs with hysterical joy, “that
Mr. Joe, and dear Miss Dolly, has raly come together
after all as has been said and done contrairy! To see
them two a sittin' along with him and her, so pleasant
and in all respects so affable and mild; and me not
knowing of it, and not being in the ways to make no
preparations for their teas. Ho, what a cutting thing it
is, and yet what sweet sensations is awoke within me!"
Either in clasping her hands again, or in an ecstacy
of pious joy, Miss Miggs clinked her pattens after the
manner of a pair of cymbals, at this juncture, and then
resumed, in the softest accents:
“And did my missis think-ho, goodness, did she
think-as her own Miggs, which supported her under so
many trials, and understood her natur' when them as
intended well, but acted rough, went so deep into her
feelings—did she think as her own Miggs would ever
leave her? Did she think as Miggs, though she was but
a servant, and knowed that servitudes was no inherit-
ances, would forgit that she was the humble instruments
as always made it comfortable between them two when
they fell out, and always told master of the meekness
and forgiveness of her blessed dispositions! Did she
think as Miggs had no attachments! Did she think that
wages was her only object!"

“Damme, if it an't Miggs come back!"
The young damsel whom he named no sooner heard
these words, than deserting a very small boy and a very
large box by which she was accompanied, and advanc-
ing with such precipitation that her bonnet flew off her
head, burst into the room, clasped her hands (in which
she held a pair of pattens, one in each), raised her eyes
devotedly to the ceiling, and shed a flood of tears..
“The old story!” cried the locksmith, looking at her
in inexpressible desperation. “She was born to be a
damper, this young woman! nothing can prevent it!"
“Ho, máster, ho, mim!” cried Miggs, “can I constrain
my feelings in these here once agin united moments!
Ho, Mr. Warsen, here's blessedness among relations, sir!
Here's forgiveness of injuries, here's amicableness!”
The locksmith looked from his wife to Dolly, and from
Dolly to Joe, and from Joe to Miggs, with his eyebrows
still elevated and his mouth still open. When his eyes
got back to Miggs, they rested on her, fascinated.
“To think,” cried Miggs with hysterical joy, “that
Mr. Joe, and dear Miss Dolly, has raly come together
after all as has been said and done contrairy! To see
them two a sittin' along with him and her, so pleasant
and in all respects so affable and mild; and me not

Either in clasping her hands again, or in an ecstacy

resumed, in the softest accents:

To none of these interrogatories, whereof every one
was more pathetically delivered than the last, did Mrs.
Varden answer one word; but Miggs, not at all abashed
by this circumstance, turned to the small boy in attend-
ance-her eldest nephew.-son of her own married
sister-born in Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin,
and bred in the very shadow of the second bell-handle
on the right hand door-post-and, with a plentiful use
of her pocket handkerchief, addressed herself to him;
requesting that on his return home he would console his
parents for the loss of her, his aunt, by delivering to
them a faithful statement of his having left her in the
bosom of that family, with which, as his aforesaid
parents well knew, her best affections were incorporated;
that he would remind them that nothing less than her
imperious sense of duty, and devoted attachment to her
old master and missis, likewise Miss Dolly and young
Mr. Joe, should ever have induced her to decline that
pressing invitation which they, his parents, had, as he
could testify, given her, to lodge and board with them,
free of all cost and charge, for evermore; lastly, that he
would help her with her box up-stairs, and then repair
straight home, bearing her blessing and her strong in-
junctions to mingle in his prayers a supplication that he
might in course of time grow up a locksmith, or a Mr.
Joe, and have Mrs. Vardens and Miss Dollys for his re-
lations and friends.
Having brought this admonition to an end-upon
which, to say the truth, the young gentleman for whose
benefit it was designed bestowed little or no heed, hav-
ing to all appearance his faculties absorbed in the con-
templation of the sweetmeats-Miss Miggs signified
to the company in general that they were not to be
uneasy, for she would soon return; and, with her
nephew's aid, prepared to bear her wardrobe. up the
staircase.
“My dear,” said the locksmith to his wife. "Do you
desire this?”
" I desire it!” she answered. “I am astonished-I am
amazed at her audacity. Let her leave the house this
moment."
Miggs hearing this, let her end of the box fall heavily
to the floor, gave a very loud sniff, crossed her arms,
screwed down the corners of her mouth, and cried, in

an ascending scale, “Ho, good gracious!" three distinct
times.
“You hear what your mistress says, my love," re-
marked the locksmith. “You had better go, I think.
Stay; take this with you, for the sake of old service.”
Miss Miggs clutched the bank-note he took from his
pocket-book and held out to her; deposited it in a small,
red leather purse; put the purse in her pocket (display-
ing as she did so a considerable portion of some under
garment made of flannel, and more black cotton stock-
ing than is commonly seen in public); and, tossing her
head, as she looked at Mrs. Varden, repeated:
“Ho, good gracious!"
“I think you said that once before, my dear,” observed
the locksmith.
“Times is changed, is they, mim!” cried Miggs, brid-
ling; “you can spare me now, can you? You can keep
'em down without me? You're not in wants of any one
to scold, or throw the blame upon no longer, an't you,
mim? I'm glad to find you've grown so independent.
I wish you joy, I'm sure!"
With that she dropped a curtsey, and keeping her
head erect, her ear towards Mrs. Varden, and her eye
on the rest of the company, as she alluded to them in
her remarks, proceeded:
“I'm quite delighted, I'm sure, to find sich independ-
ency, feeling sorry, though, at the same time, mim, that
you should have been forced into submissions when you
couldn't help yourself-he, he, he! It must be great vex-
ations, 'specially considering how ill you always spoke of
Mr. Joe-to have him for a son-in-law at last; and I
wonder Miss Dolly can put up with him either, after
being off and on for so many years with a coach-maker.
But I have heerd say, that the coach-maker thought
twice about it-he, he, he!—and that he told a young man
as was a friend of his, that he hoped he knowed better
than to be drawed into that; though she and all the
family did pull uncommon strong!”
Here she paused for a reply, and receiving none, went
on as before.
“I have heerd say, mim, that the illness of some
ladies was all pretensions, and that they could faint
away, stone dead, whenever they had the inclinations so
to do, Of course I never see sich cases with my own

eyes-ho, no! He, he, he! Nor master neither--ho, no!
He, he, he! I have heerd the neighbours make remark
as some one as they was acquainted with was a poor, good-
natur'd, mean-spirited creetur, as went out fishing for a
wife one day, and caught a Tartar. Of course I never
to my knowledge see the poor person himself. Nor did
you neither, mim-ho, no. I wonder who it can be-
don't you, mim? No doubt you do, mim. Ho, yes. He,
he, he!"
Again Miggs paused for a reply; and, none being
offered, was so oppressed with teeming spite and spleen
that she seemed like to burst.
“I'm glad Miss Dolly can laugh,” cried Miggs with a
feeble titter; “I like to see folks a laughing—so do you,
mim, don't you? You was always glad to see people
in spirits, wasn't you, mim? And you always did your
best to keep 'em cheerful, didn't you, mim? Though
there an't such a great deal to laugh at now, either, is
there, mim? It an't so much of a catch, after looking
out so sharp ever since she was a little chit, and costing
such a deal in dress and show, to get a poor common
soldier, with one arm, is it, mim? He, he! I wouldn't
have a husband with one arm, anyways. I would have
two arms. I would have two arms if it was me, though
instead of hands they'd only got hooks at the end, like
our dustman!”
Miss Miggs was about to add, and had, indeed, begun
to add, that, taking them in the abstract, dustmen were
far more eligible matches than soldiers, though, to be
sure, when people were past choosing they must take
the best they could get, and think themselves well off
too; but her vexation and chagrin being of that inter-
nally bitter sort which finds no relief in words, and is
aggravated to madness by want of contradiction, she
could hold out no longer, and burst into a storm of sobs
and tears.
In this extremity she fell on the unlucky nephew,
tooth and nail, and plucking a handful of hair from his
head, demanded to know how long she was to stand
there to be insulted, and whether or no he meant to help
her to carry out the box again, and if he took a pleasure
in hearing his family reviled: with other inquiries of
that nature; at which disgrace and provocation, the
small boy, who had been all this time gradually lashed

into rebellion by the sight of unattainable pastry,
walked off indignant, leaving his aunt and the box to
follow at their leisure. Somehow or other, by dint of
pushing and pulling, they did attain the street at last;
where Miss Miggs, all blowzed with the exertion of get-
ting there, and with her sobs and tears, sat down upon
her property to rest and grieve, until she could ensnare
some other youth to help her home.
“It's a thing to laugh at, Martha, not to care for,"
whispered the locksmith, as he followed his wife to the
window, and good-humouredly dried her eyes. “What
does it matter? You had seen your fault before. Come!
Bring up Toby again, my dear; Dolly shall sing us a
song; and we'll be all the merrier for this interrup-
tion!
CHAPTER XXIII.
ANOTHER month had passed and the end of August had
nearly come, when Mr. Haredale stood alone in the mail-
coach office at Bristol. Although but a few weeks had
intervened since his conversation with Edward Chester
and his niece in the locksmith's house, and he had made
no change, in the meantime, in his accustomed style of
dress, his appearance was greatly altered. He looked
much older and more care-worn. Agitation and anxiety
of mind scatter wrinkles and grey hairs with no unspar-
ing hand; but deeper traces follow on the silent uproot-
ing of old habits, and severing of dear, familiar ties.
The affections may not be so easily wounded as the pas-
sions, but their hurts are deeper and more lasting. He
was now a solitary man, and the heart within him was
dreary and lonesome.
He was not the less alone for having spent so many
years in seclusion and retirement. This was no better
preparation than a round of social cheerfulness: perhaps
it even increased the keenness of his sensibility. He
had been so dependent upon her for companionship and
love; she had come to be so much a part and parcel of
his existence; they had had so many cares and thoughts
in common, which no one else had shared; that losing
her was beginning life anew, and being required to sum-

mon up the hope and elasticity of youth, amid the
doubts, distrusts and weakened energies of age.
The effort he had made to part from her with seeming
cheerfulness and hope—and they had parted only yes-
terday-left him the more depressed. With these feel-
ings, he was about to revisit London for the last time,
and look once more upon the walls of their old home be-
fore turning his back upon it forever.
The journey was a very different one, in those days,
from what the present generation find it; but it came
to an end, as the longest journey will, and he stood
again in the streets of the metropolis. He lay at the
inn where the coach stopped, and resolved, before he
went to bed, that he would make his arrival known to
no one; would spend but another night in London; and
would spare himself the pang of parting even with the
honest locksmith.
Such conditions of the mind as that to which he was
a prey when he lay down to rest are favourable to the
growth of disordered fancies, and uneasy visions. He
knew this, even in the horror with which he started
from his first sleep, and threw up the window to dispel
it by the presence of some object, beyond the room,
which had not been, as it were, the witness of his dream.
But it was not a new terror of the night; it had been
present to him before, in many shapes; it had haunted
him in bygone times, and visited his pillow again and
again. If it had been but an ugly object, a childish
spectre, haunting his sleep, its return, in its old form,
might have awakened a momentary sensation of fear,
which, almost in the act of waking, would have passed
away. This disquiet, however, lingered about him, and
would yield to nothing. When he closed his eyes again,
he felt it hovering near; as he slowly sunk into a slumber,
he was conscious of its gathering strength and purpose,
and gradually assuming its recent shape; when he
sprang from his bed, the same phantom vanished from
his heated brain, and left him filled with a dread, against
which reason and waking thought were powerless.
The sun was up before he could shake it off. He rose
late, but not refreshed, and remained within doors all
that day. He had a fancy for paying his last visit to
the old spot in the evening, for he had been accustomed
to walk there at that season, and desired to see it under

the aspect that was most familiar to him. At such an
hour as would afford him time to reach it a little before
sunset, he left the inn, and turned into the busy street.
He had not gone far, and was thoughtfully making
his way among the noisy crowd, when he felt a hand
upon his shoulder, and turning, recognised one of the
waiters from the inn, who begged his pardon, but he had
left his sword behind him.
“Why have you brought it to me?” he asked, stretch-
ing out his hand, and yet not taking it from the man,
but looking at him in a disturbed and agitated
manner.
The man was sorry to have disobliged him, and would
carry it back again. The gentleman had said that he
was going a little way into the country, and that he
might not return until late. The roads were not very
safe for single travellers after dark; and since the riots
gentlemen had been more careful than ever not to trust
themselves unarmed in lonely places. “We thought
you were a stranger, sir,” he added, “and that you
might believe our roads to be better than they are; but
perhaps you know them well and carry fire-arms—”
He took the sword, and putting it up at his side,
thanked the man, and resumed his walk.
It was long remembered that he did this in a manner
so strange, and with such a trembling hand, that the
messenger stood looking after his retreating figure,
doubtful whether he ought not to follow, and watch
him. It was long remembered that he had been heard
pacing his bed-room in the dead of the night; that the
attendants had mentioned to each other in the morning,
how fevered and how pale he looked; and that when
this man went back to the inn, he told a fellow-servant
that what he had observed in this short interview lay
very heavy on his mind, and that he feared the gentle-
man intended to destroy himself, and would never come
back alive.
With a half consciousness that his manner had
attracted the man's attention (remembering the expres-
sion of his face when they parted), Mr. Haredale
quickened his steps; and arriving at a stand of coaches,
bargained with the driver of the best to carry him so
far on his road as.to point where the footway struck
across the fields, and to await his return at a house of

entertainment which was within a stone's throw of that
place. Arriving there in due course, he alighted and
pursued his way on foot.
He passed so near the Maypole that he could see its
smoke rising from among the trees, while a flock of
pigeons-some of its old inhabitants, doubtless-sailed
gaily home to roost, between him and the unclouded
sky. “The old house will brighten up now,” he said, as
he looked towards it, “and there will be a merry fire-
side beneath its ivied roof. It is some comfort to know
that everything will not be blighted hereabouts. I shall
be glad to have one picture of life and cheerfulness to
turn to, in my mind!”
He résumed his walk and bent his steps towards the
Warren. It was a clear, calm, silent evening, with
hardly a breath of wind to stir the leaves or any sound
to break the stillness of the time, but drowsy sheep-
bells tinkling in the distance, and, at intervals, the far-
off lowing of cattle, or bark of village dogs. The sky
was radiant with the softened glory of sunset; and on
the earth, and in the air, a deep repose prevailed. At
such an hour he arrived at the deserted mansion which
had been his home so long, and looked for the last time
upon its blackened walls.
The ashes of the commonest fire are melancholy
things, for in them there is an image of death and ruin,
of something that has been bright, and is but dull, cold,
dreary dust—with which our nature forces us to sympa-
thise. How much more sad the crumbled embers of a
home; the casting down of that great altar, where the
worst among us sometimes perform the worship of the
heart, and where the best have offered up such sacrifices,
and done such deeds of heroism, as, chronicled, would
put the proudest temples of old Time, with all their
vaunting annals, to the blush.
He roused himself from a long train of meditation,
and walked slowly round the house. It was by this
time almost dark.
He had nearly made the circuit of the building, when
he uttered a half-suppressed exclamation, started, and
stood still. Reclining in an easy attitude, with his back
against a tree, and contemplating the ruin with an ex-
pression of pleasurera pleasure so keen that it over-
came his habitual indolence and command of feature,

and displayed itself utterly free from all restraint or re-
serve-before him, on his own ground, and triumphing
then, as he had triumphed in every misfortune and dis.
appointment of his life, stood the man whose presence,
of all mankind, in any place, and least of all in that, he
could the least endure.
Although his blood so rose against this man, and his
wrath so stirred within him that he could have struck
him dead, he put such fierce constraint upon himself
that he passed him without a word or look. Yes, and
he would have gone on, and not turned, though to resist
the devil who poured such hot temptation in his brain
required an effort scarcely to be achieved, if this man
had not himself summoned him to stop; and that, with
an assumed compassion in his voice which drove him
well-nigh mad, and in an instant routed all the self-com-
mand it had been anguish-acute, poignant anguish—to
sustain.
All consideration, reflection, mercy, forbearance;
everything by which a goaded man can curb his rage
and passion, fled from him as he turned back. And yet
he said, slowly and quite calmly-far more calmly than
he had ever spoken to him before:
“Why have you called to me?”
“ To remark,” said Sir John Chester with his wonted
composure, “what an odd chance it is that we should
meet here!"
“It is a strange chance.”
“Strange? The most remarkable and singular thing
in the world. I never ride in the evening; I have not
done so for years. The whim seized me quite unac-
countably, in the middle of last night. How very pic-
turesque this is!" He pointed, as he spoke, to the dis-
mantled house, and raised his glass to his eye.
“ You praise your own work very freely."
Sir John let fall his glass, inclined his face towards
him with an air of the most courteous inquiry, and
slightly shook his head as though he were remarking to
himself, “I fear this animal is going mad!"
“I say you praise your own work very freely,” re-
peated Mr. Haredale.
“Work!" echoed Sir John, looking smilingly round.
“ Mine! I beg your pardon, I really beg your pardon-"
“Why, you see,” said Mr. Haredale, “those walls.

You see those tottering gables. You see on every side
where fire and smoke have raged. You see the destruc-
tion that has been wanton here. Do you not?”
“My good friend,” returned the knight, gently check-
ing his impatience with his hand, “of course I do. I
see everything you speak of, when you stand aside, and
do not interpose yourself between the view and me. I
am very sorry for you. If I had not had the pleasure to
meet you here, I think I should have written to tell you
so. But you don't bear it as well as I had expected-
excuse me-no, you don't indeed.”
He pulled out his snuff-box, and addressing him with
the superior air of a man who, by reason of his higher
nature, has a right to read a moral lesson to another,
continued:
“For you are a philosopher, you know—one of that
stern and rigid school who are far above the weaknesses
of mankind in general. You are removed, a long way,
from the frailties of the crowd. You contemplate them
from a height, and rail at them with a most impressive
bitterness. I have heard you.”
-“And shall again,” said Mr. Haredale.
“Thank you,” returned the other. “Shall we walk as
we talk? The damp falls rather heavily. Well-as you
please. But I grieve to say that I can spare you only a
very few moments.”
“I would,” said Mr. Haredale, “you had spared me
none. I would, with all my soul, you had been in Para-
dise (if such a monstrous lie could be enacted), rather
than here to-night.”
“Nay,” returned the other—"really-you do yourself
injustice. You are a rough companion, but I would not
go so far to avoid you.”
“Listen to me,” said Mr. Haredale. “Listen to me.”
6. While you rail?" inquired Sir John.
“While I deliver your infamy. You urged and stim-
ulated to do your work a fit agent, but one who in his
nature—in the very essence of his being—is a traitor,
and who has been false to you (despite the sympathy
you two should have together) as he has been to all
others. With hints, and looks, and crafty words, which
told again are nothing, you set on Gashford to this work
-this work before us now. With these same hints, and
looks, and crafty words, which told again are nothing,

inefficiently thake notices led to him,
you urged him on to gratify the deadly hate he owes me
-I have earned it, I thank Heaven-by the abduction
and dishonour of my niece. You did. I see denial in
your looks,” he cried, abruptly pointing in his face, and
stepping back, “and denial is a lie!"
He had his hand upon his sword; but the knight, with
a contemptuous smile, replied to him as coldly as before.
“You will take notice, sir--if you can discriminate
sufficiently—that I have taken the trouble to deny noth-
ing. Your discernment is hardly fine enough for the
perusal of faces not of a kind as coarse as your speech;
nor has it ever been, that I remember; or, in one face
that I could name, you would have read indifference,
not to say disgust, somewhat sooner than you did. I
speak of a long time ago-but you understand me.”
“Disguise it as you will, you mean denial. Denial,
explicit or reserved, expressed or left to be inferred, is
still a lie. You say you don't deny. Do you admit?”
“You yourself," returned Sir John, suffering the cur-
rent of his speech to flow as smoothly as if it had been
stemmed by no word of interruption, “ publicly pro-
claimed the character of the gentleman in question (I
think it was in Westminster Hall) in terms which relieve
me from the necessity of making any further allusion
to him. You may have been warranted; you may not
have been; I can't say. Assuming the gentleman to be
what you described, and to have made to you or any
other person any statements that may have happened to
suggest themselves to him, for the sake of his own
security, or for the sake of money, or for his own amuse-
ment, or for any other consideration-I have nothing to
say of him, except that his extremely degrading situa-
tion appears to me to be shared with his employers.
You are so very plain yourself, that you will excuse a
little freedom in me, I am sure.”
“Attend to me again, Sir John-but once," cried Mr.
Haredale; “in your every look, and word, and gesture,
you tell me this was not your act. I tell you that it was,
and that you tampered with the man I speak of, and
with your wretched son (whom God forgive!) to do this
deed. You talk of degradation and character. You told
me once that you had purchased the absence of the poor
idiot and his mother, when (as I have discovered since,
and then suspected) you had gone to tempt them, and

had found them flown. To you I traced the insinuation
that I alone reaped any harvest from my brother's death,
and all the foul attacks and whispered calumnies that
followed in its train. In every action of my life, from
that first hope which you converted into grief and deso-
lation, you have stood, like an adverse fate, between me
and peace. In all, you have ever been the same cold-
blooded, hollow, false, unworthy villain. For the
second time, and for the last, I cast these charges in
your teeth, and spurn you from me as I would a faith-
less dog!”
With that, he raised his arm, and struck him on the
breast so that he staggered. Sir John, the instant he
recovered, drew his sword, threw away the scabbard and
his hat, and running on his adversary, made a desper-
ate lunge at his heart, which, but that his guard was
quick and true, would have stretched him dead upon the
grass.
In the act of striking him, the torrent of his oppo-
nent's rage had reached a stop. He parried his rapid
thrusts, without returning them, and called to him, with
a frantic kind of terror in his face, to keep back.
“Not to-night! not to-night!” he cried. “In God's
name, not to-night!"
Seeing that he lowered his weapon, and that he would
not thrust in turn, Sir John lowered his.
“Not to-night!" his adversary cried. “Be warned in
time!
“You told me—it must have been in a sort of inspira-
tion,” said Sir John, quite deliberately, though now he
dropped his mask, and showed his hatred in his face,
" that this was the last time. Be assured it is! Did
you believe our last meeting was forgotten? Did you
believe that your every word and look was not to be ac-
counted for, and was not well remembered? Do you
believe that I have waited your time, or you mine?
What kind of a man is he who entered, with all his
sickening cant of honesty and truth, into a bond with
me to prevent a marriage he affected to dislike, and
when I had redeemed my part to the spirit and the letter,
skulked from his, and brought the match about in his
own time, to rid himself of a burden he had grown tired
of, and cast a spurious lustre on his house?”
“I have acted,” cried Mr. Haredale, “with honour

and in good faith. I do so now. Do not force me to re-
new this duel to-night!"
“You said my wretched’son, I think?” said Sir
John, with a smile. “Poor fool! The dupe of such a
shallow knave-trapped into marriage by such an uncle
and by such a niece-he well deserves your pity. But
he is no longer a son of mine: you are welcome to the
prize your craft has made, sir.”
“Once more,” cried his opponent, wildly stamping on
the ground, “although you tear me from my better
angel, I implore you not to come within the reach of my
sword to-night. Oh! why were you here at all! Why
have we met! To-morrow would have cast us far apart
forever!"
“That being the case,” returned Sir John, without the
least emotion, “it is very fortunate we have met to-
night. Haredale, I have always despised you, as you
know, but I have given you credit for a species of brute
courage. For the honour of my judgment, which I had
thought a good one, I am sorry to find you a coward.”
Not another word was spoken on either side. They
crossed swords, though it was now quite dusk, and at-
tacked each other fiercely. They were well-matched,
and each was thoroughly skilled in the management of
his weapon.
After a few seconds they grew hotter and more furi-
ous, and pressing on each other inflicted and received
several slight wounds. It was directly after receiving
one of these in his arm, that Mr. Haredale, making a
keener thrust as he felt the warm blood spirting out,
plunged his sword through his opponent's body to the
hilt.
Their eyes met, and were on each other as he drew it
out. He put his arm about the dying man, who repulsed
him feebly and dropped upon the turf. Raising himself
upon his hands, he gazed upon him for an instant, with
scorn and hatred in his look; but, seeming to remember,
even then, that this expression would distort his fea-
tures after death, he tried to smile, and, faintly moving
his right hand, as if to hide his bloody linen in his vest,
fell back dead-the phantom of last night,

CHAPTER THE LAST.
A PARTING glance at such of the actors in this little
history as it has not, in the course of its events, dis-
missed, will bring it to an end.
Mr. Haredale fled that night. Before pursuit could
be begun, indeed before Sir John was traced or missed,
he had left the kingdom. Repairing straight to a reli-
gious establishment, known throughout Europe for the
rigour and severity of its discipline, and for the merci-
less penitence it exacted from those who sought its
shelter as a refuge from the world, he took the vows
which thenceforth shut him out from nature and his
kind, and after a few remorseful years was buried in its
gloomy cloisters.
Two days elapsed before the body of Sir John was
found. As soon as it was recognised and carried home,
the faithful valet, true to his master's creed, eloped with
all the cash and movables he could lay his hands on,
and started as a finished gentleman upon his own ac-
count. In this career he met with great success, and
would certainly have married an heiress in the end, but
for an unlucky check which led to his premature decease.
He sank under a contagious disorder, very prevalent at
that time, and vulgarly termed the jail fever.
Lord George Gordon, remaining in his prison in the
Tower until Monday, the fifth of February, in the fol-
lowing year, was on that day solemnly tried at West-
minster for High Treason. Of this crime he was, after
a patient investigation, declared Not Guilty; upon the
ground that there was no proof of his having called the
multitude together with any traitorous or unlawful in-
tentions. Yet so many people were there, still, to whom
those riots taught no lesson of reproof or moderation,
that a public subscription was set on foot in Scotland to
defray the cost of his defence.
For seven years afterwards he remained, at the strong
intercession of his friends, comparatively quiet; saving
that he, every now and then, took occasion to display
his zeal for the Protestant faith in some extravagant

189
proceeding which was the delight of his enemies; and
saving, besides, that he was formally excommunicated
by the Archbishop of Canterbury, for refusing to ap-
pear as a witness in the Ecclesiastical Court when cited
for that purpose. In the year 1788 he was stimulated
by some new insanity to write and publish an injurious
pamphlet, reflecting on the Queen of France in very
violent terms. Being indicted for the libel, and (after
various strange demonstrations in court) found guilty,
he fled into Holland in place of appearing to receive
sentence: from whence, as the quiet burgomasters of
Amsterdam had no relish for his company, he was sent
home again with all speed. Arriving in the month of
July at Harwich, and going thence to Birmingham, he
made, in the latter place, in August, a public profession
of the Jewish religion; and figured there as a Jew until
he was arrested, and brought back to London to receive
the sentence he had evaded. By virtue of this sentence
he was, in the month of December, cast into Newgate
for five years and ten months, and required besides to
pay a large fine, and to furnish heavy securities for his
future good behaviour.
After addressing, in the midsummer of the following
year, an appeal to the commiseration of the National
Assembly of France, which the English minister refused
to sanction, he composed himself to undergo his full
term of punishment; and suffering his beard to grow
nearly to his waist, and conforming in all respects to
the ceremonies of his new religion, he applied himself
to the study of history, and occasionally to the art of
painting, in which, in his younger days, he had shown
some skill. Deserted by his former friends, and treated
in all respects like the worst criminal in the jail, he
lingered on, quite cheerful and resigned, until the 1st of
November, 1793, when he died in his cell, being then
only three-and-forty years of age.
Many men with fewer sympathies for the distressed
and needy, with less abilities and harder hearts, have
made a shining figure and left a brilliant fame. He had
his mourners. The prisoners bemoaned his loss, and
missed him; for though his means were not large his
charity was great, and in bestowing alms among them
he considered the necessities of all alike, and knew no
distinction of sect or creed. There are wise men in the

highways of the world who may learn something, even
from this poor crazy lord who died in Newgate.
To the last he was truly served by bluff John Grueby.
John was at his side before he had been four-and-twenty
hours in the Tower, and never left him until he died.
He had one other constant attendant, in the person of a
beautiful Jewish girl, who attached herself to him from
feelings half religious, half romantic, but whose virtu-
ous and disinterested character appears to have been
beyond the censure even of the most censorious.
Gashford deserted him, of course. He subsisted for a
time upon his traffic in his master's secrets; and, this
trade failing when the stock was quite exhausted, pro-
cured an appointment in the honourable corps of spies
and eaves-droppers employed by the government. As
one of these wretched underlings he did his drudgery
sometimes abroad, sometimes at home, and long endured
the various miseries of such a station. Ten or a dozen
years ago--not more-a meagre, wan old man, diseased
and miserably poor, was found dead in his bed at an
obscure inn in the Borough, where he was quite un-
known. He had taken poison. There was no clue to
his name, but it was discovered, from certain entries
in a pocket-book he carried, that he had been sec-
retary to Lord George Gordon in the time of the famous
riots.
Many months after the re-establishment of peace and
order, and even when it had ceased to be the town talk
that every military officer, kept at free quarters by the
city during the late alarms, had cost for his board and
lodging four pounds four per day, and every private
soldier two and twopence halfpenny; many months after
even this engrossing topic was forgotten, and the United
Bull-Dogs were to a man all killed, imprisoned or trans-
ported, Mr. Simon Tappertit, being removed from a hos-
pital to prison, and thence to his place of trial, was
discharged by proclamation, on two wooden legs. Shorn
of his graceful limbs, and brought down from his high
estate to circumstances of utter destitution, and the
deepest misery, he made shift to stump back to his old
master, and beg for some relief. By the locksmith's
advice and aid, he was established in business as a shoe-
black, and opened shop under an archway near the
Horse Guards. This being a central quarter, he quickly

made a very large connection; and on levee days was
sometimes known to have as many as twenty half-pay
officers waiting their turn for polishing. Indeed, his
trade increased to that extent that in course of time he
entertained no less than two apprentices, besides taking
for his wife the widow of an eminent bone and rag
collector, formerly of Millbank. With this lady (who
assisted in the business) he lived in great domestic hap-
piness, only chequered by those little storms which serve
to clear the atmosphere of wedlock, and brighten its
horizon. In some of these gusts of bad weather, Mr.
Tappertit would, in the assertion of his prerogative, so
far forgot himself as to correct his lady with a brush,
or boot, or shoe; while she (but only in extreme cases)
would retaliate by taking off his legs and leaving him
exposed to the derision of those urchins who delight in
mischief.
Miss Miggs, baffled in all her schemes, matrimonial
and otherwise, and cast upon a thankless, undeserving
world, turned very sharp and sour; and did at length
become so acid, and did so pinch and slap and tweak the
hair and noses of the youth of Golden Lion Court, that
she was by one consent expelled that sanctuary, and
desired to bless some other spot of earth in preference.
It chanced at that moment that the justices of the peace
for Middlesex proclaimed by public placard that they
stood in need of a female turnkey for the County Bride-
well, and appointed a day and hour for the inspection
of candidates. Miss Miggs, attending at the time ap-
pointed, was instantly chosen and selected from one
hundred and twenty-four competitors, and at once pro-
moted to the office; which she held until her decease,
more than thirty years afterwards, remaining single all
that time. It was observed of this lady that while she
was inflexible and grim to all her female flock, she was
particularly so to those who could establish any claim
to beauty: and it was often remarked, as a proof of her
indomitable virtue and severe chastity, that to such as
had been frail she showed no mercy, always falling
upon them on the slightest occasion, or on no occasion
at all, with the fullest measure of her wrath. Among
other useful inventions which she practised upon this
class of offenders and bequeathed to posterity, was the
art of inflicting an exquisitely vicious poke or dig with

the wards of a key in the small of the back, near the
spine. She likewise originated a mode of treading by
accident (in pattens) on such as had small feet; also very
remarkable for its ingenuity, and previously quite un-
known.
It was not very long, you may be sure, before Joe
Willet and Dolly Varden were made husband and wife,
and with a handsome sum in bank (for the locksmith
could afford to give his daughter a good dowry), re-
opened the Maypole. It was not very long, you may be
sure, before a red-faced little boy was seen staggering
about the Maypole passage, and kicking up his heels on
the green before the door. It was not very long, count-
ing by years, before there was a red-faced little girl,
another red-faced little boy, and a whole troup of girls
and boys; so that, go to Chigwell when you would,
there would surely be seen, either in the village street,
or on the green, or frolicking in the farm-yard-for it
was a farm now as well as a tavern-more small Joes
and small Dollys than could be easily counted. It was
not a very long time before these appearances ensued;
but it was a very long time before Joe looked five years
older, or Dolly either, or the locksmith either, or his wife
either; for cheerfulness and content are great beautifiers,
and are famous preservers of youthful looks, depend
upon it.
It was a long time, too, before there was such a
country inn as the Maypole, in all England; indeed, it is
a great question whether there has ever been such an-
other to this hour, or ever will be. It was a long time,
too--for Never, as the proverb says, is a long day-be-
fore they forgot to have an interest in wounded soldiers
at the Maypole; or before Joe omitted to refresh them,
for the sake of his old campaign; or before the serjeant
left off looking in there, now and then; or before they
fatigued themselves, or each other, by talking on these
occasions of battles and sieges, and hard weather and
hard service, and a thousand things belonging to a
soldier's life. As to the great silver snuff-box which the
King sent Joe with his own hand, because of his con-
duct in the riots, what guest ever went to the Maypole
without putting finger and thumb into that box, and
taking a great pinch, though he had never taken a
pinch of snuff before, and almost sneezed himself into

convulsions even then? As to the purple-faced vintner,
where is the man who lived in those times and never
saw him at the Maypole; to all appearance as much at
home in the best room as if he lived there? And as to
the feastings and christenings and revellings at Christ-
mas, and celebrations of birth-days, wedding-days, and
all manner of days, both at the Maypole and the
Golden Key-if they are not notorious, what facts are?
Mr. Willet the elder, having been by some extraordi-
nary means possessed with the idea that Joe wanted to
to be married, and that it would be well for him, his
father, to retire into private life, and enable him to live
in comfort, took up his abode in a small cottage at
Chigwell; where they widened and enlarged the fire-
place for him, hung up the boiler, and furthermore
planted in the little garden outside the front-door a fic-
titious Maypole: so that he was quite at home directly.
To this his new habitation, Tom Cobb, Phil Parkes, and
Solomon Daisy went regularly every night: and in the
chimney-corner they all four quaffed, and smoked, and
prosed, and dozed, as they had done of old. It being
accidentally discovered after a short time that Mr. Wil-
let still appeared to consider himself a landlord by pro-
fession, Joe provided him with a slate, upon which the
old man regularly scored up vast accounts for meat,
drink and tobacco. As he grew older this passion in-
creased upon him; and it became his delight to chalk
against the name of each of his cronies a sum of enor-
mous magnitude, and impossible to be paid: and such
was his secret joy in these entries, that he would be
perpetually seen going behind the door to look at them,
and coming forth again, suffused with the liveliest satis-
faction.
He never recovered the surprise the Rioters had given
him, and remained in the same mental condition down
to the last moment of his life. It was like to have been
brought to a speedy termination by the first sight of his
first grandchild, which appeared to fill him with the belief
that some alarming miracle had happened to Joe. Being
promptly blooded, however, by a skilful surgeon, he
rallied, and although the doctors all agreed, on his being
attacked with symptoms of apoplexy six months after-
wards, that he ought to die, and took it very ill that he
did not, he remained alive possibly on account of his

Ir. Wat he was hearing the nas sudd
constitutional slowness—for nearly seven years more,
when he was one morning found speechless in his bed.
He lay in this state, free from all tokens of uneasiness,
for a whole week, when he was suddenly restored to
consciousness by hearing the nurse whisper in his son's
ear that he was going. “I'm a going, Joseph,” said
Mr. Willet, turning round upon the instant, "to the
Salwanners”—and immediately gave up the ghost.
He left a large sum of money behind him; even more
than he was supposed to have been worth, although the
neighbours, according to the custom of mankind in cal-
culating the wealth that other people ought to have
saved, had estimated his property in good round num-
bers. Joe inherited the whole; so that he became a man
of great consequence in those parts, and was perfectly
independent.
Some time elapsed before Barnaby got the better of
the shock he had sustained, or regained his old health
and gaiety. But he recovered by degrees: and although
he could never separate his condemnation and escape
from the idea of a terrific dream, he became, in other
respects, more rational. Dating from the time of his
recovery, he had a better memory and greater steadi-
ness of purpose; but a dark cloud overhung his whole
previous existence, and never cleared away.
He was not the less happy for this; for his love of
freedom and interest in all that moved or grew, or had
its being in the elements, remained to him unimpaired.
He lived with his mother on the Maypole farm, tending
the poultry and the cattle, working in a garden of his
own, and helping everywhere. He was known to every
bird and beast about the place, and had a name for
every one. Never was there a lighter-hearted husband-
man, a creature more popular with young and old, a
blither or more happy soul than Barnaby; and though
he was free to ramble where he would, he never quitted
Her, but was for evermore her stay and comfort.
It was remarkable that, although he had that dim
sense of the past, he sought out Hugh's dog, and took
him under his care; and that he never could be tempted
into London. When the riots were many years old, and
Edward and his wife came back to England with a fam-
ily almost as numerous as Dolly's, and one day appeared
at the Maypole porch, he knew them instantly, and

wept and leaped for joy. But neither to visit them, nor
on any other pretence, no matter how full of promise
and enjoyment, could he be persuaded to set foot in the
streets; nor did he ever conquer his repugnance or look
upon the town again.
Grip soon recovered his looks, and became as glossy
and sleek as ever. But he was profoundly silent.
Whether he had forgotten the art of Polite Conversation
in Newgate, or had made a vow in those troubled times
to forego, for a period, the display of his accomplish-
ments, is matter of uncertainty; but certain it is that
for a whole year he never indulged in any other sound
than a grave, decorous croak. At the expiration of that
term, the morning being very bright and sunny, he was
heard to address himself to the horses in the stable, upon
the subject of the Kettle, so often mentioned in these
pages; and before the witness who overheard him could
run into the house with the intelligence, and add to it
upon his solemn affirmation the statement that he had
heard him laugh, the bird himself advanced with fan-
tastic steps to the very door of the bar, and there cried,
“I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil!” with extraordi-
nary rapture.
From that period (although he seemed to be much af-
fected by the death of Mr. Willet senior), he constantly
practised and improved himself in the vulgar tongue;
and as he was a mere infant for a raven when Barnaby
was grey, he has very probably gone on talking to the
present time.

CHAPTER I.
THE ONE THING NEEDFUL,
“Now, what I want is Facts. Teach these boys and
girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life.
Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You
can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon
Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.
This is the principle on which I bring up my own
children, and this is the principle on which I bring up
these children. Stick to Facts, sir!"
The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a
school-room, and the speaker's square forefinger em-
phasised his observations by underscoring every sen-
tence with a line on the schoolmaster's sleeve. The
emphasis was helped by the speaker's square wall of a
forehead, which had his eyebrows for its base, while his
eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves,
overshadowed by the wall. The emphasis was helped
by the speaker's mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard
set. The emphasis was helped by the speaker's voice,
which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial. The emphasis
was helped by the speaker's hair, which bristled on the
skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the
wind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs,
like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had scarcely
warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside. The

like a stubborn fact, as it was all helped the emphasis.
“In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing
but Facts!"
The speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third
grown person present, all backed a little, and swept
with their eyes the inclined plane of little vessels then
and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial
gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to
the brim.
CHAPTER II.
MURDERING THE INNOCENTS.
THOMAS GRADGRIND, sir. A man of realities. A man
of facts and calculations. A man who proceeds upon
the principle that two and two are four, and nothing
over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for
anything over. Thomas Gradgrind, sir-peremptorily
Thomas-Thomas Gradgrind. With a rule and a pair
of scales, and the multiplication table always in his
pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of
human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to. It
is a mere question of figures, a case of simple arithme-
tic. You might hope to get some other nonsensical belief
into the head of George Gradgrind, or Augustus Grad-
grind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all sup-
posititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of
Thomas Gradgrind—no, sir!
In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally intro-
duced himself, whether to his private circle of ac-
quaintance, or to the public in general. In such terms,
no doubt, substituting the words “boys and girls,” for
"sir,” Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Grad-
grind to the little pitchers before him, who were to be
filled so full of facts.
Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cel-
larage before mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon
loaded to the muzzle with facts, and prepared to blow
them clean out of the regions of childhood at one dis-
charge. He seemed a galvanising apparatus, too,
charged with a grim, mechanical substitute for the

that peristy Jupe, id curtseyinmania Mhe Cecilia:"ed the you
tender young imaginations that were to be stormed
away.
“Ġirl number twenty," said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely
pointing with his square forefinger. “I don't know
that girl. Who is that girl?”
“Sissy Jupe, sir,” explained number twenty, blushing,
standing up, and curtseying.
“Sissy is not a name," said Mr. Gradgrind. “Don't
call yourself Sissy. Call yourself Cecilia.”
“It's father as calls me Sissy, sir,” returned the young
girl in a trembling voice, and with another curtsey.
“ Then he has no business to do it,” said Mr. Grad-
grind. “Tell him he mustn't. Cecilia Jupe. Let me
see. What is your father?”
“He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir."
Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objection-
able calling with his hand.
“We don't want to know anything about that, here.
You mustn't tell us about that, here. Your father
breaks horses, don't he?"
“If you please, sir, when they can get any to break,
they do break horses in the ring, sir.”
“You mustn't tell us about the ring, here. Very well,
then. Describe your father as a horsebreaker. He
doctors sick horses, I dare say?”
“Oh, yes, sir.”
“Very well, then. He is a veterinary surgeon, a
farrier, and horsebreaker. Give me your definition of a
horse."
(Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this
demand.)
“Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!” said
Mr. Gradgrind, for the general behoof of all the little
pitchers. “Girl number twenty possessed of no facts
in reference to one of the commonest of animals! Some
boy's definition of a horse. Bitzer, yours.”
The square finger, moving here and there, lighted sud-
denly on Bitzer, perhaps because he chanced to sit in the
same ray of sunlight which, darting in at one of the bare
windows of the intensely whitewashed room, irradiated
Sissy. For the boys and girls sat on the face of the in-
clined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre
by a narrow interval; and Sissy, being at the corner of
a row on the sunny side, came in for the beginning of a

sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the corner of a row
on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught the end.
But, whereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired,
that she seemed to receive a deeper and more lustrous
colour from the sun, when it shone upon her, the boy
was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same
rays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he
ever possessed. His cold eyes would hardly have been
eyes, but for the short ends of lashes which, by bring-
ing them into immediate contrast with something paler
than themselves, expressed their form. His short-
cropped hair might have been a mere continuation of
the sandy freckles on his forehead and face. His skin
was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge,
that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed
white.
“Bitzer,” said Thomas Gradgrind, “your definition
of a horse.”
“Quadruped. Graminiverous. Forty teeth, namely
twenty-four grinders, foureye-teeth, and twelve incisive.
Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy countries, sheds
hoofs, too. Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with
iron. Age known by marks in mouth.” Thus (and
much more) Bitzer.
“Now girl number twenty," said Mr. Gradgrind, “you
know what a horse is.”
She curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper
if she could have blushed deeper than she had blushed
all this time. Bitzer, after rapidly blinking at Thomas
Gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the
light upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked
like the antennæ of busy insects, put his knuckles to his
freckled forehead and sat down again.
The third gentleman now stepped forth. A mighty
man at cutting and drying, he was; a government
officer; in his way (and in most other people's too), a
professed pugilist; always in training, always with a
system to force down the general throat like a bolus,
always to be heard of at the bar of his little Public-
office, ready to fight all England. To continue in fistic
phraseology, he had a genius for coming up to the
scratch, wherever and whatever it was, and proving
himself an ugly customer. He would go in and damage
any subject whatever with his right, follow up with his

left, stop, exchange, counter, bore his opponent (he
always fought All England) to the ropes, and fall upon
upon him neatly. He was certain to knock the wind
out of common-sense, and render that unlucky adver-
sary deaf to the call of time. And he had it in charge
from high authority to bring about the great public-
office Millennium, when Commissioners should reign
upon earth.
“ Very well,” said this gentleman, briskly smiling,
and folding his arms. “That's a horse. Now let me
ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a room with
representations of horses?".
After a pause, one-half of the children cried in chorus,
“Yes, sir!" Upon which the other half, seeing in the
gentleman's face that Yes was wrong, cried out in
chorus, “ No, sir!”—as the custom is, in these exami-
nations.
“Of course, No. Why wouldn't you?”
A pause. One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy
manner of breathing, ventured the answer, Because he
wouldn't paper a room at all, but would paint it.
“You must paper it," said the gentleman, rather
warmly.
“ You must paper it,” said Thomas Gradgrind,
“whether you like it or not. Don't tell us you wouldn't
paper it. What do you mean, boy?”
“I'll explain to you, then,” said the gentleman, after
another and a dismal pause, “why you wouldn't paper
a room with representations of horses. Do you ever see
horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality
-in fact? Do you?”
“Yes, sir!” from one-half. “No, sir!" from the other.
“Of course, no," said the gentleman, with an indig-
nant look at the wrong half. “Why, then, you are not
to see anywhere, what you don't see in fact; you are not
to have anywhere, what you don't have in fact. What
is called Taste, is only another name for Fact.”
Thomas Gradgrind nodded his approbation.
“ This is a new principle, a discovery, a great dis-
covery,” said the gentleman. “Now, I'll try you again.
Suppose you were going to carpet a room. Would
you use a carpet having a representation of flowers
upon it?"
There being a general conviction by this time that

“No,sir!" was always the right answer to this gentleman,
the chorus of No was very strong. Only a few feeble
stragglers said Yes; among them Sissy Jupe.
“Girl number twenty,” said the gentleman, smiling
in the calm strength of knowledge.
Sissy blushed, and stood up.
“So you would carpet your room-or your husband's
room, if you were a grown woman, and had a husband
-with representations of flowers, would you?” said the
gentleman. “Why would you?"
“If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,” re-
turned the girl.
“And is that why you would put tables and chairs
upon them, and have people walking over them with
heavy boots?”
“IČ wouldn't hurt them, sir. They wouldn't crush
and wither, if you please, sir. They would be the pic-
tures of what was very pretty and pleasant, and I would
fancy_”
“Ăy, ay, ay! But you mustn't fancy,” cried the gen-
tleman, quite elated by coming so happily to his point.
“That's it! You are never to fancy.”
“ You are not, Cecilia Jupe,” Thomas Gradgrind sol-
emnly repeated, “ to do anything of that kind.”
“Fact, fact, fact!” said the gentleman. And “Fact,
fact, fact!” repeated Thomas Gradgrind.
“You are to be in all things regulated and governed,"
said the gentleman, “by fact. We hope to have, before
long, a board of fact, composed of commissioners of
fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact,
and nothing but fact. You must discard the word
Fancy altogether. You have nothing to do with it.
You are not to have, in any object of use or ornament,
what would be a contradiction in fact. You don't walk
upon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk
upon flowers in carpets. You don't find that foreign
birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crock-
ery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and
butterflies upon your crockery. You never meet with
quadrupeds going up and down walls; you must not
have quadrupeds represented on walls. You must use,”
said the gentleman, “ for all these purposes, combina-
tions and modifications (in primary colours) of mathe-
matical figures which are susceptible of proof and

demonstration. This is the new discovery. This is fact.
This is taste.
The girl curtseyed, and sat down. She was very
young, and she looked as if she were frightened by the
matter of fact prospect the world afforded.
“Now, if Mr. M’Choakumchild,” said the gentleman,
“ will proceed to give his first lesson here, Mr. Grad-
grind, I shall be happy, at your request, to observe his
mode of procedure.”
Mr. Gradgrind was much obliged. “Mr. M'Choak-
umchild, we only wait for you.”
So, Mr. M'Choakumchild began in his best manner.
He and some one hundred and forty other schoolmasters,
had been lately turned at the same time, in the same
factory, on the same principles, like so many pianoforte
legs. He had been put through an immense variety of
paces, and had answered volumes of head-breaking
questions. Orthography, etymology, syntax, and pro-
sody, biography, astronomy, geography, and general
cosmography, the sciences of compound proportion, alge-
bra, land-surveying and levelling, vocal music, and draw-
ing from models, were all at the ends of his ten chilled
fingers. He had worked his stony way into Her Ma-
jesty's most Honourable Privy Council's Schedule B, and
had taken the bloom off the higher branches of mathe-
matics and physical science, French, German, Latin, and
Greek. He knew all about all the Water Sheds of all
the world (whatever they are), and all the histories of
all the peoples, and all the names of all the rivers and
mountains, and all the productions, manners, and cus-
toms of all the countries, and all their boundaries and
bearings on the two and thirty points of the compass.
Ah, rather overdone, M'Choakumchild. If he had only
learnt a little less, how infinitely better he might have
taught much more!
He went to work in this preparatory lesson, not un-
like Morgiana in the Forty Thieves: looking into all the
vessels ranged before him, one after another, to see what
they contained. Say, good M’Choakumchild. When
from thy boiling store, thou shalt fill each jar brim full
by-and-by, dost thou think that thou wilt always kill
outright the robber Fancy lurking within-or some-
times only maim him and distort him!

CHAPTER III.
A LOOPHOLE.
MR. GRADGRIND walked homeward from the school, in
a state of considerable satisfaction. It was his school,
and he intended it to be a model. He intended every
child in it to be a model-just as the young Gradgrinds
were all models.
There were five young Gradgrinds, and they were
models every one. They had been lectured at, from
their tenderest years; coursed like little hares. Almost
as soon as they could run alone, they had been made to
run to the lecture-room. The first object with which
they had an association, or of which they had a remem-
brance, was a large black-board with a dry Ogre chalk-
ing ghastly white figures on it.
Not that they knew, by name or nature, anything
about an Ogre. Fact forbid! I only use the word to ex-
press a monster in a lecturing castle, with Heaven knows
how many heads manipulated into one, taking childhood
captive and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by
the hair.
No little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon;
it was up in the moon before it could speak distinctly.
No little Gradgrind had ever learnt the silly jingle,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star; how I wonder what you
are! No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the
subject, each little Gradgrind having at five years old
dissected the Great Bear like a Professor Owen, and
driven Charles's Wain like a locomotive engine-driver.
No little Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field
with that famous cow with the crumpled horn who
tossed the dog who worried the cat who killed the rat
who ate the malt, or with that yet more famous cow who
swallowed Tom Thumb: it had never heard of those
celebrities, and had only been introduced to a cow as a
graminivorous ruminating quadruped with several
stomachs.
To his matter of fact home, which was called Stone
Lodge, Mr. Gradgrind directed his steps. He had virtually

retired from the wholesale hardware trade before he built
Stone Lodge, and was now looking about for a suitable
opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in Parlia-
ment. Stone Lodge was situated on a moor within a
mile or two of a great town-called Coketown in the
present faithful guide-book.
A very regular feature on the face of the country,
Stone Lodge was. Not the least disguise toned down or
shaded off that uncompromising fact in the landscape.
A great square house, with a heavy portico darkening
the principal windows, as its master's heavy brows over-
shadowed his eyes. A calculated, cast up, balanced, and
proved house. Six windows on this side of the door, six
on that; a total of twelve in this wing, a total of twelve
in the other wing; four-and-twenty carried over to the
back wings. A lawn and garden and an infant avenue,
all ruled straight like a botanical account-book. Gas
and ventilation, drainage and water-service, all of the
primest quality. Iron clamps and girders, fireproof from
top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with
all their brushes and brooms; everything that heart
could desire.
Everything? Well, I suppose so. The little Grad-
grinds had cabinets in various departments of science
too. They had a little conchological cabinet, and a
little metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical
cabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and la-
belled, and the bits of stone and ore looked as though
they might have been broken from the parent substances
by those tremendously hard instruments, their own
names; and, to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper,
who had never found his way into their nursery, If the
greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at more than this, what
was it, for good gracious goodness' sake, that the greedy
little Gradgrinds grasped at!
Their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied
frame of mind. He was an affectionate father, after
his manner; but he would probably have described him-
self (if he had been put, like Sissy Jupe, upon a defini-
tion) as “an eminently practical” father. He had a par-
ticular pride in the phrase eminently practical, which
was considered to have a special application to him.

towner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his
eminently practical friend Gradgrind. This always
pleased the eminently practical friend. He knew it to
be his due, but his due was acceptable.
He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts
of the town, which was neither town nor country, and
yet was either spoiled, when his ears were invaded by the
sound of music. The clashing and banging band at-
tached to the horse-riding establishment which had there
set up its rest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray. A
flag, floating from the summit of the temple, proclaimed
to mankind that it was “Sleary's Horse-riding” which
claimed their suffrages. Sleary himself, a stout modern
statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesias-
tical niche of early Gothic architecture, took the money.
Miss Josephine Sleary, as some very long and very nar-
row strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugu-
rating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian
Tyrolean flower-act. Among the other pleasing but
always strictly moral wonders, which must be seen to
be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to “ eluci-
date the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained
performing dog Merrylegs.” He was also to exhibit
“his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-
weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head,
thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat
never before attempted in this or any other country, and
which, having elicited such rapturous plaudits from en-
thusiastic throngs, it cannot be withdrawn.” The same
Signor Jupe was to “enliven the varied performances at
frequent intervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips
and retorts.” Lastly, he was to wind them up by
appearing in his favorite character of Mr. William
Button, of Tooley Street, in “the highly novel and
laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor's Journey to
Brentford.”
Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of
course, but passed on as a practical man ought to pass
on, either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts,
or consigning them to the House of Correction. But the
turning of the road took him by the back of the booth,
and at the back of the booth a number of children were
congregated in a number of stealthy attitudes, striving
to peep in at the hidden glories of the place.

This brought him to a stop. “Now, to think of these
vagabonds," said he, “attracting the young rabble from
a model school.”
A space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being be-
tween him and the young rabble, he took his eyeglass
out of his waistcoat to look for any child he knew by
name, and might order off. Phenomenon almost in-
credible though distinctly seen, what did he then behold
but his own metallurgical Louisa peeping with all her
might through a hole in a deal board, and his own
mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground
to catch but a hoof of the graceful equestrian Tyrolean
flower-act!
Dumb with amazement, Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the
spot where his family was thus disgraced, laid his hand
upon each erring child, and said:
“Louisa! Thomas!”
Both rose, red and disconcerted. But Louisa looked
at her father with more boldness than Thomas did.
Indeed, Thomas did not look at him, but gave himself
up to be taken home like a machine.
“In the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!" said
Mr. Gradgrind, leading each away by a hand; “ what
do you do here?”
"Wanted to see what it was like,” returned Louisa,
shortly.
“ What it was like?”
“Yes, father.”
There was an air of jaded sullenness in them both,
and particularly in the girl; yet, struggling through
the dissatisfaction of her face, there was a light with
nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a
starved imagination keeping life in itself somehow,
which brightened its expression. Not with the bright-
ness natural to cheerful youth, but with uncertain,
eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in
them, analogous to the changes on a blind face groping
its way.
She was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no
distant day would seem to become a woman all at once.
Her father thought so as he looked at her. She was
pretty. Would have been self-willed (he thought in his
eminently practical way), but for her bringing-up.
“ Thomas, though I have the fact before me, I find it

difficult to believe that you, with your education and
resources, should have brought your sister to a scene
like this."
“I brought him, father,” said Louisa, quickly. “I
asked him to come.”
“I am sorry to hear it. I am very sorry indeed to hear
it. It makes Thomas no better, and it makes you worse,
Louisa.”
She looked at her father again, but no tear fell down
her cheek.
“You! Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the
sciences is open; Thomas and you, who may be said to
be replete with facts; Thomas and you, who have been
trained to mathematical exactness; Thomas and you,
here!" cried Mr. Gradgrind. “In this degraded posi-
tion! I am amazed.”
“I was tired, father. I have been tired a long time,”
said Louisa.
“Tired? Of what?" asked the astonished father.
“I don't know of what-of everything, I think.”
“ Say not another word,” returned Mr. Gradgrind.
“You are childish. I will hear no more.” He did not
speak again until they had walked some half a mile in
silence, when he gravely broke out with: “ What would
your best friends say, Louisa? Do you attach no value
to their good opinion? What would Mr. Bounderby
say?"
At the mention of this name his daughter stole a look
at him, remarkable for its intense and searching char-
acter. He saw nothing of it, for before he looked at
her she had again cast down her eyes!
“What,” he repeated presently, “would Mr. Boun-
derby say!” All the way to Stone Lodge, as with grave
indignation he led the two delinquents home, he re-
peated at intervals, “ What would Mr. Bounderby say!”
-as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.

CHAPTER IV.
MR. BOUNDERBY.
Not being. Bounders a man peal relatio
Not being Mrs. Grundy, who was Mr. Bounderby.
Why, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Grad-
grind's bosom friend as a man perfectly devoid of senti-
ment can approach that spiritual relationship towards
another man perfectly devoid of sentiment. So near
was Mr. Bounderby-or, if the reader should prefer it,
so far off.
He was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer,
and what not. A big, loud man, with a stare, and a
metallic laugh. A man made out of a coarse material,
which seemed to have been stretched to make so much
of him. A man with a great puffed head and forehead,
swelled veins in his temples, and such a strained skin to
his face that it seemed to hold his eyes open, and lift his
eyebrows up. A man with a pervading appearance on
him of being inflated like a balloon, and ready to start.
A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-
made man. A man who was always proclaiming, through
that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his, his old
ignorance and his old poverty. A man who was the
Bully of humility.
A year or two younger than his eminently practical
friend, Mr. Bounderby looked older; his seven or eight
and forty might have had the seven or eight added
to it again, without surprising anybody. He had not
much hair. One might have fancied he had talked it
off; and that what was left, all standing up in disorder,
was in that condition from being constantly blown about
by his windy boastfulness.
In the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge, standing
on the hearth-rug, warming himself before the fire, Mr.
Bounderby delivered some observations to Mrs. Grad-
grind on the circumstance of its being his birthday. He
stood before the fire, partly because it was a cool spring
afternoon, though the sun shone; partly because the
shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by the ghost
of damp mortar; partly because he thus took up a

commanding position, from which to subdue Mrs.
Gradgrind.
“I hadn't a shoe to my foot. As to a stocking, I didn't
know such a thing by name. I passed the day in a ditch,
and the night in a pigsty. That's the way I spent my
tenth birthday. Not that a ditch was new to me, for I
was born in a ditch.”
Mrs. Gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle
of shawls, of surpassing feebleness, mental and bodily;
who was always taking physic without any effect, and
who, whenever she showed a symptom of coming to
life, was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of
fact tumbling on her; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a
dry ditch?
No! As wet as a sop. A foot of water in it,” said
Mr. Bounderby.
“Enough to give a baby cold,” Mrs. Gradgrind con-
sidered.
“Cold? I was born with inflammation of the lungs,
and of everything else, I believe, that was capable of
inflammation,” returned Mr. Bounderby. “For years,
ma'am, I was one of the most miserable little wretches
ever seen. I was so sickly, that I was always moaning
and groaning. I was so ragged and dirty, that you
wouldn't have touched me with a pair of tongs.”
Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the
most appropriate thing her imbecility could think of
“How I fought through it, I don't know,” said Boun-
derby. “I was determined, I suppose. I have been a
determined character in later life, and I suppose I was
then. Here I am, Mrs. Gradgrind, anyhow, and no-
body to thank for my being here but myself.”
Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his
mother-
“My mother? Bolted, ma'am!” said Bounderby.
Mrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave
it up.
“My mother left me to my grandmother,” said Boun-
derby; "and, according to the best of my remembrance,
my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old
woman that ever lived. If I got a little pair of shoes
by any chance, she would take 'em off and sell 'em for
drink. Why, I have known that grandmother of mine

before breakfast!”
Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other
sign of vitality, looked (as she always did) like an in-
differently executed transparency of a small female
figure, without enough light behind it.
"She kept a chandler's shop,” pursued Bounderby,
“and kept me in an egg-box. That was the cot of
my infancy; an old egg-box. As soon as I was big
enough to run away, of course I ran away. Then I
became a young vagabond; and instead of one old woman
knocking me about and starving me, everybody of all
ages knocked me about and starved me. They were
right; they had no business to do anything else. I was
a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest. I know that
very well.”
His pride in having at any time of his life achieved
such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance, an
incumbrance, and a pest, was only to be satisfied by
three sonorous repetitions of the boast.
“I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind.
Whether I was to do it or not, ma'am, I did it. I pulled
through it, though nobody threw me out a rope. Vaga-
bond, errand-boy,vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk, chief
manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.
Those are the antecedents, and culmination. Josiah
Bounderby of Coketown learn this letters from the out-
sides of the shops, Mrs.Gradgrind, and was first able to tell
time upon a dial-plate, from studying the steeple clock
of St. Giles's Church, London, under the direction of a
drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an in-
corrigible vagrant. Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown,
of your district schools and your model schools, and your
training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish schools;
and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown tells you plainly,
all right, all correct-he hadn't such advantages-but
let us have hard-headed, solid-fisted people—the educa-
tion that made him won't do for everybody, he knows
well-such and such his education was, however, and
you may force him to swallow boiling fat, but you shall
never force him to suppress the facts of his life.”
Being heated when he arrived at this climax, Josialı
Bounderby of Coketown stopped. He stopped just as

two young culprits, entered the room. His eminently
practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave
Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said, “Behold
your Bounderby!”
“Well!" blustered Mr. Bounderby, “what's the mat-
ter? What is young Thomas in the dumps about?”.
He spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa.
“We were peeping at the circus," muttered Louisa,
haughtily, without lifting up her eyes, “and father
caught us."
- "And, Mrs. Gradgrind,” said her husband in a lofty
manner, “I should as soon have expected to find my
children reading poetry.”
“Dear me," whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind. “How can
you, Louisa and Thomas! I wonder at you! I declare
you are enough to make one regret ever having had a
family at all. I have a great mind to say I wish I
hadn't. Then what would you have done, I should like
to know."
Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by
these cogent remarks. He frowned impatiently.
“As if, with my head in its present throbbing state,
you couldn't go and look at the shells and minerals and
things provided for you, instead of circuses!” said Mrs.
Gradgrind. “You know, as well as I do, no young
people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets,
or attend lectures about circuses. What can you pos-
sibly want to know of circuses then? I am sure you
have enough to do, if that's what you want. With my
head in its present state, I couldn't remember the mere
names of half the facts you have got to attend to."
“That's the reason!" pouted Louisa..
“Don't tell me that's the reason, because it can be
nothing of the sort,” said Mrs. Gradgrind. “Go and be
somethingological directly.” Mrs. Gradgrind was not
a scientific character, and usually dismissed her children
to their studies with this general injunction to choose
their pursuit.
In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind's stock of facts in general
was woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind, in raising
her to her high matrimonial position, had been influ-
enced by two reasons. Firstly, she was most satisfac-
tory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had
“no nonsense” about her. By nonsense he meant

fancy; and truly it is probable she was as free from any
alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived
at the perfection of an absolute idiot ever was.
The simple circumstance of being left alone with her
husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this
admirable lady again without collision between herself
and any other fact. So she once more died away, and
nobody minded her.
“Bounderby,” said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair
to the fireside, “ you are always so interested in my
young people-particularly in Louisa_that I make no
apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by
this discovery. I have systematically devoted myself
(as you know) to the education of the reason of my
family. The reason is (as you know) the only faculty to
which education should be addressed. And yet, Bound-
erby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance
of to-day, though in itself a trifling one, as if some-
thing had crept into Thomas's and Louisa's minds which
is-or rather, which is not-I don't know that I can ex-
press myself better than by saying—which has never
been intended to be developed, and in which their
reason has no part.”
“There certainly is no reason in looking with interest
at a parcel of vagabonds,” returned Bounderby. “When
I was a vagabond myself, nobody looked with any inter-
est at me; I know that."
“Then comes the question," said the eminently prac-
tical father, with his eyes on the fire, “in what has this
vulgar curiosity its rise?"
“I'll tell you in what. In idle imagination.”
“I hope not,” said the eminently practical; “I confess,
however, that the misgiving has crossed me on my way
home."
“An idle imagination, Gradgrind,” repeated Boun-
derby. “A very bad thing for anybody, but a cursed bad
thing for a girl. like Louisa. I should ask Mrs. Grad-
grind's pardon for strong expressions, but that she
knows very well I am not a refined character. Whoever
expects refinement in me will be disappointed. I hadn't
a refined bringing up.”
“Whether,” said Mr. Gradgrind, pondering with his
hands in his pockets, and his cavernous eyes on the fire,
“ whether any instructor or servant can have suggested

anything? Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been
reading anything? Whether, in spite of all precautions,
any idle story-book can have got into the house? Be-
cause, in minds that have been practically formed by
rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious,
so incomprehensible.”
“Stop a bit!” cried Bounderby, who all this time had
been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the
very furniture of the room with explosive humility.
“You have one of those strollers' children in the school.”
“Cecilia Jupe, by name," said Mr. Gradgrind, with
something of a stricken look at his friend.
“Now, stop a bit!” cried Bounderby again. “How did
she come there?”
“Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first
time, only just now. She specially applied here at the
house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our
town, and yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are
right.”
“Now, stop a bit!” cried Bounderby once more.
“ Louisa saw her when she came?”
“Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the
application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt,
in Mrs. Gradgrind's presence.”
“Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,” said Bounderby, “what
passed?'
“Oh, my poor health!" returned Mrs. Gradgrind.
“The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Grad-
grind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa
and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come,
and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how
was it possible to contradict them when such was the
fact!”
“Now, I tell you what, Gradgrind!” said Mr. Boun-
derby. “Turn this girl to the rightabout, and there's an
end of it.”
“I am much of your opinion.”
“Do it at once," said Bounderby, “has always been
my motto from a child. When I thought I would run
away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did it
at once. Do you the same. Do this at once!”.
“Are you walking?” asked his friend. “I have the
father's address. Perhaps you would not mind walking
to town with me?”

“Not the least in the world,” said Mr. Bounderby,
“as long as you do it at once!"
So Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat-he always threw
it on, as expressing a man who had been far too busily
employed in making himself, to acquire any fashion of
wearing his hat-and with his hands in his pockets,
sauntered out into the hall. “I never wear gloves,” it
was his custom to say. “I didn't climb up the ladder in
them. Shouldn't be so high up if I had."
Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while
Mr. Gradgrind went up-stairs for the address, he opened
the door of the children's study and looked into that se-
rene floor-clothed apartment, which, notwithstanding its
book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned and
philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of
a room devoted to hair-cutting. Louisa languidly leaned
upon the window looking out, without looking at any-
thing, while young Thomas stood sniffing revengefully
at the fire. Adam Smith and Malthus, two younger
Gradgrinds, were out at a lecture in custody; and little
Jane, after manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay
on her face with slate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep
over vulgar fractions.
“It's all right now, Louisa; it's all right, young
Thomas,” said Mr. Bounderby; "you won't do so any
more. I'll answer for it's being all over with father.
Well, Louisa, that's worth a kiss, isn't it?”
“You can take one, Mr. Bounderby," returned Louisa,
when she had coldly paused, and slowly walked across
the room, and ungraciously raised her cheek towards
him, with her face turned away.
“Always my pet; an't you, Louisa?" said Mr. Boun-
derby. “Good-bye, Louisa!”
He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rub-
bing the cheek he had kissed, with her handkerchief,
until it was burning red. She was still doing this, five
minutes afterwards.
“ What are you about, Loo?” her brother sulkily re-
monstrated. “You'll rub a hole in your face.”
“You may cut the piece out with your penknife if
you like, Tom. I wouldn't cry!"

CHAPTER V.
THE KEY-NOTE.
COKETOWN, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind
now walked, was a triumph of fact; it had no greater
taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself. Let
us strike the key-note, Coketown, before pursuing our
tune.
It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have
been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as
matters stood it was a town of unnatural red and black
like the painted face of a savage. It was a town of ma-
chinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable
serpents of smoke trailed themselves forever and ever,
and never got uncoiled. It had a black canal in it, and
a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and vast
piles of building full of windows where there was a rat-
tling and trembling all day long, and where the piston
of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down,
like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy
madness. It contained several large streets all very like
one another, and many small streets still more like one
another, inhabited by people equally like one another,
who all went in and out at the same hours, with the
same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same
work, and to whom every day was the same as yester-
day and to-morrow, and every year the counterpart of
the last and the next.
These attributes of Coketown were in the main insep-
arable from the work by which it was sustained; against
them were to be set off, comforts of life which found
their way all over the world, and elegancies of life which
made, we will not ask how much of the fine lady, who
could scarcely bear to hear the place mentioned. The
rest of its features were voluntary, and they were these:
You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely
workful. If the members of a religious persuasion built
a chapel thereas the members of eighteen religious
persuasions had done—they made it a pious warehouse
of red brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly

ornamented examples) a bell in a bird-cage on the top of
it. The solitary exception was the New Church; a
stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door, ter-
minating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden
legs. All the public inscriptions in the town were
painted alike, in severe characters of black and white.
The jail might have been the infirmary, the infirmary
might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been
either, or both, or anything else, for anything that ap-
peared to the contrary in the graces of their construc-
tion. Fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the material aspect
of the town; fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the imma-
terial. The M'Choakumchild school was all fact, and
the School of Design was all fact, and the rela-
tions between master and man were all fact, and
everything was fact between the lying-in hospital and
the cemetery, and what you couldn't state in figures, or
show to be purchasable in the cheapest market and
salable in the dearest, was not, and never should be,
world without end, Amen.
A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its as-
sertion, of course got on well? Why, no, not quite well.
No? Dear me!
No. Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces,
in all respects like gold that had stood the fire. First,
the perplexing mystery of the place was, Who belonged
to the eighteen denominations? Because, whoever did,
the labouring people did not. It was very strange to
walk through the streets on a Sunday morning and note
how few of them the barbarous jangling of bells, that
was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away from
their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the
corners of their own streets, where they lounged listlessly,
gazing at all the church and chapel going, as at a thing
with which they had no manner of concern. Nor was it
merely the stranger who noticed this, because there was
a native organization in Coketown itself, whose mem-
bers were to be heard of in the House of Commons every
session, indignantly petitioning for acts of Parliament
that should make these people religious by main force.
Then came the Teetotal Society, who complained that
these same people would get drunk, and showed in tab-
ular statements that they did get drunk, and proved at
tea parties that no inducement, human or Divine (ex-

HARD TIMES.
cept a medal), would induce them to forego their cus-
tom of getting drunk. Then came the chemist and
druggist, with other tabular statements, showing that
when they didn't get drunk they took opium. Then
came the experienced chaplain of the jail, with more
tabular statements, outdoing all the previous tabular
statements, and showing that the same people would re-
sort to low haunts, hidden from the public eye, where
they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and may-
hap joined in it; and where A, B., aged twenty-four
next birthday, and committed for eighteen months' soli-
tary, had himself said (not that he had ever shown him-
self particularly worthy of belief) his ruin began, as he
was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would
have been a tip-top moral specimen. Then came Mr.
Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby, the two gentlemen at this
present moment walking through Coketown, and both
eminently practical, who could, on occasion, furnish
more tabular statements derived from their own per-
sonal experience, and illustrated by cases they had
known and seen, from which it clearly appeared-in
short it was the only clear thing in the case that these
same people were a bad lot altogether, gentlemen; that
do what you would for them they were never thankful
for it, gentlemen; that they were restless, gentlemen;
that they never knew what they wanted; that they
lived upon the best, and bought fresh butter; and in-
sisted on Mocha coffee, and rejected all but prime parts
of meat, and yet were eternally dissatisfied and unman-
ageable. In short, it was the moral of the old nursery
fable:
There was an old woman, and what do you think?
She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;
Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet,
And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet.
Is it possible, I wonder, that there was any analogy
between the case of the Coketown population and the
case of the little Gradgrinds? Surely none of us, in our
sober senses and acquainted with figures, are to be told
at this time of day, that one of the foremost elements
in the existence of the Coketown working people had
been for scores of years deliberately set at nought? That
there was any Fancy in them demanding to be brought
into healthy existence instead of struggling on in con-

vulsions? That exactly in the ratio as they worked long
and monotonously, the craving grew within them for
some physical relief-some relaxation, encouraging
good humour and good spirits, and giving them a vent
---some recognised holiday, though it were but for an
honest dance to a stirring band of music--some oc-
casional light pie in which even M'Choakumchild had
no finger-which craving must and would be satisfied
aright, or must and would inevitably go wrong, until
the laws of the Creation were repealed?
“ This man lives at Pod's End, and I don't quite know
Pod's End,” said Mr. Gradgrind. “Which is it, Boun-
derby?”
Mr. Bounderby knew that it was somewhere down
town, but knew no more respecting it. So they stopped
for a moment, looking about.
Almost as they did so, there came running round the
corner of the street at a quick pace and with a frightened
look, a girl whom Mr. Gradgrind recognised. “Halloa!"
said he. “Stop! Where are you going? Stop!” Girl
number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him
a curtsey.
“Why are you tearing about the streets,” said Mr.
Gradgrind, “in this improper manner?”
“I was—I was run after, sir,” the girl panted, “and I
wanted to get away.”
"Run after?" repeated Mr. Gradgrind. “Who would
run after you?”
The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered
for her by the colourless boy, Bitzer, who came round
the corner with such blind speed and so little antici-
pating a stoppage on the pavement, that he brought
himself up against Mr. Gradgrind's waistcoat and re-
bounded into the road.
“ What do you mean, boy ?” said Mr. Gradgrind.
“What are you doing? How dare you dash against-
everybody-in this manner?”
Bitzer picked up his cap, which the concussion had
knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his forehead,
pleaded that it was an accident.
“ Was this boy running after you, Jupe?” asked Mr.
Gradgrind.
“ Yes, sir.” said the girl reluctantly.
“No, I wasn't, sir,” cried Bitzer. “Not till she run

away from me. But the horse-riders never mind what
they say, sir; they're famous for it. You know the
horse-riders are famous for never minding what they
say,” addressing Sissy. “It's as well known in the
town as-please, sir, as the multiplication table isn't
known to the horse-riders.” Bitzer tried Mr. Bounderby
with this.
“He frightened me so," said the girl, “ with his cruel
faces!”
“Oh!" cried Bitzer. “Oh! An't you one of the rest!
An't you a horse-rider! I never looked at her, sir. I
asked her if she would know how to define a horse to-
morrow, and offered to tell her again, and she ran away,
and I ran after her, sir, that she might know how to an-
swer when she was asked. You wouldn't have thought of
saying such mischief if you hadn't been a horse-rider!”
“Her calling seems to be pretty well known among
'em,” observed Mr. Bounderby. "You'd have had the
whole school peeping in a row, in a week.”
“Truly, I think so," returned his friend. “Bitzer,
turn you about and take yourself home. Jupe, stay
here a moment. Let me hear of your running in this
manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through
the master of the school. You understand what I mean.
Go along.”
The boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his
forehead again, glanced at Sissy, turned about, and
retreated.
“Now, girl," said Mr. Gradgrind, “take this gentle-
man and me to your father's; we are going there.
What have you got in that bottle you are carrying?"
-“ Gin,” said Mr. Bounderby.
“Dear, no, sir! It's the nine oils.”
“The what?” cried Mr. Bounderby.
“The nine oils, sir. To rub father with.” Then said
Mr. Bounderby, with a loud, short laugh, “What the
devil do you rub your father with nine oils for?”
“It's what our people always use, sir, when they get
any hurts in the ring,” replied the girl, looking over her
shoulder, to assure herself that her pursuer was gone.
“They bruise themselves very bad, sometimes.”
"Serve 'em right,” said Mr. Bounderby, “for being
idle.” She glanced up at his face, with mingled aston-
ishment and dread.


## p. 25 (#733) #############################################

“By George!” said Mr. Bounderby, “when I was four
or five years younger than you I had worse bruises upon
me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty oils, would have
rubbed off. I didn't get 'em by posture-making, but by
being banged about. There was no rope-dancing for
me; I danced on the bare ground and was larruped with
the rope."
Mr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means
so rough a man as Mr. Bounderby. His character was
not unkind, all things considered; it might have been a
very kind one, indeed, if he had only made some round
mistake in the arithmetic that balanced it, years ago.
He said, in what he meant for a reassuring tone, as they
turned down a narrow road, “ And this is Pod's End;
is it, Jupe?"
“This is it, sir, and—if you wouldn't mind, sir—this is
the house.”
She stopped, at twilight, at the door of a mean little
public-house, with dim red lights in it. As haggard and
as shabby as if, for want of custom, it had itself taken
to drinking, and had gone the way all drunkards go,
and was very near the end of it.
“It's only crossing the bar, sir, and up the stairs, if
you wouldn't mind, and waiting there for a moment till
I get a candle. If you should hear a dog, sir, it's only
Merrylegs, and he only barks.”
“Merrylegs and nine oils, eh?” said Mr. Bounderby,
entering last with his metallic laugh. “Pretty well
this, for a self-made man!”

CHAPTER VL
SLEARY'S HORSEMANSHIP.
The name of the public-house was the Pegasus's Arms.
The Pegasus's legs might have been more to the pur-
pose; but, underneath the winged horse upon the sign-
board, the Pegasus's Arms was inscribed in Roman let-
ters. Beneath that inscription again, in a flowing scroll,
the painter had touched off the lines:
Good malt makes good beer,
Walk in, and they'll draw it here;
Good wine makes good brandy,
Give us a call, and you'll find it handy.
Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy
little bar, was another Pegasus-a theatrical one-with
real gauze let in for his wings, golden stars stuck on all
over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk.
As it had grown too dusky without to see the sign,
and as it had not grown light enough within to see the
picture, Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby received no
offence from these idealities. They followed the girl up
some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and
stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle.
They expected every moment to hear Merrylegs give
tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not
barked when the girl and the candle appeared together.
“Father is not in our room, sir,” she said, with a face
of great surprise. “If you wouldn't mind walking in,
I'll find him directly.”.
They walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs for
them, sped away with a quick, light step. It was a
mean, shabbily furnished room, with a bed in it. The
white night-cap, embellished with two peacock's feathers
and a pigtail bolt upright, in which Signor Jupe had
that very afternoon enlivened the varied performances
with his chaste Shaksperian quips and retorts, hung
upon a nail; but no other portion of his wardrobe, or
other token of himself or his pursuits, was to be seen
anywhere. As to Merrylegs, that respectable ancestor

Arnher heas sissy presebounding
atherighe ca batteboked
They heard the doors of rooms above opening and
shutting as Sissy went from one to another in quest of
her father; and presently they heard voices expressing
surprise. She came bounding down again in a great
hurry, opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk,
found it empty, and looked round with her hands clasped
and her face full of terror.
“Father must have gone down to the Booth, sir. I
don't know why he should go there, but he must be
there; I'll bring him in a minute!” She was gone di-
rectly, without her bonnet; with her long, dark, childish
hair streaming behind her.
“What does she mean!” said Mr. Gradgrind. “Back
in a minute? It's more than a mile off.”
Before Mr. Bounderby could reply, a young man ap-
peared at the door, and introducing himself with the
words, “By your leaves, gentlemen!” walked in with
his hands in his pockets. His face, close-shaven, thin,
and sallow, was shaded by a great quantity of dark
hair, brushed into a roll all round his head, and parted
up the centre. His legs were very robust, but shorter
than legs of good proportions should have been. His
chest and back were as much too broad as his legs were
too short. He was dressed in a Newmarket coat and
tight-fitting trousers; wore a shawl round his neck;
smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses' provender,
and sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Cen-
taur, compounded of the stable and the play-house.
Where the one began, and the other ended, nobody
could have told with any precision. This gentleman
was mentioned in the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B.
Childers, so justly celebrated for his daring vaulting act
as the Wild Huntsman of the North American Prairies;
in which popular performance, a diminutive boy with
an old face, who now accompanied him, assisted as his
infant son: being carried upside down over his father's
shoulder, by one foot, and held by the crown of his head,
heels upwards, in the palm of his father's hand, accord-
ing to the violent paternal manner in which wild hunts-
men may be observed to fondle their offspring, Made

up with curls, wreaths, wings, white bismuth, and car-
mine, this hopeful young person soared into so pleasing
a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the mater-
nal part of the spectators; but in private, where his char-
acteristics were a precocious cutaway coat and an ex-
tremely gruff voice, he became of the Turf, turfy.
“By your leaves, gentlemen,” said Mr. E. W. B.
Childers, glancing round the room. “It was you, I be-
lieve, that were wishing to see Jupe?”.
“It was," said Mr. Gradgrind. “His daughter has
gone to fetch him, but I can't wait; therefore, if you
please, I will leave a message for him with you.”
“You see, my friend,” Mr. Bounderby put in, “we
are the kind of people who know the value of time, and
you are the kind of people who don't know the value of
time.”
“I have not,” retorted Mr. Childers, after surveying
him from head to foot, “the honor of knowing you—
but if you mean that you can make more money of your
time than I can of mine, I should judge from your ap-
pearance that you are about right.”
“And when you have made it, you can keep it too, I
should think,” said Cupid.
“Kidderminster, stow that!” said Mr. Childers.
(Master Kidderminster was Cupid's real name.)
“What does he come here cheeking us for, then?”
cried Master Kidderminster, showing a very irascible
temperament. “If you want to cheek us, pay your ochre
at the doors and take it out.”
“Kidderminster,” said Mr. Childers, raising his voice,
“stow that!-Sir,” to Mr. Gradgrind, “I was addressing .
myself to you. You may or you may not be aware (for
perhaps you have not been much in the audience), that
Jupe has missed his tip very often, lately."
"Has—what has he missed?" asked Mr. Gradgrind,
glancing at the potent Bounderby for assistance.
.“Missed his tip.”
“ Offered at the Garters four times last night, and
never done 'em once,” said Master Kidderminster.
“Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was loose in his
ponging."
“Didn't do what he ought to do. Was short in his
leaps and bad in his tumbling,” Mr. Childers inter-
preted.

“Oh!” said Mr. Gradgrind, "that is tip, is it?”
“In a general way that's missing his tip,” Mr. E. W.
B. Childers answered.
“Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners,
and ponging, eh!" ejaculated Bounderby, with his
laugh of laughs. “Queer sort of company, too, for a
man who has raised himself.”
“Lower yourself, then,” retorted Cupid. “Oh, Lord!
if you've raised yourself so high as all that comes to,
let yourself down a bit.”
“This is a very obtrusive lad!" said Mr. Gradgrind,
turning, and knitting his brows on him.
• We'd have had a young gentleman to meet you, if
we had known you were coming," retorted Master Kid-
derminster, nothing abashed. “It's a pity you don't
have a bespeak, being so particular. You're on the
Tight-Jeff, ain't you?”
* What does this unmannerly boy mean," asked Mr.
Gradgrind, eyeing him in a sort of desperation, “by
Tight-Jeff”
* There! Get out, get out!” said Mr. Childers, thrust-
ing his young friend from the room, rather in the prairie
manner. “Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff, it don't much signify:
it's only tight-rope and slack-rope. You were going to
give me a message for Jupe?”
“Yes, I was.”
“Then,” continued Mr. Childers, quickly, “my opinion
is, he will never receive it. Do you know much of
him?"
“I never saw the man in my life.”
“I doubt if you ever will see him now. It's pretty
plain to me, he's off.”
“Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?”
“Ay! I mean," said Mr. Childers, with a nod, “ that
he has cut. He was goosed last night, he was goosed
the night before last, he was goosed to-day. He has
lately got into the way of being always goosed, and he
can't stand it.”
“Why has he been so very much-Goosed?” asked
Mr. Gradgrind, forcing the word out of himself, with
great solemnity and reluctance.
“His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used
up,” said Childers. “He has his points as a Cackler
still, but he can't get a living out of them."

“A Cackler!" Bounderby repeated. “Here we go
again!”
A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,” said Mr.
E. W. B. Childers, superciliously throwing the interpre-
tation over his shoulder, and accompanying it with a
shake of his long hair—which all shook at once. “Now,
it's a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper,
to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed,
than to go through with it.”
“Good!” interrupted Mr. Bounderby. “This is good,
Gradgrind! A man so fond of his daughter, that he
runs away from her! This is devilish good! Ha! ha!
Now, I'll tell you what, young man. I haven't always
occupied my present station of life. I know what these
things are. You may be astonished to hear it, but my
mother ran away from me.”
E. W. B. Childers replied, pointedly, that he was not
at all astonished to hear it.
“Very well,” said Bounderby. “I was born in a ditch,
and my mother ran away from me. Do I excuse her for
it? No. Have I ever excused her for it? Not I. What
do I call her for it? I call her probably the very worst
woman that ever lived in the world, except my drunken
grandmother. There's no family pride about me, there's
no imaginative sentimental humbug about me. I call a
spade a spade; and I call the mother of Josiah Boun-
derby of Coketown, without any fear or any favor, what I
should call her if she had been the mother of Dick Jones
of Wapping. So with this man. He is a runaway rogue
and a vagabond, that's what he is, in English.”
“It's all the same to me what he is or what he is not,
whether in English or whether in French,” retorted Mr.
E. W. B. Childers, facing about. “I am telling your
friend what's the fact; if you don't like to hear it, you
can avail yourself of the open air. You give it mouth
enough, you do; but give it mouth in your own build-
ing at least,” remonstrated E. W. B. with stern irony.
“Don't give it mouth in this building, till you're called
upon. You have got some building of your own, I dare
say, now?”.
Perhaps so,” replied Mr. Bounderby, rattling his
money and laughing.
“Then give it mouth in your own building, will you,
if you please?” said Childers. “Because this isn't a

strong building, and too much of you might bring it
down!”
Eyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again, he
turned from him, as from a man finally disposed of, to
Mr. Gradgrind.
“Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour
ago, and then was seen to slip out himself, with his hat
over his eyes and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief
under his arm. She will never believe it of him, but he
has cut away and left her.”
“Pray,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “why will she never be-
lieve it of him?"
“Because those two were one. Because they were
never asunder. Because, up to this time, he seemed to
dote upon her,” said Childers, taking a step or two to
look into the empty trunk. Both Mr. Childers and
Master Kidderminster walked in a curious manner;
with their legs wider apart than the general run
of men, and with a very knowing assumption of being
stiff in the knees. This walk was common to all
the male members of Sleary's company, and was
understood to express that they were always on horse-
back.
“Poor Sissy! He had better have apprenticed her,”
said Childers, giving his hair another shake, as he
looked up from the empty box. “Now, he leaves her
without anything to take to.”
“It is creditable to you, who have never been ap-
prenticed, to express that opinion,” returned Mr. Grad-
grind, approvingly.
“I never apprenticed? I was apprenticed when I was
seven year old.”
“Oh! Indeed?” said Mr. Gradgrind, rather resent-
fully, as having been defrauded of his good opinion. “I
was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice
young persons to—”
“Idleness,” Mr. Bounderby put in, with a loud laugh.
“No, by the Lord Harry! Nor I!”
“Her father always had it in his head,” resumed
Childers, feigning unconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby's
existence, “that she was to be taught the deuce-and-all
of education. How it got into his head, I can't say; I
can only say that it never got out. He has been picking
up a bit of reading for her, here--and a bit of writing

oe had we deserechool punch. not statsu
for her, there—and a bit of ciphering for her, some-
where else—these seven years.”
Mr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of
his pockets, stroked his face and chin, and looked, with
a good deal of doubt and a little hope, at Mr. Gradgrind.
From the first he had sought to conciliate that gentle-
man, for the sake of the deserted girl.
“When Sissy got into the school here,” he pursued,
“her father was as pleased as Punch. I couldn't
altogether make out why, myself, as we were not station-
ary here, being but comers and goers anywhere. I sup-
pose, however, he had this move in his mind-he was
always half-cracked-and then considered her provided
for. If you should happen to have looked in to-night,
for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do
her any little service,” said Mr. Childers, stroking his
face again, and repeating his look, “it would be very
fortunate and well-timed; very fortunate and well-
timed.”
“On the contrary,” returned Mr. Gradgrind, “I came
to tell him that her connexions made her not an object
for the school, and that she must not attend any more.
Still, if her father really has left her, without any con-
nivance on her part-Bounderby, let me have a word
with you.”
Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with
his equestrian walk, to the landing outside the door, and
there stood stroking his face and softly whistling.
While thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in Mr.
Bounderby's voice as, “No. I say no. I advise you not.
I say by no means." While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he
heard in his much lower tone the words, “But even as
an example to Louisa of what this pursuit, which has
been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends
in. Think of it, Bounderby, in that point of view.”
Meanwhile, the various members of Sleary's company
gradually gathered together from the upper regions,
where they were quartered, and, from standing about,
talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers,
gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.
There were two or three handsome young women among
them, with their two or three husbands, and their two or
three mothers, and their eight or nine little children,
who did the fairy business when required. The father

of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the
father of another of the families on the top of a great
pole; the father of a third family often made a pyramid
of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for
the apex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could
dance upon rolling casks, stand upon bottles, catch
knives and balls, twirl hand-basins, ride upon anything,
jump over everything, and stick at nothing. All the
mothers could (and did) dance upon the slack wire and
the tight rope, and perform rapid acts on bare-backed
steeds; none of them were at all particular in respect of
showing their legs; and one of them, alone in a Greek
chariot, drove six in hand into every town they came
to. They all assumed to be mighty rakish and know-
ing, they were not very tidy in their private dresses,
they were not at all orderly in their domestic arrange-
ments, and the combined literature of the whole com-
pany would have produced but a poor letter on any
subject. Yet there was a remarkable gentleness and
childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for
any kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to
help and pity one another, deserving, often of as much
respect, and always of as much generous construction,
as the every-day virtues of any class of people in the
world.
Last of all appeared Mr. Sleary: a stout man, as
already mentioned, with one fixed eye and one loose
eye, a voice (if it can be called so) like the efforts of a
broken old pair of bellows, a flabby surface, and a mud-
dled head which was never sober and never drunk.
- Thquire!” said Mr. Sleary, who was troubled with
asthma, and whose breath came far too thick and heavy
for the letter s, “ your thervant! Thith ith a bad piethe
of bithnith, thith ith. You've heard of my Clown and
hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed?”
He addressed Mr. Gradgrind, who answered, “Yes.”
“Well Thquire,” he returned, taking off his hat, and
rubbing the lining with his pocket-handkerchief, which
he kept inside for the purpose. “Ith it your intention
to do anything for the poor girl, Thquire?”
“I shall have something to propose to her when she
comes back,” said Mr. Gradgrind.
“Glad to hear it, Thquire. Not that I want to get rid
of the child, any more than I want to thtand in her way.

I'm willing to take her prentith, though at her age ith

been chilled and heated, heated and chilled, chilled and
heated in the ring when you wath young, ath often ath
I have been, your voithe would'nt have lathted out,
Thquire, no more than mine.”
“I dare say not,” said Gradgrind.
“What thall it be, Thquire, while you wait? Thall it
be therry? Give it a name, Thquire!” said Mr. Sleary,
with hospitable ease.
“Nothing for me, I thank you,” said Mr. Gradgrind.
“Don't thay nothing, Thquire. What doth your
friend thay? If you haven't took your feed yet, have a
glath of bitterth.”
Here his daughter Josephine-a pretty fair-haired
girl of eighteen, who had been tied on a horse at two
years old, and had made a will at twelve, which she
always carried about with her, expressive of her dying
desire to be drawn to the grave by the two piebald
ponies—cried, “Father, hush! she has come back!”
Then came Sissy Jupe, running into the room as she
had run out of it. And when she saw them all as-
sembled, and saw their looks, and saw no father there,
she broke into a most deplorable cry, and took refuge
on the bosom of the most accomplished tight-rope lady
(herself in the family-way), who knelt down on the floor
to nurse her and to weep over her.
“Ith an infernal thame, upon my thoul it ith,” said
Sleary,
“Oh, my dear father, my good kind father, where are
you gone? You are gone to try to do me some good, I
know! You are gone away for my sake, I am sure.
And how miserable and helpless you will be without me,
poor, poor father, until you come back!" It was so
pathetic to hear her saying many things of this kind,
with her face turned upward, and her arms stretched
out as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow
and embrace it, that no one spoke a word until Mr.
Bounderby (growing impatient) took the case in hand.
“Now, good people all,” said he, “this is wanton waste
of time. Let the girl understand the fact. Let her take
it from me, if you like, who have been run away from,
myself. Here, what's your name! Your father has

absconded-deserted you--and you mustn't expect to
see him again as long as you live.”
They cared so little for plain Fact, these people, and
were in that advanced state of degeneracy on the sub-
ject, that instead of being impressed by the speaker's
strong common-sense, they took it in extraordinary
dudgeon. The men muttered “Shame!" and the women
" Brute!” and Sleary, in some haste, communicated the
following hint, apart, to Mr. Bounderby:
“I tell you what, Thquire. To thpeake plain to you,
my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort, and drop
it. They're a very good natur'd people, my people, but
they're accuthtomed to be quick in their movementh;
and if you don't act upon my advithe, I'm damned if I
don't believe they'll pith you out o' winder.”
Mr. Bounderby being restrained by this mild sugges-
tion, Mr. Gradgrind found an opening for his eminently
practical exposition of the subject.
“It is of no moment,” said he, “whether this person
is to be expected back at any time, or the contrary. He
is gone away, and there is no present expectation of his
return. That, I believe, is agreed on all hands."
“ Thath agreed, Thquire. Thick to that!” From
Sleary.
“Well, then, I, who came here to inform the father
of the poor girl, Jupe, that she could not be received at
the school any more, in consequence of their being prac-
tical objections, into which I need not enter, to the re-
ception there of the children of persons so employed, am
prepared in these altered circumstances to make a pro-
posal. I am willing to take charge of you, Jupe, and to
educate you, and provide for you. The only condition
(over and above your good behaviour) I make is, that
you decide now, at once, whether to accompany me or
remain here. Also, that if you accompany me now, it
is understood that you communicate no more with any
of your friends who are here present. These observa-
tions comprise the whole of the case.”
“At thé thame time,” said Sleary, “I mutht put in
my word, Thquire, tho that both thides of the banner
may be equally theen. If you like, Thethilia, to be pren-
titht, you know the natur 'of the work and you know
your companionth. Emma Gordon, in whothe lap you
are lying at prethent, would be a mother to you, and

Joth'phine would be a thithter to you. I don't pretend
to be of the angel breed myself, and I don't thay but
what when you mith'd your tip, you'd find me cut up
rough, and thwear a oath or two at you. But what I
thay, Thquire, ith, that good tempered or bad tempered,
I never did a horthe a injury yet, no more than thwear-
ing at him went, and that I don't expect I thall begin
otherwithe at my time of life, with a rider. I never
wath much of a Cackler, Thquire, and I have thed my
thay.”.
The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr.
Gradgrind, who received it with a grave inclination of
his head, and then remarked:
“The only observation I will make to you, Jupe, in
the way of influencing your decision, is, that it is highly
desirable to have a sound practical education, and
that even your father himself (from what I under-
stand) appears, on your behalf, to have known and felt
that much.”
The last words had a visible effect upon her. She
stopped in her wild crying, a little detached herself from
Emma Gordon, and turned her face full upon her patron.
The whole company perceived the force of the change,
and drew a long breath together, that plainly said, “She
will go!"
“Be sure you know your own mind, Jupe,” Mr.
Gradgrind cautioned her; “I say no more. Be sure you
know your own mind!”
“When father comes back," cried the girl, bursting
into tears again after a moment's silence, “how will he
ever find me if I go away!”
“ You may be quite at ease,” said Mr. Gradgrind,
calmly; he worked out the whole matter like a sum:
“you may be quite at ease, Jupe, on that score. In such
a case, your father, I apprehend, must find out Mr. —”
“ Thleary. Thath my name, Thquire. Not athamed
of it. Known all over England, and alwayth paythe
ith way.”
“Must find out Mr. Sleary, who would then let him
know where you went. I should have no power of keep-
ing you against his wish, and he would have no difficulty
at any time in finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coke-
town. I am well known.”
- Well known,” assented Mr. Sleary, rolling his loose

prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe. But never
mind that at prethent.”
There was another silence, and then she exclaimed,
sobbing with her hands before her face, “Oh, give me
my clothes, give me my clothes, and let me go away
before I break my heart!”
The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the
clothes together-it was soon done, for they were not
many-and to pack them in a basket which had often
travelled with them. Sissy sat all the time upon the
ground, still sobbing and covering her eyes. Mr. Grad-
grind and his friend Bounderby stood near the door,
ready to take her away. Mr. Sleary stood in the middle
of the room with the male members of the company
about him, exactly as he would have stood in the centre
of the ring during his daughter Josephine's performance.
He wanted nothing but his whip.
The basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet
to her, and smoothed her disordered hair, and put in on.
Then they pressed about her, and bent over her in very
natural attitudes, kissing and embracing her; and
brought the children to take leave of her; and were a
tender-hearted, simple, foolish set of women alto-
gether.
“Now, Jupe,” said Mr. Gradgrind. “If you are quite
determined, come!”
But she had to take her farewell of the male part of
the company yet, and every one of them had to unfold
his arms (for they all assumed the professional attitude
when they found themselves near Šleary), and give her
a parting kiss-Master Kidderminster excepted, in
whose young nature there was an original flavor of the
misanthrope, who was also known to have harboured
matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew. Mr.
Sleary was reserved until the last. Opening his arms
wide he took her by both her hands, and would have
sprung her up and down, after the riding-master manner
of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from
a rapid act; but there was no rebound in Sissy, and she
only stood before him crying.
“Good-bye, my dear!” said Sleary. “You'll make
your fortun, I hope, and none of our poor folkth will
ever trouble you, I'll pound it, I with your father hadn't

the dog out of the billth. But, on thecond thought, he
wouldn't have performed without hith mathter, tho ith
ath broad ath ith long!”
With that he regarded her attentively with his fixed
eye, surveyed his company with his loose one, kissed
her, shook his head, and handed her to Mr. Gradgrind
as to a horse.
“There the ith, Thquire,” he said, sweeping her with
a professional glance as if she were being adjusted in
her seat, “and the'll do you juthtithe. Good-bye,
Thethilia!"
" Good-bye, Cecilia!” “Good-bye, Sissy!” “God bless
you, dear!" In a variety of voices from all the room.
But the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of
the nine oils in her bosom, and he now interposed with:
“Leave the bottle, my dear; ith large to carry; it will
be of no uthe to you now. Give it to me!"
“No, no!” she said, in another burst of tears. “Oh,
no! Pray let me keep it for father till he comes back!
He will want it when he comes back. He had never
thought of going away, when he sent me for it. I must
keep it for him, if you please!”
"Tho be it, my dear. (You thee how it ith, Thquire!)
Farewell, Thethilia! My latht wordth to you ith thith,
thtick to the termth of your engagement, be obedient
to the Thquire, and forget uth. But if, when you're
grown up and married and well off, you come upon any
horthe-riding ever, don't be hard upon it, don't be croth
with it, give it a Bethpeak if you can, and think you
might do wurth. People must be amuthed, Thquire,

ever, by so much talking; "they can't be alwayth a
working, nor yet they can't be alwayth a learning.
Make the betht of uth; not the wurtht. I've got my liv-
ing out of the horthe-riding all my life, I know; but I
conthider that I lay down the philothophy of the thub-
ject when I thay to you, Thquire, make the betht of uth;
not the wurtht!"
The Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went
down-stairs; and the fixed eye of Philosophy-and its
rolling eye too-soon lost the three figures and the bas-
ket in the darkness of the street,

CHAPTER VII.
MRS. SPARSIT.
MR. BOUNDERBY being a bachelor, an elderly lady
presided over his establishment, in consideration of a
certain annual stipend. Mrs. Sparsit was this lady's
name; and she was a prominent figure in attendance on
Mr. Bounderby's car, as it rolled along in triumph with
the Bully of humility inside.
For, Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days,
but was highly connected. She had a great aunt living
in these very times called Lady Scadgers. Mr. Sparsit,
deceased, of whom she was the relict, had been by the
mother's side what Mrs. Sparsit still called “a Pow-
ler.” Strangers of limited information and dull appre-
hension were sometimes observed not to know what a
Powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it
might be a business, or a political party, or a profession
of faith. The better class of minds, however, did not
need to be informed that the Powlers were an ancient
stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly far
back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost
themselves—which they had rather frequently done, as
respected horse-flesh, blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary
transactions, and the Insolvent Debtors Court.
The late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother's side a
Powler, married this lady, being by the father's side a
Scadgers. Lady Scadgers (an immensely fat old woman,
with an inordinate appetite for butcher's meat, and a
mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed
for fourteen years) contrived the marriage, at a period
when Sparsit was just of age, and chiefly noticeable for
a slender body, weakly supported on two long slim
props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning.
He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle, but owed it
all before he came into it, and spent it twice over imme-
diately afterwards. Thus, when he died, at twenty-four
(the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause brandy),
he did not leave his widow, from whom he had been
separated soon after the honeymoon, in affluent circum-

stances. That bereaved lady, fifteen years older than he,
fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative, Lady
Scadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly
to maintain herself, went out at a salary. And here
she was now, in her elderly days, with the Coriolanian
style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had
captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby's tea as he
took his breakfast.
If Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit
a captive Princess whom he took about as a feature in
his state processions, he could not have made a greater
flourish with her than he habitually did. Just as it be-
longed to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extrac-
tion, so it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit's. In the
measure that he would not allow his own youth to have
been attended by a single favourable circumstance, lie
brightened Mrs. Sparsit's juvenile career with every
possible advantage, and showered wagon-loads of early
roses all over that lady's path. “And yet, sir,” he would
say, “how does it turn out after all? Why, here she is
at a hundred a year (I give her a hundred, which she is
pleased to term handsome), keeping the house of Josiah
Bounderby of Coketown!”
Nay, he made this foil of his so very widely known
that third parties took it up, and handled it on some oc-
casions with considerable briskness. It was one of the
most exasperating attributes of Bounderby that he not
only sang his own praises but stimulated other men to
sing them. There was a moral infection of clap-trap
in him. Strangers, modest enough elsewhere, started
up at dinners in Coketown, and boasted, in quite a ram-
pant way, of Bounderby. They made him out to be the
Royal arms, the Union Jack, Magna Charta, John Bull,
Habeas Corpus, the Bill of Rights. An Englishman's
house is his castle, Church and State, and God save the
Queen, all put together. And as often (and it was very
often) as an orator of this kind brought into his per-
oration,
Princes and Lords may flourish or may fade,
A breath can make them, as a breath has made,"
-it was, for certain, more or less understood among
the company that he had heard of Mrs. Sparsit.

“Mr. Bounderby,” said Mrs. Sparsit, “ you are un-
usually slow, sir, with your breakfast this morning.”
" Why, ma'am,” he returned, “I am thinking about
Tom Gradgrind's whim;" Tom Gradgrind, for a bluff,
independent manner of speaking—as if somebody were
always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums
to say Thomas, and he wouldn't; “Tom Gradgrind's
whim, ma’am, of bringing up the tumbling-girl.”
“The girl is now waiting to know," said Mrs. Sparsit,
“ whether she is to go straight to the school, or up to the
Lodge."
“She must wait, ma'am," answered Bounderby, “ till
I know myself. We shall have Tom Gradgrind down
here presently, I suppose. If he should wish her to re-
main here a day or two longer, of course she can,
ma'am.”
“Of course she can, if you wish it, Mr. Bounderby.”
“I told him I would give her a shake-down here,
last night, in order that he might sleep on it before
he decided to let her have any association with
Louisa.”
“Indeed, Mr. Bounderby? Very thoughtful of you!!!
Mrs. Sparsit's Coriolanian nose underwent a slight ex-
pansion of the nostrils, and her black eyebrows con-
tracted as she took a sip of tea.
“It's tolerably clear to me,” said Bounderby, “that
the little puss can get small good out of such companion-
ship.”
“* Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind, Mr.
Bounderby?”
“ Yes, ma’am, I am speaking of Louisa.”
“Your observation being limited to little puss,'” said
Mrs. Sparsit, "and there being two little girls in ques-
tion, I did not know which might be indicated by that ex-
pression.”
“Louisa,” repeated Mr. Bounderby. “Louisa, Louisa.”
“You are quite another father to Louisa, sir.” Mrs.
Sparsit took a little more tea; and, as she bent her again
contracted eyebrows over her steaming cup, rather
looked as if her classical countenance were invoking the
infernal gods.
“If you had said I was another father to Tom-young
Tom, I mean, not my friend Tom Gradgrind—you might
have been nearer the mark. I am going to take young

Tom into my office. Going to have him under my wing,
ma'am.”
“Indeed? Rather young for that, is he not, sir?” Mrs.
Sparsit's “sir,” in addressing Mr. Bounderby, was a
word of ceremony, rather exacting consideration for
herself in the use, than honouring him.
“I'm not going to take him at once; he is to finish his
educational cramming before then," said Bounderby.
“By the Lord Harry, he'll have enough of it, first and
last! He'd open his eyes, that boy would, if he knew
how empty of learning my young maw was, at his time
of life.” Which, by-the-bye, he probably did know, for
he had heard of it often enough. “But it's extraor-
dinary the difficulty I have on scores of such subjects,
in speaking to any one on equal terms. Here, for ex-
ample, I have been speaking to you this morning about
tumblers. Why, what do you know about tumblers?
At the time when, to have been a tumbler in the mud
of the streets, would have been a godsend to me, a prize
in the lottery to me, you were at the Italian Opera.
You were coming out of the Italian Opera, ma'am, in
white satin and jewels, a blaze of splendour, when I
hadn't a penny to buy a link to light you."
“I certainly, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a dignity
serenely mournful, “was familiar with the Italian Opera
at a very early age.”
“Egad, ma'am, so was I,” said Bounderby, “_with
the wrong side of it. A hard bed the pavement of its
Arcade used to make, I assure you. People like you,
ma'am, accustomed from infancy to lie on Down
feathers, have no idea how hard a paving-stone is, with-
out trying it. No, no, it's of no use my talking to
you about tumblers. I should speak of foreign dancers,
and the West End of London, and May Fair, and lords
and ladies and honourables.”'
“I trust, sir," rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, with decent
resignation, “it is not necessary that you should do
anything of that kind. I hope I have learnt to accom-
modate myself to the changes of life. If I have acquired
an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences,
and can scarcely hear enough of them, I claim no merit
for that, since I believe it is a general sentiment.”
“Well, ma'am,” said her patron, “perhaps some
people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear, in

his own unpolished way, that Josiah Bounderby of Coke-
town, has gone through. But you must confess that
you were born in the lap of luxury, yourself. Come,
ma'am, you know you were born in the lap of luxury.”
“I do not, sir,” returned Mrs. Sparsit with a shake of
her head, “ deny it.”
Mr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from the table,
and stand with his back to the fire, looking at her; she
was such an enhancement of his position.
“ And you were in crack society. Devilish high so-
ciety,” he said, warming his legs.
“It is true, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, with an affecta-
tion of humility the very opposite of his, and therefore
in no danger of jostling it.
“You were in the tiptop fashion and all the rest of
it,” said Mr. Bounderby
“ Yes, sir,” returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of social
widowhood upon her. “It is unquestionably true.”
Mr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally
embraced his legs in his great satisfaction and laughed
aloud. Mr. and Miss Gradgrind being then announced,
he received the former with a shake of the hand, and
the latter with a kiss.
“Can Jupe be sent here, Bounderby?” asked Mr.
Gradgrind.
Certainly. So Jupe was sent there. On coming in,
she curtseyed to Mr. Bounderby and to his friend
Tom Gradgrind, and also to Louisa; but in her confu-
sion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit. Observing this,
the blustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to
make:
“Now, I tell you what, my girl. The name of that
lady by the teapot, is Mrs. Sparsit. That lady acts as
mistress of this house, and she is a highly connected
lady. Consequently, if ever you come again into any
room in this house, you will make a short stay in it if
you don't behave towards that lady in your most re-
pectful manner. Now, I don't care a button what you
do to me, because I don't affect to be anybody. So far
from having high connections I have no connections at
all, and I come of the scum of the earth. But towards
that lady, I do care what you do; and you shall do
what is deferential and respectful, or you shall not come
here."

“I hope, Bounderby,” said Mr. Gradgrind in à con-
ciliatory voice, “that this was merely an oversight.”
“My friend, Tom Gradgrind, suggests, Mrs. Sparsit,”
said Bounderby, “that this was merely an oversight.
Very likely. However, as you are aware, ma'am, I
don't allow of even oversights towards you."
“You are very good indeed, sir,” returned Mrs. Spar-
sit, shaking her head with her state humility. “It is
not worth speaking of.”
Sissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing her-
self with tears in her eyes, was now waved over by the
master of the house to Mr. Gradgrind. She stood, look-
ing intently at him, and Louisa stood coldly by, with her
eyes upon the ground while he proceeded thus:
"Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my
house; and when you are not in attendance at the school,
to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind, who is rather an
invalid. I have explained to Miss Louisa—this is Miss
Louisa—the miserable but natural end of your late
career; and you are to expressly understand that the
whole career of that subject is past, and is not to be re-
ferred to any more. From this time you begin your
history. You are at present ignorant, I know.”
“Yes, sir, very,” she answered, curtseying.
“I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be
strictly educated; and you will be a living proof to all
who come into communication with you, of the advan-
tages of the training you will receive. You will be re-
claimed and formed. You have been in the habit now
of reading to your father, and those people I found you
among, I dare say?" said Mr. Gradgrind, beckoning
her nearer to him before he said so, and dropping his
voice,
“ Only to father and Merrylegs, sir. At least I mean
to father, when Merrylegs was always there.”
“Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe," said Mr. Gradgrind,
with a passing frown. "I don't ask about him. I un-
derstand you to have been in the habit of reading to
your father?”
“Oh, yes, sir, thousands of times. They were the hap-
piest-oh, of all the happy times we had together,
sir!"
It was only now when her sorrow broke out that Louisa
looked at her.

"And what," asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower
voice, “ did you read to your father, Jupe?”
“ About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the
Hunchback, and the Genies,” she sobbed out; “and
about,”
“Hush!” said Mr. Gradgrind, “that is enough. Never
breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more.
Bounderby, this is a case for rigid training, and I shall
observe it with interest.”.
“Well,” returned Mr. Bounderby, “I have given you
my opinion already, and I shouldn't do as you do. But,
very well, verv well. Since you are bent upon it, very
well!”
So Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe
off with them to Stone Lodge, and on the way Louisa
never spoke one word, good or bad. And Mr. Boun-
derby went about his daily pursuits. And Mrs. Sparsit
got behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of
that retreat all the evening.
CHAPTER VIII.
NEVER WONDER.
LET us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the
tune.
When she was half-a-dozen years younger, Louisa had
been overheard to begin a conversation with her brother
one day, by saying, “ Tom, I wonder”–upon which Mr.
Gradgrind, who was the person overhearing, stepped
forth into the light, and said, “Louisa, never wonder!"
Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mys-
tery of educating the reason without stooping to the cul-
tivation of the sentiments and affections. Never wonder.
By means of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division, settle everything somehow, and never wonder.
Bring to me, says M’Choakumchild, yonder baby just
able to walk, and I will engage that it shall never
wonder.
Now, besides very many babies just able to walk,
there happened to be in Coketown a considerable popu-
lation of babies who had been walking against time

towards the infinite world, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty
years and more. These portentous infants being alarm:
ing creatures to talk about in any human society, the
eighteen denominations incessantly scratched one an-
other's face and pulled one another's hair by way of
agreeing on the steps to be taken for their improvement-
which they never did; a surprising circumstance, when
the happy adaptation of the means to the end is consid-
ered. Still, although they differed in every other particu-
lar, conceivable and inconceivable (especially inconceiv-
able), they were pretty well united on the point that
these unlucky infants were never to wonder. Body
number one said they must take everything on trust.
Body number two said they must take everything on po-
litical economy. Body number three wrote leaden little
books for them, showing how the good grown-up baby
invariably got to the Savings-bank, and the bad grown-
up baby invariably got transported. Body number four,
under dreary pretences of being droll (when it was very
melancholy indeed), made the shallowest pretences of
concealing pitfalls of knowledge, into which it was the
duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled. But
all the bodies agreed that they were never to wonder.
There was a library in Coketown to which general
access was easy. Mr. Gradgrind greatly tormented his
mind about what the people read in this library: a point
whereon little rivers of tabular statements periodically
flowed into the howling ocean of tabular statements,
which no diver ever got to any depth in and came up
sane. It was a disheartening circumstance, but a mel-
ancholy fact, that even these readers persisted in won-
dering. They wondered about human nature, human
passions, human hopes and fears, the struggles, triumphs
and defeats, the cares and joys and sorrows, the lives
and deaths, of common men and women! They some-
times, after fifteen hours' work, sat down to read mere
fables about men and women, more or less like them-
selves, and about children, more or less like their own.
They took De Foe to their bosoms, instead of Euclid, and
seemed to be on the whole more comforted by Gold-
smith than by Cocker. Mr. Gradgrind was forever
working, in print and out of print, at this eccentric sum,
and he never could make out how it yielded this unac
countable product.

“I am sick of my life, Loo. I hate it altogether, and
I hate everybody except you,” said the unnatural young
Thomas Gradgrind in the hair-cutting chamber at twi-
light.
“You don't hate Sissy, Tom?"
“I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe. And she hates
me," said Tom moodily.
“No, she does not, Tom, Lam sure."
“She must,” said Tom. “She must just hate and detest
the whole set-out of us. They'll bother her head off, I
think, before they have done with her. Already she's
getting as pale as wax, and as heavy as I am.”
Young Thomas expressed these sentiments sitting
astride of a chair before the fire, with his arms on the
back, and his sulky face on his arms. His sister sat in
the darker corner by the fireside, now looking at him,
now looking at the bright sparks as they dropped upon
the hearth.
“ As to me," said Tom, tumbling his hair all manner
of ways with his sulky hands, “I am a donkey, that's
what I am. I am as obstinate as one, I am more stupid
than one, I get as much pleasure as one, and I should
like to kick like one.”
“Not me, I hope, Tom?"
“No, Loo; I wouldn't hurt you. I made an exception
of you at first. I don't know what this-jolly old-
Jaundiced Jail”—Tom had paused to find a sufficiently
complimentary and expressive name for the parental
roof, and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment, by
the strong alliteration of this one-" would be without
you."
“Indeed, Tom? Do you really and truly say so?”
“Why, of course I do. What's the use of talking
about it!” returned Tom, chafing his face on his coat-
sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison
with his spirit.
“Because, Tom,” said his sister, after silently watch-
ing the sparks awhile, “ as I get older and nearer grow-
ing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how un-
fortunate it is for me that I can't reconcile you to
home better than I am able to do. I don't know what
other girls know. I can't play to you, or sing to you.
I can't talk to you so as to lighten your mind, for I

books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to
talk about when you are tired.”
“Well, no more do I. I am as bad as you in that
respect; and I am a Mule too, which you're not. If
father was determined to make me either a Prig or a
Mule, and I am not a Prig, why, it stands to reason, I
must be a Mule. And so I am,” said Tom, desperately.
“It's a great pity,” said Louisa, after another pause,
and speaking thoughtfully out of her dark corner; “it's
a great pity, Tom. It's very unfortunate for both of us."
- Oh! You,” said Tom; “you are a girl, Loo, and a
girl comes out of it better than a boy does. I don't miss
anything in you. You are the only pleasure I have-
you can brighten even this place—and you can always
lead me as you like.”
. “You are a dear brother, Tom; and while you think I
can do such things, I don't so much mind knowing
better. Though I do know better, Tom, and am very
sorry for it.” She came and kissed him, and went back
into her corner again.
“I wish I could collect all the Facts we hear so much
about,” said Tom, spitefully setting his teeth, “and all
the Figures, and all the people who found them out;
and I wish I could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder
under them, and blow them all up together! However,
when I go to live with old Bounderby, I'll have my
revenge.”
“Your revenge, Tom!"
“I mean, I'll enjoy myself a little, and go about and
see something, and hear something. I'll recompense
myself for the way in which I have been brought up."
. “But don't disappoint yourself beforehand, Tom. Mr.
Bounderby thinks as father thinks, and is a great deal
rougher, and not half so kind.”
“Oh," said Tom, laughing; “I don't mind that. I
shall very well know how to manage and smoothe, old
Bounderby!”
Their shadows were defined upon the wall, but those
of the high presses in the room were all blended together
on the wall and on the ceiling, as if the brother and
sister were overhung by a dark cavern. Or, a fanciful
imagination-if such treason could have been there-
might have made it out to be the shadow of their
subject, and of its lowering association with their future.

“What is your great mode of smoothing and manag-
ing, Tom? Is it a secret?"
*Oh!" said Tom, “if it is a secret it's not far off. It's
you. You are his little pet, you are his favourite; he'll
do anything for you. When he says to me what I don't
like I shall say to him, “My sister Loo will be hurt and
disappointed, Mr. Bounderby. She always used to tell
me she was sure you would be easier with me than this.'
That'll bring him about, or nothing will.”
After waiting for some answering remark and getting
none, Tom wearily relapsed into the present time, and
twined himself yawning round and about the rails of
his chair, and rumpled his head more and more, until
he suddenly looked up and asked:
“Have you gone to sleep, Loo?”.
“No, Tom. I am looking at the fire.”
“You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I
could find,” said Tom. “Another of the advantages, I
suppose, of being a girl.”
“Tom,” enquired his sister slowly, and in a curious
tone, as if she were reading what she asked in the fire,
and it were not quite plainly written there, “ do you
look forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr.
Bounderby's?”
“Why, there's one thing to be said of it,” returned
Tom, pushing his chair from him and standing up; “ it
will be getting away from home.”
“There is one thing to be said of it,” Louisa repeated
in her former curious tone; “it will be getting away
from home. Yes."
“Not but what I shall be very unwilling both to leave
you, Loo, and to leave you here. But I must go, you
know, whether I like it or not; and I had better go where
I can take with me some advantage of your influence,
than where I should lose it altogether. Don't you see?”
“Yes, Tom.”
The answer was so long in coming, though there was
no indecision in it, that Tom went and leaned on the
back of her chair to contemplate the fire which so en-
grossed her, from her point of view, and see what he
could make of it.
“Except that it is a fire,” said Tom, “it looks to me
as stupid and blank as everything else looks. What do
you see in it? Not a circus?"

“I don't see anything in it, Tom, particularly. But
since I have been looking at it I have been wondering
about you and me, grown up.”
“Wondering again!” said Tom.
“I have such unmanageable thoughts,” returned his
sister, “that they will wonder.”
“ Then I beg of you, Louisa,” said Mrs. Gradgrind,
who had opened the door without being heard, “to do
nothing of that description, for goodness' sake, you in-
considerate girl, or I shall never hear the last of it from
your father. And, Thomas, it is really shameful, with
my poor head continually wearing me out, that a boy
brought up as you have been, and whose education has
cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his
sister to wonder, when he knows his father has ex-'
pressly said that she is not to do it.”
Louisa denied Tom's participation in the offence; but
her mother stopped her with the conclusive answer,
“ Louisa, don't tell me, in my state of health; for, unless
you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically
impossible that you could have done it.”
“I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking
at the red sparks dropping out of the fire, and whitening
and dying. It made me think, after all, how short my
life would be, and how little I could hope to do in it.”
“Nonsense!” said Mrs. Gradgrind, rendered almost
energetic. “Nonsense! Don't stand there and tell me
such stuff, Louisa, to my face, when you know very well
that if it was ever to reach your father's ears I should
never hear the last of it. After all the trouble that has
been taken with you! After the lectures you have
attended, and the experiments you have seen! After I
have heard you myself, when the whole of my right side
has been benumbed, going on with your master about
combustion, and calcination, and calorification, and I
may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor in-
valid distracted, to hear you talking in this absurd way
about sparks and ashes! I wish,” whimpered Mrs. Grad-
grind, taking a chair, and discharging her strongest
point before succumbing under these mere shadows of
facts, “yes, I really do wish that I had never had a
family, and then you would have known what it was to
do without me!”

CHAPTER IX.
SISSY'S PROGRESS.
Sissy JUPE had not an easy time of it, between Mr.
M’Choakumchild and Mrs. Gradgrind, and was not with-
out strong impulses, in the first months of her probation,
to run away. It hailed facts all day long so very hard,
and life in general was opened to her as such a closely
ruled ciphering-book, that assuredly she would have run
away, but for only one restraint.
It is lamentable to think of; but this restraint was the
‘result of no arithmetical process, was self-imposed in
defiance of all calculation, and went dead against any
table of probabilities that any Actuary would have
drawn up from the premises. The girl believed that her
father had not deserted her; she lived in the hope that
he would come back, and in the faith that he would be
made happier by her remaining where she was.
The wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to
this consolation, rejecting the superior comfort of know-
ing, on a sound arithmetical basis, that her father was
an unnatural vagabond, filled Mr. Gradgrind with pity.
Yet, what was to be done? M'Choakumchild reported
that she had a very dense head for figures; that, once
possessed with a general idea of the globe, she took the
smallest conceivable interest in its exact measurements;
that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates,
unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected
therewith; that she would burst into tears on being re-
quired (by the mental process) immediately to name the
cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps at
fourteenpence halfpenny; that she was as low down in
the school as low could be; that after eight weeks of in-
duction into the elements of Political Economy, she
had only yesterday been set right by a prattler three
feet high, for returning to the question, "What is the
first principle of this science?” the absurd answer, “ To
do unto others as I would that they should do unto me.”
Mr. Gradgrind observed, shaking his head, that all
this was very bad; that it showed the necessity of in-

finite grinding at the mill of knowledge, as per system,
schedule, blue book, report, and tabular statements A
to Z; and that Jupe “must be kept to it.” So Jupe was
kept to it, and became low-spirited, but no wiser.
" It would be a fine thing to be you, Miss Louisa!”
she said, one night, when Louisa had endeavoured to
make her perplexities for next day something clearer
to her.
“Do you think so?”
" I should know so much, Miss Louisa. All that is
difficult to me now, would be so easy then.”
“ You might not be the better for it, Sissy."
Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, “I should
not be the worse, Miss Louisa.” To which Miss Louisa
answered, “I don't know that.”
There had been so little communication between these
two-both because life at Stone Lodge went monoto-
nously round like a piece of machinery which discour-
aged human interference, and because of the prohibition
relative to Sissy's past career — that they were still
almost strangers. Sissy, with her dark eyes wonder-
ingly directed to Louisa's face, was uncertain whether
to say more or remain silent.
“You are more useful to my mother, and more pleas-
ant with her than I can ever be,” Louisa resumed.
“ You are pleasanter to yourself than I am to my-
“But, if you please, Miss Louisa,” Sissy pleaded, “I
am-oh, so stupid!”
Louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she
would be wiser by-and-bye.
“You don't know,” said Sissy, half crying, “ what a
stupid girl I am. All through school hours I make
mistakes. Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild call me up,
over and over again, regularly to make mistakes. I
can't help them. They seem to come natural to me.”
“Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild never make any
mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?”
“Oh, no!" she eagerly returned. “They know every-
thing."
“ Tell me some of your mistakes.”
“I am almost ashamed,” said Sissy, with reluctance.
“But to-day, for instance, Mr. M'Choakumchild was

“National, I think it must have been,” observed
Louisa.
“Yes, it was.—But isn't it the same?” she timidly
asked.
“You had better say National, as he said so,” re-
turned Louisa, with her dry reserve.
“National Prosperity. And he said, Now, this school-
room is a Nation. And in this nation, there are fifty
millions of money. Isn't this a prosperous nation? Girl
number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a’n't
you in a thriving state?”
“What did you say?" asked Louisa.
“Miss Louisa, I said I didn't know. I thought I
couldn't know whether it was a prosperous nation or
not, and whether I was in a thriving state or not, unless
I knew who had got the money, and whether any of it
was mine. But that had nothing to do with it. It was
not in the figures at all,” said Sissy, wiping her eyes.
“That was a great mistake of yours,” observed Louisa.
“ Yes, Miss Louisa, I know it was, now. Then Mr.
M'Choakumchild said he would try me again. And he
said, This schoolroom is an immense town, and in it
there are a million of inhabitants, and only five-and-
twenty are starved to death in the streets in the course
of a year. What is your remark on that proportion?
And my remark was—for I could not think of a better
one—that I thought it must be just as hard upon those
who were starved, whether the others were a million,
or a million million. And that was wrong, too.”
“Of course it was.”
6. Then Mr. M'Choakumchild said he would try me
once more. And he said, Here are the stutterings”
“Statistics,” said Louisa.
“ Yes, Miss Louisa—they always remind me of stut-
terings, and that's another of my mistakes—of accidents
upon the sea. And I find (Mr. M'Choakumchild said)
that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to
sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were
drowned or burnt to death. What is the percentage?
And I said, miss;" here Sissy fairly sobbed as confessing
with extreme contrition to the greatest error; “I said it
was nothing.”
“Nothing, Sissy?”
“Nothing, miss-to the relations and friends of the

people who were killed. I shall never learn,” said Sissy.
* And the worst of all is, that although my poor father
wished me so much to learn, and although I am so
anxious to learn because he wished me to, I am afraid I
don't like it.”
Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it
drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to
glance at her face. Then she asked:
“Did your father know so much himself, that he
wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?”.
Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed
her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground,
that Louisa added, “No one hears us; and if any one
did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an inno-
cent question.”
“No, Miss Louisa,” answered Sissy, upon this en-
couragement, shaking her head; “father knows very
little indeed. It's as much as he can do to write; and
it's more than people in general can do to read his writ-
ing. Though it's plain to me.”
“Your mother?”
“Father says she was quite a scholar. She died when
I was born. She was;” Sissy made the terrible com-
munication nervously; “she was a dancer.”
“Did your father love her?” Louisa asked these ques-
tions with a strong, wild, wondering interest peculiar to
her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature,
and hiding in solitary places.
“Oh, yes! As dearly as he loves me. Father loved me,
first, for her sake. He carried me about with him when
I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from
that time.”
“Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?”
“Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I
do; nobody knows him as I do. When he left me for
my good-he never would have left me for his own-I
know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial. He
will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes
back.”
“ Tell me more about him,” said Louisa; “I will never
ask you again. Where did you live?”
“We travelled about the country, and had no fixed
place to live in. Father's a”-Sissy whispered the awful
word “a clown."

“ To make the people laugh?” said Louisa, with a nod
of intelligence.
“Yes. But they wouldn't laugh sometimes, and then
father cried. Lately, they very often wouldn't laugh,
and he used to come home despairing. Father's not like
most. Those who didn't know him as well as I do, and
didn't love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was
not quite right. Sometimes they played tricks upon
him; but they never knew how he felt them, and shrunk
up, when he was alone with me. He was far, far
timider than they thought!"
“And you were his comfort through everything?"
She nodded, with the tears rolling down her face. “I
hope so, and father said I was. It was because he grew
so scared and trembling, and because he felt himself to
be a poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to:
be his words), that he wanted me so much to know a
great deal, and be different from him. I used to read
to him to cheer his courage, and he was very fond of
that. They were wrong books-I am never to speak of
them here—but we didn't know there was any harm in
them.”
“ And he liked them ?” said Louisa, with her search-
ing gaze on Sissy all this time.
“Oh, very much! They kept him, many times, from
what did him real harm. And often and often of a night,
he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether
the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or
would have her head cut off before it was finished.”
“ And your father was always kind? To the last?"
asked Louisa; contravening the great principle, and
wondering very much.
“Always, always!" returned Sissy, clasping her
hands. “Kinder and kinder than I can tell. He was
angry only one night, and that was not to me, but
Merrylegs. Merrylegs;" she whispered the awful fact;
“is his performing dog.”.
“Why was he angry with the dog?” Louisa demanded.
“Father, soon after they came home from performing,
told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs
and stand across them—which is one of his tricks. He
looked at father, and didn't do it at once. Everything
of father's had gone wrong that night, and he hadn't
pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very

dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on
him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and
said, “Father, father! Pray don't hurt the creature who
is so fond of you! Oh, Heaven forgive you, father, stop!
And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay
down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and
the dog licked his face.”
Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her,
kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her.
“Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy.
Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end.
The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.”
“Dear Miss Louisa,” said Sissy, covering her eyes, and
sobbing yet; “I came home from the school that after-
noon, and found poor father just come home too, from
the booth. And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as
if he was in pain. And I said, Have you hurt yourself,
father?' (as he did sometimes, like they all did) and he
said, “A little, my darling.' And when I came to stoop
down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying.
The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and
at first he shook all over, and said nothing but' My dar-
ling,' and “My love!'”
Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two
with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in
anything but himself, and not much of that at present.
“I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,” observed
his sister. “You have no occasion to go away; but
don't interrupt us for a moment, Tom, dear.”
“Oh! very well!” returned Tom. “ Only father has
brought old Bounderby home, and I want you to come
into the drawing-room. Because if you come, there's a
good chance of old Bounderby's asking me to dinner;
and if you don't there's none."
6 I'll come directly.”
“ I'll wait for you," said Tom, “ to make sure.”
Sissy resumed in a lower voice. “At last poor father
said that he had given no satisfaction again, and never
lid give any satisfaction now, and that he was a shame
and disgrace, and I should have done better without him
all along. I said all the affectionate things that came into
my heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by
him, and told him all about the school and everything
that had been said and done there. When I had no

more left to tell, he put his arms round my neck, and
kissed me a great many times. Then he asked me to
fetch some of the stuff he used, for the little hurt he
had had, and to get it at the best place, which was at
the other end of town from there; and then, after kiss-
ing me again, he let me go. When I had gone down-
stairs, I turned back that I might be a little bit more
company to him yet, and looked in at the door, and said,
Father, dear, shall I take Merrylegs?" Father shook
his head and said, “No, Sissy, no; take nothing that's
known to be mine, my darling;' and I left him sitting
by the fire. Then the thought must have come upon
him, poor, poor father! of going away to try something
for my sake; for, when I came back, he was gone,”
“I say! Look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!” Tom
remonstrated.
“There's no more to tell, Miss Louisa. I keep the nine
oils ready for him, and I know he will come back.
Every letter that I see in Mr. Gradgrind's hand takes
my breath away and blinds my eyes, for I think it
comes from father, or from Mr. Sleary about father.
Mr. Sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should
be heard of, and I trust to him to keep his word.”
“Do look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!” said Tom,
with an impatient whistle. “He'll be off if you don't
look sharp!”
After this, whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr.
Gradgrind in the presence of his family, and said in
a faltering way, “I beg your pardon, sir, for being
troublesome-but-have you had any letter yet about
me?” Louisa would suspend the occupation of the
moment, whatever it was, and look for the reply as
earnestly as Sissy did. And when Mr. Gradgrind regu-
larly answered, “No, Jupe, nothing of the sort,” the
trembling of Sissy's lip would be repeated in Louisa's
face, and her eyes would follow Sissy with compassion
to the door. Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these
occasions by remarking, when she was gone, that if
Jupe had been properly trained from an early age she
would have demonstrated to herself on sound principles
the baselessness of these fantastic hopes. Yet it did
seem (though not to him, for he saw nothing of it) as if
fantastic hope could take as strong a hold as Fact.

daughter. As to Tom, he was becoming that not unpre-
cedented triumph of calculation which is usually at
work on number one. As to Mrs. Gradgrind, if she
said anything on the subject, she would come a little
way out of her wrappers, like a feminine dormouse,
and say:
“Good gracious, bless me, how my poor head is vexed
and worried by that girl Jupe's so perseveringly asking,
over and over again, about her tiresome letters! Upon
my word and honour I seem to be fated, and destined,
and ordained, to live in the midst of things that I am
never to hear the last of. It really is a most extraordi-
nary circumstance that it appears as if I never was to
near the last of anything!”
At about this point Mr. Gradgrind's eye would fall
upon her; and under the influence of that wintry piece
of fact she would become torpid again.

as a reason why I would give them a little more play.
In the hardest working part of Coketown; in the in-
nermost fortifications of that ugly citadel, where Nature
was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases
were bricked in; at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow
courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which
had come into existence piecemeal, every piece in a
violent hurry for some one man's purpose, and the whole
an unnatural family, shouldering, and trampling, and
pressing one another to death; in the last close nook of
this great exhausted receiver, where the chimneys, for
want of air to make a draught, were built in an im-
mense variety of stunted and crooked shapes, as though
every house put out a sign of the kind of people who
might be expected to be born in it; among the multi-
tude of Coketown, generically called “the Hands”-a
race who would have found more favour with some

people if Providence had seen fit to make them only
hands or, like the lower creatures of the sea-shore,
only hands and stomachs-lived a certain Stephen Black-
pool, forty years of age.
Stephen looked older, but he had had a hard life. It
it is said that every life has its roses and thorns; there
seemed, however, to have been a misadventure or mis-
take in Stephen's case, whereby somebody else had
become possessed of his roses, and he had become
possessed of the same somebody else's thorns in addition
to his own. He had known, to use his words, a peck of
trouble. He was usually called Old Stephen, in a kind
of rough homage to the fact.
A rather stooping man, with a knitted brow, a ponder-
ing expression of face, and a hard-looking head suffi-
ciently capacious, on which his iron-grey hair lay long
and thin, Old Stephen might have passed for a particu-
larly intelligent man in his condition. Yet he was not.
He took no place among those remarkable “Hands,”
who, piecing together their broken intervals of leisure
through many years, had mastered difficult sciences,
and acquired a knowledge of most unlikely things. He
held no station among the Hands who could make
speeches and carry on debates. Thousands of his com-
peers could talk much better than he, at any time. He
was a good power-loom weaver, and a man of perfect
integrity. What more he was, or what else he had in
him, if anything, let him show for himself.
The lights in the great factories, which looked, when
they were illuminated, like Fairy palaces-or the trav-
ellers by express-train said so—were all extinguished;
and the bells had rung for knocking off for the night,
and had ceased again; and the hands, men and women,
boy and girl, were clattering home. Old Stephen was
standing in the street, with the odd sensation upon him
which the stoppage of the machinery always produced
-the sensation of its having worked and stopped in his
own head.
“Yet I don't see Rachael, still!” said he.
It was a wet night, and many groups of young women
passed him with their shawls drawn over their bare
heads and held close under their chins to keep the rain
out. He knew Rachael well, for a glance at any one of
these groups was sufficient to show him that she was

not there. At last, there were no more to come; and
then he turned away, saying in a tone of disappoint-
ment, “Why, then, I ha'missed her!”
But he had not gone the length of three streets when
he saw another of the shawled figures in advance of
him, at which he looked so keenly that perhaps its mere
shadow indistinctly reflected on the wet pavement-if
he could have seen it without the figure itself moving
along from lamp to lamp, brightening and fading as it
went-would have been enough to tell him who was
there. Making his pace at once much quicker and
much softer, he darted on until he was very near
this figure, then fell into his former walk, and called
“Rachael!”
She turned, being then in the brightness of a lamp,
and raising her hood a little, showed a quiet, oval face,
dark and rather delicate, irradiated by a pair of very
gentle eyes, and further set off by the perfect order of
her shining black hair. It was not a face in its first
bloom; she was a woman five and thirty years of age.
“Ah, lad! 'Tis thou?" When she had said this, with
a smile which would have been quite expressed, though
nothing of her had been seen but her pleasant eyes,
she replaced her hood again, and they went on to-
gether.
“I thought thou wast ahind me, Rachael?”
6 No.”
“Early t'night, lass?”
66?Times I'm a little early, Stephen; 'times a little late.
I'm never to be counted on, going home.”
“Nor going t'other way neither, 't seems to me,
Rachael?"
“No, Stephen.”
He looked at her with some disappointment in his face,
but with a respectful and patient conviction that she
must be right in whatever she did. The expression was
not lost upon her; she laid her hand lightly on his arm
a moment as if to thank him for it.
“We are such true friends, lad, and such old friends,
and getting to be such old folk, now.”
“No, Rachael, thou’rt as young as ever thou wast."
“One of us would be puzzled how to get old, Stephen,
without t'other getting so too, both being alive,” she
answered, laughing; “but, anyways, we're such old

friends, that ť hide a word of honest truth fro' one
another would be a sin and a pity. 'Tis better not to
walk too much together. 'Times, yes! 'Twould be
hard, indeed, if 'twas not to be at all," she said, with a
cheerfulness she sought to communicate to him.
“'Tis hard, anyways, Rachael.”
“ Try to think not; and 'twill seem better.”
“I've tried a long time, and 'ta’nt got better. But
thou’rt right; ’tmight make fok talk, even of thee.
Thou hast been that to me, Rachael, through so many
year: thou hast done me so much good, and heartened
of me in that cheering way that thy word is a law to
me. Ah, lass, and a bright good law! Better than some
real ones.”
“Never fret about them, Stephen,” she answered
quickly, and not without an anxious glance at his face.
** Let the laws be.”
“Yes,” he said, with a slow nod or two. “Let 'em
be. Let everything be. Let all sorts alone. 'Tis a
muddle, and that's aw.”
“Always a muddle?” said Rachel, with another gentle
touch upon his arm, as if to recall him out of the
thoughtfulness, in which he was biting the long ends of
his loose neckerchief as he walked along. The touch
had its instantaneous effect. He let them fall, turned a
smiling face upon her, and said, as he broke into a good-
humoured laugh, “ Ay, Rachel, lass, awlus a muddle.
That's where I stick. I come to the muddle many times
and agen, and I never get beyond it.”
They had walked some distance, and were near their
own homes. The woman's was the first reached. It was
in one of the many small streets for which the favourite
undertaker (who turned a handsome sum out of the
one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood) kept a
black ladder, in order that those who had done their
daily groping up and down the narrow stairs might
slide out of this working world by the windows. She
stopped at the corner, and putting her hand in his,
wished him good-night.
“Good-night, dear lass; good-night!”
She went, with her neat figure and her sober womanly
step, down the dark street, and he stood looking after
her until she turned into one of the small houses. There
was not a flutter of her coarse shawl, perhaps, but had

its interest in this man's eyes; not a tone of her voice
but had its echo in his innermost heart.
When she was lost to his view, he pursued his home-
ward way, glancing up sometimes at the sky, where
the clouds were sailing fast and wildly. But they were
broken now, and the rain had ceased, and the moon
shone-looking down the high chimneys of Coketown
on the deep furnaces below, and casting Titanic shadows
of the steam engines at rest upon the walls were they
were lodged. The man seemed to have brightened with
the night, as he went on.
His home, in such another street as the first, saving
that it was narrower, was over a little shop. How it
came to pass that any people found it worth their while
to sell or buy the wretched little toys, mixed up in its
window with cheap newspapers and pork (there was a
leg to be raffled for to-morrow night), matters not here.
He took his end of candle from the shelf, lighted it at
another end of candle on the counter, without disturbing
the mistress of the shop, who was asleep in her little
room, and went up-stairs into his lodging
It was a room, not unacquainted with the black ladder
under various tenants; but as neat, at present, as such
a room could be. A few books and writings were on an
old bureau in a corner, the furniture was decent and
sufficient, and, though the atmosphere was tainted, the
room was clean.
Going to the hearth to set the candle down upon a
round three-legged table standing there, he stumbled
against something. As he recoiled, looking down at it,
it raised itself up into the form of a woman in a sitting
attitude.
“Heaven's mercy, woman!” he cried, falling farther
off from the figure. “Hast thou come back again!”
Such a woman! A disabled, drunken creature, barely
able to preserve her sitting posture by steadying herself
with one begrimed hand on the floor, while the other
was so purposeless in trying to push away her tangled
hair from her face, that it only blinded her the more
with the dirt upon it. A creature so foul to look at, in
her tatters, stains and splashes, but so much fouler than
that in her moral infamy, that it was a shameful thing
even to see her.
After an impatient oath or two, and some stupid

clawing of herself with the hand not necessary to her
support, she got her hair away from her eyes sufficiently
to obtain a sight of him. Then she sat swaying her
body to and fro, and making gestures with her un-
nerved arm, which seemed intended as the accompani-
ment to a fit of laughter, though her face was stolid and
drowsy.
“Eigh, lad ? What, yo’r there?” Some hoarse sounds
meant for this came mockingly out of her at last; and
her head dropped forward on her breast.
“Back agen?” she screeched, after some minutes, as
if he had that moment said it. “ Yes! And back agen.
Back agen ever and ever so often. Back? Yes, back.
Why not?"
Roused by the unmeaning violence with which she
cried it out, she scrambled up, and stood supporting
herself with her shoulders against the wall; dangling in
one hand by the string a dunghill-fragment of a bonnet,
and trying to look scornfully at him,
“I'lỈ sell thee off again, and I'll sell thee off again,
and I'll sell thee off a score of times!” she cried, with
something between a furious menace and an effort at a
defiant dance. “Come awa' from th’bed!" He was
sitting on the side of it, with his face hidden in his
hands. “Come awa' from 't. 'Tis mine, and I've a
right to 't!"
As she staggered to it he avoided her with a shudder,
and passed-his face still hidden-to the opposite end
of the room. She threw herself upon the bed heavily,
and soon was snoring hard. He sunk into a chair and
moved but once all that night. It was to throw a cover-
ing over her; as if his hands were not enough to hide
her, even in the darkness.

CHAPTER XI.
NO WAY OUT.
THE Fairy palaces burst into illumination before pale
morning showed the monstrous serpents of smoke
trailing themselves over Coketown. A clattering of
clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of bells; and
all the melancholy mad elements, polished and oiled up
for the day's monotony, were at their heavy exercise
again.
Stephen bent over his loom, quiet, watchful, and
steady. A special contrast, as every man was in the
forest of looms where Stephen worked, to the crash-
ing, smashing, tearing piece of mechanism at which
he laboured. Never fear, good people of an anxious turn
of mind, that Art will consign nature to oblivion. Set
anywhere, side by side, the work of God and the work of
man; and the former, even though it be a troop of
Hands of very small account, will gain in dignity from
the comparison.
So many hundred Hands in this Mill; so many hun-
dred horse Steam Power. It is known, to the force of a
single pound weight, what the engine will do; but not
all the calculators of the National Debt can tell me the
capacity for good or evil, for love or hatred, for patriot-
ism or discontent, for the decomposition of virtue into
vice, or the reverse, at any single moment in the soul of
any of these its quiet servants, with the composed faces
and the regulated actions. There is no mystery in it;
there is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of
them, forever. Supposing we were to reserve our arith-
metic for material objects, and to govern these awful
unknown quantities by other means!
The day grew strong, and showed itself outside, even
against the flaming lights within. The lights were
turned out, and the work went on. The rain fell, and
the Smoke-serpents, submissive to the curse of all that
tribe, trailed themselves upon the earth. In the waste-
yard outside, the steam from the escape pipe, the litter
of barrels and old iron, the shining heaps of coals, the

ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of mist and
rain.
The work went on, until the noon-bell rang. More
clattering upon the pavements. The looms, and wheels,
and Hands all out of gear for an hour.
Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind
and cold wet streets, haggard and worn. He turned from
his own class and his own quarter, taking nothing but
a little bread as he walked along, towards the hill on
which his principal employer lived, in a red house with
black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street
door, up two white steps, Bounderby (in letters very
like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen
door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.
Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch. So Stephen had ex-
pected. Would his servant say that one of the Hands
begged leave to speak to him? Message in return, re-
quiring name of such Hand. Stephen Blackpool. There
was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool;
yes, he might come in.
Stephen Blackpool in the parlour. Mr. Bounderby
(whom he just knew by sight), at lunch on chop and
sherry. Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fire-side, in a side-
saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup. It
was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit's dignity and service,
not to lunch. She supervised the meal officially, but
implied that in her own stately person she considered
lunch a weakness.
“Now, Stephen,” said Mr. Bounderby, “what's the
matter with you?”
Stephen made a bow. Not a servile one—these Hands
will never do that! Lord bless you, sir, you'll never
catch them at that, if they have been with you twenty
years!—and as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit,
tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.
“Now, you know,” said Mr. Bounderby, taking some
sherry, “ we have never had any difficulty with you,
and you have never been one of the unreasonable ones.
You don't expect to be set up in a coach and six, and to be
fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, as a.
good many of 'em do!” Mr. Bounderby always repre-
sented this to be the sole, immediate, and direct object
of any Hand who was not satisfied; "and therefore I
know already that you have not come here to make a

complaint. Now, you know, I am certain of that,
beforehand.”
“No, sir, sure I ha' not coom for nowt o'th' kind.”
Mr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised, notwith-
standing his previous strong conviction. “Very well,”
he returned. “You're a steady Hand, and I was not
mistaken. Now, let me hear what it's all about. As
it's not that, let me hear what it is. What have you
got to say? Out with it, lad!”
Stephen happened to glance towards. Mrs. Sparsit. “I
can go, Mr. Bounderby, if you wish it,” said that self-
sacrificing lady, making a feint of taking her foot out
of the stirrup.
Mr. Bounderby stayed her, by holding a mouthful of
chop in suspension before swallowing it, and putting
out his left hand. Then, withdrawing his hand and
swallowing his mouthful of chop, he said to Stephen:
“Now, you know, this good lady.is a born lady, a high
lady. You are not to suppose because she keeps my
house for me, that she hasn't been very high up the tree
-ah, up at the top of the tree! Now, if you have got
anything to say that can't be said before a born lady,
this lady will leave the room. If what you have got to
say can be said before a born lady, this lady will stay
where she is.”
“Sir, I hope I never had nowt to say, not fitten for a
born lady to year, sin' I were born mysen',” was the
reply, accompanied with a slight flush.
* Very well,” said Mr. Bounderby, pushing away his
plate, and leaning back. “Fire away!”
“I ha' coom,” Stephen began, raising his eyes from
the floor, after a moment's consideration, “to ask yo yor
advice. I need’t overmuch. I were married on Eas'r
Monday nineteen year sin, long and dree. She were a
young lass-pretty enow—wi' good accounts of herseln.
Well! she went bad-soon. Not along of me. Gonnows
I were not a unkind husband to her.”
“I have heard all this before,” said Mr. Bounderby.
“She took to drinking, left off working, sold the furni-
ture, pawned the clothes, and played old Gooseberry.”
“I were patient wi' her.”
(“The more fool you, I think,” said Mr. Bounderby, in
confidence to his wine-glass.)
“I were very patient wi' her. I tried to wean her

fra't ower and ower agen. I tried this, I tried that, I
tried t’other. I ha' gone home, many's the time, and
found all vanished as I had in the world, and her with-
out a sense left to bless herseln lying on bare ground. I
ha’ dun't not once, not twice-twenty time!"
Every line in his face deepend as he said it, and put
in its affecting evidence of the suffering he had under-
gone.
“From bad to worse, from worse to worsen. She left
me. She disgraced herseln every ways, bitter and bad.
She coom back, she coom back, she coom back. What
could I do t' hinder her? I ha' walked the streets nights
long, ere ever I'd go home. I ha' gone t th’ brigg,
minded to fling myseln ower, and ha' no more on 't. I
ha’ bore that much, that I were owd when I were young.”
Mrs. Sparsit, easily ambling along with her netting-
needles, raised the Coriolanian eyebrows and shook her
head, as much as to say, “ The great know trouble as
well as the small. Please to turn your humble eye in
my direction.”
“I ha' paid her to keep awa fra' me. These five year
I ha' paid her. I ha' götten decent fewtrils about me
agen. I ha’ lived hard and sad, but not ashamed and
fearfo' a' the minnits o' my life. Last night, I went
home. There she lay upon my har-stone! There she is.”
In the strength of his misfortune, and the energy of
his distress, he fired for a moment like a proud man.
In another moment, he stood as he had stood all the
time—his usual stoop upon him; his pondering face ad-
dressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on
it, half shrewd, half perplexed, as if his mind were set
upon unravelling something very difficult; his hat held
tight in his left hand, which rested on his hip; his right
arm, with a rugged propriety and force of action, very
earnestly emphasising what he said: not least so when
it always paused, a little bent, but not withdrawn, as
he paused.
“I was acquainted with all this, you know,” said Mr.
Bounderby, * except the last clause, long ago. It's a
bad job; that's what it is. You had better had been ·
satisfied as you were, and not have got married. How-
ever, it's too late to say that.”
“Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of years?"
aşkęd Mrs. Sparsit,

“You hear what this lady asks. Was it an unequal
marriage in point of years, this unlucky job of yours?”
said Mr. Bounderby.
“Not e'en so. I were one-and-twenty myseln; she
were twenty nighbut.”
“Indeed, sir?" said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief, with
great placidity. “I inferred, from its being so miserable
a marriage, that it was probably an unequal one in
point of years.”
Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in
a sidelong way that had an odd sheepishness about it.
He fortified himself with a little more sherry.
“Well? Why don't you go on?” he then asked, turn-
ing rather irritably on Stephen Blackpool.
“I ha' coom to ask yo, sir, how I am to be ridded o'
this woman.” Stephen infused a yet deeper gravity
into the mixed expression of his attentive face. Mrs.
Sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation, as having received a
moral shock.
“What do you mean?” said Bounderby, getting up to
lean his back against the chimney-piece. “What are
you talking about?” You took her for better for
worse.”
“I mun’ be ridden o’ her. I cannot bear't nommore.
I ha' lived under 't so long, for that I ha' had ’n the

“He wishes to be free, to marry the female of whom
he speaks, I fear, sir,” óbserved Mrs. Sparsit in an un-
dertone, and much dejected by the immorality of the
people.

for smaller wrongs than mine. So, I mun be ridden o'
this woman, and I want t' know how?”
“No how," returned Mr. Bounderby.
“If I do her any hurt, sir, there's a law to punish me?"
“Of course there is.”
“If I flee from her there's a law to punish me?'
“Of course there is.”
“If I marry toother dear lass, there's a law to punish
me?"
“Of course there is?”
“If I was to live wi' her an not marry her-saying
such a thing could be, which it never could or would, an
her so good—there's a law to punish me, in every inno-
cent child belonging to me?”
“ Of course there is.”
“Now, a' God's name,” said Stephen Blackpool, “show
me the law to help me!”
“Hem! There's a sanctity in this relation of life,” said
Mr. Bounderby, “and-and-it must be kept up.”
“No, no, dunnot say that, sir. 'Tan't kep' up that
way. Not that way. 'Tis kep’ down that way. I'm a
weaver, I were in a fact'ry when a chilt, but I ha' gotten
een to see wi' and eern to year wi'. I read in th' papers
every 'Sizes, every Sessions and you read too—I know
it!-with dismay—how th’ supposed unpossibility o' ever
getting unchained from one another, at any price, on
any terms, brings blood upon this land, and brings
many common married fok to battle, murder, and sud-
den death. Let us ha' this, right understood. Mine's a
grievous case, and I want—if yo will be so good—t' know
the law that helps me."
“Now, I tell you what!” said Mr. Bounderby, putting
his hands in his pockets. “There is such a law."
Stephen, subsiding into his quiet manner, and never
wandering in his attention, gave a nod.,
“But it's not for you at all. It costs money. It costs
a mint of money.”
“How much might that be?” Stephen calmly asked.
" Why, you'd have to go to Doctors' Commons with a
suit, and you'd have to go to a court of Common Law
with a suit, and you'd have to go to the House of Lords
with a suit, and you'd have to get an act of Parliament
to enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if
it was a case of very plain sailing), I suppose from a

thousand to fifteen hundred pound,” said Mr. Bounderby.
“ Perhaps twice the money."
66 There's no other law?"
“ Certainly not.”
“Why then, sir,” said Stephen, turning white, and
motioning with that right hand of his, as if he gave
everything to the four winds, “'tis a muddle. 'Tis just
ů muddle a'toogether, an’ the sooner I am dead, the
better.”
(Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the
people.)
"Pooh, pooh! Don't you talk nonsense,my good fellow,”
said Mr. Bounderby, “about things you don't under-
stand: and don't you call the Institutions of your country
a muddle, or you'll get yourself into a real muddle one
of these fine mornings. The institutions of your country
are not your piece-work, and the only thing you have
got to do is to mind your piece-work. You didn't take
your wife for fast and for loose; but for better for worse.
If she has turned out worse--why, all we have got to say
is she might have turned out better.”
“? Tis a muddle,” said Stephen, shaking his head as he
moved to the door. “'Tis a muddle!"
Now, I'll tell you what!” Mr. Bounderby resumed,
as a valedictory address. “With what I shall call your
unhallowed opinions, you have been quite shocking
this lady: who, as I have already told you, is a born
lady, and who, as I have not already told you, has had
her own marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of
thousands of pounds—tens of Thou-sands of Pounds!”
(he repeated it with great relish). “Now you have al-
ways been a steady Hand hitherto; but my opinion is,
and so I will tell you plainly, that you are turning into
the wrong road. You have been listening to some mis-
chievous stranger or other—they're always about-and
the best thing you can do is, to come out of that. Now
you know;" here his countenance expressed remarkable
acuteness; “I can see as far into a grindstone as an-
other man; farther than a good many, perhaps, because
I had my nose well kept to it when I was young. I see
traces of the turtle soup, and venison, and gold spoon
in this. Yes, I do!” cried Mr. Bounderby, shaking his
head with obstinate cunning. “By the Lord Harry,
I do!”

With a very different shake of the head and deep
sigh, Stephen said, “Thank you, sir, I wish you good
day." So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own
portrait on the wall as if he were going to explode him-
self into it; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her
foot in her stirrup, looking quite cast down by the pop-
ular vices.
CHAPTER XII.
THE OLD WOMAN.
OLD STEPHEN descended the two white steps, shutting
the black door with the brazen door-plate, by the aid of
the brazen full-stop, to which he gave a parting polish
with the sleeve of his coat, observing that his hot hand
clouded it. He crossed the street with his eyes bent
upon the ground, and thus was walking sorrowfully
away, when he felt a touch upon his arm.
It was not the touch he needed most at such a moment
-the touch that could calm the wild waters of his soul,
as the uplifted hand of the sublimest love and patience
could abate the raging of the sea—yet it was a woman's
hand too. It was an old woman, tall and shapely still,
though withered by time, on whom his eyes fell when
he stopped and turned. She was very cleanly and
plainly dressed, had country mud upon her shoes, and
was newly come from a journey. The flutter of her
manner in the unwonted noise of the streets; the spare
shawl, carried unfolded on her arm; the heavy um-
brella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered gloves,
to which her hands were unused; all bespoke an old
woman from the country, in her plain holiday clothes,
come into Coketown on an expedition of rare occurrence.
Remarking this at a glance, with the quick observation
of his class, Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face
-his face, which, like the faces of many of his order,
by dint of long working with eyes and hands in the
midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the concen-
trated look with which we are familiar in the counte-
nances of the deaf-the better to hear what she asked
him.
“Pray, sir,” said the old woman, “ didn't I see you

come out of that gentleman's house?”' pointing back
to Mr. Bounderby's. “I believe it was you, unless I
have had the bad luck to mistake the person in fol-
lowing?"
“Yes, missus,” returned Stephen, “it were me.”
“Have you—you'll excuse an old woman's curiosity-
have you seen the gentleman?”
“Yes, missus.”
“And how did he look, sir? Was he portly, bold, out-
spoken, and hearty?” As she straightened her own
figure, and held up her head in adapting her action to
her words, the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen
this old woman before, and had not quite liked her.
“Oh, yes,” he returned, observing her more attentively,
"he were all that.”
“And healthy,” said the old woman, “as the fresh
wind?”
“ Yes, returned Stephen. “He were ett'n and drink-
ing—as large and as loud as a Hummobee.”
* Thank you!" said the old woman with infinite con-
tent. “Thank you!"
He certainly never had seen this old woman before.
Yet there was a vague remembrance in his mind, as if
he had more than once dreamed of some old woman like
her.
She walked along at his side, and, gently accommo-
dating himself to her humour, he said Coketown was a
busy place, was it not? To which she answered, “Eigh,
sure! Dreadful busy!" Then he said, she came from the
country, he saw? To which she answered in the affirm-
ative.
“By Parliamentary, this morning. I came forty mile
by Parliamentary this morning, and I'm going back the
same forty mile this afternoon. I walked nine mile to
the station this morning, and, if I find nobody on the
road to give me a lift, I shall walk the nine mile back
to-night. That's pretty well, sir, at my age!” said the
chatty old woman, her eye brightening with exultation.
“'Deed 'tis. Don't do't too often, missus."
“No, no. Once a year,” she answered, shaking her
head. “I spend my savings so, once every year. I
come regular, to tramp about the streets, and see the
gentlemen.”
“Only to see 'em?” returned Stephen.

“That's enough for me,” she replied, with great earn-
estness and interest of manner. “I ask no more! I
have been standing about, on this side of the way, to see
that gentleman,” turning her head back towards Mr.
Bounderby's again, “come out. But he's late this year,
and I have not seen him. You came out instead. Now,
if I am obliged to go back without a glimpse of him-İ
only want a glimpse—well! I have seen you, and you
have seen him, and I must make that do.” Saying this,
she looked at Stephen as if to fix his features in her
mind, and her eye was not so bright as it had been.
With a large allowance for difference of tastes, and
with all submission to the patricians of Coketown, this
seemed so extraordinary a source of interest to take so
much trouble about, that it perplexed him. But they
were passing the church now, and, as his eye caught the
clock, he quickened his pace.
He was going to his work? the old woman said,
quickening hers, too, quite easily. Yes, time was
nearly out. On his telling her where he worked, the
old woman became a more singular old woman than
before.
“An't you happy?” she asked him.
“Why—there's awmost nobbody but has their troubles,
missus." He answered evasively, because the old woman
appeared to take it for granted that he would be very
happy indeed, and he had not the heart to disappoint
her. He knew that there was trouble enough in the
world; and if the old woman had lived so long, and
could count upon his having so little, why so much the
better for her, and none the worse for him.
“Ay, ay! You have your troubles at home, you mean?”
she said.
“ Times. Just now and then,” he answered slightly.
“But, working under such a gentleman, they don't
follow you to the Factory?".
No, no; they didn't follow him there, said Stephen.
All correct there. Everything accordant there. (He
did not go so far as to say, for her pleasure, that there
was a sort of Divine Right there; but I have heard
claims almost as magnificent of late years.)
They were now in the black by-road near the place,
and the hands were crowding in. The bell was ringing,
and the Serpent was a Serpent of many coils, and the

Elephant was getting ready. The strange old woman
was delighted with the very bell. It was the beauti-
fullest bell she had ever heard, she said, and sounded
grand!.
She asked him, when he stopped good-naturedly to
shake hands with her before going in, how long he had
worked there.
“A dozen year,” he told her.
“I must kiss the hand,” said she, “ that has worked
in this fine factory for a dozen year!” And she lifted
it, though he would have prevented her, and put it to
her lips. What harmony, besides her age and sim-
plicity, surrounded her, he did not know, but even in
this fantastic action there was a something neither out
of time nor place: a something which it seemed as if no-
body else could have made as serious, or done with
such a natural and touching air.
He had been at his loom full have an hour, thinking
about this old woman, when, having occasion to move
round the loom for its adjustment, he glanced through
a window which was in his corner, and saw her still
looking up at the pile of building, lost in admiration.
Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet, and of her
two long journeys, she was gazing at it, as if the heavy
thrum that issued from its many stories were proud
music to her.
She was gone by-and-by, and the day went after her,
and the lights sprung up again, and the Express
whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over the arches
near: little felt amid the jarring of the machinery, and
scarcely heard above its crash and rattle. Long before
then his thoughts had gone back to the dreary room
above the little shop, and to the shameful figure heavy
on the bed, but heavier on his heart.
Machinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting
pulse; stopped. The bell again; the glare of light and
heat dispelled; the factories, looming heavy in the
black, wet night—their tall chimneys rising up into the
air like competing Towers of Babel.
He had spoken to Rachael only last night, it was true,
and had walked with her à little way; but he had his
new misfortune on him in which no one else could give
him a moment's relief, and, for the sake of it, and because
he knew himself to want that softening of his anger

which no voice but hers could effect, he felt that he
might so far disregard what she had said as to wait for
her again. He waited, but she had eluded him. She was
gone. On no other night in the year could he so ill
have spared her patient face.
Oh! Better to have no home in which to lay his head,
than to have a home and dread to go to it, through
such a cause. He ate and drank, for he was exhausted
—but he little knew or cared what; and he wandered
about in the chill rain, thinking and thinking, and
brooding and brooding.
No word of a new marriage had ever passed between
them; but Rachael had taken great pity on him years
ago, and to her alone he had opened his closed heart
all this time, on the subject of his miseries; and he knew
very well that if he were free to ask her, she would take
him. He thought of the home he might at that moment
have been seeking with pleasure and pride: of the dif-
ferent man he might have been that night; of the light-
ness then in his now heavy-laden breast; of the then
restored honour, self-respect, and tranquility all torn to
pieces. He thought of the waste of the best part of his
ſife, of the change it made in his character for the worse
every day, of the dreadful nature of his existence, bound
hand and foot to a dead woman, and tormented by a
demon in her shape. He thought of Rachael, how young
when they were first brought together in these circum-
stances, how mature now, how soon to grow old. He
thought of the number of girls and women she had seen
marry, how many homes with children in them she had
seen grow up around her, how she had contentedly
pursued her own lone, quiet path—for him—and how he
had sometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed
face, that smote him with remorse and despair. He
set the picture of her up, beside the infamous image of
last night; and thought, could it be that the whole
earthly course of one so gentle, good, and self denying,
was subjugate to such a wretch as that!
Filled with these thoughts—so filled that he had an
unwholesome sense of growing larger, of being placed in
some new and diseased relation towards the objects
among which he passed, of seeing the iris round every
misty light turn red-he went home for shelter.

CHAPTER XIII.
RACHAEL.
A CANDLE faintly burned in the window, to which the
black ladder had often been raised for the sliding away
of all that was most precious in this world to a striving
wife and a brood of hungry babies; and Stephen added
to his other thoughts the stern reflection, that of all the
casualties of this existence upon earth, not one was
dealt out with so unequal a hand as Death. The ine-
quality of Birth was nothing to it. For, say that the
child of a King and the child of a Weaver were born to-
night in the same moment, what was that disparity, to
the death of any human creature who was serviceable
to, or beloved by, another, while this abandoned woman
lived on!
From the outside of his home he gloomily passed to
the inside, with suspended breath and with a slow foot-
step. He went up to his door, opened it, and so into the
room.
Quiet and peace were there. Rachael was there, sit-
ting by the bed.
She turned her head, and the light of her face shone
in upon the midnight of his mind. She sat by the bed,
watching and tending his wife. That is to say, he saw
that some one lay there, and he knew too well it must
be she; but Rachael's hands had put a curtain up, so
that she was screened from his eyes. Her disgraceful
garments were removed, and some of Rachael's were in
the room. Everything was in its place and order as he
had always kept it, the little fire was newly trimmed,
and the hearth was freshly swept. It appeared to him
that he saw all this in Rachael's face, and looked at
nothing besides. While looking at it, it was shut out
from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes;
but not before he had seen how earnestly she looked at
him, and how her own eyes were filled too.
She turned again towards the bed, and satisfying her-
self that all was quiet there, spoke in a low, calm, cheer-
ful voice;

HARD TIMES.
“I am glad you have come at last, Stephen. You are
very late.”
“I ha' been walking up an' down.”
“I thought so. But 'tis too bad a night for that. The
rain falls very heavy, and the wind has risen.”
The wind? True. It was blowing hard. Hark to
the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise!'
To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known
it was blowing!
“I have been here once before to-day, Stephen. Land-
lady came round for me at dinner-time. There was
some one here that needed looking to, she said. And
’deed she was right. All wandering and lost, Stephen.
Wounded too, and bruised.”
He slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping
his head before her.
“I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for
that she worked with me when we were girls both, and
for that you courted her and married her when I was
her friend”
He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low
groan.
“And next, for that I know your heart, and am right
sure and certain that 'tis far too merciful to let her
die, or even so much as to suffer, for want of aid.
Thou knowest who said, 'Let him who is without
sin among you cast the first stone at her! There have
been plenty to do that. Thou art not the man to cast
the last stone, Stephen, when she is brought so
low.”
“Oh, Rachael, Rachael!"
“Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward
thee!” she said, in compassionate accents. “I am thy
poor friend, with all my heart and mind.”
The wounds of which she had spoken seemed to be
about the neck of the self-made outcast. She dressed
them now, still without showing her. She steeped a
piece of linen in a basin, into which she poured some
liquid from a bottle, and laid it with a gentle hand upon
the sore. The three-legged table had been drawn close
to the bedside, and on it there were two bottles. This
was one.
It was not so far off but that Stephen, following her
hands with his eyes, could read what was printed on it,

If
in large letters. He turned of a deadly hue, and a sud.
den horror seemed to fall upon him.
“I will stay here, Stephen,” said Rachael, quietly re-
suming her seat. "till the bells go Three. "Tis to be
done again at three, and then she may be left till morn-
ing."
“But thy rest agen to-morrow's work, my dear.”
“I slept sound last night. I can wake many nights,
when I am put to it. 'Tis thou who art in need of rest
-So white and tired. Try to sleep in the chair there,
while I watch. Thou hadst no sleep last night, I can
well believe. To-morrow's work is far harder for thee
than for me.”
He heard the thundering and surging out of doors,
and it seemed to him as if his late angry mood were
going about trying to get at him. She had cast it out;
she would keep it out; he trusted to her to defend him
from himself.
“She don't know me, Stephen; she just drowsily mut-
ters and stares. I have spoken to her times and again,
but she don't notice! 'Tis as well so. When she comes
to her right mind once more, I shall have done what I
can, and she never the wiser."
“How long, Rachael, is't looked for, that she'll be so?”
“ Doctor said she would haply come to her mind
to-morrow.”
His eyes again fell on the bottle, and a tremble passed
over him, causing him to shiver in every limb. She
thought he was chilled with the wet. “No," he said;
“it was not that. He had had a fright.”
“A fright?"
“Ay, ay! coming in. When I were walking. When
I were thinking. When 1” It seized him again; and
he stood up, holding by the mantel-shelf, as he pressed his
dank, cold hair down with a hand that shook as if it were
palsied.
“Stephen!”
She was coming to him, but he stretched out his arm
to stop her.
“No! Don't, please; don't! Let me see thee setten by
the bed. Let me see thee, a' so good, and so forgiving.
Let me see thee as I see thee when I coom in. I never
can see thee better than so. Never, never, never!"
He had a violent fit of trembling, and then sunk into

his chair. After a time he controlled himself, and, rest-
ing with an elbow on one knee, and his head upon
that hand, could look towards Rachael. Seen across the
dim candle with his moistened eyes, she looked as if she
had a glory shining round her head. He could have
believed she had. He did believe it, as the noise without
shook the window, rattled at the door below, and went
about the house clamouring and lamenting.
“When she gets better, Stephen, 'tis to be hoped she'll
leave thee to thyself again, and do thee no more hurt.
Anyways, we will hope so now. And now I shall keep
silence, for I want thee to sleep.”
He closed his eyes, more to please her than to rest his
weary head; but by slow degrees, as he listened to the
great noise of the wind, he ceased to hear it, or it changed
into the working of his loom, or even into the voices of
the day (his own included) saying what had been really
said. Even this imperfect consciousness faded away at
last, and he dreamed a long, troubled dream.
- He thought that he, and some one on whom his heart
had long been set-but she was not Rachael, and that
surprised him, even in the midst of his imaginary hap-
piness-stood in the church being married. While the
ceremony was performing, and while he recognised
among the witnesses some whom he knew to be living,
and many whom he knew to be dead, darkness came on,
succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light. It
broke from one line in the table of commandments at
the altar, and illuminated the building with the words.
They were sounded in the church, too, as if there were
voices in the fiery letters. Upon this, the whole appear-
ance before him and around him changed, and nothing
was left as it had been but himself and the clergyman.
They stood in the daylight before a crowd so vast, that
if all the people in the world could have been brought
together into one space, they could not have looked, he
thought, more numerous; and they all abhorred him,
and there was not one pitying or friendly eye among the
millions that were fastened on his face. He stood on a
raised stage, under his own loom, and, looking up at the
shape the loom took, and hearing the burial service dis-
tinctly read, he knew that he was there to suffer death.
In an instant what he stood on fell below him, and he
was gone.

Out of what mystery he came back to his usual life,
and to places that he knew, he was unable to consider;
but he was back in those places by some means, and
with this condemnation upon him, that he was never, in
this world or the next, through all the unimaginable
ages of eternity, to look on Rachael's face or hear her
voice. Wandering to and fro, unceasingly, without
hope, and in search of he knew not what (he only knew
that he was doomed to seek it), he was the subject of a
nameless, horrible dread, a mortal fear of one particular
shape which everything took. Whatsoever he looked at
grew into that form sooner or later. The object of his
miserable existence was to prevent its recognition by
any one among the various people he encountered.
Hopeless labor! If he led them out of rooms where it
was, if he shut up drawers and closets where it stood, if
he drew the curious from places where he knew it to be
secreted, and got them out into the streets, the very
chimneys of the mills assumed that shape, and round
them was the printed word.
The wind was blowing again, the rain was beating on
the housetops, and the larger spaces through which he
had strayed contracted to the four walls of his room.
Saving that the fire had died out, it was as his eyes had
closed upon it. Rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze,
in the chair by the bed. She sat wrapped in her shawl,
perfectly still. The table stood in the same place, close
by the bedside, and on it, in its real proportions and ap-
pearance, was the shape so often repeated.
He thought he saw the curtain move. He looked
again, and he was sure it moved. He saw a hand come
forth, and grope about a little. Then the curtain moved
more perceptibly, and the woman in the bed put it back,
and sat up.
With her woful eyes, so haggard and wild, so heavy
and large, she looked all round the room, and passed
the corner where he slept in his chair. Her eyes re-
turned to that corner, and she put her hand over them
as a shade, while she looked into it. Again they went
all round the room, scarcely heeding Rachael if at all,
and returned to that corner. He thought, as she once
more shaded them not so much looking at him, as
looking for him with a brutish instinct that he was
there-that no single trace was left in those debauched

features, or in the mind that went along with them, of
the woman he had married eighteen years before. But
that he had seen her come to this by inches, he never
could have believed her to be the same.
All this time, as if a spell were on him, he was motion-
less and powerless, except to watch her.
Stupidly dozing, or communing with her incapable
self about nothing, she sat for a little while with her
hands at her ears, and her head resting on them.
Presently she resumed her staring round the room. And
now, for the first time, her eyes stopped at the table
with the bottles on it.
Straightway she turned her eyes back to his corner,
with the defiance of last night, and, moving very
cautiously and softly, stretched out her greedy hand.
She drew a mug into the bed, and sat for a while con-
sidering which of the two bottles she should choose.
Finally, she laid her insensate grasp upon the bottle
that had swift and certain death in it, and, before his
eyes, pulled out the cork with her teeth.
Dream or reality, he had no voice, nor had he power
to stir. If this be real, and her allotted time be not yet
come, wake, Rachael, wake!
She thought of that, too. She looked at Rachael, and
very slowly, very cautiously, poured out the contents.
The draught was at her lips. A moment and she would
be past all help, let the whole world wake and come
about her with its utmost power. But, in that moment
Rachael started up with a suppressed cry. The creature
struggled, struck her, seized her by the hair; but Rachael
had the cup.
Stephen broke out of his chair. “Rachael, am I wakin'
or dreamin' this dreadfo’ night?"
66'Tis all well, Stephen. I have been asleep myself.
'Tis near three. Hush! I hear the bells.”
The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to
the window. They listened, and it struck three. Stephen
looked at her, saw how pale she was, noted the disorder
of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her fore-
head, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hear-
ing had been awake. She held the cup in her hand even
now.
“I thought it must be near three,” she said, calmly
pouring from the cup into the basin, and steeping the

linen as before. “I am thankful I stayed! 'Tis done
now, when I have put this on. There! And now she's
quiet again. The few drops in the basin I'll pour away,
for 'tis bad stuff to leave about, though ever so little of
it.” As she spoke she drained the basin into the ashes
of the fire, and broke the bottle on the hearth.
She had nothing to do, then, but to cover herself with
her shawl before going out into the wind and rain.
“Thou'lt let me walk wi’ thee at this hour, Rachael?”
“No, Stephen. 'Tis but a minute and I'm home.”
“Thou’rt not fearfo’,” he said in a low voice, as they
went out at the door, “ to leave me alone wi' her!”
As she looked at him, saying “ Stephen?” he went
down on his knee before her, on the poor mean stairs,
and put an end of her shawl to his lips.
“Thou art an Angel. Bless thee, bless thee!”
“Iam, as I have told thee, Stephen, thy poor friend.
Angels are not like me. Between them and a working
woman fu’ of faults, there is a deep gulf set. My little
sister is among them, but she is changed."
She raised her eyes for a moment as she said the
words; and then they fell again, in all their gentleness
and mildness, on his face.
“Thou changest me from bad to good. Thou mak'st
me humbly wishfo’ to be more like thee, and fearfo’ to
lose thee when this life is ower, an a'the muddle cleared
awa'. Thou’rt an Angel; it may be thou hast saved my
soul alive!”
She looked at him, on his knee at her feet, with her
shawl still in his hand, and the reproof on her lips died
away when she saw the working of his face.
“I coom home desp’rate. I coom home wi’out a hope,
and mad wi' thinking that when I said a word o' com-
plaint I was reckoned a onreasonable Hand. I told thee
I had had a fright. It were the Poison-bottle on table.
I never hurt a livin' creatur; but happenin' so suddenly
upon't, I thowt, “How can I say what I might ha' done ·
to myseln, or her, or both!”
She put her two hands on his mouth, with a face of
terror, to stop him from saying more. He caught them
in his unoccupied hand, and holding them, and still
clasping the border of her shawl, said, hurriedly:
“But I see thee, Rachael, setten by the bed. I ha'
seen thee aw this night. In my troublous sleep I ha'

known thee still to be there. Evermore I will see thee
there. I nevermore will see her or think o’her, but
thou shalt be beside her. I nevermore will see or think
o' anything that angers me, but thou, so much better
than me, shalt be by th’ side on't.. And so I will try t'
look t'th' time, and so I will try t' trust t'th' time when
thou and me at last shall walk together far awa', beyond
the deep gulf, in th' country where thy little sister is.”
He kissed the border of her shawl again, and let her
go. She bade him good-night in a broken voice, and
went out into the street.
The wind blew from the quarter where the day would
soon appear, and still blew strongly. It had cleared the
sky before it, and the rain had spent itself or travelled
elsewhere, and the stars were bright. He stood bare-
headed in the road watching her quick disappearance.
As the shining stars were to the heavy candle in the
window, so was Rachael, in the rugged fancy of this
man, to the common experiences of his life.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE GREAT MANUFACTURER.
TIME went on in Coketown, like its own machinery:
so much material wrought up, so much fuel consumed,
so many powers worn out, so much money made. But,
less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its
varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and
brick, and made the only stand that ever was made in
the place against its direful uniformity.
“ Louisa is becoming,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “almost
a young woman.”
Time, with its innumerable horse-power, worked
away, not minding what anybody said, and presently
turned out young Thomas a foot taller than when his
father had last taken particular notice of him.
“ Thomas is becoming," said Mr. Gradgrind, “almost
a young man."
Time passed Thomas on in the mill, while his father
was thinking about it, and there he stood in a long-
tailed coat, and a stiff shirt-collar.

“Really,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “the period has ar-
rived when Thomas ought to go to Bounderby.”
Time, sticking to him, passed him on into Bounderby's
Bank, made him an inmate of Bounderby's house,
necessitated the purchase of his first razor, and exer-
cised him diligently in his calculations relative to num-
ber one.
The same great manufacturer, always with an ini-
mense variety of work on hand, in every stage of devel-
opment, passed Sissy onward in his mill, and worked
her up into a very pretty article indeed.
“I fear, Jupe,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “that your con-
tinuance at the school any longer would be useless."
“I am afraid it would, sir,” Sissy answered with a
curtsey.
“I cannot disguise from you, Jupe," said Mr. Grad-
grind, knitting his brow, “that the result of your pro-
bation there has disappointed me; has greatly disap-
pointed me. You have not acquired, under Mr. and
Mrs. M'Choakumchild, anything like that amount of
exact knowledge which I looked for. You are extremely
deficient in your facts. Your acquaintance with figures
is very limited. You are altogether backward, and
below the mark.”
“I am sorry, sir,” she returned; “but I know it is
quite true. Yet I have tried hard, sir.”
“Yes,” said Mr. Gradgrind; “yes, I believe you have
tried hard; I have observed you, and I can find no fault
in that respect.”
“Thank you, sir, I have thought sometimes;" Sissy
very timid here; “that perhaps I tried to learn too much,
and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less,
I might have"
“No, Jupe, no,” said Mr. Gradgrind, shaking his head

“No. The course you pursued, you pursued according
to the system-the system and there is no more to be
said about it. I can only suppose that the circumstances
of your early life were too unfavourable to the develop-
ment of your reasoning powers, and that we began
too late. Still, as I have said already, I am disap-
pointed.”
“I wish I could have made a better acknowledg-
ment, sir, of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who

“Don't shed tears,” said Mr. Gradgrind. “Don't
shed tears. I don't complain of you. You are an
affectionate, earnest, good young woman, and-and we
must make that do.”
“Thank you, sir, very much,” said Sissy, with a grate-
ful curtsey.
“You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally
pervading way) you are serviceable in the family also;
so I understand from Miss Louisa, and, indeed, so I have
observed myself. I therefore hope,” said Mr. Grad-
grind, “that you can make yourself happy in those
relations."
“I should have nothing to wish, sir, if—”
“I understand you,” said Mr. Gradgrind; you still re-
fer to your father. I have heard from Miss Louisa that
you still preserve that bottle. Well! If your training
in the science of arriving at exact results had been
more successful, you would have been wiser on these
points. I will say no more.”
He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for
her; otherwise he held her calculating powers in such
very slight estimation that he must have fallen upon that
conclusion. Somehow or other, he had become pos-
sessed by an idea that there was something in this girl
which could hardly be set forth in a tabular form. Her
capacity of definition might be easily stated at a very
low figure, her mathematical knowledge at nothing; yet
he was not sure that if he had been required, for exam-
ple, to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary re-
turn, he would have quite known how to divide her.
· In some stages of his manufacture of the human
fabric, the processes of Time are very rapid. Young
Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage of their
working up, these changes were effected in a year or
two; while Mr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in
his course, and underwent no alteration.
Except one, which was apart from his necessary pro-
gress through the mill. Time hustled him into a little
noisy and rather dirty machinery, in a by-corner, and
made him Member of Parliament for Coketown: one of
the respected members for ounce weights and measures,
one of the representatives of the multiplication table,

ble gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame hon-
ourable gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to
every other consideration. Else wherefore live we in a
Christian land, eighteen hundred and odd years after
our Master?
All this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet
and reserved, and so much given to watching the bright
ashes at twilight as they fell into the grate and became
extinct, that from the period when her father had said
she was almost a young woman-which seemed but yes-
terday-she had scarcely attracted his notice again,
when he found her quite a young woman.
"Quite a young woman,” said Mr. Gradgrind, mus-
ing.“ Dear me!”
Soon after this discovery he became more thoughtful
than usual for several days, and seemed much engrossed
by one subject. On a certain night, when he was going
out, and Louisa came to bid him good-bye before his
departure—as he was not to be home until late and she
would not see him again until the morning-he held her
in his arms, looking at her in his kindest manner, and
said:
“My dear Louisa, you are a woman!”
She answered with the old, quick, searching look of
the night when she was found at the circus; then cast
down her eyes. “Yes, father.”
“My dear,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “I must speak with
you alone and seriously. Come to me in my room after
breakfast to-morrow, will you?”
“ Yes, father.”
"Your hands are rather cold, Louisa. Are you not
well?"
“Quite well, father.”
“And cheerful?”
She looked at him again, and smiled in her peculiar
manner. “I am as cheerful, father, as I usually am, or
usually have been.”
“That's well,” said Mr. Gradgrind. So he kissed her
and went away; and Louisa returned to the serene
apartment of the hair-cutting character, and leaning
her elbow on her hand, looked again at the short-lived
sparks that so soon subsided into ashes.
“Are you there, Loo?" said her brother, looking in at

the door. He was quite a young gentleman of pleasure
now, and not quite a prepossessing one.
“Dear Tom,” she answered, rising and embracing
him, “how long it is since you have been to see me!”
“Why, I have been otherwise engaged, Loo, in the
evenings; and in the daytime old Bounderby has been
keeping me at it rather.' But I touch him up with you,
when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an un-
derstanding. I say! Has father said anything particular
to you, to-day or yesterday, Loo?”
"No, Tom. But he told me to-night that he wished to
do so in the morning.”
“Ah! That's what I mean,” said Tom. “Do you know
where he is to-night?”—with a very deep expression.
"No."
“Then I'll tell you. He's with old Bounderby. They
are having a regular confab together, up at the Bank.
Why at the Bank, do you think? Well, I'll tell you again.
To keep Mrs. Sparsit's ears as far off as possible, I
expect.”
With her hand upon her brother's shoulder, Louisa still
stood looking at the fire. Her brother glanced at her
face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her
waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.
“ You are very fond of me, an't you, Loo?”
“Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long in-
tervals go by without coming to see me.”
“Well, sister of mine," said Tom, “when you say
that, you are near my thoughts. We might be so much
oftener together-mightn't we? Always together almost
-mightn't we? It would do me a great deal of good if
you were to make up your mind to I know what, Loo.
It would be a splendid thing for me. It would be un-
commonly jolly!”
Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny. He
could make nothing of her face. He pressed her in his
arms, and kissed her cheek. She returned the kiss, but
still looked at the fire.
“I say, Loo! I thought I'd come and just hint to you
what was going on: though I supposed you'd most likely
guess, even if you didn't know. I can't stay, because
I'm engaged to some fellows to-night. You won't for-
get how fond you are of me?"
“No, dear Tom, I won't forget.”

6. That's a capital girl," said Tom. “Good-bye, Loo.”
She gave him an affectionate good-night, and went
out with him to the door, whence the fires of Coketown
could be seen, making the distance lurid. She stood
there, looking steadfastly towards them, and listening
to his departing steps. They retreated quickly, as glad
to get away from Stone Lodge; and she stood there yet,
when he was gone and all was quiet. It seemed as if,
first in her own fire within the house, and then in the
fiery haze without, she tried to discover what kind of
woof Old Time, that greatest and longest-established
Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he had
already spun into a woman. But his factory is a secret
place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.

ALTHOUGH Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue
Beard, his room was quite a blue chamber in its abund-
ance of blue books. Whatever they could prove (which
is usually anything you like), they proved there, in
an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of
new recruits. In that charmed apartment, the most
complicated social questions were cast up, got into exact
totals, and finally settled-if those concerned could only
have been brought to know it. As if an astronomical
observatory should be made without any windows, and
the astronomer within should arrange the starry uni-
verse solely by pen, ink, and paper, so Mr. Gradgrind,
in his Observatory (and there are many like it), had no
need to cast an eye upon the teeming myriads of human
beings around him, but could settle alĩ their destinies
on a slate, and wipe out all their tears with one dirty
little bit of sponge.
To this observatory, then: a stern room with a deadly
statistical clock in it, which measured every second
with a beat like a rap upon a coffin lid: Louisa repaired
on the appointed morning. A window looked towards
Coketown; and when she sat down near her father's

table she saw the high chimneys and the long tracts of
smoke looming in the heavy distance gloomily.
“My dear Louisa,” said her father, “I prepared you
last night to give me your serious attention in the con-
versation we are now going to have together. You
have been so well trained, and you do, I am happy to
say, so much justice to the education you have received,
that I have perfect confidence in your good sense. You
are not impulsive, you are not romantic, you are ac-
customed to view everything from the strong dispas-
sionate ground of reason and calculation. From that
ground alone I know you will view and consider what
I am going to communicate.”
He waited as if he would have been glad that she
said something. But she said never a word.
“Louisa, my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of
marriage that has been made to me.”
Again he waited, and again she answered not one
word. This so far surprised him as to induce him gently
to repeat, “A proposal of marriage, my dear.” To which
she returned, without any visible motion whatever:
“I hear you, father. I am attending, I assure you."
“Well!" said Mr. Gradgrind, breaking into a smile,
after being for the moment at a loss, “ you are even
more dispassionate than I expected, Louisa. Or,
perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement
I have it in charge to make?”
“I cannot say that, father, until I hear it. Prepared
or unprepared, I wish to hear it all from you. I wish to
hear you state it to me, father.”
Strange to relate, Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected
at this moment as his daughter was. He took a paper-
knife in his hand, turned it over, laid it down, took it
up again, and even then had to look along the blade of
it, considering how to go on.
“What you say, my dear Louisa, is perfectly reason-
able. I have undertaken then to let you know that,
in short, Mr. Bounderby has informed me that he has
long watched your progress with particular interest and
pleasure, and has long hoped that the time might ulti-
mately arrive when he should offer you his hand in
marriage. That time, to which he has so long, and cer-
tainly with great constancy, looked forward, is now
come. Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of mar-

riage to me, and has entreated me to make it known
to you, and to express his hope that you will take it into
your favourable consideration.”
Silence between them. The deadly statistical clock
very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy.
“Father,” said Louisa, “ do you think I love Mr.
Bounderby?”
Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this un-
expected question. “Well, my child,” he returned, “I
-really-cannot take upon myself to say.”
“Father,” pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice
as before, “ do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?”
“My dear Louisa, no. No. I ask nothing."
“Father,” she still pursued, “does Mr. Bounderby ask
me to love him..
“Really, my dear,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “it is diffi-
cult to answer your question,”
“Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father?”
“Certainly, my dear. Because;" here was something
to demonstrate, and it set him up again; “because the
reply depends so materially, Louisa, on the sense in
which we use the expression. Now, Mr. Bounderby
does not do you the injustice, and does not do himself
the injustice, of pretending to anything fanciful, fan-
tastic, or (I am using synonymous terms) sentimental.
Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his
eyes, to very little purpose, if he could so far forget
what is due to your good sense, not to say to his, as to
address you from any such ground. Therefore, per-
haps the expression itself-I merely suggest this to you,
my dear-may be a little misplaced.”
“What would you advise me to use in its stead,
father?”
“Why, my dear Louisa," said Mr. Gradgrind, com-
pletely recovered by this time, “I would advise you
(since you ask me) to consider this question, as you
have been accustomed to consider every other question,
simply as one of tangible Fact. The ignorant and the
giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant
fancies, and other absurdities that have no existence,
properly viewed—really no existence—but it is no compli-
ment to you to say that you know better. Now, what
are the Facts of this case? You are, we will say in
roưnd numbers, twenty years of age; Mr. Bounderby is,

91
we will say, in round numbers, fifty. There is some
disparity in your respective years, but in your means
and positions there is none; on the contrary, there is a
great suitability. Then the question arises, Is this one
disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a mar-
riage? In considering this question, it is not unim-
portant to take into account the statistics of marriage,
so far as they have yet been obtained, in England and
Wales. I find, on reference to the figures, that a large
proportion of these marriages are contracted between
parties of very unequal ages, and that the elder of these
contracting parties is, in rather more than three-
fourths of these instances, the bridegroom. It is re-
markable as showing the wide prevalence of this law,
that among the natives of the British possessions in
India, also in a considerable part of China, and among
the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computa-
tion yet furnished us by travellers, yield similar results.
The disparity I have mentioned, therefore, almost
ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all but disappears."
“What do you recommend, father," asked Louisa, her
reserved composure not in the least affected by these
gratifying results, “ that I should substitute for the term
I used just now? For the misplaced expression?”
“Louisa,” returned her father, “it appears to me that
nothing can be plainer. Confining yourself rigidly to
Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is: Does
Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him? Yes, he does.
The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him?
I think nothing can be plainer than that.”
“Shall I marry him?) repeated Louisa, with great de-
liberation.
“Precisely. And it is satisfactory to me, as your
father, my dear Louisa, to know that you do not come
to the consideration of that question with the previous
habits of mind, and habits of life, that belong to many
young women.”
“No, father,” she returned, “I do not.”
“I now leave you to judge for yourself,” said Mr.
Gradgrind. “I have stated the case, as such cases are
usually stated among practical minds; I have stated it
as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its
time. The rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to decide.”
From the beginning she had sat looking at him fixedly.

LE
As he now leaned back in his chair, and bent his deep-
set eyes upon her in his turn, perhaps he might have
seen one wavering moment in her, when she was im-
pelled to throw herself upon his breast, and give him the
pent-up confidences of her heart. But, to see it, he must
have overleaped at a bound the artificial barriers he had
for many years been erecting, between himself and all
those subtle essences of humanity which will elude the
utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to
be sounded shall blow even algebra to wreck. The bar-
riers were too many and too high for such a leap.
With his unbending, utilitarian, matter-of-fact face, he
hardened her again; and the moment shot away into the
plumbless depths of the past, to mingle with all the lost
opportunities that are drowned there.
Removing her eyes from him, she sat so long looking
silently towards the town, that he said, at length: “Are
you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works,
Louisa?"
“There seems to be nothing there but languid and
monotonous smoke. Yet when the night comes, Fire
bursts out, father!” she answered, turning quickly.
“Of course I know that, Louisa. I do not see the
application of the remark.” To do him justice, he did
not, at all.
She passed it away with a slight motion of her hand,
and concentrating her attention upon him again, said,
“Father, I have often thought that life is very short.”
This was so distinctly one of his subjects that he inter-
posed:
“It is short, no doubt, my dear. Still, the average
duration of human life is proved to have increased of
late years. The calculations of various life assurance
and annuity offices, among other figures which cannot
go wrong, have established the fact.”
“I speak of my own life, father.”
“Oh, indeed? Still,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “I need not
point out to you, Louisa, that it is governed by the laws
which govern lives in the aggregate.”
“While it lasts, I would wish to do the little I can,
and the little I am fit for. What does it matter?”
Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand
the last four words; replying, “How matter? What
matter, my dear?”
W. While it asam fit for rather at a loss matter?

“Mr. Bounderby,” she went on in a steady, straight
way, without regarding this, “asks me to marry him,
The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?
That is so, father, is it not? You have told me so, father.
Have you not?”
“Certainly, my dear.”
“Let it be so. Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me
thus, I am satisfied to accept his proposal. Tell him,
father, as soon as you please, that this was my answer.
Repeat it, word for word, if you can, because I should
wish him to know what I said.”
“It is quite right, my dear,” retorted her father ap-
provingly, “to be exact. I will observe your very proper
request. Have you any wish in reference to the period
of your marriage, my child?”
"None, father. What does it matter!”.
Mr. Gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to
her, and taken her hand. But her repetition of these
words seemed to strike with some little discord on his
,ear. He paused to look at her, and, still holding her
hand, said:
“Louisa, I have not considered it essential to ask you
one question, because the possibility implied in it ap-
peared to me to be too remote. But, perhaps, I ought to
do so. You have never entertained in secret any other
proposal?”
"Father,” she returned, almost scornfully, “what
other proposal can have been made to me? Whom have
I seen? Where have I been? What are my heart's ex-
periences?”
“My dear Louisa,” returned Mr. Gradgrind, reassured
and satisfied, “you correct me justly. I merely wished
to discharge my duty.”
“What do I know, father,” said Louisa, in her quiet
manner, “of tastes and fancies; of aspirations and af-
fections; of all that part of my nature in which such
light things might have been nourished? What escape
have I had from problems that could be demonstrated,
and realities that could be grasped?” As she said it, she
unconsciously closed her hand, as if upon a solid object,
and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust
or ash.
“My dear," assented her eminently practical parent,
“quite true, quite true.”

“Why, father,” she pursued, “what a strange ques-
tion you ask me! The baby-preference that even I have
heard of as common among children, has never had its
innocent resting-place in my breast. You have been so
careful of me, that I never had a child's heart. You
have trained me so well, that I never dreamed a child's
dream. You have dealt so wisely with me, father, from
my cradle to this hour, that I never had a child's belief
or a child's fear.”
Mr. Gradgrind was quite moved by his success, and
by this testimony to it. “My dear Louisa,” said he,
“you abundantly repay my care. Kiss me, my dear
girl."
So, his daughter kissed him. Detaining her in his
embrace, he said, “I may assure you now, my favourite
child, that I am made happy by the sound decision at
which you have arrived. Mr. Bounderby is a very re-
markable man; and what little disparity can be said to
exist between you—if any—is more than counterbal-
anced by the tone your mind has acquired. It has al-
ways been my object so to educate you, as that you
might, while still in your early youth, be (if I may so
express myself) almost any age. Kiss me once more,
Louisa. Now, let us go and find your mother.”
Accordingly, they went down to the drawing-room,
where the esteemed lady with no nonsense about her was
recumbent as usual, while Sissy worked beside her. She
gave some feeble signs of returning animation when
they entered, and presently the faint transparency was
presented in a sitting attitude.
“Mrs. Gradgrind,” said her husband, who had waited
for the achievement of this feat with some impatience,
“allow me to present to you Mrs. Bounderby.
“Oh!” said Mrs. Gradgrind, “So you have settled it!
Well, I'm sure I hope your health may be good, Louisa;
for if your head begins to split as soon as you are mar-
ried, which was the case with mine, I cannot consider
that you are to be envied, though I have no doubt you
think you are, as all girls do. However, I give you joy,
my dear-and I hope you may now turn all your ological
studies to good account, I am sure I do! I must give
you a kiss of congratulation, Louisa; but don't touch my
right shoulder, for there's something running down it
all day long. And now you see," whimpered Mrs,

Gradgrind, adjusting her shawls after the affectionate
ceremony, “I shall be worrying myself, morning, noon,
and night, to know what I am to call him!”
“Mrs. Gradgrind,” said her husband, solemnly, “what
do you mean?”
"Whatever I am to call him, Mr. Gradgrind, when he
is married to Louisa! I must call him something. It's
impossible,” said Mrs. Gradgrind, with a mingled sense
of politeness and injury, “to be constantly addressing
him and never giving him a name. I cannot call him
Josiah, for the name is insupportable to me. You your-
self wouldn't hear of Joe, you very well know. Am I
to call my own son-in-law Mister. Not, I believe, unless
the time has arrived when, as an invalid, I am to be
trampled upon by my relations. Then, what am I to
call him!”
Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the
remarkable emergency, Mrs. Gradgrind departed this
life for the time being, after delivering the following
codicil to her remarks already executed:
“As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is—and I ask it
with a fluttering in my chest, which actually extends to
the soles of my feet—that it may take place soon.
Otherwise, I know it is one of those subjects I shall
never hear the last of.”
When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby,
Sissy had suddenly turned her head, and looked, in
wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in a multitude of
emotions, towards Louisa. Louisa had known it, and
seen it, without looking at her. From that moment she
was impassive, proud and cold-held Sissy at a distance-
changed to her altogether.

CHAPTER XVI.
HUSBAND AND WIFE.
MR. BOUNDERBY's first disquietude on hearing of his
happiness was occasioned by the necessity of imparting
it to Mrs. Sparsit. He could not make up his mind how
to do that, or what the consequences of the step might
be. Whether she would instantly depart, bag and bag-
gage, to Lady Scadgers, or would positively refuse to
budge from the premises; whether she would be plain-
tive or abusive, tearful or tearing; whether she would
break her heart, or break the looking-glass; Mr. Bound-
erby could not at all foresee. However, as it must be
done, he had no choice but to do it; so, after attempting
several letters, and failing in them all, he resolved to
do it by word of mouth.
On his way home, on the evening he set aside for this
momentous purpose, he took the precaution of stepping
into a chemist's shop and buying a bottle of the very
strongest smelling-salts. “By George!” said Mr. Boun-
derby, "if she takes it in the fainting way, I'll have
the skin off her nose, at all events!" But, in spite of
being thus forearmed, he entered his own house with
anything but a courageous air; and appeared before
the object of his misgivings, like a dog who was con-
scious of coming direct from the pantry.
“Good-evening Mr. Bounderby!”
“Good-evening, ma'am, good-evening.” He drew up
his chair, and Mrs. Sparsit drew back hers, as who
should say, “Your fireside, sir. I freely admit it. It
is for you to occupy it all, if you think proper.”
“Don't go to the North Pole, ma'am!” said Mr. Boun-
derby.
“Thank you, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit, and returned,
though short of her former position.
Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her, as, with the points
of a stiff, sharp pair of scissors, she picked out holes for
some inscrutable ornamental purpose, in a piece of
cambric. An operation which, taken in connection with
the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose, sugyastel

with some liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon
the eyes of a tough little bird. She was so steadfastly
occupied that many minutes elapsed before she looked
up from her work: when she did so, Mr. Bounderby be-
spoke her attention with a hitch of his head.
“Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am,” said Mr. Bounderby, putting
his hands in his pockets, and assuring himself with his
right hand that the cork of the little bottle was ready
for use, “I have no occasion to say to you that you are
not only a lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible
woman.”
"Sir,” returned the lady, “this is indeed not the first
time that you have honoured me with similar expres-
sions of your good opinion.”
“Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am,” said Mr. Bounderby, “I am
going to astonish you.”
“Yes, sir?" returned Mrs. Sparsit, interrogatively,
and in the most tranquil manner possible. She gen-
erally wore mittens, and she now laid down her work
and smoothed those mittens.
“I am going, ma'am,” said Bounderby,“ to marry Tom
Gradgrind's daughter."
“Yes, sir?" returned Mrs. Sparsit. “I hope you may
be happy, Mr. Bounderby. Oh, indeed I hope you may
be happy, sir!" And she said it with such great conde-
scension, as well as with such great compassion for him,
that Bounderby-far more disconcerted than if she had
thrown her work-box at the mirror, or swooned on the
hearth-rug-corked up the smelling-salts tight in his
pocket, and thought, "Now, confound this woman, who
could have ever guessed that she would take it in this
way!"
"I wish with all my heart, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit, in
a highly superior manner; somehow she seemed, in a
moment, to have established a right to pity him ever
afterwards; “that you may be in all respects very
happy.”
* Well, ma’am,” returned Bounderby, with some re-
sentment in his tone, which was clearly lowered, though
in spite of himself, “ I am obliged to you. I hope I shall
“Do you, sir!” said Mrs. Sparsit, with great affability.

ceeded. Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her work, and
occasionally gave a small cough, which sounded like the
cough of conscious strength and forbearance.
“Well, ma'am,” resumed Bounderby, “under these
circumstances, I imagine it would not be agreeable to a
character like yours to remain here, though you would
be very welcome here?”
"Oh, dear, no, sir, I could on no account think of that!"
Mrs. Sparsit shook her head, still in her highly superior
manner, and a little changed the small cough-coughing
now as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her, but had
better be coughed down.
“However, ma'am,” said Bounderby, “there are
apartments at the Bank where a born and bred lady, as
keeper of the place, would be rather a catch than other-
wise; and if the same terms,”
“I beg your pardon, sir. You were so good as to
promise that you would always substitute the phrase,
annual compliment.”
“Well, ma'am, annual compliment. If the same an-
nual compliment would be acceptable there, why, I see
nothing to part us unless you do.”.
“Sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, “the proposal is like
yourself, and if the position I shall assume at the Bank
is one that I could occupy without descending lower in
the social scale”
“Why, of course it is,” said Bounderby. “If it was
not, ma'am, you don't suppose I should offer it to a lady
who has moved in the society you have moved in. Not
that I care for such society, you know! But you do."
“ Mr. Bounderby, you are very considerate.”
“You'll have your own private apartments, and you'll
have your coals and your candles and all the rest of it,
and you'll have your maid to attend upon you, and you'll
have your light porter to protect you, and you'll be what
I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable,"
said Bounderby.
“Sir,” rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, "say no more. In yield-
ing up my trust here, I shall not be freed from the
necessity of eating the bread of dependence:” she might
have said the sweetbread, for that delicate article in a
savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: “ and I
would rather receive it from your hand than from any
other. Therefore, sir, I accept your offer gratefully,

and with many sincere acknowledgments for past
favours. And I hope, sir," said Mrs. Sparsit, conclud-
ing in an impressively compassionate manner, “I fondly
hope that Miss Gradgrind may be all you desire and
deserve!”
Nothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any
more. It was in vain for Bounderby to bluster, or to
assert himself in any of his explosive ways; Mrs. Sparsit
was resolved to have compassion on him, as a Victim.
She was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the
more polite, the more obliging, the more cheerful, the
more hopeful, the more exemplary altogether, she; the
forlorner Sacrifice and Victim, he. She had that tender-
ness for his melancholy fate, that his great red counte-
nance used to break out into cold perspirations when she
looked at him.
Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemn-
ised in eight weeks' time, and Mr. Bounderby went
every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted wooer.
Love was made on these occasions in the form of brace-
lets; and, on all occasions during the period of betrothal,
took a manufacturing aspect. Dresses were made,
jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were made, set-
tlements were made, and an extensive assortment of
Facts did appropriate honour to the contract. The busi-
ness was all Fact, from first to last. The Hours did
not go through any of those rosy performances which
foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times; neither
did the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other
seasons. The deadly statistical recorder in the Grad-
grind observatory knocked every second on the head
as it was born, and buried it with his accustomed regu-
larity.
So the day came, as all other days come to people who
will only stick to reason; and when it came, there were
married in the church of the florid wooden legs—that
popular order of architecture-Josiah Bounderby,
Esquire, of Coketown, to Louisa, eldest daughter of
Thomas Gradgrind, Esquire, of Stone Lodge, M. P. for
that borough. And when they were united in holy
matrimony, they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge
aforesaid.
There was an improving party assembled on the au-
spicious occasion, who knew what everything they had

to eat and drink was made of, and how it was imported
or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bot-
toms, whether native or foreign, and all about it. The
bridesmaids, down to little Jane Gradgrind, were, in an
intellectual point of view, fit helpmates for the calcu-
lating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of the
company.
After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in
the following terms:
“ Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of
Coketown. Since you have done my wife and myself
the honour of drinking our healths and happiness, I
suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you
all know me, and know what I am, and what my ex-
traction was, you won't expect a speech from a man who,
when he sees a Post, says that's a Post,' and when he
sees a Pump, says that's a Pump,' and is not to be got
to call a Post a Pump, or a Pump a Post, or either of
them a Toothpick. If you want a speech this morning,
my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a Mem-
ber of Parliament, and you know where to get it. I am
not your man. However, if I feel a little independent
when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how
little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind's daughter
when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his
face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than
once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused. So, I hope
you like my feeling independent; if you don't, I can't
help it. I do feel independent. Now I have mentioned,
and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to
Tom Gradgrind's daughter. I am very glad to be so. It
has long been my wish to be so. I have watched her
bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me. At the
same time-not to deceive you-I believe I am worthy
of her. So, I thank you, on both our parts, for the good-
will you have shown towards us; and the best wish I
can give the unmarried part of the present company, is
this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I
have found. And I hope every spinster may find as
good a husband as my wife has found.”
Shortly after which oration, as they were going on a
nuptial trip to Lyons, in order that Mr. Bounderby
might take the opportunity of seeing how the Hands
got on in those parts, and whether they, too, required to

be fed with gold spoons, the happy pair departed for
the railroad. The bride, in passing down stairs, dressed
for her journey, found Tom waiting for her-flushed,
either with his feelings or the vinous part of the break-
fast.
“What a game girl you are, to be such a first-rate
sister, Loo!” whispered Tom.
She clung to him, as she should have clung to some
far better nature that day, and was a little shaken in
her reserved composure for the first time.
“Old Bounderby's quite ready,” said Tom. “Time's
up. Good-bye! I shall be on the look-out for you,
when you come back. I say, my dear Loo! An't it
uncommonly jolly now?”

CHAPTER I.
EFFECTS IN THE BANK.
A SUNNY midsummer day. There was such a thing
sometimes, even in Coketown.
Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay
shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervi-
ous to the sun's rays. You only knew the town was
there, because you knew there could have been no such
sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town. A blur
of soot and smoke, now confusedly tending this way,
now that way, now aspiring to the vault of heaven,
now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose
and fell, or changed its quarter: a dense, forinless jum-
ble, with sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing
but masses of darkness:-Coketown in the distance was
suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be
seen.
The wonder was, it was there at all. It had been
ruined so often, that it was amazing how it had borne
so many shocks. Surely there never was such fragile
china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown
were made. Handle them never so lightly, and they fell
to pieces with such ease that you might suspect them of
having been flawed before. They were ruined, when
they were required to send labouring children to school;
they were ruined, when inspectors were appointed to
look into their works; they were ruined, when such in-
spectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite
justified in chopping people up with their machinery;
they were utterly undone, when it was hinted that per-
haps they need not always make quite so much smoke.
Besides Mr. Bounderby's gold spoon, which was gener-
ally received in Coketown, another prevalent fiction was

very popular there. It took the form of a threat.
Whenever a Coketowner felt he was ill-used--that is to
say, whenever he was not left entirely alone, and it was
proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences
of any of his acts-he was sure to come out with the
awful menace, that he would “sooner pitch his prop-
erty into the Atlantic.” This had terrified the Home
Secretary within an inch of his life, on several occasions.
However, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all,
that they never had pitched their property into the At-
lantic yet, but on the contrary, had been kind enough to
take mighty good care of it. So there it was, in the
haze yonder; and it increased and multiplied.
The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day,
and the sun was so bright that it even shone ihrough
the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown, and could
not be looked at steadily. Stokers emerged from low
underground doorways into factory yards, and sat on.
steps, and posts, and palings, wiping their swarthy vis-
ages, and contemplating coals. The whole town seemed
to be frying in oil. There was a stifling smell of hot
oil everywhere. The steam-engines shone with it, the
dresses of the Hands were soiled with it, the mills
throughout their many stories oozed and trickled
it. The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the
breath of the simoom; and their inhabitants, wasting
with heat, toiled languidly in the desert. But no tempera-
ture made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or
more sane. Their wearisome heads went up and down
at the same rate, in hot weather and cold, wet weather
and dry, fair weather and foul. The measured motion
of their shadows on the walls, was the substitute Coke-
town had to show for the shadows of rustling woods;
while for the summer hum of insects, it could offer, all
the year round, from the dawn of Monday to the night
of Saturday, the whirr of shafts and wheels.
Drowsily they whirred all this sunny day, making the
passenger more sleepy and more hot as he passed the
humming walls of the mills. Sun-blinds, and sprink-
lings of water, a little cooled the main streets and the
shops; but the mills and the courts and alleys, baked at a
fierce heat. Down upon the river that was black and thick
with dye, some Coketown boys who were at large-a
rare sight there-rowed a crazy boat, which made a

spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while
every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells. But the sun
itself, however beneficent generally, was less kind to
Coketown than hard frost, and rarely looked intently
into any of its closer regions without engendering more
death than life. So does the eye of Heaven itself be-
come an evil eye, when incapable or sordid hands are
interposed between it and the things it looks upon to
bless.
Mrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the
Bank, on the shadier side of the frying street. Office-
hours were over: and at that period of the day, in warm
weather, she usually embellished with her genteel pres-
ence a managerial board-room over the public office.
Her own private sitting-room was a story higher,
at the window of which post of observation she was
ready, every morning, to greet Mr. Bounderby, as he
came across the road, with the sympathising recog-
nition appropriate to a Victim. He had been married
now, a year; and Mrs. Sparsit had never released him
from her determined pity a moment.
The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome mo-
notony of the town. It was another red brick house,
with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black
street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and
a brazen door-handle full stop. It was a size larger
than Mr. Bounderby's house, as other houses were from
a size to half-a-dozen sizes smaller; in all other par-
ticulars it was strictly according to pattern.
Mrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the
evening tide among the desks and writing implements,
she shed a feminine, not to say also aristocratic, grace
upon the office. Seated, with her needle-work or netting
apparatus, at the window, she had a self-laudatory sense
of correcting, by her ladylike deportment, the rude
business aspect of the place. With this impression of
,her interesting character upon her, Mrs. Sparsit con-
sidered herself, in some sort, the Bank Fairy. The
townspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw
her there, regarded her as the Bank Dragon keeping
watch over the treasures of the mine.
What those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little
as they did. Gold and silver coin, precious paper,
secrets that if divulged would bring vague destruction

upon vague persons (generally, however, people whoin
she disliked), were the chief items in her ideal catalogue
thereof. For the rest, she knew that after office-hours
she reigned supreme over all the office furniture and
over a locked-up iron room with three locks, against the
door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his
head every night on a truckle bed that disappeared at
cockcrow. Further, she was lady paramount over cer-
tain vaults in the basement, sharply spiked off from
communication with the predatory world; and over the
relics of the current day's work, consisting of blots of
ink, worn-out pens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of
paper torn so small that nothing interesting could ever
be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit tried. Lastly,
she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and
carbines, arrayed in vengeful order above one of the
official chimney-pieces; and over that respectable tradi-
tion never to be separated from a place of business
claiming to be wealthy-a row of fire-buckets-vessels
calculated to be of no physical utility on any occasion,
but observed to exercise a fine moral influence, almost
equal to bullion, on most beholders.
A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed
Mrs. Sparsit's empire. The deaf serving-woman was
rumoured to be wealthy; and a saying had for years
gone about among the lower orders of Coketown, that
she would be murdered some night when the Bank was
shut, for the sake of her money. It was generally con-
sidered, indeed, that she had been due some time, and
ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life
and her situation with an ill-conditioned tenacity that
occasioned much offence and disappointment.
Mrs. Sparsit's tea was just set for her on a pert little
table, with its tripod of legs in an attitude, which she
insinuated after office-hours, into the company of the
stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that bestrode
the middle of the room. The light porter placed the
tea-tray on it, knuckling his forehead as a form of
homage.
“Thank you, Bitzer,” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“ Thank you, ma'am,” returned the light porter. He
was a very light porter indeed; as light as in the days
when he blinkingly defined a horse for girl number
twenty.

“ All is shut up, Bitzer?” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“ All is shut up, ma'am."
“And what,” said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her tea,
“is the news of the day? Anything?”
“Well, ma'am, I can't say that I have heard anything
particular. Our people are a bad lot, ma’am; but there
is no news, unfortunately."
“What are the restless wretches doing now?" asked
Mrs. Sparsit.
“Merely going on in the old way, ma'am. Uniting,
and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one another."
“It is much to be regretted,” said Mrs. Sparsit, mak-
ing her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Cori-
olanian in the strength of her severity, “that the united
masters allow of any such class-combinations."
"Yes, ma'am,” said Bitzer.
“Being united themselves, they ought one and all to
set their faces against employing any man who is united
with any other man,” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“ They have done that, ma'am,” returned Bitzer; “but
it rather fell through, ma'am.”
“I do not pretend to understand these things,” said
Mrs. Sparsit, with dignity, “my lot having been origi-
nally cast in a widely different sphere; and Mr. Sparsit,
as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any such
dissensions. I only know that these people must be con-
quered, and that it's high time it was done, once for all.”
“Yes, ma'am,” returned Bitzer, with a demonstration
of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit's oracular authority.
“You couldn't put it clearer, I am sure, ma'am.”
As this was his usual hour for having a little confi-
dential chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already
caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him
something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers,
inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with
her tea, glancing through the open window, down into
the street.
“Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?” asked Mrs. Sparsit.
“Not a very busy day, my lady. About an average
day.” He now and then slided into my lady, instead of
ma'am, as an involuntary acknowledgment of Mrs.
Sparsit's personal dignity and claims to reverence.

an imperceptible crumb of bread and butter from her

** Yes, ma'am, pretty fair, ma'am. With the usual
exception.”
He held the respectable office of general spy and in-
former in this establishment, for which volunteer
service he received a present at Christmas, over and
above his weekly wage. He had grown into an ex-
tremely clear-headed, cautious, prudent young man,
who was safe to rise in the world. His mind was so
exactly regulated, that he had no affections or passions.
All his proceedings were the result of the nicest and
coldest calculation; and it was not without cause that
Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him, that he was a
young man of the steadiest principle she had ever
known. Having satisfied himself, on his father's death,
that his mother had a right of settlement in Coketown,
this excellent young economist had asserted that right
for her with such a steadfast adherence to the principle
of the case, that she had been shut up in the workhouse
ever since. It must be admitted that he allowed her
half a pound of tea a year, which was weak in him:
first, because all gifts have an inevitable tendency to
pauperise the recipient, and secondly, because his only
reasonable transaction in that commodity would be to
buy it for as little as he could possibly give, and sell it
for as much as he could possibly get; it having been
clearly ascertained by philosophers that in this is com-
prised the whole duty of man-not a part of man's duty,
but the whole.
“Pretty fair, ma'am. With the usual exception,
ma'am,” repeated Bitzer.
“Ah-h!" said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head over
her tea-cup, and taking a long gulp.
“Mr. Thomas, ma'am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much,
ma'am, I don't like his ways at all."
“Bitzer,” said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive man-
ner, “ do you recollect my having said anything to you
respecting names?"
"I beg your pardon, ma'am. It's quite true that you
did object to names being used, and they're always best
avoided.”
“Please to remember that I have a charge here,” said
Mrs. Sparsit, with her air of state. “I hold a trust here,

Bitzer, under Mr. Bounderby. However improbable
both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it
years ago, that he would ever become my patron, making
me an annual compliment, I cannot but regard him in
that light. From Mr. Bounderby I have received every
acknowledgment of my social station, and every recog-
nition of my family descent, that I could possibly expect.
More, far more. Therefore, to my patron I will be
scrupulously true. And I do not consider, I will not
consider, I cannot consider,” said Mrs. Sparsit, with
a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality.
" that I should be scrupulously true, if I allowed
names to be mentioned under this roof, that are
unfortunately-most unfortunately-no doubt of that,
connected with his.”
Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged
pardon.
“No, Bitzer,” continued Mrs. Sparsit, “ say an indi-
vidual, and I will hear you; say Mr. Thomas, and you
must excuse me.”
“With the usual exception, ma'am,” said Bitzer, try-
ing back, “of an individual."
Ah-h!” Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the
shake of the head over her tea-cup, and the long gulp,
as taking up the conversation again at the point where
it had been interrupted.
“An individual, ma'am,” said Bitzer, “has never been
what he ought to have been since he first came into the
place. He is a dissipated, extravagant idler. He is not
worth his salt, ma'am. He wouldn't get it, either, if he
hadn't a friend and relation at court, ma'am!”
“Ah-h!” said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy
shake of her head.
“I only hope, ma’am,” pursued Bitzer, “ that his
friend and relation may not supply him with the means
of carrying on. Otherwise, ma'am, we know out of
whose pocket that money comes."
“Ah-h!" sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another mel-
ancholy shake of her head.
“He is to be pitied, ma'am. The last party I have al-
luded to is to be pitied, ma'am,” said Bitzer.
“Yes, Bitzer," said Mrs. Sparsit. “I have always
pitied the delusion, always.”
“As to an individual, ma'am,” said Bitzer, dropping

his voice and drawing nearer, “he is as improvident as
any of the people in this town. And you know what
their improvidence is, ma'am. No one could wish to
know it better than a lady of your eminence does.”
• They would do well,” returned Mrs. Sparsit, “to take
example by you, Bitzer.”_
“Thank you, ma'am. But, since you do refer to me,
now look at me, ma'am. I have put by a little, ma'am,
already. That gratuity which I receive at Christmas,
ma'am: I never touch it. I don't even go the length of
my wages, though they're not high, ma'am. Why can't
they do as I have done, ma'am? What one person can
do another can do.”
This, again, was among the fictions of Coketown.
Any capitalist there, who had made sixty thousand
pounds out of sixpence, always professed to wonder
why the sixty thousand nearest Hands didn't each make
sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, and more or less
reproached them every one for not accomplishing the
little feat. What I did you can do. Why don't you go
and do it?
“As to their wanting recreations, ma'am,” said Bitzer,
“it's stuff and nonsense. I don't want recreations. I
never did, and I never shall; I don't like 'em. As to
their combining together, there are many of them, I
have no doubt, that by watching and informing upon
one another could earn a trifle now and then, whether
in money or good will, and improve their livelihood.
Then why don't they improve it, ma’am? It's the first
consideration of a rational creature, and it's what they
pretend to want.”
“Pretend indeed!” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma'am, till it
becomes quite nauseous, concerning their wives and
families,” said Bitzer. “Why, look at me, ma’am! I
don't want a wife and family. Why should they?”
“Because they are improvident,” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“Yes, ma'am,” returned Bitzer, " that's where it is.
If they were more provident and less perverse, ma'am,
what would they do? They would say, 'While my hat
covers my family,' or 'while my bonnet covers my
family’-as the case might be, ma’am-'I have only
one to feed, and that's the person I most like to feed.""
“To be sure," assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin,

“ Thank you, ma'am,” said Bitzer, knuckling his forex
head again, in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit's
improving conversation. “Would you wish a little
more hot water, ma'am, or is there anything else that I
could fetch you.”
“Nothing just now, Bitzer."
“ Thank you, ma'am. I shouldn't wish to disturb you
at your meals, ma'am, particularly tea, knowing your
partiality for it,” said Bitzer, craning a little to look
over into the street from where he stood; “but there's
a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so,
ma'am, and he has come across as if he was going to
knock. That is his knock, ma’am, no doubt."
He stepped to the window; and looking out, and draw-
ing in his head again, confirmed himself with, “Yes,
ma'am. Would you wish the gentleman to be shown
in, ma'am?”
“I don' know who it can be,” said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping
her mouth and arranging her mittens.
“A stranger, ma'am, evidently.”
“What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time
of the evening, unless he comes upon some business
for which he is too late, I don't know,” said Mrs. Sparsit,
“but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr.
Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it. If to see
him is any part of the duty I have accepted, I will see
him. Use your own discretion, Bitzer."
Here the visitor, all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit's
magnanimous words, repeated his knock so loudly that
the light porter hastened down to open the door; while
Mrs. Sparsit took the precaution of concealing her little
table, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and
then decamped up-stairs that she might appear, if
needful, with greater dignity.
"If you please, ma'am, the gentleman would wish to
see you,” said Bitzer, with his light eye at Mrs. Sparsit's
keyhole. So, Mrs Sparsit, who had improved the in-
terval by touching up her cap, took her classical features
down-stairs again, and entered the board-room in the
manner of a Roman matron going outside the city
walls to treat with an invading general.
The visitor having strolled to the window, and being
then engaged in looking carelessly out, was as unmoved
by this impressive entry as man could possibly be. He

him. Use your own discretion, Bitzer.”
Here the visitor, all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit's
magnanimous words, repeated his knock so loudly that
the light porter hastened down to open the door; while
Mrs. Sparsit took the precaution of concealing her little
table, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and .
then decamped up-stairs that she might appear, if
needful, with greater dignity.
“If you please, ma'am, the gentleman would wish to
see you,” said Bitzer, with his light eye at Mrs. Sparsit's
keyhole. So, Mrs Sparsit, who had improved the in-
terval by touching up her cap, took her classical features
down-stairs again, and entered the board-room in the
manner of a Roman matron going outside the city
walls to treat with an invading general.
The visitor having strolled to the window, and being
then engaged in looking carelessly out, was as unmoved
by this impressive entry as man could possibly be. He

stood whistling to himself with all imaginable cool-
ness, with his hat still on, and a certain air of exhaus-
tion upon him, in part arising from excessive summer,
and in part from excessive gentility. For, it was to be
seen with half an eye that he was a thorough gentleman,
made to the model of the time; wary of everything, and
putting no more faith in anything than Lucifer.
"I believe, sir,” quoth Mrs. Sparsit, “you wished to
see me.”
“I beg your pardon,” he said, turning and removing
his hat; ""pray excuse me.”
“Humph!” thought Mrs. Sparsit, as she made a stately
bend. “Five-and-thirty, good-looking, good figure, good
teeth, good voice, good breeding, well-dressed, dark hair,
bold eyes.” All which Mrs. Sparsit observed in her
womanly way-like the Sultan who put his head in the
pail of water-merely in dipping down and coming up
again.
“Please to be seated, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“ Thank you. Allow me.” He placed a chair for her,
but remained himself carelessly lounging against the
table. “I left my servant at the railway looking after
the luggage—and strolled on, looking about me. Ex-
ceedingly odd place. Will you allow me to ask you if
it's always as black as this?”
“In general much blacker,” returned Mrs. Sparsit, in
her uncompromising way.
"Is it possible! · Excuse me: you are not a native, I
think?"
“No, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit. “It was once my
good or ill fortune, as it may be-before I became a
widow-to move in a very different sphere. My hus-
band was a Powler.”
“Beg your pardon, really!” said the stranger. “Was—?”
Mrs. Sparsit repeated, “A Powler.” “Powler Family,"
said the stranger, after reflecting a few moments. Mrs.
Sparsit signified assent. The stranger seemed a little
more fatigued than before.
“You must be very much bored here?” was the infer-
ence he drew from the communication.
“I am the servant of circumstances, sir,” said Mrs.
Sparsit, “and I have long adapted myself to the govern-
ing power of my life.”
"Very philosophical,” returned the stranger, “and

** to Assured inding meounderboyok town, wa fellow have
assume to be a shower-king people
very exemplary and laudable, and—” It seemed to be
scarcely worth his while to finish the sentence, so he
played with his watch-chain wearily.
“May I be permitted to ask, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit,
6 to what I am indebted for the favour of—”
“Assuredly,” said the stranger. “Much obliged to
you for reminding me. I am the bearer of a letter of
introduction to Mr. Bounderby, the Banker. Walking
through this extraordinary black town, while they were
getting dinner ready at the hotel, I asked a fellow whom
I met; one of the working people; who appeared to have
been taking a shower-bath of something fluffy, which I
assume to be the raw material,"
Mrs. Sparsit inclined her head.
66_Raw material—where Mr. Bounderby, the banker,
might reside. Upon which, misled no doubt by the word
Banker, he directed me to the Bank. Fact being, I pre-
sume, that Mr. Bounderby, the Banker, does not reside
in the edifice in which I have the honour of offering this
explanation."
"No, sir,” returned Mrs. Sparsit, “he does not.”
“Thank you. I had no intention of delivering my
letter at the present moment, nor have I. But strolling
on to the Bank to kill time, and having the good fortune
to observe at the window,” towards which he languidly
waved his hand, then slightly bowed, “a lady of a
very superior and agreeable appearance, I considered
that I could not do better than take the liberty of ask-
ing that lady where Mr. Bounderby, the Banker, does
live. Which I accordingly venture, with all suitable
apologies, to do.”
The inattention and indolence of his manner were
sufficiently relieved, to Mrs. Sparsit's thinking, by a cer-
tain gallantry at ease, which offered her homage too.
Here he was, for instance, at this moment, all but sit-
ting on the table, and yet lazily bending over her, as if
he acknowledged an attraction in her that made her
charming-in her way.
“ Banks, I know, are always suspicious, and officially
must be,” said the stranger, whose lightness and smooth-
ness of speech were pleasant likewise; suggesting matter
far more sensible and humourous than it ever contained
—which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of
this numerous sect, whosoever may have been that great

man: “therefore I may observe that my letter-here it
is-is from the member for this place-Gradgrind-
whom I have had the pleasure of knowing in London.”
Mrs. Sparsit recognised the hand, intimated that such
confirmation was quite unnecessary, and gave Mr. Boun-
derby's address, with all needful clues and directions
in aid.
“Thousand thanks,” said the stranger. “Of course
you know the Banker well?”
“ Yes, sir,” rejoined Mrs. Sparsit. “In my dependent
relation towards him, I have known him ten years.”
“Quite an eternity! I think he married Gradgrind's
daughter?”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Sparsit, suddenly compressing her
mouth, “he had that-honour.”
“ The lady is quite a philosopher, I am told?”
“Indeed, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit. “Is she?"
“Excuse my impertinent curiosity,” pursued the
stranger, fluttering over Mrs. Sparsit's eyebrows, with
a propitiatory air, but you know the family, and know
the world. I am about to know the family, and may
have much to do with them. Is the lady so very alarm-
ing? Her father gives her such a portentously hard-
headed reputation that I have a burning desire to know.
Is she absolutely unapproachable? Repellantly and
stunningly clever? I see, by your meaning smile, you
think not. You have poured balm into my anxious soul.
As to age, now. Forty! Five-and-thirty?”
Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright. “A chit,” said she.
“ Not twenty when she was married.”
“I give you my honour, Mrs. Powler,” returned the
stranger, detaching himself from the table, “that I
never was so astonished in my life!”
It really did seem to impress him, to the utmost extent
of his capacity of being impressed. He looked at his
informant for full a quarter of a minute, and appeared
to have the surprise in his mind all the time. “I assure
you, Mrs. Powler,” he then said, much exhausted, “ that
the father's manner prepared me for a grim and stony
maturity. I am obliged to you, of all things, for correct-
ing so absurd a mistake. Pray excuse my intrusion.
Many thanks. Good-day!”
He bowed himself out; and Mrs. Sparsit, hiding in
the window-curtain, saw him languishing down the

street on the shady side of the way, observed of all the
town.
“What do you think of the gentleman, Bitzer?" she
asked the light porter, when he came to take away.
“Spends a deal of money on his dress, ma'am.”
“It must be admitted," said Mrs. Sparsit, “ that it's
very tasteful.”
“Yes, ma'am,” returned Bitzer, “if that's worth the
money.”.
“Besides which, ma'am,” resumed Bitzer, while he
was polishing the table, “he looks to me as if he
gamed.”
“It's immoral to game," said Mrs. Sparsit. “It's
ridiculous, ma'am,” said Bitzer, “because the chances
are against the players.”
Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit
from working, or whether it was that her hand was out,
she did no work that night. She sat at the window,
when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she sat
there, when the smoke was burning red, when the color
faded from it, when darkness seemed to rise slowly out
of the ground, and creep upward, upward, up to the
house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of
the factory chimneys, up to the sky. Without a candle
in the room, Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window, with her
hands before her, not thinking much of the sounds of
evening: the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the
rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers,
the shrill street cries, the clogs upon the pavement when
it was their hour for going by, the shutting-up of shop-
shutters. Not until the light porter announced that her
nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse
herself from her reverie, and convey her dense black
eyebrows—by that time creased with meditation, as if
they needed ironing out-up-stairs.
“Oh, you Fool!” said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was alone
at her supper. Whom she meant, she did not say; but
she could scarcely have meant the sweetbread.

CHAPTER II.
MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE.
THE Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting
the throats of the Graces. They went about recruiting;
and where they could enlist recruits more hopefully
than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out
everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for
anything?
Moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this
sublime height were attractive to many of the Grad-
grind school. They liked fine gentlemen; they pre-
tended that they did not, but they did. They be-
came exhausted in imitation of them; and they yaw-
yawed in their speech like them; and they served out,
with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of po-
litical economy on which they regaled their disciples.
There never before was seen on earth such a wonderful
hybrid race as was thus produced.
Among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging
to the Gradgrind school, there was one of a good family
and a better appearance, with a happy turn of humour
which had told immensely with the House of Commons
on the occasion of his entertaining it with his (and the
Board of Directors') view of a railway accident, in which
the most careful officers ever known, employed by the
most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by the
finest mechanical contrivances ever devised, the whole
in action on the best line ever constructed, had killed
five people and wounded thirty-two, by a casualty with-
out which the excellence of the whole system would have
been positively incomplete. Among the slain was a
cow, and among the scattered articles unowned, a
widow's cap. And the honourable member had so
tickled the House (which has a delicate sense of humour)
by putting the cap on the cow, that it became impatient
of any serious reference to the Coroner's Inquest, and
brought the railway off with Cheers and Laughter.
Now, this gentleman had a younger brother of still
better appearance than himself, who had tried life as a

Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore; and had after-
wards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad,
and found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem,
and got bored there; and had then gone yachting about
the world, and got bored everywhere. To whom this
honourable and jocular member fraternally said one day,
“Jem, there's a good opening among the hard Fact fel-
lows, and they want men. I wonder you don't go in for
statistics.” Jem, rather taken by the novelty of the
idea, and very hard up for a change, was as ready to
“go in” for statistics as for anything else. So, he went
in. He coached himself up with a blue-book or two, and
his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows,
and said, “ If you want to bring in, for any place, a
handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech,
look after my brother Jem, for he's your man.” After
a few dashes in the public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind
and a council of political sages approved of Jem, and it
was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to become
known there and in the neighbourhood. Hence the
letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which
Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand, superscribed,
“Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown.
Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire.
Thomas Gradgrind.”
Within an hour of the receipt of this despatch and
Mr. Jame's Harthouse's card, Mr. Bounderby put on his
hat and went down to the hotel. There he found Mr.
James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of
mind so disconsolate, that he was already half disposed
to “go in" for something else.
“My name, sir,” said his visitor, “is Josiah Bounderby,
of Coketown."
Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though
he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure he had long
expected.
* Coketown, sir,” said Bounderby, obstinately taking
a chair, “ is not the kind of place you have been accus-
tomed to. Therefore, if you will allow me-or whether
you will or not, for I am a plain man--I'll tell you some-
thing about it before we go any further.”
Mr. Harthouse would be charmed.
“ Don't be too sure of that,” said Bounderby. “I
don't promise it. First of all, you see our smoke,

That's meat and drink to us. It's the healthiest thing
in the world in all respects, and particularly for the
lungs. If you are one of those who want us to consume
it, I differ from you. We are not going to wear the
bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear 'em
out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great
Britain and Ireland.”
By way of “going in ” to the fullest extent, Mr. Hart-
house rejoined, “Mr. Bounderby, I assure you I am
entirely and completely of your way of thinking. On
conviction.”
"I am glad to hear it,” said Bounderby. “Now, you
have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills, no
doubt. You have? Very good. I'll state the fact of it
to you. It's the pleasantest work there is, and it's the
lightest work there is, and it's the best paid work there
is. More than that, we couldn't improve the mills them-
selves, unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors.
Which we're not a-going to do.”
“Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.”
“Lastly,” said Bounderby, “as to our Hands. There's
not a hand in this town, sir, man, woman, or child, but
has one ultimate object in life. That object is, to be fed
on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon. Now,
they're not a-going—none of 'em-ever to be fed on
turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon. And now
you know the place.”
Mr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree
instructed and refreshed by this condensed epitome of
the whole Coketown question.
“Why, you see,” replied Mr. Bounderby, “it suits my
disposition to have a full understanding with a man, par-
ticularly with a public man, when I make his acquaint-
ance. I have only one thing more to say to you, Mr.
Harthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with
which I shall respond, to the utmost of my poor ability,
to my friend Tom Gradgrind's letter of introduction.
You are a man of family. Don't you deceive yourself
by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family.
I am a bit of dirty riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag,
rag, and bobtail."
If anything could have exalted Jem's interest in Mr.
Bounderby, it would have been this very circumstance.
Or, so he told him,

HARD TIMES.
“So, now," said Bounderby, “we may shake hands on
equal terms. I say equal terms because, although I
know what I am, and the exact depth of the gutter I
have lifted myself out of, better than any man does, I
am as proud as you are. I am just as proud as you are.
Having now asserted my independence in a proper man-
ner, I may come to how do you find yourself, and I hope
you're pretty well.”
The better, Mr. Harthouse gave him to understand as
they shook hands, for the salubrious air of Coketown.
Mr. Bounderby received the answer with favour.
“Perhaps you know,” said he, “or perhaps you don't
know, I married Tom Gradgrind's daughter. If you have
nothing better to do than to walk up town with me, I
shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind's
daughter.”
“Mr. Bounderby,” said Jem, “you anticipate my
dearest wishes."
They went out without further discourse; and Mr.
Bounderby piloted the new acquaintance who so strongly
contrasted with him, to the private red brick dwell-
ing, with the black outside shutters, the green inside
blinds, and the black street door up the two white
steps. In the drawing-room of which mansion, there
presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr.
James Harthouse had ever seen. She was so con-
strained, and yet so careless; so reserved and yet so
watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so sensitively
ashamed of her husband's braggart humility: from which
she shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a
blow; that it was quite a new sensation to observe
her. In face she was no less remarkable than in man-
ner. Her features were handsome; but their natural
play was so locked up, that it seemed impossible to
guess at their genuine expression. Utterly indifferent,
perfectly self-reliant, never at a loss, and yet never at
her ease, with her figure in company with them there,
and her mind apparently quite alone-it was of no use
“going in ” yet awhile to comprehend this girl, for she
baffled all penetration.
From the mistress of the house, the visitor glanced to
the house itself. There was no mute sign of a woman
in the room. No graceful little adornment, no fanciful
little device, however trivial, anywhere expressed her
straineful

119
influence. Cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and
doggedly rich, there the room stared at its present oc-
cupants, unsoftened and unrelieved by the least trace of
any womanly occupation. As Mr. Bounderby stood in
the midst of his household gods, so those unrelenting
divinities occupied their places around Mr. Bounderby,
and they were worthy of one another, and well
matched.
“ This, sir,” said Bounderby, “is my wife, Mrs. Boun-
derby: Tom Gradgrind's eldest daughter. Loo, Mr. James
Harthouse. Mr. Harthouse has joined your father's mus-
ter-roll. If he is not Tom Gradgrind's colleague before long
I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with
one of our neighbouring towns. You observe, Mr. Hart-
house, that my wife is my junior. I don't know what
she saw in me to marry me, but she saw something in
me, I suppose, or she wouldn't have married me. She
has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and other-
wise. If you want to cram for anything, I should be
troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo
Bounderby."
To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he
would be more likely to learn, Mr. Harthouse could never
be recommended.
“Come!” said his host. “If you're in the compli-
mentary line, you'll get on here, for you'll meet with no
competition. I have never been in the way of learning
compliments myself, and I don't profess to understand
the art of paying 'em. In fact, despise 'em. But your
bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real
thing, by George! You're a gentleman, and I don't pre-
tend to be one. I am Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown,
and that's enough for me. However, though I am not
influenced by manners and station, Loo Bounderby may
be. She hadn't my advantages—disadvantages you
would call 'em, but I call 'em advantages—so you'll not
waste your power, I dare say.”
“Mr. Bounderby,” said Jem, turning with a smile to
Louisa, “is a noble animal in a comparatively natural
state, quite free from the harness in which a conven-
tional ħack like myself works.”
“You respect Mr. Bounderby very much,” she quietly
returned. “It is natural that you should.”
He was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman

who had seen so much of the world, and thought, “Now
how am I to take this?”
“You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from
what Mr. Bounderby has said, to the service of your
country. You have made up your mind,” said Louisa,
still standing before him where she had first stopped-
in all the singular contrariety of her self-possession, and
her being obviously very ill at ease—“to show the na-
tion the way out of all its difficulties.”
“Mrs. Bounderby,” he returned, laughing, “upon my
honour, no. I will make no such pretence to you. I
have seen a little, here and there, up and down; I have
found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and
as some confess they have, and some do not; and I am
going in for your respected father's opinions—really be-
cause I have no choice of opinions, and may as well
back them as anything else.”
“Have you none of your own?” asked Louisa.
“I have not so much as the slightest predilection left.
I assure you I attach not the least importance to any
opinions. The result of the varieties of boredom I have
undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction is too in-
dustrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on
the subject), that any set of ideas will do just as much
good as any other set, and just as much harm as any
other set. There's an English family with a charming
Italian motto. What will be, will be. It's the only
truth going!”
This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty-a
vice so dangerous, so deadly, and so common-seemed,
he observed, a little to impress her in his favour. Hé
followed up the advantange, by saying in his pleasantest
manner: a manner to which she might attach as much
or as little meaning as she pleased: “The side that can
prove anything in a line of units, tens, hundreds, and
thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford the
most fun, and to give a man the best chance. I am
quite as much attached to it as if I believed it. I am
quite ready to go in for it, to the same extent as if I be-
lieved it. And what more could I possibly do, if I did
believe it!"
“You are a singular politician,” said Louisa.
“Pardon me; I have not even that merit. We are
the largest party in the state, I assure you, Mrs. Boun-

derby, if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were
reviewed together.”
Mr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting
in silence, interposed here with a project for postpon-
ing the family dinner till half-past six, and taking Mr.
James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits
to the voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown
and its vicinity. The round of visits was made; and
Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet use of his blue
coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a con-
siderable accession of boredom.
In the evening, he found the dinner-table laid for four,
but they sat down only three. It was an appropriate
occasion for Mr. Bounderby to discuss the flavour of
the hap'orth of stewed eels he had purchased in the
streets at eight years old; and also of the inferior water,
especially used for laying the dust, with which he had
washed down that repast. He likewise entertained his
guests over the soup and fish, with the calculation that
he (Bounderby) had eaten in his youth at least three
horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys. These
recitals, Jem, in a languid manner, received with
“charming!" every now and then; and they probably
would have decided him to “ go in ” for Jerusalem again
to-morrow morning, had he been less curious respecting
Louisa.
"Is there nothing,” he thought, glancing at her as she
sat at the head of the table, where her youthful figure,
small and slight, but very graceful, looked as pretty as
it looked misplaced; “is there nothing that will move
that face?"
Yes! By Jupiter, there was something, and here it
was, in an unexpected shape! Tom appeared. She
changed as the door opened, and broke into a beaming
smile.
A beautiful smile. Mr. James Harthouse might not
have thought so much of it, but that he had wondered
so long at her impassive face. She put out her hand-a
pretty little soft hand; and her fingers closed upon her
brother's, as if she would have carried them to her lips.
“Ay, ay?” thought the visitor. “This whelp is the
only creature she cares for. So, so!”
The whelp was presented, and took his chair. The ap-
pellation was not flattering, but not unmerited.

“When I was your age, young Tom," said Bounderby,
“I was punctual, or I got no dinner!”
“When you were my age,” returned Tom, “you
hadn't a wrong balance to get right, and hadn't to dress
afterwards.”
“Never mind that now," said Bounderby.
“Well, then,” grumbled Tom.“ Don't begin with me.”
“Mrs. Bounderby,” said Harthouse, perfectly hearing
this under-strain as it went on; “ your brother's face is
quite familiar to me. Can I have seen him abroad? Or
at some public school, perhaps?”
“No," she returned, quite interested, “he has never
been abroad yet, and was educated here, at home. Tom,
love, I am telling Mr. Harthouse that he never saw you
abroad.”
“No such luck, sir,” said Tom.
There was little enough in him to brighten her face,
for he was a sullen young fellow, and ungracious in his
manner even to her. So much the greater must have
been the solitude of her heart, and her need of some one
on whom to bestow it. " So much the more is this
whelp the only creature she has ever cared for,” thought
Mr. James Harthouse, turning it over and over. “So
much the more. So much the more.”
Both in his sister's presence, and after she had left the
room, the whelp took no pains to hide his contempt for Mr.
Bounderby, whenever he could indulge in it without the
observation of that independent man, by making wry
faces, or shutting one eye. Without responding to
these telegraphic communications, Mr. Harthouse en-
couraged him much in the course of the evening, and
showed an unusual liking for him. At last, when he
rose to return to his hotel, and was a little doubtful
whether he knew the way by night, the whelp immedi-
ately proffered his services as guide, and turned out
with him to escort him thither.

CHAPTER III.
THE WHELP.
It was very remarkable that a young gentleman who
had been brought up under one continuous system of
unnatural restraint should be a hypocrite; but it was
certainly the case with Tom. It was very strange that
a young gentleman who had never been left to his own
guidance for five consecutive minutes should be incap-
able at last of governing himself; but so it was with
Tom. It was altogether unaccountable that a young
gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his
cradle should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the
form of grovelling sensualities; but such a monster, be-
yond all doubt, was Tom.
“Do you smoke?” asked Mr. James Harthouse, when
they came to the hotel.
“I believe you,” said Tom.
He could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could
do no less than go up. What with a cooling drink
adapted to the weather, but not so weak as cool ; and
what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in
those parts; Tom was soon in a highly free and easy
state at his end of the sofa, and more than ever disposed
to admire his new friend at the other end.
Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking
a little while, and took an observation of his friend.
“He don't seem to care about his dress,” thought Tom,
“and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell
he is!”
Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom's eye,
remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass
with his own negligent hand.
“ Thank’ee,” said Tom. “Thank’ee. Well, Mr. Hart-
house, I hope you have had about a dose of old Boun-
derby to-night.” Tom said this with one eye shut up
again, and looking over his glass, knowingly, at his
entertainer.
“A very good fellow indeed!" returned Mr. James
Harthouse.

“You think so, don't you?” said Tom. And shut up
his eye again.
Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end
of the sofa and lounging with his back against the
chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-
grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down
at him, observed:
" What a comical brother-in-law you are !"
“What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I
think you mean," said Tom.
“ You are a piece of caustic, Tom,” retorted Mr. James
Harthouse.
There was something so very agreeable in being so
intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in
such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such
off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers ;
that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself.
“Oh! I don't care for old Bounderby,” said he, “ if
you mean that. I have always called old Bounderby by
the same name when I have talked about him, and I
have always thought of him in the same way. I am
not going to begin to be polite now, about old Bounder-
by. It would be rather late in the day.”
“Don't mind me,” returned James; “but take care
when his wife is by, you know.”
“His wife?" said Tom. “My sister Loo? Oh, yes!”
And he laughed, and took a little more of the cooling
drink.
James Harthouse continued to lounge in the same
place and attitude, smoking his cigar in his own easy
way, and looking pleasantly at the whelp, as if he knew
himself to be a kind of agreeable demon who had only
to hover over him, and he must give up his whole soul
if required. It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded
to this influence. He looked at his companion sneak-
ingly, he looked at him admiringly, he looked at him
boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa.
“My sister Loo?" said Tom. “She never cared for old
Bounderby.”
“ That's the past tense, Tom," returned Mr. James
Harthouse, striking the ash from his cigar with his little
finger. “We are in the present tense, now.”
“Verb neuter, not to care. Indicative mood, present
tense. First person singular, I do not care; second per-
plans, and to be hin, and

son singular, thou dost not care; third person singular,
she does not care," returned Tom.
“Good! Very quaint!” said his friend. “Though you
don't mean it."
“But I do mean it,” cried Tom. “Upon my honor!
Why, you won't tell me, Mr. Harthouse, that you really
suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby.”
“My dear fellow," returned the other, “what am I
bound to suppose, when I find two married people living
in harmony and happiness?"
Tom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa. If
his second leg had not been already there when he was
called a dear fellow, he would have put it up at that
great stage of the conversation. Feeling it necessary to
do something then, he stretched himself out at greater
length, and reclining with the back of his head on the
end of the sofa, and smoking with an infinite assump-
tion of negligence, turned his common face, and not too
sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him so
carelessly yet so potently.
“You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse," said Tom,
"and therefore you needn't be surprised that Loo mar-
ried old Bounderby. She never had a lover, and the
governor proposed old Bounderby, and she took him.”
“Very dutiful in your interesting sister,” said Mr.
James Harthouse.
“Yes, but she wouldn't have been as dutiful, and it
would not have come off as easily,” returned the whelp,
“if it hadn't been for me.”
The tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp
was obliged to go on.
“I persuaded her,” he said, with an edifying air of
superiority. “I was stuck into old Bounderby's bank
(where I never wanted to be), and I knew I should get
into scrapes there, if she put old Bounderby's pipe out;
so I told her my wishes, and she came into them. She
would do anything for me. It was very game of her,
wasn't it?”
“It was charming, Tom!”
“Not that it was altogether so important to her as it
was to me,” continued Tom coolly, because my liberty
and comfort, and perhaps my getting on, depended on
it; and she had no other lover, and staying at home was
like staying in jail-especially when I was gone. It

wasn't as if she gave up another lover for old Bounderby;
but still it was a good thing in her.”
“Perfectly delightful. And she gets on so placidly."
“Oh,” returned Tom, with contemptuous patronage,
"she's a regular girl. A girl can get on anywhere. She
has settled down to the life, and she don't mind. It does
just as well as another. Besides, though Loo is a girl,
she's not a common sort of a girl. She can shut herself
up within herself, and think-as I have often known her
to sit and watch the fire-for an hour at a stretch.” .
“ Ay, ay? Has resources of her own,” said Harthouse,
smoking quietly.
“Not so much of that as you may suppose,” returned
Tom; “ for our governor had her crammed with all sorts
of dry bones and sawdust. It's his system.”
“Formed his daughter on his own model?” suggested
Harthouse.
“His daughter? Ah! and everybody else. Why, he
formed Me that way," said Tom.
“Impossible!”
“He did though,” said Tom, shaking his head. “I
mean to say, Mr. Harthouse, that when I first left home
and went to old Bounderby's, I was as flat as a warming-
pan, and knew no more about life than an oyster does.”
"Come, Tom! I can hardly believe that. A jokes a
joke."
“Upon my soul!” said the whelp. “I am serious; I
am indeed!" He smoked with great gravity and dignity
for a little while, and then added, in a highly complacent
tone, “ Oh! I have picked up a little, since. I don't deny
that. But I have done it myself; no thanks to the gov-
ernor.”
“ And your intelligent sister?”
“My intelligent sister is about where she was. She
used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back
upon, that girls usually fall back upon; and I don't see
how she is to have got over that since. But she don't
mind,” he sagaciously added, puffing at his cigar again.
“Girls can always get on, somehow."
“ Calling at the Bank yesterday evening, for Mr.
Bounderby's address, I found an ancient lady there, who
seems to entertain great admiration for your sister,"
observed Mr. James Harthouse, throwing away the last
small remnant of the cigar he had now smoked out,

"Mother Sparsit?" said Tom. “What! you have seen
her already, have you?”
His friend nodded. Tom took his cigar out of his
mouth, to shut up his eye (which had grown rather un-
manageable) with the greater expression, and to tap his
nose several times with his finger.
"Mother Sparsit's feeling for Loo is more than admir-
ation, I should think,” said Tom. “Say affection and
devotion. Mother Sparsit never set her cap at Boun-
derby when he was a bachelor. Oh, no!"
These were the last words spoken by the whelp, before
a giddy drowsiness came upon him, followed by com-
plete oblivion. He was roused from the latter state by
an uneasy dream of being stirred up with a boot, and
also of a voice saying: “ Come, it's late. Be off!”
“ Well!” he said, scrambling from the sofa. “I must
take my leave of you, though. I say. Yours is very
good tobacco. But it's too mild.”
“Yes, it's too mild,” returned his entertainer.
“It's—it's ridiculously mild," said Tom. “Where's
the door? Good-night!”
He had another odd dream of being taken by a waiter
through a mist, which, after giving him some trouble
and difficulty, resolved itself into the main street, in
which he stood alone. He then walked home pretty
easily, though not yet free from an impression of the
presence and influence of his new friend-as if he were
lounging somewhere in the air, in the same negligent
attitude, regarding him with the same look.
The whelp went home, and went to bed. If he had had
any sense of what he had done that night, and had been
less of a whelp and more of a brother, he might have
turned short on the road, might have gone down to the
ill-smelling river that was dyed black, might have gone
to bed in it for good and all, and have curtained his head
forever with its filthy waters.

MEN AND BROTHERS.
“Oh, my friends, the down-trodden operatives of Cork-
town! Oh, my friends and fellow-countrymen, the slaves
of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism! Oh, my
friends and fellow-sufferers, and fellow-workmen, and
fellow-men! I tell you that the hour is come when we
must rally round one another as One united power, and
crumble into dust the oppressors that too long have bat-
tened upon the plunder of our families, upon the sweat
of our brows, upon the labour of our hands, upon the
strength of our sinews, upon the God-created glorious
rights of Humanity, and upon the holy and eternal privi-
leges of Brotherhood!”
“Good!” “ Hear, hear, hear!” “Hurrah!” and other
cries arose in many voices from various parts of the
densely crowded and suffocatingly close Hall, in which
the orator, perched on a stage, delivered himself of this
and what other froth and fume he had in him. He had
declaimed himself into a violent heat, and was as hoarse
as he was hot. By dint of roaring at the top of his voice
under a flaring gas-light, clenching his fists, knitting his
brows, setting his teeth, and pounding with his arms, he
had taken so much out of himself by this time, that he
was brought to a stop, and called for a glass of water.
As he stood there, trying to quench his fiery face with
his drink of water, the comparison between the orator
and the crowd of attentive faces turned towards him was
extremely to his disadvantage. Judging him by Nature's
evidence, he was above the mass in very little but the
stage on which he stood. In many great respects he was
essentially below them. He was not so honest, he was
not so manly, he was not so good-humoured; he substi-
tuted cunning for their simplicity, and passion for their
safe solid sense. An ill-made, high-shouldered man,
with lowering brows, and his features crushed into an
habitually sour expression, he contrasted most unfavour-
ably, even in his mongrel dress, with the great body of

his hearers in their plain working clothes. Strange as it
always is to consider any assembly in the act of sub-
missively resigning itself to the dreariness of some com-
placent person, lord or commoner, whom three-fourths
of it could, by no human means, raise out of the slough
of inanity to their own intellectual level, it was particu-
larly strange, and it was even particularly affecting, to
see this crowd of earnest faces, whose honesty in the
main no competent observer free from bias could doubt,
so agitated by such a leader.
Good! Hear, hear! Hurrah! The eagerness, both of
attention and intention, exhibited in all the counte-
nances, made them a most impressive sight. There was
no carelessness, no languor, no idle curiosity; none of
the many shades of indifference to be seen in all other
assemblies, visible for one moment there. That every
man felt his condition to be, somehow or other, worse
than it might be; that every man considered it incum-
bent on him to join the rest, towards the making of it
better; that every man felt his only hope to be in his
allaying himself to the comrades by whom he was sur-
rounded; and that in this belief, right or wrong (unhap-
pily wrong then), the whole of that crowd were gravely,
deeply, faithfully in earnest; must have been as plain
to any one who chose to see what was there, as the bare
beams of the roof, and the whitened brick walls. Nor
could any such spectator fail to know in his own breast,
that these men, through their very delusions, showed
great qualities, susceptible of being turned to the hap-
piest and best account; and that to pretend (on the
strength of sweeping axioms, howsoever cut and dried)
that they went astray wholly without cause, and of
their own irrational wills, was to pretend that there
could be smoke without fire, death without birth, harvest
without seed, anything or everything produced from
nothing.
The orator having refreshed himself, wiped his cor-
rugated forehead from left to right several times with
his handkerchief folded into a pad, and concentrated
all his revived forces, in a sneer of great disdain and
bitterness.
“But, oh, my friends and brothers! Oh, men and
Englishmen, the down-trodden operatives of Coke-
town! What shall we say of that man-that working-

man, that I should find it necessary to so libel the glori-
ous name—who, being practically and well acquainted
with the grievances and wrongs of you, the injured
pith and marrow of this land, and having heard you,
with a noble and majestic unanimity that will make
Tyrants tremble, resolve for to subscribe to the funds of
the United Aggregate Tribunal, and to abide by the
injunctions issued by that body for your benefit, what-
ever they may be—what, I ask you, will you say of that
working-man, since such I must acknowledge him to
be, who, at such a time, deserts his post, and sells his
flag; who, at such a time turns a traitor and a craven
and a recreant; who, at such a time, is not ashamed to
make to you the dastardly and humiliating avowal that
he will hold himself aloof, and will not be one of those
associated in the gallant stand for Freedom and for
Right?"
The assembly was divided at this point. There were
some groans and hisses, but the general sense of honour
was too much for the condemnation of a man unheard.
“Be sure you're right, Slackbridge!” “Put him up!"
“Let's hear him!” such things were said on many sides.
Finally, one strong voice called out, “Is the man heer?
If the man's heer, Slackbridge, let's hear the man him-
seln, 'stead o'yo.” Which was received with a round
of applause.
Slackbridge, the orator, looked about him with a
withering smile; and, holding out his right hand at
arm's length (as the manner of all Slackbridges is), to
still the thundering sea, waited until there was a pro-
found silence.
“Oh, my friends and fellow-men!” said Slackbridge
then, shaking his head with violent scorn, “I do not
wonder that you, the prostrate sons of labour, are in-
credulous of the existence of such a man. But he who
sold his birthright for a mess of pottage existed, and
Judas Iscariot existed, and Castlereagh existed, and this
man exists!"
Here a brief press and confusion near the stage ended
in the man himself standing at the orator's side be-
fore the concourse. He was pale and a little moved in
the face—his lips especially showed it; but he stood
quiet, with his left hand at his chin, waiting to be
heard. There was a chairman to regulate the proceed-
nder that the chiestoran

“My friends," said he, “ by virtue o’my office as your
president, I ashes o' our friend Slackbridge, who may
be a little over hetter in this business, to take his seat,
whiles this man Stephen Blackpool is heern. You all
know this man Stephen Blackpool. You know him
awlung o’his misfort'ns, and his good name.”
With that the chairman shook him frankly by the
hand, and sat down again. Slackbridge likewise sat
down, wiping his hot forehead-always from left to
right, and never the reverse way.
*My friends,” Stephen began, in the midst of a dead
calm; “I ha' hed what's been spok’n o' me, and 'tis lickly
that I shan't mend it. But I'd liefer you'd hearn the
truth concernin' myseln, fro my lips than fro onny other
man's though I never cud'n speak afore so monny, wi’out
bein' moydert and muddled."
Slackbridge shook his head as if he would shake it off,
in his bitterness.
“I'm th’ one single Hand in Bounderby's mill, o' a'
the men theer, as don't coom in wi' th' proposed
reg'lutions. I canna' coom in' wi' 'em. My friends, I
doubt their doin' yo onny good. Licker they'll do yo
hurt.”
Slackbridge laughed, folded his arms, and frowned
sarcastically.
“But’t ant sommuch for that as I stands out. If that
were aw, I'd coom in wi’ th' rest. But I ha' my reasons
-mine, yo see—for being hindered; not on'y now, but
awlus-awlus-life long!”
Slackbridge jumped up and stood beside him, gnash-
ing and tearing. “Oh, my friends, what but this did I
tell you? Oh, my fellow-countrymen, what warning but
this did I give you? And how shows this recreant con-
duct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to
have fallen heavy? Oh, you Englishmen, I ask you
how does this subornation show in one of yourselves,
who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours,
and to your children's and your children's children's?”
There was some applause, and some crying of Shame
upon the man; but the greater part of the audience were
quiet. They looked at Stephen's worn face, rendered
more pathetic by the homely emotions it evinced; and

in the kindness of their nature, they were more sorry
than indignant.
“? Tis this Delegate's trade for t speak,” said Stephen,
“an he's paid for 't, an he knows his work. Let him
keep to 't. Let him give no heed to what I ha had’n to
bear. That's not for him. That's not for nobody but
me.”
There was a propriety, not to say a dignity, in these
words, that made the hearers yet more quiet and atten-
tive. The same strong voice called out, “Slackbridge,
let the man be heern, and howd thee tongue!" Then the
place was wonderfully still.
“My brothers,” said Stephen, whose low voice was
distinctly heard, “and my fellow-workmen-for that yo
are to me, though not, as I knows on, to this delegate
heer-I ha but a word to sen, and I could sen nommore
if I was to speak till Strike o' day. I know weel, aw
what's afore me. I know weel that yo are aw resolve
to ha nommore ado wi' a man who is not wi' yo in this
matther! I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i? th?
road, yo'd feel it right to pass me by, as a forrenner and
stranger. What I ha getn, I mun mak th' best on.”
"Stephen Blackpool,” said the chairman, rising,
“think on 't agen. Think on 't once agen, lad, afore
thour't shunned by aw owd friends.”
There was an universal murmur to the same effect,
though no man articulated a word. Every eye was fixed
on Stephen's face! To repent of his determination,
would be to take a load from all their minds. He looked
around him, and knew that it was so. Not a grain of
anger with them was in his heart; he knew them, far
below their surface weaknesses and misconceptions, as
no one but their fellow-labourer could.
“I ha thowt on 't above a bit, sir. I simply canna
coom in. I mun go th’ way as lays afore me. I mun
tak my leave o' aw heer.”
He made a sort of reverence to them by holding up
his arms, and stood for the moment in that attitude:
not speaking until they slowly dropped at his sides.
“Monny's the pleasant word as soom heer has spok'n
wi' me; monny's the face I see heer, as I first seen when
I were yoong and lighter heart'n than now. I ha never

ca' me traitor and that-yo I mean t' say,” addressing
Slackbridge, “but 'tis easier to ca’ than mak' out. So
let be.”
He had moved away a pace or two to come down from
the platform, when he remembered something he had
not said, and returned again.
“Haply,” he said, turning his furrowed face slowly
about that he might as it were individually address the
whole audience, those both near and distant; “haply,
when this question has been tak’n up and discoosed,
there'll be a threat to turn out if I'm left to work
among yo. I hope I shall die ere ever such a time
cooms, and I shall work solitary among yo unless it
cooms-truly, I mun do't, my friends; not to brave yo,
but to live. I ha nobbut work to live by; and wheer-
ever can I go, I who ha worked sin I were no heighth
at aw, in Coketown heer? I mak' no complaints o’bein'
turned to the wa', o' being outcasten and overlooken
fro this time forrard, but I hope I shall be let to work.
If there is any right for me at aw, my friends, I think
'tis that.”
Not a word was spoken. Not a sound was audible in
the building, but the slight rustle of men moving a lit-
tle apart, all along the centre of the room, to open a
means of passing out, to the man with whom they had
all bound themselves to renounce companionship. Look-
ing at no one, and going his way with a lowly steadi-
ness upon him that asserted nothing and sought nothing,
Old Stephen, with all his troubles on his head, left the
scene.
Then Slackbridge, who had kept his oratorical arm
extended during the going out, as if he were repressing
with infinite solicitude and by a wonderful moral power
the vehement passions of the multitude, applied himself
to raising their spirits. Had not the Roman Brutus, oh,
my British countrymen, condemned his son to death;
and had not the Spartan mothers, oh, my soon to be vic-
torious friends, driven their flying children on the points
of their enemies' swords? Then was it not the sacred
duty of the men of Coketown, with forefathers before
them, an admiring world in company with them, and a
posterity to come after them, to hurl out traitors from
the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a Godlike.

Yes, east, west, north, and south. And consequently
three cheers for the United Aggregate Tribunal!
Slackbridge acted as fugleman, and gave the time.
The multitude of doubtful faces (a little conscience-
stricken) brightened at the sound, and took it up. Pri-
vate feeling must yield to the common cause. Hurrah!
The roof yet vibrated with the cheering, when the as-
sembly dispersed.
Thus easily did Stephen Blackpool fall into the lone-
liest of lives, the life of solitude among a familiar crowd.
The stranger in the land who looks into ten thousand
faces for some answering look and never finds it, is in
cheering society as compared with him who passes ten
averted faces daily, that were once the countenances of
friends. Such experiences was to be Stephen's now, in
every waking moment of his life; at his work, on his
way to it and from it, at his door, at his window, every-
where. By general consent, they even avoided that side
of the street on which he habitually walked; and left it,
of all the working men, to him only.
He had been for many years a quiet, silent man, asso-
ciating but little with other men, and used to compan-
ionship with his own thoughts. He had never known
before the strength of the want in his heart for the
frequent recognition of a nod, a look, a word; or the
immense amount of relief that had been poured into it
by drops, through such small means. It was even
harder than he could have believed possible, to separate
in his own conscience his abandonment by all his fellows
from a baseless sense of shame and disgrace.
The first four days of his endurance were days so long
and heavy, that he began to be appalled by the prospect
before him. Not only did he see no Rachael all the time,
but he avoided every chance of seeing her; for, although
he knew that the prohibition did not yet formally extend
to the woman working in the factories, he found that
some of them with whom he was acquainted were
changed to him, and he feared to try others, and dreaded
that Rachael might be even singled out from the rest if
she were seen in his company. So, he had been quite
alone during the four days, and had spoken to no one,
when, as he was leaving his work at night, a young
man of a very light complexion accosted him in the
street,

“Your name's Blackpool, ain't it?” said the young
man.
Stephen coloured to find himself with his hat in his
hand, in his gratitude for being spoken to, or in the
suddenness of it, or both. He made a feint of adjusting
the lining, and said, “Yes.”
“You are the Hand they have sent to Coventry, I
mean?” said Bitzer, the very light young man in question.
Stephen answered “Yes," again.
“I supposed so, from their all appearing to keep away
from you. Mr. Bounderby wants to speak to you. You
know his house, don't you?”
Stephen said “ Yes,” again.
“ Then go straight up there, will you?” said Bitzer.
“You're expected, and have only to tell the servant it's
you. I belong to the Bank; so, if you go straight up
without me (I was sent to fetch you), you'll save me a
walk.”
Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direc-
tion, turned about, and betook himself, as in duty bound,
to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby.
CHAPTER V.
MEN AND MASTERS.
“WELL, Stephen,” said Bounderby, in his windy man-
ner, “what's this I hear? What have these pests of the
earth been doing to you? Come in, and speak up.”
It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden.
A tea-table was set out; and Mr. Bounderby's young
wife, and her brother, and a great gentleman from
London, were present. To whom Stephen made his
obeisance, closing the door and standing near it, with
his hat in his hand.
“This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,”
said Mr. Bounderby. The gentleman he addressed, who
was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa, got up, say-
ing in an indolent way, “Oh really?” and dawdled to
the hearth-rug where Mr. Bounderby stood.
“Now,” said Bounderby, “speak up!"
After the four days he had passed, this address fell

rudely and discordantly on Stephen's ear. Besides be-
ing a rough handling of his wounded mind, it seemed
to assume that he really was the self-interested deserter
he had been called.
“What were it, sir,” said Stephen, “as yo were
pleased to want wi' me?”
“Why, I have told you,” returned Bounderby.
“s Speak up like a man, since you are a man, and tell us
about yourself and this Combination.”
“Wř yor pardon, sir,” said Stephen Blackpool, “I
ha' nowť to sen about it."
Mr. Bounderby, who was always more or less like a
Wind, finding something in his way here, began to
blow at it directly.
“Now, look here, Harthouse,” said he, “here's a
specimen of 'em. When this man was here once be-
fore, I warned this man against the mischievous
strangers who are always about-and who ought to be
hanged wherever they are found and I told this man
that he was going in the wrong direction. Now, would
you believe it, that although they have put this mark
upon him, he is such a slave to them still, that he's
afraid to open his lips about them?”
“I sed as I had nowt to sen, sir; nor as I was fearfo'
o' openin' my lips.”
“You said. Ah! I know what you said; more than
that, I know what you mean, you see. Not always the
same thing, by the Lord Harry! Quite different things.
You had better tell us, at once, that that fellow Slack-
bridge is not in the town, stirring up the people to
mutiny; and that he is not a regular qualified leader of
the people: that is, a most confounded scoundrel. You
had better tell us so at once; you can't deceive me. You
want to tell us so. Why don't you?”
“ I'm as sooary as yo, sir, when the people's leaders
is bad,” said Stephen, shaking his head. "They taks
such as offers. Haply 'tis na’ the sma’est o' their mis-
fortuns when they can get no better.”
The wind began to get boisterous.
“Now, you'll think this pretty well, Harthouse,” said
Mr. Bounderby. “You'll think this tolerably strong.
You'll say, upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of
what my friends have to deal with; but this is nothing,

Mr. Blackpool”—wind springing up very fast—“ may I
take the liberty of asking you how it happens that you
refused to be in this Combination?”
“How't happens?”
“Ah!” said Mr. Bounderby, with his thumbs in the
arms of his coat, and jerking his head and shutting his
eyes in confidence with the opposite wall: “how it hap-
pens.”
“I'd leefer not coom to 't, sir; but sin you put th' ques-
tion-an not want'n tbe ill-manner'n-I'll answer. I
ha passed a promess.”
“Not to me, you know," said Bounderby. (Gusty
weather with deceitful calms. One now prevailing.)
“Oh, no, sir. Not to yo.”
“ As for me, any consideration for me has had just
nothing at all to do with it,” said Bounderby, still in
confidence with the wall. “If only Josiah Bounderby
of Coketown had been in question, you would have joined
and made no bones about it?”
“Why, yes, sir. 'Tis true.”
“Though he knows,” said Mr. Bounderby, now blow-
ing a gale, “that these are a set of rascals and rebels
whom transportation is too good for! Now, Mr. Hart-
house, you have been knocking about in the world some
time. Did you ever meet with anything like that
man out of this blessed country?” And Mr. Boun-
derby pointed him out for inspection, with an angry
finger.
"Nay, ma'am,” said Stephen Blackpool, staunchly
protesting against the words that had been used, and
instinctively addressing himself to Louisa, after glanc-
ing at her face. “Not rebels, nor yet rascals. Nowt o'
th' kind, ma’am, nowt o'th' kind. They've not doon me
a kindness, ma'am, as I know and feel. But there's not
a dozen men amoong 'em, ma'am-a dozen? Not six-
but what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest
and by himseln. God forbid as I, that ha known, and

ett’n an drooken wiem, an seet'n wi' em, and toil'n wi?
em, and lov'n 'em, should fail fur to stan by 'em wi’ the
truth, let 'em ha doon to me what they may!"
He spoke with the rugged earnestness of his place and
character--deepened perhaps by a proud consciousness
that he was faithful to his class under all their mis-

trust; but he fully remembered where he was, and did
not even raise his voice.
“No, ma'am, no. They're true to one another, faithfo'
to one another, fectionate to one another, e’en to death.
Be poor amoong’em, be sick amoong’em, grieve amoong
'em for onny o’th' monny causes that carries grief to the
poor man's door, an they'll be tender wi' yo, gentle wi'
yo, comfortable wi' yo, Chrisen wi' yo. Be sure o' that,
ma'am. They'd be riven to bits, ere ever they'd be
different.
“In short,” said Mr. Bounderby, “it's because they are
so full of virtues that they have turned you adrift. Go
through with it while you are about it. Out with it."
“How 'tis, ma'am," resumed Stephen, appearing still
to find his natural refuge in Louisa's face, “that what is
best in us fok, seems to turn us most to trouble an mis-
fort'n an mistake, I dunno. But 'tis so. I know 'tis, as
I know the heavens is over me ahint the smoke. We're
patient too, an wants in general to do right. An' I
canna think the fawt is aw wi' us.”
“Now, my friend,” said Mr. Bounderby, whom he
could not have exasperated more, quite unconscious of
it though he was, than by seeming to appeal to any one
else, “if you will favor me with your attention for half
a minute, I should like to have a word or two with you.
You said just now that you had nothing to tell us about
this business. You are quite sure of that before we go
any further?”
“Sir, I am sure on't.”
“Here's a gentleman from London present," Mr.
Bounderby made a back-handed point at Mr. James
Harthouse with his thumb, “a Parliament gentleman.
I should like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between
you and me, instead of taking the substance of it-for I
know precious well, beforehand, what it will be; nobody
knows better than I do, take notice!—instead of receiv-
ing it on trust, from my mouth.”
Stephen bent his head to the gentleman from London,
and showed a rather more troubled mind than usual.
He turned his eyes involuntarily to his former refuge,
but at a look from that quarter (expressive though in-
stantaneous) he settled them on Mr. Bounderby's face.
“Now, what do you complain of?” asked Mr. Boun-
derby.

• I ha' not côom here, sir,” Stephen reminded him,
“ to complain. I coom for that I were sent for.”
“What,” repeated Mr. Bounderby, folding his arms,
“do you people, in a general way, complain of?”.
Stephen looked at him with some little irresolution
for a moment, and then seemed to make up his mind.
“Sir, I were never good at showin o't, though I ha
had'n any share in feeling o't. “Deed we are in a mud-
dle, sir. Look round town—so rich as 'tis and see the
numbers o' people as has been broughten into bein heer,
fur to weave, an to card, an to piece out a livin', aw
the same one way, somehows, twixt their cradles and
their graves. Look how we live, and wheer we live, an
in what numbers, an by what chances, and wi’ what
sameness; and look how the mills is awlus a goin, and
how they never works us no nigher to ony dis’ant object
-ceptin awlus Death. Look how you considers of us,
an writes of us, and talks of us, and goes up wi' yor
deputations to Secretaries o' State 'bout us, and how yo
are awlus right, and how we are awlus wrong, and never
had'n no reason in us sin ever we were born. Look how
*this ha growen an growen, sir, bigger an bigger, broader
an broader, harder an harder, fro year to year, fro
generation unto generation. Who can look on 't, sir,
and fairly tell a man 'tis not a muddle?”
“Of course," said Mr. Bounderby. Now perhaps
you'll let the gentleman know how you would set this
muddle (as you're so fond of calling it) to rights.” .
“Idonno, sir. I canna be expecten to’t. 'Tis not me
as should be looken to for that, sir. 'Tis them as is put
ower me, and ower aw the rest of us. What do they
tak upon themseln, sir, if not to do 't?”
“I'll tell you something towards it, at any rate,” re-
turned Mr. Bounderby. “We will make an example of
half-a-dozen Slackbridges. We'll indict the blackguards
for felony, and get 'em shipped off to penal settlements.”
Stephen gravely shook his head.
“Don't tell me we won't, man,” said Mr. Bounderby,
by this time blowing a hurricane, “because we will, 1
tell you!”
“Šir,” returned Stephen, with the quiet confidence of
absolute certainty, “if yo was t'tak a hundred Slack-
bridges-aw as there is, and aw the number ten times
towd-an was t' sew 'em up in separate sacks an sink

'em in the deepest ocean as were made ere ever dry
land coom to be, yo'd leave the muddle just wheer 'tis.
Mischeevous strangers!” said Stephen, with an anxious
smile; “ when ha we not heern, I am sure, sin ever we
can call to mind, o'th' mischeevous strangers! 'Tis not
by them the trouble's made, sir. 'Tis not wi' them 't
commences. I ha no favor for 'em-I ha no reason to
favor’em-but'tis hopeless and useless to dream o'takin
them fro their trade, 'stead o’takin their trade fro them!
Aw that's now about me in this room were heer afore I
coom, an will be heer when I am gone. Put that clock
aboard a ship an pack it off to Norfolk Island, an the
time will go on just the same. So 'tis wi' Slackbridge
every bit.”
Reverting for a moment to his former refuge, he ob-
served a cautionary movement of her eyes towards the
door. Stepping back, he put his hand upon the lock.
But he had not spoken out of his own will and desire; and
he felt it in his heart a noble return for his late injurious
treatment to be faithful to the last to those who had re-
pudiated him. He stayed to finish what was in his mind.
“Sir, I canna, wi' my little learning an my common
way, tell the genelman what will better aw this,
though some working men o' this town could, above my
powers—but I can tell him what I know will never do't.
The strong hand will never do’t. Vict’ry and triumph
will never do’t. Agreeing fur to mak one side unnat'rally
awlus and forever right, and toother side unnat’rally
awlus and forever wrong, will never, never do't. Nor
yet lettin' alone will never do't Let thousands upon
thousands alone, aw leadin' like lives and aw faw'en
into the like muddle, and they will be as one, and yo
will be as anoother, wi' a black unpassable world betwixt

last. Not drawin' nigh to fok wi' kindness and patience
and cheery ways, that so draws nigh to one another in

their distresses wi' what they need themseln-like, I
humbly believe, as no people the genelman ha' seen in
aw his travels can beat-will never do it till th' Sun
turns 't ice. Most o' aw, ratin 'em as so much Power,

nowt o'th' kind, an when aw goes onquiet reproachin
'em for their want o'sitch humanly feelins in their deal-
ins wi' yo—this will never do 't, sir, till God's work is
onmade.”
Stephen stood with the open door in his hand, waiting
to know if anything more were expected of him.
“Just stop a moment," said Mr. Bounderby, exces-
sively red in the face. “I told you the last time you
were here with a grievance, that you had better turn
about and come out of that. And I also told you, if
you remember, that I was up to the gold spoon look-
out.”
“I were not up to 't myseln, sir; I do assure yo.”
“Now it's clear to me,” said Mr. Bounderby, “ that
you are one of those chaps who have always got a
grievance. And you go about, sowing in, and rais-
ing crops. That's the business of your life, my friend.”
Stephen shook his head, mutely protesting that indeed
he had other business to do for his life.
“You are such a waspish, raspish, ill-conditioned chap,
you see," said Mr. Bounderby, “ that even your own
Union, the men who know you best, will have nothing
to do with you. I never thought those fellows could be.
right in anything; but I tell you what! I so far go along
with them for a novelty that I'll have nothing to do
with you either!"
Stephen raised his eyes quickly to his face.
“You can finish off what you're at,” said Mr. Boun-
derby, with a meaning nod, “and then go elsewhere."
“Sir, yo know weel,” said Stephen expressively, “ that
if I canna get work wi' yo, I canna get it elsewheer.”
The reply was, “What I know, I know; and what you
know, you know. I have no more to say about it.”
Stephen glanced at Louisa again, but her eyes were
raised to his no more; therefore, with a sigh, and saying,
barely above his breath, “Heaven help us aw in this
world!” he departed.

CHAPTER VI.
FADING AWAY.
It was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr.
Bounderby's house. The shadows of night had gathered
so fast, that he did not look about him when he closed
the door, but plodded straight along the street. Nothing
was further from his thoughts than the curious old
woman he had encountered on his previous visit to the
same house, when he heard a step behind him that he
knew, and, turning, saw her in Rachael's company.
He saw Rachael first, as he had heard her only.
“Ah, Rachael, my dear! Missus, thou wi' her!”
“Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with
reason, I must say,” the old woman returned. “Here I
am again, you see.”
“ But how wi' Rachael?” said Stephen, falling into
their step, walking between them, and looking from the
one to the other.
“Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much
as I came to be with you,” said the old woman, cheer-
fully taking the reply upon herself. “My visiting time
is later this year than usđal, for I have been rather
troubled with shortness of breath, and so put it off till
the weather was fine and warm. For the same reason
I don't make all my journey in one day, but divide it
into two days, and get a bed to-night at the Travellers'
Coffee House down by the railroad (a nice clean house),
and go back Parliamentary, at six in the morning.
Well, but what has this to do with this good lass, says
you? I'm going to tell you. I have heard of Mr. Boun-
derby being married. I read it in the paper, where it
looked grand-oh, it looked fine!" the old woman dwelt
on it with strange enthusiasm: “and I want to see his
wife. I have never seen her yet. Now, if you'll believe
me, she hasn't come out of that house since noon to-day.
So not to give her up too easily, I was waiting about, a
little last bit more, when I passed close to this good lass
two or three times; and her face being so friendly I
spoke to her, and she spoke to me. There!” said the

143
old woman to Stephen, “ you can make all the rest out
for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare
say!”
Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive
propensity to dislike this old woman, though her man-
ner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly
could be. With a gentleness that was as natural to him
as he knew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject
that interested her in her old age.
“ Well, missus,” said he, “I ha' seen the lady, and
she were yoong and hansom. Wir fine dark thinkin
eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha never seen the
like on.”
“ Young and handsome. Yes!” cried the old woman,
quite delighted. “As bonny as a rose! And what a
happy wife!"
*Aye, missus, I suppose she be,” said Stephen. But
with a doubtful glance at Rachael.
“ Suppose she be? She must be. She's your master's
wife,” returned the old woman.
Stephen nodded assent. “Though as to master,” said
he, glancing again at Rachael, “ not master onny more.
That's aw enden twixt him and me.”
“Have you left his work, Stephen?” asked Rachael,
anxiously and quickly.
“ Why, Rachael,” he replied, “whether I ha lef'n his
work, or whether his work ha lef'n me, cooms † th'
same. His work and me are parted. 'Tis as weel som
better, I were thinkin' when yo coom up wi' me. It
would ha brought'n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed
theer. Haply 'tis a kindness to monny that I go; haply
'tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it mun be done. I
mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th' time, and seek
a fort'n, dear, by beginnin fresh.”
“Where will you go, Stephen?”
“I dunno t'night,” said he, lifting off his hat, and
smoothing his thin hair with the flat of his hand. But
I'm not goin' t'night, Rachael, nor yet t'morrow. Tan't
easy overmuch, t' know wheer t' turn, but a good heart
will coom ť me.”
Herein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly
aided him. Before he had so much as closed Mr. Boun-
derby's door, he had reflected that at least his being
obliged to go away was good for her, as it would save

her from the chance of being brought into question for.
not withdrawing from him. Though it would cost him a
hard pang to leave her, and though he could think of no
similar place in which his condemnation would not pur-
sue him, perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away
from the endurance of the last four days, even to un-
known difficulties and distresses.
So he said, with truth, “I'm more leetsome, Rachael,
under 't, than I couldn ha believed.” It was not her part
to make his burden heavier. She answered with her
comforting smile, and the three walked on together.
Age, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and
cheerful, finds much consideration among the poor.
The old woman was so decent and contented, and made
so light of her infirmities, though they had increased
upon her since her former interview with Stephen, that
they both took an interest in her. She was too sprightly
to allow of their walking at a slow pace on her account,
but she was very grateful to be talked to, and very
willing to talk to any extent: so, when they came to
their part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious
than ever.
“Coom to my poor place, missus,” said Stephen, “and
tak a coop o' tea. Rachael will coom then ; and arter-
wards I'll see thee safe t'thy Travellers' lodgin. 'T may
be long, Rachael, ere ever I ha th' chance o' thy coom-
pany agen.”
They complied, and the three went on to the house
where he lodged. When they turned into a narrow
street, Stephen glanced at his window with a dread that
always haunted his desolate home; but it was open, as
he had left it, and no one was there. The evil spirit of
his life had flitted away again, months ago, and he had
heard no more of her since. The only evidences of her
last return now, were the scantier movables in his
room, and the grayer hair upon his head.
He lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got
hot water from below, and brought in small portions of
tea and sugar, a loaf, and some butter, from the nearest
shop. The bread was new and crusty, the butter fresh,
and the sugar lump, of course-in fulfilment of the
standard testimony of the Coketown magnates, that
these people lived like princes, sir. Rachael made the
tea (so large a party necessitated the borrowing of a

cup), and the visitor enjoyed it mightily. It was the
first glimpse of sociality the host had had for many
days. He, too, with the world a wide heath before him,
enjoyed the meal-again in corroboration of the mag-
nates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on
the part of these people, sir.
“Î ha never thowt yet, missus,” said Stephen, “O'
askin thy name.”
The old lady announced herself as “Mrs. Pegler."
“A widder, I think?” said Stephen.
“Oh, many long years!” Mrs. Pegler's husband (one
of the best on record) was already dead, by Mrs. Peg-
ler's calculation, when Stephen was born.
“ 'Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,” said
Stephen. “Onny children?”
Mrs. Pegler's cup, rattling against the saucer as she
held it, denoted some nervousness on her part. “No,'
she said. “Not now, not now.”
“Dead, Stephen,” Rachael softly hinted.
“I'm sooary I ha’spok’n on 't,” said Stephen, “I ought
t' hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place. I-I
blame myseln.”
While he excused himself, the old lady's cup rattled
more and more. “I had a son,” she said, curiously dis-
tressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sor-
row; “and he did well, wonderfully well. But he is not
to be spoken of, if you please. He is—” Putting down
her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have
added, by her action, “dead!” Then she said, aloud,
“I have lost him.”
Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given
the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling
up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whis-
pered in his ear. Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf,
for she caught a word as it was uttered,
“Bounderby!” she cried, in a suppressed voice, start-
ing up from the table. “Oh, hide me! Don't let me be
seen for the world. Don't let him come up till I've got
away. Pray, pray!” She trembled, and was excess-
ively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael
tried to reassure her; and not seeming to know what
she was about.
"But hearken, missus, hearken,” said Stephen, as-
tonished. “'Tisn't Mr. Bounderby; 'tis his wife. Yor

not fearfo'o'her. Yo was hey-go-mad about her, but an
hour sin.”
“But are you sure it's the lady, and not the gentle-
man?” she asked, still trembling.
“Certain sure!"
“Well, then, pray don't speak to me, nor yet take any
notice of me," said the old woman. “Let me be quite to
myself in this corner.”
Stephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explana-
tion, which she was quite unable to give him; took the
candle, went down-stairs, and in a few moments re-
turned, lighting Louisa into the room. She was followed
by the whelp.
Rachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and
bonnet in her hand, when Stephen, himself profoundly
astonished by this visit, put the candle on the table.
Then he too stood, with his doubled hand upon the table
near it, waiting to be addressed.
For the first time in her life, Louisa had come into one
of the dwellings of the Coketown hands; for the first
time in her life, she was face to face with anything like
individuality in connection with them. She knew of
their existence by hundreds and by thousands. She
knew what results in work a given number of them
would produce, in a given space of time. She knew
them in crowds passing to and from their nests, like ants
or beetles. But she knew from her reading infinitely
more of the ways of toiling insects than of these toiling
men and women.
Something to be worked so much and paid so much,
and there ended; something to be infallibly settled by
laws of supply and demand; something that blundered
against those laws, and floundered into difficulty; some-
thing that was a little pinched when wheat was dear,
and over-ate itself when wheat was cheap; something
that increased at such a rate of percentage, and yielded
such another percentage of time,' and such another
percentage of pauperism; something wholesale, of
which vast fortunes were made; something that occa-
sionally rose like a sea, and did some harm and waste
(chiefly to itself), and fell again; this she knew the
Coketown Hands to be. But she had scarcely thought
more of separating them into units, than of separating
the sea itself into its component drops.

147
She stood for some moments looking round the room.
From the chairs, the few books, the common prints,
and the bed, she glanced to the two women and to
Stephen.
“I have come to speak to you in consequence of what
passed just now. I should like to be serviceable to you,
if you will let me. Is this your wife?”
Rachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently an-
swered no, and dropped again.
“I remember,” said Louisa, reddening at her mistake;
“I recollect, now, to have heard your domestic mis-
fortunes spoken of, though I was not attending to the
particulars at the time. It was not my meaning to ask
a question that would give pain to any one here. If I
should ask any other question that may happen to have
that result, give me credit, if you please, for being in
ignorance how to speak to you as I ought.”
As Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively.
addressed himself to her, so she now instinctively ad-
dressed herself to Rachael. Her manner was short and
abrupt, yet faltering and timid.
“He has told you what has passed between himself
and my husband? You would be his first resource, I
think.”
“I have heard the end of it, young lady,” said
Rachael.
“Did I understand that, being rejected by one em-
ployer, he would probably be rejected by all? I thought
he said as much?”
“ The chances are very small, young lady-next to
nothing—for a man who gets a bad name among them.”
“What shall I understand that you mean by a bad
name?”
“ The name of being troublesome.”
“Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the
prejudices of the other, he is sacrificed alike? Are the
two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no
placé whatever for an honest workman between them?"
Rachael shook her head in silence.
“He fell into suspicion,” said Louisa, “with his
fellow-weavers, because he had made a promise not to
be one of them. I think it must have been to you that
he made that promise. Might I ask you why he made it?”
Rachael burst into tears. “I didn't seek it of him,

poor lad. I prayed him to avoid trouble for his own
good, little thinking he'd come to it through me. But I
know he'd die a hundred deaths, ere ever he'd break his
word. I know that of him well.”
Stephen had remained quietly attentive, in his usual
thoughtful attitude, with his hand at his chin. He now
spoke in a voice rather less steady than usual.
“No one, excepting myseln, can ever know what
honor, an what love, an respect, I bear to Rachael, or
wi' what cause. When I passed that promess, I towd
her true, she were th' Angel o' My life. 'Twere a solemn
promess. 'Tis gone fro' me, forever.”
Louisa turned her head to him, and bent it with a
deference that was new in her. She looked from him to
Rachael, and her features softened. .6 What will you
do?" she asked him. And her voice had softened too.
“ Weel, ma’am,” said Stephen, making the best of it,
with a smile; “ when I ha finished off, I mun quit this
part, an try another. Fortnet or misfortnet, a man can
but try; there's nowt to be done wi’out tryin'-cept lay-
ing down an dying,"
“How will you travel?”
“ Afoot, my kind ledy, afoot.”
Louisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand.
The rustling of a bank-note was audible, as she unfolded
one and laid it on the table.
“Rachael, will you tell him-for you know how, with-
out offence—that this is freely his, to help him on his
way? Will you entreat him to take it?”
"I canna do that, young lady,” she answered, turning
her head aside. “Bless you for thinking o' the poor lad
wi' such tenderness. But'tis for him to know his heart,
and what is right according to it.”
Louisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened,
in part overcome with quick sympathy, when this man
of so much self-command, who had been so plain and
steady through the late interview, lost his composure in
a moment, and now stood with his hand before his face.
She stretched out hers, as if she would have touched
him; then checked herself, and remained still,
"Not e'en Rachael,” said Stephen when he stood again
with his face uncovered, “could mak sitch a kind offerin,
by onny words, kinder. T'show that I'm not a man

action.”
She was fain to take up the note again, and to substi-
tute the much smaller sum he had named. He was
neither courtly, nor handsome, nor picturesque, in any
respect; and yet his manner of accepting it, and of ex-
pressing his thanks without more words, had a grace in
it that Lord Chesterfield could not have taught his son
in a century.
Tom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and
sucking his walking-stick with sufficient unconcern,
until the visit had attained this stage. Seeing his sister
ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put in
a word.
“Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should
like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into
my head. If you'll step out on the stairs, Blackpool,
I'll mention it. Never mind a light, man!” Tom was
remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cup-
board to get one. “It don't want a light.”
Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room
door, and held the lock in his hand.
“I say!” he whispered, “I think I can do you a good
turn. Don't ask me what it is, because it may not come
to anything. But there's no harm in my trying.”
His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen's ear, it
was so hot.
“That was our light porter at the Bank," said Tom,
“who brought you the message to-night. I call him
our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.”
Stephen thought, “ What a hurry he is in!” He spoke
so confusedly.
“Well!” said Tom. “Now, look here. When are you
off?"
“T'day's Monday,” replied Stephen, considering.
“Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigħ 'bout.”
“Friday or Saturday," said Tom. “Now, look here!
I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to
do you-that's my sister, you know, in your room-but
I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there's
no harm done. So I tell you what. You'll' know our
light porter again?”

“ Yes, sure,” said Stephen.
“ Very well,” returned Tom. “When you leave work
of a night, between this and your going away, just hang
about the Bank an hour or so, will you? Don't take on
as if you meant anything, if he should see you hanging
about there; because I shan't put him up to speak to you
unless I find I can do you the service I want to do you.
In that case he'll have a note or a message for you, but
not else. Now look here! You are sure you under-
stand?"
He had wormed a finger, in the darkness, through a
button-hole of Stephen's coat, and was screwing that
corner of the garment tight up, round and round, in an
extraordinary manner.
“I understand, sir,” said Stephen.
“Now, look here!” repeated Tom. “Be sure you don't
make any mistake then, and don't forget. I shall tell
my sister as we go home, what I have in view, and she'll
approve, I know. Now, look here! You're all right, are
you? You understand all about it? Very well, then.
Come along, Loo!”
He pushed the door open as he called to her, but did
not return into the room, or wait to be lighted down the
stairs. He was at the botttom when she began to de-
scend, and was in the street before she could take his arm.
Mrs. Pegler remained in her corner until the brother
and sister were gone, and until Stephen came back with
the candle in his hand. She was in a state of inexpress-
ible admiration of Mrs. Bounderby, and, like an unac-
countable old woman, wept, “ because she was such a
pretty dear.” Yet Mrs. Pegler was so flurried lest the
object of her admiration should return by chance, or
anybody else should come, that her cheerfulness was
ended for that night. It was late, too, to people who
rose early and worked hard; therefore the party broke
up; and Stephen and Rachael escorted their mysterious
acquaintance to the door of the Travellers' Coffee House,
where they parted from her.
They walked back together to the corner of the street
where Rachael lived, and as they drew nearer and nearer
to it, silence crept upon them. When they came to the
dark corner where their unfrequent meetings always
ended, they stopped, still silent, as if both were afraid
to speak,

“I shall strive t see thee agen, Rachael, afore I go,
but if not,”
“Thou wilt not, Stephen, I know. 'Tis better that we
make up our minds to be open wi' one another.”
“Thourt awlus right. 'Tis bolder and better. I ha
been thinkin then, Rachael, that as 'tis but a day or two
that remains, 'twere better for thee, my dear, not t be
seen wi' me. ''T might bring thee into trouble, fur no
good.”
"'Tis not for that, Stephen, that I mind. But thou
know'st our old agreement. 'Tis for that.”
“Well, well,” said he. "'Tis better, onnyways."
“Thou’lt write to me, and tell me all that happens,
Stephen?”
"Yes. What can I say now, but Heaven be wi’ thee,
Heaven bless thee, Heaven thank thee and reward
thee!”
"May it bless thee, Stephen, too, in all thy wanderings,
and send thee peace and rest at last!"
“I towd thee, my dear,” said Stephen Blackpool-
“that night—that I would never see or think o onny-
thing that angered me, but thou, so much better than
me, should'st be beside it. Thou’rt beside it now. Thou
mak'st me see it wi' a better eye. Bless thee. Good-
night. Good-bye!"
It was but a hurried parting in a common street, yet
it was a sacred remembrance to these two. common
people. Utilitarian economists, skeletons of school-
masters, Commissioners of Fact, genteel and used-up
infidels, gabblers of many little dog's-eared creeds, the
poor you will always have with you. Cultivate in them,
while there is yet time, the utmost graces of the fancies
and affections, to adorn their lives, so much in need of
ornament; or, in the day of your triumph, when romance
is utterly driven out of their souls, and they and a bare
existence stand face to face, Reality will take a wolfish
turn, and make an end of you.
Stephen worked the next day and the next, uncheered
by a word from any one, and shunned in all his com-
ings and goings as before. At the end of the second
day, he saw land; at the end of the third, his loom stood
empty.
He had overstayed his hour in the street outside the
Bank, on each of the two first evenings; and nothing

had happened there, good or bad. That he might not
be remiss in his part of the engagement, he resolved to
wait full two hours, on this third and last night.
There was the lady who had once kept Mr. Boun-
derby's house, sitting at the first floor window as he had
seen her before; and there was the light porter, some-
times talking with her there, and sometimes looking
over the blind below which had Bank upon it, and some-
times coming to the door and standing on the steps for
a breath of air. When he first came out, Stephen
thought he might be looking for him, and passed near;
but the light porter only cast his winking eyes upon him
slightly, and said nothing.
Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after
a hard day's labour. Stephen sat upon the step of a
door, leaned against a wall under an archway, strolled
up and down, listened for the church clock, stopped and
watched children playing in the street. Some purpose
or other is so natural to every one, that a mere loiterer
always looks and feels remarkable. When the first
hour was out, Stephen even began to have an uncom-
fortable sensation upon him of being for the time a dis-
reputable character.
Then came the lamplighter, and two lengthening
lines of light all down the long perspective of the street,
until they were blended and lost in the distance. Mrs.
Sparsit closed the first floor window, drew down the
blind, and went up-stairs. Presently, a light went up-
stairs after her, passing first the fanlight of the door,
and afterwards the two staircase windows, on its way
up. By-and-by, one corner of the second floor blind was
disturbed, as if Mrs. Sparsit's eye were there; also the
other corner, as if the light porter's eye were on that
side. Still, no communication was made to Stephen.
Much relieved when the two hours were at last accom-
plished, he went away at a quick pace, as a recompense
for so much loitering.
He had only to take leave of his landlady, and lie
down on his temporary bed upon the floor; for his
bundle was made up for to-morrow, and all was ar-
ranged for his departure. He meant to be clear of the
town very early: before the Hands were in the streets.
It was barely daybreak, when, with a parting look
round his room, mournfully wondering whether he should

ever see it again, he went out. The town was entirely
deserted, as if the inhabitants had abandoned it rather
than hold communication with him. Everything looked
wan at that hour. Even the coming sun made it a pale
waste in the sky, like a sad sea.
By the place where Rachael lived, though it was not
in his way; by the red brick streets; by the great silent
factories, not trembling yet; by the railway, where the
danger-lights were waning before the strengthening
day; by the railway's crazy neighbourhood, half pulled
down, and half built up; by scattered red brick villas,
where the besmoked evergreens were sprinkled with a
dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by coal-dust
paths and many varieties of ugliness; Stephen got to the
top of the hill, and looked back.
Day was shining radiantly upon the town then, and
the bells were going for the morning work. Domestic
fires were not yet lighted, and the high chimneys had
the sky to themselves. Puffing out their poisonous vol-
umes, they would not be long in hiding it; but, for half
an hour, some of the many windows were golden, which
showed the Coketown people a sun eternally in eclipse,
through a medium of smoked glass.
So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds.
So strange to have the road-dust on his feet instead of
the coal-grit. So strange to have lived to his time of
life, and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer
morning. With these musings in his mind, and his
bundle under his arm, Stephen took his attentive face
along the high road. And the trees arched over him,
whispering that he left a true and loving heart behind.

CHAPTER VII.
GUNPOWDER.
MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE, “ going in” for his adopted
party, soon began to score. With the aid of a little
more coaching for the political sages, a little more
genteel listlessness for the general society, and a toler-
able management of the assumed honesty in dishonesty,
most effective and most patronised of the polite deadly
sins, he speedily came to be considered of much promise.
The not being troubled with earnestness was a grand
point in his favour, enabling him to take to the hard
Fact fellows with as good a grace as if he had been born
one of the tribe, and to throw all other tribes overboard
as conscious hypocrites.
“ Whom none of us believe, my dear Mrs. Bounderby,
and who do not believe themselves. The only differ-
ence between us and the professors of virtue or
benevolence, or philanthropy-never mind the name-
is, that we know it is all meaningless, and say so; while
they know it equally and will never say so."
Why should she be shocked or warned by this reitera-
tion? It was not so unlike her father's principles, and
her early training, that it need startle her. Where was
the great difference between the two schools, when each
chained her down to material realities, and inspired her
with no faith in anything else? What was there in her
soul for James Harthouse to destroy, which Thomas
Gradgrind had nurtured there in its state of innocence!
It was even the worse for her at this pass, that in her
mind-implanted there before her eminently practical
father began to form it—a struggling disposition to be-
lieve in a wider and nobler humanity than she had ever
heard of, constantly strove with doubts and resentments.
With doubts, because the aspiration had been so laid
waste in her youth. With resentments, because of the
wrong that had been done her, if it were indeed a
whisper of the truth. Upon a nature long accustomed
to self-suppression, thus torn and divided, the Harthouse
philosophy came as a relief and justification. Every-

thing being hollow and worthless, she had missed nothing
and sacrificed nothing. What did it matter, she had
said to her father, when he proposed her husband.
· What did it matter, she said still. With a scornful self-
reliance, she asked herself, What did anything matter
--and went on.
Towards what? Step by step, onward and downward,
towards some end, yet so gradually that she believed
herself to remain motionless. As to Mr. Harthouse,
whither he tended, he neither considered nor cared. He
had no particular design or plan before him: no ener-
getic wickedness ruffled his lassitude. He was as much
amused and interested, at present, as it became so fine a
gentleman to be; perhaps even more than it would have
been consistent with his reputation to confess. Soon
after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother, the
honourable and jocular member, that the Bounderbys
were “great fun;" and further, that the female Boun-
derby, instead of being the Gorgon he had expected, was
young, and remarkably pretty. After that he wrote no
more about them, and devoted his leisure chiefly to their
house. He was very often in their house, in his flittings
and visitings about the Coketown district; and was
much encouraged by Mr. Bounderby. It was quite in
Mr. Bounderby's gusty way to boast to all his world
that he didn't care about your highly connected people,
but that if his wife, Tom Gradgrind's daughter, did, she
was welcome to their company.
Mr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new
sensation if the face which changed so beautifully for
the whelp would change for him.
He was quick enough to observe; he had a good mem-
ory, and did not forget a word of the brother's revela-
tions. He interwove them with everything he saw of
the sister, and he began to understand her. To be sure,
the better and profounder part of her character was not
within his scope of perception; for in natures, as in
seas, depth answers unto depth; but he soon began to
read the rest with a student's eye.
Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and
grounds, about fifteen miles from the town, and accessi-
ble within a mile or two, by a railway striding on many
arches over a wild country, undermined by deserted
coal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires and black

shapes of stationary engines at pits' mouths. This
country, gradually softening towards the neighbourhood
of Mr. Bounderby's retreat, there mellowed into a rustic
landscape, golden with heath, and snowy with hawthorn
in the spring of the year, and tremulous with leaves and
their shadows all the summer time. The bank had fore-
closed a mortgage effected on the property thus pleas-
antly situated, by one of the Coketown magnates, who,
in his determination to make a shorter cut than usual to
an enormous fortune, over-speculated himself by about
two hundred thousand pounds. These accidents did
sometimes happen in the best-regulated families of Coke-
town, but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever
with the improvident classes.
It afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to
instal himself in this snug little estate, and with demon-
strative humility to grow cabbages in the flower-garden.
He delighted to live, barrack-fashion, among the elegant
furniture, and he bullied the very pictures with his
origin. “Why, sir,” he would say to a visitor, “I am
told that Nickits” (the late owner)“ gave seven hundred
pound for that Sea-beach. Now, to be plain with you, if
I ever, in the whole course of my life, take seven looks
at it, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much as I
shall do. No, by George! I don't forget that I am
Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. For years upon years,
the only pictures in my possession, or that I could have
got into my possession by any means, unless I stole 'em,
were the engravings of a man shaving himself in a
boot, on the blacking bottles that I was overjoyed to use
in cleaning boots with, and that I sold when they were
empty for a farthing apiece, and glad to get it!”
Then he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same
style.
“Harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here.
Bring half a dozen more if you like, and we'll find
room for 'em. There's stabling in this place for a dozen
horses; and unless Nickits is belied, he kept the full
number. A round dozen of 'em, sir. When that man
was a boy, he went to Westminster School. Went to
Westminster School as a King's Scholar, when I was
principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market
baskets. Why, if I wanted to keep a dozen horses

own lodging used to be. I couldn't look at 'em, sir, and
not order 'em out. Yet so things come round. You
see this place; you know what sort of a place it is; you
are aware that there is not a completer place of its size
in this kingdom or elsewhere—I don't care where--and
here, got into the middle of it, like a maggot into a nut,
is Josiah Bounderby. While Nickits (as a man came
into my office, and told me yesterday), Nickits, who
used to act in Latin, in the Westminster School plays,
with the chief-justices and nobility of this country
applauding him till they were black in the face, is
drivelling at this minute-drivelling, sir-in a fifth
floor, up a narrow, dark, back street in Antwerp.”
It was among the leafy shadows of this retirement,
in the long sultry summer days, that Mr. Harthouse
began to prove the face which had set him wondering
when he first saw it, and to try if it would change for
him.
“Mrs. Bounderby, I esteem it a most fortunate acci-
dent that I find you alone here. I have for some time
had a particular wish to speak to you.”
It was not by any wonderful accident that he found
her, the time of day being that at which she was always
alone, and the place being her favourite resort. It was
an opening in a dark wood, where some felled trees
lay, and where she would sit watching the fallen leaves
of last year, as she had watched the fallen ashes at
home.
He sat down beside her, with a glance at her face.
“ Your brother. My young friend Tom”
Her colour brightened, and she turned to him with a
look of interest. “I never in my life,” he thought, “ saw
anything so remarkable and so captivating as the light-
ing of those features!" His face betrayed his thoughts
- perhaps without betraying him, for it might have been
according to its instructions so to do.
“Pardon me. The expression of your sisterly interest
is so beautiful-Tom should be so proud of it-I know
this is inexcusable, but I am so compelled to admire.”
“Being so impulsive,” she said composedly.

in him.”
“Have you an interest in anything, Mr. Harthouse?”
she asked, half incredulous and half gratefully.
“If you had asked me when I first came here, I should
have said no. I must say now—even at the hazard of
appearing to make a pretence, and of justly awakening
your incredulity-yes.”.
She made a slight movement, as if she were trying to
speak, but could not find voice; at length she said, “Mr.
Harthouse, I give you credit for being interested in my
brother.”
“ Thank you. I claim to deserve it. You know how
little I do claim, but I will go that length. You have
done so much for him, you are so fond of him; your
whole life, Mrs. Bounderby, expresses such charming
self-forgetfulness on his account-pardon me again-
am running wide of the subject. I am interested in
him for his own sake.”
She had made the slightest action possible, as if she
would have risen in a hurry and gone away. He had
turned the course of what he said at that instant, and
she remained. .
“Mrs. Bounderby," he resumed, in a lighter manner,
and yet with a show of effort in assuming it, which was
even more expressive than the manner he dismissed;
“it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your
brother's years, if he is heedless, inconsiderate, and ex-
pensive-a little dissipated, in the common phrase..
Is he?"
“Yes."
“ Allow me to be frank. Do you think he games
at all?"
“I think he makes bets.” Mr. Harthouse waiting, as
if that were not her whole answer, she added, “I know
he does.”
6. Of course he loses?”

“Yes.”
“Everybody does lose who bets. May I hint at the
probability of your sometimes supplying him with
money for these purposes?”.
She sat looking down; but, at this question, raised her
eyes searchingly and a little resentfully.
“Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs.
Bounderby. I think Tom may be gradually falling into
trouble, and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him
from the depths of my wicked experience.—Shall I say
again, for his sake? Is that necessary?”
She seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it.
“Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to
me,” said James Harthouse, again gilding with the
same appearance of effort into his more airy manner;
“I will confide to you my doubt whether he has had
many advantages. Whether-forgive my plainness-
whether any great amount of confidence is likely to
have been established between himself and his most
worthy father.”
“I do not,” said Louisa, flushing with her own great
remembrance in that wise, “think it likely.”
“Or, between himself, and-I may trust to your per-
fect understanding of my meaning, I am sure—and his
highly esteemed brother-in-law."
She flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red
when she replied in a fainter voice, “I do not think
that likely either.”
“Mrs. Bounderby,” said Harthouse, after a short
silence, “may there be a better confidence between
yourself and me? Tom has borrowed a considerable
sum of you?”
“You will understand, Mr. Harthouse,” she returned,
after some indecision: she had been more or less uncer-
tain, and troubled throughout the conversation, and yet
had in the main preserved her self-contained manner;
“you will understand that if I tell you what you press
to know, it is not by way of complaint or regret. I
would never complain of anything, and what I have
done I do not in the least regret.”
“So spirited, too!” thought James Harthouse.
“When I married, I found that my brother was even
at that time heavily in debt. Heavily for him, I mean.
Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets.

They were no sacrifice. I sold them very willingly. I
attached no value to them. They were quite worthless
to me.”
Either she saw in his face that he knew, or she only
feared in her heart that he knew, that she spoke of some
of her husband's gifts. She stopped, and reddened again.
If he had not known it before, he would have known it
then, though he had been a much duller man than he
was.
“Since then, I have given my brother, at various
times, what money I could spare: in short, what money
I have had. Confiding in you at all, on the faith of the
interest you profess for him, I will not do so by halves.
Since you have been in the habit of visiting here, he has
wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds. I
have not been able to give it to him. I have felt uneasy
for the consequences of his being so involved, but I have
kept these secrets until now, when I trust them to your
honour. I have held no confidence with any one, because
-you anticipated my reason, just now.” She abruptly
broke off.
He was a ready man, and he saw, and seized, an op-
portunity here of presenting her own image to her,
slightly disguised as her brother.
* Mrs. Bounderby, though a graceless person, of the
world worldly, I feel the utmost interest, I assure you, in
what you tell me. I cannot possibly be hard upon your
brother. I understand and share the wise consideration
with which you regard his errors. With all possible
respect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby,
I think I perceive that he has not been fortunate in his
training. Bred at a disadvantage towards the society
in which he has his part to play, he rushes into these
extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that have
long been forced-with the very best intentions, we have
no doubt-upon him. Mr. Bounderby's fine bluff English
independence, though a most charming characteristic,
does not—as we have agreed-invite confidence. If Í
might venture to remark that it is the least in the world
deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken, a
character misconceived, and abilities misdirected, would
turn for relief and guidance, I should express what it
presents to my own view."
As she sat looking straight before her, across the

changing lights upon the grass into the darkness of the
wood beyond, he saw in her face her application of his
very distinctly uttered words.
"All allowance,” he continued, “must be made. I
have one great fault to find with Tom, however, which
I cannot forgive, and for which I take him heavily to
account.”
Louisa turned her eyes to his face and asked him what
fault was that?
“Perhaps,” he returned, “I have said enough. Per-
haps it would have been better, on the whole, if no allu-
sion to it had escaped me.”
“You alarm mē, Mr. Harthouse. Pray let me know
it.”
“To relieve you from needless apprehension-and as
this confidence regarding your brother, which I prize, I
am sure, above all possible things, has been established
between us-I obey. I cannot forgive him for not being
more sensible in every word, look, and act of his life, of
the affection of his best friend; of the devotion of his
best friend; of her unselfishness; of her sacrifice. The
return he makes her, within my observation, is a very
poor one. What she has done for him demands his
constant love and gratitude, not his ill-humour and
caprice. Careless fellow as I am, I am not so indiffer-
ent, Mrs. Bounderby, as to be regardless of this vice
in your brother, or inclined to consider it a venial
offence.”
The wood floated before her, for her eyes were suffused
with tears. They rose from a deep well, long concealed,
and her heart was filled with acute pain that found no
relief in them.
“In a word, it is to correct your brother in this, Mrs.
Bounderby, that I must aspire. My better knowledge
of his circumstances, and my direction and advice in
extricating him-rather valuable, I hope, as coming
from a scapegrace on a much larger scale-will give me
some influence over him, and all I gain I shall certainly
use towards this end. I have said enough, and more
than enough. I seem to be protesting that I am a sort of
good fellow, when, upon my honour, I have not the least
intention to make any protestation to that effect, and
openly announce that I am nothing of the sort. Yonder,
among the trees,” he added, having lifted up his eyes and

looked about; for he had watched her closely until now;
“is your brother himself; no doubt, just come down. As
he seems to be loitering in this direction, it may be as
well, perhaps, to walk towards him, and throw ourselves
in his way. He has been very silent and doleful of late.
Perhaps his brotherly conscience is touched—if there
are such things as consciences. Though, upon my
honour, I hear of them much too often to believe in
them.”
He assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they
advanced to meet the whelp. He was idly beating the
branches as he lounged along: or he stooped viciously to
rip the moss from the trees with his stick. He was
startled when they came upon him while he was en-
gaged in this latter pastime, and his colour changed.
“Halloa!” he stammered; “I didn't know you were
here."
“Whose name, Tom,” said Mr. Harthouse, putting his
hand upon his shoulder and turning him, so that they
all three walked towards the house together, “have you
been carving on the trees?”
“Whose name?" returned Tom. “Oh! You mean -
what girl's name?”
“You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing
some fair creature's on the bark, Tom.”
“Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair
creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal
would take a fancy to me. Or she might be as ugly as
she was rich, without any fear of losing me. I'd carve
her name as often as she liked.”
“I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.”
“Mercenary,” repeated Tom. “Who is not mercenary?
Ask my sister.”
“Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?"
said Louisa, showing no other sense of his discontent
and ill-nature.
“You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,” returned
her brother sulkily. “If it does, you can wear it.”
“ Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people
are now and then,” said Mr. Harthouse. “Don't believe
him, Mrs. Bounderby. He knows much better. I shall
disclose some of his opinions of you, privately expressed
to me, unless he relents a little."
“At all events, Mr. Harthouse," said Tom, softening

163
in his admiration of his patron, but shaking his head
sullenly too, “you can't tell her that I ever praised her
for being mercenary. I may have praised her for
being the contrary, and I should do it again if I had
as good reason. However, never mind this now; it's
not very interesting to you, and I am sick of the
subject.”
They walked on to the house, where Louisa quitted
her visitor's arm and went in. He stood looking after
her, as she ascended the steps, and passed into the
shadow of the door; then put his hand upon her brother's
shoulder again, and invited him with a confidential nod
to walk in the garden.
“ Tom, my fine fellow, I want to have a word with
you.”
They stopped among a disorder of roses--it was part
of Mr. Bounderby's humility to keep Nickits's roses on
a reduced scale-and Tom sat down on a terrace-parapet,
plucking buds and picking them to pieces; while his
powerful Familiar stood over him, with a foot upon the
parapet, and his figure easily resting on the arm sup-
ported by that knee. They were just visible from her
window. Perhaps she saw them.
“ Tom, what's the matter?”
“Oh! Mr. Harthouse,” said Tom, with a groan, “I am
hard up, and bothered out of my life.”
“ My good fellow, so am I.”
“ You!" returned Tom. “You are the picture of in-
dependence. Mr. Harthouse, I am in a horrible mess.
You have no idea what a state I have got myself into-
what a state my sister might have got me out of, if she
would only have done it.”
He took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them
away from his teeth with a hand that trembled like an
infirm old man's. After one exceedingly observant look
at him, his companion relapsed into his lightest air.
“ Tom, you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of
your sister. You have had money of her, you dog, you
know you have.”
“Well, Mr. Harthouse, I know I have. How else was
I to get it? Here's old Bounderby always boasting that
at my age he lived upon two-pence a month, or some-
thing of that sort. Here's my father drawing what he
calls a line, and tying me down to it from a baby, neck

and heels. Here's my mother who never has anything
of her own, except her complaints. What is a fellow to
do for money, and where am I to look for it if not to my
sister?"
He was almost crying, and scattered the buds about
by dozens. Mr. Harthouse took him persuasively by the
coat.
“But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got it--"
“Not got it, Mr. Harthouse? I don't say she has got
it. I may have wanted more than she was likely to have
got. But then she ought to get it. She could get it.
It's of no use pretending to make a secret of matters
now, after what I have told you already; you know she
didn't marry old Bounderby for her own sake, or for his
sake, but for my sake. Then why doesn't she get what
I want, out of him, for my sake? She is not obliged to
say what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough;
she could manage to coax it out of him, if she chose.
Then why doesn't she choose, when I tell her of what
consequence it is? But no. There she sits in his com-
pany like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable
and getting it easily. I don't know what you may call
this, but I call it unnatural conduct.”
There was a piece of ornamental water immediately
below the parapet, on the other side, into which Mr.
James Harthouse had a very strong inclination to pitch
Mr. Thomas Gradgrind, Junior, as the injured men of
Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the
Atlantic. But he preserved his easy attitude; and noth-
ing more solid went over the stone balustrades than the
accumulated rosebuds, now floating about, a little sur-
face-island.
“My dear Tom,” said Harthouse, “ let me try to be
your banker.”
“For God's sake,” replied Tom, suddenly, “ don't talk
about bankers!” And very white he looked, in contrast
with the roses. Very white.
Mr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accus-
tomed to the best society, was not to be surprised-he
could as soon have been affected—but he raised his eye-
lids a little more, as if they were lifted by a feeble touch
of wonder. Albeit it was as much against the precepts
of his school to wonder, as it was against the doctrines
of the Gradgrind College,

“What is the present need, Tom? Three figures? Out
with them. Say what they are.”
“Mr. Harthouse," returned Tom, now actually crying;
and his tears were better than his injuries, however
pitiful a figure he made; "it's too late; the money is of
no use to me at present. I should have had it before to
be of use to me. But I am very much obliged to you;
you're a true friend.”
A true friend!" Whelp, whelp!” thought Mr. Hart-
house, lazily; “what an Ass you are!"
“And I take your offer as a great kindness,” said
Tom, grasping his hand. “ As a great kindness, Mr.
Harthouse.”
“Well,” returned the other, “it may be of more use
by-and-by. And, my good fellow, if you will open your
bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I
may show you better ways out of them than you can
find for yourself.”
“Thank you,” said Tom, shaking his head dismally,
and chewing rosebuds. “I wish I had known you
sooner, Mr. Harthouse.”
“Now, you see, Tom,” said Mr. Harthouse in conclu-
sion, himself tossing over a rose or two, as a contribu-
tion to the island, which was always drifting to the
wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland:
“every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am
exactly like the rest of my fellow-creatures. I am des-
perately intent;" the languor of his desperation being
quite tropical; “ on your softening towards your sister
—which you ought to do; and on your being a more lov-
ing and agreeable sort of brother—which you ought to
be.”
“ I will be, Mr. Harthouse."
“No time like the present, Tom. Begin at once.”
“Certainly I will." And my sister Loo shall say so.”
“Having made which bargain, Tom,” said Hart-
house, clapping him on the shoulder again, with an air
which left him at liberty to infer-as he did, poor fool-
that this condition was imposed upon him in mere care-
less good nature to lessen his sense of obligation, “we
will tear ourselves asunder until dinner-time.”
When Tom appeared before dinner, though his mind
seemed heavy enough, his body was on the alert; and
he appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in, “I didn't

mean to be cross, Loo,” he said, giving her his hand, and
kissing her. “I know you are fond of me, and you know
I am fond of you.”.
After this, there was a smile upon Louisa's face that
day, for some one else. Alas, for some one else!
“So much the less is the whelp the only creature that
she cares for,” thought James Harthouse, reversing the
reflection of his first day's knowledge of her pretty face.
“ So much the less, so much the less.”.
CHAPTER VIII.
EXPLOSION.
THE next morning was too bright a morning for sleep,
and James Harthouse rose early, and sat in the pleasant
bay window of his dressing-room, smoking the rare to-
bacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his
young friend. Reposing in the sunlight, with the fra-
grance of his eastern pipe about him, and the dreamy
smoke vanishing into the air, so rich and soft with sum-
mer odours, he reckoned up his advantages as an idle
winner might count his gains. He was not at all bored
for the time, and could give his mind to it.
He had established a confidence with her, from which
her husband was excluded. He had established a confi-
dence with her, that absolutely turned upon her indif-
ference towards her husband, and the absence, now, and
at all times, of any congeniality between them. He
had artfully, but plainly assured her, that he knew her
heart in its last most delicate recesses; he had come so
near to her through its tenderest sentiment; he had asso-
ciated himself with that feeling; and the barrier behind
which she lived had melted away. All very odd, and
very satisfactory!
And yet he had not, even now, any earnest wicked-
ness of purpose in him. Publicly and privately, it were
much better for the age in which he lived, that he and
the legion of whom he was one were designedly bad,
than indifferent and purposeless. It is the drifting ice-
bergs, setting with any current anywhere, that wreck
the ships.

When the devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he
goeth about in a shape by which few but savages and
hunters are attracted. But, when he is trimmed,
smoothed, and varnished, according to the mode; when
he is aweary of vice, and aweary of virtue, used up as to
brimstone, and used up as to bliss; then, whether he
take to the serving out of red tape, or to the kindling of
red fire, he is the very devil.
So, James Harthouse reclined in the window, indo-
lently smoking, and reckoning up the steps he had
taken on the road by which he happened to be travel-
ling. The end to which it led was before him, pretty
plainly; but he troubled himself with no calculations
about it. What will be, will be.
As he had rather a long ride to take that day-for
there was a public occasion “to do” at some distance,
which afforded a tolerable opportunity of going in for
the Gradgrind men-he dressed early and went down
to breakfast. He was anxious to see if she had re-
lapsed since the previous evening. No. He resumed
where he had left off. There was a look of interest for
him again.
He got through the day as much (or as little) to his
own satisfaction as was to be expected under the fa-
tiguing circumstances, and came riding back at six
o'clock. There was a sweep of some half mile be-
tween the lodge and the house, and he was riding along
at a foot pace over the smooth gravel, once Nickits's,
when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the shubbery with
such violence as to make his horse shy across the
road.
“Harthouse!” cried Mr. Bounderby. “Have you
heard?”
“Heard what?” said Harthouse, soothing his horse,
and inwardly favouring Mr. Bounderby with no good
wishes.
“ Then you haven't heard!”
“I have heard you, and so has this brute. I have
heard nothing else.”
Mr. Bounderby, red and hot, planted himself in the
centre of the path before the horse's head, to explode
his bombshell with more effect.
“ The Bank's robbed!”
“You don't mean it!"

HARD TIMES.
“Robbed last night, sir. Robbed in an extraordinary
manner. Robbed with a false key.”.
“Of much?”
Mr. Bounderby, in his desire to make the most of it,
really seemed mortified by being obliged to reply,
“ Why, no; not of very much. But it might have been."
“Of how much?”
“Oh! as a sum-if you stick to a sum--of not more
than a hundred and fifty pound,” said Bounderby, with
impatience. “But it's not the sum; it's the fact. It's
the fact of the Bank being robbed, that's the important
circumstance. I am surprised you don't see it.”
“My dear Bounderby,” said James, dismounting, and
giving his bridle to his servant, “I do see it; and am as
overcome as you can possibly desire me to be, by the
spectacle afforded to my mental view. Nevertheless, I
may be allowed, I hope, to congratulate you—which I
do with all my soul, I assure you-on your not having
sustained a greater loss.”
“Thank’ee,” replied Bounderby, in a short, ungracious
manner. “But I tell you what. It might have been
twenty thousand pound.”
“I suppose it might.”
“Suppose it might! By the Lord, you may suppose
so. By George!” said Mr. Bounderby, with sundry
menacing nods and shakes of his head, “it might have
been twice twenty. There's no knowing what it would
have been, or wouldn't have been, as it was, but for the
fellows' being disturbed.”
Louisa had come up now, and Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer.
“Here's Tom Gradgrind's daughter knows pretty well
what it might have been, if you don't,” blustered Boun-
derby. “Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told
her! Never knew her to do such a thing before. Does
her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!"
She still looked faint and pale. James Harthouse
begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on
very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been com-
mitted.
“Why, I am going to tell you,” said Bounderby,
irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. “If you
hadn't been so mighty particular about the sum, I
should have begun to tell you before. You know this
lady (for she is a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?"

“I have already had the honour”-
“ Very well. And this young man, Bitzer, you saw
him too on the same occasion?” Mr. Harthouse inclined
his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead.
“ Very well. They live at the Bank. You know they
live at the Bank, perhaps? Very well. Yesterday
afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything
was put away as usual. In the iron room that this
young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind
how much. In the little safe in young Tom's closet,
the safe used for petty purposes, there was a hundred
and fifty odd pound.”
“A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,” said Bitzer. :
“Come!” retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel
round upon him, “let's have none of your interruptions.
It's enough to be robbed while you're snoring because
you're too comfortable, without being put right with
your four seven ones. I didn't snore, myself, when I
was your age, let me tell you. I hadn't victuals enough
to snore. And I didn't four seven one. Not if I knew
it.”
Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking
manner, and seemed at once particularly impressed
and depressed by the instance last given of Mr. Boun-
derby's moral abstinence.
“A hundred and fifty odd pound,” resumed Mr. Boun-
derby. “That sum of money young Tom locked in his
safe; not a very strong safe, but that's no matter, now.
Everything was left, all right. Some time in the night,
while this young fellow snored-Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am,
you say you have heard him snore?”
“Sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, “I cannot say that I
have heard him precisely snore, and therefore must not
make that statement. But on winter evenings, when he
has fallen asleep at his table, I have heard him, what I
should prefer to describe as partially choke. I have
heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature
similar to what may be sometimes heard in Dutch
clocks. Not,” said Mrs. Sparsit, with a lofty sense of
giving strict evidence, “ that I would convey any im-
putation on his moral character. Far from it. I have
always considered Bitzer a young man of the most
upright principle; and to that I beg to bear my testi-
mony.”

“ Well!” said the exasperated Bounderby, “while he
was snoring, or choking, or Dutch-clocking, or something
or other-being asleep-some fellows, somehow, whether
previously concealed in the house or not remains to be
seen, got to young Tom's safe, forced it, and abstracted
the contents. Being then disturbed, they made off; let-
ting themselves out at the main door, and double-locking
it again it was double-locked, and the key under Mrs.
Sparsit’s pillow) with a false key, which was picked up
in the street near the Bank, about twelve o'clock to-day.
No alarm takes place, till this chap, Bitzer, turns out
this morning, and begins to open and prepare the offices
for business. Then, looking at Tom's safe, he sees the
door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the money
gone.”
“Where is Tom, by-the-bye?” asked Harthouse,
glancing round.
“He has been helping the police,” said Bounderby,
“and stays behind at the Bank. I wish these fellows
had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life. They
would have been out of pocket if they had invested
eighteenpence in the job: I can tell 'em that."
“ Is anybody suspected?”
“Suspected? I should think there was somebody sus-
pected. Egod!” said Bounderby, relinquishing Mrs.
Sparsit's arm to wipe his heated head. "Josiah Boun-
derby of Coketown is not to be plundered and nobody
suspected. No, thank you!"
Might Mr. Harthouse inquire who was suspected?
66 Well,” said Bounderby, stopping and facing about
to confront them all, “ I'll tell you. It's not to be men-
tioned everywhere; it's not to be mentioned anywhere:
in order that the scoundrels concerned (there's a gang of
'em) may be thrown off their guard. So take this in
confidence. Now, wait a bit.” Mr. Bounderby wiped
his head again. “What should you say to;" here he
violently exploded; “to a Hand being in it?"
“I hope,” said Harthouse, lazily, “not our friend
Blackpot?"
“Say Pool instead of Pot, sir,” returned Bounderby,
" and that's the man.”
Louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and
surprise.
"Oh, yes! I know!" said Bounderby , immediately

catching at the sound. “I know! I am used to that. I
know all about it. They are the finest people in the
world, these fellows are. They have got the gift of the
gab, they have. They only want to have their rights
explained to them, they do. But I tell you what. Show
me a dissatisfied Hand, and I'll show you a man that's
fit for anything bad, I don't care what it is.”
Another of the popular fictions of Coketown, which
some pains had been taken to disseminate--and which
some people really believed.
“But I am acquainted with these chaps,” said Boun-
derby. “I can read 'em off, like books. Mrs. Sparsit,
ma'am, I appeal to you. What warning did I give that
fellow, the first time he set foot in the house, when the
express object of his visit was to know how he could
knock Religion over, and floor the Established Church?
Mrs. Sparsit, in point of high connexions, you are on a
level with the aristocracy-did I say, or did I not say,to
that fellow, you can't hide the truth from me: you are
not the kind of fellow I like; you'll come to no good?'”
“ Assuredly, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, “you did, in
a highly impressive manner, give him such an admoni-
tion."
“ When he shocked you, ma’am,” said Bounderby;
- when he shocked your feelings?”
“Yes, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a meek shake
of her head, “he certainly did so. Though I do not
mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on
such points—more foolish, if the term is preferred—than
they might have been, if I had always occupied my
present position.”
Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr.
Harthouse, as much as to say, “I am the proprietor of
this female, and she's worth your attention, I think.”
Then resumed his discourse.
“You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to
him when you saw him. I didn't mince the matter with
him. I am never mealy with 'em. I know 'em. Very
well, sir. Three days after that, he bolted. Went off,
nobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancy
-only with this difference, that he is a worse subject
than my mother, if possible. What did he do before he
went? What do you say;" Mr. Bounderby, with his hat
in his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little

“Robbed last night, sir. Robbed in an extraordinary
manner. Robbed with a false key.”
“Of much?”
Mr. Bounderby, in his desire to make the most of it,
really seemed mortified by being obliged to reply,
“Why, no; not of very much. But it might have been.”
“ Of how much?”
“Oh! as a sum-if you stick to a sum--of not more
than a hundred and fifty pound,” said Bounderby, with
impatience. “But it's not the sum; it's the fact. It's
the fact of the Bank being robbed, that's the important
circumstance. I am surprised you don't see it.”
“My dear Bounderby," said James, dismounting, and
giving his bridle to his servant, “I do see it; and am as
overcome as you can possibly desire me to be, by the
spectacle afforded to my mental view. Nevertheless, I
may be allowed, I hope, to congratulate you—which I
do with all my soul, I assure you-on your not having
sustained a greater loss.”
“Thank’ee,” replied Bounderby, in a short, ungracious
manner. “But I tell you what. It might have been
twenty thousand pound.”
“I suppose it might.”
“Suppose it might! By the Lord, you may suppose
so. By George!” said Mr. Bounderby, with sundry
menacing nods and shakes of his head, “it might have
been twice twenty. There's no knowing what it would
have been, or wouldn't have been, as it was, but for the
fellows' being disturbed.”
Louisa had come up now, and Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer.
“Here's Tom Gradgrind's daughter knows pretty well
what it might have been, if you don't,” blustered Boun-
derby. “Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told
her! Never knew her to do such a thing before. Does
her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!"
She still looked faint and pale. James Harthouse
begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on
very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been com-
mitted.
“Why, I am going to tell you,” said Bounderby,
irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. “If you
hadn't been so mighty particular about the sum, I
should have begun to tell you before. You know this
lady (for she is a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?”

“I have already had the honour "-
“ Very well. And this young man, Bitzer, you saw
him too on the same occasion?” Mr. Harthouse inclined
his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead.
“ Very well. They live at the Bank. You know they
live at the Bank, perhaps? Very well. Yesterday
afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything
was put away as usual. In the iron room that this
young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind
how much. In the little safe in young Tom's closet,
the safe used for petty purposes, there was a hundred
and fifty odd pound.”
“A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one," said Bitzer. .
“Come!” retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel
round upon him, “let's have none of your interruptions.
It's enough to be robbed while you're snoring because
you're too comfortable, without being put right with
your four seven ones. I didn't snore, myself, when I
was your age, let me tell you. I hadn't victuals enough
to snore. And I didn't four seven one. Not if I knew
it.”
Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking
manner, and seemed at once particularly impressed
and depressed by the instance last given of Mr. Boun-
derby's moral abstinence.
“A hundred and fifty odd pound,” resumed Mr. Boun-
derby. “That sum of money young Tom locked in his
safe; not a very strong safe, but that's no matter, now.
Everything was left, all right. Some time in the night,
while this young fellow snored-Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am,
you say you have heard him snore?”
“Sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, “I cannot say that I
have heard him precisely snore, and therefore must not
make that statement. But on winter evenings, when he
has fallen asleep at his table, I have heard him, what I
should prefer to describe as partially choke. I have
heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature
similar to what may be sometimes heard in Dutch
clocks. Not,” said Mrs. Sparsit, with a lofty sense of
giving strict evidence, “that I would convey any im-
putation on his moral character. Far from it. I have
always considered Bitzer a young man of the most
upright principle; and to that I beg to bear my testi-
mony.

“ Well!” said the exasperated Bounderby, “while he
was snoring, or choking, or Dutch-clocking, or something
or other-being asleep-some fellows, somehow, whether
previously concealed in the house or not remains to be
seen, got to young Tom's safe, forced it, and abstracted
the contents. Being then disturbed, they made off; let-
ting themselves out at the main door, and double-locking
it again it was double-locked, and the key under Mrs.
Sparsit's pillow) with a false key, which was picked up
in the street near the Bank, about twelve o'clock to-day.
No alarm takes place, till this chap, Bitzer, turns out
this morning, and begins to open and prepare the offices
· for business. Then, looking at Tom's safe, he sees the
door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the money
gone.”
° “Where is Tom, by-the-bye?” asked Harthouse,
glancing round.
“He has been helping the police," said Bounderby,
“and stays behind at the Bank. I wish these fellows
had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life. They
would have been out of pocket if they had invested
eighteenpence in the job: I can tell 'em that.”
“ Is anybody suspected?”
6. Suspected? I should think there was somebody sus-
pected. Egod!” said Bounderby, relinquishing Mrs.
Sparsit's arm to wipe his heated head. "Josiah Boun-
derby of Coketown is not to be plundered and nobody
suspected. No, thank you!"
Might Mr. Harthouse inquire who was suspected?
“Well,” said Bounderby, stopping and facing about
to confront them all, “ I'll tell you. It's not to be men-
tioned everywhere; it's not to be mentioned anywhere:
in order that the scoundrels concerned (there's a gang of
’em) may be thrown off their guard. So take this in
confidence. Now, wait a bit.” Mr. Bounderby wiped
his head again. “What should you say to;" here he
violently exploded; “to a Hand being in it?
“I hope,” said Harthouse, lazily, * not our friend
Blackpot?”
"Say Pool instead of Pot, sir,” returned Bounderby,
" and that's the man.”
Louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and
surprise.
“Oh, yes! I know!” said Bounderby , immediately

catching at the sound. “I know! I am used to that. I
know all about it. They are the finest people in the
world, these fellows are. They have got the gift of the
gab, they have. They only want to have their rights
explained to them, they do. But I tell you what. Show
me a dissatisfied Hand, and I'll show you a man that's
fit for anything bad, I don't care what it is.”
Another of the popular fictions of Coketown, which
some pains had been taken to disseminate-and which
some people really believed.
“But I am acquainted with these chaps,” said Boun-
derby. “I can read 'em off, like books. Mrs. Sparsit,
ma'am, I appeal to you. What warning did I give that
fellow, the first time he set foot in the house, when the
express object of his visit was to know how he could

“ when he shocked your feelings?”

of her head, “he certainly did so. Though I do not

division of his sentences, as if it were a tambourine;" to
his being seen-night after night-watching the Bank?
-to his lurking about there-after dark?To its striking
Mrs. Sparsit—that he could be lurking for no good.-TO
her calling Bitzer's attention to him, and their both
taking notice of him.-And to its appearing on inquiry
to-day-that he was also noticed by the neighbours?"
Having come to the climax, Mr. Bounderby, like an
oriental dancer, put his tambourine on his head.
“Suspicious,” said James Harthouse, “certainly."
“I think so, sir,” said Bounderby, with a defiant nod.
“I think so. But there are more of 'em in it. There's
an old woman. One never hears of these things till the
mischief 's done; all sorts of defects are found out in the
stable-door after the horse is stolen; there's an old
woman turns up now. An old woman seems to have
been flying into town on a broomstick, every now and
them. She watches the place a whole day before this
fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she
steals away with him, and holds a council with him-I
suppose, to make her report on going off duty, and be
damned to her.”
There was such a person in the room that night, and
she shrunk from observation, thought Louisa.
“This is not all of 'em, even as we already know 'em,”
said Bounderby, with many nods of hidden meaning.
“But I have said enough for the present. You'll have
the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no one.
It may take time, but we shall have 'em. It's policy to
give 'em line enough, and there's no objection to
that.”
“Of course, they will be punished with the utmost
rigour of the law, as notice-boards observe,” replied
John Harthouse, “and serve them right. Fellows who
go in for Banks must take the consequences. If there
were no consequences, we should all go in for Banks.”
He had gently taken Louisa's parasol from her hand,
and had put it up for her; and she walked under its
shade, though the sun did not shine there.
“For the present, Loo Bounderby,” said her husband,
“here's Mrs. Sparsit to look after. Mrs. Sparsit's nerves
have been acted upon by this business, and she'll stay
here a day or two. So, make her comfortable."
“Thank you very much, sir," that discreet lady ob-

served, “but pray do not let My comfort be a considera-
tion. Anything will do for Me.”
It soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in
her association with that domestic establishment, it was
that she was so excessively regardless of herself, and
regardful of others, as to be a nuisance. On being
shown her chamber, she was so dreadfully sensible of
its comforts as to suggest the inference that she would
have preferred to pass the night on the mangle in the
laundry. True, the Powlers and the Scadgerses were
accustomed to splendour, “but it is my duty to remem-
ber,” Mrs. Sparsit was fond of observing with a lofty
grace, particularly when any of the domestics were
present, “ that what I was, I am no longer. Indeed,"
said she, “if I could altogether cancel the remembrance
that Mr. Sparsit was a Powler, or that I myself am re-
lated to the Scadgers family; or if I could even revoke
the fact, and make myself a person of common descent
and ordinary connexions; I would gladly do so. I should
think it, under existing circumstances, right to do so."
The same Hermitical state of mind led to her renuncia-
tion of made dishes and wines at dinner, until fairly
commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them; when she
said, “Indeed you are very good, sir;" and departed
from a resolution of which she had made rather formal
and public announcement, to “wait for the simple
mutton.” She was likewise deeply apologetic for want-
ing the salt; and feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr.
Bounderby to the fullest extent in the testimony he had
borne to her nerves, occasionally sat back in her chair
and silently wept; at which periods a tear of large di-
mensions, like a crystal ear-ring, might be observed (or
rather, must be, for it insisted on public notice) sliding
down her Roman nose.
But Mrs. Sparsit's greatest point, first and last, was
her determination to pity Mr. Bounderby. There were
occasions when in looking at him she was involuntarily
moved to shake her head, as who would say, “ Alas poor
Yorick!" After allowing herself to be betrayed into
these evidences of emotion, she would force a lambent
brightness, and would be fitfully cheerful, and would
say, “You have still good spirits, sir, I am thankful to
find;" and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensa-
tion that Mr. Bounderby bore up as he did. One idio-

syncrasy, for which she often apologised, she found it
excessively difficult to conquer. She had a curious pro-
pensity to call Mrs. Bounderby “Miss Gradgrind," and
yielded to it some three or four score times in the course
of the evening. Her repetition of this mistake covered
Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion; but indeed, she said,
it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind: whereas, to
persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had
the happiness of knowing from a child could be really
and truly Mrs. Bounderby, she found almost impossible.
It was a further singularity of this remarkable case,
that the more she thought about it, the more impossible
it appeared; “the differences,” she observed, “being
such."
In the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Bounderby
tried the case of robbery, examined the witnesses, made
notes of the evidence, found the suspected persons guilty,
and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of the
law. That done, Bitzer was dismissed to town with in-
structions to recommend Tom to come home by the mail-
train.
When candles were brought, Mrs. Sparsit murmured,
“Don't be low, sir. Pray let me see you cheerful, sir,
as I used to do.” Mr. Bounderby, upon whom these con-
solations had begun to produce the effect of making him,
in a bull-headed, blundering way, sentimental, sighed
like some large sea-animal. “I cannot bear to see you
so, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit. “Try a hand at backgam-
mon, sir, as you used to do when I had the honour of
living under your roof.” “I haven't played backgam-
mon, ma’am,” said Mr. Bounderby, "since that time.”
“No, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit, soothingly, “I am aware
that you have not. I remember that Miss Gradgrind
takes no interest in the game. But I shall be happy,
sir, if you will condescend.”
They played near a window, opening on the garden.
It was a fine night: not moonlight, but sultry and fra-
grant. Louisa and Mr. Harthouse strolled out into the
garden, where their voices could be heard in the still-
ness, though not what they said. Mrs. Sparsit, from
her place at the backgammon board, was constantly
straining her eyes to pierce the shadows without.
“What's the matter, ma'am?” said Mr. Bounderby;
“you don't see a Fire, do you?” “Oh, dear, no, sir,

returned Mrs. Sparsit, “I was thinking of the dew."
“What have you got to do with the dew, ma’am?” said
Mr. Bounderby. “It's not myself, sir,” returned Mrs.
Sparsit, “I am fearful of Miss Gradgrind's taking cold.”
“She never takes cold,” said Mr. Bounderby. “Really,
sir?" said Mrs. Sparsit. And was affected with a cough
in her throat.
When the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby
took a glass of water. “Oh, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“Not your sherry warm, with lemon-peel and nutmeg?”
“ Why I have got out of the habit of taking it now,
ma'am,” said Mr. Bounderby. “The more's the pity,
sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit; “you are losing all your
good old habits. Cheer up, sir!" If Miss Gradgrind will
permit me, I will offer to make it for you, as I have
often done.
Miss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do
anything she pleased, that considerate lady made the
beverage, and handed it to Mr. Bounderby. “It will do
you good, sir. It will warm your heart. It is the sort
of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.” And when
Mr. Bounderby said, “Your health, ma'am!” she an-
swered with great feeling, “Thank you, sir. The same
to you, and happiness also.” Finally, she wished him
good-night, with great pathos; and Mr. Bounderby went
to bed, with a maudlin persuasion that he had been
crossed in something tender, though he could not, for
his life, have mentioned what it was.
Long after Louisa had undressed and lain down, she
watched and waited for her brother's coming home.
That could hardly be, she knew, until an hour past
midnight; but in the country silence, which did any-
thing but calm the trouble of her thoughts, time lagged
wearily. At last, when the darkness and stillness had
seemed for hours to thicken one another, she heard the
bell at the gate. She felt as though she would have been
glad that it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and
the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider
in the air, and all was dead again.
She waited yet some quarter of an hour, as she judged.
Then she arose, put on a loose robe, and went out of her
room in the dark, and up the staircase to her brother's
room. His door being shut, she softly opened it and
spoke to him, approaching his bed with a noiseless step.

She kneeled down beside it, passed her arm over
his neck, and drew his face to hers. She knew that
he only feigned to be asleep, but she said nothing to
him.
He started by-and-by as if he were just then awakened,
and asked who that was, and what was the matter?
“ Tom, have you anything to tell me? If ever you
loved me in your life, and have anything concealed
from every one besides, tell it to me.”
“I don't know what you mean, Loo. You have been
dreaming."
“My dear brother:" she laid her head down on his
pillow, and her hair flowed over him as if she would
hide him from every one but herself: “is there nothing
that you have to tell me? Is there nothing you can tell
me if you will? You can tell me nothing that will
change me. Oh, Tom, tell me the truth!”
"I don't know what you mean, Loo!"
“ As you lie here alone, my dear, in the melancholy
night, so you must lie somewhere one night, when even
I, if I am living then, shall have left you. As I am here
beside you, barefoot, unclothed, undistinguishable in
darkness, so must I lie through all the night of my de-
cay, until I am dust. In the name of that time, Tom,
tell me the truth now!"
“What is it you want to know?"
“You may be certain;" in the energy of her love she
took him to her bosom as if he were a child; "that I
will not reproach you. You may be certain that I will
be compassionate and true to you. You may be certain
that I will save you at whatever cost. Oh, Tom, have
you nothing to tell me? Whisper very softly. Say
only “yes,' and I shall understand you!"
She turned her ear to his lips, but he remained dog-
gedly silent.
“ Not a word, Tom?”
“How can I say Yes, or how can I say No, when I
don't know what you mean? Loo, you are a brave,
kind girl, worthy, I begin to think, of a better brother
than I am. But I have nothing more to say. Go to
bed, go to bed.”
“You are tired,” she whispered presently, more in
her usual way.
“Yes, I am quite tired out."

“You have been so hurried and disturbed to-day.
Have any fresh discoveries been made?”
“ Only those you have heard of, from-him.”
“Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit
to those people, and that we saw those three together?"
“No. Didn't you yourself particularly ask me to
keep it quiet, when you asked me to go there with
you?"
“Yes. But I did not know then what was going to
happen.”
"Nor I either. How could I?”
He was very quick upon her with this retort.
“Ought I to say, after what has happened,” said his
sister, standing by the bed-she had gradually with-
drawn herself and risen, “that I made that visit?
Should I say so? Must I say so?”
“ Good Heavens, Loo,” returned her brother, “ you
are not in the habit of asking my advice. Say what
you like. If you keep it to yourself, I shall keep it to
myself. If you disclose it, there's an end of it.”
It was too dark for either to see the other's face; but
each seemed very attentive, and to consider before
speaking.
“ Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to
is really implicated in this crime?"
“I don't know. I don't see why he shouldn't be.”
“He seemed to me an honest man.”
“ Another person may seem to you dishonest, and yet
not be so.”
There was a pause, for he had hesitated and stopped.
“In short,” resumed Tom, as if he had made up his
mind, “if you come to that, perhaps I was so far from
being altogether in his favour, that I took him outside
the door to tell him quietly that I thought he might con-
sider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he
had got from my sister, and that I hoped he would make
good use of it. You remember whether I took him out
or not. I say nothing against the man; he may be a
very good fellow for anything I know; I hope he is.”
“Was he offended by what you said?”
“No, he took it pretty well; he was civil enough.
Where are you, Loo?" He sat up in bed and kissed her,
“Good-night, my dear, good-night!”
“You have nothing more to tell me?''

“No. What should I have? You wouldn't have me
tell you a lie?"
“I wouldn't have you do that to-night, Tom, of all
the nights in your life; many and much happier as I
hope they will be.”
Thank you, my dear Loo. I am so tired that I am
sure I wonder I don't say anything to get to sleep. Go
to bed, go to bed.”
Kissing her again, he turned round, drew the coverlet
over his head, and lay as still as if that time had come
by which she had adjured him. She stood for some
time at the bedside before she slowly moved away.
She stopped at the door, looked back when she had
opened it, and asked him if he had called her? But he
lay still, and she softly closed the door and returned to
her room.
Then the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found
her gone, crept out of bed, fastened his door, and threw
himself upon his pillow again: tearing his hair, morosely
crying, grudgingly loving her, hatefully but impatiently
spurning himself, and no less hatefully and unprofitably
spurning all the good in the world.
CHAPTER IX.
HEARING THE LAST OF IT.
MRS. SPARSIT, lying by to recover the tone of her nerves
in Mr. Bounderby's retreat, kept such a sharp look-out,
night and day, under her Coriolanian eyebrows, that
her eyes, like a couple of lighthouses on an iron-bound
coast, might have warned all prudent mariners from that
bold rock, her Roman nose, and the dark and craggy
region in its neighbourhood, but for the placidity of her
manner. Although it was hard to believe that her
retiring for the night could be anything but a form, so
severely wide awake were those classical eyes of hers,
and so impossible did it seem that her rigid nose could
yield to any relaxing influence, yet her manner of sitting,
smoothing her uncomfortable, not to say, gritty mittens
(they were constructed of a cool fabric like a meat-safe),
or of ambling to unknown places of destination with

her foot in her cotton stirrup, was so perfectly serene,
that most observers would have been constrained to sup-
pose her a dove, embodied by some freak of nature, in
the earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook-beaked order.
She was a most wonderful woman for prowling about
the house. How she got from story to story was a mys-
tery beyond solution. A lady so decorous in herself,
and so highly connected, was not to be suspected of
dropping over the bannisters or sliding down them, yet
her extraordinary facility of locomotion suggested the
wild idea. Another noticeable circumstance in Mrs.
Sparsit was, that she was never hurried. She would
shoot with consummate velocity from the roof to the
hall, yet would be in full possession of her breath and
dignity on the moment of her arrival there. Neither
was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace.
She took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse, and had some
pleasant conversation with him soon after her arrival.
She made him her stately curtsey in the garden one
morning before breakfast.
“It appears but yesterday, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit,
“that I had the honour of receiving you at the Bank,
when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted
with Mr. Bounderby's address.
“ An occasion, I am sure, not to be forgotten by myself
in the course of Ages,” said Mr. Harthouse, inclining
his head to Mrs. Sparsit with the most indolent of all
possible airs.
“ We live in a singular world, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“I have had the honour, by a coincidence of which I
am proud, to have made a remark, similiar in effect,
though not so epigramatically expressed.”
“ A singular world, I would say, sir,” pursued Mrs.
Sparsit; after acknowledging the compliment with a
drooping of her dark eyebrows, not altogether so mild
in its expression as her voice was in its dulcet tones; "as
regards the intimacies we form at one time, with in-
dividuals we were quite ignorant of, at another. I re-
call, sir, that on that occasion you went so far as to say
you were actually apprehensive of Miss Gradgrind.”

nificance deserves. I avail myself of your obliging hints
to correct my timidity, and it is unnecessary to add that
they were perfectly accurate. Mrs. Sparsit's talent for

-in fact for anything requiring accuracy- with a coin
bination of strength of mind and Family-is too habit-
ually developed to admit of any question.” He was
almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took him
so long to get through, and his mind wandered so much
in the course of its execution.
“You found Miss Gradgrind-I really cannot call her
Mrs. Bounderby; it's very absurd of me-as youthful as
I described her?” asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly.
“You drew her portrait perfectly,” said Mr. Hart-
house. “ Presented her dead image.”
“ Very engaging, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her
mittens slowly to revolve over one another.
“Highly so.”
“It used to be considered,” said Mrs. Sparsit, “that
Miss Grandgrind was wanting in animation, but I con-
fess she appears to me considerably and strikingly im-
proved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here is Mr.
Bounderby!” cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a
great many times, as if she had been talking and think-
ing of no one else. “How do you find yourself this
morning, sir?” Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.”
Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and
lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have
the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual
towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most
other people from his wife downward. So, when Mrs.
Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, “You want
your breakfast, sir, but I daresay Miss Gradgrind will
soon be here to preside at the table,” Mr. Bounderby
replied, “If I waited to be taken care of by my wife,
ma’am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till
Doomsday, so I'll trouble you to take charge of the
teapot.” Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old
position at table.
This again made the excellent woman vastly senti-
mental. She was so humble withal, that when Louisa
appeared, she rose, protesting she never could think of
sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often
as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby's
breakfast, before Mrs. Gradgrind-she begged pardon,
she meant to say, Miss Bounderby—she hoped to be
excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though
she trusted to become familiar with it by-and-by-had

assumed her present position. It was only (she observed)
because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and
Mr. Bounderby's time was so very precious, and she
knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast
to the moment, that she had taken the liberty of com-
plying with his request; long as his will had been a law
to her.
“There! Stop where you are, ma'am," said Mr. Boun-
derby, “stop where you are! Mrs. Bounderby will be
very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I believe.”
“Don't say that, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost
with severity, “because that is very unkind to Mrs.
Bounderby. And to be unkind is not to be you, sir.”
“You may set your mind at rest, ma'am. You can
take it very quietly, can't you, Loo?" said Mr. Boun-
derby, in a blustering way to his wife.
“Of course. It is of no moment. Why should it be
of any importance to me?”
“Why should it be of any importance to any one,
Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am?” said Mr. Bounderby, swelling
with a sense of slight. “You attach too much import-
ance to these things, ma'am. By George, you'll be cor-
rupted in some of your notions here. You are old-
fashioned, ma'am. You are behind Tom Gradgrind's
children's time.”
“ What is the matter with you?” asked Louisa, coldly
surprised. “What has given you offence?”
“Offence!” repeated Bounderby. “Do you suppose
if there was any offence given me, I shouldn't name it,
and request to have it corrected? I am a straightfor-
ward man, I believe. I don't go beating about for side-
winds."
“I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too
diffident, or too delicate,” Louisa answered him com-
posedly: “I have never made that objection to you,
either as a child or as a woman. I don't understand
what you would have.”
“Have?" returned Mr. Bounderby. “Nothing. Other-
wise, don't you, Loo Bounderby, know thoroughly well
that I, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, would have it?"
She looked at him, as he struck the table and made the
teacups ring, with a proud colour in her face that was a
new change, Mr. Harthouse thought. “You are incom-
prehensible this morning,” said Louisa. “Pray take

no further trouble to explain yourself. I am not curious
to know your meaning. What does it matter!"
Nothing more was said on this theme, and Mr. Hart-
house was soon idly gay on indifferent subjects. But
from this day the Sparsit action upon Mr. Bounderby
threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together, and
strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband
and confidence against him with another, into which
she had fallen by degrees so fine that she could not re-
trace them if she tried. But, whether she ever tried or
no, lay hidden in her own closed heart.
Mrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular
occasion, that, assisting Mr. Bounderby to his hat after
breakfast, and being then alone with him in the hall,
she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand, murmured
“My benefactor!” and retired, overwhelmed with grief.
Yet it is an indubitable fact, within the cognizance of
this history, that five minutes after he had left the house
in the self-same hat, the same descendant of the Scad-
gerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers,
shook her right-hand mitten at his portrait, made a con-
temptuous grimace at that work of art, and said, “ Serve
you right, you Noodle, and I am glad of it!"
Mr. Bounderby had not been long gone when Bitzer
appeared. Bitzer had come down by train, shrieking
and rattling over the long line of arches that bestrode
the wild country of past and present coalpits, with an ex-
press from Stone Lodge. It was a hasty note to inform
Louisa that Mrs. Gradgrind lay very ill. She had
never been well within her daughter's knowledge; but
she had declined within the last few days, had continued
sinking all through the night, and was now as nearly
dead as her limited capacity of being in any state that
implied the ghost of an intention to get out of it,
allowed.
Accompanied by the lightest of porters, fit colourless
servitor at Death's door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked,
Louisa rumbled to Coketown, over the coalpits, past
and present, and was whirled into its smoky jaws. She
dismissed the messenger to his own devices, and rode
away to her old home.
She had seldom been there since her marriage. Her
father was usuallv sifting and sifting at his parliament-
ary cinder-heap in London (without being observed to

turn up many precious articles among the rubbish), and
was still hard at it in the national dust-yard. Her
mother had taken it rather as a disturbance than other-
wise to be visited as she reclined upon her sofa; young
people, Louisa felt herself all unfit for; Sissy she had
never softened to again since the night when the stroller's
child had raised her eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby's
intended wife. She had no inducements to go back and
had rarely gone.
Neither, as she approached her old home now, did
any of the best influences of old home descend upon
her. The dreams of childhood-its airy fables; its grace-
ful, beautiful, humane, impossible adornments of the
world beyond: so good to be believed in once, so good to
be remembered when outgrown, for then the least among
them rises to the stature of a great Charity in the heart,
suffering little children to come into the midst of it, and
to keep with their pure hands a garden in the stony ways
of this world, wherein it were better for all the children
of Adam that they should oftener sun themselves, simple
and trustful, and not worldly-wise--what had she to do
with these? Remembrances of how she had journeyed
to the little that she knew, by the enchanted roads of
what she and millions of innocent creatures had hoped
and imagined; of how, first coming upon Reason through
the tender light of Fancy, she had seen it a beneficent
god, deferring to gods as great as itself: not a grim Idol,
cruel and cold, with its victims bound hand to foot, and
its big dumb shape set up with a sightless stare, never
to be moved by anything but so many calculated tons of
leverage—what had she to do with these? Her remem-
brances of home and childhood were remembrances of the
drying up of every spring and fountain in her young
heart as it gushed out. The golden waters were not
there. They were flowing for the fertilisation of the
land where grapes are gathered from thorns, and figs
from thistles.
She went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow
upon her, into the house and into her mother's room.
Since the time of her leaving home, Sissy had lived
with the rest of the family on equal terms. Sissy was
at her mother's side; and Jane, her sister, now ten or
twelve years old, was in the room.
There was great trouble before it could be made known

to Mrs. Gradgrind that her eldest child was there. She
reclined, propped up, from mere habit, on a couch: as
nearly in her old usual attitude, as anything so helpless
could be kept in. She had positively refused to take to
her bed; on the ground that if she did, she would never
hear the last of it.
Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of
shawls, and the sound of another voice addressing her
seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her
ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom of a
well. The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever
had been: which had much to do with it.
On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she re-
plied, at cross-purposes, that she had never called him
by that name since he married Louisa; that pending her
choice of an objectionable name, she had called him J;
and that she could not at present depart from that
regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent
substitute. Louisa had sat by her for some minutes, and
had spoken to her often before she arrived at a clear
understanding who it was. She then seemed to come
to it all at once.
“Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Gradgrind, “and I hope
you are going on satisfactorily to yourself. It was all
your father's doing. He set his heart upon it. And he
ought to know.”
“I want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.”
“You want to hear of me, my dear? That's some-
thing new, I am sure, when anybody wants to hear of
me. Not at all well, Louisa. Very faint and giddy."
“ Are you in pain, dear mother?”
“I think there's a pain somewhere in the room,” said
Mrs. Gradgrind, “but I couldn't positively say that I
have got it.”
After this strange speech she lay silent for some
time. Louisa, holding her hand, could feel no pulse;
but kissing it, could see a slight thin thread of life in
fluttering motion.
“You very seldom see your sister,” said Mrs. Grad- •
grind. “She grows like you. I wish you would look
at her. Sissy, bring her here.”
She was brought, and stood with her hand in her
sister's. Louisa had observed her with her arm round
Sissy's neck, and she felt the difference of this approach.

“Do you see the likeness, Louisa?”
“ Yes, mother. I should think her like me. But”-
“Eh? Yes, I always say so,” Mrs. Gradgrind cried,
with unexpected quickness. “And that reminds me.
I-I want to speak to you, my dear. Sissy, my good
girl, leave us alone a minute.”
Louisa had relinquished the hand: had thought that
her sister's was a better and brighter face than hers
had ever been: had seen in it, not without a rising feel-
ing of resentment, even in that place and at that time,
something of the gentleness of the other face in the
room; the sweet face with the trusting eyes, made paler
than watching and sympathy made it, by the rich dark
hair.
Left alone with her mother, Louisa saw her lying with
an awful lull upon her face, like one who was floating
away upon some great water, all resistance over, con-
tent to be carried down the stream. She put the shadow
of a hand to her lips again, and recalled her.
“You were going to speak to me, mother.”
“Eh? Yes, to be sure, my dear. You know your
father is almost always away now, and therefore I must
write to him about it.”
“About what, mother? Don't be troubled. About
what?"
“You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have
said anything, on any subject, I have never heard the
last of it; and consequently, that I have long left off say-
ing anything."
“I can hear you, mother.” But it was only by dint
of bending down to her ear, and at the same time atten-
tively watching the lips as they moved, that she could
link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of
connexion.
“You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your
brother. Ologies of all kinds from morning to night.
If there is any Ology left, of any description, that has
not been worn to rags in this house, all I can say is, I
hope I shall never hear its name.”
"I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to
go on.” This, to keep her from floating away.
“But there is something—not an Ology at all—that
your father has missed or forgotten, Louisa. I don't know
what it is. I have often sat with Sissy near me, and

thought about it. I shall never get its name now. But
your father may. It makes me restless. I want to write
tò him to find out for God's sake what it is. Give me a
pen, give me a pen.”
Even the power of restlessness was gone, except
from the poor head, which could just turn from side to
side.
She fancied, however, that her request had been com-
plied with, and that the pen she could not have held was
in her hand. It matters little what figures of wonderful
no-meaning she began to trace upon her wrappers. The
hand soon stopped in the midst of them; the light that
had always been feeble and dim behind the weak trans-
parency, went out; and even Mrs. Gradgrind, emerged
from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth
himself in vain, took upon her the dread solemnity of
the sages and patriarchs.
CHAPTER X.
MRS. SPARSIT'S STAIRCASE.
MRS. SPARSIT's nerves being slow to recover their tone,
the worthy woman made a stay of some weeks in dura-
tion at Mr. Bounderby's retreat, where, notwithstanding
her anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming
consciousness of her altered station, she resigned her-
self with noble fortitude to lodging, as one may say, in
clover, and feeding on the fat of the land. During the
whole term of this recess from the guardianship of the
Bank, Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency; con-
tinuing to take such pity on Mr. Bounderby to his face,
as is rarely taken on man, and to call his portrait a
noodle to its face, with the greatest acrimony and con-
tempt.
Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive com-
position that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman
to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in
his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was), and
further that Louisa would have objected to her as a fre-
quent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that
she should object to anything he chose to do, resolved

187
not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily. So when her
nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming
sweet-breads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-
table, on the day before her departure, “I tell you
what, ma'am, you shall come down here of a Saturday,
while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.”
To which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of
the Mahomedan persuasion : “ To hear is to obey."
Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she
took an idea, in the nature of an allegorical fancy, into
her head. Much watching of Louisa, and much con-
stant observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which
keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit's edge, must
have given her as it were a lift, in the way of inspira-
tion. She erected in her mind a mighty Staircase, with
a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and down
those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw
Louisa coming.
It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit's life, to look
up at her staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.
Sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, sometimes sev-
eral steps at one bout, sometimes stopping, never turning
back. If she had once turned back, it might have been
the death of Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief.
She had been descending steadily, to the day, and on
the day, when Mr. Bounderby issued the weekly invita-
tion recorded above. Mrs. Sparsit was in good spirits,
and inclined to be conversational.
“ And pray, sir,” said she, “if I may venture to ask a
question appertaining to any subject on which you show
reserve-which is indeed hardy in me, for I well know
you have a reason for everything you do—have you re-
ceived intelligence respecting the robbery?”
“Why, ma'am, no; not yet. Under the circumstances,
I didn't expect it yet. Rome wasn't built in a day,
ma'am.”
“ Very true, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head.
“Nor yet in a week, ma'am.”
“No, indeed, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a gentle
melancholy upon her.
“In a similar manner, ma’am,” said Bounderby, “I
can wait, you know. If Romulus and Remus could
wait, Josiah Bounderby can wait. They were better
off in their youth than I was, however. They had a she-

wolf for a nurse; I had only a she-wolf for a grand-
mother. She didn't give any milk, ma'am; she gavə
bruises. She was a regular Ålderney at thai."
“Ah!" Mrs Sparsit sighed and shuddered!
“No, ma’am,” continued Bounderby, “I have not
heard anything more about it. It's in hand, though;
and young Tom, who rather sticks to business at present
-something new for him; he hadn't the schooling I had
-is helping. My injunction is, Keep it quiet, and let it
seem to blow over. Do what you like under the rose,
but don't give a sign of what you're about; or half a
hundred of 'em will combine together and get this fel.
low who has bolted, out of reach for good. Keep it quiet,
and the thieves will grow in confidence, by little and
little, and we shall have 'em."
“ Very sagacious indeed, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit.
“Very interesting. The old woman you mentioned,
sir_”
“The old woman I mentioned, ma’am,” said Boun-
derby, cutting the matter short, as it was nothing to
boast about, “is not laid hold of; but she may take her
oath she will be, if that is any satisfaction to her villain-
ous old mind. In the meantime, ma'am, I am of opinion,
if you ask me my opinion, that the less she is talked
about, the better.”
That same evening, Mrs. Sparsit, in her chamber win-
dow, resting from her packing operations, looked
towards her great staircase and saw Louisa still de-
scending
She sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden,
talking very low, he stood leaning over her, as they
whispered together, and his face almost touched her
hair. “If not quite!” said Mrs. Sparsit, straining her
hawk's eyes to the utmost. Mrs. Sparsit was too distant
to hear a word of their discourse, or even to know
that they were speaking softly, otherwise than from
the expression of their figures; but what they said
was this:
• You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?”
“Oh, perfectly!"
“His face, and his manner, and what he said?”
“Perfectly. And an infinitely dreary person he
appeared to me to be. Lengthy and prosy in the ex-
treme It was knowing to hold forth, in the humble-

virtue school of eloquence; but, I assure you I thought
at the time, My good fellow, you are over-doing
this!”
* It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that
man.”
“My dear Louisa-as Tom says.” Which he never did
say. “ You know no good of the fellow?"
*No, certainly.”
“Nor of any other such person?”
“How can I,” she returned, with more of her first
manner on her than he had lately seen, “when I know
nothing of them, men or women?
“My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submis-
sive representation of your devoted friend, who knows
something of several varieties of his excellent fellow-
creatures-for excellent they are, I am quite ready to
believe, in spite of such little foibles as always helping
themselves to what they can get hold of. This fellow
talks. Well; every fellow talks. He professes mo-
rality. Well; all sorts of humbugs profess mo-
rality. From the House of Commons to the House of
Correction, there is a general profession of morality, ex-
cept among our people; it really is that exception which
makes our people quite reviving. You saw and heard
the case. Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up
extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby
-who, as we know, is not possessed of that delicacy
which would soften so tight a hand. The member of
the fluffy classes was injured, exasperated, left the
house grumbling, met somebody who proposed to him
to go in for some share in this Bank business, went in,
put something in his pocket which had nothing in it be-
fore, and relieved his mind extremely. Really he would
have been an uncommon, instead of a common fellow,
if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity.
Or he may have originated it altogether, if he had the
cleverness.”
“I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,” re-
turned Louisa, after sitting thoughtful awhile, “to be
so ready to agree with you, and to be so lightened in
my heart by what you say.”
“I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse. I
have talked it over with my friend Tom more than once
--of course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with

Tom—and he is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of
nis. Will you walk?"
They strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be
indistinct in the twilight-she leaned on his arm and
she little thought how she was going down, down, down,
Mrs. Sparsit's staircase.
Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing. When
Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the
gulf, it might fall in upon her if it would; but, until
then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs. Spar-
sit's eyes. And there Louisa always was, upon it. And
always gliding down, down, down!
Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she
heard of him here and there; she saw the changes of the
face he had studied; she, too, remarked to a nicety how
and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept
her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with
no touch of compunction, all absorbed in interest. In
the interest of seeing her, ever drawing, with no hand
to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new
Giants' Staircase.
With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contra-
distinguished from his portrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the
smallest intention of interrupting the descent. Eager
to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for
the last fall as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest
of her hopes. Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary
gaze upon the stairs; and seldom so much as darkly
shook her right mitten (with her fist in it) at the figure
coming down.

CHAPTER XI.
LOWER AND LOWER.
THE figure descended the great stairs, steadily, stead-
ily; always verging, like a weight in deep water, to the
black gulf at the bottom.
Mr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife's decease, made
an expedition from London, and buried her in a busi-
ness-like manner. He then returned with promptitude
to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for
the odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the
dust about into the eyes of other people who wanted
other odds and ends-in fact resumed his parliamentary
duties.
In the meantime Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch
and ward. Separated from her staircase, all the week,
by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the
country-house, she yet maintained her cat-like observa-
tion of Louisa, through her husband, through her
brother, through James Harthouse, through the out-
sides of letters and packets, through everything animate
and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.
“ Your foot on the last step, my lady," said Mrs. Sparsit,
apostrophising the descending figure with the aid of her
threatening mitten, “and all your art shall never blind
me.”
Art or nature, though, the original stock of Louisa's
character, or the graft of circumstances upon it-her
curious reserve did baffle, while it stimulated, one as
sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit. There were times when Mr.
James Harthouse was not sure of her. There were
times when he could not read the face he had studied so
long, and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to
him than any woman of the world with a ring of satel-
lites to help her.
So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Boun-
derby was called away from home by business which
required his presence elsewhere for three or four days.
It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit
at the Bank, adding: “But you'll go down to-morrow,

ma'am, all the same. You'll go down just as if I was
there. It will make no difference to you.”
“Pray, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, “let
me beg you not to say that. Your absence will make a
vast difference to me, sir, as I think you very well
know.”
“Well, ma'am, then you must get on in my absence
as well as you can,” said Bounderby, not displeased.
“Mr. Bounderby,” retorted Mrs. Šparsit, “ your will is
to me a law, sir; otherwise, it might be my inclination
to dispute your kind commands, not feeling sure that it
will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive
me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.
But you shall say no more, sir. I will go, upon your in-
vitation.”
“Why, when I invite you to my house, ma’am,” said
Bounderby, opening his eyes, “I should hope you want
no other invitation.”
“No, indeed, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, “I should
hope not. Say no more, sir. I would, sir, I could see
you gay again.” .
" What do you mean, ma’am?” blustered Bounderby.
“Sir,” rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, “there was wont to be
an elasticity in you which I sadly miss. Be buoyant,
Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult
adjuration, backed up by her compassionate eye, could
only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner,
and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being
heard to bully the small fry of business all the morn-

patron was gone on his journey, and the Bank was clos-
ing, “present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas,
and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb
chop and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?”
Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in
that way, returned a gracious answer, and followed on
its heels. “Mr. Thomas,” said Mrs. Sparsit, “these
plain viands being on table, I thought you might be
tempted.” “Thank’ee, Mrs. Sparsit,” said the whelp.
And gloomily fell to.
“How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr, Tom?" asked Mrs.
Sparsit.

"Oh, he's all right,” said Tom.
“ Where may he be at present?” Mrs. Sparsit asked
in a light conversational manner after mentally de-
voting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommu-
nicative.
“ He is shooting in Yorkshire,” said Tom. “Sent Loo
a basket half as big as a church, yesterday.”
“The kind of gentleman, now," said Mrs. Sparsit,
sweetly, “whom one might wager to be a good shot!"
“Crack," said Tom.
He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but
this characteristic had so increased of late, that he never
raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together.
Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching
his looks, if she were so inclined,
“Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine," said
Mrs. Sparsit, “as indeed he is of most people. May we
expect to see him again shortly, Mr. Tom?"
“Why, I expect to see him to-morrow,” returned the
whelp.
“Good news!” cried Mrs. Sparsit, blandly.
“I have got an appointment with him to meet him in
the evening at the station here," said Tom, “and I am
going to dine with him afterwards, I believe. He is not
coming down to the country house for a week or so,
being due somewhere else. At least, he says so; but I
shouldn't wonder if he was to stop here over Sunday,
and stray that way.”
“Which reminds me!” said Mrs. Sparsit. “Would
you remember a message to your sister, Mr. Tom, if I
was to charge you with one?”
“Well? I'll try,” returned the reluctant whelp, “if it
isn't a long ’un.”
“It's merely my respectful compliments," said Mrs.
Sparsit, “and I fear I may not trouble her with my
society this week; being still a little nervous, and better
perhaps by my poor self.”
“Oh! If that's all,” observed Tom, “it wouldn't much
matter, even if I was to forget it, for Loo's not likely to
think of you unless she sees you."
Having paid for his entertainment with this agreeable
compliment, he relapsed into a hangdog silence until
there was no more India ale left, when he said, “ Well,
Mrs. Sparsit, I must be off!” and went off.

HARD TIMES.
Next day, Saturday, Mrs. Sparsit sat at her window
all day long: looking at the customers coming in and out,
watching the postmen, keeping an eye on the general
traffic of the street, revolving many things in her mind,
but, above all, keeping her attention on her staircase.
The evening come, she put on her bonnet and shawl, and
went quietly out: having her reasons for hovering in a
furtive way about the station by which a passenger
would arive from Yorkshire, and for preferring to peep
into it round pillars and corners, and out of ladies' wait-
ing-room windows, to appearing in its precincts openly.
Tom was in attendance and loitered about until the
expected train came in. It brought no Mr. Harthouse.
Tom waited until the crowd had dispersed, and the
bustle was over; and then referred to a posted list of
trains, and took counsel with porters. That done, he
strolled away idly, stopping in the street and looking
up it and down it, and lifting his hat off and putting it
on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and ex-
hibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be
expected in one who had still to wait until the next
train should come in, an hour and forty minutes hence.
"This is a device to keep him out of the way,” said
Mrs. Sparsit, starting from the dull office window whence
she had watched him last. “Harthouse is with his
sister now!"
It was the conception of an inspired moment, and she
shot off with her utmost swiftness to work it out. The
station for the country house was at the opposite end of
the town, the time was short, the road not easy; but she
was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach, so
quick in darting out of it, producing her money, seizing
her ticket, and diving into the train, that she was borne
along the arches spanning the land of coal-pits past and
present, as if she had been caught up in a cloud and
whirled away.
All the journey, immovable in the air though never
left behind; plain to the dark eyes of her mind, as the
electric wires which ruled a colossal strip of music-paper
out of the evening sky, were plain to the dark eyes of
her body; Mrs. Sparsit saw her staircase, with the figure
coming down. Very near the bottom now. Upon the
brink of the abyss.
An overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw

beneath its drooping eyelid Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her
carriage, pass down the wooden steps of the little station
into a stony road, cross it into a green lane, and become
hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches.
One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests,
and a bat heavily crossing and recrossing her, and the
reek of her own tread in the thick dust that felt like
velvet, were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she very
softly closed a gate.
She went up to the house, keeping within the shrub-
bery, and went round it, peeping between the leaves at
the lower windows. Most of them were open, as they
usually were in such warm weather, but there were no
lights yet, and all was silent. She tried the garden
with no better effect. She thought of the wood, and
stole towards it, heedless of the long grass and briers:
of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the creeping things
that be. With her dark eyes and her hook nose warily
in advance of her, Mrs. Sparsit softly crushed her way
through the thick undergrowth, so intent upon her object
that she probably would have done no less, if the wood
had been a wood of adders.
Hark!
The smaller birds might have tumbled out of their
nests, fascinated by the glittering of Mrs. Sparsit's eyes
in the gloom, as she stopped and listened.
Low voices close at hand. His voice and hers. The
appointment was a device to keep the brother away!
There they were yonder, by the felled tree.
Bending low among the dewy grass, Mrs. Sparsit
advanced closer to them. She drew herself up, and
stood behind a tree, like Robinson Crusoe in his ambus-
cade against the savages; so near to them that at a
spring, and that no great one, she could have touched
them both. He was there secretly and had not shown
himself at the house. He had come on horseback, and
must have passed through the neighbouring fields; for
his horse was tied to the meadow side of the fence, within
a few paces.
“My dearest love,” said he, “what could I do? Know-
ing you were alone, was it possible that I could stay
away?"
“ You may hang your head, to make yourself the
more attractive; I don't know what they see in you

when you hold it up,” thought Mrs. Sparsit; “but you
little think, my dearest love, whose eyes are on you!"
That she hung her head was certain. She urged him
to go away, she commanded him to go away; but she
neither turned her face to him, nor raised it. Yet it
was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the amiable
woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in
her life. Her hands rested in one another, like the
hands of a statue; and even her manner of speaking
was not hurried.
“My dear child,” said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw
with delight that his arm embraced her; “will you not
bear with my society for a little while?”
“Not here."
“ Where, Louisa?”.
“Not here."
“But we have so little time to make so much of, and
I have come so far, and am altogether so devoted, and
distracted. There never was a slave at once so devoted
and ill-used by his mistress. To look for your sunny
welcome that has warmed me into life, and to be re-
ceived in your frozen manner, is heart-rending.”
“Am I to say again, that I must be left to myself
here?”
“But we must meet, my dear Louisa. Where shall
we meet?”
They both started. The listener started, guiltily, too;
for she thought there was another listener among the
trees. It was only rain, beginning to fall fast, in heavy
drops.
"Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence,
innocently supposing that its master is at home and will
be charmed to receive me?"
“No!”
“Your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed;
though I am the most unfortunate fellow in the world,
I believe, to have been insensible to all other women,
and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of the
most beautiful, and the most engaging, and the most
imperious. My dearest Louisa, I cannot go myself, or
let you go, in this hard abuse of your power.”
Mrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling
arm, and heard him then and there, within her (Mrs.
Sparsit’s) greedy hearing, tell her how he loved her, and

how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to
play away all that he had in life. The objects he had
ſately pursued turned worthless beside her; such suc-
cess as was almost in his grasp, he flung away from him
like the dirt it was, compared with her. Its pursuit,
nevertheless, if it kept him near her, or its renunciation
if it took him from her, or flight if she shared it, or
secrecy if she commanded it, or any fate, or every fate,
all was alike to him, so that she was true to him-the
man who had seen how cast away she was, whom she
had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration,
an interest, of which he had thought himself incapable,
whom she had received into her confidence, who was
devoted to her and adored her. All this, and more, in
his hurry, and in hers, in the whirl of her own gratified
malice, in the dread of being discovered, in the rapidly
increasing noise of heavy rain among the leaves, and a
thunder-storm rolling up-Mrs. Sparsit received into her
mind, set off with such an unavoidable halo of confusion
and indistinctness, that when at length he climbed the
fence and led his horse away, she was not sure where
they were to meet, or when, except that they had said
it was to be that night.
But one of them yet remained in the darkness before
her; and while she tracked that one she must be right.
“ Oh, my dearest love,” thought Mrs. Sparsit, “ you
little think how well attended you are!"
Mrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood, and saw her
enter the house. What to do next? It rained now, in
a sheet of water. Mrs. Sparsit's white stockings were
of many colours, green predominating; prickly things
were in her shoes; caterpillers slung themselves, in
hammocks of their own making, from various parts of
her dress; rills ran from her bonnet and her Roman
nose. In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in
the density of the shrubbery, considering what next?
Lo, Louisa coming out of the house! Hastily cloaked
and muffled, and stealing away. She elopes! She
falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in
the gulf!
Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick, de-
termined step, she struck into a side-path parallel with
the ride. Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the
trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep

a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous
darkness.
When she stopped to close the side gate without
noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped. When she went on, Mrs.
Sparsit went on. She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had
come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony
road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad. A
train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs.
Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her first
place of destination.
In Mrs. Sparsit's limp and streaming state, no exten-
sive precautions were necessary to change her usual ap-
pearance; but she stopped under the lee of the station
wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on
over her bonnet. So disguised, she had no fear of being
recognised when she followed up the railroad steps and
paid her money in the small office, Louisa sat waiting
in a corner. Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in another corner.
Both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to
the rain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the
parapets of the arches. Two or three lamps were rained
out and blown out; so both saw the lightning to advan-
tage as it quivered and zig-zagged on the iron tracks.
The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, grad-
ually deepening to a complaint of the heart, announced
the train. Fire and steam, and smoke, and red light; a
hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek, Louisa put into one
carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little station
a desert speck in the thunder-storm.
Though her teeth chattered in her head from wet and
cold, Mrs. Sparsit exulted hugely. The figure had
plunged down the precipice, and she felt herself, as it
were, attending on the body. Could she, who had been
so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do
less than exult? “ She will be at Coketown long before
him,” thought Mrs. Sparsit, “though his horse is never
so good. Where will she wait for him? And where
will they go together? Patience. We shall see.”
The tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion,
when the train stopped at its destination. Gutters and
pipes had burst, drains had overflowed, and streets were
under water. In the first instant of alighting, Mrs.
Sparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting
coaches, which were in great request. “She will get

into one," she considered, “and will be away before I
can follow in another. At all risks of being run over, I
must see the number, and hear the order given to the
coachman.”
But, Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her calculation.
Louisa got into no coach, and was already gone. The
black eyes kept upon the railroad-carriage in which she
had travelled, settled upon it a moment too late. The
door not being opened after several minutes, Mrs. Spar-
sit passed it andrepassed it, saw nothing, looked in and
found it empty. Wet through and through: with her
feet squelching and squashing in her shoes whenever
she moved; with a rash of rain upon her classical visage;
with a bonnet like an over-ripe fig; with all her clothes
spoiled; with damp impressions of every button, string,
and hook-and-eye she wore, printed off upon her highly
connected back; with a stagnant verdure on her general
exterior, such as accumulates on an old park fence in a
mouldy lane; Mrs. Sparsit had no resource but to burst
into tears of bitterness and say, “I have lost her!”

DOWN.
The national dustmen, after entertaining one another
with a great many noisy little fights among themselves,
had dispersed for the present, and Mr. Gradgrind was
at home for the vacation.
He sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical
clock, proving something no doubt-probably, in the
main, that the Good Samaritan was a Bad Economist.
The noise of the rain did not disturb him much; but it
attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise
his head sometimes, as if he were rather remonstrating
with the elements. When it thundered very loudly, he
glanced towards Coketown, having it in his mind that
some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning.
The thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was
pouring down like a deluge, when the door of his room
opened. He looked round the lamp upon his table, and
saw, with amazement, his eldest daughter

“ Louisa!”
“Father, I want to speak to you."
“What is the matter? How strange you look! And,
good Heaven!” said Mr. Gradgrind, wondering more
and more, “have you come here exposed to this storm?"
She put her hands to her dress, as if she hardly knew.
6. Yes.” Then she uncovered her head, and letting her
cloak and hood fall where they might, stood looking at
him: so colourless, so dishevelled, so defiant and de-
spairing, that he was afraid of her.
- What is it? I conjure you, Louisa, tell me what is
the matter.”
She dropped into a chair before him, and put her cold
hand on his arm.
“Father, you have trained me from my cradle?”
“Yes, Louisa.”
“I curse the hour in which I was born to such a
destiny:”
He looked at her in doubt and dread, vacantly repeat-
ing: “ Curse the hour? Curse the hour?”.
“How could you give me life, and take from me all
the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of
conscious death? Where are the graces of my soul?
Where are the sentiments of my heart? What have you
done, oh, father, what have you done, with the garden
that should have bloomed once, in this great wilderness
here!"
She struck herself with both her hands upon her bosom.
“If it had ever been here, its ashes alone would save
me from the void in which my whole life sinks. I did
not mean to say this; but, father, you remember the last
time we conversed in this room?"
He had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard
now, that it was with difficulty he answered, “Yes,
Louisa.”
“What has risen to my lips now, would have risen to
my lips then, if you had given me a moment's help. I
don't reproach you, father. What you have never nur-
tured in me, you have never nurtured in yourself; but,
oh! if you had only done so long ago, or if you had only
neglected me, what a much better and much happier
creature I should have been this day!"
On hearing this, after all his care, he bowed his head
upon his hand and groaned aloud.

“Father, if you had known, when we were last to-
gether here, what even I feared while I strove against it
-as it has been my task from infancy to strive against
every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart; if
you had known that there lingered in my breast, sensi-
bilities, affections, weaknesses capable of being cher-
ished into strength, defying all the calculations ever
made by man, and no more known to his arithmetic
than his Creator is--would you have given me to the
husband whom I am now sure that I hate?"
He said, “No. No, my poor child.”
“ Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the
frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?
Would you have robbed me—for no one's enrichment-
only for the greater desolation of this world-of the im-
material part of my life, the spring and summer of my
belief, my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the
real things around me, my school in which I should have
learned to be more humble and more trusting with
them, and to hope in my little sphere to make them
better?"
“Oh, no, no. No, Louisa.”
“ Yet, father, if I had been stone blind; if I had groped
my way by my sense of touch, and had been free, while
I knew the shapes and surfaces of things, to exercise my
fancy somewhat, in regard to them; I should have been
a million times wiser, happier, more loving, more con-
tented, more innocent and human in all good respects,
than I am with the eyes I have. Now, hear what I have
come to say."
He moved, to support her with his arm. She rising
as he did so, they stood close together: she, with a hand
upon his shoulder, looking fixedly in his face.
“ With a hunger and thirst upon me, father, which
have never been for a moment appeased; with an ardent
impulse towards some region where rules, and figures,
and definitions were not quite absolute; I have grown
up, battling every inch of my way.”
“I never knew you were unhappy, my child.”
“Father, I always knew it. In this strife I have
almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a
demon. What I have learned has left me doubting, dis-
believing, despising, regretting, what I have not learned;
and my dismal resource has been to think that life

would soon go by, and that nothing in it could be worth
the pain and trouble of a contest.”
“And you so young, Louisa!” he said with pity.
“And I so young. In this condition, father—for I
show you now, without fear or favour, the ordinary
deadened state of my mind as I know it-you proposed
my husband to me. I took him. I never made a pre-
tence to him or you that I loved him. I knew, and,
father, you knew, and he knew, that I never did. I was
not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of being pleas-
ant and useful to Tom. I made that wild escape into
something visionary, and have slowly found out how
wild it was. But Tom had been the subject of all the
little tenderness of my life; perhaps he became so be-
cause I knew so well how to pity him. It matters little
now, except as it may dispose you to think more leni-
ently of his errors.”
As her father held her in his arms, she put her other
hand upon his other shoulder, and still looking fixedly
in his face, went on:
66 When I was irrevocably married, there rose up into
rebellion against the tie, the old strife, made fiercer by
all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two
individual natures, and which no general laws shall
ever rule or state for me, father, until they shall be able
to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the
secrets of my soul.”
“Louisa!” he said, and said imploringly; for he well
remembered what had passed between them in their
former interview.
"I do not reproach you, father, I make no complaint.
I am here with another object.”
“ What can I do, child? Ask me what you will.”
“I am coming to it. Father, chance then threw into
my way a new acquaintance; a man such as I had had
no experience of; used to the world; light, polished,
easy; making no pretences; avowing the low estimate
of everything, that I was half afraid to form in secret;
conveying to me almost immediately, though I don't
know how or by what degrees, that he understood me,
and read my thoughts. I could not find that he was
worse than I. There seemed to be a near affinity be-
tween us. I only wondered it should be worth his while,
who cared for nothing else, to care so much for me.”

“For you, Louisa!”
Her father might instinctively have loosened his hold,
but that he felt her strength departing from her, and
saw a wild, dilating fire in the eyes steadfastly regard-
ing him.
* I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confi-
dence. It matters very little how he gained it. Father,
he did gain it. What you know of the story of my
marriage, he soon knew, just as well.”
Her father's face was ashy white, and he held her in
both his arms.
“I have done no worse, I have not disgraced you.
But if you ask me whether I have loved him, or do love
him, I tell you plainly, father, that it may be so. I
don't know!"
She took her hand suddenly from his shoulders and
pressed them both upon her side; while in her face, not
like itself-and in her figure, drawn up, resolute to fin-
ish by a last effort what she had to say—the feelings
long suppressed broke loose.
“This night, my husband being away, he has been
with me, declaring himself my lover. This minute he
expects me, for I could release myself of his presence
by no other means. I do not know that I am sorry, I
do not know that I am ashamed, I do not know that I
am degraded in my own esteem. All that I know is
your philosophy and your teaching will not save me.
Now, father, you have brought me to this. Save me by
some other means!”
He tightened his hold in time to prevent her from
sinking on the floor, but she cried out in a terrible voice,
“I shall die if you hold me! Let me fall upon the
ground!” And he laid her down there, and saw the
pride of his heart and the triumph of his system lying,
an insensible heap, at his feet.

BOOK THE THIRD,
GARNERING.
CHAPTER I.
ANOTHER THING NEEDFUL.
LOUISA awoke from a torpor, and her eyes languidly
opened on her old bed at home, and her old room. It
seemed, at first, as if all that had happened since the
days when these objects were familiar to her were the
shadows of a dream; but gradually, as the objects be-
came more real to her sight, the events became more
real to her mind.
She could scarcely move her head for pain and heavi-
ness, her eyes were strained and sore, and she was very
weak. A curious passive inattention had such posses-
sion of her, that the presence of her little sister in the
room did not attract her notice for some time. Even
when their eyes had met, and her sister had approached
the bed, Louisa lay for minutes looking at her in silence,
and suffering her timidly to hold her passive hand, be-
fore she asked:
“When was I brought to this room?"
“Last night, Louisa.”
“Who brought me here?”
“Sissy, I believe.”
“Why do you believe so?”
“Because I found her here this morning. She didn't
come to my bedside to wake me, as she always does;
and I went to look for her. She was not in her own
room either; and I went looking for her all over the
house, until I found her here, taking care of you and
cooling your head. Will you see father? Sissy said I
was to tell him when you woke.”
“What a beaming face you have, Jane!” said Louisa,
as her young sister-timidly still—bent down to kiss
her,

“Have I? I am very glad you think so. I am sure
it must be Sissy's doings."
The arm Louisa had begun to twine about her neck
unbent itself. “You can tell father if you will.” Then,
staying her a moment, she said, “It was you who made
my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of wel-
come?"
“Oh, no, Louisa, it was done before I came. It was—"
Louisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more.
When her sister had withdrawn, she turned her head
back again, and lay with her face towards the door,
until it opened and her father entered.
He had a jaded, anxious look upon him, and his hand,
usually steady, trembled in hers. He sat down at the
side of the bed, tenderly asking how she was, and dwell-
ing on the necessity of her keeping very quiet after
her agitation and exposure to the weather last night.
He spoke in a subdued and troubled voice, very differ-
ent from his usual dictatorial manner; and was often
at a loss for words.
. “My dear Louisa. My poor daughter.” He was so
much at a loss at that place, that he stopped altogether.
He tried again.
“My unfortunate child.” The place was so difficult
to get over, that he tried again.
"It would be hopeless for me, Louisa, to endeavour
to tell you how overwhelmed I have been, and still am,
by what broke upon me last night. The ground on
which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet. The
only support on which I leaned, and the strength of
which it seemed, and still does seem, impossible to ques-
tion, has given way in an instant. I am stunned by
these discoveries. I have no selfish meaning in what I ·
say; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last
night to be very heavy indeed.”
She could give him no comfort herein. She had suf-
fered the wreck of her whole life upon the rock.
“I will not say, Louisa, that if you had, by any happy
chance, undeceived me some time ago, it would have
been better for us both; better for your peace, and better
for mine. For I am sensible that it may not have been a
part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind.
I have proved my-my system to myself, and I have
rigidly administered it, and I must bear the responsi-

bility of its failures. I only entreat you to believe, my
favourite child, that I have meant to do right.”
He said it earnestly, and, to do him justice, he had.
In gauging fathomless deeps with his little mean excise-
rod, and in staggering over the universe with his rusty
stiff-legged compasses, he had meant to do great things.
Within the limits of his short tether he had tumbled
about, annihilating the flowers of existence with greater
singleness of purpose than many of the blatant person-
ages whose company he kept.
“I am well assured of what you say, father. I know
I have been your favourite child. I know you have in-
tended to make me happy. I have never blamed you,
and I never shall."
He took her outstretched hand, and retained it in his.
“My dear, I have remained all night at my table, pon-
dering again and again on what has so painfully passed
between us. When I consider your character; when I
consider that what has been known to me for hours has
been concealed by you for years; when I consider under
what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at,
last; I come to the conclusion that I cannot but mistrust
myself.”
He might have added more than all, when he saw the
face now looking at him. He did add it in effect, per-
haps, as he softly moved her scattered hair from her
forehead with his hand. Such little actions, slight in
another man, were very noticeable in him; and his
daughter received them as if they had been words of
contrition,
“But,” said Mr. Gradgrind, slowly, and with hesita-
tion, as well as with a wretched sense of helplessness,
.“if I see reason to mistrnst myself for the past, Louisa,
I should also mistrust myself for the present and the
future. To speak unreservedly to you, I do. I am far
from feeling convinced now, however differently I
might have felt only this time yesterday, that I am fit
for the trust you repose in me; that I know how to
respond to the appeal you have come home to make to
me; that I have the right instinct-supposing it for the
moment to be some quality of that nature-how to help
you, and to set you right, my child.”
She had turned upon her pillow, and lay with her face
upon her arm, so that he could not see it. All her wild-

ness and passion had subsided; but, though softened,
she was not in tears. Her father was changed in
nothing so much as in the respect that he would have
been glad to see her in tears.
“Some persons hold,” he pursued, still hesitating,
“that there is a wisdom of the Head, and that there
is a wisdom of the Heart. I have not supposed so;
but, as I have said, I mistrust myself now. I have
supposed the Head to be all-sufficient. It may not
be all-sufficient; how can I venture this morning to say
it is! If that other kind of wisdom should be what I
have neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted,

He suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half un-
willing to admit it even now. She made him no answer;
lying before him on her bed, still half-dressed, much as
he had seen her lying on the floor of his room last night.
“Louisa,” and his hand rested on her hair again, “I
have been absent from here, my dear, a good deal of
late; and though your sister's training has been pursued
according to—the system,” he appeared to come to that
word with great reluctance always, “it has necessarily
been modified by daily associations begun, in her case,
at an early age. I ask you-ignorantly, and humbly,
my daughter-for the better, do you think?”
* Father,” she replied, without stirring, “if any har-
mony has been awakened in her young breast that was
mute in mine until it turned to discord, let her thank
Heaven for it, and go upon her happier way, taking it
as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way.”
“Oh, my child, my child!” he said, in a forlorn manner,
“I am an unhappy man to see you thus! What avails
it me that you do not reproach me, if I so bitterly re-
proach myself?” He bent his head and spoke low to her.
* Louisa, I have a misgiving that some change may
have been slowly working about me in this house, by.
mere love and gratitude; that what the Head had left
undone and could not do, the Heart may have been
doing silently. Can it be so?”.
She made him no reply.
“I am not too proud to believe it, Louisa. How
could I be arrogant, and you before me! Can it be so?
Is it so, my dear?”
He looked upon her, once more, lying cast away there;

and without another word went out of the room. He
had not been long gone, when she heard a light tread
near the door, and knew that some one stood beside
her.
She did not raise her head. A dull anger that she
should be seen in her distress, and that the involuntary
look she had so resented should come to this fulfilment,
smouldered within her like an unwholesome fire. All
closely imprisoned forces rend and destroy. The air
that would be healthful to the earth, the water that
would enrich it, the heat that would ripen it, tear it
when caged up. So in her bosom even now; the
strongest qualities she possessed, long turned upon
themselves, became a heap of obduracy, that rose.
against a friend.
It was well that soft touch came upon her neck, and
that she understood herself to be supposed to have fal-
len asleep. The sympathetic hand did not claim her
resentmert. Let it lie there, let it lie.
It lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler
thoughts; and she rested. As she softened with the
quiet, and the consciousness of being so watched, some
tears made their way into her eyes. The face touched
hers, and she knew that there were tears upon it, too,
and she the cause of them.
As Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy
retired, so that she stood placidly near the bed-side.
“I hope I have not disturbed you. I have come to ask
if you would let me stay with you.”
“Why should you stay with me? My sister will miss
you. You are everything to her.”
“Am I ?” returned Sissy, shaking her head. “I would
be something to you, if I might.”
“What?” said Louisa, almost sternly.
“Whatever you want most, if I could be that. At all
events, I would like to try to be as near it as I can.
And, however far off that may be, I will never tire of
trying. Will you let me?”
“My father sent you to ask me?”
“No, indeed,” replied Sissy. “He told me that I might
come in now, but he sent me away from the room this
morning-or at least-” She hesitated and stopped.
“At least, what?” said Louisa, with her searching eyes
upon her.

“I thought it best myself that I should be sent away,
for I felt very uncertain whether you would like to find
me here.”
“Have I always hated you so much?”
“I hope not, for I have always loved you, and have
always wished that you should know it. But you
changed to me a little, shortly before you left home.
Not that I wondered at it. You knew so much, and I
knew so little, and it was so natural in many ways, going
as you were among other friends, that I had nothing
to complain of, and was not at all hurt.”.
Her colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly.
Louisa understood the loving pretence, and her heart
smote her.
“May I try?” said Sissy, emboldened to raise her hand
to the neck that was insensibly drooping towards her..
Louisa, taking down the hand that would have em-
braced her in another moment, held it in one of hers,
and answered:
“First, Sissy, do you know what I am? I am so proud
and so hardened, so confused and troubled, so resentful
and unjust to every one and to myself, that everything is
stormy dark,and wicked to me. Does not that repel you?"
“No!”
“I am so unhappy, and all that should have made me
otherwise is so laid waste, that if I had been bereft of
sense to this hour, and instead of being as learned as
you think me, had to begin to acquire the simplest truths,
I could not want a guide to peace, contentment, honour,
all the good of which I am quite devoid, more abjectly
than I do. Does not that repel you?”
“No!"
In the innocence of her brave affection, and the brim-
ming up of her old devoted spirit, the onće deserted girl
shone like a beautiful light upon the darkness of the
other.
Louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck
and join its fellow there. She fell upon her knees, and
clinging to this stroller's child looked up at her almost
with veneration.
“Forgive me, pity me, help me! Have compassion
on my great need, and let me lay this need of mine
upon a loving heart?”
“Oh, lay it here!” cried Şissy. “Lay it here, my dear.”

CHAPTER II.
VERY RIDICULOUS.
MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE passed a whole night and a
day in a state of so much hurry, that the World, with
its best glass in its eye, would scarcely have recognised
him during that insane interval as the brother Jem of
the honourable and jocular member. He was positively
agitated. He several times spoke with an emphasis,
similar to the vulgar manner. He went in and went
out in an unaccountable way, like a man without an
object. He rode like a highwayman. In a word, he
was so horribly bored by existing circumstances, that
he forgot to go in for boredom in the manner prescribed
by the authorities.
After putting his horse at Coketown through the
storm, as if it were a leap, he waited up all night: from
time to time ringing his bell with the greatest fury,
charging the porter who kept watch with delinquency
in withholding letters or messages that could not fail
to have been entrusted to him, and demanding restitu-
tion on the spot. The dawn coming, the morning com-
ing, and the day coming, and neither message nor
letter coming with either, he went down to the country-
house. There, the report was, Mr. Bounderby away,
and Mrs. Bounderby in town. Left for town suddenly
last evening. Not even known to be gone until receipt of
message, importing that her return was not to be ex-
pected for the present.
In these circumstances he had nothing for it but to fol-
low her to town. He went to the house in town. Mrs.
Bounderby not there. He looked in at the Bank. Mr.
Bounderby away, and Mrs. Sparsit away. Mrs. Sparsit
away? Who could have been reduced to sudden ex-
tremity for the company of that griffin!
“ Well! I don't know," said Tom, who had his own
reasons for being uneasy about it. She was off some-
where at daybreak this morning. She's always full of
mystery; I hate her. So I do that white chap; he's
always got his blinking eyes upon a fellow.”

“ Where were you last night, Tom?"
“Where was I last night!" said Tom. “Come! I
like that. I was waiting for you, Mr. Harthouse, till it
came down as I never saw it come down before. Where
was I! Where were you, you mean.”
“I was prevented from coming--detained.”
“Detained!” murmured Tom. “Two of us were de-
tained. I was detained looking for you, till I lost every
train but the mail. It would have been a pleasant job
tc go down by that on such a night, and have to walk
home through a pond. I was obliged to sleep in town
after all."
“Where?”
“Where? Why, in my own bed at Bounderby's.”
“Did you see your sister?”.
“How the deuce," returned Tom, staring, “could I
see my sister when she was fifteen miles off?”
Cursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman
to whom he was so true a friend, Mr. Harthouse disem-
barrassed himself of that interview with the smallest
conceivable amount of ceremony, and debated for the
hundredth time what all this could mean? He made
only one thing clear. It was, that whether she was in
town or out of town, whether he had been premature
with her who was so hard to comprehend, or she had
lost courage, or they were discovered, or some mischance
or mistake, at present incomprehensible, had occurred,
he must remain to confront his fortune, whatever it
was. The hotel where he was known to live, when
condemned to that region of blackness, was the stake
to which he was tied. As to all the rest—what will be,
will be.
“So, whether I am waiting for a hostile message, or
an assignation, or a penitent remonstrance, or an im-
promptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby in the Lan-
cashire manner-which would seem as likely as any-
thing else in the present state of affairs—I'll dine,” said
Mr. James Harthouse. “Bounderby has the advantage
in point of weight; and if anything of a British nature
is to come off between us it may be as well to be in
training.”
Therefore he rang the bell, and tossing himself negli-
gently on a sofa, ordered, “Some dinner at six-with a
beefsteak in it," and got through the intervening time

as well as he could. That was not particularly well;
for he remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the
hours went on, and no kind of explanation offered it-
self, his perplexity augmented at compound interest.
However, he took affairs as coolly as it was in human
nature to do, and entertained himself with the facetious
idea of the training more than once. “It wouldn't be
bad,” he yawned at one time, “to give the waiter five
shillings, and throw him.” At another time it occurred
to him, “Or a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone
might be hired by the hour.” But these jests did not
tell materially on the afternoon, or his suspense; and,
sooth to say, they both lagged fearfully.
It was impossible, even before dinner, to avoid often
walking about in the pattern of the carpet, looking out
of the window, listening at the door for footsteps, and
occasionally becoming rather hot when any steps ap-
proached that room. But, after dinner, when the day
turned to twilight, and the twilight turned to night, and
still no communication was made to him, it began to be,
as he expressed it, “ like the Holy Office and slow tor-
ture.” However, still true to his conviction that indiffer-
ence was the genuine high-breeding (the only conviction
he had), he seized this crisis as the opportunity for order-
ing candles and a newspaper.
He had been trying in vain, for half an hour, to read
this newspaper, when the waiter appeared and said, at
once mysteriously and apologetically:
“Beg your pardon, sir. You're wanted, sir, if you
please."
A general recollection that this was the kind of thing
the Police said to the swell mob, caused Mr. Harthouse
to ask the waiter in return, with bristling indignation,
what the devil he meant by “wanted ?”
“Beg your pardon, sir. Young lady outside, sir,
wishes to see you."
“Outside? Where?"
“Outside this door, sir.”
Giving the waiter to the personage before-mentioned,
as a blockhead duly qualified for that consignment, Mr.
Harthouse hurried into the gallery. A young woman
whom he had never seen stood there. Plainly dressed,
very quiet, very pretty. As he conducted her into the
room and placed a chair for her, he observed, by the

light of the candles, that she was even prettier than he
had at first believed. Her face was innocent and youth-
ful, and its expression remarkably pleasant. She was
not afraid of him, or in any way disconcerted; she
seemed to have her mind entirely preoccupied with the
occasion of her visit, and to have substituted that con-
sideration for herself.
“I speak to Mr. Harthouse?” she said, when they were
alone.
“ To Mr. Harthouse.” He added in his mind, “ And
you speak to him with the most confiding eyes I ever
saw, and the most earnest voice (though so quiet) I ever
heard.”
“If I do not understand-and I do not, sir”_said
Sissy, “ what your honour as a gentleman binds you
to, in other matters:" the blood really rose in his face
as she began in these words: “I am sure I may rely
upon it to keep my visit secret, and to keep secret what
I am going to say. I will rely upon it, if you will tell me
I may so far trust-"
“ You may, assure you."
“I am young, as you see; I am alone, as you see. In
coming to you, sir, I have no advice or encouragement
beyond my own hope.”
He thought “But that is very strong," as he followed
the momentary upward glance of her eyes. He thought
besides, “This is a very odd beginning. I don't see
where we are going.”
“I think,” said Sissy, “you have already guessed
whom I left just now?”
“I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness
during the last four-and-twenty hours (which have ap-
peared as many years),” he returned, “on a lady's
account. The hopes I have been encouraged to form
that you come from that lady, do not deceive me, I
trust?"
“I left her within an hour.”
“ At-?”
“At her father's.”
Mr. Harthouse's face lengthened in spite of his cool-
ness, and his perplexity increased. “Then I certainly,”
he thought, "do not see where we are going.”
“She hurried there, last night. She arrived there in
great agitation, and was insensible all through the

night. I live at her father's, and was with her. You
may be sure, sir, you will never see her again, as long
as you live.”
Mr. Harthouse drew a long breath; and, if ever man
found himself in the position of not knowing what to
say, made the discovery, beyond all question, that he
was so circumstanced. The child-like ingenuousness
with which his visitor spoke, her modest fearlessness,
her truthfulness which put all artifice aside, her entire
forgetfulness of herself in her earnest quiet holding to
the object with which she had come; all this, together
with her reliance on his easily given promise—which in
itself shamed him-presented something in which he
was so inexperienced and against which he knew any
of his usual weapons would fall so powerless; that not
a word could he rally to his relief.
At last he said:
“ So startling an announcement, so confidently made,
and by such lips, is really disconcerting in the last de-
gree. May I be permitted to inquire, if you are charged
to convey that information to me in those hopeless
words, by the lady of whom we speak.”
“I have no charge from her.”.
“ The drowning man catches at the straw. With no
disrespect for your judgment, and with no doubt of
your sincerity, excuse my saying that I cling to the be-
lief that there is yet hope that I am not condemned to
perpetual exile from that lady's presence.”
"There is not the least hope. The first object of my
coming here, sir, is to assure you that you must believe
that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with
her again, than there would be if she had died when
she came home last night.”
“Must believe? But if I can't-or if I should, by in-
firmity of nature, be obstinate—and won't,”
“It is still true. There is no hope.”
James Harthouse looked at her with an incredu-
lous smile upon his lips; but her mind looked over
and beyond him, and the smile was quite thrown
away.
He bit his lip, and took a little time for consideration.
“Well! If it should unhappily appear,” he said,
“after due pains and duty on my part, that I am
brought to a position so desolate as this banishment, I

shall not become the lady's persecutor. But you said you
had no commission from her?”.
“I have only the commission of my love for her, and
her love for me. I have no other trust than that I have
been with her since she came home, and that she has
given me her confidence. I have no further trust than
that I know something of her character and her mar-
riage. Oh, Mr. Harthouse, I think you had that trust too!"
He was touched in the cavity where his heart should
have been-in that nest of addled eggs, where the birds
of heaven would have lived if they had not been
whistled away-by the fervour of this reproach.
“I am not a moral sort of fellow,” he said, “and I
never make any pretensions to the character of a moral
sort of fellow. I am as immoral as need be. At the
same time, in bringing any distress upon the lady who
is the subject of the present conversation, or in unfor-
tunately compromising her in any way, or in commit-
ting myself by any expression of sentiments towards her,
not perfectly reconcilable with-in fact with-the
domestic hearth; or in taking any advantage of her
father's being a machine, or of her brother's being a
whelp, or of her husband's being a bear; I beg to be al-
lowed to assure you that I have had no particularly evil
intentions, but have glided on from one step to another
with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical, that I had
not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long
until I began to turn it over. Whereas I find,” said Mr.
James Harthouse, in conclusion, “that it is really in
several volumes.”
Though he said all this in his frivolous way, the way
seemed, for that once, a conscious polishing of but an
ugly surface. He was silent for a moment: and then
proceeded with a more self-possessed air, though with
traces of vexation and disappointment that would not
be polished out.
"After what has been just now represented to me, in
a manner I find it impossible to doubt-I know of hardly
any other source from which I could have accepted it so
readily-I feel bound to say to you, in whom the confi-
dence you have mentioned has been reposed, that I
cannot refuse to contemplate the possibility (however
unexpected) of my seeing the lady no more. I am
solely to blame for the thing having come to this—and

--andl, I cannot say,” he added, rather hard up for a
general peroration, “that I have any sanguine expecta-
tion of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow, or that I
have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever.”
Sissy's face sufficiently showed that her appeal to him
was not finished. .
“You spoke,” he resumed, as she raised her eyes to
him again, “ of your first object. I may assume that
there is a second to be mentioned?”
“Yes.”
“Will you oblige me by confiding it?"
“Mr. Harthouse," returned Sissy, with a blending of
gentleness and steadiness that quite defeated him, and
with a simple confidence in his being bound to do what
she required, that held him at a singular disadvantage,
“ the only reparation that remains with you, is to leave
here immediately and finally. I am quite sure you can
mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have
done. I am quite sure that it is the only compensation
you have left it in your power to make. I do not say that
it is much, or that it is enough; but it is something, and
it is necessary. Therefore, though without any other
authority than I have given you, and even without the
knowledge of any other person than yourself and my-
self, I ask you to depart from this place to-night, under
an obligation never to return to it.”
If she had asserted any influence over him beyond her
plain faith in the truth and right of what she said; if
she had concealed the least doubt or irresolution, or had
harboured for the best purpose any reserve or pretence;
if she had shown, or feīt, the lightest trace of any sensi-
tiveness to his ridicule or his astonishment, or any re-
monstrance he might offer; he would have carried it
against her at this point. But he could as easily have
changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise, as
affect her. -
“But do you know,” he asked, quite at a loss, “ the
extent of what you ask? You probably are not aware
that I am here on a public kind of business, preposterous
enough in itself, but which I have gone in for, and sworn
by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desper-
ate manner? You probably are not aware of that, but
I assure you it's the fact.”
It had no effect on Sissy, fact or no fact.

“ Besides which,” said Mr. Harthouse, taking a turn
or two across the room, dubiously, “it's so alarmingly
absurd. It would make a man so ridiculous, after going
in for these fellows, to back out in such an incomprehen-
sible way.”
“I am quite sure," repeated Sissy, “ that it is the onl
reparation in your power, sir. I am quite sure, or
would not have come here.”
He glanced at her face, and walked about agair
“Upon my soul, I don't know what to say. So immensel
absurd!”
It fell to his lot, now, to stipulate for secrecy.
“ If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing,” h
said, stopping again presently, and leaning against th
chimney-piece, “it could only be in the most inviolabl
confidence.”
“I will trust to you, sir." returned Sissy, “and you
will trust to me.”
His leaning aginst the chimney-piece reminded him
of the night with the whelp. It was the self-same chim-
ney-piece, and somehow he felt as if he were the whelp
to-night. He could make no way at all.
“I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridicu-
lous position,” he said, after looking down, and look-
ing up, and laughing, and frowning, and walking off,
and walking back again. “But I see no way out of it.
What will be, will be. This will be, I suppose! I must
take off myself, I imagine-in short, I engage to do it.”
Sissy rose. She was not surprised by the result, but
she was happy in it, and her face beamed brightly.
“You will permit me to say,” continued Mr. James
Harthouse, “ that I doubt if any other ambassador, or
ambassadress, could have addressed me with the same
success. I must not only regard myself as being in a
very ridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all
points. Will you allow me the privilege of remember-
ing my enemy's name?”
"My name?” said the ambassadress.
“The only name I could possibly care to know, to-
night.”
*Sissy Jupe.”
“Pardon my curiosity at parting. Related to the

“I am only a poor girl,” returned Sissy. “I was sep-

arated from my father-he was only a stroller-and
taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind. I have lived in the
house ever since.”
She was gone.
"It wanted this to complete the defeat,” said Mr.
James Harthouse, sinking, with a resigned air, on the
sofa, after standing transfixed a little while. “The de-
feat may now be considered perfectly accomplished.
Only a poor girl-only a stroller-only James Harthouse
made nothing of-only James Harthouse a Great Pyra-
mid of failure.”
The Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the
Nile. He took a pen upon the instant, and wrote the
following note (in appropriate hieroglyphics) to his
brother:
he hads in a andscapeight supble
* Dear Jack:-All up at Coketown. Bored out of the
place, and going in for camels. Affectionately,
'JEM.”
He rang the bell.
“Send my fellow here."
“Gone to bed, sir.”
“Tell him to get up, and pack up."
· He wrote two more notes. One to Mr. Bounderby, an-
nouncing his retirement from that part of the country,
and showing where he would be found for the next fort-
night. The other, similar in effect, to Mr. Gradgrind.
Almost as soon as the ink was dry upon their super-
scriptions, he had left the tall chimneys of Coketown
behind, and was in a railway carriage, tearing and
glaring over the dark landscape.
The moral sort of fellows might suppose that Mr.
James Harthouse derived some comfortable reflections
afterwards, from this prompt retreat, as one of his few
actions that made any amends for anything, and as a
token to himself that he had escaped the climax of a
very bad business. But it was not so at all. A secret
sense of having failed and been ridiculous-a dread of
what other fellows who went in for similar sorts of
things would say at his expense if they knew it-so op-
pressed him that what was about the very best passage
in his life was the one of all others he would not have
owned to on any account, and the only one that made •
him ashamed of himself.

CHAPTER III.
VERY DECIDED.
The indefatigable Mrs. Sparsit, with a violent cold
upon her, her voice reduced to a whisper, and her stately
frame so racked by continual sneezes that it seemed in
danger of dismemberment, gave chase to her patron until
she found him in the metropolis; and there, majestically
sweeping in upon him at his hotel in St. James's Street,
exploded the combustibles with which she was charged,
and blew up. Having executed her mission with infinito
relish, this high-minded woman then fainted away on
Mr. Bounderby's coat-collar.
Mr. Bounderby's first procedure was to shake Mrs.
Sparsit off, and leave her to progress as she might
through various stages of suffering on the floor. He
next had recourse to the administration of potent
restoratives, such as screwing the patient's thumbs,
smiting her hands, abundantly watering her face, and
inserting salt in her mouth. When these attentions
had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled
her into a fast train without offering any other refresh-
ment, and carried her back to Coketown more dead than
alive.
Regarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an in-
teresting spectacle on her arrival at her journey's end;
but considered in any other light, the amount of dam-
age she had by that time sustained was excessive, and
impaired her claims to admiration. Utterly heedless of
the wear and tear of her clothes and constitution, and
adamant to her pathetic sneezes, Mr. Bounderby imme-
diately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to
Stone Lodge.
“Now, Tom Gradgrind," said Bounderby, bursting
into his father-in-law's room late at night; “here's a
lady here—Mrs. Sparsit-you know Mrs. Sparsit—who
has something to say to you that will strike you dumb,”
“You have missed my letter!” exclaimed Mr. Grad-
grind, surprised by the apparition.
“Missed your letter, sir!" bawled Bounderby, “ The

present time is no time for letters. No man shall talk
to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters, with
his mind in the state it's in now.”
“Bounderby,” said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of tem-
perate remonstrance, “I speak of a very special letter I
have written to you in reference to Louisa.”
“ Tom Gradgrind,” replied Bounderby, knocking the
flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on
the table, “I speak of a very special messenger that
has come to me, in reference to Louisa. Mrs. Sparsit,
ma'am, stand forward!”
That unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer
testimony, without any voice and with painful gestures
expressive of an inflamed throat, became so aggravat-
ing and underwent so many facial contortions, that Mr. ·
Bounderby, unable to bear it, seized her by the arm and
shook her.
“If you can't get it out, ma'am,” said Bounderby,
“leave me to get it out. This is not a time for a lady,
however highly connected, to be totally inaudible, and
seemingly swallowing marbles. Tom Gradgrind, Mrs.
Sparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a situation
to overhear a conversation out of doors between your
daughter and your precious gentleman-friend, Mr. James
Harthouse.
“Indeed!” said Mr. Gradgrind.
“Ah! Indeed!” cried Bounderby. “And in that con-
versation”
"It is not necessary to repeat its tenor, Bounderby.
I know what passed.”
“You do? Perhaps,” said Bounderby, starting with
all his might at his so quiet and assuasive father-in-
law, “you know where your daughter is at the present
time?”
“ Undoubtedly. She is here."
6 Here?"
“My dear Bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these
loud outbreaks, on all accounts. Louisa is here. The
moment she could detach herself from that interview
with the person of whom you speak, and whom I deeply
regret to have been the means of introducing to you,
Louisa hurried here, for protection. I myself had not
been at home many hours, when I received her-here,
in this room. She hurried by the train to town, she ran

from town to this house through a raging storm, and
presented herself before me in a state of distraction.
Of course, she has remained here ever since. Let me
entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to be more
quiet.”
Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some
moments, in every direction except Mrs. Sparsit's direc-
tion; and then, abruptly turning upon the niece of Lady
Scadgers, said to that wretched woman:
“Now, ma'am! We shall be happy to hear any little
apology you may think proper to offer, for going about
the country at express pace, with no other luggage than
a Cock-and-a-Bull, ma'am!”
“Sir,” whispered Mrs. Sparsit, “my nerves are at
present too much shaken, and my health is at present
too much impaired, in your service, to admit of my doing
more than taking refuge in tears."
(Which she did.)
às Well, ma'am," said Bounderby, - without making
any observation to you that may not be made with pro-
priety to a woman of good family, what I have got to
add to that, is that there is something else in which it
appears to me you may take refuge, namely, a coach.
And the coach in which we came here, being at the
door, you'll allow me to hand you down to it, and pack
you home to the Bank; where the best course for you
to pursue will be to put your feet into the hottest water
you can bear, and take a glass of scalding rum and but-
ter after you get into bed.” With these words. Mr.
Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping
lady and escorted her to the conveyance in question,
shedding many plaintive sneezes by the way. He soon
returned alone.
“Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Grad-
grind, that you wanted to speak to me," he resumed,
Where I am. But I am not in a very agreeable state, Í
tell you plainly; not relishing this business, even as it
is, and not considering that I am at any time as duti-
fully and submissively treated by your daughter, as
Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be treated by
his wife. You have your opinion, I dare say; and I
have mine, I know; if you mean to say anything to
me to-night that goes against this candid remark, you
had better let it alone."

Mr. Gradgrind, it will be observed, being much soft-
ened, Mr. Bounderby took particular pains to harden
himself at all points. It was his amiable nature.
“My dear Bounderby,” Mr. Gradgrind began to
reply:
*Now, you'll excuse me,” said Bounderby, “but I
don't want to be too dear. That to start with. When I
begin to be dear to a man, I generally find that his in-
tention is to come over me. I am not speaking to you
politely; but, as you are aware, I am not polite. If you
like politeness, you know where to get it. You have
your gentlemen-friends, you know, and they'll serve you
with as much of the article as you want. I don't keep
it myself.”
“Bounderby," urged Mr. Gradgrind, “we are all lia-
ble to mistakes"
“I thought you couldn't make 'em,” interrupted
Bounderby.
“Perhaps I thought so. But, I say we are all liable
to mistakes; and I should feel sensible of your delicacy,
and grateful for it, if you would spare me these refer-
ences to Harthouse. I shall not associate him' in our
conversation with your intimacy and encouragement;
pray do not persist in connecting him with mine.”
“I never mentioned his name!" said Bounderby.
“ Well, well!” returned Mr. Gradgrind, with a patient,
even a submissive air. And he sat for a little while
pondering. “Bounderby, I see reason to doubt whether
we have ever quite understood Louisa.”
“Who do you mean by we?”
“Let me say I, then,” he returned, in answer to the
coarsely blurted question; “I doubt whether I have un-
derstood Louisa. I doubt whether I have been quite
right in the manner of her education.”
* There you hit it,” returned Bounderby. “There I
agree with you. You have found it out at last, have
you? Education! I'll tell you what education is—to be
tumbled out of doors, neck and crop, and put upon the
shortest allowance of everything except blows. That's
what I call education.”
“I think your good sense will perceive,” Mr. Grad-
grind remonstrated in all humility, “that whatever the
merits of such a system may be, it would be difficult of
general application to girls,

“I don't see it at all, sir,” returned the obstinate Boun-
derby.
“Well,” sighed Mr. Gradgrind, “we will not enter
into the question. I assure you I have no desire to be con-
troversial. I seek to repair what is amiss, if I possibly
can; and I hope you will assist me in a good spirit,
Bounderby, for I have been much distressed.”
“I don't understand you, yet," said Bounderby, with
determined obstinacy, “and therefore I won't make
any promises.”
• In the course of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,"
Mr. Gradgrind proceeded, in the same depressed and
propitiatory manner, “I appear to myself to have be-
come better informed as to Louisa's character, than in
previous years. The enlightenment has been painfully
forced upon me, and the discovery is not mine. I think
there are-Bounderby, you will be surprised to hear me
say this-I think there are qualities in Louisa, which-
which have been harshly neglected, and—and a little
perverted! And-and I would suggest to you that,
that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour
to leave her to her better nature for a while and to en-
courage it to develope itself by tenderness and consider-
ation-it-it would be the better for the happiness of all
of us. Louisa,” said Mr. Gradgrind, shading his face
with his hand, “has always been my favourite child.”
The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to
such an extent on hearing these words, that he seemed
to be, and probably was, on the brink of a fit. With his
very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent up
his indignation, however, and said:
“You'd like to keep her here for a time?”
“I-I had intended to recommend, my dear Boun-
derby, that you should allow Louisa to remain here on
a visit, and be attended by Sissy (I mean of course
Cecilia Jupe), who understands her, and in whom she
trusts."
“I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,” said Boun-
derby, standing up with his hands in his pockets,
“ that you are of opinion that there's what people
call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and
myself.”
“I fear there is at present a general incompatibility
between Louisa and--and--and almost all the relations

here, Teing hinets, an
in which I have placed her," was her father's sorrowful
reply.
* Now, look you here, Tom Gradgrind,” said Boun-
derby the flushed, confronting him with his legs wide
apart, his hands deeper in his pockets, and his hair like
a hayfield wherein his windy anger was boisterous.
6You have said your say; I am going to say mine. I
am a Coketown man. I am Josiah Bounderby of Coke-
town. I know the bricks of this town, and I know the
works of this town, and I know the chimneys of this
town, and I know the smoke of this town, and I know
the Hands of this town. I know 'em all pretty well.
They're real. When a man tells me anything about
imaginative qualities, I always tell that man, whoever
he is, that I know what he means. He means turtle
soup and venison, with a gold spoon, and that he wants
to be set up with a coach and six. That's what your
daughter wants. Since you are of opinion that she
ought to have what she wants, I recommend you to
provide it for her. Because, Tom Gradgrind, she will
never have it from me.”
“Bounderby,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “I hoped, after
my entreaty, you would have taken a different tone."
• “Just wait a bit,” retorted Bounderby, “you have
said your say, I believe. I heard you out; hear me out,
if you please. Don't make yourself a spectacle of un-
fairness as well as inconsistency, because, although I
am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present
position, I should be doubly sorry to see him brought so.
low as that. Now, there's an incompatibility of some
sort or another, I am given to understand by you, be-
tween your daughter and me. I'll give you to under-
stand, in reply to that, that there unquestionably is an
incompatibility of the first magnitude-to be summed
up in this—that your daughter don't properly know her
husband's merits, and is not impressed with such a
sense as would become her, by George! of the honour
of his alliance. That's plain speaking, I hope.”
“Bounderby," urged Mr. Gradgrind, “this is un-
reasonable.”
“Is it?” said Bounderby. “I am glad to hear you
say so. Because when Tom Gradgrind, with his new
lights, tells me that what I say is unreasonable, I am con-
vinced at once it must be devilish sensible. With your

permission I am going on. You know my origin; and you
know that for a good many years of my life I didn't
want a shoeing-horn, in consequence of not having a
shoe. Yet you may believe or not, as you think proper,
that there are ladies-born ladies-belonging to families-
Families!—who next to worship the ground I walk on."
He discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law's
head.
“ Whereas your daughter,” proceeded Bounderby, “is
far from being a born lady. That you know yourself.
Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff about such
things, for you are very well aware I don't; but that
such is the fact, and you, Tom Gradgrind, can't change
it. Why do I say this?”
“Not, I fear,” observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low voice,
“to spare me.”
“Hear me out,” said Bounderby," and refrain from
cutting in till your turn comes round. I say this, because
highly connected females have been astonished to see
the way in which your daughter has conducted herself,
and to witness her insensibility. They have wondered
how I have suffered it. And I wonder myself now, and
I won't suffer it.”
“Bounderby,” returned Mr. Gradgrind, rising, “the
less we say to-night the better, I think.”
“On the contrary, Tom Gradgrind, the more we say
to-night, the better, I think. That is,” the consideration
checked him, “till I have said all I mean to say, and
then I don't care how soon we stop. I come to a question
that may shorten the business. What do you mean by
the proposal you made just now?”
" What do I mean, Bounderby?”
“By your visiting proposition,” said Bounderby, with
an inflexible jerk of the hayfield.
“I mean that I hope you may be induced to arrange
in a friendly manner, for allowing Louisa a period of
repose and reflection here, which may tend to a gradual
alteration for the better in many respects.”
“To a softening down of your ideas of the incompati-
bility?” said Bounderby.
“If you put it in those terms.”
“What made you think of this?” said Bounderby.
“I have already said I fear Louisa has not been un-
derstood. Is it asking too much, Bounderby, that you,

so far her elder, should aid in trying to set her right?
You have accepted a great charge of her; for better for
worse, for—"
Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repeti-
tion of his own words to Stephen Blackpool, but he cut
the quotation short with an angry start.
“Come!” said he, “I don't want to be told about that.
I know what I took her for, as well as you do. Never
you mind what I took her for; that's my look out.”
“I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that
we may all be more or less in the wrong, not even ex-
cepting you; and that some yielding on your part, re-
membering the trust you have accepted, may not only
be an act of true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred
towards Louisa.”
“I think differently,” blustered Bounderby. “I am
going to finish this business according to my own
opinions. Now, I don't want to make a quarrel of it
with you, Tom Gradgrind. To tell the truth, I don't
think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on
such a subject. As to your gentleman-friend, he may
take himself off wherever he likes best. If he falls in
my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don't fall in my
way, I shan't, for it won't be worth my while to do it. As
to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and
might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she
don't come home to-morrow by twelve o'clock at noon, I
shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I
shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here,
and you'll take charge of her for the future. What I
shall say to people in general, of the incompatibility that
led to my so laying down the law, will be this. I am
Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing up; she's the
daughter of Tom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-
up; and the two horses wouldn't pull together. I am
pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, I
believe; and most people will understand fast enough
that it must be a woman rather out of the common, also,
who, in the long run, would come up to my mark.”
“Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this,
Bounderby,” urged Mr. Gradgrind,“ before you com-
mit yourself to such a decision.”
“ I always come to a decision,” said Bounderby, toss-
ing his hat on: “and whatever I do, I do at once. I

should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind's addressing such
a remark to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, knowing
what he knows of him, if I could be surprised by any-
thing Tom Gradgrind did, after his making himself a
party to sentimental humbug. I have given you my
decision, and I have got no more to say. Good-night!”
So Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to
bed. At five minutes past twelve o'clock next day, he
directed Mrs. Bounderby's property to be carefully
packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind's; advertised his
country retreat for sale by private contract; and re-
sumed a bachelor life.
CHAPTER IV.
LOST.
THE robbery at the Bank had not languished before,
and did not cease to occupy a front place in the atten-
tion of the principal of that establishment now. In
boastful proof of his promptitude and activity, as a re-
markable man, and a self-made man, and a commercial
wonder more admirable than Venus, who had risen out
of the mud instead of the sea, he liked to show how
little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour.
Consequently, in the first few weeks of his resumed
bachelorhood, he even advanced upon his usual display
of bustle, and every day made such a rout in renewing
his investigations into the robbery, that the officers who
had it in hand almost wished it had never been com-
mitted.
They were at fault too, and off the scent. Although
they had been so quiet since the first outbreak of the
matter, that most people really did suppose it to have
been abandoned as hopeless, nothing new occurred. No
implicated man or woman took untimely courage, or
made a self-betraying step. More remarkable yet,
Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and the mys-
terious old woman remained a mystery.
Things having come to this pass, and showing no
latent signs of stirring beyond it, the upshot of Mr.
Bounderby's investigations was, that he resolved to
hazard a bold burst. He drew up a placard, offering

I left the ti he had the heet; and
Twenty Pounds reward for thë apprehension of Stephen
Blackpool, suspected of complicity in the robbery of the
Coketown Bank on such a night; he described the said
Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated
height, and manner, as minutely as he could; he recited
how he had left the town, and in what direction he had
been last seen going; he had the whole printed in great
black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the
walls to be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it
should strike upon the sight of the whole population at
one blow.
The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that
morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in
the tardy daybreak, collected round the placards, de-
vouring them with eager eyes. Not the least eager of
the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could
not read. These people, as they listened to the friendly
voice that read aloud-there was always some such
ready to help them-stared at the characters which
meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would
have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignor-
ance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of
evil. Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the
matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rat-
tling looms, and whirring wheels, for hours afterwards;
and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets,
there were still as many readers as before.
Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience
too that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean
bill from the printer, and had brought it in his pocket.
Oh, my friends and fellow-countrymen, the down-trodden
operatives of Coketown, oh, my fellow-brothers and
fellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellow-men,
what a to-do was there, when Slackbridge unfolded
what he called “that damning document,” and held it
up to the gaze, and for the execration of the working-
man community!“Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what
a traitor in the camp of those great spirits who are en-
rolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and of Union is
appropriately capable! Oh, my prostrate friends, with
the galling yoke of tyrants on your necks and the iron
foot of despotism treading down your, fallen forms into
the dust of the earth, upon which right glad would your
oppressors be to see you creeping on your bellies all the

days of your lives, like the serpent in the garden--oh,
my brothers, and shall I as a man not add, my sisters
too, what do you say, now, of Stephen Blackpool, with
a slight stoop in his shoulders and about five foot seven
in height, as set forth in this degrading and disgusting
document, this blighting bill, this pernicious placard,
this abominable advertisement; and with what majesty
of denouncement will you crush the viper, who would
bring this stain and shame upon the God-like race that
happily has cast him out forever! Yes, my compatriots,
happily cast him out and sent him forth! For you re-
member how he stood here before you on this platform;
you remember how, face to face and foot to foot, I pur-
sued him through all his intricate windings; you re-
member how he sneaked and slunk, and sidled, and
.splitted of straws, until, with not an inch of ground to
which to cling, I hurled him out from amongst us: an
object for the undying finger of scorn to point at, and
for the avenging fire of every free and thinking mind
to scorch and sear! And now, my friends—my labour-
ing friends, for I rejoice and triumph in that stigma-
my friends whose hard but honest beds are made in toil,
and whose scanty but independent pots are boiled in
hardship; and, now I say, my friends, what appellation
has that dastard craven taken to himself, when, with
the mask torn from his features, he stands before us in
all his native deformity, a What? A thief! A plun-
derer! A proscribed fugitive, with a price upon his
head ; a fester and a wound upon the noble character of
the Coketown operative! Therefore, my band of brothers
in a sacred bond, to which your children and your chil-
dren's children yet unborn have set their infant hands
and seals, I propose to you on the part of the United
Aggregate Tribunal, ever watchful for your welfare,
ever zealous for your benefit, that this meeting does
Resolve; That Stephen Blackpool, weaver, referred to
in this placard, having been already solemnly disowned
by the community of Coketown Hands, the same are
free from the shame of his misdeeds, and cannot as a
class be reproached with his dishonest actions!”
Thus Slackbridge; gnashing and perspiring after a
prodigious sort. A few stern voices called out “No!”
and a score or two hailed, with assenting cries of “Hear,
hear!" the caution from one man, “Slackbridge, y'or

over hetter int; y' or a goen too fast!" But these were
pigmies against an army; the general assemblage sub-
scribed to the gospel according to Slackbridge, and gave
three cheers for him, as he sat demonstratively panting
at them.
These men and women were yet in the streets, pass-
ing quietly to their homes, when Sissy, who had been
called away from Louisa some minutes before, re-
turned.
“Who is it?" asked Louisa.
“It is Mr. Bounderby,” said Sissy, timid of the name,
" and your brother Mr. Tom, and a young woman who
says her name is Rachael, and that you know her.”
• What do they want, Sissy, dear?”
“They want to see you. Rachael has been crying,
and seems angry.”
“ Father,” said Louisa, for he was present, “I cannot
refuse to see them, for a reason that will explain itself.
Shall they come in here?”
As he answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away
to bring them. She re-appeared with them directly.
Tom was last; and remained standing in the obscurest
part of the room, near the door.
“Mrs. Bounderby," said her husband, entering with a
cool nod, “I don't disturb you, I hope. This is an un-
seasonable hour, but here is a young woman who has
been making statements which render my visit neces-
sary. Tom Gradgrind, as your son, young Tom, refuses
for some obstinate reason or other to say anything at all
about those statements, good or bad, I am obliged to
confront her with your daughter.”
“You have seen me once before, young lady,” said
Rachael, standing in front of Louisa.
Tom coughed.
“ You have seen me, young lady,” repeated Rachael,
as she did not answer, “once before.”
Tom coughed again.
“ I have.”
Rachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Boun-
derby, and said, “Will you make it known, young lady,
where, and who was there?"
“I went to the house where Stephen Blackpool lodged,
on the night of his discharge from his work, and I saw
you there. He was there, too; and an old woman who

did not speak, and whom I could scarcely see, stood in
a dark corner. My brother was with me.”
“Why couldn't you say so, young Tom?” demanded
Bounderby.
“I promised my sister I wouldn't.” Which Louisa
hastily confirmed.“ And, besides,” said the whelp, bit-
terly, “ she tells her own story so precious well-and so
full—that what business had I to take it out of her
mouth!”
“Say, young lady, if you please,” pursued Rachael,
“why, in an evil hour, you ever came to Stephen's that
night.”
* I felt compassion for him," said Louisa, her colour
deepening, “and I wished to know what he was going
to do, and wished to offer him assistance.”
“ Thank you, ma'am,” said Bounderby. “Much flat-
tered and obliged.”
“Did you offer him, asked Rachael, “a bank-note?”
“Yes; but he refused it, and would only take two
pounds in gold.”
Rachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again.
“ Oh, certainly,” said Bounderby. “If you put the
question whether your ridiculous and improbable ac-
count was true or not, I am bound to say it's con-
firmed.”
“Young lady,” said Rachael, “ Stephen Blackpool is
now named as a thief in public print all over this town,
and where else! There have been a meeting to-night
where he have been spoken of in the same shameful
way. Stephen! The honestest lad, the truest lad, the
best!” Her indignation failed her, and she broke off,
sobbing.
“I am very, very sorry,” said Louisa.
“Oh, young lady, young lady,” returned Rachael, “I
hope you may be, but I don't know! I can't say what
you may ha' done! The like of you don't know us, don't
care for us, don't belong to us. I am not sure why you
may ha' come that night. I can't tell but what you may
ha' come wi' some aim of your own, not mindin to what
trouble you brought such as the poor lad. I said then,
Bless you for coming; and I said it of my heart, you
seemed to take so pitifully to him; but I don't know now,
I don't know!"
Louisa could not reproach her for her unjust suspi-

cions; she was so faithful to her idea of the man, and so
afflicted.
“And when I think,” said Rachael through her sobs.
" that the poor lad was so grateful, thinkin you so good
to him—when I mind that he put his hand over his hard-
worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there
--oh, I hope you may be sorry, and ha' no bad cause to
be it; but I don't know, I don't know!"
"You're a pretty article," growled the whelp, moving
uneasily in his dark corner, “to come here with these
precious imputations! You ought to be bundled out for
not knowing how to behave yourself, and you would be
by rights.”
She said nothing in reply; and her low weeping was
the only sound that was heard, until Mr. Bounderby
spoke.
“Come!" said he, “ you know what you have engaged
to do. You had better give your mind to that; not
this.”
6 'Deed, I am loath," returned Rachael, drying her
eyes, “that any here should see me like this; but I won't
be seen so again. Young lady, when I had read what's
put in print of Stephen-and what has just as much
truth in it as if it had been put in print of you,I went
straight to the Bank to say I knew where Stephen was,
and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be
here in two days. I couldn't meet wi’ Mr. Bounderby
then, and your brother sent me away, and I tried to find
you, but you was not to be found, and I went back to
work. Soon as I come out of the Mill to-night, I hastened
to hear what was said of Stephen-for I know wi' pride
he will come back to shame it!-and then I went again
to seek Mr. Bounderby, and I found him, and I told him
every word I knew; and he believed no word I said, and
brought me here."
“So far, that's true enough," assented Mr. Bounderby,
with his hands in his pockets and his hat on. “But I
have known you people before to-day, you'll observe,
and I know you never die for want of talking. Now, I
recommend you not so much to mind talking just now,
as doing. You have undertaken to do something; all I
remark upon that at present is, do it!”
“I have written to Stephen by the post that went out
this afternoon, as I have written to him once before sin

cion inen; not
he went away,” said Rachael; “ and he will be here at
furthest, in two days.”
“Then, I'll tell you something. You are not aware,
perhaps,” retorted Mr. Bounderby, “that you yourself
have been looked after now and then, not being con-
sidered quite free from suspicion in this business, on
account of most people being judged according to the
company they keep. The post-office hasn't been for-
gotten either. What I'll tell you is, that no letter to
Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it. Therefore, what
has become of yours, I leave you to guess. Perhaps
you're mistaken, and never wrote any."
“He hadn't been gone from here, young lady,” said
Rachael, turning appealingly to Louisa, “as much as a
week, when he sent me the only letter I have had from
him, saying that he was forced to seek work in another
name.”
“Oh, by George!” cried Bounderby, shaking his head,
with a whistle, he changes his name, does he! That's
rather unlucky, too, for such an immaculate chap. It's
considered a little suspicious in Courts of Justice, I
believe, when an Innocent happens to have many
names.”
“What,” said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes
again, “what, young lady, in the name of Mercy, was
left the poor lad to do! The masters against him on one
hand, the men against him on the other, he only wantin
to work hard in peace, and do what he felt right. Can
a man have no soul of his own, no mind of his own?
Must he go wrong all through wi’ this side, or must he
go wrong all through wi' that, or else be hunted like a
hare?”
“Indeed, indeed, I pity him from my heart,” returned
Louisa; “and I hope that he will clear himself.”
“You need have no fear of that, young lady. He is
sure!"
“All the surer, I suppose,” said Mr. Bounderby, “ for
your refusing to tell where he is ? Eh ?”
“He shall not, through any act of mine, come back
wi' the unmerited reproach of being brought back. He
shall come back of his own accord to clear himself,
and put all those that have injured his good character,
and he not here for its defence, to shame. I have told
him what has been done against him,” said Rachael,

throwing off all distrust as a rock throws off the sea,
" and he will be here, at furthest, in two days."
“Notwithstanding which,” added Mr. Bounderby,
“if he can be laid hold of any sooner, he shall have an
earlier opportunity of clearing himself. As to you, I
have nothing against you; what you came and told me
turns out to be true, and I have given you the means of
proving it to be true, and there's an end of it. I wish
you good-night all! I must be off to look a little further
into this.”
Tom came out of his corner when Mr. Bounderby
moved, moved with him, kept close to him, and went
away with him. The only parting salutation of which
he delivered himself was a sulky "Good-night, father!"
With a brief speech, and a scowl at his sister, he left
the house.
Since his sheet-anchor had come home, Mr. Gradgrind
had been sparing of speech. He still sat silent, when
Louisa mildly said:
“Rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you
know me better.”
“It goes against me,” Rachael answered, in a gentler
manner, " to mistrust any one; but when I am so mis-
trusted—when we all are-I cannot keep such things
quite out of my mind. I ask your pardon for having
done you an injury. I don't think what I said now.
Yet I might come to think it again, wi’ the poor lad so
wronged.”
“Did you tell him in your letter,” inquired Sissy,
"that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because
he had been seen about the bank at night? He would
then know what he would have to explain on coming
back, and would be ready.”
“Yes, dear,” she returned; “but I can't guess what
can have ever taken him there. He never used to go
there. It was never in his way. His way was the
same as mine, and not near it.”
Sissy had already been at her side asking her where
she lived, and whether she might come to-morrow-night,
to inquire if there were news of him.
"I doubt,” said Rachael,“if he can be here till next day."
"Then I will come next night too,” said Sissy.
When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Grad-
grind lifted up his head, and said to his daughter:

236
“Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen
this man. Do you believe him to be implicated?”
“I think I have believed it, father, though with great
difficulty. I do not believe it now."
“ That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to be-
lieve it, from knowing him to be suspected. His ap-
pearance and manner; are they so honest?"
“ Very honest."
“And her confidence not to be shaken! I ask myself,”
said Mr. Gradgrind, musing, “ does the real culprit
know of these accusations? Where is he? Who is he?”
His hair had latterly began to change its color. As
he leaned upon his hand again, looking gray and old,
Louisa, with a face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over
to him, and sat close at his side. Her eyes by accident
met Sissy's at the moment. Sissy flushed and started,
and Louisa put her finger on her lip.
Next night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa
that Stephen was not come, she told it in a whisper.
Next night again, when she came home with the same
account, and added that he had not been heard of, she
spoke in the same low, frightened tone. From the mo-
ment of that interchange of looks, they never uttered
his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor ever pur-
sued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind
spoke of it.
The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights
ran out, and Stephen Blackpool was not come, and re-
mained unheard of. On the fourth day Rachael, with
unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to
have miscarried, went up to the Bank and showed her
letter from him with his address, at a working colony,
one of many, not upon the main road, sixty miles away.
Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town
looked for Stephen to be brought in next day.
During this whole time the whelp moved about with
Mr. Bounderby like his shadow, assisting in all the pro-
ceedings. He was greatly excited, horribly fevered, bit
his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard, rattling
voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up. At
the hour when the suspected man was looked for, the
whelp was at the station; offering to wager that he had
made off before the arrival of those who were sent in
quest of him; and that he would not appear,

The whelp wàs right. The messengers returned
alone. Rachael's letter had gone, Rachael's letter had
been delivered, Stephen Blackpool had decamped in
that same hour; and no soul knew more of him. The
only doubt in Coketown was, whether Rachael had
written in good faith, believing that he really would
come back, or warning him to fly. On this point opinion
was divided.
Six days, seven days, far on into another week. The
wretched whelp plucked up a ghastly courage, and
began to grow defiant. “Was the suspected fellow the
thief? A pretty question! If not, where was the man,
and why did he not come back?"
Where was the man, and why did he not come back?
In the dead of night the echoes of his own words, which
had rolled Heaven knows how far away in the daytime,
came back instead, and abided by him until morning.

Day and night again, day and night again. No Stephen
Blackpool. Where was the man, and why did he not
come back?
Every night, Sissy went to Rachael's lodging, and sat
with her in her small neat room. All day, Rachael
toiled as such people must toil, whatever their anxieties.
The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was lost or
found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy
mad elephants, like the Hard Fact men, abated nothing
of their set routine, whatever happened. Day and
night again, day and night again. The monotony was
unbroken. Even Stephen Blackpool's disappearance
was falling into the general way, and becoming as
monotonous a wonder as any piece of machinery in
Coketown,
“I misdoubt,” said Rachael, “if there is as many as
twenty left in all this place who have any trust in the
poor dear lad now.'
She said it to Sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted
only by the lamp at the street corner. Sissy had come

there when it was already dark, to await her return
from work; and they had since sat at the window where
Rachael had found her, wanting no brighter light to
shine on their sorrowful talk.
“If it hadn't been mercifully brought about, that I
was to have you to speak to," pursued Rachael, “ times
are, when I think my mind would not have kept right.
But I'get hope and strength through you; and you be-
lieve that though appearances may rise against him, he
will be proved clear?"
“I do believe so," returned Sissy, “ with my whole
heart. I feel so certain, Rachael, that the confidence
you hold in yours against all discouragement, is not like
to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him than if
I had known him through as many years of trial as you
have.”
“And I, my dear,” said Rachael, with a tremble in her
voice, “ have known him through them all to be, ac-
cording to his quiet ways, so faithful to everything
honest and good, that if he was never to be heard of
more, and I was to live to be a hundred years old, I could
say with my last breath, God knows my heart. I have
never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool!”
“We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he
will be freed from suspicion, sooner or later.“
“ The better I know it to be so believed there, my
dear,” said Rachael, “and the kinder I feel it that you
come away from there, purposely to comfort me, and
keep me company, and be seen wi' me when I am not
yet free from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I
am that I should ever have spoken those mistrusting
words to the young lady. And yet—".
“You don't mistrust her now, Rachael?”
“Now that you have brought us more together, no.
But I can't at all times keep out of my mind”
Her voice so sunk into a low and slow communing
with herself, that Sissy, sitting by her side, was obliged
to listen with attention.
“I can't at all times keep out of my mind mistrustings
of some one. I can't think who 'tis, I can't think how
or why it may be done, but I mistrust that some one has
put Stephen out of the way. I mistrust that by his
coming back of his own accord, and showing himself
innocent before them all, some one would be confounded,

who—to prevent that-has stopped him, and put him
out of the way."
“ That is a dreadful thought,” said Sissy, turning
pale.
“It is a dreadful thought to think he may be mur-
dered.”
Sissy shuddered, and turned paler yet.
“When it makes its way into my mind, dear,"
said Rachael, and it will come sometimes, though
I do all I can to keep it out, wi' counting on to high
numbers as I work, and saying over and over again
pieces that I knew when I were a child—I fall into such
a wild, hot hurry, that, however tired I am, I want to
walk fast, miles and miles. I must get the better of
this before bed-time. I'll walk home wi' you.”
.“ He might fall ill upon the journey back,” said Sissy,
faintly offering a worn-out scrap of hope; “and in such
a case, there are many places on the road where he
might stop.”
"But he is in none of them. He has been sought for
in all, and he's not there."
" True," was Sissy's reluctant admission.
“He'd walk the journey in two days. If he was foot-
sore and couldn't walk, I sent him, in the letter he got,
the money to ride, lest he should have none of his own
to spare."
“Let us hope that to-morrow will bring something
better, Rachael. Come into the air!”
Her gentle hand adjusted Rachael's shawl upon her
shining black hair in the usual manner of her wearing
it, and they went out. The night being fine, little knots
of Hands were here and there lingering at street-
corners; but it was supper-time with the greater part of
them, and there were but few people in the streets.
“ You're not so hurried now, Rachael, and your hand
is cooler.”
“I get better, dear, if I can only walk, and breathe a
little fresh. 'Times when I can't, I turn weak and con-
fused."
“But you must not begin to fail, Rachael, for you may
be wanted at any time to stand by Stephen. To-mor-
row is Saturday. If no news comes to-morrow, let us
walk in the country on Sunday morning, and strengthen
you for another week. Will you go?”

“Yes, dear.”
They were by this time in the street where Mr. Boun-
derby's house stood. The way to Sissy's destination
led them past the door, and they were going straight
towards it. Some train had newly arrived in Coketown,
which had put a number of vehicles in motion, and
scattered a considerable bustle about the town. Several
coaches were rattling before them and behind them as
they approached Mr. Bounderby's, and one of the latter
drew up with such briskness as they were in the act
of passing the house, that they looked round involun-
tarily. The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby's steps
showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an ecstacy
of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Spar-
sit seeing them at the same moment, called to them
to stop.
“It's a coincidence,” exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she
was released by the coachman. “It's a Providence!
Come out, ma'am!” then said Mrs. Sparsit, to some one
inside, “ come out, or we'll have you dragged out!”
Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman
descended. Whom Mrs. Sparsit incontinently collared.
“ Leave her alone, everybody!” cried Mrs. Sparsit,
with great energy. “Let nobody touch her. She be-
longs to me. Come in, ma'am!” then said Mrs. Sparsit,
reversing her former word of command. “Come in,
ma'am, or we'll have you dragged in!"
The spectacle of a matron of classical deportment,
seizing an ancient woman by the throat, and hauling
her into a dwelling-house, would have been, under any
circumstances, sufficient temptation to all true English
stragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into
that dwelling-house and see the matter out. But when
the phenomenon was enhanced by the notoriety and
mystery by this time associated all over the town, with
the Bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers
in, with an irresistible attraction, though the roof had
been expected to fall upon their heads. Accordingly,
the chance witnesses on the ground, consisting of the
busiest of the neighbours to the number of some five-
and-twenty, closed in after Sissy and Rachael, as they
closed in after Mrs. Sparsit and her prize; and the
whole body made a disorderly irruption into Mr. Boun-
derby's dining-room, where the people behind lost not a

moment's time in mounting on the chairs, to get the
better of the people in front.
“Fetch Mr. Bounderby down!” cried Mrs. Sparsit.
“Rachael, young woman, you know who this is?"
“It's Mrs. Pegler,” said Rachael.
“I should think it is!” cried Mrs. Sparsit, exulting.
"Fetch Mr. Bounderby. Stand away, everybody!”
Here old Mrs. Pegler, muffling herself up, and shrink-
ing from observation, whispered a word of entreaty.
“Don't tell me,” said Mrs. Sparsit, aloud, “I have told
you twenty times, coming along, that I will not leave
you till I have handed you over to him myself.”
Mr. Bounderby now appeared, accompanied by Mr.
Gradgrind and the whelp, with whom he had been hold-
ing conference up-stairs. Mr. Bounderby looked more
astonished than hospitable at sight of this uninvited
party in his dining-room.
"Why, what's the matter now!” said he. “Mrs. Spar-
sit, ma'am?”
“Sir,” explained that worthy woman, “I trust it is
my good fortune to produce a person you have much
desired to find. Stimulated by my wish to relieve your
mind, sir, and connecting together such imperfect clues
to the part of the country in which that person might
be supposed to reside, as have been afforded by the
young woman Rachael, fortunately now present to iden-
tify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring
that person with me--I need not say most unwillingly
on her part. It has not been, sir, without some trouble
that I have effected this; but trouble in your service is
to me a pleasure, and hunger, thirst and cold a real grat-
ification.”
Here Mrs. Sparsit ceased; for Mr. Bounderby's visage
exhibited an extraordinary combination of all possible
colours and expressions of discomfiture, as old Mrs.
Pegler was disclosed to his view.
“Why, what do you mean by this?" was his highly
unexpected demand, in great warmth. “I ask you what
do you mean by this, Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am?”
"Sir!" exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, faintly.
“Why don't you mind your own business, ma'am?"
roared Bounderby. “How dare you go and poke your
officious nose into my family affairs?")
This allusion to her favorite feature overpowered Mrs.

Sparsit. She sat down stiffly in a chair, as if she were
frozen; and, with a fixed stare at Mr. Bounderby, slowly
grated her mittens against one another, as if they were
frozen too.
“My dear Josiah!” cried Mrs. Pegler, trembling. “My
darling boy! I am not to blame. It's not my fault,
Josiah. I told this lady over and over again that I
knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you,
but she would do it.”
“What did you let her bring you for? Couldn't you
knock her cap off, or her tooth out, or scratch her, or do
something or other to her?” asked Bounderby.
“My own boy! She threatened me that if I resisted
her, I should be brought by constables, and it was better
to come quietly than make that stir in such a-” Mrs.
Pegler glanced timidly but proudly round the walls-
“such a fine house as this. Indeed, indeed, it is not my
fault! My dear, noble, stately boy! I have always lived
quiet and secret, Josiah, my dear. I have never broken
the condition once. I have never said I was your
mother. I have admired you at a distance; and if I
have come to town sometimes, with long times between,
to take a proud peep at you, I have done it unbeknown,
my love, and gone away again.”
Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets, walked
in impatient mortification up and down at the side of
the long dining-table, while the spectators greedily took
in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler's appeal, and at each
succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed.
Mr. Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs.
Pegler had done, Mr. Gradgrind addressed that maligned
old lady:
“I am surprised, madam,” he observed with severity,
" that in your old age you have the face to claim Mr.
Bounderby for your son, after your unnatural and in-
human treatment of him.”
“Me unnatural!” cried poor old Mrs. Pegler. “Me in-
human! To my dear boy?”
“Dear!" repeated Mr. Gradgrind. “Yes; dear in his
self-made prosperity, madam, I dare say. Not very
dear, however, when you deserted him in his infancy,
and left him to the brutality of a drunken grand-
mother.”
“I deserted my Josiah!” cried Mrs. Pegler, clasping

her hands. “Now, Lord forgive you, sir, for your
wicked imaginations, and for your scandal against the
memory of my poor mother, who died in my arms be-
fore Josiah was born. May you repent of it, sir, and live
to know better!"
She was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Grad-
grind, shocked by the possibility which dawned upon
him, said in a gentler tone:
“Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son
to—to be brought up in the gutter?”
“Josiah in the gutter!” exclaimed Mrs. Pegler. “No
such a thing, sir. Never! For shame on you! My
dear boy knows, and will give you to know, that though
he come of humble parents, he come of parents that
loved him as dear as the best could, and never thought
it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might
write and cypher beautiful, and I've his books at home to
show it! Aye, have I!” said Mrs. Pegler, with indignant
pride. “And my dear boy knows, and will give you to
know, sir, that after his beloved father died when he
was eight year old, his mother, too, could pinch a bit,
as it was her duty, and her pleasure, and her pride to do
it, to help him out in life, and put him 'prentice. And a
steady lad he was, and a kind master he had to lend
him a hand, and well he worked his own way forward
to be rich and thriving. And I'll give you to know, sir
-for this my dear boy won't—that though his mother
kept but a little village shop, he never forgot her, but
pensioned me on thirty pound a year-more than I want,
for I put by out of it-only making the condition that I
was to keep down in my own part, and make no boasts
about him, and not trouble him. And I never have, ex-
cept with looking at him once a year, when he has
never knowed it. And it's right,” said poor old Mrs.
Pelger, in affectionate championship, “that I should
· keep down in my own part, and I have no doubts that if
I was here I should do à many unbefitting things, and I
am well contented, and I can keep my pride in my Josiah
to myself, and I can love for love's own sake! And I am
ashamed of you, sir," said Mrs. Pelger lastly, “ for your
slanders and suspicions. And I never stood here before,
nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said
no. And I shouldn't be here now, if it hadn't been for
being brought here. And for shame on you, oh, for shame,

to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my
son standing here to tell you so different!"
The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs.
raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr,
Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very dis-
tressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had
never ceased walking up and down, and had every mo-
ment swelled larger and larger, and grown redder and
redder, stopped short.
“I don't exactly know," said Mr. Bounderby, “how I
come to be favoured with the attendance of the present
company, but I don't inquire. When they're quite sat-
isfied, perhaps they'll be so good as to disperse; whether
they're satisfied or not, perhaps they'll be so good as to
disperse. I'm not bound to deliver a lecture on my
family affairs, I have not undertaken to do it, and I'm
not a going to do it. Therefore, those who expect any
explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject
will be disappointed-particularly Tom Gradgrind, and
he can't know it too soon. In reference to the Bank
robbery, there has been a mistake made concerning my
mother. If there hadn't been over-officiousness it
wouldn't have been made, and I hate over-officiousness
at all times, whether or no. Good-evening!”.
Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms,
holding the door open for the company to depart, there
was a blustering sheepishness upon him, at once ex-
tremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd. Detected
as the Bully of humility, who had built his windy repu-
tation upon lies, and in his boastfulness had put the
honest truth as far away from him as if he had advanced
the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on
to a pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figúre. With the
people filing off at the door he held, who he knew would
carry what had passed to the whole town, to be given to
the four winds, he could not have looked a Bully more
shorn and forlorn if he had had his ears cropped. Even
that unlucky female, Mrs. Sparsit, fallen from her
pinnacle of exultation into the Slough of Despond, was
not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man and self-
made Humbug, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.
Rachael and Sissy, leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a
bed at her son's for that night, walked together to
the gate of Stone Lodge and then parted. Mr. Grad-

grind joined them before they had gone very far, and
spoke with much interest of Stephen Blackpool; for
whom he thought this signal failure of the suspicions
against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well.
As to the whelp; throughout this scene, as on all other
late occasions, he had stuck close to Bounderby. He
seemed to feel that as long as Bounderby could make no
discovery without his knowledge, he was so far safe.
He never visited his sister, and had only seen her once
since she went home: that is to say, on the night when
he still stuck close to Bounderby, as already related.
There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his
sister's mind, to which she never gave utterance, which
surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a
dreadful mystery. The same dark possibility had pre-
sented itself in the same shapeless guise, this very day,
to Sissy, when Rachael spoke of some one who would
be confounded by Stephen's return, having put him out
of the way. Louisa had never spoken of harbouring any
suspicion of her brother, in connection with the robbery,
she and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject,
save in that one interchange of looks when the un-
conscious father rested his gray head on his hand; but
it was understood between them, and they both knew
it. This other fear was so awful, that it hovered about
each of them like a ghostly shadow; neither daring to
think of its being near herself, far less of its being near
the other.
And still the forced spirit which the whelp had
plucked up, throve with him. If Stephen Blackpool
was not the thief, let him show himself. Why didn't he?
Another night. Another day and night. No Stephen
Blackpool. Where was the man, and why did he not
come back?

THE Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn, clear
and cool, when early in the morning Sissy and Rachael
met, to walk in the country.
As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but
on the neighborhood's too_after the manner of those
pious persons who do penance for their own sins by
putting other persons into sackcloth-it was customary
for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of
pure air, which is not absolutely the most wicked
among the vanities of life, to get a few miles away
by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their
lounge in the fields. Sissy and Rachael helped them-
selves out of the smoke by the usual means, and were
put down at a station about midway between the town
and Mr. Bounderby's retreat.
Though the landscape was blotted here and there with
heaps of coal, it was green elsewhere, and there were
trees to see, and there were larks singing (though it was
Sunday), and there were pleasant scents in the air, and
all were overarched by a bright blue sky. In the dis-
tance one way, Coketown showed as a black mist; in
another distance, hills began to rise; in a third, there
was a faint change in the light of the horizon, where it
shone upon the far-off sea. Under their feet, the grass
was fresh; beautiful shadows of branches flickered
upon it, and speckled it; hedgerows were luxuriant;
everything was at peace. Engines at pits' mouths, and
lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily
labour into the ground, were alike quiet; wheels had
ceased for a short space to turn; and the great wheel of
earth seemed to revolve without the shocks and noises
of another time.
They walked on across the fields and down the shady
lanes, sometimes getting over a fragment of a fence so
rotten that it dropped at a touch of the foot, sometimes
passing near a wreck of bricks and beams overgrown
with grass, marking the sight of deserted works. They

followed paths and tracks, however slight. Mounds
where the grass was rank and high, and where bram-
bles, dock-weed, and such-like vegetation, were con-
fusedly heaped together, they always avoided; for
dismal stories were told in that country of the old pits
hidden beneath such indications.
The sun was high when they sat down to rest. They
had seen no one, near or distant, for a long time; and
the solitude remained unbroken. “It is so still here,
Rachael, and the way is so untrodden, that I think we
must be the first who have been here all the summer.”
As Sissy said it, her eyes were attracted by another of
those rotten fragments of fence upon the ground. She
got up to look at it. “And yet I don't know. This
has not been broken very long. The wood is quite
fresh where it gave way. Here are footsteps too. Oh,
Rachael!”
She ran back and caught her round the neck. Rachael
had already started up.
“What is the matter?”
“I don't know. There is a hat lying in the grass."
They went forward together. Rachael took it up,
shaking from head to foot. She broke into a passion of
tears and lamentations: Stephen Blackpool was written
in his own hand on the inside.
“Oh, the poor lad, the poor lad! He has been made
away with. He is lying murdered here!"
“Is there-has the hat any blood upon it?" Sissy
faltered.
They were afraid to look; but they did examine it,
and found no mark of violence, inside or out. It had
been lying there some days, for rain and dew had stained
it, and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it
had fallen. They looked fearfully about them, without
moving, but could see nothing more. “Rachael," Sissy
whispered, “I will go on a little by myself."
She had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of
stepping forward, when Rachael caught her in both
arms with a scream that resounded over the wide land-
scape. Before them, at their very feet, was the brink
of a black, ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass.
They sprang back, and fell upon their knees, each hid-
ing her face upon the other's neck.
“Oh, my good Lord! He's down there! Down there!”

At first this, and her terrific screams, were all that could
be got from Rachael, by any tears, by any prayers, by
any representations, by any means. It was impossible
to hush her, and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or
she would have flung herself down the shaft.
“Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of
Heaven, not these dreadful cries! Think of Stephen,
think of Stephen, think of Stephen!"
By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out
in all the agony of such a moment, Sissy at last brought
her to be silent, and to look at her with a tearless face of
stone.
“Rachael, Stephen may be living. You wouldn't
leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful
place, a moment, if you could bring help to him!”
“No, no, no!"
“Don't stir from here, for his sake! Let me go and
listen.”
She shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept
towards it on her hands and knees, and called to him as
loud as she could call. She listened, but no sound re-
plied. She called again and listened; still no answering
sound. She did this, twenty, thirty times. She took
a little clod of earth from the broken ground where
he had stumbled, and threw it in. She could not hear
it fall.
The wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a
few minutes ago, almost carried despair to her brave
heart, as she rose up and looked all around her, seeing
no help. "Rachael, we must lose not a moment. We
must go in different directions, seeking aid. You shall
go by the way we have come, and I will go forward by
the path. Tell any one you see, and every one what has
happened. Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!"
She knew by Rachael's face that she might trust her
now. And after standing for a moment to see her run-
ning, wringing her hands as she ran, she turned and
went upon her own search; she stopped at the hedge to
tie her shawl there as a guide to the place, then, threw
her bonnet aside, and ran as she had never run before.
Run, Sissy, run, in Heaven's name! Don't stop for
breath. Run, run! Quickening herself by carrying such
entreaties in her thoughts, she ran from field to field,
and lane to lane, and place to place, as she had never

longer
, she contin these and housest
run before; until she came to a shed by an engine-house,
where two men lay in the shade, asleep on straw.
First to wake them, and next to tell them, all so wild
and breathless as she was, what had brought her there,
were difficulties; but they no sooner understood her than
their spirits were on fire like hers. One of the men was
in a drunken slumber, but on his comrade's shouting to
him that a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft, he
started out to a pool of dirty water, put his head in it,
and came back sober.
With these two men she ran to another half a mile
further, and with that one to another, while they ran
elsewhere. Then a horse was found; and she got
another man to ride for life or death to the railroad, and
send a message to Louisa, which she wrote and gave
him. By this time a whole village was up; and wind-
lasses, poles, candles, lanterns, all things necessary,
were fast collecting and being brought into one place,
to be carried to the Old Hell Shaft.
It seemed now hours and hours since she had left the
lost man lying in the grave where he had been buried
alive. She could not bear to remain away from it any
longer-it was like deserting him-and she hurried
swiftly back, accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers, in-
cluding the drunken man whom the news had sobered,
and who was the best man of all. When they came to
the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as she had
left it. The men called and listened as she had done,
and examined the edge of the chasm, and settled how
it had happened, and then sat down to wait until the
implements they wanted should come up.
Every sound of insects in the air, every stirring of
the leaves, every whisper among these men, made Sissy
tremble, for she thought it was a cry at the bottom of
the pit. But the wind blew idly over it, and no sound
arose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, wait-
ing and waiting. After they had waited some time,
straggling people who had heard of the accident
began to come up; then the real help of implements
began to arrive. In the midst of this, Rachael returned;
and with her party there was a surgeon, who brought
some wine and medicines. But the expectation among
the people that the man would be found alive was very
slight indeed.

to go andad been for this presie
There being now people enough present to impede the
work, the sobered man put himself at the head of the
rest, or was put there by the general consent, and made
a large ring round the Old Hell Shaft, and appointed
men to keep it. Besides such volunteers as were
accepted to work, only Sissy and Rachael were at first
permitted within this ring; but, later in the day, when
the message brought an express from Coketown, Mr.
Gradgrind and Louisa, and Mr. Bounderby, and the
whelp, were also there.
The sun was four hours lower than when Sissy and
Rachael had first sat down upon the grass, before a
means of enabling two men to descend securely was
rigged with poles and ropes. Difficulties had arisen in
the construction of this machine, simple as it was; re-
quisites had been found wanting, and messages had had
to go and return. It was five o'clock in the afternoon
of the bright autumnal Sunday before a candle was
sent down to try the air, while three or four rough faces
stood crowded close together, attentively watching it;
the men at the windlass lowering as they were told.
The candle was brought up again, feebly burning, and
then some water was cast in. Then the bucket was
hooked on; and the sobered man and another got in
with lights, giving the word “Lower away!”
As the rope went out, tight and strained, and the
windlass creaked, there was not a breath among the one
or two hundred men and women looking on, that came
as it was wont to come. The signal was given and the
windlass stopped, with abundant rope to spare. Ap-
parently so long an interval ensued with the men at the
windlass standing idle, that some women shrieked that
another accident had happened! But the surgeon who
held the watch declared five minutes not to have elapsed
yet, and sternly admonished them to keep silence. He
had not well done speaking, when the windlass was
reversed and worked again. Practised eyes knew
that it did not go as heavily as it would if both work-
men had been coming up, and that only one was
returning.
The rope came in tight and strained; and ring after
ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass, and all
eyes were fastened on the pit. The sobered man was
brought up and leaped out briskly on the grass. There

was an universal cry of “Alive or dead?” and then a
deep, profound hush.
When he said “Alive!” a great shout arose and many
eyes had tears in them.
“But he's hurt very bad,” he added, as soon as he
could make himself heard again. “Where's doctor?
He's hurt so very bad, sir, that we dunno how to get him
up.”
They all consulted together, and looked anxiously at
the surgeon, as he asked some questions, and shook his
head on receiving the replies. The sun was setting now;
and the red light in the evening sky touched every face
there, and caused it to be distinctly seen in all its wrapt
suspense.
The consultation ended in the men returning to the
windlass, and the pitman going down again, carrying
the wine and some other small matters with him. Then the
other man came up. In the meantime, under the sur-
geon's directions, some men brought a hurdle, on which
others made a thick bed of spare clothes covered with
loose straw, while he himself contrived some bandages
and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs. As these
were made, they were hung upon an arm of the pitman
who had last come up, with instructions how to use
them: and as he stood, shown by the light he car-
ried, leaning his powerful loose hand upon one of the
poles, and sometimes glancing down the pit, and some-
times glancing round upon the people, he was not the
least conspicuous figure in the scene. It was dark now
and torches were kindled.
It appeared from the little this man said to those
about him, which was quickly repeated all over the cir-
cle, that the lost man had fallen upon a mass of crumbled
rubbish with which the pit was half choked up, and that
his fall had been further broken by some jagged earth
at the side. He lay upon his back with one arm doubled
under him, and according to his own belief had hardly
stirred since he fell, except that he had moved his free
hand to a side pocket, in which he remembered to have
some bread and meat (of which he had swallowed
crumbs), and had likewise scooped up a little water in it
now and then. He had come straight away from his
work, on being written to, and had walked the whole
journey; and was on his way to Mr. Bounderby's coun-
r him, e he fell, excepWhich he rene had swaler in it

try-house after dark, when he fell. He was crossing
that dangerous country at such a dangerous time, be-
cause he was innocent of what was laid to his charge,
and couldn't rest from coming the nearest way to de-
liver himself up. The Old Hell Shaft, the pitman said,
with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the
last; for though Stephen could speak now, he believed it
would soon be found to have mangled the life out of him.
When all was ready, this man, still taking his last
hurried .charges from his comrades and the surgeon
after the windlass had begun to lower him, disappeared
into the pit. The rope went out as before, the signal
was made as before, and the windlass stopped. No
man removed his hand from it now, Every one waited
with his grasp set and his body bent down to the work,
ready to reverse and wind in. At length the signal
was given, and the ring leaned forward.
For, now, the rope came in, tightened and strained to
its utmost as it appeared, and the men turned heavily,
and the windlass complained. It was scarcely endur-
able to look at the rope, and think of its giving way.
But, ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the
windlass safely, and the connecting chains appeared,
and finally the bucket with the two men holding on at
the sides—a sight to make the head swim, and oppress
the heart—and tenderly supporting between them,
slung and tied within, the figure of a poor, crushed,
human creature.
A low murmur of pity went round the throng, and
the women wept aloud, as this form, almost without
form, was moved very slowly from its iron deliverance,
and laid upon the bed of straw. At first, none but the
surgeon went close to it. He did what he could in its
adjustment on the couch, but the best that he could do
was to cover it. That gently done, he called to him
Rachael and Sissy. And at that time the pale, worn,
patient face was seen looking up at the sky, with the
broken right hand lying bare on the outside of the
covering garments, as if waiting to be taken by another
hand.
They gave him drink, moistened his face with water,
and administered some drops of cordial and wine.
Though he lay quite motionless looking up at the sky,
he smiled and said, “Rachael."

She stooped down on the grass at his side, and bent
over him until her eyes were between his and the sky,
for he could not so much as turn them to look at her.
“Rachael, my dear.”
She took his hand. He smiled again and said, “Don't
let't go.”
“Thou 'rt in great pain, my own dear Stephen?”
“I ha' been, but not now. I ha' been-dreadful, and
dree, and long, my dear-but'tis ower now. Ah, Rachael,
aw a muddle! Fro’ first to last a muddle!” .
The spectre of his old look seemed to pass as he said
the word.
“I ha' fell into th’ pit, my dear, as have cost wi’in the
knowledge o' old fok now livin, hundreds an hundreds
o'men's lives--fathers, sons, brothers, dear to thousands
an thousands, an keepin 'em fro’ want an hunger. I
ha' fell into a pit that ha' been wi'th' Fire-damp crueller
than battle. I ha' read on 't in the public petition, as
onny one may read, fro’ the men that works in pits, in
which they ha' pray'n an pray’n the lawmakers for
Christ's sake not to let their work be murder to 'em, but
to spare 'em for th' wives an children that they loves
as well as gentlefok loves theirs. When it were in work,
it killed wi’out need; when 'tis let alone, it kills wi'out
need. See how we die an no need, one way an another
-in a muddle-every day!”
He faintly said it, without any anger against any one.
Merely as the truth.
“Thy little sister, Rachael, thou hast not forgot her.
Thou 'rt not like to forget her now, and me so nigh her.
Thou know'st-poor, patient, suff'rin, dear-how thou
didst work for her, seet'n all day long in her little chair
at thy winder, and how she died, young and misshapen,
awlung o'sickly air as had'n no need to be, an awlung
o' working people's miserable homes. A muddle! Aw
a muddle!"
Louisa approached him; but he could not see her,
lying with his face turned up to the night sky.
“If aw th’things that tooches us, my dear, was not
so muddled, I should'n ha' had’n need to coom heer. If

took'n offence wi' me. He would'n ha' suspect'n me.
But look up yonder, Rachael! Look aboove!"
Following his eyes, she saw that he was gazing at a
star.
“It ha' shined upon me,” he said reverently, “in my
pain and trouble down below. It ha' shined into my
mind. I ha' look'n at’t an thowt o' thee, Rachael, till
the muddle in my mind have cleared awa, above a bit,
I hope. If soom ha' been wantin’in unnerstan'in me
better, I, too, ha' been wantin' in unnerstan'in them
better. When I got thy letter I easily believen that
what the yoong ledy sen an done to me, an what her
brother sen and done to me, was one, and that there
were a wicked plot betwixt 'em. When I fell I were in
anger wi' her, an hurryin on t' be as onjust t'her as
oothers was t' me. But in our judgments, like as in
our doins, we mun bear and forbear. In my pain an

aw th' world may on'y coom toogether mɔre, an get a
better unnerstan'in o' one another, than when I were in't
my own weak seln.”
Louisa hearing what he said, bent over him on the
opposite side to Rachel, so that he could see her.
*You ha' heard?” he said after a few moments’ silence.
“I ha' not forgot you, ledy."
“Yes, Stephen, I have heard you. And your prayer
is mine."
“You ha' a father. Will yo tak' a message to him?"
“He is here," said Louisa, with dread. “Shall I bring
him to you?”
“If yo please.”
Louisa returned with her father. Standing hand-in-
hand, they both looked down upon the solemn counte-
nance.
“Sir, yo will clear me an mak my name good wi' aw
men. This I leave to yo.”
Mr. Gradgrind was troubled and asked how?
“Sir,” was the reply: “yor son will tell yo how. Ask
him. I mak no charges: I leave none ahint me: not a
single word. I ha’seen an spok’n wi’ yor son, one night.
I ask no more o'yo than that yo clear me-an I trust to

the surgeon being anxious for his removal, those who
had torches or lanterns prepared to go in front of the
litter. Before it was raised, and while they were arrang-
ing how to go, he said to Rachael, looking upward at
the star:
“Often as I coom to myseln, an found it shinin on
me down there in my trouble, I thowt it were the star as
guided to our Saviour's home. I awmust think it be the
very star!”
They lifted him up, and he was overjoyed to find that
they were about to take him in the direction whither the
star seemed to him to lead.'
“Rachael, beloved lass! Don't let go my hand. We
may walk toogether t'night, my dear!"
"I will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee, Stephen,
all the way.”
“Bless thee! Will somebody be pleased to coover my
face!”
They carried him very gently along the fields, and
down the lanes, and over the wide landscape; Rachael
always holding the hand in hers. Very few whispers
broke the mournful silence. It was soon a funeral pro-
cession. The star had shown him where to find the God
of the poor; and through humility, and sorrow, and for-
giveness, he had gone to his Redeemer's rest.
CHAPTER VII.
WHELP-HUNTING.
BEFORE the ring formed round the Old Hell Shaft was
broken, one figure had disappeared from within it. Mr.
Bounderby and his shadow had not stood near Louisa,
who held her father's arm, but in a retired place by
themselves. When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to
the couch, Sissy, attentive to all that happened, slipped
behind that wicked shadow—a sight in the horror of his
face, if there had been eyes there for any sight but one
-and whispered in his ear. Without turning his head,
he conferred with her a few moments, and vanished.
Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the
people moved.

in thely wang hise, he se,
When the father reached home, he sent a message to
Mr. Bounderby's, desiring his son to come to him
directly. The reply was, that Mr. Bounderby having
missed him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him
since, had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge.
“I believe, father,” said Louisa, “he will not come
back to town to-night.” Mr. Gradgrind turned away,
and said no more.
In the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as
soon as it was opened, and seeing his son's place empty
(he had not the courage to look in at first), went back
along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way
there. To whom he said that, for reasons he would
soon explain, but entreated not then to be asked for, he
had found it necessary to employ his son at a distance
for a little while. Also, that he was charged with the
duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool's memory, and
declaring the thief. Mr. Bounderby, quite confounded,
stood stock-still in the street after his father-in-law had
left him, swelling like an immense soap-bubble, without
its beauty.
Mr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room,
and kept it all that day. When Sissy and Louisa tapped
at his door, he said, without opening it, “Not now, my
dears; in the evening.” On their return in the evening,
he said, “I am not able yet-to-morrow.” He ate noth-
ing all day, and had no candle after dark; and they
heard him walking to and fro late at night..
But, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the
usual hour, and took his usual place at the table. Aged
and bent he looked, and quite bowed down; and yet he
looked a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days
when in this life he wanted nothing but Facts. Before
he left the room, he appointed a time for them to come
to him; and so, with his gray head drooping, went away.
“Dear father,” said Louisa, when they kept their
appointment, “you have three young children left.
They will be different, I will be different yet, with
Heaven's help.”
She gave her hand to Sissy, as if she meant with her
help too.
"Your wretched brother!" said Mr. Gradgrind. “Do
you think he had planned this robbery, when he went
with you to the lodging?"

to be up early, kicking a horse in a fly; and so were
smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the
pigs lived, which, although not a magnificent or even
savoury approach, was, as is usual in such cases, the
legitimate highway.
The first thing they saw on entering the town was the
skeleton of Sleary's Circus. The company had departed
for another town more than twenty miles off, and had
opened there last night. The connexion between the
two places was by a hilly turnpike road, and the travel-
ling on that road was very slow. Though they took but
a hasty breakfast, and no rest (which it would have been
vain to seek under such anxious circumstances), it was
noon before they began to find the bills of Sleary's Horse-
riding on barns and walls, and one o'clock when they
stopped in the market-place.
A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, com-
mencing at that very hour, was in course of announce-
ment by the bellman as they set their feet upon the stones
of the street. Sissy recommended that, to avoid making
inquiries and attracting attention in the town, they
should present themselves to pay at the door. If Mr.
Sleary were taking the money, he would be sure to know
her, and would proceed with discretion. If he were not
he would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what
he had done with the fugitive, would proceed with dis-
cretion still.
Therefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the
well-remembered booth. The flag with the inscription,
Sleary's Horse-riding, was there; and the Gothic niche
was there; but Mr. Sleary was not there. Master Kid-
derminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received by
the wildest credulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to
the invincible force of circumstances (and hïs beard),
and, in the capacity of a man who made himself gener-
ally useful, presided on this occasion over the exchequer
-having also a drum in reserve, on which to expend
his leisure moments and superfluous forces. In the ex-
treme sharpness of his look-out for base coin, Mr. Kid-
derminster, as at present situated, never saw anything
but money; so Sissy passed him unrecognised, and they
went in.

basins at once, as it is the favourite recreation of that
monarch to do. Sissy, though well acquainted with his
Royal line, had no personal knowledge of the present
Emperor, and his reign was peaceful. Miss Josephine
Sleary, in her celebrated graceful Equestrian Tyrolean
Flower-Act, was then announced by a new clown (who
humourously said Cauliflower Act), and Mr. Sleary ap-
peared, leading her in.
Mr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with
his long whip-lash, and the Clown had only said, “If
you do it again I'll throw the horse at you!" when Sissy
was recognised both by father and daughter. But they
got through the Act with great self-possession; and
Mr. Sleary, saving for the first instant, conveyed no
more expression into his locomotive eye than into his
fixed one. The performance seemed a little long to Sissy
and Louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the
Clown an opportunity of telling Mr. Sleary (who said,
“Indeed, sir,” to all his observations in the calmest way,
and with his eye on the house), about two legs sitting
on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four
legs, and laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs,
caught hold of three legs, and threw 'em at four legs,
who ran away with one leg. For, although an ingenious
Allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged stool, a
dog, and a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time;
and they were in great suspense. At last, however,
little fair-haired Josephine made her curtsey amid great
applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had just
warmed himself and said, “Now I'll have a turn!” when
Sissy was touched on the shoulder, and beckoned out.
She took Louisa with her; and they were received by
Mr. Sleary in a very little private apartment, with can-
vas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden ceiling all aslant,
on which the box company stamped their approbation,
as if they were coming through.' “ Thethilia,” said Mr.
Sleary, who had brandy and water at hand, “ it doth me

ried a thecond time-married a Cheethemonger ath fell
in love with her from the front—and he'th a Overtheer
and makin' a fortun.”
These various changes, Mr. Sleary, very short of breath
now, related with great heartiness, and with a wonder-
ful kind of innocence, considering what a bleary and
brandy-and-watery old veteran he was. Afterwards he
brought in Josephine, and E. W. B. Childers (rather
deeply-lined in the jaws by daylight), and The Little
Wonder of Scholastic Equitation, and, in a word, all the
company. Amazing creatures they were in Louisa's
eyes, so white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress,
and so demonstrative of leg; but it was very agreeable
to see them crowding about Sissy, and very natural in
Sissy to be unable to refrain from tears.
“There! Now Thethilia hath kithd all the children,
and hugged all the women, and thaken handth all round
with all the men, clear, every one of you, and ring in
the band for the thecond part!”
As soon as they were gone, he continued in a low tone.
“Now, Thethilia, I don't athk to know any thecreth, but

well?"
“My father will be here soon,” said Louisa, anxious
to bring him to the point. “Is my brother safe?”
“Thafe and thound!” he replied “I want you jutht
to take a peep at the Ring, mith, through here. The-
thilia, you know the dodgeth; find a thpy-hole for your-
thelf.
They each looked through a chink in the boards.
“ That'h Jack the Giant Killer-piethe of comic infant
bithnith,” said Sleary. “There'th a property-houthe,
you thee, for Jack to hide in; there'th my Clown with a
thauthepan-lid and a thpit, for Jack'th thervant; there'th
little Jack himthelf in a thplendid thoot of armour;

and the Giant (a very ecthpenthive bathket one), he an't

“Yes,” they both said.
“ Look at 'em again,” said Sleary, “look at 'em well.
You thee 'em all? Very good. Now, mith;" he put a
form for them to sit on; “I have my opinionth, and the
Thquire your father hath hith. I don't want to know
what your brother ith been up to; ith better for me not
to know. All I thay ith, the Thquire hath thtood by
Thethilia, and I'll thtand by the Thquire. Your brother
ith one o' them black thervanth."
Louisa uttered an exclamation, partly of distress,
partly of satisfaction.
“Ith a fact,” said Sleary, “and even knowin' it, you
couldn't put your finger on him. Let the Thquire come.
I thall keep your brother here after the performanth. I
thant undreth him, nor yet wath hith paint off. Let
the Thquire come here after the performanth, or come
here yourthelf after the performanth, and you thall find
your brother, and have the whole plathe to talk to him
in. Never mind the lookth of him, ath long ath he ith
well hid.”
Louisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load,
detained Mr. Sleary no longer then. She left her love
for her brother, with her eyes full of tears; and she and
Sissy went away until later in the afternoon.

HARD TIMES.
Mr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.
He too had encountered no one whom he knew; and was
now sanguine, with Sleary's assistance, of getting his
disgraced son to Liverpool in the night. As neither of
the three could be his companion without almost identi-
fying him under any disguise, he prepared a letter to a
correspondent whom he could trust, beseeching him to
ship the bearer off at any cost, to North or South
America, or any distant part of the world to which he
could be the most speedily and privately despatched.
This done, they walked about, waiting for the Circus
to be quite vacated; not only by the audience, but by
the company and by the horses. After watching it a
long time, they saw Mr. Sleary bring out a chair and
sit down by the side-door smoking; as if that were his
signal that they might approach.
“Your thervant, Thquire,” was his cautious saluta-
tion, as they passed in. “If you want me you'll find
me here. You mustn't mind your thon having a comic
livery on."
They all three went in; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down
forlorn on the Clown's performing chair in the middle
of the ring. On one of the back benches, remote in the
subdued light and the strangeness of the place, sat the
villainous whelp, sulky to the last, whom he had the
misery to call his son.
In a preposterous coat, like a beadle's, with cuffs and
flaps exaggerated to an unspeakable extent; in an im-
mense waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled shoes, and a
mad cocked hat; with nothing fitting him, and every-
thing of coarse material, moth-eaten, and full of holes;
with seams in his black face, where fear and heat had
started through the greasy composition daubed all over
it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously shame-
ful as the whelp in his comic livery, Mr. Gradgrind
never could by any other means have believed in, weigh-
able and measurable fact though it was. And one of his
model children had come to this!
At first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but per-
sisted in remaining up there by himself. Yielding at
length, if any concession so sullenly made can be called
yielding, to the entreaties of Sissy-for Louisa he dis-
owned altogether—he came down, bench by bench, until
he stood in the sawdust, on the verge of the circle, as

far as possible within its limits, from where his father
sat.
“How was this done?” asked the father.
“How was what done?” moodily answered the son.
“ This robbery,” said the father, raising his voice upon
the word.
“I forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up
ajar before I went away. I had had the key that was
found made long before. I dropped it that morning,
that it might be supposed to have been used. I didn't
take the money all at once. I pretended to put my
balance away every night, but I didn't. Now you know
all about it."
“If a thunderbolt had fallen on me," said the father,
“it would have shocked me less than this!"
“I don't see why,” grumbled the son. “So many
people are employed in situations of trust; so many
people, out of so many, will be dishonest. I have heard
you talk, a hundred times, of its being a law. How can
I help laws? You have comforted others with such
things, father. Comfort yourself!"
The father buried his face in his hands, and the son
stood in his disgraceful grotesqueness, biting straw; his
hands, with the black partly worn away inside, looking
like the hands of a monkey. The evening was fast
closing in; and from time to time, he turned the whites
of his eyes restlessly and impatiently towards his
father. They were the only parts of his face that
showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was
so thick.
“You must be got to Liverpool, and sent abroad.”
“I suppose I must. I can't be more miserable any-
where,” whimpered the whelp, “than I have been here,
ever since I can remember. That's one thing.”
Mr. Gradgrind went to the door, and returned with
Sleary, to whom he submitted the question, How to get
this deplorable object away?
“Why, I've been thinking of it, Thquire. There'th
not muth time to lothe, tho you muth thay yeth or no.
Ith over twenty mileth to the rail. Thereth a coath in
half an hour, that goeth to the rail, 'purpothe to cath the
mail train. That train will take him right to Liverpool.”
“But look at him," groaned Mr. Gradgrind. “Will

“I don't mean that he thould go in the comic livery,"
said Sleary. “ Thay the word, and I'll make a Jothkin
of him, out of the wardrobe, in five minutes."
“I don't understand,” said Mr. Gradgrind.
“A Jothkin-a Carter. Make up your mind quick,
Thquire. There'll be beer to feth. I've never met with
nothing but beer ath'll even clean a comic blacka-
moor.”
“Mr. Gradgrind rapidly assented; Mr. Sleary rapidly
turned out from a box, a smock frock, a felt hat, and
other essentials, the whelp rapidly changed clothes be-
hind a screen of baize, Mr. Sleary rapidly brought beer,
and washed him white again.
“Now," said Sleary, “ come along to the coath, and
jump up behind; I'll go with you there, and they'll
thuppothe you one of my people. Thay farewell to
your family, and tharp 'th the word.” With which he
delicately retired.
“ Here is your letter,” said Mr. Gradgrind. “ All
necessary means will be provided for you. Atone, by
repentance and better conduct, for the shocking action
you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to
which it has led. Give me your hand, my poor boy, and
may God forgive you as I do!”
The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these
words and their pathetic tone. But, when Louisa opened
her arms, he repulsed her afresh.
“Not you. I don't want to have anything to say to
you!"
“Oh, Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!"
“After all your love!” he returned, obdurately. "Pretty
love! Leaving old Bounderby to himself, and packing
my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and going home just
when I was in the greatest danger. Pretty love that!
Coming out with every word about our having gone to
that place, when you saw the net was gathering round
me. Pretty love that! You have regularly given me
up. You never cared for me.”
“Tharp 'th word!” said Sleary, at the door..
They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him
that she forgave him, and loved him still, and that he
would one day be sorry to have left her so, and glad to
think of these, her last words, far away: when some
one ran against them. Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who

were both before him while his sister yet clung to his
shoulder, stopped and recoiled.
For, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips
parted, his thin nostrils distended, his white eyelashes
quivering, his colourless face more colourless than ever,
as if he ran himself into a white heat, when other
people ran themselves into a glow. There he stood.
panting and heaving, as if he had never stopped since
the night, now long ago, when he had ran them down
before.
“I'm sorry to interfere with your plans,” said Bitzer,
shaking his head, “but I can't allow myself to be done
by horse-riders. I must have young Mr. Tom; he mustn't
be got away by horse-riders; here he is in a smock frock,
and I must have him!”
By the collar, too, it seemed. For so he took posses-
sion of him.
CHAPTER II.
PHILOSOPHICAL.
THEY went back into the booth, Sleary shutting the
door to keep intruders out. Bitzer, still holding the par-
alysed culprit by the collar, stood in the Ring, blinking
at his old patron through the darkness of the twilight.
“Bitzer,” said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and mis-
erably submissive to him, “have you a heart?"
• The circulation, sir,” returned Bitzer, smiling at the
oddity of the question, “couldn't be carried on without
one. No man, sir, acquainted with the facts established
by Harvey relating to the circulation of the blood, can
doubt that I have a heart.”
“Is it accessible,” cried Mr. Gradgrind, “to any com-
passionate influence?”
“It is accessible to Reason, sir,” returned the excellent
young man. “And to nothing else.”
They stood looking at each other; Mr. Gradgrind's
face as white as the pursuer's.
“What motive-even what motive in reason-can you
have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth,”
said Mr. Gradgrind, “and crushing his miserable father?
See his sister here. Pity us.”

HARD TIMES.
“Sir," returned Bitzer, in a very business-like and
logical manner, “since you ask me what motive I have
in reason, for taking young Mr. Tom back to Coketown,
it is only reasonable to let you know. I have suspected
young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first. I
had had my eye upon him before that time, for I knew
his ways. I have kept my observations to myself, but I
have made them; and I have got ample proofs against
him now, besides his running away, and besides his
own confession, which I was just in time to overhear.
I had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday
morning, and following you here. I am going to take
young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver
him over to Mr. Bounderby. Sir, I have no doubt what-
ever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to
young Mr. Tom's situation. And I wish to have his
situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me
good.”
“If this is solely a question of self-interest with you—"
Mr. Gradgrind began.
“I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir," returned
Bitzer; “but I am sure you know that the whole social
system is a question of self-interest. What you must
always appeal to, is a person's self-interest. It's your
only hold. We are so constituted. I was brought up in
that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are
aware.”
“What sum of money,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “will
you set against your expected promotion?”
“Thank you, sir,"returned Bitzer, “for hinting at the
proposal; but I will not set any sum against it. Know-
ing that your clear head would propose that alternative,
I have gone over the calculations in my mind; and I
find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms
indeed, would not be as safe and good for me as my im-
proved prospects in the Bank.”
“Bitzer,” said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his
hands as though he would have said, See how miserable
I am! “Bitzer, I have but one chance left to soften you.
You were many years at my school. If, in remembrance
of the pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade
yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest
and release my son, I entreat and pray you give him the
benefit of that remembrance."

“I really wonder, sir," rejoined the old pupil in an
argumentative manner, “to find you taking a position
so untenable. My schooling was paid for; it was a bar-
gain; and when I came away, the bargain ended."
It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind
philosophy, that everything was to be paid for. Nobody
was ever on any account to give anybody anything, or
render anybody help without purchase. Gratitude was
to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were
not to be. Every inch of the existence of mankind, from
birth to death, was to be a bargain across the counter.
And if we didn't get to heaven that way, it was not
a politico-economical place, and we had no business
there.
“I don't deny,” added Bitzer, “ that my schooling was
cheap. But that comes right, sir. I was made in the
cheapest market, and have to dispose of myself in the
dearest.”
He was a little troubled here, by Louisa and Sissy
crying.
* Pray don't do that,” said he, “it's of no use doing
that: it only worries. You seem to think that I have
some animosity against young Mr. Tom; whereas I have
none at all. I am only going, on the reasonable grounds
I have mentioned, to take him back to Coketown. If
he was to resist, I should set up the cry of Stop Thief !
But he won't resist, you may depend upon it.”
Mr. Sleary, who, with his mouth open and his rolling
eye as immovably jammed in his head as his fixed one,
had listened to these doctrines with profound attention,
here stepped forward.
“ Thquire, you know perfectly well, and your daughter
knowth perfectly well (better than you, becauthe I thed
it to her), that I didn't know what your thon had done,
and that I didn't want to know-I thed it was better
not, though I only thought, then, it wath thome thky-
larking. However, thith young man having made it
known to be the robbery of a bank, why, that’th a
theriouth thing; muth too theriouth a thing for me to
compound, ath thith young man hath very properly
called it. Conthequently, Thquire, you muth’nt quarrel
with me if I take thith young man’th thide, thay he 'th
right and there 'th no help for it. But I tell you what

man over to the rail, and prevent expothure here. I
can't conthent to do more, but I'll do that.”
Fresh lamentations from Louisa, and deeper affliction
on Mr. Gradgrind's part, followed this desertion of them
by their last friend. But, Sissy glanced at him with
great attention; nor did she in her own breast misunder-
stand him. As they were all going out again, he
favoured her with one slight roll of his movable eye,
desiring her to linger behind. As he locked the door,
he said excitedly:
“ The Thquire thtood by you, Thethilia, and I'll
thtand by the Thquire, More than that: thith ith a
prethiouth rathcal, and belongth to that bluthtering
Cove that my people nearly pitht out o'winder. It'li
be a dark night; I've got a horthe that'll do anything
but thpeak; I've got a pony that'll go fifteen mile an
hour with Childerth driving of him; I've got a dog that'll
keep a man to one plathe four-and-twenty hourth. Get
a word with the young Thquire. Tell him, when he
theeth our horthe begin to danthe, not to be afraid of
being thpilt, but to look out for a pony-gig coming up.
Tell him, when he theeth that gig clothe by, to jump
down, and it'll take him off at a rattling pathe. If my
dog leth thith young man thtir a peg on foot, I give him
leave to go. And if my horthe ever thtirth from the
thpot where he beginth a danthing, till the morning-
I don't know him?-Tharp'th the word!”
The word was so sharp, that in ten minutes Mr.
Childers, sauntering about the market-place in a pair
of slippers, had his cue, and Mr. Sleary's equipage was
ready. It was a fine sight to behold the learned dog
barking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with
his one practicable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his
particular attentions. Soon after dark they all three
got in and started; the learned dog (a formidable
creature) already pinning Bitzer with his eye, and stick-
ing close to the wheel on his side, that he might be
ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest
disposition to alight.
The other three sat up at the inn all night in great
suspense. At eight o'clock in the morning Mr. Sleary
and the dog re-appeared: both in high spirits.
“ All right, Thquire!” said Mr. Sleary “your thon
may be aboard-a-thip by thith time. Childerth took

at half-patht thixth thith morning.”
Mr. Gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks, of
course; and hinted as delicately as he could at a hand-
some remuneration in money.
“I don't want money myself, Thquire; but Childerth
ith a family man, and if you wath to like to offer him a
five-pound note, it mightn't be unactheptable. Like-
withe if you wath to thtand a collar for the dog, or a thet
of bellth for the horthe, I thould be very glad to take
'em. Brandy and water I alwayth take.” He had al-
ready called for a glass, and now called for another.
“If you wouldn't think it going too far, Thquire, to
make a little thpread for the company at about
three and thixth ahead, not reckoning Luth, it would
make 'em happy.”
All these little tokens of his gratitude Mr. Gradgrind
very willingly undertook to render. Though he thought
them far too slight, he said, for such a service.
“Very well, Thquire; then, if you'll only give a
Horthe-riding a bethpeak, whenever you can, you'll more
than balanthe the account. Now, Thquire, if your
daughter will ethcuthe me, I should like one parting
word with you.”
Louisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room;
Mr. Sleary, stirring and drinking his brandy and water
as he stood, went on:
“Thquire, you don't need to be told that dogth ith
wonderful animalth.”
“Their instinct,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “is surprising."
“ Whatever you call it—and I'm bleth if I know what
to call it”-said Sleary, “it ith athtonithing. The way
in with a dog'll find you—the dithtanthe he'll come!”
“His scent,” said Mr. Gradgrind, “ being so fine."

Thquire, in a way that made me think whether that dog
hadn't gone to another dog, and thed, “You don't hap-

mightn't have thed, - Well, I can't thay I know him my-

have thought it over, and thed, “Thleary, Thleary! Oh,

In conthequenth of my being afore the public, and going
about tho muth, you thee, there mutht be a number of
dogth acquainted with me, Thquire, that I don't know!"
Mr. Gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this
speculation.
“Any way,” said Sleary, after putting his lips to his
brandy and water, “ith fourteen month ago, Thquire,
thinthe we wath at Chethter. We wath getting up our
Children in the Wood one morning, when there cometh
into our Ring, by the thtage door, a dog. He had

wath lame, and pretty well blind. He went round to

“Sissy's father's dog!”
“ Thethilia'th father'th old dog. Now, Thquire, I can
take my oath, from my knowledge of that dog, that that
man wath dead—and buried—afore that dog come back
to me. Joth'phine and Childerth and me talked it over
a long time, whether I thould write or not. But we
agreed, ‘No. There'th nothing comfortable to tell; why

he broke hith own heart alone, rather than pull her
down along with him; never will be known, now,
Thquire, till—no, not till we know how the dogth findth

“She keeps the bottle that he sent her for, to this hour:
and she will believe in his affection to the last moment
of her life,” said Mr. Gradgrind.

“It theemth to prethent two thingth to a perthon,
don't it, Thquire?” said Mr. Sleary, musing as he looked
down into the depths of his brandy and water: “one,
that there ith a love in the world, not at all Thelf-in-

that it hath a way of ith own of calculating or not cal-
culating, whith thomehow or another ith at leatht ath

Mr. Gradgrind looked out of window, and made no
reply. Mr. Sleary emptied his glass and recalled the
ladies.
“Thethilia, my dear, kith me and good-bye! Mith

CHAPTER IX.
FINAL.
It is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere
of a vain blusterer, before the vain blusterer sees it him-
self. Mr. Bounderby felt that Mrs. Sparsit had auda-
ciously anticipated him, and presumed to be wiser than
he. Inappeasably indignant with her for her triumph-
ant discovery of Mrs. Pegler, he turned this presumption,
on the part of a woman in her dependent position, over
and over in his mind, until it accumulated with turning
like a great snowball. At last he made the discovery
that to discharge this highly connected female-to have
it in his power to say, “She was a woman of family, and

wanted to stick to me, but I wouldn't have it, and got
rid of her”-would be to get the utmost possible amount
of crowning glory out of the connection, and at the
same time to punish Mrs. Sparsit according to her de-
serts.
Filled fuller than ever, with this great idea, Mr. Boun-
derby came in to lunch, and sat himself down in the
dining-room of former days, where his portrait was.
Mrs. Sparsit sat by the fire, with her foot in her cotton
stirrup, little thinking whither she was posting.
Since the Pegler affair, this gentlewoman had covered
her pity for Mr. Bounderby with a veil of quiet melan-
choly and contrition. In virtue thereof, it had become
her habit to assume a woful look; which woful look she
now bestowed upon her patron.
“What's the matter now, ma'am?” said Mr. Boun-
derby, in a very short, rough way.
“Pray, sir," returned Mrs. Sparsit, “ do not bite my
nose off."
“Bite your nose off, ma'am!" repeated Mr. Bounderby.
“ Your nose!” meaning, as Mrs. Sparsit conceived, that
it was too developed a nose for the purpose. After which
offensive implication, he cut himself a crust of bread,
and threw the knife down with a noise.
Mrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup, and said,
“Mr. Bounderby, sir!"
" Well, ma’am?” retorted Mr. Bounderby. “What
are you staring at?"
“May I ask, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit, “have you been
ruffled this morning?"
“Yes, ma'am.”
“May I inquire, sir,” pursued the injured woman,
“ whether I am the unfortunate cause of your having
lost your temper?”
“Now, I'll tell you what, ma'am,” said Bounderby, “I
am not come here to be bullied. A female may be highly
connected, but she can't be permitted to bother and
badger a man in my position, and I am not going to put
up with it.” (Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on;
foreseeing that if he allowed of details, he would be
beaten.)
Mrs. Sparsit first elevated, then knitted, her Corio-
lanian eyebrows; gathered up her work into its proper
basket, and rose.

“Sir,” said she majestically. “It is apparent to me
that I am in your way at present. I will retire to my
own apartment.”
“ Allow me to open the door, ma'am.”
“ Thank you, sir; I can do it for myself."
“You had better allow me, ma'am,” said Bounderby,
passing her, and getting his hand upon the lock; “be-
cause I can take the opportunity of saying a word to
you, before you go. Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am, I rather think
you are cramped here, do you know? It appears to me
that, under my humble roof, there's hardly opening
enough, for a lady of your genius, in other people's af-
fairs."
Mrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and
said, with great politeness, “ Really, sir?”
“I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late
affairs have happened, ma'am,” said Bounderby; " and
it appears to my poor judgment--"
"Oh! Pray, sir," Mrs. Sparsit interposed, with
sprightly cheerfulness, “don't disparage your judgment.
Everybody knows how unerring Mr. Bounderby's judg-
ment is. Everybody has had proofs of it. It must be
the theme of general conversation. Disparage anything
in yourself but your judgment, sir,” said Mrs. Sparsit,
laughing.
Mr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed:
“ It appears to me, ma'am, I say, that a different sort
of establishment altogether would bring out a lady of
your powers. Such an establishment as your relation,
Lady Scadgers's, now. Don't you think you might find
some affairs there, ma'am, to interfere with?”
“It never occurred to me before, sir,” returned Mrs.
Sparsit; “but now you mention it, I should think it
highly probable.”
* Then suppose you try, ma'am,” said Bounderby, lay-
ing an envelope with a cheque in it in her little basket.
“You can take your own time for going, ma'am; but
perhaps, in the meanwhile, it will be more agreeable to
a lady of your powers of mind to eat her meals by her-
self, and not to be intruded upon. I really ought to
apologise to you-being only Josiah Bounderby of Coke-
town-for having stood in your light so long."
“Pray, don't name it, sir,” returned Mrs. Sparsit.
“If that portrait could speak, sir-but it has the advan-

tage over the original of not possessing the power of
committing itself and disgusting others — it would
testify that a long period has elapsed since I first habitu-
ally addressed it as the picture of a Noodle. Nothing
that a Noodle does can awaken surprise or indignation;
the proceedings of a Noodle can only inspire contempt.”
Thus saying, Mrs. Sparsit, with her Roman features
like a medal struck to commemorate her scorn of Mr.
Bounderby, surveyed him fixedly from head to foot,
swept disdainfullv past him and ascended the staircase.
Mr. Bounderby closed the door, and stood before the fire;
projecting himself after his old explosive manner into
his portrait-and into futurity.
Into how much of futurity? He saw Mrs. Sparsit fight-
ing out a daily fight, at the points of all the weapons in
the female armoury, with the grudging, smarting,
peevish, tormenting Lady Scadgers, stili laid up in bed
with her mysterious leg, and gobbling her insufficient
income down by about the middle of every quarter, in a
mean little airless lodging, a mere closet for one, a mere
crib for two; but did he see more? Did he catch any
glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers,
as the rising young man, so devoted to his master's
great merits, who had won young Tom's place, and had
almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when
by various rascals he was spirited away? Did he see
any faint reflection of his own image making a vain-
glorious will, whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs, past
five-and-fifty years of age, each taking upon himself
the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for-
ever dine in Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Boun-
derby Buildings, forever attend a Bounderby chapel,
forever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for-
ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for-
ever nauseate all healthy stomachs with a vast amount
of Bounderby balderdash and bluster. Had he any
prescience of the day five years to come, when Josiah
Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coke-
town street, and this same precious will was to begin
its long career of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile
example, little service and much law? Probably not.
Yet the portrait was to see it all out.
Here was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day, and in the
same hour, sitting thoughtful in his own room. How

much of futurity did he see? Did he see himself, a white-
haired, decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible
theories to appointed circumstances; making his facts
and figures subservient to Faith, Hope, and Charity; and
no longer trying to grind that heavenly trio in his dusty
little mills? Did he catch sight of himself, therefore
much despised by his late political associates? Did he
see them, in the era of its being quite settled that the
national dustmen have only to do with one another, and
owe no duty to an abstraction called a People, “taunt-
ing the honourable gentleman” with this and with that
and with what not, five nights a week, until the small
hours of the morning? Probably he had that much fore-
knowledge, knowing his men.
Here was Louisa on the night of the same day, watch-
ing the fire, as in days of yore, though with a gentler
and a humbler face. How much of the future might
arise before her vision? Broadsides in the streets, signed
with her father's name, exonerating the late Stephen
Blackpool, weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and pub-
lishing the guilt of his own son, with such extenuation
as his years and temptation (he could not bring himself
to add, his education) might beseech, were of the Present.
So, Stephen Blackpool's tombstone, with her father's
record of his death, was almost of the Present, for she
knew it was to be. These things she could plainly see.
But, how much of the Future?
A working woman, christened Rachael, after a long
illness, once again appearing at the ringing of the Fac-
tory bell, and passing to and fro at the set hours, among
the Coketown Hands; a woman of a pensive beauty,
always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene,
and even cheerful; who, of all the people in the place,
alone appeared to have compassion on a degraded,
drunken wretch of her own sex, who was sometimes
seen in the town secretly begging of her, and crying to
her; a woman working, ever working, but content to do
it, and preferring to do it as her natural lot, until she
should be too old to labor any more? Did Louisa see
this? Such a thing was to be.
A lonely brother, many thousands of miles away,
writing, on paper blotted with tears, that her words had
too soon come true, and that all the treasures in the
world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her dear

face? At length this brother coming nearer home, with
hope of seeing her, and being delayed by illness; and
then a letter, in a strange hand, saying "he died in a
hospital, of fever, such a day, and died in penitence and
love of you: his last word being your name?" Did Louisa
see these things? Such things were to be.
Herself again a wife-a mother-lovingly watchful of
her children, ever careful that they should have a child-
hood of the mind no less than a childhood of the body,
as knowing it to be even a more beautiful thing, and a
possession, any hoarded scrap of which is a blessing
and happiness to the wisest? Did Louisa see this? Such
a thing was never to be.
But happy Sissy's happy children loving her; all children
loving her; she grown learned in childish lore; think-
ing no innocent and pretty fancy ever to be despised; try-
ing hard to know her humbler fellow-creatures, and to
beautify their lives of machinery and reality with those
imaginative graces and delights, without which the heart
of infancy will wither up, the sturdiest physical man-
hood will be morally stark death, and the plainest na-
tional prosperity figures can show, will be the Writing
on the Wall-she holding this course as part of no fan-
tastic vow, or bond, or brotherhood, or sisterhood, or
pledge, or covenant, or fancy dress, or fancy fair; but
simply as a duty to be done—did Louisa see these things
of herself? These things were to be.
Dear reader! It rests with you and me, whether, in
our two fields of action, similar things shall be or not.
Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the
hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn gray and cold,
THE END.
