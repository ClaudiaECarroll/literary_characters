A RENT IN A CLOUD.
CHAPTER I.
THE WHITE HORSE AT COBLENTZ.
UT of a window of the Weissen Ross, at Cotu
lentz, looking upon the rapid Rhine, over
whose circling eddics a rich sunset shed a gold.
en tint, two young Englishmen lounged and smoked their
cigars ; rarely speaking, and, to all seeming, wearing that
air of boredom which, strangely enough, would appear
peculiar to a very enjoyable time of life. They were ac-
quaintances of only a few days. They had met on an
Antwerp steamer-rejoined each other in a picture-gallery
-chanced to be side by side at a table d'hôte at Brussels,
and, at last, drifted into one of those intimacies which,
to very young men, represents friendship. They agreed
they would travel together, all the more readily tha:
neither cared very much in what direction. “As for
me,” said Calvert, “it doesn't much signify where I pass
the interval ; but, in October, I must return to India and
join my regiment.”
“And I," said Loyd, “about the same time must be
in England. I have just been called to the bar."

“Slow work that must be, I take it.”.
*Do you like soldiering ?” asked Loyd, in a low quier
voice.
“Hate it! abhor it! It's all very well when you join
first. You are so glad to be free of Woolwich or
Sandhurst, or wherever it is. You are eager to be treated
like a man, and so full of Cox and Greenwood, and the
army tailor, and your camp furniture, and then comes the
dépôt and the mess. One's first three months at mess
seemed to be the cream of existence.”
"Is it really so jolly? Are the fellows good talkers ?”
“ About the worst in the universe; but to a young
hand, they are enchantment. All their discourse is of
something to be enjoyed. It is that foot-race, that game
of billiards, that match at cricket, that stunning fine girl
to ride out with, those excellent cigars Watkins is sending
us; and so on. All is action, and very pleasant action
too. Then duty, though it's the habit to revile and curse
it, duty is associated with a sense of manhood ; a sort of
goosestep chivalry to be sure, but still chivalry. One
likes to see the sergeant with his orderly book, and to
read, “Ensign Calvert for the main guard.'”
“And how long does all this last ?”.
“I gave it three months, some have been able to
prolong it to six. Much depends upon where the dépôt
is, and what sort of corps you're in.”
“Now for the reaction ! Tell me of that.”
"I cannot; it's too dreadful. It's a general detestation
of all things military, from the Horse Guards to the mess
waiter. You hate drill-parade-inspection-the adjutant
-the wine committee--the paymaster—the field-officer
of the day—and the major's wife. You are chafed about
everything—you want leave, you want to exchange, you
want to be with the dépôt, you want to go to Corfu, and

you are sent to Canada. Your brother officers are the
slowest fellows in the service; you are quizzed about thein
at the mess of the Nine Hundred and Ninth—“Yours"
neither give balls nor private theatricals. You wish you
were in the Cape Coast Fencibles—in fact, you feel that
destiny has placed you in the exact position you are
least fitted for."
“So far as I can see, however, all the faults are in
yourself.”
“Not altogether. If you have plenty of money, your
soldier life is simply a barrier to the enjoyment of it. You
are chained to one spot, to one set of associates, and to
one mode of existence. If you're poor, it's fifty times
worse, and all your time is spent in making five-and-
sixpence a day equal to a guinea.”
Loyd made no answer, but smoked on.
“I know," resumed the other, “that this is not what
many will tell you, or what, perhaps, would suggest itself
to your own mind from a chance intercourse with us. To
the civilian the mess is not without a certain attraction,
and there is, I own, something very taking in the aspect
of that little democracy where the fair-cheeked boy is on
an equality with the old bronzed soldier, and the fresn-
ness of Rugby or Eton is confronted with the stern ex-
periences of the veteran campaigner; but this wears off
very soon, and it is a day to be marked with white chalk
when one can escape his mess dinner, with all its good
cookery, good wine, and good attendance, and eat a
mutton-chop at the Green Man with Simpkins, just be-
cause Simpkins wears a black coat, lives down in the
country, and never was in a Gazette in his life. And now
for your side of the medal—what is it like?”
“Nothing very gorgeous or brilliant, I assure you,"
said Loyd, gently; for he spoke with a low quiet tone,

and had a student-like submissive manner, in strong code
trast to the other's easy and assured air. “With great
abilities, great industry, and great connexion, the career
is a splendid one, and the rewards the highest. But
between such golden fortunes and mine there is a whole
realm of space. However, with time and hard work,
and ordinary luck, I don't despair of securing a fair live-
lihood."
“After-say—thirty years, eh?”
“ Perhaps so."
“ By the time that I drop out of the army a retired
lieutenant-colonel, with three hundred a year, you'll be in
fair practice at Westminster, with, let us take it, fifteen
hundred, or two thousand-perhaps five.”
“I shall be quite satisfied if I confirm the prediction
in the middle of it."
“Ah,” continued the soldier. “There's only one road
to success—to marry a charming girl with money. Ashley
of ours, who has done the thing himself, says that you can
get money-any man can, if he will ; that, in fact, if you
will only take a little trouble you may have all the attrac-
tions you seek for in a wiſe, plus fortune."
“Pleasant theory, but still not unlikely to involve a
self-deception, since, even without knowing it, a man
may be far more interested by the pecuniary circum-
stance."
- “Don't begin with it; first fail in love—I mean to
yourself, without betraying it—and then look after the
settlement. If it be beneath your expectation, trip your
anchor, and get out of the reach of fire."
“And you may pass your best years in that unprofit-
able fashion, not to say what you may find yourself be-
come in the meanwhile."
· The soldier looked at the other askance, and there was

in his sidelong glance a sort of irony that seemed to say,
“Oh! you're an enthusiast, are you?”
• There you have me, Loyd,” said he, hurriedly: “that
is the weak point of my whole system; but remember,
after all, do what one will, he can't be as fresh at five-and-
thirty as five-and-twenty-he will have added ten years of
distrusts, doubts, and dodges to his nature in spite of
himself.”
"If they must come in spite of himself, there is no help
for it; but let him at least not deliberately lay a plan to
acquire them."
“One thing is quite clear," said the other, boldly :
“the change will come, whether we like it or not, and the
wisest philosophy is to plan our lives so that we may con-
form to the alterations time will make in us. I don't
want to be dissatisfied with my condition at five-and-
forty, just for the sake of some caprice that I indulged in
at five-and-twenty, and if I find a very charming creature
with an angelic temper, deep blue eyes, the prettiest foot
in Christendom, and a neat sum in Consols, I'll promise
you there will soon be a step in the promotion of her
Majesty's service, vice Lieutenant Harry Calvert, sold
out.”
The reply of the other was lost in the hoarse noise of
the steam which now rushed from the escape-pipe of a
vessel that had just arrived beneath the window. She
was bound for Mayence, but stopped to permit some few
passengers to land at that place. The scene exhibited
all that bustle and confusion so perplexing to the actors,
but so amusing to those who are mere spectators; for
while some were eagerly pressing forward to gain the
gangway with their luggage, the massive machinery of the
bridge of boats was already in motion to open a space for
the vessel to move up the stream. The young English-

men were both interested in watching a very tall, thin
old lady, whose efforts to gather together the members of
her party, her luggage, and her followers, seemed to have
overcome all the ordinary canons of politeness, for she
pushed here and drove there, totally regardless of the
inconvenience she was occasioning. She was followed
by two young ladies, from whose courteous gestures it
could be inferred how deeply their companion's insistance
pained them, and how ashamed they felt at their position.
“I am afraid she is English,” said Loyd.
“Can there be a doubt of it? Where did you ever see
that reckless indifference to all others, that selfish disre-
gard of decency, save in a certain class of our people ?
Look, she nearly pushed that fat man down, the hatch-
way; and see, she will not show the steward her tickets,
and she will have her change. Poor girls ! what misery
and exposure all this is for you!"
“But the steamer is beginning to move on. They will
be carried off! See, they are hauling at the gangway
already."
“She's on it; she doesn't care; she's over now. Well
done, old lady! That back-hander was neatly given; and
see, she has marshalled her forces cleverly: sent the
light division in front, and brings up the rear herself with
the luggage and the maids. Now, I call that as clever a
landing on an enemy's shore as ever was done."
“I must say I pity the girls, and they look as if they
felt all the mortification of their position. And yet,
they'll come to the same sort of thing themselves one of
these days, as naturally as one of us will to wearing very
easy boots and loose-fitting waistcoats.”.
As he said this, the new arrivals had passed up from
he landing-place, and entered the hotel.
“Let us at least be merciful in our criticisms on for.

eigners, while we exhibit to their eyes such national speri.
mens as these !” said Calvert. “For my own part, I
believe, that from no one source have we as a people
derived so much of sneer and shame, as from that which
includes within it what is called the unprotected female.”
“What if we were to find out that they were Belgians,
or Dutch, or Americans? or better still, what if they
should chance to be remarkably good sort of English? I
conclude we shall meet them at supper."
“Yes, and there goes the bell for that gathering, which
on the present occasion will be a thin one. They're all
gone off to that fair at Lahnech.” And so saying, Calvert
drew nigh a glass, and made one of those extempore
toilets which young men with smart moustaches are
accustomed to perform before presenting themselves to
strangers. Loyd merely took his hat and walked tu
the door.
“There ! that ought to be enough, surely, for all rea-
sonable captivation !” said he, laughingly.
“Perhaps you are right; besides, I suspect in the
present case it is a mere waste of ammunition ;” and,
with a self-approving smile, he nodded to his image in the
giass, and followed his friend.
One line at this place will serve to record that Calvert
was very good looking ; blue-eyed, blond-whiskered,
Saxon-looking withal; erect carriage and stately air,
which are always taken as favourable types of our
English blood. Perhaps a certain over-consciousness of
these personal advantages, perhaps a certain conviction
of the success that had attended these gifts, gave him
what, in slang phrase, is called a "tigerish" air : but it
was plain to see that he had acquired his ease of manner
in good company, and that his pretension was rather the
stamp of a class than of an individual.

Loyd was a pale, delicate-looking youth, with dark eyes
zet in the deepest of orbits, that imparted sadness to
fcatures in themselves sufficiently grave. He seemed
what he was, an overworked student, a man who had
sacrificed health to toil, and was only aware of the bad
bargain when he felt unequal to continue the contest.
His doctors had sent him abroad for rest, for that “dis-
traction” which as often sustain its English as its
French acceptance, and is only a source of worry and
anxiety where rest and peace are required. His means
were of the smallest—he was the only son of a country
vicar, who was sorely pinched to afford him a very
narrow support—and who had to raise by a loan the
hundred pounds that were to give him this last chance
of regaining strength and vigour. If travel therefore had
its pleasures, it had also its pains for him. He felt, and
very bitterly, the heavy load that his present enjoy-
ment was laying upon those he loved best in the world,
and this it was that, at his happiest moments, threw a
gloom over an already moody and depressed tempera-
ment.
The sad thought of those at home, whose privations
were the price of his pleasures, tracked him at every
step; and pictures of that humble fireside where sat
his father and his mother, rose before him as he gazed
at the noble cathedral, or stood amazed before the
greatest triumphs of art. This sensitive feeling, preying
upon one naturally susceptible, certainly tended little to
his recovery, and even at times so overbore every
other sentiment, that he regretted he had ever come
abroad. Scarcely a day passed that he did not liesitate
whether he should not turn his steps homeward 10 En-
giand.

CHAPTER II.
THE PASSENGERS ON THE STEAMBOAT.
HE table d'hôte room was empty as the two
Englishmen entered it at supper-time, and they
S took their places, moodily enough, at one end
of a table laid for nigh thirty guests. “All gone to Lah-
nech, Franz?” asked Calvert of the waiter.
“Yes, Sir, but they'll be sorry for it, for there's thunder
in the air, and we are sure to have a deluge before
nightfall.”
“And the new arrivals, are they gone too ?”
“No, Sir. They are up stairs. The old lady would
seem to have forgotten a box, or a desk, on board the
steamer, and she has been in such a state about it that she
couldn't think of supping; and the young ones appear to
sympathise in her anxieties, for they, too, said, 'Oh, we
can't think of eating just now.'”
“But of course, she needn't fuss herself. It will be
detained at Mayence, and given up to her when she de-
mands it.”
A very expressive shrug of the shoulders was the anly
answer Franz made, and Calvert added, “You don't
quite agree with me, perhaps ?”.
." It is an almost daily event, the loss of luggage on
those Rhine steamers; so much so, that one is tempted
to believe that stealing luggage is a regular livelihood
here."

A Rent in a Cloui.
Just at this moment the Englishwoman in question
entered the room, and in French of a very home
manufacture asked the waiter how she could manage,
by means of the telegraph, to reclaim her missing
property.
A most involved and intricate game of cross purposes
ensued; for the waiter's knowledge of French was scarcely
more extensive, and embarrassed, besides, by some speci-
alities in accent, so that though she questioned and he
replied, the discussion gave little hope of an intelligible
solution.
“May I venture to offer my services, Madam?” said
Calvert, rising and bowing politely. “If I can be of the
least use on this occasion- ”.
“None whatever, Sir. I am perfectly competent to
express my own wishes, and have no need of an inter-
preter ;” and then turning to the waiter, added : “ Mon-
trez moi le telegraph, garçon.”
The semi-tragic air in which she spoke, not to add the
strange accent of her very peculiar French, was almost
too much for Calvert's gravity, while Loyd, half pained by
the ridicule thus attached to a countrywoman, held down
his head and never uttered a word. Meanwhile the old
lady had retired with a haughty toss of her towering bon-
net, followed by Frarız.
“ The old party is fierce,” said Calvert, as he began his
supper, “and would not have me at any price.”
“I suspect that this mistrust of each other is very com-
mon with us English: not so much from any doubt of
our integrity, as from a fear lest we should not be equal
in social rank.”
“Well; but really, don't you think that our externals
might have satisfied that old lady she had nothing to ap-
prehend on that score?”


## p. 11 (#19) ##############################################

The Passengers on the Steamboat.
11
“I can't say how she may have regarded that point,"
was the cautious answer.
Calvert pushed his glass impatiently from him, and
said, petulantly, “The woman is evidently a governess,
or a companion, or a housekeeper. She writes her name
in the book Miss Grainger, and the others are called
Walter. Now, after all, a Miss Grainger might, without
derogating too far, condescend to know a Fusilier, eh?
Oh, here she comes again.”
The lady thus criticised had now re-entered the room,
and was busily engaged in studying the announcement
of steamboat departures and arrivals, over the chimney.
" It is too absurd,” said she, pettishly, in French, “to
close the telegraph-office at eight, that the clerks may go
to a ball."
“Not to a ball, Madam, to the fair at Lahnech," inter-
posed Franz.
"I don't care, Sir, whether it be a dance or a junket-
ing. It is the same inconvenience to the public ; and the
landlord, and the secretary, as you call him, of this hotel,
are all gone, and nothing left here but you."
Whether it was the shameless effrontery of the contempt
she evinced in these words, or the lamentable look of
abasement of the waiter, that overcame Calvert, certain
is it he made no effort to restrain himself, but, leaning
back in his chair, laughed heartily and openly.
“Well, Sir,” said she, turning fiercely on him, "you
force me to say, that I never witnessed a more gross dis-
play of ill-breeding and bad manners.”
“Had you only added, Madam, after a very long ex-
perience of life,' the remark would have been perfect,"
said he, still laughing.
“Oh, Calvert !” broke in Loyd, in a tone of depreca-
tion; but the old lady, white with passion, retired without

waiting for that apology which, certainly, there was little
prospect of her receiving.
"I am sorry you should have said that,” said Loyd,
“ for though she was scarcely measured in her remark,
quur laughter was a gross provocation.”
"How the cant of your profession sticks to you !” said
the other. “There was the lawyer in every word of that
speech. There was the case' and the set off.'”
Loyd could not help smiling, though scarcely pleased
ar this rejoinú er.
“Take my word for it,” said Calvert, as he helped him-
self to the dish before him,' “ there is nothing in life so
aggressive as one of our elderly countrywomen when trav-
elling in an independent condition. The theory is attack
-attack-attack! They have a sort of vague impression
that the passive are always imposed on, and certainly
they rarely place themselves in that category. As I live,
here she comes once more."
The old lady had now entered the room with a slip of
paper in her hand, to which she called the waiter's atten:
tion, saying, “You will despatch this message to May-
ence, when the office opens in the morning. See that
there is no mistake about it.”
“It must be in German, Madam," said Franz.
“They'll not take it in in any foreign language.”
“Tell her you'll translate it, Loyd. Go in, man, and
get your knock-down as I did," whispered Calvert.
Loyd blushed slightly; but not heeding the sarcasm of
his companion, he arose, and, approaching the stranger,
said, “It will give me much pleasure to put your
message into German, Madam, if it will at all conven-
ience you."
It was not till after a very searching look into his face,
and an apparently satisfactory examination of his features,

The Passengers on the Steamboat. 13
that she replied, “Well, Sir, I make no objection; there
can be no great secrecy in what passes through a
telegraph-office. You can do it, if you please."
Now, though the speech was not a very gracious ac-
knowledgment of a proffered service, Loyd took the paper
and proceeded to read it. It was not without an effort,
however, that he could constrain himself so far as not to
laugh aloud at the contents, which began by an explana-
tion that the present inconvenience was entirely owing
to the very shameful arrangements made by the steam
packet company for the landing of passengers at inter-
mediate stations, and through which the complainant,
travelling with her nieces, Millicent and Florence Walter,
and her maids, Susannah Tucker and Mary Briggs, and
having for luggage the following articles--
“May I observe, Madam,” said Loyd, in a mild tone
of remonstrance," that these explanations are too lengthy
for the telegraph, not to say very costly, and as your ob-
ject is simply to reclaim a missing article of your bag-
gage- "
“I trust, Sir, that having fully satisfied your curiosity
as to who we are, and of what grievance we complain,
that you will spare me your comments as to the mode
in which we prefer our demand for redress; but I ought
to have known better, and I deserve it!” and, snatch-
ing the paper rudely from his hand, she dashed out of
the room in passion.
“By Jove ! you fared worse than myself,” said Calvert,
as he laughed loud and long. “You got a heavier casti-
gation for your polite interference than I did for my im-
pertinence."
“ It is a lesson, at all events," said Loyd, still blushing
for his late defeat. “I wonder is she all right up here,”
and he touched his forehead significantly.

“Of course she is. Nay, more, I'll wager a Nap. that
in her own set, amidst the peculiar horrors who form her
daily intimates, she is a strong-minded sensible woman,
that won't stand humbug,' and so on. These are speci-
alities; they wear thick shoes, woollen petticoats, and
brown veils, quarrel with cabmen, and live at Clapham.”
“But why do they come abroad?”
“Ah ! that is the question that would puzzle nineteen
out of every twenty of us. With a panorama in Leicester-
square, and a guide-book in a chimney-corner, we should
know more of the Tyrol than we'll ever acquire junket-
ing along in a hired coach, and only eager not to pay too
much for one's ‘Kalbsbraten' or 'Schweinfleisch,' and
yet here we come in shoals,—to grumble and complain of
all our self-imposed miseries, and incessantly lament the
comforts of the land that we won't live in."
“Some of us come for health,” said Loyd, sorrow-
fully.
“And was there ever such a blunder? Why the very
vicissitudes of a continental climate are more trying than
any severity in our own. Imagine the room we are now
sitting in, of a winter's evening, with a stove heated to
ninety-five, and the door opening every five minutes to a
draught of air eleven degrees below zero! You pass out
of this furnace to your bed-room, by a stair and corridor
like the Arctic regions, to gain an uncarpeted room, with
something like a knife-tray for a bed, and a poultice of
feathers for a coverlet!”
“And for all that we like it, we long for it; save, pinch,
screw, and sacrifice Heaven knows what of home enjoy-
ment just for six weeks or two months of it.”
“Shall I tell you why? Just because Simpkins has
done it. Simpkins has been up the Rhine and dined at
the Cursaal at Ems, and made his little début at roulette

at Wiesbaden, and spoken his atrocious French at Frank-
fort, and we won't consent to be less men of the world
than Simpkins; and though Simpkins knows that it
doesn't pay,' and I know that it doesn't pay, we won't
'peach' either of us, just for the pleasure of seeing you,
and a score like you, fall into the same blunder, exper-
ience the same disasters, and incur the same disappoint-
ments as ourselves."
“No. I don't agree with you; or, rather, I won't
agree with you. I am determined to enjoy this holiday
of mine to the utmost my health will let me, and you
shall not poison the pleasure by that false philosophy
which, affecting to be deep, is only depreciatory.”
“And the honourable gentleman resumed his seat, as
the newspapers say, amidst loud and vociferous cheers,
which lasted for several minutes." This Calvert said as
he drummed a noisy applause upon the table, and made
Loyd's face glow with a blush of deep shame and con-
fusion.
“I told you, the second day we travelled together, and
I tell you again now, Calvert,” said he, falteringly,
" that we are nowise suited to each other, and never
could make good travelling companions. You know
far more of life than I either do or wish to know.
You see things with an acute and piercing clearness
which I cannot attain to. You have no mind for the
sort of humble things which give pleasure to a man
simple as myself; and, lastly, I don't like to say it,
but I must, your means are so much more ample than
mine, that to associate with you I must live in a style
totally above my pretensions. All these are confessions
more or less painful to make, but now that I have made
them, let me have the result, and say, good-bye--good-
bye.”

There was an emotion in the last words that more than
compensated for what preceded them. It was the genuine
sorrow that loneliness ever impresses on certain natures;
but Calvert read the sentiment as a tribute to himself,
and hastily said, "No, no, you are all wrong. The very
disparities you complain of are the bonds between us.
The differences in our temperament are the resources by
which the sphere of our observation will be wideneil-
my scepticism will be the corrector of your hopefulness-
and, as to means, take my word for it, nobody can be
harder up than I am, and if you'll only keep the bag:
and limit the outgoings, I'll submit to any shortcomings
when you tell me they are savings.”
“Are you serious-downright in earnest in all this?
asked Loyd.
“So serious, that I propose our bargain should begin
from this hour. We shall each of us place ten Na-
poleons in that bag of yours. You shall administer
all outlay, and I bind myself to follow implicitly all
your behests, as though I were a ward and you my
guardian."
.“ I'm not very confident about the success of the
scheme. I see many difficulties already, and there may
be others that I cannot foresee ; still, I am willing to
give it a trial.”
“At last I realise one of my fondest anticipations
vhich was to travel without the daily recurring miseries
of money reckoning."
“Don't take those cigars, they are supplied by the
waiter, and cost two groschen each, and they sell for
tuee groschen a dozen in the Platz ;” and, so saying,
Loyd removed the plate from before him in a quiet
business-like way, that promised well for the spirit in
which his trust would be exercised.

Calvert laughed as he laid down the cigar, but his
obedience ratified the pact between them.
“When do we go from this?" asked he, in a quiet and
half-submissive tone.
“Oh, come, this is too much !” said Loyd. “I under-
took to be purser, but not pilot."
“Well, but I insist upon your assuming all the cares
of legislation. It is not alone that I want not to think of
the cash; but I want to have no anxieties about the road
we go, where we halt, and when we move on. I want,
for once in my life, to indulge the glorious enjoyment of
perfect indolence-such another chance will scarcely
offer itself.”
“Be it so. Whenever you like to rebel, I shall be just
as ready to abdicate. I'll go to my room now and study
the map, and by the time you have finished your even-
ing's stroll on the bridge, I shall have made the plan of
our future wanderings."
. “Agreed !” said Calvert. “I'm off to search for some
of those cheap cigars you spoke of."
“Stay; you forget that you have not got any money.
Here are six silver groschen ; take two dozen, and see
that they don't give you any of those vile Swiss ones in
the number."
He took the coin with becoming gravity, and set out
on his errand

CHAPTER III.
FELLOW-TRAVELLERS' LIFE.
ARTLY to suit Calvert's passion for fishing,
partly to meet his own love of a quiet, un-
LGT broken, easy existence, Loyd decided for a
ramble through the lakes of Northern Italy; and, in about
ten days after the compact had been sealed, they found
themselves at the little inn of the Trota, on the Lago
d'Orta. The inn, which is little more than a cottage, is
beautifully situated on a slender promontory that runs
into the lake, and is itself almost hidden by the foliage of
orange and oleander trees that cover it. It was very
hard to believe it to be an inn with its trellised vine-walk,
its little arched boat-house, and a small shrine beside the
lake, where on certain saints' days, a priest said a mass,
and blessed the fish and those that caught them. It was
still harder, too, to credit the fact when one discovered
his daily expenses to be all comprised within the limits
of a few francs, and this with the services of the host,
Signor Onofrio, for boatman.
To Loyd it was a perfect paradise. The glorious
mountain range, all rugged and snow-capped—the deep-
bosomed chestnut-woods—the mirror-like lake—the soft
and balmy air, rich in orange odours-the earth teeming
with violets—all united to gratify the senses, and wrap the
mind in a dreamy ecstasy and enjoyment. It was equally
a spot to relax in or to work, and although now more

disposed for the former, he planned in himself to come
back here, at some future day, and labour with all the
zest that a strong resolve to succeed inspires.
What law would he not read? What mass of learned
lore would he not store up! What strange and curious
knowledge would he not acquire in this calm seclusion !
Ile parcelled out his day in imagination; and, by rising
early, and by habits of uninterrupted study, he contem-
plated that in one long vacation here he would have
amassed an amount of information that no discursive
labour could ever attain. And then, to distract him from
weightier cares, he would write those light and sketchy
things, some of which had already found favour with
editors. He had already attained some small literary
successes, and was like a very young man, delighted with
the sort of recognition they had procured him ; and last
of all, there was something of romance in this life of
mysterious seclusion. He was the hero of a little story
to himself, and this thought diffused itself over every spot
and every occupation, as is only known to those who
like to make poems of their lives, and be to their own
hearts their own epic.
Calvert, too, liked the place; but scarcely with the
same enthusiasm. The fishing was excellent. He had
taken a “four-pounder," and heard of some double the
size. The cookery of the little inn was astonishingly
good. Onofrio had once been a courier, and picked up
some knowledge of the social chemistry on his travels.
Beccafichi abounded, and the small wine of the Podere
had a false smack of Rhenish, and then with cream, and
fresh eggs, and fresh butter, and delicious figs in pro-
fusion, there were, as he phrased it, “ far worse places in
the hill country!”
Besides being the proprietor of the inn, Onofrio owned

a little villa, a small cottage-like thing on the opposite
shore of the lake, to which he made visits once or twice
a week, with a trout, or a capon, or a basket of artichokes,
· or some fine peaches-luxuries which apparently always
· found ready purchasers amongst his tenants. He called
'them English, but his young guests, with true British
phlegm, asked him no questions about them, and he rarely,
if ever, alluded to them. Indeed, his experience of
English people had' enabled him to see that they ever
maintained a dignified reserve towards each other, even
when offering to foreigners all the freedom of an old
intimacy; and then he had an Italian's tact not to
touch on a dangerous theme, and thus he contented
himself with the despatch of his occasional hamper
without attracting more attention to the matter than
the laborious process of inscribing the words “Illustris-
sima Sign". Grangiari,” on the top.
It was about a month after they had taken up their
abode at the Trota that Onofrio was seized with one
of those fevers of the country which, though rarely dan-
gerous to life, are still so painful and oppressive as to
require some days of confinement and care. In this in-
terval, Calvert was deprived of his chief companion, for
mine host was an enthusiastic fisherman, and an unequalled
guide to all parts of the lake. The young soldier,
chafed and fretted out of all measure at this interrup-
tion to his sport, tried to read; tried to employ himself
in the garden ; endeavoured to write a long-promised
letter home; and at last, in utter failure, and in com-
plete discontent with himself and everything, he walked
moodily about, discussing within himself whether he
would not frankly declare to Loyd that the whole thing
bored him, and that he wanted to be free.
“ This sort of thing suits Loyd well cnough," would he

say. “It is the life of Brazenose or Christchurch in a
purer air and finer scenery. He can read five or six
hours at a stretch, and then plunge in the lake for a swim,
or pull an oar for half an ho'ır, by way of refreshment.
He is as much a man of reflection and thought as I
am of action and energy. Yet, it is your slow, solemn
fellow," he would say, “who is bored to death when
thrown upon himself;” and now he had, in a measure,
to recant this declaration, and own that the solitude was
too much for him.
While he was yet discussing with himself how to
approach the subject, the hostess came to tell him that
Onofrio's illness would prevent him acting as his boat-
man, and begged the boat might be spared him on that
day, to send over some fruit and fresh flowers he had
promised to the family at St. Rosalia ; “that is,” added
she, “if I'm lucky enough to find a boatman to take
then., for at this season all are in full work in the fields."
“What would you say, Donna Marietta, if I were to
take charge of the basket myself, and be your messenger
to the villa ?"
The hostess was far less astonished at his offer than he
had imagined she would be. With her native ideas on
these subjects, she only accepted the proposal as an act
of civility, and not as a surprising piece of condescension,
and simply said, “ Onofrio shall thank you heartily for it
when he is up and about again.”
If this was not the exact sort of recognition he looked
for, Calvert at all events saw that he was pledged to
fulfil his offer; and so he stood by while she measured
out peas, and crunted over artichokes, and tied up
bundles of mint a... thyme, and stored up a pannier full
of ruddy apples, su, lise unting all with a gorgeous bouquet
of richly perfumed fewers, culled in all the careless pro

fusion of that land of plenty. Nor was this all. She
impressed upon him how he was to extol the excellence
of this, and the beauty of that, to explain that the violets
were true Parmesans, and the dates such as only Onofrio
knew how to produce.
Loyd laughed his own little quiet laugh when he heard
of his friend's mission, and his amusement was not les-
sened at seeing the half-awkward and more than half-
unwilling preparations Calvert made to fulfil it.
“Confound the woman !” said he, losing all patience ;
“she wanted to charge me with all the bills and reckon-
ings for the last three weeks, on the pretext that her
husband is but ill-skilled in figures, and that it was a rare
chance to find one like myself to undertake the office. I
have half a mind to throw the whole cargo overboard
when I reach the middle of the lake. I suppose a Nap.
would clear all the cost.”
“Oh, I'll not hear of such extravagance," said Loyd,
demurely.
“I conclude I have a right to an act of personal folly,
eh?” asked Calvert, pettishly.
“ Nothing of the kind. I drew up our contract with
great care, and especially on this very head, otherwise it
would have been too offensive a bargain for him who
should have observed all the rigid injunctions of its
economy.”
“It was a stupid arrangement from the first," said
Calvert warmly. “Two men yet never lived, who could
say that each could bound his wants by those of another.
Not to say that an individual is not himself the same each
clay of the week. I require this on Tuesday, which I
didn't want on Monday, and so on."
“You are talking of caprice as though it were necessity,
Calvert.”

23
“I don't want to discuss the matter like a special plea-
der, and outside the margin of our conjoint expenses I
mean to be as wasteful as I please.”
“As the contract is only during pleasure, it can never
be difficult to observe it.”
“Yes, very true. You have arrived at my meaning
by another road. When was it we last replenished the
bag?”
“ A little more than a week ago."
“So that there is about a fortnight yet to run?
“ About that.”
Calvert stood in thought for a few seconds, and then,
as if having changed the purpose he was meditating,
turned suddenly away and hastened down to the boat
quay.
Like many bashful and diffident men, Loyd had a false
air of coldness and resolution, which impressed others
greatly, but reacted grievously on his own heart in mo-
ments of afterthought; and now, no sooner had his com-
panion gone, than he felt what a mockery it was for him
to have assumed a rigid respect for a mere boyish agree-
ment, which lost all its value the moment either felt it
burdensome. “I was not of an age to play Mentor to
him. It could never become me to assume the part of a
guardian. I ought to have said the bargain ceases the
instant you repudiate it. A forced companionship is
mere slavery. Let us part the good friends we met; and
so on." At last he determined to sit down and write a
short note to Calvert, releasing him from his thraldom,
and giving him his full and entire liberty.
“As for myself, I will remain here so long as I stay
abroad, and if I come to the continent again, I will make
for this spot as for a home : and now for the letter."

CHAPTER IV.
THE “LAGO D'ORTA."
WEAVING Loyd to compose his letter, we will
follow Calvert, as, with vigorous stroke, he
rushed his light boat through the calm water,
leaving a long bright line of bubbles in his wake.
Dressed in his blue flannel shirt and white trousers, a gay
bunch of roses stuck jauntily in the side of his straw hat,
there was an air of health, vigour, and dash about him, to
which his full bright eye and upturned moustache well
contributed. And, as from time to time he would rest on
his oars, while his thin skiff cleaved her way alone, his
bronzed and manly face and carelessly waving hair made
up a picture of what we are proud to think is eminently
British in its character. That is to say, there was about
him much of what indicated abundance of courage, no
small proportion of personal strength, and a certain sort
· of recklessness, which in a variety of situations in life is
equivalent to power.
To any eye that watched him, as with scarce an effort
he sent his boat forward, while the lazy curl of smoke
that rose from his short pipe indicated ease, there would
have seemed one who was indulging in the very fullest
enjoyment of a scene second to none in Europe Vnu
had but to look along thu itself to see the muse

ing in every tint of colour from the pure white of the

oleander to the deep scarlet of the San Giuseppe, with, in
the distance, the snow-capped Alps of the St. Bernard,
while around and close to the very water's edge peeped
forth little villas, half smothered in orange-blossoms. Far
over the lake came their floating perfumes, as though to
lend enchantment to each sense, and steep the very soul
in a delicious luxury.
Now, as Calvert felt the refreshing breath of the gentle
air that stirred the water, he was conscious of a glorious
morning, and of something generally grand in the scene
about him; but that was all. He had little romance -
less of the picturesque—in his nature. If his eyes fell on
the lake, it was to fancy the enjoyment of cleaving
through it as a swimmer; if he turned towards the Alps,
it was to imagine how toilsome would prove the ascent ;
how deeply lay the snow on the wheels of the diligence;
how many feet below the surface were buried the poles
that once marked out the road. But even these were but
fleeting fancies. His thoughts were seriously turned upon
his own future, which opened no bright or brilliant pro-
spect before him. To go back again to India, to return
to the old regimental drudgery, or the still more wearisome
existence of life in a remote detachment; to waste what
he felt the best years of life in inglorious indolence, wait
ing for that routine promotion that comes associated with
the sense of growing old ; and to trace at last the dim
vista of a return to England, when of an age that al!
places and people and things have grown to be matters
of indifference. These were sad reflections. So sad,
that not even the bright scene around him could dispel,
And then there were others, which needed no speculation
to suggest, and which came with the full force of docu-
ments to sustain them. He was heavily in debt. He
owed money to the army agent, to the paymaster, to the

Agra Bank, to the regimental tailor, to the outfitter-io
everyone, in short, who would suffer him to be a debtor.
Bonds, and I O's, and promissory notes, renewed till they
had nigh doubled, pressed on his memory, and confused
his powers of calculation.
An old uncle, a brother of his mother's, who was his
guardian, would once on a time have stood by him, but
he had forfeited his good esteem by an act of deception
with regard to money, which the old man could not for-
give. “Be it so," said he ; “I deemed my friendship for
you worth more than three hundred pounds. You, it
would seem, are differently minded; keep the money and
let us part.” And they did part, not to meet again.
Calvert's affairs were managed by the regimental agent,
and he thought little more of an old relative, who ceased
to hold a place in his memory when unassociated with
crisp inclosures “payable at sight.”
“I wonder what would come of it if I were to write to
him; if I were to put it to his humanity to rescue me
from a climate where, after all, I might die—scores of
fellows die out there. At all events, I detest it. I could
say, "My leave expires in October, if you would like to
see me once more before I quit England for ever, for I
am going to a pestilential spot—the home of the ague and
jungle fever, and Heaven knows what else—your sister's
son-poor Sophy's child.' That ought to touch him.”
And then he went on to think of all the tender and
moving things he could write, and to picture to himself
the agitation of him who read them; and thus speculating,
and thus plotting, he swept his light boat along till she
came close in to shore, and he saw the little villa peeping
through the spray-like branches of a weeping ash that
stood beside it. “Higher up,” cried a voice, directing
him. “Don't you know the landing-place yet ?” And,

startled by a voice not altogether strange to him, he
looked round and saw the old lady of the Rhine
steamer, the same who had snubbed him at Coblentz,
the terrible Miss Grainger of the lost writing-case.
It was some minutes before he remembered that
he was performing the part of boatman, and not ap-
pearing in his own character. Resolved to take all the
benefit of his incognito, he lifted his hat in what he
fancied to be the true Italian style, and taking a
basket in each hand, followed the old lady to the
house.
“It is three days that we have been expecting you,"
said she, tartly, as she walked briskly on, turning at
times to point a sarcasm with a fierce look. “You
were punctual enough on Tuesday last, when you came
for your rent. You were to the very minute then, be-
cause it suited yourself. But you are like all your
countrymen-mean, selfish, and greedy. As to those
pears you brought last, I have struck them off the
account. You may bring others if you please, but I'll
not pay for rotten fruit any more than I will for
three journeys to Como for nothing - do you hear
me, Sir ? three journeys to look after my writing-desk,
which I lost on the Rhine, but which I know was
forwarded here, though I can't get it. Is it worth your
while to answer ? Oh, of course, your old excuse—you
are forgetting your English-it is so long since you were
a courier. You knew quite enough, when I came here,
to make me pay more than double the proper rent fri
this miserable place, with out a carpet, or->” Just as
she reaclied thus far, she was joined by one of the
young girls, whose looks had vastly changed for the
better, and was now a strikingly fine and handsome
girl

A Kent in a Cloud.
“Milly," said the old lady, “take this man round by
the kitchen garden, and get some one to take the fruit
from him, and be sure you count the melons.”
Not sorry for the change of companionship, Calvert
followed Milly, who, not condescending to bestow a look
on him, moved haughtily on in front.
“Leave your baskets yonder, my good man,” said she,
pointing to a bench under a spreading fig-tree; and
Calvert, depositing his burden, drew himself up and re-
moved his hat. “My aunt will pay you,” said she, turn-
ing to go away.
“I'd far rather it had been the niece," said he, in
English.
“What do you mean? Who are you ?".
“ A stranger, who, rather than suffer you to incur the
privation of a breakfast without fruit, rowed across the.
lake this morning to bring it.”
“Won't he go, Milly? What is he bargaining about ? ”
cried Miss Grainger, coming up.
But the young girl ran hastily towards her, ani for
some minutes they spoke in a low tone together.
“I think it an impertinence—yes, an impertinence,
Milly—and I mean to tell him so !” said the old lady,
fuming with passion. “Such things are not done in the
world. They are unpardonable liberties. What is your.
naine, Sir?”
“ Calvert, Madam.”
“Calvert ? Calvert? Not Calvert of Rocksley?" said
she, with a sneer.
“No, Ma'am, only his nephew.”
"Are you his nephew, realiy nis nephew ?" said she
with a haif incredulity.
“Yes, Madam, I have that very unprofitable honour.

their crest;" and he detached a seal from his watch-chain
and handed it to her.
“Quite true, the portcullis and the old motto, 'Ferme
en Tombant.' I know, or rather I knew yo'ir relatives
once, Mr. Calvert;" this was said with a total change of
manner, and a sort of simpering politeness that sat very
ill upon her.
Quick enough to mark this change of manner and
profit by it, he said, somewhat coldly, “ Have I heard
your name, Madam? Will you permit me to know it ? "
. “Miss Grainger, Sir. Miss Adelaide Grainger"-
reddening as she spoke.
“Never heard that name before. Will you present me
to this young lady?" And thus with an air of pretension,
whose impertinence was partly covered by an appearance
of complete unconsciousness, he bowed and smiled, and
chatted away till the servant announced breakfast.
To the invitation to join them, he vouchsafed the
gentlest bend of the head, and a half smile of acceptance,
which the young lady resented by a stare that might have
made a less accomplished master of impertinence blush
to the very forehead. Calvert was, however, a proficient
in his art.
As they entered the breakfast-room, Miss Grainger
presented him to a young and very delicate-looking girl
who lay on a sofa propped up by cushions, and shrouded
with shawls, though the season was summer.
“Florence, Mr. Calvert. Miss Florence Walter. An
invalid come to benefit by the mild air of Italy, Sir, but
who feels even these breezes too severe and too bracing
for her.”
“Egypt is your place,” said Calvert; “one of those
nice villas on the sea slope of Alexandretta, with the palm.
trees and the cedars to keep off the sun;" and seating

himself by her side in an easy familiar way, devoid of alı
excess of freedom, talked to her about health and sick-
ness in a fashion that is very pleasant to the ears of
suffering. And he really talked pleasantly on the theme.
It was one of which he had already some experience.
The young wife of a brother officer of his own had gained,
in such a sojourn as he pictured, health enough to go on
to India, and was then alive and well, up in the Hill
country above Simlah.
“Only fancy, aunt, what Mr. Calvert is promising me
-to be rosy-cheeked,” said the poor sick girl, whose pale
face caught a slight pinkish tint as she spoke.
. “I am not romancing in the least,” said Calvert, taking
his place next Milly at the table. “The dryness of
the air, and the equitable temperature, work, 'positively,
miracles;” and he went on telling of cures and recoveries.
When at last he arose to take leave, it was amidst a
shower of invitations to come back, and pledges on his
part to bring with him some sketches of the scenery of
Lower Egypt, and some notes he had made of his
wanderings there.
“By-the-way,” said he, as he gained the door, “have
· your permission to present a friend who lives with me
ma strange, bashful, shy creature, very good in his way,
though that way isn't exactly my way; but really clever
and well read, I believe. May I bring him? Of course
I hope to be duly accredited to you myself, through
my uncle."
“ You need not, Mr. Calvert. I recognise you for
one of the family in many ways,” said Miss Grainger;
“and when your friend accompanies you, he will be
most welcome.”
So, truly cordially they partede

CHAPTER V.
OLD MEMORIES.
HEN Calvert rejoined his friend, he was full
of the adventure of the morning — such a
WAK glorious discovery as he had made. What a
wonderful old woman, and what charming girls! Milly,
however, he owned, rather inclined to the contemptuous.
“She was what you Cockneys call sarcy,' Loyd; but the
sick girl was positively enchanting ; so pretty, so gentle,
and so confiding withal. By-the-way, you must make me
three or four sketches of Nile scenery--a dull flat, with a
palm-tree, group of camels in the fore, and a pyramid in
the background; and I'll get up the journal part, while
you are doing the illustrations. I know nothing of Egypt
beyond the overland route, though I have persuaded them
I kept a house in Cairo, and advised them by all means
to take Florence there for the winter."
“But how could you practise such a deception in such
a case, Calvert ? ” said Loyd, reproachfully.
“ Just as naturally as you have got up' that grand
tone of moral remonstrance. What an arrant humbug
you are, Loyd. Why not keep all this fine indignation
for Westminster, where it will pay ?"
“Quiz away, if you like; but you will not prevent me
saying that the case of a poor sick girl is not one for a
foolish jest, or a--"

He stopped and grew very red, but the other con-
tinued :-
“Out with it, man. You were going to say, a false
hood. I'm not going to be vexed with you because you
happen to have a rather crape-coloured temperament, and
like turning things round till you find the dark side of
them.” He paused for a few seconds and then went on :
“ If you had been in my place this morning, I knjw well
enough what you'd have done. You'd have rung the
changes over the uncertainty of life, and all its miseries
and disappointments. You'd have frightened that poor
delicate creature out of her wits, and driven her sister half
distracted, to satisfy what you imagine to be your con-
science, but which, I know far better, is nothing but a
morbid love of excitement—an unhealthy passion for
witnessing pain. Now, I left her actually looking better for
my visit-she was cheered and gay, and asked when I'd
come again, in a voice that betrayed a wish for my return."
Loyd never liked being drawn into a discussion with
his friend, seeing how profitless such encounters are in
general, and how likely to embitter intercourse; so
he merely took his hat and moved towards the door.
“Where are you going? Not to that odious task of
photography, I hope?” cried Calvert.
“Yes," said the other, smiling ; “I am making a com- .
plete series of views of the lake, and some fine day
or other I'll make water-colour drawings from them.”
“How I hate all these fine intentions that only point
to more work. Tell me of a plan for a holiday, some
grand scheme for idleness, and I am with you ; but to sit
quietly down and say, “I'll roll that stone up a hill next
summer, or next autumn,' that drives me mad.”
“Well, I'll not drive you mad. I'll say nothing about
it,” said Loyd, with a good-natured smile.

“But won't you make me these drawings, these jottings
of my tour amongst the Pyramids ?”
“Not for such an object as you want them to serve."
“I suppose, when you come to practise at the bar,
you'll only defend innocence and protect virtue, eh?
You'll, of course, never take the brief of a knave, or try
to get a villain off. With your principles, to do so would
be the basest of all crimes."
“I hope I'll never do that deliberately which my
conscience tells me I ought not to do.”

I think I see some poor devil coming to you about a 'cas
de conscience,' and going away sorely puzzled with your
reply to him.”
“Don't come to me with one of yours, Calvert, that's
all,” said Loyd, laughing, as he hurried off.
Like many men who have a strong spirit of banter in
them, Calvert was vexed and mortified when his sarcasm
did not wound. “If the stag will not run, there can be
no pursuit,” and so was it that he now felt angry with
Loyd, angry with himself. “I suppose these are the sort
of fellows who get on in life. The world likes their quiet
subserviency, and their sleek submissiveness. As for ine,
and the like of me, we are 'not placed.' Now for a line

to my Cousin Sophy, to know who is the 'Grainger' who
says she is so well acquainted with us all. Poor Sophy,
it was a love affair once between us, and then it came to
a quarrel, and out of that we fell into the deeper bitterness
of what is called a friendship.' We never really hated
each other till we came to that!”
“Dearest, best of friends,” he began, “in my broken
health, fortunes, and spirits, I came to this place a few
weeks ago, and made, by chance, the acquaintance of
an atrocious old woman called Grainger-Miss or Mrs.,
I forget which—who is she, and why does she know
us, and call us the 'dear Calverts,' and your house
sweet old Rocksley?' I fancy she must be a begging-
letter impostor, and has a design-it will be a very
abortive one—upon my spare five-pound notes. Tell me
all you know of her, and if you can add a word about her
nieces twain-one pretty, the other prettier-do so.
“ Any use in approaching my uncle with a state-
ment of my distresses — mind, body, and estate ? " I
owe him so much gratitude that, if he doesn't want me
to be insolvent, he must help me a little further.
“Is it true you are going to be married? The
thought of it sends a pang through me, of such anguish
as I dare not speak of. Oh dear! oh dear! what a
flood of bygones are rushing upon me, after all my
pledges, all my promises ! One of these girls reminded
me of your smile; how like, but how different, Sophy.
Do say there's no truth in the story of the marriage, and
believe me—what your heart will tell you I have never
ceased to be—your devoted
- HARRY CALVERT.”
“I think that oughé to do," said he, as he read over
the letter ; "and there's no peril in it, since her marriage

is fixed for the end of the month. It is, after all, a cheap
luxury to bid for the lot that will certainly be knocked
down to another. She's a nice girl, too, is Sophy, but,
like all of us, with a temper of her own. · I'd like to see
her married to Loyd, they'd make each other perfectly
miserable.”
With this charitable reflection to turn over in various
ways, tracing all the consequences he could imagine might
spring from it, he sauntered out for a walk beside the lake.
“This box has just come by the mail from Chiasso,”
said his host, pointing to a small parcel, corded and
sealed. “It is the box the signora yonder has been
searching for these three weeks; it was broken when the
diligence upset, and they tied it together as well as they
could.”
The writing-desk was indeed that which Miss Grainger
had lost on her Rhine journey, and was now about to
reach her in a lamentable condition-one hinge torn off,
the lock strained, and the bottom split from one end to
the other.
“I'll take charge of it. I shall go over to see her in a
day or two, perhaps to-morrow;" and with this Calvert
carried away the hox to his own room.
As he was laying the desk on his table, the bottom
gave way, and the contents fell about the room. They
were a mass of papers and letters, and some parch
ments; and he proceeded to gather them up as best
he might, cursing the misadventure, and very angry
with himself for being involved in it. The letters were
in little bundles, neatly tied, and docketed with the
writers' names. These he replaced in the box, having
inverted it, and placing all, as nearly as he could, in
due order, till he came to a thick papered document
tied with red tape at the corner, and entitled Draft of

Jacob Walter's Will, with Remarks of Counsel. “This
we must look at,” said Calvert. “What one can see at
Doctors' Commons for a shilling is no breach of con-
fidence, even if seen for nothing ;" and with this he
opened the paper.
It was very brief, and set forth how the testator had
never made, nor would make, any other will, that he
was sound of mind, and hoped to die so. As to his
fortune, it was something under thirty thousand pounds
in Bank Stock, and he desired it should be divided
equally between his daughters, the survivor of them to
have the whole, or, in the event of each life lapsing
before marriage, that the money should be divided
amongst a number of charities that he specified.
“I particularly desire and beg," wrote he, “ that my
girls be brought up by Adelaide Grainger, my late wife's
half-sister, who long has known the hardships of poverty,
and the cares of a narrow subsistence, that they may learn
in early life the necessity of thrift, and not habituate
themselves to luxuries, which a reverse of fortune might
take away from them. I wish, besides, that it shoulj
be generally believed their fortune was one thousand
pounds each, so that they should not become a prey to
fortune-hunters, nor the victims of adventurers, inso-
much that my last request to each of my dear girls
would be not to marry the man who would make
inquiry into the amount of their means till twelve
calendar months after such inquiry, that time being
full short enough to study the character of one thus
palpably worldly-minded and selfish.”
A few cautions as to the snares and pitfails of the
world followed, and the document finished with the
testator's name, and that of three witnesses in pencil, the
words “if they consent,” being added in ink, after them.

“ Twice fifteen make thirty-thirty thousand pounds-
a very neat sum for a great many things, and yielding,
even in its dormant state, about fifteen hundred a year.
What can one do for that ? Live, certainly — live
pleasantly, jovially, if a man were a bachelor. At Paris,
į for instance, with one's pleasant little entresol in the Rue
Neuve, or the Rue Faubourg St. Honoré, and his club,
and his saddle-horses, with even ordinary luck at billiards,
he could make the two ends meet very satisfactorily.
Then, Baden always pays its way, and the sea-side places
also do, for the world is an excellent world to the fellow
who travels with his courier, and only begs to be plucked
a little by the fingers that wear large diamonds.
“But all these enchantments vanish when it becomes a
question of a wife. A wife means regular habits and
respectability. The two most costly things I know of.
Your scampish single-handed valet, who is out all day
on his own affairs, and only turns up at all at some
noted time in your habits, is not one tenth as dear as
that old creature with the powdered head and the
poultice of cravat round his neck, who only bows when
the dinner is served, and grows apoplectic if he draws
a cork.
"It's the same in everything! Your house must be
taken, not because it is convenient or that you like it, but
because your wife can put a pretentious address on her
card. It must be something to which you can tag
Berkeley Square, or Belgravia. In a word, a wife is a
mistake, and, what is worse, a mistake out of which there
is no issue.”
Thus reasoning and reflecting—now, speculating on
what he should feel-now, imagining what “the world"
would say — he again sat down, and once more read
over Mr. Walter's last will and testament.

CHAPTER VI.
SOPHY'S LETTER.
P o N something over a week the post brought two
letters for the fellow-travellers. Loyd's was
from his mother—a very homely affair, full of
affection and love, and overflowing with those little details
of domestic matters so dear to those who live in the
small world of home and its attachments.
Calvert's was from his Cousin Sophy, much briefer, and
very diferent in style. It ran thus :
“Dear Henry- "
“I used to be Harry," muttered he.
“Dear Henry,—It was not without surprise I saw your
handwriting again. A letter from you is indeed an event
at Rocksley.
“The Miss Grainger, if her name be Adelaide (for
there were two sisters) was our nursery governess long
ågo. Cary liked, I hated her. She left us to take charge
of some one's children—relatives of her own, I suspect
and though she made some move about coming to see us,
and presenting ‘her charge,' as she called it, there was
no response to the suggestion, and it dropped. I never
heard more of her.
“As to any hopes of assistance from papa, I can
scarcely speak encouragingly. Indeed, he made no in-
quiry as to the contents of your letter, and only remarked

afterwards to Cary that he trusted the correspondence was
not to continue.
“Lastly, as to myself, I really am at a loss to see liow
my marriage can be a subject of joy or grief, of pleasure
or pain, to you. We are as much separated from each
other in all the relations of life, as we shall soon be by
long miles of distance. Mr. Wentworth Graham is fully
aware of the relations which once subsisted between as,
-he has even read your letters—and it is at his instance
I request that the tone of our former intimacy shall cease
from this day, and that there may not again be any
reference to the past between us. I am sure in this I am
merely anticipating what your own sense of honourable
propriety would dictate, and that I only express a senti-
ment your own judgment has already ratified.
“Believe me to be, very sincerely yours, ' -
“SOPHIA CALVERT.”
“Oh dear! When we were Sophy and Harry, the
world went very differently from now, when it has come
to Henry and Sophia. Not but she is right--right in
everything but one. She ought not to have shown the
letters. There was no need of it, and it was unfair !
There is a roguery in it too, which, if I were Mr. Went-
worth Graham, I'd not like. It is only your most ac-
complished sharper that ever plays 'cartes sur table.' I'd
sorely suspect the woman who would conciliate the new
love by a treachery to the old one. However, happily,
this is his affair, not mine. Though I could make it mine,
too, if I were so disposed, by simply reminding her that
Mr. W. G. has only seen one half, and, by long odds, the
least interesting half, of our correspondence, and that for
the other he must address himself to me. Husbands have
occasionally to learn that a small sealed packet of old

letters would be a more acceptable present to the bride
on her wedding morning than the prettiest trinket from
the Rue de la Paix. Should like to throw this shell into
the midst of the orange-flowers and the wedding favours,
and I'd do it too, only that I could never accurately hear
of the tumult and dismay it caused. I should be left to
mere imagination for the mischief, and imagination no
longer satisfies me.”
While he thus mused, he saw Loyd preparing for one of
his daily excursions with the photographic apparatus, and
could not help a contemptuous pity for a fellow so easily
amused and interested, and so easily diverted from the
great business of life—which he deemed “getting on"-
to a pastime which cost labour and returned no profit.
“Come and see ‘I Grangeri' (the name by which the
Italians designated the English family at the villa), it's far
better fun than hunting out rocky bits, or ruined frag-
ments of masonry. Come, and I'll promise you some-
thing prettier to look at than all your feathery ferns or
drooping foxgloves."
Loyd tried to excuse himself. He was always shy and
timid with strangers. His bashfulness repelled intimacy
and so he frankly owned that he would only be a bar to
his friend's happiness, and throw a cloud over this
pleasant intercourse.
“How do you know but I'd like that?" said
Calvert with a mocking laugh. “How do you know but
I want the very force of a contrast to bring my own
merits more conspicuously forward ? "
“And make them declare when we went away, that
it is inconceivable why Mr. Calvert should have made a
companion of that tiresome Mr. Loyd—so low-spirited
and so dreary, and so uninteresting in every way?"
“ Just so l And that the whole thirg has but one ex-

planation—in Calvert's kindness and generosity; who,
seeing the helplessness of this poor depressed creature,
has actually sacrificed himself to vivify and cheer him.
As we hear of the healthy people suffering themselves
to be bled that they might impart their vigorous heart's
blood to a poor wretch in the cholera."
“But I'm not blue yet,” said Loyd laughing. “I
almost think I could get on with my own resources.”
“Of course you might, in the fashion you do at
present; but that is not life—or at least it is only the
life of a vegetable. Mere existence and growth are not
enough for a man who has hopes to fulfil, and passions
to exercise, and desires to expand into accomplishments,
not to speak of the influence that everyone likes to wield
over his fellows. But, come along, jump into the boat,
and see these girls! I want you ; for there is one of
them I scarcely understand as yet, and as I am always
taken up with her sick sister, I've had no time to learn
more about her.”
“Well,” said Loyd, “not to offer opposition to the
notion of the tie that binds 115, I consent." And sending
back to the cottage all the details of his pursuit, he ac-
companied Calvert to the lake.
“ The invalid girl I shall leave to your attention,
Loyd," said the other, as he pulled across the water. “I
like her the best; but I am in no fear of rivalry in that
quarter, and I want to see what sort of stuff the other is
made of. So, you understand, you are to devote your-
self especially to Florence, taking care, when opportunity
serves, to say all imaginable fine things about me
- my talents, my energy, my good spirits, and so
forth. I'm serious, old fellow, for I will own to you I
mean to marry one of them, though which, I have not yet
decided on.”


## p. 42 (#50) ##############################################

A Rent in a Cloud.
Loyd laughed heartily-far more heartily than in his
quiet habit was his wont-and said, “Since when has
this bright idea occurred to you?”
“I'll tell you," said the other gravely. “I have for
years had a sort of hankering kind of half attachment to
a cousin of mine. We used to quarrel, and make up,
and quarrel again; but somehow, just as careless spend-
thrifts forget to destroy the old bill when they give a
renewal, and at last find a swingeing sum hanging over
them they had never dreamed of, Sophy and I never
entirely cancelled our old scores, but kept them back to
be demanded at some future time. And the end has
been, a regular rupture between us, and she is going to
be married at the end of this month, and, not to be out-
done on the score of indifference, I should like to an-
nounce my own happiness, since that's the word for it,
first."
“But have you means to marry ?”
“Not a shilling."
“Nor prospects ?"
“None."
“ Then I don't understand "
“Of course you don't understand. Nor could I make
you understand how fellows like myself play the game of
life. But let me try by an illustration to enlighten you.
When there's no wind on a boat, and her sails flap lazily
against the mast, she can have no guidance, for there is no
steerage-way on her. She may drift with a current, or rot in
a calm, or wait to be crushed by some heavier craft surging
against her. Any wind-a squall, a hurricane—would be
better than that. Such is my case. Marriage without means
is a hurricane ; but l'd rather face a hurricane than be
water-logged between two winds."
“But the girl you marry-_-"

Sophy's Letter.

“The girl I marry-or rather the girl who marries me
- will soon learn that she's on board a privateer, and that
on the wide ocean called life there's plenty of booty to
be had, for a little dash and a little danger to grasp it.”
“And is it to a condition like this you'd bring the girl
you love, Calvert ?”
“Not if I had five thousand a year. If I owned that,
or even four, I'd be as decorous as yourself; and I'd send
my sons to Rugby, and act as poor-law guardian, and
give my twenty pounds to the county hospital, and be a
model Englishman, to your heart's content. But I haven't
five thousand a year, no, nor five hundred a year; and as
for the poor-house and the hospital, I'm far more likely
to claim the benefit than aid the funds. Don't you see,
my wise-headed friend, that the whole is a question of
money? Morality is just now one of the very dearest
things going, and even the rich cannot always afford it.
As for me, a poor sub in an Indian regiment, I
no more affect it than I presume to keep a yacht, or
stand for a county."
“But what right have you to reduce another to such
straits as these? Why bring a young girl into such a
conflict ?”
“If ever you read Louis Blanc, my good fellow, you'd
have seen that the right of all rights is that of associated
labour. But come, let us not grow too deep in the
theme, or we shall have very serious faces to meet our
friends with, and yonder, where you see the drooping ash
trees, is the villa. Brush yourself up, therefore, for the
coming interview; think of your bits of Shelley and
Tennyson, and who knows but you'll acquit yourself with
honour to your introducer.”
“Let my introducer not be too confident," said
Loyd, smiling; “ but here come the ladies.”

DISSENSION.
SHE knowledge Calvert now possessed of the
humble relations which had subsisted between
12 , Miss Grainger and his uncle's family, had ren-
dered him more confident in his manner, and given him
even a sort of air of protection towards them. Certain it
is, each day made him less and less a favourite at the
villa, while Loyd, on the other hand, grew in esteem and
liking with everyone of them. A preference which, with
whatever tact shrouded, showed itself in various shapes.
“I perceive," said Calvert one morning, as they sat at
breakfast together, “my application for an extension of
leave is rejected. I am ordered to hold myself in readi-
ness to sail with drafts for some regiments in Upper
India !” he paused for a few seconds, and then continued.
“ I'd like anyone to tell me what great difference there is
in real condition between an Indian officer and a tran-
sported felon. In point of daily drudgery there is little,
and as for climate the felon has the best of it.”
“I think you take too dreary a view of your fortune. It
is not the sort of career I would choose, nor would it suit
me, but if my lot had fallen that way, I suspect I'd not
have found it so unendurable.”
“Na. It would not suit you. There's no scope in a

soldier's life for those little sly practices, those sinall
artifices of tact and ingenuity, by which subtlety does its
work in this world. In such a career, all this adroitness
would be clean thrown away."
“I hope,” said Loyd, with a faint smile, “ that you do ·
not imagine that these are the gifts to achieve success in
any calling."
“I don't know—I am not sure, but I rather suspect
they find their place at the Bar.”
“Take my word for it, then, you are totally mistaken.
It is an error just as unworthy of your good sense as it is
of your good feeling !” And he spoke with warmth and
energy.
“Hurrah ! hurrah !" cried Calvert. “For three months
I have been exploring to find one spot in your whole
nature that would respond fiercely to attack, and at last
I have it."
“You put the matter somewhat offensively to me, or
I'd not have replied in this fashion--but let us change the
topic, it is an unpleasant one.”
“I don't think so. When a man nurtures what his
friend believes to be a delusion, and a dangerous delusion,
what better theme can there be than its discussion ? "
“ I'll not discuss it,” said Loyd, with determination.
“ You'll not discuss it?"
"No!”
. “What if I force you? What if I place the question
on grounds so direct and so personal that you can't
help it?"
“I dont understand you."
“You shall presently. For some time back I have
been thinking of asking an explanation from you—an
explanation of your conduct at the villa. Before you
had established an intimacy there, I stood well with

everyone. The old woman, with all her respect for
my family and connexions, was profuse in her at-
tentions. Of the girls, as I somewhat rashly con-
fided to you, I had only to make my choice. I pre
sented you to them, never anticipating that I was doing
anything very dangerous to them or to myself, but I find I
was wrong. I don't want to descend to details, nor in-
quire how and by what arts you gained your influence;
my case is simply with the fact that, since you have been
in favour, I have been out of it. My whole position
with them is changed. I can only suggest now what I
used to order, and I have the pleasure, besides, of seeing
that even my suggestion must be submitted to you and
await your approval.”
“Have you finished ? ” said Loyd, calmly.
“No, far from it! I could make my charge extend
over hours long. In fact, I have only to review our lives
here for the last six or seven weeks, to establish all I
have been saying, and show you that you owe me
an explanation, and something more than an explana.
tion.”
“Have you done now?"
“If you mean, have I said all that I could say on this
subject; no, far from it. You have not heard a fiftieth
part of what I might say about it.”
“Well, I have heard quite enough. My answer is this,
you are totally mistaken ; I never, directly or indirectly,
prejudiced your position. I seldom spoke of you, never
slightingly. I have thought, it is true, that you assumed
owards these ladies a tone of superiority, which could
not fail to be felt by them, and that the habit grew on
you, to an extent you perhaps were not aware of; as,
however, they neither complained of, nor resented it,
and as, besides, you were far more a man of the world

than myself, and consequently knew better what the
usages of society permitted, I refrained from any remark,
nor, but for your present charge, would I say one word
now on the subject.”.
“So, then, you have been suffering in secret all this
time over my domineering and insolent temper, pitying
the damsels in distress, but not able to get up enough of
Quixotism to avenge them ? "
“Do you want to quarrel with me, Calvert ?” said the
other calmly.
“If I knew what issue it would take, perhaps I could
answer you.”
“I'll tell you, then, at least so far as I am concerned, I
have never injured, never wronged you. I have therefore
nothing to recall, nothing to redress, upon any part of my
conduct. In what you conceive you are personally in-
terested, I am ready to give a full explanation, and this
done, all is done between us."
“I thought so, I suspected as much,” said Calvert,
contemptuously. "I was a fool to suppose you'd have
taken the matter differently, and now nothing remains
for me but to treat my aunt's nursery governess with
greater deference, and be inore respectful in the presence
—the august presence—of a lawyer's clerk.”
“Good-bye, Sir,” said Loyd, as he left the room.
Calvert sat down and took up a book, but though he
read three full pages, he knew nothing of what they con-
tained. He opened his desk, and began a letter to Loyd,
a farewell letter, a justification of himself, but done more
temperately than he had spoken; but he tore it up, and
so with a second and a third. As his passion mounted,
he bethought him of his cousin and her approaching
marriage. “I can spoil some fun there,” cried he, aid
wrote as follows:

“Lago d'Orta, August 12.
“Dear Sir,—In the prospect of the nearer relations
which a few days more will establish between us, I ven-
ture to address you thus familiarly. My cousin, Miss
Sophia Calvert, has informed me by a letter I have just
received that she deemed it her duty to place before you
a number of letters written by me to her, at a time when
there subsisted between us a very close attachment.
With my knowledge of my cousin's frankness, her can-
dour, and her courage—for it would also require some
courage—I am fully persuaded that she has informed
you thoroughly on all that has passed. We were both
very young, very thoughtless, and, worse than either,
left totally to our own guidance, none to watch, none to
look after us. There is no indiscretion in my saying that
we were both very much in love, and with that sort of
confidence in each other that renders distrust a crime to
one's own conscience. Although, therefore, she may
have told you much, her womanly dignity would not let
her dwell on these circumstances, explanatory of much,
and palliative of all that passed between us. To you, a
man of the world, I owe this part declaration, less,
however, for your sake or for mine, than for her, for
whom either of us ought to makeany sacrifice in our power.
“The letters she wrote me are still in my possession.
I own they are very dear to me; they are all that
remain of a past, to which nothing in my future life can
recall the equal. I feel, however, that your right to them
is greater than my own, but I do not know how to part
with them. I pray you advise me in this. Say how you
would act in a like circumstance, knowing all that has
occurred, and be assured that your voice will be a com-
mand to your very devoted servant,
a “H. C.

"P.S.-When I began this letter, I was minded to say
my cousin should see it: on second thoughts, I incline
to say not, decidedly not.”
When this base writer had finished writing he fung
down the pen, and said to himself, half aloud, “I'd give
something to see him read this !"
With a restless impatience to do something—anything,
he left the house, walking with hurried steps to the little
jetty where the boats lay. “Where's my boat, Onofrio ?"
said he, asking for the skiff he generally selected.
“ The other signor has taken her across the lake.”
“This is too much,” muttered he. “The fellow fancies
that because he skulks a satisfaction, he is free to practise
an impertinence. He knew I preferred this boat, and
therefore he took her."
.“ Jump in, and row me across to La Rocca,” said he
to the boatman. As they skimmed across the lake, his
mind dwelt only on vengeance, and fifty different ways of
exacting it passed and repassed before him. All, how-
ever, concentrating on the one idea—that to pass some
insult upon Loyd in presence of the ladies would be the
most fatal injury he could inflict, but how to do this.
without a compromise of himself was the difficulty.
“Though no woman will ever forgive a coward,” thought
he, “I must take care that the provocation I offer be
such as will not exclude myself from sympathy." And,
with all his craft and all his cunning, he could not hit upon
a way to this. He fancied, too, that Loyd had gone over
to prejudice the ladies against him by his own version of
what had occurred in the morning. He knew well how,
of late, he himself had not occupied the highest place in
their esteem-it was not alone the insolent and over-
bearing tone he assumed, but a levity in talking of things

51
which otners treated with deference, alike offensive to
morals and manners—these had greatly lowered him in
their esteem, especially of the girls, for old Miss Grainger,
with a traditional respect for his name and family, held
to him far more than the others.
“What a fool I was ever to have brought the fellow
here! What downright folly it was in me to have let
shem ever know him. Is it too late, however, to remedy
this? Can I not yet undo some of this mischief?” This
was a new thought, and it filled his mind till he landed.
As he drew quite close to the shore he saw that the little
awning-covered boat, in which the ladies occasionally
made excursions on the lake, was now anchored under
a large drooping ash, and that Loyd and the girls were on
board of her. Loyd was reading to them; at least so the
continuous and equable tone of his voice indicated, as it
rose in the thin and silent air. Miss Grainger was not
there—and this was a fortunate thing—for now he should
have his opportunity to talk with her alone, and probably
ascertain to what extent Loyd's representations had da-
maged him.
He walked up to the villa, and entered the drawing-
room, as he was wont, by one of the windows that
opened on the green sward without. There was no one
in the room, but a half-written letter, on which the ink
was still fresh, showed that the writer had only left it at
the instant. His eye caught the words, “Dear and Rev-
erend Sir,” and in the line beneath the name Loyd. The
temptation was too strong, and he read on :
“Dear and Reverend Sir,—I hasten to express my entire
satisfaction with the contents of your etter. Your son,
Mr. Loyd, has most faithfully represented his position
and his prospects, and, althougli my niece might possibly

have placed her chances of happiness in the hands of a
wealthier suitor, I am fully assured she never could have
met with one whose tastes, pursuits, and general dis-
position "
A sound of coming feet startled him, and he had but
time to throw himself on a sofa, when Miss Grainger
entered. Her manner was cordial—fully as cordial as
usual—perhaps a little more so, since, in the absence
of her nieces, she was free to express the instinctive
regard she felt towards all that bore his name.
“How was it that you did not come with Loyd ? :
asked she.
“I was busy, writing letters I believe-congratulations
on Sophy's approaching marriage ; but what did Loyd say
was that the reason he gave ?”.
“He gave none. He said he took a whim into his
head to row himself across the lake; and indeed I half
suspect the exertion was too much for him. He has
been coughing again, and the pain in his side hasreturned.”
“He's a wretched creature-I mean as regards health
and strength. . Of course he always must have been so :
but the lives these fellows lead in London would breach
the constitution of a really strong man.”
“Not Loyd, however; he never kept late hours, nor
had habits of dissipation."
“I don't suppose he ever told you that he had," said
he, laughing. “I conclude that he has never shown you
nis diary of town life.”
“But do you tell me, seriously, that he is a man of '
dissipated habits ?”.
“Not more so than eight out of every ten, perhaps, in
his class of life. The student is everywhere more given
to the excitements of vice than the sportsman. It is

the compensation for the wearisonne monotony of brain
labour, and they give themselves up to excesses from
which the healthier nature of a man with country tastes
would revolt at once. But what have I to do with his
habits ? I am not his guardian nor his confessor.”
“But they have a very serious interest for me."
“Then you must look for another counsellor. I am
not so immaculate that I can arraign others; and, if I
were, I fancy I might find some pleasanter occupation.”
“But if I tell you a secret, a great secret- "
“I'd not listen to a secret. I detest secrets, just as I'd
hate to have the charge of another man's money. So, I warn
you, tell me nothing that you don't want to hear talked
of at dinner, and before the servants.”
“Yes; but this is a case in which I really need your
advice.”
“ You can't have it at the price you propose. Not to
add, that I have a stronger sentiment to sway me in
this case, which you will understand at once, when I
you tell that he is a man of whom I would like to speak
with great reserve, for the simple reason that I don't like
him."
“Don't like him! You don't like him!”
“It does seem very incredible to you; but I must re-
peat it, I don't like him.”
“ But will you tell me why? What are the grounds of
your dislike ?"
“Is it not this very moment I have explained to you
that my personal feeling towards him inspires a degree of
deference which forbids me to discuss his character ?
He may be the best fellow in Europe, the bravest, the
boldest, the frankest, the fairest. All I have to say is,
that if I had a sister, and he proposed to marry her,
I'd rather see her a corpse than his wife ; and how you

have .ed me into a confession that I told you i'd not
enter upon. Say another word about it, and I'll go and
ask Loyd to come up here and listen to the discussion,
ſor I detest secrets and secrecy, and I'll have nothing to
say to either."
“You'd not do anything so rash and inconsiderate ?"
“Don't provoke me, that's all. You are always telling
me you know the Calverts, their hot-headedness, their
passionate warmth, and so on. I leave it to yourself,
is it wise to push me further ?”
“May I show you a letter I received yesterday morn.
ing, in reply to one of mine?”
“ Not if it refers to Loyd.”
“ It does refer to him.”
“ Then I'll not read it. I tell you for the last
time, I'll not be cheated into this discussion. I don't
desire to have it said of me some fine morning, “You
talked of the man that you lived with on terms of in-
timacy. You chummed with him, and yet you told stories
of him.'"
"If you but knew the difficulty of the position in which
you have placed me—".
“I know at least the difficulty in which you have placed
me, and I am resolved not to incur it. Have I given to
you Sophy's letter to read ?” said he with a changed
voice. “I must fetch it out to you and let you see
all that she says of her future happiness.” And thus,
by a sudden turn, he artfully engaged her in recollections
of Rocksley, and all the persons and incidents of a re-
mote long ago!
When Loyd returned with the girls to the house, Cal-
vert soon saw that he had not spoken to them on the
altercation of the morning—a reserve which he ungene-
rously attributed to the part Loyd himself filled in the

55
controversy. The two met with a certain reserve; but
which, however felt and understood by each, was not
easily marked by a spectator. Florence, however, saw it,
with the traditional clearness of an invalid. She read
what healthier eyes never detect. She saw that the men
had either quarrelled, or were on the brink of a quarrel,
and she watched them closely and narrowly. This was
the easier for her, as at meal times she never came to
table, but lay on a sofa, and joined in the conversation
at intervals.
Oppressed by the consciousness of what had occurred
in the morning, and far less able to conceal his emotions
or master them than his companion, Loyd was discon-
certed and ill at ease : now answering at cross-purposes,
now totally absorbed in his own reflections. As Calvert
saw this, it encouraged him to greater efforts to be agree-
able. He could, when he pleased, be a most pleasing
guest. He had that sort of knowledge of people and life
which seasons talk so well, and suits so many listeners.
He was curious to find out to which of the sisters Loyd
was engaged, but all his shrewdness could not fix the
point decisively. He talked on incessantly, referring
occasionally to Loyd to confirm what he knew well the
other's experience could never have embraced, and
asking frankly, as it were, for his opinion on people he
was fully aware the other had never met with.
Emily (or Milly, as she was familiarly called) Walter
showed impatience more than once at these sallies, which
always made Loyd confused and uncomfortable, so that
Calvert leaned to the impression that it was she herself
was the chosen one. As for Florence, she rather en-
joyed, he thought, the awkward figure Loyd presented,
and she even laughed outright at his bashful embar-
rassment

“Yes,” said Calvert to himself, “Florence is with me.
“What spirits he has," said Miss Grainger, as she
brought the sick girl her coffee. “I never saw him in a
gayer mood. He's bent on tormenting Loyd though, for
he has just proposed a row on the lake, and that he
should take one boat and Loyd the other, and have a
race. He well knows who'll win.”
“ That would be delightful, aunt. Let us have it by
all means. Mr. Calvert, I engage you. You are to take
me. Emily will go with Mr. Loyd."
“And I'll stand at the point and be the judge,” said
Miss Grainger.
Calvert never waited for more, butspringing up, hastened
down to the shore to prepare the boat. He was soon
followed by Miss Grainger, with Florence leaning on her
arm, and looking brighter and fairer than he thought he
had ever seen her.
“Let us be off at once," whispered Calvert, "for I'd
-before I begin ;” and, placing the sick girl tenderly in
the stern, he pulled vigorously out into the lake. “What
a glorious evening !” said he. “Is there anything in the
world can equal one of these sunsets on an Italian lake,
with all the tints of the high Alps blending softly on the
calm water ? "
She made no answer; and he went on enthusiastically
about the scene, the hour, the stillness, and the noble sub-
limity of the gigantic mountains which arose around them.
Scarcely, however, had Calvert placed her in the boat,
and pulled out vigorously from the shore, than he saw a
marked change come over the girl's face. All the laugh-
ing gaiety of a moment back was gone, and an expression
of anxiety had taken its place.

- You are not ill ? ” asked he, eagerly.
“No. Why do you ask me?"
“I was afraid —I fancied you looked paler. You seem
changed.”
“So I am,” said she, seriously. “ Answer me what I
shall ask, but tell me frankly.”
“ That I will ; what is it?"
“ You and Loyd have quarrelled—what was it about?"
“What a notion! Do you imagine that the siliy
quizzing that passes between young men implies a
quarrel ? "
“No matter what I fancy ; tell me as candidly as you
said you would. What was the subject of your disagree-
ment?”
“How peremptory you are,” said he laughing. “Are
you aware that to give your orders in this fashion implies
one of two things—a strong interest in me, or in my
adversary ?"
“Well, I accept the charge ; now for the confession."
“Am I right, then, dearest Florence ?” said he, ceas-
ing to row, and leaning down to look the nearer at her.
“Am I right, then, that your claim to this knowledge is
· the best and most indisputable ?"
“ Tell me what it is !” said she, and her pale face
suddenly glowed with a deep flush.
“You guessed aright, Florence, we did quarrel; that
is, we exchanged very angry words, though it is not very
easy to say how the difference began, nor how far it
went. I was dissatisfied with him. I attributed to his
influence, in some shape or other, that I stood less well
here—in your esteem, I mean—than formerly; and he
somewhat cavalierly told me if there were a change I
owed it to myself, that I took airs upon me, that I was
haughty, ſresuming, and fifty other things of the same

sort; and so, with an interchange of such courtesies, we
grew at last to feel very warm, and finally reached that
point where men- of the world, at least-understand
discussion ceases, and something else succeeds."
“Well, go on,” cried she, eagerly.
“ All is told; there is no more to say. The lawyer did
not see the thing, perhaps, in the same vulgar light that
I did ; he took his hat, and came over here. I followed
him, and there's the whole of it.”
“I think he was wrong to comment upon your man-
ner, if not done from a sense of friendship, and led on to
it by some admission on your part.”
“Of course he was; and I am charmed to hear you
say so.”
She was silent for some time, leaning her head on her
hand, and appearing deep in thought.
“Now that I have made my confession, will you let me
have one of yours ? ” said he, in a low, soft voice.
“ I'm not sure; what's it to be about ?"
“It's about myself I want to question you."
“ About yourself! Surely you could not have hit upon
a sorrier adviser, or a less experienced counsellor than I
am.”
“I don't want advice, Florence, I only want a fact;
and from all I have seen of you, I believe you will
deal fairly with me.”
She nodded assent, and he went on:
“In a few weeks more I shall be obliged to return
to India; to a land I dislike, and a service I detest:
to live amongst companions distasteful to me, and amidst
habits and associations that, however endurable when I
knew no better, are now become positively odious in my
eyes. This is my road to rank, station, and honour.
There is, however, another path; and if I relinquish

this career, and give up all thought of ambition, I might
remain in Europe--here, perhaps, on this very lake side
- and lead a life of humble but unbroken happiness
one of those peaceful existences which poets dream of,
but never realise, because it is no use in disparaging the
cup of life till one has tasted and known its bitterness;
and these men lave not reached such experience - 1
have."
He waited for her to speak—he looked eagerly at her
for a word—but she was silent.
“The confession I want from you, Florence, is this :
could you agree to share this life with me?”
She shook her head and muttered, but what he could.
not catch.
“It would be too dreary, too sad-coloured, you
think?"
“No," said she, “not that.”
“ You fear, perhaps, that these schemes of isolation
have never succeeded : that weariness will come when
there are no longer new objects to suggest interest or
employment?”
“Not that,” said she, more faintly.
“ Then the objection must be myself. Flurence, is it
that you would not, that you could not, trust me with
your happiness ?”
“You ask for frankness, and you shall have it. I
cannot except your offer. My heart is no longer mine to
give.”
“ And this—this engagement, has been for some time
back?” asked he, almost sternly.
“Yes, for some time," said she, faintly,
“Am I acquainted with the object of it? Perhaps I
have no right to ask this. But there is a question I have
full and perfect right to ask. How, consistently with

such an engagement, have you encouraged the attentions
I have paid you ?”
“Attentions ! and to me! Why, your attentions have
been directed rather to my sister—at least, she always
thought so—and even these we deemed the mere passing
flirtations of one who made no secret of saying that he
regarded marriage as an intolerable slavery, or rather, the
heavy price that one paid for the pleasure of courtship."
“Are the mere levities with which I amused an hour
to be recorded against me as principles ?”.
“ Only when such levities fitted into each other so
accurately as to show plan and contrivance."
“ It was Loyd said that. That speech was his. I'd
lay my life on it."
" I think not. At least, if the thought were his, he'd
have expressed it far better.".
“You admire him, then?” asked he, peering closely
at her.
“I wonder why they are not here,” said she, turning
her head away. “This same race ought to come off by
this time."
“Why don't you answer my question ?"
“There he goes! Rowing away all alone, too, and
my aunt is waving her handkerchief in farewell. See
how fast he sends the boat through the water. I wonder
why he gave up the race?".
"Shall I tell you ? He dislikes whatever he is chai.
lenged to do. He is one of those fellows who will never
dare to measure himself against another.”
“My aunt is beckoning to us to come back, Mr. Cale
vert."
“And my taste is for going forward,” muttered he,
while at the same time he sent the boat's head suddenly
round, and pulled vigorously towards the shore.

“May I trust that what has passed between us is a
secret, and not to be divulged to another—not even to
your sister ?”
“If you desire—if you exact.”
“I do, most decidedly. It is shame enough to be re-
jected. I don't see why my disgrace is to be paraded
either for pity or ridicule.”
“Oh, Mr, Calvert— ".
“Or triumphed over,” said he sternly, as he sent the
boat up to the side of the little jetty, where Miss Grainger
and her niece awaited them.
“Poor Loyd has just got bad news from home," said
Miss Grainger, “ and he has hastened back to ask, by
telegraph, if they wish him to return."
“Anyone ill, or dying?" asked Calvert carelessly.
“No, it's some question of law about his father's vicar-
age. There would seem to be a doubt as to his presen-
tation-whether the appointment lay with the patron or
the bishop."
Calvert turned to mark how the girls received these
tidings, but they had walked on, and with heads bert
down, and close together, were deep in conversation.
“I thought it was only in my profession,” said Cal.
vert sneeringly, “where corrupt patronage was practised.
It is almost a comfort to think how much the good people
resemble the wicked ones.”
Miss Grainger, who usually smiled at his levities, looked
grave at this one, and no more was said, as they moved
on towards the cottage.

CHAPTER VIII.
GROWING DARKER.
root was late at night when Calvert left the villa,
but, instead of rowing directly back to the
A little inn, he left his boat to drift slowly in the
scarce perceptible current of the lake, and wrapping
himself in his cloak, lay down to muse or to sleep.
It was just as day broke that he awoke, and saw that
he had drifted within a few yards of his quarters, and in
a moment after he was on shore.
As he gained his room, he found a letter for him in
Loyd's hand. It ran thus :
“I waited up all night to see you before I started, for
I have been suddenly summoned home by family circum-
stances. I was loth to part in an angry spirit, or even
in coldness, with one in whose companionship I have
passed so many happy hours, and for whom I feel,
notwithstanding what has passed between us, a sincere
interest. I wanted to speak to you of much which I cannot
write—that is to say, I would have endeavoured to gain a
hearing for what I dare not venture to set down in the
deliberate calm of a letter. When I own that it was of
yourself, your temper, your habits, your nature, in short,
that I wished to have spoken, you will, perhaps, say that
it was as well time was not given me for such temerity. But
bear in mind, Calvert, that though I am free to admit all

63
your superiority over myself, and never would presume
to compare my faculties or my abilities with yours-
though I know well there is not a single gift or grace ir
· which you are not my master, there is one point in which I
have an advantage over you—I had a mother! You, you
have often told me, never remember to have seen yours.
To that mother's trainings I owe anything of good, how-
ever humble it be, in my nature, and, though the soil in
which the seed has fallen be poor and barren, so much
of fruit has it borne that I at least respect the good which
I do not practise, and I reverence that virtue to which
I am a rebel. The lesson, above all others, that she in-
stilled into me, was to avoid the tone of a scoffer, to
rescue myself from the cheap distinction which is open
to everyone who sets himself to see only ridicule in
what others respect, and to mock the themes that others
regard with reverence. I stop, for I am afraid to weary
you-I dread that, in your impatience, you will throw
this down and read no more, I will only say, and I say
it in all the sincerity of truth, that if you would en-
leavour to be morally as great as what your faculties
can make you intellectually, there is no eminence you
might not attain, nor any you would not adorn.
“If our intimacy had not cooled down of late, from
what causes I am unable to tell, to a point in which
the first disagreement must be a breach between us, I
would have told you that I had formed an attachment to
Florence Walter, and obtained her aunt's consent to our
marriage; I mean, of course, at some future which I cannot
define, for I have my way to make in the world, and, up to
che present, have only been a burden on others. We
are engaged, however, and we live on hope. Perhaps
I presume too far on any interest you could feel for me
when I make you this communication. It may be that

you will say, "What is all this to me?' At all events,
I have told you what, had I kept back, would have
seemed to myself an uncandid reservation. Deal with it
how you may.
“There is, however, another reason why I should tell
you this. If you were unaware of the relations which
exist between our friends and myself, you might uncon-
sciously speak of me in terms which this knowledge
would, perhaps, modify—at least, you would speak with-
out the consciousness that you were addressing unwilling
hearers. You now know the ties that bind us, and your
words will have that significance which you intend they
should bear.
“Remember, and remember distinctly, I disclaim all
pretension, as I do all wish, to conciliate your favour as
regards this matter; first, because I believe I do not
need it; and secondly, that if I asked for, I should be
unworthy of it. I scarcely know how, after our last meet-
ing, I stand in your estimation, but I am ready to own
that if you would only suffer yourself to be half as good
as your nature had intended you and your faculties might
make you, you would be conferring a great honour on
being the friend of yours truly,
. "JOSEPH LOYD."
“What a cant these fellows acquire !” said Calvert as
he read the letter and threw it from him. “What mock
humility! what downright and palpable pretension to su-
periority through every line of it ! The sum of it all being, I
can't deny that you are cleverer, stronger, more active, and
more manly than me; but, somehow, I don't exactly see why
or, how, but I'm your better! Well, I'll write an answer
to this one of these days, and such an answer as I flatter
myself he'll not read aloud to the company who sit round

65
the fire at the vicarage. And so, Mademoiselie Florence,
this was your anxiety, and this the reason for all that
interest about our quarrel which I was silly enough to
ascribe to â feeling for myself. How invariably it is so !
How certain it is that a woman, the weakest, the least
experienced, the most commonplace, is more than a
match in astuteness for a man, in a question where
her affections are concerned. The feminine nature has
strange contradictions. They can summon the courage of
a tigress to defend their young, and the spirit of a Machia-
velli to protect a lover. She must have had some mis-
giving, however, that, to prefer a fellow like this to me
would be felt by me as an outrage. And then the cunning
stroke of implying that her sister was not indisposed to
listen to me. The perfidy of that !”
Several days after Loyd's departure, Calvert was loung-
ing near the lake, when he jumped up, exclaiming, “Here
comes the postman! I see he makes a sign to me. What
can this be about? Surely, my attached friend has not
written to me again. No, this is a hand that I do not
recognise. Let us see what it contains." He opened
and read as follows:
“Sir,--I have received your letter. None but a scoun-
drel could have written it! As all prospect of connexion
with your family is now over, you cannot have a pretext
for not affording me such a satisfaction as, had you been
a gentleman in feeling as you are in station, it would
never have been necessary for me to demand from you.
I leave this, to-morrow, for the continent, and will be at
Basle by Monday next. I will remain there for a week
at your orders, and hope that there may be no difficulty
to their speedy fulfilment.
“I am, your obedient and faithful servant,
“WENTWORTH GORDON GRAHAM."

“The style is better than yours, Master Loyd, just
because it means something. The man is in an honest
passion and wants a fight. The other fellow was angry,
and begged me not to notice it. And so, Sophy, I have
spoiled the wedding favours, and scattered the brides-
maids! What a heavy lesson for an impertinent note.
Poor thing! why did she trust herself with a pen? Why
did she not know that the most fatal of all bottles is the
ink bottle ? Precious rage old Uncle Geoffrey must be
in. I'd like to have one peep at the general discomfiture
—the deserted dinner-table, and the empty drawing-room.
They deserve it all! they banished me, and much good
have they got of it. Well, Mr. Wentworth Gordon Gra-
ham must have his wicked way. The only difficulty will be
to find what is so absurdly misnamed as a friend. I must
have a friend ; I'll run up to Milan and search the hotels :
I'll surely find some one who will like the cheap heroism
of seeing another man shot at. This is the season when all
the fellows who have no money for Baden come across
the Alps. I'm certain to chance upon one to suit me.”
Having despatched a short note, very politely worded,
to Mr. Graham, to the post office, Basle, he ordered a
carriage, and set out for Milan.
The city was in full festivity when he arrived, over-
joyed at its new-born independence, and proud of the
presence of its king. The streets were crowded with a
holiday population, and from all the balconies and win-
dows hung costly tapestries, or gay coloured carpets.
Military music resounded on all sides, and so dense was
the throng of people and carriages, that Calvert could
only proceed at a walking pace, none feeling any especial
care to make way for a dusty traveller, seated in one of
the commonest of country conveyances.
As he moved slowly and with difficulty forwards, lai

suddenly heard his name called; he looked up, and saw
a well known face, that of a brother officer, who had left
India on a sick leave along with himself.
“I say, old fellow !” cried Barnard, “this is your
ground ; draw into that large gate to your right, and come
up here."
In a few seconds, Calvert, escorted by a waiter, was
shown to his friend's apartment.
“I never dreamed of meeting you here, Calvert.”
“Nor I of finding you lodged so sumptuously,” said
Calvert, as his eyes ranged over the splendid room,
whose massive hangings of silk, and richly gilt ceiling,
gave that air of a palace one so often sees in Italian
hotels.
“ Luck, Sir, luck. I'm married, and got a pot of money
with my wife.” He dropped his voice to a whisper,
while, with a gesture of his thumb towards an adjoining
room, he notioned his friend to be cautious.
“Who was she?"
“Nobody; that is, not anyone you ever heard of.
Stockport people, called Reppingham. The father, a
great railway contractor, vulgar old dog-begun as a
navvy—with one daughter, who is to inherit, they say, a
quarter of a million; but, up to this, we've only an allow-
ance—two thousand a year. The old fellow, however,
lives with us—a horrible nuisance.” This speech, given
in short, abrupt whispers, was uttered with many signs to
indicate that the respected father-in-law was in the vicinity.
• Now, of yourself, what's your news? What have you
done last, eh?”
“Nothing very remarkable. I have been vegetating
on a lake in the north of Italy, trying to live for five
shillings a day, and spending three more in brandy, to
give me courage to do it."

“No, my leave goes to the fifteenth of October."
“Not a bit of it; we got our leave on the saine day,
passed the Board the same day, and for exactly the cama
time. My leave expired on the tenth of August. 12

“Do so. Let me see it."
Barnard opened his desk, and quickly found the paper
he sought for. It was precisely as Barnard said. The
Board of Calcutta had confirmed the regimental recom-
mendation, and granted a two-years' leave, which
ended on the tenth of August.
“Never mind, man,” said Barnard ; "get back to
London as hard as you can, furbish up some sick cera
tificate to say that you were unable to quit your bed "
“That is not so easy as you imagine; I have a little
affair in hand, which may end in more publicity than I
have any fancy for.” And he told him of his approach.

“What was the quarrel about?” asked Barnard.
“A jealousy; he was going to marry a little cousin I
used to flirt with, and we got to words about it. In fact,
it is what Sir Lucius would call a very pretty quarrel,
and there's nothing to be done but finish it. You'll stand
by me, won't you ?”
“I don't see how I can. Old Rep, our governor,
never leaves me. I'm obliged to report myself about
four times a day."
“But you know that can never go on. You necdu't
be told by me that no man can continue such a system of
slavery, nor is there anything could reconipense to

Start at once-to-day. Just say, “I'll have to show
Calvert the lions; he'll want to hunt up galleries,' and
such-like.”
“Hush ! here comes my wife. Fanny, let me present
to you one of my oldest friends, Calvert. It's a name
you have often heard from me."
The young lady—she was not more than twenty-was
pleasing-looking and well mannered. Indeed, Calvert
was amazed to see her so unlike what he expected; she
was neither pretentious nor shy; and, had his friend not
gone into the question of pedigree, was there anything to
mark a class in life other than his own. While they
talked together they were joined by her father, who,
however, more than realised the sketch drawn by Bar-
nard.
He was a morose, down-looking old fellow, with a
furtive expression, and a manner of distrust about him
that showed itself in various ways. From the first, though
Calvert set vigorously to work to win his favour, he
looked with a sort of misgiving at him. He spoke very
little, but in that little there were no courtesies wasted ;
and when Barnard whispered, “You had better ask hiin
to dine with us, the invitation will come better from
you!" the reply was, “I won't; do you hear that? I
won't."
“But he's an old brother-officer of mine, Sir; we served
several years together.”
“The worse company yours, then."
I say, Calvert,” cried Barnard, aloud, “I must give
you a peep at our gay doings here. I'll take you a
drive round the town, and out of the Porta Orien.

“We'll dine without you, that's all !” said the old
man ; while, taking his daughter's hand, he led her out of
the room.
“I say, Bob, I'd not change with you, even for the
difference,” said Calvert.
,“I never saw him so bad before," said the other, sheep-
ishly.
“Because you never tried him! Hitherto you have
been a spaniel, getting kicked and cuffed, and rather
liking it; but, now that the sight of an old friend has
rallied you to a faint semblance of your former self, you
are shocked and horrified. You made a bad start, Bob;
that was the mistake. You ought to have begun by
making him feel the immeasurable distance there lay
between him and a gentleman; not only in dress, lan-
guage, and behaviour, but in every sentiment and feeling.
Having done this, he would have tacitly submitted to
ways that were not his own, by conceding that they might
be those of a class he had never belonged to. You might,
in short, have ruled him quietly and constitutionally.
Now you have nothing for it but one thing."
“Which is——"
“A revolution ! Yes, you must overthrow the whole
government, and build up another out of the smash.

“She'll stand by her husband. Though, probably,
she'll have you 'up' for a little private discipline after-
wards. Come, don't lose time. I want to do my cathe-
dral, and my gallery, and my other curiosities in one
day, for I have some matters to settle at Orto before I

of the sort here, where they play ? "

“There is a place they call the Gettone, but I've never
been there but once.”
“Well, we'll finish there this evening; for I want to
win a little money, to pay my journey.”
“If I can help you "
“No, no. Not to be thought of. I've got some fifty
Naps by me—tame elephants—that are sure to entrap
others. You must come with me to Basle, Bob. You
can't desert me in such a crisis,” said Calvert, as they
left the inn together.
“We'll see. I'll think over it. The difficulty will
be "
“The impossibility is worse than a difficulty; and that
is what I shall have to face if you abandon me. Why,
only think of it for a moment. Here I am, jilted, out of
the army—for I know I shall lose my commission—with-
out a guinea ; you'd not surely wish me to say, without a
friend! If it were not that it would be so selfish, I'd say
the step will be the making of you. You'll have that old
bear so civilised on your return, you'll not know him.”
“Do you really think so ?”
“I know it. He'll see at once that you'll not stand
this sort of bullying. That if you did, your friends
would not stand it. We shan't be away above four days,
and those four days will give him a fright he'll never
forget."
“ I'll think over it.”
“No. You'll do it—that's better ; and I'll promise
you—if Mr. Graham does not enter a fatal objection-
to come back with you and stand to you through your
troubles.”
Calvert had that about him in his strong will, his re-
solution, and his readiness at reply, which exercised no
mean despotism over the fellows of his own age. And it

was only they who disliked and avoided him who ever
resisted him. Barnard was an easy victim, and before the
day drew to its close, he had got to believe that it was
by a rare stroke of fortune Calvert had come to Milan
come to rescue him from the “most degrading sort
of bondage a good fellow could possibly fall into.”
They dined splendidly, and sent to engage a box at the
Opera; but the hours passed so pleasantly over their
dinner, that they forgot all about it, and only reached the
theatre a few minutes before it closed.
“ Now for the—what do you call the place ?” cried
Calvert.
“The Gettone."
“That's it. I'm eager to measure my luck against
these Milanais. They say, besides, no fellow has such a
vein as when his life is threatened ; and I remember my-
self, when I had the yellow fever at Galle, I passed
twenty-one times at écarté, all because I was given
over!"
“ What a fellow you are, Calvert !” said the other,
with a weak man's admiration for whatever was great,
even in infamy.
“ You'll see how I'll clear them out. But what have I
done with my purse ? Left it on my dressing table. I
suppose they are honest in the hotel ? "
“Of course they are. It's all safe; and I've more
money about me than you want. Old Rep handed me
three thousand francs this morning to pay the bill, and
when I saw you, I forgot all about it."
“ Another element of luck,” cried Calvert, joyously.
“The money that does not belong to a man always wins.
Why, there's five thousand francs here," said Calvert, as
he counted over the notes.
"Two of them are Fanny's. She got her quarter's

allowance yesterday. Stingy, isn't it? Only three
hundrel a year."
“It's downright disgraceful. She ought to have eight
at the very least; but wait till we come back from Basle.
You'll not believe what a change I'll work in that old
fellow, when I take him in hand."
By this time they had reached the Gettone, and, after
a brief colloquy, were suffered to pass up stairs and enter
the rooms.
“Oh, it's faro they play; my own game," whispered
Calvert. “I was afraid the fellows might have indulged
in some of their own confounded things, which no for-
eigner can compete in. At faro I fear none."
While Barnard joined a group of persons round a
roulette-table, where fashionably-dressed women adven-
tured their franc pieces along with men clad in the most
humble mode, Calvert took his place among the faro
players. The boldness of his play, and the reckless
way he adventured his money, could not conceal from
their practised acuteness that he was master of the game,
and they watched him attentively.
“I think I have nearly cleaned them out, Bob,” cried
he to his friend, as he pointed to a heap of gold and
silver, which lay promiscuously piled up before him.
“I suppose you must give them their revenge ?"
whispered the other, “if they wish for it.”
“Nothing of the kind. Ai a public table, a winner
rises when he pleases. If I continue to sit here now, it
is because that old fellow yonder has got a rouleau in
his pocket which he cannot persuade himself to break.
See, he has taken it out: for the fourth time, this is.
I wonder can he screw up his courage to risk it. Yes !
he has! There go ten pieces on the queen. Go back

disturb my gaine. I must have that fellow's rouleau
before I leave. Go back, and I'll not tell your wife.”
It was in something less than an hour after this that
Barnard felt a hand laid on his shoulder, and looking up,
saw Calvert standing over him. “Well, it took you
some time to finish that old fellow, Calvert !”
“He finished me, which was worse. Have you got a
cigar?”
“Do you mean that you lost all your winnings ?”
“Yes, and your five thousand francs besides, not to
speak of a borrowed thousand from someone I have given
my card to. A bore, isn't it?”
“It's more than a bore—it's a bad business. I don't
know how I'll settle it with the landlord.”
“Give him a bill, he'll never be troublesome : and, as
to your wife's money, tell her frankly you lost it at play.
Isn't that the best way, Madame?” said he, addressing a
young and pretty woman at his side. “I am advising
ney friend to be honest with his wife, and confess that he
spent his money in very pleasant company. Come along
out of this stuffy place. Let us have a walk in the fresh
cool air, and a cigar, if you have one. I often wonder,”
said he, as they gained the street,“ how the fellows who
write books and want to get up sensation scenes, don't
come and do something of this sort. There's a marvel-
lous degree of stimulant in being cleaned out, not only of
one's own cash, but of one's credit ; and by credit I
mean it in the French sense, which says, 'Le crédit
est l'argent des autres.”
“I wish you had not lost that money," muttered the
other.
“So do I. I have combativeness very strong, and I
hate being beaten by anyone in anything."
“ I'm thinking of the money !" said the other, doggedly.

“ Naturally, for it was yours. ''Twas mine, 'tis his,' as
Hamlet has it. Great fellow, Hamlet! I don't suppose
that anyone ever drew a character wherein Gentleman
was so distinctly painted as Hamlet. He combined all
the grandest ideas of his class with a certain 'disinvoltura'
-a sort of high bred levity—that relieved his sternness,
and made him much better company than such fellows as
Laertes and Horatio."
“When you saw luck turning, why didn't you leave
off ?”
“Why not ask why the luck turned before I left off ?
That would be the really philosophic inquiry. Isn't it
chilly ?"
“I'm not cold, but I'm greatly provoked.”
“So am I for you; for I haven't got enough to repay
you, but trust me to arrange the matter in the morning.
The landlord will see the thing with the eyes of his call-
ing: he'll soon perceive that the son-in-law of a man who
travels with two carriages, and can't speak one word of
French, is one to be trusted. I mean him to cash a bill
for us before I leave. Old Rep's white hat and brown
spencer are guarantees for fifty thousand francs in any
city of Europe. There's a solvent vulgarity in the very
creak of his shoes.”
“Oh! he's not a very distinguished-looking person, cer.
tainly,” said Barnard, who now resented the liberty he
had himself led the way to.
“There I differ with you ; I call him eminently distin.
guished, and I'd rather be able to come 'that cravat tie,
and have the pattern of the dark-green waistcoat with the
red spots, than I'd have—what shall I say?-all the crisp
bank paper I lost awhile ago. You are not going in,
surely ?" cried he, as the other rang violently at the
hotel.

“I want to get in.”
“Here comes the fellow at last; how disgusted he'l
be to find there's not a five-franc piece between us.”
Scarcely was the door opened than Barnard passed in
ind left him without even a good-night.

CHAPTER IX.
ON THE ROAD.
JALVERT'S first care as he entered his room
was to ascertain if his purse was there. It
A was all safe and untouched. He next lit a
cigar, and opening his window, leaned out to smoke. It
was a glorious autumn night, still, starry and cloudless.
Had anyone from the street beneath seen him there, he
might have said, “There is some wearied man of brain-
labour, taking his hour of tranquil thought before he be-
takes himself to rest; or he is one of those contemplative
natures who loves to be free to commune with his own
heart in the silence of a calm night.” He looked like
this, and perhaps—who knows if he were not nearer it
than we wot of ?
It was nigh daybreak before he lay down to sleep.
Nor had he been fully an hour in slumber when he was
awoke, and found Barnard, dressed in a morning gown
and slippers, standing beside his bed.
“I say, Calvert, rub your eyes and listen to me. Are
you awake ?"
“Not very perfectly; but quite enough for anything
you can have to say. What is it?"
“I am so fretted about that money."
“Why you told me that last night,” said Calvert, ad-
dressing himself, as it were, again to sleep.
“Oh, it's all very fine and ycry philosophic to be in

different about another man's 'tin;' but I tell you I don't
know what to do, what to say about it. I'm not six
weeks married, and it's rather early to come to rows and
altercations with a father-in-law.”
“Address him to me. Say • Go to Calvert-he'll talk
to you.' Do that like a good fellow and go to bed. Good
night."
“I'll not stand this sort of thing, Calvert. I'm no
going to lose my money and be laughed at too ! "
“You'll not stand what?” cried Calvert, sitting up in
bed, and looking now thoroughly awake.
“I mean," said the other, doggedly, "you have got me
into a confounded scrape, and you are bound to get me
out of it.”
“That is speaking like a man of sense. It is what I
intend to do; but can't we sleep over it first ? I want
what the old ladies call my natural rest.'”
“There's no time for that. The old governor is always
pottering about by six o'clock, and it's just as likely, as
the landlord talks English, he'll be down by way of
gossiping with him, and ask if the bill is settled.”
“What an old beast he must be. I wonder you could
have married into such a vulgar set."
“If you have nothing to say but abuse of my con-
nections, I am not going to waste any more time here."
“ There, that's a dear fellow; go to bed now, and call
me somewhere towards four in the afternoon.”
“This is rather more than a joke.”
“ To be sure it is, man; it is dead sleepiness. Good-
night.”
“I see you have found your purse—how much had
you in it?"
“Count it, if you're curious,” said Calvert, drowsily.
“Fifty-four Napoleons and a half,” said the other,

slowly. "Look ye, Calvert, I'm going to impound this.
It's a sorry instalment, but, as far as it goes— "
“Take it, old fellow, and leave me quiet.”
“One word more, Calvert,” said Barnard, seriously.
I cannot muster courage to meet old Rep this morning,
and if you like to start at once and settle this affair you
have in Switzerland, I'm ready, but it must be done in-
stanter.”
“ All right; I shall be ready within an hour. Tell the
porter to send my bath up at once, and order coffee by
the time you'll be dressed."
There was very little trace of sleep about Calvert's face
now, as, springing from his bed, he prepared for the road.
With such despatch, indeed, did he proceed, that he
was already in the coffee-room before his friend had
descended.
“Shall we say anything to the landlord before we start,
Calvert ?" whispered he.
“Of course; send Signor Angelo, or Antonio, or what-
ever his name, here. The padrone, I mean," said he to
the waiter.
“He is called Luigi Filippo, Sir," said the man in-
dignantly.
“A capital name for a rogue. Let us have him here."
A very burly consequential sort of man, marvellously
got up as to beard, moustaches, and watch-chain, entered
and bowed.
“Signor Luigi Filippo,” said Calvert,“ my friend here
--the son of that immensely wealthy mi Lordo up stairs
-is in a bit of scrape; he had an altercation last night
with a fellow we take to be an Austrian spy.”
The host spat out, and frowned ferociously.
“Just so; a dog of a Croat, I suspect," went on
Calvert; "at all events, he must put a bullet in him, and

to do so, must get over the frontier beyond Como; we
want therefore a little money from you, and your secrecy,
till this blows over."
The host bowed, and pursed up his lips like one who
would like a little time for reflection, and at last said,
“How much money, Signor ?”.
“What do you say, Bob? will a hundred Naps do, or
eighty ?"
“Fifty; fifty are quite enough,” cried Barnard.
“On a circular note, of course, Signor?" asked the
host.
“No, a draft at six days on my friend's father; mi
Lordo means to pass a month here.”
"I don't think I'll do that, Calvert,” whispered Barnard;
but the other stopped him at once with “ Be quiet; leave
this to me."
“ Though payable at sight, Signor Luigi, we shall ask
you to hold it over for five or six days, because we hope
possibly to be back here before Saturday, and if so, we'll
settle this ourselves.”
“It shall be done, gentlemen," said the host. “I'UI
go and draw out the bills, and you shall have the money
immediately."
“How I touched the fellow's patriotism, Bob. It was
the Austrian dodge stood us in stead, there. I know that
. I have jeopardised your esteem for me by the loss of that
money last night; but do confess that this was a clever
hit of mine."
“It's a bad business from beginning to end !" was how-
ever all that he could obtain from Barnard.
“ Narrow-minded dog! he won't see any genius in a
man that owes him five shillings.”
“I wish it was only five shillings.”
“What an ignoble confession! It means this, that

your friendship depends on the rate of exchanges, and
that when gold rises - But here comes Luigi Filippo.
Now, no squeamishness, but write your name firmly.
* Cut boldly,' said the auger, "and he clit it through.'
Don't you remember that classic anecdote in your Roman
history?"
It is a strange fact that the spirit of raillery, which to a
dull man is, at first, but a source of irritation and fretful-
ness, will, when persevered in, become at last one of
the most complete despotisms. He dreads it as a weapon
which he cannot defend himself against ; and he comes to
regard it as an evidence of superiority and power.
Barnard saw the dominion that the other exercised over
him, but could not resist it.
“Where to now ?” asked he, as they whirled rapidly
along the road towards Monza.
“First of all, to Orta. There is an English family I
want to see. Two prettier girls you can't imaginea-not
that the news has any interest for you, poor caged mouse
that you are --but I am in love with one of them. I for-
get which, but I believe it's the one that won't have
me.”
“She's right,” said Barnard, with a half smile.
“Well, I half suspect she is. I could be a charming
lover, but I fear I'd make only a sorry husband. My
qualities are too brilliant for every-day use. It is your
dreary fellows, with a tiresome monotony of nature, do
best in that melancholy mill they call marriage. You,
ior instance, ought to be a model "mari.'”
“You are not disposed to give me the chance, I think,”
said Barnard, peevishly.
* On the contrary, I am preparing you most carefully
for your career. Conjugal life is a reformatory. You
must coine to it as a penitent. Now I'll teach vou the

first part of your lesson; your wife shall supply the
second."
“I'd relish this much better if — "
“I had not lost that money, you were going to say.
Out with it, man. When a fellow chances upon a witty
thing, he has a right to repeat it; besides, you have reason
on your side. A loser is always wrong. But after all, Bob,
whether the game be war, or marriage, or a horse-race,
one's skill has very little to say to it. Make the wisest
combinations that ever were fashioned, and you'll lose
sometimes. Draw your card at hazard, and you'll win.
If you only saw the fellow that beat me tother day in a
girl's affections—as dreary a dog as ever you met in your
life, without manliness, without 'go' in him—and yet he
wasn't a curate. I know you suspect he was a curate."
“If you come through this affair all right, what do you
intend to turn to, Calvert?” said the other, who really
felt a sort of interest in his fortunes.
“I have thought of several things : the Church-the
Colonies—Patent Fuel-Marriage—Turkish Baths, and a
Sympathy Society for Suffering Nationalities, with a limited
liability to all who subscribe fifty pounds and upwards.”
“But, seriously, have you any plans ?”
“ Ten thousand plans! I have plans enough to ruin
all Threadneedle Street; but what use are plans ? What's
the good of an architect in a land were there are no
bricks, no mortar, and no timber? When I've shot
Graham, I've a plan how to make my escape out of
Switzerland; but, beyond that, nothing ; not one step, I
promise you. See, yonder is Monte Rosa; how grand he
looks in the still calm air of the morning. What a gen-
tieman a mountain is ! how independent of the changeful
fortunes of the plains, where grass succeeds tillage, and
what is barley to-day, may be a' brick-field to-morrow;

83
but the mountain is ever the same-proud and cold if
you will, but standing above all the accidents of con-
dition, and asserting itself by qualities which are not
money-getting. I'd like to live in a land of mountains, if
it were not for the snobs that come to climb them.”
“But why should they be snobs ?”
“I don't know ; perhaps the mountains like it. There,
look yonder, our road leads along that ledge till we reach
Chiasso, about twelve miles off ; do you think you can
jast that long without breakfast? There, there, don't
make that pitiful face ; you shall have your beefsteak,
and your chocolate, and your eggs, and all the other
claims of your Anglo-Saxon nature, whose birthright it is
to growl for every twenty-four hours, and 'grub' every
two."
They gained the little inn at Orta by the evening, and
learned, as Calvert expected, that nothing had changed
in his absence-indeed what was there to change-50
long as the family at the villa remained in the cottage.
All was to Calvert as he left it.
. Apologising to his friend for a brief absence, he took
boat and crossed the lake. It was just as they had sat
down to tea that he entered the drawing-room.
If there was some constraint in the reception of him,
there was that amount of surprise at his appearance that
half masked it. “You have been away, Mr. Calvert ? ”
asked Miss Grainger.
“Yes,” said he, carelessly, “ I got a rambling fit on me,
and finding that Loyd had started for England, I grew
fidgety at being alone, so I went up to Milan, saw
churches and galleries, and the last act of a ballet; but,
like a country mouse, got home-sick for the hard peas
and the hollow tree, and hurried back again."
After some careless talk of commonplaces he managed

at last to secure the chair beside Florence's sofa, and ai.
fected to take an interest in some work she was engayed
at. “I have been anxious to see you and speak to you,
Florry," said he, in a low tone, not audible by the others.
“I had a letter from Loyd, written just before he left.
He has told me everything."
She only bent down her head more deeply over her
work, but did not speak.
“Yes; he was more candid than you," continued he.
“He said you were engaged—that is—that you had
owned to him that you liked him, and that when the
consent he hoped for would be obtained, you would be
married.”
“How came he to write this to you ?” said she, with a
slight tremor in her voice.
“In this wise,” said he, calmly. “He felt that he
owed me an apology for something that had occurred
between us on that morning; and, when making his ex-
cuses, he deemed he could give no better proof of frank-
ness than by this avowal. It was, besides, an act of fair-
ness towards one who, trusting to his own false light,
might have been lured to delusive hopes.”
“ Perhaps so," said she, coldly.
“ It was very right of him, very proper.”
She nodded.
* It was more-it was generous."
* He is generous," said she, warmly.
“He had need be."
“How do you mean, that he had need be?" asked she,
eagerly.
“ I mean this--that he will require every gift he has,
and every grace, to outbalance the affection which I bear
you - which I shall never cease to bear you. Yo!
prefer him. Now, you may regard me how you will

-I will not consent to believe myself beaten. Yes,
Florence, I know not only that I love you more
than he does, but I love you with a love he is incapable
of. feeling. I do not wish to say one word in his dis-
praise, least of all to you, in whose favour I want to stand
well; but I wish you—and it is no unfair request—to
prove the affection of the two men who solicit your
love."
“I am satisfied with his."
“You may be satisfied with the version your own
imagination renders of it. You may be satisfied with the
picture you have coloured for yourself; but I want you
to be just to yourself, and just to me. Now if I can
show you in his own handwriting—the ink only dried on
the paper a day ago—a letter from him to me, in which
he asks my pardon in terms so abject as never were
wrung from any man, except under the pressure of a
personal fear?"
“ You say this to outrage me. Aunt Grainger,” cried
she, in a voice almost a scream, “listen to what this gen-
tleman has had the temerity to tell me. Repeat it now,
Sir, if you dare."
“What is this, Mr. Calvert? You have not surely
presumed - "
“I have simply presumed, Madam, to place my pre
tensions in rivalry with Mr. Loyd's. I have been offering
to your niece the half of a very humble fortune, with a
name not altogether ignoble."
“Oh dear, Mr. Calvert !” cried the old lady, “I never
suspected this. I'm sure my niece is aware of the great
honour we all feel—at least I do most sensibly—that, if
she was not already engaged- Are you ill, dearest ?
Oh, she has fainted. Leave us, Mr. Calvert. Send Maria
here. Milly, some water immediately."

For more than an hour Calvert walked the little grass
plot before the door, and no tidings came to him frori
those within. To a momentary bustle and confusion, a
calm succeeded-lights flitted here and there through the
cottage. He fancied he heard something like sobbing;
and then all was still and silent.
“Are you there, Mr. Calvert ? ” cried Milly, at last, as
she moved out into the dark night air. “She is better
now-much better. She seems inclined to sleep, and we
have left her.”
“You know how it came on ?" asked he in a whisper.
“ You know what brought it about ?"
“No; nothing of it.”
“It was a letter that I showed her—a letter of Loyd's
to myself-conceived in such terms as no man of, I will
not say of spirit, but a common pretension to the sense of
gentleman, could write. Wait a moment, don't be angry
with me till you hear me out. We had quarrelled in the
morning. It was a serious quarrel, on a very serious
question. I thought, of course, that all young men, at
least, regard these things in the same way. Well, he did
not. I have no need to say more; he did not, and con-
sequently nothing could come of it. At all events, I
deemed that the man who could not face an adversary
had no right to brave a rival, and so I intimated
to him. For the second time he differed with me,
and dared in my own presence to prosecute attentions
which I had ordered him to abandon. This was bad
enough, but there was worse to come, for, on my return
nome from this, I found a letter from him in the most
abject terms; asking my pardon-for what ?—for my hav-
ing insulted him, and begging me, in words of shameful
humility, to let him follow up his courtship, and, if he
çould, secure the hand of your sister, Now she might,

or might no. accept my offer. I am not coxcomb enough
to suppose I must succeed simply because I wish success;
but, putting myself completely out of the question, could
I suffer a girl I deemed worthy of my love, and whom I
desired to make my wife, to fall to the lot of one so base
as this? I ask you, was there any other course open to
me than to show her the letter? Perhaps it was rash;
perhaps I ought to have shown it first of all to Miss
Grainger. I can't decide this point. It is too subtle for
me. I only know that what I did I should do again, no
matter what the consequences might be.”
“And this letter, has she got it still ?” asked Milly.
“No, neither she nor any other will ever read it now.
I have torn it to atoms. The wind has carried the last
fragment at this moment over the lake.”
“Oh dear; what misery all this is,” cried the girl in an
accent of deep affliction. “If you knew how she is
attached— ” Then suddenly checking the harsh in-
discretion of her words, she added, “I am sure you did
all for the best, Mr. Calvert. I must go back now. You'll
come and see us, or perhaps you'll let me write to you,
to-morrow."
“I have to say good-bye, now,” said he, sadly. “I may
sce you all again within a week. It may be this is a
good-bye for ever.”
He kissed her hand as he spoke, and turned to the
lake, where his boat was lying.
“How amazed she'll be to hear that she saw a letter-
read it-held it in her hands," muttered he, “but I'll
stake my life she'll never doubt the fact when it is told to
her by those who believe it.”
“You seem to be in rare spirits," said Barnard when
Calvert returned to the inn. “Have you proposed and
been accepted ?"

“Not exactly,” said the other, smiling, “but I have
had a charming evening; one of those fleeting moments
of that ‘vie de famille' Balzac tells us are worth all our
wild and youthful excesses."
“Yes!” replied Barnard, scoffingly; "domesticity
would seem to be your forte. Heaven help your wife,
say I, if you ever have one."
“You don't seem to be aware how you disparage con-
jugal life, my good friend, when you speak of it as a thing
in which men of your stamp are the ornaments. It would
be a sorry institution if its best requirements were a
dreary temperament and a disposition that mistakes
moodiness for morality.”
“Good-night; I have had enough," said the other, and
eft the room.
“What a pity to leave such a glorious spot on such
a morning,” said Calvert, as he stood waiting while the
post-horses were being harnessed. “If we had but been
good boys, as we might have been—that is, if you had not
fallen into matrimony, and I into a quarrel—we should
have such a day's fishing here! Yonder, where you see
the lemon-trees hanging over the rock, in the pool under-
neath there are some twelve and fourteen 'pounders,' as
strong as a good-size pike; and then we'd have grilled
them under the chestnut-trees, and talked away, as we've
done scores of times, of the great figure we were to make
-I don't know when or how, but some time and in some
wise-in the world; astonishing all our relations, and
putting to utter shame and confusion that private tutor at
Dorking who would persist in auguring the very worst of us."
“Is that the bill that you are tearing up? Let me see
it. What does he charge for that Grignolino wine and
those bad cigars ?" broke in Barnard.

“What do I know or care ?” said Calvert, with a
saucy laugh. “If you possessed a schoolboy's money-box
with a slit in it to hold your savings, there would be
some sense in looking after the five-franc pieces you
could rescue from a cheating landlord, and add to your
store; but when you know in your heart that you are
never the richer nor the better of the small economies
that are only realised at the risk of an apoplexy and some
very profane expressions, my notion is, never mind them
-never fret about them.”
“You talk like a millionaire,” said the other con-
temptuously.
“It is all the resemblance that exists between us, Bob;
not, however, that I believe Baron Rothschild himself
could moralise over the insufficiency of wealth to happi-
ness as I could. Here comes our team, and I must say
a sorrier set of screws never tugged in a rope harness.
Get in first. I like to show all respect to the man who
pays. I say, my good fellow," cried he to the postilion,
“drive your very best, for mi Lordo here is immensely
rich, and would just as soon give you five gold Marengos
as five francs.”
“What was it you said to him ?” asked Barnard, as
they started at a gallop.
“I said he must not spare his cattle, for we were
running away from our creditors.”
“How could you—_"
“How could I? What nonsense, man ! besides, I
wanted the fellow to take an interest in us, and, you see,
so he has. Old Johnson was right; there are few
pleasures more exhilarating than being whirled along a
good road at the top speed of post-horses."
“ I suppose you saw that girl you are in love with ; "
said Barnard after a pause.

“Yes; two of them. Each of the syrens has got a
lien upon my heart, and I really can't say which of them
holds the preference shares.'"
“Is there money?"
“Not what a great Croesus like yourself would call
money, but still enough for a grand operation' at Hom-
burg, or a sheep-farming exploit in Queensland."
“ You're more 'up' to the first than the last.”
“All wrong! Games of chance are to fellows like you,
who must accept Fortune as they find her. Men of my
stamp mould destiny."
“Well, I don't know. So long as I have known you,
you've never been out of one scrape without being half
way into another."
“And yet there are fellows who pay dearer for their
successes than ever I have done for my failures."
“How so? What do they do ?”
“They marry! Ay, Bob, they marry rich wives, but
without any power to touch the money, just as a child
gets a sovereign at Christmas under the condition he is
never to change it.”
“ I must say you are a pleasant fellow to travel with."
“So I am generally reputed, and you're a lucky dog to
catch me “in the vein,' for I don't know when I was in
better spirits than this riorning."

CHAPTER X.
A DAYBREAK BESIDE THE RHINE.
HE day was just breaking over that wide fat
beside the Rhine at Basle, as two men, de-
scending from a carriage on the high road,
took one of the narrow paths which lead through the
fields, walking slowly, and talķing to each other in the
careless tone of easy converse.
“We are early, Barnard, I should say ; fully half an
hour before our time,” said Calvert, as he walked on
first, for the path did not admit of two abreast. What
grand things these great plains are, traversed by a fine
river, and spreading away to a far distant horizon. What
a sense of freedom they inspire; how suggestive they are
of liberty ; don't you feel that ? "
"I think I see them coming," said the other. “I saw
a carriage descend the hill yonder. Is there nothing else
you have to say-nothing that you think of, Harry ? "
“Nothing. If it should be a question of a funeral, Bob,
my funds will show how economically it must be done ;
but even if I had been richer, it is not an occasion I
should like to make costly."
“It was not of that I was thinking. It was of friends
or relations."
“My dear fellow, I have few relatives and no friends.
No man's executorship will ever entail less trouble

it to."
“But these letters — the cause of the present meet.
ing — don't you intend that in case of — in the event
of- "
“My being killed. Go on.”
“That they should be given up to your cousin ?”.
“Nothing of the kind ever occurred to me. In the
first place, I don't mean to be shot; and in the second,
I have not the very remotest intention of releasing the
dear Sophy from those regrets and sorrows which she
ought to feel for my death. Nay, I mean her to mourn
me with a degree of affliction to which anxiety will add
the poignancy.”
“This is not generous, Calvert."
“I'm sure it's not. Why, my dear friend, were I to
detect any such weakness in my character, I'd begin to
fancy I might end by becoming a poltroon.”
“Is that your man—he in the cloak—or the tall one
behind him ?” said Barnard, as he pointed to a group
who came slowly along through a vineyard.
“I cannot say. I never saw Mr. Graham to my know-
ledge. Don't let them be long about the preliminaries,
Bob; the morning is fresh and the ground here somewhat
damp. Agree to all they ask, distance and everything,
only secure that the word be given by you. Remember
that, in the way I've told you."
As Calvert strolled listlessly along towards the river,
Barnard advanced to meet the others, who, to the
number of five, came now forward. Colonel Rochefort,
Mr. Graham's friend, and Barnard were slightly ac-
quainted, and turned aside to talk to each other in con-
fidence.
“ It is scarcely the moment to hope for it, Mr.

Barnard,” said the other, “but I cannot go on without
asking, at least, if there is any peaceful settlement
possible ?"
“I fear not. You told me last night that all re-
traction by your friend of his offensive letter was im.
possible.”
“Utterly so."
“What, then, would you suggest ?”
“ Could not Mr. Calvert be brought to see that it was
he who gave the first offence? That, in writing, as he
did, to a man in my friend's position-2"
“Mere waste of time, colonel, to discuss this ; besides,
I think we have each of us already said all that we could
on this question, and Calvert is very far from being
satisfied with me for having allowed myself to entertain
it. There is really nothing for it but a shot.”
“Yes, Sir; but you seem to forget, if we proceed to
this arbitrament, it is not a mere exchange of fire will
satisfy my friend."
“We are, as regards that, completely at his service;
and if your supply of ammunition be only in proportion
to the number of your followers, you can scarcely be
disappointed.”
The colonel reddened deeply, and in a certain ir-
ritation replied: “One of these gentlemen is a travelling
companion of my friend, whose health is too delicate to
permit him to act for him ; the other is a French officer
of rank, who dined with us yesterday; the third is a
surgeon."
“To us it is a matter of perfect indifference if you
come accompanied by fifty, or five hundred; but let us
lose no more time. I see how I am trying my friend's
patience already. Ten paces, short paces, too," began
Barnard as he took his friend's arm.

“And the word ? "
“I am to give it.”
“All right; and you remember how?”.
“ Yes ! the word is, One—two; at the second you are
to fire.”
“Let me hear you say them.”
“One-two."
“No, no; that's not it. One-two -- sharp; don't
dwell on the interval ; make them like syllables of one
word.”
“One-two."
“Yes, that's it; and remember that you cough
once before you begin. There, don't let them see
us talking together. Give me a shake hands, and leave
me.”
“That man is nervous, or I am much mistaken,” said
Graham's invalid friend to the colonel ; and they both
looked towards Calvert, who with his hat drawn down
over his brows, walked lazily to his ground.
“It is not the reputation he has,” whispered the
colonel. “Be calm, Graham; be as cool as the other
fellow."
The principals were now placed, and the others fell
back on either side, and almost instantaneously, so in-
stantaneously, indeed, that Colonel Rochefort had not
yet ceased to walk, two shots rung out, one distinctly
before the other, and Graham fell.
All ran towards him but Calvert, who, throwing his
pistol at his feet, stood calm and erect. For a few seconds
they bent down over the wounded man, and then
Barnard, hastening back to his friend, whispered,
“Through the chest; it is all over.”
“Dead ?” said the other.
He nodded, and taking his arm, said, “Don't lose a

moment; the Frenchman says you have not an instant to
spare."
For a moment Calvert moved as if going towards the
others, then, as if with a changed purpose, he turned
sharply round and walked towards the high road.
As Calvert was just about to gain the road, Barnard
ran after him, and cried out, “Stop, Calvert, hear what
these men say; they are crying out unfair against us.
They declare- ".
“Are you an ass, Bob?” said the other, angrily.
“Who minds the stupid speech of fellows whose friend is
knocked over?”
“Yes, but I'll hear this out,” cried Barnard.
“You'll do so without me, then, and a cursed fool you
are for your pains. Drive across to the Bavarian frontier,
my man,” said he, giving the postilion a Napoleon, “and
you shall have a couple more if you get there within two
hours."
With all the speed that whip and spur could summon,
the beasts sped along the level road, and Calvert, though
occasionally looking through the small pane in the back
of the carriage to assure himself he was not pursued,
smoked on unceasingly. He might have been a shade
graver than his wont, and preoccupied too, for he took no
notice of the objects on the road, nor replied to the
speeches of the postilion, who, in his self-praise, seemed
to call for some expression of approval.
“ You are a precious fool, Master Barnard, and you
have paid for your folly, or you had been here before
this."-
Such were his uttered thoughts, but it cost him little
regret as he spoke them.
The steam-boat that left Constance for Lindau was
just getting under weigh as he reached the lake, and he

immediately embarked in her, and on the same evening,
gained Austrian territory at Bregenz, to pass the night.
For a day or two, the quietness of this lone and little-
visited spot suited him, and it was near enough to the
Swiss frontier, at the Rhine, to get news from Switzerland.
On the third day, a paragraph in the Basle Zeitung told
him everything. It was, as such things usually are,
totally misrepresented, but there was enough revealed
for him to guess what had occurred. It was headed
“ Terrible Event,” and ran thus :
“At a meeting which took place with pistols, this
morning, between two English lords at the White
Meadows, one fell so fatally wounded that his death
ensued in a few minutes. An instantaneous cry of foul
play amongst his friends led to a fierce and angry alterca-
tion, which ended in a second encounter between the
first principal and the second of the deceased. In this
the former was shot through the throat, the bullet injuring
several large vessels, and lodging, it is supposed, in the
spine. He has been conveyed to the Hôtel Royal, but
no hopes of his recovery are entertained.”
“I suspected what would come of your discussion,
Bob. Had you only been minded to slip away with me,
you'd have been in the enjoyment of a whole skin by this
time. I wonder which of them shot him. I'd take
the odds it was the Frenchman ; he handled the pistols
like a fellow who envied us our pleasant chances. I
suppose I ought to write to Barnard, or to his
people; but it's not an agreeable task, and I'll think
over it.”
He thought over it, and wrote as follows :
" Dear Bob,—I suspect, from a very confused par-
agraph in a stupid newspaper, that you have foughi

“Address, Como."
To this he received no answer when he called at the
post-office, and turned his steps next to Orta. He did
not really know why, but it was, perhaps, with some of
that strange instinct that makes the criminal haunt the
homes of those he has once injured, and means to injure
more. There was, however, one motive which he re-
cognised himself; he wished to know something of those
at the villa ; when they had heard from Loyd, and what?
whether, too, they had heard of his own doings, and in
what way? A fatal duel, followed by another that was
like to prove fatal, was an event sure to provoke news.
paper notice. The names could not escape publicity,
and he was eager to see in what terms they mentioned
his own. He trusted much to the difficulty of getting at
any true version of the affair, and he doubted greatly if
anyone but Graham and himself could have told why they
were to meet at all. Graham's second, Rochefort, evi-
dently knew very little of the affair. At all events,
Graham was no longer there to give his version, while for
the incidents of the duel, who was to speak? All, save
Barnard, who was dying, if not dead, must have taken
flight. The Swiss authorities would soon have arrested
them if within reach. He might therefore reassure him-
self that no statement that he could not at least impugn
could get currency just yet. “I will row over to the old
Grainger”-so he called her "and see what she has
heard of it all."

It was nightfall as he reached the shore, and walked
slowly and anxiously to the house. He had learned at
Orta that they were to leave that part of the world in
another fortnight, but whither for none knew. As he
drew nigh, he determined to have a peep at the interior
before he presented himself. He accordingly opened the
little wicket noiselessly, and passed round through the

THE LIFE AT THE VILLA.
PIHE curtains were undrawn, and the candles were
lighted. All within looked just as he had so
V often seen it. The sick girl lay on her sofa,
with her small spaniel at her feet. Miss Grainger was
working at a table, and Emily sat near her sister, bending
over the end of the sofa, and talking to her. “Let me
see that letter again, Florry,” she said, taking a letter
from the passive fingers of the sick girl. “Yes, he is
sure it must have been Calvert. He says, that though
the Swiss papers give the name Colnart, he is sure it was
Calvert, and you remember his last words here as he went
away that evening ?”.
“Poor fellow !” said Floirnce, “I am sure I have no
right to bear him good will, but I am sorry for him—
really sorry. I suppose, by this time, it is all over?"
“The wound was through the throat, it is said,” said
Miss Grainger. “But how confused the whole story is.
Who is Barnard, and why did Calvert fight to save Bar-
rard's honour?"
“No, aunt. It was to rescue Mr. Graham's, the man
who was about to marry Sophia Calvert.”
“Not at all, Milly. It was Graham who shot Barnard ;
and then poor Calvert, horrified at his friend's fate "
Calvert never waited for more. He saw that there

vras that amount of inistake and misunderstanding, which
required no aid on his part, and now nothing remained but
to present himself suddenly before then as a fugitive from
justice seeking shelter and protection. The rest he was
content to leave to hazard.
A sharp ring at the door-bell was scarcely answered by
the servant, when the man came to the drawing-room
door, and made a sign to Miss Grainger.
“What is it, Giacomo? What do you mean?" she
cried.
“Just one moment, signora ; half a minute here,"
he said.
Well accustomed to the tone of secrecy assumed by
Italians on occasions the least important, Miss Grainger
followed him outside, and there, under the glare of the
hall-lamp, stood Calvert, pale, his hair dishevelled, his
cravat loosened, and his coat-sleeve torn. “Save me!
hide me !” said he, in a low whisper. “Can you—will
you save me?"
She was one not unfitted to meet a sudden change ;
and, although secretly shocked, she rallied quickly, and
led him into a room beside the hall. “I know all,” said
she. “We all knew it was your name.”
“Can you conceal me here for a day-two days at
furthest ?"
" A week, if you need it.”
" And the servant-can he be trusted ?" -
66 To the death. I'll answer for him.”
“How can you keep the secret from the girls ? "
“I need not; they must know everything."
“But Florence; can she-has she forgiven me ?"
“Yes, thoroughly. She scarcely knows about what she
quarrelled with you. She sometirnes fears that stic
wronged you; and Milly defends you always.".

“ You have heard-you know what has happened to
me ?"
“In a fashion : that is, we only know there has been
a duel. We feared you had been wounded ; and, indeed.
we heard severely wounded.”
“The story is too long to tell you now; enough, if I
say it was all about Sophy. You remember Sophy, and a
fellow who was to have married her, and who jilted her,
and not only this but boasted of the injury he had done
her, and the insult he had thrown on us. A friend of
mine, Barnard, a brother officer, heard him—but why go
on with this detail ?—there was a carrel and a challenge,
and it was by merest accident I heard of it, and reached
Basle in time. Of course, I was not going to leave to
Barnard wi. "t of right belonged to me. There were, as
you can imagine, innumerable complications in the
matter. Rochefort, the other man's friend, and a French
fellow, insisted on having a finger in the pie. The end
of it was, I shot Graham and somebody else—I believe
Rochefort-put a bullet into Barnarc?. The Swiss laws
in some cantons are severe, and we only learned too late
that we had fought in the very worst of them ; so I ran, I
don't know how, or in what direction. I lost my head
for a while, and wandered about the Vorarlberg and the
Splugen for a week or two. How I find myself now here
is quite a mystery to me.”
There was a haggard wildness in his look that fully
accorded with all he said, and the old lady felt the mos:
honest pity for his sufferings.
“I don't know if I'm perfectly safe here,” said he,
looking fearfully around him. “Are you sure you can
conceai me, if need be ? "
“Quite sure; have no fear about that. I'll tell
the girls that your safety requires the greatest cau-

tion and secrecy, and you'll see how careful thev
will be.”
“Girls will talk, though,” said he, doubtingly.
“There is the double security here—they have no one
to talk to," she said, with a faint smile.
“Very true. I was forgetting how retired your infe
was here. Now for the next point. What are you to
tell them-I mean, how much are they to know ?”
The old lady looked puzzled; she felt she might easily
have replied, “ If they only know no more than I can tell
them, your secret will certainly be safe;" but, as she
looked at his haggard cheek and feverish eye, she shrunk
from renewing a theme full of distress and suffering.
“Leave it to me to say something—anything which shall
show them that you are in a serious trouble, and require
all their secrecy and sympathy."
• “Yes, that may do—at least for the present. It will
do at least with Emily, who bears me no ill will."
“You wrong Florence if you imagine that she does.
It was only the other day, when, in a letter from Loyd,
she read that you had left the army, she said how sorry
she was you had quitted the career so suited to your
abilities."
“Indeed! I scarce hoped for so much of interest
in me.”
“Oh, she talks continually about you; and always as
of one, who only needs the guidance of some true friend
to be a man of mark and distinction yet."
“It is very good, very kind of her," he said ; and, for
an instant, seemed lost in thought

them for your coming. They'll wonder what has detaineci

can tnuugkits trour her, and suffered her to go without
· word. She was quickly back again, and beckoning
aim to follow her, led the way to the drawing-room.
Scarcely had Calvert passed the doorway, when the
two girls met him, and each taking a hand, conducted
him without a word to a sofa. Indeed, his sickly look,
and the air of downright misery in his countenance, called
for all their sympathy and kindness.
"I have scarcely strength to thank you !” he said to
them, in a faint voice. Though the words were addressed
to both, the glance he gave towards Florence sent the
blood to her pale cheeks, and made her turn away in
some confusion.
“You'll have some tea and rest yourself, and when you
feel once quiet and undisturbed here you'll soon regain
your strength,” said Emily, as she turned towards the
tea-table. While Florence, after a few moments' hesita
tion, seated herself on the sofa beside him.
“Has she told you what has befallen me?” whispered
he to her.
“In part—that is, something of it. As much as she
could in a word or two; but do not speak of it now.”
“If I do not now, Florence, I can never have the
courage again.”
“Then be it so,” she said eagerly. “I am more an-
xious to see you strong and well again, than to hear how
you became wretched and unhappy."
“But if you do not hear the story from myself, Flor-
ence, and if you should hear the tale that others may tell
of me-if you never know how I have been tried and

“Does she grudge me this much of your kind-
ness?"
“No; but-there--here she comes with your tea."
She drew a little table in front of him, and tried to per-
suade him to eat.
“Your sister has just made me a very generous prom-
ise, Emily,” said he. “She has pledged herself—even
without hearing my exculpation—to believe me innocent;
and although I have told her that the charges that others
will make against me may need some refutation on my
part, she says she'll not listen to them. Is not that very
noble—is it not truly generous ?"
“Ii is what I should expect from Florence."
“ And what of Florence's sister ? ” said he, with a half
furtive glance towards her.
“I hope, nothing less generous."
“ Then I am content,” said he, with a faint sigh.
“When a man is as thoroughly ruined as I am, it might
be thought he would be indifferent to opinion in every
shape—and so I am, beyond the four walls of this room;
but here," and he looked at each in turn, “are the arbiters
of my fate; if you will but be to me dear sisters-kind,
compassionate, forgiving sisters-you will do more for this
crushed and wounded heart, than all the sympathy of the
whole world beside.”
“We only ask to be such to you,” cried Florence,
eagerly: “and we feel how proud we could be of such a
brother ; but, above all, do not distress yourself now, by
a theme so painful to touch on. Let the unhappy events
of the last few weeks lie, if not forgotten, at least un-
mentioned, till you are calm and quiet enough to talk
of them as old memories.”
“ Yes! but how can I bear the thought of what others
may say of me-meanwhile ? "

“ Who are these others—we see no one, we go into
no society ? "
“Have you not scores of dear friends, writing by every
post to ask if this atrocious duellist be 'your' Mr.
Calvert, and giving such a narrative, besides, of his
doings, that a galley-slave would shrink from contact
with such a man? Do I not know well how tenderly
people deal with the vices that are not their own? How
severe the miser can be on the spendthrift, and how mer-
cilessly the coward condemns the hot blood that resents
an injury, and how gladly they would involve in shame
the character that would not brook dishonour ? "
"Believe me, we have very few 'dear friends' at all,”
said Florence, smiling, “and not one, no, not a single
one of the stamp you speak of.”
“If you were only to read our humdrum letters,”
chimed in Emily, “you'd see how they never treat of
anything but little domestic details of people who live
as obscurely as ourselves. How Uncle Tom's boy has
got into the Charterhouse; or Mary's baby taken the
chicken-pox.”
“But Loyd writes to you—and not in this strain ?”
“ I suspect Joseph cares little to fill his pages with
what is called news,” said Emily, with a laughing glance
at her sister, who had turned away her head in some
confusion.
" Nor would he be one likely to judge you harshly,"
said Florence, recovering herself. “I believe you have
few friends who rate you more highly than he does."
“It is very generous of him!” said Calvert, haughtily;
and then, catching in the proud glance of Florry's eyes a
daring challenge of his words, he added, in a quieter tone,
“I mean, it is generous of him to overicok how unjust I
have been to him. It is not easy for men so different

to measure each other, and I certainly formed an unfair
estimate of him.”
“Oh! may I tell him that you said so?” cried she,
taking his hand with warmth.
“I mean to do it for myself, dearest sister. It is a
debt I cannot permit another to acquit for me."
“Don't you think you are forgetting our guest's late
fatigues, and what need he has of rest and quietness,
girls ? " said Miss Grainger, coming over to where they
sat.
“I was forgetting everything in my joy, aunt,” cried
Florence. “He is going to write to Joseph like a dear,
dear brother as he is, and we shall all be so happy, and
so united.”
“A brother? Mr. Calvert a brother?” said the old
lady, in consternation at such a liberty with one of that
mighty house, in which she had once lived as an humble
dependant.
“Yes,” cried he. “It is a favour I have begged, and
they have not denied me."
The old lady's face fushed, and pride and shame
glowed together on her cheeks.
“So we must say good-night,” said Calvert, rising;
“but we shall have a long day's talk together, to-morrow.
Who is it that defines an aunt as a creature that always
sends one to bed ?” whispered he to Florence.
“What made you laugh, dear?” said her sister, after
Calvert had left the room.
“I forget—I didn't know I laughed—he is a strange
incomprehensible fellow-sometimes I like hirn greatly,
and sometimes I feel a sort of dread of him that amounts
to terror."
“ If I were Joseph, I should not be quite unconcerned
about that jumbled estimation.”

" He has no need to be. They are unlike in every
way,” said she, gravely; and then, taking up her book,
went on, or affected to go on reading.
“I wish Aurt Grainger would not make so much of him.
It is a sort of adulation that makes our position regard-
ing him perfectly false,” said Emily. “Don't you think
so, dear?”
Florence, however, made no reply, and no more passed
that evening between them.
Few of us have not had occasion to remark the
wondrous change produced in some quiet household,
where the work of domesticity goes on in routine fashion,
by the presence of an agreeable and accomplished guest.
It is not alone that he contributes by qualities of his
own to the common stock of amusement, but that he
excites those around him to efforts, which develop re-
sources they had not, perhaps, felt conscious of pos-
sessing. The necessity, too, of wearing one's company
face, which the presence of a stranger exacts, has more
advantages than many wot of. The small details whose
discussion forms the staple of daily talk-the little house-
hold cares and worries—have to be shelved. One can
scarcely entertain their friends with stories of the cook's
impertinence, or the coachman's neglect, and one has to
see, as they do see, that the restraint of a guest does not
in reality affect the discipline of a household, though it
suppress the debates and arrest the discussion.
It has been often remarked that the custom of appear-
ing in parliament—as it was once observed—in court-
dress, imposed a degree of courtesy and deference in
debate, of which men in wide-awake hats and paletots
are not always observant; and, unquestionably, in the
little cercmonial observances imposed by the stranger's
presence, may be seen the social benefits of a good

breeding not marred by over-familiarity. It was thus
Calvert inade his presence felt at the villa. It was true
he had many companionable qualities, and he had, or at
least affected to have, very wide sympathies. He was
ever ready to read aloud, to row, to walk, to work in the
flower-garden, to sketch, or to copy music, as though each
was an especial pleasure to him. If he was not as high
spirited and light hearted as they once had seen him, it
did not detract from, but rather added to the interest he
excited. He was in misfortune-a calamity not the less
to be compassionated that none could accurately define
it; some dreadful event had occurred, some terrible con-
sequence impended, and each felt the necessity of lighten
ing the load of his sorrow, and helping him to bear his
affliction. They were so glad when they could cheer
him up, and so happy when they saw him take even
a passing pleasure in the pursuits their own days were
spent in.
They had now been long enough in Italy not to feel
depressed by its dreamy and monotonous quietude, but
to feel the inexpressible charm of that soft existence,
begotten of air, and climate, and scenery. They had
arrived at that stage--and it is a stage-in which the
olive is not dusky, nor the mountain arid : when the dry
course of the torrent suggests no wish for water. Life-
mere life—has a sense of luxury about it, unfelt in
northern lands. With an eager joy, therefore, did they
perceive that Calvert seemed to have arrived at the same
sentiment, and the same appreciation as themselves. He
seemed to ask for nothing better than to stroll through
orange groves, or lie under some spreading fig-tree,
drowsily soothed by the song of the vine-dresser, or the
unwearied chirp of the cicala. How much of good there
must be surely in a nature pleased with such tranquil

simple pleasures ! thought they. See how he likes to
watch the children at their play, and with what courtesy
he talked to that old priest. It is clear dissipation may
have damaged, but has not destroyed that fine tempera-
ment-his heart has not lost its power to feel. It was
thus that each thought of him, though there was less of
confidence between the sisters than heretofore.
A very few words will suffice to explain this: When
Florence recovered from the shock Calvert had occa-
sioned her on the memorable night of his visit, she had
nothing but the very vaguest recollection of what had oc-
curred. That some terrible tidings had been told her-
some disastrous news in which Loyd and Calvert were
mixed up: that she had blamed Calvert for rashness or
indiscretion ; that he had either shown a letter he ought
never to have shown, or not produced one which might
have averted a misfortune; and, last of all, that she her-
self had done or said something which a calmer judg-
ment could not justify—all these were in some vague and
shadowy shape before her, and all rendered her anxious
and uneasy. On the other hand, Emily, seeing with
some satisfaction that her sister never recurred to the
events of that unhappy night, gladly availed herself of
this silence to let them sleep undisturbed. She was
greally shocked, it is true, by the picture Calvert's repre-
sentation presented of Loyd. He had never been a great
favourite of her own; she recognised many good and
amiable traits in his nature, but she deemed him gloomy,
depressed, and a dreamer—and a dreamer, above all, she
regarded as unfit to be the husband of Florence, whose ill
health had only tended to exaggerate a painful and in-
aginative disposition. She saw, or fancied she saw, that
Loyd's temperament, calin and gentle though it was,
seemed to depress her sister. His views of life were very

sombre, and no effort ever enabled him to look forward
in a sanguine or hopeful spirit. If, however, to these
feelings an absolute fault of character were to be added
—the want of personal courage-her feelings for him
could no longer be even the qualified esteem she had
hitherto experienced. She also knew that nothing could
be such a shock to Florence, as to believe that the man
she loved was a coward; nor could any station, or
charm, or ability, however great, compensate for such a
defect. As a matter, therefore, for grave after-thought,
but not thoroughly “proven,” she retained this charge in
her mind, nor did she by any accident drop a hint or
a word that could revive the memory of that even-
ing.
As for Miss Grainger, only too happy to see that Flor-
ence seemed to retain no trace of that distressing scene,
she never went back to it, and thus every event of the
night was consigned to silence, if not oblivion. Still,
there grew out of that reserve a degree of estrangement
between the sisters, which each, unconscious of in herself,
could detect in the other. “I think Milly has grown
colder to me of late, aunt. She is not less kind or at-
tentive, but there is a something of constraint about her
I cannot fathom,” would Florence say to her aunt.
While the other whispered, “ I wonder why Florry is so
silent when we are alone together? She that used to
tell me all her thoughts, and speak for hours of what she
hoped and wished, now only alludes to some common-
place topic—the book she has just read, or the walk we
took yesterday.
The distance between them was not the less wide that
each had secretly confided to Calvert her misgivings
about the other. Indeed, it would have been, for girls
60 young and inexperienced in life, strange not to have

occorded him their confidence. He possessed a large
share of that quality which very young people regard as
sagacity. I am not sure that the gift has got a special
name, but we have all of us heard of some one “with
such a good head,” “so safe an adviser,” “such a rare
counsellor in a difficulty," “knowing life and mankind so
well,” and “such an aptitude to take the right road in a
moment of embarrassment.” The phenix is not usually
a man of bright or showy qualities; he is, on the con-
trary, one that the world at large has failed to re-
cognise. If, however, by any chance he should prove to
be smart, ready-witted, and a successful talker, his sway is
a perfect despotism. Such was Calvert; at least such
was he to the eyes of these sisters. Now Emily had con-
fided to him that she thought Loyd totally unworthy of
Florence. His good qualities were undeniable, but he
had few attractive or graceful ones; and then there was
a despondent, depressed tone about him that must prove
deeply injurious to one whose nature required bright
and cheery companionship. Calvert agreed with every
word of this.
Florence, on her side, was, meanwhile, imparting to hiin
that Loyd was not fairly appreciated by her aunt or her
sister. They deemed him very honourable, very truthful,
and very moral, but they did not think highly of his abi-
lities, nor reckon much on his success in life. In fact,
though the words themselves were spared her, they told
her in a hundred modes that “she was throwing herself
away ;” and, strange as it may read, she liked to be told
so, and heard with a sort of triumphant pride that she
was going to make a sacrifice of herself and all her pros-
pects--all for “poor Joseph.” To become the auditor
of this reckoning required more adroitness than the other
case ; but Calvert was equal to it. He saw where 10

differ, where to agree with her. It was a contingency
which admitted of a very dexterous flattery, rather in-
sinuated, however, than openly declared ; and it was thus
he conveyed to her that he took the same view as the
others. He knew Loyd was an excellent fellow, far too
good and too moral for a mere scamp like himself to
estimate. He was certain he would turn out respectable,
esteemed, and all that. He would be sure to be a
churchwarden, and might be a poor-law guardian; and
his wife would be certain to shine in the same brightness
attained by him. Then stopping, he would heave a low,
faint sigh, and turn the conversation to something about
her own attractions or graceful gifts. How enthusiasti-
cally the world of “society” would one day welcome them
and what a “success” awaited her whenever she was
well enough to endure its fatigue. Now, though all these
were only as so many fagots to the pile of her martyr-
dom, she delighted to listen to them, and never wearied
of hearing Calvert exalt all the greatness of the sacrifice
she was about to make, and how immeasurably she
was above the lot to which she was going to consign
herself.
It is the drip, drip, that eats away the rock, and itera-
tion ever so faint, will cleave its way at last : so Florry,
without in the slightest degree disparaging Loyd, grew
at length to believe, as Calvert assured her, that “Master
Joseph” was the luckiest dog that ever lived, and had
carried off a prize immeasurably above his pretensions.
Miss Grainger, too, found a confessor in their guest :
but it will spare the reader some time if I place before
him a letter which Calvert wrote to one of his most in-
timate friends a short time after he had taken up his abode
at the villa. The letter will also serve to connect soine
past events with the present now before us.

The epistle was addressed Algernon Drayton, Esq.,
Army and Navy Club, London, and ran thus :
“ MY DEAR ALGY,--You are the prince of 'our own
correspondents,' and I thank you, “imo corde,' if that be
Latin for it, for all you have done for me. I defy the
whole Bar to make out, from your narrative, who killed
who, in that aftair at Basle. I know, after the third read-
ing of it, I fancied that I had been shot through the heart,
and then took post-horses for Zurich. It was and is a
master-piece of the bewildering imbroglio style. Culti-
vate your great gifts, then, my friend. You will be a
treasure to the court of Cresswell, and the most injured
of men or the basest of seducers will not be able at the
end of a suit to say which must kneel down and ask
pardon of the other. I suppose I ought to say I'm sorry
for Barnard, but I can't. No, Algy, I cannot. He was
an arrant snob, and, if he had lived, he'd have gone about
telling the most absurd stories and getting people to
believe them, just on the faith of his stupidity. If there
is a ridiculous charge in the world, it is that of 'firing
before one's time,' which, to make the most of it, must
be a matter of seconds, and involves, besides, a question
as to the higher inflammability of one's powder. I don't
care who made mine, but I know it did its work well.
I'm glad, however, that you did not deign to notice that
contemptible allegation, and merely limited yourself to
what resulted. Your initials and the stars showered over
the paragraph, are in the highest walk of legerdemain,
and I can no more trace relatives to antecedents, than
I can tell what has become of the egg I saw Houdin
smash in my hat.
“I know, however, I mustn't come back just yet.
There is that shake-of-the-headiness abroad that makes

one uncomfortable. Fortunately, this is no sacrifice to
me. My debts keep me out of London, just as effectually
as my morals. Besides this, my dear Algy, I'm living in
the very deepest of clover, domesticated with a maiden
aunt and two lovely nieces, in a villa on an Italian lake,
my life and comforts being the especial care of the triad.
Imagine an infant-school occupied in the care of a young
tiger of the spotted species, and you may, as the Yankees
say, realise the situation. But they seem to enjoy the
peril of what they are doing, or they don't see it, I can't
tell which.
“Gazetted out, you say; ‘Meno male,' as they say
here. I might have been promoted, and so tempted to
go back to that land of Bores, Bearers, and Bungalores,
and I am grateful to the stumble that saves me from a
fall. But you ask, what do I mean to do ? and I own I
do not see my way to anything. Time was when gentle-
man-riding, coach-driving; or billiards, were on a par with
the learned professions ; but, my dear Drayton, we have
fallen upon a painfully enlightened age, and every fellow
can do a little of everything.
“You talk of my friends ? You might as well talk of
my Three per Cents. If I had friends, it would be
natural enough they should help me to emigrate as a
means of seeing the last of me; but I rather suspect that
my relatives, who by a figure of speech represent the
friends aforesaid, have a lively faith that some day or
other the government will be at the expense of my
passage—that it would be quite superfluous in them to
provide for it.
“ You hint that I might marry, meaning thereby marry
with money; and, to be sure, there's Barnard's widow
with plenty of tin, and exactly in that stage of affliction
that solicits consolation ; for when the heart is open to

sorrow, Love occasionally steps in before the door closes.
Then, a more practical case. One of these girls here-
the fortune is only fifteen thousand—I think over the
matter day and night, and I verily believe I see it in the
light of whatever may be the weather at the time: very
darkly on the rainy days; not so gloomy when the sky is
blue and the air balmy.
“Do you remember that fellow that I stayed behind
for at the Cape, and thereby lost my passage, just to
quarrel with—Headsworth? Well, a feeling of the same
sort is tempting me sorely at this time. There is one of
these girls, a poor delicate thing, very pretty and coquettish
in her way, has taken it into her wise head to prefer a
stupid loutish sort of young sucking barrister to me, and
treats me with an ingenious blending of small compas-
sion and soft pity to console my defeat. If you could
ensure my being an afflicted widower within a year, I'd
marry her, just to show her the sort of edged tool she
has been playing with. I'm often half driven to distrac-
tion by her impertinent commiseration. I tried to get
into a row with the man, but he would not have it. Don't
you hate the fellow that won't quarrel with you, worse
even than the odious wretch who won't give you credit ?
“I might marry the sister, I suppose, to-morrow; but
that alone is a reason against it. Besides, she is terribly
healthy; and though I have lost much faith in consump-
tion, from cases I have watched in my own family, bad
air and bad treatment will occasionally aid its march.
Could you, from such meagre data as these, help me with
a word of advice? for I do like the advice of an un-
scrupulous dog - like yourself—so sure to be practical.
Then there is no cant between men like us--we play
cartes sur table.'

has been confidentially sounding me as to an eligible in
vestment for some thousands which have fallen in from a
redeemed mortgage. I could have said, “Send them to
me, and you shall name the interest yourself;' but I was
modest, and did not. I bethought me, however, of a
good friend, one Algy Drayton, a man of large landed
property, but who always wants money for drainage.
Eh, Algy! Are your lips watering at the prospect? If
so, let your ingenuity say what is to be the security.
“Before I forget it, ask Pearson if he has any more
of that light Amontillado. It is the only thing ever sets
me right, and I have been poorly of late. I know I must
be out of sorts, because all day yesterday I was wretched
and miserable at my misspent life and squandered abili-
ties. Now, in my healthier moments, such thoughts
never cross me. I'd have been honest if Nature had dealt
fairly with me; but the younger son of a younger brother
starts too heavily weighted to win by anything but a

book. We each of us pawned our morality very early in

sort of things at home. Isn't that the bone of it? Send
me-don't forget it-send me some news of Rocksley.
I want to hear how they take all that I have been doing
of late for their happiness. I have half of a letter written
to Soph-a sort of mild condolence, blended with what
the serious people call profitable reflections and sugges-
tive hints that her old affection will find its way back to
ine one of these days, and that when the event occurs, her
best course will be to declare it. I have reminded her,
too, that I laid up a little love in her heart when we
parted, just as shrewd people leave a small balance at
their bankers' as a title to reopen their account at a
future day.
“Give Guy's people a hint that it's only wasting post-
age-stamps to torment me with bills. I never break the
envelope of a dun's letter, and I know them as instinct-
ively as a detective does a swell-mobsman. What an
imaginative race these duns must be. I know of no
fellow, for the high flights of fancy, to equal one's tailor
or bootmaker. As to the search for the elixir vitæ, it's a
dull realism after the attempts I have witnessed for years
to get money out of myself.

directed to the post-office.

The pleasant project thus passingly alluded to was not
destined to fulfilment; for as Calvert with the two sisters
were on their way to the lake, they were overtaken by
Miss Grainger, who insisted on carrying away Calvert, to
give her his advice upon a letter she had just received.
Obeying with the best grace he could, and which really
did not err on the score of extravagance, he accompanied
the old lady back to the house, somewhat relieved, indeed,
in mind, to learn that the letter she was about to show
him in no way related to him nor his affairs.
“I have my scruples, Mr. Calvert, about asking your
opinion in a case where I well know your sympathies are
not in unison with our own; but your wise judgment and
great knowledge of life are advantages I cannot bring
myself to relinquish. I am well aware that whatever
your feelings or your prejudices, they will not interfere
with that good judgment.”
“Madam, you do me honour; but, I hope, no more
than justice.”
“You know of Florry's engagement to Mr. Loyd?”
she asked, abruptly, as though eager to begin her recital ;
and he bowed. “Well, he left this so hurriedly about his
father's affairs, that he had no time to settle anything, or,
indeed, explain anything. We knew nothing of his
prospects or his means, and he just as little about my
niece's fortune. He had written, it is true, to his father,
and got a most kind and affectionate answer, sanctioning
the match, and expressing fervent wishes for his happi-
ness-- Why do you smile, Mr. Calvert?"
"I was only thinking of the beauty of that benevolence
nat costs nothing ; few things are more graceful than a
benediction-nothing so cheap."
“That may be so. I have nothing to say to it," she
rejoined, in some irritation. “But old Mr. Loyd's letter

was very beautiful, and very touching. He reminded
Joseph that he himself had married on the very scantiest
of means, and that though his life had never been above
the condition of a very poor vicar, the narrowness of his
fortune had not barred his happiness. I'd like to read
you a passage--"
“Pray do not. You have given me the key-note, and
I feel as if I could score down the whole symphony."
“You don't believe him, then ?"
“Heaven forfend! All I would say is, that between a
man of his temperament and one of mine discussion is
impossible ; and if this be the letter on which you want
my opinion, I frankly tell you I have none to give.”
“No, no! this is not the letter; here is the letter I
wish you to read. It has only come by this morning's
post, and I want to have your judgment on it before I
speak of it to the girls."
Calvert drew the letter slowly from its envelope, and,
with a sort of languid resignation, proceeded to read it.
As he reached the end of the first page, he said, “Why,
it would need a lawyer of the Ecclesiastical Court to
understand this. What's all this entangled story about
irregular induction, and the last incumbent, and the lay
impropriator ? "
“Oh, you needn't have read that! It's the poor old
gentleman's account of his calamity; how he has lost his
vicarage, and is going down to a curacy in Cornwall.
Here,” said she, pointing to another page, “here is
where you are to begin ; 'I might have borne- '"
“Ah, yes !” said he, reading aloud; “I might have

at such a critical moment of my poor boy's fate, for I am
still uncertain what effect these tidings will have produced
on you. I shall no longer have a home to offer the

once hoped—to their means of living. I am, in short,
reduced to the very narrowest fortune, nor have I the
most distant prospect of any better : so much for myself.
As for Joseph, he has been offered, through the friendly
intervention of an old college companion, an appointment
at the Calcutta Bar. It is not a lucrative nor an im-
portant post, but one which they say will certainly lead to
advancement and future fortune. Had it not been for
his hopes-hopes which had latterly constituted the
very spring of his existence—such an opening as this
would have been welcomed with all his heart; but now
the offer comes clouded with all the doubts as to how
you may be disposed to regard it. Will you consent
to separate from the dear girl you have watched over
with such loving solicitude for years ? Will she herself
consent to expatriation and the parting from her sister
and yourself? These are the questions which torture his
mind, and leave him no rest day or night! The poor
fellow has tried to plead his cause in a letter-he has
essayed a dozen times--but all in vain. “My own
selfishness shocks me,” he says, “when I read over
what I have written, and see how completely I have
forgotten everything but my own interests.". If he re-
main at home, by industry and attention he may hope,
in some six or seven years, to be in a position to marry;
but six or seven years are a long period of life, and sure
to have their share of vicissitudes and casualties. Whereas,
by accepting this appointment, which will be nearly seven
hundred a year, he could afford at once to support a wife,
of course supposing her to submit willingly to the priva-

tions and wants of such straitened fortunas. I have
offered to tell his story for him—that story he has no
strength to tell himself—but I have not pledged to be
his advocate; for, while I would lay down my life to
secure his happiness, I cannot bring myself to urge, for
his sake, what might be unfair or ungenerous to exact from
another.
“ . Though my son's account of your niece leaves us
nothing more to ask or wish for in a daughter, I am
writing in ignorance of many things I would like to know.
Has she, for instance, the energy of character that would
face a new life in a new and far away land ? Has she
courage-has she health for it? My wife is not pleased
at my stating all these reasons for doubt; but I am de-
termined you shall know the worst of our case from our-
selves, and discover no blot we have not prepared you
for.'” Calvert mattered something here, but too inaudibly
to be heard, anil went on reading: “When I think that
poor Joe's whole happiness will depend on what decision
your next letter will bring, I have only to pray that it may
be such as will conduce to the welfare of those we both
love so dearly I cannot ask you to make what are called
sacrifices' for us : but I entreat you let the considera-
tion of affection weigh with you, not less than that of
worldly interests, and also to believe that when one has
to take a decision which is to influence a lifetime, it is as
safe to take counsel from the heart as from the head-
from the nature that is to feel, as from the intellect that
is to plan.'
“I think I have read enough of this,” said Calvert,
impatiently. “I know the old gent's brief perfectly.
It's the old story : first gain a girl's affections, and let her
friends squabble, if they dare, about the settlements.
He's an artful old boy, that vicar! but I like him, on

the whole, better than his son, for though he does plead
in formâ pauperis, he has the fairness to say so."
“ You are very severe, Mr. Calvert. I hope you are
too severe,” said the old lady, in some agitation.
“And what answer are you going to give him ? "
asked he, curtly.
“That is exactly the point on which I want your
advice; for though I know well you are no friend to
young Loyd, I believe you to be our sincere well-wisher,
and that your judgment will be guided by the honest
feelings of regard for us.”
Without deigning to notice this speech, he arose and
walked up and down the room apparently deep in
thought. He stopped at last, and said, abruptly, “I
don't presume to dictate to you in this business; but
if I were the young lady's guardian, and got such a
letter as this, my reply would be a very brief one.”
“You'd refuse your consent ?"
“Of course I would! Must your niece turn adven-
curess, and go off to Heaven knows where, with God
knows whom? Must she link her fortunes to a man who
confessedly cannot face the world at home, but must go
to the end of the earth for a bare subsistence? What is
there in this man himself, in his character, station, abilities,
and promise, that are to recompense such devotion as
this? And what will your own conscience say to the first
letter from India, full of depression and sorrow, regrets
shadowed forth, if not avowed openly, for the happy days
when you were all together, and contrasts of that time, with
the dreary dulness of an uncheered existence? I know
something of India, and I can tell you it is a country
where life is only endurable by splendour. Poverty ir
such a land is not merely privation, it is to live in derision
and contempt. Everyone knows how many rupees you

dave per month, and you are measured by your means in
everything. That seven liundred a year, which sounds
plausibly enough, is something like two hundred at home,
if so much. Of course you can override all these con.
siderations, and, as the vicar says, “Let the heart take
precedence of the head. My cold and worldly counsels
will not stand comparison with his fine and generous
sentiments, no more than I could make as good a figure
in the pulpit as he could. But, perhaps, as a mere man
of the world, I am his equal; though there are little
significant hints in that very letter that show the oli
parson is very wide awake.”
“I never detected them,” said she, curtly.
“Perhaps not, but rely upon one thing. It was not
such a letter as he would have addressed to a man. If I,
for instance, had been the guardian instead of you, the
whole tone of the epistle would have been very different."
“Do you think so ?”
“ Think so! I know it. I had not read ten lines till
I said to myself, “ This was meant for very different eyes
from mine.'”
“If I thought that "
“Go on,” said he; " finish, and let me hear what you
would say or do, when arrived at the conclusion I have
come to.”
So far, however, from having come to any decision, she
really did not see in the remotest distance anything to
guide her to one.
“What would you advise me to do, Mr. Calvert?” said
she, at last, and after a pause of some time.
“Refer him to me; say the point is too difficult for
you; that while your feelings for your niece might over-
bear all other considerations, those very feelings might be
the sources of error to you. You might, for instance, con.

cede too much 10 the claim of affection; or, on the other
hand, be too regardful of the mere worldly consideration.
Not that, on second thoughts, I'd enter upon this to him.
I'd simply say a friend in whom I repose the fullest con-
fidence, has consented to represent me in this difficult
matter. Not swayed as I am by the claims of affection,
he will be able to give a calmer and more dispassionate
judgment than I could. Write to Mr. Calvert, therefore,
who is now here, and say what the mere business aspect
of the matter suggests to you to urge. Write to him
frankly, as to one who already is known to your son, and
has lived on terms of intimacy with him. His reply will
be mine."
“Is not that a very cold and repelling answer to the
good vicar's letter ?”.
“I think not, and I suspect it will have one good
effect. The parson's style will become natural at once,
and you'll see what a very different fashion he'll write
when the letter is addressed to me."
“What will Florence say?"
“Nothing, if she knows nothing. And, of course, if
you intend to take her into your counsels, you must
please to omit me. I'm not going to legislate for a young
lady's future with herself to vote in the division !"
“ But what's to become of me, if you go away in the
middle of the negotiation, and leave me to finish it?”
“I'll not do so. I'll pledge my word to see you
through it. It will be far shorter than you suspect. The
vicar will not play out his hand when he sees his ad-
versary. You have nothing to do but write as I have told
you ; leave the rest to me.”
“Florence is sure to ask me what the vicar has written;
she knows that I have had his letter.”
"Tell her it is a purely business letter ; that his son

having been offered a colonial appointment, he wishes to
ascertain what your fortune his, and how circumstanced,
before pledging himself further. Shock her a little about
their worldliness, and leave the remainder to time.”
“But Joseph will write to her in the meanwhile and
disabuse her of this.”
“Not completely. She'll be annoyed that the news of
the colonial place did not come first from himself; she'll
be piqued into something not very far from distrust;
she'll show some vexation when she writes; but don't
play the game before the cards are dealt. Wait, as I say
-wait and see. Meanwhile, give me the vicar's note,
for I dread your showing it to Florry, and if she asks for
it, say you sent it to Henderson—isn't that your lawyer's
name ?-in London, and told him to supply you with the
means of replying to it."
Like a fly in a cobweb, Miss Grainger saw herself en-
tangled wherever she turned, and though perhaps in her
secret heart she regretted having ever called Calvert
to her counsels, the thing was now done and could not
be undone.

CHAPTER XII.
DARKER AND DARKER.

HERE was an unusual depression at the villa
each had his or her own load of anxiety, and
kes each felt that an atmosphere of gloom was
thickening around, and, without being able to say why or
wherefore, that dark days were coming. .
“Among your letters this morning was there none from
the vicar, Mr. Calvert?" asked Miss Grainger, as he sat
smoking his morning cigar under the porch of the cottage.
“No,” said he, carelessly. “The post brought me
nothing of any interest. A few reproaches from my
friends about not writing, and relieving their anxieties
about this unhappy business. They had it that I was
killed—beyond that, nothing."
“But we ought to have heard from old Mr. Loyd
before this. Strange, too, Joseph has not written.”
“Stranger if he had! The very mention of my name
as a referee in his affairs will make him very cautious
with his pen."
“She is so fretted," sighed the old lady.
“I see she is, and I see she suspects, also, that you
have taken me in your counsels. We are not as good
friends as we were some time back.”
“She really likes you, though-I assure you she does,
Mr. Calvert. It was but t'other day she said, "What
would have become of us all this time back if Mad Harry

127
-you know your nickname—if Mad Harry had not been
here?'"
“ That's not liking! That is merely the expression of
a weak gratitude towards the person who helps to tide
over a dreary interval. You might feel it for the old
priest who played piquet with you, or the Spitz terrier
that accompanied you in your walks.
“Oh, it's far more than that. She is constantly talking
of your great abilities—how you might be this, that and
t'other. That, with scarcely an effort, you can master
any subject, and without any effort at all always make
yourself more agreeable than anyone else.”
“Joseph excepted ?".
“No, she didn't even except him ; on the contrary,
she said, 'It was unfortunate for him to be exposed to
such a dazzling rivalry—that your animal spirits alone
would always beat him out of the field.'”
“Stuff and nonsense! If I wasn't as much his superior
in talent as in temperament, I'd fling myself over that rock
yonder, and make an end of it!" After a few seconds'
pause he went on: “She may think what she likes of me,
but one thing is plain enough-she does not love him.
It is the sort of compassionating, commiserating estimate
imaginative girls occasionally get up for dreary depressed
fellows, constituting themselves discoverers of intellect that •
no one ever suspected-revealers of wealth that none had
ever dreamed of. Don't I know scores of such who have
poetised the most commonplace of men into heroes, and
never found out their mistake till they married them !”
“You always terrify me when you take to predicting,
Mr. Calvert."
“Heaven knows, it's not my ordinary mood. One
who looks so little into the future for himself has few
temptations to do so for his friends."

A Rent in a Clourt."
“ Why do you feel so depressed ?"
“ I'm not sure that I do feel depressed. I'm irritable,
out of sorts, annoyed if you will; but not low or melan-
choly. Is it not enough to make one angry to see such a
girl as Florry bestow her affections on that__Well, I'll
not abuse him, but you know he is a cad'—that's exactly
the word that fits him.”
" It was no choice of mine," she sighed.
" That may be; but you ought to have been more
than passive in the matter. Your fears would have pre-
vented you letting your niece stop for a night in an un-
nealthy locality. You'd not have suffered her to halt in
the Pontine Marshes; but you can see no danger in
linking her whole future life to influences five thousand
times more depressing. I tell you, and I tell you deli-
berately, that she'd have a far better chance of happiness
with a scamp like myself.”
“Ah, I need not tell you my own sentiments on that
point,” said she, with a deep sigh.
Calvert apparently set little store by such sympathy,
for he rose, and throwing away the end of his cigar, stood
looking out over the lake. “Here comes Onofrio,
flourishing some letters in his hand. The idiot fancies
the post never brings any but pleasant tidings.”
“Let us go down and meet him," said Miss Grainger;
and he walked along at her side in silence.
“Three for the Signor Capitano,” said the boatman,
“and one for the signorina,” handing the letters as he
landed.
“ Drayton,” muttered Calvert ; " the others are strange
to me.”
“This is from Joseph. How glad poor Florry will be
10 get it.”
“Don't defer her happiness, then," said he, half

ory promisnot come for be resisted,
sternly; “I'll sit down on the rocks here and con over
iny less pleasant correspondence.” One was from his
lawyer, to state that outlawry could no longer be resisted,
and that if his friends would not come forward at once
with some satisfactory promise of arrangement, the law
must take its course. “My friends," said he, with a
bitter laugh, “which be they?” The next he opened
was from the army agents, dryly setting forth that as he
had left the service it was necessary he should take some
immediate steps to liquidate some regimental claims
against him, of which they begged to enclose the par-
ticulars. He laughed bitterly and scornfully as he tore
the letter to fragments and threw the pieces into the
water. “How well they know the man they threaten!”
cried he defiantly. “I'd like to know hɔw much a drowning
nian cares for his duns ?” He laughed again. “Now
for Drayton. I hope this will be pleasanter than its
predecessors." It was not very long, and it was as
follows:
“ 'The Rag, Tuesday.
“Dear Harry,—Your grateful compliments on the
dexterity of my correspondence in the Meteor arrived at
an unlucky moment, for some fellow had just written to
the editor a real statement of the whole affair, and the next
day came a protest, part French, part English, signed by
Edward Rochefort, Lieutenant-Colonel; Gustavus Brooke,
D.L.; George Law, M.D. ; Alberic de Raymond, Vicomte,
and Jules de Lassagnac. They sent for me to the office to
see the document, and I threw all imaginable discredit
on its authenticity, but without success. The upshot is,
I have lost my place as 'own correspondent,' and you
are in a very bad way. The whole will appear in print
lo-morrow, and be read from Hudson's Bay to the Him.

alaya. I have done my best to get the other papers to
disparage the statement, and have written all the usual
bosh about condemning a man in his absence, and en-
treating the public to withhold its judgment, &c. &c.; but
they all seem to feel that the tide of popular sentiment is
too strong to resist, and you must be pilloried; prepare
yourself, then, for a pitiless pelting, which, as parliament
is not sitting, will probably have a run of three or four
weeks.
“In any other sort of scrape, the fellows at the club
here would have stood by you, but they shrink from the
danger of this business, which I now see was worse than
you told me. Many, too, are more angry with you for
deserting B. than for shooting the other fellow; and
though B. was an arrant snob, now that he is no more
you wouldn't believe what shoals of good qualities they
have discovered he possessed, and he is 'poor Bob' in
the mouth of twenty fellows who would not have been
seen in his company a month ago. There is, however,
worse than all this : a certain Reppingham, or Reppeng-
ham, the father of B.'s wife, has either already instituted,
or is about to institute, proceedings against you crimin-
ally. He uses ugly words, calls it a murder, and has
demanded a warrant for your extradition and arrest at
once. There is a story of some note you are said to have
written to B., but which arrived when he was insensible,
and was read by the people about him, who were shocked
by its heartless levity. What is the truth as to this? At
all events, Rep has got a vendetta fit on him, and raves
like a Corsican for vengeance. Your present place of
concealment, safe enough for duns, will offer no security
against detectives. The bland blackguards with black
whiskers know the geography of Europe as well as they
know the blind alleys about Houndsditch. You must

decamp, therefore; get across the Adriatic into Dalınatia,
or into Greece. Don't delay, whatever you do, for I see
plainly, that in the present state of public opinion, the
fellow who captures you will come back here with a fame
like that of Gérard the lion-killer. Be sure of one thing,
if you were just as clean handed in this business as I
know you are not, there is no time now for a vindication.
You must get out of the way, and wait: The clubs, the
press, the swells at the Horse Guards, and the snobs at
the War-office, are all against you, and there's no squar-
ing your book against such long odds. I am well aware
that no one gets either into or out of a scrape more easily
than yourself; but don't treat this as a light one: don't
fancy, above all, that I am giving you the darkest side of
it, for, with all our frankness and free speech together, I
couldn't tell you the language people hold here about it.
There's not a man you ever bullied at mess, or beat at
billiards, that is not paying off his scores to you now!
And though you may take all this easily, don't under-
value its importance.
“I liaven't got-and I don't suppose you care much
now to get-any information about Loyd, beyond his
being appointed something, Attorney-General's 'devil,' I
believe, at Calcutta. I'd not have heard even so much,
hut he was trying to get a loan, to make out his outfit,
from Joel, and old Isaac told me who he was, and what
he wanted. Joel thinks, from the state of the fellow's
health, that no one will like to advance the cash, and if
so, he'll be obliged to relinquish the place. You have
not told me whether you wish this, or the opposite.
“I wish I could book up to you at such a moment as
this, but I haven't got it. I send you all that I can
scrape together, seventy odd; it is a post bill, and easily
cashed anywhere. In case I hear of anything that may

be imminently needed for your guidance, I'll telegraph to
you the morrow after your receipt of this, addressing the
message to the name Grainger, to prevent accidents.
You must try and keep your friends from seeing the Lon-
don papers so long as you stay with them. I suppose,
when you leave, you'll not fret about the reputation that
follows you. For the last time, let me warn you to get
away to some place of safety, for if they can push matters
to an arrest, things may take an ugly turn.

it is the only bit of pleasant tidings I have for you.
Your old prediction about England being a third-rate
power, like Holland, may not be so far from fulfilment
as I used to think it. I wonder shall we ever have a

against it. In the case they relied on, the man had come

the Old Bailey, and—-him. There's delicacy for you,
after your own heart."
Calvert smiled grimly at his friend's pleasantry. “Here
is enough trouble for any man to deal with. Duns,
outlawry, and a criminal prosecution !" said he, as he

replaced his letter in its envelope, and lighted his cigar.
He had not been many minutes in the enjoyment of his
weed, when he saw Miss Grainger coming hastily towards
him. “I wish that old woman would let me alone, just
now!” muttered he. “I have need of all my brains for
my own misfortunes.”
“It has turned out just as I predicted, Mr. Calvert,"
said she, pettishly. “Young Loyd is furious at having
his pretensions referred to you, and will not hear of it.
His letter to Florence is all but reproachful, and she has
gone home with her eyes full of tears. This note for you
came as an enclosure.”
Calvert took the note from her hands, and laying
it beside him on the rock, smoked on without speaking.
“I knew everything that would happen !” said Miss
Grainger. “The old man gave the letter you wrote to
his son, who immediately sat down and wrote to Florry.
I have not seen the letter myself, but Milly declares that
it goes so far as to say, that if Florry admits of any advice
or interference on your part, it is tantamount to a desire
to break off the engagement. He declares, however, that
he neither can nor will believe such a thing to be possible.
That he knows she is ignorant of the whole intrigue.
Milly assures me that was the word, intrigue ; and she
read it twice over to be certain. He also says something,
which I do not quite understand, about my being led
beyond the bounds of judgment by what he calls a tra-
ditional reverence for the name you bear—but one thing i
is plain enough, he utterly rejects the reference to you,
or, indeed, to anyone now but Florence herself, and says,
“This is certainly a case for your own decision, and I will
accept of none other than yours.'”
“Is there anything more about me than you have
said ?" asked Calvert, calmly.

"No, I believe not. He begs, in the postscript, that
the enclosed note may be given to you, that's all."
Calvert took a long breath; he felt as if a weight
had been removed from his heart, and he smoked on
in silence.
“Won't you read it?” cried she, eagerly. “I am burn:
ing to hear what he says.”
"I can tell you just as well without breaking the
seal,” said he, with a half scornful smile. “I know the
very tone and style of it, and I recognise the pluck with
which such a man, when a thousand miles off, dares to
address one like myself.”
· “Read it, though; let me hear his own words !" cried
she.
“I'm not impatient for it,” said he; “I have had a
sufficient dose of bitters this morning, and I'd just as
soon spare myself the acrid petulance of this poor
creature." .
“You are very provoking, I must say," said she,
angrily, and turned away towards the house. Calvert
watched her till she disappeared behind a copse, and
then hastily broke open the letter.

with very questionable good taste, you addressed to him.

of exposure, I have forborne in my letter to narrate the
story which is on every tongue here; but, as the price of
this forbearance, I desire and I exact that you leave the
villa on the day you receive this, and cease from that day
forth to hold any intercourse with the family who reside
in it. If I do not, therefore, receive a despatch by tele-
graph, informing me that you accede to these conditions,
I will forward by the next post the full details which the
press of England is now giving of your infamous conduct
and of the legal steps which are to be instituted against
you.
“Remember distinctly, Sir, that I am only in this
pledging myself for that short interval of time which will
suffer you to leave the house of those who offered you a
refuge against calamity—not crime—and whose shame

will naturally be anxious to get me away from this. What
is to be done? With one week more I could almost
answer for my success. Ay, Mademoiselle Florry, you
were deeper in the toils than you suspected. The dread
of me that once inspired a painful feeling had grown into
a sort of self-pride that elevated her in her own esteem,
She was so proud of her familiarity with a wild animal,
and so vain of her influence over him! So pleasant to
say, 'See, savage as he is, he'll not turn upon me!' And
now to rise from the table, when the game is all but won !
Confound the fellow, how he has wrecked my fortunes !
As if I had not enough, too, on my hands without this ?”
And he walked impatiently to and fro, like a caged
animal in fretfukiess. “I wanted to think over Drayton's
letter calmly and deliberately, and here comes this order,
this command, to be up and away-away from the only spot
in which I can say I enjoyed an hour's peace for years
and years, and from the two or three left to me, of all the
world, who think it no shame to bestow on me a word or
a look of kindness. The fellow is peremptory—he de-
clares I must leave to-day.” For some time he con-
tinued to walk, muttering to himself, or moodily silent.
At last he cried out, “Yes; I have it! I'll go up to
Milan, and cash this bill of Drayton's. When there
I'll telegraph to Loyd, which will show I have left
the villa. That done, I'll return here, if it be but
for a day; and who knows what a day will bring
forth ?”
“Who has commands for Milan ?” said he, gaily
entering the drawing-room, where Miss Grainger sat,
holding a half-whispering conversation with Emily.

mean to run up this afternoon and be down by dinner-
time to-morrow.”
“ I'll go and see if Florry wants anything from the
city,” said Miss Grainger, as she arose and left the
room.
“Poor Florry! she is so distressed by that letter she
received this morning. Joseph has taken it in such ill
part that you should have been consulted by Aunt
Grainger, and reproaches her for having permitted what
she really never heard of. Not that, as she herself
says, she admits of any right on his part to limit her
source of advice. She thinks that it is somewhat des-
potic in him to say, “You shall not take counsel ex-
cept with leave from me.' She knows that this is the
old vicar's doing, and that Joseph never would have
assumed that tone without being put up to it.”
“ That is clear enough; but I am surprised that your
sister saw it."
“Oh, she is not so deplorably in love as to be
blinded."

CHAPTER XIII.
AGAIN TO MILAN.
OOR Bob! You were standing on that
balcony with a very jaunty air, smoking
ve your cuba the last time I passed here,” said
Calvert, as he looked up at the windows of the Hôtel
Royale at Milan, while he drove on to another and less
distinguished hotel. He would have liked greatly to
put up at the Royale, and had a chat with its gorgeous
landlord over the Reppinghams, how long they stayed
and whither they went, and how the young widow bore
up under the blow, and what shape old Rep's grief as-
sumed.
No squeamishness as to the terms that might have
been used towards himself would have prevented his
gratifying this wish. The obstacle was purely financial.
He had told the host, on leaving, to pay a thousand
francs for him that he had lost at play, and it was by no
means convenient now to reimburse him. The bank
had just closed as he arrived, so there was nothing for it
but to await its opening the next morning. His steps
were then turned to the Telegraph-office. The message
to Loyd was in these words : “ Your letter received. I
am here, and leave to-morrow."
“ Of course the fellow will understand that I have
obeyed his high behest, and I shall be back at Orta in

139
time to catch the post on its arrival, and see whether he
has kept faith with me or not. If there be no newspapers
there for the villa I may conclude it is all right.” This
brief matter of business over, he felt like one who had no
further occasion for care. When he laid down his burden
he could straighten his back, no sense of the late pressure
remaining to remind him of the load that had pressed so
heavily. He knew this quality in himself, and prized it
highly. It formed part of what he used boastfully to call
his “Philosophy," and he contrasted it proudly with the
condition of those fellows, who instead of rebounding
under pressure, collapsed, and sunk never to rise more.
The vanity with which he regarded himself supplied him
with a vindictive dislike to the world, who could suffer a
fellow endowed and gifted as he was to be always in
straits and difficulties. He mistook-a very common
mistake by-the-way-a capacity to enjoy, for a nature
deservant of enjoyment, and he thought it the greatest
injustice to see scores of well-off people who possessed
neither his own good constitution nor his capacity to
endure dissipation uninjured. “Wretches not fit to live,"
as he said, and assuredly most unfit to live the life which
he alone prized or cared for. He dined somewhat
sumptuously at one of the great restaurants. “He owed
it to himself,” he said, after all that dreary cookery of the
villa, to refresh his memory of the pleasures of the table, and
he ordered a flask of Marco-brunner that cost a Napoleon.
He was the caressed of the waiters, and escorted to
the door by the host. There is no supremacy so soor:
recognised as that of wealth, and Calvert, for a few hours,
gave himself up to the illusion that he was rich. As the
opera was closed, he went to one of the smaller theatres,
and sat out for a while one of those dreariest of all
dreary things, a comedy by the “immortal Goldoni !"

A Rent in a Cloud.
Immortal indeed, so long as sleep remains an endowment
of humanity! He tried to interest himself in a plot
wherein the indecency was only veiled by the dul-
ness, and where the language of the drawing-room
never rose above the tone of the servants’-hall, and left
the place in disgust, to seek anywhere, or anyhow, some-
thing more amusing than this.
Without well knowing how, he found himself at the
door of the Gettone, the heil he had visited when he was
last at Milan.
“They shall sup me, at all events," said he, ir. he de-
posited his hat and cane in the ante-chamber. The rooms
were crowded and it was some time before Calvert could
approach the play-table, and gain a view of the company.
He recognised many of the former visitors. There sat
the pretty woman with the blonde ringlets, her diamond-
studded fingers carelessly playing with the gold pieces
before her; there was the pale student-like boy — he
seemed a mere boy-with his dress-cravat disordered, and
his hair dishevelled, just as he had seen him last; and
there was the old man, whose rouleau had cost Calvert
all his winnings. He looked fatigued and exhausted,
and seemed as if dropping asleep over his game, and yet
the noise was deafening—the clamour of the players, the
cries of the croupier, the clink of glasses, and the clink
of gold!
"Now to test the adage that says when a man is pelted
by all other ill luck, that he'll win at play,” said Calvert,
as he threw, without counting them, several Napoleons
on the table. His venture was successful, and so was
another and another after it.
“ This is yours, Sir," said she of the blonde ringlets,
handing him a hundred franc-piece that had rolled
amongst her own.

141
Was it not to suggest a partnership that it went here?"
said he, smiling courteously.
“Who knows ? ” said she, half carelessly, half invitingly.
“Let us see what our united fortunes will do. This
old man is dozing and does not care for the game.
Would you favour me with your place, Sir, and take your
rest with so much more comfort, on one of those
luxurious sofas yonder ? "
“No!” said the old man, sternly. “I have as much
right to be here as you.”
“The legal right I am not going to dispute. It is
simply a matter of expediency.”
“Do you mean to stake all that gold, Sir ? ” interrupted
the croupier, addressing Calvert, who, during this brief
discussion, had suffered his money to remain till it had
been doubled twice over.
“Ay, let it stay there,” said he, carelessly.
“What have you done that makes you so lucky ? "
whispered the blonde ringlets. “See, you have broken
the bank !”
“What have I done, do you mean in the way of
wickedness?” said he, laughing as the croupiers gathered
in a knot to count over the sum to be paid to him.
“Nearly everything. I give you leave to question me-
so far as your knowledge of the Decalogue goes—what
have I not done?” And so they sauntered down the
room side by side and sat down on a sofa, chatting and
laughing pleasantly together, till the croupier came loaded
with gold and notes to pay all Calvert's winnings.
“What was it the old fellow muttered as he passed ? "
said Calvert ; "he spoke in German, and I didn't under
stand him."
“It was something about a line in your forehead that
will bring you bad luck yet.”

"I have heard that before,” cried he, springing hastily
up. “I wish I could get him to tell me more;” and he
hastened down the stairs after the old man, but when he
gained the street he missed him ; he hurried in vain on
this side and that; no trace of him remained. “If I were
given to the credulous, I'd say that was the fiend in
person,” muttered Calvert, as he slowly turned towards
his inn.
He tried in many ways to forget the speech that
troubled him; he counted over his winnings; they were
nigh fourteen thousand francs; he speculated on all he
might do with them; he plotted and planned a dozen
roads to take, but do what he might, the old man's
sinister look and dark words were before him, and he
could only lie awake thinking over them till day broke.
Determined to return to Orta in time to meet the post,
he drove to the bank, just as it was open for business,
and presented his bill for payment.
“You have to sign your name here," said a voice he
thought he remembered, and, looking up, saw the old
man of the play-table.
“Did we not meet last night?” whispered Calvert, in
a low voice.
The other shook his head in dissent.
“Yes, I cannot be mistaken; you muttered a pre-
diction in German as you passed me, and I know what it
meant."
Another shake of the head was all his reply.
“Come, come, be frank with me; your secret, if it be
one to visit that place, is safe with me. What leads you
to believe I am destined to evil fortune ?”.
“I know nothing of you! I want to know nothing,"
"Well, if your skill in prophecy be not greater than in

politeness, I need not fret about you,” said Calvert laugh-
ing; and he went his way.
With that superstitious terror that tyrannises over the
minds of incredulous men weighing heavily on his heart,
he drove back to Orta. All his winnings of the night
before could not erase from his memory the dark words
of the old man's prediction. He tried to forget, and
then he tried to ridicule it. “So easy,” thought he, "for
that old withered mummy to cast a shadow on the path
of a fellow full of life, vigour, and energy, like myself.
He has but to stand one second in my sunshine! It is,
besides, the compensation that age and decrepitude
exact for being no longer available for the triumphs and
pleasures of life.” Such were the sort of reasonings by
which he sought to console himself, and then he set to
plan out a future--all the things that he could, or might,
or could not do.
Just as he drove into Orta the post arrived at the
office, and he got out and entered, as was his wont, to
obtain his letters before the public distribution had conz-
menced.

THE LAST WALK IN THE GARDEN.
dressed to Misser. So far, th
CHE only letter Calvert found at the post-office
for the villa was one in the vicar's hand, ad-
dressed to Miss Grainger. Nothing from Loyd
himself, nor any newspaper. So far, then, Loyd had
kept his pledge. He awaited to see if Calvert would
obey his injunctions before he proceeded to unmask him
to his friends.
Calvert did not regard this reserve as anything
generous—he set it down simply to fear. He said to
himself, “The fellow dreads me; he knows that it is
never safe to push men of my stamp to the wall; and he
is wise enough to apply the old adage, about leaving a
bridge to the retreating enemy. I shall have more
difficulty in silencing the women, however. It will be a
hard task to muzzle their curiosity ; but I must try some
plan to effect it. Is that telegram for me?" cried he, as
a messenger hastened hither and thither in search for
some one.
“Il Signor Grainger ? "
“Yes, all right," said he, taking it. It was in these
few words.
“ They find it can be done-make tracks.
“ DRAYTON."

“They find it can be done,” muttered he. “Which
means it is legal to apprehend me. Well, I supposed as
much. I never reckoned on immunity; and as to
getting away, I'm readier for it, and better provided too,
than you think for, Master Algernon. Indeed, I can't
well say what infatuation binds me to this spot, apart
from the peril that attends it. I don't know that I am
very much what is called in love with Florence, though
I'd certainly marry her if she'd have me; but for that
there are, what the lady novelists call, “mixed motives,'
and I rather suspect it is not with any especial or ex-
clusive regard for her happiness that I'd enter into the
holy bonds. I should like to consult some competent
authority on the physiology of hatred—why it is that,
though scores of fellows have injured me deeply in life, I
never bore any, no, nor the whole of them collectively,
the ill will that I feel for that man. He has taken to-
wards me a tone that none have ever dared to take. He
menaces me! Fifty have wronged, none have ever
threatened me. He who threatens, assumes to be your
master, to dictate the terms of his forbearance, and to
declare under what conditions he will spare you. Now,
Master Loyd, I can't say if this be a part to suit your
powers, but I know well, the other is one which in no
way is adapted to mine. Nature has endowed me with a
variety of excellent qualities, but, somehow, in the hurry
of her benevolence, she forgot patience! I suppose one
can't have everything !"
While he thus mused and speculated, the boat swept
smoothly over the lake, and Onofrio, not remarking the
little attention Calvert vouchsafed to him, went on talking
of “ I Grangeri" as the most interesting subject he could
think of. At last Calvert's notice was drawn to his words
by hearing how the old lady had agreed to take the villa

for a year, with the power of continuing to reside there
longer if she were so minded.
The compact had been made only the day before,
after Calvert had started for Milan, evidently--to his
thinking—showing that it had been done with reference
to something in Loyd's last letter. “Strange that she did
not consult me upon it,” thought he; “I who have been
Ter chief counsellor on everything. Perhaps the lease of
my confidence has expired. But how does it matter?
A few hours more, and all these people shall be no more
lo me than the lazy cloud that is hanging about the
mountain-top. They may live or die, or marry or mourn,
and all be as nothing to me—as if I had never met them.
And what shall I be to them, I wonder ?” cried he, with
a bitter laugh; "a very dreadful dream, I suppose;
something like the memory of a shipwreck, or a fire
from which they escaped without any consciousness
of the means that rescued them! A horrid nightmare
whose terrors always come back in days of depression
and illness. At all events, I shall not be 'poor Calvert,'
that much to be pitied creature, who really had some
good in him.' No, I shall certainly be spared all com-
miseration of that kind, and they'll no more recur will-
ingly to my memory than they'll celebrate the anniversary
of some day that brought them shame and misfortune.
“Now then, for my positively last appearance in my
present line of character ! And yonder I see the old
dame on the look-out for me; she certainly has some
object in meeting me before her nieces shall know it.-
Land me in that nook there, Onofrio, and wait for me."
“I have been very impatient for your coming,” said
she, as he stepped on shore; “ I have so much to say to
you ; but, first of all, read this. It is from the vicar,"
'The letter was not more than a few lines, and to this

purport: he was about to quit the home he had lived in
for more than thirty years, and was so overwhelmed with
sorrow and distress, that he really could not address his
thoughts to any case but the sad one before him. W. All
these calamities have fallen upon us together; for al-
though,' he wrote, 'Joe's departure is the first step on the
road to future fortune, it is still separation, and at our age
who is to say iî we shall ever see him again ?'"
“Skip the pathetic bit, and come to this. What have
we here about the P. and O. steamers ? ” cried Calvert.
6. Through the great kindness of the Secretary of State,
Joe has obtained a free passage out--a favour as I hear
very rarely granted—and he means to pay you a flying
visit; leaving this on Tuesday, to be with you on Satur-
day, and, by repairing to Leghorn on the following Wed-
nesday, to catch the packet at Malta. This will give
him three entire days with you, which, though they be
stolen from us, neither his mother nor myself have the
heart to refuse him. Poor fellow, he tries to believe-
perhaps he does believe—that we are all to meet again in
happiness and comfort, and I do my best not to dis-
courage him; but I am now verging on seventy-
“How tiresome he is about his old age; is there any
more about his son?” asked Calvert impatiently.
“ Yes, he says here : ‘Joe is, as you may imagine, full
of business, and what between his interviews with official
people, and his personal cares for his long journey, has
not a moment to spare. He will, however, write to-
morrow, detailing all that he has done and means to do.
Of that late suggestion that came from you about refer-
ring us to a third party, neither Joseph nor myself desire to
go back; indeed, it is not at a moment like the present
we would open a question that could imperil the af-
fections that unite us It is enough to know that we

trust each other, and need neither guarantees nof
guidance.'”
“The old knave !” cried Calvert. “A priest is always a
Jesuit, no matter what church he belongs to."
“Oh, Mr. Calvert.”
“But he's quite right after all. I am far too worldly-
minded in my notions to negotiate with men of such
exalted ideas as he and his son possess. Besides, I am sud-
denly called away. I shall have to leave this inmediately.
They are making a fuss about that unfortunate affair at
Basle, and want to catch me as a witness; and as my
evidence would damage a fellow I really pity, though I
condemn, I must keep out of the way.”
“Well, you are certain to find us here whenever you
feel disposed to have your own room again. I have
taken the villa for another year.”
Not paying the slightest attention to this speech he
went on : “There is one point on which I shall be
absolute. No one speaks of me when I leave this. Not
alone that you abstain yourself from any allusion to my
having been here, and what you know of me, but that
you will not suffer any other to make me his topic. It is
enough to say that a question of my life is involved in
this request. Barnard's fate has involved me in a web of
calumny and libel, which I am resolved to bear too, to
cover the poor fellow's memory. If, however, by any
indiscretion of my friends—and remen,ber, it can only be
of my friends under this roof-I am driven to defend
myself, there is no saying how much more blood will
have to flow in this quarrel. Do you understand me?".
“Partly,” said she, trembling all over.
“ This niuch you cannot mistake,” said he, sternly;
" that my name is not to be uttered, nor written, mind
that. If, in his short visit, Loyd should speak of me,

stop him at once. Say, “Mr. Loyd, there are reasons
why I will not discuss that person ; and I desire that my
wish be understood as a command. You will impress
your nieces with the same reserve. I suppose, if they
hear that it is a matter which involves the life of more
than one, that they will not need to be twice cautioner..
Bear in mind this is no caprice of mine ; it is no caprice
of that Calvert eccentricity, to which, fairly enough some-
times, you ascribe many of my actions. I am in a
position of no common peril; I have incurred it to save
the fair fame of a fellow I have known and liked for years.
I mean, too, to go through with it ; that is, I mean up to
a certain point to sacrifice myself. Up to a certain point,
I say, for if I am pushed beyond that, then I shall declare
to the world : Upon you and your slanderous tongues
be the blame, not mine the fault for what is to happen
now.”
He uttered these words with a rapidity and vehemence
that made her tremble from head to foot. This was not,
besides, the first time she had witnessed one of those pas-
sionate outbursts for which his race was celebrated, and
it needed no oath to confirm the menace his speech
shadowed forth.
“This is a pledge, then,” said he, grasping her hand.
“And now to talk of something pleasanter. That old
uncle of mine has behaved very handsomely; has sent me
some kind messages, and, what is as much to the purpose,
some money;" and, as he spoke, he carelessly drew from
his pocket a roll of the bank-notes he had so lately won
at play. “Before making any attempt to re-enter the
service,' he says, 'you must keep out of the way for a
while.' And he is right there; the advice is excellent,
and I mean to follow it. In his postscript he adds :
“Thank Grainger'-he means Miss Grainger, but you

know how blunderingly he writes—for all her kinilness to
you, and say how glad we should all be to see her at
Rocksley, whenever she comes next to England.'”
The old lady's face grew crimson ; shame at first, and
pride afterwards, overwhelming her. To be called
Grainger was to bring her back at once to the old days
of servitude—that dreary life of nursery governess-
which had left its dark shadow on all her later years;
while to be the guest at Rocksley was a triumph she had
never imagined in her vainest moments.
“Oh, will you tell him how proud I am of his kind re-
membrance of me, and what an honour I should feel it
to pay my respects to him ?"
“They'll make much of you, I promise you,” said
Calvert, “when they catch you at Rocksley, and you'll
not get away in a hurry. Now let us go our separate
ways, lest the girls suspect we have been plotting. I'll
take the boat and row down to the steps. Don't forget
all I have been saying," were his last words as the boat
moved away.
“I hope I have bound that old fool in heavy recognis-
ances to keep her tongue quiet ; and now for the more
difficult task of the young ones,” said he, as he stretched
himself full length in the boat, like one wearied by some
effort that taxed his strength. “I begin to believe it will
be a relief to me to get away from this place !” he
muttered to himself, “though I'd give my right hand to
pass the next week here, and spoil the happiness of those
fond lovers. Could I not do it?” Here was a problem
that occupied him till he reached the landing at the villa,
but as he stepped on shore, he cried, “No, this must
be the last time I shall ever mount these steps !”
Calvert passed the day in his room ; he had much to
think over, and several letters to write. Though the next

151
step he was to take in life in all probability involved his
whole future career, his mind was diverted from it by the
thought that this was to be his last night at the villa—the
last time ise should ever see Florence. “Ay,” thought
he, “ Loyd will be the occupant of this room in a day or
two more, I can fancy the playful tap at this door, as
Milly goes down to breakfast-I can picture the lazy fool
leaning out of that window, gazing at those small snow-
peaks, while Florence is waiting for him in the garden-
I know well all the little graceful attentions that will be pre-
pared for him, vulgar dog as he is, who will not even re-
cognise the special courtesies that have been designed for
him; well, if I be not sorely mistaken, I have dropped
some poison in his cup. I have taught Florence to feel
that courage is the first of manly attributes, and what is
more to the purpose, to have a sort of half dread that it
is not amongst her lover's gifts. I have left her as my
last legacy that rankling doubt, and I defy her to tear it
out of her heart! What a sovereign antidote to all
romance it is, to have the conviction, or, if not the con-
viction the impression, the mere suspicion, that he who
spouts the fine sentiments of the poet with such heartfelt
ardour, is a poltroon, ready to run from danger and hide
himself at the approach of peril. I have made Milly
believe this; she has no doubt of it; so that if sisterly
confidences broach the theme, Florence will find all her
worst fears confirmed. The thought of this fellow as my
rival maddens me!" cried he, as he started up and paced
the room impatiently. “Is not that Florence I see in
the garden ? Alone, too! What a chance !” In a
moment he hastened noiselessly down the stairs, opened
the drawing-room window and was beside her.
“I hope the bad news they tell me is not true," she
said, as we walked along side by side.

A Rent in a Cloud.
“What is the bad news ?”
“That you are going to leave us."
“ And are you such a hypocrite, Florry, as to call this
bad news, when you and I both know how little I shall
be needed here in a day or two? We are not to have
many more moments together; these are probably the
very last of them; let us be frank and honest. I'm not
surely asking too much in that! For many a day you
have sealed up my lips by the threat of not speaking to
me on the morrow. Your menace has been, if you repeat
this language, I will not walk with you again. Now,
Florry, this threat has lost its terror, for to-morrow I shall
be gone, gone for ever, and so to-day, here now, I say
once more I love you! How useless to tell me that it is
all in vain ; that you do not, cannot return my affection.
I tell you that I can no more despair that I can cease to
love you! In the force of that love I bear you is my
confidence. I have the same trust in it that I would
have in my courage."
“ If you but knew the pain you gave me by such words
as these- "
“If you knew the pain they cost me to utter them !”
cried he. “It is bringing a proud heart very low to sue
as humbly as I do. And for what? Simply for time-
only time. All I ask is, do not utterly reject one who
only needs your love to be worthy of it. When I think
of what I was when I met you first-you !-and feel the
change you have wrought in my whole nature; how you
have planted truthfulness where there was once but doubt;
how you have made hope succeed a dark and listless in-
difference—when I know and feel that in my struggle to
be better it is you, and you alone, are the prize before me,
and that if that be withdrawn life has no longer a bribe to
my ambition—when I think of these, Florry, can you

153
wonder if I want to carry away with me some sınall spark
that may keep the embers alive in my heart ?"
“ It is not generous to urge me thus,” said she in a
faint voice.
“The grasp of the drowning man has little time for
generosity. You may not care to rescue me, but yor
may have pity for my fate."
“Oh, if you but knew how sorry I am "
“Go on, dearest. Sorry for what ?"
“I don't know what I was going to say ; you have
agitated and confused me so, that I feel bewildered. I
shrink from saying what would pain you, and yet I want
to be honest and straightforward.”
“ If you mean that to be like the warning of the surgeon
-I must cut deep to cure you—I can't say I have courage
for it.”
For some minutes they walked on side by side without
a word. At length he said in a grave and serious tone,
“I have asked your aunt, and she has promised me that,
except strictly amongst yourselves, my name is not to be
mentioned when I leave this. She will, if you care for
them, give you my reasons; and I only advert to it now
amongst other last requests. This is a promise, is it
not?"
She pressed his hand and nodded.
“Will you now grant me one favour? Wear this ring
for my sake ; a token of mere memory, no more! Nay, I
mean to ask Milly to wear another. Don't refuse me."
He drew her hand towards him as he spoke, and slipped
a rich turquoise ring upon her finger. Although her hand
trembled, and she averted her head, she had not courage
to say him no.
“You have not told us where you are going to, nor when
we are to hear from you !" said she, after a moment

“I don't think I know either !” said he in his usual
reckless way. “I have half a mind to join Schamyl-I
know him-or take a turn with the Arabs against the
French. I suppose,” added he, with a bitter smile, “it is my
fate always to be on the beaten side, and I'd not know
how to comport myself as a winner.”
“ There's Milly making a signal to us. Is it dinner-
time already?” said she.
“Ay, my last dinner here!” he muttered. She turned
her head away and did not speak.
On that last evening at the villa nothing very eventful
occurred. All that need be recorded will be found in
the following letter, which Calvert wrote to his friend
Drayton, after he had wished his hosts a good-night, and
gained his room, retiring, as he did, early, to be up be.
times in the morning and catch the first train for Milan.
“Dear Drayton,—I got your telegran, and though I
suspect you are astray in your ‘law,' and don't believe
these fellows can touch me, I don't intend to open the
question, or reserve the point for the twelve judges, but
mean to evacuate Flanders at once; indeed, my chief dif-
ficulty was to decide which way to turn, for having the whole
world before me where to choose, left me in that in-
decision which the poet pronounces national when he
says,
I am an Englishman, and naked I stand here,
Musing in my mind what raiment I shall wear!
Chance, however, has done for me, what my judgment
could not. I have been up to Milan and had a look
through the newspapers, and I see what I have often pre-
dicted has happened. The Rajahs of Bengal have got

sick of their benefactors, and are bent on getting rid of
what we love to call the blessings of the English rule in
India. Next to a society for the suppression of creditors, I
know of no movement which could more thoroughly
secure my sympathy. The brown skin is right. What
has he to do with those covenanted and uncovenanted
Scotchmen who want to enrich themselves by bullying
him? What need has he of governors-general, political
residents, collectors and commanders-in-chief? Could he
not raise his indigo, water his rice-fields, and burn his
widow, without any help of ours? particularly as our help
takes the shape of taxation and vexatious interference.
“I suppose all these are very unpatriotic sentiments;
but in the same proportion that Britons never will be
slaves, they certainly have no objection to make others such,
and I shudder in the very marrow of my morality to think
that but for the accident of an accident I might at this very
moment have been employed to assist in repressing the
noble aspirations of niggerhood, and helping to stifle the
cry of freedom tliat now resounds from the Sutlej to the
Ganges. Is not that a twang from your own lyre, Master
D.? Could our Own Correspondent have come it
stronger?
“Happily, her Majesty has no further occasion for my
services, and I can take a brief on the other side.
Expect to hear, therefore, in some mysterious paragraph,
“That the mode in which the cavalry were led, or the
guns pointed, plainly indicated that a European soldier
held command on this occasion ; and, indeed, some
assert that an English officer was seen directing the
movements on our flank.' To which let me add the
hope that the Fusiliers may be there to see; and if
I do not give the major a lesson in battalion drill, call me
a Dutchman! There is every reason why the revolt

should succeed. I put aside all the bosh about an en-
slaved race and a just cause, and come to the fact of the
numerical odds opposed. The climate intolerable to one,
and easily boit.e by the other; the distance from which
reinforcements must come ; and, last of all, the certainty i
that if the struggle only last long enough to figure in two
budgets, John Bull will vote it a bore, and refuse to pay
for it. But here am I getting political when I only meant
to be personal; and now to come back, I own that my
resolve to go out to India has been aided by hearing that
Loyd, of whom I spoke in my last, is to leave by the
next mail, and will take passage on board the P. and O.
steamer Leander, due at Malta on the 22nd. My in-
tention is to be his fellow-traveller, and with this resolve
I shall take the Austrian steamer to Corfu, and come up
with my friend at Alexandria. You will perhaps be
puzzled to know why the claims of friendship are so
strong upon me at such a moment, and I satisfy your
most natural curiosity by stating that this is a mission of
torture. I travel with this man to insult and to outrage him;
to expose him in public places, and to confront him at
all times. I mean that this overland journey should be to
him for his life long the reminiscence of a pilgrimage of
such martyrdom as few have passed through, and I have
the vanity to believe that not many men have higher or
more varied gifts for such a mission than myself. My
first task on reaching Calcutta shall be to report progress
to you.
“I don't mind exposing a weakness to an old friend,
and so I own to you I fell in love here. The girl had
the obduracy and wrong headedness not to yield to iny
suit, and so I had no choice left to me but to persist in
it. I know, however, that if I could only remain here a
fortnight longer I should secure the inestimable triumph

of rendering both of us miserable for life ! Yes, Drayton,
that pale girl and her paltry fifteen thousand pounds
night have spoiled one of the grandest careers that ever
adorned history! and lost the world the marvellous
origin, rise, progress, and completion of the dynasty of
the great English Begum Calvert in Bengal. Count
upon me for high office whenever penny-a-lining fails you,
and, if my realm be taxable, you shall be my Chancellor
of the Exchequer!

up a controversy would be to invest it with more interest

thing more to say of me, cne of these days, than that my
hair trigger was too sensitive! I'm writing this in the
most romantic of spots. The moonlight is sleeping-
isn't that the conventional ?-over the olive plain, and the
small silvery leaves are glittering in its pale light. Up
the great Alps, amongst the deep crevasses, a fitful flash-
ing of lightning promises heat for the morrow; a night-
ingale sings close to my window; and through the muslin
curtain of another casement I can see a figure pass and
repass, and even distinguish that her long hair has fallen
down, and floats loosely over neck and shoulders. How
pleasantly I might linger on here, “My duns forgetting,
by my duns forgot.' How smoothly I might float down
the stream of life, without even having to pull an oar!
How delightfully domestic and innocent and inglorious the
whole thing! Isn't it tempting, you dog? Does it not
touch even your temperament through its thick hide of
worldliness? And I believe in my heart it is all feasible,
all to be done.
“I have just tossed up for it. Head for India, and

journey, and I start to-morrow, to ensure him all the
happiness in my power to confer. For the present, it
would be as well to tell all anxious and inquiring friends,

&c., that it will be a postal economy not to address Mr.

“If-not a likely matter-anything occurs worth men-
tion, you shall have a line from me from Venice.”
When he had concluded his letter, he extinguished his
candles, and sat down at the open window. The moon
had gone down, and, though star-lit, the night was dark.
The window in the other wing of the villa, at which he
had seen the figure through the curtain, was now thrown
open, and he could see that Florence, with a shawl
wrapped round her, was leaning out, and talking to some
one in the garden underneath.
“It is the first time," said a voice he knew to be
Emily's, “ that I ever made a bouquet in the dark.”
“Come up, Milly dearest; the dew is falling heavily.
I feel it even here."
“I'll just fasten this rose I have here in his hat; he
saw it in my hair to-night, and he'll remember it.”
She left the garden, the window was closed. The light
was put out, and all was silent.

CHAPTER XV.
SISTERS' CONFIDENCES.
HE day of Calvert's departure was a very sad
one at the villa ; so was the next and the
next! It is impossible to repeat the routine
of a quiet life when we have lost one whose pleasant com-
panionship imparted to the hours a something of his own
identity, without feeling the dreary blank his absence
leaves, and, together with this, comes the not very flatter-
ing conviction of how little of our enjoyment we owed to
our own efforts, and how much to his.
“I never thought we should have missed him so
much,” said Emily, as she sat with her sister beside the
lake, where the oars lay along the boats unused, and the
fishing-net hung to dry from the branches of the mulberry-
tree.
“Of course we miss him," said Florence, peevishly.
"You don't live in daily, hourly intercourse with a person
without feeling his absence; but I almost think it is a
relief,” said she, slightly flushing.
“A relief, Florry! And in what way?” .
"I don't know; that is, I'm not disposed to go into a
nice analysis of Mr. Calvert's mind, and the effect pro-
duced upon my own, by the mere iteration of things I
never agreed with. Besides, I don't want in the least to
limit your regrets for him. He was one of your favour-
ites."

'
“I always thought him more a favourite of yours than
mine, Florry."
“ Then I suspect you made a great mistake; but,
really, I think we might talk of something else. Wha.
about those hyacinths; didn't you tell me they ought to
be moved ?”
“Yes, Harry said they had too much sun there, and
were losing colour in consequence.”
“I can't imagine him a great authority in gardening."
"Well, but he really knew a great deal about it, and
had an exquisite taste in the landscape part of it; witness
that little plat under your window.”
“The fuchsias are pretty," said she, with a saucy air.
“Isn't the post late to-day ?".
“ It came two hours ago. Don't you remember my
saying there were no letters, except two for Harry?"
“And where are you to forward them to him? Has he
been confidential enough to tell you ?”
“No; he said, if anything comes for me, keep it till you
hear of me."
“He affected mystery. I think he imagined it gave
something of romance to him, though a more prosaic,
worldly character, never existed."
“I don't agree with you, Florry. I think it was the
worldliness was the affectation.”
Florence coloured deeply, but made no reply.
“And I'll tell you why I am convinced of it. In
the mention of anything heroic or daring, or in allusion
to any trait of deep devotion or pathetic tenderness, his
lip would tremble and his voice falter, and then catching
himself, and evidently ashamed of his weakness, he
would come out with some silly, or even heartless
remark, as though to mask his confusion and give him
time to recover himself."

“I never noticed this,” said Florence, coldly. “In-
deed, I must confess to a much less critical study of his
character than you have bestowed on him."
“You are unjust yourself. It was you first pointed
out this trait in him to me.”
“I forget it, then, that's all,” said she, captiously.
1 “Oh, I knew he was ashamed of being thought ro-
mantic."
“I thought I had asked you to talk of something or
somebody else, Milly. Let us, at least, select a topic
we can think and speak on with some approach to
agreement."
Accustomed to bear with Florence's impatience and
her capricious humours as those of an invalid, Emily
made no answer, but drew out her work from a basket
and prepared to begin.
“You needn't hope to make much progress with your
embroidery, Milly. You'll have no one to read out the
Faust or the Winter Night's Tale to-day.”
“Ah, that's true, and Joseph won't be here till Satur-
day,” said she sighing, “not to say that I don't suspect
he'll have much time to bestow on reading aloud."
"I thought you were going to say that he reads
badly,” said Florry, with a forced laugh.
• Oh no, Florry, I like his reading very much indced ;
particularly of Tennyson and Browning.”
“It is not so melodramatic as your friend Mr. Cal.
vert's; but, in my poor estimation, it is in much truer
taste.”
“What a strange girl you are! Do you forget the
evening you said, “I'll not let Joseph read aloud any
more; I detest to see him in any rivalry of which he has
the worst?'"
“I must have said it in mockery, then, Milly, for I

know of nothing in which Mr. Calvert could claim sa-
periority over him. I am aware this is not your opinion,
Milly; indeed, poor Joseph has not many allies in this
house, for even Aunt Grainger was one of the fascinated
by our captivating guest.”
“Well, but you know, dearest Florry, what a magic
there is in the name Calvert to my aunt.”
“ Yes, I know and deplore it. I believe, too, from
chance expressions she has let drop, that her relations
with those very people suggest anything rather than
proud or pleasant memories ; but she is determined to
think of them as friends, and is quite vain at having the
permission to do so."
“ Even Harry used to smile at her reverence for
dear old Rocksley.'"
“ The worse taste in him," said Florence haughtily.
“How bitter you are to the poor fellow," said the
other, plaintively. .
“I am not bitter to him. I think him a very accom-
plished, clever, amusing person, good-looking, manly,
and so forth; and probably, if he hadn't persecuted me
with attentions that I did not like or encourage, I
inight have felt very cordially towards him."
“ Could he help being in love with you, Florry ?”
“In love !" repeated she, in a voice of mockery and
scorn.
“Ay, Florry, I never saw a man more thoroughly,
devotedly in love. I could tell, as I entered the break-
fast room, whether you had spoken to him in coldness or
the reverse. His voice, as he read aloud, would betray
whether you were listening with pleasure or indifference.
You had not a mood of gay or grave that was not
reflected in his face; and one day I remember, when I
reinarked on the capricious changes of his spirits, ae

said, "Don't blame me; I am what she inakes me: the
happiest or the most miserable fellow breathing. "Well,'
replied I, 'I fancied from your good spirits it was
some pleasant tidings the post had brought you.' 'No,'
said he, it was this ;' and he drew a violet from his
pocket, and showed it to me. I suppose you hail
given it to him." .
“I dropped it, and he wouldn't give it back. I re-
member the day.” And, as she spoke, she turned her
head aside, but her sister saw that her cheek was
crimson. Then suddenly she said, “How was it that
you had such confidences together? I'm sure that,
knowing my engagement, you must have seen how
improper it was to listen to such nonsense on his
part.”
“I couldn't help it, Florry; the poor fellow would
come to me with his heart almost breaking. I declare,
there were times when his despair actually terrified
me; and having heard from Aunt Grainger what dreadful
passions these Calverts give way to-how reckless of
consequences "
“There, there, dear, spare me that physiology of the
race of Calverts, of which I have gone through, I hope,
every imaginable feature. To poor Aunt Grainger's eyes
the dragon of the Drachenfels is a mild domestic crea-
ture in comparison with one of them." There was a
jarring vibration in her sister's tone, that told it were
safer not to prolong the discussion, and little more was
said as they walked towards the house. At last Florence
stopped short, and, pointing to the window of the room
lately occupied by Calvert, said, “ Joseph will dislike all
those climbing creepers there, Milly; he hates that sort
of thing. Let ther. be cut away.”
“If you wish it, dearest; but is it not a pity? Only

think of all the time and pains it cost to train that
jessamine "
. “Oh, if they have such tender memories for you, let
them remain by all means; but I think it will be quite as
well not to tell Joseph the reasons for which they were
spared.”
Though the speech was uttered in irritation, Emily
affected to hear it without emotion, and said, “It w2.5
Harry's own desire that we should not speak of bira to
Joseph, and I mean to obey it.”

CHAPTER XVI..
A LOVERS' QUARREL.
SON course of time Loyd arrived at the villa. He
came tired and worn out by a fatiguing jour-
ney. There had been floods, broken bridges,
and bad roads in Savoy, and the St. Gothard was almost
impassable from a heavy snow-storm. The difficulties
of the road had lost him a day, one of the very few he was
to have with them, and he came, wearied and somewhat
irritated, to his journey's end.
Lovers ought, perhaps, to be more thoughtful about
“effect” than they are in real life. They might take a
lesson in this respect with good profit from the drama,
where they enter with all the aids that situation and
costume can give them. Ai all events, Calvert would
scarcely have presented himself in the jaded and disor-
dered condition in which Loyd now appeared.
“How ill he looks, poor fellow," said Emily, as the
two sisters left him to dress for dinner.
“I should think he may look ill. Fancy his travelling
on, night and day, through rain and sleet and snow, and
always feeling that his few hours here were to be short
ened by all these disasters. And, besides all this, he is
sorry now for the step he has taken ; he begins to suspect
he ought not to have left England ; that this separation-
it must be for at least two years—bodes ill lo us. That
it need not have been longer had he stayed at the home

bar, and had, besides, the opportunity of coming out to -
see us in Vacation. That it was his friends who over-
persuaded him ; and now that he has had a little time for
calm reflection, away from them, he really sees no ob-
stacles to his success at Westminster that he will not have
to encounter at Calcutta.”
“And will he persist, in face of this conviction ?".
“Of course he will! He cannot exhibit himself to
the world as a creature who does not know his own mind
for two days together.”
“Is that of more consequence than what would really
serve his interests, Florry? "
“I am no casuist, Milly, but I think that the impres-
sion a man makes by his character for resolution is always
of consequence.”
Emily very soon saw that her sister spoke with an un-
usual degree of irritation. The arrival of her lover had
not overjoyed her; it had scarcely cheered her. He
came, too, not full of high hopes and animated by the
prospect of a bright future, speculating on the happy days
that were before them, and even fixing the time they
were to meet again, but depressed and dispirited, darkly
hinting at all the dangers of absence, and gloomily tell-
ing over the long miles of ocean that were so soon to roll
between them.
Now Florence was scarcely prepared for all this. She
had expected to be comforted, and supported, and encour-
aged ; and yet from herself, now, all the encouragement
and all the support was to be derived! She was to infuse
hope, to supply courage, and inspire determination. He
was only there to be sustained and supported. It is
true she knew nothing of the trials and difficulties which
were before him, and she could neither discuss nor lighten
them; but she could talk of India as a mere neighbouring

.
country, the "overland” a rather pleasant tour, and two
years—what signified two years, when it was to be their
first and last separation ? For, if he could not obtain the
leave he was all but promised, it was arranged that she
should go out to Calcutta, and their marriage take place
there.
He rallied at last under all these cheering suggestions,
and gradually dropped into that talk so fascinating to
Promessi Sposi in which affection and worldliness are
blended together, and where the feelings of the heart and
the furniture of the drawing-room divide the interest
between them. There was a dash of romance, too, in
the notion of life in the far East-some far-away home
in the Neilgherries, some lone bungalow on the Sutlej-
that helped them to paint their distant landscape with
more effect, and they sat, in imagination, under a
spreading plantain on the Himalaya, and watched the
blood-red sunsets over the plains of Hindostan. .
• Time passed very rapidly in this fashion. Love is
the very sublime of egotism, and people never weary of
themselves. The last evening — sad things these last
evenings—came, and they strolled out to take a last
look on the lake and the snow-white Alps beyond it. The
painful feeling of having so short a time to say so
much was over each of them, and made them more
silent than usual. As they thus loitered along, they
reached a 'spot where a large evergreen oak stood alone,
spreading its gigantic arms over the water, and from
which the view of the lake extended for miles in each
direction.
“This is the spot to have a summer-house, Florry,"
said Loyd; “and when I come back I'll build one here."
“You see there is a rustic bench here already. Harry
made it."

A Rent in a Cloud.
Scarcely were the words uttered than she felt her
cheek burning, and the tingling rush of her blood to her
temples.
“Harry means Mr. Calvert, I conclude ?” said he,
coldly.
“Yes,” said she, faintly.
“It was a name I have never uttered since I passed
this threshold, Florry, and I vowed to myself that I would
not be the first to allude to it. My pledge, however,
went no further, and I am now released from its obligation.
Let us talk of him freely."
“No, Joseph, I had rather not. When he was leaving
this, it was his last wish that his name was not to be
uttered here. We gave him our solemn promise, and I
feel sure you will not ask me to forget it.”
“I have no means of knowing by what right he could
pretend to exact such a promise, which, to say the least,
is a very unusual one.”
“There was no question of a right in the matter. Mr.
Calvert was here as our friend, associating with us in
close intimacy, enjoying our friendship and our confidence,
and if he had reasons of his own for the request, they
were enough for us.”
“ That does not satisfy me, Florence,” said he, gravely.
“I am sorry for it. I have no other explanation to
give you."
“Well; I mean to be more explicit. Has he told you
of a correspondence that passed between us ?”.
“Once for all, Joseph, I will not be drawn into this
discussion. Rightfully, or the reverse, I have given my
word, and I will keep it.”
“Do you mean to say that to any mention of this
man's name, or to any incident in which it will occur, you
will turn a deaf ear, and not reply?”.

“I will not speak of him.”
“Be it so. But you will listen to me when I speak of
him, and you will give my words the same credence you
accord to them on other things. This is surely not ask-
ing too much ? "
“It is more, however, than I am willing to grant.”
" This becomes serious, Florence, and cannot be dis-
missed lightly. Our relations towards each other are all
but the closest that can bind two destinies. They are
such as reject all secrecy—all mystery at all events.
Now, if Mr. Calvert's request were the merest caprice,
the veriest whim, it matters not. The moment it be-
comes a matter of peace of mind to me it is no longer
a trifle.”
“You are making a very serious matter of very little,"
said she, partly offended.
“The unlimited confidence I have placed, and desire
still to place, in you, is not a little matter. I insist upon
having a full explanation.”
“You insist ?"
“Yes, I insist. Remember, Florence, that what I claim
is not more my due for my sake than for your own. No
name in the world should stand between yours and mine,
least of all that of one whom neither of us can look on
with respect or esteem.”
“ If this be the remains of some old jealousy— ".
"Jealousy! Jealousy! Why, what do you mean?"
“Simply that there was a time when he thought you his
rival, and it was just possible you might have reciprocated
the sentiment."
“This is intolerable," cried he. Then hastily checking
his angry outburst, he added : “Why should we grow
warm, Florence dearest, over a matter which can have
but one aspect for us both? It is of you, not of myself,

I have been thinking all this time. I simply begged you
to let me know what sort of relations existed between
you and Mr. Calvert that should prevent you speaking of
him to me.”
“You said something about insisting. Now, insisting
is an ugly word. There is an air of menace about it.”
“I am not disposed to recal it,” said he, sternly.
“So much the better; at least it will save us a
world of very unpleasant recrimination, for I refuse to
comply."
“You refuse! Now let' me understand you, for this is
too vital a point for me at least to make any mistake
about—what is it that you refuse ?”.
"Don't you think the tone of our present discussion is
the best possible reason for not prolonging it?”
“No! If we have each of us lost temper, I think the
wisest course would be to recover ourselves, and see if
we cannot talk the matter over in a better spirit.”
“Begin then by unsaying that odious word.”
“What is the word ?"
“Insist! You must not insist upon anything."..
" I'll take back the word if you so earnestly desire it,
Florence,” said he gravely; “but I hope request will be
read in its place.”
“Now, then, what is it you request? for I frankly
declare that all this time I don't rightly understand what
you ask of me.”
“This is worse than I suspected," said he angrily, "for
now I see that it is in the mere spirit of defiance that you
rejected my demand.”
“Upon my word, Sir, I believe it will turn out that
neither of us knew very much of the other."
“You think so ?"
| Yes; don't you ?” .. .in

He grew very pale, and made no answer, though he
twice seemed as if about to speak.
“I declare,” cried she, and her heightened colour and
flashing eye showed the temper that stirred her—“I
declare I think we shall have employed all our lately
displayed candour to very little advantage if it does not
carry us a little further."
“I scarcely catch your meaning,” said he, in a low
voice.
“What I meant was, that by a little further effort of
our frankness we might come to convey to each other
that scenes like these are not pleasant, nor need they
ever occur again."
“I believe at last I apprehend you," said he, in a
broken accent. “You desire that our engagement should
be broken off.”
She made no answer, but averted her head.
“I will do my best to be calm, Florence," continued
he, “and I will ask as much of you. Let neither of us
sacrifice the prospect of a whole life's happiness for the
sake of a petty victory in a very petty dispute. If, how-
ever, you are of opinion ” he stopped, he was
about to say more than he had intended, more than
he knew how to say, and he stopped, confused and
embarrassed.
“Why don't you continue?” said she, with a culd
smile.
“ Because I don't know what I was about to say."
“ Then shall I say it for you?".
“ Yes, do so."
“It was this, then, or at least to this purport: If you,
Miss Florence Walter, are of opinion that two people who
have not succeeded in inspiring each other with that
degree of confidence that rejects all distrust, are scarcely

wise in entering into a contract of which truthfulness is
the very soul and essence, and that, though not very
gallant on my part, as the man to suggest it, yet in all
candoúr, which here must take the place of courtesy,
the sooner the persons so placed escape from such a false
position the better."
“ And part?” said he, in a hollow feeble voice.
She shrugged her shoulders slightly, as though to say
that, or any similar word, will convey my meaning.
“Oh, Florence, is it come to this? Is this to be a last
evening in its saddest, bitterest sense ? "
“When gentlemen declare that they'insist,' I take it
they mean to have their way,” said she, with a careless
toss of her head.
“Good Heavens!” cried he in a passion, “have you
never cared for me at all? or is your love so little
rooted that you can tear it from your heart without a
pang?”
“All this going back on the past is very unprofitable,”
said she coldly.
He was stung by the contemptuous tone even more
than by the words she used. It seemed as though she
held his love so lightly she would not condescend to
the slightest trouble to retain it, and this too at a
moment of parting.
“Florence !” said he, in a tone of deep melancholy,
“ if I am to call you by that name for the last tinie-tell
me, frankly, is this a sudden caprice of yours, or has it
lain rankling in your mind, as a thing you would conquer
if you could, or submit to, if you must ?”
“I suspect it is neither one nor the other," said she
with a levity that almost seemed gaiety. “I don't think
I am capricious, and I know I never harbour a long-
standing grievance. I really believe that it is to your

own heart you must look for the reasons of what has
occurred between us. I have often heard that men are
so ashamed of being jealous, that they'll never forgive -
anyone who sees them in the fit.”
“Enough, more than enough,” said he, trembling from
head to foot. “Let us part.”
“Remember, the proposal comes from you.”
“Yes, yes, it comes from me. It matters little whence
it comes."
“Oh, I beg your pardon, it matters a great deal, at
least to me. I am not to bear the reproaches of my
aunt and my sister for a supposed cruelty towards a man
who has himself repudiated our engagement. It would
be rather hard that I was to be deserted and condemned
too.”
“Deserted, Florry!” cried he, as the tears stood in
his eyes.
“Well, I don't mean deserted. There is no desertion
on either side. It is a perfectly amicable arrangement
of two people who are not disposed to travel the same
road. I don't want to imply that any more blame
attaches to you than to me.”
“How can any attach to me at all ?” cried he.
“Oh, then, if you wish it, I take the whole of it.”
“Shall I speak to your aunt, Miss Walter, or will
you?"
"It does not signify much which of us is the first to
acquaint her. Perhaps, however, it would come with
more propriety from you. I think I see her yonder near
the cypress-trees, and I'm sure you'll be glad to have it
over. Wait one moment, this ring——" as she endea-
voured to draw a small ruby ring from her finger, Loyd
saw the turquoise which she wore on the other hand-
: this ring,” said she, in some confusion, “is yours.”

“Not this one,” said he, sternly, as he pointed to the
other.
“No, the ruby," said she, with an easy smile. " It was
getting to hurt my finger."
“I hope you may wear the other more easily,” said he
with a bitter laugh.
“ Thank you," said she, with a curtesy, and then turned
away, and walked towards the house.
After Loyd had proceeded a few steps to overtake Miss
Grainger, he stopped and hastened back to the villa. Such an
explanation as he must make could, he felt, be only done
by a letter. He could not, besides, face the questioning
and cross-questioning the old lady would submit him to,
nor endure the misery of recalling, at her bidding, each
stage of their sad quarrel. A letter, therefore, he would
write, and then leave the villa for ever, and without a
farewell to any. He knew this was not a gracious way
to treat those who had been uniformly affectionate and
kind—who had been to him like dear sisters—but he
dreaded a possible meeting. He could not answer for
himself, either, as to what charges he might be led to
make against Florence, or what weakness of character he
might exhibit in the midst of his affliction. “I will
simply narrate so much as will show that we have agreed
to separate, and are never to meet more," muttered he.
“Florence may tell as much more as she likes, and give
what version of me she pleases. It matters little now
how or what they think of one whose heart is already in
the grave." And thus saying, he gained his room, and,
locking the door, began to write. Deeply occupied in
his task, which he found so difficult that several half-
scrawled sheets already littered the table before him, he
never felt the time as it passed. It was already midnight
before he was aware of it, and still his letter was not

finished. It was so hard to say cough and not too
inuch; so hard to justify himself in any degree and yet
spare her, against whom he would not use one word of
reproach; so hard to confess the misery that he felt, and
yet not seem abject in the very avowal..
Not one of his attempts had satisfied him. Some
were too lengthy, some too curt and brief, some read
cold, stern, and forbidding; others seemed like half en-
treaties for a more merciful judgment; in fact he was but
writing down each passing emotion of his mind, and
recording the varying passions that swayed him.
As he sat thus, puzzled and embarrassed, he sprung up
from his chair with terror at a cry that seemed to fill the
room, and make the very air vibrate around him. It was
a shriek as of one in the maddest agony, and lasted for
some seconds. He thought it came from the lake, and
he flung open his window and listened, but all was calm
and still, the very faintest night air was astir, and not even
the leaves moved. He then opened his door, and crept
stealthily out upon the corridor : but all was quiet within
the house. Noiselessly he walked to the head of the
stairs, and listened; but not a sound nor a stir was to
be heard. He went back to his room, agitated and
excited. He had read of those conditions of cerebral
excitement when the nerves of sense present impres-
sions which have no existence in fact, and the sufferers
fancy that they have seen sights, or heard sounds, which
had no reality. .
He thought he could measure the agitation that dis-
tressed him by this disturbance of the brain, and he
bathed his temples with cold water, and sat down at
the open window to try to regain calm and self-posses-
sion. For a while the speculation on this strange pro-
blem occupied him, and he wandered on thought to

ask himself which of the events of life should be assumed
as real, and which mere self delusions. “If, for in-
stance,” thought he, “I could believe that this dreadful
scene with Florence never occurred, that it was a mere
vision conjured up by my own gloomy forebodings, and
my sorrow at our approaching separation--what ecstasy
would be mine. What is there," asked he of himself
aloud, " to show or prove that we have parted ? What
evidence have I of one word that may or may not
have passed between us, that would not apply to that
wild scream that so lately chilled my very blood, and
which I now know was a mere trick of imagination ?"
As he spoke, he turned to the table, and there lay the
proof that he challenged before him. There, beside his
half-written letter, stood the ring he had given her, and
which she had just given back to him. The revulsion
was very painful, and the tears, which had not come
before, now rolled heavily down his cheeks. He took
up the ring and raised it to his lips, but laid it down
without kissing it. These sent-back gifts are very sad
things; they do not bury the memory of the loved one
who wore them. Like the flower that fell from her hair,
they bear other memories. They tell of blighted hopes,
of broken vows, of a whole life's plan torn, scattered, and
given to the winds. Their odour is not of love; they
smell of the rank grave, whither our hearts are hastening.
He sat gazing moodily at this ring—it was the story of
his life. He remembered the hour and the place he
gave it to her; the words he spoke, her blush, her trem-
bling hand as he drew it on her finger, the pledge he
uttered, and which he made her repeat to him again.
He started. What was that noise? Was that his name
he heard uttered? Yes, someone was calling him. He
hastened to the door, and opened it, and there stood

Emily. She was leaning against the architrave, like one
unable for further effort; her face bloodless, and her
hair in disorder. She staggered forward, and fell upon
his shoulder. “What is it, Milly, my own dear sister ?"
cried he; “what is the matter ?”
“Oh, Joseph,” cried she, in a voice of anguish, “what
have you done? I could never have believed this of
you !"
“What do you mean-what is it you charge me
with ? "
“You, who knew how she loved you-how her whole
heart was your own !”.
“ But what do you impute to me, Milly dearest ?"
“How cruel! How cruel !" cried she, wringing her
hands.
"I swear to you I do not know of what you accuse
me.”
“You have broken her heart," cried she vehemently.
“ She will not survive this cruel desertion.”
- “But who accuses me of this p" asked he, indig.
nantly.
“She, herself, does—she did, at least, so long as
reason remained to her ; but now, poor darling, her mind
is wandering, and she is not conscious of what she says,
and yet her cry is, 'Oh, Joseph, do not leave me. Go
to him, Milly ; on your knees beseech him not to desert
me. That I am in fault I know, but I will never again
offend him. I cannot, I will not, tell you all the dreadful
-all the humiliating things she says; but through all we
can read the terrible trials she must have sustained at
your hands, and how severely you have used her. Come
to her, at least,” cried she, taking his arm. “I do not
ask or want to know what has led to this sad scene be-
tween you; but come to her before it be too late.”

“Let me first of all tell you, Milly- " He stoppede
He meant to have revealed the truth; but it seemed
so ungenerous to be the accuser, that he stopped, and
was silent.
“I don't care to hear anything. You may be as
blameless as you like. What I want is to save her.
Come at once."
· Without a word he followed her down the stairs, and
across the hall, and up another small stair. “Wait a
moment,” said she, opening the door, and then as quickly
she turned and beckoned him to enter.
Still dressed, but with her hair falling loose about her,
and her dress disordered, Florence lay on her bed as in
a trance-so light her breathing you could see no motion,
of the chest. Her eyes were partly opened, and lips
parted : but even these gave to her face a greater look of
death.
"She is sleeping at last," whispered Miss Grainger.
“She has not spoken since you were here."
Loyd knelt down beside the bed, and pressed his
cheek against her cold hand; and the day dawn, as it
streamed in between the shutters, saw him still there.

scious. Her aunt and sister glided noiselessly
about, passed in and out of the room, rarely speaking,
and then but in a whisper. At last a servant whispered
in Loyd's ear a message. He started and said, “Yes,
let him wait;” and then, in a moment after, added, “No,
say no. I'll not want the boat—the luggage may be
taken back to my room.”
It was a few minutes after this that Emily came behind
him, and, bending down so as to speak in his ear, said,
“How I thank you, my dear brother, for this! I know
· the price of your devotion-none of us will ever for-
get it.”
. He made no answer, but pressed the cold damp hand
he held to his lips.
“Does he know that it is nigh seven o'clock, Milly,
and that he must be at Como a quarter before eight, or
he'll lose the train ?" said Miss Grainger to her niece.
“He knows it all, aunt; he has sent away the boat;
he will not desert us."
“Remember, child, what it is he is sacrificing. It may
chance to be his whole future fortune."
“He'll stay, let it cost what it may,” said Emily.
“I declare I tkink I will speak to him. It is my duty

to speak to him," said the old lady, in her own fussy,
officious tone. “I will not expose myself to the re-
proaches of his family-very just reproaches, too, if they
imagined we had detained himn. He will lose, not only
his passage out to India, but, not impossibly, his appoint.
ment too. Joseph, Joseph, I have a word to say to
you."
“Dearest aunt, I implore you not to say it,” cried
Emily.
"Nonsense, child. Is it for a mere tiff and a fit of
hysterics a man is to lose his livelihood ? Joseph Loyd,
come into the next room for a moment."
“I cannot leave this,” said he, in a low, faint voice :
“say what you have to say to me here."
“ It is on the stroke of seven.”
He nodded.
“ The train leaves a quarter before eight, and if you
don't start by this one you can't reach Leghorn by
Tuesday.”
“I know it ; I'm not going."
“Do you mean to give up your appointment?" asked
she, in a voice of almost scornful reproach.
“ I mean, that I'll not go."
“What will your friends say to this?” said she, angrily.
“I have not thought, nor can I think, of that now:
my place is here."
“Then I must protest; and I beg you to remember
that I have protested against this resolve on your part.
Your family are not to say, hereafter, that it was through
any interference or influence of ours that you took this un-
happy determination. I'll write, this very day, to your
father and say so. There, it is striking seven now !"
He made no reply; indeed, it seemed as if he had not
heard her.

* You might still be in time, if you were to exert your.
self,” whispered she, with more earnestness.
“I tell you again," said he, raising his voice to a
louder pitch, " that my place is here, and I will not leave
her.”
A low, faint sigh was breathed by the sick girl, and
gently moving her hand, she laid it on his head.
“ You know me then, dearest ? ” whispered he. “ You
know who it is kneels beside you?"
She made no answer, but her feeble fingers tried to
play with his hair, and strayed, unguided, over his head.
What shape of reproach, remonstrance, or protest,
Miss Grainger's mutterings took, is not recorded ; but
she bustled out of the room, evidently displeased with all
in it.
“She knows you, Joseph. She is trying to thank you,"
said Emily.
“Her lips are moving : can you hear what she says,
Milly ? "
The girl bent over the bed, till her ear almost touched
her sister's mouth. “Yes, darling, from his heart he
does. He never loved you with such devotion as now.
She asks if you can forgive her, Joseph. She remembers
everything."
“And not leave me,” sighed Florence, in a voice
barely audible.
“No, my own dearest, I will not leave you,” was all
that he could utter in the conflict of joy and sorrow he
felt. A weak attempt to thank him she made by an
effort to press his hand, but it sent a thrill of delight
through his heart, more than a recompense for all he had
suffered.
If Emily, with a generous delicacy, retired towards the
window and took up her work, not very profitably perhaps,

seeing how little light came through the nearly closed
shutters, let us not show ourselves less discreet, and leave
the lovers to themselves. Be assured, dear reader, that
in our reserve on this point we are not less mindful of
your benefit than of theirs. The charming things, so
delightful to say and so ecstatic to hear, are wonderfully
tame to tell. Perhaps their very charm is in the fact,
that their spell was only powerful to those who uttered
them. At all events, we are determined on discretion, and
shall only own that, though Aunt Grainger made period-
ical visits to the sick-room, with frequent references
to the hour of the day, and the departures and arrival of
various rail trains, they never heard her, or, indeed, knew
that she was present.
And though she was mistress of those "asides” and
that grand innuendo style which is so deadly round a
corner, they never paid the slightest heed to her fire. All
the adroit references to the weather, and the “glorious
day for travelling," went for naught. As well as the
more subtle compliments she made Florence on the
appetite she displayed for her chocolate, and which were
intended to convey that a young lady who enjoyed her
breakfast so heartily need never have lost a man a passage
to Calcutta for the pleasure of seeing her eat it. Truth
was, Aunt Grainger was not in love, and consequently,
no more fit to legislate for those who were than a peasant .
in rude health is to sympathise with the nervous irritability
of a fine lady! Neither was Milly in love, you will per-
haps say, and she felt for them. True, but Milly might
be-Milly was constitutionally exposed to the malady,
and the very vicinity of the disease was what the faculty
call a predisposing cause. It made her very happy to
see Joseph so fond, and Florence so contented.
Far too happy to think of the price he paid for his happi.

ness, Loyd passed the day beside her. Never before was
he so much in love! Indeed, it was not till the thought
of losing her for ever presented itself, that he knew or
felt what a blank life would hereafter become to him.
Some quaint German writer has it that these little quar-
rels which lovers occasionally get up as a sort of trial
of their own powers of independence, are like the attempts
people make to remain a long time under - water, and
which only end in a profound conviction that their or-
ganisation was unequal to the test. But there is another
form these passing differences occasionally take. Each
of the erring parties is sure to nourish in his or her heart
the feeling of being most intensely beloved by the other !
It is a strange form for selfishness to take, but selfishness
is the most Protaan of all failings, and there never was
seen the mask it could not fit to its face.
“And so you imagined you could cast me off, Flor-
ence !” “And you, Master Joseph, had the presumption
to think you could leave me,” formed the sum and sub-
stance of that long day's whispering. My dear, kind
reader, do not despise the sermon from the seeming sim-
plicity of the text. There is a deal to be said on it, and
very pleasantly said, too. It is, besides, a sort of litiga-
tion in which charge and cross charge recur incessantly,
and, as in all amicable suits, each party pays his own
costs.
It was fortunate, most fortunate, that their reconcilia-
tion took this form. It enabled each to do that which
was most imminent to be done—to ignore Calvert alto-
gether, and never recur to any mention of his name.
Loyd saw that the turquoise ring was no longer worn by
her, and she, with a woman's quickness, noted his obser-
vation of the fact. I am not sure that in her eyes a
recognition of his joy did not glisten, but she cer-

tainly never uttered a word that could bring up his
name.
“So I am your guest, Madam, for ten days more !"
said Loyd to Miss Grainger, as they sat at tea that night.
“Oh, we are only too happy. It is a very great plea-
sure to us, if-if we could feel that your delay may not
prove injurious to you.”
“ It will be very enjoyable, at all events,” said he, with
an easy smile, and as though to evade the discussion of
the other “count."
“I was thinking of what your friends would say
about it.”
“It is a very limited public, I assure you," said he,
laughing, “and one which so implicitly trusts me, that I
have only to say I have done what I believed to be right
to be confirmed in their good esteem.”
The old lady was not to be put off by generalities, and she
questioned him closely as to whether an overland passage
did not cost a hundred pounds and upwards, and all but
asked whether it was quite convenient to him to disburse
that amount. She hinted something about an adage of
people who “paid for their whistle," but suggested
some grave doubts if they ever felt themselves recom-
pensed in after time by recollecting the music that had
cost so dearly; in a word, she made herself supremely
disagreeable while he drank his tea, and only too glad to
make his escape to go and sit beside Florry, and talk
over again all they had said in the morning.
“ Only think, Milly,” said she, poutingly, as her sis-
ter entered, “how Aunt Grainger is worrying poor Joseph,
and won't let him enjoy in peace the few days we are to
have together."
But he did enjoy them, and to the utmost. Flor-
ence very soon threw off all trace of her late indisposi-

.185
tion, and sought, in many ways, to make her lover forge:
all the pain she had cost him. The first week was one
of almost unalloyed happiness; the second opened with
the thought that the days were numbered. After Monday
came Tuesday, then Wednesday, which preceded Thurs.
day, when he was to leave.
How was it, they asked themselves, that a whole week
had gone over? It was surely impossible ! Impossible
it must be, for' now they remembered the mass of things
they had to talk over together, not one of which had been
touched on.
“Why, Joseph dearest, you have told me nothing about
yourself. Whether you are to be in Calcutta, or up the
country? Where, and how I am to write? When I
am to hear from you? What of papa—I was going to
say, our papa-would he like to hear from me, and
may I write to him ? Dare I speak to him as a daugh-
ter? Will he think me forward or indelicate for it?
May I tell him of all our plans? Surely you ought to
have told me some of these things! What could we
have been saying to each other all this while ?"
Joseph looked at her, and she turned away her head
pettishly, and murmured something about his being too
absurd. Perhaps he was; I certainly hold no brief to
defend him in the case : convict or acquit him, dear
reader, as you please.
And yet, notwithstanding this appeal, the next three
days passed over just as forgetfully as their predecessors,
and then came the sad Wednesday evening, and the
sadder Thursday morning, when, wearied out and ex-
hausted, for they had sat up all night-his last night-to
say good-bye.
“I declare he will be late again; this is the third time
he has come back from the boat," exclaimed Miss

Grainger, as Florence sank, half fainting, into Emily's
arms.
“Yes, yes, dear Joseph," muttered Emily, “go now,
go at once, before she recovers again."
"If I do not, I never can,” cried he, as the tears
coursed down his face, while he hurried away.
The monotonous beat of the oars suddenly startled
the half-conscious girl; she looked up, and lifted her
hand to wave an adieu, and then sank back into her
sister's arms, and fainted.
Three days after, a few hurried lines from Loyd told
Florence that he had sailed for Malta—this time irre-
vocably off. They were as sad lines to read as to have
written. He had begun by an attempt at jocularity;
a sketch of his fellow-travellers coming on board ; their
national traits, and the strange babble of tongues about
them; but, as the bell rang, he dropped this, and
scrawled out, as best he could, his last and blotted
good-byes. They were shaky, ill-written words, and
might, who knows, have been blurred with a tear or two.
One thing is certain, she who read, shed many over
them, and kissed them, with her last waking breath, as
she fell asleep.
About the same day that this letter reached Florence,
came another, and very different epistle, to the hands
of Algernon Drayton, from his friend Calvert. It was
not above a dozen lines, and dated from Alexandria :
“The Leander has just steamed in, crowded with snobs,
civil and military, but no Loyd. The fellow must have
given up his appointment or gone ‘long sea.' In any
case, he has escaped me. I am frantic. A whole
month's plottings of vengeance scattered to the winds
and lost! I'd return to England, if I were only certain

consulted, says, 'Go east, and the worst will cúme of

here who know me, but I mean to caution them how
they show it; they are old enough to take a hint.

the work goes bravely on.".

CHAPTER XVIII.
TIDINGS FROM BENGAL.
AM not about to chronicle how time now rolled
over the characters of our story. As for the
life of those at the villa, nothing could be less
eventful. All existences that have any claim to be called
happy are of this type, and if there be nothing brilliant
or triumphant in their joys, neither is there much poignancy
in their sorrows.
Loyd wrote almost by every mail, and with a tameness
that shadowed forth the uniform tenor of his own life. It
was pretty nigh the same story, garnished by the same
reflections. He had been named a district judge “up
country,” and passed his days deciding the disputed
claims of indigo planters against the ryots, and the ryots
against the planters. Craft, subtlety, and a dash of per-
jury, ran through all these suits, and rendered them
rather puzzles for a quick intelligence to resolve, than
questions of right or legality. He told, too, how dreary
and uncompanionable his life was; how unsolaced by
friendship, or even companionship; that the climate was
enervating, the scenery monotonous, and the ther-
mometer at a hundred and twenty or a hundred and
thirty degrees.
Yet Loyd could speak with some encouragement about
his prospects. He was receiving eight hundred rupees a

lle darkly hinted that the mutinous spirit of certain regi-
ments was said to be extending, but he wrote this with
all the reserve of an official, and the fear that Aunt
Grainger might misquote him. Of course there were
other features in these letters—those hopes and fears,
and prayers and wishes, which lovers like to write, almost as
well as read, poetising to themselves their own existence,
and throwing a rose-tint of romance over lives as lead.
coloured as may be. Of these I am not going to say
anything. It is a theme both too delicate and too dull
to touch on. I respect and I dread it.
I have less reserve with the correspondence of another
character of our tale, though certainly, when written, it
was not meant for publicity. The letter of which I am
about to make an extract, and it can be but an extract,
was written about ten months after the departure of
Calvert for India, and, like his former ones, addressed to
his friend Drayton :
“At the hazard of repeating myself, if by chance my
former letters have reached you, I state that I am in the
service of the Meer Morad, of Ghurtpore, of whose
doings the Times correspondent will have told you some-
thing. I have eight squadrons of cavalry and a half
battery of field-pieces-brass ten pounders—with an
English crown on their breech. We are well armed,
admirably mounted, and perfect devils to fight. You
saw what we did with the detachment of the —th, and
their sick convoy, coming out of Allehbad. The only
fellow that escaped was the doctor, and I saved his life
to attach him to my own staff. He is an Irish fellow,
named Tobin, and comes from Tralee if there be suche

him, for he is alive, and drunk every evening. Do this,
if not a bore.
“By good luck the Meer, my chief, quarrelled with the
king's party in Delhi, and we came away in time to save
being caught by Wilson, who would have recognised me at
once. By-the-way, Baxter of the 30th was stupid enough
to say, 'Eh, Calvert, what the devil are you doing
amongst these niggers ?' He was a prisoner, at the
time, and, of course, I had to order him to be shot for his
imprudence. How he knew me I cannot guess; my
beard is down to my breast, and I am turbaned and
shawled in the most approved fashion. We are now
simply marauding, cutting off supplies, falling on weak
detachments, and doing a small retail business in murder
wherever we chance upon a station of civil servants. I
narrowly escaped being caught by a troop of the 9th
Lancers, every man of whom knows me. I went over
with six trusty fellows, to Astraghan, where I learned that
a certain Loyd was stationed as Government receiver.
We got there by night, burned his bungalow, shot him,
and then discovered he was not our man, but another
Loyd. Bradshaw came up with his troop. He gave us
an eight mile chase across country, and, knowing how
the Ninth ride, I took them over some sharp nullahs, and
the croppers they got you'll scarcely see mentioned in the
government despatches. I fired three barrels of my
Yankee six-shooter at Brad, and I heard the old beggar
offer a thousand rupees for my head. When he found he
could not overtake us, and sounded a halt, I screamed
out, “Threes about, Bradshaw, I'd give fifty pounds to
hear him tell the story at mess : Yes, Sir, begad, Sir, in
as good English, Sir, as yours or mine, Sir: a fellow who
had served the Queen, I'll swear.'

“For the moment, it is a mere mutiny, but it will
soon be a rebellion, and I don't conceal from myself the
danger of what I am doing, as you, in all likelihood, will
suspect. Not dangers from the Queen's fellows—for they
shall never take me alive-but the dangers I run from
my present associates, and who, of course, only half
trust me. ..... Do you remember old Commissary-
General Yates—J.C.V.R. Yates, the old ass used to
write himself? Well, amongst the other events of the
time, was the sack ind 'loot’ of his house at Cawnpore,
and the capture of wis pretty wife, whom they brought in
nere a prisoner. I expected to find the poor young
creature terrified almost out of her reason. Not a bit of
it! She was very angry with the fellows who robbed
her, and rated them roundly in choice Hindostanee, tell-
ing one of the chiefs that his grandfather was a scorched
pig. Like a woman, and a clever woman, too, though
she recognised me-I can almost swear that she did
she never showed it, and we talked away all the evening,
and smoked our hookahs together in Oriental guise. I
gave her a pass next morning to Calcutta, and saw her
safe to the great trunk road, giving her bearers as far
as Behdarah. She expressed herself as very grateful
for my attentions, and hoped at some future time this
with a malicious twinkle of her gray eyes—to show the
* Bahadoor' that she had not forgotten them. So you
see there are lights as well as shadows in the life of a
rebel. -
I omit a portion here, and come to the conclusion,
which was evidently added in haste.
"Up and away !' is the order. We are off to Bithoor.
The Nana there—a staunch friend, as it was thought, of
British rule—has declared for independence, and as there
is plenty of go in him, look out for something sensa.

tional.' You wouldn't believe how, amidst all these
stirring scenes, I long for news—from what people call
home-of Rocksley and Uncle G., and the dear Soph; but
more from that villa beside the Italian lake. I'd give a
canvas bag that I carry at my girdle with a goodly stock
of pearls, sapphires, and rubies, for one evening's diary of
that cottage !

Linked with failure, I'd rather keep dark; but as a sharer
in a great success, I burn to make it known through the
length and breadth of the land that I am alive and well,

not to the very fellows who injured me, to their friends,
relatives, and cousins, to the third generation. Tell

“ HARRY CALVERT!
This letter, delivered in some mysterious manner to
the bankers at Calcutta, was duly forwarded, and in time
reached the hands of Alfred Drayton, who confided its
contents to a few “friends ” of Calvert's—men who felt
neither astonished nor shocked at the intelligence-shifty
fellows, with costly tastes, who would live on society
somehow, reputably, if they could—dishonourably if they
must; and who all agreed that “Old Calvert,” as they
called him — he was younger than most of them
had struck out a very clever line, and a far more re-
munerative one than “rooking young Griffins at billiards"
-such being, in their estimation, the one other alternative
which fate had to offer him. This was all the publicity,

193
however, Drayton gave to his friend's achievements.
Somehow or other, paragraphs did appear, not naming
Calvert, but intimating that an officer, who had formerly
served her Majesty, had been seen in the ranks of the
insurgents of Upper Bengal. Yet Calvert was not
suspected, and he dropped out of people's minds as
thoroughly as if he had dropped out of life.
To this oblivion, for a while, we must leave him ; for
even if we had in our hands, which we have not, any re-
cords of his campaigning life, we might scruple to occupy
our readers with details which have no direct bearing
upon our story. That Loyd never heard of him is clear
enough. The name of Calvert never occurred in any
letter from his hand. It was one no more to be spoken
of by Florence or himself. One letter from him, however,
mentioned an incident which, to a suspicious mind,
might have opened a strange vein of speculation, though
it is right to add that neither the writer nor the reader
ever hit upon a clue to the mystery indicated. It was
during his second year of absence that he was sent to
Mulnath, from which he writes :
“ The mutiny has not touched this spot; but we hear
every day the low rumbling of the distant storm, and we
are told that our servants, and the native battalion that
are our garrison, are only waiting for the signal to rise.
I doubt this greatly. I have nothing to excite my dis-
trust of the people, but much to recommend them to niy
favour. It is only two days back that I received secret
intelligence of an intended attack upon my bungalow by
à party of Bithoor cavalry, whose doings have struck
terror far and near. Two companies of the —th, that I
sent for, arrived this morning, and I now feel very easy
about the reception the enemy will meet. The strangest
part of all is, however, to come. Captain Rolt, who

commands the detachment, said in a laughing jocular
way, 'I declare, judge, if I were you, I would change my
name, at least till this row was over.' I asked him
"Why?' in some surprise; and he replied, "There's
rather a run against judges of your name lately. They
shot one at Astraghan last November. Six weeks back,
they came down near Agra, where Craven Loyd had just
arrived, district judge and assessor; they burnt his bun-
galow, and massacred himself and his household; and
now, it seems, they are after you. I take it that some
one of your name has been rather sharp on these fellows,
and that this is the pursuit of a long meditated vengeance.
At all events I'd call myself Smith or Brown till this pre-
judice blows over.'”
The letter soon turned to a pleasanter theme-his ap-
plication for a leave had been favourably entertained.
By October-it was then July—he might hope to take
his passage for England. Not that he was, he said, at
all sick of India. He had now adapted himself to its
ways and habits, his health was good, and the solitude-
the one sole cause of complaint—he trusted would ere
long give way to the happiest and most blissful of all
companionship. “ Indeed, I must try to make you all
emigrate with me. Aunt Grainger can have her flowers
and her vegetables here in all seasons, one of my re-
tainers is an excellent gardener, and Milly's passion for
riding can be indulged upon the prettiest Arab horses I
ever saw."
Though the dangers which this letter spoke of as im-
pending were enough to make Florence anxious and
eager for the next mail from India, his letter never again
alluded to them. He wrote full of the delight of having
got his leave, and overjoyed at all the happiness that he
ictured as before him.

So in the same strain and spirit was the next, and then
came September, and he wrote: “This day month,
dearest—this day month, I am to sail. Already when
these lines are before you, the interval, which to me now
seems an age, will have gone over, and you can think of
me as hastening towards you."
“Oh, aunt dearest, listen to this. Is not this happy
news?” cried Florence, as she pressed the loved letter
to her lips. "Joseph says that on the 18th-to-day is
what day is to-day? But you are not minding me, aunt.
What can there be in that letter of yours so interesting as
this?”
This remonstrance was not very unreasonable, seeing
that Miss Grainger was standing with her eyes fixed
steadfastly at a letter, whose few lines could not have
taken a moment to read, and which must have had some
other claim thus to arrest her attention. .
“ This is wonderful !" cried she, at last.
“What is wonderful, avat? Do pray gratify our
curiosity !”
But the old lady hurried away without a word, and the
door of her room, as it sharply banged, showed that she
desired to be alone.

CHAPTER XIX.
A SHOCK.
O sooner did Mrs. Grainger find herself safely
locked in her room, than she re-opened the
de letter the post had just brought her. It was
exceedingly brief, and seemed hastily written :
“Strictly and imperatively private.
“Trieste, Tuesday morning.
“My dear Miss Grainger,- I have just arrived here
from India, with important despatches for the govern-
ment. The fatigues of a long journey have re-opened an
old wound, and laid me up for a day; but as my papers
are of such a nature as will require my presence to ex-
plain, there is no use in my forwarding them by another ;
I wait, therefore, and write this hurried note, to say that
I will make you a flying visit on Saturday next. I say
you, because I wish to see yourself and alone. Manage
this in the best way you can. I hope to arrive by the
morning train, and be at the villa by eleven or twelve at
latest. Whether you receive me or not, say nothing of
this note to your nieces; but I trust and pray you will
not refuse half an hour to your attached and faithful
Friend,
“HARRY CALVERT."
It was a name to bring up many memories, and Miss

Grainger sat gazing at the lines before her in a state of
wonderment blended with terror. Once only, had she
read of him since his departure ; it was, when agitated
and distressed to know what had become of him, she
ventured on a step of, for her, daring boldness, and to
whose temerity she would not make her nieces the
witnesses. She wrote a letter to Miss Sophia Calvert,
begging to have some tidings of her cousin, and some
clue to his whereabouts. The answer came by return of
post; it ran thus :
“Miss Calvert has to acknowledge the receipt of Miss
Grainger's note of the 8th inst.
“Miss Calvert is not aware of any claim Miss Grainger
can prefer to address her by letter, still less, of any right
to bring under her notice the name of the person she has
dared to inquire after. Any further correspondence frorn
Miss Grainger will be sent back unopened.”
The reading of this epistle made the old lady keep her
bed for three days, her sufferings being all the more ag-
gravated, since they imposed secrecy. From that day
forth she had never heard Calvert's name; and though for
hours long she would think and ponder over him, the
mention of him was so strictly interdicted, that the very
faintest allusion to him was even avoided.
And now, like one risen from the grave, he was come
back again! Come back to renew, Heaven could tell
what sorrows of the past, and refresh the memory of
days that had always been dashed with troubles.
It was already Friday. Where and how could a
message reach him ? She dreaded him, it is true: but
why she dreaded him she knew not. It was a sort of
vague terror, such as some persons feel at the sound of

:he sea, or the deep-voiced moaning of the wind through
trees. It conveyed a sense of peril through a sense of
sadness—no more. She had grown to dislike him from
the impertinent rebuke Miss Calvert had administered to
her on his account. The mention of Calvert was coupled
with a darkened room, leeches, and ice on the head, and
worse than all, a torturing dread that her mind might
wander, and the whole secret history of the correspondence
leak out in her ramblings.
Were not these reasons enough to laake her tremble
at the return of the man who had occasioned so much
misery? Yet, if she could even find a pretext, could she
be sure that she could summon courage to say, “I'll not
see you?” There are men to whom a cruelly cold reply
is a repulse; but Calvert was not one of these, and this
she knew well. Besides, were she to decline to receive
him, might it not drive him to come and ask to see the
girls, who now, by acceding to his request, need never
hear or know of his visit?
After long and mature deliberation, she determined on
her line of action. She would pretend to the girls that
her letter was from her lawyer, who, accidentally finding
himself in her neighbourhood, begged an interview as he
passed through Orta on his way to Milan, and for this
purpose she could go over in the boat alone, and meet
Calvert on his arrival. In this way she could see him
without the risk of her nieces' knowledge, and avoid the
unpleasantness of not asking him to remain when he had
once passed her threshold.
“I can at least show him," she thought, “ that our old
relations are not to be revived, though I do not altogether
break off all acquaintanceship. No man has a finer sense
of tact, and he will understand the distinction I intend,
and respect it.” She also bethought her it smacked

199
somewhat of a vengeance—though she knew not precisely
how or why—that she'd take Sophia Calvert's note along
with her, and show him how her inquiry for him was treated
by his family. She had a copy of her own, a most polite
and respectful epistle it was, and in no way calculated to
evoke the rebuke it met with. “He'll be perhaps able to
explain the mystery,” thought she, “and whatever Miss
Calvert's misconception, he can eradicate it when he sees
her."
“ How fussy and important aunt is this morning !”
said Florence, as the old lady stepped into the boat.
“ If the interview were to be with the Lord Chancellor
instead of a London solicitor, she could not look more
profoundly impressed with its solemnity.”
“She'll be dreadful when she comes back," said Emily,
laughing; “so full of all the law jargon that she couldn't
understand, but will feel a right to repeat, because she
has paid for it.”
It was thus they criticised her. Just as many aunts
and uncles, and some papas and mammas, too, are oc-
casionally criticised by those younger members of the
family who are prone to be very caustic as to the mode
certain burdens are borne, the weight of which has never
distressed their own shoulders. And this, not from any
deficiency of affection, but simply through a habit which,
in the levity of our day, has become popular, and taught
us to think little of the ties of parentage, and call a father
a Governor.

CHAPTER XX.
AGAIN AT ORTA.
HERE is a stranger arrived, Signora, who has
been asking for you,” said the landlord of
the little inn at Orta, as Miss Grainger
reached the door. “He has ordered a boat, but feeling
poorly, has lain down on a bed till it is ready. This is
his servant," and he pointed as he spoke to a dark-
visaged and very handsome man, who wore a turban of
white and gold, and who made a deep gesture of
obeisance as she turned towards him. Ere she had time
to question him as to his knowledge of English, a bell
rung sharply, and the man hurried away to return very
speedily, and, at the same instant, a door opened and
Calvert came towards her, and, with an air of deep emotion,
took her hand and pressed it to his lips.
“ This is too kind, far too kind and considerate of you,"
said he, as he led her forward to a room.
“When I got your note,” she began, in a voice a good
deal shaken, for there was much in the aspect of the man
before her to move her, “I really did not know what to
do. If you desired to see me alone, it would be inipos-
sible to do this at the villa, and so I bethought me that
the best way was to come over here at once."
“Do you find me much changed ?” he asked, in a low,
sad voice


## p. 201 (#209) ############################################

Again at Orta.

“Yes, I think you are a good deal changed. You are
browner, and you look larger, even taller, than you did,
and perhaps the beard makes you seem older.”.
This was all true, but not the whole truth, which, had
she spoken it, would have said, that he was far hand-
somer than before. The features had gained an expres-
sion of dignity and elevation from habits of command,
and there was a lofty pride in his look which became him
well, the more as it was now tempered with a gentle
courtesy of manner which showed itself in every word
and every gesture towards her. A slight, scarcely per-
ceptible baldness, at the very top of the forehead, served
to give height to his head, and add to the thoughtful
character of his look. His dress, too, was peculiar, and
probably set off to advantage his striking features and
handsome figure. He wore a richly embroidered pelisse,
fastened by a shawl at the waist, and on his head, rather
jauntily set, a scarlet fez stitched in gold, and ornamented
with a star of diamonds and emeralds.
“You are right,” said he, with a winning but very
melancholy smile. “These last two years have aged me
greatly. I have gone through a great deal in them.
Come," added he, as he seated himself at her side, and
took her hand in his, “come, tell me what have you
heard of me? Be frank; tell me everything."
“Nothing—absolutely nothing,” said she.
“Do you mean that no one mentioned me?”
“We saw no one. Our life has been one of 'complete
unbroken solitude.”
“Well, but your letters; people surely wrote about
me?"
“No," said she in some awkwardness, for she felt as
though there was something offensive in this oblivion,
and was eager to lay it to the charge of their isolation.

“Remember what I have told you about our mode of
life.”
“You read the newspapers, though! You might have
come upon my name in them !”
“We read none. We ceased to take them. We gave
ourselves up to the little cares and occupations of our
home, and we really grew to forget that there was a world
outside us."
Had she been a shrewd reader of expression, she could
not fail to have noticed the intense relief her words gave
him. He looked like one who hears the blessed words
Not Guilty ! after hours of dread anxiety for his fate.
“And am I to believe," asked he, in a voice tremulous
with joy, “ that from the hour I said farewell, to this day,
that I have been to you as one dead and buried and for-
gotten?"
“I don't think we forgot you; but we rigidly observed
our pledge to you, and never spoke of you.”
“What is there on earth so precious as the trustful.-
ness of true friendship?" burst he in, with a marked en-
thusiasm. “I have had what the world calls great suc-
cesses, and I swear to you I'd give them all, and all their
rewards twice told, for this proof of affection; and the
dear girls, and Florence—how is she?”.
“Far better than when you saw her. Indeed, I should
say perfectly restored to health. She walks long walks,
and takes rides on a mountain pony, and looks like one
who had never known illness.”
“Not married yet?” said he with a faint smile,
"No; he is coming back next month, and they will
probably be married before Christmas."
“And as much in love as ever-he, I mean?”
“Fully; and she too."
“Pshaw! She never cared for him; she never could

203
care for him. She tried it-did her very utmost. I
saw the struggle, and I saw its failure, and I told
her so!”
“You told her so !”
“Why not? It was well for the poor girl that one
human being in all the world should understand and feel
for her. And she is determined to marry him ?!
“Yes; he is coming back solely with that object."
“How was it that none of his letters spoke of me?
Are you quite sure they did not ?"
“I am perfectly sure, for she always gave them to me
to read.”
“Well!” cried he, boldly, as he stood up, and threw
his head haughtily back, “the fellow who led Calvert's
Horse—that was the name my irregulars were known by
--might have won distinction enough to be quoted by a
petty Bengal civil servant. The Queen will possibly
make amends for this gentleman's forgetfulness."
“ You were in all this dreadful campaign, then ?" asked
she eagerly.
“Through the whole of it. Held an independent
command; got four times wounded : this was the
last.” And he laid bare a fearful cicatrice that almost
surrounded his right arm above the wrist. “Refused
the Bath.”
“Refused it?"
“Why not? What object is it to me to be Sir Harry?
Besides, a man who holds opinions such as mine,
should accept no court favours. Colonel Calvert is a
sufficient title.”
“And you are a colonel already ?"
“I was a major-general a month ago-local rank, of
course. But why am I led to talk of these things? May
I see the girls ? Will they like to see me?".

“For that I can answer. But are your minutes not
counted? These despatches?”.
“I have thought of all that. This sword-cut has left &
terrible ótic' behind it, and travelling disposes to it, so
that I have telegraphed for leave to send my despatches
forward by Hassan, my Persian fellow, and rest mysel!
here for a day or two. I know you'll not let me die un-
watched, uncared for. I have not forgotten all the tender
care you once bestowed upon me."
She knew not what to reply. Was she to tell him that
the old green chamber, with its little stair into the garden,
was still at his service? Was she to say, “Your old wel.
come awaits you there," or did she dread his presence
amongst them, and even fear what reception the girls
would extend to him ?
“Not,” added he, hastily, “ that I am to inflict you
with a sick man's company again. I only beg for leave
to come out of a morning when I feel well enough. This
inn here is very comfortable, and though I am glad to
see Onofrio does not recognise me, he will soon learn
my ways enough to suit me. Meanwhile, may I go back
with you, or do you think you ought to prepare them for
the visit of so formidable a personage ?"
“Oh, I think you may come at once,” said she,
laughingly, but very far from feeling assured at the same
time.
“All the better. I have some baubles here that I want.
to deposit in more suitable hands than mine. You know
that we irregulars had more looting than our comrades,
and I believe that I was more fortunate in this way than
many others.” As he spoke, he hastily opened and shut
again several jewel-cases, but giving her time to glance-
no more than glance—at the glittering objects they con.
tained. “ By-the-way,” said he, taking from one of them

2 costly brooch of pearls, “ this is the sort of thing they
fasten a shawl with," and he gallantly placed it in her
shawl as he spoke.
“Oh, my dear Colonel Calvert !"
“Pray do not call me colonel. I am Harry Calvert
for you, just as I used to be. Besides, I wish for nothing
that may remind me of my late life and all its terrible
excitements. I am a soldier tired, very tired of war's
alarms, and very eager for peace in its best of all
significations. Shall we go?”.
“By all means. I was only thinking that you must re-
concile yourself not to return to-night, and rough it how
best you can at the villa.”
“Let me once see my portmanteau in the corner of
my old green room, and my pipe where it used to hang
beside my watch over the chimney, and I'll not believe
that I have passed the last two terrible years but in a
dream. You could not fancy how I attach myself to
that spot, but I'll give you a proof. I have given orders
to my agent to buy the villa. Yes; you'll wake some
fine morning and find me to be your landlord.”
It was thus they talked away, rambling from one
theme to the other, till they had gone a considerable way
across the lake, when once more Calvert recurred to the
strange circumstance that his name should never have
come before them in any shape since his departure.
“I ought to tell you,” said she, in some confusion,
“that I once did make an effort to obtain tidings of you.
I wrote to your cousin Miss Sophia."
“ You wrote to her !” burst he in, sternly; "and what
answer did you get?"
“There it is,” said she, drawing forth the letter, and
giving it to him.
"No claim ! no right !' murmured he, as he re-read

the lines; “the name of the person she had dared to
inquire after;' and you never suspected the secret of all
this indignant anger ?”.
“How could I? What was it?"
“One of the oldest and vulgarest of all passions-
jealousy! Sophy had heard that I was attached to your
niece. Some good-natured gossip went so far as to say
we were privately married. My old uncle, who only
about once in a quarter of a century cares what his
family are doing, wrote me a very insulting letter, re-
minding me of the year-long benefits he had bestowed
upon me, and, at the close, categorically demanded. Are
you married to her?' I wrote back four words, "I wish
I was,' and there ended all our intercourse. Since I have
won certain distinctions, however, I have heard that he
wants to make sul mission, and has even hinted to my
lawyer a hope that the name of Calvert is not to be
severed from the old estate of Rocksley Manor ; but
there will be time enough to tell you about all these
things. What did your nieces say to that note of
Sophy's ?”
“Nothing. They never saw it. Never knew I wrote
to her."
“Most discreetly done on your part. I cannot say
how much I value the judgment you exercised on this
occasion.”
The old lady set much store by such praise, and grew
rather prolix about all the considerations which led her
to adopt the wise course she had taken.
He was glad to have launched her upon a sea where
she could beat, and tack, and wear at will, and leave him
to go back to his own thoughts.
“And so," said he, at last, “they are to be married
before Christmas ?".

Again at Orta. , 207
“Yes; that is the plan.”
“And then she will return with him to India, I
take it."
She rodded.
“Poor girl! And has she not one friend in all the
world to tell her what a life is before her as the wife of a
third-no, but tenth-rate official—in that dreary land of
splendour and misery, where nothing but immense wealth
can serve to gloss over the dull uniformity of existence,
and where the income of a year is often devoted to dispel
the ennui of a single day? India, with poverty, is the
direst of all penal settlements. In the bush, in the wilds
of New Zealand, in the far-away islands of the Pacific,
you have the free air and healthful breezes of heaven.
You can bathe without having an alligator for your com-
panion, and lie down on the grass without a cobra on
your carotid ; but, in India, life stands always face to
face with death, and death in some hideous form."
“How you terrify me !” cried she, in a voice of in-
tense emotion. .
“I don't want to terrify, I want to warn. If it were
ever my fate to have a marriageable daughter, and some
petty magistrate-some small district judge of Bengal-
asked her for a wife, I'd say to my girl, .Go and be a
farm servant in New Caledonia. Milk cows, rear lambs,
wash, scrub, toil for your daily bread in some land where
poverty is not deemed the 'plague;' but don't en-
counter life in a society where to be poor is to be despic-

“Joseph says nothing of all this. He writes like one
well contented with his lot, and very hopeful for the
future.”

pounds ?”.

“ Fifteen.”
“Well, he presses the investment on which he asks a
loan, just as any other roguish speculator would, that's
all."
“On, don't say that, Mr. Calvert. Joseph is not a
rogue."
“Men are rogues according to their capacity. The
clever fellows do not need roguery, and achieve success
just because they are stronger and better than their
neighbours; but I don't want to talk of Loyd ; every
consideration of the present case can be entertained
without him."
“How can that be, if he is to be her husband ?”.
“Ah! If—if. My dear old friend, when an if comes
into any question, the wisest way is not to debate it, for
the simple reason that applying our logic to what is
merely imaginary is very like putting a superstructure of
masonry over a house of cards. Besides, if we must
talk with a hypothesis, I'll put mine, Must she of
necessity marry this man, if he insists on it?'"
“Of course ; and the more, that she loves him."
" Loves him! Have I not told you that you are mis-
taken there ? He entrapped her at first into a half ad-
mission of caring for him, and, partly from a sense of
honour, and partly from obstinacy, she adheres to it.
But she does so just the way people cling to a religion,
because nobody has ever taken the trouble to convert
them to another faith.”
“I wish you would not say these things to me,” cried
she with much emotion. “You have a way of throwing
doubts upon everything and everybody, that always
makes me miserable, and I ask myself afterwards, Is
there nothing to be believed ? Is no one to be
trusteit?"

“ Not a great many, I am sorry to say,” sighed he.
“It's no bright testimony to the goodness of the world,
that the longer a man lives the worse he thinks of it. I
surely saw the flutter of white muslin through the trees
yonder. Oh dear, how much softer my heart is than I
knew of! I feel a sort of choking in the throat as I
draw near this dear old place. Yes, there she is
Florence herself. I remember her way of waving a
handkerchief. I'll answer it as I used to do." And he
stood up in the boat and waved his handkerchief over
his head with a wide and circling motion. “Look! She
sees it, and she's away to the house at speed. How she
runs! She could not have mustered such speed as that
when I last say her."
“Sh, has gone to tell Milly, I'm certain."
He made no reply, but covered his face with his
hands, and sat silent and motionless. Meanwhile the
boat glided up to the landing-place, and they dis-
embarked.
“I thought the girls would have been here to meet
us,” said Miss Grainger, with a pique she could not re-
press; but Calvert walked along at her side, and made
no answer.
“I think you know your way here,” said she with a
smile, as she motioned him towards the drawing-rooin.

CHAPTER XXI.
THE RETURN.
YHEN Calvert found himself alone in the drawing-
room, he felt as if he had never been away.
Boh Everything was so exactly as he left it. There
was the sofa drawn close to the window of the flower-
garden where Florence used to recline; there the little
work-table with the tall glass that held her hyacinths,
the flowers she was so fond of; there the rug for her
terrier to lie on. Yonder, under the fig-tree, hung the
cage with her favourite canary; and here were the very
books she used to read long ago—Petrarch and Tenny-
son and Uhland. There was a flower to mark a place in
the volume of Uhland, and it was at a little poena they
had once read together. How full of memories are these
old rooms, where we have dreamed away some weeks of
life, if not.in love, in something akin to it, and thus more
alive to the influences of externals than if further gone in
the passion! There was not a spot, not a chair, nor a
window-seat that did not remind Calvert of some incident
of the past. He missed his favourite song, “A place in
thy memory, dearest," from the piano, and he sought for
it and put it back where it used to be; and he then
went over to her table to arrange the books as they were
wont to be long ago, and came suddenly upon a small
morocco case. He opened it. It was a miniature of
Loyd, the man he hated the most on earth. It was an

ill done portrait, and gave an affected thoughtfulness and
eievation to his calm features which imparted insufferable
pretension to them ; Calvert held out the picture at arm's
length, and laughed scornfully as he looked at it. He
had but time to lay it down on the table when Emily
entered the room. She approached him hurriedly, and
with an agitated manner. “Oh, Colonel Calvert- "
she began.
“Why not Harry, brother Harry, as I used to be, Milly
dearest,” said he, as he caught her hand in both his own.
“What has happened to forfeit for me my old place in
your esteem ?"
“Nothing, nothing, but all is so changed; you have
grown to be such a great man, and we have become lost
to all that goes on in the world.”
“And where is your sister, will she not come to see
me ?"
“You startled her, you gave her such a shock, when
you stood up in the boat and returned her salute, that
she was quite overcome, and has gone to her room. Aunt
Grainger is with her, and told me to say—that is, she
hoped, if you would not take it ill, or deem it unkind
“Go on, dearest; nothing that comes from your lips
can possibly seem unkind; go on.”
“But I cannot go on,” she cried, and burst into tears
and covered her face with her hands.
“I never thought-so little forethought has selfishness
- that I was to bring sorrow and trouble under this roof.
Go back, and tell your aunt that I hope she will favour
me with five minutes of her company ; that I see what I
greatly blame myself for not seeing before, how full of
sau memories my presence here must prove. Gu, dar-
ing, say this, and bid me good-bye before you go."

“Oh, Harry, do not say this. I see you are angry
with us. I see you think us all unkind; but it was the
suddenness of your coming; and Florence has grown
so nervous of late, so disposed to give way to all manner
of fancies. *
“She imagines, in fact,” said he, haughtily, “that I
have come back to persecute her with attentions which
she has already rejected. Isn't that so?”
“No. I don't think-I mean Florence could never
think that when you knew of her engagement-knew that
within a few months at furthest-_"
“Pardon me, if I stop you. Tell your sister from me
that she has nothing to apprehend from any pretensions
of mine. I can see that you think me changed, Milly ;
grown very old and very worn. Well, go back, and tell
her that the inward change is far greater than the out-
ward one. Mad Harry has become as tame and quiet
and commonplace as that gentleman in the morocco case
yonder; and if she will condescend to see me, she may
satisfy herself that neither of us in future need be deemed
dangerous to the other."
There was an insolent pride in the manner of his
delivery of these words that made Emily's cheek burn as
she listened, and all that her aunt had often told her of
“ Calvert insolence" now came fully to her mind.
“I will go and speak to my aunt,” she said at last.
“Do so," said he, carelessly, as he threw himself
into a chair, and took up the book that lay nearest to
him. He had not turned over many pages he had read
none—when Miss Grainger entered. She was flushed
and furried in manner; but tried to conceal it.
“ We are giving you a very strange welcome, Colonel
-Mr. Calvert; but you know us all of old, and you
know that dear Florry is so easily agitated and overcome

She is better now, and if you will come up stairs to the
little drawing-room, she'll see you."
“I am all gratitude," said he, with a low bow : “but
I think it is, perhaps, better not to inconvenience her.
A visit of constraint would be, to me at least, very
painful. I'd rather leave the old memories of my hap-
piness here undashed by such a shadow. Go back,
therefore, and say that I meziak I understand the reason
of her reserve; that I am sincerely grateful for the
thoughtful kindness she has been minded to observe
towards me. You need not add,” said he with a faint
smile, “that the consideration in the present case was un-
necessary. I am not so impressionable as I used to be ;
but assure her that I am very sorry for it, and that
Colonel Calvert, with all his successes, is not half so
happy a fellow as mad Harry used to be without a
guinea.”
“But you'll not leave us? You'll stay here to-night?'
“Pray excuse me. One of my objects—my chief one
-in coming over here, was to ask your nieces' acceptance
of some trinkets I had brought for them. Perhaps this
would not be a happy moment to ask a favour at their
hands, so pray keep them over and make birthday pre-
sents of them in my name. This is for Florence—this, I
hope Emily will not refuse."
“But do not go. l entreat you not to go. I feel so
certain that if you stay we shall all be so happy together.
There is so much, besides, to talk over ; and as to those
beautiful things, for I know they must be beautiful —-".
“ They are curious in their way,” said he, carelessly
opening the clasp of one of the cases, and displaying
before her amazed eyes a necklace of pearls and brilliants
that a queen might wear.
“Oh, Colonel Calvert, it would be impossible for my

niece to accept such a costly gift as this. I never beheld
anything so splendid in my life.”
“These ear-drops," he continued, " are considered fine.
They were said to belong to one of the wives of the King
of Delhi, and were reputed the largest pearls in India.”
“The girls must see them; though I protest and de-
clare beforehand nothing on earth should induce us to
accept them.”
“Let them look well at them, then,” said he, "fur
when you place them in my hands again, none shall ever
behold them after."
“What do you mean?"
“I mean that I'll throw them into the lake yonder
A rejected gift is too odious a memory to be clogged
with.”
“ You couldn't be guilty of such rash folly ?".
“Don't you know well that I could ? Is it to-day or
yesterday that the Calvert nature is known to you? If
you wish me to swear it, I will do so; and, what is
more, I will make you stand by and see the water close
over them."
"Oh, you are not changed—not in the least changed,"
she cried, in a voice of real emotion.
"Only in some things, perhaps," said he, carelessly.
“ By-the-way, this is a miniature of me—was taken in
India. It is a locket on this side. Ask Emily to wear
it occasionally for my sake.”
“How like ! and what a splendid costume !".
“That was my dress in full state ! but I prefer my ser.
vice uniform, and think it became me better."
“Nothing could become you better than this,” said
she, admiringly; and truly there was good warrant for
the admiration ; “but even shis is covered with dia-
monds !”

"Only a circlet and my initials. It is of small
value. These are the baubles. Do what you will with
them; and now good-bye. Tanti salutì, as we used to
say long ago to the ladies—Tanti salutì de la parte mia.
Tell Milly she is very naughty not to have given me her
hand to kiss before we parted; but if she will conde-
scend to wear this locket, now and then, I'll forgive her.
Good-bye.”
And, before Miss Grainger could reply, he had opened
the window and was gone.
When Calvert reached the jetty the boatman was not
there ; but the boat, with her oars, lay close to the
steps; the chain that attached her to an iron ring was,
however, padlocked, and Calvert turned impatiently back
to seek the man. After he had gone, however, a few
paces, he seemed to change his mind, and turned once
more towards the lake. Taking up a heavy stone, he
proceeded to smash the lock on the chain. It was
stronger than he looked for, and occupied some minutes ;
but he succeeded at last. Just as he threw into the boat
the loose end of the broken chain, he heard steps behind
him ; he turned ; it was Emily running towards him at
full speed. “Oh Harry, dear Harry !” she cried, “don't
go; don't leave us ; Florence is quite well again, and as
far as strength will let her, trying to come and meet you.
See, yonder she is, leaning on aunt's arm.” True enough,
at some hundred yards off, the young girl was seen
slowly dragging her limbs forward in the direction where
they stood.
“I have come some thousand leagues to see her," said
he. sternly, “through greater fatigues, and, perhaps, as
roanv perils as she is encountering."
“Go to her; go towards her," cried Emily, reproache
filly.

“Not one step; not the breadth of a hair, Milly," said
he. “There is a limit to the indignity a woman may put
upon a man, and your sister has passed it. If she likes
to come and say farewell to me here, be it so; if not, I
must go without it.”
“ Then I can tell you one thing, Colonel Calvert, if my
sister Florence only knew of the words you have just
spoken, she'd not move one other step towards you if,
if-4”
“If it were to save my life, you would say. That is
not so unreasonable,” said he, with a saucy laugh.
“Here is Florence come, weak and tottering as she is,
to ask you to stay with us. You'll not have the heart to
say No to her,” said Miss Grainger.
“I don't think we—any of us—know much about Mr.
Calvert's heart, or what it would prompt him to do,” said
Emily, half indignantly, as she turned away. And for-
tunate it was she did turn away, since, had she met the
fierce look of Calvert's eyes at the moment, it would
have chilled her very blood with fear.
“But you'll not refuse me,” said Florence, laying her
hand on his arm. “You know well how seldom I ask
favours, and how unused I am to be denied when I do
ask.”
“I was always your slave-I ask nothing better than
to be so still,” he whispered in her ear.
“ And you will stay ?"
“Yes, till you bid me go,” he whispered again; “but
remember, too, that when I ask a favour I can just as
little brook refusal.”
“We'll talk of that another time. Give me your arm.

and faint. Is Milly angry with you ?" she asked, as they
walked along, side by side.

“I don't know; perhaps so," said he, carelessly.
“You used to be such good friends. I hope you have
not fallen out ? "
“I hope not,” said he, in his former easy tone; "or
that if we have, we may make it up again. Bear in mind,
Florence," added he with more gravity of manner, “ that
I am a good deal changed from what you knew me. I
have less pride, cherish fewer resentments, scarcely any
hopes, and no affections—I mean, strong affections. The
heart you refused is now cold; the only sentiment
left me, is a sense of gratitude, I can be very grate-
ful; I am already so." She made no answer to this
speech, and they re-entered the house in silence.

CHAPTER XXII.
A LETTER OF CONFESSIONS.
HE following letter from Calvert to Drayton was
written about three weeks after the event of
| our last chapter :
“The Villa.
“My dear Algernon,-I knew my black fellow would
run you to earth, though he had not a word of English in
his vocabulary, nor any clue to you except your name
and a map of England. It must have, however, been his
near kinsman—the other 'black gentleman'-suggested
Scarborough to him; and, to this hour, I cannot conceive
how he found you. I am overjoyed to hear that you
could muster enough Hindostanee to talk with him,
and hear some of those adventures which my natural
modesty might have scrupled to tell you. It would seem
from your note, that he has been candour itself, and
confessed much that a man of a paler and thinner skin
might prefer to have shrouded or evaded. All true, D.;
we have done our brigandage on a grand scale, and
divided our prize money without the aid of a prize-
court. Keep those trinkets with an easy conscience, and
if they leave your own hands for any less worthy still, re-
member the adage, “Ill got, ill gone,' and be comforted. I
suppose you are right — you are generally right on a
question of worldly craft and prudence-it is better not

to atempt the sale of the larger gems in England. St.
Petersburg and Vienna are as good markets, and safer.
“El. J. has already told you of our escape into Cash-
mere : make him narrate the capture of Mansergh, and
how he found the Keyserbagh necklace under his saddle.
A Queen's officer looting! Only think of the enormity !
Did it not justify those proceedings in which Instinct
anticipated the finding of a court-martial ? The East,
and its adventures-a very bulky roll, I assure you-
must wait till we meet; and in my next I shall say
where, and how, and when : for there is much that I
shall tell that I could not write even to you, Algernon.
Respect my delicacy, and be patient.
“I know you are impatient to hear why I am not
nearer England-even at Paris--and I am just as im.
patient to tell you. The address of this will show you
where I am. All the writing in the world could not tell
you why. No, Drayton; I lie awake at night, question-
ing, questioning, and in vain. I have gone to the
nicest anatomy of my motives, dissecting fibre by fibre,
and may I be—a Queen's officer—if I can hit upon an
explanation of the mystery. The nearest I can come
is, that I feel the place dangerous to me, and, there-
fore, I cling to it. I know well the feeling that would
draw a man back to the spot where he had committed
a great crime. Blood is a very glutinous fluid, and has
most cohesive properties; but here, in this place, I have
done no enormities, and why I hug this coast, except
that it be a lee-shore, where shipwreck is very possible,
I really cannot make out. Not a bit in love ? No,
Algy. It is not easy for a man like me to fall in love.
Love demands a variety of qualities, which have long
left me, if I ever had them. I have little trustfulness,
no credulity ; I very seldom look back, never look for.

ward; I neither believe in another, nor ask belief in
myself. I have seen too much of life to be a dreamer-
reality with me denies all place to mere romance. Last
of all I cannot argue from the existence of certain quali-
ties in a woman to the certainty of her possessing fifty :
others that I wish her to have. I only believe what I
see, and my moral eyes are affected with cataract ;
and yet, with all this, there's a girl here--the same, ay,
the same, I told you of long ago—that I'd rather marry
than I'd be King of Agra, with a British governor-general
for my water-carrier ! The most maddening of all jea-
lousy is for a woman that one is not in love with! I am
not mad, most noble Drayton, though I am occasionally
as near it as is safe for the surrounders. With the same
determination that this girl says she'll not have me, have
I sworn to myself she shall be mine. It is a fair open
game, and I leave you, who love a wager, to name the
winner. I have seen many prettier women-scores of
cleverer ones. I am not quite sure that in the matter
of those social captivations into which manner enters,
she has any especial gifts. She is not a horsewoman,
in the real sense of the word, which, once on a time,
was a sine quâ non cf mine; nor, in fact, has she a pe-
culiar excellence in anything, ard yet she gives you the
impression of being able to be anything she likes. She
has great quickness and great adaptiveness, but she pos-
sesses one trait of attraction above all; she utterly
rejects me, and sets all my arts at defiance. I saw, very
soon after I came back here, that she was prepared for a
regular siege, and expected a fierce love-suit on my part.
I accordingly spiked my heavy artillery, and assumed an
attitude of peace-like indolence. I lounged about,
chiefly alone; neither avoided nor sought her, and, if I
did nothing more, I sorely puzzled her as to what I could

mean by my conduct. This was so far a success that it
excited her interest, and I saw that she watched and was
studying me. She even made faint attempts at little con.
fidences: “Saw I was unhappy-had something on my
mind :' and, for the matter of that, I had plenty—plenty
on my conscience, too, if nature had been cruel enough
o have inflicted me with one. I, of course, said 'No' to
all these insinuations. I was not happy nor unhappy. If
I sat at the table of life, and did not eat, it was
because I had no great appetite. The entertainment
did not amuse me much, but I had nowhere particularly
to go to. She went one day so far as to hint whether
I was not crossed in love? But I assured her not,
and I saw her grow very pale as I said it. I even
suggested, that though one might have two attacks of
the malady, like the measles, the second one was always
mild, and never hurt the constitution. Having thus
piqued her a little about myself, I gradually unsettled
her opinion on other things, frightened her by how the
geologists contradict Genesis, and gave her to choose
between Monsieur Cuvier and Moses. As for India, I
made her believe that we were all heartily ashamed of
what we were doing there, spoke of the Hindoo as the
model native, and said that if the story of our atrocities
were written, Europe would rise up and exterminate
us. Hence I had not taken the C.B., nor the V.C., nor
any other alphabetical glories. In a word, Drayton, I
got her into that frame of restlessness and fever in which
all belief smacks of foolish credulity, and the common
est exercise of trust seems like the indulgence of a
superstition.
“All this time no inention of Loyd, not a hint of his
existence. Yesterday, however, came a fellow here, a
certain Mr. Stockwell, with a note of introduction from

Loyd, calling him my intimate friend S., whom you have
doubtless heard of as a most successful photographer.
He is going to India with a commission from the Queen,'
&c. We had him to dinner, and made him talk, as all
such fellows are ready to talk, about themselves and
the fine people who employ them. In the evening
we had his portfolio and the peerage, and so delighted
was the vulgar dog to have got into the land of
coronets and strawberry-leaves, that he would have ig-
nored Loyd if I had not artfuliy brought him to his re-
collection ; but he came to the memory of poor Joe,' as
he called him, with such a compassionating pity, that I
actually grew to like him. He had been at the vicarage,
too, and saw its little homely ways and small economies;
and I laughed so heartily at his stupid descriptions and
vapid jokes, that I made the ass think he was witty, and
actually repeat them. All this time imagine Florry, pale
as a corpse, or scarlet, either half fainting or in a fever,
dying to burst in with an angry indignation, and yet re-
strained by maiden bashfulness. She could bear no more
by eleven o'clock, and went off to bed under pretence of
a racking headache.
“ It is a great blow at any man's favour in a woman's
esteem when you show up his particular friend, his near
intimate; and certes, I did not spare Stockwell. You

for some powers in playing it.

meant for her. Her excuses have amazed me; because,
after my last night's success, and the sorry figure I had
succeeded in presenting L. to her, I half hoped my own
chances might be looking up. In fact, though I have
been playing a waiting game so patiently, to all appear-
ance, I am driven half mad by self restraint. Come what
may, I must end this; besides, to day is the fourth : on
the tenth the steamer from Alexandria will touch at
Malta ; L. Will therefore be at Leghorn by the four-
teenth, and here two days after—that is to say, in
twelve days more my siege must be raised. If I
were heavily ironed in a felon's cell with the day of my
execution fixed, I could not look to the time with one-
half the heart-sinking I now feel.
“I'd give—what would I not give ?—to have you near
me, though in my soul I know all that you'd say; how
you'd preach never minding, letting be, and the rest of it,
just as if I could cut out some other work for myself to-
morrow, and think no more of her. But I cannot. No
Drayton, I cannot. Is it not too hard for the fellow
who cut his way through Lahore with sixteen followers,
and made a lane through her Majesty's light cavalry, to
be worsted, defeated, and disgraced by a young girl, who
has neither rank, riches, nor any remarkable beauty to
her share, but is simply sustained by the resolve that
she'll not have me? Mind, D., I have given her no op-
portunity of saying this since I came last here: on the
contrary, she would, if questioned, be ready—I'd swear
to it she would—to say, “Calvert paid me no attentions,
nor made any court to me.' She is very truthful in every.
thing, but who is to say what her woman's instinct may
not have revealed to her of my love? Has not the wo-
man a man loves always a private key to his heart, and

curiosity, ten times a day? Not that she'd ever find a
great deal either in or on mine. Neither the indictments
for murder or manslaughter, nor that other heavier charge
for H. T., have left their traces within my pericardium,
and I could stand to back myself not to rave in a com-
promising fashion if I had a fever to-morrow. But how
hollow all this boasting, when that girl within the closed
window-shutter yonder defies me--ay, defies me! Is she
to go off to her wedding with the inner consciousness of
this victory? There's the thought that is driving me
mad, and will, I am certain, end by producing some dire
mischief—what the doctors call a lesion—in this unhappy
brain of mine. And now, as I sit here in listless idleness,
that other fellow is hastening across Egypt, or ploughing
his way through the Red Sea, to come and marry her!
I ask you, D., what amount of philosophy is required to
bear up under this ?
“I conclude I shall leave this some time next week-
not to come near England, though—for I foresee that it
will soon be out where, how, and with whom I have been
spending my holidays. Fifty fellows must suspect, and
some half-dozen must know all about it. America, I take
it, must be my ground-as well there as anywhere else
- but I can't endure a plan, so enough of this. Don't
write to me till you hear again, for I shall leave this cer-
tainly, though where for, not so certain.

“The old Grainger looks on me with aunt-like eyes.
She has seen a bracelet of carbuncles in dull gold,
the like of which Loyd could not give her were he to
sell justice for twenty years to come. I have hinted
that I mean them for my mother-in-law whenever I
marry, and she understands that the parentage admits
of a representative. All this is very ignoble on my
part; but if I knew of anything meaner that would
ensure me success, I'd do it also.
“What a stunning vendetta on this girl, if she were
at last to consent, to find out whom she had married,
and what. Think of the winter nights' tales, of the
charges that hang over me, and their penalties. Im-
agine the Hue and Cry as light reading for the honey-
moon!"
He added one line on the envelope, to say he would
write again on the morrow; but his promise he did
zot keep.

CHAPTER XXIII.
A STORM.
HE boat excursion mentioned in Calvert's letter
was not the only pleasure-project of that day.
It was settled that Mr. Stockwell should come
out and give Milly a lesson in photography, in which,
under Loyd's former guidance, she had already made
some progress. He was also to give Miss Grainger some
flower-seeds of a very rare kind, of which he was carrying
a store to the Pasha of Egypt, and which required some
peculiar skill in the sowing. They were to dine, too, at a
little rustic house beside the lake; and, in fact, the day
was to be one of festivity and enjoyment.
The morning broke splendidly; and though a few
clouds lingered about the Alpine valleys, the sky over the
lake was cloudless, and the water was streaked and
marbled with those parti-coloured lines which Italian
lakes wear in the hot days of midsummer. It was one
of those autumnal mornings in which the mellow colour-
ing of the mature season blends with the soft air and
gentle breath of spring, and all the features of landscape
are displayed in their fullest beauty. Calvert and Flor-
ence were to visit the Isola de San Giulio, and bring back
great clusters of the flowers of the “San Guiseppe” trees,
to deck the dinner-table. They were also to go on as
far as Pella for ice or snow to cool their wine, the voyage
being, as Calvert said, a blending of the picturesque with
the profitabļe.

Before breakfast was over the sky grew slightly over-
cast, and a large mass of dark cloud stood motionless
over the summit of Monterone.
“What will the weather do, Carlo ?” asked Calvert of
the old boatman of the villa, as he came to say that all was
in readiness.
“Who knows, 'cellenza ?” said he, with a native shrug
of the shoulders. “Monterone is a big traitor of a moun-
tain, and there's no believing him. If that cloud scatters,
the day will be fine ; if the wind brings down fresh clouds
from the Alps it will come on a 'burrasca.'”
“Always a burrasca; how I am sick of your burrasca,"
said he, contemptuously. “ If you were only once in
your life to see a real storm, how you'd despise those
petty jobbles, in which rain and sleet play the loudest
part.”
“What does he say of the weather ?” asked Florence,
who saw that Calvert had walked on to a little point
with the old man, to take a freer view of the lake.
“He says, that if it neither blows hard nor rains, it will
probably be fine. Just what he has told us every day
since I came here."
“What about this fine trout that you spoke of,
Carlo?"
“It is at Gozzano, 'cellenza; we can take it as we
go by.”
“But we are going exactly in the opposite direction,
my worthy friend; we are going to the island, and to
Pella.”
“That is different," said the old man, with another
shrug of the shoulders.
"Didn't you hear thunder? I'm sure I did," cried
Miss Grainger.
“ Up yonder it's always growling,” said Calvert, puint-

ing towards the Simplon. “It is the first welcome
travellers get when they pass the summit."
“Have you spoken to him, Milly, about Mr. Stockwell?
Will he take him up at Orta, and land him here?” asked
Miss Grainger, in a whisper.
“No, aunt; he hates Stockwell, he says. Carlo can
take the blue boat and fetch him. They don't want
Carlo, it seems."
“And are you going without a boatman, Florry ?"
asked her aunt.
“Of course we are. Two are quite cargo enough in
that small skiff, and I trust I am as skilful a pilot as any
Ortese fisherman,” broke in Calvert.
“Oh, I never disputed your skill, Mr. Calvert.”
“What, then, do you scruple to confide your niece to
me ?” said he, with a low whisper, in which the tone was
more menace than mere inquiry. “Is this the first time
we have ever gone out in a boat together ? ".
She muttered some assurance of her trustfulness, but
so confusedly, and with such embarrassment, as to be
scarcely intelligible. “There ! that was certainly thunder !*
she cried.
“There are not three days in three months in this
place without thunder. It is the Italian privilege, I
take it, to make always more noise than mischief.”
“But will you go if it threatens so much ?” said Miss
Grainger.
“ Ask Florry. For my part, I think the day will be a
glorious one."
“I'm certain it will,” said Florence, gaily; "and I
quite agree with what Harry said last night. Disputing
about the weather has the same effect as firing great
guns : it always brings down the rain.”
Calvert smiled graciously at hearing himself quoiecte

It was the one sort of flattery he liked the best, and it
rallied him out of his dark humour. “Are you ready?"

self in time-perhaps, indeed, not completely in time-
for she blushed, as she said, “Eccomi.”
The sisters affectionately embraced each other. Emily
even ran after Florence to kiss her once again, after part-
ing, and then Florry took Calvert's arm, and hastened
away to the jetty. “I declare,” said she, as she stepped
into the boat, “ this leave-taking habit, when one is going
out to ride, or to row, or to walk for an hour, is about
the stupidest thing I know of.”
“I always said so. It's like making one's will every
day before going down to dinner. It is quite true you
may chance to die before the dessert, but the mere pos-
sibility should not interfere with your asking for soup.
No, no, Florry, you are to steer; the tiller is yours for
to-day; my post is here ;” and he stretched himself at
the bottom of the boat, and took out his cigar. The
light breeze was just enough to move the little lateen
sail, and gradually it filled out, and the skiff stole quietly
away from shore, without even a ripple on the water.
“ What's the line, Florry? “Hope at the helm, pleasure
at the prow,' or is it love at the helm ?”
“A bad steersman, I should say; far too capricious,"
cried she, laughing.
“I don't know. I think he has one wonderful at-
tribute ; he has got wings to fly away with whenever the
boat is in danger, and I believe it is pretty much what
love does always."
“Can't say,” said she, carelessly. “Isn't that a net
yonder ? Oughtn't we to steer clear of it?”
“ Yes. Let her fall off—50—that's enough. What a
nice light hand you have."

“On a horse they tell me my hand is very light.”
“How I'd like to see you on my Arab 'Said. Such
a creature ! so large-eyed, and with such a full nostril,
the face so concave in front, the true Arab type, and the
jaw a complete semicircle. How proud he'd look under
you, with that haughty snort he gives, as he bends his
knee. He was the present of a great Rajah to me-one
of those native fellows we are graciously pleased to call
rebels, because they don't fancy to be slaves. Two years
ago he owned a territory about the size of half Spain, and
he is now something like a brigand chief, with a few hun-
dred followers.”
“Dear Harry, do not talk of India—at least not of the
mutiny."
“Mutiny! Why call it mutiny, Florry? Well, love,
I have done,” he muttered, for the word escaped him, and
he feared how she might resent it.
“ Come back to my lightness of hand.”
"Or of heart, for I sorely suspect, Florence, the quality
is not merely a manual one."
“Am I steering well ?”
“Perfectly. Would that I could sail on and on for
cver thus :
Over an ocean just like this,
A life of such untroubled bliss."
Calvert threw in a sentimental glance with this quota-
tion.
“In other words, an existence of nothing to do,"
said she, laughing, “ with an excellent cigar to be-
guile it."
“Well, but ‘ladye faire,' remember that I have earned
some repose. I have not been altogether a carpet
tonight. I have had my share of lance and spear,

and amongst fellows who handle their weapons
neatly."
“You are dying to get back to Ghoorkas and Sikhs ;
but I won't have it. I'd rather hear Metastasio or
Petrarch, just now."
“What if I were to quote something apposite, though
it were only prose — something out of the Promessi
Sposi ?"
She made no answer, and turned away her head.
“Put up your helm a little : let the sails draw freely.
This is very enjoyable; it is a right royal luxury. I'm not
sure Antony ever had his galley steered by Cleopatra;
had he?"
“I don't know; but I do know that I am not Cleopatra
nor you Antony."
“How readily you take one up for a foolish speech, as
if these rambling indiscretions were not the soul of such
converse as ours. They are like the squalls, that only
serve to increase our speed and never risk our safety,
and, somehow, I feel to-day as if my temper was all of
that fitful and capricious kind. I suppose it is the over-
happiness. Are you happy, Florry?” asked he, after a
pause.
“If you mean, do I enjoy this glorious day and our
sail, yes, intensely. Now, what am I to do? The sail is
flapping in spite of me."
“Because the wind has chopped round, and is coming
from the eastward. Down your helm, and let her find
her own way. We have the noble privilege of not caring
whither. How she spins through it now."
“It is immensely exciting," said she, and her colour
heightened as she spoke.
“Have you superstitions about dates ?” he asked, after
another pause.

"No; I don't think so. My life has been so unever
ful. Few days record anything memorable. But why,
did you ask?"
“I am-I am a devout believer in lucky and unlucky
days, and had I only bethought me this was a Friday,
I'd have put off our sail till to-morrow.”
“It is strange to see a man like you attach importance
to these things."
“And yet it is exactly men like me who do so.
Superstitions belong to hardy, stern, rugged races, like
the northmen, even more than the natives of southern
climes. Too haughty and too self-dependent to ask
counsel from others like themselves, they seek advice in
the occult signs and faint whispers of the natural world.
Would you believe it, that I cast a horoscope last night
to know if I should succeed in the next project I under-
took ?”
“And what was the answer?"
“ An enigma to this purpose : that if what I undertook
corresponded with the entrance of Orion into the seventh
house-- Why are you laughing?”
“Is it not too absurd to hear such nonsense from
you?"
“Was it not the grotesque homage of the witch made
Macbeth a murderer? What are you doing, child ?
Luff-luff up; the wind is freshening."
“I begin to think there should be a more skilful hand
on the tiller. It blows freshly now.”
“In three days more, Florence,” said he gravely, “it
will be exactly two years since we sailed here all alone.
Those two years have been to me like a long, long life, so
much of danger and trouble and suffering have been com-
passed in them. Were I to tell you all, you'd own that
few men could have borne my burden without being

crushed by it. It was not death in any common shape
that I confronted; but I must not speak of this. What
I would say is, that through all the perils I passed, one
image floated before me—one voice was in my ear. It
was yours.”
“Dear Harry, let me implore you not to go back to
these things."
“I must, Florence-I must,” said he, still more sadly.
“If I pain you, it is only your fair share of suffering."
“ My fair share! And why ?”.
“For this reason. When I knew you first, I was a
worn-out, weary, heart-sick man of the world. Young as
I was, I was weary of it all; I thought I had tasted of
whatever it had of sweet or bitter. I had no wish to
renew my experiences. I felt there was a road to go,
and I began my life-journey without interest, or anxiety
or hope. You taught me otherwise, Florence; you re-
vived the heart that was all but cold, and brought it back
to life and energy; you inspired me with high ambitions
and noble desires ; you gave confidence where there had
been distrust, and hope where there had been indifference."
“There, there !” cried she, eagerly; “there comes
another squall. You must take the helm ; I am getting
frightened.”
“You are calmer than I am, Florence dearest. Hear
me out. Why, I ask you—why call me back to an ex-
istence which you intended to make valueless to me ?
Why ask me to go a road where you refuse to journey?"
“Do come here! I know not what I am doing. And
see, it grows darker and darker over yonder !”
“You steered me into stormier waters, and had few
compunctions for it. Hear me out, Florence. For you
I came back to a life that I ceased to care for ; for you I
took on me cares, and dangers, and crosses, and con.

quered them all; for you I won honours, high rewards,
and riches, and now I come to lay them at your feet, and
say, “Weigh all these against the proofs of that other
man's affection. Put into one scale these successes, won
alone for you ; these trials, these wounds—and into the
other some humdrum letters of that good-enough creature,
who is no more worthy of you than he has the courage to
declare it.""
As he spoke a clap of thunder, sharp as a cannon-shot,
broke above their heads, and a squall struck the boat
aloft, bending her over till she half filled with water,
throwing at the same time the young girl from her place
to the lee-side of the boat.
Lifting her up, Calvert placed her on the seat, while
he supported her with one arm, and with the other hand
grasped the tiller.
“Is there danger ?” whispered she faintly.
“No, dearest, none. I'll bale out the water when the
wind lulls a little. Sit close up here, and all will be
well."
The boat, however, deeply laden, no longer rose over
the waves, but dipped her bow and took in more water
at every plunge.
“Tell me this hand is mine, my own dearest Florence
-mine for ever, and see how it will nerve my arm. I
am powerless if I am hopeless. Tell me that I have
something to live for, and I live." .
“Oh, Harry, is it when my heart is dying with
fear that you ask me this? Is it generous—is it fair ?
There ! the sail is gone! the ropes are torn across."
“It is only the jib, darling, and we shall be better
without it. Speak, Florence ! say it is my own wife I
am saving—not the bride of that man, who, if he were
here, would be at your feet in craven terror this instarit."

“There goes the mast !”.
At the word the spar snapped close to the thwart and
fell over the side, carrying the sail with it. The boat
now lay with one gunwale completely under water, help-
less and water-logged. A wild shriek burst from the girl,
who thought all was lost.
“Courage, dearest-courage ! she'll float still. Hold
close to me and fear nothing. It is not Loyd's arm that
you have to trust to, but that of one who never knew
terror !"
The waves surged up now with every heaving of the
boat, so as to reach their breasts, and, sometimes striking
on the weather-side, broke in great sheets of water over
them.
“ Oh, can you save us, Harry—can you save us?"
cried she.
“Yes, if there's aught worth saving," said he, sternly.
“ It is not safety that I am thinking of; it is what is to
come after. Have I your promise? Are you mine?".
“Oh! do not ask me this; have pity on me.”
“Where is your pity for me? Be quick, or it will be
too late. Answer me—mine or his?”
: “His to the last !” cried she, with a wild shriek; and
clasping both her hands above her head, she would have
fallen had he not held her.
“ One chance more. Refuse me, and I leave you to
your fate !” cried he, sternly.
She could not speak, but in the agony of her terror she
threw her arms around and clasped him wildly. The
dark dense cloud that rested on the lake was rent
asuinder by a flash of lightning at the instant, and a
sound like a thousand great guns shook the air. The
wind skimming the sea, carried sheets of water along
and alınost submerged the boat as they passed.

A Rent in a Cloud.
“Yes or no !” shouted Calvert, madly, is he struggled
to disengage himself from her grasp.
“No!” she cried, with a wild yell that rung above all
the din of the storm, and as she said it he threw her
arms wide and flung her from him. Then, tearing off his
coat, plunged into the lake.
The thick clouds as they rolled down from the Alps to
meet the wind, settled over the lake, making a blackness
almost like night, and only broken by the white flashes
of the lightning. The thunder rolled out as it alone
does in these mountain regions, where the echoes keep
on repeating till they fill the very air with their deafening
clamour. Scarcely was Calvert a few yards from the
boat than he turned to swim back to her, but already was
she hid from his view. The waves ran high, and the
drift foam blinded him at every instant. He shouted out
at the top of his voice; he screamed “Florence !
Florence !” but the din around drowned his weak efforts,
and he could not even hear his own words. With his
brain mad by excitement, he fancied every instant that
he heard his name called, and turned, now hither, now
thither, in wild confusion. Meanwhile, the storm
deepened, and the wind smote the sea with frequent
claps, sharp and sudden as the rush of steam from some
great steam-pipe. Whether his head reeled with the ter-
rible uproar around, or that his mind gave way between
agony and doubt, who can tell ? He swam madly on
and on, breasting the waves with his strong chest, and
lost to almost all consciousness, save of the muscular
effort he was making-none saw him more !
The evening was approaching, the storm had subsided,
and the tall Alps shone out in all the varied colours of

rock, or herbage, or snow-peak; and the blue lake at the
foot, in its waveless surface, repeated all their grand out-
lines and all their glorious tints. The water was covered
with row-boats in every direction, sent out to seek for
Florence and her companion. They were soon perceived
to cluster round one spot, where a dismasted boat lay
half-filled with water, and a figure, as of a girl sleeping,
lay in the stern, her head resting on the gunwale. It was
Florence, still breathing, still living, but terror-stricken,
lost to all consciousness, her limbs stiffened with cold.
She was lifted into a boat and carried on shore.
Happier for her the long death-like sleep—that lasted
for days-than the first vague dawn of consciousness,
when her senses returning, brought up the terrible
memory of the storm, and the last scene with Calvert.
With a heart-rending cry for mercy she would start up in
bed, and, before her cry had well subsided, would come
the consciousness that the peril was past, and then,
with a mournful sigh, would she sink back again to try
and regain sufficient self-control to betray nothing ; not
even of him who had deserted her.
Week after week rolled by, and she made but slow
progress towards recovery. There was not, it is true,
what the doctors could pronounce to be malady_her
heightened pulse alone was feverish—but a great shock
had shaken her, and its effects remained in an utter
apathy and indifference to everything around her.
She wished to be alone — to be left in complete
solitude, and the room darkened. The merest stir or
movement in the house jarred on her nerves and irritated
her, and with this came back paroxysms of excitement
that recalled the storm and the wreck. Sad, therefore,
and sorrowful to see as were the long hours of her dreary
apathy, they were less painful than these intervals of

acute sensibility; and between the two her mind
vibrated.
One evening about a month after the wreck, Emiy
came down to her aunt's room to say that she had been
speaking about Joseph to Florry. “I was telling her
how he was detained at Calcutta, and could not be here
before the second mail from India ; and her reply was,
"It is quite as well. He will be less shocked when he
sees me.' "
“Has she never asked about Calvert?" asked the old
lady.
“Never. Not once. I half suspect, however, that she
overheard us that evening when we were talking of him,
and wondering that he had never been seen again. For
she said afterwards, ‘Do not say before me what you
desire me not to hear, for I hear frequently when I am
unable to speak, or even make a sign in reply.""
“But it is strange that nothing should ever be known
of him."
“No, aunt. Carlo says several have been drowned in
this lake whose bodies have never been found. He has
some sort of explanation, about deep currents that set in
amongst the rocks at the bottom, which I could not
understand.”
The days dragged on as before. Miss Grainger, after
some struggles about how to accomplish the task, took
courage, and wrote to Miss Sophia Calvert, to inform her
of the disastrous event which had occurred and the loss
of her cousin. The letter was, however, left without any
acknowledgment whatever, and save in some chance
whisperings between Emily and her aunt, the name of
Calvert was never spoken of again.
Only a few days before Christmas a telegram told them
that Loyd had reached Trieste, and would be with them

in a few days. By this time Florence had recovered much
of her strength and some of her looks. She was glad,
very glad to hear that Joseph was coming ; but her joy
was not excessive. Her whole nature seemed to have
been toned down by that terrible incident to a state of
calm resignation to accept whatever came with little of
joy or sorrow; to submit to rather than partake of, the
changeful fortunes of life. It was thus Loyd found her
when he came, and, to his thinking, she was more charm-
ing, more lovable than ever. The sudden caprices, which
so often had worried him, were gone, and in their place
there was a gentle tranquillity of character which suited
every trait of his own nature, and rendered her more
than ever companionable to him. Warned by her aunt
and sister to avoid the topic of the storm, he never
alluded to it in any shape to Florence; but one evening,
as, after a long walk together, she lay down to rest before
tea-time, he took Milly's arm and led her into the garden.
“She has told me all, Milly," said he, with some
emotion ; "at least, all that she can remember of that
terrible day.”

CHAPTER XXIV.
THE LAST AND THE SHORTEST.
OYD was married to Florence; and they went
9 to India, and in due time—even earlier than
V due time—he was promoted from rank to rank
till he reached the dignity of chief judge of a district, a
position which he filled with dignity and credit.
Few were more prosperous in all the relations of their
alves. They were fortunate in almost everything, even to
their residence near Simlah, on the slope of the Himalaya:
they seemed to have all the goods of fortune at their feet.
In India, where hospitality is less a virtue than a custom,
Loyd's house was much frequented, his own agreeable
manners, and the charming qualities of his wife, had
given them a wide-spread notoriety, and few journeyed
through their district without seeking their acquaintance.
“You don't know who is coming here to dinner,
to-day, Florry," said Loyd, one morning at breakfast;
“ some one you will be glad to see, even for a memory
of Europe—Stockwell."
“Stockwell? I don't remember Stockwell.”
“Not remember him? And he so full of the charming
reception you gave him at Orta, where he photographed
the villa, and you and Emily in the porch, and Aunt
Grainger washing her poodle in the flower-garden ? "
“Oh, to be sure I do, but he would never let us have

a copy of it, he was so afraid Aunt Grainger would take,
it ill; and then he went away very suddenly; if I mis-
take not, he was called off by telegram on the very day
he was to dine with us."
Perhaps he'll have less compunctions now that your
aunt is so unlikely to see herself so immortalised. I'm to
go over to Behasana to fetch him, and I'll ask if he has
a copy."
His day's duties over, Loyd went across to the camp
where his friend Stockwell was staying. He brought him
back, and the photographs were soon produced.
“My wife," said Loyd, "wishes to see some of her old
Italian scenes. Have you any of those you took in
Italy ? "
“Yes, I have some half-dozen yonder. There they
are, with their names on the back of them. This was
the little inn you recommended me to stop at, with the
vine terrace at the back of it. Here, you see the clump
of cypress-trees next the boat-house."
“Ay, but she wants a little domestic scene at the villa,
with her aunt making the morning toilet of her poodle.
Have you got that?”.
“To be sure I have; and—not exactly as a pendant
to it, for it is terrific rather than droll—I have got a
storm-scene that I took the morning I came away. The
horses were just being harnessed, for I received a tele-
gram informing me I must be at Ancona two days earlier
than I looked for to catch the Indian mail, and I was
taking the last view before I started. I was in a tre-
mendous hurry, and the whole thing is smudged and
scarce distinguishable. It was the grandest storm I ever
witnessed. The whole sky grew black, and seemed to
descend to meet the lake, as it was lashed to fury by the

wind. I had to get a peasant to hold the instrument for
me as I caught one effect-merely one. The moment
was happy, it was just when a great glare of lightning
burst through the black mass of cloud, and lit up the
centre of the lake, at the very moment that a dismasted
boat was being drifted along to, I suppose, certain de-
struction. Here it is, and here are, as well as I can
make out, two figures. They are certainly figures, blurred
as they are, and that is clearly a woman clinging to a
man who is throwing her off: the action is plainly that.
I have called it a Rent in a Cloud."
“Don't bring this to-day, Stockwell,” said Loyd, as the
cold sweat burst over his face and forehead ; “and when
you talk of Orta to my wife, say nothing of the Rent in a
Claul"im

ST. PATRICK'S EVE.
THE FIRST ERA.
O T was on the 16th of March, the eve of St. Patrick,
32 not quite twenty years ago, that a little village.
K y on the bank of Lough Corrib was celebrating
in its annual fair “the holy times,” devoting one day to
every species of enjoyment and pleasure, and on the
next, by practising prayers and penance of various kinds,
as it were to prepare their minds to resume their worldly
duties in a frame of thought more seemly and becoming.
If a great and wealthy man might smile at the humble
preparations for pleasure displayed on this occasion, he
could scarcely scoff at the scene which surrounded them.
The wide valley, encircled by lofty mountains, whose
swelling outlines were tracked against the blue sky, or
mingled gracefully with clouds, whose forms were little
less fantastic and wild. The broad lake, stretching away
into the distance, and either lost among the mountain-

Galway: a few, and but very few, islands marked its sur-

for twenty persons; such were once, doubtless, the full
number of converts to the faith who frequented there.
There was a wild and savage grandeur in the whole : the
very aspect of the mountains proclaimed desolation, and
seemed to frown defiance at the efforts of man to subdue
them to his use; and even the herds of wild cattle seemed
to stray with caution among the cliffs and precipices of
this dreary region. Lower down, however, and as if in
compensation of the infertile tract above, the valley was
marked by patches of tillage and grassland, and studded
with cottages; which, if presenting at a nearer inspection
indubitable signs of poverty, yet to the distant eye bespoke
something of rural comfort, nestling as they often did be-
neath some large rock, and sheltered by the great turf-
stack, which even the poorest possessed. Many streams
wound their course through this valley; along whose
borders, amid a pasture brighter than the emerald, the
cattle grazed, and there, from time to time, some peasant
child sat fishing as he watched the herd.
Shut in by lake and mountain, this seemed a little.
spot apart from all the world ; and so, indeed, its inhabit-
ants found it. They were a poor but not unhappy race
of people, whose humble lives had taught them nothing
of the comforts and pleasures of richer communities. Po-
verty had, from habit, no terrors for them; short of actual
want, they never felt its pressure heavily.
Such were they who now were assembled to celebrate
the festival of their Patron Saint. It was drawing towards
evening; the sun was already low, and the red glare that
shone from behind the mountains showed that he was
near his setting. The business of the fair was almost con-
cluded; the little traffic so remote a region could supply,
the barter of a few sheep, the sale of a heifer, a moun-
tain pony, or a flock of goats, had all passed off, and

now the pleasures of the occasion were about to succeed.
The votaries to amusement, as if annoyed at the prom
tracted dealings of the more worldly minded, were some-
what rudely driving away the cattle that still continues
to linger about; and pigs and poultry were beginning to
discover that they were merely intruders. The canvas
booths, erected as shelter against the night-air, were be-
coming crowded with visitors; and from more than one
of the number the pleasant sounds of the bagpipe might
now be heard, accompanied by the dull shuffling tramp of
heavily-shod feet.
Various shows and exhibitions were also in prepara-
tion, and singular announcements were made by gentle-
men in a mingled costume of Turk and Thimble-rigger,
of “wonderful calves with two heads;" “six-legged
pigs ;” and an “infant of two years old that could drink
a quart of spirits at a draught, if a respectable company
were assembled to witness it ;”—a feat which, for the
honour of young Ireland, it should be added, was ever
postponed from a deficiency in the annexed condition.
Then there were “ restaurants” on a scale of the most
primitive simplicity, where boiled beef, or "spoleen,” was
sold from a huge pot, suspended over a fire in the open
air, and which was invariably surrounded by a gourmand
party of both sexes; gingerbread and cakes of every
fashion and every degree of indigestion also abounded;
while jugs and kegs flanked the entrance to each tent,
reeking with a most unmistakable odour of that prime
promoter of native drollery and fun-poteen. All was
stir, movement, and bustle ; old friends, separated since
the last occasion of a similar festivity, were embracing
cordially, the men kissing with an affectionate warmth
no German ever equalled ; pledges of love and friendship
were taken in brimming glasses by many, who were

perhaps to renew the opportunity for such testimonies
hereafter, by a fight that very evening ; contracts ratified
by whisky, until that moment not deemed binding ; and
courtships, prosecuted with hopes, which the whole year
previous had never suggested; kind speeches and words
of welcome went round; while here and there some closely-
gathered heads and scowling glances gave token, that
other scores were to be acquitted on that night than
merely those of commerce; and in the firmly knitted
brow, and more firmly grasped blackthorn, a practised
observer could foresee, that some heads were to carry
away deeper marks of that meeting, than simple memory
can impress ;—and thus, in this wild sequestered spot,
human passions were as rife as in the most busy com-
munities of pampered civilisation. Love, hate, and hope,
charity, fear, forgiveness, and malice; long-smouldering
revenge, long-subdued affection; hearts pining beneath
daily drudgery, suddenly awakened to a burst of pleasure
and a renewal of happiness in the sight of old friends,
for many a day lost sight of; words of good cheer; half
mutterings of menace; the whispered syllables of love;
the deeply-uttered tones of vengeance; and amid all, the
careless reckless glee of those, who appeared to feel the
hour one snatched from the grasp of misery, and de-
voted to the very abandonment of pleasure. It seemed
in vain that want and poverty had shed their chilling
influence over hearts like these. The snow-drift and
the storm might penetrate their frail dwellings; the win-
ter might blast, the hurricane might scatter their humble
hoardings; but still the bold high-beating spirit that lived
within, beamed on throughout every trial; and now, in
the hour of long-sought enjoyment, blazed forth in a
Aame of joy, that was all but frantic.

ground, now smote the earth with a proud beat, that told
of manhood's daring; the voices were high, the eyes were
flashing ; long pent-up emotions of every shade and com-
plexion were there; and it seemed a season where none
should wear disguise, but stand forth in all the fearless-
ness of avowed resolve ; and in the heart-home looks of
love, as well as in the fiery glances of hatred, none prac-
tised concealment. Here, went one with his arm round
his sweetheart's waist, an evidence of accepted affection
none dared even to stare at; there, went another, the skirt
of his long loose coat thrown over his arm, in whose
hand a stick was brandished—his gesture, even without
his wild hurroo ! an open declaration of battle, a challenge
to all who liked it. Mothers were met in close conclave,
interchanging family secrets and cares; and daughters,
half conscious of the parts they themselves were playing
in the converse, passed looks of sly intelligence to each
other. And beggars were there too-beggars of a class
which even the eastern Dervish can scarcely vie with :
cripples brought many a mile away from their mountain-
homes to extort charity by exhibitions of dreadful de-
formity; the halt, the blind, the muttering idiot, the
moping melancholy mad, mixed up with strange and mot-
ley figures in patched uniforms and rags—some, amusing
the crowd by their drolleries, some, singing a popular
ballad of the time—while through all, at every turn and
every corner, one huge fellow, without legs, rode upon an
ass, his wide chest ornamented by a picture of himself,
and a paragraph setting forth his infirmities. He, with
a voice deeper than a bassoon, bellowed forth his prayer
for alms, and seemed to monopolise far more than his
proportion of charity, doubtless owing to the more art.

grims, some with heads venerable enough for the canvas
of an old master, with flowing beards, and relics hung
round their necks, objects of worship which failed not to
create sentiments of devotion in the passers-by. But among
these many sights and sounds, each calculated to appeal
to different classes and ages of the motley mass, one ob-
ject appeared to engross a more than ordinary share of
attention; and although certainly not of a nature to draw
marked notice elsewhere, was here sufficiently strange
and uncommon to become actually a spectacle. This
was neither more nor less than an English groom, who,
mounted upon a thoroughbred horse, led another by
the bridle, and slowly paraded backwards and forwards,
in attendance on his master.
“Them's the iligant bastes, Darby," said one of the
bystanders, as the horses moved past. “A finer pair than
that I never seen."
“They're beauties, and no denying it,” said the other;
"and they've skins like a looking-glass.”
“Arrah, botheration t' yez! what are ye saying about
their skins?” cried a third, whose dress and manner be-
tokened one of the rank of a small farmer. "'Tis the
breeding that's in 'em ; that's the raal beauty. Only look
at their pasterns; and see how fine they run off over the
quarter."
“Which is the best now, Phil?" said another,
addressing the last speaker with a tone of some defer-
ence.
“The gray horse is worth two of the dark chestnut,"
replied Phil oracularly.
"Is he, then?” cried two or three in a breath. “Why
is that, Phil ?"

“Can't you perceive the signs of blood about the ears?
They're long, and coming to a point--"
“ You're wrong this time, my friend,” said a sharp
voice, with an accent which in Ireland would be called
English. “You may be an excellent judge of an ass, but
the horse you speak of, as the best, is not worth a fourth
part of the value of the other." And so saying, a young
and handsome man, attired in a riding costume, brushed
somewhat rudely through the crowd, and seizing the rein
of the led horse, vaulted lightly into the saddle and rode
off, leaving Phil to the mockery and laughter of the crowd,
whose reverence for the opinion of a gentleman was only
beneath that they accorded to the priest himself.
“Faix, ye got it there, Phil!” “'Tis down on ye he
was that time !” “Musha, but ye may well get red in the
face!”
Such and such-like were the comments on one who
but a moment before was rather a popular candidate
for public honours.
“Who is he, then, at all ?” said one among the rest,
and who had come up too late to witness the scene.
“ 'Tis the young Mr. Leslie, the landlord's son, that's
come over to fish the lakes,” replied an old man rever-
entially. -
6. Begorra, he's no landlord of mine, anyhow," said
Phil, now speaking for the first time. “I hould under
Mister Martin, and his family was here before the Leslies
was heard of.” These words were said with a certain air
of defiance, and a turn of the head around him, as though
to imply, that if any one would gainsay the opinion, he
was ready to stand by and maintain it. *lappily for the
peace of the particular moment, the crowd were nearly
all Martins, and so, a simple buzz of approbation fol-
lowed this announcement. Nor did their attention dwell

much longer on the matter, as most were already occu-
pied in watching the progress of the young man, who, at
a fast swinging gallop, had taken to the fields beside the
lake, and was now seen flying in succession over each
dyke and wall before him, followed by his groom. The
Irish passion for feats of horsemanship made this the
most fascinating attraction of the fair; and already,
opinions ran high among the crowd, that it was a race
between the two horses, and more than one maintained,
that “the little chap with the belt” was the better horse
man of the two. At last, having made a wide circuit of
the village and the green, the riders were seen slowly
moving down, as if returning to the fair.
There is no country where manly sports and daring
exercises are held in higher repute than Ireland. The
chivalry that has died out in richer lands still reigns
there; and the full meed of approbation will ever be his,
who can combine address and courage before an Irish
crowd. It is needless to say, then, that many a word of
praise and commendation was bestowed on young Leslie.
His handsome features, his slight but well-formed figure,
every particular of his dress and gesture, had found an
advocate and an admirer; and while some were lavish
in their epithets on the perfection of his horsemanship,
others, who had seen him on foot, asserted, “that it
was then he looked well entirely.” There is a kind of
epidemic character pertaining to praise. The snow-ball
gathers not faster by rolling, than do the words of eulogy
and approbation; and so now, many recited little anec-
dotes of the youth's father, to show that he was a very
pattern of landjords and country gentlemen, and had
only one fault in life,—that he never lived among his
tenantry.
“'Tis the first time I ever set eyes on him,” cried one

"and I hould my little place under him twenty-three years
come Michaelmas."
“See now then, Barney," cried another, “I'd rather
have a hard man that would stay here among us, than
the finest landlord ever was seen that would be away
from us. And what's the use of compassion and pity
when the say would be between us? 'Tis the agent we
have to look to.”
“Agent! 'Tis wishing them, I am, the same agents !
Them's the boys has no marcy for a poor man: I'm tould
now”—and here the speaker assumed a tone of oracular
seriousness that drew several listeners towards him-
“ I'm tould now, the agents get a guinea for every man,
woman, and child they turn out of a houldin.” A low
murmur of indignant anger ran through the group, not
one of whom ventured to disbelieve a testimony thus
accredited.
"And sure when the landlords does come, divil a bit
they know about us — no more nor if we were in
Swayden ; didn't I hear the ould gentleman down there
last summer, pitying the people for the distress. 'Ah,'
says he, 'it's a hard sayson ye have, and obliged to tear
the flax out of the ground, and it not long enough to
cut!'"
A ready burst of laughter followed this anecdote, and
many similar stories were recounted in corroboration of
the opinion.
“That's the girl takes the shine out of the fair," said
one of the younger men of the party, touching another
by the arm, and pointing to a tall young girl, who, with
features as straight and regular as a classic model, moved
slowly past. She did not wear the scarlet cloak of the
peasantry, but a large one of dark blue, lined with silk
of the same colour; a profusion of brown hair, dark and

glossy, was braided on each side of her face, and turned
up at the back of the head with the grace of an antique
cameo. She seemed not more than nineteen years of age,
and in the gaze of astonishment and pleasure she threw
around her, it might be seen how new such scenes and
sights were to her.
“That's Phil Joyce's sister, and a crooked disciple of
a brother she has," said the other ; “sorra bit if he'd
ever let her come to the pattern’ afore to-day; and
she's the raal ornament of the place now she's in it.”
"Just mind Phil, will ye! watch him now; see the
frown he's giving the boys as they go by, for looking at
his sister. I wouldn't coort a girl that I couldn't look
in the face and see what was in it, av she owned Ballina:
hinch Castle," said the former.
“There now; what is he at now?” whispered the
other; "he's left her in the tent there: and look at him,
the way he's talking to ould Bill; he's telling him some-
thing about a fight; never mind me agin, but there'll be
'wigs on the green' this night.”
“I don't know where the Lynches and the Connors is
to-day,” said the other, casting a suspicious look around
him, as if anxious to calculate the forces available in the
event of a row. “They gave the Joyces their own in
Ballinrobe last fair. I hope they're not afeard to come
down here.”
“Sorra bit, ma bouchal,” said a voice from behind his
shoulder; and at the same moment the speaker clapped
his hands over the other's eyes : “who am I, now?"
“Arrah! Owen Connor; I know ye well,” said the
other; "and 'tis yourself ought not to be here to-day.
The ould father of ye has nobody but yourself to look
after him."
“ ['d like to see ye call him ould to his face,” said

Owen, laughing :"there he is now, in Poll Dawley's tent
dancing."
“Dancing !” cried the other two in a breath.
“ Aye, faix, dancing “The little bould fox;' and may
I never die in sin, if he hasn't a step that looks for all
the world as if he made a hook and eye of his legs.”
The young man who spoke these words was in mould
and gesture the very ideal of an Irish peasant of the west ,
somewhat above the middle size, rather slightly made, but
with the light and neatly turned proportion that betokens
activity, more than great strength, endurance, rather than
the power of any single effort. His face well became the
character of his figure; it was a handsome and an open
one, where the expressions changed and crossed each
other with lightning speed, now, beaming with good
nature, now, flashing in anger, now, sparkling with some
witty conception, or frowning a bold defiance as it met
the glance of some member of a rival faction. He looked,
as he was, one ready and willing to accept either part
from fortune, and to exchange friendship and hard knocks
with equal satisfaction. Although in dress and appear-
ance he was both cleanly and well clad, it was evident
that he belonged to a very humble class among the
peasantry. Neither his hat nor his greatcoat, those un-
erring signs of competence, had been new for many a
day before; and his shoes, in their patched and mended
condition, betrayed the pains it had cost him to make
even so respectable an appearance as he then presented.
“She didn't even give you a look to-day, Owen,” said
one of the former speakers; "she turned her head the
other way as she went by.”
“Faix, I'm afeard ye’ve a bad chance," said the other,
slily.
"Joke away, boys, and welcome,” said Owen, redden.

ing to the eyes as he spoke, and showing that his indiffer-
ence to their banterings was very far from being real; “'tis
little I mind what ye say,-as little as she herself would
mind me,” added he to himself.
“She's the purtiest girl in the town-land, and no second
word to it,—and even if she hadn't a fortune--"
“Bad luck to the fortune !—that's what I say," cried
Owen, suddenly; "'tis that same that breaks my rest
night and day; sure if it wasn't for the money, there's
many a dacent boy wouldn't be ashamed nor afeard to go
up and coort her."
“She'll have two hundred, divil a less, I'm tould," in-
terposed the other; "the ould man made a deal of money
in the war-time.”
“I wish he had it with him now," said Owen, bitterly.
“By all accounts he wouldn't mislike it himself. When
Father John was giving him the rites, he says, 'Phil,' says
he, ‘how ould are ye now?' and the other didn't hear
him, but went on muttering to himself; and the priest
says agin, “'Tis how ould you are, I'm axing.' 'A hun-
dred and forty-three,' says Phil, looking up at him. “The
saints be good to us,' says Father John, “sure you're not
that ould,—a hundred and forty-three?' 'A hundred and
forty-seven.' 'Phew! he's more of it a hundred and
forty-seven!' 'A hundred and fifty,' cries Phil, and he
gave the foot of the bed a little kick, this way—sorra
more-and he died; and what was it but the guineas
he was countin' in a stocking under the clothes all the
while ? Oh, musha ! how the sowl was in the money,
and he going to leave it all! I heerd Father John say,
‘it was well they found it out, for there'd be a curse on
them guineas, and every hand that would touch one of
them in secla seclorum;' and they wer' all tuck away in a

ment."
Just as the story came to its end, the attention of the
group was drawn off by seeing numbers of people running
in a particular direction, while the sound of voices and
the general excitement showed something new was going
forward. The noise increased, and now, loud shouts
were heard, mingled with the rattling of sticks and the
utterance of those party cries so popular in an Irish fair.
The young men stood still as if the affair was a mere
momentary ebullition not deserving of attention, nor
sufficiently important to merit the taking any farther
interest in it; nor did they swerve from the resolve thus
tacitly formed, as from time to time some three or four
would emerge from the crowd, leading forth one, whose
bleeding temples, or smashed head, made retreat no
longer dishonourable.
“They're at it early," was the cool commentary of
Owen Connor, as with a smile of superciliousness he
looked towards the scene of strife.
“The Joyces is always the first to begin,” remarked
one of his companions.
“And the first to lave off too,” said Owen ; “two to
one is what they call fair play.”
“ That's Phil's voice !—there now, do you hear him
shouting?" .
“ 'Tis that he's best at,” said Owen, whose love for the
pretty Mary Joyce was scarcely equalled by his dislike of
her ill-tempered brother.
At this moment the shouts became louder and wilder,
the screams of the women mingling with the uproar; which
no longer seemed a mere passing skirmish, but a down-
right severe engagement.
* What is it all about, Christy ?” said Owen, to a

young fellow led past between two friends, while the
track of blood marked every step he went.
“ 'Tis well it becomes yez to ax," muttered the other,
with his swollen and pallid lips, “when the Martins is
beating your landlord's eldest son to smithereens.”
“Mr. Leslie-young Mr. Leslie ? ” cried the three to-
gether; but a wild war-whoop from the crowd gave the
answer back. “Hurroo! Martin for ever! Down with
the Leslies ! Ballinashough! Hurroo! Don't leave one
of them livin! Beat their sowles out!"
“Leslie for ever !” yelled out Owen, with a voice
heard over every part of the field; and with a spring into
the air, and a wild flourish of his stick, he dashed into
the crowd.
“Here's Owen Connor, make way for Owen;" cried
the non-combatants, as they jostled and parted each other,
to leave a free passage for one whose prowess was well
known.
“He'll lave his mark on some of yez yet!” “That's
the boy will give you music to dance to !” “Take that,
Barney!” “Ha! Tarry, that made your nob ring like a
forty-shilling pot !” Such and suck-like were the comments
on him who now, reckless of his own safety, rushed madly
into the very midst of the combatants, and fought his way
onwards to where some seven or eight were desperately
engaged over the fallen figure of a man. With a shrill
yell no Indian could surpass, and a bound like a tiger,
Owen came down in the midst of them, every stroke of
his powerful blackthorn telling on his man as unerringly
as though it were wielded by the hand of a giant.
“Save the young Master, Owen! Shelter him! Stand
over him, Owen Connor !” were now the cries from all
sides; and the stout-hearted peasant, striding over the
body of young Leslie, cleared a space around him, and, as

he glanced defiance on all sides, called out, “Is that you.
courage, to beat a young gentleman that never handled a
stick in his life? Oh, you cowardly set! Come and face
the men of your own barony if you dare! Come out on
the green and do it !—Pull him away, pull him away
quick," whispered he to his own party eagerly. “Tear-
an-ages! get him out of this before they're down on me."
As he spoke, the Joyces rushed forward with a cheer,
their party now trebly as strong as the enemy. They
bore down with a force that nothing could resist. Poor
Owen—the mark for every weapon-fell almost the first,
his head and face one indistinguishable mass of blood
and bruises, but not before some three or four of his
friends had rescued young Leslie from his danger, and
carried him to the outskirts of the fair. The fray now
became general, neutrality was impossible, and self-defence
almost suggested some participation in the battle. The
victory was, however, with the Joyces. They were on
their own territory; they mustered every moment stronger;
and in less than half-an-hour they had swept the enemy
from the field, save where a lingering wounded man re-
mained, whose maimed and crippled condition had
already removed him from all the animosities of combat.
“Where's the young master ?'” were the first words
Owen Connor spoke, as his friends carried him on the
door of a cabin, hastily unhinged for the purpose, towards
his home.
“Erra! he's safe enough, Owen," said one of his
bearers, who was by no means pleased that Mr. Leslie
had made the best of his way out of the fair, instead of
remaining to see the fight out.
“God be praised for that same, anyhow !” said Owen
piously. “His life was not worth a 'trawneen' when
seen him first.”

“It may be supposed from this speech, and the pre-
vious conduct of him who uttered it, that Owen Connor
was an old and devoted adherent to the Leslie family,
from whom he had received many benefits, and to whom
he was linked by long acquaintance. Far from it. He
neither knew Mr. Leslie nor his father. The former he
saw for the first time as he stood over him in the fair ;
the latter he had never so much as set eyes upon, at any
time ; neither had he or his been favoured by them. The
sole tie that subsisted between them—the one link that
bound the poor man to the rich one—was that of the
tenant to his landlord. Owen's father and grandfather
before him had been cottiers on the estate ; but being
very poor and humble men, and the little farm they
rented, a half-tilled half-reclaimed mountain tract, exempt
from all prospect of improvement, and situated in a
remote and unfrequented place, they were merely known
by their names on the rent-roll. Except for this, their
existence had been as totally forgotten, as though they
had made part of the wild heath upon the mountain.
While Mr. Leslie lived in ignorance that such people
existed on his property, they looked up to him with a
degree of reverence almost devotional. The owner of the
soil was a character actually sacred in their eyes; for what
respect and what submission were enough for one, who
held in his hands the destinies of so many; who could
raise them to affluence, or depress them to want, and by
his mere word control the agent himself, the most dreaded
of all those who exerted an influence on their fortunes ?
There was a feudalism, too, in this sentiment that gave
the reverence a feeling of strong allegiance. The land-
lord was the head of a clan, as it were: he was the cul-
minating point of that pyramid of which they formed the
base; and they were proud of every display of his wealth

259
and his power, which they deemed as ever reflecting credit
upon themselves. And then, his position in the county-
his rank_his titles—the amount of his property—his
house—his retinue-his very equipage, were all subjects
on which they descanted with eager delight, and proudly
exalted in contrast with less favoured proprietors. At the
time we speak of absenteeism had only begun to impair
the warmth of this affection; the traditions of a resident
landlord were yet fresh in the memory of the young ; and
a hundred traits of kindness and good-nature were mingled
in their minds with stories of grandeur and extravagance,
which, to the Irish peasant's ear, are themes as grateful
as ever the gorgeous pictures of Eastern splendour were
to the heightened imagination and burning fancies of
Oriental listeners.
Owen Connor was a firm disciple of this creed. Per-
haps his lone sequestered life among the mountains, with
no companionship save that of his old father, had made
him longer retain these convictions in all their force, than
if, by admixture with his equals, and greater intercourse
with the world, he had conformed his opinions to the
gradually changed tone of the country. It was of little
moment to him what might be the temper or the habits
of his landlord. The monarchy—and not the monarch
of the soil—was the object of his loyalty; and he would
have deemed himself disgraced and dishonoured had
he shown the slightest backwardness in his fealty. He
would as soon have expected that the tall fern that grew
wild in the valley should have changed into a blooming
crop of wheat, as that the performance of such a service
could have met with any requital. It was, to his thinking,
a simple act of duty, and required not any prompting
of high principle, still less any suggestion of self-interest.
Poor Owen, therefore, had not even a sentiment of

heroism to cheer him, as they pore him slowiy along,
every inequality of the ground sending a pang through
his aching head that was actually torture.
“That's a mark you'll carry to your dying day, Owen,
my boy,” said one of the bearers, as they stopped for a
moment to take breath. “I can see the bone there shin-
ing this minute."
“It must be good stuff anyways the same head," said
Owen, with a sickly attempt to smile. “They never put
a star in it yet; and faix I seen the sticks cracking like
dry wood in the frost.”
“It's well it didn't come lower down,” said another,
examining the deep cut, which gashed his forehead from
the hair down to the eyebrow. “You know what the
Widow Glynn said at Peter Henessy's wake, when she
saw the stroke of the scythe that laid his head open-it
just come, like yer own, down to that—'Ayeh !' says
she, “but he's the fine corpse; and wasn't it the Lord
spared his eye!""
“Stop, and good luck to you, Freney, and don't be
making me laugh; the pain goes through my brain like
the stick of a knife," said Owen, as he lifted his trem-
bling hands and pressed them on either side of his
head.
They wetted his lips with water, and resumed their
way, not speaking aloud as before, but in a low under-
tone, only audible to Owen at intervals; for he had sunk
into a half-stupid state, they believed to be sleep. The
path each moment grew steeper; for, leaving the wild
“boreen ” road, which led to a large bog on the mountain-
side, it wound now upwards, zigzagging between masses of
granite rock and deep tufts of heather, where sometimes .
the foot sunk to the instep. The wet and spongy soil
increased the difficulty greatly; and although all strong

and powerful men, they were often obliged to halt and
rest themselves.
“It's an iligant view, sure enough,” said one, wiping
his dripping forehead with the tail of his coat. “See
there ! look down where the fair is, now! it isn't the size
of a good griddle, the whole of it. How purty the lights
look shining in the water !”
“And the boats, too! Musha ! they're coming up more
of them. There'll be good divarshin there, this night."
These last words, uttered with a half sigh, showed with
what a heavy heart the speaker saw himself debarred from
participating in the festivity.
"'Twas a dhroll place to build a house then, up
there," said another, pointing to the dark speck, far, far
away on the mountain, where Owen Connor's cabin
stood.
“Owen says yez can see Galway of a fine day, and the
boats going out from the Claddagh; and of an evening,
when the sun is going down, you'll see across the bay,
over to Clare, the big cliffs of Mogher.”.
“Now, then ! are ye in earnest? I don't wonder he's
so fond of the place after all. It's an iligant thing to
see the whole world, and fine company besides. Look at
Lough Mask! Now, boys, isn't that beautiful with the
sun on it?”
“Come, it's getting late, Freney, and the poor boy
ought to be at home before night;” and once more they
lifted their burden and moved forward.
For a considerable time they continued to ascend with-
out speaking, when one of the party in a low cautious
voice remarked, “Poor Owen will think worse of it, when
he hears the reason of the fight, than for the cut on the
head-bad as it is.”
* Musha; then he needn't,” replied another ; " for if

ye mane about Mary Joyce, he never had a chance of
her.”
“I'm not saying that he had," said the first speaker ;
“ but he's just as fond of her ; do you mind the way he
never gave back one of Phils blows, but let him hamner
away as fast as he plazed ? "
“What was it at all, that Mr. Leslie did?” asked an-
other; “I didn't hear how it begun yet."
“Nor I either, rightly; but I believe Mary was standing
looking at the dance, for she never foots a step herself-
maybe she's too ginteel—and the young gentleman comes
up and axes her for a partner; and something she said;
but what does he do, but put his arm round her waist
and gives her a kiss; and, ye see, the other girls laughed
hearty, because they say Mary's so proud and high, and
thinking herself above them all. Phil wasn't there at the
time; but he heerd it afterwards, and come up to the
tent, as young Mr. Leslie was laving it, and stood before
him and wouldn't let him pass. “I've a word to say to
ye,' says Phil, and he scarce able to spake with passion ;
that was my sister ye had the impudence to take a li-
berty with.' 'Out of the way, ye bogtrotter,' says Leslie;

trotter, or I'll lay my whip across your shoulders.' "Take
that first,' says Phil; and he put his fist between his
two eyes, neat and clean ;-down went the squire as if he
was shot. You know the rest yourselves. The boys
didn't lose any time, and if 'twas only two hours later,
maybe the Joyces would have got as good as they gave.”
A heavy groan from poor Owen now stopped the con-
versation, and they halted to ascertain if he were worse-
but no; he seemed still sunk in the same heavy sleep as
before, and apparently unconscious of all about him.
Such, however, was not really the case; by some strange

phenomenon of sickness, the ear had taken in each low
and whispered word, at the time it would have been deaf
to louder sounds; and every syllable they had spoken had
already sunk deeply into his heart; happily for him, this
was but a momentary pang; the grief stunned him at
once, and he became insensible.
It was dark night as they reached the lonely cabin
where Owen lived, miles away from any other dwelling,
and standing at an elevation of more than a thousand feet
above the plain. The short, sharp barking of a sheep-dog
was the only sound that welcomed them ; for the old man
tad not heard of his son's misfortune until long after they
quitted the fair. The door was hasped and fastened with
a stick; precaution enough in such a place, and for all
that it contained, too. Opening this, they carried the
young man in, and laid him upon the bed ; and, while
some busied themselves in kindling a fire upon the hearth,
the others endeavoured, with such skill as they possessed,
to dress his wounds, an operation which, if not strictly
surgical in all its details, had at least the recommendation
of tolerable experience in such matters.
“It's a nate little place when you're at it, then," said
one of them, as with a piece of lighted bog-pine he took
a very leisurely and accurate view of the interior
The opinion, however, must be taken by the reader, as
rather reflecting on the judgment of him who pronounced
it, than in absolute praise of the object itself. The cabin
consisted of a single room, and which, though remarkably
clean in comparison with similar ones, had no evidence
of anything above very narrow circumstances. A little
dresser occupied the wall in front of the door, with its
usual complement of crockery, cracked and whole; an
old chest of drawers, the pride of the house, flanked this
on one side ; a low settle-bed on the other; various prints

in very florid colouring decorated the walls, all religious
subjects, where the apostles figured in garments like
bathing-dresses; these were intermixed with ballads, dying
speeches, and such-like ghostly literature, as form the most
interesting reading of an Irish peasant; a few seats of un-
painted deal, and a large straw.chair for the old man, were
the principal articles of furniture. There was a gun, minus
the lock, suspended over the fireplace; and two fishing-
rods, with a gaff and landing-net, were stretched upon
wooden pegs; while over the bed was an earthenware
crucifix, with its little cup beneath, for holy water; the
whole surmounted by a picture of St. Francis Xavier in
the act of blessing somebody : though, if the gesture were
to be understood without the explanatory letter-press, he
rather looked like a swimmer preparing for a dive. The
oars, mast, and spritsail of a boat were lashed to the raf-
ters overhead; for, strange as it may seem, there was a
lake at that elevation of the mountain, and one which
abounded in trout and perch, affording many a day's
sport to both Owen and his father.
Such were the details which, sheltered beneath a warm
roof of mountain-fern, called forth the praise we have
· mentioned; and, poor as they may seem to the reader,
they were many degrees in comfort beyond the majority
of Irish cabins.
The boys—for so the unmarried men of whatever age
are called—having left one of the party to watch over
Owen, now quitted the house, and began their return
homeward. It was past midnight when the old man re-
turned ; and although endeavouring to master any appear.

difficulty control his feelings on beholding his son. The

startings as he slept--were all sore trials to the old man's
nerve; but he managed to seem calm and collected, and
to treat the occurrence as an ordinary one.
“Harry Joyce and his brother Luke—big Luke as they
call him-has sore bones to-night; they tell me that Owen
didn't lave breath in their bodies," said he with a grim
smile, as he took his place by the fire.
“I heerd the ribs of them smashing like an ould turf
creel,” replied the other.
“'Tis himself can do it,” said the old fellow, with eyes
glistening with delight; "fair play and good ground, and
' I'd back him agin the Glen.”
“And so you might, and farther too ; he has the speret
in him—that's better nor strength, any day.”
And thus consoled by the recollection of Owen's
prowess, and gratified by the hearty concurrence of his
guest, the old father smoked and chatted away till day-
break. It was not that he felt any want of affection for
his son, or that his heart was untouched by the sad
spectacle he presented-far from this; the poor old man
had no other tie to life—no other object of hope or love
than Owen; but years of a solitary life had taught him
rather to conceal his emotions within his own bosom, than
seek for consolation beyond it; besides that, even in his
grief the old sentiment of faction-hatred was strong, and
vengeance had its share in his thoughts also.
It would form no part of our object in this story, to
dwell longer either on this theme, or the subject of Owen's
illness; it will be enough to say, that he soon got better,
far sooner perhaps than if all the appliances of luxury
had ministered to his recovery; most certainly sooner
than if his brain had been ordinarily occupied by thoughts
and cares of a higher order than his were. The con.
flict, however, had left a deeper scar behind than the

ghastly wound that marked his brow. The poor fellow
dwelt upon the portions of the conversation he over-
heard as they carried him up the mountain ; and what-
ever might have been his fears before, now he was con-
vinced that all prospect of gaining Mary's love was lost
to him for ever.
This depression, natural to one after so severe an
injury, excited little remark from the old man; and al-
though he wished Owen might make some effort to exert
himself, or even move about in the air, he left him to
himself and his own time, well knowing that he never
was disposed to yield an hour to sickness, beyond what
he felt unavoidable.
It was about eight or nine days after the fair, that
the father was sitting mending a fishing-net at the door
of his cabin, to catch the last light of the fading day.
Owen was seated near him, sometimes watching the pro-
gress of the work, sometimes patting the old sheep-dog
that nestled close by, when the sound of voices attracted
them : they listened, and could distinctly hear persons
talking at the opposite side of the cliff, along which the
pathway led; and before they could even hazard a guess
as to who they were, the strangers appeared at the angle
of the rock. The party consisted of two persons; one,
a gentleman somewhat advanced in life, mounted on a
stout but rough-looking pony—the other, was a country.
man, who held the beast by the bridle, and seemed to
take the greatest precaution for the rider's safety.
The very few visitors Owen and his father met with
were for the most part people coming to fish the moun-
tain-lake, who usually hired ponies in the valley for the
ascent; so that when they perceived the animal coming
slowly along, they scarce bestowed a second glance upon
them, ihe old man merely remarking, “They're three

weeks too early for this water, any how;" a sentiment
concurred in by his son. In less than five minutes after
the rider and his guide stood before the door.
“Is this where Owen Connor lives?” asked the gen-
tleman.
“That same, yer honour," said old Owen, uncovering
his head, as he rose respectfully from his low stool.
“And where is Owen Connor himself ?”.
66 'Tis me, Sir," replied he; “ that's my name.”
“ Yes, but it can scarcely be you that I am looking
for; have you a son of that name ?"
“Yes, Sir, I'm young Owen," said the young man,
rising, but not without difficulty; while he steadied him-
self by holding the door-post.
“So then I am all right: Tracy, lead the pony about,
till I call you ;" and so saying, he dismounted and en-
tered the cabin.
“Sit down, Owen; yes, yes -I insist upon it, and
do you also. I have come up here to-day to have a
few moments talk with you about an occurrence that
took place last week at the fair. There was a young
gentleman, Mr. Leslie, got roughly treated by some of
the people : let me hear your account of it.”
Owen and his father exchanged glances; the same idea
flashed across the minds of both, that the visitor was a
magistrate come to take information against the Joyces
for an assault; and however gladly they would have em-
braced any course that promised retaliation for their in-
juries, the notion of recurring to the law was a degree of
baseness they would have scorned to adopt.
“I'll take the 'vestment' I never seen it at all,” said
the old man eagerly, and evidently delighted that no
manner of cross-questioning or badgering could convert
him into an informer,

St. Patrick's Eve.
“And the little I saw,” said Owen, " they knocked out
of my memory with this ;” and he pointed to the half-
healed gash on his forehead.
“But you know something of how the row begun ?”
“No, yer honour, I was at the other side of the fair."
“Was young Mr. Leslie in fault-did you hear that?"
“I never heerd that he did any thing—unagreeable,"
said Owen, after hesitating for a few seconds in his choice
of a word.
“So then, I'm not likely to obtain any information from
either of you."
They made no reply, but their looks gave as palpable
a concurrence to this speech, as though they swore to its
truth.
“Well, I have another question to ask. It was you
saved this young gentleman, I understand; what was
your motive for doing so ? when, as by your own confes-
sion, you were at a distance when the fight begun.”
“He was my landlord's son," said Owen, half roughly;
“I hope there is no law agin that.”
“I sincerely trust not,” ejaculated the gentleman ;
" have you been long on the estate ?"
“Three generations of us now, yer honour," said the
old man.
“And what rent do you pay ?”
“Oh, musha, we pay enough! we pay fifteen shillings
an acre for the bit of callows below, near the lake, and
we give ten pounds a year for the mountain-and bad
luck to it for a mountain—it's breaking my heart trying
to make something out of it.”
“Then I suppose you'd be well pleased to exchange
your farm, and take one in a better and more profitabl:
part of the country p"

mind; and turning to Owen he said in Irish : “He
wants to get the mountain for sporting cver ; but I'll
not lave it."
The gentleman repeated his question.
“ Troth, no then, yer honour; we've lived here so long
we'll just stay our time in it.”
“But the rent is heavy, you say."
“Well, we'll pay it, plaze God.”
“And I'm sure it's a strange wild place in winter."
" It's wholesome, any how," was the short reply.
“I believe I must go back again as wise as I came,"
muttered the gentleman. “Come, my good old man,-
and you, Owen ; I want to know how I can best serve
you, for what you've done for me : it was my son you
rescued in the fair—-".
“ Are you the landlord—is yer honour Mr. Leslie ?”
exclaimed both as they rose from their seats as horrified
as if they had taken such a liberty before royalty.
“Yes, Owen ; and I grieve to say, that I should cause
so much surprise to any tenant, at seeing me. I ought
to be better known on my property ; and I hope to be-
come so: but it grows late, and I must reach the valley
before night. Tell me, are you really attached to this
farm, or have I any other, out of lease at this time, you
like better?"
“I would not leave the ould spot, with yer honour's
permission, to get a demesne and a brick house ; nor
Owen neither."
“Well, then, be it so; I can only say, if you ever
change your mind, you'll find me both ready and willing
to serve you; meanwhile you must pay no more rent
here."
“ No more rent !"
“Not a farthing ; I'm sorry the favour is so slight a

one, for indeed the mountain seems a bleak and profit
less tract.”
“There is not its equal for mutton "
“ I'm glad of it, Owen ; and it only remains for me to
make the shepherd something more comfortable ;-
well, take this; and when I next come up here, which I
intend to do, to fish the lake, I hope to find you in a
better house ;” and he pressed a pocket-book into the
old man's hand as he said this, and left the cabin : while
both Owen and his father were barely able to mutter a
blessing upon him, so overwhelming and unexpected was
the whole occurrence.

THE SECOND ERA.
ROM no man's life, perhaps, is hope more
rigidly excluded than from that of the Irish
y peasant of a poor district. The shipwrecked
mariner upon his raft, the convict in his cell, the linger-
ing sufferer on a sick bed, may hope; but he must not.
Daily labour, barely sufficient to produce the com-
monest necessaries of life, points to no period of rest or
repose; year succeeds year in the same dull routine of
toil and privation ; nor can he look around him and see
one who has risen from that life of misery, to a position
of even comparative comfort.
The whole study of his existence, the whole philosophy
of his life, is, how to endure; to struggle on under
poverty and sickness ; in seasons of famine, in times of
national calamity, to hoard up the little pittance for his
landlord and the payment for his priest, and he has no-
thing more to seek for. Were it our object here, it
would not be difficult to pursue this theme further, and
examine, if much of the imputed slothfulness and in-
dolence of the people was not in reality due to that very
hopelessness. How little energy would be left to life, if
you take away its ambitions; how few would enter upon
the race, if there were no goal before them! Our pre-
sent aim, however, is rather with the fortunes of those we

have so lately left. To these poor men, now, a new
existence opened. Not the sun of spring could more
suddenly illumine the landscape where winter so late
had thrown its shadows, than did prosperity fall brightly
on their hearts, endowing life with pleasures and en-
joyments, of which they had not dared to dream before.
In preferring this mountain-tract to some rich lowland
farm, they were rather guided by that spirit of attach-
ment to the home of their fathers—so characteristic a
trait in the Irish peasant—than by the promptings of
self-interest. The mountain was indeed a wild and
bleak expanse, scarce affording herbage for a few sheep
and goats; the callows at its foot, deeply flooded in
winter, and even by the rains of autumn, made tillage
precarious and uncertain ; yet the fact that these were
rent-free, that of its labour and its fruits all was now
their own, inspired hope and sweetened toil. They.no
longer felt the dreary monotony of daily exertion, by
which hour was linked to hour, and year to year, in one
unbroken succession ;-no; they now could look for-
ward, they could lift up their hearts and strain their eyes
to a future, where honest industry had laid up its store
for the decline of life; they could already fancy the en-
joyments of the summer season, when they should look
down upon their own crops and herds, or think of the
winter nights, and the howling of the storm without, re-
minding them of the blessings of a home
How little to the mind teeming with its bright and
ambitious aspirings would seem the history of their
humble hopes ! how insignificant and how narrow might
appear the little plans and plots they laid for that new
road in life, in which they were now to travel! The
great man might scoff at these, the moralist might frown
at their worldliness; but there is nothing sordid or mean

273
in the spirit of manly independence ; and they who know
the Irish people, will never accuse them of receiving
worldly benefits with any forgetfulness of their true and
only source. And now to our story.
The little cabin upon the mountain was speedily
added to, and fashioned into a comfortable-looking farm-
house of the humbler class. Both father and son would
willingly have left it as it was; but the landlord's wish
had laid a command upon them, and they felt it would
have been a misapplication of his bounty, had they not
done as he had desired. So closely, indeed, did they adhere
to his injunctions, that a little room was added specially
for his use and accommodation, whenever he came on
that promised excursion he hinted at. Every detail of
this little chamber interested them deeply; and many a
night, as they sat over their fire, did they eagerly discuss
the habits and tastes of the “ quality," anxious to be
wanting in nothing which should make it suitable for one
like him. Sufficient money remained above all this ex-
penditure to purchase some sheep, and even a cow; and
already their changed fortunes had excited the interest
and curiosity of the little world in which they lived.
There is one blessing, and it is a great one, attendant
on humble life. The amelioration of condition requires
not that a man should leave the friends and companions
he has so long sojourned with, and seek, in a new order,
others to supply their place; the spirit of class does not
descend to him, or rather, he is far above it; his altered
state suggests comparatively few enjoyments or comforts
in which his old associates cannot participate; and thus
the Connors' cabin was each Sunday thronged by the
country people, who came to see with their own eyes,
and hear with their own ears, the wonderful good for-
tune that befell them.

St. Patrick's Eve
Had the landlord been an angel of light, the blessings
invoked upon him could not have been more frequent or
fervent; each measured the munificence of the act by his
own short standard of worldly possessions; and in-
dividual murmurings for real or fancied wrongs were
hushed in the presence of one such deed of benevolence.
This is no exaggerated picture. Such was peasant-
gratitude once; and such, Olandlords of Ireland ! it
might still have been, if you had not deserted the
people. The meanest of your favours, the poorest show
of your good-feeling, were acts of grace for which no-
thing was deemed requital., Your presence in the poor
man's cabin—your kind word to him upon the highway
- your aid in sickness—your counsel in trouble, were
ties which bound him more closely to your interest, and
made him more surely yours, than all the parchments of
your attorney, or all the papers of your agent. He knew
you then as something more than the recipient of his
earnings. That was a time, when neither the hireling patriot
nor the calumnious press could sow discord between
you. If it be otherwise now, ask yourselves, are you all
blameless ? Did you ever hope that affection could be
transmitted through your agent, like the proceeds of your
property ? Did you expect that the attachments of a
people were to reach you by the post ? Or was it not
natural, that, in their desertion by you, they should seek
succour elsewhere ? that in their difficulties and their
trials they should turn to any who might feel or feign
compassion for them? Nor is it wonderful that, amid
the benefits thus bestowed, they should imbibe principles
and opinions fatally in contrast with interests like yours.
There were few on whom good fortune could have
fallen, without exciting more envious and jealous feelings
on the part of others, than on the Connors. The rugged

independent character of the father — the gay light-
hearted nature of the son, had given them few enemies
and many friends. The whole neighbourhood flocked
about them to offer their good wishes and congratula-
tions on their bettered condition, and with an honesty
of purpose and a sincerity that might have shamed a
more elevated sphere. The Joyces alone showed no
participation in this sentiment, or rather, that small frac-
tion of them more immediately linked with Phil Joyce.
At first, they affected to sneer at the stories of the
Connors' good fortune; and when denial became absurd,
they half-hinted that it was a new custom in Ireland for
men “to fight for money." These mocking speeches
were not slow to reach the ears of the old man and his
son; and many thought that the next fair-day would
bring with it a heavy retribution for the calamities of the
last. In this, however, they were mistaken. Neither
Owen nor his father appeared that day; the mustering
of their faction was strong and powerful, but they, whose
wrongs were the cause of the gathering, never came for-
ward to head them.
This was an indignity not to be passed over in silence;
and the murmurs, at first low and subdued, grew. louder
and louder, until denunciations heavy and deep fell upon
the two who “wouldn't come out and right themselves
like men." The faction, discomfited and angered, soon
broke up; and returning homeward in their several
directions, they left the field to the enemy without even
a blow. On the succeeding day, when the observances
of religion had taken place of the riotous and disorderly
proceedings of the fair, it was not customary for the
younger men to remain. The frequenters of the place
were mostly women; the few of the other sex were
either old and feeble men, or such objects of compassion

tunely evoked. It was with great difficulty the worthy
priest of the parish had succeeded in dividing the
secular from the holy customs of the time, and thus
allowing the pilgrims, as all were called on that day, an
uninterrupted period for their devotions. He was firm
and resolute, however, in his purpose, and spared no
pains to effect it: menacing this one-persuading that;
suiting the measure of his arguments to the comprehen-
sion of each, he either cajoled or coerced, as the circum-
stance might warrant. His first care was to remove all
the temptations to dissipation and excess; and for this
purpose, he banished every show and exhibition, and
every tent where gambling and drinking went forward ;-
his next, a more difficult task, was the exclusion of all
those doubtful characters, who, in every walk of life, are
suggestive of even more vice than they embody in them-
selves. These, however, abandoned the place, of their
own accord, so soon as they discovered how few were
the inducements to remain ; until at length, by a tacit
understanding, it seemed arranged, that the day of
penance and mortification should suffer neither molesta-
tion nor interruption from those indisposed to partake
of its benefits. So rigid was the priest in exacting com-
pliance in this matter, that he compelled the tents to be
struck by daybreak, except by those few, trusted and
privileged individuals, whose ministerings to human
wants were permitted during the day of sanctity.
And thus the whole picture was suddenly changed.
The wild and riotous uproar of the fair, the tumult of
voices and music, dancing, drinking, and fighting, were
gone; and the low monotonous sound of the pilgrims'
prayers was heard, as they moved along upon their knees
to some holy well or shrine, to offer up a prayer, or re-

was a strange and picturesque one; the long lines of
kneeling figures, where the rich scarlet cloak of the
women predominated, crossed and recrossed each other
as they wended their way to the destined altar; their
muttered words blending with the louder and more
boisterous appeals of the mendicants,—who, stationed
at every convenient angle or turning, besieged each
devotee with unremitting entreaty,—deep and heartfelt
devotion in every face, every lineament and feature im-
pressed with religious zeal and piety; but still, as group
met group going and returning, they interchanged their
greetings between their prayers, and mingled the worldly
salutations with aspirations heavenward, and their
“ Paters," and Aves,” and “Credos," were blended
with enquiries for the “childer," or questions about
the “ crops.”
“Isn't that Owen Connor, avich, that's going there,
towards the Yallow-well?” said an old crone as she
ceased to count her beads.
“You're right enough, Biddy; 'tis himself, and no
other ; it's a turn he took to devotion since he grew
rich."
“Ayeh! ayeh! the Lord be good to us! how fond we
all be of life, when we've the bit of bacon to the fore !”
And with that she resumed her pious avocations with
redoubled energy, to make up for lost time.
The old ladies were as sharp-sighted as such func-
tionaries usually are in any sphere of society. It was
Owen Connor himself, performing his first pilgrimage.
The commands of his landlord had expressly forbidden
him to engage in any disturbance at the fair; the only
mode of complying with which, he rightly judged, was
by absenting himself altogether. How this conduct was

construed by others, we have briefly hinted at. As for
himself, poor fellow, if a day of mortification could have
availed him any thing, he needn't have appeared among
the pilgrims ;--a period of such sorrow and suffering
he had never undergone before. But in justice it must
be confessed it was devotion of a very questionable cha-
racter that brought him there that morning. Since the
fair-day, Mary Joyce had never deigned to notice him ;
and though he had been several times at mass, she either
affected not to be aware of his presence, or designedly
looked in another direction. The few words of greeting
she once gave him on every Sunday morning—the smile
she bestowed-dwelt the whole week in his heart, and
made him long for the return of the time, when, even for
a second or two, she would be near, and speak to him.
He was not slow in supposing how the circumstances
under which he rescued the landlord's son might be used
against him by his enemies; and he well knew that she
was not surrounded by any others than such. It was,
then, with a heavy heart poor Owen witnessed how
fatally his improved fortune had dashed hopes far dearer
than all worldly advantage. Not only did the new com
forts about him become distasteful, but he even accused
them to himself as the source of all his present calamity;
and half suspected that it was a judgment on him for
receiving a reward in such a cause. To see her—to
speak to her if possible—was now his wish, morn and
night; to tell her that he cared more for one look, one
glance, than for all the favours fortune did or could
bestow; this, and to undeceive her as to any knowledge
of young Leslie's rudeness to herself, was the sole aim
of his thoughts. Stationing himself therefore in an angle
of the ruined church, which formed one of the resting-
places for prayer, he waited for hours for Mary's coming

and at last, with a heart half sickened with deferred hope,
he saw her pale but beautiful features, shaded by the
large blue hood of her cloak, as with downcast eyes she
followed in the train.
“Give me your place, acushla ; God will reward you
for it ; I'm late at the station,” said he, to an old ill-
favoured hag that followed next to Mary; and at the
same time, to aid his request, slipped half-a-crown into
her hand.
The wrinkled face brightened into a kind of wicked
intelligence as she muttered in Irish: “'Tis a gould
guinea the same place is worth ; but I'll give it to you
for the sake of yer people ;” and at the same time
pocketing the coin in a canvas pouch, among relics
and holy clay, she moved off, to admit him in the
line.
Owen's heart beat almost to bursting, as he found
himself so close to Mary; and all his former impatience
to justify himself, and to speak to her, fled in the happi-
ness he now enjoyed. No devotee ever regarded the
relic of a saint with more trembling ecstasy than did he
the folds of that heavy mantle that fell at his knees;
he touched it as men would do a sacred thing. The
live-long day he followed her, visiting in turn each shrine
and holy spot; and ever, as he was ready to speak to
her, some fear that, by a word, he might dispel the
dream of bliss he revelled in, stopped him, and he was
silent.
It was as the evening drew near, and the pilgrims
were turning towards the lake, beside which, at a small
thorn-tree, the last "station” of all was performed, that
an old beggar, whose importunity suffered none to
escape, blocked up the path, and prevented Mary from
proceeding until she had given him something. All her

money had been long since bestowed ; and she said so,

tary, and their eyes met. There are glances which reveal
the whole secret of a lifetime; there are looks which
dwell in the heart longer and deeper than words. Their
eyes met for merely a few seconds; and while in her
face offended pride was depicted, poor Owen's sorrow-
struck and broken aspect spoke of long suffering and
grief so powerfully, that, ere she turned away, her heart
had half forgiven him,
“You wrong me hardly, Mary,” said he, in a low,
broken voice, as the train moved on. “The Lord, he
knows my heart this blessed day! Pater noster, qui es in
cælis !” added he, louder, as he perceived that his in-
mediate follower had ceased his prayers to listen to him.
“ He knows that I'd rather live and died the poorest-
Beneficat tuum nomen !” cried he, louder. And then,
turning abruptly, said, -
“Av it's plazing to you, Sir, don't be trampin' on my
heels. I can't mind my devotions, an' one so near me.”
“It's not so unconvaynient, maybe, when they're afore
you," muttered the old fellow, with a grin of sly malice.
And though Owen overheard the taunt, he felt no incli-
nation to notice it.
"Four long years I've loved ye, Mary Joyce; and the
sorra more encouragement I ever got nor the smile ye
used to give me. And if ye take that from me, now-
Are ye listening to me, Mary? do ye hear me, asthore?
-Bad scran to ye, ye ould varmint ! why don't ye keep
behind ? How is a man to save his sowl, an' you making
him blasphame every minit ? ”

“I was only listenin' to that iligant prayer ye were
saying,” said the old fellow, drily.
“'Tis betther you'd mind your own, then," said Owen,
fiercely; “or, by the blessed day, I'll teach ye a new
penance ye never heerd of afore !”
The man dropped back, frightened at the sudden de-
termination these words were attered in; and Owen re-
sumed his place.
“I may never see ye again, Mary. 'Tis the last tinie
you'll hear me spake to you. I'll lave the ould man.
God look to him! I'll lave him now, and go be a sodger.
Here we are now, coming to this holy well ; and I'll swear
an oath before the Queen of Heaven, that before this time
to-morrow--"
“How is one to mind their prayers at all, Owen
Connor, if ye be talking to yourself, so loud ?" said
Mary, in a whisper, but one which lost not a syllable, as
it fell on Owen's ear.
“My own sweet darling, the light of my eyes, ye are !"
cried he, as with clasped hands he muttered blessings
upon her head; and with such vehemence of gesture,
and such unfeigned signs of rapture, as to evoke remarks
from some beggars near, highly laudatory of his zeal.
“ Look at the fine young man there, prayin' wid all
his might. Ayeh, the saints give ye the benefit of your
pilgrimage 1”
“ Musha ! but ye’r a credit to the station ; ye put yer
sowl in it, anyhow !” said an old Jezebel, whose hard
features seemed to defy emotion.
Owen looked up; and directly in front of him, with
his back against a tree, and his arms crossed on his breast,
stood Phil Joyce; his brow was dark with passion, and
his eyes glared like those of a maniac. A cold thrill ran
through Owen's heart, lest the anger thus displayed should

fall on Mary; for he well knew with what tyranny the
poor girl was treated. He therefore took the moment of
the pilgrims' approach to the holy tree, to move from
his place, and, by a slightly circuitous path, came up to
where Joyce was standing.
“ I've a word for you, Phil Joyce," said he, in a low
voice, where every trace of emotion was carefully sub-
dued. “Can I spake it to you here ?"
Owen's wan and sickly aspect, if it did not shock, it
at least astonished Joyce, for he looked at him for some
seconds without speaking ; then said, half rudely,–
“Ay, here will do as well as anywhere, since ye didn't
like to say it yesterday.”
There was no mistaking this taunt; the sneer on
Owen's want of courage was too plain to be misconstrued ;
and although for a moment he looked as if disposed to
resent it, he merely shook his head mournfully, and re-
plied : “ It is not about that I came to speak; it's about
your sister, Mary Joyce.”
Phil turned upon him a stare of amazement, as quickly
followed by a laugh, whose insulting mockery made
Owen's cheek crimson with shame.
“True enough, Phil Joyce ; I. know your meanin'
well,” said he, with an immense effort to subdue his pas-
sion. “I'm a poor cottier, wid a bit of mountain-land-
sorra more--and has no right to look up to one like
her. But listen to me, Phil,” and here he grasped his
arm, and spoke with a thick guttural accent : “ Listen to
me! Av the girl wasn't what she is, but only your sister,
I'd scorn her as I do yourself ;." and, with that, he pushed
him from him with a force that made him stagger. Be-
fore he had well recovered, Owen was again at his side,
and continued :—“And now, one word more, and all's
ended between us, ' For you, and your likings or mis-

likings, I never cared a rush; but 'tis Mary herself re-
fused me, so there's no more about it; only don't be
wreaking your temper on her, for she has no fault in it."
“Av a sister of mine ever bestowed a thought on the
likes o' ye, I'd give her the outside of the door this
night,” said Joyce, whose courage now rose from seeing
several of his faction attracted to the spot, by observing
that he and Connor were conversing. "'Tis a disgrace
- divil a less than a disgrace to spake of it!"
"Well, we won't do so any more, plaze God !” said
Owen, with a smile of very fearful meaning. “It will
be another little matter we'll have to settle when we meet
next. There's a score there not paid off yet :” and at
the word he lifted his hat, and disclosed the deep mark of
the scarce-closed gash on his forehead : “ and so, good-
bye to ye.”
A rude nod from Phil Joyee was all the reply, and
Owen turned homewards.
If prosperity could suggest the frame of mind to enjoy
it, the rich would always be happy; but such is not the
dispensation of Providence. Acquisition is but a stage on
the road of ambition; it lightens the way, but brings the
goal no nearer. Owen never returned to his mountain-
home with a sadder heart. He passed without regarding
them, the little fields, now green with the coming spring;
he bestowed no look nor thought upon the herds that
already speckled the mountain-side; disappointment had
embittered his spirit; and even love itself now gave way
to faction-hate, the old and cherished animosity of party
If the war of rival factions did not originally spring
from the personal quarrels of men of rank and station,
who stimulated their followers and adherents to acts of
aggression and reprisal, it assuredly was perpetuated, if
not with their concurrence, at least permission; and many

were not ashamed to avow, that in these savage encoun.
ters the “bad blood” of the country was "let out" at less
cost and trouble than by any other means. When legal
proceedings were recurred to, the landlord, in his capa-
city of magistrate, maintained the cause of his tenants ;
and, however disposed to lean heavily on them himself,
in the true spirit of tyranny he opposed pressure from
any other hand than his own. The people were grateful
for this advocacy-far more, indeed, than they often
proved for less questionable kindness. They regarded
the law with so much dread—they awaited its decisions
with such uncertainty—that he who would conduct them
through its mazes was indeed a friend. But, was the
administration of justice, some forty or fifty years back
in Ireland, such as to excite or justify other sentiments ?
Was it not this tampering with right and wrong, this
recurrence to patronage, that made legal redress seem an
act of meanness and cowardice among the people? No
cause was decided upon its own merits. The influence
of the great man—the interest he was disposed to take
in the case—the momentary condition of county politics
-with the general character of the individuals at issue,
usually determined the matter; and it could scarcely be
expected that a triumph thus obtained should have exer-
cised any peaceful sway among the people.
“He wouldn't be so bould to-day, av his landlord
wasn't to the fore,” was Owen Connor's oft-repeated re-
flection, as he ascended the narrow pathway towards his
cabin; “'tis the good backing makes us brave, God help
us !” From that hour forward the gay light-hearted pea-
sant became dark, moody, and depressed; the very cir-
cumstances which might be supposed calculated to have
suggested a happier frame of mind, only increased and
embittered his gloom. His prosperity made daily labour

no longer a necessity. Industry, it is true, would have
brought more comforts about him, and surrounded him
with more appliances of enjoyment; but long habits of
endurance had made him easily satisfied on this score,
and there were no examples for his imitation which should
make him strive for better. So far, then, from the land-
lord's benevolence working for good, its operation was
directly the reverse; his leniency had indeed taken away
the hardship of a difficult and onerous payment, but the
relief suggested no desire for an equivalent amelioration
of condition. The first pleasurable emotions of gratitude
over, they soon recurred to the old customs in everything,
and gradually fell back into all the observances of their
former state, the only difference being, that less exertion
on their parts was now called for than before.
Had the landlord been a resident on his property-
acquainting himself daily and hourly with the condition of
his tenants—holding up examples for their imitation-
rewarding the deserving—discountenancing the unworthy
-extending the benefits of education among the young,
and fostering habits of order and good conduct among all,
Owen would have striven among the first for a place of
credit and honour, and speedily have distinguished him-
self above his equals. But, alas ! no; Mr. Leslie, when
not abroad, lived in England. Of his Irish estates he
knew nothing, save through the half-yearly accounts of
his agent. He was conscious of excellent intentions; he
was a kind, even a benevolent man; and in the society
of his set, remarkable for more than ordinary sympathies
with the poor. To have ventured on any reflection on a
landlord before him, would have been deemed a down-
right absurdity.
He was a living refutation of all such calumnies; yet
how was it that, in the district he owned, the misery of

the people was a thing to shudder at? that there were
hovels excavated in the bogs, within which human beings
lingered on between life and death, their existence like
some terrible passage in a dream? that beneath these
frail roofs famine and fever dwelt, until suffering, and star-
vation itself, had ceased to prey upon minds on which
no ray of hope ever shone? Simply he did not know
of these things; he saw them not; he never heard of
them. He was aware that seasons of unusual distress oc-
curred, and that a more than ordinary degree of want was
experienced by a failure of the potato crop; but on these
occasions he read his name, with a subscription of a hun-
dred pounds annexed, and was not that a receipt in full
for all the claims of conscience? He ran his eyes over
a list in which royal and princely titles figured, and he
expressed himself grateful for so much. sympathy with
Ireland! But did he ask himself the question, whether
if he had resided among his people, such necessities for
alms-giving had ever arisen ? Did he enquire how far his
own desertion of his tenantry-his ignorance of their
state—his indifference to their condition-had fostered
these growing evils ? Could he acquit himself of the
guilt of deriving all the appliances of his ease and en-
joyment, from those whose struggles to supply them were
made under the pressure of disease and hunger? Was
unconsciousness of all this an excuse sufficient to stifle
remorse? Oh, it is not the moneyed wealth dispensed by
the resident great man; it is not the stream of affluence,
flowing in its thousand tiny rills, and fertilising as it
goes, we want. It is far more the kindly influence
of those virtues which find their congenial soil in easy
circumstances; benevolence, sympathy, succour in sick.

eager: these are gifts, which, giving, makes the bestowci
richer; and these are the benefits which, better than gold,
foster the charities of life among a people, and bind up
the human family in a holy and indissoluble league. No
benevolence from afar, no well wishings from distant
lands, compensate for the want of them. To neglect such
duties is to fail in the great social compact by which the
rich and poor are united, and, what some may deem
of more moment still, to resign the rightful influence
of property into the hands of dangerous and designing
men.
It is in vain to suppose that traditionary deservings
will elicit gratitude when the present generation are nego
lectful. On the contrary, the comparison of the once
resident, now absent landlord, excites very different feel-
ings; the murmurings of discontent swell into the louder
language of menace; and evils, over which no protective
power of human origin could avail, are ascribed to that
class, who, forgetful of one great duty, are now accused
of causing every calamity. If not present to exercise the
duties their position demands, their absence exaggerates
every accusation against them; and from the very men,
too, who have, by the fact of their desertion, succeeded
in obtaining the influence that should be theirs.
Owen felt this desertion sorely. Had Mr. Leslie been
at home, he would at once have had recourse to him.
Mr. French, the agent, lived on the property—but Mr.
French was “a hard man," and never liked the Connors;
indeed, he never forgave them for not relinquishing the
mountain-farm they held, in exchange for another he
offered them, as he was anxious to preserve the mountain
for his own shooting. At the time we speak of, intem-
perance was an Irish vice, and one which prevailed largely.

life. It cemented friendships and ratified contracts; it
celebrated the birth of the newly-born, it consoled the
weeping relatives over the grave of the departed; it was
a welcome and a bond of kindness, and as the stirrup-
cup, was the last pledge at parting. Men commemorated
their prosperity by drink, and none dared to face gloomy
fortune without it. Owen Connor had recourse to it, as
to a friend that never betrayed. The easy circumstances,
in comparison with many others, he enjoyed, left him
both means and leisure for such a course; and few days
passed without his paying a visit to the "shebeen-house"
of the village. If the old man noticed this new habit,
his old prejudices were too strong to make him prompt
in condemning it. Indeed, he rather regarded it as a
natural consequence of their bettered fortune, that Owen
should frequent these places; and as he never returned
actually drunk, and always brought back with him the
current rumours of the day, as gathered from news-
papers and passing gossip, his father relied on such
scraps of information for his evening's amusement over
the fire.
It was somewhat later than usual that Owen was re-
turning home one night, and the old man, anxious and
uneasy at his absence, had wandered part of the way to
meet him, when he saw him coming slowly forward, with
that heavy weariness of step deep grief and pre-occupa-
tion inspire. When the young man had come within
speaking distance of his father, he halted suddenly, and
looking up at him, exclaimed, “There's sorrowful news
for ye to-night, father ! ”
“I knew it ! I knew it well !” said the old man, as he
clasped his hands before him, and seemed preparing him-
self to bear the shock with courage. “I had a dhrame of
it last night; and 'tis death, wherever it is.”

“ You're right there. The master's dead !”
Not another word was spoken by either, as side by
side they slowly ascended the mountain-path. It was
only when seated at the fireside that Owen regained
sufficient collectedness to detail the particulars he had
learned in the village. Mr. Leslie had died of the cholera
at Paris. The malady had just broken out in that city,
and he was among its earliest victims. The terrors which
that dreadful pestilence inspired, reached every remote part
of Europe, and at last, with all the aggravated horrors of
its devastating career, swept across Ireland. The same
letter which brought the tidings of Mr. Leslie's death,
was the first intelligence of the plague. A scourge so
awful needed not the fears of the ignorant to exaggerate
its terrors; yet men seemed to vie with each other in
their dreadful conjectures regarding it.
All the sad interest the landlord's sudden death would
have occasioned under other circumstances was merged
in the fearful malady of which he died. Men heard with
almost apathy of the events that were announced as likely
to succeed, in the management of the property; and only
listened with eagerness if the pestilence were mentioned.
Already its arrival in England was declared; and the last
lingering hope of the devotee was, that the holy island
of St. Patrick might escape its ravages. Few cared to
hear what a few weeks back had been welcome news,
that the old agent was to be dismissed, and a new one
appointed. The speculations which once would have
been rife enough, were now silent. There was but one
terrible topic in every heart and on every tongue-the
cholera.
The inhabitants of great cities, with wide sources of
information available, and free conversation with each
other, can scarcely estimate the additional degree of terror

the prospect of a dreadful epidemic inspires among the
dwellers in unfrequented rural districts. The cloud, not
bigger than a man's hand at first,.gradually expands itself,
until the whole surface of earth is darkened by its shadow.
The business of life stands still; the care for the morrow
is lost; the proneness to indulge in the gloomiest antici-
pations common calamity invariably suggests, heightens the
real evil, and disease finds its victims more than doomed
at its first approach. In this state of agonising suspense,
when rumours arose to be contradicted, reasserted, and
again disproved, came the tidings that the cholera was in
Dublin. The same week it had broken out in many other
places; at last the report went, that a poor man, who had
gone into the market of Galway to sell his turf, was found
dead on the steps of the chapel. Then, foilowed the whole
array of precautionary measures, and advices, and boards
of health. Then, it was announced that the plague was
raging fearfully—the hospitals crowded-death in every
street.
Terrible and appalling as these tidings were, the fearful
fact never realised itself in the little district we speak of,
until a death occurred in the town close by. He was a
shopkeeper in Oughterarde, and known to the whole neigh-
bourhood. This solitary instance brought with it more of
dreadful meaning than all the shock of distant calamity.
The heart-rending wail of those who listened to the news
smote many more with the cold tremor of coming death,
Another case soon followed, a third, and a fourth succeeded,
all fatal ; and the disease was among them.
It is only when a malady, generally fatal, is associated
with the terrors of contagion, that the measure of horror
and dread flows over. When the sympathy which suf-
fering sickness calls for is yielded in a spirit of almost
despair, and the ministerings to the dying are but the

prelude to the same state, then indeed death is armed
with all his terrors. No people are more remarkable for
the charities of the sick-bed than the poor Irish. It is
with them less a sentiment than a religious instinct; and
though they watched the course of the pestilence, and saw
few, if any, escape death who took it, their devotion
never failed them. They practised with such skill as
they possessed, every remedy in turn. They, who trembled
but an hour before at the word when spoken, faced the
danger itself with a bold heart; and while the insidious
signs of the disease were already upon them—while their
wearied limbs and clammy hands bespoke that their own
hour was come, they did not desist from their good offices,
until past the power to render them.
It was spring-time, the season more than usually
mild, the prospects of the year were already favourable,
and all the signs of abundance rife in the land. What
a contrast the scene without to that presented by the
interior of each dwelling ! There, death and dismay were
met with at every step. The old man and the infant
prostrated by the same stroke ; the strong and vigorous
youth who went forth to labour in the morning-at noon,
a feeble, broken-spirited creature-at sunset, a corpse.
As the minds and temperaments of men were fashioned,
so did fear operate upon them. Some, it made reckless
and desperate, careless of what should happen, and in-
different to every measure of precaution; some, became
paralysed with fear, and seemed unable to make an effort
for safety, were it even attainable ; others, exaggerating
every care and caution, lived a life of unceasing terror
and anxiety; while a few—they were unfortunately a very
few-summoned courage to meet the danger in a spirit
of calm and resolute determination ; while in their re-
formed habits might be seen how thoroughly they felt

that their own hour might be a brief one. Among these
was Owen Connor. From the day the malady appeared
in the neighbourhood, he never entered the public-house
of the village, but devoting himself to the work of kind-
ness the emergency called for, went from cabin to cabin
rendering every service in his power. The poorest de-
pended on him for the supply of such little comforts as
they possessed, for at every market-day he sold a sheep
or a lamb to provide them; the better-off looked to him
for advice and counsel, following his directions as im-
plicitly as though he were a physician of great skill. All
recognised his devotedness in their cause, and his very
name was a talisman for courage in every humble cabin
around. His little ass-cart, the only wheeled vehicle that
ever ascended the mountain where he lived, was seen each
morning moving from door to door, while Owen brought
either some small purchase he was commissioned to make
at Oughterarde, or left with the more humble some offer-
ing of his own benevolence.
“There's the salt ye bid me buy, Mary Cooney; and
here's fourpence out of it,- do ye all be well, still ? ”
“We are, and thank ye, Owen.”
“ The Lord keep ye so! How's Ned Daly?"
“He's off, Owen dear; his brother James is making
the coffin ; poor boy, he looks very weak himself this
morning."
The cart moved on, and at length stopped at a sinall
hovel built against the side of a clay ditch. It was a
mere assemblage of wet sods with the grass still growing,
and covered by some branches of trees and loose straw
over them. Owen halted the ass at the opening of the
miserable den, through which the smoke now issued, and
at the same moment a man, stooping double to permit
him to pass out into the open air, came forward : he was

apparently about fifty years of age-his real age was not
thirty; originally a well-formed and stout-built fellow,
starvation and want had made him a mere skeleton. His
clothes were, a ragged coat, which he wore next his skin,
for shirt he had none, and a pair of worn corduroy
trousers; he had neither hat, shoes, nor stockings ; but
still, all these signs of destitution were nothing in com-
parison with the misery displayed in his countenance.
Except that his lip trembled with a convulsive shiver, not
a feature moved—the cheeks were livid and flattened-
the dull gray eyes had lost all the light of intelligence,
and stared vacantly before him.
“Well, Martin, how is she?"
“I don't know, Owen, dear,” said he, in a faltering
voice; “maybe 'tis sleeping she is.”
Owen followed him within the hut, and stooping down
to the fire, lighted a piece of bogwood to enable him to
see. On the ground, covered only by a ragged frieze
coat, lay a young woman quite dead : her arm, emaciated
and livid, was wrapped round a little child of about
three years old, still sleeping on the cold bosom of its
mother.
“ You must take little Patsy away,” said Owen in a
whisper, as he lifted the boy in his arms ; “ she's happy
now.”
The young man fell upon his knees and kissed the
corpse, but spoke not a word ; grief had stupified his
senses, and he was like one but half awake. “Come with
me, Martin ; come with me, and I'll settle everything for
you." He obeyed mechanically, and before quitting the
cabin, placed some turf upon the fire, as he was wont to
do. The action was a simple one, but it brought the
tears into Owen's eyes. “I'll take care of Patsy for you
till you want him. He's fond of me of ould, and won't be

lonesome with me;" and Owen wrapped the child in his
greatcoat, and moved forwards.
When they had advanced a few paces, Martin stopped
suddenly and muttered, “She has nothing to drink !"
and then, as if remembering vaguely what had happened,
added, “It's a long sleep, Ellen dear!”
Owen gave the directions for the funeral, and leaving
poor Martin in the house of one of the cottiers near,
where he sat down beside the hearth, and never uttered
a word; he went on his way, with little Patsy still asleep
within his arms.
“Where are you going, Peggy?" asked Owen, as an
old lame woman moved past as rapidly as her infirmity
would permit : “ you're in a hurry this morning."
“So I am, Owen Connor-these is the busy times wid
nie — I streaked five to-day, early as it is, and I'm going
now over to Phil Joyce's. What's the matter wid your-
self, Owen ? sit down, avich, and taste this."
“What's wrong at Phil's ?" asked Owen, with a
choking fulness in his throat.
“It's the little brother he has ; Billy's got it, they say."
“Is Mary Joyce well—did ye hear?”
“Errah ! she’s well enough now, but she may be low
before night,” muttered the crone ; while she added, with
a fiendish laugh, “her purty faytures won't save her now,
no more nor the rest of us."
“There's a bottle of port wine, Peggy; take it with ye,
dear. 'Tis the finest thing at all, I'm tould, for keeping
it off-get Mary to take a glass of it; but mind now, for
the love o' ye, never say it was me gav it. There's bad
blood between the Joyces and me, ye understand.”
"Ay, ay, I know well enough," said the hag, clutching
the bottle eagerly, while opening a gate on the road.

It was near evening as Owen was enabled to turn
homewards; for besides having a great many places to
visit, he was obliged to stop twice to get poor Patsy
something to eat, the little fellow being almost in a
state of staryation. At length he faced towards the
mountain, and with a sad heart and weary step plodded
along.
“Is poor Ellen buried ? " said he, as he passed the
carpenter's door, where the coftin had been ordered.
“She's just laid in the mould-awhile ago.”
“I hope Martin bears up better ;-did you see him
lately?"
“This is for him," said the carpenter, striking a board
with his hammer; "he's at peace now."
“ Martin ! sure he's not dead ? — Martin Neale, I
niean."
“So do I too; he had it on him since morning, they
say; but he just slipped away without a word or a
moan.”
“O God, be good to us, but the times is cireadful!"
ejaculated Owen.
"Some says it's the ind of the world's comin'," said
an old man, that sat moving his stick listlessly among
the shavings; "and 'twould be well for most of us it
was too."
“Thrue for you, Billy; there's no help for the poor."
No sentiment could meet more general acceptance
than this—none less likely to provoke denial. Thrown
upon each other for acts of kindness and benevolence,
they felt from how narrow a store each contributed to
another's wants, and knew well all the privations that
charity like this necessitated, at the same time that
they felt themselves deserted by those whose generosity
might have been exercised without sacrificing a single

enjoyment, or interfering with the pursuit of any accus.
tomed pleasure.
There is no more common theme than the ingratitude
of the poor-their selfishness and hard-heartedness; and
unquestionably a life of poverty is but an indifferent
teacher of fine feelings or gentle emotions. The dreary
monotony of their daily lives, the unvarying sameness of
the life-long struggle between labour and want, are little
suggestive of any other spirit than a dark and brooding
melancholy: and it were well, besides, to ask, if they
who call themselves benefactors have been really
generous, and not merely just? We speak more par-
ticularly of the relations which exist between the owner
of the land and those who till it; and where benevolence
is a duty, ind not a virtue depending on the will : not
that they in whose behalf it is ever exercised, regard it
in this light—very far from it! Their thankfulness for
benefits is generally most disproportioned to their extent;
but we are dissatisfied because our charity has not
changed the whole current of their fortunes, and that the
favours which cost us so little to besto:v, should not be-
come the ruling principle of their lives.
Owen reflected deeply on these things as he ascended
the mountain-road. The orphan child he carried in his
arms pressed such thoughts upon him, and he wondered
why rich men denied themselves the pleasures of benevo-
lence. He did not know that many great men enjoyed
the happiness, but that it was made conformable to their
high estate by institutions and establishments; by boards,
and committees, and guardians; by all the pomp and
circumstance of stuccoed buildings and liveried atten-
dants. That to save themselves the burden of memory,
their good deeds were chronicled in lists of "founders ”
and “life-subscribers," and their names set forth in news.

papers; while, to protect their finer natures from the
rude assaults of actual misery, they deputed others to be
the stewards of their bounty.
Owen did not know all this, or he had doubtless been
less unjust regarding such persons. He never so much
as heard of the pains that are taken to ward off the very
sight of poverty, and all the appliances employed to ex-
clude suffering from the gaze of the wealthy. All his
little experience told him was, how much of good might
be done within the sphere around him by one possessed
of affluence. There was not a cabin around, where he
could not point to some object claiming aid or assist-
ance. Even in seasons of comparative comfort and
abundance, what a deal of misery still existed; and what
a blessing it would bring on him who sought it out, to
compassionate and relieve it! So Owen thought, and so
he felt too; not the less strongly that another heart then
beat against his own, the little pulses sending a gush of
wild delight through his bosom as he revelled in the
ecstasy of benevoience. The child awoke, and looked
wildly about him; but when he recognised in whose arms
he was, he smiled happily, and cried, “Nony, Nony,"
the name by which Owen was known among all the
children of the village and its neighbourhood.
“Yes, Patsy,” said Owen, kissing him, "your own
Nony ! you're coming home with him to see what a nice
house he has upon the mountain for you, and the purty
lake near it, and the fish swimming in it.”
The little fellow clapped his hands with glee, and
seemed delighted at all he heard.
“Poor darlin'," muttered Owen, sorrowfully; "lie
doesn't know 'tis the sad day for him ;” and as he spoke,
the wind from the valley bore on it the mournful cadence
of a death-cry, as a funeral moved along the road.

St. Patrick's Eve.
“ His father's berrin'!” added he. “God help us ! how
fast misfortune does be overtaking us at the time our
heart's happiest ! It will be many a day before he
knows all this morning cost him.”
The little child meanwhile caught the sounds, and
starting up in Owen's arms, he strained his eyes to watch
the funeral procession as it slowly passed on. Owen
held him up for a few seconds to see it, and wiped the
large tears that started to his own eyes. “Maybe Martin
and poor Ellen's looking down on us now!” and with
that he laid the little boy back in his arms and plodded
forward.
It was but seldom that Owen Connor ascended that
steep way without halting to look down on the wide
valley, and the lake, and the distant mountains beyond
it. The scene was one of which he never wearied ; in-
deed, its familiarity had charms for him greater and
higher than mere picturesque beauty can bestow. Each
humble cabin with its little family was known to him ;
he was well read in the story of their lives; he had
mingled in all their hopes and fears from childhood to
old age; and, as the lights trembled through the dark
night and spangled the broad expanse, he could bring
before his mind's eye the humble hearths round which
they sat, and think he almost heard their voices. Now,
he heeded not these things, but steadily bent his steps
towards home.
At last, the twinkle of a star-like light showed that he
was near his journey's end. It shone from the deep
shadow of a little glen, in which his cabin stood. The
seclusion of the spot was in Owen's eyes its greatest
charm. Like all men who have lived much alone, le
set no common store by the pleasures of solitude, and
fancied that most if not all of his happiness was derived

from this source. At this moment his gratitude was
more than usual, as he muttered to himself, “ Thank God
for it! we've a snug little place away from the sickness,
and no house near us at all ;” and with this comforting
reflection he drew near the cabin. The door, contrary
to custom at nightfall, lay open; and Owen, painfully
alive to any suspicious sign, from the state of anxiety his
mind had suftered, entered hastily.
“Father ! where are you?” said he quickly, not seeing
the old man in his accustomed place beside the fire ; but
there was no answer. Laying the child down, Owen
passed into the little chamber which served as the old
man's bed-room, and where now he lay stretched upon
the bed in his clothes. “Are ye sick, father? What ails
ye, father dear?” asked the young man, as he took his
hand in his own.
“I'm glad ye've come at last, Owen," replied his
father feebly. “I've got the sickness, and am going
fast.”
“No-no, father! don't be down-hearted !” cried
Owen, with a desperate effort to suggest the courage he
did not feel; for the touch of the cold wet hand had
already told him the sad secret. 'Tis a turn ye have."
“Well, maybe so," said he, with a sigh; “but there's
a cowld feeling about my heart I never knew afore. Get
me a warm drink, anyway."
While Owen prepared some cordial from the little
store he usually dispensed among the people, his father
told him, that a boy from a sick house had called at the
cabin that morning to seek for Owen, and from him, in
all likelihood, he must have caught the malady. “I
remember," said the old man, “that he was quite
dark in the skin, and was weak in his limbs as he
walked."

St. Patrick's Eve.
“Ayeh !” muttered Owen, “av it was the disease' he
had, sorra bit of this mountain he'd ever get up. The
strongest men can't lift a cup of wather to their lips,
wlien it's on them ; but there's a great scarcity in the
glen, and maybe the boy eat nothing before he set out.”
Although Owen's explanation was the correct one, it
did not satisfy the old man's mind, who, besides feeling
convinced of his having the malady, could not credit his
taking it by other means than contagion. Owen never
quitted his side, and multiplied cares and attentions of every
kind; but it was plain the disease was gaining ground,
for ere midnight the old man's strength was greatly gone,
and his voice sunk to a mere whisper. Yet the malady
was characterised by none of the symptoms of the pre-
vailing epidemic, save slight cramps, of which from time
to time he complained. His case seemed one of utter
exhaustion. His mind was clear and calm ; and although
unable to speak, except in short and broken sentences,
no trait of wandering intellect appeared. His malady
was a common one among those whose fears, greatly ex-
cited by the disease, usually induced symptoms of pros-
tration and debility, as great, if not as rapid, as those of
actual cholera. Meanwhile his thoughts were alternately
turning from his own condition to that of the people in
the glen, for whom he felt the deepest compassion. “God
help them !” was his constant expression. “Sickness is
the sore thing; but starvation makes it dreadful. And
so Luke Clancy's dead! Poor ould Luke ! he was seventy-
one in Michaelmas. And Martin, too! he was a finc
man."
The old man slept, or seemed to sleep, for some
hours, and on waking it was clear daylight. “Owen,
dear! I wish,” said he, “I could see the priest ; but you
mustn't lave me; I couldn't bear that now."

Poor Owen's thoughts were that moment occupied on
the same subject, and he was torturing himself to think of
any means of obtaining Father John's assistance, without
being obliged to go for him himself.
“ I'll go, and be back here in an hour—ay, or less,”
said he, eagerly ; for terrible as death was to him, the
thought of seeing his father die unanointed, was still
more so.
“In an hour-where'll I be in an hour, Owen dear? the
blessed Virgin knows well, it wasn't my fault-I'd have
the priest av I could--and sure, Owen, you'll not be-
grudge me masses, when I'm gone. What's that? It's
like a child crying out there."
'Tis poor Martin's little boy I took home with me
-he's lost father and mother this day;" and so saying,
Owen hastened to see what ailed the child. “Yer sarvent,
Sir," said Owen, as he perceived a stout-built, coarse-
looking man, with a bull-terrier at his heels, standing in
the middle of the floor. “Yer sarvent, Sir. Who do ye
want here?"
“Are you Owen Connor?" said the man, gruffly. .
“That same,” replied Owen, as sturdily.
“Then this is notice for you to come up to Mr. Lucas's
office in Galway before the twenty-fifth, with your rent, or
the receipt for it, which ever you like best.”
“And who is Mr. Lucas when he's at home?” said
Dwen, half-sneeringly.
“You'll know him when you see him,” rejoined the
other, turning to leave the cabin, as he threw a printed
paper on the dresser; and then, as if thinking he had not
been formal enough in his mission, added, “ Mr. Lucas is
agent to your landlord, Mr. Leslie ; and I'll give you a
bit of advice, keep a civil tongue in your head with him,
and it will do you no harm,"
.

St. Patrick's Eve.
This counsel, delivered much more in a tone of menace
than of friendly advice, concluded the interview, for hav.
ing spoken, the fellow left the cabin, and began to
descend the mountain
Owen's heart swelled fiercely—a flood of conflicting
eniotions were warring within it; and as he turned to throw
the paper into the fire, his eye caught the date, 16th
March. “St. Patrick's Eve, the very day I saved hiş
life," said he bitterly. “Sure I knew well enough how it
would be when the landlord died ! Well, well, if my
poor ould father doesn't know it, it's no matter.—Well,
Patsy, acushla, what are ye crying for? There, my boy,
don't be afeard, 'tis Nony's with ye."
The accents so kindly uttered quieted the little fellow
in a moment, and in a few minutes after he was again
asleep in the old straw chair beside the fire. Brief as
Owen's absence had been, the old man seemed much
worse as he entered the room. “God forgive me, Owen
darling,” said he, “but it wasn't my poor sowl I was
thinking of that minit. I was thinking that you must get
a letter wrote to the young landlord about this little place
-- I'm sure he'll never say a word about rent, no more
nor his father; and as the times wasn't good lately "
“There, there, father,” interrupted Owen, who felt
shocked at the old man's not turning his thoughts in
another direction; “never mind those things," said he;
“ who knows which of us will be left ? the sickness doesn't
spare the young, no more than the ould.”.
“Nor the rich, no more nor the poor," chimed in the
old man, with a kind of bitter satisfaction, as he thought
on the landlord's death; for of such incongruous motives
is man made up, that calamities come lighter when they
involve the fall of those in station above our own, "'Tis
a fine day, seemingly,” said he, suddenly changing the

current of his thoughts ; " and iligant weather for the
country; we'll have to turn in the sheep over that wheat;
it will be too rank: ayeh,” cried he, with a deep sigh,
“I'll not be here to see it:" and for once, the emotions
no dread of futurity could awaken, were realised by
worldly considerations, and the old man wept like a child.
“What time of the month is it?" asked he, after a
long interval in which neither spoke; for Owen was not
really sorry that even thus painfully the old man's thoughts
should be turned towards eternity.
“'Tis the seventeenth, father, a holy-day all over
Ireland !"
“Is there many at the station ?'-look out at the
door and see.”
Owen ascended a little rising ground in front of the
cabin, from which the whole valley was visible; but ex-
cept a group that followed a funeral upon the road, he
could see no human thing around. The green where the
“stations” were celebrated was totally deserted. There
were neither tents nor people ; the panic of the plague
sad driven all ideas of revelry from the minds of the
most reckless; and, even to observe the duties of religion,
men feared to assemble in numbers. So long as the
misfortune was at a distance, they could mingle their
prayers in common, and entreat for mercy; but when
death knocked at every door, the terror became almost
despair.
“Is the stations' going on?" asked the old man
eagerly, as Owen re-entered the room. “Is the people
at the holy well ?"
"I don't see many stirring at all, to-day,” was the
cautious answer; for Owen scrupled to inflict any avoid-
able pain upon his mind.
“ Lift me up, then !" cried he suddenly, and. with a

voice stronge, from a violent effort of his will “Lift me
up to the window, till I see the blessed cross; and maybe
I'd get a prayer among them. Come, be quick, Owen !"
Owen hastened to comply with his request; but al-
ready the old man's eyes were glazed and filmy. The
effort had but hastened the moment of his doom; and
with a low faint sigh, he lay back, and died.
To the Irish peasantry, who, more than any other
people of Europe, are accustomed to bestow care and at-
tention on the funerals of their friends and relatives, the
cholera, in its necessity for speedy interment, was in-
creased in terrors tenfold. The honours which they
were wont to lavish on the dead—the ceremonial of the
wake—the mingled merriment and sorrow—the profusion
with which they spent the hoarded gains of hard-working
labour — and lastly, the long train to the churchyard,
evidencing the respect entertained for the departed,
should all be foregone ; for had not prudence forbid their
assembling in numbers, and thus incurring the chances of
contagion, which, whether real or not, they firmly believed
in, the work of death was too widely disseminated to
make such gatherings possible. Each had some one to
lament within the limits of his own family, and private
sorrow left little room for public sympathy. No longer
then was the road filled by people on horseback and foot,
as the funeral procession moved forth. The death-wail
sounded no more. To chant the requiem of the departed,
a few-a very few_immediate friends followed the body
to the grave, in silence unbroken. Sad hearts, indeed,
they brought, and broken spirits; for in this season of
pestilence few dared to hope.
By noon, Owen was seen descending the mountain to
the village, to make the last preparations for the old
man's funeral. He carried little Patsy in his arms; for

he could not leave the poor child alone, and in the house
of death. The claims of infancy would seem never stronger
than in the heart sorrowing over death. The grief that
carries the sufferer in his mind's eye over the limits of
this world, is arrested by the tender ties which bind him
to life in the young. There is besides a hopefulness in
early life — it is, perhaps, its chief characteristic - that
combats sorrow, better than all the caresses of friendship,
and all the consolations of age. Owen felt this now-
he never knew it before. But yesterday, and his father's
death had left him without one in the world on whom
to fix a hope; and already, from his misery, there arose
that one gleam, that now twinkled like a star in the sky
of midnight. The little child he had taken for his own
was a world to him; and as he went, he prayed fervently
that poor Patsy might be spared to him through this
terrible pestilence.
When Owen reached the carpenter's, there were
several people there; some, standing moɔdily brooding
over recent bereavements; others, spoke in low whispers,
as if fearful of disturbing the silence; but all were
sorrow-struck and sad.
“How is the ould man, Owen ? " said one of the group,
as he came forward.
“He's better off than us, I trust in God !” said Owen,
with a quivering lip. “He went to rest this morning."
• A muttered prayer from all around showed how
general was the feeling of kindness entertained towards
the Connors.

“ He's in glory now, I pray God!" muttered an old
man with a white beard. “We were born in the same
year, and I knew him since I was a child, like that in
your arms; and a good man he was."
“Whose is the child, Owen ?” said another in the
crowd.
“ Martin Neal's," whispered Owen; for he feared that
the little fellow might catch the words. “What's the
matter with Miles? he looks very low this morning."
This question referred to a large powerful-looking man,
who, with a smith's apron twisted round his waist, sat.
without speaking in a corner of the shop.
“I'm afeard he's in a bad way," whispered the man
to whom he spoke. “There was a process-server, or a
bailiff, or something of the kind, serving notices through
the townland yesterday, and he lost a shoe off his baste,
and would have Miles out, to put it on, tho' we all tould
him that he buried his daughter-a fine grown girl-
that mornin'. And what does the fellow do, but goes
and knocks at the forge till Miles comes out. You know
Miles Regan, so I needn't say there wasn't many words
passed between them. In less nor two minutes—what-
ever the bailiff said--Miles tuck him by the throat, and
pulled him down from the horse, and dragged him along
to the lake, and flung him in. 'Twas the Lord's marcy
ne knew how to swim ; but we don't know what'll be
done to Miles yet, for he was the new agent's man."
“Was he a big fellow, with a bull-dog following him?*
asked Owen.
"No; that's another; sure there's three or four of them
goin' about. We hear, that bad as ould French was, the
new one is worse.”
“Well-well, it's the will of God!" said Owen, in that
tone of voice which bespoke a willingness for all endur:

307
ance, so long as the consolation remained, that the ill
was not unrecorded above ; while he felt that all the evils
of poverty were little in comparison with the loss of those
nearest and dearest. “ Come, Patsy, my boy!” said he
at last, as he placed the coffin in the ass-cart, and turned
towards the mountain ; and, leading the little fellow by
the hand, he set out on his way "Come home.”
It was not until he arrived at that part of the road from
which the cabin was visible, that Owen knew the whole
extent of his bereavement; then, when he looked up and
saw the door hasped on the outside, and the chimney
from which no smoke ascended, the full measure of his
lone condition came at once before him, and he bent
over the coffin and wept bitterly. All the old man's
affection for him, his kind indulgence and forbearance,
his happy nature, his simple-heartedness, gushed forth
from his memory, and he wondered why he had not loved
his father, in life, a thousand times more, so deeply was
he now penetrated by his loss. If this theme did not
assuage his sorrows, it at least so moulded his heart as to
bear them in a better spirit; and when, having placed the
body in the coffin, he knelt down beside it to pray, it
was in a calmer and more submissive frame of mind than
he had yet known,
It was late in the afternoon ere Owen was once more
on the road down the mountain ; for it was necessary-
or at least believed so—that interment should take place
on the day of death.
“ I never thought it would be this way you'd go to your
last home, father dear,” said Owen aloud, and in a voice
almost stifled with sobs; for the absence of all his friends
and relatives at such a moment, now smote on the poor
fellow's heart, as he walked beside the little cart on which
the coffin was laid. It was indeed a sight to move a

sterner nature than his; the coffin, not reverently carried
by bearers, and followed by its long train of mourners,
but laid slant-wise in the cart, the spade and shovel to
dig the grave beside it, and Patsy seated on the back of
the ass, watching with infant glee the motion of the
animal, as with careful foot he descended the rugged
mountain. Poor child ! how your guileless laughter shook
that strong man's heart with agony !
It was a long and weary way to the old churchyard.
The narrow road, too, was deeply rutted and worn by
wheel-tracks; for, alas, it had been trodden by many, of
late. The gray daylight was fast fading as Owen pushed
wide the old gate and entered. What a change to his
eyes did the aspect of the place present! The green
mounds of earth which marked the resting-place of village
patriarchs, were gone; and heaps of fresh-turned clay.
were seen on every side, no longer decorated, as of old,
with little emblems of affectionate sorrow; no tree, nor
stone, not even a wild flower, spoke of the regrets of
those who remained. The graves were rudely fashioned,
as if in haste—for so it was--few dared to linger there !
Seeking out a lone spot near the ruins, Owen began
to dig the grave, while the little child, in mute astonish-
ment at all he saw, looked on.
“Why wouldn't you stay out in the road, Patsy, and
play there, till I come to you? This is a cowld damp
place for you, my boy."
“Nony! Nony !” cried the child, looking at him with
an affectionate smile, as though to say he'd rather be near
him.
“Well, well, who knows but you're right? if it's the
will of God to take me, maybe you might as well go too.
It's a sore thing to be alone in the world, like me
ROW !”

309
And as he muttered the last few words he ceased
digging, and rested his head on the cross of the spade.
“Was that you, Patsy? I heard a voice somewhere."
The child shook his head in token of dissent.
“Ayeh! it was only the wind through the ould walls;
but sure it might be natral enough for sighs and sobs
to be here : there's many a one has floated over this damp
clay.”
He resumed his work once more. The night was
falling fast as Owen stepped from the deep grave, and
knelt down to say a prayer ere he committed the body to
the earth.
“Kneel down, darlin', here by my side," said he
placing his arm round the little fellow's waist; "'tis the
likes of you God loves best ;” and joining the tiny hands
with his own, he uttered a deep and fervent prayer for
the soul of the departed. “There, father !” said he, as
he arose at last, and in a voice as if addressing a living
person at his side; "there, father : the Lord, he knows
my heart inside me; and if walking the world barefoot
would give ye peace or ease, I'd do it, for you were a
kind man and a good father to me.” He kissed the
coffin as he spoke, and stood silently gazing on it.
Arousing himself with a kind of struggle, he untied
the cords, and lifted the coffin from the cart. For some
seconds he busied himself in arranging the ropes beneath
it, and then ceased suddenly, on remembering that he
could not lower it into the grave unassisted.
“I'll have to go down the road for some one," mut-
tered he to himself; but as he said this, he perceived at
some distance off in the churchyard the figure of a man,
as if kneeling over a grave. “The Lord help him, he
has his grief too !” ejaculated Owen, as he moved
towards him. On coming nearer he perceived that the

grave was newly made, and from its size evidently that
of a child.
"I ax your pardon," said Owen, in a timid voice,
after waiting for several minutes in the vain expectation
that the man would look up; “I ax your pardon for
disturbing you, but maybe you'll be kind enough to help
me to lay this coffin in the ground. I have nobody with
me but a child.”
The man started and looked round. Their eyes met;
it was Phil Joyce and Owen who now confronted each
other. But how unlike were both to what they were at.
their last parting! Then, vindictive passion, outraged
pride, and vengeance, swelled every feature and tingled
in every fibre of their frames. Now, each stood pale,
care-worn, and dispirited, wearied out by sorrow, and
almost broken-hearted. Owen was the first to speak.
“I axed your pardon before I saw you, Phil Joyce,
and I ax it again now, for disturbing you; but I didn't
know you, and I wanted to put my poor father's body in
the grave."
“I didn't know he was dead,” said Phil, in a hollow
voice, like one speaking to himself." This is poor little
Billy here," and he pointed to the mound at his feet.
“The heavens be his bed this night !” said Owen,
piously; "Good-night!" and he turned to go away ; then
stopping suddenly, he added, “Maybe, after all, you'll
not refuse me, and the Lord might be more merciful to
us both, than if we were to part like enemies."
“Owen Connor, I ask your forgiveness," said Phil,
stretching forth his hand, while his voice trembled like a
sick child's. “I didn't think the day would come I'd
ever do it; but my heart is humble enough' now, and
maybe 'twill be lower soon. Will you take my hand ?"
“Will I, Phil? will I, is it? ay, and however ye may

change to me after this night, I'll never forget this.” And
he grasped the cold fingers in both hands, and pressed
them ardently, and the two men fell into each other's
arms and wept.
Is it a proud or a humiliating confession for humanity
-assuredly it is a true one—that the finest and best traits
of our nature are elicited in our troubles, and not in our
joys ? that we come out purer through trials than pros-
perity? Does the chastisement of Heaven teach us better
than the blessings lavished upon us? or are these gifts
the compensation sent us for our afflictions, that when
poorest before man we should be richest before God ?
Few hearts there are which sorrow makes not wiser
none which are not better for it. So it was here. These
men, in the continuance of good fortune, had been enemies
for life; mutual hatred had grown up between them, so
that each yearned for vengeance on the other; and now
they walked like brothers, only seeking forgiveness of
each other, and asking pardon for the past.
The old man was laid in his grave, and they turned to
leave the churchyard.
“Won't ye come home with me, Owen ?" said Phil,
as they came to where their roads separated; “won't ye
come and eat your supper with us?”
Owen's throat filled up: he could only mutter, “Not
to-night, Phil—another time, plaze God.” He had not
ventured even to ask for Mary, nor did he know whether
Phil Joyce in his reconciliation might wish a renewal of
any intimacy with his sister. Such was the reason of
Owen's refusal ; for, however strange it may seem to some,
there is a delicacy of the heart as well as of good breed-
ing, and one advantage it possesses—it is of all lands,
and the fashion never changes.
Poor Owen would have shed his best blood to be able

to ask after Mary—to learn how she was, and how she
bore up under the disasters of the time; but he never
mentioned her name: and as for Phil Joyce, his gloomy
thoughts had left no room for others, and he parted from
Owen without a single allusion to her. “Good-night,
Owen,” said he, “and don't forget your promise to come
and see us soon.”
“Good-right, Phil," was the answer; “and I pray a
blessing on you and yours.” A slight quivering of the
voice at the last word was all he suffered to escape him,
and they parted

THE THIRD ERA.
FROM that day, the pestilence began to abate in
violence. The cases of disease became fewer
and less fatal, and at last, like a spent bolt, the
malady ceased to work its mischief. Men were slow
enough to recognise this bettered aspect of their fortune.
Calamity had weighed too heavily on them to make
them rally at once. They still walked like those who felt
the shadow of death upon them, and were fearful lest any
imprudent act or word might bring back the plague
among them.
With time, however, these features passed off : people
gradually resumed their wonted habits; and, except
where the work of death had been more than ordinarily
destructive, the malady was now treated as “ a thing that
had been."
If Owen Connor had not escaped the common misfor-
tune of the land, he could at least date one happy event
from that sad period-his reconciliation with Phil Joyce.
This was no passing friendship. The dreadful scenes he
had witnessed about him had made Phil an altered
character. The devotion of Owen-his manly indifference
to personal risk whenever his services were wanted by
another—his unsparing benevolence,—all these traits,
the mention of which at first only irritated and vexed his

St. Patrick's Eve
soul, were now remembered in the day of reconciliation ;
and none felt prouder to acknowledge his friendship than
his former enemy.
Notwithstanding all this, Owen did not dare to found
a hope upon his change of fortune ; for Mary was even
more distant and cold to him than ever, as though to
show that, whatever expectations he might conceive from
her brother's friendship, he should not reckon too con-
fidently on her feelings. Owen knew not how far he
had himself to blame for this; he was not aware that his
own constrained manner, his over-acted reserve, had
offended Mary to the quick; and thus, both mutually re-
treated in misconception and distrust. The game of
love is the same, whether the players be clad in velvet or
in hodden gray. Beneath the gilded ceilings of a palace,
or the lowly rafters of a cabin, there are the same hopes
and fears, the same jealousies, and distrusts, and de-
spondings; the wiles and stratagems are all alike; for,
after all, the stake is human happiness, whether he who
risks it be a peer or a peasant!
While Owen vacillated between hope and fear, now,
resolving to hazard an avowal of his love and take his
stand on the result, now, deeming it better to trust to
time and longer intimacy, other events were happening
around, which could not fail to interest him deeply.
The new agent had commenced his campaign with an
activity before unknown Arrears of rent were de-
manded to be peremptorily paid up; leases, whose exact
conditions had not been fulfilled, were declared void;
tenants occupying sub-let land were noticed to quit;
and all the threatening signs of that rigid management
displayed, by which an estate is assumed to be "admir.
ably regulated," and the agent's duty most creditably
discharged.


## p. 315 (#323) ############################################

The Third Era.
315
Many of the arrears were concessions made by the
landlord in seasons of hardship and distress, but were
unrecorded as such in the rent-roll or the tenant's re-
ceipt. There had been no intention of ever re-demanding
them; and both parties had lost sight of the transaction
until the sharp glance of a "new agent" discovered their
existence. So of the leases: covenants to build, or
plant, or drain, were inserted rather as contingencies,
which prosperity might empower, than as actual condi-
tions essential to be fulfilled ; and as for sub-letting, it
was simply the act by which a son or a daughter was por-
tioned in the world, and enabled to commence the work
of self-maintenance.
This slovenly system inflicted many evils. The de-
mand of an extravagant rent rendered an abatement not
a boon, but an act of imperative necessity; and while
the overhanging debt supplied the landlord with a means
of tyranny, it deprived the tenant of all desire to im-
provę his condition. “Why should I labour," said he,
“when the benefit never can be mine?” The landlord
then declaimed against ingratitude, at the time that the
peasant spoke against oppression. Could they both be
right? The impossibility of ever becoming independent
soon suggested that dogged indifference, too often con-
founded with indolent habits. Sustenance was enough
for him, who, if he earned more, should surrender it;
hence the poor man became chained to his poverty. It
was a weight which grew with his strength; privations
might as well be incurred with little labour as with
great; and he sunk down to the condition of a mere
drudge, careless and despondent. “He can only take
all I have !" was the cottier's philosophy; and the
maxim suggested a corollary, that the “all" should be
as little as might be.


## p. 316 (#324) ############################################

St. Patrick's Eve.
But there were other grievances flowing from this
source. The extent of these abatements usually de-
pended on the representation of the tenants themselves,
and such evidences as they could produce of their
poverty and destitution. Hence a whole world of false-
hood and dissimulation was fostered. Cabins were
suffered to stand half-roofed ; children left to shiver in
rags and nakedness; age and infirmity exhibited in at-
titudes of afflicting privations; habits of mendicity en-
couraged ;-all; that they might impose upon the pro-
prietor, and make him believe that any sum wrung from
such as these must be an act of cruelty. If these
schemes were sometimes successful, so in their failure
they fell as heavy penalties upon the really destitute, for
whose privations no pity was felt. Their misery, con-
founded in the general mass of dissimulation, was neg-
lected ; and for one who prospered in his falsehood,
many were visited in their affliction.
That men in such circumstances as these should listen
with greedy ears to any representation which reflected
heavily on their wealthier neighbours, is little to be won-
dered at. The triumph of knavery and falsehood is a
bad lesson for any people ; but the fruitlessness of honest
industry is, if possible, a worse one. Both were well
taught by this system. And these things took place,
not, be it observed, when the landlord or his agent were
cruel and exacting-very far from it. They were the
instances so popularly expatiated on by newspapers and
journals; they were the cases headed—“Example for
Landlords !” “Timely Benevolence !” and paragraphed
thus :-“We learn, with the greatest pleasure, that
Mr. Muldrennin, of Kilbally-drennin, has, in considera.
tion of the failure of the potato-crop, and the severe
pressure of the season, kindly abated five per cent of

317
all his rents. Let this admirable example be generally
followed, and we shall once more see,” &c. &c. There
was no explanatory note to state the actual condi.
tion of that tenantry, or the amount of that rent from
which the deduction was made. Mr. Muldrennin was
then free to run his career of active puffery through-
out the kingdom, and his tenantry to starve on as
before.
Of all worldly judgments there is one that never fails.
No man was ever instrumental, either actively or through
neglect, to another's demoralisation, that he was not
made to feel the recoil of his conduct on himself. Such
had been palpably the result here. The confidence of
the people lost, they had taken to themselves the only
advisers in their power, and taught themselves to sup-
pose that relief can only be effected by legislative enact-
ments, or their own efforts. This lesson once learned,
and they were politicians for life. The consequence has
been, isolation from him to whom once all respect and
attachment were rendered ; distrust and dislike follow-
would that the catalogue went no further !
And again to our story. Owen was at last reminded,
by the conversation of those about, that he too had re-
ceived a summons from the new agent to attend at his
office in Galway—a visit which, somehow or other, he
had at first totally neglected; and, as the summons was
not repeated, he finally supposed had been withdrawn
by the agent, on learning the condition of his holding.
As September drew to a close, however, he accompanied
Phil Joyce on his way to Galway, prepared, if need be,
to pay the half-year's rent, but ardently hoping the while
it might never be demanded. It was a happy morning
for poor Owen-the happiest of his whole life. He had
gone over early to breakfast at Joyce's, and on reaching

the house found Mary alone, getting ready the meal
Their usual distance in manner continued for some time;
each talked of what their thoughts were least occupied
on; and at last, after many a look from the window to
see Phil was coming, and wondering why he did not
arrive, Owen drew a heavy sigh and said, “It's no use,
Mary ; divil a longer can I be suffering this way ; take
me or refuse me you must this morning! I know well
enough you don't care for me ; but if ye don't like
any one else better, who knows but in time, and with
God's blessin', but ye'll be as fond of me, as I am of
you ?"
“And who told ye I didn't like some one else?" said
Mary, with a sly glance; and her hardsome features
brightened up with a more than common brilliancy.
“ The heavens make him good enough to desarve ye,
I pray this day !” said Owen, with a trembling lip. “I'll
go now! that's enough !”
“Won't ye wait for yer breakfast, Owen Connor?
Won't ye stay a bit for my brother ?"
“No, thank ye, Ma'am. I'll not go into Galway
to-day.”
“Well, but don't go without your breakfast. Take a
cup of tay anyhow, Owen dear !"
“Owen dear! O Mary, jewel! don't say them words,
and I laving you for ever.”
The young girl blushed deeply and turned away her
head, but her crimsoned neck showed that her shame
was not departed. At the moment, Phil burst into the
roon, and standing for a second with his eyes fixed on
each in turn, he said, “ Bad scran to ye, for women; but
there's nothing but decate and wickedness in yé ; divil a
peace or ease I ever got when I quarrelled with Owen,
and now that we're friends, ye're as cross and discone

tented as ever. Try what you can do with her yourself,
Owen, my boy; for I give her up."
“ 'Tis not for me to thry it,” said Owen, despondingly;
o'tis another has the betther luck,”
“That's not true, anyhow,” cried Phil ; "for she told
me so herself.”
“What! Mary, did ye say that?" said Owen, with
a spring across the room ; "did ye tell him that,
darling ?" .
“Sure if I did, ye wouldn't believe me,” said Mary,
with a side-look; “women is nothing but deceit and
wickedness.”
“Sorra else," cried Owen, throwing his arm round
her neck and kissing her ; "and I'll never believe ye
again, when ye say ye don't love me.”
" 'Tis a nice way to boil the eggs hard,” said Phil,
testily; "arrah, come over here and eat your breakfast,
man; you'll have time enough for courting when we
come back.”
There needed not many words to a bargain which was
already ratified; and before they left the house, the day
of the wedding was actually fixed.
It was not without reason, then, that I said it was a
happy day for Owen. Never did the long miles of the
road seem so short as now; while, with many a plan for
the future, and many a day-dream of happiness to come,
he went at Phil's side scarce crediting his good fortune
to be real.
When they arrived at the agent's office in the square
at Galway, they found a great many of their neighbours
and friends already there ; some, moody and depressed,
yet lingered about the door, though they had apparently
finished the business which brought them; others, anxious-
looking and troubled, were waiting for their turn to

amat with
enter. They were all gathered into little groups and
parties, conversing eagerly together in Irish; and as each
came out of the office, he was speedily surrounded by
several others, questioning him as to how he had fared,
and what success he met with.
Few came forth satisfied — not one happy-looking.
Some, who were deficient a few shillings, were sent back
again, and appeared with the money still in their hands,
which they counted over and over, as if hoping to make it
more. Others, trusting to promptitude in their payments,
were seeking renewal of their tenures at the same rent,
and found their requests coldly received, and no pledge
returned. Others, again, met with severe reproaches as
to the condition of their dwellings and the neglected ap-
pearance of their farms, with significant hints that slovenly
tenants would meet with little favour, and, although
pleading sickness and distress, found the apology but
slightly regarded.
“We thought the ould agent bad enough; but, faix, this
one bates him out, entirely.” Such was the comment of
each and all, at the treatment met with, and such the
general testimony of the crowd.
“ Owen Connor! Owen Connor !" called out a voice,
which Owen in a moment recognised as that of the fellow
who had visited his cabin ; and passing through the
densely crowded hall, Owen forced his way into the small
front parlour, where two clerks were seated at a table,
writing
“Over here; this way, if you please,” said one of them,
pointing with his pen to the place he should stand in.
“ What's your name ?”.
"Owen Connor, Sir.”
“What's the name of your holding?"

the townlands, and the mountain is Slieve-na-vick,
Sir."
“Owen Connor, Owen Connor ?" said the clerk, rer
peating the name three or four times over. “Oh, I re-
member; there has been no rent paid on your farm for
some years."
“You're right there, Sir," said Owen ; "the landlord,
God be good to him ! tould my poor father- "
“Well, well, I have nothing to do with that-step in-
side—Mr. Lucas will speak to you himself ;-show this
man inside, Luffey ;” and the grim bailiff led the way
into the back parlour, where two gentlemen were standing
with their backs to the fire, chatting; they were both
young and good-looking, and !0 Owen's eyes, as unlike
agents as could be.
“Well, what does this honest fellow want?-no abate-
ment, I hope ; a fellow with as good a coat as you have,
can't be very ill off.”
“True for you, yer honour, and I am not,” said Owen
in reply to the speaker, who seemed a few years younger
than the other. “I was bid spake to yer honour about
the little place I have up the mountains, and that Mr.
Leslie gave my father rent-free-
“Oh, you are the man from Maam, aint you ?”
“ The same, Sir; Owen Connor."
“That's the mountain I told you of, major," said
Lucas in a whisper; then turning to Owen, resumed :
“Well, I wished to see you very much, and speak to you.
I've heard the story about your getting the land rent-free,
and all that; but I find no mention of the matter in the
books of the estate ; there is not the slightest note nor
memorandum that I can see, on the subject; and except
your own word—which of course, as far as it goes, is all
very well--I have nothing in your favour.”
21

St. Patrick's Eve
While these words were being spoken, Owen went
through a thousand tortures; and many a deep conflict-
ing passion warred within him. “Well, Sir," said he at
last, with a heavily drawn sigh, “ well, Sir, with God's
blessin', I'll do my best ; and whatever your honour says
is fair, I'll thry and pay it: I suppose I'm undher rent
since March last?".
“ March ! why, my good fellow, there's six years due
last twenty-fifth ; what are you thinking of?”
“Sure you don't mean I'm to pay, for what was given
to me and my father?" said Owen, with a wild look that
almost startled the agent.
“I mean precisely what I say," said Lucas, reddening
with anger at the tone Owen assumed. “I mean that you
owe six years and a half of rent; for which, if you neither
produce receipt nor money, you'll never owe another half
year for the same holding."
“And that's flat !” said the major, laughing.
“And that's flat!" echoed Lucas, joining in the
mirth.
Owen looked from one to the other of the speakers,
and although never indisposed to enjoy a jest, he could
not, for the life of him, conceive what possible occasion
for merriment existed at the present moment.
“Plenty of grouse on that mountain, aint there?" said
the major, tapping his boot with his cane.
But, although the question was addressed to Owen, he
was too deeply sunk in his own sad musings to pay it any
attention.
“Don't you hear, my good fellow ? Major Lynedock
asks, if there are not plenty of grouse on the mountain.”
“Did the present landlord say that I was to pay thus
back rent?” said Owen deliberately, after a moment of
deep thought.

“ Mr. Leslie never gave me any particular instructions
on your account,” said Lucas smiling; "nor do I suppose
that his intentions regarding you are different from those
respecting other tenants."
“I saved his life, then !” said Owen; and his eyes
flashed with indignation as he spoke.
“And you saved a devilish good fellow, I can tell you,"
said the major, smiling complacently, as though to hint
that the act was a very sufficient reward for its own per-
formance.
“ The sorra much chance he had of coming to the
property that day, anyhow, till I came up,” said Owen,
in a half soliloquy.
"What! were the savages about to scalp him? Eh !"
asked the major.
Owen turned a scowl towards him that stopped the
already-begun laugh; while Lucas, amazed at the pea-
sant's effrontery, said, “You needn't wait any longer, nay
good fellow; I have nothing more to say."
“I was going to ask yer honour, Sir," said Owen,
civilly, “if I paid the last half-year-I have it with me
-if ye'll let me stay in the place till ye'll ask Mr.
Leslie--"
“But you forget, my friend, that a receipt for the
last half-year is a receipt in full,” said Lucas, interrupt.
ing.
“Sure, I don't want the receipt !” said Owen hur-
riedly; “keep it yourself. It isn't mistrusting the word
of a gentleman I'd be.”
“Eh, Lucas ! blarney! I say, blarney, and no mis-
take !” cried the major, half-suffocated with his own
drollery.
“ By my sowl! it's little blarney I'd give you, av I
had ye at the side of Slieve-na-vick,” said Owen; and

the look he threw towards him left little doubt of his
sincerity.
“Leave the room, Sir! leave the room !” said Lucas,
with a gesture towards the door.
“Dare I ax you where Mr. Leslie is now, Sir" said
Owen, calmly.
“He's in London : No. 18, Belgrave Square."
“Would yer honour be so kind as to write it on a bit
of paper for me?” said Owen, almost obsequiously.
Lucas sat down and wrote the address upon a card,
handing it to Owen without a word.
"I humbly ax yer pardon, gentlemen, if I was rude
to either of ye,” said Owen, with a bow, as he moved
towards the door; “but distress of mind doesn't improve
a man's manners, if even he had more nor I have; but
if I get the little place yet, and that ye care for a day's
sport--"
“Eh, damme, you're not so bad, after all,” said the
major : "I say, Lucas-is he, now?”.
“Your servant, gentlemen,” said Owen, who felt too
indignant at the cool insolence with which his generous
proposal was accepted, to trust himself with more; and
with that, he left the room.
"Well, Owen, my boy," said Phil, who long since
having paid his own rent, was becoming impatient at his
friend's absence; “well, Owen, ye might have settled about
the whole estate by this time. Why did they keep you
so long?"
In a voice tremulous with agitation, Owen repeated the
result of his interview, adding, as he concluded, “And
now, there's nothing for it, Phil, but to see the landlord
himself, and spake to him. I've got the name of the
place he's in, here—it's somewhere in London ; and I'il
never turn my steps to home, before I get a sight of

him. I've the half-year's rent here in my pocket, so that
I'll have money enough, and to spare; and I only ax ye,
Phil, to tell Mary how the whole case is, and to take
care of little Patsy for me till I come back-he's at your
house now."
“Never fear, we'll take care of him, Owen ; and I be.
lieve you're doing the best thing, after all.”
The two friends passed the evening together, at least
until the time arrived, when Owen took his departure by
the mail. It was a sad termination to a day which opened
so joyfully, and not all Phil's endeavours to rally and
encourage his friend could dispossess Owen's mind of a
gloomy foreboding that it was but the beginning of mis-
fortune. “I have it over me," was his constant expression
as they talked ; “I have it over me, that something bad
will come out of this ;” and although his fears were vague
and indescribable, they darkened his thoughts as effec-
tually as real evils.
The last moment came, and Phil, with a hearty “God
speed you,” shook his friend's hand, and he was gone.
It would but protract my story, without fulfilling any
of its objects, to speak of Owen's journey to England and
on to London. It was a season of great distress in the
manufacturing districts ; several large failures had occurred
-great stagnation of trade existed, and a general depres-
sion was observable over the population of the great trading
cities. There were daily meetings to consider the con-
dition of the working classes, and the newspapers were
crammed with speeches and resolutions in their favour.
Placards were carried about the streets, with terrible an-
nouncements of distress and privation, and processions
of wretched-looking men were met with on every side.
Owen, who, from motives of economy, prosecuted his
journey on foot, had frequent opportunities of entering

the dwellings of the poor, and observing their habits and
modes of life. The everlasting complaints of suffering
and want rung in his ears from morning till night; and
yet to his unaccustomed eyes the evidences betrayed few,
if any, of the evils of great poverty. The majority were
not without bread—the very poorest had a sufficiency of
potatoes. Their dwellings were neat-looking and com-
fortable, and, in comparison with what he was used to,
actually luxurious. Neither were their clothes like the
ragged and tattered coverings Owen had seen at home.
The fustian jackets of the men were generally whole and
well cared for; but the children more than all struck him.
In Ireland the young are usually the first to feel the pres-
sure of hardship—their scanty clothing rather the re-
quirement of decency, than a protection against weather;
here, the children were cleanly and comfortably dressed
-none were in rags, few without shoes and stockings.
What could such people mean by talking of distress,
Owen could by no means comprehend. “I wish we had
a little of this kind of poverty in ould Ireland !” was the
constant theme of his thoughts. “'Tis little they know
what distress is. Faix, I wondher what they'd say if they
saw Connemarra ?” And yet, the privations they endured
were such as had not been known for many years previous.
Their sufferings were really great, and the interval between
their ordinary habits as wide as ever presented itself in
the fortunes of the poor Irishman's life. But poverty,
after all, is merely relative; and they felt that as “star-
vation” which Paddy would hail as a season of blessing
and abundance.
“With a fine slated house over them, and plenty of
furniture inside, and warm clothes, and enough to eat;
that's what they call distress! Musha! I'd like to see
them when thay think they're comfortable," thought Owen,

who at last lost all patience with such undeserved com.
plainings, and could with difficulty restrain himself from
an open attack on their injustice.
He arrived in London at last, and the same evening
hastened to Belgrave Square; for his thoughts were now,
as his journey drew to a close, painfully excited at the near
prospect of seeing his landlord. He found the house with-
out difficulty: it was a splendid town-mansion, well befit-
ting a man of large fortune; and Owen experienced an
Irishman's gratification in the spacious and handsome
building he saw before him. He knocked, at first timidly,
and then, as no answer was returned, more boldly; but it
was not before a third summons that the door was opened ;
and an old mean-looking woman asked him what he
wanted.
“I want to see the masther, Ma'am, av it's plazing to
ye!" said Owen, leaning against the door-jamb as he
spoke.
“The master? What do you mean ?”
“Mr. Leslie himself, the landlord.”
“Mr. Leslie is abroad—in Italy."
“Abroad ! abroad!" echoed Owen, while a sickly faint-
ness spread itself through his frame. “He's not out of
* England, is he?"
" I've told you he's in Italy, my good mar."
“ Erra! where's that at all?” cried Owen, despairingly.
“I'm sure I don't know; but I can give you the ad-
dress, if you want it.”
“No, thank ye, Ma'am—it's too late for that, now,"
said he. The old woman closed the door, and the poor
fellow sat down upon the steps, overcome by this sad and
unlooked-for result.
It was evening. The streets were crowded with people
-some on foot, some on horseback and in carriages. The

glare of splendid equipages, the glittering of wealth---the
great human tide rolled past, unnoticed by Owen, for his
own sorrows filled his whole heart.
Men in all their worldliness,—some on errands of plea-
sure, some care-worn and thoughtful, some brirnful of ex-
pectation, and others downcast and dejected—moved
past: scarcely one remarked that poor peasant, whose
travelled and tired look, equally with his humble dress,
bespoke one who came from afar.
“Well, God help me, what's best for me to do now?"
said Owen Connor, as he sat ruminating on his fortune;
and, unable to find any answer to his own question, he
arose and walked slowly along, not knowing nor caring
whither.
There is no such desolation as that of a large and
crowded city to him who, friendless and alone, finds him-
self a wanderer within its walls. The man of education
and taste looks around him for objects of interest or
amusement, yet saddened by the thought that he is cut
off from all intercourse with his fellow-men; but, to the
poor unlettered stranger how doubly depressing are all
these things! Far from speculating on the wealth and
prosperity around him, he feels crushed and humiliated
in its presence. His own humble condition appears even
more lowly in contrast with such evidences of splendour;
and instinctively he retreats from the regions where
fashion, and rank, and riches abound, to the gloomy
abodes of less-favoured fortunes.
When Owen awoke the following morning, and looked
about him in the humble lodging he had selected, he could
scarcely believe that already the end of his long journey
had been met by failure. Again and again he endeavoured
to remember if he had seen his landlord, and what reply
he had received; but except a vague sense of disappoint-

ment, he could fix on ncthing. It was only as he drew
near the great mansion once more that he could thoroughly
recollect all that had happened; and then the truth flashed
on his mind, and he felt all the bitterness of his misfortune.
I need not dwell on this theme. The poor man turned
again homeward; why, he could not well have answered,
had any been cruel enough to ask him. The hope that
buoyed him up before, now spent and exhausted, his step
was slow and his heart heavy, while his mind, racked with
anxieties and dreads, increased his bodily debility, and
made each mile of the way seem ten.
On the fourth day of his journey–wet through from
morning till late in the evening—he was seized with a
shivering-fit, followed soon after by symptoms of fever.
The people in whose house he had taken shelter for the
night, had him at once conveyed to the infirmary, where
for eight weeks he lay dangerously ill; a relapse of his
malady, on the day before he was to be pronounced con-
valescent, occurred, and the third month was nigh its
close ere Owen left the hospital.
It was more than a week ere he could proceed on his
journey, which he did at last, moving only a few miles
each day, and halting before nightfall. Thus weariiy
plodding on, he reached Liverpool at last, and about the
middle of January arrived in his native country once
more.
His strength regained, his bodily vigour restored, he
had made a long day's journey to reach home, and it was
about ten o'clock of a bright and starry night that he
crossed the mountains that lie between Ballinrobe and
Maam. To Owen, the separation from his home seemed
like a thing of years long; and his heart was full to
- bursting as each well-remembered spot appeared, bringing
back a thousand associations of his former life. As he

strode along he stopped frequently to Icok down towards
the village, where, in each light that twinkled, he could
mark the different cabins of his old friends. At length,
the long low farm-house of the Joyces came into view-
he could trace it by the line of light that glittered from
every window—and from this Owen could not easily tear
himself away. Muttering a heartfelt prayer for those be.
neath that roof, he at last moved on, and near midnight
gained the little glen where his cabin stood. Scarcely,
however, had he reached the spot, when the fierce chal-
lenge of a dog attracted him. It was not his own poor
colley—he knew his voice well—and Owen's blood ran
chilly at the sound of that strange bark. He walked on,
however, resclutely grasping his stick in his hand, and
suddenly, as he turned the angle of the cliff, there stood
his cabin, with a light gleaming from the little window.
“'Tis Phil Joyce maybe has put soniebody in, to take
care of the place,” said he; but his fears gave no cre-
dence to the surmise.
Again the dog challenged, and at the same moment
the door was opened, and a man's voice called out, “Who
comes there?” The glare of the fire at his back showed
that he held a musket in his hand.
66 'Tis me, Owen Connor," answered Owen half sulkily,
for he felt that indescribable annoyance a man will ex-
perience at any question, as to his approaching his own
dwelling, even though in incognito.
“Stay back, then,” cried the other; “if you advance
another step, I'll send a bullet through you."
“Send a bullet through me!” cried Owen, scornfully,
yet even more astonished than indignant. “Why, isn't
a man to be let go to his own house, without being fired
at?
“I'll be as good as my word,” said the fellow; and

331
as he spoke, Owen saw him lift the gun to his shoulder
and steadily hold it there. “Move one step now, and
you'll see if I'm not.”
Owen's first impulse was to rush forward at any hazard,
and if not wounded to grapple with his adversary; but he
reflected for a second that some great change must have
occurred in his absence, which, in all likelihood, no act
of daring on his part could avert or alter. “I'll wait for
morning, anyhow," thought he; and without another
word, or deigning any answer to the other, he slowly
turned and retraced his steps down the mountain.
There was a small mud hovel at the foot of the moun-
tain, where Owen determined to pass the night. The old
man who lived there had been a herd formerly, but age
and rheumatism had left him a cripple, and he now lived
on the charity of the neighbours.
! "Poor Larry! I don't half like disturbing ye,” said
Owen as he arrived at the miserable contrivance of wattles
that served for a door; but the chill night air, and his
weary feet decided the difficulty, and he called out,
“ Larry-Larry Daly! open the door for me-Owen
Connor. 'Tis me!”
The old man slept with the light slumber of age, and
despite the consequences of his malady, managed to
hobble to the door in a few seconds. “Oh! wirra,
wirra! Owen, my son !" cried he, in Irish; "I hoped
I'd never see ye here again—my own darlin'.”
“That's a dhroll welcome, anyhow, Larry, for a man
coming back among his own people.”
6 'Tis a thrue one, as sure as I live in sin. The Lord
help us, this is bad fortune.”
“What do you mean, Larry? What did I ever do to
disgrace my name, that I wouldn't come back here?"
""'Tisn't what ye done, honey, but what's done upon

ye. Oh, wirra, wirra ; 'tis a black day that led ye home
here."
It was some time before Owen could induce the old
man to moderate his sorrows, and relate the events which
had occurred in his absence. I will not weary my reader
by retailing the old man's prolixity, but tell them in the
fewest words I am able, premising, that I must accom-
pany the narrative by such explanations as I may feel
necessary.
Soon after Owen's departure for England, certain dis-
turbances occurred through the country. The houses of
the gentry were broken open at night and searched for
arms by men with blackened faces and in various disguises
to escape recognition. Threatening notices were served
on many of the resident families, menacing them with the
worst if they did not speedily comply with certain con-
ditions, either in the discharge of some obnoxious indivi.
duals from their employment, or the restoration of some
plot of ground to its former holder. Awful denunciations
were uttered against any who should dare to occupy land
from which a former tenant was ejected; and so terrible
was the vengeance exacted, and so sudden its execution,
that few dared to transgress the orders of these savage
denunciators. The law of the land seemed to stand still,
justice appeared appalled and affrighted, by.acts which be-
spoke deep and wide-spread conspiracy. The magistrates
assembled to deliberate on what was to be done; and the
only one who ventured to propose a bold and vigorous
course of acting was murdered on his way homeward.
Meanwhile, Mr. Lucas, whose stern exactions had given
great discontent, seemed determined to carry through his
measures at any risk. By influence with the government
ne succeeded in obtaining a considerable police-force, and,
under cover of these, he issued his distress warrants and

333
executions, distrained and sold, probably with a severity
increased by the very opposition he met with.
The measures undertaken by government to suppress
outrage failed most signally. The difficulty of arresting a
suspected individual was great in a country where a large
force was always necessary. The difficulty of procuring
evidence against him was still greater; for even such as
were not banded in the conspiracy, had a greater dread of
the reproach of informer, than of any other imputation ;
and when these two conditions were overcome, the last
and greatest of all difficulties remained behind,—no jury
could be found to convict, when their own lives might
pay the penalty of their honesty. While thus, on one
side, went the agent, with his cumbrous accompaniments
of law-officers and parchments, police constables and
bailiffs, to effect a distress or an ejectment; the midnight
party with arms patrolled the country, firing the haggards
and the farmhouses, setting all law at defiance, and as-
serting in their own bloody vengeance the supremacy of
massacre.
Not a day went over without its chronicle of crime; the
very calendar was red with murder. Friends parted with
a fervour of feeling, that showed none knew if they would
meet on the morrow; and a dark, gloomy suspicion pre-
vailed through the land, each dreading his neighbcur, and
deeming his isolation more secure than all the ties of friend-
ship. All the bonds of former love, all the relations of
kindred and affection, were severed by this terrible league.
Brothers, fathers, and sons were arrayed against each other.
A despotism was thus set up, which even they who detested
dared not oppose. The very defiance it hurled at superior
power, awed and terrified themselves. Nor was this feel-
ing lessened when they saw that these dreadful acts-
acts so horrible as to make men shudder at the name of

Ireland when heard in the farthest corner of Europe
that these had their apologists in the press, that even a
designation was invented for them, and murder could
be spoken of patriotically as the “Wild Justice” of the
people.
There is a terrible contagion in crime. The man whose
pure heart had never harboured a bad thought cannot live
untainted where wickedness is rife. The really base and
depraved were probably not many; but there were hard-
ships and sufferings every where; misery abounded in the
land—misery too dreadful to contemplate. It was not
difficult to connect such sufferings with the oppressions,
real or supposed, of the wealthier classes. Some, believed
the theory with all the avidity of men who grasp at straws
when drowning; others, felt a savage pleasure at the bare
thought of reversing the game of sufferance; while many,
mixed up their own wrongs with what they regarded as
national grievances, and converted their private vengeance
into a patriotic daring. Few stood utterly aloof, and even
of these, none would betray the rest.
The temporary success of murder, too, became a hor-
rible incentive to its commission. The agent shot, the
law he had set in motion stood still, the process fell
powerless; the “Wild Justice" superseded the slower
footsteps of common law, and the murderer saw himself
installed in safety, when he ratified his bond in the blood
of his victim.
Habitual poverty involves so much of degradation, that
recklessness of life is its almost invariable accompaniment;
and thus, many of these men ceased to speculate on the
future, and followed the dictates of their leaders in blind
and dogged submission. There were many, too, who felt
a kind of savage enthusiasm in the career of danger, and
actually loved the very hazard of the game. Many more

335
had private wrongs-old debts of injury to wipe out—and
grasped at the occasion to acquit them; but even when
no direct motives existed, the terror of evil consequences
induced great numbers to ally themselves with this ter-
rible conspiracy, and when not active partisans, at least
to be faithful and secret confidants.
Among the many dispossessed by the agent was Owen
Connor. Scarcely had he left the neighbourhood, than
an ejectment was served against him; and the bailift, by
whose representations Owen was made to appear a man
of dangerous character, installed in his mountain-farm.
This fellow was one of those bold, devil-may-care ruffians,
who survive in every contest' longer than men of more
circumspect courage ; and Lucas was not sorry to find
that he could establish such an outpost in this wild and
dreary region. Well armed, and provided with a suffi-
ciency of ammunition, he promised to maintain his
stronghold against any force-a boast not so unreason-
able, as there was only one approach to the cabin, and
that, a narrow path on the very verge of a precipice.
Owen's unexpected appearance was in his eyes, therefore,
a signal for battle : he supposed that he was come back
to assert his ancient right, and in this spirit it was, he
menaced him with instant death if he advanced another
step. Indeed, he had been more than once threatened
that Owen's return would be a “dark day” for him, and
prepared himself for a meeting with him, as an occasion
which might prove fatal to either. These threats, not
sparingly bandied by those who felt little inclination to
do battle on their own account, had become so frequent,
that many looked for Owen's reappearance as for an
event of some moment.
Olá Larry often heard these reports, and well knowing
Owen's ardent disposition and passionate temper, and

·
how easily he became the tool of others, when any deed
of more than ordinary hazard was presented to him,
grieved deeply over the consequences such promptings
might lead to; and thus it was, that he received him with
that outburst of sorrow for which Owen was little pre-
pared.
If Owen was shocked as he listened first to the tale
of anarchy and bloodshed the old man revealed, a savage
pleasure came over him afterwards, to think, what terror
these midnight maraudings were making in the hearts of
those who lived in great houses, and had wealth and in-
fluence. His own wrongs rankled too deeply in his breast
to make him an impartial hearer; and already, many of
his sympathies were with the insurgents.
It was almost daybreak ere he could close his eyes;
for although tired and worn out, the exciting themes he
was revolving banished every thought of sleep, and made
him restless and fretful. His last words to Larry, as he
lay down to rest, were a desire that he might remain for
a day or two concealed in his cabin, and that none of
the neighbours should learn anything of his arrival. The
truth was, he had not courage to face his former friends,
nor could he bear to meet the Joyces : what step he pur-
posed to take in the mean while, and how to fashion his
future course, it is hard to say: for the present, he only
asked time.
The whole of the following day he remained within the
little hut; and when night came, at last ventured forth to
breathe the fresh air and move his cramped limbs. His
first object, then, was to go over to Joyce's house, with
no intention of visiting its inmates—far from it. The
poor fellow had conceived a shrinking horror of the
avowal he should be compelled to make of his own
failure, and did not dare to expose himself to such a test
_

337
The night was dark and starless: that heavy, clouded
darkness which follows a day of rain in our western cli-
mate, and makes the atmosphere seem loaded and
weighty. To one less accustomed than was Owen, the
pathway would have been difficult to discover ; but he
knew it well in every turning and winding, every dip of
the ground, and every rock and streamlet in the course.
There was the stillness of death on every side; and al-
though Owen stopped more than once to listen, not the
slightest sound could be heard. The gloom and dreari-
ness suited well the “habit of his soul." His own
thoughts were not of the brightest, and his step was slow
and his head downcast as he went.
At last the glimmering of light, hazy and indistinct
from the foggy atmosphere, came into view, and a few
minutes after, he entered the little enclosure of the small
garden which flanked one side of the cabin. The quick
bark of a dog gave token of his approach, and Owen
found some difficulty in making himself recognised by
the animal, although an old acquaintance. This done,
he crept stealthily to the window from which the gleam
of light issued. The shutters were closed, but between
their joinings he obtained a view of all within.
At one side of the fire was Mary—his own Mary, when
last he parted with her. She was seated at a spinning-
wheel, but seemed less occupied with the work, than bent
on listening to some noise without. Phil also stood in
the attitude of one inclining his ear to catch a sound, and
held a musket in his hand like one ready to resist attack.
A farm-servant, a lad of some eighteen, stood at his side,
armed with a horse-pistol, his features betraying no very
equivocal expression of fear and anxiety. Little Patsy
nestled at Mary's side, and with his tiny hands had
grasped her arm closely,
22

St. Patrick's Eve.
They stood there, as if spell-bound. It was evident
they were afraid, by the slightest stir, to lose the chance
of hearing any noise without ; and when Mary at last
lifted up her head, as if to speak, a quick motion of her
brother's hand warned her to be silent. What a history
did that group reveal to Owen, as, with a heart throbbing
fiercely, he gazed upon it! But a few short months back,
and the inmates of that happy home knew not if at night
the door was even latched; the thought of attack or
danger never crossed their minds. The lordly dwellers
in a castle felt less security in their slumbers than did
these peasants; now, each night brought a renewal of
their terrors. It came no longer the season of mutual
greeting around the wintry hearth, the hour of rest and
repose; but a time of anxiety and dread, a gloomy period
of doubt, harassed by every breeze that stirred, and every
branch that moved.
“'Tis nothing this time," said Phil, at last. “Thank
God for that same ! ” and he replaced his gun above the
chimney, while Mary blessed herself devoutly, and seemed
to repeat a prayer to herself. Owen gave one parting
look, and retired as noiselessly as he came.
To creep forth with the dark hours, and stand at this
window, became with Owen, now, the whole business of
life. The weary hours of the day were passed in the
expectancy of that brief season—the only respite he en-
joyed from the corroding cares of his own hard fortune.
The dog, recognising him, no longer barked as he ap-
proached : and he could stand unmolested and look at
that hearth, beside which he was wont once to sit and
feel at home..
Thus was it, as the third week was drawing to a close,
when old Larry, who had ventured down to the village to
make some little purchase, brought back the news, that

335
information had been sworn by the bailiff against Owen
Connor, for threatening him with death, on pain of his
not abandoning his farm. The people would none of
them give any credit to the oath, as none knew of
Owen's return; and the allegation was only regarded as
another instance of the perjuiy resorted to by their
opponents, to crush and oppress them.
"They'll have the police out to-morrow, I hear, to
search after ye; and sure the way ye've kept hid will be
a bad job, if they find ye after all,”
“ If they do, Larry !” said Owen, laughing; “but I
think it will puzzle them to do so.” And the very spirit
of defiance prevented Owen at once surrendering himself
to the charge against him. He knew every cave and
hiding-place of the mountain, from childhood upwards,
and felt proud to think how he could baffle all pursuit,
no matter how persevering his enemies. It was essential,
however, that he should leave his present hiding-place
at once : and no sooner was it dark, than Owen took
leave of old Larry and issued forth. The rain was falling
in torrents, accompanied by a perfect hurricane, as he
left the cabin ; fierce gusty blasts swept down the bleak
mountain-side, and with wild and melancholy cadence
poured along the valley ; the waters of the lake plashed
and beat upon the rocky shore: the rushing torrents, as
they forced their way down the mountain, swelled the
uproar, in which the sound of crashing branches and
even rocks were mingled.
“ 'Tis a dreary time to take to the cowld mountain
for a home,” said Owen, as he drew his thick frieze coat
around him, and turned his shoulder to the storm. “I
hardly think the police, or the king's throops either, will
try a chase after me this night."
There was more of gratified pride in this muttered re-

flection than at first sight might appeai; for Owen felt
a kind of heroism in his own daring at that moment,
that supported and actually encouraged him in his course.
The old spirit of bold defiance, which for ages has
characterised the people; the resolute resistance to
authority, or to tyranny, which centuries have not erased,
was strong in his hardy nature; and he asked for nothing
better, than to pit his own skill, ingenuity, ana endurance
against his opponents for the mere pleasure of the en-
counter.
As there was little question on Owen's mind that no
pursuit of him would take place on such a night, he re-
solved to pass the time till daybreak within the walls of
the old churchyard, the only spot he could think of which
promised any shelter. There was a little cell or crypt
there, where he could safely remain till morning. An
hour's walking brought him to the little gate, the last
time he had entered which, was at his poor father's
funeral.
His reflection, now, was rather on his own altered
condition since that day; but even on that thought
ne suffered himself not to dwell. In fact, a hardy
determination to face the future, in utter forgetfulness of
the past, was the part he proposed to himself; and he
did his utmost to bend his mind to the effort.
As he drew near the little crypt I have mentioned, he
was amazed to see the faint flickering of a fire within it.
At first a superstitious fear held him back, and he
rapidly repeated some prayers to himself; but the emo-
tion was soon over, and he advanced boldly toward it.
“Who's there? stand! or give the word !” said a gruff
voice from within. Owen stood still, but spoke not. The
challenge was like that of a sentry, and he half-feared he
had unwittingly strayed within the precincts of a patrol,

345
“Give the word at once ! or you'll never spake another,"
was the savage speech which, accompanied by a deep
curse, now met his ears, while the click of a gun-cock
was distinctly audible.
"s I'm a poor man, without a home or a shelter,” said
Owen, calmly; "and what's worse, I'm without arms, or
maybe you wouldn't talk so brave.”.
“What's yer name? Where are ye from ?"
“I'm Owen Connor; that's enough for ye, whoever ye
are,' replied he, resolutely : “it's a name I'm not ashamed
or afraid to say, anywhere."
The man within the cell threw a handful of dry furze
upon the smouldering flame, and while he remained con.
cealed himself, took a deliberate survey of Owen as he
stood close to the doorway. “You're welcome, Owen,"
said he, in an altered voice, and one which Owen imme-
diately recognised as that of the old blacksmith, Miles
Regan; “you're welcome, my boy! better late than never,
anyhow !"
“ What do you mean, Miles ? 'Tisn't expecting me
here ye were, I suppose ?”.
“'Tis just that same then, I was expecting this many
a day,” said Miles, as with a rugged grasp of both hands
he drew Owen within the narrow cell. “And ’t’aint me
only was expecting it, but everyone else. Here, avich,
taste this-ye're wet and cowld both; that will put life
in ye—and it never ped the king sixpence.”
And he handed Owen a quart bottle as he spoke, the
odour of which was unmistakable enough, to bear testi-
mony to his words.
“And what brings you here, Miles, in the name of
God?” said Owen, for his surprise at the meeting in-
creased every moment.
" 'Tis your own case, only worse," said the other,

with a drunken laugh, for the poteen had already affected
his head.
“And what's that, if I might make bould ?" said
Owen, rather angrily.
"Just that I got the turn-out, my boy. That new
chap, they have over the property, sould me out, root and
branch; and as I didn't go quiet, ye see, they brought
the polis down, and there was a bit of a fight, to take
the two cows away; and somehow”—here he snatched
the bottle rudely from Owen's hand, and swallowed a
copious draught of it," and, somehow, the corporal was
killed, and I thought it better to be away for awhile
for, at the inquest, though the boys would take the
vestment' they seen him shot by one of his comrades,
there was a bit of a smash in his skull, ye see " here he
gave a low fearful laugh—" that fitted neatly to the top
of my eleven-pound hammer; ye comprehend ?”
Owen’s blocd ran cold as he said, “Ye don't mean it
was you that killed him?"
“ I do then,” replied the other, with a savage grin, as
he placed his face within a few inches of Owen's.
“There's a hundred pounds blood-money for ye, now, if
ye give the information! A hundred pounds,” muttered
he to himself : “musha, I never thought they'd give ten
shillings for my own four bones before !”
Owen scorned to reply to the insinuation of his turn-
ing informer, and sat moodily thinking over the event.
“Well, I'll be going, anyhow," said he rising, for his
abhorrence of his companion made him feel the storm
and the hurricane a far preferable alternative.
“The divil a one foot ye'll leave this, my boy,” said
Miles, grasping him with the grip of his gigantic hand;
“no, no, ma bouchal, 'tisn't so easy airned as ye think;
a hundred pounds, naboclish !"

“Leave me free ! let go my arm !” said Owen, whose
anger now rose at the insolence of this taunt.
“I'll break it across my knee, first,” said the infuriated
ruffian, as he half imitated by a gesture his horrid
threat.
There was no comparison in point of bodily strength
between them; for although Owen was not half the other's
age, and had the advantage of being perfectly sober, the
smith was a man of enormous power, and held him, as
though he were a child in his grasp.
“So that's what you'd be at, my boy, is it?” said
Miles, scoffing ; "it's the fine thrade you choose! but
maybe it's not so pleasant, after all. Stay still there-
be quiet, I say—by—” and here he uttered a most
awful oath — "if you rouse me, I'll paste your brains
against that wall :” and as he spoke, he dashed his
closed fist against the rude and crumbling masonry, with
a force that shook several large stones from their places,
and left his knuckles one indistinguishable mass of blood
and gore.
“That's brave, anyhow,” said Owen, with a bitter
mockery, for his own danger, at the moment, could not
repress his contempt for the savage conduct of the other.
Fortunately, the besotted intellect of the smith made
him accept the speech in a very different sense, and he
said, “There never was the man yet, I wouldn't give
him two blows at me, for one at him, and mine to be the
last.”
“I often heard of that before," said Owen, who saw
that any attempt to escape by main force was completely
out of the question, and that stratagem alone could pre-
sent a chance.
“Did ye ever hear of Dan Lenahan ?" said Miles,
with a grin; "what I did to Dan; I was to fight him

wid one hand, and the other tied behind my back; and
when he came up to shake hands wid me before the fight,
I just put my thumb in my hand, that way, and I smashed
his four fingers over it.”
“ There was no fight that day, anyhow, Miles.”
“ Thrue for ye, boy ; the sport was soon over-raich
me over the bottle,” and with that, Miles finished the
poteen at a draught, and then lay back against the wall,
as if to sleep. Still, he never relinquished his grasp, but,
as he fell off asleep, held him as in a vice.
As Owen sat thus a prisoner, turning over in his mind
every possible chance of escape, he heard the sound of
feet and men's voices rapidly approaching : and, in a few
moments, several men turned into the churchyard, and
came towards the crypt. They were conversing in a low
but hurried voice, which was quickly hushed as they
came nearer.
“What's this !” cried one, as he entered the cell;
“ Miles has a prisoner here !"
“Faix, he has so, Mickey;" answered Owen, for he
recognised in the speaker an old friend and schoolfellow.
The rest came hurriedly forward at the words, and soon
Owen found himself among a number of his former com-
panions. Two or three of the party were namesakes and
relations.
The explanation of his capture was speedily given,
and they all laughed heartily at Owen's account of his
ingenious efforts at flattery.
“Av the poteen held out, Owen dear, ye wouldn't
have had much trouble ; but he can drink two quarts
before he loses his strength.”
In return for his narrative, they freely and frankly told
their own story. They had been out arms-hunting-un-
successfully, however-their only exploit being the burn-

ing of a haggard belonging to a farmer who refused to
join the “rising."
Owen felt greatly relieved to discover, that his old
friends regarded the smith with a horror fully as great as
his own. But they excused themselves for the com-
panionship by saying, “What are we to do with the
crayture? Ye wouldn't have us let him be taken ?"
And thus they were compelled to practise every measure
for the security of one they had no love for, and whose
own excesses increased the hazard tenfold.
The marauding exploits they told of, were, to Owen's
ears, not devoid of a strange interest, the danger alone
had its fascination for him; and, artfully interwoven as
their stories were with sentiments of affected patriotism
and noble aspirations for the cause of their country, they
affected him strongly.
For, strange as it may seem, a devotion to country-
a mistaken sense of national honour-prompted many to
these lawless courses. Vague notions of confiscated
lands to be restored to their rightful possessors; ancient
privileges reconferred; their church once more endowed
with its long-lost wealth and power : such were the
motives of the more high-spirited and independent.
Others sought redress for personal grievances; some
real or imaginary hardship they laboured under ; or,
perhaps, as was not unfrequent, they bore the memory of
some old grudge or malice, which they hoped now to
have an opportunity of requiting. Many were there,
who, like the weak-minded in all popular commotions,
float with the strong tide, whichever way it may run.
They knew not the objects aimed at; they were ignorant
of the intentions of their leaders; but would not lie
under the stain of cowardice among their companions,
nor shrink from any cause where there was danger, if

only for that very reason. Thus was the mass made up,
of men differing in various ways; but all held together
by the common tie of a church and a country. It
might be supposed that the leaders in such a movement
would be those who, having suffered some grievous
wrong, were reckless enough to adventure on any course
that promised vengeance ;-very far from this. The
principal promoters of the insurrection were of the class
of farmers—men well to do, and reputed, in many cases,
wealthy. The instruments by which they worked were
indeed of the very poorer class—the cottier, whose want
and misery had eat into his nature, and who had as little
room for fear as for hope in his chilled heart. Some in-
jury sustained by one of these, some piece of justice
denied him; his ejection from his tenement; a chance
word, perhaps, spoken to him in anger by his landlord
or the agent, were the springs which moved a man like
this, and brought him into confederacy with those who
promised him a speedy repayment of his wrongs, and
fiattered him into the belief that his individual case
had all the weight and importance of a national question.
Many insurrectionary movements have grown into the
magnitude of systematic rebellion from the mere assump-
tion on the part of others, that they were prearranged
and predetermined. The self-importance suggested by
a bold opposition to the law, is a strong agent in
arming men against its terrors. The mock martyrdom
of Ireland is in this way, perhaps, her greatest and least
curable evil.
Owen was, of all others, the man they most wished for
amongst them. Independent of his personal courage and
daring, he was regarded as one fruitful in expedients,
and never deterred by difficulties. This mingled cha-
racter of cool determination and headlong impulse,

made him exactly suited to become a leader; and
many a plot was thought of, to draw him into their
snares, when the circumstances of his fortune thus antici-
pated their intentions.
It would not forward the object of my little tale to
dwell upon the life he now led. It was indeed an
existence full of misery and suffering. To exaggerate
the danger of his position, his companions asserted that
the greatest efforts were making for his capture, rewards
offered, and spies scattered far and wide through the
country; and while they agreed with him that nothing
could be laid to his charge, they still insisted, that were
he once taken, false-swearing and perjury would bring
him to the gallows, “as it did many a brave boy before
him."
Half-starved, and harassed by incessant change of
place; tortured by the fevered agony of a mind halting
between a deep purpose of vengeance and a conscious
sense of innocence, his own daily sufferings soon brought
down his mind to that sluggish state of gloomy despera-
tion, in which the very instincts of our better nature
seem dulled and blunted. “I cannot be worse !" was
his constant expression, as he wandered alone by some
unfrequented mountain-path, or along the verge of some
lonely ravine. “I cannot be worse !” It is an evil
moment that suggests a thought like this!
Each night he was accustomed to repair to the old
churchyard, where some of the “boys," as they called
themselves, assembled to deliberate on future measures,
or talk over the past. It was less in sympathy with
their plans that Owen came, than for the very want of
human companionship. His utter solitude gave him a
longing to hear their voices, and see their faces; while
in their recitals of outrage, he felt that strange pleasure

the sense of injury supplies, at any tale of sorrow and
suffering.
At these meetings the whisky-bottle was never for-
gotten; and while some were under a pledge not to take
more than a certain quantity-a vow they kept most ie-
ligiously-others drank deeply. Among these was Owen.
The few moments of reckless forgetfulness he then en-
joyed were the coveted minutes of his long dreary day,
and he wished for night to come as the last solace that
was left him.
His companions knew him too well, to endeavour by
any active influence to implicate him in their proceed-
ings. They cunningly left the work to time and his
own gloomy thoughts; watching, however, with eager
anxiety, how, gradually, he became more and more in-
terested in all their doings; how, by degrees he ceased
even the half-remonstrance against some deed of un-
necessary cruelty; and listened with animation where
before he but heard with apathy, if not repugnance.
The weeds of evil grow rankest in the rich soil of a heart
whose nature, once noble, has been perverted and de-
based. Ere many weeks passed over, Owen, so far from
disliking the theme of violence and outrage, became
half-angry with his comrades, that they neither proposed
any undertaking to him, nor even asked his assistance
amongst them.
This spirit grew hourly stronger in him; offended
pride worked within his heart during the tedious
days he spent alone, and he could scarcely refrain
from demanding what lack of courage and daring they
saw in him, that he should be thus forgotten and
neglected.
In this frame of mind, irresolute as to whether he
should not propose himself for some hazardous scheme,

or still remain a mere spectator of others, he arrived
one evening in the old churchyard. Of late, “the boys,"
from preconcerted arrangements among themselves, had
ratlier made a show of cold and careless indifference in
their manner to Owen-conduct which deeply wounded
him.
As he approached now the little crypt, he perceived
that a greater number than usual were assembled through
the churchyard, and many were gathered in little knots
and groups, talking eagerly together; a half-nod, a
scarcely muttered “Good-even," was all the salutation
he met, as he moved towards the little cell, where, by
the blaze of a piece of bog-pine, a party were regaling
themselves—the custom and privilege of those who had
been last out on any marauding expedition. A smoking
pot of potatoes and some bottles of whisky formed the
entertainment, at which Owen stood a longing and
famished spectator.
“Will yez never be done there eatin' and crammin'
yerselves ? ” said a gruff voice from the crowd to the
party within ; "and ye know well enough there's busi-
ness to be done to-night.”
“And aint we doing it?" answered one of the feasters.
“ Here's your health, Peter!” and so saying, he took a
very lengthened draught from the “poteen” bottle.
“'Tis the thrade ye like best, anyhow," retorted the
other. “Come, boys ; be quick now !”
The party did not wait a second bidding, but arose
from the place, and removing the big pot to make more
room, they prepared the little cell for the reception of
some other visitors.
“ That's it now! We'll not be long about it. Larry,
have yez the 'deck,' my boy?”.
“There's the book, darlint,” said a short, little, de.

crepid creature, speaking with an asthmatic effort, as he
produced a pack of cards, which, if one were to judge
from the dirt, made the skill of the game consist as
much in deciphering as playing them.
"Where's Sam M'Guire ?” called out the first speaker,
in a voice loud enough to be heard over the whole space
around ; and the name was repeated from voice to voice,
till it was replied to by one who cried-
“Here, Sir; am I wanted ?"
“You are, Sam ; and 'tis yourself's always to the fore
when we need yez.”
"I hope so indeed,” said Sam, as he came forward, a
flush of gratified pride on his hardy cheek. He was a
young, athletic fellow, with a fine manly countenance,
expressive of frankness and candour.
“Luke Heffernan! where's Luke?” said the other.
“ I'm here beside ye,” answered a dark-visaged,
middle-aged man, with the collar of his frieze coat
buttoned high on his face ; "ye needn't be shouting
my name that way—there may be more bad than good
among uz.”
“There's not an informer, any way—if that's what ye
mean," said the other quickly. “Gavan Daly! Call
Gavan Daly, will ye, out there ?" And the words were
passed from mouth to mouth in a minute, but no one
replied to the summons.
“He's not here—Gavan's not here !” was the mur.
mured answer of the crowd, given in a tone that boded
very little in favour of its absent owner.
“Not here ! " said the leader, as he crushed the picce
of paper, from which he read, in his hand; “not here!
Where is he, then? Does any of yez know where's
Gavan Daly ?"
But there was no answer,

i "Can no body tell?-is he sick ?—or is any belonging
to him sick and dying, that he isn't here this night, as he
swore to be ?”
“I saw him wid a new coat on him this morning
early in Oughterarde, and he said he was going to see a
cousin of his down below Oranmore," said a young lad
from the outside of the crowd, and the speaker was in a
moment surrounded by several, anxious to find out some
other particulars of the absent man. It was evident that
the boy's story was far from being satisfactory, and the
circumstance of Daly's wearing a new coat, was one
freely commented on by those who well knew how
thoroughly they were in the power of any who should
betray them.
“He's in the black list this night,” said the leader, as
he motioned the rest to be silent; "that's where I put
him now; and see, all of yez-mind my words—if any
of uz comes to harm, it will go hard but some will be
spared; and if there was only one remaining, he wouldn't
be the cowardly villain not to see vengeance on Gavan
Daly, for what he's done.”
A murmur of indignation at the imputed treachery of
the absent man buzzed through the crowd; while one
fellow, with a face flushed by drink, and eyes bleared and
bloodshot, cried out:
“And are ye to stop here all night, calling for the boy
that's gone down to bethray yez? Is there rone of yez
will take his place ?”
“I will! I will! I'm ready and willin'!” were uttered
by full twenty, in a breath.
“Who will ye have with yez? take your own choice !”
said the leader, turning towards M'Guire and Heffernan,
who stood whispering eagerly together.
“There's the boy I'd take out of five hundred, av he

was the same I knew once,” said M‘Guire, laying his
hand on Owen's shoulder.
“Begorra then, I wondher what ye seen in him lately
to give you a consate out of him," cried Heffernan, with
a rude laugh. "'Tisn't all he's done for the cause any-
way.”
Owen started, and fixed his eyes first on one, then on
the other of the speakers; but his look was rather the
vacant stare of one awakening from a heavy sleep, than
the expression of any angry passion-for want and pri-
vation had gone far to sap his spirit, as well as his bodily
strength.
“There, avich, taste that,” said a man beside him,
who was struck by his pale and wasted cheek, and miser-
able appearance.
Owen almost mechanically took the bottle, and drank
• freely, though the contents was strong poteen.
“Are ye any betther now?” said Heffernan, with a
sneering accent.
“I am,” said Owen, calmly, for he was unconscious of
the insolence passed off on him; “ I'm a deal better."
“Come along, ma bouchal !” cried M‘Guire; “ come
into the little place with us, here."
“What do ye want with me, boys?” asked Owen, look-
ing about him through the crowd.
“'Tis to take a hand at the cards, divil a more," said
an old fellow near, and the speech sent a savage laugh
among the rest.
“I'm ready and willin'," said Owen; “but sorra far-
then I've left me to play; and if the stakes is high-_"
“Faix, that's what they're not,” said Heffernan;
" they're the lowest ever ye played for.”
“Tell me what it is, anyway," cried Owen.
"Just, the meanest thing at all—the life of the bla:

guard that turned yerself out of yer houldin'-- Lucas the
agent.”
“To kill Lucas ?”.
“That same: and if ye don't like the game, turn away
and make room for a boy that has more spirit in him.”
“Who says I ever was afeard ?” said Owen, on whom
now the whisky was working. "Is it Luke Heffernan
dares to face me down ?-come out here, fair, and see
will ye say it again."
“If you won't join the cause, you mustn't be bringing
bad blood among us," cried the leader, in a determined
tone; "there's many a brave boy here to-night would
give his right hand to get the offer you did.” :
“I'm ready-here I am, ready now,” shouted Owen
wildly; "tell me what you want me to do, and see
whether I will or no.”
A cheer broke from the crowd at these words, and all
within his reach stretched out their hands to grasp
Owen's; and commendations were poured on him from
every side.
Meanwhile Heffernan and his companion had cleared
the little crypt of its former occupants, and having heaped
fresh wood upon the fire, sat down before the blaze, and
called out for Owen to join them. Owen took another
draught from one of the many bottles offered by the by-
standers, and hastened to obey the summons.
“Stand back now, and don't speak a word,” cried the
leader, keeping off the anxious crowd that pressed eagerly
forward to witness the game; the hushed murmuring of
the voices showing how deeply interested they felt.
The three players bent their heads forward as they sat,
while Heffernan spoke some words in a low whisper, to
which the others responded by a muttered assent.
“Well, here's success to the undhertakin' anyhow," cried.

he aloud, and filling out a glass of whisky, drank it off;
then passing the liquor to the two others, they followed
his example.
“Will ye like to deal, Owen ?” said M‘Guire; "you're
the new-comer, and we'll give ye the choice.”
“No, thank ye, boys,” said Owen; “ do it yerselves,
one of ye; I'm sure of fair play.”
Heffernan then took the cards, and wetting his thumb
for the convenience of better distributing them, slowly
laid five cards before each player; he paused for a second
before he turned the trump, and in a low voice said: “If
any man's faint-hearted, let him say it now "
“Turn the card round, and don't be bothering us,"
cried M'Guire ; “one 'ud think we never played a game
before."
“Come, be alive," said Owen, in whom the liquor had
stimulated the passion for play.
“What's the thrump-is it a diamond ? look over and
tell us," murmured the crowd nearest the entrance.
“'Tis a spade !—I lay fourpence 'tis a spade !"
“Why wouldn't it be?” said another ; "it's the same
spade will dig Lucas's grave this night!”
“Look! see !” whispered another, “Owen Connor's
won the first thrick! Watch him now! Mind the way
he lays the card down, with a stroke of his fist !”

other.
“Who won that? who took that thrick ?"
“Ould Heffernan, divil fear him! I never see hiin
lose yet."
“No; by Jonas ! 'tis Luke again has it."
“ That's Sam M‘Guire's! See how aizy he takes leid
up."

• Now for it, boys! whisht! here's the last round ?"
and at this moment, a breathless silence prevailed anong
the crowd; for while such as were nearest were eagerly
bent on observing the progress of the game, the more
distant bent their heads to catch every sound that might
indicate its fortune.
“See how Luke grins ! watch his face !” whispered a
low voice. “He doesn't care how it goes, now, he's out
of it !” and so it was. Heffernan had already won
two of the five tricks, and was safe whatever the result
of the last one. The trial lay between M‘Guire and
Owen.
“Come, Owen, my hearty !” said MGuire, as he held
a card ready to play, "you or I for it now; we'll soon
see which the devil's fondest of. There's the two of clubs
for ye !"
“There's the three, then !” said Owen, with a crash of
his hand, as he placed the card over the other.
“And there's the four !” said Heffernan, “and the
:hrick is Sam M‘Guire's."
"Owen Connor's lost !” “Owen's lost !” murmured
the crowd ; and, whether in half-compassion for his defeat,
or grief that so hazardous a deed should be entrusted to
a doubtful hand, the sensation created was evidently of
gloom and dissatisfaction.
“You've a right to take either of us wid ye, Owen,”
said MʻGuire, slapping him on the shoulder. “Luke or
myself must go, if ye want us.”
“No; I'll do it myself,” said Owen, in a low hollow
voice.
“There's the tool, then !" said Heffernan, producing
from the breast of his frieze coat a long horse-pistol, the
stock of which was mended by a clasp of iron belted
round it; “and if it doesn't do its work, 'tis the first

time it ever failed. Ould Miles Cregan, of Gurtane, was
the last that heard it spake.”
Owen took the weapon, and examined it leisurely,
opening the pan and settling the priming, with a finger
that never trembled. As he drew forth the ramrod to try
the barrel, Heffernan said, with a half-grin, “There's two
bullets in it, avich !-enough's as good as a feast.”
Owen sat still and spoke not, while the leader and
Heffernan explained to him the circumstances of the plot
against the life of Mr. Lucas. Information had been
obtained by some of the party, that the agent would leave
Galway on the following evening, on his way to Westport,
passing through Oughterarde and their own village, about
midnight. He usually travelled in his gig, with relays of
horses ready at different stations of the way, one of which
was about two miles distant from the old ruin, on the edge
of the lake—a wild and dreary spot, where stood a soli-
tary cabin, inhabited by a poor man who earned his liveli-
hood by fishing. No other house was within a mile of
this; and here, it was determined, while in the act of
changing horses, the murder should be effected. The
bleak common beside the lake was studded with furze
and brambles, beneath which it was easy to obtain shelter,
though pursuit was not to be apprehended-at least they
judged that the servant would not venture to leave his
master at such a moment; and as for the fisherman,
although not a sworn member of their party, they well
knew he would not dare to inform against the meanest
amongst them.
Owen listened attentively to all these details, and the
accurate directions by which they instructed him on every
step he should take. From the moment he should set
foot within the cover to the very instant of firing, each
little event had its warning.

“Mind !” repeated Heffernan, with a slow, distinct
whisper, “he never goes into the house at all; but if the
night's cowld-as it's sure to be this sayson-he'll be
moving up and down, to keep his feet warm. Cover him
as he turns round; but don't fire the first cover, but wait
till he comes back to the same place again, and then
blaze. Don't stir then, till ye see if he falls : if he does,
be off down the common; but if he's only wounded-but
sure ye'll do better than that!”
“I'll go bail he will !” said M‘Guire. “Sorra fear that
Owen Connor's heart would fail him ! and sure if he likes
me to be wid him—_”.
“No, no !” said Owen, in the same hollow voice as
before, “I'll do it all by myself ; I want nobody.”
6'Tis the very words I said when I shot Lambert
of Kilclunah!" said MʻGuire. “I didn't know him by
looks, and the boys wanted me to take some one to point
him out. “Sorra bit !' says I, 'leave that to me;' and
so I waited in the gripe of the ditch all day, till, about
four in the evening, I seen a stout man wid a white hat
coming across the fields, to where the men was planting
potatoes. So I ups to him wid a letter in my hand, this
way, and my hat off—* Is yer honner Mr. Lambert?'
says I. “Yes,', says he; "what do ye want with me?'
''Tis a bit of a note I've for yer honner,' says I; and
I gav him the paper. He tuck it and opened it; but
troth it was little matter there was no writin' in it, for he
wouldn't have lived to read it through. I sent the ball
through his heart, as near as I stand to ye; the wadding
was burning his waistcoat when I left him. “God save
you !' says the men, as I went across the potato-field.
• Save you kindly !' says I. "Was that a shot we heard ?'
says another. “Yes,' says I ; 'I was fright'ning the crows;'
and sorra bit, but that's a saying they have against me

ever since." These last few words were said in a simper
of modesty, which, whether real or affected, was a strange
sentiment at the conclusion of such a tale.
The party soon after separated, not to meet again for
several nights; for the news of Lucas's death would of
course be the signal for a general search through the coun-
try, and the most active measures to trace the murderer.
It behoved them, then, to be more than usually careful not
to be absent from their homes and their daily duties for
some days at least : after which they could assemble in
safety as before.
Grief has been known to change the hair to gray in a
single night; the announcement of a sudden misfortune has
palsied the hand that held the ill-omened letter ; but I
question if the hours that are passed before the commission
of a great crime, planned and meditated beforehand, do
not work more fearful devastation on the human heart,
than all the sorrows that ever crushed humanity. Ere
night came, Owen Connor seemed to have grown years
older. In the tortured doubtings of his harassed mind he
appeared to have spent almost a lifetime since the sun
last rose. He had passed in review before him each
phase of his former existence, from childhood-free, care-
less, and happy childhood—to days of boyish sport and
revelry; then came the period of his first manhood, with
its new ambitions and hopes. He thought of these, and
how, amid the humble circumstances of his lowly fortune,
he was happy. What would he have thought of him who
should predict such a future as this for him? How could
he have believed it? And yet the worst of all remained
to come. He tried to rally his courage and steel his
heart, by repeating over the phrases so frequent among
his companions. “Sure, aint I driven to it ? is it my
füllt if I take to this. or theirs that compelled me?" and

359
such like. But these words came with no persuasive force
in the still hour of conscience: they were only effectual
amid the excitement and tumult of a multitude, when
men's passions were high, and their resolutions daring.
“ It is too late to go back,” muttered he, as he arose from
the spot, where, awaiting nightfall, he had lain hid for
several hours; "they mustn't call me a coward, any
way."
As Owen reached the valley the darkness spread far
and near; not a star could be seen; great masses of cloud
covered the sky, and hung down heavily, midway upon
the mountains. There was no rain ; but on the wind came
from time to time a drifted mist, which showed that the
air was charged with moisture. The ground was still wet
and plashy from recent heavy rain. It was indeed a cheer-
less night and a cheerless hour; but not more so than the
heart of him who now, bent upon his deadly purpose,
moved slowly on towards the common.
On descending towards the lake-side, he caught a
passing view of the little village, where a few lights yet
twinkled, and flickering stars that shone within some hum-
ble home. What would he not have given to be but the
meanest peasant there, the poorest creature that toiled and
sickened on his dreary way! He turned away hurriedly,
and with his hand pressed heavily on his swelling heart
walked rapidly on. “It will soon be over now," said
Owen; he was about to add, with the accustomed piety
of his class, “thank God for it,” but the words stopped
in his throat; and the dreadful thought flashed on him,
*Is it when I am about to shed His creature's blood, I
should say this ? "
He sat down upon a large stone beside the lake, at
a spot where the road came down to the water's edge,
and where none could pass unobserved by him. He

had often fished from that very rock when a boy, and
eaten his little dinner of potatoes beneath its shelter.
Here he sat once more, saying to himself as he did so,
“ 'Tis an ould friend, any way, and I'll just spend my
last night with him ;" for so in his mind he already
regarded his condition. The murder effected, he deter-
mined to make no effort to escape. Life was of no value
to him. The snares of the conspiracy had entangled
him, but his heart was not in it.
As the night wore on, the clouds lifted, and the wind,
increasing to a storm, bore them hurriedly through the
air ; the waters of the lake, lashed into waves, beat heavily
on the low shore; while the howling blast swept through
the mountain-passes, and over the bleak wide plain, with
a rushing sound. The thin crescent of a new moon
could be seen from time to time as the clouds rolled
past : too faint to shed any light upon the earth, it
merely gave form to the dark masses that moved before
it.
“I will do it here," said Owen, as he stood and looked
upon the dark water that beat against the foot of the
rock; “ here, on this spot.”
He sat for some moments with his ear bent to listen,
but the storm was loud enough to make all other sounds
inaudible; yet, in every noise he thought he heard the
sound of wheels, and the rapid tramp of a horse's feet.
The motionless attitude, the cold of the night, but more
than either, the debility brought on by long fasting and
hunger, benumbed his limbs, so that he felt almost unable
to make the least exertion, should any such be called for.
He therefore descended from the rock and moved
along the road; at first, only thinking of restoring lost
animation to his frame, but at length, in a half uncon.
sciousness, he had wandered upwards of two miles beyond

roof had'a ince the home, in front, the
the little lovei where the change of horses was to take
place. Just as he was on the point of returning, he
perceived at a little distance, in front, the walls of a now
ruined cabin, once the home of the old smith. Part of
the roof had fallen in, the doors and windows were gone,
the fragment of an old shutter alone remained, and this
banged heavily back and forwards as the storm rushed
through the wretched hut.
Almost without knowing it, Owen entered the cabin,
and sat down beside the spot where once the forge-fire
used to burn. He had been there, too, when a boy many
a time-many a story had he listened to in that same
corner; but why think of this now? The cold blast seemed
to freeze his very blood — he felt his heart as if con-
gealed within him. He sat cowering from the piercing
blast for some time; and at last, unable to bear the sensa-
tion longer, determined to kindle a fire with the fragments
of the old shutter. For this purpose he drew the charge
of the pistol, in which there were three bullets, and not
merely two, as Heffernan had told him. Laying these
carefully down in his handkerchief, he kindled a light with
some powder, and with the dexterity of one not unaccus-
tomed to such operations, soon saw the dry sticks blazing
on the hearth. On looking about he discovered a few sods
of turf and some dry furze, with which he replenished his
fire, till it gradually became a warm and cheering blaze.
Owen now reloaded the pistol, just as he had found it.
There was a sense of duty in his mind to follow out every
instruction he received, and deviate in nothing. This
done, he held his numbed fingers over the blaze, and
bared his chest to the warm glow of the fire.
The sudden change from the cold night-air to the
warmth of the cabin soon made him drowsy. Fatigue and
watching aiding the inclination to sleep, he was obliged to

move about the hut, and even expose himself to the chill
blast, to resist its influence. The very purpose on which
he was bent, so far from dispelling sleep, rather induced
its approach; for, strange as it may seem, the concentra-
tion with which the mind brings its power to bear on any
object will overcome all the interest and anxiety of our
natures, and bring on sleep from very weariness.
He slept, at first, calmly and peacefully-exhaustion
would have its debt acquitted—and he breathed as softly
as an infant. At last, when the extreme of fatigue was
passed, his brain began to busy itself with flitting thoughts
and fancies,—some long-forgotten day of boyhood, some
little scene of childish gaiety, flashed across him, and he
dreamed of the old mountain-lake, where so often he
watched the wide circles of the leaping trout, or tracked
with his eye the foamy path of the wild water-hen, as she
skimmed the surface. Then suddenly his chest heaved
and fell with a strong motion, for with lightning's speed
the current of his thoughts was changed; his heart was
in the mad trimult of a faction-fight, loud shouts were
ringing in his ears, the crash of sticks, the cries of pain,
entreaties for mercy, execrations and threats, rung around
him, when one figure moved slowly before his astonished
gaze, with a sweet smile upon her lips, and love in her
long-lashed eyes. She murmured his name; and now
he slept with a low-drawn breath, his quivering lips re-
peating, “ Mary!”
Another and a sadder change was coming. He was
on the mountains, in the midst of a large assemblage of
wild-looking and haggard men, whose violent speech and
savage gestures well suited their reckless air. A loud
shout welcomed him as he came amongst them, and a cry
of “Here's Owen Connor-Owen at last!" and a hundred
üands were stretched out to grasp his, but as suddenly

303
withdrawn, on seeing that his hands were not bloodstained
nor gory.
· He shuddered as he looked upon their dripping fingers;
but he shuddered still more as they called him “Coward !”
What he said he knew not; but in a moment they were
gathered round him, and clasping him in their arms; and
now, his hands, his cheeks, his clothes, were streaked with
blood; he tried to wipe the foul-stains out, but his fingers
grew clotted, and his feet seemed to plash in the red
stream, and his savage comrades laughed fiercely at his
efforts, and mocked him.
“What am I, that you should clasp me thus ?” he
cried ; and a voice from his inmost heart replied, “A
murderer !” The cold sweat rolled in great drops down
his brow, while the foam of agony dewed his pallid lips,
and his frame trembled in a terrible convulsion. Confused
and fearful images of bloodshed and its penalty, the crime
and the scaffold, commingled, worked in his maddened
brain. He heard the rush of feet, as if thousands were
hurrying on, to see him die, and voices that swelled like
the sea at midnight. Nor was the vision all unreal: for
already two men had entered the hut.
The dreadful torture of his thoughts had now reached
its climax, and with a bound Owen sprang from his
sleep, and cried in a shriek of heart-wrung anguish, “No,
never-I am not a murderer. Owen Connor can meet
his death like a man, but not with blood upon him.”
“Owen Connor! Owen Connor, did you say?" repeated
one of the two who stood before him; “are you, then,
Owen Connor ?"
“I am,” replied Owen, whose dreams were still the
last impression on his mind. “I give myself up ;-do
what ye will with me ;-hang, imprison, or transport me;
I'll never gainsay you."

St. Patrick's Eve.
“Owen, do you not know me?" said the other, remov.
ing his travelling cap, and brushing back the hair from
his forehead.
“No, I know nothing of you," said he, fiercely.
“Not remember your old friend—your landlord's son,
Owen ? "
Owen stared at him without speaking; his parted lips
and fixed gaze evidencing the amazement which came
over him.
“You saved my life, Owen,” said the young man,
horror-struck by the withered and wasted form of the
peasant.
“And you have made me this," muttered Owen, as
he let fall the pistol from his bosom. “Yes,” cried he,
with an energy very different from before, “I came out
this night, sworn to murder that man beside you-your
agent, Lucas; my soul is perjured if my hands are not
bloody."
Lucas instantly took a pistol from the breast of his
coat, and cocked it; while the ghastly whiteness of his
cheek showed he did not think the danger was yet over.
“Put up your weapon,” said Owen, contemptuously.
“What would I care for it, if I wanted to take your life?
Do you think the likes of me has any hould on the
world ?” and he laughed a scornful and bitter laugh.
“How is this, then?” cried Leslie; “is murder so light
a crime that a man like this does not shrink from it?”
“The country," whispered Lucas, “is indeed in a fear-
ful state. The rights of property no longer exist among
us. That fellow-because he lost his farm ".
“Stop, Sir!” cried Owen, fiercely; “I will deny no-
thing of my guilt, but lay not more to my charge than is
true. Want and misery have brought me low-destitu-
tion and recklessness still lower--but if I swore to have

365
your life this night, it was not for any vengeance of
my own.”
“Ha! then there is a conspiracy !” cried Lucas,
hastily. “We must have it out of you—every word of
it-or it will go harder with yourself.”
Owen's only reply was a bitter laugh; and from that
moment he never uttered another word. All Lucas's threats,
'all Leslie's entreaties, were powerless and vain. The
very allusion to becoming an informer was too revolting
to be forgiven, and he firmly resolved to brave any and
everything, rather than endure the mere proposal.
They returned to Galway as soon as the post-boys had
succeeded in repairing the accidental breakage of the
harness, which led to the opportune appearance of the
landlord and his agent in the hut; Owen accompanying
them without a word or a gesture.
So long as Lucas was present, Owen never opened
his lips; the dread of committing himself, or in any
way implicating one amongst his companions, deterred
him ; but when Leslie sent for him, alone, and asked him
the circumstances which led him to the eve of so great
a crime, he confessed all—omitting nothing, save such
passages as might involve others—and even to Leslie he
was guarded on this topic.
The young landlord listened with astonishment and
sorrow to the peasant's story. Never till now did he
conceive the mischiefs neglect and abandonment can pro-
pagate, nor of how many sins mere poverty can be the
parent. He knew not before that the very endurance
of want can teach another endurance, and make men
hardened against the terrors of the law and its inflictions.
He was not aware of the condition of his tenantry; he
wished them all well off and happy; he had no self-
accusings of a grudging nature, nor an oppressive dispo

St. Patrick's Eve.
sition, and he absolved himself of any hardships that
originated with “ the agent.”
The cases brought before his notice rather disposed
him to regard the people as wily and treacherous, false
in their pledges and unmindful of favours; and many,
doubtless, were so; but he never enquired how far their
experience had taught them, that dishonesty was the best
policy, and that trick and subtlety are the only aids to
the poor man. He forgot, above all, that they had nei-
ther examples to look up to nor imitate, and that when
once a people have become sunk in misery, they are the
ready tools of any wicked enough to use them for vio-
lence, and false enough to persuade them that outrage
can be their welfare ; and, lastly, he overlooked the great
fact, that in a corrupt and debased social condition, the
evils which, under other circumstances, would be borne
with a patient trust in future relief, are resented in a
spirit of recklessness; and that men soon cease to shud-
der at a crime, when frequency has accustomed them to
discuss its details.
I must not-I dare not dwell longer on this theme.
Leslie felt all the accusations of an awakened conscience.
He saw himself the origin of many misfortunes-of
evils of whose very existence he never heard before. Ere
Owen concluded his sad story, his mind was opened to
some of the miseries of Ireland ; and when he had ended
he cried, “I will live at home with ye, amongst ye all,
Owen! I will try if Irishmen cannot learn to know who
is their true friend ; and while repairing some of my own
faults, mayhap I may remedy some of theirs.”
“Oh! why did you not do this before I came to my
ruin ?" cried Owen, in a passionate burst of grief; for
the poor fellow all along had given himself up for lost,
and imagined that his own plea of guilt must bring him

367
to the gallows. Nor was it till after much persuasion
and great trouble that Leslie could reconcile him to him-
self, and assure him that his own fortunate repentance
had saved him from destruction.
“You shall go back to your mountain-cabin, Owen :
you shall have your own farm again, and be as happy as
ever," said the young man. “ The law must deal with
those who break it, and no one will go farther than myself
to vindicate the law; but I will also try if kindness and
fair-dealing will not save many from the promptings of
their own hearts, and teach men that, even here, the
breach of God's commandments can bring neither peace
nor happiness.”
My object in this little story being to trace the career
of one humble man through the trials and temptations
incident to his lot in life, I must not dwell upon the
wider theme of national disturbance. I have endea-
voured-how weakly, I am well aware—to show, that
social disorganisation, rather than political grievances, are
the source of Irish outrage; that neglect and abandon-
ment of the people on the part of those who stood in
the position of friends and advisers towards them, have
disseminated evils deeper and greater than even a tyranny
could have engendered. But for this desertion of their
duties, there had been no loss of their rightful influence,
nor would the foul crime of assassination now stain the
name of our land. With an educated and resident pro-
prietary, Ireland could never have become wliat she now
is; personal comfort, if no higher motive could be ap-
pealed to, would have necessitated a watchful observance
of the habits of the people—the tares would have been
weeded from the wheat; the evil influence of bad men
would not have been suffered to spread its contagion
through the land.

St. Patrick's Eve.
Let me not be supposed for a moment as joining in
the popular cry against the landlords of Ireland. As
regards the management of their estates, and the libe-
rality of their dealings with their tenantry, they are, ol
course, with the exceptions which every country exhibits,
a class as blameless and irreproachable as can be found
anywhere—their real dereliction being, in my mind,
their desertion of the people. To this cause, I believe,
can be traced every one of the long catalogue of disas-
ters to which Ireland is a prey : the despairing poverty,
reckless habits, indifference to the mandates of the law,
have their source here. The impassioned pursuit of any
political privilege, which they are given to suppose will
alleviate the evils of their state, has thrown them into the
hands of the demagogue, and banded them in a league,
which they assume to be national. You left them to
drift on the waters, and you may now be shipwrecked
among the floating fragments !
My tale is ended. I have only one record more to
add. The exercise of the law, assisted by the energy and
determination of a fearless and resident landlord, at length
suppressed outrage and banished those who had been its
originators. Through the evidence of Gavan Daly, whose
treachery had been already suspected, several of the leaders
were found guilty, and met the dreadful penalty of their
crimes. The fact of an informer having been found
amongst them, did, however, far more to break up this
unholy league that all the terrors of the law, unassisted
by such aid; but it was long before either peace or hap-
piness shed their true blessings on that land : mutual dis-
trust, the memory of some lost friend, and the sad con-
viction of their own iniquity, darkened many a day, and
made even a gloomier depth than they had ever known
in their poverty.

There came, however, a reverse for this. It was a fine
day in spring—the mountain and the lake were bright
in the sunshine-the valley, rich in the promise of the
coming year, was already green with the young wheat-
the pleasant sounds of happy labour rose from the fields
fresh-turned by the plough—the blue smoke curled into
thin air from many a cabin, no longer mean-looking and
miserable as before, but with signs of comfort around, in
the trim hedge of the little garden and the white walls
that glistened in the sun.
Towards the great mountain above the lake, however,
many an eye was turned from afar, and many a peasant
lingered to gaze upon the scene which now marked its
rugged face.
Along the winding path which traced its zigzag course
from the lake-side to the little glen where Owen's cabin
stood, a vast procession could be seen moving on foot and
on horseback. Some in country cars, assisted up the steep
ascent by men's strong shoulders; others mounted in
twos and threes upon some slow-footed beast; but the
greater number walking or rather clambering their way—for
in their eagerness to get forward, they, each moment, de-
serted the path to breast the ferny mountain-side. The
scarlet cloaks of the women, as they fluttered in the wind,
and their white caps, gave a brilliancy to the picture,
which, as the masses emerged from the depth of some
little dell and disappeared again, had all the semblance
of some gorgeous panorama. Nor was eye the only sense
gladdened by the spectacle—for even in the valley could
be heard the clear ringing laughter as they went along,
and the wild cheer of merriment that ever and anon
burst forth from happy hearts, while, high above all, the
pleasant sounds of the bagpipe rose, as, seated upon an
ass, and entrusted to the guidance of a boy, the musician

moved along : his inspiriting strains taken advantage of
at every spot of level ground by some merry souls, who
would not “lose so much good music.”
As the head of the dense column wound its way up-
ward, one little group could be seen by those below, and
were saluted by many a cheer and the waving of hand-
kerchiefs. These were a party, whose horses and gear
seemed far better than the rest; and among them rode
a gentleman mounted on a strong pony-his chief care
was bestowed less on his own beast, than in guiding that
of a young country girl, who rode beside him. She was
enveloped in a long blue cloak of dark cloth, beneath
which she wore a white dress; a white ribbon floated
through her dark hair, too; but in her features and the
happy smile upon her lip, the bride was written more
palpably than in all these.
High above her head, upon a pinnacle of rock, a man
stood gazing at the scene; at his side a little child of some
four or five years old, whose frantic glee seemed perilous
in such a place, while his wild accents drew many an up-
ward glance from those below, as he cried
“See, Nony, see! Mary is coming to us at last !"
This, too, was a “St. Patrick's Eve," and a happy one.
May Ireland see many such !

A NEW EDUCATIONAL WORK OF GREAT VALUE.
Just ready, folio, boards, price 55., with 500 Original Wood Engravings.
WARD AND LOCK'S
PICTORIAL ATLAS OF NATURE.
MEN, ANIMALS, AND PLANTS OF ALL QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE.
FOR HOME AND SCHOOL USE.
In no department of popular education has the progress that characterises our time
been more distinctly marked than in the study of Geography; and nowhere have
the enlarged views of the present day produced a more complete change in the
method of tuition and in the scope of the subject. Geography must no longer be
taught as a mere study of names, intermingled with certain statistical details of
population, distances, measurements of altitudes, &c. A good geographical know-
ledge of any given quarter of the globe, or of a separate country, must now include
a certain familiarity with the characteristic productions of the quarter or country in
question, the types it presents in nations, animals, and plants. Thus, ETHNOGRAPHY,
the study of races ; ZOOLOGY, the study of animals ; and BOTANY, the study of
plants, are all to some extent associated with Geography.
In the improved state of the science of Geography, additional appliances have
become necessary for its practical study. The atlas of maps, however complete it
may be, only presents one aspect of the subject. The student now requires not only
to understand the map that teaches him the topography of a country :- when he
has made himself familiar with the surface of a part of the globe, he requires to be
taught what that region has to show as regards inhabitants and animal and
vegetable productions.
WARD AND LOCK's PicTORIAL ATLAS OF NATURE has been prepared with a
view of meeting this want. In a series of FIFTEEN LARGE PLATES it places before
the eyes of the student the typical forms of the nations, animals, and plants of the
various parts of the world. Each plate contains a map, around which the types are
grouped; and numbers inserted in this map, and corresponding with others in
the pictorial illustrations, show the learner where the races of men, and the plants
and animals depicted, have their homes.
The greatest care has been taken to render the atlas strictly educational by the
utmost accuracy and truth to nature in the pictures. The plants have been drawn
by botanical artists, the animals are not imaginative or fancy sketches, but
zoologically correct, and the great majority of heads of men and women are from
photographs taken from life, or else sketches from the rote books of travellers, to
whom the originals have sat. In many cases the scale of proportion in which an
animal or plant has been drawn is given. The animals are represented, where prac-
ticable, surrounded by the scenery of their native homes; besides the plants, the
most important parts, such as flowers, fruit, leaves, &c., are separately given to
draw the attention of the student especially to their curious or useiul points.
Thus the ATLAS OF NATURE becomes a very necessary companion volume to
the usual atlas of political geography.
In the schoolroom and the family circle alike it will be found most useful and
welcome. A teacher, with one of these plates before him, has only to enlarge upon
the notes which have been added in the form of suggestive information, to produce
a lecture-lesson that can hardly fail to interest his class. Those engaged in tuition
will readily see how much time and labour are saved, in the way of explanation, and
how much more vivid an impression is produced than by words alone, when a picture
of the object itself is placed before the learner, and his faculty of comparison and
analysis is brought into action.
For self-tuition, those learners, now so numerous, who are educating them.
selves by means of manuals, will find WARD & LOCK's ATLAS OF NATURE an ever
present help, that will lighten their labours by conveying to the eye, in its clearly
and correctly drawn pictures, the explanation of much they will find difficult in
their books.
The utility of the ATLAS OF NATURE is not confined to the study of geography
even in its widest sense. The Student of Natural History, and of Botany, will
find in it an equally useful and suggestive companion.

A NEW DOMESTIC CYCLOPÆDIA.
IMPORTANT Notice.—Now ready, at all Booksellers' and Railway Bookstalls,
A NEW DOMESTIC CYCLOPÆDIA,
FORMING A COMPANION VOLUME TO
“Mrs. BEETON'S BOOK of HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT"
(of which the 337th Thousand is now on sale),
ENTITLED
WARD AND LOCK'S
HOME BO O K.
With numerous full-page Coloured and other Plates, and about
600 Illustrations in the Text.
Crown 8vo, half-roan, 75. 6d. ; half-calf, 10s. 6d.
The enormous popularity of “Mrs. BERTON's Book of HOUSEHOLD MANAGE-
MENT" has induced the Publishers to prepare, under the above title, a Companion
Work, which they hope will be received with an equal amount of favour. The ain
of the Home Book is to make Home the abode of Comfort, Elegance, and Happi-
ness. Among the subjects treated of will be found :-
The Way to Build, Buy, Rent, and Home Dressmaking and Millinory.
Furnish a House.
Fancy and Art Needlework.
Taste in the House.
Talks on the Toilet.
Economical Housekeeping.
Modern Etiquette.
The Management of Children.
Employment of Leisure Hours.
Home Needlework.
Mrs. Beeton's Book of HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, as all are aware, deals
principally with food and the various modes of its preparation. There are many
other matters in connection with the Household, in which inexperienced and even
experienced housekeepers need instruction and guidance. These are fully dis.
cussed in WARD AND LOCK's Home Book. The work contains countless directions
on matters about which everyone is eager to know something, but which are
usually left to the expensive teaching of individual experience.
The various departments of the Home Book have been arranged with clearness
and method, and every care has been taken to render the information accurate
and trustworthy. The instructions given are the result of personal knowledge
and actual discovery and handiwork.
The HOME Book is fully Illustrated, and the illustrations will be found to add
greatly, not only to the attractiveness of the work, but to the clearness of its
information.
** Every person possessing “Mrs. BERTON's Book of HOUSEHOLD MANAGE-
MENT" should not fail to secure at once a copy of the valuable Companion Work,
“ WARD AND LOCK's HOME Book.” The Housekeeper possessing the two will
have a Library by whose aid everything will go well, and family life be happior
and more prosperous every day.

points of excellence to be found in it, and feel sure that this valuable work will com-
mand the favour of the public. The following are the principal points to which
attention is called :-
1. Comprehensiveness. -New words, that the progress of science, art, and
philosophy has rendered necessary as additions to the vocabulary, and thousands of
compound words have been introduced.
2. Brevity:--To ensure this, care has been taken to avoid redundancy of ex-
planation, while every possible meaning of each word has been given.
3. Pronunciation.-Those who may use it will not be puzzled and confused
with any arbitrary system of phonetic signs, similar to those usually found in Pro-
nouncing Dictionaries. Every word of two syllables and more is properly divided
and accented ; and all silent letters are put in italics.
4. Etymology.-The words are arranged in groups, each group being placed
under the principal word to which its members are closely allied. Words similarly
spelt, but having distinct etymologies, are separated according to their derivation.
5. Illustrations.-40 pages of Illustrations of various objects given, to assigt
students in arriving at a clear perception of that which is indicated by the 123
