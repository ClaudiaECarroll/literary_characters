PREFACE.
"Oxford Days" is not shaped on the lines of
either Verdant Green or Tom Brown at Oxford.
Its purpose, rather, is to furnish a practical guide
to all the features of University life; but it has
been thought that, by adopting the narrative
form, the dry bones of a handbook may be made
to live.

OXFORD DAYS;
OR
HOW ROSS GOT HIS DEGREE.
CHAPTER I.
GONE TO OXFORD.
THERE was a long discussion between the Vicar
of Porchester and Mr. Ross, the lawyer, as they
walked together after evening service to the
vicarage. Frank Ross was just eighteen, the
eldest of six brothers. He was still at school,
but it was time for him to go to the University.
Oxford had been chosen—not from any notion of
superiority to Cambridge, but simply because of
school and home associations. The difficulty was
the choice of a college. The vicar-a well-to-do
bachelor—an old Eton and Christ-Church man,
advised his own college. But Mr. Ross was
frightened. “Christ-Church” to him had ever

been a terror, and meant waste of time and money,
in the shape of cards, drink, and horse-flesh ; and
all the vicar's eloquence could not shake his un-
founded prejudice. The result of the discussion
was that Mr. Ross decided to write to a friend at
Oxford, settled there as a "coach;" and also to
Mr. Rickards, a country doctor, with a family
larger even than his own. The doctor's answer
was as follows :—
"Deah Eoss,—My boy is going to Brasenose: at least,
he goes up in May to try for a close scholarship. I can
give you no advice, as I know nothing about the place. I
sent him to the Hereford Cathedral School by a fluke some
years ago; and as there are scholarships and exhibitions
from the school to Brasenose, I am saved the difficulty of
choosing a college.
"Yours truly,
"W. ElCKAEDS."
The vicar explained that a "close" scholarship
was, like other scholarships, a sum of money paid
annually for four or five years as a prize, but
differed from them in being confined to competi-
tion among boys from certain schools; and that
the value of them varied from 45Z . to 80Z. per
annum, part being paid in money, and part
made up in allowances in the way of diminished

3
fees. The letter from the "coach" was more
valuable:—
"Deab Me. Eoss,—So much depends on your son's
abilities, your own means and wishes, that I cannot answer
your question as to the best college, off-hand. I think I
may assume that you do not want him to spend more money
than is absolutely necessary; and possibly that you would
wish him to ' go in for honours ' instead of taking a Pass
Degree, that is, offering the smallest possible number of
subjects for examination. I need hardly say that a high
degree in honours opens the way to a Fellowship, or at any
rate to good masterships in schools; and is, in fact, a dis-
tinct help, directly and indirectly, not only in educational,
but in all professions.
"It is far better for a lad to go to a good college, even
though he is unable to obtain a scholarship or any other
college endowment, than to go to an inferior college, where
he may succeed in getting pecuniary assistance. To illustrate
what I mean: I believe, in the long run, it would be wiser
to send your son as a commoner to Balliol than as a scholar
to Wadham. If, from a pecuniary point of view, you do
not care for him to get a scholarship, nor want him to read
for honours, and are not particular as to whether he spends
3007. or 500£. a year (or even more), I should send him to
Christ-Church, Brasenose, Exeter, or University. The first
two especially were in my day emphatically popular colleges,
and I believe are so still. But I would not send him to
either unless you are fully prepared for the amount of
expenditure which I have named. Possibly you might like
our only denominational college—Keble. He would be most
carefully looked after in every way, and his expenses kept

within a fixed limit. The Warden and Tutors devote their
whole energies to their men, and the men themselves speak
in the most affectionate terms of them—a most exceptional
fact, I assure you. But I must warn you that the religious
tone of the college is distinctly pronounced, and inclines to
ritualistic rather than to evangelical doctrines.
"If your son's college life will be a pinch to you (you
will allow me to speak thus plainly on such a question),
send him as an Unattached Student. But here, again, j-ou
and he should clearly understand that the life of an un-
attached student is isolated, and quite unlike the life of the
college undergraduate. The only exception to this state-
ment is when an undergraduate migrates, as for various
reasons sometimes he is obliged, from his college to the
body of the Unattached. His society, being already formed,
remains -unbroken. I should fancy your choice will lie
between New College, Corpus, Paul's, and Balliol. A
scholarship at either means that the scholar is capable, with
industrj', of gaining the highest honours in his future
University examinations. On the whole, I think, I incline
to Paul's. Unfortunately, you have just missed the exami-
nation for scholarships. There is, however, an ordinary
matriculation examination for commoners in about three
weeks' time. If your son holds a good position in his
school, he ought to have no difficulty in passing even at this
short notice, for the subjects are those which are read in
forms lower than the highest at all schools. I shall be
happy to do anything further in the matter for you that I
can. He should come prepared for residence, in the event of
his passing. The examination begins on the Wednesday
after Easter, and will be over in time for successful candidates
to ' come into residence' with the other men on the following

to the rooms. For this, say 101. The immediate payments,
therefore, amount to 21. 10s. + SOL + 101. = 421. 10s.
The payment for the furniture must be made early in term;
and the establishment charges, tuition fees, expenses of
board and rent, are paid terminally." 1
So Paul's was chosen, and a letter of applica-
tion forwarded to the Master f and Frank, who
was then at home for the Easter vacation, com-
menced polishing up his work in view of the
approaching examination. On Easter Tuesday
he left home by an early train, with a note to
Mr. Wodehouse in his pocket. That gentleman
entertained him at dinner with a long list of
examination stories, and about nine o'clock
marched him off to the Clarendon Hotel, where,
with a word to the landlady, he left him, nervous
at the thought of the morrow, but conscious of
his own dignity and the near approach of the
manhood which is supposed to date from matricu-
lation.

It was with some difficulty that Frank preserved
his self-composure in the presence of the waiters,
as he sat at breakfast in the " Clarendon " coffee-
room. He did not particularly enjoy his meal,
and, in obedience to Mr. Wodehouse's injunctions,
left at half-past nine to make his way to Paul's.
After one or two mistakes, he succeeded in finding
the college gates. His anxiety as to his next
step was set at rest by the sight that met him,
About a dozen boys (to be called men after
matriculation) were hanging about the Lodge, in
various typical conditions of mind and body—
some completely at their ease, chatting uncon-
cernedly; others standing nervously alone. Most
wore black coats and chimney-pot hats — the
costume that only a few years ago was rigorously
insisted on. A few through ignorance, or in
obedience to the spirit of the day, wore defiantly
light suits and bowler hats. Frank, to his great
delight, found a school-fellow whose coming up
had, like his own, been hurriedly decided in the
vacation. The two friends had not much time
for conversation, for in a few minutes a respect-
able middle-aged man, whom they knew after-
wards to be the Porter, said, "You are to walk

Oxford Days,
this way, gentlemen, please," and conducted them
to the College-Hall. It is a fine old place, with
dark oak panels, coloured windows, portraits, and
coats-of-arms; and to the boy up in Oxford for
his first visit, and that visit so solemn a one as
matriculation, there is an unspeakable charm, and
a novelty sobered into grandeur, about everything.
How the grave faces of the college founders and
celebrities looked down upon the wondering eyes!
Bishop and knight, king and duchess—there
they stared! How the light streamed through
the coloured windows! Who could tell? Per-
haps one day, Frank thought, when he was a
rich man, he might have that one vacant win-
dow filled, or some of his descendants might
present to the college a portrait of Sir Francis
Ross, attired in wig and gown, one of Her
Majesty's—or rather, perhaps, His Majesty's—
judges, if not Lord Chancellor.
He started abruptly from his dreams, and came
back to the first rung on the ladder that was
leading to such prospective fame. There before
him stretched three lines of tables and benches
down the length of the hall. Across the end, on
a slightly-raised dais, ran another table, where

the handsome chairs indicated beings superior to
undergraduates. It was, in fact, the High table,
where the Master and Fellows dined, and any
resident Masters of Arts who cared to do so.
This morning it was devoted to the more
serious purposes of examination. Ten ink-bottles,
fifteen blotting-bads, fifteen sheets of white paper
printed, with a few sheets of blue paper and two
or three quill pens lying by each: that was the
fare this morning—" the feast of reason " that
was in such strong contrast to the "flow of soul"
that would grace the table at six o'clock that
evening.
One of the junior Fellows was in charge of the
examination. He was reading the Times as Frank
and his companions entered, sitting on the table,
with his legs dangling in a graceful attitude of
studied negligence. He took no notice of the
victims, till the Porter had conducted them to the
table and motioned them to take seats. Then he
looked up from his newspaper and said,—
"You will have till half-past twelve. Write
your names clearly; and please bear in mind
that we expect answers from both books of
Euclid."


## p. 10 (#18) ##############################################

Oxford Days.
Then he resumed his newspaper and adopted a
more dignified attitude.
Frank looked at his questions. Eleven in all;
some definitions, six propositions from the first
book, and four from the second. He wrote his
name at the head of his paper, and made a great
blot in doing so. His hand grew hot. He dashed
at the first definition,—
"A circle is a plane figure contained in one
straight line."
His pen spluttered warningly at the word
straight. A blot fell, and fell luckily on the fatal
word. He tore up the paper and commenced
again.
Making a good start, his hands grew cool, his
head calm; and with the old portraits beaming
upon him, away he wrote. He completed the
six propositions of the first book; then, pausing
for breath, saw that almost everybody else had
his watch on the table. Frank pulled out his.
A quarter to twelve! He had blundered, he knew.
He ought to have timed himself, and left more
time for the second book. However, his success
had put him at his ease, for he knew all the pro-
positions well so far; and he buckled-to vigorously.

By hard writing he managed to do three proposi-
tions. The last was the thirteenth. He knew
he could not do it in five minutes, and he must
allow himself time to read over his work. He
had barely done even this when the papers were
collected, and they were dismissed, with instruc-
tions to appear again at two.
Frank went out with his friend, discussing the
Euclid paper.
They lunched together at the "Clarendon,"
wisely confining themselves to a little cold meat
and sherry, and at two o'clock were again hard
at work at Latin prose. It was a piece from
"Pilgrim's Progress "—something about Giant
Despair, hi3 wife, and her bed. And judging
from the various unhappy faces, an observer might
have thought that the choice of the giant was
somewhat prophetical. Frank, however, had
done, not the identical piece, but several pieces in
the same style before, and accordingly did not
find so much difficulty.
Out at four o'clock, they strolled down Oriel
Street, past Corpus, by Merton Church, and into
Christ-Church Broad "Walk; and meeting three
friends, also up for matriculation at some other

college, took a boat from Salter's and rowed to
IfHey, Frank steering.
Luckily the river was not crowded, as in full
term, or the erratic course which Frank steered
would have brought down upon him the shrill
abuse of some eight-oar's coxswain, even if not
a quiet spill into the water.
Thursday passed much in the same way: Frank,
on the whole, satisfied with his work; Monkton,
his friend, somewhat desponding. The hours
after work would have been dull had there not
been so much to see. The friends mooned about
till half-past six, and then had meat-tea at Monk-
ton's lodgings in Ship Street; and with " Verdant
Green" and the " Mysteries of the Isis " beguiled
the evening till they turned into bed. What a
relief it was when Friday morning came, and with
it the last paper! At two that afternoon they
were met in the Lodge by the Porter, who had an
important-looking paper in his hands.
"Please to wait a moment, gentlemen," he said,
as all the candidates were hurrying off across the
quadrangle to the hall; "these are the gentlemen
that are to go for viva voce." And he proceeded
to read out six names, among which Frank and

Monkton, to their great delight, heard theii own.
They hardly thought of the disconsolate nine who,
hearing the last name on the list, hopelessly
oozed one by one out at the Lodge-gates.
Reaching the hall, the chosen six found the
Master and six of the Fellows, all attired in cap,
gown, and dignity, seated at the High table.
They were told to sit down at one side of the hall,
and then, one by one, were summoned to that
awful table and examined. Monkton's ordeal
came first, and it was a trying one. He was first
questioned (very sharply, as it seemed to Frank)
on some of his papers, and then given some written
questions and sent to a side table. Frank was
not aware, then, that this process—familiarly
known as "second paper "—meant that Monk-
ton's success hung by a thread on the result of
his work this afternoon. His own turn came
next. The Fellow who examined him saw he was
nervous, and, as usual with almost every examiner,
spoke pleasantly and reassuringly to him.
"Take your Greek Testament, Mr. Ross/' he
said, "and turn to the fifth chapter of St. Matthew,
and translate the first six verses."
Frank turned to the passage indicated. He

knew it at a glance, and that reassured him ; and
when he was next told to open a "Cicero " that
was lying on the table he felt comparatively at
his ease. He got through about six lines of the
Second Philippic, and was then asked a few dis-
connected questions.
"Do you know what circumstances led to the
delivery of this speech?"
He did know, but words failed him, and he
bungled.
"Never mind," answered the examiner. "Who
was Hannibal? and what battles did he fight?"
Frank answered, naming them.
''What is the construction after verbs of com-
manding in Latin V
"Can you mention any of our Lord's parables
which teach the duty of watchfulness ?" and so
forth.
Then came the pleasant dismissal,—
"That will do, thank you. You need not
wait."
Frank departed, and, making friends with the
Porter, told him all that had passed.
"Ah! you're all right, sir," said George; and
George's statement proved true.


## p. 15 (#23) ##############################################

Gone to Oxford.
In about three-quarters of an hour the Master
and Fellows came out of the hall and dispersed
to their respective rooms, and presently George
appeared with a piece of blue paper, which he
nailed on the gate. Five names—Frank's second,
and Monkton's absent.
"Those gentlemen that mean to reside this
term," said George, "are to call on the Dean
between five and six this evening, and bring their
fees. Those that don't are to leave Oxford at
once, and notice will be sent to them in the Long
Vacation before next term begins."
Frank meant to reside, and was one of the
first to call on the Dean. That gentleman received
him courteously; told him he had done very
fairly in the examination; hoped he would read
hard and be steady; asked him his name, age,
father's name, residence, and profession, and
various other particulars, all of which he entered
in a book; received his caution-money (SOI.), and
told him to ask the Porter the staircase and
number of the rooms allotted to him.
"Be here," he added, as Frank was leaving,
"at a quarter to ten to-morrow morning, that I
may take you before the Vice-Chancellor."


## p. 16 (#24) ##############################################

16 Oxford Days.
At the Porter's advice, Frank took a cab and
drove to the "Clarendon," paid his bill, got his
luggage together, and drove back to college.
By this time the Porter had the list of the newly-
allotted rooms.
"Tours are No. 5, sir, three-pair right."
Frank stared.
"No. 5 over the doorway, sir," he then ex-
plained, pointing across the quadrangle to a door-
way, over which Frank discerned the wished-for
number; "three flights o' stairs; the rooms on
the right hand. No. 5, three-pair right—that's
how we call it. You'll find your scout there.
You're too late for dinner. The hall-bell went
twenty minutes ago."
Frank crossed the quadrangle, climbed the
stairs, and found his rooms. They were neither
large, nor particularly clean, as regarded paper
and paint; and the carpets and coverings were
decidedly dingy. But they were Ms rooms, and
he was an Oxford man! and that was his scout
bustling in from the rooms opposite to welcome
him. After a little conversation, the fact of his
ownership became still more apparent, for the
scout proceeded to show him a collection of glass

17
and china and household implements, on the
merits and absolute necessity of which he enlarged.
The mere transfer of glass and china supplies a
nice little addition to the scout's perquisites.
The articles are, in the first instance, purchased
by some undergraduate who prefers his own
choice to what his scout has ready to offer him.
He, on leaving his rooms, bequeaths them to
his scout. Custom is so tyrannical in Oxford.
The scout sells the articles to the next tenant,
who, in his turn, bequeaths them to the same
willing legatee, when again they are sold to
the new-comer. How long this goes on it is
hard to say. Sometimes the smooth course
is interrupted by some strong-minded under-
graduate, who, ignoring custom, takes his effects
with him when he leaves. The little bill was as
follows:—-

Shortly afterwards, as Frank was unpacking, a
youth of most obsequious manners arrived, carry-
ing a cap and gown for the Freshman, who re-
ceived them with a murmur of gratified pleasure,
making no inquiries about the cost or who had
given the order; considering that, of course, what
was thus sent must be en regie. The bill arrived
within a week, with a polite intimation that pay-
ment was not requested, and an invitation to
inspect the stock of the obliging tailors.

Three years later, when pressed by duns and
threatened with proceedings in the Vice-Chan-
cellor's Court, Frank remembered these gentle
disclaimers of any wish for payment.
What with talking to his scout and unpacking,
nine o'clock soon arrived: the hour when the
kitchen and buttery were opened for supper.
William suggested that his master would like some
supper, and in a short time supper was brought.
"I shan't eat all that," expostulated Frank,
when he saw the plateful of meat and lumps of
bread and butter.
"Only one 'commons/ sir," replied William.
Frank said nothing, but saw distinctly that the
standard called "one commons," for which his
father would have to pay daily through his three
or four years, was based on the principle that
"what is ordered for one should be enough for
two." However, he enjoyed his supper; and so
did the scout, who carried home his share, with
similar portions from the other six rooms on the
staircase to which it was his duty to attend.
The following morning, duly attired in cap and
gown, with white tie and black coat at William's
suggestion, Frank betook himself to the Dean's
c 2

rooms. There he met the four other Freshmen
who ,had" passed" with him, was asked if he had
his fee ready, and then conducted in a sheepish,
silent procession, headed by the Dean, to the
Vice-Chancellor. There were several groups of
Freshmen standing with their respective Deans,
Vice-Principals, or other college officials. Then
they were all told to write their names in a book
in Latin—a novel though not difficult feat, which
Frank, with the assistance of his Dean, accom-
plished.
"Boss, Franciscus, filius Armigeri, e collegio
S. Pauli." .
He then handed in his fee, 21.10s., and received
in return a little piece of blue paper, the certificate
of matriculation, together with a copy of the
University statutes. The Vice-Chancellor ad-
dressed them all in a short Latin formula; and
when this was over, Frank had time to read the
document, which ran thus :—
"Term. Pasch.
"Oxonise, die Ap. 27mo, Anno Domini 187—.
"Quo die comparuit coram me Franciscus Eoss, e Coll.

He was now fully matriculated, and amenable
to all the details of University discipline. At
six o'clock he dined in Hall—his first dinner—
not without the usual blunder of seating himself
at a table appropriated to undergraduates at least
two years his seniors; and at eight went to chapel
—the hour being changed on first nights in term
fron half-past five to eight, to enable men from
distant homes to put in an appearance. The
chapel was very much crowded, Paul's having
considerably outgrown its accommodation ; but it
was only on first nights that the inconvenience
was felt, for as it was not necessary to attend
service more than four times in the week, all the
men were never there together.
Coming out, he met several old school-fellows,
and the senior of them carried them all off to
his lodgings in Holywell Street, where over wine
and pipes they sat chatting till past ten o'clock;
Frank, for the most part, listening without saying
much, for he was but a Freshman, and this his
first pipe.
When he got back to Paul's he found the gates
locked; but as he had read "Verdant Green"
very carefully, he did not think it necessary to

apologize to George for giving him the trouble of
opening. He knew that "knocking in" before
eleven o'clock only meant twopence in his weekly
"battels." 1
That night, when he got into bed, though he
did not feel quite a "man/' he felt conscious of
having undergone some considerable change since
he left home on Tuesday morning.

CHAPTEB II.
AN OXFORD SUNDAY.
On Sunday morning he woke to the words that,
without the slightest variation in time or tone of
delivery, called him daily for the three years that
he resided in college—" Half-past seven, sir!
Do you breakfast in?"
This was the scout's gentle hint that chapel
service was within half an hour, and his form of
inquiry whether his young master intended break-
fasting in his own rooms or was going elsewhere
for the meal.
Frank, when he fully realized the meaning,
answered "Yes," and with a freshman's energy
jumped out of bed, and was dressed before the
chapel bell began to ring. Hurrying downstairs,
in fear of being late, he was stopped by William,
with the suggestion that there was "no call to
go yet, till the bell began to swear!"


## p. 24 (#32) ##############################################

Oxford Days.
This elegant expression, Frank learnt, is
applied to the quickened and louder ringing of
the bell for the five minutes immediately pre-
ceding service. He found, not many days after,
that it was quite possible, by the aid of an
Ulster, and postponement of ablutions, to get
to chapel in time if he slept till the "swearing"
began.
There were not so many men present as on the
previous evening. The Master and Fellows wore
surplices and hoods; the Scholars, being under-
graduates, surplices and no hoods; the com-
moners, black gowns. The few—apparently
senior men—who wore black gowns of longer and
ampler make than the commoners, were the
Bachelors and Masters of Arts, still "in resi-
dence," but not on the foundation—i. e., neither
Fellows nor Scholars, and therefore not entitled
to wear surplices. This was the strict order for
Sundays, and other high days; on other days
every one wore the black gown of his respective
degree, with the single exception of the Fellow
who did chaplain's duty for the week; for at
Paul's there was no permanent chaplain. The
first lesson was read by one of the Scholars, the

second by one of the Fellows, the prayers by the
chaplain, the Communion Service by the Master.
There was no sermon; the intention being that
each undergraduate should attend "prayers" in
his own particular college-chapel, and afterwards
hear a sermon preached in the University-church
to the members of the University in common.
The list of those who attend chapel is kept at
Paul's by the Bible-clerk, at some colleges by the
chapel-porter. The Bible-clerk's further duties
are to find the lessons, to read them in the possible
absence of the proper person, and to say grace in
Hall.
A man may lose caste by becoming a Bible-
clerk, but it is by no means necessary that he
should. A cad (and there are many at Oxford)
distinctly degrades the post, and makes it
shunned. A man wavering between good sets
and bad sets may possibly lose what little footing
he has in the former. But a thorough gentleman
(it seems hardly necessary to say so, except to
disabuse many of their prejudices) need not, and
does not in the slighest degree, lower himself by
holding such a position. The emoluments
amount (in money and allowances) often to 801.

per annum; at Paul's, 75Z.; but what makes the
post so especially valuable, from a pecuniary
point of view, is that it can be held with a
Scholarship and an Exhibition. The Bible-clerk
at Paul's during Frank's first two years was
holding a Scholarship of the value of QOL, an
Exhibition from his school of the value of 50?.;
so that, with his clerkship of 75?., his income
amounted to 185Z., for the academical year of six
months. And he was one of the most popular men
in the college.
Prom him Frank learnt that he would have to
read the first lesson in chapel for six consecutive
days in his turn; but that, being a freshman,
his turn would not come for some time yet.
On returning to his rooms he found his break-
fast laid, the kettle simmering, and letters lying
on the table; one from home; the rest, the
circulars that flatter the freshman's dignity, and
coax him into becoming a customer.
The foundation breakfast consists of bread,
butter, and milk, and in some colleges two eggs.
These articles are brought by the scouts from the
buttery, and entered by the buttery-clerk to the
respective undergraduates. The bread, butter,

An Oxford Sunday. 27
and milk are distributed in "commons/' the rate
charged being above that of tradesmen outside
college, and the quantity being, in the case of
most men, certainly too much for one meal. The
remains belong to the scout.
Fish, poultry, meat (and for luncheon, pastry),
are supplied from the kitchen. For some items
the charges are reasonable, for others exorbitant.
Naturally, therefore, it is in "kitchen-orders"
that the careful student can economize, if only he
can stand against the Oxford custom, fostered by
the scouts, of ordering too much. For at least
three days in the week the two customary eggs,
with bread and butter, are surely enough for
breakfast, a kitchen-order being thereby avoided.
The too common habit, however, is to discard the
eggs (paid for, it must be remembered, whether
eaten or not), and eat meat. It is quite conceiv-
able that, after one breakfast on one staircase
where eight men live, the scout may put into his
basket sixteen eggs.
Tea, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, sugar, and so on,
are in some colleges procurable from the Common-
room-stores, an establishment resembling an
Italian warehouse and wine-and-spirit-vault com-

bined. Custom, if not college regulations, will
compel the undergraduate to deal with the
Common-room-man.
At Paul's there is no such establishment, but
William very kindly supplied the deficiency by
ordering in, from one of the nearest—and dearest
—grocers, a good stock of tea (at 4s. 6cZ. per
pound, of course), coffee, candles, matches,
scented soap, biscuits, jam, marmalade, till Frank
was quite bewildered at the thought of the room
necessary for storing these delicacies. However,
they did not last long.
One of the most iniquitous and yet plausible
practices is that pursued at some colleges—Paul's
among the number—of compelling undergraduates
to deal at certain shops.
Anything in the way of paper, paint, or furni-
ture, has to be procured at one of the shops
attached to the college. These are invariably the
dearest, charging for their goods 25 and 30 per
cent, more than the many other establishments
which struggle against these monopolies.
The reason given by the college authorities for
this system is that they are obliged to exercise
some principle of selection of the workmen

allowed within the college walls, indiscriminate
admission being open to risk. The reason is
plausible enough, but it is based entirely on the
supposition that the workmen employed by ex-
pensive firms alone are honest. Further, what
risk could there be in the conveyance of a piece
of furniture to the college gates, when its removal
to the rooms of the purchaser would be the work
of the college servants?
The only method of avoiding the tyranny of the
system is to employ one of the railway carriers.
The college porter, on the presumption that the
article has come by rail from the undergraduate's
home, is obliged to admit it.
Anything like opposition to the regulation
appears at present to be useless. One daring
undergraduate at Paul's, who ventured to re-
monstrate with his college dean (the authority
in such matters), was met with this characteristic
answer:—" It is our system. If you don't like
it, the college gates are open. You can remove
your name from the college books. We won't
detain you." — an answer perfectly admissible
from the proprietor of any establishment, but
insolent and unwarrantable from one who, after

all, is but an administrator in a corporate institu-
tion.
And so it would be possible to go on and
enumerate many instances in which not only
custom among his companions, but college regula-
tions compel the undergraduate to be extrava-
gant and wasteful. Homes are crippled, younger
brothers and sisters deprived of the education
which is their due, and the much-vaunted
University extension limited by the very adminis-
tration of the bodies that ought, and do profess,
to foster it. Questions of domestic economy are
ignored by the various commissions, though they
lie at the very root of University extension. Let
additional Scholarships be founded to enable more
students to come to the University; let additional
teaching power be endowed with professorships,
lectureships, and readerships, by all means; but
let perquisites be pruned down; let the enormous
profits of catering cooks and butlers be decreased;
let room-rent be lowered; let "servants' dues"
pay the servants, and not need to be supplemented
by charges which never appear in the college
accounts; let trade be free in the town; let every
man buy where he pleases; that is the way to

extend the benefits of University education—that
is the way to enable those to profit by it who are
at present debarred—that is the way to enable
families, which now struggle to send one son to
the University, to send two for an equivalent out-
lay. There can be no doubt of the unnecessary
waste and extravagance in the domestic eco-
nomy of the colleges when it is remembered
that though collegiate life, based as it is on com-
munistic principles, ought to be cheaper than any
other form of student life, as a matter of fact it
is considerably more expensive.
To return to Frank's breakfast. He found
some difficulty in boiling his eggs and making
his tea. But he concealed his ignorance and ate
the eggs, and drank his tea like dish-water.
About a quarter to ten some one banged at his
door, and entered with the bang. The visitor
was Crawford, of Brasenose, an old school-fellow
of Frank's, who had gone up about three years
previously.
"Hullo, young man! not finished breakfast
yet!»
His cheery greeting was delightful to Frank,
who felt he had in him a true friend.


## p. 32 (#40) ##############################################

32
Oxford Days.
A man about three years senior to a freshman
—what a power, for good or evil, he has! His
seniority inspires reverence and commands imita-
tion. Luckily, Crawford was a thoroughly ster-
ling fellow. He had come to Oxford in earnest.
When he worked he worked; when he played he
played. There was the same vigour in his work
as in his "stroke" on the river or "rush" at
football. He kept chapels regularly; he said,
because morning-chapel gave him a long day.
There was a more earnest reason concealed behind
this; but he had a horror of the dangers of cant.
He knew what lectures were worth attending, and
attended them. He ridiculed and cut the worth-
less. He knew who were the best " coaches," and
said so. He abused the charlatans. In all matters
of social etiquette he was an old-fashioned Conser-
vative; for example, ho always wore a black coat
and tall hat on Sundays, and roundly abused those
who loafed in light suits; and he never carried an
umbrella or wore gloves when attired in cap and
gown—a rather silly custom, perhaps ; but its ob-
servance in the face of innovations marks the man.
After a little chat on school matters, Crawford
told Frank he was going to the University

sermon ; and without any compunction told him—
not asked him—to accompany him.
Frank, nothing loth, took his cap and gown,
and they went together.
St. Mary's does double duty: as a parish
church and as the University church; and here
the University sermons are preached at 10.30 a.m.
and 2 p.m. on each Sunday in full term, except
those of the Dean of Christ-Church, or the
Fellows of New College, Magdalen, and Merton,
which are or may be preached in the cathedral
and in the chapels of those colleges respectively.
The nave—the part appropriated to the Univer-
sity—was crowded when Frank and his companion
entered, for the preacher was a popular one. In
the gallery, facing that by the west window
assigned to undergraduates, the University
organist, Mr. Taylor, was already seated at the
organ, with six or eight chorister boys round him.
One of these hung a board, with the number of
the selected hymn, over the gallery, and then the
voluntary commenced.
At 10.30 precisely the procession entered at
the north door: the vice-chancellor, preceded by
his mace-bearers, the esquire bedels and marshals,

and followed by the heads of houses, the preacher,
and the proctors. Then the whole congregation
rose and, led by the choristers, sang the hymn
appointed. Afterwards came the quaint " bidding
prayer," still used in most cathedrals, but made
especially quaint in a University city by the long
lists of founders and benefactors; and then the
sermon. At a quarter to twelve all was over, and
Frank was sitting in the window of Crawford's
rooms in Brasenose; and as he looked out on the
sunny Eadcliffe Square, with St. Mary's graceful
spire, the black frowning "schools/' and the
pepper-box towers of All Souls, he heard with
reverent admiration (for he was, in his way, some-
what of a poet) that these were Bishop Heber's
rooms, that here he must have sat, and here he
must have written that famous Newdigate prize-
poem, "Palestine," by which he will always be
remembered.
Over the chimney looking-glass hung a gilded
face, with an enormous nose, the emblem of the
college. The pictures on the panelled walls
Frank soon became more intimately acquainted
with, for he found copies in most of his friends'
rooms. There were "The Huguenots," "The

Black Brunswicker," Landseer's "Challenge,"
"Betreat," and " Monarch of the Glen," of course,
and many others of a more recent date. Three or
four pairs of boxing-gloves lay in one corner,
dumb-bells in another. Against the wall,- in
racks, pipes of various descriptions, from the
short briar-root to the china bowl of the German
student (for Crawford had spent six months once
upon a time in Heidelberg), racket-bats, and an
oar, fondly cherished, that had helped to bring
victory to the Brasenose " four " a few years back
at Henley.
At one o'clock Crawford's scout appeared, and
almost at the same moment three invited friends,
strangers to Frank. At Oxford luncheon or
breakfast parties, etiquette does not require that
the guests should arrive late. The lunch was as
follows :—
Leg of lamb.
Couple of chicken.
Ham cut in huge slices.
Salad.
Lumps of bread.
Lumps of butter.
Lumps of cheese.
Celery.
Three pots of jam.
"French pastry" (in
reality, English
tarts).
Cyder cup.
Sherry and claret.

Fish, meat, and marmalade at nine that morning,
and a prospective dinner in Hall at six that even-
ing, did not prevent Frank's four companions
from doing ample justice to the fare. He himself
was as yet unused to these meals, by which
circumstance Crawford's scout profited.
After lunch, pipes. At three the guests
dropped off; and the two school-fellows walked
to Cumnor—as a result of which Frank wasted
three hours on Monday evening, writing a poem
about Amy Robsart's tomb.
At five they got back to Oxford, and the fresh-
man was introduced to the reading and writing
rooms of the Union Society, Crawford entering
his name as a probationary member, and telling
him to call on Monday to pay the fee—25s. There
was hardly time to do more than glance at the
telegrams in the hall, and just look in at the
numerous readers and writers in the different -
rooms; but the view was quite enough to enchant
Frank. . And then the friends parted for their
respective chapels.
At dinner that evening he made friends with
some freshmen, with one of whom he proposed
to go to St. Philip's and St. James* Church,


## p. 37 (#45) ##############################################

for evening service. Dinner being prolonged
rather beyond the usual time, they had to run
pretty sharp, and even then were too late to get
a seat. They accordingly began to retrace their
steps, determining on future occasions, when
they meant to go to either of the parish churches,
to make their* dinner at lunch-time, and " take
their names off Hall"—i.e. remove their names
from the list of those for whom dinner in Hall was
provided—and have supper in their rooms on their
return from service.
'As they were walking on, they were suddenly
stopped by a man having the appearance of a
policeman in plain clothes, who said,—
"The Proctorwants to speak to you, gentlemen."
The next moment they saw a gentleman in
black gown and large velvet sleeves, who with
formal politeness raised his cap and said,—
"Are you members of this University?"
Frank and his friend murmured that they were.
"Your names and colleges, if you please."
« Ross of Paul's."
"Mordaunt, of Paul's."
"Call on me to-morrow morning at nine, if you
please."


## p. 38 (#46) ##############################################

38
Oxford Days.
And the Proctor walked on, leaving Frank and
Mordaunt rather bewildered, and totally ignorant
where they were to call in the morning—for
though they knew they had been "proctorized,"
they did not know either the Proctor's name
or his college.
The marshal (the Proctor's head attendant; the
rest being called "bull-dogs"), seeing them
standing in the road in evident uncertainty, said
to them,—
"You'd best go back to college, gentlemen;"
and then, instinctively gathering that they were
freshmen, added,—
"Where's your caps and gowns? You'll find
the Proctor at Christ-Church, gentlemen," and
vanished with his bull-dogs after other unwary
undergraduates.
The interview somewhat damped their spirits:
not that any fearful punishment was hanging over
their heads. Even the statutable fine of five
shillings for being without cap and gown would,
they believed, be remitted in consideration of their
being freshmen. But Frank had hoped to keep
out of the way of the Proctors; and this was in-
deed an early beginning.

CHAPTER III.
THE FRESHMAN'S TEEM.
Strolling towards the Lodge on Monday morn-
ing—because everybody seemed ^to be strolling
in that direction—Frank had his attention called
to various notices posted in the gates. One was
to the effect that " the Master would see the gen-
tlemen that morning between 10 a.m. and noon,
the freshmen on Tuesday, between the same
hours." Another that "the Dean would be glad
to see the freshmen at ten, the other gentlemen
after." There was also a list of places in Hall;
announcements of the meetings of the College
Debating Society, Boat Club, Cricket Club;
Greek Testament Lecture, sine ulla solemnitate
(i.e. without cap and gown), at Mr. Wood's house
every Sunday evening at nine. He was one of the
married Fellows—a hard-working, energetic man.
Without quite knowing what "seeing the

freshmen" meant, Frank got his gown, and as it
was five minutes to ten, made his way to the Dean's
rooms. In the passage outside he found about
twenty freshmen cooling their heels, and engaged,
some more and some less, in questions or chaff
with George, the Dean's scout. George usually
had the best of it. In fact, the freshman who
dared to argue with him on matters of custom or
local politics, and especially local politics, found
himself considerably " shut up."
A door opened, and a sort of snort from within in-
dicated to George that the Dean was ready to see
the freshmen. One by one they filed in, and were
greeted by the Dean with a smile that was natu-
rallyfaint but tried to be sweet, and a grasp of the
hand that was meant to be cordial but was un-
mistakably flabby. There were seats for all, but
it took some minutes to get into them. The in-
terview did not last long: just long enough, in
fact, to enable the Dean to make one remark to
each of the freshmen. To one, without waiting
for an answer, " How is your father?" To an-
other, " Does Mr. St. Leger intend coming for-
ward for Slowcombe?" To another, " Have you
been in Devonshire this vacation, Mr Jones ?"—

Jones being, of course, a Yorkshireman who has
never travelled further south than Oxford, when
he matriculated in February last. To one or two
a faint question as to their intentions. "Were
they going to read for Honours, or for a Pass?"
On the whole, Frank left the room depressed and
disheartened as to his work. He had expected
to be questioned as to what he had done at school:
what form he was in: what books he had read;
to be advised as to the turn his reading should
now take; whether he should read for Honours
in one examination or in more than one; or
whether, in short, reading for Honours would be
beyond him, and therefore waste of time. The
only piece of practical information he gained was
that Mr. Wood was his tutor, and to him he must
apply for all particulars as to Lectures and Exa-
minations.
The plan at Paul's is similar to that at most
colleges. The undergraduates are distributed
among the tutors, a certain number being appor-
tioned to each. They are not necessarily to attend
their lectures, but they are to go to them for ad-
vice and private assistance in their work. In many
colleges, battels are paid by the undergraduate

to his own tutor. The tutors together draw up
a scheme of lectures, which the undergraduates
attend simply according to the necessities of the
examination for which they are reading, and not
according to the particular tutor to whom they
are assigned. Frank was assigned to Mr. Wood,
but did not attend his Lectures in his first term,
as they were for more advanced men. He learnt
all this when he went to him at the Dean's direc-
tion. What he failed to find in the Dean he found
in Mr. Wood, who met him cordially, took him
into his inner room, made him sit comfortably
on a sofa in the large bay window, and then
chatted with him for half an hour. The result
of the conversation was that Frank was to
work for Responsions,1 which would come
1 Responsions are obligatory on all except those who have
passed either the Previous Examination at Cambridge, or

are five separate subjects of examination, in each of which
a candidate must satisfy the Examiners (who, in this case, are

sation is not recognized; failure in any one subject rendering

think about Moderations 1 till he was safe through
this first ordeal; and to come on Sunday
evenings to Mr. Wood's Greek Testament Lec-
tures. The hours and subjects of the other
lectures, he told Frank, he would find posted
on the Lodge-gate on the following day. He
asked him a few questions about his father
and the Vicar of Porchester, who was an old
friend; about his school and college friends;
asked him whether he boated or played cricket;
whether he meant to join the Union; told him if
he wanted any books out of the college library
to come to him; concluding hurriedly, as another
freshman, seeking advice, knocked timorously and
entered.
The visit next morning to the Master was not
unlike that to the Dean—a purely formal one.
The Master's questions chiefly related to cricket
and boating, indicating an anxiety to discover the
first three Philippics; or (2) De Senectute and De Arnicitia;
or (3) four Catiline orations, with the oration Pro Archia.
The books most commonly chosen are Euripides,—Hecuba,
and Alcestis; and one of the combinations in Virgil or
Horace.

Frank, as he sat in the Master's arm-chair, while
the old gentleman warmed his coat-tails by an
imaginary fire, could not help falling to making
doggrel -

“M’must the Master and Merriment mean.”
But there he stopped by lack of rhymes and a
general stampede of the Freshmen, to the great
relief of the much-enduring Master.
Frank selected for Responsions the books he
had offered for Matriculation, the usual and
natural course; and with the assistance of Craw-

The lectures in his books were much the same
as at school, except that the undergraduates
were treated with more respect than school-boys.
A certain quantity was set: the men were put
on in turn to translate; and general questions
asked. Sometimes, if time permitted, the lecturer
would translate the lesson himself when the men
had finished.
The grammar and prose in Hall were in the
form of examination. The men were called up
one by one to be shown the mistakes in the
papers done on previous days, so that, with this
interruption, not much more than forty minutes
were left for actual writing. The prose on
Thursday morning was the only tutorial link
that bound Mr. Wood to his pupil, and that was,
as often as not, severed by a note to the effect
that Mr. Wood would be "unable to see Mr.
Ross on Thursday morning."
To Frank the work seemed as nothing after the
long hours of school. It never occurred to him
to look ahead, and to think of Moderations; in
fact, he had been told not to do so. And so he
commenced, energetically it is true, going over
work he already knew well enough to satisfy the

examiners, listening to the marvellous mistakes
of his fellow-freshmen and of those senior men
who had been degraded because of failure in
previous terms. He soon learnt to think nothing
of hearing mistakes that would disgrace school-
boys of fifteen; and to fancy that, because he
regularly prepared his work and attended his
lectures, he was working to the utmost extent
that he could, or that was required of him. And
that is how so many first terms are wasted, and
boys with energy enough for eight or ten hours'
daily study drift into two or three, and often
into none at all. Failure sometimes rouses them;
but it is a questionable remedy, and more often
demoralizes than benefits.
There is not much work done in the summer
term; an outsider might say, none at all. But
then he would be judging from the external
appearance of the place: the quads crowded with
lounging men, waiting for drags to go to the
cricket-ground; the wide-open windows with
their gay flowers, whence issue sounds and scents
of the heavy luncheons of the more languidly
inclined; the river swarming with boats of all
sorts and sizes; the Union rooms full of readers

leisurely scanning the papers or dipping into
the magazines, with ices or cigars to soothe or
sweeten the summer afternoons; the roads busy
with rattling pony-carriages bound for Wood-
stock or Abingdon, "Witney or Thame; even the
shops themselves are full, whose windows from
without and wares within tempt the passing

There are plenty of them if you know where

is a stranger that he won't find them. . What
can he know of the hours of heavy work got
through in the quiet of those bright summer
afternoons; of the one close-shut room on this
deserted staircase of open, idle doors; of that
back-quad attic, with its sported oak; of the
"coach's" crowded chambers, where, unheeding
the charms of river or cricket-field, of Union-

Besides, the surprised and maybe shocked
stranger must remember that a large number of
men who come to Oxford do not come there

one if they can; the sooner they can, so much
the better are they pleased. They come to be
made men and gentlemen. A degree is only
one of the many means to that end. It is only
because some make it their all-absorbing motive
that the University sends forth into the world
so many prigs.
Within the first week Frank had made many
friends, most of them friends of Crawford's, who
had called at his suggestion. The secretaries of
the Boat and Cricket Clubs had looked him up,
to whom Frank, with much pleasure, had paid
his entrance fee and annual subscriptions.
The captain of the Paul's company in the Eifle
Corps had come to work upon his military ardour;
the president of the College Debating Society,
to arouse his ambition for oratory; the collector
for the various Church Societies, to test his
impartiality and charity. Frank was enabled, by
his father's wish and the means he had placed
at his disposal, to join the various societies, and
pay the subscriptions. But it was not this
pecuniary willingness alone that gained for our
freshman so much popularity. The pecuniary
outlay was as follows :—

There is no need to enter into Frank's chari-
table subscriptions. They were neither large
nor small, but what they were, were given with
pleasure. About this time also came in the
valuation of his rooms, amounting to 30Z. Our
freshman is now, therefore, fairly started on his
career.

CHAPTER IV.
THE EIGHTS.
April slipped away, and it was the evening of
the 30th. Frank had dined in Hall; he had been
to all his lectures that morning. He knew the
work for the next day. There was no need, there-
fore, he thought, for further work. Turning out
of the Lodge-gates, hardly knowing where he
was going, he strolled into the High; and just by
Spiers' he met a new acquaintance—Morton, of
Magdalen.
"Where are you off, Eoss?" he asked.
"Don't know," answered Frank; "nowhere
particular."
The fact is, Frank had been drifting of late into
these evening rambles to "nowhere particular."
And a good deal of time they occupied too.
"You'd better come down to my rooms. I've
got one or two fellows coming in for a hand at
whist."

Frank, not being the impossible model young
man of the story-books, did not resist the invita-
tion, but, linking his arm into Morton's, went off to
Magdalen. The April night was not so warm that
a fire was not pleasant. Morton's rooms were in
the old quad, looking out towards the new
buildings and the deer-park. The curtains were
drawn and the lights burning. Several little
tables were laid with dessert, and one cleared
in the centre of the room, with packs of
cards upon it. There were about a dozen men
present.
Dessert over, cards began; but it was not
whist. Everybody voted that slow. Frank him-
self thought that he never had played so enticing
a game as loo. When he knocked in that night
at five minutes to twelve, he fancied the porter
eyed him suspiciously and knew that he had re-
turned minus a few pounds and plus a racking
headache. His suspicions were right. Few read
more rightly or more quickly the character and
career of the undergraduates than the porters
who open to them nightly.
But, in spite of his headache, Frank managed
to be up at four o'clock next morning. He had

accepted Morton's invitation to breakfast at six,
after hearing the choir sing the May-Morning
Hymn on the college tower. George, the porter,
as he opened the Lodge-gates to Frank and
others, thought, in spite of his pale face, that he
at least could not have been up to much mischief
last night, or he would not have been up so early
after it. And George, usually infallible, began to
retract his last night's opinion.
As he stood on the leads and looked down
through the grey battlements on the faint fresh
green that was brightening the trees in the Bo-
tanical Gardens; on the distant spires and towers;
and on the less fortunate crowds in the street below;
andasthe sweet voices of the choir rose andblended
through the soft morning air, a feeling, whether
it was regret or remorse he hardly knew, came
over him. Anyhow he felt that this was a
sweeter, purer pleasure than the gambling of last
night, and confessed to himself that he had been
"an utter fool for his pains."
It was a blazing afternoon about the end of
May. The river—meaning thereby the Isis, the
main river, to distinguish it from its tributary the
Cherwell — was deserted save for a few energetic

men in outiugged skiffs practising for sculling
races, and the boatmen, in charge of the various
college barges, sweltering in the sun, and, as fast
as the heat would allow them, making prepara-
tions for the work of the evening. The Cherwell,
with its slow, shady stream, its winding banks and
drooping trees, was the favourite resort, but even
here all was quiet. Every now and then a canoe
flashed by lazily, or a punt plunged up in search
of some cool nook. There was a momentary dis-
turbance, perhaps, as it bumped against one
already moored; and pairs of sleepy eyes would
look up to scowl at the new-comer, if a stranger;
or greet him lazily if a friend.
Just in one of the pleasantest corners, Frank
and Monkton had fixed their craft, and were lying
face upwards on a couple of enormous cushions
—Monkton smoking or pretending to smoke;
Frank reading or pretending to read.
"Are you going to stay for the Eights V asked
Monkton.
"Bather," answered Frank. "Why? aren't
yon?"
"No, not I! In the first place, I don't care
about them; and in the second place, I've pro-

mised Morton to drive to Abingdon at seven.
It'll be getting cool then."
"It seems to me you're rather fond of going
to Abingdon/' answered Frank. "What's the
attraction?"
"My dear boy, ask no questions and I'll tell
you no lies"—and at that moment a punt ran
right into them.
"Now then, sir, look ahead!" spluttered Monk-
ton as their punt was nearly upset, and his cigar
falling from his mouth burnt a small hole in his
flannel trousers. The intruder apologized and
plunged on again to disturb the rest of other un-
lucky beings.
"Well," went on Frank, " I'm glad I've not to
pay your bill for pony-traps, that's all."
"Oh, well, as far as that goes," retorted Monk-
ton, waking up a little, "that don't trouble me.
I patronize the trustful Traces, and I'm sure the
trustful one would be quite embarrassed if I
offered to pay him; so I don't. That's all."
"Does your governor give you an allowance?"
asked Frank.
"Not he. He told me not to get into debt, and
to send in the bills. And a fellow can't live like

a hermit. I've always had a horse at home, so 1
don't see why I shouldn't have one here. But
I'm not proud, and so I hire a pony instead, and
I'm sure the old man ought not to mind."
"Come out of that, you lazy young beggar!"
called a voice in Frank's ears, and looking up he
saw Crawford in one of those little cockle-shells
in which Mr. Verdant Green so highly distin-
guished himself—" Aren't you coming down to
see the Eights?"
Monkton looked at Crawford with that expres-
sion of half insolence, half fear, which charac-
terizes so many freshmen, and drawled out,—
"Yes; Ross is going. He's so energetic, you
know."
"That's a blessing, at all events," answered
Crawford, "as long as there are fellows like you,
about."
"By Jove!" said Frank, pulling out his watch,
"it's getting late. If you're going to Abingdon
at seven, Monkton, you'll have to look sharp."
"Going to Abingdon?" asked Crawford, half
to himself, and getting no answer from Monk-
ton.
"Look here I I say, you fellows! can't you

manage to get this punt back to the barges, and
let me cut up through the meadows?" said
Monkton. "I promised to be in Morton's rooms
at half-past six, and it's just on six now."
"All right," said Frank, " Crawford will help
me back with the punt "—really glad to get rid
of him, for his younger and his older friend did
not hit it off exactly.
"It strikes me that young man is beginning
rather early," said Crawford paternally, as he
lashed his boat to the punt and got in, much to
Frank's relief, for it was his first day in a
punt.
The latter did not say much, for he had himself
commenced various extensive dealings with the
trustful tradesmen—trustful, that is, for two years,
but most distrustful afterwards—and he feared
questioning and an inevitable lecture from Craw-
ford.
By the time they reached the barges, the river
and banks were getting crowded. The band was
assembling on the 'Varsity barge (that belonging
to the University Boat Club); and all the other
college barges were in a bustle of excitement.
It was " the first night of the Eights," and many

were the attempts to explain that somewhat ellip-
tical phrase to the uninitiated matrons and
maidens who were flocking from every quarter of
the town.
Just at the mouth of the Cherwell, Crawford
and Frank met a party of ladies and escorted
them to the Paul's barge; and the latter, though
he fancied he was clear as to the meaning of
"Eights" and "Torpids," was really not sorry
to overhear his friend's explanation.
"You see," Crawford was saying to a pretty
girl with bright blue eyes, that certainly did not
seem to be reminded that they could see—" You
see, every college, that is athletic enough, has a
Boat Club; the best eight oars, rowers I mean, con-
stitute ' the Eightthe second best eight are ' the
- Torpid.' The Torpid-races, or as we call them,
'the Torpids,' take place in the Lent term; every
college that has an Eight and a Torpid enters the
latter for the Torpid-races; and then they all row
to see which is best. Then in the Summer term
'the Eights' are on; that is the races of the col-
lege Eight-oars; to-night is the first night, you
know. All the Eights are going to row to see
which is best."

"Yes; but," said Blue-eyes, "why do they
have more than one race?"
"Well, you see "—Crawford could not help the
phrase—" that is—er—it's rather difficult to ex-
plain."
But after a moment he took courage, and
plunged into his explanation, which was to this
effect, and which may assist' the uninitiated
reader.
The river is too narrow to admit of boats
racing abreast. They are therefore arranged one
behind the other, there being 120 feet from the
nose of one to the stern of the other. All start
simultaneously, the object of each being to
"bump"—i.e. run into and touch the one in
front of it. When a "bump " has taken place,
both the "bumper " and the "bumped" row to
the bank to let the others pass. There is a post
opposite the barges, where most of the spectators
sit, and when once a boat has passed this it can-
not be bumped. The following night—called
"night," but really meaning seven o'clock—the
boats all start, with this exception, that if, for
example, on Monday Balliol has bumped Christ-
Church, on Tuesday Balliol will start ahead of

Christ-Church. The latter then has the chance
of regaining its position by bumping Balliol, but
it is also exposed to the danger of being bumped
by the next boat. This goes on, in the case of
the " Torpid/' for six days; of the " Eights," for
eight "nights." At the end, the boat that
finishes with all the others behind it, holds the
proud position of " Head of the River" for the
year. ]t may , have gained this by making
bumps," or by avoiding being "bumped."
How the order was, in the origin of the races,
settled, it is impossible to say; but it is the rule
that any college club which "puts on"—i.e. en-
ters a boat for the races—for the first time shall
start at the bottom. Perhaps, after this expla-
nation, any remaining difficulty will be cleared
up by suggesting, as an illustration, a school-
class, in which a place is gained for a successful
answer. The boats, by " bumping" and being
"bumped," respectively gain and lose places.
Crawford was rowing in the Brasenose Eight.
So, after seeing his lady friends to seats on the
top of the college barge, he ran down-stairs to
dress for the race. The men who rowed in the
Brasenose Eight and Torpid were unlike the

61
majority of men of other colleges, in tbat they
walked to the river in mufti, and put on their
boating-clothes in their barge. Frank, pleading
an excuse that he wanted to go down the Berk-
shire bank to see the start, but chiefly because
he was rather shy, left Crawford's party to the
attention of some other men, and, crossing in old
George West's punt, was soon lost in the crowd.
One by one the boats paddled down to the
start, cheered by their own men as they passed.
The crowd thickened. A great surging mass
pressed up against the rails that enclosed the
barges, and gazed enviously at the lucky ones
within the enclosure. A black line went coiling
down the pathway towards IfBey. Those were
the men who would see the start, and run back
with the boats to cheer them on. Presently there
was a great silence. Everybody was looking
right away to the Iffley Willows, or at watches.
Then the first gun went. Conversation flowed
again for four minutes. Then the one-minute
gun—and then utter silence, till with the third
boom a roar of voices began, that came nearer
and louder as the great black line began coiling
home again, as fast as it could.

Brasenose was Head of the River; and Blue-
eyes was wearing the Brasenose colours; and
Blue-eyes' heart, though she would not have con-
fessed it, was in a flutter of excitement. On came
the boats. Balliol was close behind Brasenose.
The Brasenose men on bank and barge shouted.
The Balliol men shouted more loudly. They must
catch them. Blue-eyes hated the Balliol men ;
but, for all that, the nose of the Balliol boat was
within a foot of the Brasenose rudder. Now it
overlapped it, but failed to touch it, for the Brase-
nose coxswain, by a sharp pull of the rudder-
string, turned a rush of water against their nose
and washed thein off.
The Brasenose men yelled till Blue-eyes felt
the drums of her little ears were nigh to cracking.
And then Crawford, who was rowing stroke,
seemed to pull himself together for a final effort,
and laying himself well out, gave his men a longer
stroke. Now they were clear--now there was a
foot between them-now two—now three. Then
he quickened : his men answered bravely. Foot
by foot they drew ahead, and when they were on
the post, Balliol was a good length behind. Blue-
eyes had often heard, “ See, the Conquering Hero

comes," but she could not make out why the
sound of it now gave her a choking feeling in the
throat. Certainly she saw no more of the races,
though boat by boat came by, each in as keen
pursuit of the one just in advance of it as Balliol
had been to catch Brasenose.
There was a merry party that night in Craw-
ford's rooms, and Blue-eyes sat by the host, and
was highly amused at the plain fare he was obliged
to eat in the midst of the dainties of the supper-
table; and she was half inclined to be cross when
at a quarter to ten the captain of the Boat Club,
who was present, firmly but politely suggested
the breaking up of the party—" unless," he ex-
plained, "you want to see Brasenose go down to-
morrow night."
But men must work, or at any rate go in for
examinations, whatever the women may do. So
the "Eights" passed away, and Blue-eyes re-
turned to her home, taking with her, from many,
the sunshine she had brought. The Proctor's
notices recalled Frank and several hundred other
unfortunates to the stern realities of University
life. Parted for a while in the all-too-brief days
of Blue-eyes' supremacy, Monkton and Frank

drifted together again by the force of kindred
obligations. Together they went to the Junior
Proctor, and entered their names for Responsions
(commonly called "Smalls," "because such a
werry small number on 'em gets through," as the
guides will tell you); together they parted with
the statutable guinea, fondly hoping that in duo
time they would get a tangible result in the shape
of a testamur. Together they gazed admiringly,
nor yet without awe, at their names when they
appeared in the Gazette; and together, in white
ties and "garments of a subfusc hue," as pre-
scribed by the statutes, they proceeded one bright
morning in June to the Schools. There for two
days, from nine to twelve, and from half-past one
to half-past three, they were examined by papers.
Then, after waiting a few days, Monkton's viva
voce came on, the order of this being alphabetical.
But when at two o'clock the same day the Clerk
of the Schools read out a list of those who had
passed, and for the gladly-paid shilling handed
over a small piece of blue paper, testifying the
fact in the handwriting of the much-enduring
Examiners, Monkton's testamur was, alas! not
forthcoming. Frank did not pass as easily as he

might have passed. The last few weeks had taken
the polish off his work. He got his testamur, it
is true, but he was rather ashamed of feeling
relieved, for he knew that he ought never to have
had any fears of failing in such a school-boy
examination.
He called on his tutor to consult him as to his
future work. The First Public Examination
(commonly called Moderations) is, like Respon-
sions, obligatory on all; but here the student
may offer either the minimum amount of work,
called "a Pass," or go in for Honours either in
Classics or Mathematics. The Honours Examina-
tion is to chiefly test style of translation from
Latin and Greek authors into English, and vice-
versd, together with grammatical and critical
questions bearing on the contents, style, and
literary history of the books offered. Papers are
also set in the Elements of Comparative Philology;
the History of the Greek Drama, with Aristotle's
Poetics; and the Elements of Deductive Logic,
with either selections from the Organon, or from
Mill's "Inductive Logic." The four Gospels in
Greek, together with questions on the subject-
matter, are compulsory on all,—Passmen and

Classmen alike. After the examination is over,
the examiners (in this instance called Moderators)
distribute the names of those whom they judge
to have shown sufficient merit into three classes,
the names in each class being arranged alphabeti-
cally. If a candidate is not good enough to be
placed in a class, but has yet shown as much
knowledge as is required of the ordinary Passmen,
he receives a testamur to that effect. This is
called a "gulf." The subjects for Pass Modera-
tions are Latin Prose (rather more difficult than
for Eesponsions); the elements of Logic, or
Arithmetic and Algebra to Quadratic Equations;
unseen passages of Greek and Latin; and three
authors, of whom one must be Greek, and one
must be either an Orator, Philosopher, or His-
torian.
After a little questioning, Mr. Wood's advice
to Frank was to go in for a Pass, and, that over,
to read for Honours in one of the Final Schools,
such as Modern History or Law. The advice
was wise, for his classical reading was not very
much advanced; and even if he could have
got through the bare reading of the necessary
text-books, he would not have acquired the style

of translation and elegance in composition needed
for the highest honours.
He chose Logic in preference to Mathe-
matics, by Mr. Wood's advice; and for his
authors, Herodotus (Books V. and VI.); Livy
(Books V., VI., and VII.), and Juvenal, certain
Satires being omitted. Having purchased these
books, and laid in a good store of industrious
intentions, he left Oxford and his freshman's term
· behind him, not at all sorry to be going home.

CHAPTER V.
THE LONG VACATION.
There was a good deal of the schoolboy's plea-
sure in the commencement of the holidays., mixed
with the pride that he felt in his new condi-
tion. There were only a few passengers for
Porchester, and only a few people on the platform
when he alighted; bnt the few there were knew
him, and Oxford made the chief matter of their
inquiries, and a pleasant topic for him to dilate
upon. But he was soon hurried off by two of his
admiring younger brothers, and seated at the
side of old John, the factotum, in the pony-
carriage, talking hard, now to him, now to his
brothers, who sat behind. How familiar the road
was! Did green hedges ever look so green as
those? or was summer twilight ever so sweet as
this that lay so peacefully about little Porchester?
The old church-tower rose like a soft shadow

from the close trees. There, beside it, peeped
the vicarage gables and chimneys. There was
old Sally, the laundress, resting at her gateway,
rubbing her wrinkled fingers as though she would
smooth away the sign3 of so much soap and
water. There was the postmaster putting up the
shutters of his little grocery-shop; the tailor in
his garden, tending his standard roses; the
blacksmith at his silent smithy; there were the
carrier's horses just being unharnessed from the
van that in these primitive parts was no mean
rival of the railway. A few children here; a knot
of women there, chattering, scolding, laughing,
staring, questioning; there a group of men
outside the "Anchorhere some boys playing
marbles.
How unchanged it all was! The term at
Oxford seemed like a dream. Frank could
scarcely believe he had been away more than two
months.
Now they are passing the vicarage garden.
The gate is open, and Frank, much to the amuse-
ment of Tom and Will in the hind-seat of the
pony-carriage, stares hard through the white posts
and up the lawn. Whatever his thoughts or

hopes may have been, they are rudely interrupted
(and most probably shattered) by a couple of
voices from behind, which seem to be bubbling
<"ver with amusement, and to be jostling each
other for the first and loudest place.
"She's away!"
"Who's away?" asked Frank quietly, with
assumed indifference.
"Who's away?" repeat the two behind.
"Why, who're you looking for, eh?"
"Ave the vicarage people away, then?" said
Frank.
"Eose is," again comes from the bubbling
voices.
But before the subject can be pursued further,
old John, pointing with his whip, says,—■
"There's the master, sir."
And Frank, looking straight away up the road,
discerns his father coming towards them, and
jumps out of the carriage.
"Why, Frank, my boy, I declare you've
grown!"
Nor did his dignity decline the honour. He
took his father's arm, and, letting the younger
ones drive home with John and the luggage,

walked and talked with his father till they reached
the house. His mother and sisters were at the
door to welcome him. Never had there been
such a pleasant, proud home-coming yet. The
servants peeped from the upper windows to see
"Master Frank," whom they doubtless expected
to find completely transformed, and John, taking
the luggage from the carriage, again took stock
of him, and told the servants with an air that, as
always, carried weight,—
"Arter all, there's no place like college to make
a man of a young gentleman."
One scene more to complete the first act of our
freshman's life.
Mr. Boss was, as became a lawyer, a man of
sound business-like habits. Directly after break-
fast on the following morning he called Frank
into his study, and they went together through
all the bills.
The result of their investigation was as
follows:—
Travelling and Hotel Expenses at £ s. d.

The summer passed. Frank had been to the
Henley Eegatta at Crawford's invitation, and had
stayed with him at the old "Red Lion" with
various crews; had run down the bank at his
side when he was practising for the Diamond
Sculls in the sweet June mornings, and had
shouted with the shouting crowd when he won the
race, beating the London man and the Cantab
who had been training "dark." Then he had
gone to Crawford's home for a pleasant week;
then back to little Porchester, where, with garden-
parties and cricket, with boating on the river that
seemed so deserted after the crowded Isis, and
lawn-tennis, the time had passed away happily
enough. Of work for the " Schools " Frank had
done little or nought; but when in August the

vicar's daughter left Porchester for six weeks,
work somehow seemed easier, and he managed to
get through a fair amount; and again, when the
boys went back to school about the middle of
September, and he was left alone with his parents
and sisters, there seemed fresh opportunities for
study. But then—but then back came the vicar's
daughter, and books were again forgotten. The
village seemed to have gained fresh beauties.
Every old gate and stile seemed no longer made
of common wood, every hedge no longer clad with
common green. The organ-loft where she prac-
tised in the week was no longer a dusty, dark,
break-neck place, but the place for breaking
something which, whatever lovers may say, is
often easily mended by
"Time and the change the old man brings."
And what a poet Frank was in those days!
How he idealized, and in his own fashion glorified,
every little winding woodland path, every glimpse
of wold seen through the fading autumn leaves,
every stretch of quiet river, the old boats, the
crumbling bridge, the dark weir, the church-
tower—that useful part of a young poet's stock-in-
trade.

In fact, when he returned to Oxford one Friday
evening in October, he quite agreed with the old
woman's and the sailor's superstition that Friday
was an unlucky day; he wrapped himself in his
rug, and felt that if his heart was not breaking,
he was at least deeply in love. Silence was his
consolation. He rejected the invitation of a friend
whom he met en route to transfer himself and his
goods to the atmosphere of a smoking compart-
ment. He stared gloomily at the persistent
bookstall-boys; rejected even the offer of a Ban-
bury cake at Didcot. In his condition, there was
something positively comforting in that most
cheerless and wretched of all stations. The wind
that moaned in the telegraph-wires seemed to
murmur "Eose." The bell that rang violently
in the platform-porter's hand seemed like the
little single bell in Porchester Church—of course
much louder and harsher to Frank's imagination,
but it was a bell, and it recalled Rose, and that
was enough.
Having passed safely through the turmoil of
the Oxford platform, and the loneliness of
Friday night, on Saturday morning ho rushed
precipitously to Davis's picture-shop in "the

Turl," 1 and having purchased a photograph of
the Huguenot picture by Millais, hung it in a
corner by his chimney looking-glass. In that
corner his friends noticed he now was constantly
to be found sitting. They, of course, did not know
that in that picture Frank saw Rdse and himself
under the vicarage wall. He was at a loss, it is
true, to account even to himself for the pocket-
handkerchief which is being bound round the re-
luctant arm. But what mattered to him such a
paltry detail, even though it made the whole gist
of the picture?
Term began with the usual routine. Chapel at
half-past eight on Saturday evening, at which all
assembled except a few who were detained by
those convenient "tidal trains," which always
seem to be late when one is coming back from a
Long-Vacation scamper on the Continent, or
from the injured Emerald Isle, but never when
one is thither bound.
And then comes Sunday morning, with the
many good-intentioned ones hurrying to their
seats past the much-enduring Bible-clerk, whose

labours would, however, very soon lessen with the
growth of term;—Sunday, with the heavy
luncheon ;—Sunday, with the long constitutional
in the bright October sunlight—was a first
Sunday in Michaelmas Term ever other than a
bright one? Dinner in Hall at six, with the end-
less greetings that the confusion of Chapel had
prevented. Monday morning, with its formal
calls on Master and Dean, Tutor and Lecturer; and
Monday evening, with its posted list of lectures,
club-meetings, and subscriptions; till Tuesday
morning comes, with the greater or less obedi-
ence of the victims of those various calls, shows
that term has begun in very earnest, no matter
whether the earnestness be the earnestness of in-
dustry or of that which flourishes as abundantly
—idleness.

"the plying terms."
It was a Thursday night; and the rooms of the
"Union" were crowded, for the debate was to be
opened by a popular member. A few men were
in the reading-rooms, indifferent to the subject
and its mover; a few were in the writing-room,
hurrying over their letters, in order to be in time
for the " private business," which is usually the
most amusing part of the evening's proceedings.
There were several important telegrams posted in
the Hall, and the stopping of members to read
them considerably added to the general confusion.
Ladies were hurrying upstairs to the little uncom-
fortable gallery,1 with amused looks of curiosity,
or the calm equanimity ,of accustomed visitors.
1 The new Debating Hall, now (October) almost complete,
will provide ample accommodation for visitors.

No one to-night waited to read, either for
edification or for amusement, the endless notices
of those private tutors, to whom advertisement
seems a dire necessity—those manifestos of all
shades, pleading, peremptory, apologetic, confi-
dential, and confident, which suggest the ques-
tion :—" Where are the pupils, to be instructed
by these willing and anxious instructors?"
The steward's room is in possession of two
attendants only, for the steward and his inde-
fatigable son are upstairs in the committee-
room, in attendance upon the committee.
It is eight o'clock, and the debating-room is
crammed. Every seat is filled] but those for
whom there are not seats are quite content to
stand. The gallery is.fringed with women's faces,
looking down upon the mass of men below. There
is a murmur of suppressed conversation, which
suddenly ceases on the cry of " Order." The
president enters, followed by the treasurer,
librarian, and most of the members of the com-
mittee. He is in evening dress—the exception and
not the rule; in his case it is the sign of honour.
He has been dining, for the first time, at the
High table of the college which has just elected

him Fellow. To-night is his first public appear-
ance since his election, and, being a popular man
and officer, he is loudly cheered. The officers
seat themselves, and in a moment the president
rises and proclaims " Order," and the business of
the evening commences. He first reads a list of
those members of the University proposed for
election, and those already elected, and then calls
upon the librarian to bring forth his list of books.
That officer, a big-headed, ungainly man, with a
squint, hurries through a list, to which prices and
particulars are appended, and then asks any, who
wish, to challenge any book or books. If any are
challenged, they are temporarily withdrawn from
the list, and the rest are put to the vote and
carried; after which the objections are made to
the particular books before challenged} and are
met by the librarian with considerable ability, and
the books, with one exception, earned. He then
rises to propose " That' The Gorgon Head' (much
laughter), by Mr. Tennyson Jones, presented by
the author to the library, be accepted by the
society, and that a vote of thanks be given to the
honourable member for his present."
No one wishing to challenge this proposition,

it is formally put and carried, with faint cheer-
ing.
The president then rises : “Does any honour-
able member wish to put any question to the
officers of this society relative to their official
duties ?"
At least a dozen members rise in different parts
of the room—we beg pardon-the House.
A red-headed young gentleman, with spectacles,
catches first the president's eye, and is put in
possession of the House. His voice is high and
shrill.
« Sir "
“Hear! hear!” from several facetious mem-
bers encouragingly.
“Sir, I wish to ask the honourable treasurer
(loud cries of Speak up, sir ')-I wish to ask
the honourable treasurer”
“Hear ! hear!” from a stentorian voice in one
corner.
“Order ! order !”
“Sir,” again resumes the luckles red-headed
inquirer, “I-I-have lost my umbrella. I-I-
put it in the stand on Wednesday evening-
('Hearl hear I')-on my way to--to-the smok-

ing-room, and—and—and —it was not there when
I came back." And the speaker drops into his
seat.
The treasurer takes no notice, but the pre-
sident rises and says :—" I must remind the
honourable member that any statement he may
have to make must be introduced or followed by
a question."
The owner of the lost umbrella rises, and
before he has opened his mouth is told to "speak
up." This time he does speak up, in very shrill-
ness: "I wish to ask the honourable treasurer
whether he will take some steps for the recovery
of my umbrella."
The treasurer is a stout youth, short of speech
and of stature. He clips his sentences: "I must
remind the honourable member that this society
is not a police institution. I regret the loss of
his umbrella. I regret still more that there are
members in this society so careless or so dis-
honest as to remove umbrellas not belonging to
them."
"Sir "—from another corner—" I consider the
answer of the honourable treasurer most unsatis-
factory. I now beg to ask him whether he will

take steps to prevent the robbery—(Oh! oh!')
-yes-robbery of the property of members of
this society.”
The treasurer is again on his legs : “In answer
to the last honourable member, I beg to say that
as far as I know anything of the funds of this
society, it is not in a position to pay for police-
men to guard the umbrellas of honourable
members. If honourable members value their
umbrellas, I should recommend them to leave
them in the steward's room, or carry them with
them into whichever of the society's rooms they
may go.”
“Sir”—from another quarter—"will you move
for a committee of inquiry into the loss of
umbrellas and other property ?” (Loud cheers.)
By this time the treasurer is white-hot :-"No,
sir !” and he flumps into his chair-(loud cheers
from the treasurer's partisans and from the
admirers of his doggedness). He is not, however,
yet done with.
“I beg to ask the honourable treasurer,"
says a grimy-looking youth, "why there are so
few nail-brushes in the lavatory ?” (Roars of
laughter.)


## p. 83 (#91) ##############################################

"The Flying Terms'' 83
"In answer to the honourable member," says
the treasurer, "I beg to state that I have
already given orders for a fresh and—as they
seem so much in request—a still larger supply."
(Cheers.)
Then there is a brief space of silence.
"Does any other honourable member wish to
put any questions to the officers of this society
relative to their official duties?"
No one rising, the president says—
"The House will now proceed to public busi-
ness ;" and after waiting a few seconds, to give
those who wish the chance to leave, he reads from
a notice-board,—
"The motion before the House is, 'That the
present Ministry is unworthy of the confidence of
this House and of the nation,' moved by Mr
Dubber, of Trinity."
There is a perfect uproar as Mr. Dubber rises
and moves towards the table—cheers from his
supporters, groans from his opponents; but he is
too accustomed to the temper of his audience to
take any notice. He pours out a glass of water
and leisurely drinks half the contents, and waits
confidently. His confidence commands atten-

tion; and in a clear, ringing voice, he proceeds to
rattle away a clever resume of the stump speeches
of his political party. There is no lack to-night
of speakers. No less than six rise directly he sits
down.
And so the debate goes on unflaggingly until
half-past fen, when, there being no more speakers,
the mover replies; and then the president reads
the motion once more, and says,—
"Those who are in favour of this motion will
say 'Aye;' those who are against it will say
'No.'"
There are nearly 500 members present, and the
noise may be imagined.
"The 'Noes' have it," is the president's
ruling.
"Divide! divide!" from the "Ayes; " and the .
president accordingly gives the order,—
"Those who are in favour of this motion will
go to the right of the chair; those who are against
it to the left."
Then follows a scene of indescribable con-
fusion. In about ten minutes' time the numerous
tellers have agreed, and the president reads the
numbers,—

"Those who are in favour of this motion, 179;
those who are against it, 290. The motion is
therefore lost."
Loud cheers, and the House separates.
Within a few days of the commencement of
term, Frank had found his name posted for row-
ing—that is, for rowing under the direction of
the senior men who were coaching the likely
freshmen for the Torpid races, which would come
off in the ensuing Lent Term; and he took so
kindly to the work that he was soon regularly
among the recognized set from which the crew
would eventually be picked. In fact, his per-
formances had attracted the notice of the pre-
sident of the University Boat Club, and he had
been "down" with the men who were being
coached with a view to rowing against Cambridge.
This was indeed an honour; and he strained
every energy to get chosen for one of the Trial
Eights that were to race at tho end - of term,
and from which the University Bight (commonly
* called "the 'Varsity ") would be selected. . »
His wishes were fulfilled, and he was put No.

two boats. This, of course, insured his rowing

in his College Torpid next term, and in his College
Eight in the summer term, and it might have led
to a seat in "the ''Varsity."
As a matter of fact, it did not; but Frank was
well content with the honour of merely rowing in
the "Trials/' and more especially as the Eight in
which he was rowing won the race in November.
Towards the close of term he was made a Free-
mason, and very proud he was to tell his father,
himself a Mason of some distinction, the various
gossip of his lodge, "The Apollo," which claims
among its members some of England's best-
known brethren.
One other little distinction Frank had to relate
on going down for the Christmas vacation, and
that was the flattering notice, in the Under-
graduate's Journal, of a poem of his which had
appeared in the University magazine, College
Rhymes;1 and it may safely be asserted that
no one in Porchester was prouder of the poet
than the vicar's daughter, who saw herself reflected
in the mirror of his verse.
The Christmas vacation passed. Lent Term
came, and with it the Torpids. Paul's made five

bumps, and Frank duly posted copies of the
Undergraduate's Journal, which recorded the
fact, to the vicarage and to his home. But with
this proud event he abandoned for the present
most of his amusements, confined himself to the
practice for the Eights which wore coming off in
May, and to his work for Moderations, which
was fixed for about the same date. The college
lectures not being sufficient, he found himself
obliged to "put on a coach"—i.e. employ a
private tutor—during the summer term; but
when he got his "testamur" in June, just a week
before Commemoration, ho and his father both
felt that the ten guineas 1 had been profitably
expended.

of three lessons weekhr, of one hour each.

Moderations being thus thrown behind, the next
step was the choice of subjects in which to take
a degree. For the Second Public or Final Exa-
mination for the degree of B.A. there is yet
further scope of subject allowed. Here, again, a
student has the option of taking a Pass or an
Honour Degree; and here also both Passmen
and Classmen alike have to pass an examination
in the Rudiments of Faith and Religion, the sub-
jects of which are :—
(1) The Books of the Old and New Testament.
(2) The Holy Gospels and Acts of the Apostles in the
original Greek.
(3) The Thirty-nine Articles.
But any candidate may for himself, or his parents
or guardians for him, object on religious grounds

Frank had always intended to go in for one of
the Honour Schools, but agreed with his father

that there was no necessity to avail himself of
the longest allowance of time granted. He need
not present himself for three years, but his father
decided that two years was quite long enough, in
addition to the year he had already spent. He
must do what he could in the two years.
There was no dispute between father and son.
Their views corresponded. Frank was to be called
to the Bar, and the Honour School of Law was
chosen for the degree. The subjects for this
would, in a great measure, answer the further
purpose of the Bar Call Examination. Mr. Ross
proposed to enter Frank's name at the Inner
Temple in the ensuing Michaelmas Term. He
should then "eat dinners" during the two years
in which he was reading for his Oxford degree;
that taken, he should have one year's reading in a
barrister's chambers. This, he considered, ought
to qualify him not only in book-work, but prac-
tically for a call. Moreover, it would give him
just the necessary time to complete the statutable
number of terms.
Frank was anxious to enter at once, before the
Trinity Term was over, but on this point his
father was firm. There was no need for such im-

mediate hurry. As it was, he would be qualified
for a call, at an age considerably below the
average. Mr. Ross had noticed that the first
Long Vacation had been, comparatively speaking,
wasted. He had said nothing, but had resolved
that the second and third should not be a repeti-
tion of the first. He therefore directed Frank to
write to his college tutor, Mr. "Woods, for par-
ticulars of the subjects for the Honour Law School,
and for advice as to a " coach" for part of the
Long Vacation; and he himself wrote to his
old friend, Mr. Wodehouse, on the latter point.
Frank's letter from Mr. Woods was as fol-
lows :—
"Paul's.
"Deae Mb. Ross,—I am very glad to hear that you have
so soon made up your mind as to the subjects in which you
propose to take your degree; and I have no doubt your
father's plan of entering you at the Inner Temple next
Michaelmas Term is a wise one.
"Mr. Edwards, of University College, is, I have every
reason to believe, a most advisable Law ' coach.' He is just
now arranging a reading party to Switzerland, and I should
hope your father will consent to your joining. Tell him
from me that reading parties are not what they were in my
undergraduate days—mere pleasure-trips, in which work
forms the very last consideration. The few men now who

go with a reading party really go to read. You may men-
tion my name in writing to Mr. Edwards. He will, of course,
furnish you with all particulars.
"Believe me, yours sincerely,
"J. Woods."
The letter from Mr. Wodehouse was character-
istic :—
"Deae Me. Ross,—Law is not my line, or I would take
your boy myself; but I know an excellent coach, Edwards
of University, who is now settling a reading party, for
Switzerland, I believe. Send your boy with him; you can't
do better. I send by this post a copy of the Examination
Regulations, revised to this date. Details, of course, you
will get from Edwards.
"I am yours truly,
"Philip Wodehouse."
After the letters, there was not much difficulty
in deciding that Edwards was the coach to be
secured. But the Swiss tour! Frank said no-
thing, nor did Mr. Eoss—the former because he
knew his father's disposition, the latter because
he would not promise what he might not be able,
with justice to the rest of his family, to afford.
However, after a suspense of three days, Frank
was summoned after breakfast to the study. His -
father had received a letter from the coach, tell-

ing him the probable cost of the tour, and he had
decided to send Frank. The party would leave
London on the 1st of July. They were to meet
for dinner at the Grosvenor Hotel at six o'clock,
and go from Victoria by the mail that catches the
night-boat from Dover to Calais. Mr. Edwards
added a few particulars as to books, and, rightly
conjecturing this to be Frank's first journey
abroad, some suggestions as to clothes and neces-
saries generally.
Mr. Ross winced a little when he heard the
route that was chosen. But when he had made
up his mind to an expense, he was not a man to
worry over the inevitable extras.
The few days of June that remained passed
quickly enough. Frank, somehow, was not at
home as much as his brothers and sisters could
have wished. At meals there were sundry ques-
tions as to his doings, amused looks at his evident
confusion, till even Mr. Ross, usually oblivious to
the jokes that passed between the young folks,
questioned his wife as to their meaning.
When he heard the suggestion, he at first
laughed at it as ridiculous, then said the whole
affair was "out of the question," not from any

dislike to Rose, for he was indeed very fond of her,
and finally saying he would speak to Frank, said
nothing after all.
It was a soft, sweet evening, that of June 30th,
and Frank, having finished his packing, slipped
out unnoticed after dinner. It was a difficult
matter to avoid the prying eyes of his brothers,
but the dessert that evening was unusually ab-
sorbing, and long after Mr. and Mrs. Ross had
left the table, the boys were diligently making
themselves ill. Seizing the opportunity, ho
was three fields beyond the paddock before his
absence was even mentioned.
He was sad, down-hearted, romantically melan-
choly. And yet he had a delightful tour through
Switzerland in store. Porchester had never
seemed such a lovely little place. No Swiss
mountains could ever have such beauty as those
soft hills yonder; no glaciers the charm of the
gently flowing river; no Alpiue forests the sweet-
ness of these English meadows, now silvering
with the evening dew, and softening in the falling
mist. He stopped by a gate. He found his
initials cut there, just in one corner out of sight;

and near them one other letter. Three years ago
he had broken his best knife, and cut his finger,
oyer that little work. And there it was still—
lichened over now, but still legible. He would
not touch it. He wondered if it would still be
there when he came back. When he came back
Was the boy going to India for twenty years, or
to the North Pole? Who would touch the let-
ters? Who would even read them? Who that
came by this way would be likely to stop by that
uninteresting gate, and draw aside those great
dock-leaves merely to see F. R. and R. clumsily
carved? And who, if they saw them, would
trouble to deface them?
But Frank was in love and was proportionately
melancholy. And lo! as in answer to his
thoughts, softly over the new-cut grass comes the
vicar's daughter.
It should be clearly understood that the path-
way along which Rose came so opportunely was
public, though seldom frequented. It led from
the village of Porchester to a ferry, and this carried
you to a hamlet, Wood Green, that lay within
the vicar's ministrations. Just now there was
illness in the hamlet, and Rose used daily to visit

the sick. Frank, on no such journeys bent,
passed many hours of those last days of Juno
about the fields, and crossing and re-crossing in
the ferry-boat. Luckily this was worked by a
marvellous contrivance of wheels, ropes, and poles,
and there was no observant Charon to wonder at,
and then report, the strange and repeated pas-
sages of the lawyer's son. Last evening, at the
same time and place, he had met Eose: had
told her he was leaving for Switzerland : had gone
so far as to ask her if she was going to Wood
Green the next evening; and she, because she
was Rose, told him yes. Perhaps there was
another reason, the cause of which lay in him.
But she never speculated. He had asked her,
and she had told him. She was going to Wood
Green, and why not say so?
They walked slowly, oh! so slowly, across the
misty meadows. They crossed, as lazily as the
stream would suffer them, the little ferry. They
reached Wood Green. It was only a basket and
a message that Eose had to deliver to-night, and
Frank had not long to wait at the little white
wicket at Vowles's cottage. Then back again,
across tho ferry, and up the fields; and then, just

by the gateway where they had met, they stopped,
and he showed her something, pulling aside the
gigantic dock-leaves—three letters, rudely cut,
and covered with lichen.
"I cut them three years ago,"he said. "Was
it very silly?"
"I don't know," she answered.
"I loved you then, Rose," he said softly, taking
her hand, " but I love you a thousand times more
now, darling."
And Rose has told him something that makes
him utterly happy—something they have known
these many weeks, but neither has dared to ex-
press. They are but children, but why should they
nob be happy? Only boy and girl, but is tbat any
reason why their love should not bo true? And
so they walk back through the deepening summer
night, he as proud as knight of old, and she as
happy as any "fair ladye." And then by the
vicarage garden-gate they say good-bye. They
have not thought of the future. The present is
theirs, and that is enough. She is a simple little
village girl, and he an undergraduate; that is
all. . But "all" is a great deal to them.
At six o'clock in the evening of July 1st,

Edwards and his six pupils dined at the Grosvenor,
wisely and not too well, in view of the passage
that night. The party consisted of Hoskins of
Brasenose, reading for Honours in Law; Lang
and Kingdon of Christ Church, Maude of John's,
'and Eoyds of Exeter, reading for the Final Pass
Schools; and Frank, who had thus one companion
only in work. Edwards was quite a young man.
He had been married about two years, but left
his wife and child at home. He was just of an
age not to be " donnish," and yet old enough to
command a certain amount of necessary respect.
The pecuniary arrangements were as usual.
Each was to pay his own personal expenses, and
tuition-fee to Edwards at the rate of 10Z. per
month. But for the sake of convenience he would
make the actual payments, and divide the amounts
weekly.
At Victoria they broke up, for most of the men
wanted to smoke. Edwards was not a smoker,
and would have travelled to Dover alone had not
Frank got into his compartment. The coach's
weakness in this respect was the one little diffi-
culty on the tour, and afforded a fund of amuse-
ment to the rest, who were young enough to re-

gard a non-smoker with feelings of surprise.
With the exception of Royds, none of the seven
had ever been abroad. He spoke French slightly,
and had a smattering of German. Edwards
could not speak a word of the former, but knew
enough of the latter for comfort in travelling.
No one else spoke either. Royds plumed himself
on his position of superiority, not without offence
to the rest of the party, who one and all joined in
snubbing him whenever he forgot his relation to
Edwards. He was just a source of a little
"pleasant acidity."
"I should advise you to lie down, if you're in-
clined to be sea-sick," said Royds, for the benefit
of the party generally, when they were on board.
"I never am."
Edwards retired to the centre of the boat;
Frank rolled himself in a rug on a bench near the
central deck cabins. The rest again consoled
themselves with cigars. The passage was long,
for the night was foggy; but the water was calm
as a duck-pond. Nevertheless, Royds looked
very pale as he landed at Calais.
They reached Paris in the early sweetness of
the morning. And what a charm the great city

has at that hour, and to first-comers! The
brightness, the laughter, the sunshine of the
town in its life! What a contrast to the death
and dirt of London at such an hour!
They rushed across to an hotel near the Lyons
Station, and after a hasty breakfast, breaking in-
to three parties, drove all over the place, seeing,
not " doing," as much as time allowed. In the
evening they left for Geneva. Here they stayed
two nights, and then went on to Chamounix by
diligence. From Chamounix they ascended the
Montiinverfc to cross the Mer de Glace.
This was their first climb. Royds, of course,
had been before; and with quite a paternal air ho
selected a guide one evening, and marshalled the
party the following morning. Going up the
pine-woods, their weary eyes were refreshed by the
sight of three female figures. Without confessing
as much to one another, they one and all quick-
ened. But still those much-wished-for forms re-
treated, nor did they stop till Lhe little hut on the
top was reached. And then !—But we draw a
veil. They were charming ladies, and delighted
to see these gay young Englishmen. But, dear
ladies! they were not young. However, they

were very pleasant, and the sound of the
English tongue has a marvellous charm among
foreigners.
The following morning, at ten o'clock, the
corner by the Hotel de l'Union was the centre of
interest for the good folks of Chamounix. There
at the hotel door stood seven sturdy mules and
two guides. And presently, to the infinite de-
light of the bystanders, seven young English-
men, followed by many packages, emerged and
mounted. They were bound for Martigny, over
the Col de Balme.
Poor guides! Unaccustomed to such riders,
they started on their journey in happy igno-
rance. That evening, at seven o'clock, after
a game struggle to keep within sight of their
charges, they gave it up. And the cavalcade,
headed by Edwards, putting their mules to their
utmost speed (no contemptible pace considering
their day's work), raced wildly by the wondering
villagers into Martigny. Knapsacks banged and
flapped over the mules' backs; tutor and pupils
were boys once more, and simply shouted with
delight as they clattered through the quiet streets.
Much to his disgust the great Royds didnotcomo

in first. His was the worst mule, he explained at
table-d'hote.
All slept soundly that night at Martigny.
There they again fell in with the ladies of
the hut on Montanvert, and talked, with all the
energy of comrades in danger, of the crossing of
the Mer de Glace and the descent of the Mauvais
Pas, to the not-unreasonable amusement of Royds.
Next morning they left for Brieg, going by rail
to Sierre, not without missing the first train, and
imprecating maledictions on the head of the land-
lord who, his hotel being somewhat empty, was
constrained to adopt some measures for detaining
his profitable guests. Arrived at Sierre, they
were told the diligence for Brieg had started, and
were offered carriages. A little patience, however,
proved this to be one of the usual misrepresenta-
tions, and in due course, after a hearty dejeuner in
the pretty old inn, they started in the company of
a very fat ecclesiastic and a young and happy
couple of Americans. Prom Brieg, which they
reached at eight, after heavy rain, they were to
ascend the Bel-alp, where Edwards intended to
stay for a clear fortnight or three weeks for
work.


## p. 109 (#117) ############################################

A Reading Party.
There was no diligence to the Bel-alp; that
they knew; but they had fondly hoped there was
a carriage-road. They were quickly undeceived.
There was only a bridle-path, and it was now
late and getting dark. But Edwards had resolved
to push on without further delay, and, seeing he
was firm, the landlord of " La Poste " raised no
objections. The heavier luggage was to be carried
up, on the following day. The absolute necessaries
were packed on the sturdy shoulders of two
guides; and at half-past eight the party started.
The rain, which had been falling heavily all the
afternoon, fortunately ceased, but there was no
moon, and the clouds hung thickly. The dark-
ness intensified the grandeur of the hills and
made the climb seem harder. Once, as they
passed between a cluster of chdlets, all dark and
still, the moon struggled into view, and far below
they saw a great white sea; but it was only the
mist that lay along the valley. At half-past ten
they reached the first halting-place, a little chalet
perched on a level plateau. There was no light,
and only the sound of the bells on the cows whose
slumbers they had disturbed. But presently, after
some patient knocking, the door was opened by a

young giant of seven feet, with a stm-dy girl at
bis side.
Royds, the officious, the experienced, the polite
traveller, advanced, took off his hat, and made
some remarks in French; but neither host nor
hostess understood him, and the guide's patois
was necessary to explain. In they all trooped to
the rough, low, wooden room, glad enough to rest.
The wine was sour, but it was the landlord's best;
and they all made merry. Then one of the guides
sang a Tyrolese ditty, of which the following is a
paraphrase :—
"With rifle aye ready,
A dog of sharp scent,
And a maiden to love him,
A lad is content.
"What needs hath the hunter?
The hunter hath none
But a nut-hrown-eyed maiden,
A dog, and a gun.
"On Sunday, the church-day,
To dance we are gone;
Andrew leads Peggy,
Janet leads John."
And then the guides, the landlord, and his wife

all sang together; the young giant representing
tho love-sick tenor in such a way as to make
every one shout with laughter :—
Tenor. "Out of the Tyrol I come, a long, long way,
To look for my sweetheart, my little May.
Bass. What does he say?
Soprano. Ah, poor lover 1
All. So long, so long he has not seen his love,
So long he has not seen his love!
Tenor. "As any bright penny was my little Jenny!
And a dimple was in
My Jenny's sweet chin!

Tenor. "'Tis two long years agone
Since I left my love alone;
I'd give my true love's weight in gold
Could I her face behold.
Bass. Hark what he says!
Soprano. 0 what a fond lover!
All. So long, so long he has not seen his love!"
And then Edwards sang an English song, the
rest joining in the chorus, to the infinite delight
of the Switzers. After which the guide sug-
gested moving on.
At half-past one they reached the Bel-alp, and
found, somewhat to their surprise, that there was

no village, not even a chalet, but only a great inn,
half wooden, half stone. The landlord, a little,
fat, hoarse-speaking man, with a thick black
moustache, and two cow-girls, called chamber-
maids, with their faces swathed in flannel, met
them; and presently they slept soundly in their
little bare rooms, with tbeir wooden walls and
ceilings, that made them feel for all the world as
though they were dolls put to bed in boxes.
But what a view next morning! Down there
in the valley, as they stand at the inn door, they
can just make out where Brieg lies. Beyond, the
entrance to the Simplon Pass; and, over all, the
Matterhorn, Weisshorn, Monte Leone, Mischabel,
and the Fletschhorn. Up behind them towers
the great white Sparrenhorn. Down on the left
crawls the broad Aletsh Glacier, with its huge,
rough, pale-blue waves moving and melting, and
foaming at the "snout" in torrents of stormy
water.
The inn was full, and three weeks went plea-
santly enough. People came and went, for the
most part bound to or from the Eggisch-horn.
Every now and then there was a brief excitement
caused by the arrival of some friend whom chance

had brought. Some of the visitors were regularly
settled, and with these the men soon formed
acquaintance: notably, Professor Tyndall, who
was there on one of his usual summer visits,
measuring tho motion of tbe glaciers, and who, as
"Father of the Table-d'hote," made the meals
doubly pleasant with his genial talk and merry
laugh. Then there was another, well known in
the public-school world, with his wife—a jolly
pair—and a young couple from Ireland, who,
oddly enough, turned out to be distant connexions
of Lang. The husband fraternized with the men
in their climbs. The wife spent most of her
time rambling along the mountain paths within
easy distance, in which she was not unfrequently
accompanied by Eoyds, who flattered himself on
being eminently a "ladies' man." There were
several old ladies who, each evening, used
to entice the men to whist. Frank usually
was one of those caught. Lang and Maude,
the two lazy ones of the party, always re-
tired to the smoking-room, whence they never
emerged till midnight. The others, for the most
part, read in the common sitting-room. Edwards
devoted four hours in the morning to his pupils'

work, from 8 to 12, and one hour before din-
ner. Out of respect for Lang and Maude, their
hour was fixed at 11. But, as often as not,
when that hour arrived, on looking out of the
window to call them in, their coach would hear
that they were not down yet, or would see
them strolling casually down the hill to meet the
mules which brought the letters or the day's pro-
visions from Brieg.
"Haven't got any work ready yet," would be
Lang's answer, if Edwards managed to overtake
them.
"Do you mind taking me after dinner ?" from
Maude.
But in spite of the idleness of these two, the
average amount of work achieved by the party
was very creditable, and Edwards was satisfied.
At the end of the fixed three weeks, to the great
regret of the landlord (for he found the young
Oxonians thirsty to a degree) and of most of the
guests, the party departed. They went as they
came, on foot, with a couple of horses to carry
their luggage, and a couple of guides to carry
Lang, who had contrived to strain his ankle.
They slept one night in Brieg—a short, restless

night, with the diligences rolling through the
streets and clattering into the courtyards, with
jingling bells and cracking whips, the shouts of
the drivers, and the agonized voices of weary and
confused travellers. At six, in the fresh clear
dawn, they took the diligence for the Ehone Gla-
cier, and thence over the Furka to Andermatt.
There, also, they slept one night—in fact, slept
so soundly that when the diligence started next
morning for Fliielen by the St. Gothard Pass,
Edwards, Frank, and Eoyds alone were in time
for breakfast and for choice of seats; Hoskins
and Kingdon only saved their seats by chasing
the diligence after it had started; while the first
that Lang and Maude saw of the morning was the
sight of the diligence turning a corner, with three
of their companions seated outside, and two run-
ning frantically after it. But they consoled them-
selves with the reflection that this delay would
furnish them with an excellent excuse for " cut-
ting " the next day's lesson with Edwards. Frank
was separated from the rest of the party, having
for his companion a little soldier who spoke neither
French nor German, but an unintelligible patois
which made conversation impossible.

About ten o'clock they passed Altdorf. The
little town looked so bright and gay, full of
reverence for its William Tell, and ignorant of, or
despising, the knowledge that makes his story a
myth. Thence to Fliielen, and thence over the
clear waters of the Vierwaldstatter See to Lu-
cerne. What a change from the Bel-alp! Here
all is softened—grown Italian almost. Just in
the distance a few snowy peaks; but the frown-
ing heights have melted to soft wooded hills—■ .
running down to look at themselves in the glassy
mirror. Lucerne was reached about one o'clock;
and here, at the Englischer Hof, right on the
quay, a hospitable welcome met them.
Lang and Maude revelled in the change. For
them the Bel-alp was too cold, too dull; but here
they had the lake, the shops, the cafes, the band
at night, and all those countless charms which no
English town seems to possess. Here even Frank
relaxed a little. They made excursions every day,
for the most part in the comfortable little steamers.
They went up the Bigi luxuriously in the train.
Edwards, Eoyds, and Frank climbed Pilatus; the
rest were content with the Eigi. They bought
presents, useless as well as useful; they strummed

on the salon piano, and sang in broken German,
to the intense delight of tho waiters. They spent
the evenings invariably in a little cafe round the
corner, where Gretchen's merry black eyes flashed
from one to another, hardly divining the relation-
ship of the party; or, if not there, on the boule-
vard, listening to the band; and sometimes on
the lake; and it was on one of these occasions
that Edwards astonished them by his vocal as
well as his poetical powers.
Ho called his song, "The Lay of the Vice-
Chancellor,'' and it ran as follows :—
"I've sung you many a ditty, some stupid and some
witty,
In our snug and cosy common-rooms after dinner many a
day;
But there's one I have omitted, of a blunder I committed,
That may serve you as a warning, and may while an hour
away.
When I was young and hearty, I took a reading party
(" Hear, hear!" from the audience)
To study in America one summer long ago;
And while out there we tarried, I went—and—I got married,
And what that is, my bachelors, you very little know.
But upon that little portion of my most unhappy tale,
Will you kindly, will you kindly draw a veil, draw a veil?
Chorus.—Draw a veil! draw a veil!


## p. 118 (#126) ############################################

118 Oxford Days.
"But oh! when-I reflected that I should be expected
To forfeit either Fellowship or wife,
I thought 'twould be a pity she should leave her native city
And be tied to an old tutor all her life.
When I pictured you all cosy, at your port wine old and rosy,
And I was at cold mutton, and romance was growing cool—
When I thought of 3'ou so gaily dining gloriously daily,
I took a single cabin in a ship for Liverpool.
But upon the mix'd emotions of my hurried homeward sail,
Will you kindly, will you kindly draw a veil, draw a veil?
Chorus (very gently).—Draw a veil! draw a veil!
"Since then, by her unhamper'd, up fame's ladder I have
scamper'd,
And run through all our snug berths in a trice;
I've been Bursar, Dean, Professor, Public Orator, Assessor,
And sat on a commission once or twice..
I've told quite different stories to the Liberals and Tories;
I've snarl'd among the Eadicals, " Retrench!"
But I really should not wonder if my friend Lord Blood-and-
Thunder,
On the very next occasion, should transfer me to the' Bench.
So really let me beg you on that portion of my tale,
Will you kindly, will you kindly draw a veil, draw a veil?
Chorus.—Draw a veil! draw a veil!
When they were all back again in Oxford, even
many terms afterwards, " Draw a veil" was always
a sort of pass-word between them.
A fortnight soon passed, and they travelled to-
gether to Paris. Here they parted, Frank going

straight to Porchester, Edwards to Oxford. Frank
had made a good start with his law reading, and,
thanks to Edwards' style of teaching, had
thoroughly grasped all that he had touched, and
what is more, liked his subjects. One practical
point before passing to other scenes: his ex-
penses were 50L; — 35Z. for railway fares, hotel
bills, &c, 15^. to Edwards for tuition.

Paul's had no Law Lecturers, and Frank was
therefore compelled to "put on a coach." He ac-
cordingly wrote to Edwards, a week before term
commenced, to arrange with him. Much to his
surprise, the College offered to pay half the fee
on his behalf, which after all was but fair, con-
sidering that he had to pay his College tuition
fees, although there were no lectures for him.
By Edwards' advice he attended certain of the
Law Professors' Lectures, which were open to the
University at large—in some cases on payment of
11., in others free. Six hours in each week were
spent at these, and three hours with Edwards;
and with a daily average of four hours' private
reading ho considered he was industrious. His
degree seemed so far off. He would work more
when the time was drawing nearer. So he
consoled himself, and so the time went by.

Of Crawford he saw little, for it was Lis
last term, and he was in for Honours in the Final
Classical Schools in November. But on Sunday
they used to lunch together—alternately in one
another's rooms—and go for a long constitutional
afterwards. To Crawford alone of his many friends
he confided his hopes. To him alone he told
his dreams of Rose, of their engagement, and
even of the marriage in the future. And Crawford
never laughed at him, or pooh-poohed the notion
as a boyish fancy; for he saw that if there was
one thing more than another which would keep
him straight, and make him stick to his work,
it was the hope of one day making a home
for Rose. But the Bar! How hopeless it
seemed! To talk of marriage, at least three
years before the wig could be worn, much less
a brief gained! Still the boy was hopeful. And
why damp his energy? Besides, Crawford had a
belief—he knew it was not a prevalent one—that
though there are so many barristers, the Bar as a
profession is not really so crowded as the world
believes; that if you eliminate the large numbers
of so-called barristers who live by their pen, by
speculating—by anything, in fact, except the

profession they claim, the number of men left
is by no means large enough to do the work that
offers. Again, he knew that he came of a
family of lawyers, with large firms in various
towns, and at least one of considerable eminence
in London. So that altogether he by no
means considered the boy's ambitions and dreams
as baseless or silly. As for himself, he hardly
cared to confess his hopes. But Frank had always
placed him, in anticipation, in the position Craw-
ford secretly desired. He seemed fitted in every
way for a Fellowship and Tutorship. To begin
with, he was a gentleman in birth and in heart.
Ho would therefore know how to feel with, and
for, all the various grades of men with whom
he would come in contact: unlike the many
who, with neither the breeding nor the feelings
of gentlemen, have nothing but their intellec-
tual supremacy to recommend them.
As to Crawford's intellectual powers, he had
already given ample proof. He had taken a first
class in Classical Moderations. Ho had won
the Chancellor's prize for Latin Verse, and had
been proximo accessit for the Stanhope Essay.
And then, to crown all, from the boyish under-

graduate point of view, he bad rowed in his
College Eight, and won the Diamond Sculls
at Henley. Why, he was the very beau-ideal of a
Fellow. A handsome, clever, athletic English gen-
tleman. Oxford has had many such, and, thank
God, she has them still. Men who consider a fel-
lowship and tutorship a sacred trust; who look
upon the undergraduates as friends to be helped,
guided, and taught, but not in mere learning for
the schools; who will draw out, not crush, the
fresh hopefulness of youth; who will cheer, not
cloud, boys' ambitions; who will look for good
qualities, not watch and wait for errors; whose
chief thought will be what good they can do, and
not what fines they can impose.
"Do you see much of Monkton now?"
Crawford asked, as they were walking to God-
stow by the upper river.
"Very little," said Frank. "I can't think
what he does with himself."
"Not much, I fancy. I see him loafing occa-
sionally, and I believe that's pretty nearly all he
does. However, I'm glad you don't see much
of him." And Crawford changed tho subject.
"What's this I hear of you and the Undergraduates'

Journal? You don't moan to say you've taken to
write in it? I should have thought you had
work enough to do."
Frank got red and confused.
"Well, the fact is—I have written a few things;
but it didn't take much time."
"Ah! that's just where it is," said Crawford.
"If you do anything of that sort at all, it's worth
doing well—just as everything is, for the matter
of that. You haven't time to do it well, and you
square the matter by doing it hurriedly. You'd
far-better stick to your Law reading."
"I say, old fellow," remonstrated Frank, "I
didn't come out for a lecture. You're a regular
old school-master. I only wrote three little poems,
or 'sets of verses' as I suppose I ought to call'em:
that's the extent of my writing."
"Oh!" said Crawford, somewhat mollified.
"Well, take my advice; get your degree first and
write afterwards."
"That's all very well," retorted Frank; "but
I should like to know how you expect a fellow to
be able to write without practice? Reading Law
and writing answers to papers don't help one."
"I don't think we'll discuss the question any

further," answered Crawford. "You want to
marry Rose, I know, as quickly as possible. Well,
my opinion is that you'll do it a great deal more
quickly by reading Law than by writing poetry."
Frank was silent. There was truth in what
Crawford said, he knew; but he could not help
writing poetry. And whether he will ever be a
known poet,-ever succeed in charming the hydra-
headed public, or not, he certainly had one
requisite in a maker—spontaneity. Rose, of
course, considered him a poet in the highest
sense of the term. In fact, she cared for no
poetry but his, which speaks volumes for her
affection, but little for her powers of criticism.
But if lovers are to be critics, Love may as well go
to Mr. Critchet, and be operated on for cataract.
Term, with all its activity, was passing quickly.
Every day till two o'clock Frank devoted himself
to his work. From two till five he rowed, or
practised at the butts. From five till six he
usually spent at the Union, reading the papers or
magazines. Dinner at six. He did not do much
work in the evening, for various reasons—chiefly,
because he was too lazy—excusing himself because
he thought his eyes were weak; and partly

because of various engagements. On Tuesday
evening there was either a regular Apollo
lodge-meeting, or a lodge of instruction. Monday,
the Paul's Debating Society. Wednesday, the
practice of the Philharmonic, a somewhat different
form of excitement from the usual undergraduate
amusements, owing to the presence of a largo
number of ladies. Thursday, the debate at the
Union, in which he usually took part. Friday
and Saturday had no definite fixture; but then
there was always something in the shape of
nondescript entertainment at the "Vic," or
concert at the Town Hall or Corn Exchange;
or else there was a friend to be asked to dinner
in Hall, or an invitation to dinner to accept.
Altogether, his evening work never amounted to
more than one hour on the average.
One evening, seeing a large poster announcing
a performance by "the great Bounce," he turned
up the narrow little passage which leads from
Magdalen Street to the "gaff" that is dignified by
tho name of theatre. Here, by permission of the
Very Eeverend the Vice-Chancellor, and his
Worship the Mayor—a permission always neces-
sary and always publicly announced—entertain-

ments of every description, as long as thcy are
not stage plays, are performed. Conjurors,
mimics, ventriloquists, mesmerists, Tyrolese
singers, Japanese acrobats, music-hall singers
of every grade and degree, display themselves
before a crowded audience of undergraduates.
But anything so demoralizing as a play of
Shakespeare or other healthy author is strictly
forbidden. The authorities doubtless have their
reasons, but it is somewhat hard to imagine what
those reasons can be. An occasional concert
is given in the Town Hall or Corn Exchange,
to which of course ladies can go; but from
the entertainments in the "Vic," good, bad,
or indifferent, they are absolutely debarred. And
in very, very few instances do they miss anything
worth seeing.
The first person whom Frank recognized on
entering was Monkton, who was sitting in a
stage-box, or at least in what does duty for a
stage-box. He was dressed in a somewhat
startling costume of ginger-colour check; a
bright crimson necktie; his hat well on the side
of his head; an enormous cigar in his mouth,
which he appeared to be sucking rather than

smoking. Between his knees, a gigantic bull-
dog, whose efforts to plunge upon the stage or
into the orchestra he was with difficulty control-
ling. Another roan sat with him, dressed, if it
were possible, in louder style than he; and from
the tone of their voices they appeared not a little
pleased with themselves and with the impression
they were creating. The theatre was crammed
from floor to ceiling; the University element
decidedly predominating; the town being repre-
sented by a gallery full of that peculiar style of
cad and cadger for which Oxford seems so
famous. The smoke from pipes and cigars was
far too thick to allow of recognition except at a
very short distance; and Frank was much
relieved to find that Monkton did not "spot"
him.
We need not describe the performance. The
vulgar, strutting, swaggering comique, who
supplies in fancied wit what he lacks in voice;
the booming tenor, who yells "Tom Bowling"
to give respectability to the entertainment; the
brazen-throated "lady vocalist," who disdains to
be called a singer, and who certainly doesn't
deserve the title, are all too wearisome and

129
sickening to merit notice, but for the lamentable
fact that they are patronized by tho under-
graduate because the University authorities refuse
to sanction anything better.
The entertainment had not proceeded very far
before Monkton had attracted the notice of tho
"star" of the evening, who, seeing that he had
the audience on his side, commenced, in tho
spoken portion of his performance, to chaff "the
gentleman in ginger." Monkton's position was
too prominent for him to venture to respond;
perhaps, too, he was not good at repartee. At
all events, he drew back out of sight as far as
possible, contenting himself with allowing his
dog to put his forefeet on the cushion of the box
and to growl an answer to the chaff.
The next performer happened to be a young
lady not quite so much at her ease as is usual in
these persons. She was evidently frightened at
the dog; and Monkton, seeing his opportunity,
made the brute growl and spring forward as near
the singer as possible. There were loud cries of
"Turn him out!" The singer stopped in the
middle of her song, burst into tears, and ran off
at the wings. The manager came forward and

expostulated. By this time the gallery was
infuriated. Then Monkton let the dog go, and
with a bound he cleared the orchestra and leapt
on the stage. The manager, in evident trepida-
tion, rushed off. The orchestra seized their
instruments, and hastily began to decamp; some
one in the confusion turned out most of the gas;
and at that moment a cry of "Proctors!" was
heard.
It was by the merest chance that the Senior
Proctor happened to be passing, and hearing the
unusual disturbance, and the shouts which were
evidently not shouts of applause, came in. Ho
sent two of his men to one door, and he himself
with two waited at the principal exit. There
they took everybody's "name and College/'
giving directions as to tho usual call on the
following morning; and then, when the theatre
was emptied, sent for the manager, and learned
the facts of the case. Monkton had, of course,
made his way out with the rest, with no further
notice from the Proctor than they; but his time
was to come.
There was a great crowd at nine the next
morning at the Senior Proctor's rooms. The

men went as a matter of form, hardly expecting
to be fined for going to an entertainment sanc-
tioned by the University, and simply anticipating
an order to attend before the Vice-Chancellor for
an investigation of the fracas of the preceding
evening. Monkton appeared with the rest; and
from the way in which every one gave him the
cold shoulder he saw pretty clearly that no one
would screen him. At twelve o'clock he received
an official notice to answer before the Vice-Chan-
cellor to the charge of setting and inciting a bull-
dog, with intent to do bodily injury, and so forth.
At eleven o'clock on the following day there
was such a crowd as had not been seen in the
Vice-Chancellor's Court for many a long day.
The case was investigated as before a magistrate,
the Vice-Chancellor being ex officio a justice of
the peace for tho city of Oxford, with, however,
far greater powers. There were plenty of under-
graduates who gave evidence in support of the
charge, and tho manager and singers gladly
exonerated the rest of the audience. It was
acknowledged on all sides that neither Monkton
nor the "star" comique put in so easy and unem-
barrassed an appearance before the Very Reverend

the Vice-Chancellor and the Proctors as they did
in their respective positions on the eventful even-
ing. It was in vain that Monkton's solicitor
urged provocation on the part of the "star." There
were plenty of men ready to testify that they
too had been chaffed. The Vice-Chancellor gave
the defendant a sharp reprimand, fined him hi.,
and "sent him down for a term."
The Proctor's summons to the rest of the men
was allowed to pass, and they heard no more of
the matter.
The Michaelmas Law Term commenced on the
2nd of November, and Frank obtained leave from
the Dean to go to town to enter at the Inner
Temple and eat his first three dinners. He left
at 9 a.m., with feelings somewhat akin to those
he had on starting from home for matriculation,
with the important difference, however, that there
was no examination to face. His father met him
at Paddington, and they drove straight to the
Temple. At the gate of the " Inner " they found
the two friends who had promised to be sureties
for the payment of fees. With them they went
to the Steward's office, and there Frank presented
a paper signed by the Dean of Paul's to the effect

that he had passed a Public Examination at
Oxford. This exempted him from any examina-
tion on admission as a student of the Inns of
Court. On payment of one guinea he obtained a
form of admission, to be signed by two barristers
to vouch for his respectability, with which he and
his father went to the chambers of two friends,
who gave the necessary signatures; then back
again to tho Treasurer's office, where the two
sureties entered into a bond to the amount of
50Z.; and by a further payment of five guineas for
the privilege of attending the Public Lectures
of the Law Professors, and 35Z . G&\ hd. for fees
and stamp on admission, the whole business was
complete, and Frank was a student of the Honour-
able Society of the Inner Temple.
A little pleasant chaff about the woolsack, and
the quartet broke up, the two sureties to their
respective businesses, Frank and his father to
lunch. Then Mr. Ross took a cab to Paddington,
leaving Frank at the door of Maskelyne and
Cooke's mysterious entertainment, where he pro-
posed a little mild dissipation till it was time to
go down to the Temple to dine.

newspaper-boy8 at the lodge just before six
o'clock, he met three friends, and the usual ex-
pressions of mutual surprise were uttered. They
agreed to make up a mess together, and cer-
tainly would not have accepted the definition of a
mess as "a party of four who eye each other
with feelings of mutual distrust and suspicion."
Frank, as freshman, had to " stand" the orthodox
bottle of wine, and felt quite like an old fogey as
he "took wine" with the three. With the ex-
ception of wine, and the power of sending for
various sorts of liquors, the dinner was very much
the same as the usual dinner in Hall at Oxford.
The servants were better dressed, but waited
worse. There was more order, from the fact that
everybody has to be present at grace before and
after meat, failing which, the dinner does not
count. Then the diversity of age and style of
men struck Frank. Old men and beardless boys
sitting side by side, wearing the student's gown;
mild-looking students with pale faces and specta-
cles: fast men, in whom the notion of study
seemed a ridiculous anomaly; dark faces from
the East; and even a few of the thick lips from
Africa. All the rest—the Benchers at the high

table, the portraits overhead, the coloured
windows, the fretted roof, the carved panelling—
it was all familiar; Oxford over again, simply
transplanted to the very heart of London.
After dinner they went to a theatre, and after
that Frank was initiated into the mysteries of
Evans's.
The three evenings passed all too quickly, and
ho was once more in Oxford, with the sense of
having at least made one distinct step towards
winning Rose, even though it was such a
matter-of-fact affair as the eating of three
dinners.
There was not much to mark the succeeding
Lent Term. There were the " Torpids " as usual,
in which Frank again rowed, and with such de-
cided improvement that he was considered safe
for the " Eight" in the summer term. There was
the ordinary scarlet-fever scare; a suicide of a
studious undergraduate, the annual result of the
climate, and the Lenten depression of the social
atmosphere; and there were the Christ-Church
Grinds,1 and the Brasenose Ale Festival on Shrove
Tuesday.

## p. 136 (#144) ############################################

136
Oxford Days.
To the former Frank went, surreptitiously of
course, for the Grinds are with annual regularity
forbidden, but with equal regularity carried out.
The Proctors for the time being were not over-
sharp, and imagined that the simplest and easiest
way to catch the men coming home from Ayles-
bury was to go to the station and meet the in-
trains. But, strange to relate, not a single un-
dergraduate was to be found! Innocently con-
fessing his failure on the following evening in
Common Room, the Senior Proctor drew upon
himself the ridicule of one of the older fellows, a
sporting man, and the "inextinguishable laugh-
ter " of the rest.
"You don't mean to say you expected to find
them at the station? Why, man alive! what is
easier than to tip the guard and engine-driver
half-a-sovereign, and have the train stopped just
by the Goods-station?"
The Senior Proctor mentally resolved to be
sharper in future. He was sharper—when he
caught men. But his sharpness was the sharpness
of acidity and not of acuteness.
The Brasenose Ale Festival is simply ordinary
dinner in Hall, at which some special ale, brewed

by the College and kept for high occasions, is
given in unlimited quantities to the undergradu-
ates. Possibly the most important feature (cer-
tainly it is the most uncommon) is the fact of
the ale being given. Anything not paid for is a
fact so rare that of itself it deserves a festival
to commemorate it. The ale is celebrated in a
poem which is supposed to be written by the
College Butler. College Butlers being, however,
not necessarily gifted with the poetic faculty, the
honour or duty is deputed to some undergraduate.
The merits of the verses vary, apparently with
the quality of the ale, which is sometimes good,
often bad, and usually indifferent. In a collection
of the productions of the laureates of the barrel,
lately published, are verses by Bishop Heber, by
Garbett, once Professor of Poetry, and others of
less reputation. The various later authors maybe
found in country rectories, doubtless endeavour-
ing on temperance principles to counteract the
effects of the obnoxious liquor, which in the days
of their youth they celebrated in such festive
fashion.
The College bounty did not stop short, however,
at ale; cakes of ample proportions were cut up

and distributed. But when all rose to bless the
indirect giver, and the direct benefactor, it must
of course have been indigestion or malicious
scepticism which made Frank's host whisper to
him,-
“I wonder what the difference is between the
pecuniary value of the bequest, when it was made
to the College, and its present value.”
Frank, not being able to hazard a conjecture,
made the most apposite remark his state of igno-
rance allowed, -
“You'd better ask the Bursar."

CHAPTER IX.
THE CLOSE.
Frank read with Edwards in the Summer term,
the College again paying half the fee. He rowed
in the Eights, and Paul's made four bumps, there-
by getting head of the river. To commemorate the
event a "bump-supper" was given. All the men,
with the exception of a very few, subscribed the
necessary guinea, and, as many brought guests,
the supper was emphatically a success. The ex-
ceptions were of the three ordinary types: those
who could not afford a guinea for such a purpose,
and who were not ashamed to say so; those who
considered " bump-suppers" and such-like enter-
tainments as immoral orgies; and lastly, those who
both enjoyed them and who could afford to sub-
scribe, but who were too mean to do so, and
preferred rather to extract an invitation to another
college bump-supper in the specious manner which

usually characterizes the tight-fingered. The
Dons readily gave permission for the use of the
hall, with certain provisos as to time of termina-
tion of the feast. Cooks and scouts vied with one
another, in a spirit not altogether disinterested,
in supplying and laying out the best that the
College kitchen could provide. A gorgeous
dessert was ordered from a neighbouring con-
fectioner, and wine came in without stint or stay.
Slap's1 excellent band was engaged, and dis-
coursed most sweet music from time to time
during the evening. And then, what speeches
were made! What songs were sung! How
they all cheered when the captain of the boat-club
returned thanks! And—tell it not in the Common
Room, whisper it not to the Dons (for the very
simple reason that they know by experience what
it all means)—what aching eyes, what cracking
heads, what foul and furry tongues there were
next morning! Nor did the store of College
legends fail to receive the additions usual on such
occasions; and one story even reached the
Master's ears: how that the captain of the boat-

club was observed, long after the last guest had
passed the porter's lodge, sitting in a corner of
one of the back quadrangles, rowing with all his
might at an imaginary oar, shouting every now
and then to "bow " to keep time, and telling the
"cox" not to put the rudder on so sharp.
Frank did not stay up for Commemoration;
that he reserved as a pleasure for the following
year. His final examination would then be over,
and he would be able to enjoy all the fun
and gaiety in his new glory as Bachelor of
Arts. Before going down he had a consultation
with Edwards as to his work in the "Long."
The latter was again going to take a reading
party abroad, but he advised Frank not to join;
he told him that in his present state of progress
he could do more work at home. Frank was
relieved by the advice, for he knew his father
could not afford to send him abroad again. But
he felt he might close with Edwards' proposal to
come up a month before the Michaelmas Term
began, chiefly for the purpose of making his work
safe for the first Bar Examination in Roman Law,
which was fixed for the end of October. Edwards
wished him to go in for this on his first oppor-

tunity; for ho felt that, apart from the direct
advantage in passing, the examination would
prove of service as a partial test for- the final
Oxford Examination in the ensuing summer.
Mr. Eoss was not only satisfied hut pleased with
tlie scheme for Frank's work. He was a man
who always looked ahead and tried to map out the
future. He felt that men for the most part create
their own future, and that where the object in
view is clearly marked out, and the means to that
object carefully weighed and chosen with firm
determination, chance is but a trifling factor in
a man's career. He loathed that comfortable
philosophy which folds its hands and leaves
"Time and the hour" to work for one. So far
his plans had been fulfilled; and if this had
made him somewhat dogmatic and obstinately
fond of insisting that " anything can be done if
only there is the will to do it," it had, at all events,
taught his children tho lesson of dogged per-
severance and the value of far-sightedness.
Frank spent a pleasant" Long " vacation. He
had plenty of cricket and boating; he saw Eose
b± least three times every week. There were
-endless picnics and lawn-tennis parties. Above

all, ho got through a good deal of reading. During
the three months ho was at home ho worked,
on an average, five hours everyday; but by
judiciously arranging these he always found
plenty of time for amusements. Ho bathed in
tlie river, wet or fine, every morning at seven;
read from eight till nine; breakfasted at nine;
read from ten till one. By this plan he always had
done four hours' work before luncheon; and ho
bad no difficulty in keeping up his average number
by regulating the rest of his work according to
the general plans for the day's amusements..
The month's reading in Oxford during the
'' Long " was, of course, a novelty, but he did not
find the dulness ho expected. He saw a good
deal more of Edwards than in his tutorial capacity,
and soon made great friends with his wife; and
as young men are at a premium in Oxford out of
term, his social vanity was flattered by numerous
invitations.
Towards the latter part of October he weut to
town for the Bar Examination. He put up at the
Inns of Court Hotel, to be near Lincoln's Inn, in
the Hall of which he duly appeared one Saturday
morning at ten o'clock. He saw plenty of familiar

faces and several friends. One of the examiners
also was an Oxford professor. The paper—there
only was one—was not difficult, and Frank had
very nearly finished when, just on the stroke of
twelve o'clock, he was called up for vivd voce.
The plan struck him as strange; and as he was
kept waiting for at least twenty minutes, he en-
vied the other candidates who were still writing
or looking over their papers. His vivd voce, how-
ever, did not last very long, and he had ample
time to correct his work carefully. Within a
week he received the pleasant news that he had
passed, and went up in November to eat his
dinners, with a certain amount of pride at having
achieved one more distinct step towards his
desired end.
Not long after this, Crawford, who had taken a
"first" in the summer, gained a Fellowship at
Queen's; and by an odd coincidence, another
of his friends, Monkton, was sent down about
the same time. His rustication after the esca-
pade in the theatre had apparently failed to in-
spire him with any awe of the University autho-
rities, and he had scorned the notion of the Proc-
tors being able to track or catch him in any of

his favourite haunts, till one night he received
palpable and painful evidence to the contrary.
The matter was promptly settled. He was
summoned before the Vice-Chancellor and the
Proctors privately; his previous offence was
proved against him; a bad report came from his
own college authorities; his name was removed
from the books, and he was told to leave Oxford
at once. The remainder of his history is neither
poetic nor uncommon. He disappeared from the
surface for a season, only to rise, however, on the
tide of a theological college. Thence, having
easily satisfied a bishop—for he was by no means
a fool—he was ordained, and, having passed a few
years as junior curate, was promoted to be his
vicar's vicegerent, and glided into a more com-
fortable, decent existence, much invited and much
beslippered by the ladies of his congregation.
The spring soon passed away, and with the end
of May all the examinations began.
Frank felt far more nervous when he appeared
in the Schools for Divinity than subsequently for
Law. Failure in the former would prevent him
from taking his degree that term; and failure was
quite possible even to one who had a very good

general knowledge of the matter and teaching of
the Bible. It is not easy to see what good is
effected by an examination which induces cram-
ming, irreverence, and a cordial dislike of its
subject. It certainly furnishes an inexhaustible
store of amusing stories.

"It is a mountain in Syria."
"Who was Mary Magdalene?"

Jews and Samaritans from the earliest periods."
"The Jews had no dealings with the Samari-

these; hence the expression ' Make broad your
phylacteries/ means, "Extend your business.1"

"Because Peter had cut off his servant's ear."
"Who was Malchus?"
"He was the high priest's servant whose ear
Peter cut off, and supposed to be the author of a

Prank contributed one to the stock of blunders.
Given the Greek words and asked to explain the
context of " The thorns sprang up and choked
it,"he translated them,"The thieves sprang up and
choked him and proceeded to give an elaborate
description of the parable of the Good Samaritan.
He did not, however, end in the legendary man-
ner: "He took out two pence and gave them to
the host, saying, 'Whatsoever thou spendest
more, when I come again I will repay thee/ This
he said, well knowing he should see his face no
more."
He answered the rest of the paper, as he
thought, fairly; and, from the short viva voce he
had a few days later, inferred that the written
part of his work was better than he imagined;
and two hours afterwards received in exchange
for the customary shilling the much-coveted piece
of bluo paper from the patient Parker, clerk of
the schools. A few days elapsed, and then he

went in for Law. Wo need not follow him through
all the details. As so often happens, ho did
better than he expected in the subjects he feared
most, and worse in those he fancied he should
do better. But on the whole he was satisfied with
his performance. In viva voce he considerably
improved his position, and to this he attributed
the fact that when the class-list appeared he found
himself in the second instead of the third class.
A first he had never expected to get; but
Edwards learnt from the examiners that he was
considered a good second-class man, having amply
retrieved in viva voce the failure in one of his
papers which had threatened to lower him to the
third.

CHAPTER X.
GOWN AT LAST.
So now it was all over—all the work and
anxiety. - The taking of his degree remained,
and—Commemoration. It was Thursday when
the class-list appeared. The following Sunday
was Show Sunday, the semi-official commence-
ment of the festivities. He telegraphed to his
father: "Have got a second. You must come
up for Commem. I hope to put on my gown on
Thursday." He telegraphed to Rose. He wrote
a long letter to his mother by that night's post,
begging her to bring one of his sisters and Rose.
He wrote to Rose herself. He was in a whirl of
excitement, and to conceal his emotion he ordered
an elegant summer suit, which he did not in the
least require, at a most obliging tailor's not a
hundred yards from St. Mary's Church. So
obliging was he, in fact, that it is matter of history

that when a certain wealthy and aristocratic Irish-
man, in a flow of unbounded extravagance, or-
dered him to " send in his whole shop," the tailor,
with undisturbed equanimity, replied, " Certainly,
sir! What time would you like it?"
The receipt of Frank's letter, and the request
that his mother would bring Rose, produced a
little commotion. His father still tried to pooh-
pooh the notion of an engagement; but his mother,
who had Frank's confidence, maintained that, as
far as the two were concerned, the engagement
was a reality, and that it only waited the formal
consent of the parents and the means to marry.
So it was at last decided that Mr. and Mrs. Ross,
and Frank's elder sister, Mary, would go. The
Vicar, glad of an excuse to visit Oxford again,
agreed to join the party and bring Rose. And
Rose herself—well, there was no need to ask her
consent. On Friday morning a telegram was
despatched to Frank, telling him they were coming
on Saturday evening, and giving him directions
to secure lodgings; and Mary and Rose were to-
gether most of the day and evening, arranging,
selecting, altering, and making various articles of
adornment for the coming gaieties.

Pembroke concert had taken place on Thurs-
day, Queen's on Friday, and there was nothing
for Saturday. But that was no loss to Frank's
party, for they were all too tired for any gaiety
after their long journey. By a fluke—for he
was late in looking for lodgings—he found some
disengaged rooms in Grove Street; and the
shady little corner, so close to the sunny, busy
High, was most pleasant and convenient. After
supper the Vicar went down to Christ-Church
to "look up " some old friends, still in residence
as Senior Students,1 and the rest strolled by Mer-
ton to the river. Mr. and Mrs. Boss, not caring
to trust themselves to the boat which Frank had
chosen, wandered round the paths by the Cher-
well, and, after losing themselves by the Botani-
cal Gardens, eventually got safe to Grove Street.
Frank rowed Rose and Mary down to Sandford,
where he gave them tea in the little inn overlook-
ing the lock, and then took them round to see the
lasher that has been so fatal to many bright
young lives.
Coming home, he pointed out to them all the

spots of interest and importance to tho rowing
man. The tavern at Iffley where the last of the
Eights starts in the races; the Green Barge, at
the entrance to the " Gut;" the Gut itself, that
tenor of young coxswains; the Long Bridges;
the White Willow where the boats make their final
crossing to the Berkshire bank on the journey
home. Every spot had its little history. Here,
in the first Torpids, he had nearly "caught a
crab." There his crew had made their final
"spirt;" here they had bumped Brasenose, when
the coxswain would not acknowledge the bump.
There "bow" broke his oar, and nearly pitched
out of the boat. Yonder, strolling quietly down
the Berkshire bank, was Harvey, the Humane
Society's man. There was old George West on
the Brasenose barge; there, just above, was
Titnms, the "Father of the Crews," leading a
quiet time of it, now that the " Eights " and the
"Sculls" and "Pairs "2 were over. Frank took
the girls into the 'Varsity barge, and showed
them the pictures of the old "oars," who had
rowed for Oxford at Henley and Putney; and told
them what little legends had come down to him

of Chitty and Meade-King, Arkell and Warre,
Morrison and Woodgate; and, coming to later
times, of Tinney, Willan, Yarborough, and Dar-
bishire, the famous four who, besides their glories
at Putney, licked the Yankees from Harvard;
and, in later times still, of Leslie and Houblon,
Edwards-Moss and Marriott. They were all heroes
to Frank—these "brutal rowing men," as Mr.
Wilkie Collins deems them—these savages whose
only glory is their brute strength. It has been said
that English battles have been won in the Eton
playing-fields. Possibly the Isis and the Cam
have as much as anything to do with the feats of
dogged endurance and quiet pluck that have made
Alma and Inkerman, Isandula and Eorke's Drift,
immortal names in the annals of warfare.
On Sunday they all went to St. Mary's. The
Vicar's gown admitted the ladies to the seats
appropriated to the wives of the Masters of Arts,
and Mr. Ross to the seats of the Masters them-
selves. Frank, being still do jure an under-
graduate, had to retire to the upstair gallery.
The church was crowded. People were even
standing in the aisles. The sermon, by a silver-
haired-professor with a cherubic face, was a dis-

course on friendship, delivered, if somewhat
monotonously, with a delicate utterance and in a
delicate phraseology that was quite too charm-
ing; and if it formed a rather strange contrast
to the anathemas thundered by rural Boanerges
to placid congregations in 'sweltering country
churches, the contrast was a pleasing one rather
than otherwise.
"Well," said Mr. Ross as they emerged into the
High, "that's an odd sort of sermon, eh, Vicar?"
Mr. Ross was a very sound lawyer, but he had
not travelled much, nor had he heard many
sermons other than those of his friend the Vicar.
The Vicar smiled, and continued his explanations
to Mrs. Ross of certain allusions to Oxford
celebrities made by the preacher. Frank also, to
whom his father appealed, had only a common-
place comment to make. His studies not having
been philosophical, he could not go into raptures
over every utterance of the new Plato.
The church was even more crowded, if that
were possible, in the afternoon, in spite of the
awkwardness of the hour (two o'clock) and the
heat of the day. And what an assemblage of
famous men was present! Gladstone and

Tyndall, Lord Selborne and Huxley, Forster and
Sir Stafford Northcote, Sir William Haroourt
and the Oxford Conservative member, all sitting
amicably side by side, listening to one of those
eloquent attacks on men of science which satisfy
and please those for whom they are not needed,
and only amuse those whom they are intended to
convince.
After the sermon the Vicar and Mr. Ross
betook themselves to the Union, to read the
papers over a cup of coffee; and about a quarter
to five Frank started with his mother, sister, and
Rose, to Magdalen Chapel. Tickets had been,
of course, difficult to get, and with all his exertions
he had only been able to securo two for the choir,
and two for the ante-chapel. The two former
Mrs. Ross and Mary took, without any resistance,
for they knew that Rose would be happier to be
with Frank. How many husbands and wives
come back in after-years to Oxford, to go over
again all the old days, to revisit all the old spots,
to find one particular tree the same, save, like
themselves, a little older; to sit in the same
chapel, and listen perhaps to the very same
anthem they had listened to when they were boy

and girl, sung by different voices, but for them
the same; to pass the same surly porter, whoso
favour can only be purchased; to see the same
placid gardener tidying up the velvet grass under
the grey walls; to hear the same bells ringing;
and, with it all, to feel as young as ever!
Frank and Rose, as they sat in the dim ante-
chapel, under the great brown window that sheds
such a strange light over all, thought neither of
the past, for that was eclipsed, nor of the future,
for that was uncertain, but just lived in the pre-
sent. And if he did hold her hand during most
of the service, nobody saw him, and therefore
nobody's feelings were outraged.
Another happy pair emerged from another dim
corner of the ante-chapel, when the service was
over—Crawford and the little lady, who doubt-
less has not been forgotten, best known by the
title "Blue-eyes." She, too, had in attendance
on her a mother and sister; and they, too, had
been sitting in the choir. So that altogether,
when the introductions took place in the cloisters,
all mentally agreed that the party was a most
symmetrical one—two mothers, two sisters, and
two pairs of lovers.

157
After dinner at their respective lodgings the
two parties met in Grove Street, and went to the
Broad Walk to sec and contribute to the show of
visitors. The Vicar pronounced a melancholy
eulogium on the glories of past Show Sundays,
from which the present was a sad falling-off,
caused chiefly as he explained by the indiscrimi-
nate admission of the " Town," and the consequent
absence of the "Gown" clement. His hearers,
however, having no historic past with which to
contrast the present, though they listened sub-
missively to his diatribes, enjoyed themselves
immensely, stared at everybody, wondered, and
questioned.
All the morning of Monday, Frank was engaged
at a committee meeting of the Masonic Fete, of
which he was a steward: and as he and one or two
others were decidedly opposed to the general plan
of disposal of tickets, the meetings were not so
peaceable as hitherto; he used to return hot,
tired, and annoyed. But Rose's presence soon
restored him to his wonted equanimity.
On Monday afternoon there was a concert given
by the Philharmonic Society in the Sheldonian
Theatre, and after a hurried tea he took his

party to the river to see the procession of boats.
He had tickets for them for the 'Varsity barge,
and having got them good seats at the lower cor-
ner, next to the Brasenose barge, hurried off to
his own barge to put on his boating clothes. To
Rose and Mary, who had never seen any river-
boat except the " tubs" at Porchester, the long
slender craft -were objects of much wonder,
and they thoroughly enjoyed the sight of tho
many " Eights " and "Torpids" rowing up and
saluting Paul's, the head boat, which lay close
under the 'Varsity barge. The cox—a facetious
young gentleman—could not resist the pleasure
of shouting every few minutes, "Eyes in the
boat!" as he caught the eyes of his crew wander-
ing to the many fair faces that were looking down
at them from beneath the awning.
One by one the boats rowed up—it is to be
feared not in the best style, for the crews were
for the most part mere " scratch" affairs got to-
gether hurriedly for the procession, in the absence
of the regular men who had gone down. One by
one they rowed up to the post opposite to the
'Varsity barge, "easied," and then, standing up,
raised their oars and saluted tho head boat, "Well

rowed, Paul's \" to commemorate the honour of
the May races. Rose felt quite flattered, and took
to herself half the honour at least that was being
given to Frank's boat. The proceeding repeated
by some forty boats was growing somewhat mono-
tonous, when, to the intense delight and half-
terror of the ladies, one Eight upset—on purpose,
of course; and there was much merriment over
the intentionally assumed danger and frantic
efforts to get out of the crowded water. When
all the boats had saluted, they turned at Folly
Bridge (with what difficulty coxswains know to
their cost), and dropped down the stream to their
respective barges.
Those who embark on the festivities of Com-
memoration have not much time to spend in
dreaming. Rose would fain have gone down the
river quietly in the cool of the evening; and yet
—and yet—the thoughts of dancing were perhaps
sweeter.
Back to the town streamed the crowds: some
to the Wadham concert; some to rest before
dressing for the University ball; many to sum-
mon up their strength and energy for both.
Among the latter were Mrs. Ross and Mary, Rose

and Frank. The fathers dined at Christ-Church,
and spent a cosy evening in the Common Room—
the Vicar chatting away unceasingly with old
friends, and Mr. Ross making a very pleasant and
amused listener.
It was a lovely evening, and most of the people
walked to- Wadham—one of the many things that
struck the country folks as strange and yet plea-
sant. The concert was held in the College Hall,
beautifully decorated for the purpose. After the
first part, every one adjourned to the gardens,
where refreshments were served in a large tent,
and then wandered about, enjoying the cool air till
the second part began. Frank and his party did
not return to the Hall, but went to the Corn Ex-
change, to the University ball. And what a
night they had! He and Rose forgot to count
how many times they danced together. Mary
had partners in abundance, for Frank's friends
were there in great force; and they were all long-
ing for a dance with Rose, but had chiefly to con-
sole themselves with Mary, for Frank could not
spare many dances. However, from Mary's happy
face, as they walked down the High in the sweet
early morning air, Frank inferred that the con-

161
soling process had been not unpleasant for all
parties concerned.
Tuesday morning brought the much-needed
rest, taken by some in chairs at home, by others
in punts on the river (Frank and Eose preferred
the latter). Tuesday afternoon—the flower-show-
held in the gardens of New College. A Com-
memoration flower-show is more than a flower-
show. In fact, the flowers are almost the last
thing regarded. Tuesday evening—New College
concert, always one of the best, and the Masonic
ball. Rose and Mary again in much request, but
the former too deeply engaged to Frank to be
able to spare many dances. To this ball Mr.
Ross, being a Mason, went as a matter of coarse,
and he even succeeded in enticing the Vicar.
The latter had a lurking love of vestments, but
Porchester gave him no encouragement; here,
however, seeing the aprons and scarves, and the
cloaks of the Templars, he thought he might satisfy
his love. He would be a Mason, and though un-
able to disport himself in picturesque attire to his
congregation in church, he might do so to his
heart's content to his brethren in the secrecy of
lodge-meetings, or the publicity of such a ball as

this. So strongly was he enamoured of the notion,
that over supper, in a quiet corner with Mr. and
Mrs. Ross, he asked that gentleman to propose
him for election at a lodge in a town not far from
Porchester, of which he was Worshipful Master.
Then came Wednesday, the day of Encaenia, or
Commemoration of the Founders and Benefactors.
Who that has ever been present in the crowded
Sheldonian Theatre can forget the scene? The
jostling, pushing, squeezing that begins before
ten o'clock, though the proceedings themselves
seldom begin before noon; the pause and quiet,
till the boldest undergraduate starts the ohaff;
the grave faces of the officials as they hand the
ladies to their seats, half amused, half angry,
when told by some wag in the gallery "not to
squeeze her hand;" the cheers for everybody
and everything that the occasion suggests—" the
ladies in pink," " the ladies in blue," " the ladies
who are engaged;" the groans for this statesman,
the cheers for the other, for the 'Varsity Boat
Club, the 'Varsity Eleven, the popular Proctors.
Then the chaff becomes more personal. "When
is the Vice-Chancellor coming?" "Poor old
man, he's nervous." "Has the Senior Proctor

gone to Aylesbury?" (alluding to the Christ-
Church grinds and the Senior Proctor's failure).
"Dissolvimus hanc Convocationem," uttered in
imitation of the Vice-Chancellor, and causing
much amusement among the Masters of Arts and
others familiar with the phrase. Just then a
very white-headed gentleman enters the area, and
is met with shouts of "White hat!" "Turn
him out!" For a long time the object of the
shouts is perfectly oblivious. At length he puts
on his hat, and is of course greeted with " Hats
off!" How long the uproar would have con-
tinued is hard to say, had not a huge paper fool's-
cap, with D.CtL. written on it, been let down from
the gallery. The white-headed gentleman blessed
the circumstance. The cap fluttering downwards
paused, either by accident or design, exactly
opposite one of the galleries where a Master of
Arts on duty as Proproctor for the occasion was
standing, and was waved gently within a few
feet of his face. "Put it on, sir!" now came
from all sides of the upper gallery ; and somebody
leaning from above the Vice-Chancellor's chair,
seizing the opportunity of a second's lull, said in
a sedate voice, "Admitto te ad gradum Dodoris
M 2

in jure civ Hi." All this time the intended re-
cipient of this most dubious honour was making
frantic clutches at the cap, which it is needless to
state was bobbed up and down in front of him,
while "Let him have it!" "He knows what fits
him!" greeted his indignation, which now scarcely
knew bounds. He dashed upstairs to find the
offender; but, just as his head appeared, the cap
dropped into the area, and his efforts to discover the
author of the offence were fruitless. The entry of
the Vice-Chancellor, followed by the Doctors and
Proctors and various distinguished visitors, and
the pealing of the organ, turned the thoughts of
the undergraduates, and under cover of the music
and applause the irate Proproctor beat an igno-
minious retreat. His conduct was not only un-
popular among the undergraduates, but was con-
demned by senior and junior graduates alike.
The Vice-Chancellor, having taken his seat,
opened Convocation with the usual Latin speech.
Dr. Bryce, Regius Professor of Civil Law, then
presented a number of distinguished men—
bishops, judges, statesmen, soldiers, poets, and
historians—and in introducing each alluded in
brief Latin speeches to the peculiar merits that

had called for the honorary degree of D.C.L.—
the highest honour which the University can
confer. After this the Creweian oration was
delivered by the Public Orator; but as he spoke
in an indistinct voice, and in Latin, the interest-
ing allusions he made to past and present were
scarcely even heard, much less understood. He
took the chaff hurled at him with profound good
humour, and ignoring the various injunctions to
"Speak up," and "That will do, sir—now trans-
late!" hurried bravely on, and finished amid
cheers of satisfaction. Then came the various
prize poems and essays, to none of which, except
to the Newdigate, was the slightest attention
paid. But the Newdigate, though an exception-
ally good poem, was badly read, and most of the
cheers were ironical—all sorts of absurd construc-
tions being at once fixed upon various lines.
The Masonic Fete on Wednesday afternoon
was very delightful, but they were getting tired
of the incessant gaiety; and so was the Magdalen
concert and Christ-Church ball on Wednesday
night; but they had had enough of concerts and
enough of dancing, and all their energies and
interest were centred in Thursday morning, when

Frank was to take his degree—a far impor-
tant event to Rose than the conferring of honorary
D.C.L. on all the bishops, judges, statesmen, and
soldiers put together.
It may be convenient here to enumerate
roughly Frank's expenses during his three years'
academical career. It will be remembered that
his life has been that of an ordinary undergraduate.
Its cost is therefore considerably in excess of that
of a great many. It is also considerably below the
level of comfort and luxury which in some cases
folly induces, and in others is justified by adequate
means. He came to Oxford not for intellectual
advantages only, nor for social advantages only,
but for both. He wished to be neither a spend-
thrift nor a "smug," and he has been neither.

a certificate of twelve terms' residence, Frank,
duly attired in cap and gown, white tie, and the
statutable garments "of a subfusc hue," pro-
ceeded to the Apodyterium of the Convocation
House. There he paid the University fee, and
showed to the Registrar the testamurs gained in
Moderations and the Rudiments of Faith and
Religion, and a certificate of his having been
placed in the second class in the Honour School
of Jurisprudence.
These preliminaries over, he met his party and
took them into the Convocation House. There,
having waited for half an hour, in a crowd that
made moving impossible, and speaking almost a
difficulty, the impatient spectators were informed
that Convocation was removed to the Sheldonian
Theatre, a piece of information certainly welcome,
but one which they thought might have been
given them before.
Perhaps it need not be said that four hearts at
least were filled to overflowing as Frank went up
with several other Paul's men to be presented by
the Dean to the Vice-Chancellor, and at least one
pair of bright eyes shone the brighter for the
tears that would rise up in them. And then with

what pride Frank slipped on his gown and tipped
his scout, William, the customary sovereign, and
what a happy party sat down to lunch in Paul's!
Crawford was there, the new Fellow of Queen's,
not yet grown donnish and distant; and little
Blue-eyes too was there, who had made firm
friends with Eose, with whom she talked with
pride of their two lovers.
In the evening the young people went to Nune-
ham. Rose and Mary sitting in the stem, Blue-
eyes in the bows, where she paddled in the water
like a very child; Crawford and Frank rowing.
Mary had brought her sketching-book, and when
they had had tea in the Moss Cottage, and a stroll
was proposed, nothing could induce her to accom-
pany the others. She wanted to sketch the
rustic bridge and the river, and plenty of time
she found for the purpose. For surely never were
folks so long as Rose and Frank, Blue-eyes and
Crawford, in walking through the lovely Nuneham
woods. Like the bright June leaves that hung
over them, life was young, and fresh, and bright;
sobered, not saddened, by the twilight of earnest
thoughts of the work that lay before them.
Oxford had done her best for these two sons of

hers; had not soured them; had not robbed
them of their early faith; had not taught them
to posture as the disciples of creeds as meaningless
as they are cold and dead; had not inflated them
with the notion that Oxford thought leads England
and therefore the world; had not elated them
with their academical success; but was sending
them forth full of energy and full of hope, with
the belief that life, that stern hard battle, was
beginning and not ending with the winning of a
degree.
THE END.
