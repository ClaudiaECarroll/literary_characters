MR. MIDSHIPMAN EASY.
CHAPTER I.
Which the Reader will ﬁnd very Easy to Read.
Mn. NICODEMUs Essv was a gentleman who lived down in
Hampshire; he was a married man, and in very easy circum-
stances. Most couples ﬁnd it very easy to have a family, but
not always quite so easy to maintain them. Mr. Easy was
not at all uneasy on the latter score, as he had no children;
but he was anxious to have them, as most people covet what
they cannot obtain. After ten years, Mr. Easy gave it up as
bad job. Philosophy is said to console a man under dis-
appointment, although Shakspeare asserts that it is no re-
medy for tooth-ache; so Mr. Easy turned philosopher, the
very best profession a man can take up, when he is ﬁt for
nothing else; he must be a very incapable person indeed who
cannot talk nonsense. For some time, Mr. Easy could not
decide upon what description his nonsense should consist of; at
last he ﬁxed upon the rights of man, equality, and all that;
how every person was born to inherit his share of the earth,
a right at present only admitted to a certain length; that is,
about six feet, for we all inherit our graves, and are allowed
to take possession without dispute. But no one would listen
to Mr. Easy’s philosophy. The women would not acknow-
ledge the rights of men, whom they declared always to be in
the wrong; and, as the gentlemen who visited Mr. Easy were
all men of property, they could not perceive the advantages
of sharing with those who had none. However, they allowed
him to discuss the question, while they discussed his port

wine. The wine was good, if the arguments were not, and
we must take things as we ﬁnd them in this world.
While Mr. Easy talked philosophy, Mrs. Easy played
patience, and they were a very happy couple, riding side by
side on their hobbies, and never interfering with each other.
Mr. Easy knew his wife could not understand him, and there-
fore did not expect her to listen very attentively; and Mrs.
Easy did not care how much her husband talked, provided
she was not put out in her game. Mutual forbearance will
always ensure domestic felicity.
There was another cause for their agreeing so well. Upon
any disputed question Mr. Easy invariably gave it up to Mrs.
Easy, telling her that she should have her own way — and
this pleased his wife; but, as Mr. Easy always took care,
when it came to the point, to have his way, he was pleased
as well. 1t is true that Mrs. Easy had long found out that
she did not have her own way long; but she was of an easy
disposition, and as, in nine cases out of ten, it was of very
little consequence how things were done, she was quite satis-
ﬁed with his submission during the heat of the argument.
Mr. Easy had admitted that she was right, and if like all
men he would do wrong, why, what could a poor woman do?
With a lady of such a quiet disposition, it is easy to imagine
that the domestic felicity of Mr. Easy was not easily dis-
turbed. But, as people have observed before, there is a
mutability in human affairs. It was at the ﬁnale of the
eleventh year of their marriage that Mrs. Easy at ﬁrst com-
plained that she could not enjoy her breakfast. Mrs. Easy
had her own suspicions, everybody else considered it past
doubt, all except Mr. _Easy; he little “thought, good easy
man, that his greatness was ripening;” he had decided that
to have an heir was no easy task; and it never came into his
calculations, that there could be a change in his wife’s ﬁgure.
You might have added to it, subtracted from it, divided it,
or multiplied it, but as it was a zero, the result would be al-
ways the same. Mrs. Easy also was not quite sure — she
believed it might be the case, there was no saying; it might

MR. runsmrmsn naSY. 7
be a mistake, like that of Mrs. Trunni0n’s in the novel, and,
therefore, she said nothing to her husband about the matter.
At last Mr. Easy opened his eyes, and when, upon inter-
rogating his wife, he found out the astounding truth, he
opened his eyes still wider, and then he snapped his ﬁngers
and danced, like a bear upon hot plates, with delight, there-
by proving that different causes may produce similar effects
in two instances at one and the same time. The bear dances
from pain, Mr. Easy from pleasure; and again, when we are
indifferent, or do not care for anything, we snap our ﬁngers
at it, and when we are over-joyed, and obtain what we most
care for, we also snap our ﬁngers. Two months after Mr.
Easy snapped his ﬁngers, Mrs. Easy felt no inclination to snap
h.ers, either from indiiference or pleasure. The fact was,
that Mrs. Easy’s time was come, to undergo what Shakspeare
pronounces “the pleasing punishment that women bear:,” but
rs. Easy, like the rest of her sex, declared “that all men
were liars,” and most particularly poets.
But while Mrs. Easy was suﬁering, Mr. Easy was in ec-
stasies. He laughed at pain, as all phisosophers do when it
is suffered by other people, and not by themselves.
In due course of time, Mrs. Easy presented her husband
with a ﬁne boy, whom we present to the public as our hero.
CHAPTER II.
In which Mrs. Easy, as usual, has her own way.
11- was the fourth day after Mrs. Easy’s conﬁnement that
Mr. Easy, who was sitting by her bedside in an easy chair,
commenced as follows: “I have been thinking, my dear Mrs.
Easy, about the name I shall give this child.”
“Name, Mr. Easy! why, what name should you give it but
your own?”
“Not so, my dear,” replied Mr. Easy; “they call all names
proper names, but I think that mine is not. It is the very
wont name in the calendar.”

“Why, what’s the matter with it, Mr. Easy?”
“The matter affects me as well as the boy. Nicodemus
is a long name to write at full length, and Nick is vulgar.
Besides, as there will be two Nicks, they will naturally call
my boy young Nick, and of course I shall be styled old Nick,
which will be diabolical.”
“Well, Mr. Easy, at all events then let me choose the
name.”
“That you shall, my dear, and it was with this view that
I have mentioned the subject so early.”
“I think, Mr. Easy, I will call the boy after my poor
father — his name shall be Robert.”
“Very well, my dear, if you wish it, it shall be Robert.
You shall have your own way. But I think, my dear, upon
a little consideration, you will acknowledge that there is a
decided objection.”
“An objection, Mr. Easy?”
“Yes, my dear; Robert may be very well, but you must
reﬂect upon the consequences; he is certain to be called
Bob.”
“Well, my dear, and suppose they do call him Bob?”
“I cannot hear even the supposition , my dear. You forget
the county in which we are residing, the downs covered with
sheep.”
“Why, Mr. Easy, what can sheep have to do with a Chris-
tian name?”
“There it is; women never look to consequences. My
dear, they have a great deal to do with the name of Bob. I
will appeal to any farmer in the county, if ninety~nine
shepherds’ dogs out_of one hundred are not called Bob. Now
observe, your child is out of doors somewhere in the ﬁelds or
plantations; you want and you call him. Instead of your
child, what do you ﬁnd? VVhy, a dozen curs at least, vho
come running up to you, all answering to the name of Bob,
and wagging their stumps of tails. You see, Mrs. Easy, it is
a dilemma not to be got over. You level your only son to the
brute creation by giving him a Christian name which, from

its peculiar brevity, has been monopolised by all the dogs in
the county. Any other name you please, my dear, but in
this one instance you must allow me to lay my positive
veto.”
“Well, then, let me see — but I’ll think of it, Mr. Easy;
my head aches very much just now.”
“I will think for you, my dear. What do you say to
John?”
“O no, Mr. Easy, such a common name.” .
“A proof of its popularity, my dear. It is scriptural-
we have the Apostle and the Baptist— we have a dozen Popes
who were all Johns. It is royal —we have plenty of kings
who were J ohns— and moreover, it is short, and sounds honest
and manly.”
“Yes, very true, my dear; but they will call him J aek.”
“Well, we have had several celebrated characters who
were Jacks. There was — let me see — Jack the GiantKiller,
and Jack of the Bean Stalk — and Jack — Jack ”
“Jack Spratt,” replied Mrs. Easy.
“And Jack Cade, Mrs. Easy, the great rebel—and Three-
ﬁngered Jack, Mrs. Easy, the celebrated negro — and, above
all, Jack Falstaff, ma’am, Jack Falstaﬂ"— honest Jack Fal-
staff — witty Jack Falstaff ——”
“I thought, Mr. Easy, that I was to be permitted to choose
the name.”
“Well, so you shall, my dear; I give it up to you. Do
just as you please; but depend upon it that John is the right
name. Is it not now, my dear?”
“It’s the way you always treat me, Mr.Easy; you say that
you give it up, and that I shall have my own way, but I
never do have it. I am sure that the child will be christened
John."
“Nay, my dear, it shall be just what you please. Now I
recollect it, there were several Greek emperors who were
Johns; but decide for yourself, my dear.”
“No, no,” replied Mrs. Easy, who was ill, and unable to
contend any longer, “I give it up, Mr. Easy. I know how it

will be, as it always is: you give me my own way as people
give pieces of gold to children, it’s their own money, but they
must not spend it. Pray call him John.”
“There, my dear, did not I tell you you would be of my
opinion upon reﬂection? I knew you would. I have given
you your own way, and you tell me to call him John; so now
we’re both of the same mind, and that point is settled.”
“I should like to go to sleep, Mr. Easy; I feel far from
well.”
“ You shall always do just as you like, my dear,” replied
the husband, “and have your own way in everything. It is
the greatest pleasure I have when I yield to your wishes. I
will walk in the garden. Good-bye, my dear.”
Mrs. Easy made no reply, and the philosopher quitted the
room. As may easily be imagined , on the following day the
boy was christened John.
CHAPTER III.
In which our Hero has to wait the issue of an Argument.
Tun reader may observe that, in general, all my ﬁrst
chapters are very short, and increase in length as the work
advances. I mention this as a proof of my modesty and dif-
ﬁdence. At ﬁrst, I am like a young bird just out of its mo-
ther’s nest, pluming my little feathers and taking short ﬂights.
By degrees I obtain more conﬁdence, and wing my course
over hill and dale.
It is very difﬁcult to throw any interest into a chapter on
childhood. There is the same uniformity in all children un-
til they develope. We cannot, therefore, say much relative
to Jack Easy’s earliest days; he sucked and threw up his
milk while the nurse blessed it for a pretty dear, slept, and
sucked. again. He crowed in the morning like a cock,
screamed when he was washed, stared at the candle, and
made wry faces with the wind. Six months passed in these
innocent amusements, and then he was put into shorts. But

MR. mnsrnrmsn nssv. 11
I ought here to have remarked, that Mrs. Easy did not ﬁnd
herself equal to nursing her own infant, and it was necessary
to look out for a substitute.
Now a common-place person would have been satisﬁed
with the recommendation of the medical man, who looks but
to the one thing needful, which is a sufﬁcient and wholesome
supply of nourishment for the child; but Mr. Easy was a
philosopher, and had latterly taken to craniology, and he de-
scanted very learnedly with the Doctor upon the effect of his
only son obtaining his nutriment from an unknown source.
“Who knows,” observed Mr. Easy, “but that my son may not
imbibe with his milk the very worst passions of human nature.”
“I have examined her,” replied the Doctor, “and can
safely recommend her.”
“That examination is only preliminary to one more im-
portant,” replied Mr. Easy. “I must examine her.”
“Examine who, Mr. Easy?” exclaimed his wife, who had
lain down again on the bed.
“The nurse, my dear.”
“Examine what, Mr. Easy?” continued the lady.
“Her head, my dear,” replied the husband. “I must as-
certain what her propensities are.”
“I think you had better leave her alone, Mr. Easy. She
comes this evening, and I shall question her pretty severely.
Doctor Middleton, what do you know of this young per-
son?”
“I know, madam, that she is very healthy and strong, or
I should not have selected her.”
“But is her character good?”
“Really, madam, I know little about her character; but
you can make any inquiries you please. But at the same
time I ought to observe, that if you are too particular in
that point, you will have some difﬁculty in providing your-
self.”
“Well, I shall see,” replied Mrs. Easy.
“And I shall feel,” rejoined the husband.
This parleying was interrupted by the arrival of the very

person in question, who was announced by the housemaicl,
and was ushered in. She was a handsome, ﬂorid, healthy-
looking girl, awkward and naive in her manner, and ap-
parently not over wise; there was more of the dove than of
the serpent in her composition.
Mr. Easy, who was very anxious to make his own dis-
coveries, was the ﬁrst who spoke. “Young woman, come this
way, I wish to examine your head.”
“Oh! dear me, sir, it’s quite clean, I assure you,” cried the
girl, dropping a curtsey.
Doctor Middleton, who sat between the bed and Mr. Easy’s
chair, rubbed his hands and laughed.
In the meantime, Mr. Easy had untied the string and
taken off the cap of the young woman, and was very
busy putting his ﬁngers through her hair, during which
the face of the young woman expressed fear and astonish-
ment.
“I am glad to perceive that you have a large portion of
' benevolence.”
“Yes,” replied the young woman, dropping a curtsey.
“And veneration also.”
“Thanky, sir.”
“And the organ of modesty is strongly developed.”
“Yes, sir,” replied the girl with a smile. _
“ That’s quite a new organ,” thought Dr. Middleton.
“Philo-progenitiveness very powerful.”
“If you please, sir, I don’t know what that is,” answered
Sarah with a curtsey.
“Nevertheless you have given us a practical illustration.
Mrs. Easy, I am satisﬁed. Have you any questions to ask?
But it is quite unnecessary.”
. “To be su?re I have, Mr. Easy. Pray, young woman, what
18 your name ”
“Sarah, if you please, ma’am.”
“How long have you been married?”
“Married, ma’am?”
“Yes, married.”

“If you please, ma’am, I had a misfortune, ma’am,” replied
the girl, casting down her eyes.
“What, have you not been married?”
“No, ma’am, not yet.”
“Good heavens! Dr. Middleton, what can you mean by
bringing this person here?” exclaimed Mrs. Easy. “Not a
married woman, and she has a child!”
“If you please, ma’am,” interrupted the young woman,
dropping a curtsey, “it was a very little one.”
“A very little one!” exclaimed Mrs. Easy.
“Yes, ma’am, very small indeed, and died soon. after it
was born.”
“Oh, Dr. l\liddleton!—what could you mean, Dr. Middle-
ton?”
“ My dear madam,” exclaimed the Doctor, rising from his
chair, “this is the only person that I could ﬁnd suited to the
wants of your child, and if you do not take her, I cannot an-
swer for its life. It is true, that a married woman might be
procured; but married women, who have a proper feeling,
will not desert their own children; and as Mr. Easy asserts,
and you appear to imagine, the temper and disposition of
your child may be affected by the nourishment it receives, I
thinkit more likely to be injured by the milk of a married
woman who will desert her own child for the sake of gain.
The misfortune which has happened to this young woman is
not always a proof of a bad heart, but of strong attachment,
and the overweening conﬁdence of simplicity.”
“You are correct, Doctor,” replied Mr. Easy, “and her
head proves that she is a modest young woman, with strong
religious feehng, kindness of disposition, and every other re-
quisite.” -
“The head may prove it all for what I know, Mr. Easy,
but her conduct tells another tale.”
“She is well ﬁtted for the situation, ma’am,” continued
the Doctor.
“And if you please, ma’am,” rejoined Sarah, “it was such
a little one.”


## p. 14 (#22) ##############################################

14 MR. mnsmrmsn EASY.
“Shall I try the baby, ma’am?” said the monthly nurse,
who had listened in silence. “It is fretting so, poor thing,
and has its dear little ﬁst right down its throat.”
Dr. Middleton gave the signal of assent, and in a few
seconds Master John Easy was ﬁxed to Sarah as tight as a
leech.
“Lord love it, how hungry it is! —there, there, stop it a
moment, it’s choking, poor thing!” '
Mrs. Easy, who was lying on her bed, rose up, and went
to the child. Her ﬁrst feeling was that of envy, that another
should have such a pleasure which was denied to herself; the
next, that of delight, at the satisfaction expressed by the
infant. In a few minutes the child fell back in a deep sleep.
Mrs. Easy was satisﬁed; maternal feelings conquered all
others, and Sarah was duly installed.
To make short work of it, we have said that Jack Easy in
six months was in shorts. He soon afterwards began to crawl
and show his legs; indeed, so iudecorously, that it was evident
that he had imbibed no modesty with Sarah’s milk, neither
did he appear to have gained veneration or benevolence, for
he snatched at everything, squeezed the kitten to death,
scratched his mother, and pulled his father by the hair; not-
withstanding all which, both his father and mother and the
whole household declared him to be the ﬁnest and sweetest
child in the universe. But if we were to narrate all the
wonderful events of Jack’s childhood from the time of his
birth up to the age of seven years, as chronicled by Sarah,
who continued his dry nurse after he had been weaned, it
would take at least three volumes folio. Jack was brought up
in the way that every only child usually is — that is, he was
allowed to have his own way.

CHAPTER IV.
In which the Doctor prescribes going to School as a Remedy for as Out
Finger.
“Have you no idea of putting the boy to school, Mr.
Easy?” said Dr. Middleton, who had been summoned by a
groom with his horse in a foam to attend immediately at
Forest Hill, the name of Mr. Easy’s mansion, and who, upon
his arrival had found that Master Easy had cut his thumb.
One would have thought that he had cut his head off by the
agitation pervading the whole household —Mr. Easy walk-
ing up and down very uneasy, Mrs. Easy withgreat difﬁculty
prevented from syncope, and all the maids bustling and pass-
ing round Mrs. Easy’s chair. Everybody appeared excited
except Master Jack Easy, himself who, with a rag round his
ﬁnger, and his pinafore spotted with blood, was playing at
bob-cherry, and cared nothing about the matter.
“Well, what’s the matter, my little man?” said Dr.
Middleton, on entering, addressing himself to Jack, as the
most sensible of the whole party.
“Oh, Dr. Middleton,” interrupted Mrs. Easy, “he has cut
his hand; I’m sure that a nerve is divided, and then the lock-
H
The Doctor made no reply, but examined the ﬁnger:
Jack Easy continued to play bob-cherry with his right
hand.
“Have you such a thing as a piece of sticking-plaster
in the house, madam?” observed the Doctor, after examina-
tion.
“O yes: —run, Mary, —run, Sarah!” In a few seconds
the maids appeared, Sarah bringing the sticking-plaster, and
Mary following with the scissors.
_ “Make yourself quite easy, madam,” said Dr. Middleton,
after he put on the plaster, “I will answer for no evil con-
sequences.”
“Had I not better take him up stairs, and let him lie down

a little?” replied Mrs. Easy, slipping a guinea into the Doc,
tor’s hand.
“It is not absolutely requisite, madam,” said the Doctor;
“but at all events he will be kept out of more mischief.”
“Come, my dear, you hear what Dr. Middleton says.”
“Yes, I heard,” replied Jack; “but I sha’n’t go.”
“My dear Johnny — come, love — now do, my dear
Johnny.”
Johnny played bob-cherry, and made no answer.
“Come, Master Johnny,” said Sarah.
“ Go away, Sarah,” said Johnny, with a backhander.
“Oh! ﬁe, Master Johnny,” said Mary.
“Johnny, my love,” said Mrs. Easy in a coaxing tone,
“come now — will you go?”
“I’ll go in the garden and get some more cherries,” re-
plied Master Johnny.
“Come, then, love, we will go into the garden.”
Master Johnny jumped oif his chair, and took his mamma
by the hand.
“What a dear, good, obedient child it is! ” exclaimed Mrs.
Easy; “you may lead him with a thread.”
“Yes, to pick cherries,” thought Dr. Middleton.
Mrs. Easy, and JohImy, and Sarah, and Mary, went into
the garden, leaving Dr. Middleton alone with Mr. Easy, who
had been silent during this scene. Now Dr. Middleton was
a clever, sensible man, who had no wish to impose upon any
one. As for his taking a guinea for putting on a piece of
sticking-plaster, his conscience was very easy on that score.
His time was equally valuable, whether he were employed
for something or nothing; and, moreover, he attended the
poor gratis. Constantly in the house, he had seen much of
Mr. John Easy, and perceived that he was a courageous, de-
cided boy, of a naturally good disposition; but from the idio-
syncracy of the father, and the doating folly of the mother,
in a sure way of being spoiled. As soon, therefore, as the
lady was out of hearing, he took a chair, and made the query

MR. mnsmrmau nssv. 17
at the commencement of the chapter, which we shall now re-
peat.
“Have you no idea of putting the boy to school, Mr.
Easy?”
Mr. Easy crossed his legs, and clasped his hands together
over his knees, as he always did when he was about to com-
mence an argument.
“The great objection that Ihave to sending a boy to school,
Dr. Middleton, is, that I conceive that the discipline enforced
is, not only contrary to the rights of man, but also in opposi-
tion to all sound sense and common judgment. Not content
with punishment, which is in itself erroneous, and an in-
fringement of social justice, they even degrade the minds of
the boys still more by applying punishment to the most de-
graded part, adding contumely to tyranny. Of course, it is
intended that a boy who is sent to school should gain by pre-
eept and example; but is he to learn benevolence by the angry
look and the ﬂourish of the vindictive birch, — or forbearance,
by the cruelty of the ushers, — or patience, when the masters
over him are out of all patience, — or modesty, when his
nether parts are exposed to general examination? Is he not
daily reading a lesson at variance with that equality which we
all possess, but of which we are unjustly deprived? Why
should there be a distinction between the ﬂogger and the
ﬂoggee? Are they not both fashioned alike after God’s image,
endowed with the same reason, having an equal right to
what the world oifers, and which was intended by Providence
to be equally distributed? Is it not that the sacred inheritance
of all, which has tyrannously and impiously been ravished
from the many for the beneﬁt of the few, and which ravish-
ment, from long custom of iniquity and inculcation of false
precepts, has too long been basely submitted to? Is it not
the duty of a father to preserve his only son from imbibing
these dangerous and debasing errors, which will render him
only one of a vile herd who are content to suffer, provided
that they live? And yet are not these very errors inculcated
at school, and impressed upon their mind inversely by the

birch? Do not they there receive their ﬁrst lesson in slavery
with the ﬁrst lesson in A B C; and are not their minds there-
by prostrated, so as never to rise again, but ever to bow to
despotism, to cringe to rank, to think and act by the pre-
cepts of others, and to tacitly disavow that sacred equality
_ which is our birthright? N o, sir, without they can teach with-
out resorting to such a fundamental error as ﬂogging, my
boy shall never go to school.”
And Mr. Easy threw himself back in his chair, imagining,
like all philosophers, that he had said something very clever.
Dr. Middleton knew his man, and therefore patiently
waited until he had exhausted his oratory.
“I will grant,” said the Doctor at last, “that all you say
may have great truth in it; but, Mr. Easy, do you not think
that by not permitting a boy to be educated, you allow him
to remain more open to that very error of which you speak?
It is only education which ‘will conquer prejudice, and enable
a man to break through the trammels of custom. Now, al-
lowing that the birch is used, yet it is at a period when the
young mind is so elastic as to soon become indifferent; and
after he has attained the usual rudiments of education, you
will then ﬁnd him prepared to receive those lessons which
you can yourself instil.”
“I will teach him everything myself,” replied Mr. Easy,
folding his arms eonsequentially and determinedly.
“I do not doubt your capability, Mr. Easy; but unfortu-
nately you will always have a difﬁculty which you never can
get over. Excuse me, I know what you are capable of, and
the boy would indeed be happy with such a preceptor, but —
if I must speak plain —you must be aware as well as I am,
that the maternal fondness of Mrs. Easy will always be a bar
to your intention. He is already so spoiled by her, that he
will not obey; and without obedience you cannot inculcate.”
“I grant, my dear sir, that there is a difﬁculty on that
point: but maternal weakness must then be overcome by pater-
nal severity.”
“Mayl ask how, Mr. Easy? for it appears tome impossible."

“Impossible! By heavens, I’ll make him obey, or I’ll —-”
-—- Here Mr. Easy stopped before the word ﬂog was fairly
out of his mouth, — “I’ll know the reason why, Dr. Middle-
ton.”
Dr. Middleton checked his inclination to laugh, and re-
plied, “That you would hit upon some scheme, by which you
would obtain the necessary power over him, 1 have no doubt;
but what will be the consequence? The boy will consider his
mother as a protector, and you as a tyrant. He will have an
aversion to you, and with that aversion he will never pay re-
spect and attention to your valuable precepts when he arrives
at an age_to understand them. Now it appears to me that
this difﬁculty which you have raised may be got over. I know
a very worthy clergyman who does not use the birch; but I
will write, and put the direct question to him; and then if
your boy is removed from the danger arising from Mrs. Easy’s
over-indulgence, in a short time he will be ready for your
more important tuition.”
“I think,” replied Mr. Easy, after a pause, “that what you
say merits consideration. I acknowledge that in consequence
of Mrs. Easy’s nonsensical indulgence, the boy is unruly, and
will not obey me at present; and if your friend does not apply
the rod, I will think seriously of sending my son John to
him to learn the elements.”
The Doctor had gained his point by ﬂattering the philo-
sopher.
In a day he returned with a letter from the pedagogue in
answer to one supposed to be sent to him, in which the use
of the birch was indiguantly disclaimed, and Mr. Easy an-
nounced to his wife, when they met that day at tea-time, his
intentions with regard to his son John.
“To school, Mr. Easy? what, send Johnny to school! a
mere infant to school!”
“Surely, my dear, you must be aware that at nine years
it is high time that he learnt to read.”
“Why he almost reads already, Mr. Easy; surely I can
teach him that. Does he not, Sarah?”

“Lord bless him, yes, ma’am, he was saying his letters
yesterday.”
“Oh, Mr. Easy, what can have put this in your head?
Johnny, dear, come here — tell me now what’s the letter A?
You were singing it in the garden this morning.”
“I want some sugar,” replied Johnny, stretching his
arm over the table to the sugar-basin, which was out of his
reach.
“Well, my love , you shall have a great lump if you will
tell me what’s the letter A.”
“A was an archer, and shot at a frog,” replied Johnny in
a surly tone.
“There now, Mr. Easy; and he can go through the whole
alphabet — can’t he, Sarah? ”
“That he can, the dear— can’t you, Johnny dear?”
“No,” replied Johnny.
“Yes, you can, my love; you know what’s the letter B.
Now don’t you?”
“Yes,” replied Johnny.
“There, Mr. Easy, you see what the boy knows, and how
obedient he is too. Come, Johnny dear, tell us what was B?”
“ N o, I won’t,” replied Johnny, “ I want some more sugar;”
and Johnny, who had climbed on a chair, spread himself over
the table to reach it.
“Mercy ! Sarah, pull him off -— he’ll upset the urn,”
screamed Mrs. Easy. Sarah caught hold of Johnny by the
loins to pull him back, but Johnny, resisting the interterence,
turned round on his back as he lay on the table, and kicked
Sarah in the face, just as she made another desperate grasp
at him. The rebound from the kick, given as he lay on a
smooth mahogany table, brought Johnny’s head in contact
with the urn, which was upset in the opposite direction, and,
notwithstanding a rapid movement on the part of Mr. Easy,
he received a sufﬁcient portion of boiling liquid on his legs
to scald him severely, and induce him to stamp and swear in
a very unphilosophical way. In the meantime Sarah and
Mrs. Easy had caught up Johnny, and were both holding him

rm. MIDSHIPMAN nssv. 21
at the same time, exclaiming and lamenting. The pain of the
scald, and the indifference shown towards him, were too much
for Mr. Easy’s temper to put up with. He snatched Johnny
out of their arms, and. quite forgetting his equality and rights
of man, belaboured him without mercy. Sarah ﬂew in to in-
terfere, and received a blow which not only made her see a
thousand stars, but sent her reeling on the ﬂoor. Mrs. Easy
went ofl into hysterics, and Johnny howled so as to be heard
at a quarter of a mile.
How long M. Easy would have continued it is impossible to
say; but the door opened, and Mr. Easy looked up while still
administering the punishment, and perceived Dr. Middleton
in mute astonishment. He had promised to come in to tea,
and enforce Mr. Easy’s arguments, if it were necessary; but
it certainly appeared to him, that in the argument which Mr.
Easy was then enforcing, he required no assistance. How-
ever, at the entrance of Dr. Middleton, Johnny was dropped,
and lay roaring on the ﬂoor; Sarah, too, remained where she
had been ﬂoored, Mrs. Easy had rolled on the ﬂoor, the
urn was also on the ﬂoor, and Mr. Easy, although not ﬂoored,
had not a leg to stand upon.
N ever did a medical man look in more opportunely. Mr.
Easy at ﬁrst was not certainly of that opinion, but his legs
became so painful that he soon became a convert.
Dr. Middleton, as in duty bound, ﬁrst picked up Mrs.
Easy, and laid her on the sofa. Sarah rose, picked up Johnny,
and carried him kicking and roaring out of the room; in re-
turn for which attention she received sundry bites. The foot-
man, who had announced the doctor, picked up the urn, that
being all that was in his department. Mr. Easy threw him-
self panting in agony on the other sofa, and Dr. Middleton
was excessively embarrassed how to act: be perceived that
Mr. Easy required his assistance, and that Mrs. Easy could do
without it; but how to leave a lady who was half really and
half pretendedly in hysterics, was difﬁcult; for if he attempted
to leave her, she kicked and ﬂounced, and burst out the more.
At last Dr. Middleton rang the bell, which brought the foot-

man, who summoned all the maids, who carried Mrs. Easy
up stairs, and then the Doctor was able to attend to the only
patient who really required his assistance. Mr. Easy ex-
plained the affair in few words, broken into ejaculations from
pain, as the Doctor removed his stockings. From the appli-
cations of Dr. Middleton, Mr. Easy soon obtained bodily re-
lief; but what annoyed him still more than his sealded legs,
was the Doctor having been a witness to his infringement
of the equality and rights of man. Dr. Middleton perceived
this, and he knew also how to pour balm into that wound.
“My dear Mr. Easy, I am very sorry that you have had
this accident, for which you are indebted to Mrs. Easy’s
foolish indulgence of the boy; but I am glad to perceive that
you have taken up those parental duties which are inculcated
by the Scriptures. Solomon says, ‘that he who spares the
rod, spoils the child,’ thereby implying that it is the duty of
a father to correct his children, and in a father, the so doing
does not interfere with the rights of man, or any natural
equality, for the son being a part or portion of the father, he
is only correcting his own self; and the proof of it is, that a
father, in punishing his own son, feels as much pain in so
doing as if he were himself punished. It is, therefore, no-
thing but self-discipline, which is strictly enjoined us by the
Scriptures.”
“That is exactly my opinion,” replied Mr. Easy, com-
forted at the Doctor having so logically got him out of the
scrape. “But — he shall go to school to-morrow, that I’m
determined on.”
“He will have to thank Mrs. Easy for that,” replied the
Doctor. I
“Exactly,” replied Mr. Easy. “Doctor, my legs are get-
ting very hot again.”
“Continue to bathe them with the vinegar and water, Mr.
Easy, until I send you an embrocation, which will give you
immediate relief. I will call to-morrow. By-the-bye, I_ am
to see a little patient at Mr. Bonnycastle’s:“if..it |is any-ac-
commodation, I will take your son with me.”

“It will be a great accommodation, Doctor,” replied Mr.
Easy.
“Then, my dear sir, I will just go up and see how Mrs.
Easy is, and to-morrow I will call at ten. I can wait an hour.
Good night.”
“Good night, Doctor.”
The Doctor had his game to play with Mrs. Easy. He
magniﬁed her husband’s accident — he magniﬁed his wrath,
and advised her by no means to say one word, until hewas
well and more paciﬁed. The next day he repeated this dose,
and, in spite of the ejaculations of Sarah, and the tears of
Mrs. Easy, who dared not venture to plead her cause, and the
violent resistance of Master Johnny, who appeared to have a
presentiment of what was to come, our hero was put into Dr.
Middleton’s chariot, and with the exception of one plate of
glass, which he kicked out of the window with his feet, and
for which feat, the Doctor, now that he had him all to him-
self, boxed his ears till he was nearly blind, he was, without
any further eventful occurrence, carried by the Doctor’s foot-
man into the parlour of Mr. Bonnycastle.
CHAPTER V.
Jack Easy is sent to a School at which there is no Flogging.
Mssrnn Jscx had been plumped down in a chair by the
Doctor’s servant, who, as he quitted him, ﬁrst looked at his
own hands, from which the blood was drawn in several parts,
and then at Master Jack, with his teeth closed, and lips com-
pressed, as much as to say, “If I only dared, would not I,
that’s all!” and then walked out of the room, repaired to the
carriage at the front door, when he showed his hands to the
coachman, who looked down from his box in great com-
miseration, at the same time fully sharing his fellow-servant’s
indignation. But we must repair to the parlour. Dr. Middle-
ton ran over a newspaper, while Johnny sat on the chair all
of a heap, looking like a lump of sulks, with his feet on the

upper front bar, and his knees almost up to his nose. He was
a promising pupil, Jack.
Mr. Bonnycastle made his appearance — a tall, well-built,
handsome, fair man, with a ﬁne powdered head, dressed in
solemn black, and knee buckles; his linen beautifully clean,
and with a peculiar bland expression of countenance. When
he smiled he showed a row of teeth white as ivory, and his
mild blue eye was the ne plus ultra of beneﬁcence. He was
the beau-ideal of a preceptor, and it was impossible to see
him and hear his mild pleasing voice, without wishing that
all your sons were under his protection. He was a ripe
scholar, and a good one, and at the time we speak of, had the
care of upwards of one hundred boys. He was celebrated for
turning them out well, and many of his pupils were rising
fast in the senate, as well as distinguishing themselves in the
higher professions.
Dr. Middleton, who was on intimate terms with Bonny-
castle, rose as he entered the room, and they shook hands.
Middleton then turned to where Jack sat, and pointing to
him, said, “Look there.”
Bonnycastle smiled. “I cannot say that I have had worse,
but I have almost as bad. I will apply the Promethean
torch, and soon vivify that rude mass. Come, sit down,
Middleton.”
“But,” said the Doctor, as he resumed his chair, “tell me,
Bonnycastle, how you will possibly manage to lick such a
cub into shape, when you do not resort to ﬂogging?”
“I have no opinion of ﬂogging, and therefore I do not
resort to it. The fact is, I was at Harrow myself, and was
rather a pickle. I was called up as often as most boys in the
school, and I perfectly recollect, that eventually I cared no-
thing for a ﬂogging. I had become case-hardened. It is the
least effective part that you can touch a boy upon. It leaves
nothing behind to refresh their memories.”
“I should have thought otherwise.”
“My dear Middleton, I can produce more effect by one
caning than twenty ﬂoggings. Observe, you ﬂog upon a part


## p. 25 (#33) ##############################################

mn. mnsmmsmu nssv. 25
the most quiescent; but you cane upon all parts, from the
head to the heels. Now, when once the ﬁrst sting of the-
birch is over, then a dull sensation comes over the part, and
the pain after that is nothing; whereas a good sound caning
leaves sores and bruises in every part, and on all the parts
which are required for muscular action. After a ﬂogging, a
boy may run out in the hours of recreation, and join his play-
mates as well as ever, but a good caning tells a very different
tale; he cannot move one part of his body without being re-
minded for days by the pain of the punishment he has under-
gone, and he is very careful how he is called up again.”
“My dear sir, I really had an idea that you were exces-
sively lenient,” replied Middleton, laughing; “I am glad that
I am under a mistake.”
“ Look at that cub, Doctor, sitting there more like a brute
than a reasonable being; do you imagine that I could ever
lick it into shape without strong measures? At the same time,
allow me to say, that I consider my system by far the best.
At the public schools, punishment is no check; it is so triﬂing
that it is derided; with me punishment is punishment in the
true sense of the word, and the consequence is, that it is much
more seldom resorted to.”
“You are a terrorist, Bonnycastle.”
“The two strongest impulses in our nature are fear and
love. In theory, acting upon the latter is very beautiful; but
in practice, I never found it to answer, — and for the best of
reasons, our self-love is stronger than our love for others.
Now I never yet found fear to fail, for the very same reason
that the other does, because with fear we act upon self-love,
and nothing else.”
“And yet we have many now who would introduce a
system of schooling without correction; and who maintain
that the present system is degrading.”
“There are a great many fools in this world, Doctor.”
“That reminds me of this boy’s father,” replied Dr.
Middleton; who then detailed to the pedagogue the idiosyn-

cracy of Mr. Easy, and all the circumstances attending Jack
being sent to his school.
“There is no time to be lost then, Doctor. I must con-
quer this young gentleman before his parents call to see him.
Depend upon it, in a week I will have him obedient and well
broke in.”
Dr. Middleton wished Jack good-bye, and told him to be
a good boy. Jack did not vouchsafe to answer. “Never
mind, Doctor, he will be more polished next time you call
here, depend upon it.” And the Doctor departed.
Although Mr. Bonnycastle was severe, he was very judi-
cious. Mischief of all kinds was visited but by slender punish-
ment, such as being kept in at play hours, &c.; and he sel-
dom interfered with the boys for ﬁghting, although he
checked decided oppression. The great ‘sine qua non’ with
him was attention to their studies. He soon discovered the
capabilities of his pupils, and he forced them accordingly;
but the idle boy, the bird who “could sing and wou’dn’t
sing,” received no mercy. The consequence was, that he
turned out the cleverest boys, and his conduct was so uniform
and unvarying in its tenor, that if he was feared when they
were under his control, he was invariably liked by those
whom he had instructed, and they continued his friends in
after life.
Mrs. Bonnycastle at once perceived that it was no use
coaxing our hero, and that fear was the only attribute by
which he could be controlled. So, as soon as Dr. Middleton
had quitted the room, he addressed him in a commanding
tone, “Now, boy, what is your name?”
Jack started; he looked up at his master, perceived his
eye ﬁxed upon him, and a countenance not to be played with.
Jack was no fool, and somehow or another, the discipline he
had received from his father had given him some intimation
of what was to come_ All this put together induced Jack to
condescend to answer, with his fore-ﬁnger between his teeth,
" Johnny.”
“And what is your other name, sir?”


## p. 27 (#35) ##############################################

MR. mnsmrmsn msv. 27
Jack, who appeared to repent his condescension, did not
at ﬁrst answer, but he looked again in Mr. Bonnycastle’s face,
and then round the room: there was no one to help him, and
he could not help himself, so he replied “Easy.”
“Do you know why you are sent to school?”
“ Scalding father.”
“No; you are sent to learn to read and write.”
“But I won’t read and write,” replied Jack sulkily.
“Yes, you will; and you are going to read your letters
now directly.”
Jack made no answer. Mr. Bonnycastle opened a sort of
book-case, and displayed to John’s astonished view a series
of canes, ranged up and down like billiard cues, and con-
tinued, “Do you know what those are for?”
Jack eyed them wistfully; he had some faint idea that he
was sure to be better acquainted with them, but he made no
answer.
“They are to teach little boys to read and write, and
now I am going to teach you. You’ll soon learn. Look now
here,” continued Mr. Bonnycastle, opening a book with large
type, and taking a capital at the head of a chapter, about
half‘ an inch long. “Do you see that letter?”
“Yes,” replied Johnny, turning his eyes away, and pick-
ing his ﬁngers.
“Well, that is the letter B. Do you see it? look at it, so
that you may know it again. That’s the letter B. Now tell
me what letter that is?” ,
Jack now determined to resist, so he made no answer.
“So you cannot tell; well, then, we will try what one of
these little fellows will do,” said Mr. Bonnycastle, taking
down a cane. “Observe, Johnny, that’s the letter B. Now,
what letter is that? Answer me directly.”
“I won’t learn to read and write.”
Whack came the cane on Johnny’s shoulders, who burst
out into a roar as he writhed with pain.
Mr. Bonnyeastle waited a few seconds. “That’s the letter
B. Now tell me, sir, directly, what that letter is?”


## p. 28 (#36) ##############################################

28 MR. MIDSHIPMAN EASY.
“I’ll tell my mar.” Whack! “O law! 0 law!”
“What letter is that?”
Johnny, with his mouth open, panting, and the tears on
his cheeks , answered indignantly, “Stop till I tell Sarah.”
Whack came the cane again, and a fresh burst from
Johnny. '
“ What letters that?”
“I won’t tell,” roared Johnny; “I won’t tell — that I
won’t.”
Whack — whack -— whack, and a pause. “I told you be-
fore, that’s the letter B. What letter is that? Tell me
directly.”
Johnny, by way of reply, made a snatch at the cane.
Whack — he caught it, certainly, but not exactly as he would
have wished. Johnny then snatched up the book, and dashed
it to the corner of the room. Whack, whack. Johnny at-
tempted to seize Mr. Bonnycastle with his teeth. Whack,
whack, whack, whack; and Johnny fell on the carpet, and
reared with pain. Mr. Bonnycastle then left him for a little
while, to recover himself, and sat down.
At last Johnny’s exclamations settled down in deep sobs,
and then Mr. Bonnycastle said to him, “Now, Johnny, you
perceive that you must do as you are bid, or else you will
have more beating. Get up immediately. Do you hear, sir?”
Somehow or another, Johnny, without intending it, stood
upon his feet.
“That’s a good boy; now you see, by getting up as you
were bid, you have not been beaten. Now, Johnny, you must
go and bring the book from where you threw it down. Do
you hear, sir? bring it directly!”
Johnny looked at Mr. Bonnycastle and the cane. With
every intention to refuse, Johnny picked up the book and
laid it on the table.
“ That’s a good boy; now we will ﬁnd the letter B. Here
it is: now Johnny, tell me what that letter is?”
Johnny made no answer.
“Tell me directly, sir,” said Mr. Bonnycastle, raising his

rm. mnsrrrrmnn nssv. 29
cane up in the air. The appeal was too powerful. Johnny
eyed the cane; it moved, it was coming. Breathlessly he
shrieked out, “B!”
“Very well indeed, Johnny — very well. Now your ﬁrst
lesson is*over, and you shall go to bed. You have learnt
more than you think for. To-morrow we will begin again.
Now‘ we’ll put the cane by.”
Mr. Bonnycastle rang the bell, and desired Master Johnny
to be put to bed, in a room by himself, and not to give him
any supper, as hunger would, the next morning, much fa-
cilitate his studies. Pain and hunger alone will tame brutes,
and the same remedy must be applied to conquer those pas-
sions in man which assimilate him with brutcs. J ohnny was
conducted to bed, although it was but six o’clock. He was
not only in pain, but his ideas were confused; and no wonder,
after all his life having been humoured and indulged — never
punished until the day before. After all the caresses of his
mother and Sarah, which he never knew the value of — after
stufﬁng himself all day long, and being tempted to eat till he
turned away in satiety, to ﬁnd himself without his mother,
without Sarah, without supper — covered with wheels, and,
what was worse than all, without his own way. No wonder
Johnny was confused; at the same time that he was subdued;
and, as Mr. Bonnycastle had truly told him, he had learnt
more than he had any idea of. And what would Mrs. Easy
have said, had she known all this — and Sarah too? And Mr.
Easy, with his rights of man? At the very time that Johnny
was having the devil driven out of him, they were consoling
themselves with the idea, that, at all events, there was no
birch used at Mr. Bonnycastle’s, quite losing sight of the fact,
that as there are more ways of killing a dog besides hanging
him, so are there more ways of teaching than a posteriori.
Happy in their ignorance, they all went fast asleep, little
dreaming that Johnny was already so far advanced in know-
ledge, as to have a tolerable comprehension of the mystery
of cane. As for Johnny, he had cried himself to sleep, at
least six hours before them.

CHAPTER VI.
In whrch Jack makes Essay of his Father’s sublime Philosophy, and arrives
very near to Truth at last.
Tun next morning Master Jack Easy was not only very
sore but very hungry, and as Mr. Bonnycastle informed him
that he would not only have plenty of cane, but also no break-
fast, if he did not learn his letters, Johnny had wisdom
enough to say the whole alphabet, for which he received a
great deal of praise, the which, if he did not duly appreciate,
he at all events inﬁnitely preferred to beating. Mr. Bonny-
castle perceived that he had conquered the boy by one hour’s
well-timed severity. He therefore handed him over to the
ushers in the school, and as they were equally empowered to
administer the needful impulse, Johnny very soon became a
very tractable boy.
It may be imagined that the absence of Johnny was
severely felt at home, but such was not the case. In the ﬁrst
place, Dr. Middleton had pointed out to Mrs. Easy that there
was no ﬂogging at the school, and that the punishment re-
ceived by Johnny from his father would very likely be
repeated — and in the next, although Mrs. Easy thought that
she never could have survived the parting with her own son,
she soon found out that she was much happier without him.
A spoilt child is always a source of anxiety and worry, and
after Johnny’s departure Mrs. Easy found a quiet and repose
much more suited to her disposition. Gradually she weaned
herself from him, and, satisﬁed with seeing him occasionally,
and hearing the reports of Dr. Middleton, she, at last, was
quite reconciled to his being at school, and not coming back
except during the holidays. John Easy made great progress;
he had good natural abilities, and Mr. Easy rubbed his hands
when he saw the doctor, saying, “Yes, let them have him for
a year or two longer, and then I’ll ﬁnish him myself.” Each
vacation he had attempted to instil into Johnny-’s mind the
equal rights of man. Johnny appeared to pay but little at-

rm. mnsnrrmsu mixev. 31
tention to his fathers discourses, but evidently showed that
they were not altogether thrown away, as he helped himself
to everything he wanted, without asking leave. And thus
was our hero educated until he arrived at the age of sixteen,
when he was a stout, good-looking boy, with plenty to say
for himself,—indeed, when it suited his purpose, he could
out-talk his father.
Nothing pleased‘ Mr. Easy so much as Jack’s loquacity.
“ That’s right; argue the point, Jack — argue the point, boy,”
would he say, as Jack disputed with his mother. And then
he would turn to the Doctor, rubbing his hands, and observe,
“Depend upon it, Jack will be a great, a very great man.”
And then he would call Jack and give him a guinea for his
cleverness; and at last Jack thought it a very clever thing to
argue. He never would attempt to argue with Mr. Bonny-
castle, because he was aware that Mr. Bonnycastle’s argu-
ments were too strong for him, but he argued with all the
boys until it ended in a ﬁght, which decided the point; and
he sometimes argued with the ushers. In short, at the time
we now speak of, which was at the breaking up of the
Midsummer holidays, Jack was as full of argument as he was
fond of it. He would argue the point to the point of a needle,-
and he would divide that point into as many as there were
days of the year, and argue upon each. In short, there was
no end to Jack’s arguing the point, although there seldom
was point to his argument.
Jack had been ﬁshing in the river, without any success,
for a whole morning, and observed a large pond which had
the appearance of being well stocked — he cleared the park
palings, and threw in his line. He had pulled up several ﬁne
ﬁsh, when he was accosted by the proprietor, accompanied
by a couple of keepers.
“May I request the pleasure of your name, young gentle-
man?” said the proprietor to Jack.
Now Jack-was always urbane and polite.
“Certainly, sir; my name is Easy, very much at your
service.”

“And you appear to me to be taking it very easy,” replied
the gentleman. “Pray, sir, may I inquire whether you are
aware that you are trespassing?”
“The word trespass, my dear sir,” replied Jack, “will
admit of much argument, and I will divide it into three heads.
It implies, according to the conventional meaning, coming
without permission upon the land or property of another.
Now, sir, the question may all be resolved in the following.
Was not the world made for all? and has any one, or any
portion of its inhabitants, an exclusive right to claim any part
of it, as his property? If you please, I have laid down the
proposition, and we will now argue the point.”
The gentleman who accosted J aek had heard of Mr. Easy,
and his arguments; he was a humourist, and more inclined to
laugh than to be angry; at the same time that he considered
it necessary to show Jack that under existing circumstances
they were not tenable.‘
“But, Mr. Easy, allowing the trespass on the property to
be venal, surely you do not mean to say that you are justiﬁed
in taking my ﬁsh; I bought the ﬁsh, and stocked the pond,
and have fed them ever since. You cannot deny but that they
are private property, and that to take them is a theft?”
“That will again admit of much ratiocination, my dear
sir,” replied Jack; “but, — I beg your pardon, I have a
ﬁsh.” Jack pulled up a large carp , much to the indignation
of the keepers and to the amusement of their master, un~
hooked it, placed it in his basket, renewed his bait with the
greatest sang froid, and then throwing in his line, resumed
his discourse. “As I was observing, my dear sir,” continued
Jack, “ that will admit of much ratiocination. All the creatures
of the earth were given to man for his use — man means man-
kind — they were never intended to be made a monopoly of.
Water is also the gift of heaven, and meant for the use of all.
We now come to the question how far the ﬁsh are your pro-
perty. If the ﬁsh only bred on purpose to please you, and
make you a present of their stock, it might then require a
different line of argument; but as in breeding they only acted

in obedience to an instinct with which they are endowed on
purpose that they may supply man, I submit to you that you
cannot prove these ﬁsh to be yours more than mine. As for
feeding with the idea that they were your own, that is not an
unusual case in this world, even when a man is giving bread
and butter to his children. Further — but I have another
bite — I beg your pardon, my dear sir —— ahl he’s oif
again ——”
“Then, Mr. Easy, you mean to say that the world and its
contents are made for all.”
“Exactly, sir; that is my father’s opinion, who is a very
great philosopher.”
“How then does your father account for some possessing
property and others being without it?”
“Because those who are the strongest have deprived those
who are weaker.”
“But would not that be always the case even if we were
in that state of general inheritance which you have supposed?
For instance, allowing two men to chase the same animal,
and both to come up to it at the same time, would not the
strongest bear it oif?”
“I grant that, sir.”
“Well then, where is your equality?”
“That does not disprove that men were not intended to be
equal; it only proves that they are not so. Neither does it
disprove that everything was not made for the beneﬁt of all;
it only proves that the strong will take advantage of the weak,
which is very natural.”
“Oh! you grant that to be very natural. Well, Mr. Easy,
I am glad to perceive that we are of one mind, and I trust we
shall continue so. You’ll observe that I and my keepers
being three, we are the strong party in this instance, and ad-
mitting your argument, that the ﬁsh are as much yours as
mine, still I take advantage of my strength to re-possess my-
self of them, which is, as you say, very natural—James, take
those ﬁsh.”
Mr. Midshipman Easy. 3

“If you please,” interrupted Jack, “we will argue that
01n ——”
P “Not at all; I will act according to your own arguments
— I have the ﬁsh, but I now mean to have more — that ﬁsh-
ing-rod is as much mine as yours, and being the stronger
party I will take possession of it. James, William, take that
ﬁshing-rod, — it is ours.”
“I presume you will ﬁrst allow me to observe,” replied
Jack, “that although I have expressed my opinion that the
earth and the animals on it were made for us all, that I never
yet have asserted, that what a man creates by himself, or
has created for him for a consideration, is not his own pro-
pelty.n
“I beg your pardon; the trees that that rod was made
from were made for us all, and if you, or any one for you,
have thought proper to make it into a rod, it is no more my
fault than it is that I have been feeding the ﬁsh, with the sup-
position that they were my own. Everything being common,
and it being but natural that the strong should take advantage
of the weak, I must take that rod as my property, until I am
dispossessed by one more powerful. Moreover, being the
stronger party, and having possession of this land, which you
say does not belong to me more than to you—I also shall
direct my keepers to see you off this property. James, take
the rod— see Mr. Easy over the park palings. Mr. Easy, I
wish you a good morning.”
“Sir, I beg your pardon, you have not yet heard all my
arguments,” replied Jack, who did not approve of the con-
clusions drawn.
“I have no time to hear more, Mr. Easy; I wish you a
good morning.” And the proprietor departed, leaving Jack
in company with the keepers.
“I’ll trouble you for that rod, master,” said William.
James was very busy stringing the ﬁsh through the gills upon
a piece of osier.
“At all events you will hear reason,” said Jack: “I have
arguments —--”

“I never heard no good arguments in favour of poach-
ing,” interrupted the keeper.
“You’re an insolent fellow,” replied Jack. “It is by pay-
ing such vagabonds as you that people are able to be guilty
of injustice.”
“It’s by paying us that the land a.n’t poached — and if
there be some excuse for a poor devil who is out of work,
there be none for you, who call yourself a gentleman.”
“According to his ’count, as we be all equal, he be no
more a gentleman than we be.”
“ Silence, you blackguard, I shall not condescend to argue
with such as you: if I did I could prove that you are a set of
base slaves, who have just as much right to this property as
your master or I have.” ‘
“As you have, I dare say, master.”
“As I have, you scoundrel; this pond is as much my pro-
perty, and so are the ﬁsh in it, as they are of your master,
who has usurped the right.”
“I say, James, what do you say, shall we put the young
gentleman in possession of his property?” said William,
winking to the other.
William took the hint, they seized Jack by the arms and
legs, and soused him into the pond. Jack arose after a deep
submersion, and ﬂoundered on shore blowing and spluttering.
But in the meantime the keepers had walked away, carrying
with them the rod and line, ﬁsh, and tin-can of bait, laughing
loudly at the practical joke which they had played our hero.
“ Well,” thought Jack, “either here must be some mistake
in my fathees philosophy, or else this is a very wicked world.
I shall submit this case to my father.”
And Jack received this reply -—- “I have told you before,
Jack, that these important truths will not at present be ad-
mitted —but it does not the less follow that they are true.
This is the age of iron, in which might has become right—
but the time will come when these truths will be admitted,
and your father’s name will be more celebrated than that of
any philosopher of ancient days. Reeollect, Jack, that al-

MR. MIDSHIPMAN EASY.
though in preaching against wrong and advocating the rights
of man, you will be treated as a martyr, it is still your duty
to persevere; and if you are dragged through all the horse-
ponds in the kingdom, never give up your argumen ”
“That I never will, sir,” replied J ack; “but the next time
I argue it shall be, if possible, with power on my side, and,
at all events, not quite so near a pond.”
“I think,” said Mrs. Easy, who had been a silent listener,
“that Jack had better ﬁsh in the river, and then, if he catches
no ﬁsh, at all events he will not be soused in the water, and
spoil his clothes.”
But Mrs. Easy was no philosopher.
A few days afterwards, Jack discovered, one ﬁne morning,
on the other side of a hedge, a summer apple-tree bearing
tempting fruit, and he immediately broke through the hedge,
and climbing the tree, as our ﬁrst mother did before him, he
culled the fairest and did eat.
“I say, you sir, what are you doing there?” cried a rough
vorce.
Jack looked down, and perceived a stout, thickset per-
sonage in grey coat and red waistcoat, standing underneath
him.
“ Don’t you see what I’m about,” replied J ack, “I’m eating
apples — shall I throw you down a few?”
“Thank you kindly—the fewer that are pulled the better;
perhaps, as you are so free to give them to others as well as
to help yourself, you may think that they are your own pro-
pew!”
“Not a bit more my property than they are yours, my
good man.”
“I guess that’s something like the truth; but you are not
quite at the truth yet, my lad; those apples are mine, and I’ll
trouble you to come down as fast as you please; when you’re
down we can then settle our accounts; and,” continued the
man, shaking his cudgel, “ depend upon it you shall have your
receipt in full.”
Jack did not much like the appearance of things.

MR. mnsmrmsn nssv. 37
“My good man,” said he, “it is quite a prejudice on your
part to imagine that apples were not given, as well as all
other fruit, for the beneﬁt of us all — they are common pro-
perty, believe me.”
“That’s a matter of opinion, my lad, and I may be allowed
to have my own.”
“ You’ll ﬁnd it in the Bible,” says Jack.
“I never did yet, and I’ve read it through and through all,
bating the ’Pocryfar.”
“Then,” said Jack, “go home and fetch the Bible, and
I’ll prove it to you.”
“I suspect you‘ll not wait till I come back again. No, no;
I have lost plenty of apples, and have long wanted to ﬁnd the
robbers out; now I’ve caught one I’ll take care that he don’t
’scape without apple-sauce, at all events — so come down,
you young thief, come down directly — or it will be all the
worse for you.”
“Thank you,” said Jack, “but I am very well here.‘ I
will, if you please, argue the point from where I am.”
“I’ve no time to argue the point, my lad; I’ve plenty to
do, but do not think I’ll let you off. If you don’t choose to
come down, why then you may stay there, and I’ll answer for
it, as soon as work is done I shall ﬁnd you safe enough.”
“ What can be done,” thought Jack, “with a man who will
not listen to argument? What a world is this! — however,
he’ll not ﬁnd me here when he comes back, I’ve a notion.”
But in this Jack was mistaken. The farmer walked to the
hedge, and called a boy, who took his orders and ran to the
farm house. In a minute or two a large bull-dog was seen
bounding along the orchard to his master. “Mark him,C2nsar,”
said the farmer to the dog, “mark him.” The dog crouched
down on the grass, with his head up, and eyes glaring at
Jack, showing a range of teeth, that drove all our hero’s phi-
losophy out of his head.
‘I can’t wait here, but Caesar can, and I will tell you, as
a friend , that if he gets hold of you, he’ll not leave a limb of
you together,—when work’s done I’ll come back;” so saying,

the farmer walked ofl’, leaving Jack and the dog to argue the
point, if so inclined. What a sad jade must philosophy be,
to put her votaries in such predicamentsl
After a while the dog laid his head down and closed his
eyes, as if asleep, but Jack observed that at the least move-
ment on his part one eye was seen partially to unclose; so
Jack, like a prudent man, resolved to remain where he was.
He picked a few more apples, for it was his dinner-time, and
as he chewed he ruminated.
Jack had been but a few minutes ruminating before he
was interrupted by another ruminating animal, no less a per-
sonage than a bull, who had been turned out with full pos-
session of the orchard, and who now advanced, bellowing oc-
casionally, and tossing his head at the sight of Caesar, whom
he considered as much a trespasser as his master had our
hero. Caesar started on his legs and faced the bull, who ad-
vanced pawing, with his tail up in the air. When within a
few yards the-bull made a rush at the dog, who evaded him
and attacked him in return, and thus did the warfare continue
until the opponents were already at some distance from the
apple-tree. Jack prepared for immediate ﬂight, but un-
fortunately the combat was carried on by the side of the
hedge at which Jack had gained admission. Never mind,
thought Jack, there are two sides to every ﬁeld, and although
the other hedge joined on to the garden near to the farm
house, there was no option. “At all events,” said Jack, “I’ll
try it.” Jack was slipping down the trunk, when he heard
a tremendous roar; the bulldog had been tossed by the bull;
he was then high in the air, and Jack saw him fall on the
other side of the hedge; and the bull was thus celebrating his
victory with a ﬂourish of trumpets. Upon which Jack, per-
ceiving that he was relieved from his sentry, slipped down
the rest of the tree and took to his heels. Unfortunately for
Jack, the bull saw him, and, ﬂushed with victory, he im-
mediately set up another roar, and bounded after Jack. Jack
perceived his danger, and fear gave him wings; he not only

ﬂew over the orchard, but he ﬂew over the hedge, which was
about ﬁve feet high, just as the bull drove his head into it.
Look before you leap, is an old proverb. Had Jack done so,
he would have done better; but as there were cogent reasons
to be offered in extenuation of our philosopher, we shall say
no more, but merely state that Jack, when he got to the other
side of the hedge, found that he had pitched into a small
apiary, and had upset two hives of bees, who resented the
intrusion; and Jack had hardly time to get upon his legs
before he found them very busy stinging him in all quarters.
All that Jack could do was to run for it, but the bees ﬂew
faster than he could run, and Jack was mad with pain, when
he stumbled, half-blinded, over the brick-work of a well.
Jack could not stop his pitching into the well, but he seized
the iron chain as it struck him across the face. Down went
Jack, and round went the windlass, and after a rapid descent
of forty feet our hero found himself under water, and no
longer troubled with the bees, who, whether they had lost
scent of their prey from his rapid descent, or being notori-
ously clever insects, acknowledged the truth of the adage,
“leave well alone,” had certainly left Jack with no other
companion than Truth. Jack rose from his immersion, and
seized the rope to which the chain of the bucket was made
fast — it had all of it been unwound from the windlass, and
therefore it enabled Jack to keep his head above water.
After a few seconds Jack felt something against his legs, it
was the bucket, about two feet under the water; Jack put his
feet into it and found himself pretty comfortable, for the
water, after the sting of the bees and the heat he had been
put into by the race with the bull, was quite cool and re-
freshing. ‘
“At all events,” thought Jack, “if it had not been for the
bull, I should have been watched by the dog, and then
thrashed by the farmer; but then again, if it had not been
for the bull, I should not have tumbled among the bees; and
if it had not been for the bees, I should not have tumbled
into the well; and if it had not been for the chain, 1 should

have been drowned. Such has been the chain of events, all
because I wanted to eat an apple.
“However, I have got rid of the farmer, and the dog, and
the bull, and the bees— all’s well that ends well; but how
the devil am I to get out of the well? — All creation appear
to have conspired against the rights of man. As my father
said, this is an iron age, and here I am swinging to an iron
chain.”
We have given the whole of Jack’s soliloquy, as it will
prove that Jack was no fool, although he was a bit of a philo-
sopher; and a man who could reason so well upon cause and
effect, at the bottom of a well, up to his neck in water,
showed a good deal of presence of mind. But if Jack’s mind
had been a little twisted by his father’s philosophy, it had
still sufﬁcient strength and elasticity to recover itself in due
time. Had Jack been a common personage, we should never
have selected him for our hero.
CHAPTER VII.
In which Jack makes some very sage Recﬂections, and comes to a very
unwise Decision.
Arrnn all, it must be acknowledged that although there
are cases of distress in which a well may become a place of
refuge, a well is not at all calculated for a prolonged residence
—so thought Jack. After he had been there some ﬁfteen
minutes, his teeth ehattered, and his lips trembled; he felt a
numbness all over, and he thought it high time to call for
assistance, which at ﬁrst he would not, as he was afraid he
should be pulled up to encounter the indignation of the farmer
and his family. Jack was arranging his jaws for a halloo,
when he felt the chain pulled up, and he slowly emerged from
the water. At ﬁrst he heard complaints of the weight of the
bucket, at which Jack was not surprised; then he heard a
tittering and laughing between two parties, and soon after-
wards he mounted up gaily. At last his head appeared above

the low wall, and he was about to extend his arms so as to
secure a position on it, when those who were working at the
Windlass beheld him. It was a heavy farming man and a
maid servant.
“Thank you,” said Jack.
One never should be too quick in returning thanks; the
girl screamed and let go the winch, the man, frightened,
did not hold it fast; it slipped from his grasp, whirled round,
struck him under the chin, and threw him over it headlong,
and before the “Thank you” was fairly out of Jack’s lips,
down he went again like lightning to the bottom. Fortu-
nately for Jack, he had not yet let go the chain, or he might
have struck the sides and have been killed; as it was, he was
merely soused a second time, and in a minute or two regained
his former position.
“This is mighty pleasant,” thought Jack, as he clapped
his wet hat once more on his head; “at all events, they can’t
now plead ignorance, they must know that I’m here.”
In the meantime the girl ran into the kitchen, threw her-
self down on a stool, from which she reeled off in a ﬁt upon
sundry heaps of dough waiting to be baked in the oven,
which were laid to rise on the ﬂoor before the ﬁre.
“ Mercy on me, what is the matter with Susan? ” exclaimed
the farmer’s wife. “Here—where’s Mary— where’s John
— Deary me, if the bread won’t all be turned to pancakes.”
John soon followed, holding his under-jaw in his hand,
looking very dismal and very frightened, for two reasons;
one, because he thought that his jaw was broken, and the
other, because he thought he had seen the devil.
“ Mercy on us, what is the matter?” exclaimed the farmer’s
wife again. “Mary, Mary, Mary!” screamed she, beginning
to be frightened herself, for with all her efforts she could not
remove Susan from the bed of dough, where she lay senseless
and heavy as lead. Mary answered to her mistress’s loud
appeal, and with her assistance they raised up Susan; but as
for the bread, there was no hopes of it ever rising again.

42 MR. MIDSHIPMsJN msv.
“Why don’t you come here and help Susan, John?” cried
Mary.
“Aw-yaw-aw!” was all the reply of John, who had had
enough quite of helping Susan, and who continued to hold
his head, as it were, in his hand.
“What’s the matter here, missus?” exclaimed the farmer,
coming in. “Highty-tighty, what ails Susan? and what ails
you?” continued the farmer, turning to John. “Dang it, but
everything seems to go wrong this blessed day. First, there
be all the apples stolen — then there be Caesar with his ﬂank
opened by the bull — then there be the bull broken through
the hedge and tumbled into the saw-pit— and now I come to
get more help to drag him out, I ﬁnd one woman dead like,
and John looks as if he had seen the devil.”
“Aw-yaw-aw! ” replied John, nodding his head very
signiﬁcantly.
“One would think that the devil had broke loose to-day.
What is it, John? Have you seen him, and has Susan seen
him?”
“Aw yaw.”
“He’s stopped your jaw, then, at all events, and Ithought
the devil himself wouldn’t have done that — we shall get
nothing of you. Is that wench coming to her senses?”
“Yes, yes, she’s better now.—Susan, what’s the matter?”
“Oh, oh , ma’am! the well, the well ——”
“The well! Something wrong there, I suppose: well, I
will go and see.”
The farmer trotted ofl‘ to the well; he perceived the bucket
was at the bottom and all the rope out; he looked about him,
and then he looked into the well. Jack, who had become
very impatient, had been looking up some time for the assist-
ance which he expected would have come sooner; the round
face of the farmer occasioned a partial eclipse of the round
disk which bounded his view, just as one of the satellites of
Jupiter sometimes obscures the face of the planet round
which he revolves.
“Here I am,” cried Jack; “get me up quick, or I shall be

dead;” and what Jack said was true, for he was quite done
up by having been so long down, although his courage had
not failed him.
“Dang it, but there be somebody fallen into the well,”
cried the farmer; “no end to mishaps this day. Well, we
must get a Christian out of a well afore we get a bull out of
a saw-pit, so l’ll go and call the men.”
In a very short time the men who were assembled round
the saw-pit were brought to the well.
“Down below there, hold on now.”
“Never fear,” cried Jack.
Away went the winch, and once more Jack had an ex-
tended horizon to survey. As soon as he was at the top, the
men hauled him over the bricks and laid him down upon the
ground, for Jack’s strength had failed him.
“Dang it, if it bean’t that chap who was on my apple-
tree,” cried the farmer— “howsomever, he must not die for
stealing a few apples; lift him up, lads, and take him in
— he is dead with cold — no wonder.”
The farmer led the way, and the men carried Jack into
the house, when the farmer gave him a glass of brandy; this
restored Jack’s circulation, and in a short time he was all
right again.
After some previous conversation, in which Jack narrated
all that had happened, “What may be your name?” inquired
the farmer.
“My name is Easy,” replied Jack.
“ What! be you the son of Mr. Easy, of Forest Hill?”
“Yes.”
“Dang it, he be my landlord, and a right good landlord
too— why didn’t you say so when you were up in the apple-
tree? You might have picked the whole orchard and wel-
come.”
“My dear sir,” replied Jack, who had taken a second
glass of brandy, and was quite talkative again, “let this be a
warning to you, and when a man proposes to argue the point,
always, in future, listen. Had you waited, 1 would have

proved to you most incontestably that you had no more right
to the apples than I had; but you would not listen to argu-
ment, and without discussion we can never arrive at truth.
You send for your dog, who is ripped up by the bull — the
bull breaks his leg in a saw-pit—the bee-hives are over-
turned, and you lose all your honey -—- your man John breaks
his jaw -— your maid Susan spoils all the bread — and why?
because you would not allow me to argue the poin .”
“Well, Mr. Easy, it be all true that all these mishaps
have happened because I would not allow you to argue the
point, perhaps, although, as I rent the orchard from your
father, I cannot imagine how you could prove to me that the
apples were not mine; but now, let’s take your side of the
question, and I don’t see how you be much better off: you get
up in a tree for a few apples, with plenty of money to buy
them if you like— you are kept there by a dog—you are
nearly gored by a bull -—- you are stung by the bees, and you
tumble souse into a well, and are nearly killed a dozen times,
and all for a few apples not worth twopence.”
“All very true, my good man,” replied Jack; “but you
forget that I, as a philosopher, was defending the rights of
man.”
“Well, I never knew before that a lad who stole apples
was called a philosopher—we calls it petty larceny in the
indictments; and as for your rights of man, I cannot see how
they can be defended by doing what’s wrong.” '
“You do not comprehend the matter, farmer.”
“No, I don’t— and I be too old to learn, Master Easy.
All I have to say is this, you are welcome to all the apples in
the orchard if you please, and if you prefers, as it seems you
do, to steal them, instead of asking for them, which I only
can account for by the reason that they say, that ‘ stolen fruit
be sweetest,’ I’ve only to say that I shall give orders that you
be not interfered with. My chaise be at the door, Master
Easy, and the man will drive you to your father’s—make
my compliments to him, and say, that I’m very sorry that
you tumbled into our well.”

As Jack was much more inclined for bed than argument,
he wished the farmer good night, and allowed himself to be
driven home.
The pain from the sting of the bees, now that his circula-
tion had fully returned, was so great, that he was not sorry
to ﬁnd Dr. Middleton taking his tea with his father and
mother. Jack merely said that he had been so unfortunate
as to upset a hive, and had been severely stung. He deferred
the whole story till another opportunity. Dr. Middleton pre-
scribed for Jack, but on taking his hand found that he was
in a high fever, which, after the events of the day, was not
to be wondered at. Jack was bled, and kept his bed for a
week, by which time he was restored; but during that time,
Jack had been thinking very seriously, and had made up his
mind.
But we must explain a circumstance which had occurred,
which was probably the cause of Jack’s decision. When
Jack returned on the evening in question, he found seated
with his father and Dr. Middleton, a Captain Wilson, a sort
of cousin to the family, who but occasionally paid them a
visit, for he lived at some distance; and having a wife and
large family, with nothing but his half-pay for their support,
he could not afford to expend even shoe-leather in compli-
ments. The object of this visit on the part of Captain Wil-
son was to request the aid of Mr. Easy. He had succeeded
in obtaining his appointment to a sloop of war (for he was in
the king’s service), but was without the means of ﬁtting him-
self out, without leaving his wife and family penniless. He
therefore came to request Mr. Easy to lend him a few hun-
dred pounds, until he should be able, by his prize-money, to
repay them. Mr. Easy was not a man to refuse such a re-
quest, and always havrng plenty of spare cash at his banker’s,
.he drew a cheque for a thousand pounds, which he gave to
Captain Wilson, requesting that he would only repay it at
his convenience. Captain Wilson wrote an acknowledgment
of the debt, promising to pay upon his ﬁrst prize-money,
which receipt, however binding it may be to a man of honour,

was, in point of law, about as valuable as if he had agreed
to pay as soon “as the cows came home.” The aifair had
been just concluded, and Captain Wilson had returned into
the parlour with Mr. Easy, when Jack returned from his ex-
pedition.
Jack greeted Captain Wilson, whom he had long known;
but, as we before observed, he suffered so much pain, that
he soon retired with Dr. Middleton, and went to bed.
During a week there is room for much reﬂection, even in
a lad of fourteen, although at that age we are not much in-
clined to think. But Jack was in bed; his eyes were so
swollen with the stings of the bees that he could neither read
nor otherwise amuse himself; and he preferred his own
thoughts to the gabble of Sarah, who attended him; so Jack
thought, and the result of his cogitations we shall soon bring
forward.
It was on the eighth day that Jack left his bed and came
down into the drawing-room. He then detailed to his father
the adventures which had taken place, which had obliged
him to take to his bed.
“You see, Jack,” replied his father, “it’s just what I
told you: the world is so utterly demoralised by what is called
social compact, and the phalanx supporting it, by contribut-
ing a portion of their unjust possessions for the security of
the remainder, is so powerful, that any one who opposes it
must expect to pass the life of a martyr; but martyrs are al-
ways required previous to any truth, however sublime, being
received, and, like Abraham, whom I have always considered
as a great philosopher, I am willing to sacriﬁce my only son
in so noble a cause.”
“That’s all very good on your part, father, but we must
argue the point a little. If you are as great a philosopher as
Abraham, I am not quite so dutiful a son as Isaac, whose
blind obedience , in my opinion, is very contrary to your
rights of man: but the fact, in few words, is simply this. In
promulgating your philosophy, in the short space of two days,
I have been robbed of the ﬁsh I caught, and my rod and line

— I have been soused into a ﬁsh-pond — I have been fright-
ened out of my wits by a bull-dog — been nearly killed by a
bull — been stung to death by bees, and twice tumbled into
a well. Now, if all that happens in two days, what must I
expect to suffer in a whole year? It appears to be very un-
wise to attempt making further converts, for people on shore
seem determined not to listen to reason or argument. But it
has occurred to me, that although the whole earth has been
so nefariously divided among the few, that the waters at
least are the property of all. No man claims his share of the
sea-—-every one may there plough as he pleases, without being
taken up for a trespasser. Even war makes no difference;
every one may go on as he pleases, and if they meet, it is
nothing but a neutral ground on which the parties contend.
It is, then, only upon the ocean that I am likely to ﬁnd that
equality and rights of man, which we are so anxious to es-
tablish on shore; and therefore I have resolved not to go to
school again, which I detest, but to go to sea, and propagate
our opinions as much as I can.” .
“I cannot listen to that, Jack. In the ﬁrst place, you
must return to school; in the next place, you shall not go to
sea.”
“Then, father, all I have to say is, that I swear by the
rights of man I will not go back to school, and that I will go
to sea. Who and what is to prevent me? Was not I born
my own master? — has any one a right to dictate to me as if
I were not his equal? Have I not as much right to my share
of the sea as any other mortal? I stand upon perfect equality,”
continued Jack , stamping his right foot on the ﬂoor.
What had Mr. Easy to offer in reply? He must either,
as a philosopher, have sacriﬁced his hypothesis, or, as a
father, have sacriﬁced his son. Like all philosophers, he pre-
ferred what he considered as the less important of the two,
he sacriﬁced his son; but — we will do him justice — he did
it with a sigh.
“Jack, you shall, if you wish it, go to sea.”
“That of course,” replied Jack, with the air of a con-

queror; “but the question is, with whom? Now it has oc-
curred to me, that Captain Wilson has just been appointed
to a ship, and I should like to sail with him.”
“I will write to him,” said Mr. Easy, mournfully, “ but I
should have liked to have felt his head ﬁrst;” and thus was
the matter arranged.
The answer from Captain Wilson was, of course, in the
afﬁrmative, and he promised that he would treat Jack as his
own son.
Our hero mounted his father’s horse, and rode off to Mr.
Bonnycastle.
“I am going to sea, Mr. Bonnycastle.”
“The very best thing for you,” replied Mr. Bonnycastle.
Our hero met Dr. Middleton.
“I am going to sea, Dr. Middleton.”
“The very best thing for you,” replied the Doctor.
“I am going to sea, mother,” said John.
“T0 sea, John, to sea? no, no, dear John, you are not
going to sea,” replied Mrs. Easy, with horror.
“Yes, I am; father has agreed, and says he will obtain
your consent.”
“My consent! Oh, my dear, dear boy!” — and Mrs. Easy
wept bitterly, as Rachel mourning for her children.
CHAPTER ,VIII.
In which Mr. Easy has his ﬁrst Lesson as to Zeal in His Majesty’s Service.
As there was no time to lose, our hero very soon bade
adieu to his paternal roof, as the phrase is, and found his
way down to Portsmouth. As Jack had plenty of money,
and was very much pleased at ﬁnding himself his own master,
he was in no hurry to join his ship, and ﬁve or six companions,
not very creditable , whom either Jack had picked up, or had
picked up Jack, and who lived upon him, strongly advised
him to put it off until the very last moment. As this advice
happened to coincide with J ack’s opinion, our hero was three

weeks at Portsmouth before any one knew of his arrival, but
at last Captain Wilson received a letter from Mr. Easy, by
which he found that Jack had left home at the period we
have mentioned, and he desired the ﬁrst-lieutenant to make
inquiries, as he was afraid that some accident might have
happened to him. As Mr. Sawbridge, the ﬁrst-lieutenant,
happened to be going on shore on the same evening for the
last time previous to the ship’s sailing, he looked into the
Blue Posts, George, and Fountain Inns, to inquire if there
was such a person arrived as Mr. Easy. “O yes,” replied
the waiter at the Fountain, — “Mr. Easy has been here
these three weeks.”
“The devil he has,” roared Mr. Sawbridge, with all the
indignation of a ﬁrst-lieutenant defrauded three weeks of a
midshipman; “where is he; in the coffee-room?”
“Oh dear no, sir,” replied the waiter, “Mr. Easy has the
front apartments on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.”
“Well, then, show me up to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.”
“May I request the pleasure of your name, sir?” said the
waiter.
“First-lieutenants don’t send up their names to midship-
men,” replied Mr. Sawbridge; “he shall soon know who I
am.”
At this reply, the waiter walked upstairs, followed by Mr.
Sawbridge, and threw open the door.
“A gentleman wishes to see you, sir,” said the waiter.
“Desire him to walk in,” said Jack: “and, waiter, mind
that the punch is a little better than it was yesterday; I have
asked two more gentlemen to dine here.”
In the meantime, Mr. Sawbridge, who was not in his uni-
form, had entered, and perceived Jack alone, with the dinner
table laid out in the best style for eight, a considerable show
of plate for even the Fountain Inn, and everything, as well
as the apartment itself, according to Mr. Sawbridge’s opinion,
much more ﬁt for a commander-in-chief than a midshipman
of a sloop of war.
Now Mr. Sawbridge was a good ofﬁcer, one who had re-

ally worked his way up to the present rank, that is to say,
that he had served seven-and-twenty years, and had nothing
but his pay. He was a little soured in the service, and cer-
tainly had an aversion to the young men of family who were
now fast crowding into it — and with some grounds, as he
perceived his own chance of promotion decrease in the same
ratio as the numbers increased. He considered that in pro-
portion as midshipmen assumed a cleaner and more gentle-
manly appearance, so did they become more useless, and it
may therefore be easily imagined that his bile was raised by
this parade and display in a lad, who was very shortly to be,
and ought three weeks before to have been, shrinking from
his frown. Nevertheless, Sawbridge was a good-hearted
man, although a little envious of luxury, which he could not
pretend to indulge in himself.
“May I beg to ask,” said Jack, who was always remark-
ably polite and gentlemanly in his address, “in wha . manner
I may be of service to you?”
“Yes, sir, you may — by joining your ship immediately.
And may I beg to ask in return, sir, what is the reason you
have staid on shore three weeks without joining her?”
Hereupon Jack, who did not much admire the peremptory
tone of Mr. Sawbridge, and who during the answer had taken
a seat, crossed his legs, and played with the gold chain to
which his watch was secured, after a pause very coolly re-
plied , —
“And pray, who are you?”
“Who am I, sir?” replied Sawbridge, jumping out of his
chair — “my name is Sawbridge, sir, and I am the ﬁrst-
lieutenant of the Harpy. Now, sir, you have your answer.”
Mr. Sawbridge, who imagined that the name of the ﬁrst-
lieutenant would strike terror to a culprit midshipman, threw
himself back in the chair, and_ assumed an air of importance.
“Really, sir,” replied Jack, “what may be,your exact
situation on board, my ignorance of the service will not allow
me to guess, but if I may judge from your behaviour, you
have no small opinion of yourself.”

MR. mnsmrmsn msv. 51
“Look ye, young man, you may not know what a ﬁrst-
lieutenant is, and I take it for granted that you do not, by
your behaviour; but depend upon it, I’ll let you know very
soon. In the meantime, sir, I insist upon it, that you go im-
mediately on board.”
“I’m sorry that I cannot comply with your very moderate
request,” replied Jack, coolly. “I shall go on board when it
suits my convenience, and I beg that you will give yourself
no further trouble on my accoun .”
Jack then rang the bell; the waiter, who had been listen-
ing outside, immediately entered, and before Mr. Sawbridge,
who was dumb with astonishment at Jack’s impertinence,
could have time to reply, —
“ Waiter,” said Jack, “show this gentleman down stairs.”
“By the god of war!” exclaimed the ﬁrst-lieutenant, “but
I’ll soon show you down to the boat, my young bantam; and
when once I get you safe on board, I’ll make you know the
diiference between a midshipman and a ﬁrst-lieutenant.”
“I can only admit of equality, sir,” replied Jack; “we
are all born equal — I trust you’ll allow that.”
“Equality — damn it, I suppose you’ll take the command
of the ship. However, sir, your ignorance will be a little
enlightened by-and-bye. I shall now go and report your con-
duct to Captain Wilson; and I tell you plainly, that if you
are not on board this evening, to-morrow morning, at day-
light, I shall send a sergeant and a ﬁle of marines to fetch
you.”
“You may depend upon it, sir,” replied Jack, “that I
also shall not fail to mention to Captain Wilson, that I con-
sider you a very quarrelsome, impertinent fellow, and recom-
mend him not to allow you to remain on board. It will be
quite uncomfortable to be in the same ship with such an un-
gentlemanly bear.”
“He must be mad— quite mad,” exclaimed Sawbridge,
whose astonishment even mastered his indignation. “Mad as
a march hare — by God.”

52 MR. mnsrnrwm nssv.
“No, sir,” replied Jack, “I am not mad, but I am a philo-
sopher.”
“A what?” exclaimed Sawbridge, “damme, what next?
— well, my joker, all the better for you, I shall put your
philosophy to the proof.”
“It is for that very reason, sir,” replied Jack, “that 1
have decided upon going to sea; and if you do remain on
board, I hope to argue the point with you, and make you a
convert to the truth of equality and the rights of man.”
“By the Lord that made us both, I’ll soon make you a
convert to the thirty-six articles of war— that is, if you re-
main on board; but I shall now go to the captain , and report
your conduct, sir, and leave you to your dinner with what
appetite you may.”
“Sir, I am inﬁnitely obliged to you; but you need not be
afraid of my appetite; I am only sorry, as you happen to be-
long to the same ship, that I cannot, in justice to the gentle-
manly young men whom I expect, ask you to join them. I
wish you a very good morning, sir.”
“Twenty years have I been in the service,” roared Saw-
bridge, “and, damme ——- but he’s mad — downright, stark,
staring mad.” And the ﬁrst-lieutenant bounced out of the
room. ,
Jack was a little astonished himself. Had Mr. Sawbridge
made his appearance in uniform it might have been diﬁ"erent,
but that a plain-looking man, with black whiskers, shaggy
hair, and old blue frock coat and yellow cassimere waistcoat,
should venture to address him in such a manner, was quite
incomprehensible; — he calls me mad, thought Jack, I shall
tell Captain Wilson what is my opinion about his lieutenant.
Shortly afterwards the company arrived, and Jack soon forgot
all about it.
in the meantime Sawbridge called at the captain’s lodgings,
and found him at home. He made a very faithful report of
all that had happened, and concluded his report by demand-
ing, in great wrath, either an instant dismissal or a court-
martial on our hero, Jack.

that.”
“ Stop, Sawbridge,” replied Captain Wilson, “take a
chair: as Mr. Easy says, we must argue the point, and then I
will leave it to your better feelings. As for the court-martial,
it will not hold good, for Mr. Easy, in the ﬁrst place, has not
yet joined the ship, and in the next place, could not be sup-
posed to know that you were the ﬁrst-lieutenant, or even an
ofﬁcer, for you went to him out of uniform.”
“Very true, sir,” replied Sawbridge, “I had forgotten
“Then, as for his dismissal, or rather, not allowing him
to join, Mr. Easy has been brought up in the country, and
has never seen anything aquatic larger than a ﬁsh-pond,
perhaps, in his life; and as for the service, or the nature of
it, I believe he is as ignorant of it as a child not a year old —
I doubt whether he knows the rank of a lieutenant; certainly,
he can have no idea of the power of a ﬁrst-lieutenant, by his
treatment of you.”
“1 should think not,” replied Sawbridge, dryly.
“I do not think, therefore, that conduct which must have
proceeded from sheer ignorance should be so severely punished
- — I appeal to you, Sawbridge.”
“ Well, sir, perhaps you are right — but still he told me
he was a philosopher, and talked about equality and rights
of man. Told me that he could only admit of equality
between us, and begged to argue the point. Now, sir, if a
midshipmau is to argue the point every time that an order is
given, the service will come to a pretty pass.”
“That is all very true, Sawbrldge; and now you remind
me of what never occurred to me at the time that I promised
to take Mr. Easy inthe ship. 1 now recollect that his father,
who is a distant relation of mine, has some very wild notions
in his head, just like what have been repeated by his son on
your interview with him. I have occasionally dined there,
and Mr. Easy has always been upholding the principles of
natural equality and of the rights of man, much to the amuse-
ment of his guests, and I confess, at the time, of mine also.
I recollect telling him that I trusted he would never be able

to disseminate his opinions in the service to which I belonged,
as we should have an end of all discipline. I little thought,
at the time, that his only son, who has no more occasion to
go to sea than the Archbishop of Canterbury, for his father
has a very handsome property —I believe seven or eight
thousand a year — would ever have sailed with me, and have
brought these opinions with him into any ship that I com-
manded. It is a pity, a great pit ——”
“He never could have brought his pigs to a worse market,”
observed Sawbridge.
“I agree with you, and, as a father myself, I cannot but
help feeling how careful we should be, how we inculcate any-
thing like abstract and philosophical ideas to youth. Allow-
ing them to be in themselves correct, still they are dangerous
as sharp instruments are in the hands of a child; — allowing
them to be erroneous, they are seized upon with an avidity
by young and ardent minds, and are not to be eradicated
without the greatest difﬁculty, and very often not until they
have accomplished their ruin.”
“Then you think, sir, that these ideas have taken deep
root in this young man, and we shall not easily rid him of
them?”
“I do not say so; but still, recollect they have been in~
stilled, perhaps, from the earliest period, by one from whom
they must have been received with all conﬁdenee—from a
father to a son; and that son has never yet been sufﬁciently
in the world to have proved their fallacy.”
“Well, sir,” replied Sawbridge, “if I may venture to
oifer an opinion on the subject — and in so doing I assure you
that I only shall from a feeling for the service —if, as you
say, these opinions will not easily be eradicated, as the young
man is independent, would it not be both better for himself,
as well as for the service, that he is sent home again? As an
ofﬁcer he will never do any good for himself, and he may do
much harm to others. I submit this to you, Captain Wilson,
with all respect; but as your ﬁrst-lieutenant, I feel very
jealous at any chance of the discipline of the ship being in-

terfered with by the introduction of this young man, to whom
it appears that a profession is no object.”
“My dear Sawbridge,” replied Captain Wilson, after
taking one or two turns up and down the room, “we entered
the service together, we were messmates for many years, and
you must be aware that it is not only long friendship, but an
intimate knowledge of your unrewarded merit, which has in-
duced me to request you to come with me as my ﬁrst-lieu-
tenant. Now, I will put a‘ case to you, and you shall then
decide the question—and moreover, I will abide by your
decision.
“Suppose that you were a commander like myself, with a
wife and seven children, and that, struggling for many years
to support them, you found yourself, notwithstanding the
utmost parsimony, gradually running into debt. That, after
many long applications, you had at last succeeded in obtain-
ing employment by an appointment to a ﬁne sloop, and there
was every prospect, by prize-money and increased pay, of
recovering yourself from your difﬁculties, if not realising a
sufficient provision for your family. Then suppose that all
this prospect and all these hopes were likely to be dashed to
the ground by the fact of having no means of ﬁtting yourself
out, no credit, no means of paying debts you have contracted,
for which you would have been arrested, or anything sufﬁcient
to leave for the support of your family during your absence,
your agent only consenting to advance one-half of what you
require. Now, suppose, in this awkward dilemma, without
any one in this world upon whom you have any legitimate
claim, as a last resource you were to apply to one with whom
you have but a distant connection, and but an occasional
acquaintance — and that when you had made your request for
the loan of two or three hundred pounds, fully anticipating a
refusal, (from the feeling that he who goes a borrowing goes
a sorrowing,)—I say, suppose, to your astonishment, that
this generous person was to present you with a cheque on his
banker for one thousand pounds, demanding no interest, no
legal security, and requests you only to pay it at your con-

gal would die for him,” replied Sawbridge, with emotion.
“And suppose that, by the merest chance, or from a whim
of the moment, the son of that man was to be placed under
your protection?”
“I would be a father to him,” replied Sawbridge.
“But we must proceed a little further: suppose that you
were to ﬁnd the lad was not all that you could wish, — that
he had imbibed erroneous doctrines, which would probably,
rf not eradrcated, be attended w1th consequences fatal to his
welfare and happiness, _would you therefore, on that account,
wrthdraw your protectipn, and leave hrm to the mercy of
others, who had no clarms of gratrtude to sway them m hrs
favour?”
“Most certainly not, sir,” replied Sawbridge; “on the
contrary, I would never part with the son until, by precept or
otherwise, I had set him right again, and thus had, as far as
it was possible, paid the debt of gratitude due to the generous
father.”
“I hardly need say to you, Sawbridge, after what has
passed, that this lad you have just come from, is the son, and
that Mr. Easy of Forest Hill is the father.”
“Then, sir, I can only say, that not only to please you,
but also from respect to a man who has shown such goodwill
towards one of our cloth, I shall most cheerfully forgive all
that has passed between the lad and me, and all that may
probably take place before we make him what he ought
to be.”
“Thank you, Sawbridge; I expected as much, and am
not disappointed in my opinion of you.”
“And now, Captain Wilson, pray what is to be done?”
“We must get him on board, but not with a ﬁle of
marines, — that will do more harm than good. I will send a
note, requesting him to breakfast with me to-morrow morn-
ing, aud have a little conversation with him I do not wish

to frighten him; he would not scruple to run back to Forest
Hill — now I wish to keep him if I possibly can.”
“You are right, sir; his father appears his greatest
enemy. What a pity that a man with so good a heart should
be so weak in the head! Then, sir, I shall take no notice
of this at present, but leave the whole affair in your
hands.”
“Do, Sawbridge; you have obliged me very much by
your kindness in this business.”
Mr. Sawbridge then took his leave, and Captain Wilson
dispatched a note to our hero, requesting the pleasure of his
company to breakfast at nine o’clock the ensuing morning.
The answer was in the afﬁrmative, but verbal, for Jack had
drunk too much champagne to trust his pen to paper.
C H A P T E R I X.
In which Mr. Easy ﬁnds himself on the other side of the Bay of Biscay.
Tue next morning Jack Easy would have forgotten all
about his engagement with the captain, had it not been for
the waiter, who thought that, after the reception which our
hero had given the ﬁrst-lieutenant, it would be just as well
that he should not be disrespectful to the captain. Now Jack
had not, hitherto, put on his uniform, and he thought this a
ﬁtting occasion, particularly as the waiter suggested the pro-
priety of his appearance in it. Whether it was from a pre-
sentiment of what he was to suffer, Jack was not at all
pleased, as most lads are, with the change in his dress. It
appeared to him that he was sacriﬁcing his independence;
however, he did not follow his ﬁrst impulse, which was to
take it off again, but took his hat, which the waiter had
brushed and handed to him, and then set 011' for the captain’s
lodgings. Captain Wilson received him as if he had not
been aware of his delay in joining his ship, or his interview
with his ﬁrst-lieutenant, but before breakfast was over, Jack
himself narrated the affair in a few words. Captain Wilson

then entered into a detail of the duties and rank of every
person on board of the ship, pointing out to Jack, that where
discipline was required, it was impossible, when duty was
carried on, that more than one could command; and that
that one was the captain, who represented the king in per-
son, who represented the country; and that, as the orders
were transmitted from the captain through the lieutenant,
and from the lieutenant to the midshipmen, who, in their
turn, communicated them to the whole ship’s company, '..in
fact, it was the captain alone who gave the orders,» and that
every one was equally obliged to obey. Indeed, as the cap-
tain himself had to obey the orders of his superiors, the ad-
miral and the admiralty; all on board might be said to-be
equally obliged to obey. Captain Wilson laid a strong em-
phasis on the word equally, as he cautiously administered his
ﬁrst dose; indeed, in the whole of his address, he made use
of special pleading, which would have done credit to the
bar; for at the same time that he was explaining to Jack
that he was entering a service in which equality could never
for a moment exist, if the service was to exist, he contrived
to show that all the grades were levelled, by all being
equally bound to do their duty to their country, and that, in
fact, whether a seaman obeyed his orders, or he obeyed the
orders of his superior ofﬁcer, they were in reality only
obeying the orders of the country, which were administered
through their channels.
Jack did not altogether dislike this view of the subject,
and the captain took care not to dwell too long upon it. He
then entered upon other details, which he was aware would
be more agreeable to Jack. He pointed out that the articles
of war were the rules by which the service was to be guided,
and that everybody, from the captain to the least boy in the
ship, was equally bound to adhere to them — that a certain
allowance of provisions and wine were allowed to each per-
son on board, and that this allowance was the same to all;
the same to the captain as to the boy; the same in quantity
as in quality._, every one equally entitled to his allowance; —

that, although there were, of necessity, various grades neces-
sary in the service, and the captain’s orders were obliged to
be passed and obeyed by all, yet still, whatever was the
grade ofthe ofﬁcer, they were equally considered as gentle-
men. In short, Captain Wilson, who told the truth, and no-
thing but the truth, without telling the whole truth, actually
made Jack fancy that he had at last found out that equality
he had been seekrng for in vain on shore, when, at last, he
recollected the language used by Mr. Sawbridge the evening
before, and asked the captain why that personage had so
conducted himself. Now, as the language of Mr. Sawbridge
was very much at variance with e uality, Captain Wilson
was not a little puzzled. However, e ﬁrst pointed out that
the ﬁrst-lieutenant was, at the time being, the captain, as he
was the senior ofﬁcer on board, as would Jack himself be if
he were the senior ofﬁcer on board; and that, as he before
observed, the captain or senior ofﬁcer represented the country.
That in the articles of war, everybody who absented himself
from the ship, committed an error, or breach of those articles;
and if any error or breach of those articles was com-
mitted by any one belonging to the ship, if the senior
ofﬁcer did not take notice of it, he then himself committed a
breach of those articles, and was liable himself to be punished,
if he could not prove that he had noticed it; it was therefore
to save himself that he was obliged to point out the error;
and if he did it in strong language, it only proved his zeal for
his country.
“Upon my honour, then,” replied Jack, “there can be no
doubt of his zeal: for if the whole country had been at stake,
he could not have put himself in a greater passion.”
“Then he did his duty; but depend upon it it was not a
pleasant one to him: and I’ll answer for it, when you meet
him on board, he will be as friendly with you as if nothing
had happened.”
“He told me that he’d soon make me know what a ﬁrst-
lieutenant was: what did he mean by that?” inquired Jack.
“All zeal.”

“Yes, but he said, that as soon as he got on board, he’d

“All zeal, Mr. Easy. Zeal will break out in this way;
but we should do nothing in the service without it. Recol-
lect that I hope and trust one day to see you also a zealous
ofﬁcer.”
Herc Jack cogitated considerably, and gave no answer.
“You will, I am sure,” continued Captain Wilson, “ﬁnd
Mr. Sawbridge one of your best friends.”
“Perhaps so,” replied Jack; “but I did not much admire
our ﬁrst acquaintance.”
“It will perhaps be your unpleasant duty to ﬁnd as much
fault yourself :, we are all equally bound to do our duty to our
country. But, Mr. Easy, I sent for you to say that we shall
sail to-morrow; and, as I shall send my things off this after-
noon by the launch, you had better send yours ofl‘ also. At
eight o’clock I shall go on board, and we can both go in the
same boat.”
To this Jack made no sort of objection, and having paid
his bill at the Fountain, he sent his chest down to the boat by
some of the crew who came up for it, and attended the sum-
mons of the captain to embark. By nine o’clock that even-
ing, Mr. Jack Easy was safe on board his Majesty’s sloop
Harpy.
\Vhen Jack arrived on board, it was dark, and he did not
know what to do with himself. The captain was received by
the ofﬁcers on deck, who took off their hats to salute him.
The captain retumed the salute, and so did Jack very

politely, after which, the captain -entered into conversation
with the ﬁrst-lieutenant, and for a while Jack was left to him-
self. It was too dark to distinguish faces, and to one who
had never been on board of a ship, too dark to move, so Jack
stood where he was, which was not far from the main bitts;
but he did not stay long; the boat had been hooked on to the
quarter davits, and the boatswain had called out, —-
“Set taut, my lads!”
And then with the shrill whistle, and “Away with her!”
forward came galloping and bounding along, the men with
the tackles; and in the dark Jack was upset, and halfa dozen
marines fell upon him; the men, who had no idea that an
ofﬁcer was ﬂoored among the others, were pleased at the
joke, and continued to dance over those who were down,
until they rolled themselves out of the way. Jack, who did
not understand this, fared badly, and it was not till the calls
piped belay, that he could recover his legs, after having been
trampled upon by half the starboard watch, and the breath
completely jammed out of his body. Jack reeled to a car-
ronade slide, when the ofﬁcers, who had been laughing at the
lark as well as the men, perceived his situation — among
others, Mr. Sawbridge, the ﬁrst-lieutenant.
“Are you hurt, Mr. Easy?” said he, kindly.
“A little,” replied Jack, catching his breath.
“You’ve had but a rough welcome,” replied the :ﬁrst-
lieutenant, “but at certain times, on board ship, it is every
man for himself, and God for us all. Harpur,” continued the
ﬁrst-lieutenant to the doctor, “take Mr. Easy down in the
gun-room with you, and I will be down myself as soon as I
can. Where is Mr. Jolliife?”
“Here, sir,” replied Mr. Jolliife, a master’s mate, coming
aft from the booms.
“There is a youngster come on board with the captain.
Order one of the quarter-masters to get a hammock slung.”
In the meantime Jack went down into the gun-room,
where a glass of wine somewhat recovered him. He did not
stay there long, nor did he venture to talk much. As soon as

his hammock was ready, Jack was glad to go to bed — and
as he was much bruised he was not disturbed the next mor-
n-
ing till past nine o’c1ock. He then dressed himself, went on
deck, found that the sloop was just clear of the Needles, that
he felt very queer, then very sick, and was conducted by a
marine down below, put into his hammock, where he re-
mained during a gale of wind of three days, bewildered, con-
fused, puzzled, and every minute knocking his head against
the beams with the pitching and tossing of the sloop.
“And this is going to sea,” thought Jack; “no wonder
that no one interferes with another here, or talks about a
trespass; for I’m sure any one is welcome to my share of the
ocean; and if I once get on shore again, the devil may have
my portion if he chooses.”
Captainwilson and Mr. Sawbridge had both allowedJack
more leisure than most midshipmen, during his illness. By the
time that the gale was over, the sloop was off Cape Finisterre.
The next morning the sea was nearly down, and there was
but a slight breeze on the waters. The comparative quiet of
the night before had very much recovered our hero, and when
the hammocks were piped up, he was accosted by Mr. Jol-
liife, the master’s mate, who asked, “whether he intended to
rouse and bit, or whether he intended to sail to Gibraltar be-
tween his blankets.”
Jack, who felt himself quite another person, turned out of
his hammock and dressed himself. A marine had, by the
captain’s orders, attended Jack during his illness, and this
man came to his assistance, opened his chest, and brought
him all he required , or Jack would have been in a sad
dilemma.
Jack then inquired where he was to go, for he had not
been in the midshipmen’s berth, although ﬁve days on board.
The marine pointed it out to him, and Jack, who felt exces-
sively hungry, crawled over and between chests, until he
found himself fairly in a hole inﬁnitely inferior to the dog-
kennels which received his father’s pointers.
“I’d not only give up the ocean,” thought Jack, “and my

MR. mnsnIPmsu nssv. 63
share of it, but also my share of the Harpy, unto any one who
fancies it. Equality enough here! for every one appears
equally miserably off.”
As he thus gave vent to his thoughts, he perceived that
there was another person in the berth —— Mr. Jolliife, the
master’s mate, who had ﬁxed his eye uponJack, and to whom
Jack returned the compliment. The ﬁrst thing that Jack ob-
served was, that Mr. Jolliffe was very deeply pockmarked,
and that he had but one eye, and that was a piercer; it ap-
peared like a little ball of ﬁre, and as if it reﬂected more
light from the solitary candle than the candle gave.
“I don’t like your looks,” thought Jack, — “we shall
never be friends.”
But here Jack fell into the common error of judging by
appearances, as will be proved hereafter.
“I’m glad to see you up again, youngster,” said J0lliifc;
“you’ve been on your beam ends longer than usual, but those
who are strongest suffer most — you made your mind up
but late to come to sea. However, they say, ‘Better late than
never.”’
“I feel very much inclined to argue the truth of that
saying,” replied Jack; “but it’s no use just now. I’m ter-
ribly hungry — when shall I get some breakfast?”
“To-morrow morning at half-past eight,” replied Mr.
Joll.iife. “Breakfast for to-day has been over these two
hours.”
“But must I then go without?”
“No, I do not say that, as we must make allowances for
your illness; but it will not be breakfast.”
“Call it what you please,” replied Jack, “only pray de-
sire the servants to give me something to eat. Dry toast or
muff1ns — anything will do, but I should prefer coffee.”
“You forget that you are off Finisterre, in a midship-
man’s berth: coffee we have none — mufﬁns we never see,—
dry toast cannot be made, as we have no soft bread; but a
cup of tea, and ship’s biscuit and butter, I can desire the
steward to get ready for you.”

“Well then,” replied Jack, “I will thank you to procure
me that.”
“Marine,” cried Jolliife, “call Mesty.”
“Pass the word for Mesty,” cried the marine — and the
two syllables were handed forward until lost in the fore part
of the vessel.
The person so named must be introduced to the reader.
He was a curious anomaly—a black man who had been
brought to America as a slave, and there sold.
He was a very tall, spare-built, yet muscular form, and
had a face by no means common with his race. His head
was long and narrow, high cheek-bones, from whence his face
descended down to almost a point at the chin; his nose was
very small, but it was straight and almost Roman; his mouth
also was unusually small; and his lips thin for an African;
his teeth very white, and ﬁled to sharp points. He claimed
the rank of prince in his own country, with what truth could
not of course be substantiated. His master had settled at New .
York, and there Mesty had learned English, if it could be so
called; the fact is, that all the emigrant labourers at New _
York being Irishman, he had learned English with the strong
brogue and peculiar phraseology of the sister kingdom dashed
with a little Yankeeism.
Having been told that there was no slavery in England,
Mesty had concealed himself on board an English merchant
vessel, and escaped. On his arrival inEngland he had entered
on board of a man-of-war. Having no name, it was neces-
sary to christen him on the ship’s books, and the ﬁrst-lieuten-
ant, who had entered him, struck with his remarkable ex-
pression of countenance, and being a German scholar, had
named him Mephistopheles Faust, from whence his Christian
name had been razéed to Mesty. .Mesty in other points was
an eccentric character; at one moment, when he remembered
his lineage, he was proud to excess, at others he was grave
and almost sullen — but when nothing either-in daily occur-
rences or in his mind ran contrary, he exhibited the drollery

so often found in his nation, with a spice of Irish humour, as
if he had caught up the latter with his Irish brogue.
Mesty was soon seen coming aft, but almost double as he
couched under the beams, and taking large strides with his
naked feet.
“By the powers, Massa Yolliife, but it is not seasonable
at all to send for me just now, any how, seeing how the
praters are in the copper, and so many blackguard ’palpeens
all ready to change net for net, and better themselves by the
same mistake, ‘dam um.’ ”
“Mesty, you know I never send for you myself, or allow
others to do so, unless it is necessary,” replied Jolliife; “but
this poor lad has eaten nothing since he has been on board,
and is very hungry — you must get him a little tea.” '
“Is it tay you mane, sir?— I guess, to make tay, in the
ﬁrst place I must ab wate_r,.§p1d in the next must ab room in
the galley to put the kettle on —’pose you wanted to burn
the tip of your little ﬁnger just now, it’s not in the galley
that you ﬁnd a berth for it— and den the water before seven
bells. I’ve a notion it’s just impassible.”
“But he must have something, Mesty.”
“ ever mind the tea, then,” replied Jack, “I’l1 take some
milk.”
“Is it milk massa manes, and the bumboat woman on the
oder side of the bay?”
“We have no milk, Mr. Easy; you forget that we are on
blue water,” replied Jolliffe, “and I really am afraid that
you’ll have to wait till dinner-time. Mesty tells the truth.”
“I tell you what, Massa Yolliife, it just seven bells, and
if the young gentleman would, instead of tay, try a little out
of the coppar, it might keep him asy. It but a little differ-
ence, tay soup and pay soup. Now a bowl of that, with
some nuts and a ﬂourish of pepper, will do him good, any
how.”
“Perhaps the best thing he can take, Mesty; get it as
fast as you can.”
In a few minutes the black brought down a bowl of soup

and whole peas swimming in it, put before our hero a tin
bread-basket full of small biscuit, called midshipmen’s nuts,
and the pepper-castor. Jack’s visions of tea, coffee, mufﬁns,
dry toast, and milk, vanished as he perceived the mess; but
he was very hungry, and he found it much better than he ex-
pected: and he moreover found himself much the better after
he had swallowed it. It struck seven bells, and he accom-
panied Mr. Jolliife on deck.

Showing how Jack transgrcsses against his own Philosophy.
Wnnn Jack Easy had gained the deck, he found the sun
shining gaily, a soft air blowing from the shore, and the
whole of the rigging and every part of the ship loaded with
the shirts, trousers, and jackets of the seamen, which had
been wetted during the heavy gale, and were now hanging
up to dry; all the wet sails were also spread on the booms or
triced up in the rigging, and the ship was slowly’ forging
through the blue water. The captain and ﬁrst-lieutenant
were standing on the gangway in converse, and the majority
of the ofﬁcers were with their quadrants and sextants ascer-
taining the latitude at noon. The decks were white and
clean, the sweepers had just laid by their brooms, and the
men were busy coiling down the ropes. It was a scene of
cheerfulness, activity, and order, which lightened his heart
after the four days of suffering, close air, and conﬁnement,
from which he had just emerged.
The captain, who perceived him, beckoned to him, asked
him kindly how he felt: the ﬁrst-lieutenant also smiled upon
him, and many of the ofﬁcers, as well as his messmates, cou-
gratulated him upon his recovery.
The captain’s steward came up to him, touched his hat,
and requested the pleasure of his company to dinner in the
cabin. Jack was the essence of politeness, took off his hat,
and accepted the invitation. Jack was standing on a rope

MR. MIDSHIPMAN msv. 67
which a seaman was coiling down; the man touched his
hat and requested he would be so kind as to take his foot off.
Jack took his hat oif his head in return, and his foot 011' the
rope. The master touched his hat,‘ and reported twelve
o’clock to the ﬁrst-lieutenant, — the ﬁrst-lieutenant touched
his hat, and reported twelve o’clock to the captain, — the
captain touched his hat, and told the ﬁrst-lieutenant to make
it so. The ofﬁcer of the watch touched his hat, and asked
the captain whether they should pipe to dinner, — the cap-
tain touched his hat and said, — “If you please.”
The midshipman received his orders, and touched his hat,
which he gave to the head boatswain’s mate , who touched his
hat, and then the calls whistled cheerily.
“Well,” thought Jack, “politeness seems to be the order
of the day, and every one has an equal respect for the other."
Jack stayed on deck; he peeped through the ports, which
were open, and looked down into the deep blue wave; he cast
his eyes aloft, and watched the tall spars sweeping and tracing
with their points, as it were, a small portion of the clear sky,
as they acted in obedience to the motion of the vessel; he
looked forward at the range of carronades which lined the
sides of the deck, and then he proceeded to climb one of the
carronades, and lean over the hammocks to gaze on the
distant land.
“Young gentleman, get off those hammocks,” cried the
master, who was ofﬁcer of the watch, in a surly tone.
Jack looked round.
“Do you hear me, sir? I’m speaking to you,” said the
master again.
Jack felt very indignant, and he thought that politeness
was not quite so general as he supposed.
It happened that Captain Wilson was upon deck.
“Come here, Mr. Easy,” said the captain; “it is a rule in
the service, that no one gets on the hammocks, unless in case
of emergency — I never do — nor the ﬁrst-lieutenant — nor
any of the ofﬁcers or men — therefore, upon the principle of
equality, you must not do it either.”

“Certainly not, sir,” replied Jack, “but still I do not see
why that ofﬁcer in the shining hat should be so angry, and
not speak to me as if I were a gentleman, as well as him-
self.”
“I have already explained that to you, Mr. Easy.”
“O yes, I recollect now, it’s zeal: but this zeal appears to
me to be the only unpleasant thing in the service. It’s a pity,
as you said, that the service cannot do without it.”
Captain Wilson laughed, and walked away; and shortly
afterwards, as he turned up and down the deck with the
master, he hinted to him, that he should not speak so sharply
to a lad who had committed such a triﬂing error through
ignorance. Now Mr. Smallsole, the master, who was a surly
sort of a personage, and did not like even a hint of disappro-
bation of his conduct, although very regardless of the feeling
of others, determined to pay this ofl‘ on Jack, the very ﬁrst
convenient opportunity. Jack dined in the cabin, and was
very much pleased to ﬁnd that everyone drank wine with him,
and that everybody at the captain’s table appeared to be on
an equality. Before the dessert had been on the table ﬁve
minutes, Jack became loquacious on his favourite topic; all
the company stared with surprise at such an unheard-of doc-
trine being broached on board of a man-of-war; the captain
argued the point, so as to controvert, without too much of-
fending, Jack’s notions, laughing the whole time that the
conversation was carried on. ‘
It will be observed, that this day may be considered as
the ﬁrst in which Jack really made his appearance on board,
and it also was on this ﬁrst day that Jack made known, at the
captainn’ table, his very peculiar notions. If the company at
the captain’s table, which consisted of the second-lieutenant,
purser, Mr. Jolliife, and one of the midshipmen, were as-
tonished at such heterodox opinions being started in the pre-
sence of the captain, they were equally astonished at the cool,
ood-humoured ridicule with which they were received by
aptain Wilson. The report of J ack’sj boldness, and every
word and Opinion that he had uttered, (of course muchmagni-_ ..

ﬁed,) was circulated that evening through the whole ship; it
was canvassed in the gun-room by the ofﬁcers: it was de-
scanted upon by the midshipmen as they walked the deck; the
captain’s steward held a levee abreast of the ship’s funnel, in
which he narrated this new doctrine. The sergeant of marines
gave his opinion in his berth, that it was damnable. The
boatswain talked over the matter with the other warrant
ofﬁcers, till the grog was all gone, and then dismissed it as
too dry a subject: and it was the general opinion of the ship’s
company, that as soon as they arrived at Gibraltar Bay, our
hero would bid adieu to the service, either by being sentenced
to death by a court-martial, or by being dismissed, and
towed on shore on a grating. Others, who had more of the
wisdom of the serpent, and who had been informed by Mr.
Sawbridge that our hero was a lad who would inherit a large
property, argued differently, and considered that Captain
Wilson had very good reason for being so lenient — and
among them was the second-lieutenant. There were but four
who were well inclined towards Jack, -—- to wit, the captain,
the ﬁrst-lieutenant, Mr. Jolliffe, the one-eycd master’s mate,
and Mephistopheles, the black, who, having heard that J aek
had uttered such sentiments, loved him with all his heart and
soul.
We have referred to the second-lieutenant, Mr. Asper.
This young man had a very high respect for birth, and parti-
cularly for money, of which he had very little. He was the
son of an eminent merchant who, during the time that he was
a midshipman, had allowed him a much larger sum for his
expenses than was necessary or proper; and, during his
career, he found that his full pocket procured him conse-
quence, not only among his own messmates, but also with
many of the ofﬁcers of the ships that he sailed in. A man
who is able and willing to pay a large tavern bill will always
ﬁnd followers — that is, to the tavern; and lieutenants did not
disdain to dine, walk arm-in-arm, and be “hail fellow well
met” with a midshipman, at whose expense they lived during
the time they were on shore. Mr. Asper had just received


## p. 70 (#78) ##############################################

70 MR. mmsmrmsn sssv. ’
his commission and appointment, when his father became a
bankrupt, and the fountain was dried up from which he had
drawn such liberal supplies. Since that, Mr. Asper had felt
that his consequence was gone: he could no longer talk about
the service being a bore, or that he should give it up; he
could no longer obtain that deference paid to his purse, and
not to himself; and he had contracted very expensive habits,
without having any longer the means of gratifying them. It
was therefore no wonder that he imbibed a great respect for
money; and, as he could no longer ﬁnd the means himself, he
was glad to pick up anybody else at whose cost he could in-
dulge in that extravagance and expense to which he had been
so long accustomed, and still sighed for. Now, Mr. Asper
knew that our hero was well supplied with money, as he had
obtained from the waiter the amount of the bill paid at the
Fountain, and he had been waiting for Jack’s appearance on
deck to become his very dearest and most intimate friend.
The conversation in the cabin made him feel assured that
Jack would require and be grateful for support, and he had
taken the opportunity of a walk with Mr. Sawbridge, to offer
to take Jack in his watch. Whether it was that Mr. Saw-
bridge saw through the design of Mr. Asper, or whether he
imagined that our hero would be better pleased with him than
with the master, considering his harshness of department; or
with himself, who could not, as ﬁrst-lieutenant, overlook any
remission of duty, the offer was accepted, and Jack Easy was
ordered,_ as he now entered upon his duties, to keep watch
under Lieutenant Asper.
But not only was this the ﬁrst day that Jack may be said
to have appeared in the service, but it was the ﬁrst day in
which he had entered the midshipman’s berth, and was made
acquainted with his messmates.
We have already mentionedMr. J olliife, the master’s mate,
but we must introduce him more particularly. Nature is
sometimes extremely arbitrary, and never did she show her-
-self more so than in insisting that Mr. J olliffe should have the

most sinister expression of countenance that ever had been
looked upon.
He had suffered martyrdom with the small-pox, which
probably had contracted his lineaments: his face was not
only deeply pitted, but scarred with this cruel disorder. One
eye had been lost, and all eyebrows had disappeared — and
the contrast between the dull, sightless opaque orb on one
side of his face, and the brilliant, piercing little ball on the
other, was almost terrifying. His nose had been eaten away
by the disease till it formed a sharp but irregular point; part
of the muscles of the chin were contracted, and it was drawn
in with unnatural seams and puckers. He was tall, gaunt,
and thin, seldom smiled, and when he did, the smile produced
a still further distortion.
Mr. Jolliffe was the son of a warrant ofﬁcer. He did not
contract this disease until he had been sent out to the West
Indies, where it swept away hundreds. He had now been
long in the service, with little or no chance of promotion. He
had suffered from indigence, from reﬂections upon his humble
birth, from sarcasms on his appearance. Every contumely
had been heaped upon him at one time or another, in the
ships in which he served; among a crowd he had found him-
self desolate — and now, although no one dared treat him to
his face w1th disrespect, he was only respected in the service
frem a knowledge of his utility and exemplary performance
of his duties — he had no friends or even companions. For
many years he had retired within himself, he had improved
by reading and study, had felt all the philanthropy of a
Christian, and extended it towards others. Silent and reserved,
he seldom spoke in the berth, unless his authority, as caterer,
was called for; all respected Mr. Jolliffe, but no one liked, as
a companion, one at whose appearance the very dogs would
bark. At the same time every one acknowledged his correct
behaviourin every point, his sense of justice, his forbearance,
his kindness, and his good sense. With him life was indeed
a pilgrimage, and he wcnded his way in all Christian charity
and all Christian zeal

72 am. MIDSHIPMnN user.
In all societies, however small they may be, provided that
they do but amount to half-a-dozen, you will invariably meet
with a bully. And it is also generally the case that you will
ﬁnd one of that society who is more or less the butt. You
will discover this even in occasional meetings, such as a
dinner party, the major part of which have never met before.
Previous to the removal of the cloth, the bully will have
shown himself by his dictatorial manner, and will also have
selected the one upon whom he imagines that he can best prac-
tise. In a midshipman’s berth, this fact has become almost
proverbial, although now perhaps it is not attended with that
disagreeable despotism which was permitted at the time that
our hero entered the service.
The bully of the midshipman’s berth of H.M. sloop Harpy
was a young man about seventeen, with light, curly hair, and
ﬂorid countenance, the son of the clerk in the dockyard at
Plymouth, and his name was Vigors.
The butt was a pudding-faced Tartar-physiognomied boy
of ﬁfteen, whose intellects, with fostering, if not great, might
at least have been respectable, had he not lost all confrdence
in his own powers from the constant jeers and mockeries of
those who had a greater ﬂuency of speech without perhaps so
much real power of mind. Although slow, what he learnt he
invariably retained. This lad’s name was Gossett. His father
was a wealthy yeoman of Lynn, in Norfolk. There were at
the time but three other midshipmen in the ship, of whom it
can only be said that they were like midshipmen in general,
with little appetite for learning, but good appetites for dinner,
hating everything like work, fond of everything like fun,
ﬁghting ‘a l’out1-ance ’ one minute, and swom friends the next
— with general principles of honour and justice, but which
were occasionally warped according to circumstances; with
all the virtues and vices so heterogeneously jumbled and
heaped together, that it was almost impossible to ascribe any
action to its true motive, and to ascertain to what point thei-
vice was softened down into almost a virtue, and their virtues
from mere excess degenerated into vice. Their names were

O’Connor, Mills, and Gascoigne. The other shipmates of
our hero it will be better to introduce as they appear ion the
stage.
After Jack had dined in the cabin, he followed his mess-
mates Jolliffe and Gascoigne down into the midshipmen’s
berth.
“I say, Easy,” observed Gascoigne, “you are a devilish
free and easy sort of a fellow, to tell the captain that you con-
sidered yourself as great a man as he was.”
“I beg your pardon,” replied Jack, “I did not argue in-
dividually, but generally, upon the principles of the rights of
man.”
“Well,” replied Gascoigne, “it’s the ﬁrst time I ever heard
a middy do such a bold thing; take care your rights of man
don’t get you in the wrong box—there’s no arguing on board
of a man-of-war. The captain took it amazingly easy, but
you’d better not broach that subject too often.”
“Gascoigne gives you very good advice, Mr. Easy,” ob-
served Jolliffe; “allowing that your ideas are correct, which
it appears to me they are not, or at least impossible to be
acted upon, there is such a thing as prudence, and however
much this question may be canvassed on shore, in His Ma-
jesty’s service it is not only dangerous in itself, but will be
very prejudicial to you.”
“Man is a fre agent,” replied Easy.
“I’ll be shot if a midshipman is,” replied Gascoigne,
laughing, “and that you’ll soon ﬁnd.”
“And yet it was the expectation of ﬁnding that equality
that I was induced to come to see.”
“On the ﬁrst of April, I presume,“ replied Gascoigne.
“But are you really serious?”
Hereupon Jack entered into a long argument, to which
Jolliife and Gascoigne listened without interruption, and
Mesty with admiration: at the end of it, Gascoigne laughed
heartily, and Jolliﬂe sighed.
“From whence did you learn all this?” inquired Jolliffe.

“From my father, who is a great philosopher, and has
constantly upheld these opinions.”
“And did your father wish you to go to sea?”
“No, he was opposed to it,” replied Jack, “but of course
he could not combat my rights and free-will.”
“Mr. Easy, as a friend,” replied Jolliife, “I request that
you would as much as possible keep your opinions to your-
self: I shall have an opportunity of talking to you on the
subject, and will then explain to you my reasons.”
As soon as Mr. Jolliffe had ceased, down came Mr. Vigors
and O’Connor, who had heard the news of Jack’s heresy.
“You do not know Mr. Vigors and Mr. O’Connor,” said
Jolliife to Easy.
Jack, who was the essence of politeness, rose and bowed,
at which the others took their seats, without returning the
salutation. Vigors had, from what he had heard and now
seen of Easy, thought he had somebody else to play upon,
and without ceremony he commenced.
“So, my chap, you are come on board to raise a mutiny
here with your equality — you came off scot free at the cap-
tain’s table; but it won’t do, I can tell you, even in the mid-
shipman’s berth: some must knock under, and you are one
of them.”
' “If, sir,” replied Easy, “you mean by knock under, that
I must submit, I can assure you that you are mistaken. Upon
the same principle that I would never play the tyrant to
those weaker than myself, so will I resent oppression if
attempted.”
“Damme, but he’s a regular sea lawyer already: however,
my boy, we’ll soon put your mettle to the proof.”
“Am I then to infer that I am not on an equality with my
messmates?” replied Jack, looking at Jolﬁffe. The latter
was about to answer him, but Vigors interrupted.
“Yes, you are on an equality as far as this, — that you
have an equal right to the berth, if you are knocked out of
it for insolence to your masters; that you have an equal share
to pay for the things purchased for the mess, and an equal

MR. mnsmrmsu iasy. 75
right to have your share, provided you can get it; you have
an equal right to talk, provided you are not told to hold your
tongue. The fact is, you have an equal right with every one
else to do as you can, get what you can, and say what you
can, always provided that you can do it; for here the weakest
goes to the wall, and that is midshipman’s berth equality.
Now, do you understand all that; or will you wait for a
practical illustration?”
“I am then to infer that the equality here is as much
destroyed as it even will be among savages, where the strong
oppress the weak, and the only law is club law — in fact,
much the same as it is at a public or large school, on
shore?”
“I suspect you are right for once. You were at a public
school: how did they treat you there?”
“As you propose treating people here, — ‘the weakest
went to the wall.’ ”
“Well, then, a nod’s as good as a wink to a blind horse:
that’s all, my hearty,” said Vigors.
But the hands being turned up, “Shorten sail” put an
end to the altercation for the present.
As our hero had not yet received orders to go to his duty,
he remained below with Mesty.
"By de powers, Massa Easy, but I lub you with my hole
soul,” said Mesty. “By Jasus, you really tark ﬁne, Massa
Easy; dat Mr. Vigor — nebber care for him, wouldn’t you
lik him — and sure you would,” continued the black, feeling
the muscle of Jack’s arm. “By the soul of my fader, I’d bet
my week’s allowance on you any how. Nebber be ’fraid,
Massa Easy.”
“I am not afraid,” replied Jack; “I’ve thrashed bigger
fellows than he;” and Jack’s assertion was true. Mr. Bonny-
castle never interfered in a fair ﬁght, and took no notice of
black eyes, provided the lessons were well said. Jack had
fought and fought again, until he was a very good bruiser,
and although not so tall as Vigors, he was much better built
for ﬁghting. A knowing Westminster boy would have bet‘

his half-crown upon Jack had he seen him and his anticipated
adversary.
The constant battles which Jack was obliged to ﬁght at
school had been brought forward by Jack against his father’s
arguments in favour of equality, but they had been overruled
by Mr. Easy’s pointing out that the combats of boys had
nothing to do with the rights of man. _
As soon as the watch was called, Vigors , O’Connor, Gos-
sett, and Gascoigne, came down into the berth. Vigors, who
was the strongest in the berth, except Jolliffe, had succes-
sively had his superiority acknowledged, and, when on deck,
he -had talked of Easy’s impertinence, and his intention of
bringing him to his senses. The others, therefore, came
down to see the fun.
“Well, Mr. Easy,” observed Vigors, as he came into the
berth, “you take after your name, at all events; I suppose
you intend to eat the king’s provision, and do nothing.”
Jack’s mettle was already up.
“You will oblige me, sir, by minding your own business,”
replied J ack.
“You impudent blackguard, if you say another word, I’ll
give you a good thrashing, and knock some of your equality
out of -you.”
“Indeed ,” replied Jack, who almost fancied himself back
at Mr. Bonnycastle’s; “we’ll try that.”
Whereupon Jack very coolly divested himself to his upper
garments, neckerchief, and shirt, much to the surprise of Mr.
Vigors, who little contemplated such a proof of decision and
conﬁdence, and still more to the delight of the other mid-
shipmen, who would have forfeited a week’s allowance to see
Vigors well thrashed. Vigors, however, knew that he had
gone too far to retreat; he therefore prepared for action;
and, when ready, the whole party went out into the steerage
to settle the business.
Vigors had gained his assumed authority more by bully-
ing than ﬁghting; others had submitted to him without a suf-
ﬁcient trial; Jack, on the contrary, had won his way up in

MR. MIDSHIPMAN smsv. 77
school by hard and scientiﬁc combat; the result, therefore,
may easily be imagined. In less than a quarter of an hour
Vigors, beaten dead, with his eyes closed, and three teeth
out, gave in: while Jack, after a basin of water, looked as
fresh as ever, with the exception of a few triﬂing scratches.
The news of this victory was soon through the ship; and
before Jack had resumed his clothes it had been told con-
ﬁdentially by Sawbridge to the captain.
“So soon!” said Captain Wilson, laughing; “I expected
that a midshipman’s berth would do wonders; but I did not
expect this yet awhile. This victory is the ﬁrst severe blow
to Mr. Easy’s equality, and will be more valuable than twenty
defeats. Let him now go to his duty, he will soon ﬁnd his
level.”
CHAPTER XI.
In which our Hero proves that all on board should equally sacriﬁce
decency to duty.
Tun success of any young man in a profession very much
depends upon the occurrences at the commencement of his
career, as from those is his character judged, and he is treated
accordingly. Jack had chosen to enter the service at a much
later period than most lads; he was tall and manly for his
age, and his countenance, if not strictly handsome, wore that
expression of honesty and boldness which is sure to please.
His spirit in not submitting to, and meeting, Vigors when he
had hardly recovered from his severe prostration of sea-
sickness, had gained him with the many respect, and with
all, except his antagonist and Mr. Smallsole, goodwill. Instead
of being laughed at by his messmates, he was played with;
for Jol1iife smiled at his absurdities, and attempted to reason
him out of them, and the others liked Jack for himself and
his generosity, and moreover, because they looked up to him
as a protector against Vigors, who had persecuted them all;
for Jack had declared, that as might was right in a midship-
man’s berth, he would so far restore equality, that if he could

not put down those who were the strongest, at all events he
would protect the weak, and, let who would come into the
berth, they must be his master before they should tyrannise
over those weaker than he.
Thus did Jack Easy make the best use that he could of
his strength, and become, as it were, the champion and
security of those who, although much longer at sea and more
experienced than he was, were glad to shelter themselves
under his courage and skill, the latter of which had excited
the admiration of the butcher of the ship, who had been a
pugilist by profession. Thus did Jack at once take the rank
of an oldster, and soon became the leader of all the mischief.
We particularly observe this, because, had it so happened
that our hero had succumbed to Vigors, the case would have
been the very reverse. He then would have had to go
through the ordeal to which most who enter the naval service
are exposed, which cannot be better explained than by com-
paring it to the fagging carried to such an iniquitous extent
in public schools.
Mr. Asper, for his own reasons, made him his companion:
they walked the night watch together, and he listened to all
Jack’s nonsense about the rights of man. And here Mr. Asper
did good without intending it, for, at the same time that he
appeared to agree with Jack, to secure his favour, he cau-
tioned him, and pointed out why this equality could not exist
altogether on board of a man-of-war.
As for himself, he said, he saw no difference between a
lieutenant, or even a captain, and a midshipmen, provided
they were gentlemen: he should choose his friends where he
liked, and despised that power of annoyance which the ser-
vice permitted. Of course, Jack and Mr. Asper were good
friends, especially as, when half the watch was over, to con-
ciliate his good will and to get rid of his eternal arguing, Mr.
Asper would send Jack down to bed.
They were now entering the Straits, and expected to
anchor the next day at Gibraltar, and Jack was forward on
the forecastle, talking with Mesty, with whom he had con-


## p. 79 (#87) ##############################################

rm. mmsmrmm mav. 79
traeted a great friendship, for there was nothing that Mesty
would not have done for Jack, although he had not been three
weeks in the ship; but a little reﬂection will show that it was
natural.
Mesty had been a great man in his own country, he had
suffered all the horrors of a passage in a slave ship; he had
been sold as a slave twice; he had escaped -—- but he found
that the universal feeling was strong against his colour, and
that on board of a man-of-war he was condemned, although
free, to the humblest of ofﬁces.
He had never heard any one utter the sentiments, which
now beat in his own heart, of liberty and equality — we say
now, for when he was in his own country before his captivity,
he had no ideas of equality; no one has who is in power: but
he had been schooled; and although people talked of liberty
and equality at New York, he found that what they preached
for themselves, they did not practise towards others, and that,
in the midst of liberty and equality, he and thousands more
were enslaved and degraded beings.
Escaping to England, he had regained his liberty, but not
his equality; his colour had prevented the latter, and in that
feeling all the world appeared to conspire together against
him, until, to his astonishment, he heard those sentiments
boldly expressed from the lips of Jack, and that in a service
where it was almost tantamount to mutiny. Mesty, whose
character is not yet developed, immediately took a fondness
for our hero, and in a hundred ways showed his attachment.
Jack also liked Mesty, and was fond of talking with him, and
every evening, since the combat with Vigors, they had gener-
ally met in the forecastle to discuss the principles of equality
and the rfghts of man.
The boatswain, whose name was Biggs, was a slight,
dapper, active little man, who, as captain of the foretop, had
shown an uncommon degree of courage in a hurricane, so
much so, as to recommend him to the admiral for promotion.
It was given to him; and after the ship to which he had been
appointed was paid oif, he had been ordered to join H. M.

sloop Harpy. Jack’s conversation with Mesty was interrupted
by the voice of the boatswain, who was haranguing his boy.
“It’s now ten minutes, sir, by my repeater,” said the boat-
swain, “that I have sent for you;” and Mr. Biggs pulled out
a huge silver watch, almost as big as 2. Norfolk turnip. A
Jew had sold him the watch; the boatswain had heard of re-
peaters, and wished to have one. Moses had only shown him
watches with the hour and minute hands; he now produced
one with a second hand, telling him it was a repeater.
“What makes it a repeater?” inquired the boatswain.
“ Common watches,” said the cunning Jew, “only tell the
minutes and hours; but all repeaters tell the seconds.”
The boatswain was satisﬁed — bought the watch, and,
although many had told him it was no repeater, he insisted
that it was, and would call it so.
“I swear,” continued the boatswain, “it’s ten minutes and
twenty seconds by my repeater.”
“If you please, sir,” said the boy, “I was changing my
trousers when you sent for me, and then I had to stow away
my bag again.”
“Silence, sir; I’d have you to know that when you are
sent for by your ofﬁcer, trousers or no trousers, it is your
duty to come up directly.”
“Without trousers, sir!” replied the boy.
“Yes, sir, without trousers; if the captain required me, I
should come without my shirt. Duty before decency.” So
saying, the boatswain lays hold of the boy.
“Surely, Mr. Biggs,” said Jack, “you are not going to
punish that boy for not coming up without his trousers?”
“Yes, Mr. Easy, I am — I must teach him a lesson. We
are bound, now that new-fan led ideas are brought into the
ship, to uphold the dignity 0 the service; and the orders of
an ofﬁcer are not to be delayed ten minutes and twenty se-
conds because a boy has no trousers on.” Whereupon the
boatswain administered several smart cuts with his rattan
upon the boy, proving that it was quite as well that he had
put on his trousers before he came on deck. “There,” said

rm. mnsmrman nssv. 81
Mr. Biggs, “is a lesson for you, you scamp — and, Mr. Easy,
it is a lesson for you also,” continued the boatswain, walking
away with a most consequential air.
“Murder Irish!” said Mesty — “how him cut caper. De
oder day he hawl out de weather ear-ring, and touch him hat
to a midshipman. Sure enough, make um cat laugh.”
The next day the Harpy was at anchor in Gibraltar Bay;
the captain went on shore, directing the gig to be sent for
him before nine o’clock; after which hour the sally-port is
only opened by special permission. There happened to be a
ball given by the ofﬁcers of the garrison on that evening, and
a polite invitation was sent to the ofﬁcers of H. M. sloop
Harpy. As those who accepted the invitation would be de-
tained late, it was not possible for them to come off that
night. And as their services were required for the next day,
Captain Wilson allowed them to remain on shore until seven
o’clock the next morning, at which hour, as there was a large
party, there would be two boats sent for them.
Mr. Asper obtained leave, and asked permission to take
our hero with him; to which Mr. Sawbridge consented. Many
other ofﬁcers obtained leave, and, among others, the boat-
swain, who, aware that his services would be in request as
soon as the equipment commenced, asked permission for this
evening. And Mr. Sawbridge, feeling that he could be better
spared at this than at any other time, consented. Asper and
Jack went to an inn, dined, bespoke beds, and then dressed
themselves for the ball, which was very brilliant, and, from
the company of the ofﬁcers, very pleasant. Captain Wilson
looked on at the commencement, and then returned on board.
Jack behaved with his usual politeness, danced till two
o’clock, and then, as the ball thinned, Asper proposed that
they should fetire. Having once more applied to the refresh-
ment-room, they had procured their hats, and were about to
depart, when one of the ofﬁcers of the garrison asked Jack
if he would like to see a baboon, which had just been brought
down from the rock; and, taking some of the cakes, they re-
paired to the court where the animal was chained down to a
Mr. Midshipnml Easy. 6

82 MR. mnsmrmsn EASY;
small tank. Jack fed the brute till all the cakes were gone,
and then, because he had no more to give him, the baboon
ﬂew at Jack, who, in making his retreat, fell back into the
tank, which was about two feet deep. This was a joke; and
having laughed heartily, they wished the ofﬁcer good night,
and went to the inn.
Now, what with the number of ofﬁcers of the Harpy on
shore, who had all put up at the same inn, and other occu-
pants, the landlord was obliged to put his company into
double and treble-bedded rooms; but this was of little con-
sequence. Jack was shown into a double-bedded room, and
proceeded to undress; the other was evidently occupied, by
the heavy breathing which saluted Jack’s car.
As Jack undressed, he recollected that his trousers were
wet through, and to dry them he opened the window, hung
them out, and then jammed down the window again upon
them, to hold them in their position, after which he turned in
and fell fast asleep. At six o’clock he was called, as he had
requested, and proceeded to dress, but to his astonishment
found the window thrown open and his trousers missing. It
was evident, that his partner in the room had thrown the
window open during the night, and that his trousers, having
fallen down into the street, had been walked oif with by
somebody or another. Jack looked out of the window once
more, and perceived that whoever had thrown open the win-
dow had been unwell during the night. A nice drunken com-
panion I have had, thought Jack; but what’s to be done?
And in saying this, he walked up to the other bed, and per-
ceived that it was tenanted by the boatswain. Well, thought
Jack, as Mr. Biggs has thought proper to lose my trousers, I
think I have a right to take his, or at least the wear of them
to go on board. It was but last night he declared that de-
cency must give way to duty, and that the orders of a supe-
rior ofﬁcer were to be obeyed, with or without garments. I
know he is obliged to be on board, and now he shall try how
he likes to obey orders in his shirt tails. So cogitating, Jack
took the trousers of the boatswain, who still snorcd, although

he had been called, and, putting them on, completed the rest
of his dress, and quitted the room. He went to that of Mr.
Asper, where he found just ready, and, having paid the
bill — for Asper had forgotten his purse — they proceeded
down to the sally-port, where they found other ofﬁcers wait-
ing, sufﬁcient to load the ﬁrst boat, which shoved off, and
they went on board. As soon as he was down below, Jack
hastened to change his trousers, and, unobserved by any one,
threw those belonging to Mr. Biggs on a chair in his cabin,
and, having made a conﬁdant of Mesty, who was delighted,
he went on deck, and waited the issue of the affair.
Before Jack left the hotel, he had told the waiter that
there was the boatswain still fast asleep, and that he must be
roused up immediately; and this injunction was obeyed. The
boatswain, who had drunk too much the night before, and, as
Jack had truly imagined, had opened the window because he
was unwell, was wakened up, and hearing how late it was,
hastened to dress himself. Not ﬁnding his trousers, he rang
the bell, supposing that they had been taken down to be
brushed, and, in the meantime, put on everything else, that
he might lose no time: the waiter who answered the bell,
denied having taken the trousers out of the room, and poor
Mr. Biggs was in a sad quandary. What had become of
them, he could not tell: he had no recollection of having
gone to bed the night before; he inquired of the waiter, who
said that he knew nothing about them — that he was very
tipsy when he came home, and that when he called him, he
had found the window open, and it appeared that he had
been unwell — he supposed that he had thrown his trousers
out of the window. Time ﬂew, and the boatswain was in
despair. “Could they lend him a pair?”
“He would call his master.”
The master of the inn knew very well the difference of
rank between ofﬁcers, and those whom he could trust and
those whom he could not. He sent up the bill by the waiter,
and stated that, for a deposit, the gentleman might have a
pair of trousers. The boatswain felt in his pockets and re-
6*

membered that all his money was in his trousers’ pocket. He
could not only not leave a, deposit, but could not pay his bill.
The landlord was inexorable. It was bad enough to lose his
money, but he could not lose more.
“I shall be tried by a court-martial, by heavens!” ex-
claimed the boatswain. “It’s not far from the sally-port: I’ll
make a run for it, and I can slip into one of the boats and get
another pair of trousers before I report myself as having
come on board;” so making up his mind, the boatswain took
to his heels, and with his check shirt tails streaming in the
wind, ran as hard as he could to where the boat was waiting
to receive him. He was encountered by many, but he only
ran the faster the more they jeered, and, at last, arrived
breathless at his goal, ﬂew down the steps, jumped into the
boat, and squatted on the stern sheets, much to the surprise
of the ofﬁcers and men, who thought him mad. He stated in
a few words that somebody had stolen his trousers during the
night; and as it was already late, the boat shoved off, the
men as well as ofﬁcers convulsed with laughter.
“Have any of you a pea-jacket?” inquired the boatswain
of the men—but the weather was so warm that none of them
had brought a pea-jacket. The boatswain looked round; he
perceived that the ofﬁcers were sitting on a boat-cloak.
“Whose boat-cloak is that?” inquired the boatswain.
“Mine,” replied Gascoigne.
“I trust, Mr. Gascoigne, you will have the kindness to
lend it to me to go up the side with.”
“Indeed I will not,” replied Gascoigne, who would sooner
have thrown it overboard and have lost it, than not beheld
the anticipated fun: “recollect I asked you for a ﬁshing line,
when we were becalmed off Cape St. Vincent, and you sent
word that you’d see me d—d ﬁrst. Now I’ll just see you the
same before you have my boat-cloa .”
“Oh, Mr. Gascoigne, I’ll give you three lines, directly I
get on board.”
“I dare say you will, but that won’t do now. ‘Tit for tat,’
Mr. Boatswain, and hang all favours,” replied Gascoigne,


## p. 85 (#93) ##############################################

MB. mnsmrmsu nssY. 85
who was steering the boat, having been sent on shore for the
others. “In bow — rowed of all.” The boat was laid along-
side—the relentless Gascoigne caught up his boat-cloak as
the other ofﬁcers rose to go on board, and rolling it up, in
spite of the earnest entreaties of Mr. Biggs, tossed it into the
main chains, to the man who had thrown the stern-fast; and
to make the situation of Mr. Biggs still more deplorable, the
ﬁrst-lieutenant was standing looking into the boat, and Cap-
tain Wilson walking the quarter-deck.
“Come, Mr. Biggs, I expected you oﬂ‘ in the ﬁrst boat,”
cried Mr. Sawbridge; “ be as smart as you please, for the
yards are not yet squared.”
“Shall I go ahead in this boat, and square them, sir?”q
“That boat! no; let her drop astern, jump up here and
lower down the dingey. What the devil do you sit there for,
Mr. Biggs? — you’ll oblige me by showing a little more
activity, or, by Jove, you may save yourself the trouble of
asking to go on shore again. Are you sober, sir?”
The last observation decided Mr. Biggs. He sprung up
from the boat just as he was, and touched his hat as he passed
the ﬁrst-lieutenant.
“Perfectly sober, sir, but I’ve lost my trousers.”
“So it appears, sir,” replied Mr. Sawbridge, as Mr. Biggs
stood on the planeshear of the sloop where the hammock net-
ting divides for an entrance, with his shirt tails ﬂuttering in
the sea breeze; but Mr. Sawbridge could not contain himself
any longer; he ran down the ship ladder which led on the
quarter-deck, choked with laughter. Mr. Biggs could not
descend until after Mr. Sawbridge, and the conversation had
attracted the notice of all, and every eye in the ship was
on him.
“What’s all this?” said Captain Wilson, coming to the
gangway.
“Duty before decency,” replied Jack, who stood by
enjoying the joke.
Mr. Biggs recollected the day before — he cast a furious

look at Jack, as he touched his hat to the captain, and then
dived down to the lower deck.
If anything could add to the indignation of the boatswain,
it was to ﬁnd that his trousers had come on board before him.
He now felt that a trick had been played him, and also that
our hero must have been the party, but he could prove no-
thing; he could not say who slept in the same room, for he
was fast asleep when Jack went to bed, and fast asleep when
Jack quitted the room.
The truth of the story soon became known to all the ship,
and “duty before decency” became a bye-word. All that the
boatswain could do he did , which was to revenge himself
upon the poor boy — and Gascoigne and Jack never got any
ﬁshing tackle. The boatswain was as obnoxious to the men
as Vigors, and in consequence of Jack’s known opinions upon
the rights of man, and his having ﬂoored their two greatest
enemies, he became a great favourite with the seamen, and
as all favourites are honoured by them with a sobriquet, our
hero obtained that of Equality Jack,
CHAPTER XII.
In which our Hero prefers going down to going up; a Choice , it is to be
hoped, he will reverse upon a more important Occasion.
Tan next day being Sunday, the hands were turned up to
divisions, and the weather not being favourable, instead of
the service the articles of war were read with all due respect
shown to the same, the captain, ofﬁcers and crew, with their
hats oﬂ in a mizzling rain. J ack, who had been told by the
captain that these articles of war were the rules and regula-
tions of the service, by which the captain, ofﬁcers , and men,
were equally bound, listened to them as they were read by
the clerk with the greatest attention. He little thought that
there were about ﬁve hundred orders from the admiralty
tacked on to them, which, like the numerous codicils of some
wills, contained the most important matter, and to a certain
degree make the will nugatory.


## p. 87 (#95) ##############################################

rm. mnsn1rmau mav. 87
Jack listened very attentively, and, as each article was
propounded, felt that he was not likely to commit himself in
that point, and, although he was rather astonished to ﬁnd
such a positive injunction against swearing, considered quite
a dead letter in the ship, he thought that, altogether, he saw
his way very clear. But to make certain of it, as soon as the
hands had been piped down he begged the clerk to let him
have a copy of the articles.
Now the clerk had three, being the allowance of the ship,
or at least all that he had in his possession, and made some
demur at parting with one; but at last he proposed — “some
rascal,” as he said, having stolen his toothbrush — that if
Jack would give him one he would give him one of the copies
of the articles of war. Jack replied that the one he had in
use was very much worn, and that unfortunately he had but
one new one, which he could not spare. Thereupon the clerk,
who was a very clean personage, and could not bear that his
teeth should be dirty, agreed to accept the one in use, as
Jack could not part with the other. The exchange was made,
and Jack read the articles of war over and over again, till he
thought he was fully master of them.
“Now,” says Jack, “I know what I am to do, and what I
am to expect, and these articles of war I will carry in my
pocket as long as I’m in the service, that is to say, if they
last so long: and provided they do not, I am able to replace
them with another old tooth brush, which appears to be the
value attached to them.”
The Harpy remained a fortnight in Gibraltar Bay, and
Jack had occasionally a run on shore, and Mr. Asper in-
variably went with him to keep him out of mischief; that is
to say, he allowed him to throw his money away on no one
more worthless than himself.
One morning Jack went down in the berth, and found
young Gossett blubbering.
“What’s the matter, my dear Mr. Gossett?” inquired
Jack , who was just as polite to the youngster as he was to
anybody else.

88 Ma. MIDSHIPMAN EASY.
“Vigors has been thrashing me with a r0pe’s end,” replied
Gossett, rubbing his arm and shoulders.
“What for?” inquired Jack.
“Because he says the service is going to hell — (I’m sure
it’s no fault of mine) — and that now all subordination is
destroyed, and that upstarts join the ship who, because they
have a ﬁve-pound note in their pocket, are allowed to do jus\
as they please. He said he was determined to uphold the
service, and then he knocked me down — and when I got up
again he told me that I could stand a little more ~ and then
he took out his colt, and said he was determined to ride the
high horse—and that there should be no Equality Jack in
future.”
“Wel1,” replied Jack.
“And then he colted me for half an hour, and that’s all.”
“By de soul of my fader, but it all for true, Massa Easy -
he larrup um, sure enough — all for noteing, bad luck to him
— I tink,” continued Mesty, “he hab debelish bad memory -
and he want a little more of Equality Jack.”
“And he shall have it too,” replied our hero; “why it’s
against the articles of war, ‘all quarrelling, ﬁghting, &c.’
I say, Mr. Gossett, have you got the spirit of a louse?”
“ Yes ,” replied Gossett.
“Well, then, will you do what I tell you next time, and
trust to me for protection?”
“I don’t care what I do,” replied the boy, “if you will
back me against the cowardly tyrant?”
“Do you refer to me?” cried Vigors, who had stopped at
the door of the berth.
“Say yes,” said Jack.
“Yes, I do,” cried Gossett.
“You do, do you? — well, then, my chick, I must trouble
you with a little more of this,” said Vigors, drawing out his
colt.
“I think that you had bettte not, Mr. Vigors,” observed
Jack.
“Mind your own business, if you please,” returned Vigors

'not much liking the interference. “I am not addressing my
conversation to you , and I will thank you never to interfere
with me. I presume I have a right to choose my own ac-
quaintance, and, depend upon it, it will not be that of a
leveller.”
“All that is at your pleasure, Mr. Vigors,” replied Jack;
“you have a right to choose your own acquaintance, and so
have I a right to choose my own friends, and, further, to
support them. That lad is my friend, Mr. Vigors.”
“ Then,” replied Vigors, who could not help bullying even
at the risk of another combat which he probably intended to
stand, “I shall take the liberty of giving your friend a thrash-
ing;” and he suited the action to the word.
“Then I shall take the liberty to defend my friend,”
replied Jack; “and as you call me a leveller, I’ll tryif I may
not deserve the name” —whereupon Jack placed a blow so
well under the ear, that Mr. Vigors dropped on the deck, and
was not in condition to come to the scratch, even if he had
been inclined. “And now, youngster,” said Jack, wresting
the colt out of Vigors’ hand, “do as I bid you — give him a
good colting —if you don’t l’ll thrash you.”
Gossett required no second threat; — the pleasure of
thrashing his enemy,,if only for once, was quite enough-
and he laid well on. Jack with his ﬁsts doubled ready to
protect him if there was a show of resistance, but Vigors was
half stupiﬁed with the blow under the ear, and quite cowed;
he took his thrashing in the most pensive manner.
“That will do,” said Jack; “and now do not be afraid,
Gossett; the very ﬁrst time he offers to strike you when I am
not present, I will pay him off for it as soon as you tell me.
I won’t be called Equality Jack for nothing.”
When Jolliife , who heard of this, met our hero alone, he
said to him, “Take my advice, boy, and do not in future
ﬁght the battles of others, you’l1 ﬁnd very soon that you will
have enough to do to ﬁght your own.”
Whereupon Jack argued the point for half an hour, and
then they separated. But Mr. Jolliﬂ'e was right. Jack began

to ﬁnd himself constantly in hot water, and the captain and
ﬁrst-lieutenant, although they did not really withdraw their
protection, thought it high time that Jack should ﬁnd out
that, on board a man-of-war, everybody and everything must
ﬁnd its level.
There was on board of His Majesty’s sloop Harpy, a man
of the name of Easthupp, who did the duty of purser’s
steward; this was the second ship that he had served in: in
the former he had been sent with a draft of men from the
Tender lying off the Tower. How he had come into the
service was not known in the present ship; but the fact was,
that he had been one of the swell mob — and had been sent
on board the Tender with a letter of recommendation from
the magistrates to Captain Crouch. He was a cockney by
birth, for he had been left at the workhouse of St. Mary Axe,
where he had been taught to read and write, and had after-
wards made his escape. He joined the juvenile thieves of the
metropolis, had been sent to Bridewell, obtained his liberty,
and by degrees had risen from petty thieving of goods ex-
posed outside of the shops and market-stalls, to the higher
class of gentlemen pickpockets. His appearance was some-
what genteel, with a bullying sort of an impudent air, which
is mistaken for fashion by those who know no better. A re-
markable neat dresser, for that was part of his profession;
a very plausible manner and address; a great ﬂuency of
language, although be clipped the king’s English; and, as
he had suffered more than once by the law, it is not to be
wondered at, that he was, as he called himself, a hout-and-
hout radical. During the latter part of his service, in his last
ship , he had been employed under the purser’s steward, and
having offered himself in this capacity to the purser of H. M.
sloop Harpy, with one or two forged certiﬁcates, he had been
accepted.
Now, when Mr. Easthupp heard of Jack’s opinion, he
wished to cultivate his acquaintance, and with a bow and a
ﬂourish, introduced himself before they arrived at Gibraltar;

but our hero took an immediate dislike to this fellow from his
excessive and impertinent familiarity.
Jack knew a gentleman when he met one, and did not
choose to be a companion to a man beneath him in every way,
but who, upon the strength of Jack’s liberal opinions, pre-
sumed to be his equal. Jack’s equality did not go so far as
that; in theory it was all very well, but in practice it was only
when it suited his own purpose.
But the purser’s steward was not to be checked — a man
who has belonged to the swell mob is not easily repulsed;
and, although Jack would plainly show him that his company
was not agreeable, Easthupp would constantly accost him
familiarly on the forecastle and lower deck, with his arms
folded, and with an air almost amounting to familiarity. At
last, Jack told him to go about his business, and not presume
to talk to him; whereupon Easthupp rejoined, and after an
exchange of hard words, it ended by Jack kicking Mr. East-
hupp, as he called himself, down the after-lowerdeck hatch-
way. This was but a sorry specimen of Jack’s equality— and
Mr. Easthupp, who considered that his honour had been com-
promised, went up to the captain on the quarter-deck and
lodged his complaint — whereupon Captain Wilson desired
that Mr. Easy might be summoned.
As soon as Jack made his appearance, Captain Wilson
called to Easthupp. “Now, purser’s steward, what is this you
have to say?”
“If you please, Captain Vilson, I am wery sorry to be
obliged to make hany complaint of hany hofﬁcer, but this
Mr. Heasy thought proper to make use of language quite
hunbecoming of a gentleman, and then to kick me as I vent
down the atchvay.”
“Well, Mr. Easy, is this true?”
“Yes, sir,” replied Jack; “I have several times told the
fellow not to address himself to me, and he will. I did tell
him he was a radical blackguard, and I did kick him down
the hatchway.
“You told him he was a radical blackguard, Mr. Easy?”

“Yes, sir, he comes bothering me about his republic,
and asserting that we have no want of a king and aristo-
cracy.”
Captain Wilson looked signiﬁcantly at Mr. Sawbridge.
“I certainly did heffer my political opinions, Captain
Vilson; but you must be avare that ve hall ave an hequal
stake in the country — and it’s a Hinglishman’s birthright.”
“I’m not aware what your stake in the country may be,
Mr. Easthupp,” observed Captain \Vilson, “but I think that,
if you used such expressions, Mr. Easy was fully warranted in
telling you his opinion.”
“I ham villing, Captain Vilson, to make hany hallowance
for the eat of political discussion — but that is not hall that I
ave to complain hof. Mr. Heasy thought proper to say that
I was a swindler and a liar.”
“Did you make use of those expressions, Mr. Easy?”
“Yes, sir, he did,” continued the steward; “and, more-
over, told me not to cheat the men, and not to cheat my ,
master, the purser. Now, Captain Vilson, is it not true that
I am in a wery hostensible sitevation? but I ﬂatter myself
that I ave been vell edecated, and vos wonce moving in a
wery different society — misfortains vill appin to us hall, and
I feel my character has been severely injured by such im- -
pertations;” whereupon Mr. Easthupp took out his hand-
kerchief, ﬂourished, and blew his nose. “I told Mr. Heasy,
that I considered myself quite as much of a gentleman as
himself, and at hall hewents did not keep company with a
black feller (Mr. Heasy will understand the insinevation);
vereupon Mr. Heasy, as I before said, your vorship, I mean
you, Captain Vilson, thought proper to kick me down the
atchvay.”
“Very well, steward, I have heard your complaint, and
now you may go.”
Mr. Easthupp took his hat off with an air, made his bow,
and went down the main ladder.
“Mr. Easy,” said Captain Wilson, “you must be aware
that by the regulations of the service by which we are all

equally bound, it is not permitted that any ofﬁcer shall take
the law-into his own hands. Now, although I do not consider
it necessary to make any remark as to your calling the man
a radical blackguard, for I consider his impertinent intrusion
of his opinions deserved it, still you have no right to attack
any man’s character without grounds — and as that man is in
an ofﬁce of trust, you were not at all warranted in asserting
that he was a cheat. VVill you explain to me why you made
use of such language?”
Now our hero had no proofs against the man; he had
nothing to offer in extenuation, until he reeollected, all at
once, the reason assigned by the captain for the language
used by Mr. Sawbridge. Jack had the wit to perceive that
it would hit home, so he replied, very quietly and respect-
fully:
“If you please, Captain Wilson, that was all zeal.”
“Zeal, Mr. Easy? I think it but a bad excuse. But pray,
then, why did you kick the man down the hatchway—you
‘ must have known that that was contrary to the rules of the
service.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, demurely; “but that was all zeal,
too.”
“Then allow me to say,” replied Captain Wilson, biting
his lips, “that I think that your zeal has in this instance been
very much misplaced, and I trust you will not show so much
again.”
“And yet, sir,” replied Jack, aware that he was giving
the captain a hard hit, and therefore looked proportionally
humble, “we should do nothing in the service without it—-
and I trust one day, as you told me, to become a very zealous
ofﬁcer.”
“I trust so, too, Mr. Easy,” replied the captain. “There,
you may go now, and let me hear no more of kicking people
down the hatchway. That sort of zeal is misplaced.”
“More than my foot was, at all events,” muttered Jack, as
he walked oif,
- Captain Wilson, as soon as our hero disappeared, laughed

heartily, and told Mr. Sawbridge, “he had ascribed his
language to our hero as all zeal. He has very cleverly given
me it all back again; and really, Sawbridge, as it proves how
weak was my defence of you, you may gain from this les-
son ”
Sawbridge thought so, too — but both agreed that Jack’s
rights of man were in considerable danger.
The day before the ship sailed, the captain and Mr. Asper
dined with the governor; and as there was little more to do,
Mr. Sawbridge, who had not quitted the ship since she had
been in port, and had some few purchases to make, left her
in the afternoon in the charge of Mr. Smallsole, the master.
Now, as we have observed, he was Jack’s inveterate enemy
—indeed Jack had already made three, Mr. Smallsole, Mr.
Biggs, the boatswain, and Easthupp, the purser’s steward.
Mr. Smallsole was glad to be left in command, as he hoped
to have an opportunity of punishing our hero, who certainly
laid himself not a little open to it.
Like all those who are seldom in command, the master was
proportionally tyrannical and abusive — he swore at the men,
made them do the duty twice and thrice over, on the pretence
that it was not smartly done, and found fault with every of-
ﬁcer remaining on board.
“Mr. Biggs— by God, sir, you seem to be all asleep for-
ward. I suppose you think that you are to do nothing now
the ﬁrst-lieutenant is out of the ship? How long will it be,
sir, before you are ready to sway away?”
“By de holy poker, I tink he sway away ﬁnely, Massy
Easy,” observed Mesty, who was in converse with our hero
on the forecastle.
Mr. Smallsole’s violence made Mr. Biggs violent, which
made the boatswain’s mate violent—— and the captain of the
forecastle violent also; all which is practically exempliﬁed by
philosophy in the laws of motion, communicated from one
body to another; and as Mr. Smallsole swore, so did the
boatswain swear. Also the boatswain’s mate, the captain

of the forecastle, and all the men — showing the force of ex-
ample.
Mr. Smallsole eame forward.
“Damnation, Mr. Biggs, what the devil are you about?
Can’t you move here?”
“As much as we can,sir,”replied the boatswain,“lumbered
as the foreeastle is with idlers.” And here Mr. Biggs looked
at our hero and Mesty, who were standing against the bul-
wark.
“What are you doing here, sir?” cried Mr. Smallsole to
our hero.
“Nothing at all, sir,” replied Jack.
“Then I’ll give you something to do, sir. Go up to the
mast-head, and wait there till I call you down. Come, sir, I’ll
show you the way,” continued the master, walking aft. Jack
followed till they were on the quarter-deck.
“Now, sir, up to the main-top gallant mast-head; perch
yourself upon the cross-trees — up with you.”
“What am I to go up there for, sir?” inquired Jack.
“For punishment, sir,” replied the master.
“What have I done, sir?”
“No reply, sir, — up with you.”
“If you please, sir,” replied Jack, “I should wish to argue
this point a little.”
“Argue the point!” roared Mr. Smallsole —“By Jove, I’ll
teach you to argue the point -—- away with you, sir.”
“If you please, sir,” continued Jack, “the captain told me
that the articles of war were the rules and regulations by
which every one in the service was to be guided. Now, sir,”
said Jack, “I have read them over till I know them by heart,
and there is not one word of mast-heading in the whole of
them.” Here Jack took the articles out of his pocket, and
unfolded them.
“Will you go to the mast-head, sir, or will you not?” said
Mr. Smallsole.
“Will you show-me the mast-head in the articles of war,
sir,” replied Jack; “here they are.”

“I tell you, sir, to go to the mast-head: if not, I’ll be d—d
if I don’t hoist you up in a bread-bag.”
“ There’s nothing about bread-bags in the articles of war,
sir,” replied Jack; “but I’ll tell you what there is, sir; ” and
Jack commenced reading, —
“All ﬂag-ofﬁcers, and all persons in or belonging to his
majesty’s ships or vessels of war, being guilty of profane
oaths, execrations, drunkenness, uncleanness, or other scan-
dalous actions, in derogation of God’s honour, and corruption
of good manners, shall incur such punishment as ”
“Damnation,” cried the master, who was mad with rage,
hearing that the whole ship’s company were laughing.
“No, sir, not damnation,” replied Jack, “that’s when he’s
tried above; but according to the nature and degree of the
offence.”
“Will you go to the mast-head, sir, or will you not?”
“If you please,” replied Jack, “I’d rather not.”
“Then, sir, consider yourself under an arrest —I’ll try
you by a court-martial, by God. Go down below, sir.”
“With the greatest pleasure, sir,” replied Jack, “that’s
all right and according to the articles of war which are to
guide us all.” Jack folded up his articles of war, put them
into his pocket, and went down into the berth.
Soon after Jack had gone down, Jolliife, who had heard
the whole of the altercation, followed him: “My lad,” said
Jolliife, “I’m sorry for all this; you should have gone to the
mast-head.”
“ I should like to argue that point a little,” replied Jack.
“Yes, so would everybody; but if that were permitted,
the service would be at a stand-still — that would not do; —
you must obey an order ﬁrst, and then complain afterwards,
if the order is unjust.”
“It is not so in the articles of war.”
“But it is so in the service.”
“The captain told me that the articles of war were the
guides of the service, and we were all equally bound to obey
them.”

MR. MIDSHIPMAN msv. 97
“Well, but allowing that, I do not think your articles of
war will bear you out. You observe, they say any ofﬁcer,
mariner, &c., guilty of disobedience to any lawful command.
Now are you not guilty under that article?”
“That remains to be argued still,” replied Jack. “A law-
ful command means an order established by law; now where
is that law?—besides, the captain told me when I kicked
that blackguard down the hatchway, that there was only the
captain who could punish, and that ofﬁcers could not take
the law into their own hands; why then has the master?”
“His doing wrong as superior ofﬁcer is no reason why
you as an inferior should disobey him. If that were per-
mitted, — if every order were to be cavilled at, and argued
upon, as just or unjust, there would be an end of all dis-
cipline. Besides, recollect that in the service there is custom,
which is the same as law.”
“That admits of a little argument,” replied Jack.
“The service will admit of none, my dear boy: recollect
that, even on shore, we have two laws, that which is written,
and the ‘lex non scripta,’ which is custom; of course we have
it in the service for the articles of war cannot provide for
everything.”
“They provide a court-martial for everything though,”
replied Jack.
“You, with death or dismissal from the service — neither
of which would be very agreeable. You have got yourself
into-a scrape, and although the captain is evidently your
friend, he cannot overlook it: fortunately, it is with the
master, which is of less consequence than with the other
ofﬁcers; but still you will have to submit, for the captain
cannot overlook it.”
“I’ll tell you what, Jollifi'e,” replied Jack, “my eyes now
begin to be opened to a great many things. The captain
tells me, when I am astonished a bad language, that it is all
zeal, and then I found out that what is all zeal in a superior
to an inferior, is insolence when reversed. He tells me, that
the articles of war are made to equally guide us all—th6

master breaks what is positively mentioned in the second
article twenty times over, and goes scot free, while I am to
be punished, because I do not comply with what the articles
do not mention. How was I to know that I ought to go to
the mast-head for punishment? particularly when the captain
tells me that he alone is to punish in the ship. If I obey an
order in opposition to the captain’s order, is not that as bad
as disobeying the captain? I think that I have made out a.
very strong case, and my arguments are not to be con-
futed.”
“I’m afraid that the master will make out a very strong
case, and that your arguments will never be heard.”
“That will be contrary to all the rules of justice.”
“But according to all the rules of service.”
“I do believe thatl am a great fool,” observed Jack, after
a pause. “What do you imagine made me come to sea,
Jolliife?”
“Because you did not know when you were well off,” re-
plied the mate, drily.
‘‘That’s true enough; but my reason was, because I
thought I should ﬁnd that equality here that I could not ﬁnd
on shore.”
Jolliffe stared.
“My dear boy, I heard you say that you obtained those
opinions from your father; I mean no disrespect to him, but
he must be either mad or foolish, it at his age he has not
discovered, that there is no such thing in existence.”
“I begin to think so,” replied Jack; “but that does not
prove that there ought not to be.”
“I beg your pardon; the very non-existence proves that
it ought not to be — ‘whatever is, is right,’ — you might as
well expect to ﬁnd perfect happiness or perfection in the in-
dividual. Your father must be a visionary!”
“The best thing that I can do is to go home again.”
“No, my dear Easy, the best thing that you can do is, to
stay in the service, for it will soon put an end to all such
nonsensical ideas; and it will make you a clever, sensible

fellow. The service is a rough, but a good school, where
everybody ﬁnds his level, — not the level of equality, but the
level which his natural talent and acquirements will rise or
sink him to, in proportion as they are plus or minus. It is a
noble service, but has its imperfections, as everything in this
world must have. I have little reason to speak in its favour,
as far as I am concerned, for it has been hard bread to me;
but there must be exceptions in every rule. Do not think of
quitting the service until you have given it a fair trial. I am
aware that you are an only son, and your father is a man of
property, and, therefore, in the common parlance of the world,
you are independent: but, believe me, no man, however rich,
is independent, unless he has a profession, and you will ﬁnd
no better than this, notwithstanding ——”
“ What?”
“That you will be, most certainly, sent to the mast-head
to-morrow.”
“We’ll argue that point,” replied Jack; “at all events, I
will go and turn in to-night.”
CHAPTER XIII.
In which our Hero begins to act and think for himself.
Wmrnvnn may have been Jack’s thoughts, at all events
they did not spoil his rest. He possessed in himselfall the
materials of a true philosopher, but there was a great deal of
weeding still required. JolliﬂE'e’s arguments, sensible as they
were, had very little effect upon him; for, strange to say, it
is much more easy to shake a man’s opinions when he is
wrong, than when he is right; proving that we are all of a
very perverse nature. “ Well,” thought Jack, “if I am to go
to the mast-head, I am, that’s all; but it does not prove that
my arguments are not good, only that they will not be listened
to;” and then Jack shut his eyes, and in a few minutes was
fast asleep.
The master had reported to the ﬁrst-lieutenant, and the

ﬁrst-lieutenant to the captain, when he came on board the
next morning, the conduct of Mr. Easy, who was sent for in
the cabin, to hear if he had anything to offer in extenuation
of his offence. Jack made an oration, which lasted more
than half an hour, in which all the arguments he had brought
forward to Jolliffe in the preceding chapter were entered
fully into. Mr. Jolliffe was then examined, and also Mr.
Smallsole was interrogated: after which the captain and the
ﬁrst-lieutenant were left alone.
“Sawbridge,” said Captain Wilson, “how true it is, that
any deviation from what is right invariably leads us into a
scrape. I have done wrong: wishing to get this boy out of his
father’s hands, and fearful that he would not join the ship,
and imagining him to be by no means the shrewd fellow that
he is in reality, I represented the service in a much more
favourable light than I should have done; all that he says
I told him I did tell him, and it is I who really led the boy
into error. Mr. Smallsole has behaved tyrannically and
unjustly; he punished the lad for no crime; so that between
the master and me, I am now on the horns of a dilemma, If
I punish the boy, I feel that I am punishing him more for my
own fault and the fault of others, than his own. If I do not
punish him, I allow a ﬂagrant and open violation of discipline
to pass uncensured, which will be injurious to the service.”
“He must be punished, sir,” replied Sawbridge.
“ Send for him,” said the captain.
Jack made his appearance, with a very polite bow.
“Mr. Easy, as you suppose that the articles of war con-
tained all the rules and regulations of the service, I take it
for granted that you have erred through ignorance. But re-
collect, that although you have erred through ignorance, such
a violation of discipline, if passed unnoticed, will have a very
injurious eifect with the men, whose obedience is enforced
by the example shown to them by the ofﬁcers. I feel so con-
vinced of your zeal, which you showed the other day in the
case of Easthupp , that I am sure you will see the propriety
of my proving to the men, by punishing you, that discipline

must be enforced, and I shall therefore send for you on the
quarter-deck, and order you to go to the mast-head in pres-
ence of the ship’s company, as it was in presence of the ship’s
company that you refused.”
“With the greatest pleasure, Captain Wilson,” replied
Jack.
“And in future, Mr. Easy, although I shall ever set my
face against it, recollect that if any offfiee punishes you, and
you imagine that you are unfairly treated, you will submit to
the punishment, and then apply to me for redress.”
“Certainly, sir,” replied Jack, “now that I am aware of
your wishes.”
“You will oblige me, Mr. Easy, by going on the quarter-
deck, and wait there till I come up.”
Jack made his best bow, and exit.
“Old Jolliffe told me that I should have to go,” said Jack
to himself, “and he was right, so far; but hang me if I
hadn’t the best of the argument, and that’s all I care
about.”
Captain Wilson sent for the master, and reprimanded him
for his oppression, as it was evident there was no ground for
punishment, and he forbade him ever to mast-head another
midshipman, but to report his conduct to the ﬁrst-lieutenant
or himself. He then proceeded to the quarter-deck, and,
calling for Mr. Easy, gave him what appeared to be a very
severe reprimand, which Jack looked upon very quietly,
because it was all zeal on the captain’s part to give it, and all
zeal on his own to take it. Our hero was then ordered up to
the masthead.
Jack took off his hat, and took three or four steps, in
obedience to the order—and then returned and made his
best bow—inquired of Captain Wilson whether he wished
him to go to the fore or to the main-mast head.
“ To the main, Mr. Easy,” replied the captain, biting his
lips.
Jack ascended three spokes of the Jacob’s ladder, when
he again stopped, and took 05 his hat.

“I beg your pardon, Captain Wilson — you have not in-
formed me whether it was your wish that I should go to the
topmast, or the top-gallant cross-trees.”
“To the top-gallant cross-trees, Mr. Easy,“ replied the
captain.
Jack ascended, taking it very easy; he stopped at the
main-top for breath; at the main-topmast head, to look about
him; and, at last, gained the spot agreed upon, where he
seated himself, and, taking out the articles of war, commenced
them again, to ascertain whether he could not have streng-
thened his arguments. He had not, however. read through the
seventh article before the hands were turned up — “Up
anchor!” and Mr. Sawbridgc called, “All hands down from
aloft!” Jack took the hint, folded up his documents, and
came down as leisurely as he went up. Jack was a much
better philosopher than his father.
The Harpywas soon under way, and made all sail, steering
for Cape de Gatte, where Captain Wilson hoped to pick up a
Spanish vessel or two, on his way to Toulon to receive orders
of the admiral.
A succession of light breezes and calms rendered the pas-
sage very tedious; but the boats were constantly out, chasing
the vessels along shore, and Jack usually asked to be em-
ployed on this service: indeed, although so short a time
aﬂoat, he was, from his age and strength, one of the most
effective midshipmen, and to be trusted, provided a whim
did not come into his head; but hitherto Jack had always
been under orders, and had always acquitted himself very
well.
When the Harpy was at Tarragona, it so happened that
there were several cases of dysenteryin the ship,and Mr. Asper
and Mr. J olliffe were two of those who were suffering. This re-
duced the number of ofﬁcers; and, at the same time, they had
received information from the men of a ﬁshing-boat, who, to
obtain their own release, had given the intelligence that a
small convoy was coming down from Rosas as soon as the
wind was fair, under the protection of two gun-boats.

Captain Wilson kept well off-shore until the wind changed,
and then, allowing for the time that the vessels would take to
run down the distance between Tarragona and Rosas, steered
in the night to intercept them; but it again fell calm, and the
boats were therefore hoisted out, with directions to proceed
along the shore, as it was supposed that the vessels could not
now be far distant. Mr. Sawbridge had the command of the
expedition in the pinnace; the ﬁrst cutter was in charge of
the gunner, Mr. Minus; and, as the other ofﬁcers were sick,
Mr. Sawbridge, who liked Jack more and more every day, at
his particular request gave him the command of the second
cutter. As soon as he heard of it, Mesty declared to our hero
that he would go with him; but without permission that was
not possible. Jack obtained leave for Mesty to go in lieu of
a marine: there were many men sick of the dysentery, and
Mr. Sawbridge was not sorry to take an idler out of the ship
instead of a working man, especially as Mesty was known to
be a good hand.
It was ten o’clock at night when the boats quitted the ship;
and, as it was possible that they might not return till late
the next day, one day’s biscuit and rum were put on board
each, that the crews might not suffer from exhaustion. The
boats pulled in shore, and then coasted for three hours with-
out seeing anything: the night was ﬁne overhead, but there
was no moon. It still continued calm, and the men began to
feel fatigued, when, just as they were within a mile of a low
point, they perceived the convoy over the land, coming down
with their sails squared, before a light breeze.
Mr. Sawbridge immediately ordered the boats to lie upon
their oars, awaiting their coming, and arranging for the at-
tack.
The white latteen sails of the gun-boat in advance were
now plainly distinguishable from the rest, which were all
huddled together in her wake. Down she came like a beauti-
ful swan in the water, her sails just ﬁlled with the wind, and
running about three knots an hour. Mr. Sawbridge kept her
three masts in one, that they might not be perceived, and

winded the boats with their heads the same way, so that they
might dash on board of her with a few strokes of the oars.
So favourable was the course of the gum-boat, that she stood
right between the launch on one bow, and the two cutters on
the other; and they were not perceived until they were actu-
ally alongside; the resistance was triﬂing, but some musket:
and pistols had been ﬁred, and the alarm was given. Mr.
Sawbridge took possession, with the crew of the launch, and
brought the vessel to the wind, as he perceived that at the
alarm all the convoy had done the same, directing the cutters
to board the largest vessels, and secure as many as they could,
while he would do the same with the launch, as he brought
them to: but the other gun-boat, which had not yet been seen,
and had been forgotten, now made her appearance, and
came down in a gallant manner to the support of her com-
rade.
Mr. Sawbridge threw half his men into the launch, as she
carried a heavy carronade, and sent her to assist the cutters,
which had made right for the gun-boat. A smart ﬁring of
round and grape was opened upon the boats, which continued
to advance upon her; but the ofﬁcer commanding that gun-
boat, ﬁnding that he had no support from his consort, and
concluding that she had been captured, hauled his wind again,
and stood out in the ofﬁng. Our hero pulled after her, al-
though he could not see the other boats; but the breeze had
freshened, and all pursuit was useless: he therefore directed
his course to the convoy, and, after a hard pull, contrived to
get on board of a one-masted xebeque, of about ﬁfty tons.
Mesty, who had eyes as sharp as a needle, had observed that
when the alarm was given, several of the convoy had not
rounded the point, and he therefore proposed, as this vessel
was very light, that they should make short tacks with her,
to weather the point, as if they were escaping, and by that
means be able, particularlyif it fell calm again, to capture some
others. Jack thought this advice good. The convoy who
had rounded the point had all stood out to seaward with the
gun-boat, and had now a fresh breeze. To chase them was

MR. mnsuImnm nssv. 105
therefore useless; and the only chance was to do as Mesty
had proposed. He therefore stood out into the breeze, and,
after half an hour, tacked in shore, and fetched well to wind-
ward of the low point; but, ﬁnding no vessels, he stood out
again. Thus had he made three or four tacks, and had
gained, perhaps, six or seven miles, when he perceived signals
of recall made to leeward, enforced with guns.
“Mr. Sawbridge wants us to come back, Mesty.”
“Mr. Sawbridge mind him own business,” replied Mesty,
“we nebber take all dis trubble to ply to windward for no-
tin _H
g“But, Mesty, we must obey orders.”
“Yes, sar, when he have him thumb upon you; but now,
must do what tink most proper. By de powers, he catch me
‘fore I go back.” .
“But we shall lose the ship.”
“Find her again, by-and-bye, Massa Easy.”
“But they will think that we are lost.”
“So much the better, nebba look after us, Massa Easy;
I guess we have a ﬁne cruise any how. Morrow we take large
vessel — make sail, take more, den we go to Toulon.”
“But I don’t know my way to Toulon; I know it lies up
this way, and that’s all.”
“Dat enough, what you want more? Massa Easy, ’pose
you not ﬁnd ﬂeet, ﬂeet soon ﬁnd you. By God, nobody nebba
lost here. Now, Massa Easy, let um go ‘bout gain. Some-
body else burn biscuit and boil kettle to-morrow for de gen-
tlemen. Murder Irish! only tink, Massa Easy — I boil kettle,
and prince in my own country!”
Easy was very much of a mind with Mesty; “for,” argued
Jack, “if I go back now, I only bring a small vessel half full
of beans, and I shall be ashamed to show my face. Now it
is true, that they may suppose that we have been sunk by the
ﬁre of the gun-boat. Well, what then? they have a gum-boat
to show for their night’s work, and it will appear that there
was harder ﬁghting than there has been, and Mr. Sawbridge
may beneﬁt by it.” (Jack was a very knowing fellow to have

106 MR. MIDSHIPMAN msv.
learnt so much about the service already.) “Well, and when
they discover that we are not lost, how glad they will be to
ﬁnd us, especially if we bring some prizes — which I will do,
or I’ll not go back again. It’s not often that one gets a com-
mand before being two months at sea, and, hang me, now
I’ve got it if I won’t keep it; and Mr. Smallsole may mast-
head whom he pleases. I’m sorry for poor Gossett though;
if Vigors supposes me dead, how he will murder the poor
little fel1ow—however, it is all for the good of the service,
and I’ll revenge him when I come back. Hang me if I won’t
take a cruise.”
“I talk to the men, they say they all tick to you like
leech. Now dat job settled, I tink we better go ’bout
aga1n.” .
A short time after this decision on the part of our hero,
the day broke: Jack ﬁrst looked to leeward, and perceived
the gun-boat and convoy standing in for the shore about ten
miles distant, followed by the Harpy, under all sail. He could
also perceive the captured gun-boat lying-to in shore to pre-
vent their escape.
“Harpy hab um all, by Gosh!” cried Mesty, “I ab notion
dat she soon settle um hash.”
They were so busy looking at the Harpy and the convoy,
that, for some time, they quite forgot to look to windward.
At last Mesty turned his eyes that way.
“Dam um, I see right last night; look, Massa Easy— one
chip, one brig tree 1ateen— dem for us. By de power, but
we make bon prize to-night.”
The vessels found out by Mesty were not above three
miles to windward; they were under all sail, beating up for
the protection of a battery, not far distant.
“Now, Massa, suppose they see our boat, dey tink some-
thing; keep boat alongside, and shift her when we go ‘bout
every time: better not sail so fast now — keep further oif till
they drop anchor for de night; and den, when it dark, we
take ’em.”
All Mesty’s advice was good , with the exception perhaps


## p. 107 (#115) ############################################

MR. MIDSHIPMAN msv. 107
of advising our hero how to disobey orders and take a cruise.
To prevent the vessel from approaching too near the others,
and at the same time to let her have the appearance of doing
her best, a sail was towed overboard under the bows, and after
that they watched the motions of the Harpy.
The distance was too great to distinguish very clearly,
but Mesty shinned up the mast of the vessel, and reported
progress.
“By Jesus, dare one gun — two gun — go it, Harpy.
Won’t she ab um, sure enough. Now gun-boat ﬁre — dat
our gun-boat—no, dat not ours. Now our gun-boat ﬁre —
dat pretty — ﬁre away. Ah, now de Harpy cum up. All
’mung ’em. Bung, bung, bung—rattle de grape, by gosh.
I ab notion de Spaniard is very pretty considerable trouble
just now, any how. All hove to, so help me gosh — not more
ﬁring; Harpy take um all — dare gun-boat hove-to, she strike
um colours. By all powers, but suppose dey tink we no share
prize-money — they ﬁnd it not little mistake. Now, my lads,
it all over, and,” continued Mesty, sliding down the mast, “I
tink you better not show yourself too much; only two men
stay on deck, and dem two take off um jackets.”
Mesty’s report was correct; the Harpy had captured the
other gun-boat, and the whole convoy. The only drawback
to their good fortune was the disappearance of Mr. Easy and
the cutter: it was supposed that a shot from the gun-boat
must have -sunk her, and that the whole crew were drowned.
Captain Wilson and Mr. Sawbridge seriously regretted the
loss of our hero, as they thought that he would have turned
out a shining character as soon as he had sown his wild oats;
so did Mr. Asper, because our her0’s purse went with him;
so did J olliife, because he had taken an affection for him; so
did little Gossett, because he anticipated no mercy from
Vigors. On the other hand, there were some who were glad
that he was gone; and as for the ship’s company in general,
they lamented the loss of the poor cutter’s crew for twenty-
four hours, which, in a man-of-war, is a very long while, and
then they thought no-more about them. We must leave the

Harpy to make the best of her way to Toulon, and now fol-
low our hero.
The cutter’s crew knew very well that Jack was acting
contrary to orders, but any thing was to them a change from
the monotony of a man-of-war; and they, as well as Mesty,
highly approved of a holiday.
It was, however, necessary that they should soon proceed
to business, for they had but their allowance of bread and
grog for one day, and in the vessel they found nothing ex-
cept a few heads of garlic, for the Spaniards coasting down
shore had purchased their provisions as they required them.
There were only three prisoners on board, and they had been
put down in the hold among the beans; 9. bag of which had
been roused on deck, and a part put into the kettle to make
soup. Jack did not much admire the fare of the ﬁrst day —
it was bean-soup for breakfast; bean-soup for dinner, and if
you felt hungry during the intervals it was still bean-soup, and
nothing else.
One of the men could speak a little Lingua Franca, and
the prisoners were interrogated as to the vessels to windward.
The ship was stated to be valuable, and also one of the brigs.
The ship carried guns, and that was all that they knew about
them. As the sun went down the vessels dropped their
anchors off the battery. The breeze continued light, and the
vessel which contained Jack and his fortunes was about four
miles to leeward. As for the Harpy, they had long lost sight
of her, and it was now time to proceed to some arrangement.
As soon as it was dark Jack turned his hands up and made a
very long speech. He pointed out to the men that his zeal
had induced him not to return to the ship until he had brought
something with him worth having — that they had had no-
thing but beans to eat during the whole day, which was any-
thing but agreeable, and that, therefore, it was absolutely
necessary that they should better their condition: that there
was a large ship not four miles oif, and that he intended to
take her; and as soon as he had taken her he intended to take
some more; that be trusted to their zeal to support him on

this occasion, and that he expected to do a great deal during
the cruise. He pointed out to them, that they must consider
themselves as on board of a man-of-war, and be guided by
the articles of war, which were written for them all—-and
that in case they forgot them, he had a. copy in his pocket,
which he would read to them to-morrow morning, as soon as
they were comfortably settled on board of the ship. He then
appointed Mesty as ﬁrst-lieutenant; the marine as sergeant;
the cockswain as boatswain; two men as midshipmen to keep
watch; two others as boatswain’s mates, leaving two more for
the ship’s company, who were divided into the larboard and
starboard watch. The cutter’s crew were perfectly content
with Jack’s speech, and their brevet rank, and after that,
they commenced a more important topic, which was, how
they were to take the ship. After some discussion, Mesty’s
advice was approved of; which was, that they should anchor
not far ahead of the ship, and wait till about two o’clock in
the morning, when they would drop silently down upon her
in the cutter, and take possession.
About nine o’clock the vessel was anchored as they pro-
posed, and Jack was a little astonished to ﬁnd that the ship
was much larger than he had any idea of; for, although
polacca-rigged, she was nearly the same tonnage as the
Harpy. The Spanish prisoners were ﬁrst tied hand and foot,
and laid upon the beans, that they might give no alarm, the
sails were furled and all was kept quiet.
On board of the ship, on the contrary, there was noise and
revelry; and about half-past ten a boat was seen to leave
her and pull for the shere; after which, the noise gradually
ceased, the lights one by one disappeared, and then all was
silent.
“What do you think, Mesty?” said Jack; “do you think
we shall take her?”
“ It is take her you mane; sure enough we’ll take her: stop
a bit— wait till um all fast asleep.”
About twelve o’clock there came on a mizzling heavy rain,
which was very favourable for our hero’s operations. But as

it promised soon to clear up, by Mesty’s advice they did not
delay any longer. They crept softly into the boat, and with
two oars to steer her, dropped under the bows of the vessel,
climbed up the fore chains, and found the deck empty. “ Take
care not ﬁre pistol,” said Mesty to the men, as they came up,
putting his ﬁnger to their lips to impress them with the ne-
cessity of silence, for Mesty had been an African warrior, and
knew the advantage of surprise. All the men being on deck,
and the boat made fast, Jack and Mesty led the way aft; not
a soul was to be seen: indeed, it was too dark to see anybody
unless they were walking the deck. The companion-hatch
was secured, and the gratings laid on the after-hatchways,
and then they went aft to the binnacle again, where there
was a light burning. Mesty ordered two of the men to go
forward to secure the hatches, and then to remain there on
guard -—— and then the rest of the men and our hero consulted
at the wheel.
“By the power we ab the ship!” said Mesty, “ but must
manage plenty yet. I tink der some d—n lazy rascal sleep
’tween the guns. A lilly while it no rain, and den we see
better. Now keep all quiet.”
“There must be a great many men in this ship ,” replied
our hero; “she is very large, and has twelve or fourteen guns
— how shall we manage to secure them?”
“All right,” replied Mesty, “manage all dat by-and-bye.
Don’t care how soon daylight come.”
“It has left oif raining already,” observed Easy; “there
is a candle in the binnacle, — suppose we light it, and look
round the decks.”
“Yes,” replied Mesty, “one man sentry over cabin-hatch,
and another over after-hatch. Now den we light candle, and
all the rest go round the deck. Mind you leave all your
pistols on capstern.”
Jack lighted the candle, and they proceeded round the
decks: they had not walked far, when, between two of the
guns, they discovered a heap covered with gregos. “There

de watch ,"’ whispered Mesty; “all fast — not ready for
dem yet.”
Mesty blew out the candle, and they all retreated to the
binnacle, where Mesty took out a coil of the ropes about the
mizen-mast, and cutting it into lengths, gave them to the
other men to unlay. In a few minutes they had prepared a
great many seizings to tie the men with.
“Now den we light candle again, and make sure of them
lazy hounds,” said Mesty; “very much oblige to dem all de
same; they let us take de ship — mind now, wake one at a
time, and shut him mouth.”
“But suppose they get their mouths free and cry out?”
replied Jack.
“Den, Mr. Easy,” replied Mesty, changing his countenance
to an expression almost demoniacal— “there no help for it,”
— and Mesty showed his knife which he held in his right
hand.
“Oh no! do not let us murder them.”
“No, massa — suppose can help it; but suppose they get
upper hand— what become of us? Spaniards hab knives,
and use dem too, by de power!”
The observation of Mesty was correct, and the expression
of his countenance when he showed his knife proved what a
relentless enemy he could be, if his blood was once roused-
but Mesty had ﬁgured in the Ashantee wars in former days,
and after that the reader need not be surprised. They pro-
ceeded cautiously to where the Spaniards lay. The arrange-
ments of Mesty were very good. There were two men to gag
them while the others were to tie their limbs. Mesty and
Easy were to kneel by them with the candle, with raised
knives to awe them into silence, or to strike home, if their
own safety required it.
The gregos were removed off the ﬁrst man, who opened
his eyes at the sight of the candle, but the coxswain’s hand
was on his mouth—he was secured in silence. The other
two men were awaked, and threw off their coverings, but they

were also secured without there being occasion to resort to
bloodshed.
“What shall we do now, Mesty?” ,
“Now, sar,” said Mesty, “open the after-hatch and watch
— suppose more meh come up, we make them fast; suppose
no more come up, we wait till daylight -— and see what take
place.”
Mesty then went forward to see if the men were watchful
on the forecastle; and having again gone round the whole of
the deck to see if there were any more men on it, he blew out
the candle, and took his station with the others at the after-
hatchway
It was just at break of day that the Spaniards who had to
keep the morning watch having woke up, as people generally
do at that hour at which they expect to be called, dressed
themselves and came on deck, imagining, and very truly, that
those of the middle watch had fallen asleep, but little imagin-
ing that the deck was in possession of Englishmen. Mesty
and the others retreated, to allow them all to come up before
they could perceive them, and fortunately this was accom-
plished. Four men came on the deck, looked round them,
and tried to make out in the dark where their shipmates
might be. The grating was slapped on again by Jack, and
before they could well gain their eyesight, they were seized
and secured, not however without a scufﬂe and some-noise.
By the time that these men were secured and laid between
the guns it was daylight, and they now perceived what a ﬁne
vessel they had fairly taken possession of — but there was
much to be done yet. There was, of course, a number of men
in the ship, and moreover they were not a mile from a battery
of ten guns. Mesty, who was foremost in everything, left
four men abaft, and went forward on the forecastle, examined
the cable, which was ‘coir’ rope, and therefore easily divided,
and then directed the two men forward to coil a hawser upon
the foregrating, the weight of which would make all safe in
that quarter, and afterwards to join them on the quarter-
deck.

“Now, Mr. Easy, the great ting will be to get hold of
captain; we must get him on deck. Open cabin-hatch now,
and keep the after-hatch fast. Two men stay there, the
others all come aft.”
“Yes,” replied Jack, “it will be a great point to secure
the captain — but how are we to get him up?”
“You no _know how to get captain up? By de holy, I
know very well.”
And Mesty took up the coils of rope about the mizenmast,
and threw them upon deck, one after another, making all the
noise possible. In a short time, there was a violent pull of a
bell at the cabin-door, and in a minute afterwards a man in
his shirt came up the cabin-hatchway, who was immediately
secured.
“Dis de captain’s servant,” said Mesty, “he come say no
make such d—d noise. Stop a little — captain get in passion,
and come up himself.”
And Mesty renewed the noise with the ropes over the
cabin. Mesty was right; in a few minutes the captain him-
self came up, boiling with indignation. At the sound of the
cabin-door opening, the seamen and our hero concealed them-
selves behind the companion-hatch, which was very high, so
as to give the captain time to get fairly on deck. The men
aheady secured had been covered over with the gregos. The
captain was a most powerful man, and it was with difﬁculty
that he was pinioned, and then not without his giving the
alarm, had there been any one to assist him; but as yet no
one had turned out of his hammock.
“Now we all right,” said Mesty, “and soon ab de slﬁp;
but I must make him ’fraid.”
The captain was seated down on the deck against one of
the guns, and Mesty, putting on the look of a demon, extended
abovehim his long nervous arm, with the sharp knife clutched,
as if ready every instant to strike it into his heart. The
Spanish captain felt his situation anything but pleasant. He
was then interrogated as to the number of men in the ship,
ofﬁcers, &c., to all which questions he answered truly; he

cast his eyes at the ﬁrm and relentless countenance of Mesty,
who appeared but to wait the signal.
“I tink all pretty safe now,” said Mesty. “Mr. Easy, we
now go down below and beat all men into the hold.”
Our hero approved of this suggestion. Taking their pistols
from the capstern, they rushed down with their cutlasses, and
leaving two men to guard the cabiu-door, they were soon
among the crew, who were all naked in their hammocks: the
resistance, although the numbers were more than double of
the English, was of course triﬂing. In a few minutes, the‘
Spaniards were all thrown down into the hold of the vessel,
and the hatches placed over them. Every part of the ship
was now in their possession, except the cabin, and to that
they all repaired. Our hero tried the door, and found it fast;
they beat it open, and were received with loud screams from
one side of the cabin, and the discharge of two pistols from
the other, fortunately without injury: those who had ﬁred the
pistols were an elderly man and a lad about the age of our
hero. They were thrown down and secured; the cabin was
searched, and nobody else found in it but three women; one
old and shrivelled, the other two, although with their counte-
nanees distorted with terror, were lovely as houris. So thought
Jack, as he took off his hat, and made them a very low bow
with his usual politeness, as they crouched, half dressed, in-a
corner. He told them in English that they had nothing to
fear, and begged that they would attend to their toilettes.
‘1‘he ladies made no reply, because, in the ﬁrst place, they
did not know what Jack said, and, in the next, they could not
speak English.
Mesty interrupted Jack in his attentions, by pointing out
that they must all go upon deck — so Jack again took off his
hat and bowed, and then followed his men, who led away the
two prisoners taken in the cabin. It was now ﬁve o’clock in
the morning, and there was movement on board of the other
vessels, which laid not far from the ship.
“Now, then,” said Jack, “ what‘ shall we do with the
prisoners? —_. could we not send the boat and bring our own

vessel alongside, and put them all in, tied as they are? We
should then get rid of them.”
“Massa Easy, you be one very ﬁne ofﬁcer one of these
days. Dat d—n good idea, any how; -—- but suppose we
send our own boat, what they tink on board of de oder
vessel? Lower down lilly boat from stern, put in four men,
and drop vessel ’longside — dat it.”
This was done; the cutter was on the seaward side of the
ship, and, as the ship was the outermost vessel, was con-
cealed from the view of the Spaniards on board of the other
vessels, and in the battery on shore. As soon as the latteen
vessel was alongside, the men who had already been secured
on deck, amounting to seven, were lowered into her, and laid.
upon the beans in the hold; all, except the captain, the two
cabin-prisoners, and the captain’s servant. They then went
down below, took oi f one part of the hatches, and ordered
the Spaniards up from the hold: as they came on deck they
were made fast and treated in the same manner. Mesty and
the men went down to examine if there were any left con-
cealed, and ﬁnding that they were all out, returned on deck.
The men who had been beaten down in the hold were twenty-
two in number, making the whole complement of thirty. As
soon as they had all been put into the xebeque, she was again
hauled off and anchored outside, and Jack found himself in
possession of a ﬁne ship of fourteen gums, with three pri-
soners male, and three prisoners female.
When the men returned in the boat from the vessel in
which the prisoners had been conﬁned, (the hatches having
been secured over them, by way of further precaution,) by
the advice of Mesty they put on the jackets and caps of the
Spanish seamen, of which there was a plentiful supply below.
“Now, what’s to be done, Mesty?” inquired Jack.
“Now, sar, we send some of the men aloft to get sails all
ready, and while they do that I cast loose this fellow,” point-
ing to the captain’s servant, “and make him get some break-
fast, for he know where to ﬁnd it.”
“Capital idea of yours, Mesty, for I’m tired of bean soup

already, and I will go down and pay my respects to the
ladies.”
Mesty looked over the counter.
“Yes, and be quick too, Massa Easy; d—m the women,
they toss their handkerchief in the air to people in the bat-
tery, — quick, Massa Easy.”
Mesty was right — the Spanish girls were waving their
handkerchiefs for assistance; it was all that they could do,
poor things. Jack hastened into the cabin, laid hold of the
two young ladies, very politely pulled them out of the quarter
gallery, and begged that they would not give themselves so
much trouble. The young ladies looked very much confused,
and as they could no longer wave their handkerchiefs, they
put them up to their eyes and began to weep, while the
elderly lady went on her knees, and held her hands up for
mercy. Jack raised her up, and very politely handed her to
one of the cabin lockers.
In the meantime Mesty, with his gleaming knife and ex-
pressive look, had done wonders with the captain’s steward,
for such the man was: and a breakfast of chocolate, salt meat,
hams and sausages, white biscuit and red wine, had been
spread on the quarter-deck. The men had come from aloft,
and Jack was summoned on deck. Jack oifered his hand to
the two young ladies, and beckoned the old one to follow:
the old lady did not think it advisable to refuse his courtesy,
so they accompanied him.
As soon as the females came on deck, and found the two
cabin prisoners bound, they ran to them and embraced them
with tears. Jack’s heart melted, and as there was now no
fear, he asked Mesty for his knife, and cut loose the two
Spaniards, pointing to the breakfast, and requesting that
they would join them. The Spaniards made a bow, and the
. ladies thanked Jack with a sweet smile; and the captain of
the vessel, who still lay pinioncd against the gun, looked, as
much as to say, Why the devil don’t you ask me? but the-
fact was, they had had such trouble to secure him, that Jack
did not much like the idea of letting him loose again. -Jack

and the seamen commenced their breakfast and as the ladies
and prisoners did not appear inclined to eat, they ate their
share and their own too; during which, the elderly man in-
quired of Jack if he could speak French.
Jack, with his mouth full of sausage, replied, that he
could; and then commenced a conversation, from which Jack
learnt as follows: —
The elderly gentleman was a passenger with the young
man, who was his son, and the ladies, who were his wife and
his two daughters, and they were proceeding to Tarragona.
Whereupon Jack made a bow and thanked him; and then
the gentleman, whose‘ name was Don Cordova de Rimarosa,
wished to know what Jack intended to do with them, hoping,
as a gentleman, he would put them on shore with their effects,
as they were non-combatants. Jack explained all this to
Mesty and the men, and then ﬁnished his sausage. The men,
who were a little elevated with the wine which they had been
drinking, proposed that they should take the ladies a cruise,
and Jack at ﬁrst did not dislike the idea, but he said nothing;
Mesty, however, opposed this, saying, that ladies only made
a row in a ship, and the coxswain sided with him, saying,
that they should all be at daggers drawn. Whereupon Jack
pulled out the “articles of war,” and informed the men, that
there was no provision in them for women, and therefore the
thing was impossible.
The next question was, as to the propriety of allowing
them to take their effects; and it was-agreed, at last, that
they might take them. Jack desired the steward to feed his
master the captain, and then told the Spanish Don the result
of the consultation, ﬁn-ther informing him, that as soon as it
was dark, he intended to put them all on board the small
vessel, when they would cast loose the men and do as they
pleased. The Don and the ladies returned thanks, and went
down to pack up their baggage; Mesty ordering two men to
help them, but with a caution, that they were not to en-
cumber themselves with any of the money, if there should
happen to be any on board.

_118 am. mnsmrmsn nasv.
The crew were busy during the day making preparations
for sailing. The coxswain had examined the provender in
the ship, and found that there was enough for at least three
months, of water, wine, and provisions, independent of
luxuries for the cabin. All thoughts of taking any more of
the vessels were abandoned, for their crew was but weak to
manage the one which they had possession of. A ﬁne breeze
sprang up, and they dropped their fore-topsails, just as a
boat was shoving ofl’ from the shore; but seeing the fore-top-
sails loosed, it put back again. This was fortunate, or all
would have been discovered. The other vessels also loosed
their sails, and the crews were heard weighing the anchors.
But the Nostra Senora del Carmen, which was Jaek’s
prize, did not move. At last the sun went down, the baggage
was placed in the cutter, the ladies and passengers went into
the boat, thanking Jack for his kindness, who put his hand
to his heart and bowed to the deck; and the captain was
lowered down after them. Four men well armed pulled them
alongside of the xebeque, put them and their trunks on deck,
and returned to the ship. The cutter was then hoisted up,
and as the anchor was too heavy to weigh, they cut the cable,
and made sail. The other vessels followed their example.
Mesty and the seamen cast longing eyes upon them, but it
was of no use; so they sailed. in company for about an hour,
and then Jack hauled his wind for a cruise.
CHAPTER XIV.
In which our Hero ﬁnds that disagreeable Occurrences will take Place on
a Cruise.
As soon as the ship had been hauled to the wind, J ack’s
ship’s company seemed to think that there was nothing to do
except to make merry; so they brought up some earthen jars
full of wine, and emptied them so fast that they were soon
fast asleep on the deck, with the exception of the man at the
helm, who, instead of thirty-two, could clearly make out

sixty-four points in the compass, and of course was able to
steer to a much greater nicety. Fortunately, the weather was
ﬁne, for when the man at the helm had steered till he could
see no more, and requested to be released, he found that his
shipmates were so overpowered with fatigue, that it was im-
possible to wake them. He kicked them one by one most
unmercifully in the ribs, but it was of no use: under these
circumstances, he did as they did, that is, lay down with
them, and in ten minutes it would have taken as much kick-
ing to awake him as he gave his shipmates.
In the meantime the ship had it all her own way, and not
knowing where she was to go, she went round and round the
compass during the best part of the night. Mesty had ar-
ranged the watches, Jack had made a speech, and the men
had promised everything, but the wine had got into their
heads, and memory had taken that opportunity to take a
stroll. Mesty had been down with Jack, examining the
cabin, and in the eaptain’s state-room they had found four-
teen thousand dollars in bags. Of this they determined not
to tell the men, but locked up the money and everything else
of value, and took out the key. They then sat down at the
cabin table, and after some conversation, it was no matter of
surprise, after having been up all the night before, that Jack
laid his head on the table and fell fast asleep. Mesty kept
his eyes open for some time, but at last his head sank down
upon his chest, and he also slumbered. Thus, about one
o’clock in the morning, there was not a very good watch kept
on board of the Nostra Senora del Carmen.
About four o’clock in the morning, Mesty tumbled for-
ward, and he hit his head against the table, which roused
him up.
“By de mass, I tink I almost fall asleep,” cried he, and
he went to the cabin window, which had been left. open, and
found that there was a strong breeze blowing in. “By de
Lord, de wind ab come more af ,” said Mesty, “why they
not tell me?” So saying, he went on deck, where he found
no one at the helm; every one drunk, and the ship with her

yards braced up running before the wind, just by way of a
change. Mesty growled, but there was no time to lose; the
topsails only were set, — these he lowered down, and then
put the helm a-lee, and lashed it, while he went down to
call our hero to his assistance. Jack roused up, and went on
deck.
“This nebbcr do, Massa Easy; we all go to devil together
-— together — dam drunken dogs — I freshen um up any
how.” So Mesty drew some buckets of water, with which he
soused the ship’s company, who then appeared to be recover-
ing their senses.
“By heavens!” says Jack, “but this is contrary to the
articles of war; Ishall read them to them to-morrow morning.”
“I tell what better ting, Massa Easy: we go lock up all
de wine, and sarve out so much, and no more. I go do it at
once, ’fore they wake up.”
Mesty went down, leaving Jack on deck to his medita-
tions.
“I am not sure,” thought Jack , “that I have done a very
wise thing. Here I am with a parcel of fellows who have no
respect for the articles of war, and who get as drunk as
David’s sow. I have a large ship, but I have very few hands;
and if it comes on bad weather, what shall I do? —for I know
very little — hardly how to take in a sail. Then — as for
where to steer, or how to steer, I know not — nor do any of
my men; but, however, as it was very narrow when we came
into the Mediterranean through the straits, it is hardly pos-
sible to get out of them without perceiving it: besides,I should
know the rock of Gibraltar again if I saw it. I must talk to
Mesty.”
Mesty soon returned with the keys of the provision-room
tied to his bandana.
“Now,” says he, “they not get drunk again in a hurry.”
A few more buckets of water soon brought the men to
their senses: they again stood on their legs, and gradually
recovered themselves. Daylight broke, and they found that
the vessel had made an attempt for the Spanish coast, being

MR. MIDSHIPMAN nssv. 121
within a mile of the beach, and facing a large battery a ﬂeur
d‘eau; fortunately they had time to square the yards, and
steer the ship along shore under the topsails, before they
were perceived. Had they been seen at daylight in the posi-
tion that they were in during the night, the suspicions of the
Spaniards would have been awakened; and had a boat been
sent off, while they were all drunk, they must have been re-
captured.
The men, who perceived what danger they had been in,
listened verypenitently to Jack’s remonstrances; and our hero,
to impress them more strongly on their minds, took out the
articles of war, read that on dnmkenness from beginning to
end; but the men had heard it read so often at the gangway,
that it did not make due impression. As Mesty said, his
plan was better, and so it proved, for as soon as Jack had
done, the men went down to get another jug of wine, and
found, to their disappointment, that it was all under lock
and key.
In the meantime, Jack called Mesty aft, and asked him if
he knew the way to Toulon. Mesty declared that he knew
nothing about it.
“Then, Mesty, it appears to me that we have a better
chance of ﬁnding our way back to Gibraltar; for you know
the land was on our left side all the way coming up the Medi-
terranean; and if we keep it, as it is now, on our right, We
shall get back again along the coast.” .
Mesty agreed with Jack that this was the ‘ne plus ultra’
of navigation; and that old Smallsole could not do better with
his ‘pig-yoke’ and compasses. So they shook a reef out of
the topsails, set top-gallant-sails, and ran directly down the
coast from point to point, keeping about ﬁve miles distant.
The men prepared a good dinner; Mesty gave them their
allowance of wine, which was just double what they had on
board the Harpy— so they soon appeared to be content.
One man, indeed, talked very big and very mutinously,
swearing that if the others would join him they would soon
have liquor enough; but Mesty gave him his look, opened his

’ knife, and swore that he would settle him, and Jack knocked
him down with a handspike; so that, what with the punish-
ment received, and that which was promised, the fellow
thought he might as well say no more about it. The fact is,
that had it not been from fear of Mesty, the whole of the men
would, in all probability, have behaved equally as bad;
nevertheless, they were a little staggered, it must be owned,
at seeing Jack play so good a stick with the handspike.
After this night Jack and Mesty kept watch and watch,
and everything went on very well until they were nearly
abreast of Carthagena, when a gale came on from the north-
ward, and drove them out of sight of land. Sail after sail
was reduced with difﬁculty from their having so few hands,
and the gale blew for three days with great fury. The men
were tired out and discontented. It was Jack’s misfortune
that he had but one good man with him: even the coxswain
of the boat, although a ﬁne-looking man, was worth nothing.
Mesty was Jack’s sheet-anchor. The fourth day the gale
moderated, but they had no idea where they were: they
knew that they had been blown off, but how far they could
not tell, and Jack now began to discover that a cruise at sea
without knowledge of navigation was a more nervous thing
than he had contemplated. However, there was no help for
it. At night they wore the ship and stood on the other tack,
and at daylight they perceived that they were close to some
small islands, and much closer to some large rocks, against
.which the sea beat high, although the wind had subsided.
Again was the helm put up, and they narrowly escaped. As
soon as the sails were trimmed the men came aft and pro-
posed that if they could ﬁnd anchorage they should run into
it, for they were quite tired out. This was true, and Jack
consulted with Mesty, who thought it advisable to agree to
the proposal. That the islands were not inhabited was very
evident. The only point to ascertain was, if there were good
anchorage. The coxswain offered to go in the boat and
examine; and, with four men, he set off, and in about an hour
returned, stating that there was plenty of water, and that it

Mn. MIDSHIPMAN nssv. 123


was as smooth as a mill-pond, being land-locked on every
side. As they could not weigh the bower-anchor they bent
the kedge, and running in without accident, came to in a
small bay, between the islands, in seven fathoms water. The
sails were furled, and everything put in order by the seamen,
who then took the boat and pulled on shore. “They might
as well have asked leave,” thought Jack. In an hour they
returned, and, after a short discussion, came aft to our hero
in a body.
The coxswain was spokesman. He said that they had
had hard work, and required now to have some rest — that
there were provisions on board for three months, so that there
could not be any hurry, and that they had found they could
pitch a tent very well on shore, and live there for a short
time; and that, as there was no harm in getting drunk on
shore, they expected that they might be allowed to take pro-
visions and plenty of wine with them, and that the men had
desired him to ask leave, because they were determined to
go whether or no. Jack was about to answer with the hand-
spike, but perceiving that the men had all put on their cut-
lasses, and had their pistols at their belts, he thought proper
to consult Mesty, who, perceiving that resistance was useless,
advised Jack to submit, observing, that the sooner all the
wine was gone the better, as there would be nothing done
while it lasted. Jack, therefore, very graciously told them
that they should have their own way, and he would stay there
as long as they pleased. Mesty gave them the keys of the
provision-hatch, and told them, with a grin, to help them-
selves. The men then informed Jack that he and Mesty
should stay on board and take care of the ship for them, and
that they would take the Spaniard on shore to cook their
victuals. But to this Jack observed that if he had not two
hands he could not obey their orders, in case they wished
him to come on shore for them. The men thought there was
good argument in that observation, and therefore allowed
Jack to retain the Spaniard, that he might be more prompt
to their call from the beach. They then wished him good

day, and begged that he would amuse himself with the
‘articles of war.’
As soon as they had thrown a spare sail into the boat,
with some spars to make a tent, and some bedding, they went
down below, hoisted up two pipes of wine out of the three, a
bag or two of biscuit, arms and ammunition, and as much of
the salt provisions as they thought they might require. The
boat being full, they shoved off with three cheers of derision.
Jack was sensible to the compliment: he stood at the gang-
way, took 011' his hat, and made them a polite bow.
As soon as they were gone, Mesty grinned with his sharp-
ﬁled teeth, and looking at our hero, said —
“I think I make um pay for all dis — stop a little; by do
piper as played before Moses, but our turn come by-and-
bye.”
As for Jack, he said nothing, but he thought the more.
In about an hour the men returned in the boat: they had for-
gotten many things they wanted — wood to make a ﬁre, and
several utensils; they helped themselves freely, and having
now everything that they could think of , they again went on
shore.
“How d—n lucky, we never tell dem about the dollars,"
said Mesty, as Jack and he were watching the motions of
the men.
“It is, indeed,” replied Jack; “not that they could spend
them here.”
“No, Massa Easy, but suppose they ﬁnd all that money,
they take boat and go away with it. Now, I hab them in my
clutch — stop a little.”
A narrow piece of salt pork had been left at the gangway:
Jack, without knowing why, tossed it overboard; being almost
all fat it sank very gradually: Jack watched it as it disap-
peared, so did Mesty, both full of thought, when they per-
ceived a dark object rising under it: it was a ground shark,
who took it into his maw, sank down, and disappeared.
“What was that?” said Jack.
“That ground shark, Massa Easy, — worst shark of all;

MR. mnsnmmsn naSY. - 125
you neber see him till you feel him;” and Mesty’s eyes
sparkled with pleasure. “By de powers, they soon stop de
mutiny; now I hab ’em.”
Jack shuddered and walked away.
During the day, the men on shore were seen to work hard,
and make all the preparations before they abandoned them-
selves to the sensual gratiﬁcation of intemperance. The tent
was pitched, the ﬁre was lighted, and all the articles taken
on shore rolled up and stowed away in their places; they
were seen to sit down and dine, for they were within hail of
the ship, and then one of the casks of wine was spiled. In
the meantime the Spaniard, who was a quiet lad, had pre-
pared the dinner for Easy and his now only companion. The
evening closed, and all was noise and revelry on shore; and
as they danced, and sung, and tossed off the cans of wine by
the light of the ﬁre, as they hallooed and screamed, and be-
came more and more intoxicated, Mesty turned to Jack with
his bitter smile, and only said —-
“Stop a little.”
At last the noise grew fainter, the ﬁre died away, and
gradually all was silent. Jack was still hanging over the
gangway when Mesty came up to him. The new moon had
just risen, and Jack’s eyes were ﬁxed upon it.
“Now, Massa Easy, please you come aft and lower down
little boat; take your pistols, and then we go on shore and
bring off the cutter; they all asleep now.”
“But why should we leave them without a boat, Mesty?”
for Jack thought of the sharks, and the probability of the
men attempting to swim off.
“I tell you, sar, this night they get drunk, to-morrow they
get drunk again, but drunken men never keep quiet, — sup-
pose one man say to others, ‘Let’s go board and kill ofﬁcer,
and then we do as we please,’ they all say yes, and they all
come and do it. No, sar — must have boat — if not for your
sake, I must hab it, save my own life any how, for they hate
me and kill me ﬁrst; by de powers, stop a little.”
Jack felt the truth of Mesty’s observation; he went aft

126 MR. mnsmrman nssr.
with him, lowered down the small boat, and they hauled it
alongside. Jack went down with Mesty into the cabin and
fetched his pistols. “And the Spaniard, Mesty, can we leave
him on board alone?”
“Yes, sar, he no got arms, and he see dat me have — but
suppose he ﬁnd arms he never dare do anything—I know de
man.”
Our hero and Mesty went into the boat and shoved of},
pulling gently on shore; the men were in a state of intoxica-
tion, so as not to be able to move, much less hear. They cast
off the cutter, towed her on board, and made her fast with
the other boat astern.
“Now, sar, we may go to bed; to-morrow morning you
will see.”
“They have everything they require on shore,” replied
Easy; “all they could want with the cutter would be to
molest us.” “
“Stop a little,” replied Mesty.
Jack and Mesty went to bed, and as a precaution against
the Spaniard, which was hardly necessary, Mesty locked the
cabin door — but Mesty never forgot anything.
Jack slept little that night — had melancholy forebodings
which he could not shake off; indeed, Jack had reﬂected so
much since he had left the ship, he had had his eyes so much
opened, and had felt what a responsibility he had taken by
indulging himself in a whim of the moment, that it might be
almost said, that in the course of one fortnight he had at once
from a boy spnmg up into a man. He was mortiﬁed and
angry, but he was chieﬂy so with himself.
Mesty was up at daylight, and Jack soon followed him:
they watched the party on shore, who had not yet left the
tent. At last, just as Jack had ﬁnished his breakfast, one or
two made their appearance; the men looked about them as
if they were searching for something, and then walked down
to the beach, to where the boat had been made fast. Jack
looked at Mesty, who grinned, and answered with the words
so often repeated, —


## p. 127 (#135) ############################################

rm. mnsmrmsn nASv. 127
“Stop a little.”
The men then walked. along the rocks until they were
abreast of the ship.
“Ship ahoy!”
“Halloo,” replied Mesty.
“Bring the boat ashore directly, with a beaker of water.”
“I knew dat,” cried Mesty, rubbing his hands with de~
light. “Massa Easy, you must tell them N 0.”
“But why should I not give them water, Mesty? ”
“Because, sar, den they take boa .”
“Very true,” replied Easy.
“Do you hear on board?” cried the coxswain, who was
the man who hailed — “send the boat immediately, or
we’ll cut the throats of every mother’s son of you, by
God!” -
“I shall not send the boat,” replied J ack, who now thought
Mesty was right.
“You won’t—won’t you?— then your doom’s sealed,” re-
plied the man, walking up to the tent with the other. In a
short time all the seamen turned out of the tent, bringing
with them four muskets, which they had taken on shore with
them.
“ Good heavens! they are not, surely, going to ﬁre at us,
Mesty.”
“Stop a little.”
The men then came down abreast of the ship, and the
coxswain again hailed, and asked if they would bring the boat
on shore.
“You must say, No, sar,” replied Mesty.
“I feel I must,” replied Jack; and then he answered the
coxswain, “No.”
The plan of the mutineers had been foreseen by the wily
negro— it was to swim off to the boats which were riding
astern, and to ﬁre at him or Jack, if they attempted to haul
them up alongside and defend them. To get into the boats,
especially the smaller one, from out of the water, was easy
enough. Some of the men examined their priming and held

128 MR. MIDSHIPMAN nssv.

the muskets at their hips all ready, with the muzzles towards
the ship, while the coxswain and two men were throwing ofl‘
their clothes.
“Stop, for God’s sake, stop!” cried Jack. “The harbour
is full of ground sharks, — it is, upon my soul!”
“Do you think to frighten us with ground sharks?” re-
plied the coxswain; “keep under cover, my lad; Jack, give
him a shot to prove we are in earnest, and every time he or
that nigger show their heads, give them another, my lads.”
“For God’s sake, don’t attempt to swim,” said Jack, in an
agony; “I will try some means to give you water.”
“Too late now — you’re doomed;” and the eoxswain
sprang off the rock into the sea, and was followed by two
other men: at the same moment a musket was discharged,
and the bullet whistled close to our hero’s ear.
Mesty dragged Jack from the gangway, who was nearly
fainting from agonising feelings. He sank on the deck
for a moment, and then sprang up and ran to the port to look
at the men in the water. He was just in time to see the
coxswain raise himself with a loud yell out of the sea, and
then disappear in a vortex, which was crimsoned with his
blood.
Mesty threw down his musket in his hand, of which he had
several all ready loaded, in case the men should have gained
the boats.
“By the powers, dat no use now!”
Jack had covered his face with his hands. But the tragedy
was not complete: the other men, who were in the water, had
immediately turned and made for the shore; but before they
could reach it, two more of these voracious monsters, at-
tracted by the blood of the coxswain, had ﬂown to the
spot, and there was a contention for the fragments of their
bodies.
Mesty, who had seen this catastrophe, turned towards our
hero, who still hid his face.
“I’m glad he no see dat, any how,” muttered Mesty.
“See what!” exclaimed Jack.

“Shark eat em all.”
“Oh, horrid! horrid,” groaned our hero.
“Yes, sar, very horrid,” replied Mesty, “and dat bullet at
your head very horrid. Suppose the sharks no take them,
what then? They kill us and the sharks have our body. I
think that more horrid still.”
“Mesty,” replied Jack, seizing the negro convulsively by
the arm, “it was not the sharks—it was I,—I who have mur-
dered these men.”
Mesty looked at Jack with surprise.
“How dat possible?”
“If I had not disobeyed orders,” replied our hero, panting
for breath, “if I had not shown them the example of dis-
obedience, this would not have happened. How could I ex-
pect submission from them? It’s all my fault—I see it now
— and, O God! when will the sight be blotted from my me-
mory?”
“Massa Easy, I not understand tha ,” replied Mesty: “I
think you talk foolish—might as well say, suppose Ashantee
men not make war, this not happen; for suppose Ashantee
not make war, I not slave, I not run away,— I not come
board Harpy — I not go in boat with you — I not hinder men
from getting drunk -— and dat why they make mutiny — and
the mutiny why the shark take um?”
Jack made no reply, but he felt some consolation from the
counter-argument of the negro.
The dreadful death of the three mutineers appeared to
have had a sensible effect upon their companions, who walked
away from the beach withtheir heads down and with measured
steps. They were now seen to be perambulating the island,
probably in search of that water which they required. At
noon, they returned to their tent, and soon afterwards were
in a state of intoxication, hallooing and shouting as the day
before. Towards the evening they came down to the beach
abreast of the ship, each with a vessel in their hands, and
perceiving that they had attracted the notice of our hero and
Mesty, tossed the contents of the vessels up in the azirto show

that they had found water, and hooting and deriding , went
back, dancing, leaping, and kicking up their heels, to renew
their orgies, which continued till after midnight, when they
were all stupiﬁed as before.
The next day Jack had recovered from the ﬁrst shock
which the catastrophe had given him, and he called Mesty
into the cabin to hold a consultation.
“Mesty, how is this to end?”
“How you mean, sar?—.end here, or end on board of the
Harpy?”
“The Harpy, — there appears little chance of our seeing
her again — we are on a desolate island, or what is the same
thing; but we will hope that it will be so: but how is this
mutiny to end?”
“Massa Easy, suppose I please, I make it end very soon,
but I not in a hurry.”
“How do you mean, Mesty, not in a hurry?”
“Look, Massa Easy; you wish take a cruise , and I wish
the same ting: now because mutiny you want to go back —
but by all de powers, you tink that I, a prince in my own
country, feel wish to go back and boil kettle for de young
gentlemen. No, Massa Easy, gib me mutiny — gib me any
ting — but — once I was prince,” replied Mesty, lowering his
voice at the last few emphatic words.
“ You must one of these days tell me your history,” re-
plied Jack; “but just now let us argue the point in question.
How could you put an end to this mutiny?”
“By putting an end to all wine. Suppose I go shore after
they all dnmk, I spile the casks in three or four places, and
in the morning all wine gone — den dey ab get sober, and
beg pardon — we take dem on board, put away all arms,
‘cept yours and mine, and I like to see the mutiny after dat.
Blood and ounds — but I settle um, any how.”
'21: '1‘he idea is very good, Mesty, — why should we not do
so
“Because I not like run d_e risk to go ash0r6—all for

what? to go back, boil de kettle for all gentlemans—I very
happy here, Massa,” replied Mesty, carelessly.
“And I am very miserable,” repliedJack; “but, however,
I am completely in your power, Mesty, and I must, I suppose,
submit.”
“What you say, Massa Easy — submit to me? — no sar,
when you are on board Harpy as ofﬁcer, you talk with me as
friend, and not treat me as negro servant. Massa Easy, I feel
—I feel what I am,” continued Mesty, striking his bosom,
“I feel it here —for all ﬁrst time since I leave my country, I
feel thatl am someting; but, Massa Easy, I love my friend as
much as I he my enemy — and you neber submit to me -
I too proud to allow dat, ’cause Massa Easy — I am a man-—
and once, I was a prince.”
Although Mesty did not perhaps explain by words half so
well as he did by his countenance the full tide of feeling
which was overﬂowing in his heart, Jack fully understood
and felt it. He extended his hand to Mesty, and said-
“Mesty,—that you have been a prince, I care little about,
although I doubt it not, because you are incapable of a lie;
but you are a man, and I respect you, nay, I love you as a
friend — and with my will we never part again.”
Mesty took the hand offered by Jack. It was the ﬁrst
peace-offering ever extended to him since he had been torn
away from his native land -—the ﬁrst compliment, the ﬁrst
tribute, the ﬁrst acknowledgment, perhaps, that he was not
an inferior being; he pressed it in silence, for he could not
speak; but could the feelings which were suffocating the
negro but have been laid before sceptics, they must have
acknowledged that at that moment they were all and only
such as could do honour, not only to the prince, but even
to the Christian. So much was Mesty affected with what
had happened, that when he dropped the hand of our hero,
he went down into the cabin, ﬁnding it impossible to con-
tinue the conversation, which was not renewed until the next
morning.

“What is your opinion, Mesty? Tell me, and 1 will be
governed by it.”
“Den, sar, I tell you I tink it right that they ﬁrst come
and ask to come on board before you take them —and, sar, I
tink it also right as we are but two and they are ﬁve, dat dey
ﬁrst eat all their provisions. Let ‘em starve plenty, and den
dey come on board tame enough.”
“At all events,” replied Jack, “the ﬁrst overtures of some
kind or another must come from them. I wish I had some-
thing to do —I do not much like this cooping up on board
ship.”
“Massa, why you no talk with Pedro?”
“Because I cannot speak Spanish.” _
“I know dat, and dat why I ask de question. You very
sorry when you meet the two pretty women in the ship, you
not able to talk with them, I guess that.”
“I was very sorry, I grant,” replied Jack.
“Well, Massa Easy, by-and-bye we see more Spanish
girl. Why not talk all day with Pedro , and den you able to
talk with dem.”
“Upon my word, Mesty, I never had an idea of your value.
I will learn all the Spanish that I can,” replied J ack, who was
glad to have employment found for him, and was quite dis-
gusted with the articles of war.
As for the men on shore, they continued the same course,
if not as before, one day succeeded another, and without
variety. It was, however, to be observed that the ﬁre was
now seldomer lighted, which proved their fuel scarce, and the
weather was not so warm as it had been, for it was now
October. Jack learnt Spanish from Pedro for a month, du-
ring which there was no appearance of submission on the part
of the mutineers, who, for the ﬁrst fortnight, when intoxicated,
used to come down and ﬁre at Jack or Mesty when they made
their appearance. Fortunately drunken men are not good
marksmen; but latterly this had been discontinued, because
they had expended their ammunition, and they appeared to

have almost forgotten that the ship was there, for they took
no notice of her whatever.
On the other hand, Jack had decided that if he waited
there a year the overtures should come from them who had
mutinied; and now, having an occupation, he passed his time
very quietly, and the days ﬂew so fast that two months had
actually been run 05 the calendar before he had an idea of it.
One evening as they were down in the cabin, for the
evenings had now become very cold, Jack asked Mesty
whether he had any objection to give him a history of his life.
Mesty replied that if he wished he was ready to talk, and
at a nod from our hero Mesty commenced as follows.
CHAPTER XV.
In which Mutiny, like Fire , is quenched for Want of Fuel and 110 Want
of Water.
Ar.-rnouon we have made the African negro hitherto talk
in his own mixed jargon, yet, as we consider that, in a long
narration, it will be tedious to the reader, we shall now trans-
late the narrative part into good English, merely leaving the
conversation with which it may be broken, in its peculiar
dialect.
“The ﬁrst thing I recollect,” said Mesty, “is, that I was
carried on the shoulders of a man with my legs hanging down
before, and holding on by his head.
“Every one used to look at me and get out of the way, as
I rode through the town and market-place, so loaded with
heavy gold ornaments that I could not hear them, and was
glad when the women took them off ; but as I grew older I
became proud of them, because I knew that I was the son of
a king. I lived happy. I did nothing but shoot my arrows,
and I had alittle sword which I was taught to handle, and
the great captains who were about my father showed me how
to kill my enemies. Sometimes I laid under the shady trees,
sometimes I was with the women belonging to my father;

sometimes I was with him and played with the skulls, and re-
peated the names of those to whom they had belonged, for in
our country, when we kill our enemies, we keep their skulls
as trophies. -
“As I grew older, I did as I pleased; I beat the women
and the slaves; I think I killed some of the latter — I know
I did one, to try whether 1 could strike well with my two-
handed sword made of hard and heavy wood, —but that is
nothing in our country. I longed to be a great captain, and
I thought of nothing else but war and ﬁghting, and how many
skulls I should have in my possession when I had a house and
wives of my own, and I was no longer a boy. I went out in
the woods to hunt, and I stayed for weeks. And one day I
saw a panther basking in the sun, waving his graceful tail.
1 crept up softly till I was behind a rock within three yards
of it, and drawing my arrow to the head, I pierced him
through the body. The animal bounded up in the air, saw
me, roared and made a spring, but I dropped behind the rock,
and he passed over me. He turned again to me, but I had
my knife ready, and, as he ﬁxed his talons into my shoulder
and breast, I pierced him to the heart. This was the happiest
day of my life; I had killed a panther without assistance,
and I had the wounds to show. Although I was severely
hurt, I thought nothing of it. I took off the skin as my blood
dropped down and mixed with that of the beast—-but I re-
joiced in it. Proudly did I go into the town dripping with
gore and smarting with pain. Every one extolled the feat,
called me a hero and a great captain. I ﬁled my teeth, and
I became a man.
“From that day I ranked among the warriors, and, as
soon as my wounds were healed, I went out to battle. In
three ﬁghts I had gained ﬁve skulls, and when I returned
they weighed me out gold. I then had a house and wives,
and my father appointed me a Caboceer. I wore the plume
of eagle and ostrich feathers, my dress was covered with
fetishes, I pulled on the boots with bells, and with my bow
and arrows slung on my back, my spear and blunderbuss,

my knives and my double-handed sword, I led the men to
battle and brought back skulls and slaves. Every one
trembled at my name, and, if my father threatened to send
me out, gold-dust covered the ﬂoor of his hall of council
— Now, I boil the kettle for the young gentlemen!
“There was one man I liked. He was not a warrior, or I
should have hated him, but he was brought up with me in
my fat.tr’s house, and was a near relative. I was grave and
full of pride, he was gay and fond of music; and although
there was no music to me equal to the tom-tom, yet I did not
always wish for excitement. I often was melancholy, and
then Iliked to lay my head in the lap of one of my wives, under
the shady forest behind my house, and listen to his soft music.
At last he went to a town near us where his father lived, and
as he departed I gave him gold-dust. He had been sent to
my father to be formed into a warrior, but he had no strength
of body, and he had no soul; still I loved him, because he
was not like myself. There was a girl in the town who was
beautiful; many asked for her as their wife, but her father
had long promised her to my friend; he refused even the
greatest warrior of the place, who went away in wrath to
the fetishman, and throwing him his gold armlets asked for
a fetish against his rival. It was given, and two days before
he was to be married my friend died. His mother came to
me, and it was enough. I put on my war dress, I seized my
weapons, sat for a whole day with my skulls before me,
working up my revenge, called out my men, and that night
set off for the town where the warrior resided, killed two of
his relatives and carried off ten of his slaves. When he heard
what I had done, he trembled and sent gold; but I knew that
he had taken the girl home as his wife, and I would not listen
to the old man who sought to pacify me. Again I collected
a larger force, and attacked him in the night: we fought, for
he was prepared with his men, but after a struggle he was
beaten back. 1 ﬁred his house, wasted his provision ground,
and taking away more slaves, I returned home with my men,
intending soon to assault him again. The next day there

came more messengers, who knelt in vain; so they wentto
my father, and many warriors begged him to interfere. My
father sent for me, but I would not listen; the warriors spoke,
and I turned my back: my father was wroth and threatened,
the warriors brandished their two-handed swords -—- they
dared to do it; I looked over my shoulder with contempt,
and I returned to my house. I took down my skulls, and I
planned. It was evening, and I was alone, when a woman
covered up to the eyes approached; she fell down before me
as she exposed her face.
“‘I am the girl who was promised to your relation, and I
am now the wife of your enemy. I shall be a mother. I
could not love your relation, for he was no warrior. It is not
true that my husband asked for a fetish — it was I who
bought it, for I would not wed him. Kill me and be satis-
ﬁed.’
“She was very beautiful, and I wondered not that my
enemy loved her — and she was with child—it was his child,
and she had fetished my friend to death. I raised my sword
to strike, and she did not shrink: it saved her life. ‘Thou
art ﬁt to be the mother of warriors,’ said I, as I dropped my
sword, ‘and thou shalt be my wife, but ﬁrst his child shall be
born, and I will have thy husband’s skull.‘
“‘No, no,’ replied she, ‘I will be the mother of no warriors
but my present husband, whom I love; if you keep me as
your slave I will die.’
“I told her she said foolish things, and sent her to the
women’s apartment, with orders to be watched — but she
hardly had been locked up before she drew her knife,
plunged it into her heart, and died.’
“When the king my father board this he sent me a mes-
sage — ‘Be satisﬁed with the blood that has been shed, it is
eno/gh;' but I turned away, for I wished for mine enemy’s
skull. That night I attacked him again, and met him hand
to hand; I killed him, and carried home his skull, and I was
appeased.
“But all the great warriors were wroth, and my father

could not restrain them. They called out their men, and I
called out my men, and I had a large body, for my name was
terrible. But the force raised against me was twice that of
mine, and I retreated to the bush—after awhile we met and
fought, and I killed many, but my men were too few, and
were overpowered -—- the fetish had been sent out against me,
and thcirhearts melted; at last Isank down with mywounds, for
I bled at every pore, and I told my men who were about me to
take off my feathers, and my dress and boots, that my enemies
might not have my skull: they did so, and I crawled into the
bush to die. But I was notto die; I was recovering, when I
was discovered by those who steal men to sell them: I was
bound, and fastened to a chain with many more. I, a prince
and a warrior, who could show the white skulls of his enemies
— I offered to procure gold, but they derided me; they
dragged me down to the coast, and sold me to the Whites.
Little did I think, in my pride, that I should be a slave. I
knew that I was to die, and hoped to die in battle: my skull
would have been more prized than all the gold in the earth,
and my skin -would have been stuffed and hung up in a fetish-
house —instead of which, I now boil the kettle for the young
gentlemen!”
“Well,” replied Jack, “that’s better than being killed
and stuffed.”
“ Mayhap it is,” replied Mesty, “I tink very different
now dan I tink den — but still, it women’s work and not
suit me.
“They put me with others into a cave until the ship
came, and then we were sent on board, put in irons, and
down in the hold, where you could not sit upright—I wanted
to die, but could not: others died every day, but I lived — I
was landed in America, all bone, and I fetched very little
money — they laughed at me, as they bid their dollars: at
last a man took me away, and I was on a plantation with
hundreds more, but too ill to work, and not intending to
work. The other slaves asked me if I was a fetish man; I
said yes, and I would fetish any man that I did not like: one

man laughed, and I held up my ﬁnger; I was too weak to
get up, for my blood had long boiled with fever, and 1 said
t0 him, ‘you shall die;’ for I meant to have killed him as
soon as I was well. He went away, and in three days he was
dead. I don’t know how, but all the slaves feared me, and
my master feared me, for he had seen the man die, and he,
although he was a white man, believed in fetish, and he
wished to sell me again, but no one would buy a fetish-man,
so he made friends with me; for I told him if I was beat he
should die, and he believed me. He took me into his house,
and I was his chief man, and I would not let the other slaves
steal, and he was content. He took me with him to New
York, and there after two years, when I had learnt English,
I ran away, and got on board of an English ship — and they
told me to cook. I left the ship as soon as I came to Eng-
land, and oﬁered myself to another, and they said they did
not want a cook; and I went to another, and they asked me
if I was a good cook: everybody seemed to think that a black
man must be a cook, and nothing else. At last I starve, and
I go on board a man-of-war, and here I am, after having
been a warrior and a prince, cook, steward and every ting
else, boiling kettle for de young gentlemen.”
“Well,” replied Jack, “at all events that is better than
being a slave.”
Mesty made no reply: any one who knows the life
of a midshipman’s servant will not be surprised at his
silence.
“Now, tell me, do you think you were right in being so
revengeful, when you were in your own country?” inquired
Jack.
“1 tink so den, Massa Easy; sometimes when my blood
boil, 1 tink so now — oder time, I no know what to tink —
but when a man love very much, he hate very much.”
“But you are now a Christian, Mesty.”
“I hear all that your people say,” replied the negro,
“and it make me tink — I no longer believe in fetish, any-
how.”

“Our religion tells us to love our enemies.”
“Yes, I heard parson say dat — but den what we do with
our friends, Massa Easy?” -
“Love them too.”
“I no understand dat, Massa Easy — 1 love you, because
you good, and treat me well — Mr. Vigors, he bully, and
treat me ill—how possible to love him? By dc power, I hate
him, and wish I had his skull. You tink little Massa Gossett
love him ?”
“No,“ replied Jack, laughing, “I’m afraid that he would
like to have his skull as well as you, Mesty — but at all
events we must try and forgive those who injure us.”
“Then, Massa Easy, 1 tink so t0o—too much revenge
very bad — it very easy to hate, but not very easy to forgive
— so I tink that if a man forgive, he hab more soul in him,
he more of a man.”
“After all,” thought Jack, “Mesty is about as good a
Christian as most people.”
“What that?” cried Mesty, looking out of the cabin
window — “Ah! d—n drunken dogs — they set ﬁre to
tent.” .
Jack looked, and perceived that the tent on shore was in
ﬂames.
“I tink these cold nights cool their courage, anyhow,”
observed Mesty— “Massa Easy, you see they soon ask per-
mission to come on board.”
Jack thought so too, and was most anxious to be off; for,
- on looking into the lockers in the state-room, he had found a
chart of the Mediterranean, which he had studied very atten-
tively— he had found out the rock of Gibraltar, and had
traced the Harpy’s course up to Cape de Gatte, and thence
to Tarragona — and , after a while, had summoned Mesty to
a cabinet council.
“See, Mesty,” said Jack, “I begin to make it out, here is
Gibraltar, and Cape de Gatte, and Tarragona — it was here-
about we were when we took the ship, and, if you recollect,
we had passed Cape de Gatte two days before we were blown

oﬂ' from the land, so that we had gone about twelve inches,
and had only four more to go.”
“Yes, Massa Easy, 1 see all dat.”
“Well, then, {we were blown oﬂ‘ shore by the wind, and
must of course have come down this way; and here you see
are three little islands, called Zaifarine Islands, and with no
names of towns upon them, and therefore uninhabited; and
you see they lie just like the islands we are anchored among
now — we must he at the Zaffarine Islands — and only six
inches from Gibraltar.”
“I see, Massa Easy, dat all right — but six debbelish
long inches.”
“Now, Mesty, you know the compass on deck has a
ﬂourishing thing for the north point — and here is a compass
with a north point also. Now the north point from the Zaf-
farine Islands leads out to the Spanish coast again, and
Gibraltar lies ﬁve or six points of the compass to this side of
it - if we steer that way we shall get to Gibral .”
_ “All right, Massa Easy,” replied Mesty, and Jack was
right, with the exception of the variation, which he knew no-
thing about.
To make sure, Jack brought one of the compasses down
from deck, and compared them. He then lifted off the glass,
counted the points of the compass to the westward, and
marked the corresponding one on the binnacle compass with
his pen.
“There,” said he, “that is the way to Gibraltar, and
as soon as the mutiny is quelled, and the wind is fair, I’ll
be off.”

mutineers could hold out no longer. In the ﬁrst place, they
had put in the spile of the second cask of wine so loosely

by four days and nights of continual rain.’ Everything they
had had been soaked through and through and they were
worn out, shivering with cold, and starving: Hanging they
thought better than dying by inches from starvation; and
yielding to the imperious demands of hunger, they came
down to the beach, abreast of the ship, and dropped down on
their knees.
“I tell you so, Massa Easy,” said Mesty: “d— n rascals,

plied the ﬁrst man who had spoken. “If we are to die, it
must not be by 1nches — If you will not take us, the sharks

It appeared that the poor fellows had already made up
eir minds to do this, if our hero, persuaded by Mesty, had
refused to take them on board; they shook hands round,
and then walkrng a few yards from the beach, stood 111 a line
while the man gave the signal — one — two —-

“Stop ,” cried Jack ', who had not forgotten the dreadful
scene which had already taken place, — “stop.”
The men paused.
“What will you promise if I take you on board?”
“To do our duty cheerfully till we join the ship, and
then be hung as an example to all mutineers,” replied the
men.
“Dat very fair," replied Mesty; “take dem at their word,
Massa Easy.”
“Very well,” replied Jack, “I accept your conditions;
and we will come for you.”
Jack and Mesty hauled up the boat, stuck their pistols in
their belts, and pulled to the shore. The men , as they
stepped in, touched their_hats respectfully to our hero, but
said nothing. On their arrival on board, Jack read that part
of the articles of war relative to mutiny, by which the men
were reminded of the very satisfactory fact, “that they were
to suffer death;” and then made a speech which, to men who
were starving, appeared to be interminable. However, there
is an end to everything in this world, and so there was to
Jack’s harangue; after which Mesty gave them some biscuit,
which they devoured in thankfulness, until they could get
something better. The next morning the wind was fair,
they weighed their kedgc with some difﬁculty, and ran out
of the harbour: the men appeared very contrite, worked well,
but in silence, for they had no very pleasant anticipations;
but hope always remains with us; and each of the men,
although he had no doubt but that the others would be hung,
hoped that he would escape with a sound ﬂogging. The
wind, however, did not allow them to steer their course long;
before night it was contrary, and they fell off three points to
the northward. “However,” as Jack observed, “at all events
we shall make the Spanish coast, and then we must run down
it to Gibraltar: I don’t care — I understand navigation much
better than I did.” The next morning they found them-
selves, with a very light breeze, under a high cape, and, as
the sun rose, they observed a large vessel in‘shore, about two

miles to the westward of them, and another outside, about
four miles off‘. Mesty took the glass and examined the one
outside, which, on a sudden, had let fall all her canvas, and
was now nmning for the shore, steering ‘for the cape under
which Jack’s vessel lay. Mesty put down the glass.
“Massa Easy —I tink dat de Harpy.”
One of the seamen took the glass and examined her, while
the others who stood by showed great agitation.
“Yes, it is the Harpy,” said the seaman. “Oh! Mr.
Easy, will you forgive us?” continued the man, and he and
the others fell on their knees. “Do not tell all, for God’s
sake, Mr. Easy.”
Jack’s heart melted; he looked at Mesty.
“I tink,” said Mesty apart to our hero, “dat with what
them hab suffer already, suppose they get seven dozen a-
piece, dat quite enough.”
Jack thought that even half that punishment would suf-
ﬁee; so he told the men, that although he must state what
had occurred, he would not tell all, and would contrive to get
them off as well as he could. He was about to make a long
speech, but a gun from the Harpy, which had now come up
within range, made him defer it till a more convenient op-
portunity. At the same time the vessel in-shore hoisted
Spanish colours, and ﬁred a gun.
“By de powers but we got in the middle of i ,” cried
Mesty; “Harpy tink us Spaniard. Now, my lads, get all
gun ready, bring up powder and shot. Massa, now us ﬁre
at Spaniard -- Harpy not ﬁre at us — no ab English colours
on board — dat all we must do.”
The men set to with a will; the glms were all loaded, and
were soon cast loose and primed, during which operations it
fell calm, and the sails of all three vessels ﬂapped against
their masts. The Harpy was then about two miles from
Jack’s vessel, and the Spaniard about a mile from him, with
all her boats ahead of her, towing towards him; Mesty
examined the Spanish vessel.

“Dat man-of war, Massa Easy, — what de debbel we do
for colour? must hoist someting.”
Mesty ran down below; he recollected that there was a
very gay petticoat, which had been left by the old lady who
was in the vessel when they captured her. It was of green
silk, with yellow and blue ﬂowers, but very faded, having
probably been in the Don’s family for a century. Mesty had
found it under the mattrass of one of the beds, and had put it
into his bag, intending probably to cut it up into waistcoats.
He soon appeared with this under his arm, made it fast to the
peak halyards and hoisted it up.
“Dere, Massa, dat do very well — dat what you call ‘all
nation colour.’ Every body strike him ﬂag to dat — men
nebber pull it down,” said Mesty, “any how. Now den, ab
hoist colour, we ﬁre away — mind you only ﬁre one gun at a
time, and point um well, den ab time to load again.”
“She’s hoisted her colours, sir,” said Sawbridge, on board
of the Harpy; “but they do not show out clear, and it’s im-
possible to distinguish them; but there’s a gun.”
“It’s not at us, sir,” said Gascoigne, the midshipman;
“it’s at the Spanish vessel — I saw the shot fall ahead
of her.”
“It must be a privateer,” said Captain Wilson; “at all
events, it is very fortunate, for the corvette would otherwise
have towed into Carthagena. Another gun, round and grape,
and well pointed too; she carries heavy metal, that craft: she
must be a Maltese privateer.”
“That’s as much as to say that she’s a pirate,” replied
Sawbridge; “I-can make nothing other colours—they appear
to me to be green—she must be a Turk. Another gun—
and devilish well aimed; it has hit the boats.”
“Yes, they are all in confusion: we will have her now, if
we can only get a triﬂe of wind. That is a breeze coming up
in the ofﬁng. Trim the sails, Mr. Sawbridge.”
The yards were squared, and the Harpy soon had steerage
way. In the meantime Jack and his few men had kept up a,
steady, well-directed, although slow, ﬁre with their larboard

guns upon the Spanish corvette; and two of her boats had
been disabled. The Harpy brought the breeze up with her,
and was soon within range; she steered to cut off the corvette,
ﬁring only her bow-chasers.
“We ab her now,” cried Mesty; “ﬁre away, — men take
good aim. Breeze come now; one man go to helm. By de
power what dat?”
The exclamation of Mesty was occasioned by a shot hulling
the ship on the starboard side. Jack and he ran over, and
perceived that three Spanish gun-boats had just made their
appearance round the point, and had attacked them. The
fact was, that on the other side of the cape was the port and
town of Carthagena, and these g1m-boats had been sent out
to the assistance of the corvette. The ship had now caught
the breeze, fortunately for Jack, or he would probably have
been taken into Carthagena; and the corvette, ﬁnding herself
cut off by both the Harpy and Jack’s vessel, as soon as the
breeze came up to her, put her head the other way, and tried
to escape by running westward along the coast close in-shore.
Another shot, and then another, pierced the hull of the ship,
and wounded two of Jackk’ men; but as the corvette had
turned, and the Harpy followed her, of course Jack did the
same, and in ten minutes he was clear of the gun-boats, who
did not venture to make sail and stand after him. The wind,
now freshened fast, and blew out the green pettieoat, but the
Harpy was exchanging broadsides with the corvette, and too
busy to look after Jaek’s ensign. The Spaniard defended
himself well, and had the assistance of the batteries as he
passed, but there was no anchorage until he had run many
miles further. About noon, the wind died away, and at one
o’clock it again fell nearly calm; but the Harpy had neared
her distance, and was now within three cables’ length of her
antagonist, engaging her and a battery of four g\ms. Jack
came up again, for he had the last of the breeze, and was
about half a mile from the corvette when it fell calm. By the
advice of Mesty, he did not ﬁre any more, as otherwise the
Harpy would not obtain so much credit, and it was evident
Hr. Midshipman Easy. 10

146 MR. MIDSIIIPMAX naSr.
that the ﬁre of the Spaniard slackened fast. At three o’clock
the Spanish colours were hauled down, and the Harpy, send-
ing a boat on board and taking possession, directed her whole
ﬁre upon the battery, which was soon silenced.
The calm continued, and the Harpy was busy enough with
the prize, shifting the prisoners and reﬁtting both vessels,
which had very much suffered in the sails and rigging. There
was an occasional wonder on board the Harpy what that
strange vessel might be, who had turned the corvette and
enabled them to capture her, but when people are all very
busy, there is not much time for surmise.
Jack’s crew, with himself, consisted but of eight, one of
which was a Spaniard, and two were wounded. It therefore
left him but four, and he had also something to do, which was
to assist his wounded men, and secure his guns. Moreover,
Mesty did not think it prudent to leave the vessel a mile from
the Harpy with only two on board; besides, as Jack said, he
had had no dinner, and was not quite sure that he should ﬁnd
anything to eat when he went into the midshipmen’s berth;
he would therefore have some dinner cooked, and eat it be-
fore he went on board; in the meantime, they would try and
close with her. Jack took things always very easy, and he
said he should report himself at sunset. There were other
reasons which made Jack in no very great hurry to go on
board; he wanted to have time to consider a little, what he
should say to excuse himself, and also how he should plead
for the men. His natural correctness of feeling decided him,
in the ﬁrst place, to tell the whole truth, and in the next, his
kind feelings determined him to tell only part of it. Jack
need not have given himself this trouble, for, as far as re-
garded himself , he had fourteen thousand good excuses in
the bags that lay in the state-room; and as for the men, after
an action with the enemy, if they behave well, even mutiny
is forgiven. At last, Jack, who was tired with excitement’
and the hard work of the day, thought and thought until he
fell fast asleep, and instead of waking at sunset, did not wake,
till two hours afterwards; and Mesty did not call him, because

he was in no hurry himself to go on board “and boil de kettle
for de young gentlemen.”
When Jack woke up, he was astonished to ﬁnd that he
had slept so long; he went on deck; it was dark and still calm,
but he could easily perceive that the Harpy and corvette were
still hove-to, repairing damages. He ordered the men to
lower down the small boat, and leaving Mesty in charge, with
two cars he pulled to the Harpy. What with wounded men,
with prisoners, and boats going and coming between the
vessels, every one on board the Harpy were well employed;
and in the dark, Jack’s little boat came alongside without
notice. This should not have been the case, but it was, and
there was some excuse for it. Jack ascended the side, and
pushed his way through the prisoners, who were being mus-
tered to be victualled. He was wrapped up in one of the
gregos, and many of the prisoners wore the same.
Jack was amused at not being recognised: he slipped
down the main ladder, and had to stoop under the hammocks
of the wounded men, and was about to go aft to the captain’s
cabin to report himself , when he heard young Gossett crying
out, and the sound of the rope. “Hang me, if that brute
Vigors ain’t thrashing young Gossett,” thought Jack. “I
dare say the poor fellow has had plenty of it since I have
been away; I’ll save him this time, at least.” Jack, wrapped
up in his grego, went to the window of the berth , looked in,
and found it was as he expected. He cried out in an angry
voice, “Mr. Vigors, I’1l thank you to leave Gossett alone.”
At the sound of the voice, Vigors turned round with his colt
in his hand, saw Jack’s face at the window, and, impressed
with the idea that the reappearance was supernatural, uttered
a yell and fell down in a ﬁt— little Gossett also, trembling
in every limb, stared with his mouth open. Jack was satis-
ﬁed, and immediately disappeared. He then went aft to the
cabin, pushed by the servant, who was giving some orders
from the captain to the ofﬁcer on deck, and entering the
cabin, where the captain was seated with two Spanish ofﬁcers,
took off his hat and said, —-

“Come on board, Captain Wilson.”
Captain Wilson did not fall down in a ﬁt, but he jumped
up, and upset the glass before him.
“Merciful God, Mr. Easy, where did you come from?”
“From that ship astern, sir,” replied J ack.
“That ship astern! what is she? — where have you been
so long?”
“It’s a long story, sir,” replied Jack.
Captain Wilson extended his hand and shook Jack’s
heartily.
“At all events, I’m delighted to see you, boy: now sit
down and tell me your story in a few words; we will have it
in detail by-and-bye.”
“If you please, sir,’ said Jack, “we captured that ship
with the cutter the night after we went away—I’m not a
ﬁrst-rate navigator, and I was blown to the Zaffarine Islands,
where I remained two months for want of hands: as soon as I
procured them I made sail again — I have lost three men by
sharks, and I have two wounded in to-day’s ﬁght— the ship
mounts twelve guns, is half laden with lead and cotton prints,
has fourteen thousand dollars in the cabin, and three shot-
holes right through her — and the sooner you send some
people on board of her the better.”
This was not very intelligible, but that there were four-
teen thousand dollars and that she required hands sent on
board, was very satisfactorily explained. Captain Wilson
rang the bell, sent for Mr. Asper, who started back at the
sight of our hero — desired him to order Mr. Jolliffe to go on
board with one of the cutters, send the wounded men on
board, and take charge of the vessel, and then told Jack to
accompany Mr. Jolliffe, and to give him every information;
telling him that he would hear his story to-mor-row, when they
were not so very busy.

_~
CHAPTER XVII.
In which our Hero ﬁnds out that Trigonometry is not only necessary to
Navigation, but may be required in settling Affairs of Honour.
As Captain Wilson truly said, he was too busy even to
hear Jack’s story that night, for they were anxious to have
both vessels ready to make sail as soon as a breeze should
spring up, for the Spaniards had vessels of war at Carthagena,
which was not ten miles off, and had known the result of the
action: it was therefore necessary to change their position as
soon as possible. Mr. Sawbridge was on board the prize,
which was a corvette mounting two guns more than the Harpy,
and called the Cacafuogo.
She had escaped from Cadiz, run through the straits in
the night, and was three miles from Carthagena when she
was captured, which she certainly never would have been,
but for Jack’s fortunately blundering against the cape with
his armed vessel, so that Captain Wilson and Mr. Sawbridge
(both of whom were promoted, the ﬁrst to the rank of post-
captain, the second to that of commander) may be said to be
indebted to Jack for their good fortune. The Harpy had lost
nineteen men, killed and wounded, and the Spanish corvette
f0rty-seven. Altogether, it was a very creditable affair.
At two o’elock in the morning, the vessels were ready,
everything had been done that could be done in so short a
time, and they stood under easy sail during the night for
Gibraltar, the Nostra Signora del Carmen, under the charge
of J0lliife, keeping company. Jollitfe had the advantage
over his shipmates, of ﬁrst hearing Jack’s adventures, with
which he was much astonished as well as amused — even
Captain Wilson was not more happy to see Jack than was
the worthy master’s mate. About nine o’clock the Harpy
hove to, and sent a boat on board for our hero and the men
who had been so long with him in the prize, and then hoisted
out the pinnace to fetch on board the dollars, which were of
more importance. Jack, as he bade adieu to Jolliffe, took

out of his pocket, and presented him with the articles of war,
which, as they had been so useful to him, he thought Jolliife
could not do without, and then went down the side: the men
were already in the boat, casting imploring looks upon Jack,
to raise feelings of compassion, and Mesty took his seat by
our hero in a very sulky humour, probably because he did
not like the idea of having again “to boil de kettle for de
young gentlemen.” Even Jack felt a little melancholy at
resigning his command, and he looked back at the green
petticoat, which blew out gracefully from the mast, for Jolliife
had determined that he would not haul down the colours
under which Jack had fought so gallant an action.
Jack’s narration, as may be imagined, occupied a large
part of the forenoon; and although Jack did not attempt to
deny that he had seen the recall signal of Mr. Sawbridge, yet,
as his account went on, the captain became so interested,
that at the end of it he quite forgot to point out to Jack the
impropriety of not obeying orders. He gave Jack great
credit for his conduct, and was also much pleased with that
of Mesty. Jack took the opportunity of stating Mesty’s
aversion to his present employment, and his recommendation
was graciously received. Jack also succeeded in obtaining
the pardon of the men, in consideration of their subsequent
good behaviour; but notwithstanding this promise on the
part of Captain Wilson, they were ordered to be put in irons
for the present. However, Jack told Mesty, and Mesty told
the men, that they would be released with a reprimand when
they arrived at Gibraltar, so all that the men cared for was
a fair wind. _
Captain Wilson informed Jack, that after his joining the
admiral he had been sent to Malta with the prizes, and that,
supposing the cutter to have been sunk, he had written to his
father, acquainting him with his son’s death, at which our
hero was much grieved, for he knew what sorrow it would
occasion, particularly to his poor mother. “But,” thought
Jack , “if she is unhappy for three months, she will be over-
joyed for three more when she hears that 1_am alive, so it

will be all square at the end of the six; and as soon as I
arrive at Gibraltar I will write, and as the wind is fair, that
will be to-morrow or next day.”
After a long conversation Jack was graciously dismissed,
Captain Wilson being satisﬁed from what he had heard that
Jack would turn out a very good ofﬁcer, and had already
forgotten all about equality and the rights of man; but there
Captain Wilson was mistaken — tares sown in infancy are
not so soon rooted out.
Jack went on deck as soon as the captain had dismissed
him, and found the captain and ofﬁcers of the Spanish cor-
vette standing aft, looking very seriously at the Nostra Signora
del Carmen. When they saw our hero, whom Captain Wilson
had told them was the young ofﬁcer who had barred their
entrance into Carthagena, they turned their eyes upon him,
not quite so graciously as they might have done.
Jack, with his usual politeness, took off his hat to the
Spanish captain, and, glad to have an opportunity of sporting
his Spanish, expressed the usual wish, that he might live a
thousand years. The Spanish captain, who had reason to
wish that Jack had gone to the devil at least twenty-four
hours before, was equally complimentary, and then begged
to be informed what the colours were that J aek had hoisted
during the action. Jack replied that they were colours to -
which every Spanish gentleman considered it no disgrace to
surrender, although always ready to engage, and frequently
attempting to board. Upon which the Spanish captain was
very much puzzled. Captain Wilson, who understood a little
Spanish, then interrupted by observing —-
“By-the-bye, Mr. Easy, what colours did you hoist up?
we could not make them out. I see Mr. Jolliife still keeps
them upat the peak.”
“ Yes, sir,” replied Jack, rather puzzled what to call them,
but at last he replied, “that it was the banner of equality
and the rights of man.”
Captain Wilson frowned, and Jack, perceiving that he
was displeased, then told him the whole story, whereupon

Captain Wilson laughed, and Jack then also explained, in
Spanish, to the ofﬁcers of the corvette, who replied, “that
it was not the ﬁrst time, and would not be the last, that men
had got into a scrape through a petticoat.”
The Spanish captain complimented Jack on his Spanish,
which was really very good (for in two months, with nothing
else in the world to do, he had made great progress), and
asked him where he had learnt it.”
Jack replied, “At the Zaffarine Islands.”
“ Zaffarine Isles,” replied the Spanish captain; “they are
not inhabited.”
“Plenty of ground-sharks,” replied Jack.
The Spanish captain thought our hero a very strange fel-
low, to ﬁght under a green silk petticoat and to take lessons
in Spanish from the ground-sharks. However, being quite
as polite as Jack, he did not contradict him, but took a huge
pinch of snuif, wishing from the bottom of his heart that the
ground-sharks had taken Jack before he had hoisted that
confounded green petticoat. _
However, Jack was in high favour with the captain, and
all the ship’s company, with the exception of his four enemies
— the master, Vigors, the boatswain, and the purser’s steward.
As for Mr. Vigors, he had come to his senses again, and had
put his colt in his chest until Jack should take another cruise.
Little Gossett, at any insulting remark made by Vigors,
pointed to the window of the berth and grinned; and the
very recollection made Vigors turn pale, and awed him into
silence.
In two days they arrived at Gibraltar — Mr. Sawbridge
rejoined the ship — so did Mr. Jolliifc — they remained there
a fortnight, during which Jack was permitted to be continu-
ally on shore — Mr. Asper accompanied him, and Jack drew
a heavy bill to prove to his father that he was still alive. Mr.
Sawbridge made our hero relate to him all his adventures,
and was so pleased with the conduct of Mesty that he ap-
pointed him to a situation which was particularly suited to
him, — that of ship’s corporal. Mr. Sawbridge knew that it

ma. mnsnlrlmn nssv. 153
was an ofﬁce of trust, and provided that he could ﬁnd a man
ﬁt for it, he was very indifferent about his colour. M.esty
walked and strutted about at least three inches taller than he
was before. He was always clean, did his duty conscientiously,
and seldom used his cane.
“I think, Mr. Easy,” said the ﬁrst-lieutenant, “that as
you are so particularly fond of taking a cruise,” — for Jack
had told the whole truth, — “it might be as well that you
improve your navigation.”
“I do think myself, sir,” replied Jack with great modesty,
“that I am not yet quite perfect.”
“Well, then, Mr. Jolliffe will ‘teach you; he is the most
competent in this ship: the sooner you ask him the better,
and if you learn it as fast as you have Spanish, it will not
give you much trouble.”
Jack thought the advice good: the next day he was very
busy with his friend Jolliffe, and made the important dis-
covery that two parallel lines continued to inﬁnity would
never meet.
It must not be supposed that Captain Wilson and Mr.
Sawbridge received their promotion instanter. Promotion is
always attended with delay, as there is a certain routine in
the service which must not be departed from. Captain Wilson
had orders to return to Malta after his cruise. He therefore
carried his own despatches away from England — from Malta
the despatches had to be forwarded to Toulon to the admiral,
and then the admiral had to send to England to the admiralty,
whose reply had to come out again. All this, with the delays
arising from vessels not sailing immediately, occupied an
interval of between ﬁve and six months - during which time
there was no alteration in the ofﬁcers and crew of His Ma-
jesty’s sloop Harpy.
There had, however, been one alteration; the gunner,
Mr. Minus, who had charge of the ﬁrst cutter in the night
action in which our hero was separated from his ship,
carelessly loading his musket, had found himself minus his
right hand, which, upon the musket going off as he rammed

down, had gone oft‘ too. He was invalided and sent home
during Jack’s absence, and another had been appointed,
whose name was Tallboys. Mr. ‘l‘al1boys was a stout dumpv
man, with red face, and still redder hands; he had red hair
and red whiskers, and he had read a great deal — for Mr.
Tallboys considered that the gunner was the most important
personage in the ship. He had once been a captain’s clerk,
and having distinguished himself very much in cutting-out
service, had applied for and received his warrant as a gunner.
He had studied the “Art of Gunnery,” a part of which he
understood, but the remainder was above his comprehension:
he continued, however, to read it as before, thinking that by
constant reading he should understand it at last. He had
gone through the work from the title-page to the ﬁnis at least
forty times, and had just commenced it over again. He never
came on deck without the gunner’s “vade-mecum” in his
pocket, with his hand always upon it to refer to it in a
moment.
But Mr. Tallboys had, as we observed before, a great
idea of the importance of a gunner, and, among other quali-
ﬁcations, he considered it absolutely necessary that he should
be a navigator. He had at least ten instances to bring for-
ward of bloody actions, in which the captain and all the
commissioned ofﬁcers had been killed or wounded, and the
command of the ship had devolved upon the gunner.
“Now, sir,” would he say, “if the gunner is no navigator,
he is not ﬁt to take charge of His Majesty’s ships. The
boatswain and carpenter are merely practical men; but the
gunner. sir, is, or ought to be, scientiﬁc. Gunnery, sir, is a
science — we have our own disparts and our lines of sight —
our windage, and our parabolas, and projectile forces — and
our point blank, and our reduction of powder upon a graduated
scale. Now, sir, there’s no excuse for a gunner not being a
navigator; for knowing his duty as a gunner, he has the same
mathematical tools to work with.” Upon this principle, Mr.
’l‘allb0ys had added John Hamilton Moore to his library, and
had advanced about as far into navigation as he had in gun-


## p. 155 (#163) ############################################

ma. M.l.DSB1PM.AN usev. 155 .
ncry, that is, to the threshold, where he stuck fast, with all
his mathematical tools, which he did not know how to use.
‘l‘o do him justice, he studied for two or three hours every
day, and it was not his fault if he did not advance — but his
head was confused with technical terms; be mixed all up to-
gether, and disparts, since and cosines, parabolas, tangents,
windage, seconds, lines of sight, logarithms, projectiles, and
traverse sailing, quadrature, and Gunter’s scales, were all
crowded together, in a brain which had not capacity to re-
ceive the rule of three. “Too much learning,” said Festus
to the apostle, “hath made thee mad.” Mr. ’1‘allboys had
not wit enough to go mad, but his learning lay like lead upon
his brain: the more he read, the less he understood, at the
same time that he became more satisﬁed with his supposed
acquirements, and could not speak but in “mathematical
parables.”
“I understand, Mr. Easy,” said the gimner to him one
day, after they had sailed for Malta, “that you have entered
into the science of navigation — at your age it was high
time.”
“Yes,” replied Jack, “I can raise a perpendicular, at all
events, and box the compass.”
“Yes, but you have not yet arrived at the dispart of the
compass.”
“Not come to that yet,” replied Jack.
“Are you aware that a ship sailing’ describes a parabola
round the globe?”
“Not come to that yet,” replied Jack.
“And that any propelled body striking against another
ﬂies eif at a tangent?”
“Very likely,” replied Jack; “that is a ‘ sine’ that he don’t
like it.”
“ You have not yet entered into ‘acute’ trigonometry?”
“ Not come to that yet,” replied Jack.
“That will require very sharp attention.”
“I should think so,” replied Jack.

“ You will then ﬁnd out how your parallels of longitude ,
and latitude meet.” ‘
“Two parallel lines, if continued to inﬁnity, will never
meet,” replied Jack.
“I beg your pardon,” said the gunner.
“I beg yours,” said Jack.
Whereupon Mr. Tallboys brought up a small map of the
world, and showed Jack that all the parallels of latitude met
at a point at the top and the bottom.
“Parallel lines never meet,” replied Jack, producing
Hamilton Moore.
Whereupon Jack and the gunner argued the point, until
it was agreed to refer the case to Mr. Jolliife, who asserted,
with a smile, “That those lines were parallels and not pa-
rallels.”
As both were right, both were satisﬁed.
It was fortunate that Jack would argue in this instance;
had he believed all the confused assertions of the gunner, he
would have been as puzzled as the gunner himself. They
never met without an argument and a reference, and as Jack
was put right in the end, he only learnt the faster. By the
time that he did know something about navigation, he dis-
covered that his antagonist knew nothing. Before they ar-
rived at Malta, Jack could fudge a day’s work.
But at Malta Jack got into another scrape. Although Mr.
Smallsole could not injure him, he was still J ack’s enemy; the
more so as Jack had become very popular: V igors also sub-
mitted, planning revenge; but the parties in this instance
were the boatswain and purscr’s steward. Jack still continued
his forecastle conversations with Mesty: and the boatswain
and purser’s steward, probably from their respective ill-will
towards our hero, had become great allies. Mr. Easthupp
now put on his best j ket to walk the dog-watches with
Mr. Biggs, and they trxk every opportunity to talk at our
hero. - ,.
“ It’s my peculiar hopi Ion,” said Mr. Easthupp, one even-
ing, pulling at the frill of his shirt, “that a gentleman should

rm. mmsmrmsn sssv. 157
behave as a gentleman, and that if a gentleman professes
opinions of hequallity and such liberal sentiments, that he is
bound as a gentleman to hact up to them.”
“Very true, Mr. Easthupp; he is bound to act up to them;
and not because a person, who was a gentleman as well as
himself, happens not to be on the quarter-deck, to insult him
because he only has perfessed opinions like his own.”
Hereupon Mr. Biggs struck his rattan against the funnel,
and looked at our hero.
“Yes,” continued the purser’s steward, “I should like to
see the fellow who would have done so on shore; however, the
time will come when I can hagain pull on my plain coat, and
then the insult shall be vashed out in blood, Mr. Biggs.”
“And I’ll be cursed if I don’t some day teach a lesson to
the blackguard who stole my trousers.”
“Vas hall your money right, Mr. Biggs?” inquired the
purser’s steward.
“I didn’t count,” replied the boatswain magniﬁcently.
“No—gentle1nen are above that,” replied Easthupp; “but
there are many light-ﬁngered gentry about. The quantity of
vatches and harticles of value vich were lost ven I valked
Bond Street in former times is incredible.”
“I can say this, at all events,” replied the boatswain, “that
I should be always ready to give satisfaction to any person
beneath me in rank, after I had insulted him. I don’t stand
upon my rank, although I don’t talk about equality, damme
— no, nor consort with niggers.”
All this was too plain for our hero not to understand, so
Jack walked up to the boatswain, and taking his hat off, with
the utmost politeness, said to him —
“If I mistake not, Mr. Biggs, your conversation refers to
me.”
“Very likely it does,” replied the boatswain. “Listeners
hear no good of themselves.”
“It appears that gentlemen can’t converse without being
watched,” continued Mr. Easthupp, pulling up his shirt
collar.

“It is not the ﬁrst time that you have thought proper to
make very offensive remarks, Mr. Biggs; and as you appear
to consider yourself ill-treated in the affair of the trousers —-
for I tell you at once that it was I who brought them on board
— I can only say,” continued our hero, with a very polite
bow, “that I shall be most happy to give you satisfaction.” ‘
“I am your superior ofﬁcer, Mr. Easy,” replied the boat-
swain.
“ Yes, by the rules of the service; but you just now asserted
that you would waive your rank—indeed, I dispute it on this
occasion; I am on the quarter-deck, and you are not.”
“This is the gentleman whom you have insulted, Mr.
Easy,” replied the boatswain, pointing to the purser’s stew-
ard.
“Yes, Mr. Heasy, quite as good a gentleman as yourself,
although I av ad misfortunes — I ham of as old a family as
hany in the country,” replied Mr. Easthupp, now backed by
the boatswain; “many the year did I valk Bond Street, and
I ave as good blood in my weins as you, Mr. Heasy, hal-
though I have been misfortunatc — I’ve had hadmirals in my
family.”
“ You have grossly insulted this gentleman,” said Mr.
Biggs in continuation; “and notwithstanding all your talk of
equality, you are afraid to give him satisfaction —you shelter
yourself under your quarter-deck.”
“Mr. Biggs,” replied our hero, who was now very wroth,
“I shall go on shore directly we arrive at Malta. Let you
and this fellow put on plain clothes, and 1 will meet you both
— and then I‘ll show you whether I am afraid to give satis-
faction.”
“ One at a time,” said the boatswain.
“No, sir, not one at the time , but both at the same time
— I will ﬁght both or none. lf you are my superior ofﬁcer,
you must descend,” replied Jack, with an ironical sneer, “to
meet me, or 1 will not descend to meet that fellow, whom I
believe to have been little better than a pickpocket.”
This accidental hit of Jack’s made the purser’s steward

turn pale as a sheet, and then equally red. He raved ‘and
foamed amazingly, although he could not meet Jack’s indig-
nant look, who then turned round again.
“Now, Mr. Biggs, is this to be understood, or do you
shelter yourself under your forecastle? ”
“I’m no dodger,” replied the boatswain, “and _we will
settle the affair at Malta.”
At which reply Jack returned to Mesty.
“Massa Easy, I look at um face, dat fello, Eastop, he no
like it. I go shore wid you, see fair play, any how — sup-
pose I can?’-’
Mr. Biggs having declared that he would ﬁght, of course
had to look out for a second, and he ﬁxed upon Mr. Tallboys,
the gunner, and requested him to be his friend. Mr. Tallboys,
who had been latterly very much annoyed by Jack’s victories
over him in the science of navigation, and therefore felt ill-
will towards him, consented; but he was very much puzzled
how to arrange that three were to ﬁght at the same time, for
he had no idea of there being two duels; so he went to his
cabin and commenced reading. Jack, on the other hand,
dared not say a word to Jolliife on the subject, indeed there
was no one in the ship to whom he could conﬁde but Gas-
coigne: he therefore went to him, and although Gascoigne
thought it was excessively ‘infra dig.’ of Jack to meet even
the boatswain, as the challenge had been given there was no
retracting: he therefore consented, like all midshipmen, anti-
cipating fun, and quite thoughtless of the consequences.
The second day after they had been anchored in Valette
harbour, the boatswain and gunner, Jack and Gascoigne, ob-
tained permission to go on shore. Mr. Easthupp, the purser’s
steward, dressed in his best blue coat, with brass buttons and
velvet collar, the very one in which he had been taken up
when he had been vowing and protesting that he was a gen-
tleman, at the very time that his hand was abstracting a
pocket-book, went up on the quarter-deck, and requested the
same indulgence, but Mr. Sawbridge refused, as he required

him to return staves and hoops at the eooperage. Mesty also,
much to his mortiﬁcation, was not to be spared.
This was awkward, but it was got over by proposing that
the meeting should take place behind the cooperage at a cer-
tain hour, on which Mr. Easthupp might slip out, and borrow
a portion of the time appropriated to his duty, to heal the
breach in his wounded honour. So the parties all went on
shore, and put up at one of the small inns to make the neces-
sary arrangements.
Mr. Tallboys then addressed Mr. Gascoigne, taking him
apart while the boatswain amused himself with a glass of grog,
and our hero sat outside teazing a monkey.
“Mr. Gascoigne,” said the glmner, “I have been very
much puzzled how this duel should be fought, but I have at
last found it out. You see that there are three parties to ﬁght;
had there been two or four there would have been no difﬁ-
culty, as the right line or square might guide us in that in- "
stance; but we must arrange it upon the triangle in this."
Gascoigne stared; he could not imagine what was coming.
“Are you aware, Mr. Gascoigne, of the properties of an
equilateral triangle?”
“ Yes ,” replied the midshipman, “that it has three equal
sides — but what the devil has that to do with the duel?”
“Everything, Mr. Gaseoigne,” replied the gunner; “it has
resolved the great difﬁculty: indeed, the duel between three
can only be fought upon that principle. You observe,” said
the gunner, taking a piece of chalk out of his pocket, and
making a triangle on the table, “in this ﬁgure we have three
points, each equidistant from each other; and we have three
combatants — so that, placing one at each point, it is all fair
play for the three: Mr. Easy, for instance, stands here, the
boatswain here, and the pu.rser’s steward at the third corner.
Now, if the distance is fairly measured, it will be all right.”
“But then," replied Gascoigue, delighted at the idea,
“how are they to ﬁre?”
“It certainly is not of much consequence,” replied the
gunner, “but still, as sailors, it appears to me that they should

rm. mnsrnrmsn nssv. 161


ﬁre with the sun; that is, Mr. Easy ﬁres at Mr. Biggs, Mr.
Biggs ﬁres at Mr. Easthupp, and Mr. Easthupp ﬁres at Mr.
Easy; so that you perceive that each party has his shot at
one, and at the same time receives the ﬁre of another.”
Gascoigne was in ecstacies at the novelty of the proceed-
ing, the more so as he perceived that Easy obtained every
advantage by the arrangement.
“Upon my word, Mr. Tallboys, I give you great credit;
you have a profound mathematical head, and I am delighted
with your arrangement. Of course, in these affairs, the prin-
cipals are bound to comply with the arrangements of the se-
conds, and I shall insist upon Mr. Easy consenting to your
excellent and scientiﬁc proposal.”
Gascoigne went out, and pulling Jack away from the
monkey, told him what the gunner had proposed, at which
Jack laughed heartily.
The gunner also explained it to the boatswain, who did not
very well comprehend, but replied —
“I dare say it’s all right — shot for shot, and d—n all
favours.”
The parties then repaired to the spot with two pairs of
ship's pistols, which Mr. Tallboys had smuggled on shore;
and, as soon as they were on the ground, the gunner called
Mr. Easthupp out of the cooperage. In the meantime,
Gascoigne had been measuring an equilateral triangle of
twelve paces — and marked it out. Mr. Tallboys, on his
return with the purser’s steward, went over the ground, and
ﬁnding that it was “equal angles subtended by equal sides,”
declared that it was all right. Easy took his station, the
boatswain was put into his, and Mr. Easthupp, who was
quite in a mystery, was led by the gunner to the third posi-
tion.
“But, Mr. Tallboys,” said the purser’s steward, “I don’t
understand this. Mr. Easy will ﬁrst ﬁght Mr. Biggs, will he
not?”
“No,” replied the gunner, “this is a duel of three.
You will ﬁre at Mr. Easy, Mr. Easy will ﬁre at Mr. Biggs,

and Mr. Biggs will ﬁre at you. It is all arranged, Mr. East-
hupp.”
“But,” said Mr. Easthupp, “I do not understand it. \Vhy
is Mr. Biggs to ﬁre at me? I have no quarrel with Mr.
Biggs.”
“Because Mr. Easy ﬁres at Mr. Biggs, and Mr. Biggs must
have his shot as well.”
“If you have ever been in the company of gentlemen, Mr.
Easthupp,” observed Gascoigne, “you must know something
about duelling.” _
“Yes, yes, I’ve kept the best company, Mr. Gascoigne, and
I can give a gentleman satisfaction; but ——”
“Then, sir, if that is the case, you must know that your
honour is in the hands of your second, and that no gentleman
appeals.”
“Yes, yes, I know that, Mr. Gascoigne; but still I’ve no
quarrel with Mr. Biggs, and therefore, Mr. Biggs, of course
you will not aim at me.”
“Why you don’t think that I’m going to be ﬁred at for
nothing,” replied the boatswain; “no, no, I’ll have my shot
any how.”
“But at your friend, Mr. Biggs?”
“All the same, I shall ﬁre at somebody; shot for shot, and
hit the luckiest.”
“Vel. gentlemen, I purtest against these proceedings,” re-
plied Mr. Easthupp; “I came here to have satisfaction from
Mr. Easy, and not to be ﬁred at by Mr. Biggs.”
“Don’t you have satisfaction when you ﬁre at Mr. Easy,”
replied the gunner; “what more would you have?”
“I purtest against Mr. Biggs ﬁring at me.”
“ So you would have a shot without receiving one,” cried
Gascoigne: “the fact is, that this fellow’s a confounded
coward, and ought to be kicked into the cooperage again.”
At this affront Mr. Easthupp rallied, and accepted the pis-
tol offered by the gunner.
“You ear those words, Mr. Biggs; pretty language to use
to a gentleman. You shall ear from me, sir, as soon as the

ship is paid oﬁ‘. I purtest no longer, Mr. Tallboys; death be-
fore dishonour; I’m a gentleman, damme!”
At all events, the swell was not a very courageous gen-
tleman, for he trembled most exceedingly as he pointed his
pistol.
The gunner gave the word, as if he were exercising the
great, guns on board ship.
“Cock your locks!”— “Take good aim at the object!”——
“Fire!” — “Stop your vents!”
The only one of the combatants who appeared to comply
with the latter supplementary order was Mr. Easthupp, who
clapped his hand to his trousers behind, gave a loud yell,
and then dropped down; the bullet having passed clean
through his seat of honour, from his having presented his
broadside as a target to the boatswain as he faced towards
our hero. Jack’s shot had also taken effect, having passed
through both the boatswain’s. cheeks, without further mischief
than extracting two of his best upper double teeth, and for-
eing through the hole of the further cheek the boatswain’s
own quid of tobacco. As for Mr. Easthupp’s ball, as he was .
very unsettled, and shut his eyes before he ﬁred, it had gone
the Lord knows where.
The purser’s steward lay on the ground and screamed —
the boatswain spit his double teeth and two or three mouth-
fuls of blood out, and then threw down his pistols in a
rage.
“A pretty business, by God,” sputtered he; “he’s put my
pipe out. How the devil am I to pipe to dinner when I’m
ordered, all my wind ’scaping through the cheeks?”
In the meantime, the others had gone to the assistance of
the purser’s steward, who continued his vociferations. They
examined him, and considered a wound in that part not to be
dangerous.
“Hold your confounded bawling,” cried the gunner, “or
you’ll have the guard down here: you’re not hurt.” -
“Han’t hi?” roared the steward: “Oh, let me die, let me
die; don’t move me!”

“ Nonsense,” cried the gunner, “you must get up and walk
down to the boat; if you don’t we’ll leave you—hold your
tongue, confound you. You won’t?' then I’ll give you some-
thing to halloo for.”
Whereupon Mr. Tallboys commenced cufﬁng the poor
wretoh right and left, who received so many swinging boxes
of the ear that he was soon reduced to merely pitiful plaints
of “Oh, dear!—such inhumanity—I purtest —oh dear! must
I get up? I can’t, indeed.”
“I do not think he can move, Mr. Tallboys,” said Gas-
coigne; “I should think the best plan would be to call up two
of the men from the cooperage, and let them take him at once
to the hospital.”
The gunner went down to the cooperage to call the men,
Mr. Biggs, who had bound up his face as if he had a tooth-
ache, for the bleeding had been very slight, came up to the
purser’s steward.
“What the hell are you making such a howling about?
Look at me, with two shot-holes through my ﬁgure-head,
while you have only got one in your stern: I wish I could
change with you, by heavens, for I could use my whistle then
— now if I attempt to pipe, there will be such a wasteful ex-
penditure of his Majesty’s stores of wind, that I never shall
get out a note. A wicked shot of yours, Mr. Easy.”
“I really am very sorry,” replied Jack, with a polite bow,
“and I beg to oﬂer my best apology.”
During this conversation, the purser’s steward felt very
faint, and thought he was going to die.
“O dear! oh dear! what a fool I was; I never was a gen-
tleman — only a swell: I shall die; I never will pick a pocket
again — never — never — God forgive me ! ”
“Why, confound the fellow,” cried Gascoigne, “so you
were a pickpocket, were you?” ,
“I never will again,” replied the fellow in a faint voice.
“Hi’ll hamend and lead a good life — a drop of water— ohl
lagged at last!”
Then the poor wretch fainted away: and Mr. Tallboys

coming up with the men, he was taken on their shoulders and
walked oif to the hospital, attended by the gunner and also
the boatswain, who thought he might as well have a little
medical advice before he went on board.
“Well, Easy,” said Gascoigne, collecting the pistols and
tying them up in his handkerchief, “I’ll be shot, but we’re
in a pretty scrape; there’s no bushing this up. I’ll be hanged
if I care, it’s the best piece of fun I ever met with.” And at
the remembrance of it Gascoigne laughed till the tears ran
down his cheeks. Jaek’s mirth was not quite so excessive, as
he was afraid that the purser’s steward was severely hurt, and
expressed his fears.
“At all events, you did not hit him,” replied Gaseoigne;
“all you have to answer for is the boatswain’s mug,—I think
you’ve stopped his jaw for the future.”
“I’m afraid that our leave will be stopped for the future,”
replied Jack.
“That we may take our oaths of,” replied Gascoigne.
“Then look ‘you, Ned,” said Easy; “I’ve lots of dollars —
we may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb, as the say-
ing is. I vote that we do not go on board.”
“ Sawbridge will send and fetch us,” replied Ned; “but he
must ﬁnd us ﬁrst.”
“That won’t take long, for the soldiers will soon have our
description and rout us out. We shall be pinned in a couple
of days.”
“Confound it, and they say that the ship is to be hove
down, and that we shall be here six weeks at least, cooped up
on board in a broiling sun, and nothing to do but to watch
the pilot ﬁsh playing round the rudder, and munch bad
apricots. I won’t go on board. Look ye, Jack,” said Gas-
coigne, “have you plenty of money?”
“I have twenty doubloons, besides dollars,” replied Jack.
“Well, then, we will pretend to be so much alarmed at
the result of this duel that we dare not show ourselves lest
we should be hung. I will write a note and send it to Jolliife,
to say that we have hid ourselves until the affair is blown

over, and beg him to intercede with the captain and ﬁrst‘-
l1eutenant. I will tell him all the particulars, and refer to the
gunner for the truth of it; and then I know that, although
we should be punished, they will only laugh. But I will
pretend that Easthupp is killed, and we are frightened out of
our lives. That will be it, and then let’s get on board one of
the speronares which come with fruit from Sicily, sail in
the night for Palermo, and then we’ll have a cruise for
a fortnight, and when the money is all gone we’ll come
back.”
“That’s a capital idea, Ned, and the sooner we do it _the
better. I will write to the captain, begging him to get me
0E from being hung, and telling him where we have ﬂed to,
and that letter shall be given after we have sailed.”
They were two very nice lads — our hero and Gascoigne.

Shore.
Gssooreun and our hero were neither of them in uniform,
and they hastened to Nix Mangarc stairs, where they soon
picked up the padrone of a speronare. They went with him
into a wine shop , and with the assistance of a little English
from a Maltese boy, whose shirt hung out of his trousers,
they made a bargain, by which it was agreed that, for the
consideration of two doubloons, he would sail that evening
and land them at Gergenti or some other town in Sicily,
providing them with something to eat and gregos to sleep
upon.
Our two midshipmen then went back to the tavern from
which they had set off to ﬁght the duel, and ordering a good
dinner to be served in a back room, they amused themselves
with killing ﬂies, as they talked over the events of the day
and waited for their dinner.
As Mr. Tallboys did not himself think proper to go on

board till the evening, and Mr. Biggs also wished it to be
dark before he went up the ship’s side, the events of the duel
did not transpire till the next morning. Even then it was not
known from the boatswain or gunner, but by a hospital mate
coming on board to inform the surgeon that there was one of
their men wounded under their charge, but that he was doing
very well.
Mr. Biggs had ascended the side with his face bound up.
“ Confound that Jack Easy,” said he,- “I have only been
on leave twice since I sailed from Portsmouth. Once I was
obliged to come up the side without my trousers, and show
my bare stern to the whole ship’s company, and now I am
coming up and dare not show my ﬁgure-head.” He reported
himself to the ofﬁcer of the watch, and hastening to his cabin
went to bed and lay the whole night awake from pain, think-
ing what excuse he could possibly make for not coming on
deck next morning to his duty.
He was, however, saved this trouble, for Mr. Jolliife
brought the letter of Gascoigne up to Mr. Sawbridge, and
the captain had received that of our hero.
Captain Wilson came on board and found that Mr. Saw-
bridge could communicate all the particulars of which he had
not been acquainted by Jack; and after they had read over
Gascoigne’s letter in the cabin, and interrogated Mr. Tall-
boys, who was sent down under an arrest, they gave free
vent to their mirth.
“Upon my soul, there’s no end to Mr. Easy’s adventures,”
said the captain. “I could laugh at the duel, for after all it
is nothing — and he would have been let off with a severe re-
primand. But the foolish boys have set off in a speronare to
Sicily, and how the devil are we to get them back again?”
“ They’ll come back, sir,” replied Sawbridge, “when all
their money’s gone.”
"Yes, if they do not get into any more scrapes. That
young scamp Gascoigne is as bad as Easy, and now they are
together there’s no saying what may happen. I dine at the

governor’s to-day; how he will laugh when I tell him of this
new way of ﬁghting a duel!”
“Yes, sir, it is just the thing that will tickle old Tom.”
“We must ﬁnd out if they have got oif the island, Saw-
bridge, which may not be the case.”
But it was the case. Jack and Gascoigne had eaten a
very good dinner, sent for the monkey to amuse them till it
was dark, and there had waited till the padrone came to
them.
“What shall we do with the pistols, Easy?”
“Take them with us, and load them before we go — we
may want them. Who knows but there may be a mutiny on
board of the speronare? I wish we had Mesty with us.”
They loaded the pistols, took a pair each and put them in
their waists, concealed under their clothes, divided the am-
munition between them, and soon afterwards the padrone
came to tell them all was ready.
Whereupon Messrs. Gaseoigne and Easy paid their bill
and rose to depart, but the padrone informed them that he
should like to see the colour of their money before they went
on board. Jack, very indignant at the insinuation that he
had not sufﬁcient cash, pulled out a handful of doubloons,
and tossing two to the padrone, asked him if he was satisﬁed.
The padrone untied his sash, put in the money, and with
many thanks and protestations of service, begged our young
gentlemen to accompany him; they did so, and in a few
minutes were clear of Nix Mangare stairs, and, passing close
to His Majesty’s ship Harpy, were soon out of the harbour of
Vallette.
Of all the varieties of vessels which ﬂoat upon the wave,
there is not, perhaps, one that bounds over the water so
gracefully or so lightly as a speronare, or any one so pic-
turesque and beautiful to the eye of those who watch its
progress.
The night was clear, and the stars shone out brilliantly as
the light craft skimmed over the water, and a fragment of a
descending and waning moon threw its soft beams upon the

snow-white sail. The vessel, which had no deck, was full
of baskets, which had contained grapes and various fruits
brought from the ancient granary of Rome, still as fertile and
as luxuriant as ever. The crew consisted of the padrone, two
men and a boy; the three latter, with their gregos, or night
great-coats with hoods, sitting forward before the sail, with
their eyes ﬁxed on the land as they ﬂew past point after
point, thinking perhaps of their wives, or perhaps of their
sweethearts, or perhaps not thinking at all.
The padrone remained aft at the helm, offering every po-
liteness to our two young gentlemen, who only wished to be
left alone. At last they requested the padrone to give them
gregos to lie down upon, as they wished to go to sleep. He
called the boy to take the helm, procured them all they re-
quired, and then went forward. And our two midshipmen
laid down looking at the stars above them for some minutes,
without exchanging a word. At last Jack commenced —
“I have been thinking, Gascoigne, that this is very de-
lightful. My heart bounds with the vessel, and it almost ap-
pears to me as if the vessel herself was rejoicing in her
liberty. Here she is capering over the waves instead of being
tied by the nose with a cable and anchor.”
“That’s a touch of the sentimental, Jack,” replied Gas-
coigne; “but she is no more free than she was when at
anchor, for she now is forced to act in obedience to her
steersman, and go just where he pleases. You may just as
well say that a horse, if taken out of the stable, is free, with
the curb, and his rider on his back.” ‘
“That’s a touch of the rational, Ned, which destroys the
illusion. Never mind, we are free, at all events. What
machines we are on board of a man-of-war! We walk, talk,
eat, drink, sleep, and get up, just like clock-work; we are
wound up to go the twenty-four hours, and then wound up
again; just like old Smallsole does the chronometers.”
“Very true, Jack; but it does not appear to me, that,
hitherto, you have kept very good time: you require a little
more regulating,” said Gascoigne.

“How can you expect any piece of machinery to go well,
so damnably knocked about as a midshipman is?” replied
our hero.
“Very true, Jack; but sometimes you don’t keep any
time, for you don’t keep any watch. Mr. Asper don’t wind
you up. You don’t go at all.”
“No; because he allows me to go down; but still I do go,
Ned.”
“Yes, to your hammock — but it’s no go with old Small-
sole, if I want a bit of caulk. But, Jack, what do you say —
shall we keep watch to-night?”
“Why, to tell you the truth, 1 have been thinking the
same thing — I don’t much like the looks of the padrone -
he squints.”
“That’s no proof of anything, Jack, except that his eyes
are not straight: but if you do not like the look of him, I can
tell you that he very much liked the look of your doubloons
—~ I saw him start, and his eyes twinkled, and I thought at
the time it was a pity you had not paid him in dollars.”
“_It was very foolish in me, but at all events he has not
seen all. He saw quite enough, Ned.”
“Very true, but you should have let him see the pistols,
and not have let him see the doubloons.”
“Well, if he wishes to take what he has seen, he shall
receive what he has not seen — why, there are only four of
them?”
“Oh, -I have no fear of them, only it may be as well to
sleep with one eye open.”
“ When shall we make the land?”
“ ‘l‘o-morrow evening with this wind, and it appears to be
steady. Suppose we keep watch and watch, _and have our
pistols out ready, with the great coats just turned over them,
to keep them out of sight?”
“Agreed — it’s about twelve o’clock now — who shall
keep the middle watch?”
“I will, Jack, if you like it.”

“Well, then, mind you kick me hard, for I sleep devilish
sound. Good night, and keep a sharp look-out.”
Jack was fast asleep in less than ten minutes; and Gas-
coigne, with his pistols lying by him all ready for each hand,
sat up at the bottom of the boat.
There certainly is a peculiar providence in favour of mid-
shipmen compared with the rest of mankind; they have more
lives than a cat — always in the greatest danger, but always
escaping from it.
The padrone of the vessel had been captivated with the
doubloons which Jack had so foolishly exposed to his view,
and he had , moreover, resolved to obtain them. At the very
time that our two lads were conversing aft, the padrone was
talking the matter over with his two men forward, and it was
agreed that they should murder, riﬂe, and then throw them
overboard.
About two o’clock in the morning, the padrone came aft
to see if they were asleep, but found Gascoigne watching.
He returned aft again and again, but found the young man
still sitting up. Tired of waiting, anxious to possess the
money, and not supposing that the lads were armed, he went
once more forward and spoke to the men. Gascoigne had
watched his motions; he thought it singular that with three
men in the vessel, the helm should be conﬁded to the boy —
and at last he saw them draw their knives. He pushed our
hero, who woke immediately. Gascoigne put his hand over
J ack’s mouth, that he might not speak, and then whispered
his suspicions. Jack seized his pistols — they both cocked
them without noise, and then waited in silence, Jack still
lying down, while Gascoigne continued to sit up at the bot-
tom of the boat. At last Gascoigne saw the three men coming
aft — he dropped one of his pistols for a second to give Jack
a squeeze of the hand, which was returned, and as Gascoigne
watched them making their way through the piles of empty
baskets he leaned back as if he was slumbering. The pa-
drone, followed by the two men, was at last aft,—they paused
a moment before they stepped over the strengthening plank,

which ran from side to side of the boat between them and the
midshipmen, and as neither of them stirred, they imagined
that both were asleep — advanced and raised their knives,
when Gascoigne and Jack, almost at the same moment, each
discharged their pistols into the breast of the padrone and
one of the men, who was with him in advance, who both fell
with the send aft of the boat, so as to encumber the midship-
men with the weight of their bodies. The third man started
back. J ack, who could not rise, from the padrone lying
across his legs, took a steady aim with his second pistol, and
the third man fell. The boy at the helm, who, it appeared,
either was aware of what was to be done, or seeing the men
advance with their knives, had acted upon what he saw, also
drew his knife and struck at Gascoigne from behind; the
knife fortunately, after slightly wounding Gascoigne on the
shoulder, had shut on the boy’s hand — Gascoigne sprang up
with his other pistol — the boy started back at the sight of
it, lost his balance, and fell overboard.
Our two midshipmen took a few seconds to breathe.
“I say, Jack,” said Gascoigne at last, “did you ever —”
“No, I never ——” replied Jack.
“What’s to be done now?”
“Why as we’ve got possession, Ned, we had better put a
man at the helm — for the speronare is having it all her own
way.” \
“ Very true,” replied Gascoigne, “and as I can steer better
than you, I suppose it must be me.”
Gascoigne went to the helm, brought the boat up to the
wind, and then they resumed their conversation.
“That rascal of a boy gave me a devil of a lick on the
shoulder; I don’t know whether he has hurt me — at all
events it’s my left shoulder, so I can steer just as well. I
wonder whether the fellows are dead.”
“The padrone is, at all events,” replied Jack. “It was as
much as I could do to get my legs from under him — but
we’ll wait till daylight before we see to that — in the mean-
time, I’ll load the pistols again.”

“The day is breaking now — it will be light in half an
hour or less. What a devil of a spree, Jack!”
“Yes, but how can one help it? We ran away because
two men are Wounded — and now we are obliged to kill four
in self-defence.”
“Yes, but that is not the end of it; when we get to Sicily
what are we to do? we shall be imprisoned by the authorities
— perhaps hung.”
“We’ll argue that point with them,” replied J aek.
“We had better argue the point between ourselves, Jack,
and see what will be the best plan to get out of our scrape.”
“I think that we just have got out of it— never fear but
we’ll get out of the next. Do you know, Gascoigne, it ap-
pears to me very odd, but I can do nothing but there’s a
bobbery at the bottom of it."
“You certainly have a great talent that way, Jack. Don’t
I hear one of those poor fellows groan?”
“I should think that not impossible.”
“What shall we do with them?”
“We will argue that point, Ned—we must either keep
their bodies, or we must throw them overboard. Either tell
the whole story, or say nothing about it.”
“That’s very evident; in short, we must do something, for
your argument goes no further. But now let us take up one
of your propositions.”
“Well, then, suppose we keep the bodies on board, run
into a seaport, go to the authorities, and state all the facts,
what then?”
“We shall prove, beyond all doubt, that we have killed
three men, if not four; but we shall not prove that we were
obliged so to do, Jack. And then we are heretics — we shall
be put in prison till they are satisﬁed of our innocence, which
we never can prove, and there we shall remain until we have
written to Malta, and a man-of-war comes to redeem us, if we
are not stabbed, or something else, in the meantime.”
“That will not be a very pleasant cruise,” replied Jack,
“Now let’s argue the point on the other side.”

“There is some difﬁculty there — suppose we throw their
bodies overboard, toss the baskets after them, wash the boat
clean, and make for the ﬁrst port. We may chance to hit
upon the very spot from which they sailed, and then there
will be a pack of wives and children, and a populace with
knives, asking us what has become of the men of the boat! ”
“I don’t much like the idea of that,” said Jack.
“And if we don’t have such bad luck, still we shall be
interrogated as to who we are, and how we were adrift by
ourselves.”
“There will be a difﬁculty about that again—\ve must
swear that it is a party of pleasure, and that we are gentlemen
yachting.”
“Without a crew or provisions — yachts don’t sail with a
cleanswept hold, or gentlemen without a spare shirt—we
have nothing but two gallons of water and two pairs of
pistols.”
“I have it,” said Jack—“we are two young gentlemen
in our own boat who went out to Gozo with pistols to shoot
sea-mews, were caught in a gale, and blown down to Sicily
— that will excite interest.”
“That’s the best idea yet, as it will account for our having
nothing in the boat. Well, then, at all events, we will get
rid of the bodies; but suppose they are not dead — we cannot
throw them overboard alive, — that will be murder.”
“Very true,” replied Jack, “then we must shoot them
ﬁrst, and toss them overboard afterwards.”
“Upon my soul, Easy, you are an odd fellow: however,
go and examine the men, and we’ll decide that point by-and-
bye: you had better keep your pistol ready cocked, for they
may be shamming.”
“Devil a bit of sham here, any how,” replied Jack, pulling
at the body of the padrone , “and as for this fellow you shot,
you might put your ﬁst into his chest. Now for the third,”
continued Jack, stepping over the strengthening piece —
“he’s all among the baskets. I say, my cock, are you dead?”
and Jack enforced his question with a kick in the ribs. The

man groancd. “That’s unlucky, Gascoignc, but however I’ll
soon settle him,” said Jack, pointing his pistol.
“ Stop, Jack,” cried Gascoigne, “it really will be murder."
“No such thing, Ned; I’ll just blow his brains out, and
then I’ll come aft and argue the point with you.”
“Now do oblige me by coming aft and arguing the point
ﬁrst. Do, Jack, I beg of you — I entreat you.”
“With all my heart,” replied Jack, resuming his seat by
Gascoigne; “ I assert, that in this instance killing’s no murder.
You will observe, Ned, that by the laws of society, any one
who attempts the life of another has forfeited his own; at the
same time, as it is necessary that the fact should be clearly
proved, and justice be duly administered, the parties are tried,
convicted, and then are sentenced to the punishment.”
“I grant all that.”
“In this instance the attempt has been clearly proved; we
are the witnesses, and are the judges and jury, and society
in general, for the best of all possible reasons, because there
is nobody else. These men’s lives being therefore forfeited
to society. belong to us; and it does not follow because they
were not all killed in the attempt, that therefore they are not
now to be brought out for punishment. And as there is no
common hangman here, we, of course, must do this duty as
well as every other. I have now clearly proved that 1 am
justiﬁed in what I am about to do. But the argument does
not stop there — self-preservation is the ﬁrst law of nature,
and if we do not get rid of this man, what is the consequence?
— that we shall have to account for his being wounded, and
then, instead of judges, we shall immediately be placed in
the position of culprits, and have to defend ourselves without
witnesses. We therefore risk our lives from a misplaced lenity
towards a wreteh unworthy to live.”
“Your last argument is strong, Easy, but I cannot consent
to your doing what may occasion you uneasiness hereafter
when you think of it.”
“Pooh! nonsense —I am a philosopher.”
“Of what school, Jack? Oh, I presume, you are a disciple

of Mesty’s. I do not mean to say that you are wrong, but
still hear my proposition. Let us lower down the sail, and
then I can leave the helm to assist you We will clear the
vessel of everything except the man who is still alive. At
all events, we may wait a little, and if at last there is no help
for it, I will then agree with you to launch him overboard,
even if he is not quite dead.”
“Agreed; even by your own making out, it will be no
great sin. He is half dead already — I only do half the work
of tossing him over, so it will be only quarter murder on my
part, and he would have shown no quarter on his.” Here
Jack left of arguing and punning, and went forward and
lowered down the sail. “ I’ve half a mind to take my doubloons
back,” said Jack, as they launched over the body of the
padrone, “but he may have them — I wonder whether they’ll
ever turn up again.”
“Not in our time, Jack,” replied Gascoigne.
The other body, and all the basket lumber, &c., were then
tossed over, and the boat was cleared of all but the man who
was not yet dead.
“Now let’s examine the fellow, and see if he has any
chance of recovery,” said Gascoigne.
The man lay on his side; Gascoigne turned him over, and
found that he was dead.
“Over with him, quick," said Jack, “before he comes to
life again.”
The body disappeared under the wave — they again
hoisted the sail, Gascoigne took the helm, and our hero pro-
ceeded to draw water and wash away the stains of blood; h e
then cleared the boat of vine-leaves and rubbish, with which
it was strewed, swept it clean fore and aft, and resumed his
seat by his comrade.
“There,” said Jack, “now we’ve swept the decks, we
may pipe to dinner. I wonder whether there is anything to
eat in the locker.”
Jack opened it, and found some bread, garlic, sausages,
a bottle of aquadente, and a jar of wine.

“So the padrone did keep his promise, after all.”
“Yes, and had you not tempted him with the sight of so
much gold, might now have been alive.”
“ To which I reply, that if you had not advised our going
05 in a speronare he would now have been alive.”
“And if you had not fought a duel, I should not have
given the advice.”
“And if the boatswain had not been obliged to come on
board without his trousers, at Gibraltar, 1 should not have
fought a duel.”
“And if you had not joined the ship, the boatswain would
have had his trousers on.”
“And if‘ my father had not been a philosopher, I should
not have gone to sea; so that it is all my father’s fault, and
hte has killed fpurﬁmep ofighe coplst pg Sicily, piithoultik knowing

ment; so, having settled that poiiit, let us go to dinner.”
Having ﬁnished their meal, Jack went forward and ob-
served the land ahead; they steered the same course for three
or four hours.
“We must haul our wind more,” said Gascoigne; “it will
not do to put into any small town: we have now to choose
whlethgr ‘we shall lantti on the coast and sink the speronare,
or an a some arge own.
“We must argue that point,” replied Jack.
“In the meantime, do you take the helm, for my arm is
quite tired,” replied Gascoigne; “you can steer well enough:
by-the-bye I may as well look at my shoulder for it is quite
stiff.” Gas,coigne pulled off his coat, and fbund his shirt
blood and stickin to the wound, which, as we before ob-

served, was slight. He again took the helm, while Jack
washed it clean, and then bathed it with aquadente.

“We shall fall in with plenty of boats and vessels if we
coast it up to Palermo, and they may overhaul us.”
“We shall fall in with plenty of people if we go on shore,
and they will overhaul us.”
“Do you know, Jack, that I wish we were back and
alongside of the Harpy; I’ve had cruising enough.”
“My cruises are so unfortunate,” replied Jack; “they are
too full of adventure; but then I have never yet had a cruise
on shore. Now, if we could only get to Palermo, we should
be out of all our difﬁculties.”
“The breeze freshens, Jack,” replied Gascoigne; “and it
begins to look very dirty to windward. I think we shall have
a gale.” ‘
“Pleasant—I know what it is to be short-handed in a
gale; however, there’s one comfort, we shall not be blown off
shore this time.”
“ No, but we may be wrecked on a lee shore. She cannot
carry her whole sail, Easy; we must lower it down, and take
in a reef; the sooner the better, for it will be dark in an hour.
Go forward and lower it down, and then I’ll help you.”
Jack did so, but the sail went into the water, and he could
not drag it in.
“Avast heaving,” said Gascoigne, “till I throw her up
and take the wind out of it.”
This was done; they reefed the sail, but could not hoist it
up: if Gascoigne left the helm to help Jack, the sail ﬁlled; if
he went to the helm and took the wind out of ‘the sail, Jack
was not strong enough to hoist it. The wind increased rapidly,
and the sea got up; the sun went down, and with the sail half
hoisted, they could not keep to the wind, but were obliged
to run right for the land. The speronare ﬂew, rising on the
crest of the waves with half her keel clear of the water: the
moon was already up, and gave them light enough to perceive
that they were not ﬁve miles from the coast, which was lined '
with foam.
“At all events, they can‘t accuse us of running away with
the boat,” observed Jack; “for she’s running away with us.”

“Yes,” replied Gascoigne , dragging at the tiller with all
his strength; “she has taken the bit between her teeth.”
“I wouldn’t care if I had a bit between mine,” replied
.IlIa<:il-r?;” “for I feel devlhsh hungry again. What do you say,

“With all my heart,” replied Gascoigne; “but, do you
know, Easy, it may be the last meal we ever make.”
“Then I vote it’s a good one — but why so, Ned?”
“In half an hour, or thereabouts, we shall be on shore.”
“Well, that’s where we want to go.”
“Yes, but the sea runs high, and the boat may be dashed
to pieces on the rocks.” ,
“Then we shall be asked no questions about her or the
men.”
“Very true, but a lee shore is no joke; we may be knocked
to pieces as well as the boat— even swimming may not help
us. If we could ﬁnd a cove or sandy beach, we might, perhaps,
manage to get on shore.”
- “Well,” replied Jack, “I have not been long at sea, and,
of course, cannot know much about these things. I have been
blown off shore, but I never have been blown on. It may be
as you say, but I do not see the great danger — let’s run her
right up on the beach at once.”
“That’s what I shall try to do,” replied Gaseoigne, who
had been four years at sea, and knew very well what he was
about.
Jack handed him a huge piece of bread and sausage.
“Thank ye, I cannot eat.”
“I can,” replied Jack, with his mouth full.
Jack ate while Gaseoigne steered; _and the rapidity with
which the speronare rushed to the beach was almost fright-
ful. She darted like an arrow from wave to wave, and ap-
peared as if mocking their attempts as they curled their sum-
mits almost over her narrow stern. They were within a mile
of the beach, when Jack, who had ﬁnished his supper, and
was looking at the foam boiling on the coast, exclaimed—
“That’s very ﬁne — very beautiful, upon my soul!”

“He cares for nothing,” thought Gascoigne; “he appears
to have no idea of danger.”
“ Now, my dear fellow,” said Gascoigne, “in a few minutes
we shall be on the rocks. I must continue at the helm, for
the higher she is forced up the better chance for us; but we
may not meet again, so if we do not,-go0d-bye, and God
bless you.”
“Gascoigne,” said Jack, “you are hurt, and I am not;
your shoulder is stiff, and you can hardly move your left arm.
Now I can steer for the rocks as well as you. Do you go to
the bow, and there you will have a better chance. — By-the-
bye,” continued he, picking up his pistols, and sticking them
into his waist, “I won’t leave them, they’ve served us too good
a turn already. Gascoigne, give me the helm.”
“No, no, Easy.”
“I say yes,” replied Jack, in a loud, authoritative tone,
“ and what’s more, I will be obeyed, Gascoigne. I have nerve,
if I havn’t knowledge, and at all events I can steer for the
beach. I tell you, give me the helm. Well, then, if you won’t,
I must take i .”
Easy wrested the tiller from Gascoigne’s hand, and gave
him a shove forward.
“Now do you look out ahead, and tell me how to steer.”
Whatever may have been Gascoigne’s feelings at this be-
haviour of our hero’s, it immediately occurred to him that he
could not do better than to run the speronare to the safest
point, and that therefore he was probably more advantage-
ously employed than if he were at the helm. He went for-
ward and looked at the rocks, covered at one moment with
the tumultuous waters, and then pouring down cascades from
their sides as the waves recoiled. He perceived a chasm right
ahead, and he thought if the boat was steered for that, she
must be thrown up so as to enable them to get clear of her,
for, at every other part, escape appeared impossible.
“Starboard a little — that’ll do. Steady— port it is —
port. — Steer small, for your life, Easy. Steady now—mind
the yard don’t hit your head — hold on.”

The speronare was at this moment thrown into a large
cleft in a rock, the sides of which were nearly perpendicular;
nothing else could have saved them, as, had they struck the
rock outside, the boat would have been dashed to pieces, and
its fragments have disappeared in the undertow. As it was,
the cleft was not four feet more than the width of the boat,
and as the waves hurled her up into it, the yard of the spe-
ronare was thrown fore and aft with great violence, and had
not Jack being warned, he would have been struck overboard
without a chance of being saved; but he crouched down, and
it passed over him. As the water receded, the boat struck,
and was nearly dry between the rocks, but another wave
followed, dashing the boat further up, but, at the same time,
ﬁlling it with water. The bow of the boat was now several
feet higher than the stern, where Jack held on; and the weight
of the water in her, with the force of the returning waves,
separated her right across abaft the mast. Jack perceived
that the after part of the boat was going out again with the
wave; he caught hold of the yard which had swung fore and
aft, and as he clung to it, the part of the boat on which he
had stood disappeared from under him, and was swept away
by the returning current.
Jack required the utmost of his strength to maintain his
position until another wave ﬂoated him, and dashed him
higher up: but he knew his life depended on holding on to
the yard, which he did, although under water, and advanced
several feet. When the wave receded, he found footing on
the rock, and still clinging, he walked till he had gained the
fore part of the boat, which was wedged ﬁrmly into a narrow
part of the cleft. The next wave was not very large, and he
had gained so much that it did not throw him off his legs. He
reached the rock, and as he climbed up the side of the chasm
to gain the ledge above, he perceived Gascoigne standing
above him, and holding out his hand to his assistance.
“ Well,” says Jack, shaking himself to get rid of the water,
“here we are ashore, at last— I had no idea of anything like
this. The rush back of the water was so strong that it has

almost torn my arms out of their sockets. How very lucky I
sent you forward with your disabled shoulder! By-the-bye,
now that it’s all over, and you must see that I was right, I beg
to apologise for my rudeness.”
“There needs no apology for saving my life, Easy,” rc-
plied Gaseoigne, trembling with the cold; “ and no one but you
would ever have thought of making one at such a moment.”
“I wonder whether the ammunition’s dry,” said Jack; “I
put it all in my hat.”
Jack took off his hat, and found the cartridges had not
suffered.
“Now, then, Gascoigne, what shall we do?”
“I hardly know,” replied Gascoigne.
“Suppose, then, we sit down and argue the point.”
“ No,I thank you, there will be too much cold water thrown
upon our arguments — I’m half dead; let us walk on.”
“With all my heart,” said Jack, “it’s devilish steep, but
I can argue up hill or down hill, wet or dry — I’m used to it
—for, as I told you before, Ned, my father is a philosopher,
and so am I.”
“By theLord! youare,” replied Gaseoigne, as he walked on.

Ova hero and his comrade climbed the precipice, and,
after some minutes’ severe toil, arrived at the summit, when
they sat down to recover themselves. The sky was clear, al-
though the gale blew strong. They had an extensive view of
the coast, lashed by the angry waves.
“It’s my opinion, Ned,” said Jack, as he surveyed the ex-
panse of troubled water, “that we’re just as well out of that.”
f‘I agree with you, Jack; but it’s also my opinion that we
should be just as well out of this, for the wind blows through
one. Suppose we go a little further inland, where we may
ﬁnd some shelter‘ till the morning.”

“It’s rather dark to ﬁnd anything,” rejoined our hero;
“ but however, a westerly gale on the top of a mountain with
wet clothes in the middle of the night, with nothing to eat or
drink, is not the most comfortable position in the world, and
we may change for the better.”
They proceeded over a ﬂat of a hundred yards, and then
descended — the change in the atmosphere was immediate.
As they continued their march inland, they came to a high
road, which appeared to run along the shore, and they turned
into it; for, as Jack said very_truly, a road must lead to some-
thing. After a quarter of an hour’s walk, they again heard
the rolling of the surf, and perceived the white walls of
houses.
“Here we are at last,” said Jack. “I wonder if any one
will turn out to take us in, or shall we stow away for the night
in one of those vessels hauled up on the beach?”
“Reeollect this time, Easy,” said Gaseoigne, “not to show
your money; that is, show only a dollar, and say you have no
more, or promise to pay when we arrive at Palermo; and it
they will neither trust us, nor give to us, we must make it out
as we can.”
“How the cursed dogs bark! I think we shall do very
well this time, Gascoigne; we do not look as if we were worth
robbing, at all events, and we have the pistols to defend our-
selves with if we are attacked. Depend upon it I will show
no more gold. And now let us make our arrangements. Take
you one pistol and take half the gold —I have it all in my
right-hand pocket — my dollars and pistarenes in my left.
You shall take half of them too. We have silver enough to
go on with till we are in a safe place.”
Jack then divided the money in the dark, and also gave
Gascoigne a pistol. -
“Now then, shall we knock for admittance? — Let’s ﬁrst
walk through the village, and see if there’s anything like an
inn. Those yelping curs will soon be at our heels; they come
nearer and nearer every time. There’s a cart, and it’s full-of ,

straw — suppose we go to bed till to-morrow morning — we
shall be warm, at all events.”
“Yes,” replied Gascoigne, “and sleep much better than
in any of the cottages. I have been in Sicily before, and you
have no idea how the ﬂeas bite.”
Our two midshipmen climbed up into the cart, nestled
themselves into the straw, or rather Indian corn leaves, and
were soon fast asleep. As they had not slept for two nights,
it is not to be wondered at that they slept soundly — so
soundly, indeed, that about two hours after they had got into
their comfortable bed, the peasant, who had brought to the
village some casks of wine to be shipped and taken down the
coast in a felucca, yoked his bullocks, and not being aware
of his freight, drove oft‘, without in any way disturbing their
repose, although the roads in Sicily are not yet macadamised.
The jolting of the roads rather increased than disturbed
the sleep of our adventurers; and, although there were some
rude shocks, it only had the effect of making them fancy in
their dreams that they were again in the boat, and that she
was still dashing against the rocks. In about two hours, the
cart arrived at its destination — the peasant unyoked his bul-
locks and led them away. The same cause will often produce
contrary effects: the stopping of the motion of the cart dis-
turbed the rest of our two midshipmen; they turned round in
the straw, yawned, spread out their arms, and then awoke.
Gascoigne, who felt considerable pain in his shoulder, was
the ﬁrst to recall his scattered senses.
“Easy,” cried he, as he sat up and shook off the corn
leaves.
“Port it is,” said Jack, half dreaming.
“Come, Easy, you are not on board now. Rouse and bitt.”
Jack then sat up and looked at Gascoigne. The forage
in the cart was so high round them that they could not see
above it; they rubbed their eyes, yawned, and looked at each
other.
“Have you any faith in dreams?” said Jack to Gas-
eoigne, “because I had a very queer one last night.”

‘ MR. mnsnmmsu EASY.‘ 185
“Well, so had I,” replied Gascoigne. “I dreamt that the
cart rolled by itself into the sea, and went away with us right
in the wind’s eye back to Malta; and considering that it never
was built for such service, she behaved uncommonly well.
Now, what was your dream?” -
“Mine was, that we woke up and found ourselves in the
very town from which the speronare had sailed, and that
they had found the fore part of the speronare among the
rocks, had recognised her, and picked up one of our pistols.
That they had laid hold of us, and had insisted that we had
been thrown on shore in the boat, and asked us what had be-
come of the crew — they were just seizing us, when I awoke.”
“ Your dream is more likely to come true than mine, Easy;
but still 1 think we need not fear that. At the same time,
we had better not remain here any longer; and it occurs to
me, that if we tore our clothes more, it would be advisable
— we shall, in the ﬁrst place, look more wretched; and, in
the next place, can replace them with the dress of the coun-
try, and so travel without exciting suspicion. You know that
I can speak Italian pretty well.”
“I have no objection to tear my clothes if you wish,” re-
plied Jack; “at the same time give me your pistol; I will
draw the charges and load them again. They must be
- wet.”
Having reloaded the pistols and rent their garments, the
two midshipmen stood up in the cart and looked about
them.
“Halloo! — why how’s this, Gaseoigne? last night we
were close to the beach, and among houses, and now — where
the devil are we? You dreamt nearer the mark than I did, for
the cart has certainly taken a cruise.”
“ We must have slept like midshipmen, then,” replied Gas~
coigne: “surely it cannot have gone far.”
“Here we are, surrounded by hills on every side, for at
least a couple of miles. Surely some good genius has trans-
ported us into the interior, that we might escape from the re-

latives of the crew whom I dreamt about,” said Jack, looking
at Gascoigne.
‘As it afterwards was known to them, the speronare had
sailed from the very seaport in which they had arrived that
night, and where they had got into the cart. The wreck of
the speronare had been found, and had been recognised, and
it was considered by the inhabitants that the padrone and his
crew had perished in the gale. Had they found our two mid-
shipmen and questioned them, it is not improbable that sus-
picion might have been excited, and the results have been
such as our hero had conjured up in his dream. But, as we
said before, there is a peculiar providence for midshipmen.
On a minute survey, they found that they were in an open
space which, apparently, had been used for thrashing and win-
nowing maize , and that the cart was standing under a clump
of trees in the shade.
“There ought to be a house hcreabouts,” said Gascoigne;
“I should think that behind the trees we shall ﬁnd one. Come,
Jack, you are as hungry as I am, I’ll answer for it: we must
look out for a breakfast somewhere.”
“ If they won’t give us something to eat, or sell it,” replied
Jack, who was ravenous, clutching his pistol, “I shall take
it— I consider it no robbery. The fruits of the earth were
made for us all, and it never was intended that one man
should have a superﬂuity and another starve. The laws of
equality —— ”
“May appear very good arguments to a starving man, I
grant, but still, won’t prevent his fellow creatures from hang-
ing him,” replied Gascoigne. “None of your confounded non-
sense, Jack; no man starves with money in his pocket, and as
long as you have that, leave those that have none to talk about
equality and the rights of man.”
“I should like to argue that point with you, Gascoigne.”
“Tell me, do you prefer sitting down here to argue, or to
look out for some breakfast, Jack?”
“Oh, the argument may be put off, but hunger cannot."
_“Tha’s very good philosophy, Jack, so let’s go on.”

They went through the copse of wood, which was very
thick, and soon discovered the wall of a large house on the
other side.
“All right,” said Jack; “but still let us reconnoitrc. It’s
not a farm-house; it must belong to a person of some con-
sequence — all the better—thcy will see that we are gentle-
men, notwithstanding our tattered dress. I suppose we are to
stick to the story of the sea-mews at Gozo?”
“Yes,” replied Gascoigne; “I can think of nothing better.
But the English are well received in this island; we have
troops at Palermo.”
“Have we? I wish I was sitting down at the mess-table —
but what’s that? a woman screaming? Yes, by heavens! —
come along, Ned.” And away dashed Jack towards the house,
followed by Gascoigne. As they advanced the screams re-
doubled; they entered the porch, burst into the room from
whence they proceeded, and found an elderly gentleman de-
fending himself against two young men, who were held back
by_an elderly and a young lady. Our hero and his comrade
had both drawn their pistols, and just as they burst open the
door, the old gentleman who defended himself against such
odds had fallen down. The two others burst from the wo-
men, and were about to pierce him with their swords, when
Jack seized one by the collar of his coat and held him_fast,
pointing the muzzle of the pistol to his ear: Gascoigne did
the same to the other. It was a very dramatic tableau. The
two women ﬂew to the elderly gentleman and raised him up;
the two assailants being held just as dogs hold pigs by the
ear, trembling with fright, with the points of their rapiers
dropped, looked at the midshipmen and the muzzles of their
pistols with equal dismay; at the same time, the astonishment
of the elderly gentleman and the women, at such an unexpected
deliverance, was equally great. There was a silence for a
few seconds.
“Ned,” at last said Jack, “tell these chaps to drop their
swords, or we ﬁre.”
Gascoigne gave the order in Italian, and it was complied

with. The midshipmen then possessed themselves of the
rapiers, and gave the young men their liberty. ’
The elderly gentleman at last broke the silence.
“It would appear, signors, that there was a special inter-
ference of Providence, to prevent you from committing a foul
and unjust murder. Who these are who have so opportunely
come to my rescue, I know not, but thanking them as I do
now, I think that you will yourselves, when you are calm,
also thank them for having prevented you from committing an
act whichwould have loaded you with remorse, and embittered
your future existence. Gentlemen, you are free to depart:
you, Don Silvio, have indeed disappointed me; your grati-
tude should have rendered you incapable of such conduct: as
for you, Don Scipio, you have been misled; but you both
have, in one point, disgraced yourselves. Ten days back my
sons were both here, — why did you not come then? If you
sought revenge on me , you could not have inﬂicted it deeper
than through my children, and at least you would not have
acted the part of assassins in attacking an old man. Take
your swords, gentlemen, and use them better henceforth.
Against future attacks I shall be well prepared.”
Gascoigne, who perfectly understood what was said, pre-
sented the sword to the young gentleman from whom he had
taken it— our hero did the same. The two young men re-
turned them to their sheaths, and quitted the room without
saying a word.
“Whoever you are, I owe to you and thank you for my
life,” said the elderly gentleman, scanning the outward ap-
pearance of our two midshipmen.
“We are,”replied Gascoigne, “ofﬁcers in theEnglish navy,
and gentlemen; we were wrecked in our boat last night, and
have wandered here in the dark, seeking for assistance, and
food, and some conveyance to Palermo, where we shall ﬁnd
friends, and the means of appearing like gentlemen.”
“Was your ship wrecked, gentlemen?” inquired the Sici-
lien, “and many lives lost?”
“No, our ship is at Malta; we were in a boat on a party

of pleasure, were caught by a gale, and driven on the coast.
To satisfy you of the truth. observe that our pistols have the
king’s mark, and that we are not paupers we show you gold."
Gascoigne pulled out his doubloons—and Jack did the
same, coolly observing, —
“I thought we were only to show silver, Ned!”
“It needed not that,” replied the gentleman; “your con-
duct in this affair, your manners and address, fully convince
me that you are what you represent, but were you common
peasants, I am equally indebted to you for my life, and you
may command me. Tell me in what way I can be of ser-
v1ce.”
“In giving us something to eat, for we have had nothing
for many, many hours. After that, we may, perhaps, trespass
a little more upon your kind ofﬁces.”
“You must, of course, be surprised at what has passed,
and curious to know the occasion,” said the gentleman; “ you
have a right to be informed of it, and shall be, as soon as you
are more comfortable; in the meantime, allow me to intro-
duce myself as Don Rebiera de Silva.”
“I wish,” said Jack, who, from his knowledge of Spanish,
could understand the whole of the last part of the Don’s speech.
“that he would introduce us to his breakfast.”
“ So do I,” said Gascoigne; “but we must wait a little — he
ordered the ladies to prepare something instantly.”
“Your friend does not speak Italian,” said Don Rebiera.
"_ No, Don Rebiera, he speaks French and Spanish.”
“If he speaks Spanish, my daughter can converse with
him; she has but shortly arrived from Spain. We are closely
united with a noble house in that country.”
Don Rebiera then led the way to another room, and in a
short time there was a repast brought in, to which our mid-
shipmen did great justice.
“I will now,” said the Don, “relate to you, sir, for the in-
formation of yourself and friend, the causes which produced
this scene of violence, which you so opportunely defeated.
But ﬁrst, as it must be very tedious to your friend, I will

send for Donna Clara and my daughter Agnes to talk to him;
my wife understands a little Spanish, and my daughter, as I
said before, has but just left the country, where, from circum-
stances, she remained some years.”
As soon as Donna Clara, and Donna Agnes made their
appearance and were introduced, Jack, who had not before
paid attention to them, said to himself, “I have seen a face
like that girl’s before.” If so, he had never seen many like
it, for it was the quintessence of brunette beauty, and her
ﬁgure was equally perfect; although, not having yet com-
pleted her ﬁfteenth year, it required still a little more develop-
ment.
Donna Clara was extremely gracious, and as, perhaps,
she was aware that her voice would drown that of her hus-
band, she proposcd to our hero to walk in the garden, and
in a few minutes they took their seats in a pavilion at the end
of it. The old lady did not talk much Spanish, but when at
a loss for a word, she put in an Italian one, and Jack under-
stood her perfectly well. She told him her sister had married
a Spanish nobleman many years since, and that before the
war broke out between the Spanish and the English they had
gone over with all their children to see her; that when they
wished to return, her daughterAgnes, then a child, was suffer-
ing under a lingering complaint, and it was thought advisable,
as she was very weak, to leave her under the charge of her
aunt, who had a little girl of nearly the same age; that they
were educated together at a convent, near Tarragona, and
that she had only returned two months ago; that she had a
very narrow escape, as the ship in which her uncle, and aunt,
and cousins, as well as herself, were on board, returning from
Genoa, where her brother-in-law had been obliged to go to
secure a succession to some property bequeathed to him, had
been captured in the night by the English; but the ofﬁcer,
who was very polite, had allowed them to go away next
day, and very handsomely permitted them to take all their
effects.
“Oh, oh,” thought Jack; “I thought I had seen her face

before; this then was one of the girls in the corner of the
cabin — now I’ll have some fun.”
During the conversation with the mother, Donna Agnes
had remained some paces behind, picking now and then a
ﬂower, and not attending to what passed.
When our hero and her mother sat down in the pavilion
she joined them, when Jack addressed her with his usual
politeness.
“I am almost ashamed to be sitting by you, Donna Agnes,
in this ragged dress —but the rocks of your coast have no
respect for persons.”
“We are under great obligations, signor, and do not re-
gard such triﬂcs.”
“You are all kindness, signora,” replied Jack; “I little
thought this morning of my good fortune, — I can tell the
fortunes of others, but not my own.”
“You can tell fortunes!” replied the old lady.
“Yes, madam, I am famous for it—shall I tell your
daughter hers?”
Donna Agnes looked at our hero, and smiled.
“I perceive that the young lady does not believe me; I
must prove my art, by telling her of what has already
_ happened to her. The signora will then give me credit.”
“Certainly, if you do that,” replied Agnes.
“Oblige me, by showing me the palm of your hand.”
Agnes extended her little hand, and Jack felt so very
polite, that he was nearly kissing it. However, he restrained
himself, and examining the lines —-
“That you were educated in Spain—that you arrived
here but two months ago — that you were captured and
released by the English, your mother has already told me;
but to prove to you that I knew all that, I must now be more
particular. You were in a ship mounting fourteen guns—
was it not so?”
Donna Agnes nodded her head.
“I never told_ the signor that,” cried Donna Clara.
“She was taken by surprise in the night, and there was

no ﬁghtingl The next morning the English burst open the
cabin door; your uncle and your cousin ﬁred their pistols.”
“Holy Virgin!” cried Agnes, with surprise.
“The English ofﬁcer was a young man, not very good-
looking.”
“There you are wrong, signor — he was very hand-
some.”
“There is no accounting for taste, signora. You were
frightened out of your wits, and with your cousin you
crouched down in the corner of the cabin. Let me examine
that little line closer. You had — yes, it’s no mistake — you
had. very little clothes on.”
Agnes tore away her hand and covered her face.
“E vero, é vero; Holy Jesus! how could you know that?”
Of a sudden Agnes looked at our hero, and after a minute
appeared to recognise him.
“Oh, mother, ’tis he — I recollect now, ’tis he!”
“Who, my child?” replied Donna Clara, who had been
struck dumb with Jack’s astonishing power of fortune-telling.
“The ofﬁcer who captured us, and was so kind.”
Jack burst out into a laughter not to be controlled for
some minutes, and then acknowledged that she had dis-
covered him.
“At all events, Donna Agnes,” said he at last, “acknow-
ledge that, ragged as I am, I have seen you in a much greater
dishabille.”
Agnes sprang up and took to her heels, that she might
hide her confusion, and at the same time go to her father and
tell him who he had as his guest.
Although Don Rebiera had not yet ﬁnished his narrative,
this announcement of Agnes, who ran in breathless to com-
municate it, immediately brought all the parties together,
and Jack received their thanks.
“I little thought,” said the Don, “that I should have been
so doubly indebted to you, sir. Command my services as you
please, both of you. My sons are at Palermo, and I trust you

will allow them the pleasure of your friendship when you are
tired of remaining with us.”
Jack made his politest bow, and then with a shrug of his
shoulders looked down upon his habiliments, which, to please
Gascoigne, he had torn into ribands, as much as to say, “We
are not provided for a lengthened stay.”
“My brothers‘ clothes will ﬁt them, 1 think,” said Agnes
to her father; “they have left plenty in their wardrobes.”
“If the signors will condescend to wear them till they can
replace their own.”
Midshipmen are very condescending. They followed
Don Rebiera, and condescended to put on clean shirts belong-
ing to Don Philip and Don Martin. Also to put on their
trousers, to select their best waistcoats and coats; in short,
they condescended to have a regular ﬁt-out — and it so hap-
pened that the ﬁt-out was not far from a regular ﬁt.
Having condescended, they then descended, and the in-
timacy between all parties became so great that it appeared
as if they not only wer the young men’s clothes but also
stood in their shoes. Having thus made themselves present-
able, Jack presented his hand to both ladies and led them
into the garden, that Don Rebiera might ﬁnish his long story
to Gascoigne without further interruption, and resuming
their seats in the pavilion, be entertained the ladies with a
history of his cruise in the ship after her capture. Agnes
soon recovered from her reserve, and Jack had the forbear-
ance not to allude again to the scene in the cabin, which was
the only thing she dreaded. After dinner, when the family,
according to custom, had retired for the siesta, Gascoigne
andJack, who had slept enough in the cart to last for a week,
went out together in the garden.
“Well, Ned,” said Jack, “do you wish yourself on board
the Harpy again?”
“No,” replied Gascoigne, “we have fallen on our feet at
last, but still not without ﬁrst being knocked about like peas
in a rattle. What a lovely little creature that Agnes is!

How strange that you should fall in with her again! How
odd that we should come here!”
“My good fellow, we did not come here. Destiny brought
us in a cart. She may take us to Tyburn in the same way.”
“Yes, if you sport your philosophy as you did when we
awoke this morning.”
“Nevertheless, I’ll be hanged if I’m not right. Suppose
we argue the point?”
“Right or wrong, you will be hanged, Jack; so instead of
arguing the point, suppose I tell you what the Don made
such a long story abou .”
“With all my heart — let us go to the pavilion.”
Our hero and his friend took their seats, and Gascoigne
then communicated the history of Don Rebiera, to which we
shall dedicate the ensuing chapter.
CHAPTER XX.
A long Story, which the Reader must listen to, as well as our Hero.
“I save already made you acquainted with my name, and
I have only to add that it is one of the most noble in Sicily,
and that there are few families who possess such large estates.
My father was a man who had no pleasure in the pursuits of
most of the young men of his age; he was of a weakly con-
stitution, and was with difﬁculty reared to manhood. When
his studies were completed he retired to his country seat
belonging to our family, which is about twenty miles from
Palermo, and shutting himself up, devoted himself wholly to
literary pursuits.
“As he was an only son, his parents were naturally very
anxious that he should marry; the more so as his health did
not promise him a very extended existence. Had he con-
sulted his own inclinations he would have declined, but he
felt that it was his duty to comply with their wishes; but he
did not trouble himself with the choice, leaving it wholly to
them. They selected a young lady of high family and cer-

tainly of most exquisite beauty. I only wish I could say
more in her favour — for she was my mother — but it is im-
possible to narrate the history without exposing her conduct.
The marriage took place, and my father — having woke up,
as it were, at the celebration — again returned to his closet,
to occupy himself in abstruse studies—the results of which
have been published, and have fully established his reputa-
tion as a man of superior talent and deep research. But,
however much the public may appreciate the works of a man
of genius, whether they be written to instruct or to amuse,
certain it is that a literary man requires in his wife either a
mind congenial to his own, or that pride in her husband’s
talents which induces her to sacriﬁce much of her own
domestic enjoyment to the satisfaction of having his name
extolled abroad. I mention this point as some extenuation
of my mother’s conduct. She was neglected most certainly,
but not neglected for frivolous amusements, or because an-
other form had captivated his fancy; but in his desire to in-
struct others, and I may add his ambition for renown, he
applied himself to his literary pursuits, became abstracted,
answered without hearing, and left his wife to amuse herself
in any way she might please. A literary husband is, with-
out exception—although always at home—the least domestic
husband in the world, and must try the best of tempers —
not by unkindness, for my father was kind and indulgent to
excess, but by that state of perfect abstraction and indiffer-
ence which he showed to everything except the favourite
pursuit which absorbed him. My mother had but to speak,
and every wish was granted — a refusal was unknown. You
may say, what could she want more? I reply, that anything
to a woman is preferable to indiﬂerenoe. The immediate
consent to every wish took away, in her opinion, all merit in
the grant — the value of everything is only relative, and in
proportion to the difﬁculty of obtaining it. The immedrate
assent to every opinion was tantamount to insult—it implied
that he did not choose to argue with her.
“It is true , that women like to have their own way — but

they like at the same time to have difﬁculties to surmount
and to conquer; otherwise half the gratiﬁcation is lost. Al-
though tempests are to be deplored, still a certain degree of
oscillation and motion are requisite to keep fresh and clear
the lake of matrimony, the waters of which otherwise soon
stagnate and become foul, and without some contrary cur-
rents of opinion between a married couple such a stagnation
must take place.
“A woman permitted always and invariably to have her
own way without control is much in the same situation as the
child who insists upon a whole instead of half a holiday, and
before the evening closes is tired of himself and everything
about him. In short, a little contradiction, like salt at dinner,
seasons and appetises the repast; but too much, like the con-
diment in question, spoils the whole, and it becomes unpalat-
able in proportion to its excess.
“My mother was a vain woman in every sense of the word
— vain of her birth and of her beauty, and accustomed to re-
ceive that homage to which she considered herself entitled.
She had been spoiled in her infancy, and as she grew up had
learnt nothing, because she was permitted to do as she
pleased; she was therefore frivolous , and could not appreciate
what she could not comprehend. There never was a more
ill-assorted union.”
“I have always thought that such must be the case,” re-
plied Gascoigne, “in Catholic countries, where a young per-
son is taken out of a convent and mated according to what
her family or her wealth may consider as the most eligible
connection.”
“On that subject there are many opinions, my friend,”
replied Don Rebiera. “It is true, that when a marriage of
convenience is arranged by the parents, the dispositions of
the parties are made a secondary point; but then, again, it
must be remembered, that when a choice is left to the parties
themselves, it is at an age at which there is little worldly
consideration: and, led away, in the ﬁrst place, by their pas-
sions, they form connections with those inferior in their sta-

tion which are attended with eventual unhappiness; or, in the
other, allowing that they do choose in their own rank of life,
they make quite as bad or often a worse choice than if their
partners were selected for them.”
“I cannot understand that,” replied Gascoigne.
“The reason is, because there are no means, or, if means,
no wish, to study each other’s disposition. A young man is
attracted by person, and he admires; the young woman is
ﬂattered by the admiration, and is agreeable; if she has any
faults she is not likely to display them—not concealing them
from hypocrisy, but because they are not called out. The
young man falls in love, so does the young woman: and when
once in love, they can no longer see faults; they marry,
imagining that they have found perfection. In the blindness
of love each raises the other to a standard of perfection which
human nature can never attain, and each becomes equally
annoyed on ﬁnding, by degrees, that they were in error. The
re-action takes place, and they then under-rate, as much as
before they had over-rated, each other. Now, if two young
people marry without this violence of passion, they do not
expect to ﬁnd each other perfect, and perhaps have a better
chance 01 happiness.”
“I don’t agree with you,” thought Gascoigne; “but as you
appear to be as fond of argument as my friend Jack, 1 shall
make no reply, lest there be no end to the story.”
Don Rebiera proceeded.
“My mother, ﬁnding that my father preferred his closet
and his books to gaicty and dissipation, soon left him to him-
self , and amused herself after her own fashion, but not until
I was born, which was ten months after their marriage. My
father was conﬁding, and, pleased that my mother should be
amused, he indulged her in everything. Time ﬂew on, and
I had arrived at my ﬁfteenth year, and came home from my
studies, it being intended that I should enter the army, which
you are aware is generally the only profession embraced in
this country by the heirs of noble families. Of course, I knew
little of what had passed at home, but still I had occasionally

heard my mother spoken lightly of, when I was not supposed
to be present, and I always heard my father’s name men-
tioned with compassion, as if an ill-used man, but I knew
nothing more: still this was quite sufﬁcient for a young man,
whose blood boiled at the idea of anything like a stigma
being cast upon his family. I arrived at my father’s — I
found him at his books; I paid my respects to my mother, —-
1 found her with her confessor. I disliked the man at ﬁrst
sight; he was handsome, certainly: his forehead was high
and white, his eyes large and ﬁery, and his ﬁgure command-
ing; but there was a dangerous, proud look about him which
disgusted me, — nothing like humility or devotion. I might
have admired him as an ofﬁcer commanding a regiment of
cavalry, but as a churchman he appeared to be most mis-
placed. She named me with kindness, but he appeared to
treat me with disdain; he spoke authoritatively to my mother,
who appeared to yield implicitly, and I discovered that he
was lord of the whole household. My mother, too, it was said,
had given up gaieties and become devout. I soon perceived
more than a common intelligence between them, and before
I had been two months at home I had certain proofs of my
father’s dishonour; and, what was still more unfortunate for
me, they were aware that such was the case. My ﬁrst im-
pulse was to acquaint my father; but, on consideration, I
thought it better to say nothing, provided I could persuade
my mother to dismiss Father Ignatio. I took an opportunity
when she was alone to express my indignation at her conduct,
and to demand his immediate dismissal, as a condition or my
not divulging her crime. She appeared frightened, and gave
her consent; but I soon found that her confessor had more
power with her than I had, and he remained. I now resolved
to acquaint my father, and I roused him from his studies that
he might listen to his shame. I imagined that he would have
acted calmly and discreetly; but, on the contrary, his violence
was without bounds, and I had the greatest difﬁculty from
preventing his rushing with his sword tosacriﬁee them both.
At last he contented himself by turning Father Ignatio out of

‘the house in the most ignominious manner, and desiring my
mother to prepare for seclusion in a convent for the remainder
of her days.—But he fell their victim; three days afterwards,
as my mother was, by his directions, about to be removed,
he was seized with convulsions and died. I need hardly say
that he was carried oif by poison; this, however, could not be
established till long afterwards. Before he died he seemed
to be almost supernaturally prepared for an event which
never came into my thoughts. He sent for another confessor,
who drew up his confession in writing at his own request, and
afterwards inserted it in his will. My mother remained in
the house, and Father lgnatio had the insolence to return. I
ordered him away, and he resisted. He was turned out by
the servants. I had an interview with my mother, who deﬁed
me, and told me that I should soon have a brother to share in
the succession. I felt that, if so, it would be the illegitimate
progeny of her adultery, and told her my opinion. She ex-
pressed her rage in the bitterest curses, andl left her. Shortly
afterwards she quitted the house and retired to another of
our country seats, where she lived with Father Ignatio as be-
fore. About four months afterwards, formal notice was sent
to me of the birth of a brother; but as, when my father’s will
was opened, he there had inserted his confession, or the sub-
stance of it, in which he stated, that aware of my mother’s
guilt, and supposing that consequences might ensue, he
solemnly declared before God that he had for years lived
apart, I cared little for this communication. I contented my-
self with replying that as the child belonged to the church, it
had better be dedicated to its service.
“I had, however, soon reason toacknowledge the venge-
ance of my mother and her paramour. One night 1 was
attacked by bravos; and had Inot fortunately received assist-
ance, I should have forfeited my life; as it was, I received a
severe wound.
“Against attempts of that kind I took every precaution in
future, but still every attempt was made to ruin my character,
as well as to take my life. A young sister disappeared from

a convent in my neighbourhood, and on the ground near the
window from which she descended was found a hat, recognised
to be mine. I was proceeded against, and notwithstanding
the strongest interest, it was with difﬁculty that the affair
was arranged, although I had incontestably proved an alibi.
“A young man of rank was found murdered, with a stiletto,
known to be mine, buried in his bosom, and it was with difﬁ-
culty that I could establish my innocence.
“Part of a banditti had been seized, and on being asked
the name of their chief, when they received absolution, they
confessed that I was the chief of the band.
“Everything that could be attempted was put into prac-
tice; and if I did not lose my life , at all events I was avoided
by almost everybody as a dangerous and doubtful character.
“At last a nobleman of rank, the father of Don Scipio,
whom you disarmcd, was assassinated; the bravos were taken,
and they acknowledged that I was the person who hired
them. I defended myself, but the king imposed upon me a
heavy ﬁne and banishment. I had just received the order,
and was crying out against the injustice, and lamenting my
hard fate, as I sat down to dinner. Latterly, aware of what
my enemies would attempt, I had been accustomed to live
much alone. My faithful valet Pedro was my only attendant.
I was eating my dinner with little appetite, and had asked
for some wine. Pedro went to the buffet behind him, to give
me what I required. Accidentally I lifted up my head, and
there being a large pier-glass opposite to me,I saw the ﬁgure
of my valet, and that he was pouring a powder in the ﬁagon
of wine which he was about to present to me. I recollected
the hat being found at the nunnery, and also the stiletto in
the body of the young man.
“Like lightning it occurred to me, that I had been foster-
ing the viper who had assisted to destroy me. He brought
me {the ﬂagon. I rose, locked the door, and drawing my
sword, I addressed him, —
“ ‘Villain! I know thee; down on your knees, for your life
is forfeited.‘

“ ‘Now, then ,‘ continued I, ‘you have but one chance —
either drink off this ﬂagon of wine, orlpass my sword through
your body. — He hesitated, and I put the point to his breast,
—-- even pierced the ﬂesh a quarter of an inch.
“ ‘Drink,’ cried I —- ‘is it so very unjust an order to tell
you to drink old wine? Drink,’ continued I, ‘or my sword
does its duty.’
“He drank, and would then have quitted the room. ‘No,
no,‘ said I, ‘you remain here, and the wine must have its
effect. If I have wronged you I will make amends to you —
but I am suspicious.’
“In about a quarter of an hour, during which timelpaeed
up and down the room, with my sword drawn, my servant
fell down, and cried in mercy to let him have a priest. I sent
for my own confessor, and he then acknowledged that he was
an agent of my mother and Father Ignatio, and had been the
means of making it appear that I was the committer of all
the crimes and murders which had been perpetrated by them,
with a view to my destruction. A strong emetic having been
administered to him, he partially revived, and was taken to
Palermo, where he gave his evidence before he expired.
“ When this was made known, the king revoked his sen-
tence, apologized to me, and I found that once more I was
visited and courted by everybody. My mother was ordered
to be shut up in a convent, where she died, I trust, in grace;
and Father Ignatio ﬂed to Italy, and I have been informed is
since dead.
“Having thus rid myself of my principal enemies, I con-
sidered myself safe. I married the lady whom you have just
seen, and before my eldest son was born, Don Silvio, for such
was the name given to my asserted legitimate brother, came
of age, and demanded his succession. Had he asked me for
a proper support, as my uterine brother, I should not have
refused; but that the son of Friar Ignatio, who had so often
attempted my life, should, in case of my decease, succeed to
the title and estates, was not to be‘ borne. A lawsuit was

immediately commenced, which lasted four or ﬁve years,
during which Don Silvio married, and had a son, that young
man whom you heard me address by the same name; but
after much litigation, it was decided that my father’s con-
fessor and will had proved his illegitimacy, and the suit was
in my favour. From that time to this, there has been a con-
stant enmity. Don Silvio refused all my offers of assistance,
and followed me with a pertinacity which often endangered
my life. At last he fell by the hands of his own agents,
who mistook him for me. Don Silvio died without leaving
any provision for his family; his widow I pensioned, and his
son I have had carefully brought up, and have indeed treated
most liberally, but he appears to have imbibed the spirit of
his father, and no kindness has been able to embue him with
gratitude.
“He had lately been placed by me in the army, where he
found out my two sons, and quarrelled with them both upon
slight pretence; but, in both instances, he was wounded and
carried off the ﬁeld.
“My two sons have been staying with me these last two
months, and did not leave till yesterday. This morning Don
Silvio, accompanied by Don Scipio, came to the house, and
after accusing me of being the murderer of both their parents,
drew their rapiers to assassinate me. My wife and child,
hearing the noise, came down to my assistance — you know
the rest.”

Oun limits will not permit us to relate all that passed du- -
ring our hero’s stay of a fortnight at Don Rebiera’s. He and
Gascoignc were treated as if they were his own sons, and the
kindness of the female part of the family was equally re-
markable. Agnes, naturally perhaps, showed a preference
or partiality for Jack: to which Gascoigne willingly sub-

mitted, as he felt that our hero had a prior and stronger
claim, and during the time that they remained a feeling‘ of
attachment was created between Agnes and the philosopher,
which, if not love, was at least something very near akin to
it; but the fact was, that they were both much too young to
think of marriage; and, although they walked and talked,
and laughed, and played together, they were always at home
in time for their dinner. Still, the young lady thought she
preferred our hero, even to her brothers, and Jack thought
that the young lady was the prettiest and kindest girl that he
had ever met with. At the end of the fortnight, our two
midshipmen took their leave, furnished with letters of re-
commendation to many of the ﬁrst nobility in Palermo, and
mounted on two ﬁne mules with bell bridles. The old Donna
kissed them both — the Don showered down his blessings of
good wishes, and Donna Agnes‘ lips trembled as she bade
them adieu; and, as soon as they were gone, she went up to
her chamber and wept. Jack also was very grave, and his
eyes moistened at the thoughts of leaving Agnes. Neither of
them were aware, until the hour of parting, how much they
had wound themselves together.
The ﬁrst quarter of an hour our two midshipmen followed
their guide in silence. Jack wished to be left to his own
thoughts, and Gascoigne perceived it.
“Well, Easy,” said Gascoigne , at last, “if I had been in
your place, constantly in company of, and loved by, that
charming girl, I could never have torn myself away.”
“Loved by her, Ned!” replied Jack, “what makes you
say that?” '
“Because I am sure it was the case; she lived but in your
presence. Why, if you were out of the room, she never
spoke a word, but sat there as melancholy as a sick monkey
— the moment you came in again, she beamed out as glori-
ous as the sun, and was all life and spirit.”
“I thought people were always melancholy when they
were in love,” replied Jack.
“When those that they love are out of their presence.”


## p. 204 (#212) ############################################

204 MR. mnsmrmau ansv.
“Well, then, I am out of her presence, and I feel very
melancholy, so I suppose, by your argument, I am in love.
Can a man be in love without knowing it?”
“I really cannot say, Jack; I never was in love myself,
but I’ve seen many others spooney. My time will come, I
suppose, by-and-bye. They say, that for every man made,
there is a woman also made to ﬁt him, if he could only ﬁnd
her. Now, it’s my opinion that you have found yours — I‘ll
lay my life she’s crying at this moment."
“Do you really think so, Ned? let’s go back — poor little
Agnes — let’s go back; I feel I do love her, and I’ll tell
her so.”
“Pooh, nonsense! it’s too late now; you should have told
her that before, when you walked with her in the garden.”
“But I did not know it, Ned. However, as you say, it
would be foolish to turn back, so I’ll write to her from
Palermo.”
Here an argument ensued upon love, which we shall not
trouble the reader with, as it was not very profound, both
sides knowing very little on the subject. It did, however,
end with our hero being convinced that he was desperately
in love, and he talked about giving up the service as soon as
he arrived at Malta. It is astonishing what sacriﬁces mid-
shipmen will make for the objects of their adoration.
It was not until late in the evening that our adventurers
arrived at Palermo. As soon as they were lodged at the
hotel, Gascoigne sat down and wrote a letter‘ in their joint
names to Don Rebiera, returning him many thanks for his
great kindness, informing him of their safe arrival, and trust-
ing that they should soon meet again: and Jack took up his
pen, and indited a letter in Spanish to Agnes, in which he
swore that neither -tide nor time, nor water, nor air, nor
heaven, nor earth, nor the ﬁrst-lieutenant, nor his father, nor
absence, nor death itself, should prevent him from coming
back and marrying her, the ﬁrst convenient opportunity,
begging her to refuse a thousand offers, as come back he
would, although there was no saying when. It was a perfect

mu. mmsmrmm nssv. 205
love-letter, that is to say, it was the essence of nonsense; but
that made it perfect, for the greater the love the greater the
folly.
These letters were consigned to the man who was sent as
their guide, and also had to return with the mules. He was
liberally rewarded; and, as Jack told him to be very careful
of his letter, the Italian naturally concluded that it was to be
delivered clandestinely, and he delivered it accordingly, at a
time when Agnes was walking in the garden thinking of our
hero. Nothing was more opportune than the arrival of the
letter; Agnes ran to the pavilion, read it over twenty times,
kissed it twenty times, and hid it in her bosom; sat for a few
minutes in deep and placid thought, took the letter out of its
receptacle, and read it over and over again. It was very
bad Spanish and very absurd, but she thought it delightful,
poetical, classical, sentimental, argumentative, convincing,
incontrovertible, imaginative and even grammatical; for if it
was not good Spanish, there was no Spanish half so good.
Alas! Agnes was indeed unsophisticated, to be in such
ecstasies with a midshipman’s love-letter. Once more she
hastened to her room to weep, but it was from excess of joy
and delight. The reader may think Agnes silly, but he must
take into consideration the climate, and that she was not yet
ﬁfteen.
Our young gentlemen sent for a tailor, and each ordered
a new suit of clothes; they delivered their letters of recom-
mendation, and went to the banker to whom they were ad-
dressed by Don Rebiera.
“I shall draw for ten pounds, Jae ,” said Gascoigne, “on
the strength of the shipwreck; I shall tell the truth, all ex-
cept that we forgot to ask for leave, which I shall leave out;
and 1 am sure the story will be worth ten pounds. What
shall you draw for, Jack?”
“I shall draw for two hundred pounds,” replied Jack; “I
mean to have a good cruise while I can.”
“But will your governor stand that, Easy?”
“To be sure he will.”

“Then you’re right — he is a philosopher — I wish he’d
teach mine, for he hates the sight of a bill.”
“Then don't you draw, Ned — I have plenty for both. If
every man had his equal share and rights in the world, you
would be as able to draw as much as 1; and as you cannot,
upon the principles of equality you shall have half.”
“I really shall become a convert to your philosophy,
Jack; it does not appear to be so nonsensical as I thought it
At all events, it has saved my old governor ten pounds, which
he can ill afford, as a colonel on half-pay.”
On their return to the inn, they found l)on Philip and
Don Martin, to whom Don Rebiera had written, who wel-
comed them with open arms. They were two very ﬁne
young men of eighteen and nineteen, who were ﬁnishing
their education in the army. Jack asked them to dinner, and
they and our hero soon became inseparable. ‘I‘hcy took him
to all the theatres, the conversaziones of all the nobility, and
as Jack lost his money with good humour, and was a very
handsome fellow, he was everywhere well received and was
made much of: many ladies made love to him, but Jack was
only very polite, because he thought more and more of Agnes
every day. Three weeks passed away like lightning, and
neither Jack nor Gascoigne thought of going back. At last,
one ﬁne day H. M. frigate Aurora anchored in the bay, and
Jack and Gascoigne, who were at a party at the Duke of
Pentaro’s, met with the captain of the Aurora, who was also
invited. The duchess introduced them to Captain Tartar,
who imagining them, from their being in plain clothes, to be
young Englishmen of fortune , on their travels, was very
gracious and condescending. Jack was so pleased with his
urbanity that he requested the pleasure of his company to
dinner the next day: Captain Tartar accepted the invitation,
and they parted shaking hands, with many expressions of
pleasure in having made his acquaintance. Jack’s party was
rather large, and the dinner sumptuous. The Sicilian gentle-
men did not drink much wine, but Captain Tartar liked his
bottle and although the rest of the company quittcd the table

to go to a ball given that evening by the Marquess. Novara,
Jack was too polite not to sit it out with the captain: Gas-
coigne closed his chair to Jack’s, who, he was afraid, being
a little aﬁeeted with the wine, would “let the cat out of the
bag.”
The captain was amazingly entertaining. Jack told him
how happy he should be to see him at Forest Hill, which
property the captain discovered to contain six thousand acres
of land, and also that Jack was an only son/, and Captain
Tartar was quite respectful when he found that he was in
such very excellent company. The captain of the frigate in-
quired of Jack what brought him out here, and J ack, whose
prudence was departing, told him that he came in His
Majesty’sship Harpy. Gascoigne gave Jack a nudge, but it
was of no use, for as the wine got into Jack’s brain, so did
his notions of equality.
“Oh! Wilson gave you a passage; he’s an old friend of
nnne.”
“So he is of our’s,” replied Jack; “he’s a devilish good
sort of a fellow, Wilson.”
“But where have you been since you came out?” inquired
Captain Tartar.
“In the Harpy,” replied Jack; “to be sure, I belong to
her.”
“You belong to her! in what capacity, may I ask?” in-
quired Captain Tartar in a much less respectful and con-
ﬁdential tone.
“Midshipman,” replied Jack; “so is Mr. Gascoigne.”
“Umph! you are on leave then?”
“No, indeed,” replied Jack; “I’ll tell you how it is, my
dear fellow.”
“Excuse me for one moment,” replied Captain Tartar,
rising up; “I must give some directions to my servant which
I forgot.”
Captain Tartar hailed his coxswain out of the window,
gave orders just outside of the door, and then returned to the
table. In the meantime, Gascoigne, who expected a breeze,

had been eautioning Jack in a low tone, at intervals, when
Captain Tartar’s back was turned: but it was useless; the
extra quantity of wine had got into Jack’s head, and he cared
nothing for Gascoigne’s remonstrance. VVhen the captain
resumed his seat at the table, Jack gave him the true narra-
tive of all that had passed, to which his guest paid the
greatest attention. Jack wound up his conﬁdence by saying,
that in a week or so he should go back to Don Rebiera and
propose for Donna Agnes.
“Ah!” exclaimed Captain Tartar, drawing his breath _
with astonishment, and compressing his lips.
“Tartar, the wine stands with you,” said Jack, “allow
me to help you.”
Captain Tartar threw himself back in his chair, and let all
the air out of his chest with a sort of whistle, as if he could
hardly contain himself.
“Have you had wine enough?” said Jack, very politely;
“if so, we will go to the Marquesa’s.”
The coxswain came to the door, touched his hat to the
captain, and looked signiﬁcantly.
“And so, sir,” cried Captain Tartar, in a voice of thunder,
rising from his chair, “you’re a d—d runaway midshipman,
who, if you belonged to my ship, instead of marrying Donna
Agnes, I would marry you to the gunner’s daughter, by
G—d; two midshipmen sporting plain clothes in the best so-
ciety in Palermo, and having the impudence to ask a post-
captain to dine with them! To ask me, and address me as
‘Tartar,’ and ‘my dear fellow!‘ you infernal young seamps! ”
continued Captain Tartar, now boiling with rage, and strik-
ing his ﬁst on the table so as to set all the glasses waltzing.
“Allow me to observe, sir,” saidJack, who was completely
sobcred by the address, “that we do not belong to your ship,
and that we are in plain clothes.”
“In plain clothes — midshipmen in mufti — yes, you are
so: a couple of young swindlers, without a sixpencc in your
pocket, passing yourselves off as young men of fortune, and
walking oif through the window without paying your bill.”

“Do you mean to call me a swindler, sir?" replied Jack.
“Yes, sir, you %”
“Then you lie!” exclaimed our hero, in a rage. “I am a
gentleman, sir — I am sorry I cannot pay you the same com-
pliment.”
The astonishment and rage of Captain Tartar took away
his breath. He tried to speak, but could not — he gasped,
and gasped, and then sat or almost fell down in his chair—
at last he recovered himself.
“Matthews ~ Matthews!”
“Sir,” replied the coxswain, who had remained at the
door. '
“The sergeant of marines.”
“Here he is, sir.”
The sergeant entered, and raised the back of his hand to
his hat.
“Bring your marines in — take charge of these two.
Directly you are on board, put them both legs in irons.”
The marines with their bayonets walked in and took pos-
session of our hero and Gaseoigne.
“Perhaps, sir,” replied Jack, who was now cool again, -
“you will permit us to pay our bill before we go on board.
We are no swindlers, and it is rather a heavy one — or, as
you have taken possession of our persons, you will, perhaps,
do us the favour to discharge it yourself;” and Jack threw
on the table a heavy purse of dollars. “I have only to ob-
serve, Captain Tartar, that I wish to be very liberal to the
waiters.”
“Sergeant, let them pay their bill,” said Captain Tartar,
in a more subdued tone, taking his hat and sword, and walk-
ing out of the room.
“By heavens, Easy, what have you done? —you will be
tried by a court-martial, and turned out of the service.”
“I hope so,” replied Jack; “I was a fool to come into it.
But he called me a swindler, and I would give the same an-
swer to~morrow,”
“If you are ready, gentlemen,’ said the sergeant, who

had been long enough with Captain Tartar to be aware that
to be punished by him was no proof of fault having been
committed.
“I will go and pack up our things, Easy, while you pay
the bill,” said Gascoigne. “Marine, you had better come
with me.”
In less than half an hour, our hero and his comrade, in-
stead of ﬁnding themselves at the Marquesa’s ball, found
themselves very comfortably in irons under the half-deck of
His Majesty’s frigate Aurora.
\Ve shall leave them, and return to Captain Tartar, who
had proceeded to the ball, to which he had been invited. On
his entering he was accosted by Don Martin and Don Philip,
who inquired what had become of our hero and his friend.
Captain Tartar, who was in no very good humour, replied
briskly, “that they were on board his ship in irons.”
“In irons! for what?” exclaimed Don Philip.
“Because, sir, they are a couple of young scamps who
have introduced themselves into the best company, passing
themselves off as people of consequence, when they are
only a couple of midshipmen we have run away from their
ship.” '
Now theRebieras knew very well that Jack and his friend
were midshipmen; but this did not appear to them any reason
why they should not be considered as gentlemen, and treated
accordingly.
“ Do you mean to say, signer,” said Don Philip, “that you
have accepted their hospitality, laughed, talked, walked arm-
in-arm with them, pledged them in wine, as we have seen you
this evening, and after they have conﬁded in you that you
have put them in irons?”
“Yes, sir, I do,” replied Captain Tartar.
“Then, by Heaven, you have my deﬁance. and you are no
gentleman!” replied Don Philip, the elder.
“And I repeat my brothere' words, sir, ” cried Don
Martin.
The two brothers felt so much attachment for our hero,

who had twice rendered such signal service to their family,
that their anger was without bounds.
In every other service but the English navy there is not
that power of grossly insulting and then sheltering yourself
under your rank; nor is it necessary for the discipline of any
service. To these young ofﬁeers, if the power did exist, the
use of such power under such circumstances appeared mon-
strous, and they were determined, at all events, to show to
Captain Tartar that in society, at least, it could be resented.
They collected their friends, told them what had passed, and
begged them to circulate it through the room. This was
soon done, and Captain Tartar found himself avoided. He
went up to the Marquesa and spoke to her, she turned her
head the other way. He addressed a count he had been con-
versing with the night before —he turned short round upon
his heel, while Don Philip and Don Martin walked up and
down talking, so that he might hear what they said, and
looking at him with eyes ﬂashing with indignation. Captain
Tartar left the ball-room and returned to the inn, more in‘
dignant than ever. When he rose the next morning he was
informed that a gentleman wished to speak with him; he sent
up his card as Don Ignatio Verez, colonel commanding the
fourth regiment oi infantry. On being admitted, he informed
Captain Tartar that Don Philip de Rebiera wished to have
the pleasure of crossing swords with him, and requested to
know when it would be convenient for Captain Tartar to meet
him.
It was not in Captain Tartar’s nature to refuse a challenge;
his courage was unquestionable, but he felt indignantthat a
midshipman should be the cause of his getting into such a
scrape. He accepted the challenge, but having no know-
ledge of the small-sword, refused to ﬁght unless with pistols.
To this the colonel raised no objections, and Captain Tartar
dispatched his coxswain with a note to his second-lieutenant,
for he was not on good terms with his ﬁrst. The meeting
took place—at the ﬁrst ﬁre the ball of Don Philip passed
through Captain Tartar’s brain, and he instantly fell dead.

The second-lieutenant hastened on board to report the fatal
result of the meeting, and shortly after, Don Philip and his
brother,with many of their friends, went off in the governor’s
barge to condole with our hero.
The ﬁrst-lieutenant, now captain ‘pro tempore,’ received
them graciously, and listened to their remonstrances relative
to our hero and Gascoigne.
“I have never been informed by the captain of the grounds
of complaint against the young gentlemen,” replied he, “and
have therefore no charge to prefer against them. I shall
therefore order them to be liberated. But as I learn that they
are ofﬁcers belonging to one of His Majesty’s ships lying at
Malta, I feel it my duty, as I sail immediately, to take them
there and send them on board of their own ship.”
Jack and Gascoigne were then taken out of irons and per-
mitted to see Don Philip, who informed them that he had re-
venged the insult, butJack and Gascoigne did not wish to go
on shore again after what had passed. After an hour’s con-
versation, and assurances of continued friendship, Don Philip,
his brother, and their friends, took leave of our two midship-
men, and rowed on shore.
And now we must be serious.
We do not write these novels merely to amuse, —we have
always had it in our view to instruct, and it must not be sup-
posed that we have no other end in view than to make the
reader laugh. If we were to write an elaborate work, telling
truths, and plain truths, conﬁning ourselves only to point out
errors and to demand reform, it would not be read; we have
therefore selected this light and triﬂing species of writing, as
it is by many denominated, as a channel through which we
may convey wholesome advice in a palatable shape. If we
would point out an error, we draw a character, and although
that character appears to weave naturally into the tale of
ﬁction, it becomes as much a beacon as it is a vehicle of
amusement, We consider this to be the true art of novel
writing, and that crime and folly and error can be as severely
lashed as virtue and morality can be upheld, by a series of

us. umsnrrmau user. 213
amusing causes and eifects, that entice the reader to take a
medicine, which, although rendered agreeable to the palate,
still produces the same internal beneﬁt as if it had been pre-
sented to him in its crude state, in which it would either be
refused or nauseated.
In our naval novels, we have often pointed out the errors
which have existed, and still do exist, in a service which is an
honour to its country; for what institution is there on earth
that is perfect, or into which, if it once was perfect, abuses
will not creep? Unfortunately, others have written to decry
the service, and many have raised up their voices against our
writings, because they felt that, in exposing error, we were
exposing them. But to this we have been indifferent; we felt
that we were doing good, and we have continued. ‘l‘0 prove
that we are correct in asserting that we have done good, we
will, out of several, state one single case.
In “ TheKing’s Own,” a captain, when requested to punish
a man instanter for a fault committed, replies that he never
has and never will punish a man until twenty-four hours after
the offence, that he may not be induced by the anger of the
moment to award a severer punishment than in his cooler
moments he might think commensurate —and that he wished
that the Admiralty would give out an order to that eﬁiect.
Some time after the publication of that work, the order
was given by the Admiralty, forbidding the punishment until
a certain time had elapsed after the offence; and we had
the pleasure of knowing from the ﬁrst lord of the Admiralty
of the time, that it was in consequence of the suggestion in
the novel.
If our writings had effected nothing else, we might still
lay down our pen with pride and satisfaction: but they have
done more, much more; and while they have amused the
reader, they have improved the service: they have held up
in their characters a mirror, in which those who have been in
error may see their own deformity, and many hints which
have been given have afterwards returned to the thoughts of
those who have had inﬂuence, have been considered as their

own ideas, and have been acted upon. The conduct of Cap-
tain Tartar may be considered as a libel on the service -- — is
it not? The fault of Captain Tartar was not in sending them
on board, or even putting them in irons as deserters, although,
under the circumstances, he might have shown more delicacy.
The fault was in stigmatisiug a young man as a swindler, and
the punishment awarded to -the error is intended to point
out the moral, that such an abuse of power should be severely
visited. The “greatest crrorﬂnow in our service is the dis-

was informed by his captaiiﬂ'were equally binding on ofﬁcers
and crew; but what a dead letter do they become if ofﬁcers
are permitted to break them with impunity! The captain of
a ship will turn the hands up to punishment, read the article
of war for the transgressing of which the punishment is in-
ﬂicted, and to show at that time their high respect for the
articles of war, the captain and every ofﬁcer take off their
hats. The moment the hands are piped down, the second
article of war, which forbids all swearing, &c., in derogation
of God’s honour, is immediately disregarded. We are not
strait-laced, — we care little about an oath as a mere explo-
tive; we refer now to swearing at others, to insulting their
feelings grossly by coarse and intemperate language. We
would never interfere with a man for d———g his own eyes,
but we deny the right of his d g those of another.
The rank of a master in the service is above that of a
midshipman, but still the midshipman is a gentleman by birth,
and the master, generally speaking, is not. Even at this
moment, in the service, if the master were to d——n the
eyes of a midshipman, and tell him that he was a liar, would
there be any redress, or if so, would it be commensurate to
the insult? If a midshipman were to request a court-martial,
would it be granted? — certainly not: and yet this is a point
of more importance than may be conceived. Our service has

rm. mmsmrmsn msr. 215
been wonderfully improved since the peace, and those who
are now permitted to enter it must be gentlemen. We know
that even now there are many who cry out against this as
dangerous, and injurious to the service; as if education spoilt
an ofﬁcer, and the scion of an illustrious house would not be
more careful to uphold an escutcheon without blemish for
centuries than one who has little more than brute courage;
but those who argue thus are the very people who are in-
jurious to the service, for they can have no other reason,
except that they wish that the juniors may be tyrannised over
with impunity.
Be it remembered that these are not the observations of a
junior ofﬁcer, smarting under insult — they are the result of
deep and calm reﬂection. We have arrived to that grade,
that, although we have the power to inﬂict, we are too high
to receive insult, but we have not forgotten how our young
blood has boiled when wanton, reckless, and cruel torture has
been heaped upon our feelings, merely because, as a junior
ofﬁcer, we were not in a position to retaliate, or even to reply.
And another evil is, that this great error is disseminated. In
observing on it, in one of our works, called “Peter Simple,”
we have put the following true observation in the mouth of
0’Brien. Peter observes, in his simple, right-minded way, —
“I should think, O’Brien, that the very circumstance of
having had your feelings so often wounded by such language
when you were a junior ofﬁcer would make you doubly care-
ful not to use it towards others, when you had advanced in
the service.” '
“Peter, that’s just the ﬁrst feeling, which wears away
after a time, till at last your own sense of indignation becomes
blunted, and becomes indifferent to it: you forget, also, that
you wound the feelings of others, and carry the habit with
you, to the great injury and disgrace of the service.”
Let it not be supposed that in making these remarks we
want to cause litigation, or insubordination. On the contrary,
we assert that this error is the cause, and eventually will be
much more the cause, of insubordination; for as the junior

ofﬁcers who enter the service are improved, so will they resist
it. The complaint here is more against the ofﬁcers than the
captains, whose power has been perhaps already too much
curtailed by late regulations: that power must remain, for
although there may be some few who are so perverted as to
make those whom they command uncomfortable, in justice
to the service we are proud to assert, that the majority
acknowledge, by their conduct, that the greatest charm
attached to power is to be able to make so many people
happy-
CHAPTER XXII.
Our Hero is sick with the Service, but recovers with Proper Medicine.
An Argument, ending, as most do, in a Blow Up. Mesty lectures
upon Grauiology.
THE day after the funeral, H. M. ship Aurora sailed for
Malta, and on her arrival the acting captain sent our two
midshipmen on board the Harpy without any remark, except
“victualled the day discharged,” as they had been horne on
the ship’s books as supernumeraries.
Mr. James, who was acting in the Aurora, was anxious to
join the admiral at Toulon, and intended to sail the next day.
He met Captain Wilson at the governor’s table, and stated
that Jack and Gascoigne had been put in irons by order of
Captain Tartar; his suspicious, and the report, that the duel
had in consequence taken place; but Gascoigne and Jack
had both agreed that they would not communicate the events
of their cruise to anybody on board of the Aurora; and there-
fore nothing else was known, except that they must have
made powerful friends somehow or another; and there ap-
peared in the conduct of Captain Tartar, as well as in the
whole transaction, somewhat of a mystery.
“I should like to know what happened to my friend Jack,
who fought the duel,” said the governor, who had laughed at
it till he held his sides; “ Wilson, do bring him here to-
morrow morning, and let us have his story.”

“I am afraid of encouraging him, Sir Thomas, he is much
too wild already. I told you of his ﬁrst cruise. He has
nothing but adventures, and they all end too favourably.”
“Well, but you can send for him here and blow him up‘
just as well as in your own cabin, and then we will have the
truth out of him.”
“That you certainly will,” replied Captain Wilson, “for
he tells it plainly enough.”
“Well, to oblige me, send for him. I don’t see he was
much to blame in abseonding, as it appears he thought he
would be hung. I want to see the lad.”
“Well, governor, if you wish it,” replied Captain Wilson,
who wrote a note to Mr. Sawbridge, requesting he would
send Mr. Easy to him at the governor’s house at ten o’clock
in the morning.
Jack made his appearance in his uniform — he did not
much care for what was said to him, as he was resolved to
leave the service. He had been put in irons, and the iron had
entered into his soul.
Mr. Sawbridge had gone on shore about an hour before
Jack had been sent on board, and he had remained on shore
all the night. He did not therefore see Jack but for a few
minutes, and thinking it his duty to say nothing to him at
ﬁrst, or to express his displeasure, he merely observed to him
that the captain would speak to him as soon as he came on
board. As Gascoigne and our hero did not know how far it
might be safe, even.at Malta, to acknowledge to what occurred
on board the speronare, which might get wind, they did not
even tell their messmates, resolving only to conﬁde it to the
captain.
When Jack was ushered into the presence of the captain,
he found him sitting with the governor, and the breakfast on
the table ready for them. Jack walked in with courage, but
respectfully. He was fond of Captain Wilson, and wished to
show him respect. Captain Wilson addressed him, pointed
out that he had committed a great error in ﬁghting a duel —
a greater error in demeaning himself by ﬁghting the purser’s

steward, and still greater in running away from his ship..
Jack looked respectfully to Captain Wilson, acknowledged
that he had done wrong, and promised to be more careful
another time, if Captain Wilson would look over it.
“Captain Wilson, allow me to plead for the young gen-
tleman,” said the governor; “I am convinced that it has only
been an error in judgment.”
“Well, Mr. Easy, as you express your contrition, and the
governor interferes in your behalf, I shall take no more notice
of this. But recollect, Mr. Easy, that you have occasioned
me a great deal of anxiety by your mad pranks, and I trust,
another time you will remember that I am too anxious for
your welfare not to be uncomfortable when you run such
risks. You may now go on board to your duty, and tell Mr.
Gascoigne to do the same; and pray let us hear of no more
duels or running away.”
Jack, whose heart softened at this kind treatment, did
not venture to speak; he made his bow and was about to quit
the room, when the governor said —
“Mr. Easy, you have not breakfasted? ”
“I have, sir,” replied Jack, “before I came on shore.”
“But a midshipman can always eat two breakfasts, parti-
cularly when his own comes ﬁrst; so sit down and breakfast
with us — it’s all over now.”
“Even if it was not,” replied Captain Wilson, laughing,
“I doubt whether it would spoil Mr. Easy’s breakfast. Come,
Mr. Easy, sit down.”
Jack bowed, and took his chair, and proved that his lec~
ture hd not taken away his appetite. When breakfast was
over Captain VVilson observed —
“Mr. Easy, you have generally a few adventures to speak
of when you return, will you tell the governor and me what
has taken place since you left us?”
“Certainly, sir,” replied Jack; “but I venture to request
that it may be under the promise of secrecy, for it’s rather
important to me and Gascoigne.”

rm. MIDSHIPMAN user. 219
“Yes, if secrecy is really necessary, my boy; but I’m the
best judge of that,” replied the governor.
Jack then entered into a detail of his adventures, which
we have already described, much to the astonishment of the
governor and his captain, and concluded his narration by
stating that he wanted to leave the service; he hoped that
Captain VVilson would discharge him and send him home.
“Pooh, nonsense!” said the governor, “you sha’n’t leave
the Mediterranean while I am here. No, no —you must have
more adventures, and come back and tell them to me. And
recollect, my lad, that whenever you come to Malta, there is
a bed at the governor’s house, and a seat at his table, always
ready for you.”
“ You are very kind , Sir Thomas ,” replied Jack,
“ but ——”
“No buts at all, sir — you sha’n’t leave the service!
Besides, recollect that I can ask for leave of absence for
you to go and see Donna Agnes. Ay, and send you there,
too.”
Captain Wilson also remonstrated with our hero, and he
gave up the point. It was harsh treatment which made him
form the resolution — it was kindness which overcame it.
“With your permission, Captain Wilson, Mr. Easy shall
dine with us to-day, and bring Gascoigne with him. You
shall ﬁrst scold him, and I’ll console him with a good dinner.
And, boy, donn' be afraid to tell your story everywhere. Sit
down and tell it at Nix Mangare stairs, if you please. I’m
governor here!”
Jack made his obeisance, and departed.
“The lad must be treated kindly, Captain Wilson,” said
the governor; “he would be a loss to the service. Good
heavens, what adventures, and how honestly he tells every-
thing! I shall ask him to stay with me for the time you are
here, if you will allow me: I want to make friends with him
— he must not leave the service.”
Captain Wilson, who felt that kindness and attention
would be more eifectual with our hero than any other meas~

ures, gave his consent to the govcrnor’s proposition. So Jack
ate at the governor’s table, and took lessons in Spanish and
Italian until the Harpy had been reﬁtted, after heaving down.
Before she was ready a vessel arrived from the ﬂeet, directing
Captain Wilson to repair to Mahon and send a transport,
lying there, to procure live bullocks for the ﬂeet. Jack did
not join his ship very willingly, but he had promised the
governor to remain in the service, and he went on board the
evening before she sailed. He had been living so well that
he had, at ﬁrst, a horror of midshipman’s fare, but a good
appetite seasons everything, and Jack soon complained that
there was not enough. He was delighted to see Jolliife and
Mesty after so long an absence; he laughed at the boat-
swain’s cheeks, inquired after the purser’s steward’s shot-
holes, shook hands with Gascoigne and his other messmates,
gave Vigors a thrashing, and then sat down to supper.
“Ah, Massa Easy, why you take a cruise without me?”
said Mesty; “dat very shabby. By de power, but I wish I
was there. You ab too much danger, Massy Easy, without
Mesty, any how.”
'l‘hc next day the Harpy sailed, and Jack went to his
duty. Mr. Asper borrowed ten pounds, and our hero kept as
much watch as he pleased, which, as watching did not please
him, was very little. Mr. Sawbridge had long conversations
with our hero, pointing out to him the necessity of discipline
and obedience in the service, and that there was no such
thing as equality, and that the rights of man secured to
every one the property which he held in possession.
“According to your ideas, Mr. Easy, :1. man has no more
right to his wife than anything else , and any other man may
claim her.”
Jack thought of Agnes, and he made matrimony an ex-
ception, as he continued to argue the point; but although he
argued, still his philosophy was almost upset at the idea of
any one disputing with him the rights of man, with respect
to Agnes.
The Harpy, made the African coast, the wind continued

contrary, and they were bafﬂed for many days; at last they
espied a brig under the land, about sixteen miles off; her rig
and appearance made Captain Wilson suspect that she was
a privateer of some description or another, but it was calm,
and they could not approach her. Nevertheless Captain
Wilson thought it his duty to examine her; so at ten o’clock
at night the boats were hoisted out: as this was merely in-
tended for a reconnoitre, for there was no saying what she
might be, Mr. Sawbridge did not go. Mr. Asper was in the
sick list, so Mr. Smallsole the master had the command of the
expedition. Jack asked Mr. Sawbridge to let him have
charge of one of the boats. Mr. Jolliffe and Mr. Vigors went
in the pinnace with the master. The gunner had the charge
of one cutter, and our hero had the command of the other.
Jack, although not much more than seventeen, was very
strong and tall for his age; indeed he was a man grown, and
shaved twice a-week. His only object in going was to have
a yarn for the governor when he returned to Malta. Mesty
went with him, and, as the boat shoved off, Gascoigne
slipped in, telling Jack that he was come to take care of him,
for which considerate kindness Jack expressed his warmest
thanks. The orders to the master were very explicit; he was
to reconnoitre the vessel, and if she proved heavily armed
not to attack, for she was embayed, and could not escape the
Harpy as soon as there was wind. If not armed he was to
board her, but he was to do nothing till the morning: the
reason for sending the boats away so soon was, that the men
might not suﬂ'er from the heat of the sun during the daytime,
which was excessive, and had already put many men on the
sick-list. The boats were to pull to the bottom of the bay,
not to go so near as to be discovered, and then drop their
grapnels till daylight. The orders were given to Mr. Small-
sole in presence of the other ofﬁcers who were appointed to
the boats, that there might be no mistake, and the boats then
shoved off. After a three hours’ pull, they arrived to where
the brig lay becalmed, and as they saw no lights moving on
board, they supposed they were not seen. They dropped

their grapnels in about seven fathoms water, and waited for
daylight. When Jack heard Captain Wils0n’s orders that
they were to lie at anchor till daylight, he had sent down
l\Iesty for ﬁshing-lines, as freh ﬁsh Iis always agreeable in a
midshipman’s berth: he and Gascoigne amused themselves
this way, and as they pulled up the ﬁsh they entered into an
argument, and Mr. Smallsole ordered them to be silent. The
point which they discussed was relative to boat service;
Gascoigne insisted that the boats should all board at once —-
while our hero took it into his head that it was better they
should come up one after another; a novel idea, but Jack’s
ideas on most points were singular.
“If you throw your whole force upon the decks at once,
you overpower them,” observed Gascoigne; “if you do not,
you are beaten in detail.”
“Very true,” replied Jack , “supposing that you have an
overpowering force, or they are not prepared; but recollect,
that if they are, the case is altered; for instance, as to ﬁre-
arms — they ﬁre theirs at the ﬁrst boat, and they have not
time to re-load, when the second comes up with its ﬁre re-
served; every fresh boat arriving adds to the courage of
those who have boarded, and to the alarm of_ those who de-
fend; the men come on fresh and fresh. Depend upon it,
. Gascoigne, there is nothing like a ‘corps de reserve.’”
“Will you keep silence in your boat, Mr. Easy, or will
you not?” cried the master; “ you’re a disgrace to the service,
sir.”
“Thank ye, sir,” replied Jack, in a low tone. “I’ve
another bite, Ned.”
Jack and his comrade continued to ﬁsh in silence till the
day broke. The mist rolled off the stagnant water, and dis-
covered the br1g, who, as soon as she perceived the boats,
threw out the French tricolor, and ﬁred a gun of de-
ﬁance.
Mr. Smallsole was undecided; the gun ﬁred was not a
heavy one, and so Mr. Jolliffe remarked; the men, as usual,
anxrous for the attack, asserted the same, and Mr. Smallsole,

afraid of retreating from the enemy and being afterwards
despised by the ship’s company, ordered the boats to weigh
their grapnels.
“Stop a moment, my lads,” said Jack to his men, “I’ve
got a bite.” The men laughed at Jack’s taking it so easy,
but he was their pet; and they did stop for him to pull up his
ﬁsh, intending to pull up to the other boats and recover their
loss of a few seconds.
“I’ve hooked him now,” said Jack; “ you may up with the
grapnel while I up with the ﬁsh.” But this delay gave the
other boats a start of a dozen strokes of their oars, which was
a distance not easy to be regained.
“They will be aboard before us, sir,” said the cox-
swain.
“Never mind that,” replied Jack; “some one must be
last.”
“But not the boat I am in,” replied Gascoigne; “if I
could help it.”
“I tell you,” replied Jack, “we shall be the ‘corps de
reserve,’ and have the honour of turning she scale in our
favour.”
“Give way, my lads,” cried Gascoigne, perceiving the
other boats still kept their distance ahead of them, which
was about a cable’s length. -
“ Gascoigne, I command the boat,” said Jack, “and I do
not wish my men to board without any breath in their bodies
— that’s a very unwise plan. A steady pull, my lads, and
not too much exertion.”
“By heavens, they’ll take the vessel before we get along-
side.”
“Even if they should, I am right, am I not, Mesty?”
“Yes, Massa Easy, you very right — suppose they take
vessel without you, they no want you — suppose they want
you, you come.” And the negro, who had thrown his jacket
oﬁ, bared his arm, as if he intended mischief.
‘[‘he ﬁrst cutter, commanded by the gunner, now gained
upon the launch, and was three boats’-lengths ahead of her

when she came alongside. The brig poured in her broad-
side — it was well directed, and down went the boat.
“Cutter’s sunk,” exclaimed Gascoigne; “by heavens!
give way, my men.”
“Now, don’t you observe, that had we all three been
pulling up together, the broadside would have sunk us all?”
said Jack, very composedly.
“There’s board in the launch — give way, my men, give
way,” said Gascoigne, stamping with impatience.
The reception was evidently warm; by the time that the
launch had poured in her men, the second cutter was close
under the brig’s quarter — two more strokes and she was
alongside; when of a sudden, a tremendous explosion took
place on the deck of the vessel, and bodies and fragments
were hurled up in the air. So tremendous was the explo-
sion, that the men of the second cutter, as if transﬁxed,
simultaneously stopped pulling, their eyes directed to the
volumes of smoke which poured through the ports, and hid
the whole of the masts and rigging of the vessel.
“Now’s your time, my lads, giveway, and alongside,”
cried our hero.
The men, reminded by his voice, obeyed—but the im-
petus already given to the boat was sufﬁcient. Before they
could drop their oars in the water they grazed against the
vessel’s sides, and, following Jack, were in a few seconds on
the quarter-deck of the vessel. A dreadful sight presented
itself — the whole deck was black, and corpses lay strewed;
their clothes on them still burning, and among the bodies lay
fragments of what once were men.
The capstern was unshipped and turned over on its side
- the binnacles were in remnants, and many of the ropes
ignited. There was not one person left on deck to oppose
them.
As they afterwards learned from some of the men who had
saved their lives by remaining below, the French captain had
seen the boats before they anchored, and had made every
preparation; he had ﬁlled a large ammunition chest with


## p. 225 (#233) ############################################

rm. MIDSHIPMAN EASY. 225
cartridges for the guns, that they might not have to hand
them up. The conﬂict between the men of the pinnace and
the crew of the vessel was carried on near the capstern, and
a pistol ﬁred had accidentally communicated with the powder,
which blew up in the very centre of the dense and desperate
struggle.
The ﬁrst object was to draw water and extinguish the
ﬂames, which were spreading over the vessel; as soon as that
was accomplished, our hero went aft to the taffrail, and
looked for the cutter which had been sunk. — “Gascoigne,
jump into the boat with four men — I see the cutter ﬂoats a
quarter of a mile astern: there may be some one alive yet. I
think now I see a head or two.”
Gascoigne hastened away, and soon returned with three
of the cutter’s men; the rest had sunk, probably killed or
wounded by the discharge of the broadside.
“Thank God, there’s three saved!” said Jack, “for we
have lost too many. We must now see if any of these poor
fellows are yet alive, and clear the decks of the remnants
of those who have been blown to pieces. I say, Ned,
where should we have been if we had boarded with the
pinnace?”
“ You always fall upon your feet, Easy,” replied
Gascoigne; “ but that does not prove that you are right.”
“I see there’s no convincing you, Ned, you are so con-
foundedly fond of argument. However, I’ve no time to argue
now — we must look to these poor fellows; some are still
alive.”
Body after body was thrown through the ports, the habili-
ments, in most cases, enabling them to distinguish whether it
was that of a departed friend or foe.
Jack turned round, and observed Mesty with his foot on a
head which had been blown from the trunk.
“What are you about, Mesty?”
“Massa Easy, I look at dis, and I tink it Massa Vigors’
head, and den I tink dis skull of his enemy nice present make
to little Massa Gossett; and den I tink again, and I say, no,

he dead and nebber thrash any more — so let him go over-
board.”
Jack turned away, forgiving Vigors in his heart; he
thought of the petty animosities of a midshipman’s berth, as
he looked at the blackened portion of a body half an hour
before possessing intellect. '
“Massa Easy,” said Mesty, “I tink you say right, any
how, when you say forgive: den, Massa Vigors,” continued
Mesty, taking up the head by the singed hair, and tossing it
out of the port; “you really very bad man —but Ashantce
forgive you.”
“Here’s somebody alive,” said Gascoigne to Jack, examin-
ing a body, the face of which was black as a cinder and not
to be recognised, “and he is one of our men, too, by his
dress.”
Our hero went up to examine, and to assist Gascoigne in
disengaging the body from a heap of ropes and half-burnt
tarpaulings with which it was entangled. Mesty followed,
and looking at the lower extremities, said, “Massa Easy, dat
Massa Jolliife; I know him trousers; marine tailor say he
patchum for ever, and so old dat de thread no hold; yester-
day he had dis patch put in, and marine tailor say he be d—n
if he patch any more, please nobody.”
Mesty was right; it was poor J olliffe, whose face was burnt
as black as a coal by the explosion. He had also lost three
ﬁngers of the left hand, but as soon as he was brought out on
the deck he appeared to recover, and pointed to his mouth
for water, which was instantly procured.
“ Mesty,” said Jack, “I leave you in charge of Mr. J olliffc;
take every care of him till I can come back.”
The investigation was then continued, and four English
sailors found who might be expected to recover, as well as
about the same number of Frenchmen; the remainder of the
bodies were then thrown overboard. The hat only of the
master was picked up between the guns, and there were but
eleven Frenchmen found below.
The vessel was the Franklin, a French privateer, of ten

guns and sixty-ﬁve men, of which, eight men were away in
prizes. The loss on the part of the vessel was forty-six
killed and wounded. On that of the Harpy, it was ﬁve
drowned in the cutter, and eighteen blown up belonging to
the pinnaee, out of which total of twenty-three, they had only
Mr. Jolliffe and ﬁve seamen alive.
“The Harpy is standing in with a breeze from the ofﬁng,”
said Gascoigne to Easy.
“ So much the better, for I am sick of this, Ned; there is
something so horrible in it, and I wish I was on board again.
I have just been to Jolliﬁ"e; he can speak a little; I think he
will recover. I hope so, poor fellow; he will then obtain his
promotion, for he is the commanding ofﬁcer of all us who are
let‘ .”
“And if he does,” replied Gascoigne, “he can swear that
it was by having been blown up which spoilt his beauty-—
but here comes the Harpy. I have been looking for an Eng-
lish ensign to hoist over the French, but cannot ﬁnd one; so
I hoist a wheft over it, —that will do.”
The Harpy was soon hove-to close to the brig, and Jack
went on board in the cutter to report what had taken place.
Captain Wilson was much vexed and grieved at the loss of
so many men: fresh hands were put in the cutter to man the
pinnace, and he and Sawbridge both went on board to wit-
ness the horrible effects of the explosion, as described by our
hero.
Jolliife and the wounded men were taken on board, and
all of them recovered. We have before stated how disﬁgured
the countenance of poor Mr. Jolliife had been by the small-
pox — so severely was it burned that the whole of the coun-
tenance came off in three weeks like a mask, and every one
declared that, seamed as it still was, Mr. Jolliife was better-
looking than he was before. It may be as well here to state,
that Mr. Jolliife not only obtained his promotion, but a pen-
sion for his wounds, and retired from the service. He was
still very plain, but as it was known that he had been blown
up, the loss of his eye as well as the scars on his face were

all put down to the same accident, and he excited interest as
a gallant and maimed ofﬁcer. He married, and lived contented
and happy to a good old age.
The Harpy proceeded with her prize to Mahon. Jack, as
usual, obtained a great deal of credit; whether he deserved
it, or whether, as Gascoigne observed, he always fell upon
his feet, the reader may decide from our narrative; perhaps
there was a little of both. The seamen of the Harpy, if sum-
moned in a hurry, used very often to reply, “Stop a minute,
I’ve got a bite: ” as for J ack, he often said to himself, “I have
a famous good yarn for the governor.”
CHAPTER XXIII.
Jack goes on another Cruise — Love and Diplomacy — Jack proves
himself too Clever for Three, and upsets all the Arrangements of the
High Contracting Powers.
A new days after the arrival of the Harpy at Port Mahon
a cutter came in with despatches from the admiral. Captain
Wilson found that he was posted into the Aurora frigate, in
which a vacancy had been made by the result of our hero’s
transgressions.
Mr. Sawbridge was raised to the rank of commander, and
appointed to the command of the Harpy. The admiral in-
formed Captain Wilson that he must detain the Aurora until
the arrival of another frigate, hourly expected, and then she
would be sent down to Mahon for him to take the command
of her. Further, he intimated that a supply of live bullocks
would be very agreeable, and begged that he would send to
Tetuan immediately.
Captain Wilson had lost so many ofﬁcers that he knew not
whom to send: indeed, now he was no longer in command of
the Harpy, and there was but one lieutenant, and no master
or master’s mate, Gascoigne and Jack were the only two
serviceable midshipmen, and he was afraid to trust them on
any expedition in which expedition was required.
“What shall we do, Sawbridge? shall we send Easy or

Ga/scoigne, or both, or neither? — for if the bullocks are
not forthcoming, the admiral will not let them off as we
do.”
“ We must send somebody, Wilson,” replied Captain Saw-
bridge, “and it is the custom to send two ofﬁcers, as one rc-
ceives the bullocks on board, while the other attends to the
embarkation.”
“Well, then send both, Sawbridge, but lecture them well
ﬁrst.”
“I don’t think they can get into any mischief there,”
replied Sawbridge; “and it’s such a hole that they will be
glad to get away from it.”
Easy and Gascoigne were summoned, listened very re-
spectfully to all Captain Sawbridge said, promised to con-
duct themselves with the utmost propriety, received a letter
to the vice-consul, and were sent with their hammocks and
chests in the cabin on board the Eliza Ann, brig, of two hun-
dred and sixteen tons, chartered by government — the master
and crew of which were all busy forward heaving up their
anchors.
The master of the transport came aft to receive them: he
was a short, red-haired young man, with hands as broad as
the ﬂappers of a turtle; he was broad-faced, broad-shouldered,
well-freckled, and pug-nosed; but if not very handsome he
was remarkably good-humoured. As soon as the chests and
hammocks were on deck, he told them that when he could
get the anchor up and make sail, he would give them some
bottled porter. Jack proposed that he should get the porter
up, and they would drink it while he got the anchor up, as it
would save time.
“It may save time, mayhap, but it won’t save porter,” re-
plied the master; “however, you shall have it.”
He called the boy, ordered him to bring up the porter,
and then went forward. Jack made the boy bring up two
chairs, put the porter on the companion hatch, and he and
Gascoigne sat down. The anchor was weighed, and the
transport ran out under her fore-topsail, as they were light-

handed, and had to secure the anchor. The transport passed
within ten yards of the Harpy, and Captain Sawbridge, when
he perceived the two midshipmen taking it so very easy, sit-
ting in their chairs with their legs crossed, arms folded, and
their porter before them, had a very great mind to order the
transport to heave-to, but he could spare no other ofﬁcer, so
he walked away, saying to himself, “‘1‘here’l1 be another yarn
for the governor, or I’m mistaken.”
As soon as sail was made on the transport, the master,
whose name was Hogg, came up to our hero, and asked him
how he found the porter. Jack declared that he never could
venture an opinion upon the ﬁrst bottle—“ So, Captain Hogg,
we’ll trouble you for a second” — after which they troubled
him for a third — begged for a fourth—must drink his health
in a ﬁfth — and ﬁnally, pointed out the propriety of making
up the half-dozen. By this time they found themselves rather
light-headed; so , desiring Captain Hogg to keep a sharp
look-out, and not to call them on any account whatever, they
retired to their hammocks.
The next morning they awoke late; the breeze was fresh
and fair: they requested Captain Hogg not to consider the
expense, as they would pay for all they ate and drank, and
all he did, into the bargain, and promised him a ﬁt-out when
they got to Tetuan.
What with this promise and calling him captain, our hero
and Gascoigne won the master’s heart, and being a very
good-tempered fellow, they did what they pleased. Jack also
tossed :1 doubloon to the men for them to drink on their
arrival, and all the men of the transport were in a transport
at Jack’s coming to “reign over them.” It must be acknow-
ledged that Jaek’s reign was, for the most part of it, “happy
and glorious.” At last they arrived at Tetuan, and our
Pylades and Orestes went on shore to call upon the vice-
consul, accompanied by Captain Hogg. They produced their
credentials, and demanded bullocks. The vice-consul was a
very young man, short and thin, and light-haired; his father
had held the situation before him, and he had been appointed

his successor because nobody else had thought the situation
worth applying for. Nevertheless, Mr. Hicks was impressed
with the immense responsibility of his ofﬁce. It was, how-
ever, a place of some little emolument at this moment, and
Mr. Hicks had plenty on his hands besides his sister, who,
being the only English lady there, set the fashion of the
place, and usurped all the attention of the gentlemen mariners
who occasionally came for bullocks. But Miss Hicks knew
her own importance, and had successively refused three mid-
shipmen, one master’s mate, and an acting purser. African
bullocks were plentiful at Tetuan, but English ladies were
scarce; moreover, she had a pretty little fortune of her own,
to wit, three hundred dollars in a canvas bag, left her by her
father, and entirely at her own disposal. Miss Hicks was
very like her brother, except that she was more dumpling in
her ﬁgure, with ﬂaxen hair; her features were rather pretty,
and her skin very fair. As soon as the preliminaries had
been entered into, and arrangements made in a small room
with bare walls, which Mr. Hicks denominated his ofﬁcc,
they were asked to walk into the parlour to be introduced to
the vice-consul’s sister. Miss Hicks tossed her head at the
two midshipmen, but smiled most graciously at Captain
Hogg. She knew the relative ranks of midshipman and cap-
tain. After a short time she requested the honour of Captain
Hogg’s company to dinner, and begged that he would bring
his midshipmen with him, at which Jack and Gascoigne
looked at each other and burst out in a laugh, and Miss
Hicks was very near rescinding the latter part of her invita-
tion. As soon as they were out of the house, they told the
captain to go on board and get all ready whilst they walked
round the town. Having peeped into every part of it, and
stared at Arabs, Moors, and Jews, till they were tired, they
proceeded to the landing-place, where they met the captain,
who informed them that he had done nothing, because the
men were all drunk with Jack’s doubloon. Jack replied that
a doubloon would not last for ever, and that the sooner they
drank it out the better. They then returned to the vice-

consul’s, whom they requested to procure for them ﬁfty dozen
of fowls, twenty sheep, and a great many other articles which
might be obtained at the place; for, as Jack said, they would
live well going up to Toulon, and if there were any of the
stock left, they would give them to the admiral, for Jack had
taken the precaution to put his father’s philosophy once more
to the proof, before he quitted Mahon. As Jack gave such a
liberal order, and the vice-consul cheated him out of at least
one-third of what he paid, Mr. Hicks thought he could do no
less than offer beds to our midshipmen as well as to Captain
Hogg; so, as soon as dinner was over, they ordered Captain
Hogg to go on board and bring their things on shore, which
he did. As the time usual for transports remaining at Tetuan
before they could be completed with bulloeks was three
weeks, our midshipmen decided upon staying at least so long
if they could ﬁnd anything to do; or if they could not, doing
nothing was inﬁnitely preferable to doing duty. So they
took up their quarters at the vice-consul’s, sending for porter
and other things which were not to be had but from the
transport; and Jack, to prove that he was not a swindler, as
Captain Tartar had called him, gave Captain Hogg a hun-
dred dollars on account, for Captain Hogg had a large stock
of porter and English luxuries, which he had brought out as
a venture, and of which he had still a considerable portion
left. As, therefore, our midshipmen not only were cheated
by the vice-consul, but they also supplied his table, Mr. Hicks
was very hospitable, and everything was at their service ex-
cept Miss Julia, who turned up her nose at a midshipman,
even upon full pay; but she made great advances to the cap-
tain, who, on his part, was desperately in love: so the mate
and the men made all ready for the bulloeks, Jack and Gas-
coigne made themselves comfortable, and Captain Hogg made
love, and thus passed the ﬁrst week.
The chamber of Easy and Gascoigne was at the top of the
house, and ﬁnding it excessively warm, Gascoigne had forced
his way up to the ﬁat roof above (for the houses are all built
in that way in most Mahomedan countries, to enable the oc-

rm. mnsmrmsn nssv. 233
cupants to enjoy the cool of the evening, and sometimes to
sleep there). Those roofs, where houses are built next to
each other, are divided by a wall of several feet, to insure
that privacy which the Mahomedan customs demand.
Gascoigne had not been long up there before he heard the
voice of a female, singing a plaintive air in a low tone, on the
other side of the wall. Gascoigne sang well himself, and
having a very ﬁne car, he was pleased with the correctness
of the notes, although he had never heard the air before. He
leant against the wall, smoked his-cigar, and listened. It
was repeated again and again at intervals; Gascoigne soon
caught the notes, which sounded so clear and pure in the
silence of the night.
At last they ceased, and having waited another half hour
in vain, our midshipman returned to his bed, humming the
air which had so pleased his ear. It haunted him during his
sleep, and rang in his ears when he awoke, as it is well known
any new air that pleases us will do. Before breakfast was
ready, Gascoigne had put English words to it, and sang them
over and over again. He inquired of the vice-consul who
lived in the next house, and was answered, that it was an old
Moor, who was reported to be wealthy, and to have a daughter,
whom many of the people had asked in marriage, but whether
for her wealth or for her beauty he could not tell; he had,
however, heard that she was very handsome. Gascoigne
made no further inquiries, but went out with Jack and Cap-
tain Hogg, and on board to see the water got in for the
bullocks.
“Where did you pick up that air, Gascoigne? It is very
pretty, but I never heard you sing it before.”
Gascoigne told him, and also what he had heard from Mr.
Hicks.
“I’m determined, Jack, to see that girl if I can. Hicks
can talk Arabic fast enough; just ask him the Arabic for
these words — ‘Don’t be afraid—I love you—I cannot speak
your tongue ,’— and put them down on paper as they are
pronounced.”

Jack rallied Gascoigne upon his fancy, which could end
in nothing.
“Perhaps not,” replied Gascoigne; “and I should have
cared nothing about it, if she had not sung so well. I really
believe the way to my heart is through my ear; — however, I
shall try to-night, and soon ﬁnd if she has the feeling which I
think she has. Now let us go back; I’m tired of looking at
women in garments up to their eyes, and men in dirt up to
their foreheads.”
As they entered the house they heard an altercation be-
tween Mr. and Miss Hicks.
“I shall never give my consent, Julia; one of those mid-
shipmen you turn your nose up at is worth a dozen Hoggs.”
“Now, if we only knew the price of a hog in this country,”
observed Easy, “we should be able to calculate our exact
value, Ned.”
“A hog, being an unclean animal, is not *3’
“Hush,” said Jack.
“Mr. Hicks,” replied Miss Julia, “I am mistress of myself
and my fortune, and I shall do as I please.”
“Depend upon it, you shall not, Julia. I consider it my
duty to prevent you from making an improper match; and, as
His Maj esty’s representative here, I cannot allow you to marry
this young man.”
“Mercy on us!” said Gascoigne, “His Majcsty’s repre-
sentative!”
“I shall not ask your consent,” replied the lady.
“Yes, but you shall not marry without my consent. 1
have, as you know, Julia, from my situation here, as one of
His Majcsty’s ‘corps diplomatick,’ great power, and I shall
forbid the banns; in fact, it is only I who can marry you.”
“Then I’ll marry elsewhere.”
“And what will you do on board of the transport until you
are able to be married?”
“I shall do as I think proper,” replied the lady; “and I’ll
thank you for none of your indelicate insinuations.” So say-
ing, the lady bounced out of the room into her own, and our

midshipmen then made a noise in the passage to intimate that
they had come in. They found Mr. Hicks looking very red
and vice-consular indeed, but he recovered himself; and Cap-
tain Hogg making his appearance, they went to dinner; but
Miss Julia would not make her appearance, and Mr. Hicks
was barely civil to the captain, but he was soon afterwards
called out, and our midshipmen went into the ofﬁce to enable
the two lovers to meet. They were heard then talking to-
gether, and after a time they said less, and their language
was more tender.
“Let us see what’s going on, Jack,” said Gascoigne; and
they walked softly, so as to perceive the two lovers, who were
too busy to be on the look-out.
Captain Hogg was requesting a lock of his mistress‘s hair.
The plump Julia could deny him nothing; she let fall her
ﬂaxen tresses, and taking out the scissors cut off a thick
bunch from her hair behind, which she presented to the cap-
tain; it was at least a foot and a half long, and an inch in
circumference. The captain took it in his immense hand, and
thrust it into his coat-pocket behind, but one thrust down to
the bottom would not get it in, so he thrust again and again
until it was all coiled away like a cable in a tier.
“That’s a liberal girl,” whispered Jack; “she gives by
wholesale what it will take some time to retail. But. here
comes Mr. Hicks, let’s give them warning; I like Hogg, and
as she fancies pork, she shall have it, if I can contrive to help
them.”
That night Gascoigne went again on the roof, and after
waiting some time heard the same air repeated: he waited
until it was concluded, and then, in a very low tone, sung it
himself to the words he had arranged for it. For some time
all was silent, and then the singing recommenced, but it was
not to the same air. Gascoigne waited until the new air had
been repeated several times, and then, giving full scope to
his ﬁne tenor voice, sang the ﬁrst air again. It echoed through
the silence of the night air, and then he waited, but in vain;

the soft voice of the female was heard no more, and Gascoigno
retired to rest.
This continued for three or four nights, Gascoigne singing
the same airs the ensuing night that he had heard the preced-
ing, until at last it appeared that the female had no longer
any fear, but changed the airs so as to be amused with the
repetition of them next evening. On the ﬁfth night she sang
the ﬁrst air, and our midshipman responding, she then sang
another, until she had sung them all, waiting each time for
the response. The wall was not more than eight feet high,
and Gascoigne now determined, with the assistance of Jack,
to have a sight of his unknown songstress. He asked Captain
Hogg to bring on shore some inch line, and he contrived to
make a ladder with three or four poles which were upstairs,
used for drying linen. He ﬁxed them against the wall without
noise, all ready for the evening. It was a beautiful, clear
moonlight night, when he went up, accompanied by Jack.
The air was again sung, and repeated by Gascoigne, who
then softly mounted the ladder, held by Jack, and raised his
head above the wall; be perceived a young Moorish girl,
splendidly dressed, half-lying on an ottoman, with her eyes
ﬁxed upon the moon, whose rays enabled him to observe that
she was indeed beautiful. She appeared lost in contempla-
tion; and Gascoigne would have given the world to have
divined her thoughts. Satisﬁed with what he had seen, he
descended, and singing one of the airs, he then repeated the
words, “Do not be afraid — I love you — I cannot speak your
language.” He then sang another of the airs, and after he
had ﬁnished he again repeated the words in Arabic; but there
was no reply. He sang the third air, and again repeated the
words, when, to his delight, he heard an answer in Lingua
Franea.
“Can you speak in this tongue?”
“Yes,” replied Gascoigne, “I can, Allah be praised! Be
not afraid — I love you.”
“I know you not; who are you? you are not of my people.”

“No, but I will be anything that you wish. I am a Frank,
and an English ofﬁcer.”
At this reply of Gascoigne there was a pause.
“Am I then despised?” said Gascoigne.
“ No, not despised; but you are not of my people, or of my
land; speak no more, or you will be heard.”
“I obey,” replied Gascoigne, “since you wish it; but I
shall pine till to-morrow’s moon. I go to dream of you. Allah
protect you!”
“How amazingly poetical you were in your language,
Ned,” said Easy, when they went down into their room.
“To be sure, Jack, I’ve read the Arabian Nights. You
never saw such eyes in your life: what a houri she is!”
“ Is she as handsome as Agnes, Ned?”
“Twice as handsome by moonlight.”
“That’s all moonshine, and so will be your courting, for it
will come to nothing.”
“Not if I can help it.”
“Why, Gascoigne, what would you do with a wife?”
“Just exactly what you would do, Jack.”
“I mean, my dear Ned , can you at-lord to marry?”
“Not while the old governor lives, but I know he has
some money in the funds. He told me one day that I could
not expect more than three thousand pounds. You know I
have sisters.”
“And before you come into that you’ll have three thousand
children.”
“ That’s a large family, Jack ,” replied Gascoigne, burst-
ing out into laughter, in which our hero joined.
“Well, you know I only wanted to argue the point with
ou.”
y “I know that, Jack. But I think we’re counting our
chickens before they are hatched, which is foolish.”
“In every other case except when we venture upon matri-
mony.”
“Why, Jack, you’re becoming quite sensible.”_

“My wisdom is for my friends, my folly for myself. Good
night.”
But Jack did not go to sleep.
“I must not allow Gascoigne to do such a foolish thing,”
thought he. “Many a dark girl on midshipman’s pay, if he
succeeds —- get his throat cut if he does not.”
As Jack said, his wisdom was for his friends, and he was
so generous that be reserved none for his own occasions.
Miss Julia Hicks, as we before observed, set the fashions
at Tetuan, and her style of dress was not unbecoming. The
Moorrsh women were large veils, or they may be called what
you will, for their head-dresses descend to their heels at times
and cover the whole body, leaving an eye to peep with, and
hiding everything else. Now Miss found this much more
convenient than the bonnet, as she might walk out in the heat
of the sun without burning her fair skin, and stare at every-
body and everything without being stared at in return. She
therefore never went out without one of these overalls, com-
posed of several yards of ﬁne muslin. Her dress in the house
was usually of coloured sarcenet, for a small vessel came into
the port one day during her father’s lifetime, unloaded a great
quantity of bales of goods with English marks, and, as the
vessel had gone out in ballast, there was a surmise on his
part by what means they came into the captain’s possession.
He therefore cited the captain up to the governor, but the
affair was amicably arranged by the vice-consul receiving
about one quarter of the cargo in bales of silks and muslins.
Miss Hicks had therefore all her dresses of blue, green, and
yellow sarcenet, which , with the white muslin overall, made
her as conspicuous as the only Frankish lady in the town had
a right to be, and there was not a dog which barked in Tetuan
which did not know the sister of the vice-consul, although few
had seen her face.
Now it occurred to Jack, as Gascoigne was determined
to carry on his amour, that in case of surprise it would be as
well if be dressed himself as Miss Hicks. He proposed it to
Gascoigne the next morning, who approved of the idea, and

in the course of the day, when Miss Hicks was busy with
Captain Hogg, he contrived to abstract one of her dresses and
muslin overalls, which he could. do in safety, as there were
plenty of them, for Miss Hicks was not troubled with mantua-
makers‘ bills.
When Gascoignc went up on the roof the ensuing night,
he put on the apparel of Miss Hicks, and looked very like
her as far as ﬁgure went, although a little taller. He waited
for the Moorish girl to sing, but she did not; so he crept up
the ladder and looked over the wall, when he observed that
she was reclining as before in deep thought. His head,
covered with the muslin, caught her eye, and she gave a faint
scream.
“Fear not, lady,” said Gasco1gne, “it is not the ﬁrst time
that I have beheld that sweet face. I sigh for a companion.
\Vhat would I not give to be sitting by your side! I am not
of your creed ’tis true, but does it therefore follow that we
should not love each other?”
The Moorish girl was about to reply, when Gascoigne re~
ceived an answer from a quarter whence he littlc expected it.
It was from the Moor himself, who, hearing his daughter
scream, had come swiftly up to the roof.
“Does the Frankish lily wish to mingle her perfumes
with the dark violet?” said he; for he had often seen the
sister of the vice-consul, and he imagined it was she who had
come on the roof and ascended the wall to speak with his
daughter.
Gaseoignc had presence of mind to avail himself of this
fortunate mistake.
“I am alone, worthy Moor,” replied hc, pullrng the muslin
over his face, “and I pine for a. companion. I have been
charmed by the nightingale on the roof of your dwelling; but
I thought not to meet the face of a man when I took courage
to climb this ladder.”
“If the Frankish lily will have courage to descend, she
can sit by the side of the dark violet.”
Gascoignc thought it advisable to make no reply.

“Fear not,” said the old Moor; “what is an old man but
a woman!” and the Moor brought a ladder, which he placed
against the wall.
After a pause Gascoigne said, “It is my fate;” and he
- then descended, and was led by the Moor to the mattress
upon which his daughter reclined. The Moor then took his
seat near them, and they entered into conversation. Gas-
coigne knew quite enough of the vice-consul and his daughter
to play his part, and he thought proper to tell the Moor that
her brother wished to give her as wife to the captain of the
ship, whom she abhorred, and would take her to a cold and
foggy climate; that she had been born here, and wished to
live and die here, and would prefer passing her life in his wo-
men’s apartments to leaving this country. At which, Abd el
Faza, for such was his name, felt very amorous. He put
his hand to his forehead, salaamed, and told Gascoigne that
his zenana, and all that were in it, were hers, as well as his
house and himself. After an hour’s conversation, in which
Azar, his daughter, did not join, the old Moor asked Gas-
coigne to descend into the women’s apartment; and observing
his daughter’s silence, said to her —
“Azar, you are angry that this Frankish houri should
come to the apartments of which you have hitherto been sole
mistress. Fear not, you will soon be another’s, for Osman
Ali has asked thee for his wife, and 1 have listened to his re-
quest.”
Now Osman Ali was as old as her father, and Azar hated
him. She offered her hand tremblingly, and led Gascoigne
into the zenana. The Moor attended them to the threshold,
bowed, and left them.
That Gascoigne had time to press his suit, and that he
did not lose such a golden opportunity, may easily be im-
agined, and her father’s communication relative to Osman
Ali very much assisted our midshipman’s cause.
He left the zenana, like most midshipmen, in love; that
is, a little above quicksilver boiling heat. Jack, who had re-
mained in a state of some suspense all this time, was not

rm. mosmrmm nssv. 241
sorry to hear voices in an amicable tone, and in a few minutes
afterwards he perceived that Gascoigne was ascending the
ladder. It occurred to our hero that it was perhaps advisable
that he should not be seen, as the Moor in his gallantry might
come up the ladder with his supposed lady. He was right,
for Abd el Faza not only followed her up the ladder on his
side but assisted her to descend on the other, and with great
ceremony took his leave.
Gascoigne hastened to Jack, who had been peeping, and
gave him a detail of what had passed, describing Azar as the
most beautiful, fascinating, and fond creature that ever was
created. After half an hour's relation he stopped short, be-
cause he discovered that Jack was fast asleep.
The visits of Gascoigne were repeated every night; old
Abd el Faza became every time more gallant, and our mid-
shipman was under the necessity of assuming a virtue if he
had it not. He pretended to be very modest.
In the meantime Captain Hogg continued his attentions to
the real Miss Hicks. The mate proceededto get the bullocks
on board, and as more than three weeks had already passed
away, it was time to think of departing for Toulon; but
Captain Hogg was too much in love; and as for Gascoigne,
he intended, like all midshipmen in love, to give up the
service. Jack reasoned with the captain, who appeared to
listen to reason, because Miss Hicks had agreed to follow his
fortunes, and crown his transports in the transport Mary
Ann. He therefore proposed that they should get away as
fast as they could, and as soon as they had weighed the
anchor he would come on shore, take off Miss Hicks, and
make all sail for Toulon.
Jack might have suﬂered this; the difﬁculty was with
Gascoigne, who would not hear of going away without his
lovely Azar. At last Jack planned a scheme, which he
thought would succeed, and which would be a good joke to
tell the governor. He therefore appeared to consent to Gas-
coignc’s carrying off his little Moor, and they canvassed how
it was to be managed. Jack then told Gascoigne that he had

_hit upon a plan which would succeed. “I ﬁnd,” said he,
“from Captain Hogg, that he has an intention of carrying oﬂ‘
Miss Hicks and when I sounded him as to his having a lady
with him, he objected to it immediately, saying, that he must
have all the cabin to himself and his intended. Now, in the
ﬁrst place, I have no notion of giving up the cabin to Miss
Hicks or Mrs. Hogg. It will be very uncomfortable to be
shut out, because he wishes to make love; I therefore am
determined that he shall not take off Miss Hicks. He has
proposed to me that he shall go on board, and get the brig
under way, leaving me with a boat on shore to sign the
vouchers, and that Miss Hicks shall slip into the boat when
I go oft‘ at dusk. Now I will not bring off Miss Hicks; if he
wants to marry her, let him do it when I am not on board.
I have paid for everything, and I consider the cabin as mine.
“Look you, Ned, if you wish to carry off your little Moor,
there is but one way, and that is a very simple one; leave her
a dress of Miss Hicks’s when you go there to-morrow night,
and tell her to slip down at dusk, and come out of the house:
all the danger will be in her own house, for as soon as she is
out, she will be supposed to be the vice-consul’s sister, and
will not be observed or questioned. I will look out for and
bring her on board instead of Miss Hicks. Hogg will have
the brig under way, and will be too happy to make all sail,
and she shall lock the cabin inside, so that the mistake shall
not be discovered till the next morning, and we shall have a
good laugh at Captain Hogg.”
Gascoigne pronounced that J ack’s scheme was capital, and
agreed to it, thanking him, and declaring that he was the
best friend that he ever had. “So I will be,” thought Jack,
“but you will not acknowledge it at ﬁrst.” Jack then went
to Captain Hogg, and appeared to enter warmly into his
views, but told him that Hicks suspected what was going on,
and had told him so, at the same time declaring that he would
not lose sight of his sister until after Hogg was on board.
“Now,” says Jack, “you know you cannot do the thing
by main force; so the best plan will be for you to go on board

rm. MIDSHIPMAN Easy. 243
and get under way, leaving me to bring oﬂ-‘ Miss Hicks, when
her brotherwill imagine all danger to be over.”
“Many thanks, Mr. Easy,” replied Captain Hogg; “it
will be capital, and I’ll arrange it all with my Sophy. How
very kind of you! ”
“But, Hogg, will you promise me secrecy?”
“Yes,” replied the captain.
“That Gascoigne is a very silly fellow, and wants to run
away with a girl he has made acquaintance with here; and
what do you think he has proposed? that after the ship was
under Way, that I shall carry her off in the boat; and he has
borrowed one of the dresses of Miss Hicks, that it may appear
to be her. I have agreed to it, but as I am determined that
he shall not commit such a folly, I shall bring off Miss Hicks
instead; and, observe, Hogg, he is that sort of wild fellow,
that if he was to ﬁnd that I had cheated him, he would im-
mediately go on shore and be left behind; therefore we must
hand Miss Hicks down in the cabin, and she will lock the
door all night, so that he may not observe the trick till the
next morning, and then we shall have a ﬁne laugh at
him.Il
Captain Hogg replied it would be an excellent joke, as
Gascoigne did before him.
Now it must be observed, that the water and the bullocks,
and the sheep and fowls, were all on board; and Mr. Hicks,
having received his money from Jack, had very much altered’
his manner; he was barely civil, for as he had got all he
could out of our hero, he was anxious to get rid of him as
well as of Captain Hogg. Our hero was very indignant at
this, but as it would not suit his present views, pretended not
to notice it—on the contrary, he professed the warmest
friendship for the vice-consul, and took an opportunity of
saying that he could not return his kindness in a better way
than by informing him of the plot which had been arranged.
He then told ’him of the intended escape of his sister, and
that he was the person intended to bring her off.

“Infamous, by heavens!” cried the vice-consul; “I shall
write to the foreign ofﬁce on the subject.”
“I think,” said Jack, “it will be much better to do what
I shall propose , which will end in a hearty laugh, and to the
confusion of Captain Hogg. Do you dress yourself in your
sister’s clothes, and I will bring you off instead of her. Let
him imagine that he has your sister secure; I will hand you
down to the cabin, and do you lock yourself in. He cannot
sail without my orders, and I will not sign the vouchers. The
next morning we will open the cabin-door and have a good
laugh at him. Desire your boat to be of at daylight to take
you on shore, and I will then make him proceed to Toulon
forthwith. It will be a capital joke.”
So thought the vice-consul, as well as Gascoigne and
Captain Hogg. He shook hands with Jack, and was as civil
to him as before.
That night Gascoigne left one of Miss Hicks’s many dresses
with Azar, who agreed to follow his fortunes, and who packed
up all the- jewels and money she could lay her hands upon.
Poor little child, she trembled with fear and delight. Miss
Hicks smuggled, as she thought, a box of clothes on board,
and in the box was her fortune of three hundred dollars. Mr.
Hicks laughed in his sleeve, so did Jack; and every one went
to bed with expectations that their wishes would be realised.
After an early dinner, Captain Hogg and Gascoigne went on
board, both squeezing Jack’s hand as if they were never to
see himagain, and looks of intelligence passed between all
the parties.
As soon as they were out of the door the vice-consul
chuckled, and Miss Hicks, who thought he chuckled at the
idea of having rid himself of Captain Hogg, chuckled still
more as she looked at our hero, who was her conﬁdant; and
our hero, for reasons known to the reader, chuckled more
than either of them.
A little before dark, the boat was sent on shore from the
brig, which was now under way, and Mr. Hicks, as had been
agreed, said that he should go into the ofﬁce and prepare the

vouchers—that is, put on his sister’s clothes. Miss Hicks
immediately rose, and wishing our hero a pleasant voya e,
as had been agreed, said that she should retire for the ni t,
as she had a bad headache —she wished her brother géiod
night, and went into her room to wait another hour, when our
hero, having shoved off the boat to deceive the vice-consul,
was to return, meet her in the garden, and take her off to the
brig. Our hero then went into the ofﬁce and assisted the
vice-consul, who took oﬂ all his own clothes and tied them up
in a handkerchief, intending to resume them after he had
gone into the cabin.
As soon as he was ready, Jack carried his bundle and led
the supposed Miss Hicks down to the boat. They shoved off
in a great hurry, and Jack took an opportunity of dropping
Mr. Hicks’s bundle overboard. As soon as they arrived along-
side, Mr. Hicks ascended, and was handed by Jack down into
the cabin: he squeezed Jaek’s hand as he entered, saying in
a whisper, “ To-morrow morning what a laugh we shall have!”
and then he locked the door. In the meantime the boat was
hooked on and hoisted up, and Jack took the precaution to
have the dead lights lowered, that Mr. Hicks might not be
able to ascertain what was going on. Gascoigne came up to
our hero and squeezed his hand.
“I’m so much obliged to you, Jack. I say, to-morrow
morning what a laugh we shall have!”
As soon as the boat was up, and the mainyard ﬁlled, Cap-
tain Hogg also came up to our hero, shaking him by the
hand and thanking him; and he too concluded by saying, “I
say, Mr. Easy, to-morrow morning what a laugh we shall
have!”
“Let those laugh who win,” thought Jack.
The wind was fair, the watch was set, the course was
steered, and all went down to their hammocks, and went to
sleep, waiting for to-morrow morning. Mr. Hicks, also, having
nothing better to do, went to sleep, and by the morning dawn,
the transport Mary Ann was more than a hundred miles from
the African shore. ‘

CHAPTER XXIV.
Our Hero plays the very Devil.
We must leave the reader to imagine the effect of the next
morning’s dénouement. Every one was in a fury except Jack,
who did nothing but laugh. The captain wanted to return
to obtain Miss Hicks, Gascoigne to obtain Azar, and the vice-
consul to obtain his liberty — but the wind was foul for their
return, and Jack soon gained the captain on his side. He
pointed out to him that, in the ﬁrst place, if he presumed to
return, he would forfeit his charter bond; in the second, he
would have to pay for all the bullocks that died; in the third,
thatdfhe wished to take Miss Hicks as his wife, he must not
ﬁrst injure her character by having her on board before the
solemnity; and lastly, that he could always go and marry her
whenever he pleased; the brother could not prevent him. All
this was very good advice, and the captain became quite calm
and rational, and set his studding-sails below and aloft.
As for Gascoigne, it was no use reasoning with him, so it
was agreed‘ that he should have satisfaction as soon as they
could get on shore again. Mr. Hicks was the most violent;
he insisted that the vessel should return, while both Jack and
the captain refused, although he threatened them with the
whole Foreign Ofﬁce. He insisted upon having his clothes,
but Jack replied that they had tumbled overboard as they
pulled from the shore. He then commanded the mate and
men to take the vessel back, but they laughed at him and his
woman’s clothes. “At all events, I’ll have you turned out of
the service,” said he to our hero in his fury. “I shall be ex-
tremely obliged to you,” said Jack — and Captain Hogg was
so much amused with the vice-consul’s appearance in his sis-
ter’s clothes that he quite forgot his own disappointment in
laughing at his intended brother-in-law. He made friends
again with Jack, who regained his ascendancy, and ordered
out the porter on the capstern-head. They had an excellent
dinner, but Mr. Hicks refused to join them, which however

MR. mnsmrmnn nssv. 247
did not spoil the appetite of Jack or the captain: as for Gas-
coigne, he could not eat a mouthful, but he drank to excess,
looking over the rim of his tumbler, as if he could devour our
hero, who only laughed the more. Mr. Hicks had applied to
the men to lend him some clothes, but Jack had foreseen that,
and he was omnipotent. There was not a jacket or a pair of
trousers to be had for love or money. Mr. Hicks then con-
sidered it advisable to lower his tone, and he applied to Cap-
tain Hogg, who begged to be excused without he consented
to his marriage with his sister, to which Mr. Hicks gave an
indignant negative. He then applied to Gascoigne, who told
him in a very surly tone to go to h—ll. At last he applied
to our hero, who laughed, and said that he would see him
d—d ﬁrst. So Mr. Hicks sat down in his petticoats and vowed
revenge. Gascoigne, who had drunk much and eaten nothing,
turned in and went to sleep — while Captain Hogg and our
hero drank porter on the capstern. Thus passed the ﬁrst day,
and the wind was famously fair -—- the bulloeks lowed, the
cocks crew, the sheep baa’d, and the Mary Ann made up-
wards of two hundred miles. Jack took possession of the
other berth in the cabin, and His Majesty’s representative
was obliged to lie down in his petticoats upon a topsail which
lay between decks, with a bullock on each side of him, who
every now and then made a dart at him with their horns, as
if they knew that it was to him that they were indebted for
their embarkation and being destined to drive the scurvy out
of the Toulon ﬂeet.
We cannot enter into the details of the passage, which, as
the wind was fair, was accomplished in ten days without the
loss of a bullock. During this time Mr. Hicks condescended
to eat without speaking, imagining that the hour of retribu-
tion would come when they joined the admiral. Gascoigne
gradually recovered himself, but did not speak to our hero,
who continued to laugh and drink porter. On the eleventh
morning they were in the midst of the Toulon ﬂeet, and Mr.
Hicks smiled exultingly as he passed our hero in his petti-
coats, and wondered that Jack showed no signs of trepidation.

The ﬂeet hove-to, Jack ran under the admiral’s stern,
lowered down his boat, and went on board, showed his cre-
dentials, and reported his bullocks. The general signal was
made, there was a fair division of the spoil, and then the ad-
miral asked our hero whether the master of the transport had
any other stock on board. J aek replied that he had not; but
that having been told by the governor of Malta that they
might be acceptable, he had bought a few sheep and some
dozen of fowls, which were much at his service, if he would
accept of them. The admiral was much obliged to the go-
vernor, and also to Jack, for thinking of him, but would not,
of course, accept of the stock without paying for them. He
requested him to send all of them on board that he could
spare, and then asked Jack to dine with him, for Jack had
put on his best attire, and looked very much of a gentleman.
“Mr. Easy ,” said the ﬂag-captain, who had been looking
at the transport with his glass, “is that the master’s wife on
board.”
“No, sir,” replied Jack; “it’s the vice-consul.”
“What, in petticoats! the vice-consul?”
“Yes, the vice-consul of Tetuan. He came on board in
' that dress when the brig was under way, and I considered it
my duty not to delay, being aware how very important it was
that the ﬂeet should be provided with fresh beef.”
“What is all this, Mr. Easy?” said the admiral; “there
has been some trick here. You will oblige me by coming into
the cabin.”
Easy followed the admiral and ﬂag-captain into the cabin,
and then boldly told the whole story how he tricked them
all. It was impossible for either of them to help laughing,
and when they began to laugh, it was almost as impossible
to stop.
“Mr. Easy,” said the admiral at last, “I do not altogether
blame you; it appears that the captain of the transport would
have delayed sailing because he was in love — and that Mr.
Gascoigne would have stayed behind because he was in-
fatuated, independent of the ill-will against the English which

MR. mmsmrmnu EsSY. 249
would have been excited by the abduction of the girl. Butl
think you might have contrived to manage all that without
putting the vice-consul in petticoats.”
“I acted to the best of my judgment, sir,” replied Jack,
very humbly.
“And altogether you have done well. Captain Malcolm,
send a boat for the vice-consul.”
Mr. Hicks was too impatient to tell his wrongs to care for
his being in his sister’s clothes: he came on board, and al-
though the tittering was great, be imagined that it would soon
be all in his favour, when it was known that he was a di-
plomatic. He told his story, and waited for the decision of
the admiral, which was to crush our hero, who stood with the
midshipmen on the lee side of the deck; but the admiral re-
plied, “Mr. Hicks, in the ﬁrst place, this appears to me to be
a family affair concerning the marriage of your sister, with
which I have nothing to do. You went on board of your own
free will in woman’s clothes. Mr. Easy’s orders were positive,
and he obeyed them. It was his duty to sail as soon as the
transport was ready. You may forward your complaint if
you please, but, as a friend, I tell you that it will probably
occasion your dismissal; for these kind of pranks are not
understood at the Foreign Ofﬁce. You may return to the
transport, which, after she has touched at Mahon, will pro-
ceed again to Tetuan. The boat is alongside, sir.”
Mr. Hicks, astonished at the want of respect paid to a
vice-consul, shoved his petticoats between his legs, and went
down the side amidst the laughter of the whole of the ship’s
company. Our hero dined with the admiral, and was well
received. He got his orders to sail that night for Minorca,
and as soon as dinner was over he returned on board, where
he found Captain Hogg very busy selling his porter — Gas-
coigne walking the deck in a brown study — and Mr. Hicks
solus abaft, sulking in his petticoats.
As soon as they were clear of the boats, the Mary Ann
hoisted her ensign and made sail, and as all the porter was
not yet sold, Jack ordered up a bottle.

Jack was much pleased with the result of his explanation
with the admiral, and he felt that, for once, he had not only
got into no scrape himself, but that he had prevented others.
Gascoigne walked the deck gloomily; the fact was, that he
was very unhappy; he had had time to reﬂect, and now that
the ﬁrst violence had subsided, he felt that our hero had done
him a real service, and had prevented him from commiting
an act of egregious folly; and yet he had summoned this
friend to meet him in the ﬁeld — and such had been his
gratitude. He would have given the world to recall what had
passed, and to make friends, but he felt ashamed, as most
people do, to acknowledge his error; he had, however, almost
made up his mind to it, and was walking up and down think-
ing in what manner he might contrive it, when Jack, who was
sitting, as usual, in a chair by the capstern, with his porter
by him, said to himself, “Now I’ll lay my life that Ned wants
to make friends, and is ashamed to speak ﬁrst; I may be mis-
taken, and he may ﬂy 011' at a tangent; but even if I am, at
all events it will not be I who am wrong — I’ll try him.” Jack
waited till Gascoigne passed him again, and then said, look-
ing kindly and knowingly in his face, —
“I say, Ned, will you have a glass of porter?”
Gascoigne smiled, and Jack held out his hand; the recon-
ciliation was effected in a moment, and the subject of quarrel
was not canvassed by either party.
“We shall be at Minorca in a day or two,” observed Jack,
after a while; “now I shall be glad to get there. Do you
know, Ned, that I feel very much satisﬁed with myself; I
have got into no scrape this time, and I shall, notwithstanding,
have a good story to tell the governor when I go to Malta.”
“Partly at my expense,” replied Gaseoigne.
“Why, you will ﬁgure a little in it, but others will ﬁgure
much more.”
“I wonder what has become of that poor girl,” observed
Gascoigne, who could not refrain from mentioning her;
“what hurts me most is, that she must think me such a
brute.”

“No doubt of that, Ned , — take another glass of porter.”
“Her father gave me this large diamond.”
“The old goat — sell it, and drink his health with it.”
“No, I’ll keep it in memory of his daughter.”
Here Gascoigne fell into a melancholy reverie, and Jack
thou ht of A nes.
11% two da§s they arrived at Mahon, and found the Aurora
already there, in the command of Captain Wilson. Mr. Hicks
had persuaded Captain Hogg to furnish him with clothes,
Jack having taken oif the injunction as soon as he had
quitted the admiral. Mr. Hicks was aware, that if the ad-
miral would not listen to his complaint, it was no use speak-
ing to a captain: so he remained on board a pensioner upon
Captain Hogg, and after our midshipmen quitted the trans-
port they became very good friends. Mr. Hicks consented to
the match, and Captain Hogg was made happy. As for poor
Azar, she had wandered about until she was tired, in Miss
Hicks’s dress, and at last returned broken-hearted to her
father’s, and was admitted by Abd el Faza himself ; he ima-
gined it was Miss Hicks, and was in transports — he dis-’
covered it was his daughter, and he was in a The next
day she went to the zenana of Osman Ali.
When Jack reported himself he did not tell the history of
the elopements, that he might not hurt the feelings of Gas-
eoigne. Captain Wilson was satisﬁed with the manner in
which he had executed his orders, and asked him, “whether
he preferred staying in the Harpy, or following him into the
Aurora.”
Jack hesitated.
“Speak frankly, Mr. Easy; if you prefer Captain Saw-
bridge to me, I shall not be aﬂ"r0nted.”
“No, sir,” replied Easy, “I do not prefer Captain Saw-
bridge to you; you have both been equally kind to me, but I
prefer you. But the fact is, sir, that I do not much like to
part with Gascoigne, or -—-”
“Or who?” said the captain, smiling.
“With Mesty, sir; you may think me very foolish, but I

should not be alive at this moment, if it had not been for
him.”
“I do not consider gratitude to be foolish, Mr. Easy,” re-
plied Captain Wilson. “Mr. Gascoigne I intend to take with
me, if he chooses to come, as I have a great respect for his
father, and no fault to ﬁnd with him, that is, generally speak-
ing; but as for Mesty -—- why he is a good man, and as you
have behaved yourself very well, perhaps I may think of it.”
The next day Mesty was included among the boat’s crew
taken with him by Captain Wilson, according to the regula-
tions of the service, and appointed to the same situation under
the master at arms of the Aurora. Gascoigne and our hero
were also discharged into the frigate.
As our hero never has shown any remarkable predilection
for duty, the reader will not be surprised at his requesting
from Captain Wilson a few days on shore, previous to his
going on board of the Aurora. Captain Wilson allowed the
same licence to Gascoigne, as they had both been cooped up
for some time on board of a transport. Our hero took up his
quarters at the only respectable hotel in the town, and when-
ever he could meet an ofﬁcer of the Aurora, he very politely
begged the pleasure of his company to dinner. Jack’s repu-
tation had gone before him, and the midshipmen drank his
wine and swore he was a trump. Not that Jack was to be
deceived, but, upon the principles of equality, he argued that
it was the duty of those who could afford dinners to give them
to those who could not. This was a sad error on J ack’s part;
but he had not yet learnt the value of money; he was such a
fool as to think that the only real use of it was to make other
people happy. It must, however, be offered in his extenua-
tion that he was a midshipman and a philosopher, and not
yet eighteen.
At last Jack had remained so long on shore, keeping open
house, and the ﬁrst-lieutenant of the Aurora found the ofﬁcers
so much more anxious for leave, now that they were at little
or no expense, that he sent him a very polite message, re-
questing the pleasure of his company on board that evening.


## p. 253 (#261) ############################################

Jack returned an equally polite answer, informing the ﬁrst-
lieutenant that not being aware that he wished to see him, he
had promised to accompany some friends to a masquerade
that night, but that he would not fail to pay his respects to
him the next day. The ﬁrst-lieutenant admitted the excuse,
and our hero, after having entertained half-a-dozen of the
Auroras, for the Harpy had sailed two days before, dressed
himself for the masquerade, which was held in a church about
two miles and a half from Mahon.
Jack had selected the costume of the devil, as being the
most appropriate, and mounting a jackass, he rode down in
his dress to the masquerade. But, as Jack was just going in,
he perceived a yellow carriage, with two footmen in gaudy
liveries, draw up, and with his usual politeness, when the
footmen opened the door, offered his arm to hand out a fat
old dowager covered with diamonds; the lady looked up, and
perceiving Jack covered with hair, with his trident and his
horns, and long tail, gave a loud scream, and would have
fallen had it not been for Captain Wilson, who, in his full
uniform, was coming in, and caught her in his arms: while
the old lady thanked him, and Captain Wilson bowed, Jack
hastily retreated. “I shall make no conquests to-night,”
thought he; so he entered the church, and joined the crowd;
‘but it was so dense that it was hardly possible to move, and
our hero soon got tired of ﬂourishing his trident, and sticking
it into people, who wondered what the devil he meant.
“This is stupid work,” thought Jack, “I may have more
fun outside:” so Jack put on his cloak, left the masquerade,
and went out in search of adventures. He walked into the
open country, about half a mile, until he came to a splendid
house, standing in a garden of orange-trees, which be de-
termined to reconnoitre. He observed that a window was
open and lights were in the room; and he climbed up to the
window, and just opened the white curtain and looked in.
On a bed lay an elderly person, evidently dying, and by the
side of the bed were three priests, one of whom held the
cruciﬁx in his hand, another the censer, and a third was sit-

ting at a table with a paper, pen, and ink. As Jack under-
stood Spanish, he listened, and heard one of the priests
Bay; _’
“Your sins have been enormous, my son, and I cannot
give you extreme unction or absolution unless you make some
amends.”
“I have,” answered the moribund, “left money for ten
thousand masses to be said for my soul.”
“Five hundred thousand masses are not sufﬁcient: how
have you gained your enormous wealth? by usury and rob-
bing the poor.”
“I have left a thousand dollars to be distributed among
the poor on the day of my f1111el‘3. .”
“One thousand dollars is nothing — you must leave all
your property to holy church.”
“And my children!” replied the dying man, faintly.
“What are your children compared to your salvation? —-
reply not: either consent, or not only do I refuse you the
consolation of the dying, but I excommunicate ——”
“Mercy, holy father — mercy!” said the old man, in a
dying voice.
“There is no mercy, you are damned for ever and ever.
Amen. Now hear: excommunicabo te ——”
“ Stop — stop — have you the paper ready?”
“ ’Tis here, all ready, by which you revoke all former
wills, and endow the holy church with your property. We
will read it, for God forbid that it should be said that the
holy church received an involuntary gif .”
“I will sign it,” replied the dying man; “but my sight
fails me; be quick, absolve me.” And the paper was signed,
with difﬁculty, as the priests supported the dying man. “And
now — absolve me.”
“I do absolve thee,” replied the priest, who then went
through the ceremony.
“Now this is a confounded rascally business,” said Jack
to himself; who then dropped his cloak, jumped upon the

window-sill, opened wide the window curtains with both
' hands, and uttered a. yelling kind of “ha! ha! ha! ha!”
The priests turned round, saw the demon as they ima-
gined — dropped the paper on the table, and threw them-
selves with their faces on the ﬂoor.
“Exercise te,” stammered one.
“Ha! ha! ha! ha!” repeated Jack, entering the room,
and taking up the paper which he burnt by the ﬂame of the
candle. Our hero looked at the old man on the bed; his jaw
had fallen, his eyes were turned. He was dead. Jack then
gave one more “ha! ha! ha! ha!” to keep the priests in their
places, blew out the candles, made a spring out of the win-
dow, caught up his cloak, and disappeared as fast as his legs
could carry him.
Jack ran until he was out of breath, and then he stopped,
and sat down by the side of the road. It was broad moon-
light, and Jack knew not where he was: “but Minorca has
not many high roads,” thought Jack, “and I shall ﬁnd my
way home. Now, let me see, — I have done some good this
evening. I have prevented those rogues from disinheriting a
family. I wonder who they are; they ought to be inﬁnitely
obliged to me. But if the priests ﬁnd me out, what shall]
do? I never dare come on shore again — they’d have me in
the Inquisition. I wonder where I am,” said Jack; “I will
get on that hill, and see if I can take a departure.”
The bill was formed by the road being cut perpendicularly
almost through it, and was perhaps some twelve or fourteen
feet high. Jack ascended it, and looked about him. “There
is the sea, at all events, with the full moon silvering the
waves,” said Jack, turning from the road, “and here is the
road; then that must be the way to Port Mahon. But what
comes here? —- it’s a carriage. Why, it’s the yellow carriage
of that old lady with her diamonds, and her two splashy foot-
men!” Jack was watching it as it passed the road under him,
when of a sudden, he perceived about a dozen men rush out,
and seize the horses’ heads, — a discharge of ﬁre-arms, the
coachman dropped off the box, and the two footmen dropped

from behind. The robbers then opened the door, and were
hauling out the fat old lady covered with diamonds. Jack.
thought a second—it occurred to him, that although he could
not cope with so many, he might frighten them, as he had
frightened one set of robbers already that night. The old
lady had just been tumbled out of the carriage-door, like a
large bundle of clothes tied up for the wash, when Jack
throwing off his cloak, and advancing to the edge of the pre-
cipice, with the full moon behind him throwing out his ﬁgure
in strong relief, raised his trident, and just as they were
raising their knives, yelled a most unearthly “ha, ha, ha,
ha!” The robbers looked up, and forgetting the masquerade,
for there is a double tremor in guilt, screamed with fear;
most of them ran away, and dropped after a hundred yards;
others remained paralysed and insensible. Jack descended
the hill, went to the assistance of the old lady, who had
swooned, and had to put her into the carriage; but although
our hero was very strong, this was a work of no small diffi-
culty. After one or two attempts, he lowered down the steps
and contrived to bump her on the ﬁrst, from the ﬁrst he pur-
chased her on the second, and from the second he at last
seated her at the door of the carriage. Jack had no time to
be over-polite. He'then threw her back into the bottom of
the carriage, her heels went up to the top, Jack shoved in
her petticoats as fast as he could, for decency, and then shut-
ting the door seized the reins, and jumped upon the box. “I
don’t know the way,” thought Jack, “but we must needs go
when the devil drives; ” so sticking his trident into the horses,
they set off at a rattling pace, passing over the bodies of the
two robbers, who had held the reins, and who both lay be-
fore him in a swoon. As soon as he had brought the horses
into a trot, he slackened the reins, for, as Jack wisely argued,
they will be certain to go home if I let them have their own
way. The horses, before they arrived at the town, turned
011, and stopped at a large country house. That he might
not frighten the people, Jack had put on his cloak, and taken
0E his mask and head-piece, which he had laid beside him

on the box. At the sound of the carriage-wheels the servants
came out, when J ack, in few words, told them what had hap-
pened. Some of the servants ran in, and a young lady made
her appearance, while the others were helping the old lady
out of the carriage, who had recovered her senses, but had
been so much frightened that she had remained in the pos-
ture in which Jack had put her.
As soon as she was out, Jack descended from the coach-
box and entered the house. He stated to the young lady what
had taken place, and how opportunely he had frightened
away the robbers, just as they were about to murder her
relation; and also suggested the propriety of sending after
the servants who had fallen in the attack; which was im-
mediately done by a strong and well-armed party collected
for the occasion. Jack having made his speech, made a very
polite bow and took his leave, stating that he was an English
ofﬁcer, belonging to a frigate in the harbour. He knew his
way back, and in half an hour was again at the inn, and
found his comrades. Jack thought it advisable to keep his
own secret, and therefore merely said, that he had taken a
long walk in the country; and soon afterwards went to bed.
The next morning our hero, who was always a man of his
word, packed up his portmanteau, and paid his bill. He had
just completed this heavy operation, when somebody wanted
to speak to him, and a sort of half-clerical, half-legal sort of
looking gentleman was introduced, who, with a starched face
and prim air, said that he came to request in writing the
name of the ofﬁcer who was dressed as a devil, in the mas-
querade of the night before.
Jack looked at his interrogator, and thought of the priests
and the inquisition. “No, no,” thought he, “that won’t do;
a name I must give, but it shall be one that you dare not
meddle with. A midshipman you might get hold of, but it’s
more than the whole island dare to touch a post-captain of
one of His Majesty’s frigates.” So Jack took the paper and
wrote Captain Hemy Wilson, of His Maj esty’s ship Aurora.

The prim man made a prim bow, folded up the paper, and
left the room.
Jack threw the waiter half a doubloon, lighted his cigar,
and went on board.
CHAPTER XXV.
In which the old Proverb is illustrated, “That you must not count your
Chickens before they are hatched."
Tun ﬁrst-lieutenant of the Aurora was a very good ofﬁcer
in many respects, but, as a midshipman, he had contracted
the habit of putting his hands in his pockets, and could never
keep them out, even when the ship was in a gale of wind;
and hands are of some use in a heavy lurch. He had more
than once received serious injury from falling on these
occasions, but habit was too powerful; and, although he had
once broken his leg by falling down the hatchway, and had
moreover a large scar on his forehead, received from being
thrown to leeward against one of the guns, he still continued
the practice; indeed, it was said that once when it was ne-
cessary for him to go aloft, he had actually taken the two ﬁrst
rounds of the J acob’s ladder without withdrawing them, until,
losing his balance, he discovered that it was not quite so easy
to go aloft with his hands in his pockets. In fact, there was
no getting up his hands, even when all hands were turned up.
He had another peculiarity, which was, that he had taken a
peculiar fancy to a quack medicine, called Enouy’s Universal
Medicine for all Mankind; and Mr. Pottyfar was convinced
in hisown mind that the label was no libel, except from the
greatness of its truth. In his opinion, it cured everything,
and he spent one of his quarterly bills every year in bottles
of this stuif; which he not only took himself everytime he
was unwell, but occasionally when quite well, to prevent his
falling sick. He recommended it to everybody in the ship,
and nothing pleased him so much as to give a dose of it to
every one who could be persuaded to take it. The ofﬁcers

laughed at him, but it was generally behind his back, for
he became very angry if contradicted upon this one point,
upon which he certainly might be considered to be a little
cracked. He was indefatigable in making proselytes to his
creed, and expatiated upon the virtues of the medicine for an
hour running, proving the truth of his assertions by a pam-
phlet, which, with his hands, he always carried in his
trousers’ pocket.
Jack reported himself when he came on board, and Mr.
Pottyfar, who was on the quarter-deck at the time, expressed
a hope that Mr. Easy,would take his share of the duty, now
that he had had such a spell on shore; to which Jack very
graciously acceded, and then went down below, where he
found Gascoigne and his new messmates, with most of whom
he was already acquainted.
“Well, Easy ,” said Gascoigne, “have you had enough
of the shore?”
“Quite,” replied Jack, recollecting that, after the events
of the night before, he was just as well on board; “I don’t
intend to ask for any more leave.”
“Perhaps it’s quite as well, for Mr. Pottyfar is not very
liberal on that score, I can tell you; there is but one way of
getting leave from him.”
“Indeed! ” replied Jack; “and what is that?”
“ You must pretend that you are not well, take some of
his quack medicine, and then he will allow you a run on
shore to work it off.”
“Oh! that’s it, is it? well then, as soon as we anchor in
Valette, I’ll go through a regular course, but not till then.”
“It ought to suit you, Jack; it’s an equality medicine;
cures one disorder just as well as the other.”
“Or kills—which levels all the patients. You’re right,
Gascoigne, I must patronise that stuff—for more reasons
than one. Who was that person on deck in mufti?”
“The mufti, Jack; in other words, the chaplain of the
ship; but he’s a prime sailor, nevertheless.”
“ llow’s fhat?”

“Why, he was brought up on the quarter-deck, served
his time, was acting-lieutenant for two years, and then, some-
how or another, he bore up for the churc .”
“Indeed — what were his reasons?”
“ No one knows — but they say he has been unhappy ever
since.”
“Why so ? ”
“Because he did a very foolish thing, which cannot now
be remedied. He supposed at the time that he would make
a good parson , and now that he has long got over his ﬁt, he
ﬁnds himself wholly unﬁt for it—he is still the ofﬁcer in
heart, and is always struggling with his natural bent, which
is very contrary to what a parson should feel.”
“Why don’t they allow parsons to be broke by a court-
martial, and turned out of the service, or to resign their com-
missions , like other people ? ”
“It won’t do, Jack —they serve heaven— there’s a dif-
ference between that and serving His Majesty.”
“Well, I don’t understand these things. When do we
sail?”
“The day after to-morrow.”
“To join the ﬂeet off Toulon?”
“Yes; but I suppose we shall be driven on the Spanish
coast going there. I never knew a man-of-war that was not.”
“No; wind always blows from the south, going up the
Mediterranean.”
“Perhaps you’ll take another prize, Jack — mind you
don’t go away without the articles of war.”
“I won’t go away without Mesty, if I can help it. 0 dear,
how abominable a midshipman’s berth is after a long run on
shore! I positively must go on deck and look at the shore , if
I can do nothing else.”
“Why, ten minutes ago you had had enough of it?”
“Yes, but ten minutes here has made me feel quite sick.
I shall go to the ﬁrst-lieutenant for a dose.”
d “”1 say, Easy, we must both be physicked on the same
ay.

“To be sure; but stop till we get to- Malta.”
Jack went on deck, made acquaintance with the chaplain
and some of the officers whom he had not known, then climbed
up into the maintop, where he took a seat on the armolest,
and, as he looked at the shore, thought over the events that
had passed, until Agnes came to his memory, and he thought
only of her. When a mid is in love, he always goes aloft to
think of the object of his affection; why, I don’t know, ex-
cept that his reverie is not so likely to be disturbed by an
order from a superior ofﬁcer.
The Aurora sailed on the second day, and, with a ﬁne
breeze, stood across, making as much northing as easting;
the consequence was, that one ﬁne morning they saw the
Spanish coast before they saw the Toulon ﬂeet. Mr. Pottyfar
took his hands out of his pockets, because he could not
examine the coast through a telescope without so doing; but
this, it is said, was the ﬁrst time that he had done so on the
quarter-deck from the day that the ship had sailed from Port
Mahon. Captain Wilson was also occupied with his telescope,
so were many of the ofﬁcers and midshipmen, and the men
at the mast-heads used their eyes, but there was nothing but
a few small ﬁshing-boats to be seen. So they all went down
to breakfast, as the ship was hove-to close in with the land.
“What will Easy bet,” said one of the midshipmen, “that
we don’t see a prize to-day?”
“I will not bet that we do not see a vessel— but I’ll bet
you what you please , that we do not take one before twelve
o’clock at night.”
“No, no, that won’t do — just let the tea-pot travel over
this way, for it’s my forenoon watch.”
“It’s a ﬁne morning,” observed one of the mates, of the
name of Martin; “but I’ve a notion it won’t be a ﬁne evening.”
“ Why not?” inquired another.
“I’ve now been eight years in the Mediterranean, and
know something about the weather. There’s a watery sky,
and the wind is very steady. If we are not under double-
reefed topsails to-night, say I’m no conjuror.”

“That you will be, all the same, if we are under bare
poles,” said another.
“You’re devilish free with your tongue, my youngster. —
Easy, pull his ears for me.”
“Pull them easy, Jack, then,” said the boy, laughing.
“All hands make sail!” now resounded at the hatchways.
“There they are, depend upon it,” cried Gascoigne, catch -
ing up his hat and bolting out of the berth, followed by all
the others except Martin, who had just been relieved, and
thought that his presence in the waist might be dispensed
with for the short time, at least, which it took him to swallow
a cup of tea.
It was very true; a galliot and four latteen vessels had
just made their appearance round the easternmost point, and,
, as soon as they observed the frigate, had hauled their wind.
In a minute the Aurora was under a press of canvas, and the
telescopes were all directed to the vessels.
“All deeply laden, sir,” observed Mr. Hawkins, the chap
lain; “how the topsail of the galliot is scored!”
“They have a fresh breeze just now,” observed Captain
Wilson to the ﬁrst-lieutenant. ,
“Yes, sir, and it’s coming down fast.”
“Hands by the royal halyards , there.”
The Aurora careened with the canvas to the rapidly-
increasing breeze.
“Top-gallant sheet and halyards.”
“Luff you may, quarter-master; luff, I tell you. A small
pull of that weather maintop-gallant brace — that will do,”
said the master.
“Top-men aloft there; — stand by to clew up the royals
— and, Captain Wilson, shall we take them in? — I’m afraid
of that pole — it bends now like a coach-whip,” said Mr.
Pottyfar, looking up aloft, with his hands in both pockets.
“In royals — lower away."
“They are going about, sir,” said the second-lieutenant,
Mr. Haswell.
“Look out,” observed the chaplain, “it’s coming.”

Again the breeze increases, and the frigate was borne
down.
“Hands reef topsails in stays, Mr. Pottyfar.”
“Ay, ay, sir — ’bout ship.”
The helm was put down and the topsails lowered and
reefed in stays.
“Very well, my lads, very well indeed,” said Captain
Wilson.
Again the topsails were hoisted and top-gallant sheets
home. It was a strong breeze, although the water was
smooth, and the Aurora dashed through at the rate of eight
miles an hour, with her weather leeches lifting.
“Didn’t I tell you so?” said Martin to his messmates on
the gangway; “but there’s more yet, my boys.”
“We must take the top-gallant sails off her,” said Captain
Wilson, looking aloft — for the frigate now careened to her
bearings, and the wind was increasing and squally. “Try
them a little longer;” but another squall came suddenly —
the halyards were lowered, and the sails clewed up and furled.
In the meantime the frigate had rapidly gained upon the
vessels, which still carried on every stich of canvas, making
short tacks in-shore. The Aurora was again put about with
her head towards them, and they were not two points on her
weather-bow. The sky, which had been clear in the morning,
was now overcast, the sun was obscured with opaque white
clouds, and the sea was rising fast. Another ten minutes, and
then they were under double-reefed topsails and the squalls
were accompanied with heavy rain. The frigate now dashed
through the waves, foaming in her course, and straining under
the press of sail. The horizon was so thick that the vessels
ahead were no longer to be seen.
“We shall have it, I expect,” said Captain Wilson.
“Didn’t I say so?” observed Martin to Gascoigne. “We
take no prizes this day, depend upon it.”
“We must have another hand to the wheel, sir, if you
please,” said the quarter-master, who was assisting the helme-
man .

264 MR. MIDSHIPMAN msv.
Mr. Pottyfar, with his hands concealed as usual, stood by
the capstern. “I fear, sir, we cannot carry the mainsail much
longer.”
“No,” observed the chaplain, “I was thinking so.”
“Captain Wilson, if you please, we are very close in,”
said the master; “don’t you think we had better go about?”
“Yes, Mr. Jones. — Hands about ship — and — yes, by
heavens we must! — up mainsail.”
The mainsail was taken off, and the frigate appeared to
be immediately relieved. She no longer jerked and plunged
as before.
“We’re very near the land, CaptainWilson; thick as it is,
I think I can make out the loom of it — shall we wear round,
sir?” continued the master.
“Yes, — hands wear ship — put the helm up.”
It was but just in time, for, as the frigate ﬂew round, de-
scribing a circle, as she payed ofl? before the wind, they could
perceive the breakers lashing the precipitous coast-, not two
cables’ length from them.
“I had no idea we were so near,” observed the captain,
compressing his lips — “can they see anything of those
vessels?”
“I have not seen them this quarter of an hour, sir,” replied
the signal-man, protecting his glass from the rain under his
jacket.
“How’s her head now, quarter-master?”
“South south-east, sir.”
The sky now assumed a different appearance — the white
clouds had been exchanged for others dark and murky, the
wind roared at intervals, and the rain came down in torrents.
Captain Wilson went down into the cabin to examine the
barometer.
“The barometer has risen,” said he on his return on deck.
“Is the wind steady?”
“No sir, she’s up and oﬂ' three points.”
“This will end in a south-wester.”


## p. 265 (#273) ############################################

MR. MIDSIIIPMAN EnSY. 265
The wet and heavy sails now ﬂappcd from the shifting of
the wind.
“Up with the helm, quarter-master.”
“Up it is — she’s off to south-by-west.”
The wind lulled, the rain came down in a deluge — for a
minute it was quite calm, and the frigate was on an even
keel.
“Man the braces. We shall be taken aback, directly,
depend upon it.”
The braces were hardly stretched along before this was
the case. The wind ﬂew round to the south-west with aloud
roar, and it was fortunate that they were prepared — the
yards were braced round, and the master asked the captain,
what course they were to steer.
“We must give it up,” observed Captain Wilson, holding
on by the belaying pin. “Shape our course for Cape Sicie,
Mr. Jones.”
And the Aurora ﬂew before the gale, under her foresail
and topsails close reefed. The weather was now so thick
that nothing could be observed twenty yards from the vessel;
the thunder pealed, and the lightning darted in every direc-
tion over the dark expanse. The watch was called as soon
as the sails were trimmed, and all who could went below, wet,
uncomfortable, and disappointed.
“What an old Jonah you are, Martin ," said Gascoigne.
“Yes, I am,” replied he; “but we have the worst to come
yet, in my opinion. I recollect, not two hundred miles from
where we are now, we had just such a gale in the Favourite,
and we as nearly went down, when ——-” _
At this moment a tremendous noise was heard above, a
shock was felt throughout the whole ship, which trembled
fore and aft as if it was about to fall into pieces; loud shrieks
were followed by plaintive cries, the lower deck was ﬁlled
with smoke, and the frigate was down on her beam ends.
Without exchanging a word, the whole of the occupants of the
berth ﬂew out, and were up the hatchway, not knowing what

266 MR. MIDSHlP.\lAN rmsv.
to think, but convinced that some dreadful accident had taken
place.
On their gaining the deck it was at once explained; the
foremast of the frigate had been struck by lightning, had
been riven into several pieces, and had fallen over the lar-
board bow, carrying with it the main topmast and jib-boom.
The jagged stump of the foremast was in ﬂames, and burnt
brightly, notwithstanding the rain fell in torrents. The ship,
as soon as the foremast and main topmast had gone over-
board, broached-to furiously, throwing the men over the
wheel and dashing them senseless against the carronades; the
forecastle, the forepart of the main deck, and even the lower
deck, were spread with men, either killed or seriously
wounded, or insensible from the electric shock. The frigate
was on her beam ends, and the sea broke furiously over her;
all was dark as pitch, except the light from the blazing stump
of the foremast, appearing like a torch, held up by the wild
demons of the storm, or when occasionally the gleaming
lightning cast a momentary glare, threatening every moment
to repeat its attack upon the vessel, while the deafening
thunder burst almost on their devoted heads. All was dismay
and confusion for a minute or two: at last Captain Wilson,
who had himself lost his sight for a short time, called for the
carpenter and axes — they climbed up, that is, two or three
of them, and he pointed to the mizenmast; the master was
also there, and he cut loose the axes for the seamen to use; in
a few minutes the mizenmast fell over the quarter, and the
helm being put hard up, the frigate payed off and slowly
righted. But the horror of the scene was not yet over. The
boatswain, who had been on the forecastle, had been led be-
low, for his vision was gone for ever. The men who lay
scattered about had been examined, and they were assisting
them down to the care of the surgeon, when the cry of
“Fire!” issued from the lower deck. The ship had taken
ﬁre at the coal-hole and carpenter’s store-room, and the smoke
that now ascended was intense.
“Call the drummer,” said Captain Wilson, “and let him

beat to quarters — all hands to their stations—let the pumps
be rigged and the buckets passed along. Mr. Martin, see that
the wounded men are taken down below. Where’s Mr. Has-
well? Mr. Pottyfar, station the men to pass the water on by
hand on the lower deck. 1 will go there myself. Mr. Jones,
take charge of the ship.”
Pottyfar, who actually had taken his hands out of his
pockets, hastened down tocomply with the captain’s orders
on the main deck, as Captain Wilson descended to the deck
below.
“I say, Jack, this is very different from this morning,”
observed Gascoigne.
“ Yes,” replied Jack, “so it is; but I say, Gascoigne,
what’s the best thing to do? — when the chimney’s on ﬁre on
shore, they put a wet blanket over it.”
“Yes,” replied Gascoigne; “but when the coal-hole’s on
ﬁre on board, they will not ﬁnd that sufﬁcient.”
“At all events, wet blankets must be a good thing, Ned,
so let us pull out the hammocks; cut the lanyards and get
some out — we can but offer them, you know, and if they do
no good, at least it will show our zeal.”
“Yes,Jack,and I thinkwhen theyturninagaimthose whose
blankets you take will agree with you, that zeal makes the
service very uncomfortable. However, I think you are
right.”
The two midshipmen collected three or four hands, and in
a very short time they had more blankets than they could
carry — there was no trouble in wetting them, for the main
deck was aﬁoat—and followed by the men they had collected,
Easy and Gascoigne went down with large bundles in their
arms to where Captain Wilson was giving directions to the
men.
“Excellent, Mr. Easy, excellent, Mr. Gascoigne!” said
Captain Wilson. “Come, my lads, throw them over now, and
stamp upon them well;” the men’s jackets and the captain’s
coat had already been sacriﬁced to the same object.
Easy called the other midshipmen, and they went up for

a further supply; but there was no occasion, the ﬁre had been
smothered: still the danger had been so great that the fore
magazine had been ﬂoated. During all this, which lasted
perhaps a quarter of an hour, the frigate had rolled gunwale
under, and many were the accidents which occurred. At last
all danger from ﬁre had ceased, and the men were ordered
to return to their quarters, when three ofﬁcers and forty-seven
men were found absent — seven of them were dead, most oi:
them were already under the care of the surgeon, but some
were still lying in the scuppers.
No one had been more active or more brave during this
time of danger, than Mr. Hawkins the chaplain. He was
everywhere, and when Captain Wilson went down to put out
the ﬁre he was there, encouraging the men and exerting him-
self most gallantly. He and Mesty came aft when all was
over, one just as black as the other. The chaplain sat down
and wrung his hands — “God forgive me!” said he, “God
forgive me ! ”
“Why so, sir?” said Easy, who stood near. “I am sure
you need not be ashamed of what you have done.”
“No, no, not ashamed of what I’ve done; but Mr. Easy —
I have sworn so, sworn such oaths at the men in haste — I,
the chaplain! God forgive me! — I meant nothing.” It was
very true that .Mr. Hawkins had sworn a great deal during
his exertions, but was at that time the quarter-deck ofﬁcer
and not the chaplain; the example to the men and his gal-
lantry had been most serviceable.
“Indeed, sir,” said Easy, who saw the chaplain was in
great tribulation, and hoped to pacify him, “I was certainly
not there all the time, but I only heard you say, ‘God bless
you, my men! be smart,’ and so on; surely, that is not
swearing.”
“Was it that I said, Mr. Easy, are you sure? I really
had an idea that I had d—d them all in heaps, as some of
them deserved — no no, not deserved. Did I really bless
them — nothing but bless them?”
“Yes, sir,” said Mesty, who perceived what Jack wanted;


## p. 269 (#277) ############################################

MR. mmsmrmnn nssv. 269
“it was nothing, I assure you, but ‘God bless you, Captain
Wilson !—Bless your heart my good men !—Bless the king!’
and so on. You do nothing but shower down blessing and
wet blanket.”
“I told you so,” said Jack.
“Well, Mr. Easy, you’ve made me very happy,” replied ‘
the chaplain; “I was afraid it was otherwise.”
So indeed it was, for'the chaplain had sworn like a boat-
swain; but as Jack and Mesty had turned all his curses into
blessings, the poor man gave himself absolution, and shaking
hands with Jack, hoped he would come down into the gun-
room and take a glass of grog; nor did he forget Mesty, who
received a good allowance at the gun-room door, to which
Jack gladly consented, as the rum in the middy’s berth had
all been exhausted after the rainy morning; but Jack was in~
terrupted in his third glass, by somebody telling him the cap-
tain wanted to speak with Mr. Hawkins and with him.
Jack went up, and found the captain on the quarter-deck
with the ofﬁcers.
“Mr. Easy,” said Captain Wilson, “I have sent for you,
Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Gascoigne, to thank you on the quarter-
deck, for your exertions and presence of mind on this trying
occasion.” Mr. Hawkins made a bow. Gascoigne said no-
thing, but he thought of having extra leave when they arrived
at Malta. Jack felt inclined to make a speech, and began
something about when there was danger that it levelled every
one to an equality even on board of a man-of-war.
“By no means, Mr. Easy,” replied Captain Wilson; “it
does the very contrary; for it proves which is the best man,
and those who are the best raise themselves at once above the
rest.”
Jack was very much inclined to argue the point, but he
took the compliment and held his tongue, which was the
wisest thing he could have done; so he made his bow, and
was about to go down into the midshipmen’s berth when the
frigate was pooped by a tremendous sea, which washed all
those who did not hold on down into the waist. Jack was

among the number, and naturally catching at the ﬁrst object
which touched him, he caught hold of the chaplain by the
leg, who commenced swearing most terribly: but before he
could ﬁnish the oath, the water which had burst into the
cabin through the windows — for the dead lights, in the con-
fusion, had not yet been shipped — burst out the cross bulk-
heads, sweeping like a torrent the marine, the cabin-door,
and everything else in its force, and ﬂoating Jack and the
chaplain with sevqal others down the main hatchway on to
the lower deck.. The lower deck being also full of water,
men and chests were rolling and tossing about, and Jack was
sometimes in company with the chaplain, and at other times
separated; at last they both recovered their legs, and gained
the midshipmen’s berth, which, although aﬂoat, was still a
haven of security. Mr. Hawkins spluttered and spit, and so
did Jack, until he began to laugh.
“This is very trying, Mr. Easy,” said the chaplain; “very
trying indeed to the temper. I hope I have not sworn — I
hope not.” Q '
“Not a word,” said Jack — “I was close to you all the
time — you only said, ‘God preserve us!’ ”
“Only that? I was afraid that I said ‘God d—n it!’ ”
“Quite a mistake, Mr. Hawkins. Let’s go into the gun-
room, and try to wash this salt water out of our mouths, and
then I will tell you all you said, as far as I could hear it,
word for word.”
So Jack by this means got another glass of grog, which
was very acceptable in his wet condition, and made himself
very comfortable, while those on deck were putting on the
dead lights, and very busy setting the goose-wings of the
mainsail, to prevent the frigate from being pooped a second
time.

CHAPTER XXVI.
In which our Hero becomes excessively unwell, and agrees to go through
a Course of Medicine.
THE hammocks were not piped down that night: some
were taken indiscriminately for the wounded, but the rest
remained in the nettings, for all hands were busy preparing
jury masts and jury rigging, and Mr. Pottyfar was so well
employed that for twelve hours his hands were not in his
pockets. It was indeed a dreadful night: the waves were
mountains high, and chased the frigate in their fury, cresting,
breaking, and roaring at her taffrail. But she ﬂew before
them with the wings of the wind; four men at the helm,
assisted by others as the relieving tackles below. J ack,having
been thanked on and washed off the quarter-deck, thought
that he had done quite enough: he was as deep as he could
swim before he had satisﬁed all the scruples of the chaplain,
and, stowing himself away oh one of the lockers of the mid-
shipmen’s berth, was soon fast asleep, notwithstanding that
the frigate rolled grmwale under. Gascoigne had done much
better; he had taken down a hammock, as he said, for a poor
wounded man, hung it up and turned in himself. The conse-
quence was, that the next morning the surgeon, who saw him
lying in the hammock, had put him down in the report, but
as Gascoigne had got up as well as ever, he laughed and
scratched his name out of the list of wounded.
Before morning the ship had been pumped out dry, and
all below made as secure and safe as circumstances would
permit; but the gale still continued its violence, and there
was anything but comfort on board.
“I say, Martin, you ought to be thrown overboard!” said
Gaseoigne; “all this comes from your croaking — you’re a

“I wish I had been any one’s chicken,” replied Martin;
“but the devil a thing to nestle under have I had since I can
well remember-”

“What a bore to have no galley ﬁre lighted,” said one of
the youngsters; “no tea, and not allowed any grog.”
“The gale will last three days,” replied Martin, “and by
that time we shall not be far from the admiral; it won’t blow
home there.”
. “Well, then, we shall be ordered in directly, and I shall
go on shore to-morrow,” replied Easy.
“Yes, if you’re ill,” replied Gascoigne.
“Never fear I shall be sick enough. We shall be there
at least six weeks, and then we’ll forget all this.”
“Yes,” replied Martin, “we may forget it, but will the
poor fellows whose limbs are shrivelled forget it? and will
poor Miles, the boatswain, who is blind for ever?”
“Very true, Martin; we are thinking about ourselves, not
thankful for our escape, and not feeling for others,” replied
Gascoigne. -
“ Give us your hand, Ned,” said Jack Easy. “And, Mar-
tin, we ought to thank you for telling us the truth — we are
a selﬁsh set of fellows.”
“Still we took our share with the others,” replied one of
the midshipmen.
“That’s more reason for us to be grateful and to pity
them,” replied J ack; “suppose you had lost your arm or
your eyesight — we should have pitied you; so now pity
others.”
“Well, so I do, now I think of it.”
“Think oftener, youngster,” observed Martin, going on
deck.
What a change from the morning of the day before; but
twenty-four hours had passed away, and the sea had been
smooth; the frigate dashed through the blue water, proud in
all her canvas, graceful as a swan. Since that there had been
ﬁre, tempest, lightning, disaster, danger, and death; her
masts were tossed about on the snowy waves, hundreds of
miles away from her, and she—a wreck—was rolling heavily,
groaning and complaining in every timber, as she urged her
impetuous race with the furious running sea.

How wrong are those on shore who assert that sailors are
not religious! —how is it possible, supposing them to be
possessed of feeling, to be otherwise? On shore, where you
have nothing but the change of seasons, each in his own
peculiar beauty — nothing but the blessings of the earth, its
fruits, its ﬂowers — nothing but the bounty, the comforts,
the luxuries which have been invented, where you can rise in
the morning in peace, and lay down your head at night in
security — God may be neglected and forgotten for a long
time; but at sea, when each gale is a warning, each disaster
acts as a check, each escape as a homily upon the forbearance
of Providence, that man must be indeed brutalised who does
not feel that God is there. On shore we seldom view Him
but in all his beauty and kindness; but at sea we are as often
reminded how terrible He is in his wrath. Can it be sup-
posed that the occurrences of the last twenty-four hours were
lost upon the minds of any one man in that ship? No, no.
In their courage and activity they might appear reckless,
but in their hearts they acknowledged and bowed unto their
God.
Before the day was over, a jury-foremast had been got
up, and sail having been put upon it, the ship was steered
with greater ease and safety—the main brace had been
spliced to cheer up the exhausted crew, and the hammocks
were piped down.
As Gascoigne had observed, some of the men were not
very much pleased to ﬁnd that they were minus their blankets,
but Captain Wilson ordered their losses to be supplied by
the purser and expended by the master: this quite altered
the case, as they obtained new blankets in most cases for old
ones, but still it was impossible to light the galley ﬁre, and
the men sat on their chests and nibbled biscuit. By twelve
o’clock that night the gale broke, and more sail was neces- =
sarily put on the scudding vessel, for the sea still ran fast and
mountains high. At daylight the sun burst out and shone
brightly on them, the sea went gradually down, the ﬁre was
lighted, and Mr. Pottyfar, whose hands were again in his

pockets, at twelve o’clock gave the welcome order to pipe to
dinner. As soon as the men had eaten their dinner, the
frigate was once more brought to the wind, her jury-mast for-
ward improved upon, and more sail made upon it. The next
morning there was nothing of the gale left except the dire
effects which it had produced, the black and riven stump of
the foremast still holding up a terriﬁc warning of the power
and fury of the elements.
Three days more, and the Aurora joined the Toulon ﬂeet.
When she was ﬁrst seen it was imagined by those on board
of the other ships that she had been in action, but they soon
learnt that the conﬂict had been against more direful weapons
than any yet invented by mortal hands. Captain Wilson
waited upon the admiral, and of course received immediate
orders to repair to port and reﬁt. In a few hours the Aurora
had shaped her course for Malta, and by sunset the Toulon
ﬂeet were no longer in sight.
“By the holy poker, Massa Easy, but that terrible sort of
gale the other day anyhow — I tink one time, we all go to
Davy Joney’s lacker.”
“Very true, Mesty; I hope never to meet with such an-
other.”
“Den, Massa Easy, why you go to sea? when man ab no
money, noting to eat, den he go to sea, but everybody say you
ab plenty money — why you come to sea?”
“I’m sure I don’t know,” replied Jack, thoughtfully; “I
came to sea on account of equality and the rights of man.”
“Eh, Massa Easy, you come to wrong place anyhow; now
I tink a good deal lately, and by all de power, I tink equality
all stuff.”
“All stud‘, Mesty, why? You used to think otherwise.”
“Yes, Massa Easy, but den I boil dc kettle for all young
gentleman. N ow dat I ship’s corporal and hab cane, I tink so
no longer.”
Jack made no reply, but he thought the more. The reader
must have perceived that Jack’s notions of equality were
rapidly disappearing; he defended them more from habit,

and perhaps a wilfulness which would not allow him to ac-
knowledge himself wrong — to which may be added his love
of argument. Already he had accustomed himself to obe-
dience of his superiors, and, notwithstanding his arguments, he
would admit of no resistance from those below him; not that
it was hardly ever attempted, for Jack was anything but a
tyrant and was much beloved by all in the ship. Every day
brought its lesson, and Captain Wilson was now satisﬁed that
Jack had been almost cured of the effects of his father’s ridi-
culous philosophy.
After a few minutes, Mesty tapped his cane on the funnel
and recommenced.
“Then why you stay at sea, Massa Easy?”
“I don’t know, Mesty, I don’t dislike it.”
“But, Massa Easy, why you stay in midshipman berth, eat
hard biscuit, salt pig, salt horse, when you can go shore and
live like gentleman? Dat very foolish! Why not be your own
master? By all power! suppose I had money, catch me board
ship. Little sea very good, Massa Easy, open one’s eyes;
but tink of the lightning t’other night. Poor massa boatswain
he shut um eyes for ebber! ”
“Very true, Mesty.”
“Me hope you tink of this, sar, and when you go on shore
you take Mesty wid you. He sarve you well, Massa Easy,
long as he live, by the holy St. Patrick. And den, Massa
Easy you marry wife — hab pickaninny — lib like gentleman.
You tink of this, Massa Easy.”
The mention of the word marriage turned the thoughts of
our hero to his Agnes, and he made no reply. Mesty walked
away leaving our hero in deep thought.
This conversation had morveﬁect upon Jack than would
have been imagined, and he very often found he was putting
to himself the question of Mesty—“ Why do you stay at sea?”
He had not entered the service with any particular view, ex-
cept to ﬁnd equality, and he couldnot but acknowledge to him-
self that, as Mesty observed, he had come to the wrong place.
He had never even thought of staying to serve his time, nor

had he looked forward to promotion, and one day commanding
a ship. He had only cared for the present, without indulg-
ing in a future anticipation of any reward, except in a union
with Agnes. Mesty’s observations occasioned Jack to reﬂect
upon the futu.re for the ﬁrst time in his life; and he was al-
ways perplexed when he put the question of Mesty, and tried
to answer to himself as to what were his intentions in remain-
ing in the service.
Nevertheless Jack did his duty very much to the satisfac-
tion of Mr. Pottyfar; and after a tedious passage, from haf-
ﬂing and light winds, the Aurora arrived at Malta. Our hero
had had some conversation with his friend Gascoigne, in which
he canvassed his future plans; all of which, however, ended
in one settled point, which was that he was to marry Agnes.
As for the rest, Gascoigne was of opinion that Jack ought to
follow up the service and become a captain. But there was
plenty of time to think about that, as he observed; new all
they had to consider was how to get on shore, for the reﬁt-
ting of the ship was an excuse for detaining them on board,
which they knew Mr. Pottyfar would avail himself of. Jack
dined in the gun-room on the day of their arrival, and he re-
solved that he would ask that very evening. Captain Wilson
was already on shore at the governor’s. Now, there had been
a little diiference of opinion between Mr. Pottyfar and Mr.
Hawkins, the chaplain, on a point of seamanship, and most
of the ofﬁcers sided with the chaplain, who, as we have be-
fore observed, was a ﬁrst-rate seaman. It had ended in high
words, for Mr. Hawkins had forgotten himself so far as to
tell the ﬁrst-lieutenant that he had a great deal to learn, not
having even got over the midshipman’s trick of keeping his
hands in his pockets; and Mr. Pottyfar had replied that it
was very well for him as chaplain to insult others, knowing-
that his cassock protected him. This was a bitter reply to
Mr. Hawkins, who at the very time that the insinuation made
his blood boil, was also reminded that his profession forbade
a retort. He rushed into his cabin, poor fellow, having no
other method left, vented his indignation in tears, and then

MR. mnsmrmm nssv.‘ 277
consoled himself by degrees with prayer. In the meantime
Mr. Pottyfar had gone on deck, wroth with Hawkins and
with his messmates, as well as displeased with himself. He
was, indeed, in a humour to be pleased with nobody, and
in a most unfortunate humour to be asked leave by a midship-
man. Nevertheless, Jack politely took off his hat, and re-
quested leave to go on shore and see his friend the governor.
Upon which Mr. Pottyfar turned round to him, with his feet
spread wide open, and, thrusting his hands to the very bottom
of his pockets, as if in determination, said:
“Mr. Easy, you know the state of the ship. VVe have
everything to do—new masts, new rigging, everything almost
to reﬁt— and yet you ask to go on shore! Now, sir, you may
take this answer for yourself, and all the other midshipmen
in the ship, that not one soul of you puts his foot on shore
until we are again all a-taunto.”
“Allow me to observe, sir,” said our-"hero, “that it is very
true that all our services may be required when the duty com-
mences, but this being Saturday night, and to-morrow Sun-
day, the frigate will not be even moved till Monday morning;
and as the work cannot begin before that, I trust you will
permit leave until that time.”
“ My opinion is different, sir,” replied the ﬁr-st~lieutenant.
“Perhaps, sir, you will allow me to argue the point,” re-
plied Jack.
“No, sir, I never allow argument; walk over to the other
side of the deck, if you please.”
“O certainly, sir,” said Jack, “if you wish it.”
Jack’s ﬁrst idea was to go on shore without leave, but
from this he was persuaded by Gaseoigne, who told him that
it would displease Captain Wilson, and that old Tom, the
governor, would not receive him. Jack agreed to this, and
then, after a ﬂourish about the rights of man, tyranny, op-
pression, and so forth, he walked forward to the forecastle,
where he found his friend Mesty, who had heard all that
had passed, and who insidiously said to him in a low tone —
“Why you stay at sea, Massa Easy?"


## p. 278 (#286) ############################################

278 MR. MIDSHIPMAN nssv.
“Why, indeed,” thought Jack, boiling with indignation;
“to be cooped up here at the will of another? I am a fool —
Mesty is right — I’ll ask for my discharge to-morrow.” Jack
went down below, and told Gascoigne what he had determined
to do.
“You’ll do no such thing, Jack,” replied Gascoigne; “ de-
pend upon it, you’ll have plenty of leave in a day or two.
Pottyfar was in a pet with the chaplain, who was too much
for him. Captain Wilson will be on board by nine o’clock.”
Nevertheless, Jack walked his ﬁrst watchin the “magni-
ﬁcents,” as all middies do when they cannot go on shore, and
turned in at twelve o’clock with the resolution of sticking to
his purpose, and quitting His Majesty’s service; ‘in fact, of
presenting His Majesty with his between two and three years
time, served as midshipman, all free, gratis, and for nothing, ex-
cept his provisions and his pay, which some captains are bold
enough to assert that they not only are not worth, but not
even the salt that accompanies it; forgetting that they were
once midshipmen themselves, and at the periodwere, of course,
of about the same value.
The next morning Captain Wilson came oif; the ship’s
company were mustered, the service read by Mr. Hawkins,
and Jack, as soon as all the ofﬁcial duties were over, was
about to go up to the captain, when the captain said to him, ——-
“ Mr. Easy, the governor desired me to bring you on shore
to dine with him, and he has a bed at your service.”
Jack touched his hat and_ran down below, to make his few
preparations.
By the time that Mesty, who had taken charge of his chest,
&c., had put his necessaries in the boat, Jack had almost
made up his mind that His Majesty should notjbe deprived
yet awhile of so valuable an ofﬁcer. Jack returned on deck,
and found that the captain was not yet ready; he went up to
Mr. Pottyfar, and told him that the captain had ordered him
to go on shore with him; and Mr. Pottyfar, who had quite
got over his spleen, said, —
f‘ Very well, Mr. Easy —I wish you a great deal of pleasure.”

“This is very different from yesterday,” thought Jack;
“ suppose I try the medicine?”
“I am not very well, Mr. Pottyfar, and those pills of the
doctor’s don’t agree with me — I always am ill if I am long
without air and exercise.”
“Very true,” said the ﬁrst-lieutenant, “people require air
and exercise. I’ve no opinion of the doctor’s remedies; the
only thing that is worth a farthing is the universal medi-
cine.”
“I should so long to try it, sir,” replied Jack; “I read the
book one day, and it said that if you took it daily for a fort-
night or three weeks , and with plenty of air and exercise, it
would do wonders.”
“And it’s very true,” replied Mr. Pottyfar; “and if you’d
like to try it you shall — I have plenty— shall I give you a
dose now?”
“If you please, sir,” replied Jack; “and tell me how often
I am to take it, for my head aches all day.”
Mr. Pottyfar took Jack down, and putting into his hand
three or four bottles of the preparation, told him that he was
to take thirty drops at night, when he went to bed, not to
drink more than two glasses of wine, and to avoid the heat of
the sun.
“But, sir,” replied Jack, who had put the bottles in his
pocket, “I am afraid that I cannot take it long; for as the
ship is ready for ﬁtting, I shall be exposed to the sun all
day.”
“Yes, if you were wanted, Mr. Easy; but we have plenty
here without you; and when you are unwell you cannot be
expected to work. Take care of your health; and I trust, in-
deed I am sure, that you will ﬁnd this medicine wonderfully
efﬁcaeious.”
“I will begin to-night, sir, if you please,” replied Jack,
“and I am very much obliged to you. I sleep at the governor’‘
— shall I come on board to-morrow morning?”
“No, no; take care of yourself, and get well; I shall be
glad to hear that you get better. Send me word how it acts.”

“I will, sir, send you word by the boat every day,” replied
Jack, delighted; “I am very much obliged to you, sir. Gas-
coigne and I were thinking of asking you, but did not like
to do so: he, poor fellow, suffers from headaches almost as
bad as I do, and the doctor’s pills are of no use to him.”
“He shall have some too, Mr. Easy; I thought he looked
pale. I’ll see to it this afternoon. Recollect, moderate exer-
cise, Mr. Easy, and avoid the sun at mid-day.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, “I’ll not forget;” and off went
Jack, delighted. He ordered Mesty to put up his whole port-
manteau instead of the small bundle he put into the boat,
and telling Gascoigne what a spoke he had put into his wheel,
was soon in the boat with the captain, and went on shore,
where he was cordially greeted by the governor.

“Want, Jack, my boy, have you any long story ready for
me?” inquired the governor.
“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, “I have one or two very good
ones.”
“Very well, we’ll hear them after dinner,” replied old
Tom. “In the meantime ﬁnd out your room and take pos-
session.”
“That must not be for very long, governor,” observed
Captain Wilson. “Mr. Easy must learn his duty, and there
is a good opportunity now.”
“If you please, sir,” replied Jack, “I’m on the sick
list.”
“Sick list,” said Captain Wilson; “ you were not in the
report that Mr. Wilson gave me this morning.”
“No, I’m on Mr. Pottyfar’s list, and I’m going through a
course of the universal medicine.”
“What’s all this, Jack, what’s all this? There’s some

r’
story here. Don’t be afraid of the captain — you’ve me ti:
back you,” said the governor.
Jack was not at all afraid of the captain, so he told him
how the ﬁrst-lieutenant had refused him leave the evening
before, and how he had now given him permission to remain,
and try the universal medicine, at which the governor laughed
heartily, nor could Captain Wilson refrain from joining.
“But, Mr. Easy,” replied the captain, after a pause, “if
Mr. Pottyfar will allow you to stay on shore , I cannot — you
have your duty to learn. You must be aware that now is
your time, and you must not lose opportunities that do not
occur every day. You must acknowledge the truth of what
I say.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, “I admit it all, provided I do
intend to follow the profession;” and so saying, our hero
bowed, and left the veranda where they had been talking.
This hint of Jack’s, thrown out by him, more with the
intention of preventing his being sent on board than with
any deﬁnite idea, was not lost upon either the captain or the
governor.
“Does he jib, then?” observed the governor
“ On the contrary, I never knew him more attentive, and
so entirely getting rid of his former notions. He has behaved
most nobly in the gale, and there has not been one complaint
against him — I never was more astonished — he must have
meantsomething.”
“I’ll tell you what he means, Wilson — that he does not
like to be sent on board, nothing more. He’s notto be cooped
up -—- you may lead him, but not drive him.”
“Yes, but the service will not admit of it. I never could
allow it — he must do his duty like the rest, and conform to
the rules.”
“Exactly, so he must; but look ye, Wilson, you must not
losehim: it’s all easily settled — appoint him your orderly
midshipman to and from the ship; that will be employment,
and he can always remain here at night. I will tell him that

I“have asked, as a favour, what I now do, and leave me to
ﬁnd out what he is thinking about.”
“It may be done that way, certainly,” replied Captain
Wilson, musing; “and you are more likely to get his inten-
tions from him than I am. I am afraid he has too great a
command of money ever to be fond of the ship; it is the ruin
of a junior ofﬁcer to be so lavishly supplied.”
“He’s a long way from ruin yet, VVilson — he’s a very ﬁne
fellow, even by your own acknowledgment. You humoured
him out of gratitude to his father, when he ﬁrst came into the
service; humour him a little new to keep him in it. Besides,
if your ﬁrst-lieutenant is such a fool with his universal medi-
cine, can you wonder at a midshipman taking advantage
of it?”
“No, but I ought not to allow him to do so with my eyes
open.”
“He has made it known to you upon honour, and you
ought not to take advantage of his conﬁdence: but still what
I proposed would, I think, he the best, for then he will be
at his duty in a way that will suit all parties. You, because
you employ him on service — the ﬁrst-lieutenant, because
Jack can take his medicine — and Jack, because he can dine
with me every day.”
“Well, I suppose it must be so,” replied Captain Wilson,
laughing; “but still, I trust, you will discover what is work-
ing in his mind to induce him to give me that answer,
governor.”
“Never fear, Jack shall confess, and lay his soul as bare
as that of a Catholic bigot before his padre.”
The party sat down to dinner, and what with the
governor s aide-de-camp and those invited, it was pretty
numerous. After the cloth had been removed, the governor
called upon Jack for his stories, whereupon, much to the
surprise of Captain Wilson, who had never heard one word
of it, for the admiral had not mentioned anything about it to
him during the short time the Aurora was with the ’I‘oulon
ﬂeet, our hero gave the governor and the company the nar-

rative of all that happened in the Eliza Ann transport — the \
loves of Captain Hogg and Miss Hicks — the adventures of
Gascoigne — and his plan, by which he baulked them all.
The governor was delighted, and Captain Wilson not a little
astonished.
“You prevented a very foolish thing, Mr. Easy, and be-
haved very well,” observed the captain, laughing again at
the idea; “but you never told me of all this.”
“No, sir,” replied Jack, “I have always reserved my
stories for the governor’s table, where I am sure to meet you,
and then telling once does for all.”
Jack received his appointment as orderly midshipman,
and everything went on well; for, of his own accord, he
stayed on board the . major part of the day to learn his duty,
which very much‘pleased the captain and Mr. Pottyfar. In
this Jack showed a great deal of good sense, and Captain
Wilson did not repent of- the indulgence he had shown him,
Jack’s health improved daily, much to Mr. Pottyfar’s satis-
faction, who imagined that he took the universal medicine
night and morning. Gascoigne also was a patient under the
ﬁrst-lieutenant’s hands, and often on shore with our hero,
who thought no more of quitting the service.
For seven weeks they had now remained in harbour, for
even the masts had to be made, when, one day, Captain
Wilson opened a letter he received at breakfast-time, and
having read it, laid it down with the greatest surprise depicted
in his countenance. “Good heavens! what can this mean?"
said he.
‘‘What’s the matter, Wilson?” said the governor.
“Just hear its contents, Sir Thomas.”
Captain Wilson then read in Spanish as follows: —
“Honourable Sir,
“It is my duty to advise you that the Honourable Lady
Sig'nora‘Alforgas de Guzman, now deceased, has, in her testa-
ment, bequeathed to you the sum of one thousand doubloons
in gold, as a testimony of your kind services on the night of

the 12th of August. If you will authorise any merchant here
to receive the money, it shall be paid forthwith, or remitted
in any way you please to appoint. May you live a thousand
years! “Your most obedient servant,
“Anrouzo Xannz.”
Jack heard the letter read, rose quietly, whistled low, as
if not attending to it, and then slipped out of the room, un-
perceived by the governor or Captain Wilson.
The fact was, that although Jack had longed to tell the
governor about his adventures after the masquerade, he did
not like yet awhile, until he was sure that there were no con-
sequences — because he had given the eaptain’s name instead
of his own. As soon as he heard the letter read, he at once
perceived that it had been the old lady, and not the priests,
who had made the inquiry, and that by giving Captain
Wilson’s name, he had obtained for him this ﬁne legacy.
Jack was delighted, but still puzzled, so he walked out of
the room to reﬂect a little.
“What can it mean?” said Captain Wilson. “1 never
rendered any services to any one on the 12th of August or
after it. It is some mistake — 12th of August — that was the
day of the grand masquerade.”
“A lucky one for you, at all events — for you know,
mistake or not, no one else can touch the legacy. It can only
be paid to you.”
“I never heard of anything taking place at the mas-
querade — I was there, but I left early, for I was not very
well. Mr. Easy,” said Captain Wilson, turning round; but
Jack was gone.
“Was he at the masquerade?” asked the governor.
“Yes, I know he was, for the ﬁrst-lieutenant told me that
he requested not to come on board till the next day.”
“Depend upon it,” replied the governor, striking his ﬁst
upon the table, “that J ack’s at the bottom of it.”
“I should not be surprised at his being at the bottom of
anything,” replied Captain Wilson, laughing.

“Leave it to me, Wilson; I’ll ﬁnd it out.”
After a little more conversation, Captain Wilson went on
board, leaving Jack on purpose that the governor might
pump him. But this Sir Thomas had no occasion to do, for
Jack had made up his mind to make the govemor his con-
ﬁdant, and he immediately told him the whole story. The
governor held his sides at our hero’s description, especially
at his ruse of giving the captain’s name instead of his own.
“ You’ll kill me, Jack, before you’ve done with me,” said
old Tom, at last; “but now what is to be done?”
Our hero now became grave; he pointed out to the
governor that he himself had plenty of money, and would
come into a large fortune, and that Captain Wilson was poor,
with a large family. All Jack wished the governor to manage
was, that Captain Wilson might consent to accept the legacy.
“Right, boy, right! you’re my own boy,” replied the
governor; “ but we must think of this, for Wilson is the very
soul of honour, and there may be some difﬁculty about it.
You have told nobody?”
“Not a soul but you, Sir Thomas.”
“It never will do to tell him all this, Jack, for he would
insist that the legacy belonged to you.”
“I have it, sir,” replied Jack. “When I was going into
the masquerade, I offered to hand this very old lady, who
was covered with diamonds, out of her carriage, and she was
so frightened at my dress of a devil, that she would have
fallen down had it not been for Captain Wilson, who sup-
ported her, and she was very thankful to him.”
“You are right, Jack,” replied the governor, after a short
pause; “that will, I think, do. I must tell him the story of
the friars, because I swore you had something to do with it
— but.I’ll tell him no more: leave it all to me.”
Captain Wilson returned in the afternoon, and found the
governor in the veranda.
“I have had some talk withyoung Easy,” said the governor,
“and he has told me a strange story about that night, which
he was afraid to tell to everybody.”

The governor then narrated the history of the friars and
the will.
“Well, but,” observed Captain Wilson, “the history of
that will afford no clue to the legacy.”
“No, it does not; but still, as I said, Jack had a hand in
this. He frightened the old lady as a devil, and you caught
her in your arms and saved her from falling, so he had a
hand in it, you see.”
“I do now remember that I did save a very dowager-like
old personage from falling at the sight of a devil, who, of
course, must have been our friend Easy.”
“Well, and that accounts for the whole of it.”
“A thousand doubloons for picking up an old lady!”
“Yes, why not? — have you not heard of a man having
a fortune left him for merely opening the pew door of a.
church, to an old gentleman?”
“Yes, but it appears so strange.”
“There’s nothing strange in this world, Wilson, nothing
at all — we may slave for years and get no reward, and do a
triﬂe out of politeness and become independent. In my
opinion, this mystery is unravelled. The old lady, for I
knew the family, must have died immensely rich: she knew
you in your full uniform, and she asked your name; a heavy
fall would have been to one so fat a most serious aﬂair; you
saved her, and she has rewarded you handsomely.”
“Well ,” replied Captain Wilson, “as I can give no other
explanation, I suppose yours is the correct one; but it’s
hardly fair to take a thousand doubloons from her relations
merely for an act of civility.”
“You really are quite ridiculous; the old lady owned half
Murcia, to my knowledge. It is no more to them than any
one leaving you a suit of mourningin an English legacy. I
wish you joy; it will help you with a large family, and in
justice to them you are bound to take it. Everybody does as
he pleases with his own money, -—- depend upon it, you saved
her from breaking her leg short off at the hip joint.”

“Upon that supposition I presume I must accept of the
legacy,” replied Captain Wilson, laughing.
“ Of course; send for it at once. The rate of exchange is
now high. I will give you government bills, which will make
it nearly four thousand pounds.”
“ Four thousand pounds for preventing an old woman from
falling,” replied Captain Wilson. '
“Devilish well paid, Wilson, and I congratulate you.”
“For how much am I indebted to the father of young
Easy!” observed Captain Wilson, after a silence of some
minutes; “if he had not assisted me when I was appointed to
a ship, I should not have gained my promotion — nor three
thousand pounds I have made in prize-money—the command
of a ﬁne frigate — and now four thousand pounds in a wind- 5
fall.”
The governor thought that he was more indebted to Jack
than to his father for some of these advantages, but he was
careful not to point them out.
“It’s very true,” observed the governor, “that Mr. Easy
was of service to you when you were appointed; but allow me
to observe, that for you- ship, your prize-money, and for
your windfall, you have been wholly indebted to your own
gallantry, in both senses of the word; still Mr. Easy is a ﬁne
generous fellow, and so is his son, I can tell you. By-the-
bye, 1 had a long conversation with him the other day.”
“About himself?”
“Yes, all about himself. He appears to me to have come
into the service without any particular motive, and will be
just as likely to leave it in the same way. He appears to be
very much in love with that Sicilian nobleman’s daughter. I
ﬁnd that he has written to her, and to her brother}, since he
has been here.”
“That he came into the service in search of what he never
will ﬁnd in this world, I know very well; and I presume that
he has found that out—and that he will follow up the service
is also very doubtful; but I do not wish that he should leave
it yet; it is doing him great good,” replied Captain Wilson.

“I agree with you there — I have great inﬂuence with
him, and he shall stay yet awhile. He is heir to a very large
fortune, is he not?”
“A clear eight thousand pounds a year, if not more.”
“If his father dies he must, of course, leave: a midship-
man with eight thousand pounds a-year would indeed be an
anomaly.”
“That the service could not permit. It would be as in-
jurious to himself as it would to others about him. At pre-
sent, he has almost, indeed I may say quite, an unlimited
command of money.”
“That’s bad, very bad. I wonder he behaves so well as
he does.”
“And so do I: but he really is a very superior lad, with
all his peculiarities, and a general favourite with those whose
opinions and friendship are worth having.”
“Well, don’t curb him up too tight - for really he does
not require it. He goes very well in a snafﬂe.”
CHAPTER XXVIII.
“Philosophy made easy” upon agrarian Principles, the subject of some
Uneasiness to our Hero. — The ﬁrst Appearance, but not the last, of
an important Parsonage.
Tun conversation was here interrupted by a mail from
England which they had been expecting. Captain Wilson
retired with his letters; the governor remained equally oc-
cupied; and our hero received the ﬁrst letter ever written to
him by his father. It ran as follows: —
“My dear Son,
“I have many times taken up my pen with the intention
of letting you know how things went on in this country. But
as I can perceive around but one dark horizon of evil, I have
as often laid it down again without venturing to make you
unhappy with such bad intelligence.
“The account of your death, and also of your unex-

pectedly being yet spared to us, were duly received, and I
trust, I mourned and rejoiced on each occasion with all the
moderation characteristic of a philosopher. In the ﬁrst in-
stance I consoled myself with the reﬂection that the world
you had left was in a state of slavery, and pressed down by
the iron arm of despotism, and that to die was gain, not only
in all the parson tells us, but also in our liberty; and, at the
second intelligence, I moderated my joy for nearly about the
same reasons, resolving, notwithstanding what Dr. Middleton
may say, to die as I have lived, a true philosopher.
“The more I reﬂect the more am I convinced that there
is nothing required to make this world happy but equality,
and the rights of man being duly observed — in short, that
everything and everybody should be reduced to one level. Do
we not observe that it is the law of nature — do not brooks
run into rivers — rivers into seas — mountains crumble down
upon the plains? — are not the seasons contented to equalise
the parts of the earth? Why does the sun run round the
ecliptic, instead of the equator but to give an equal share of
his heat to both sides of the world? Are we not all equally
born in misery? does not death level us all ‘aaquo pede,’ as
the poet hath? are we not all equally hungry, thirsty, and
sleepy, and thus levelled by our natural wants? And such
being the case, ought we not to have our equal share of good
things in this world, to which we have undoubted equal right?
Can any argument be more solid or more level than this,
whatever nonsense Dr. Middleton may talk?
“Yes, my son, if it were not that I still hope to see the
sun of Justice arise, and disperse the manifold dark clouds
which obscure the land — if I did not still hope, in my time,
to see an equal distribution of property — an agrarian law
passed, by the House of Commons, in which all should beneﬁt
alike — 1 would not care how soon I left this vale of tears,
created by tyranny and injustice. At present, the same
system is carried on; the nation is taxed for the beneﬁt of
the few, and it groans under oppression and despotism; but I
still do think that there is, if I may fortunately express my-

self, a bright star in the west; and signs of the times which
comfort me. Already we have had a good deal of incen-
diarism about the country, and some of the highest aristo-
cracy have pledged themselves to raise the people above
themselves, and have advised sedition and conspiracy; have
shown to the debased and unenlightened multitude that their
force is physically irresistible, and recommended them to
make use of it, promising that if they hold in power, they
will only use that power to the abolition of our farce of a
constitution, of a church, and of a king; and that if the nation
is to be governed at all, it shall only be governed by the
many. This is cheering. Hail, patriot lords! all hail! I am
in hopes that the great work will be achieved, in spite of the
laughs and sneers and shakes of the head, which my argu-
ments still meet with from that obstinate fellow, Dr. Middle-
- ton.
“Your mother is in a quiet way; she has given over read-
ing and working, and even her knitting, as useless; and she
now sits all day long at the chimney corner twiddling her
thumbs, and waiting, as she says, for the millennium. Poor
thing! she is very foolish with her ideas upon this matter, but
as usual I let her have her own way in everything, copying
the philosopher of old, who was tied to his Xantippe.
“I trust, my dear son, that your principles have streng-
thened with your years and fortiﬁed with your growth, and
that, if necessary, you will sacriﬁce all to obtain what in my
opinion will prove to be the real millennium. Make all the
converts you can, and believe me to be,

Jack, who was alone, shook his head as he read this
letter, and then laid it down with a pish! He did it in-
voluntarily, and was surprised at himself when he found that
he had so done. “I should like to argue the point,” thought
Jack, in spite of himself; and then he threw the letter on the

table, and went into Gascoigne’s room, displeased with his
father and with himself. He asked Ned whether he had re-
ceived any lctters from England, and, it being near dinner-
time, went back to dress. On his coming down into the re-
ceiving-room with Gascoigne, the governor said to them, —
“As you two both speak Italian, you must take charge of
a Sicilian ofﬁcer, who has come here with letters of introduc-
tion to me, and who dines here to-day.”
Before dinner they were introduced to the party in ques-
tion, a slight-made, well-looking young man, but still there
was an expression in his countenance which was not agree-
able. In compliance with the wishes of the governor, Don
Mathias, for so he was called, was placed between our two
midshipmen, who immediately entered into conversation with
him, being themselves anxious to make inquiries about their
friends at Palermo. In the course of conversation, Jack in-
quired of him whether he was acquainted with Don Rebiera,
to which the Sicilian answered in the afﬁrmative, and they
talked about the diiferent members of the family. Don Ma-
thias, towards the close of the dinner, inquired of Jack by
what means he had become acquainted with Don Rebiera,
and Jack, in reply, narrated how he and his friend Gascoigne
had saved him from being murdered by two villains; after
this reply, the young ofﬁcer appeared to be less inclined for
conversation, but before the party broke up, requested to have
the acquaintance of our two midshipmen. As soon as he was
gone, Gascoigne observed in a reﬂective way, “I have seen
that face before, but where I cannot exactly say; but you
know, Jack, what a memory of people I have, and I have seen
him before, I am sure.”
“I can’t recollect that ever I have,” replied our hero, “but
I never knew any one who could recollect in that way as
you do.”
The conversation was then dropped between them, and
Jack was for some time listening to the governor and Captain
Wilson, for the whole party were gone away, when Gascoigne,
19*

292 MR. runsmrrmn nssv.
who had been in deep thought since he had made the ob-
servation to Jack, sprang up.
“I have him at last!” cried he.
“Have who?” demanded Captain Wilson.
“That Sicilian ofﬁcer — I could have sworn that I had
seen him before.”
“ That Don Mathias?”
“N0, Sir Thomas! He is not Don Mathias! He is the very
Don Silvio who was murdering Don Rebiera, when we came
to his assistance and saved him.”
“I do believe you are right, Gascoigne.”
“I’m positive of it,” replied Grascoigne; “I never made a
mistake in my life.”
“Bring me those letters, Easy,” said the governor, “and
let us see what they say of him. Here it is — Don Mathias
de Alayeres. You may be mistaken, Gascoigne; it’s a heavy
charge you are making against this young man.”
“Well, Sir Thomas, if that is not Don Silvio, I’d forfeit
my commission if I had it here in my hand. Besides, I ob-
served the change in his countenance when we told him it
was Easy and I who had come to Don Rebiera’s assistance;
and did you observe after that, Easy, that he hardly said a
word?”
“Very true,” replied Jack.
“Well, well, we must see to this,” observed the governor;
“if so, this letter of introduction must be a forgery.”
The party then retired to bed, and the next morning,
while Easy was in Gascoigne’s room talking over their suspi-
cions, letters from Palermo were brought up to him. They
were in answer to those written by Jack on his arrival at
Malta: a few lines from Don Rebiera, a small note from Agnes,
and a voluminous detail from his friend Don Philip , who in-
formed him of the good health of all parties, and of their
good-will towards him; of Agnes being as partial as ever; of
his having spoken plainly, as he had promised Jack, to his
father and mother relative to the mutual attachment; of their
consent being given, and then withheld, because Father

Thomas, their confessor, would not listen to the union of
Agnes with a. heretic; but nevertheless telling Jack this would
be got over through the medium of his brother and himself,
who were determined that their sister and he should not be
made unhappy about such a triﬂe. But the latter part of the
letter contained intelligence equally important, which was,
that Don Silvio had again attempted the life of their father,
and would have succeeded, had not Father Thomas, who
happened to be there, thrown himself between them. That
Don Silvio in his rage had actually stabbed the confessor,
although the wound was not dangerous. That in consequence
of this, all further lenity was denied to him, and that the
authorities were in search of him to award him the punish-
ment due to murder and sacrilege. That up to the present
they could not ﬁnd him, and it was supposed that he had
made his escape to Malta in one of the speronares.
Such were the contents of the letter, which were im-
mediately communicated to the governor and Captain Wilson,
upon their meeting at breakfast.
“Very well, we must see to this,” observed the governor,
who then made his inquiries as to the other intelligence con-
tained in the letters.
Jack and Gascoigne were uneasy till the breakfast was
over, when they made their escape: a few moments afterwards
Captain Wilson rose to go on board, and sent for them, but
they were not to be found.
“I understand it all, Wilson,” said the governor; “leave
them to me; go on board and make yourself quite easy.”
In the meantime our two midshipmen had taken their hats .
and walked away to the parapet of the battery, where they
would not be interrupted.
“Now, Gascoigne ,” observed Jack, “ you guess what I’m
about—I must shoot that rascal this very morning, and that’s
why I came out with you.”
“But, Easy, the only difference is this, that I must shoot
him, and not you; he is my property, for I found him out.”
“ We’ll argue that point,” replied J aek: “he has attempted

the life of my is-to-be, please God, father-in-law, and there-
fore I have the best claim to him.”
“I beg your pardon, Jack, he is mine, for I discovered
him. Now let me put a case: suppose one man walking
several yards before another, picks up a purse, what claim
has the other to it? 1 found him, and not you.”
“That’s all very well, Gascoigne; but suppose the purse
you picked up to be mine, then I have a right to it, although
you found it; he is my bird by right, and not yours.”
“But I have another observation to make, which is very
important: he is a blood relation of Agnes, and if his blood
is on your hands, however much he may deserve it, depend
upon it, it will be raised as an obstacle to your union; think
of that.”
Jack paused in thought.
“And let me induce you by another remark — you will
confer on me a most particular favour.”
“It will be the greatest I ever could,” replied Jack, “and
you ought to be eternally indebted to me.”
“I trust to make him eternally indebted to me,” replied
Gascoigne.
Sailors, if going into action, always begin to reckon what
their share of the prize-money may be, before a shot is ﬁred
—our two midshipmen appear in this instance to be doing
the same. _
The point having been conceded to Gascoigne, Jack went
to the inn where Don Silvio had mentioned that he had taken
up his quarters, and sending up his card, followed the waiter
up-stairs. The waiter opened the door, and presented the
card.
“Very well,” replied Don Silvio, “you can go down and
show him up.”
Jack, hearing these words, did not wait, but walked in,
where he found Don Silvio very busy removing a bone upon
which he had been whetting a sharp double-edged stiletto.
The Sicilian walked up to him, offering his hand with ap-
parent cordiality; but Jack, with a look of deﬁance, said,

MR. MIDSHIPMAN nasv. 295
“Don Silvio, we know you; my object now is to demand, on
the part of my friend, the satisfaction which you do not de-
serve, but which our indignation at your second attempt upon
Don Rebiera induces us to offer; for if you escape from him
you will have to do with me. On the whole, Don Silvio, you
may think yourself fortunate, for it is better to die by the
hands of a gentleman than by the gibbet.”
Don Silvio turned deadly pale -— his hand sought his sti-
letto in his bosom , but it was remaining on the table; at last
he replied, “Be it so — I will meet you when and where you
please, in an hour from this.”
Jack mentioned the place of meeting, and then walked
out of the room. He and Gascoignc then hastened to the
quarters of an ofﬁcer they were intimate with, and having
provided themselves with the necessary ﬁre-arms, were at the
spot before the time. They waited for him till the exact time,
yet no Don Silvio made his appearance.
“ He’s off,” observed Gascoigne; “the villain has escaped
11
I15.
Half an hour over the time had passed, and still there was
no sign of Gascoigne’s antagonist, but one of the governor’s
aides-de-camp was seen walking up to them.
“Here’s Atkins,” observed Jack; “that’s unlucky, but he
won’t interfere.”
“Gentlemen,” said Atkins, taking eif his hat with much
solemnity, “the governor particularly wishes to speak to you
bot .”
“We can’t come just now — we’ll be there in half an
hour.”
“You must be there in three minutes, both of you. Excuse
me, my orders are positive — and to see them duly executed
I have a corporal and a ﬁle of men behind that wall — of
course, if you walk with me quietly there will be no occasion
to send for their assistance.”
“This is confounded tyranny,” cried Jack. “Well may
they call him ‘King Tom.’ ”

“Yes,” replied Atkins , “and he governs here ‘in rey ab-
solute’ — so come along.”
Jack and Gascoigne, having no choice, walked up to the
government house, where they found Sir Thomas in the
veranda, which commanded a view of the harbour and ofﬁng.
“Come here, young gentlemen,” said the governor, in a
severe tone; “do you see that vessel about two miles clear of
the port? Don Silvio is in it, going back to Sicily under a
guard. And now remember what I say as a maxim through
life. Fight with gentlemen, if you must ﬁght, but not with
villains and murderers. By ‘consenting’ to ﬁght with a
‘blackguard,’ you as much disparage your cloth and com-
promise your own characters, as by refusing to give satis-
faction to a ‘gentleman.’ There, go away, for I’m angry with
you, and don’t let me see you till dinner-time.”
CHAPTER XXIX.
In which our Hero sees a little more Service, and is better employed than
in ﬁghting Don Silvio.
Bur before they met the governor at his table, a sloop of
war arrived from the ﬂeet with despatches from the com-
mander-in-chief. Those to Captain Wilson required him to
make all possible haste in ﬁtting, and then to proceed and
cruise ofl‘ Corsica, to fall in with a Russian frigate which was
on that coast; if not there, to obtain intelligence, and to fol-
low her wherever she might be.
All was now hustle and activity on board of the Aurora.
Captain Wilson, with our hero and Gascoigne, quitted the
governor’s house and repaired on board, where they remained
day and night. On the third day the Aurora was complete
and ready for sea, and about noon sailed out of Valette Har-
bour.
In a week the Aurora had gained the coast of Corsica, and
there was no need of sending look-out men to the mast-head,
for one of the ofﬁcers or midshipmen was there from day-

light to dark. She ran up the coast to the northward with-
out seeing the object of her pursuit, or obtaining any intel-
ligence.
Calms and light airs detained them for a few days, when
a northerly breeze enabled them to run down the eastern side
of the island. It was on the eighteenth day after they had
quitted Malta, that a large vessel was seen ahead about
eighteen miles off. The men were then at breakfast.
“A frigate, Captain Wilson, I’m sure of it,” said Mr.
Hawkins, the chaplain, whose anxiety induced him to go to
the mast-head.
“How is she steering?”
“The same way as we are.”
The Aurora was under all possible sail, and when the
hands were piped to dinner, it was thought that they had
neared the chase about two miles.
“This will be a long chase; a stern chase always is,” ob-
served Martin to Gascoigne.
“Yes, -I’m afraid so — but I’m more afraid of her
escaping.”
“That’s not unlikely either,” replied the mate.
“You are one of Job’s comforters, Martin,” replied Gas-
coigne.
“Then I’m not so often disappointed,” replied the mate.
“There are two points to be ascertained; the ﬁrst is, whether
we shall come up with the vessel or lose her — the next is, if
we do come up with her, whether she is the vessel we are
looking for.”
“You seem very indiiferent about it.”
“Indeed I am not: I am the oldest passed midshipman in
the ship, and the taking of the frigate will, if I live, give me
my promotion, and if I’m killed, I sha’n’t want it. But I’ve
been so often disappointed, that I now make sure of nothing
until I have i .”
“Well, for your sake, Martin, I will still hope that the
vessel is the one we seek, that we shall not be killed, and that
you will gain your promotion.”

“I thank you, Easy — I wish I was one that dared hope
as you do.”
Poor Martin! he had long felt how bitter it was to meet
disappointment upon disappointment. How true it is, that
hope deferred maketh the heart sick! and his antieipations
of early days, the buoyant calculations of youth, had been
one by one crushed, and now, having served his time nearly
three times over, the reaction had become too painful, and,
as he truly said, he dared not hope: still his temper was not
soured, but chastened.
“ She has hauled her wind, sir,” hailed the second-lieuten-
ant from the topmast cross-trees.
“What think you of that, Martin?” observed Jack.
“Either that she is an English frigate, or that she is
a vessel commanded by a very brave fellow, and well
manned.”
It was sunset before the Aurora had arrived within two
miles of the vessel; the private signal had been thrown out,
but had not been answered, either because it was too dark to
make out the colours of the ﬂags, or that these were unknown
to an enemy. The stranger had hoisted the English colours,
but that was no satisfactory proof of her being a friend; and
just before dark she had put her head towards the Aurora,
who had now come stem down to her. The ship’s com-
pany of the Aurora were all at their quarters, as a few
minutes would now decide whether they had to deal with a
friend or foe.
There is no situation perhaps more difﬁeult, and demand-
ing so much caution, as the occasional meeting with a doubt-
ful ship. On the one hand, it being necessary to be fully
prepared, and not allow the enemy the advantage which may
be derived from your inaction; and on the other, the neces-
sity of prudence, that you may not assault your friends and
countrymen. Captain Wilson had hoisted the private night-
signal, but here again it was difﬁcult, from his sails inter-
vening, for the other ship to make it out. Before the two
frigates were within three cables’ length of each other, Cap-

tain Wilson, determined that there should be no mistake
from any want of precaution on his part, hauled up his cour-
ses and brailed up his driver that the night-signal might be
clearly seen.
Lights were seen abaft on the quarter-deck of the other
vessel, as if they were about to answer, but she continued to
keep the Aurora to leeward at about half a cable’s length, and
as the foremost guns of each vessel were abreast of each
other, hailed in English —
“Ship ahoy! what ship’s that?”
“His Majesty’s ship Aurora,” replied C_aptainVVilson, who
stood on the hammocks. “What ship’s that?”
By this time, the other frigate had passed half -her length
clear of the beam of the Aurora, and at the same time that a
pretended reply of “His Majesty’s ship ——” was heard, a
broadside from her guns, which had been trained aft on pur-
pose, was poured into the Aurora, and, at so short a distance,
doing considerable execution. The crew of the Aurora, hear-
ing the hailing in English, and the vessel passing them ap-
parently without ﬁring, had imagined that she had been one
of their own cruisers. The captains of the guns had dropped
their lanyards in disappointment, and the silence which had
been maintained as the two vessels met was just breaking up
in various ways of lamentation at their bad luck, when the
broadside was poured in, thundering in their ears, and the
ripping and tearing of the beams and planks astonished their
senses. Many were carried down below, but it was difﬁcult
to say whether indignation at the enemy’s ruse, or satisfaction
at discovering that they were not called to quarters in vain,
most predominated. At all events, it was answered by three
voluntary cheers, which drowned the cries of those who were
being assisted to the cockpit.
“Man the larboard-guns and about ship!” cried Captain
Wilson, leaping off the hammocks. “Look out, my lads, and
rake her in stays! We’ll pay him off for that foul play before
we’ve done with him. Look out, my lads, and take good aim
as she pays round.”

The Aurora was put about, and her broadside poured into
the stern of the Russian frigate—for such she was. It was
almost dark, but the enemy, who appeared as anxious as the
Aurora to come to action, hauled up her courses to await her
coming up. In ﬁve minutes the two vessels were alongside,
exchanging murderous broadsides at little more than pistol-
shot — running slowly in for the land, then not more than
ﬁve miles distant. The skin-clad mountaineers of Corsica
were aroused by the furious cannonading, watching the in-
cessant ﬂashes of the guns, and listening to their reverbe-
rating roar.
After half an hour’s ﬁerce combat, during which the ﬁre
of both vessels was kept up with undiminished vigour, Capt.
Wilson went down on the main-deck, and himself separately
pointed each gun after it was loaded; those amidships being
direct for the main-channels of the enemy’s ship, while those
abaft the beam were gradually trained more and more for-
ward, and those before the beam more and more aft, so as to
throw all their shot nearly into one focus, giving directions
that they were all to be ﬁred at once, at the word of com-
mand. The enemy, not aware of the cause of the delay,
imagined that the ﬁre of the Aurora had slackened, and
loudly cheered. At the word given, the broadside was poured
in, and, dark as it was, the effects from it were evident. Two
of the midship ports of the antagonist were blown into one,
and her mainmast was seen to totter, and then to fall over the
side. The Aurora then set her courses, which had been
hauled up, and, shooting ahead, took up a raking position,
while the Russian was still hampered with her wreck, and
poured in grape and canister from her upper-deck car-
ronades to impede their labours on deck, while she continued
her destructive ﬁre upon the hull of the enemy from the main-
deck battery.
The moon now burst out from a low bank of clouds, and
enabled them to accomplish their work with more precision.
In a quarter of an hour the Russian was totally dismasted,
and Captain Wilson ordered half of his remaining ship’s com-

pany to repair the damages, which had been most severe,
whilst the larboard men at quarters continued the ﬁre from
the main-deck. The enemy continued to return the ﬁre from
four guns, two on each of her decks, which she could
still make bear upon the Aurora; but after some time even
these ceased, either from the men having deserted them, or
from their being dismounted. Observing that the ﬁre from
her antagonist had ceased, the Aurora also discontinued, and
the jolly-boat aster n being still uninjured, the second-lieuten-
ant was deputed to pull alongside of the frigate to ascertain
if she had struck.
The beams of the bright moon silvered the rippling water
as the boat shoved off; and Captain Wilson and his ofﬁcers
who were still unhurt, leant over the shattered sides of the
Aurora, waiting for a reply: suddenly the silence of the
night was broken upon by a loud splash from the bows of the
Russian frigate, then about three cables’ length distant.
“What could that be?” cried Captain Wilson. “Her an-
chor’s down. Mr. Jones, a lead over the side, and see what
water we have.”
Mr. Jones had long been carried down below, severed in
two with a round shot—but a man leaped into the chains,
and lowering down the lead, sounded in seven fathoms.
“Then I suspect he will give us more trouble yet,” ob-
served Captain Wilson; and so indeed it proved, for the
Russian captain, in reply to the second-lieutenant, had told
him in English, “that he would answer that question with
his broadside,” and before the boat was dropped astern, he-
had warped round with the springs on his cable, and had re-
commenced his ﬁre upon the Aurora.
Captain Wilson made sail upon his ship, and sailed round
and round the anchored vessel, so as to give her two broad-
sides to her one, and from the slowness with which she
worked at her springs upon her cables, it was evident that
she must be now very weak-handed. Still the pertinacity
and decided courage of the Russian captain convinced Cap-
tain Wilson, that, in all probability, he would sink at his an-

chor before he would haul down his colours; and not only
would he lose more of the Aurora’s men, but also the Russian
vessel, without he took a more decided step. Captain Wil-
son, therefore, resolved to try her by the board. Having
poured in a raking ﬁre, he stood off for a few moments, du-
ring which he called the ofﬁcers and men on deck, and stated
his intention. He then went about, and himself conning the
Aurora, ran her on board the Russian, pouring in his re-
served broadside as the vessels came into collision, and head-
ing his men as they leaped on the enemy’s decks.
Although, as Captain Wilson had imagined, the Russian
frigate had not many men to oppose to the Aurora’s, the deck
was obstinately defended, the voice and the arm of the Rus-
sian captain were to be heard and seen everywhere, and his
men, encouraged by him, were cut down by numbers where
they stood.
Our hero, who had the good fortune to be still unhurt,
was for a little while close to Captain Wilson when he boarded,
and was about to oppose his unequal force against that of the
Russian captain, when he was pulled back by the collar by
Mr. Hawkins, the chaplain, who rushed in advance with a
sabre in his hand. The opponents were well matched, and
it may be said that, with little interruption, a hand-to-hand
conﬂict ensued, for the moon lighted up the scene of carnage,
and they were well able to distinguish each other’s faces. At
last, the chaplain’s sword broke; be rushed in, drove the hilt
into his antagonist’s face, closed with him, and they both fell
down the hatchway together. After this, the deck was
gained, or rather cleared, by the crew of the Aurora, for few
could be said to have resisted, and in a minute or two the
frigate was in their possession. The chaplain and the Russian
captain were hoisted up, still clinging to each other, both
senseless from the fall, but neither of them dead, although
bleeding from several wounds.
As soon as the main-deck had been cleared, Captain
Wilson ordered the hatches to be put on, and left a party on

board while he hastened to attend to the condition of his own
ship and ship’s company.
It was daylight before anything like order had been
restored to the decks of the Aurora; the water was still
smooth, and instead of letting go her own anchor, she had
hung on with a hawser to the prize, but her sails had been
furled, her decks cleared, guns secured, and the buckets were
dashing away the blood from her planks and the carriages of
the guns, when the sun rose and shone upon them. The
numerous wounded had, by this time, been put into their
hammocks, although there were still one or two cases of
amputation to be performed.
The carpenter had repaired all shot-holes under or too
near to the water-line, and then had proceeded to sound the
well of the prize; but although her upper works had been
dreadfully shattered, there was no reason to suppose that she
had received any serious injury below, and therefore the
hatches still remained on, although a few hands were put to
the pumps to try if she made any water. It was not'until the
Aurora presented a more cheerful appearance that Captain
Wilson went over to the other ship, whose deck, now that
the light of heaven enabled them to witness all the horrors
even to minuteness, presented a shocking spectacle of blood
and carnage. Body after body was thrown over; the wounded
were supplied with water and such assistance as could be
rendered until the surgeons could attend them; the hatches
were then taken off, and the remainder of her crew ordered
on deck; about two hundred obeyed the summons, but the
lower deck was as crowded with killed and wounded as was
the upper. For the present the prisoners were handed over
down into the fore-hold of the Aurora, which had been pre-
pared for their reception, and the work of separation of the
dead from the living then underwent. After this, such re-
pairs as were immediately necessary were made, and a portion
of the Aurora’s crew, under the orders of the second-lieutenant,
were sent on board to take charge of her. It was not till the
evening of the day after this night-conﬂict that the Aurora

was in a situation to make sail. All hands were then sent on
board of the Trident, for such was the name of the Russian
frigate, to ﬁt her out as soon as possible. Before morning,
— for there was no relaxation from their fatigue, nor was
there any wish for it,—all was completed, and the two
frigates, although in a shattered condition, were prepared to
meet any common conﬂict with the elements. The Aurora
made sail with the Trident in tow; the hammocks were al-
lowed to be taken down, and the watch below permitted to
repose.
In this murderous conﬂict the Trident had more than two
hundred men killed and wounded. The Aurora’s loss had
not been so great, but still it was severe, having lost sixty-
ﬁve men and ofﬁcers. Among the fallen there were Mr.
Jones, the master, the third-lieutenant, Mr. Arkwright, and
two midshipmen killed. Mr. Pottyfar, the ﬁrst-lieutenant,
severely wounded at the commencement of the action. Martin,
the master’s mate, and Gascoigne, the ﬁrst mortally, and the
second badly, wounded. Our hero had also received a slight
cutlass wound, which obliged him to wear his arm, for a short
time, in a sling.
Among the ship’s company who were wounded was Mesty;
he had been hurt with a splinter before the ‘l‘rident was taken
by the board, but had remained on deck, and had followed
our hero, watching over him and protecting him as a father.
He had done even more, for he had with Jack thrown himself
before Captain Wilson, at a time that he had received such
a blow with the ﬂat of a sword as to stun him, and bring him
down on his knee. And Jack had taken good care that Cap-
tain Wilson should not be ignorant, as he really would have
been, of this timely service on the part of Mesty, who
certainly, although with a great deal of ‘sang-froid’ in his
composition when in repose, was a ﬁend incarnate when his
blood was up.
“But you must have been with Mesty,” observed Captain
Wilson, “when he did me the service.”

“I was with him, sir,” replied Jack, with great modesty;
“but was of very little service.”
“How is your friend Gascoigne this evening?”
“Oh, not very bad, sir —he wants a glass of grog.”
“ And Mr. Martin?”
Jack shook his head.
“Why, the surgeon thinks he will do well.”
“Yes, sir, and so I told Martin; but he said that it was
very well to give him hope — but that he thought otherwise.”
“You must manage him, Mr. Easy; tell him that he is
sure of his promotion.”
“I have, sir, but he won’t believe it. He never will believe
it till he has his commission signed. I really think that an
acting order would do more than the doctor can.”
“Well, Mr. Easy, he shall have one to-morrow morning.
Have you seen Mr. Pottyfar? he, I am afraid, is very bad.”
“ Very bad, sir; and they say is worse every day, and yet
his wound is healthy, and ought to be doing well.”
Such was the conversation between Jack and his captain,
as they sat at breakfast on the third morning after the action.
The next day Easy took down an acting order for Martin,
and put it into his hands. The mate read it over as he lay
bandaged in his hammock.
“It’s only an actingorder, Jack,” said he; “it may not be
conﬁrmed.”
Jack swore, by all the articles of war, that it would be;
but Martin replied that he was sure it never would.
“No, no,” said the mate, “I know very well that I never
should be made. If it is not conﬁrmed, I may live; but if it
is, I am sure to die.”
Every one that went to Martin’s hammock wished him joy
of his promotion; but six days after the action, poor Martin’s
remains were consigned to the deep.
The next person who followed him was Mr. Pottyfar, the
ﬁrst-lieutenant, who had contrived, wounded as he was, to
reach a packet of the universal medicine, and had taken so
many bottles before he was found out, that he was one morn-

ing found dead in his bed, with more than two dozen empty
phials under his pillow, and by the side of his mattress. He
was not buried with his hands in his pockets, but when sewed
up in his hammock, they were, at all events, laid in the right
position.
CHAPTER XXX.
Modern Phrlanthropy, which, as usual, is the Cause of much Trouble and
Vexation.
In three weeks the Aurora , with her prize in tow, arrived
at Malta. The wounded were sent to the hospital, and the
gallant Russian captain recovered from his Wounds about the
same time as Mr. Hawkins, the chaplain.
Jack, who constantly called to see the chaplain, had a
great deal to do to console him. He would shake his hands
as he lay in his bed, exelaiming against himself. “Oh,”
would he say, “the spirit is willing, but the ﬂesh is weak.
That I, a man of God, as they term me, who ought to have
been down with the surgeons, whispering comfort to the
desponding, should have gone on deck (but I could not help
it), and have mixed in such a scene of slaughter. What will
become of me?”
Jack attempted to console him by pointing out, that not
only chaplains, but bishops, have been known to ﬁght in
armour from time immemorial. But Mr. Hawkins’s recovery
was long doubtful, from the agitation of his mind. 'When he
was able to walk, Jack introduced to him the Russian cap-
tain, who was also just out of his bed.
“I am most happy to embrace so gallant an ofﬁcer,” said
the Russian, who recognised his antagonist, throwing his
arms round the chaplain, and giving him a kiss on both
cheeks. “What is his rank?” continued he, addressing him-
self to Jack, who replied, very quietly, “that he was the
ship’s padre.”
“The padre!” replied the captain, with surprise, as

MR. MIDSHLPMAN nASv. ‘ 307
Hawkins turned away with confusion. “The padre — par
exemple! Well, I always had a great respect for the church.
Pray, sir,” said he, turning to Easy, “do your padres always
head your boarders?”
“Always, sir,” replied Jack; “it’s a rule of the service —
and the duty of a padre to show the men the way to heaven.
It’s our ninety-ninth article of war.”
“You are a ﬁghting nation,” replied the Russian, bowing
to Hawkins, and continuing his walk, not exactly pleased
that he had been ﬂoored by a parson.
Mr. Hawkins continued very disconsolate for some time;
he then invalided, and applied himself to his duties on shore,
where he would not be exposed to such temptations from his
former habits.
As the Aurora, when she was last at Malta, had nearly
exhausted the dockyard for her repairs, she was even longer
ﬁtting out this time, during which Captain Wilson’s de-
spatches had been received by the admiral, and had been
acknowledged by a brig sent to Malta. The admiral, in reply,
after complimenting him upon his gallantry and success,
desired that, as soon as he was ready, he should proceed to
Palermo with communications of importance to the authorities,
and having remained there for an answer, was again to return
to Malta to pick up such of his men as might be ﬁt to leave
the hospital, and then join the Toulon ﬂeet. This intelligence
was soon known to our hero, who was in ecstasies at the idea
of again seeing Agnes and her brothers. Once more the
Aurora sailed away from the high-crowned rocks of Valette,
and with a ﬁne breeze dashed through the deep blue waves.
But towards the evening the breeze increased, and they
were under double-reefed topsails. On the second day they
made the coast of Sicily, not far from where Easy and Gas-
coigne had been driven on shore; the weather was then more
moderate, and the sea had, to a great degree, subsided.
They therefore stood in close to the coast, as they had not a
leading wind to Palermo. As they stood in, the glasses, as
usual, were directed to land; observing the villas with which
20*

the hills and valleys were studded, with their white fronts
embowered in orange groves. .
“What is that, Gascoigne,” said Easy, “under that pre-
cipice? —_ it looks like a_vessel.” _ _ _
_Gasco1gne turned hrs glass 111 the drrectron — “ Yes,
it rs a vessel on the rocks: by her prow she looks hke a
galley.”
“It is a galley, sir — one of the row galleys — I can make
out her bank of oars,” observed the signal-man.
This was reported to Captain Wilson, who also examined
her.
“She is on the rocks, certainly,” observed he; “and I
think I see people on board. Keep her away a point, quarter-
master.”
The Aurora was now steered right for the vessel, and in
the course of an hour was not more than a mile from her.
Their suppositions were correct — it was one of the Sicilian
government galleys bilged on the rocks, and they now per-
ceived that there were people on board of her, making signals
with their shirts and pieces of linen.
“They must be the galley-slaves‘ for I perceive that
they do not one of them change their, positions: the galley
must have been abandoned by their ofﬁcers and seamen, and
the slaves left to perish.”
“That’s very hard ” observed Jack to Gascoigne- “they
were condemned to the galleys, but not to death.” ’
“They will not have much mercy from the waves,” re-
plied Gascoigne; “they will all be in kingdom come to-mor-
row morning, rf the breeze comes more on the land. We have
already come up two points this forenoon.”
Although Captain Wilson did not join in this conversa-
tion which he overheard as he stood on the forecastle gun,
with’ his glass over the hammocks, it appears he was of the
same opinion; but he demurred: he had to choose between
allowing so many of his fellow-creatures to perish miserably,
or to let loose upon society a set of miscreants who would
again enter a course of crime until they were; recaptured,

and by so doing, probably displease the Sicilian authorities.
After some little reﬂection he resolved that he would take
his chance of the latter. The Aurora was hove-to in stays,
and the two cutters ordered to be lowered down, and the
boat’s crew to be armed. -
“Mr. Easy, do you take one cutter, and the armourers;
pull on board of the galley, release those people, and land
them in small divisions. Mr. Gascoigne, you will take the
other to assist Mr. Easy, and when he lands them in his boat,
you will pull by his side ready to act, in case of any hostile
attempt on the part of the scoundrels; for we must not expect
gratitude: of course, land them at the nearest safe spot for
debarkation.”
In pursuance of these orders, our two midshipmen pulled
away to the vessel. They found her ﬁxed hard upon the
rocks, which had pierced her slight timbers, and, as they had
supposed, the respectable part of her crew, with the com-
mander, had taken to the boats, leaving the galley-slaves to
their fate. She pulled ﬁfty oars, but had only thirty-six
manned. These oars were forty feet long, and ran in from
the thole-pin with a loom six feet long, each manned by four
slaves, who were chained to their seat before it, by a running
chain made fast by a padlock in amidships. A plank, of two
feet wide, ran fore and aft the vessel between the two banks
ofoars, for the boatswain to apply the lash to those who did
not sufﬁciently exert themselves.
“Viva los Inglesos,” cried the galley-slaves, as Easy
climbed up over the quarter of the vessel.
“I say, Ned, did you ever see such a precious set of vil-
lains?” observed Easy, as he surveyed the faces of the men
who were chained.
“No,” replied Gascoigne; “and I think if the captain
had seen them as we have, that he would have left them
where they were.”
“I don’t know—but, however, our orders are positive.
Armourer, knock 011' all the padlocks, beginning aft; when we
have a cargo we will land them How many are there? —-

twelve dozen; — twelve dozen villains to let loose upon
society. I have a great mind to go on board again and re-
port my opinion to the captain — one hundred and forty-four
villains, who all deserve hanging — for drowning is too good
for them.”
“Our orders are to liberate them, Jack.”
“Yes; but I should like to argue this point with Captain
Wilson.”
“They’1l send after them fast enough, Jack, and they’ll
all be in limbo again before long,” replied Gascoigne.
“Well, I suppose we must obey orders; but it goes
against my conscience to save such villanous-looking rascals.
Armourer, hammer away.”
The armourer, who with the seamen appeared very much
of Jack’s opinion, and had not commenced his work, now
struck off the padlocks one by one, with his sledge-hammer.
As soon as they were released the slaves were ordered into
the cutter, and when it was sufﬁeiently loaded Jack shoved
off, followed by Gascoigne as guard, and landed them at the
point about a cable’s length distant. It required six trips be-
fore they were all landed; the last cargo were on shore, and
Easy was desiring the men to shove ofl”, when one of the gal-
lerians turned round, and cried out to Jack in a mocking
tone, “Addio, signor, a reveder la.” Jack started, ’stared,
and, in the squalid, naked wreteh who addressed him, he re-
cognised Don Silvio!
“I will acquaint Don Rebiera of your arrival, signor,”
said the miscreant, springing up the rocks, and mixing with
the rest, who now commenced hooting and laughing at their
preservers.
“Ned,” observed Easy to Gascoigne, “we have let that
rascal loose.”
“More’s the pity,” replied Gascoigne; “but we have only
obeyed orders.”
“It can’t be helped, but I’ve a notion there will be some
mischief out of this.”
“We obeyed orders,” replied Gascoigne.

“We’ve let the rascals loose not ten miles from Don Re-
biera’s.”
“ Obeyed orders, J aek.”
“With a whole gang to back him, if he goes there.”
“Orders, Jack.”
“Agnes at his mercy.”
“Captain’s orders, Jack.”
“I shall argue this point when I go on board,” replied
Jack. '
“Too late, Jack.”
“Yes,” replied Easy, sinking down on the stern sheets
with a look of despair.
“Give way, my lads, give way.”
Jack returned on board, and reported what he had done:
also that Don Silvio was among those liberated; and he
ventured to mention his fears of what might take place from
their contiguity to the house of Don Rebiera. Captain
Wilson bit his lips: he felt that his philanthropy had induced
him to act without his usual prudence.
“I have done a rash thing, Mr. Easy, I am afraid. I
should have taken them all on board and delivered them up
to the authorities. I wish I had thought of that before. We
must get to Palermo as fast as we can, and have the troops
sent after these miscreants. Hands ‘bout ship, ﬁll the main-
yard.” _
The wind had veered round, and the Aurora was now able
tolay up clear of the island of Maritime. The next morning
she anchored in Palermo Roads — gave immediate notice to
the authorities, who, wishing Captain Wilson’s philanthropy
at the devil, immediately dispatched a large body of troops
in quest of the liberated malefactors. Captain Wilson, feel-
ing for Jack’s anxiety about his friends, called him over to
him on deck, and gave him and Gascoigne permission to go
on shore.
“Will you allow me to take Mesty with me, sir, if you
please"’ said Jack.
“Yes, Mr. Easy; but recollect that, even with Mesty,

you are no match for one hundred and ﬁfty men; so be pru-
dent. I send you to relieve your anxiety, not to nm into
danger.”
“ Of course, sir,” replied Jack, touching his hat, and
walking away quietly till he came to the hatchway, when he
darted down like a shot, and was immediately occupied with
his preparations.
In half an hour our two midshipmen, with Mesty, had
landed, and proceeded to the inn where they had put up be-
fore: they were armed up to the teeth. Their ﬁrst inquiries
were for Don Philip and his brother.
“Both on leave of absence,” replied the landlord, “and
staying with Don Rebiera.”
“That’s some comfort,” thought Jack. “Now we must
get horses as fast as we can. -— Mesty, can you ride?”
“By all dc power, can I ride, Massa Easy; suppose you
ride Kentucky horse, you ride anyting.”
In half an hour four horses and a guide were procured,
and at eight o’clock in the morning the party set off in the
direction of Don Rebiera’s country seat.
They had not ridden more than six miles when they came
up with one of the detachments sent out in pursuit of the
liberated Our hero recognised the commanding
ofﬁcer as an old acquaintance, and imparting to him the re-
lease of Don Silvio, and his fears upon Don Rebiera’s ac~
count, begged him to direct his attention that way.
“Corpo di Bacco —you are right, Signor Mid,” replied
the ofﬁcer, “but Don Philip is there, and his brother too, I
believe. I will be there by ten o’clock to-morrow mornizg;
we will march almost the whole night.”
“They have no arms,” observed Easy.
“No, but they will soon get them: they will go to same
small town in a body, plunder it, and then seek the protec-
tion of the mountains. Your captain has given us a pretty
job.” .
Jack exchanged a few more words, and then, excusing
himself on account of his haste, put the spurs to his horse


## p. 313 (#321) ############################################

MR. mnsmrmnn EASY. 313
and regained his own party, who now proceeded at a rapid
pace.
“ O Signor!” said the guide, “we shall kill the horses.”\
“I’ll pay for them,” said Jack. _
“Yes, but we shall kill them before we get there, Jack,”
- replied Gascoigne, “and have to walk the rest of the
way.”
“Very true, Ned; 1et’s pull up, and give them their
wind.”
“By de holy poker, Massa Easy, but my shirt stick to my '
ribs,” cried Mesty, whose black face was hung with dewdrops
from their rapid course.
“Never mind, Mesty.”
It was about ﬁve o’clock in the afternoon when they ar-
rived at the seat of Don Rebiera. Jack threw himself off his
jaded steed, and hastened into the house, followed by Gas-
coigne. They found the whole family collected in the large
sitting-room, quite ignorant of any danger threatening them,
and equally astonished and pleased at the arrival of their old
friends. Jack ﬂew to Agnes, who screamed when she saw
him, and felt so giddy afterwards that he was obliged to sup-
port her. Having seated her again, he was kindly greeted
by the old people and the two young ofﬁcers. After a few
minutes dedicated to mutual inquiries, our hero stated the
cause of their expeditious arrival.
“Don Silvio with one hundred and ﬁfty gallerians, let
loose on the coast yesterday afternoon!” exclaimed Don
Rebiera; “you are right, I only wonder they were not
here last night. But I expect Pedro from the town; he has
gone down -with a load of wine: he will bring us intel-
ligence.”
“At all events, we must be prepared,” said Don Philip;
“the troops, you say, will be here to-morrow morning.”
“Holy Virgin!” exclaimed the ladies, in a breath.
“How many can we muster?” said Gascoigne.
“We have ﬁve men here, or we shall have by the even-

ing,” replied Don Philip —“all, I think, good men — my
father, my brother, and myself.”
“We are three — four with the guide, whom I know no-
thing about.” ’
‘‘Twelve in all — not one too many; but I think that now
we are prepared, if they attack, we can hold out till the
morning.”
“Had we not better send the ladies away?” said Jack.
“Who is to escort them?” replied Don Philip; “we shall
only weaken our force; besides, they may fall into the mis-
creants’ hands.”
“Shall we all leave the house together? they can but
plunder it,” observed Don Rebiera.
“Still we may be intercepted by them, and our whole force
will be nothing against so many,” observed Don Philip, “if
we are without defence, whereas in the house we shall have
an advantage.”
“E’ vero,” replied Don Rebiera, thoughtfully; “then let
us prepare, for depend upon it Don Silvio will not lose such
an opportunity to wreak his vengeance. He will be here
to-night: I only wonder he has not been here with his
companions before. However, Pedro will arrive in two
hours.”
“We must now see what means we have of defence,” said
Philip. “Come, brother—will you come, sir?”

coigne entered into conversation with the senora, while Easy
took this opportunity of addressing Agnes. He had been
too much occupied with the consultation to pay her much
attention before. He had spoken, with his eyes ﬁxed upon
her, and had been surprised at the improvement which had

taken place in less than a year. He now went to her, and
asked her, in a low voice, “whether she had received his
letter?”
“ Oh, yes!” replied she, colouring.
“And were you angry with what I said, Agnes?” in a low
tone.
“No,” replied she, casting her eyes down on the ﬂoor.
“I repeat now what I said, Agnes—I have never forgotten
you.”
“But —_”
“But what? ”
“Father Thomaso.”
“What of him?”
“He never will —”
“Will what?”
“You are a heretic, he says.”
“Tell him to mind his own business.”
“He has great inﬂuence with my father and mother.”
“Your brothers are on our side.”
“I know that, but there will be great difﬁculty. Our re-
ligion is not the same. He must talk to you — he will convert
you.”
“We’ll argue that point, Agnes. I will convert him if he
has common sense; if not, it’s no use arguing with him. Where
is he.”
“He will soon be at home.”
“Tell me, Agnes, if you had your own will, would you
marry me?” _
“I don’t know; I have never seen any one I liked so
well.”
“Is that all?”
“Is it not enough for a maiden to say?” replied Agnes,
raising her eyes, and looking reproachfully. “Signor, let me
go, here comes my father.”
Notwithstanding, Jack cast his eyes to the window where
Gascoigne and the senora were in converse, and, perceiving
that the old lady’s back was turned, he pressed Agnes to his

bosom before he released her. The gentlemen then returned
with all the ﬁre-arms and destructive weapons they could
collect.
“We have enough,” observed Don Philip, “to arm all the
people we have with us.”
“And we are well armed,” replied Jack, who had left
Agnes standing alone. “What now are your plans?”
“Those we must now consult about. It appears”— but at
this moment the conversation was interrupted by the sudden
entrance of Pedro, who had been dispatched to the town with
the load of wine. He rushed in, ﬂurried and heated, with his
red cap in his hand.
“How now, Pedro, back so early!”
“O signer!” exclaimed the man—“thcy have taken the
cart and the wine, and have drawn it away, up to the moun-
tains.”
“Who?” inquired Don Rebiera.
“The galley-slaves who have been let loose — and by the
body of our blessed saint, they have done pretty mischief -—-
they have broken into the houses, robbed everything — mur-
dered many—clothed themselves with the best—collected
all the arms, provisions, and wine they could lay their hands
on, and have marched away into the mountains. This took
place last night. As I was coming down within a mile of the
town, they met me with my loaded cart, and they turned the
bullocks round and drove them away along with the rest.
By the blessed Virgin! but they are stained with blood, but
not altogether of men, for they have cut up some of the oxen.
I heard this from one of the herdsmen, but he too ﬂed and
could not tell me more. But, signor, I heard them mention
your name.”
“I have no doubt of it,” replied Don Rebiera. “As for
the wine, I only hope they will drink too much of it to-
night. But, Pedro, they will be here, and we must defend
ourselves — so call the men together; I must speak to
them.”

“We shall never see the bullocks again,” observed Pedro,
mournfully.
“No: but we shall never see one another again, if we
do not take care. I have information they come here to-
night.”
“Holy Saint Francis! and they say there are a thousand
of them.”
“Not quite so many, to my knowledge,” observed Jack.
“They told me that a great many were killed in their
attack upon the town, before they mastered it.”
“So much the better. Go now, Pedro, drink a cup of wine,
and then call the other men.
The house was barricadoed as well as circumstances would
permit; the ﬁrst story was also made a fortress by loading the
landing-place with armoires and chests of drawers. The upper
story, or attic, if it might be so called, was defended in the
same way, that they might retreat from one to the other if the
doors were forced.
It was eight o’clock in the evening before all was ready,
and they were still occupied with the last defence, under the
superintendence of Mesty, who showed himself an able engi-
neer, when they heard the sound of an approaching multitude.
They looked out of one of the windows, and perceived the
house surrounded by the galley-slaves, in number apparently
about a hundred. They were all dressed in a most fantastic
manner with whatever they could pick up: some had ﬁre-
arms, but the most of them were supplied with only swords
or knives. With them came also their cortége of plunder:
carts of various descriptions, loaded with provisions of all
sorts, and wine; women lashed down with ropes, soils from
the vessels and boats to supply them with covering in the
mountains, hay, and straw and mattresses. Their plunder
appeared to be well chosen for their exigencies. To their
carts were tied a variety of cattle, intended to accompany
them to their retreat. They all appeared to be under a leader,
who was issuing directions — that leader was soon recognised
by those in the house to be Don Silvio.

“Massa Easy, you show me dat man,’ said Mesty, when
he heard the conversation between Easy and the Rebieras;
“only let me know him.”
“Do you see him there, Mesty, walking down in front of
those men? He has a musket in his hand, a jacket with silver
buttons, and white trousers.”
“Yes, Massa Easy, me see him well—let me look little
more — dat enough.”
The galley-slaves appeared to be very anxious to surround
the house that no one should escape, and Don Silvio was
arranging the men.
“Ned,” said Jack, “let us show him that we are here. He
said that he would acquaint Don Rebiera with our arrival —
let us*‘prove to him that he is too late.”
“It would not be a bad plan,” replied Gascoigne; “if it
were possible that these fellows had any gratitude among
them, some of them might relent at the idea of attacking
those who saved them.” ‘
“Not a bit; but .it will prove to them that there are
more in the house than they think for; and we can frighten
some -of them by telling them that the soldiers are near at
hand.”
Jack immediately threw up the easement, and called out
in aloud voice, “Don Silvio! galley-slave! Don Silvio!”
The party hailed turned round, and beheld Jack, Gas-
coigne, and Mesty, standing at the window of the upper
ﬂoor.
“ We have saved you the trouble of announcing us,” called
out Gascoigne. “We are here to receive you.”
“And in three hours the troops will be here, so you must
be quick, Don Silvio,” continued Jack.
“A reveder la,” continued Gascoigne, letting ﬂy his pistol
at Don Silvio. .
The window was then immediately closed. The appearance
of our heroes, and their communication of the speedy arrival
of the troops, was not without effect. The criminals trembled
at the idea; Don Silvio was mad with rage — he pointed out

MR. MIDSHIPMnN EASY. _ ‘ 319
to the men the necessity of immediate attack— the impro-
bability of the troops arriving so soon, and the wealth which
he expected was locked up by Don Rebiera in his mansion.
This rallied them, and they advanced to the doors, which
they attempted to force without success, losing several men
by the occasional ﬁre from those within the house. Finding
their efforts, after half an hour’s repeated attempts, to be
useless, they retreated, and then bringing up a long piece of
timber, which required sixty men to carry it, they ran with
it against the door, and the weight and impetus of the timber
drove it off its hinges, and an entrance was obtained; by this
time it was dark, the lower story had been abandoned, but
the barricade at the head of the stairs opposed their progress.
Convenient loop-holes had been prepared by the defenders,
who now opened a smart ﬁre upon the assailants, the latter
having no means of returning it effectually, had they had
ammunition for their muskets, which fortunately they had
not been able to procure. The combat now became ﬁerce,
and the galley-slaves were several times repulsed with great
loss during a contest of two hours; but, encouraged by Don
Silvio, and refreshed by repeated draughts of wine, they
continued by degrees removing the barriers opposed to
them.
“We shall have to retreat,” exclaimed Don Rebiera;
“very soon they will have torn down all. What do you think,
Signor Easy?”
“Hold this as long as we can. How are we off for ammu-
nition?” -
“Plenty as yet — plenty to last for six hours, I think.”
“What do you say, Mesty?”
“By holy St. Patrig, I say hold out here—they got no
ﬁre-arms — and we ab um at arm-length.”
This decision was the occasion of the ﬁrst defence being
held for two hours more, an occasional relief being aﬂbrded
by the retreat of the convicts to the covered carts.
At last it was evident that the barricade was no longer
tenable, for the heavy pieces of furniture they had heaped

up to oppose entrance, were completely hammered to frag-
ments by poles brought up by the assailants, and used as
battering-rams. The retreat was sounded; they all hastened
to the other story, where the ladies were already placed, and
the galley-slaves were soon in possession of the ﬁrst ﬂoor —
exasperated by the defence, mad with wine and victory, but
ﬁnding nothing.
Again was the attack made upon the second landing, but,
as the stairs were now narrower, and their defences stronger
in proportion, they, for a long while, gained no advantage.
On the contrary, many of their men were wounded, and taken
down below.
The darkness of the night prevented both parties from
seeing distinctly, which was rather in favour of the assailants.
Many climbed over the fortress of piled-up furniture, and
were killed as soon as they appeared on the other side, and,
at last, the only ammunition used was against those who
made this rash attempt. For four long hours did this assault
and defence continue, until daylight came, and then the plan
of assault was altered: they again brought up the poles,
hammered the pieces of furniture into fragments, and gained
ground. The defenders were worn out with fatigue, but
ﬂinched not; they knew that their lives, and the lives of those
dearest_to them, were at stake, and they never relaxed their
exertions; still the criminals, with Silvio at their head, pro-
gressed, the distance between the parties gradually decreased,
and there was but one massive chest of drawers now defend-
ing the landing-place, and over which there was a constant
succession of blows from long poles and cutlasses, returned
_with the buHets from their pistols.
“We must now ﬁght for our lives,” exclaimed Gasqoigne
to Easy, “for what else can we do?”
“Do? — get on the roof and ﬁght there, then,” replied
Jack.
“By-the-bye, that’s well thought of, Jack ,” said Gas-
coigne. “Mesty, up and see if there is any place we can re-
treat to in case of need.”

MR. mnsmrmsu EASY. 321
Mesty hastened to obey, and soon returned with a report
that there was a trap-door leading into the loft under the roof,
and that they could draw the ladder up after them.
“Then we may laugh at them,” cried Jack. “Mesty,
stay here while I and Gascoigne assist the ladies up,” ex-
plaining to the Rebieras and to their domestics why they
went.
Easy and Gascoigne hastened to the signora and Agnes,
conducted them up the ladder into the loft, and requested
them to have no fear; they then returned to the defences on
the stairs, and joined their companions. They found them
hard pressed, and that there was little chance of holding out
much longer; but the stairs were narrow, and the assailants
could not bring their force against them. But now, as the
defences were nearly destroyed. althoughthe convicts could not
reach them with their knives , they brought up a large supply
of heavy stones, which they threw with great force and ex-
ecution. Two of Don Rebiera’s men and Don Martin were
struck down, and this new weapon proved most fatal.
“We must retreat, Jack,” said Gascoigne; “the stones
can do no harm where we are going to. What think you,
Don Philip?”
“I agree with you; let those who are wounded be ﬁrst
carried. up, and then we will follow.”
This was effected, and as soon as the wounded men were
carried up the ladder, and the arms taken up to prevent their
falling into the hands of the assailants, for they were now of
little use to them, the ammunition being exhausted, the whole
body went into the large room which contained the trap-door
of the loft, and, as soon as they were up, they drew the ladder
after them. They had hardly effected this, when they were
followed with the yells and shoutings of the galley-slaves,
who had passed the last barriers, and thought themselves
sure of their prey: but they were disappointed — they found
them more secure than ever.
Nothing could exceed the rage of Don Silvio at the pro-
tracted resistance of the party, and the security of their re-

treat. To get at them was impossible, so he determined to
set ﬁre to the room, and suffocate them, if he could do no
otherwise. He gave his directions to his men, who rushed
down for straw, but in so doing, he carelessly passed under
the trap-door, and Mesty, who had carried up with him two
or three of the stones, dashed one down on the head of Don
Silvio, who fell immediately. He was carried away, but his
orders were put in execution; the room was ﬁlled with straw
and fodder, and lighted. The effects were soon felt; the
trap-door had been shut, but the heat and smoke burst
through; after a time, the planks and rafters took ﬁre, and
their situation was tenible. A small trap-window in the roof,
on the side of the house, was knocked open, and gave them a
temporary relief; but now the rafters burned and crackled,
an the smoke burst on them in thick columns. They could
not see, and with difﬁculty'c_ould breathe. Fortunately the
room below that which had been ﬁred was but one out of
four on the attics, and, as the loft they were in spread over
the whole of the roof, they were able to remove far from it.
The house was slated with massive slate of some hundred-
weight each, and it was not found possible to remove them
so as to give air although frequent attempts were made.
Donna Rebiera sank exhausted in the arms of her husband,
and Agnes fell into those of our hero, who, enveloped in the
smoke,kissed her again and again; and she, poor girl, thinking
that they must all inevitably perish, made no scruple, in
what she supposed her last moment, of returning these proofs
of her ardent attachment. — _
“Massa Easy, help me here, — Massa Gascoigne, come
here. Now heab wid all your might: when we get one off we
get plenty.”
Summoned by Mesty, Jack and Gascoigne put their shoul-
ders to one of the lower slates; it yielded, was disengaged,
and slid down with a loud rattling below. The ladies were
brought to it, and their heads put outside; they soon re-
covered; and now that they had removed one, they found no
difﬁculty in removing others. In a few minutes they were

all with their heads in the open air, but still the house was on
ﬁre below, and they had no chance of escape. It was while
they were debating upon this point, and consulting as to their
chance of safety, that a breeze of wind wafted the smoke
that issued from the roof away from them, and they beheld
the detachment of troops making up to‘the house; a loud
cheer was given, and attracted the notice of the_soldiers.
They perceived Easy and his companions; the house was sur-
rounded and entered in an- instant. * \
The galley-slaves who were in the house, searching for
the treasure reported by Don Silvio to be concealed, were,
captured or killed, and in ﬁve minutes the troops had posses-- -
sion. But how to assist those above was the difﬁculty. The
room below was in ﬂames, and burning ﬁercely. There were
no ladders that could reach so high, and there were‘no means
of‘ getting to them. The commandant made signs from below,
as if to ask what he was to do.
“I see no chance,” observed Don Philip, mourhfully.
“Easy, my dear fellow, and you, Gascoigne, I am sorry that
\
the feuds of our family should have brought you to such a
dreadful death; but what can be done?” _ _
“ I don’t know,” replied J ack, “unless we couldfget ropes.”
“You quite sure, Massa Easy, that all gﬂley rascals below
gone?” asked Mesty. - — .
“Yes,” replied Easy, “you may see that; look at some of
them bound there, under charge of the soldiers.”
“Den, sar, I tink it high time we go too.”
“So do I, Mesty; but how?”
“How? stop a little. Come, help me, Massa Easy; dis
board (for the loft was ﬂoored) is loose; come help, all of
on.”
y They all went, and with united strength pulled up the
board.
“Now strike like hell!— and drive down de plaster,” said
Mesty, commencing the operation.
' In a few minutes they had beaten an opening into one of
the rooms below not on ﬁre, pulled up another board, and

Mesty having fetched the ladder, they all descended in safety,
and, to tire astonishment of the commandant of the troops,
walked out of the door of the house, those who had been
stunned withthe stones having so far recovered as to require
little assistance.
The soldiers shouted as they saw them appear, supporting
the females. The commanding ofﬁcer, who was an intimate
friend of Don Philip, ﬂew to his arms. The prisoners were
carefully examined by Mesty, and Don Silvio was not among
them. He might, however, be among the dead who were left
in the ‘house, which now began to burn furiously. The galley-
slaves who were captured amounted in number to forty-seven.
Their dead they could not count. The major part of the
plunder, and the carts, were still where they had been
drawn up.
As soon as the culprits had been secured, _the attention of
the troops was directed to putting out the ﬂames, but their
attempts were ineffectual; the mansion was burned to the
bare walls, and but little of the furniture saved; indeed, the
major part of it had been destroyed in the attack made by
Don Silvio and his adherents.
Leaving directions with Pedro and his people, that the
property collected by the miscreants should be restored to the
owners, Don Rebiera ordered the horses, and with the whole
party put himself under the protection of the troops, who, as
soon as they had been refreshed, and taken some repose, bent
their way back to Palermo with the galley-slaves, bound and
linked together in a long double row.
They halted when they had gone half-way, and remained
for the night. The next day, at noon, Don Rebiera and his
family were once more in their palazzo, and our two mid-
shipmen and Mesty took their leave, and repaired on board
to make themselves a little less like chimney-sweepers.
Captain Wilson was not out of the ship. Jack made his
report, and then went down below, very much pleased at what
had passed, especially as he would have another long yarn
for the governor on his return to Malta.

CHAPTER XXXII. "
In which our Hero and Gascoigne ought to be ashamed of themselves , and
did feel what might be called Midshipmite Compunction.
Tun Aurora continued three weeks at Palermo, during
which the most active search had been made forthe remainder
of the galley-slaves, and some few had been captured, but
still Don Silvio, and a considerable number, were at large;
and it was said that they had retired to the fastnesses in the
mountains. Our hero was constantly on shore atDonRebiera’s
house, and, after what had passed, he was now looked upon
as soon to become a member of the family. The difference
of religion was overlooked by Don Rebiera and the relations
-—- by all .but the confessor, Father Thomaso, who now began
to agitate and fulminate into the ears of the DonnaRebiera all
the pains and penalties attending heretical connection, such
as excommunication and utter damnation. The effects of his
remonstrances were soon visible, and Jack found that there
was constraint on the part of the old lady, tears on the part
of Agnes, and all father confessors heartily wished at the
devil ten times a-day, on the part of Don Philip and his
brother. At last he wormed the truth out of Agnes, who told
her tale, and wept bitterly. '
“Ned, I don’t much like the appearance of things,” ob-
served Jack; “I must get rid of that Father Thomaso.”
“You’ll ﬁnd that rather difﬁeult,” observed Gascoigne;
“besides, if you were rid of him you would have his place
ﬁlled up with another.”
“He has frightened that poor old woman into the dismals,
and she has the pains of purgatory on her already. I shall
go and talk to Mesty.”
“How can Mesty help you?”
“I don’t know, but you can’t; so, for want of better advice,
I’ll try the Ashantee.”
Our hero went to Mesty, and laid the difﬁcult affair open
to him.

“I see,” said Mesty, showing his ﬁled teeth, “you want
him skull.”
“No, I don’t, Mesty; but I want him out of the way.”
“How that possible, Massa Easy? —- ship sail day, after
to-morrow. Now ’pose I ab time, I soon manage all dat.
Stop a little.”
“ Confound it! but there’s no stopping,” replied Jack.
“Suppose, Massa Easy, you get leave go on shore —not
come oif again.” -
“That will be deserting, Mesty.” ,
“By holy poker, I ab it—you go on shore and break your
leg.”
“Break my leg! —break my leave, you mean?”
“N0, Massa Easy —— you break your leg — den captain
leave you shore, and leave me to take care of you.”
“But why should I break my leg, and how am I to break
my leg?”
“Only pretend break leg, Massa Easy. Go talk Massa
Don Philip, he manage all dat. — Suppose man break his leg
in seven pieces, it is not possible to take him board.”
“Seven pieces, Mesty! that’s rather too many. However,
I’ll think of this.”
Jack then went back and consulted Gascoigne, who ap-
proved of Mesty’s advice, and thought the scheme feasible.
“If we could only pretend that we were thrown out of a
caricola, you break your leg, a compound fracture of course
— I break my arm — both left on shore at sick quarters, with
Mesty to take care of us.”
“Capital indeed,” replied Jack; “I really would not mind
it if it really took place; at all events we’ll overturn the
caricola.”
“But shall we get leave the last day?”
“Yes, it’s two days since I have been on shore, for I have
not liked to go to Don Rebiera’s since what Agnes told me.
Besides, my clothes are all on shore, and that will be an ex-
cuse for a few hours. ’
Our two midshipmen applied for leave the next morning


## p. 327 (#335) ############################################

ma. MIDSHIPMAN EASY. 327
to be off in the afternoon. The ﬁrst-lieutenant gave them
permission. They hastened to the hotel, sent for Don Philip,
and made him a party to their plan. He readily promised
his assistance, for he had resolved that our hero should marry
his sister, and was fearful of the eﬂect of his absence, coupled
with Friar Thomaso’s inﬂuence over his mother. He went to
the surgeon of his regiment, who immediately entered into
the scheme.
Our two midshipmen got into a caricola, rattled up and
down the streets, and perceiving CaptainWilson at his window
ﬂogged the horse into a gallop: when abreast of the barracks
Jack ran the wheel against a bank, and threw himself and
Gascoigne out. Midshipmen are never hurt by these accidents,
but fortunately for the success of the enterprise their faces
were cut and bruised. Don Philip was standing by: he called
the men to pick up our two scamps, carried them into the
barracks, and sent for the _surgeons, who undressed them,
put Jack’s left lg into a multitude of splints, and did the
same to Gascoigne’s arm. They were then put to bed, their
contused faces, with the blood, left ‘in statu quo,’ while Don
Philip sent an orderly, as from the commandant, to Captain
Wilson, to acquaint him that two of his ofﬁcers had been
thrown out of a caricola, and were lying dangerously hurt at
the barracks.
“Good heavens, it must be Mr. Easy and Mr. Gascoigne!”
said Captain Wilson, when the intelligence was communi-
cated; “I saw them galloping down the street like two mad-
men just now. Coxswain, take the gig on board and tell the
surgeon to come on shore immediately, and bring him up to
me at the barracks,”
Captain \Vilson then put on his hat, buckled on his sword,
and hastened to ascertain the extent of the injury. Don
Philip kept out of the way, but the captain was ushered into
the room by one of the ofﬁcers, where he found, in two beds,
our two midshipmen stretched out, the surgeon of the forces
and the regimental surgeon in consultation between them,
while attendants were standing by each bed with restoratives.

The medical gentlemen saluted Captain Wilson, and looked
very grave, talked about f1‘8.0lZl11‘es, contusions, injuries, in the
most interminable nianner— hoped that Mr. Easy would re-
cover — but had doubts. The other gentleman might do well
with care; that is, as far as his arm was concerned, but there
appeared to be a concussion of the brain. Captain Wilson
looked at the cut and blood-smeared faces of the two young
men, and waited with anxiety the arrival of his own surgeon,
who came at last, pufﬁng with the haste he had made, and '
received the report of the brothers of the faculty.
The leg of Mr. Easy fractured in two places — had been
set ‘— bone protruding — impossible to move him. Gascoigne,
arm, compound fracture — contusion of the brain not certain.
Now that all this would have been discovered to be false if
the surgeon had been able to examine, is true; but how could
he not credit the surgeon of the forces and the regimental
surgeon, and how could he put the young men to fresh tortures
by removing splints and unsetting limbs? Politeness, if no-
thing else, prevented his so doing, for it would have been as
much as to say that either he did not credit their report, or
that he doubted their skill. He looked at our hero and his
companion, who kept their eyes closed, and breathed heavily
with their mouths open, put on a grave face, as well as his
brothers in the art, and reported to Captain Wilson.
“But when can they be moved, Mr. Daly?” inquired the
latter; “I cannot wait; we must sail to-morrow, or the next
day at the farthest.”
The surgeon, as in duty bound, put the question to the
others, who replied that there would be great risk in moving
before the fever, which might be expected the next day, and
which might last ten days; but that Captain Wilson had
better not think of removing them, as they should have every '
care and attention where they were, and could rejoin the ship
at Malta. Mr. Daly, the surgeon, agreed that this would be
the most prudent step, and Captain Wilson then gave his
consent.
That being settled, he walked up to the bed of Gascoigne,

\
MR. MIDSHIPMAN EASY. 329
and spoke to him; but Gascoigne knew that he was to have
a concussion of “the brain, and he made no reply, nor gave
any signs of-knowing that Captain Wilson was near him. He
then went to our hero, who, atthe sound of Captain Wilson’s
voice, slowly opened his eyes without_moving his head, and
appeared to recognise him.
“Are you in much pain, Easy?” said the captain, kindly
Easy closed his eyes again, and murmured, “Mesty,
‘Mesty! ”
“He wants his servant, the ship’s corporal, sir,” said the
surgeon. .
“Wel1,” replied Captain Wilson, “_ he had better have
him: he is a faithful fellow, and will nurse him well. When
you go on board, Mr. Daly, desire the ﬁrst~lieutenant to send
Mesty on shore with Mr. Gascoigne’s and Mr. Easy’s chests,
and his own bag and hammock. Good heavens! I would not
for a thousand pounds that this accident had occurred. Poor
foolish boys—they run in couples, and if one’s in a scrape
the other is sure to share it. Gentlemen, I return you many
thanks for your kindness, and I must accept of your promised
care for my unfortunate ofﬁcers. I sail to-morrow at daylight.
You will oblige me by informing their friends, the Rebieras,
of their mischance, as I am sure they will contribute all they
can to their comfort.” So saying, Captain Wilson bowed and
quitted the room, followed by the surgeon.
As soon as the door was closed the two midshipmen turned
their heads round and looked at each other, but they were
afraid to speak at ﬁrst, in case ofthe return of the surgeon.
As soon as it was announced to them that Captain Wilson
and Mr. Daly were outside the barrack-gates, our hero com-
menced — “Do you know, Ned, that my conscience smites
me, and if it had not been that I should have betrayed those
who wish to oblige us, when poor Captain Wilson appeared
so much hurt and annoyed at our accident, I was very near
getting up and telling him of the imposition, to relieve his _
mind.” - -
“1 agree with you, Jack, and I felt much the same — but

330 MR. MIDSHIPMAN nssv.
what’s done cannot be undone. We must now keep up the
imposition for the sake of those who, to help us, have de-
ceived him.”
“ 1 don’t think that you would ﬁnd an English surgeon who
would have consented to such an imposition.”
“No, that is certain; but after all, it is an imposition that
has hurt nobody.”
“Oh, I do not wish to moralise — but I repent of my share
in the deceit; and had it to be done over again I would not
consent to it.”
“Not even for ——? but I won’t mention her name in bar-
racks.”
“I don’t know,” replied Jack; “ but let’s say no more about
it, and thank these gentlemen for their kindness.”
“Yes, but we must keep it up until we see the Aurora
under all sail.”
“And longer too,” replied Jack; “ we must not let the
affair get wind even on shore. We must not recover quickly,
but still appear to recover. Don Rebiera and his wife must
be deceived. I have a plot in my head, but I cannot work it
out clear till I see Mesty.”
Don Philip now came in. He had seen Captain Wilson,
who hadrequested him to look after the two invalids, and
stated his intention to sail the next morning. They consulted
with him, and it was agreed that no one should be acquainted
with the real fact but his brother Martin, and that all Palermo
should be as much deceived as Captain Wilson, for if not, it
would put Father ’1‘homaso on the ‘qui vive,’ and make him
fulminate more than ever. Our midshipmen ate an excellent
dinner, and then remained in bed conversing till it was time
to go to sleep; but long before that, Mesty had made his ap-
pearance with their clothes. The eyes of the Ashantee said
all that was necessary — he never spoke a word, but unlashed
his hammock and lay down in a corner, and they were soon
all three asleep.
The next morning Captain Wilson called to ascertain how
our hero and his companion were, but the room had been

darkened, and he could not see their faces plainly. Easy
thanked him for his kindness in allowing Mesty to attend
them, and having received his orders as to their joining the
ship as soon as they recovered, and having promised to be
very cautious in their behaviour and keep out of all scrapes,
he wished them a speedy recovery, and departed.
In little more than half an hour afterwards, Mesty, who
had been peeping out of the shutters, suddenly threw them
open with a loud laugh.
The Aurora was under way, with studding sails below
and aloft, standing out of the roads. Jack and Gascoigne
got up, threw off the splints, and danced about in their shirts.
As-soon as they were quiet again, Mesty said in a grave tone,
“Den why you stay at sea, Massa Easy?”
“Very true, Mesty, I’ve asked myself that question often
enough lately; because I’m a fool, I suppose.”
“And I, because I can’t help it,” replied Gascoigne;
“never mind, we are on shore now, and I look for a famous
cruise.”
“But ﬁrst we must see what the ground is we are to
cruise on,” replied Jack; “so, Mesty, let us have a palaver,
as they say in your country.”
The two midshipmen got into their beds, and Mesty sat
on the chest between them, looking as grave as a judge. The
question was, how to get rid of the padre Thomaso. Was he
to be thrown over the molehead to the ﬁshes — or his skull
broke — was Mesty’s knife to be resorted to — was he to be
kidnapped or poisoned — or were fair means to be employed
— persuasion, bribery? Every one knows how difﬁcult it is
to get rid of a priest.
‘ As our hero and Grascoigne were not Italians, they thought
that bribery would be the more English-like way of doing
the thing; so they composed a letter, to be delivered by
Mesty to the friar, in which Jack offered to Father ’I‘homaso
the moderate sum of one thousand dollars, provided he would
allow the marriage to proceed, and not frighten the old lady
with ecclesiastical squibs and crackers.

332 MR. MLDSHIPMAN _EASY.
As Mesty was often on shore with Jack, and knew the
friar very well by sight, it was agreed that the letter should
be conﬁded to his charge; but as it was not consistent that a
person in such a state as our hero was represented to be
should sit up and write letters, the delivery was deferred for
a few days, when, after waiting that time, Mesty delivered
the letter to the friar, and made signs that he was to take
back the answer. The friar beckoned him that he was to
accompany him to his room, where he read the letter, and
then again made signs to him to follow him. The friar lcd
thé“way to his monastery, and as soon as Mesty was in his
cell, he summonedanother who could speak English to act'as
interpreter. .
“ Is your master recovering?” _
“Yes,’7 replied Mesty, “he is at present doing well.”
“Have you served him long?”
“No,” replied Mesty.
“Are you very fond of him? does he treat you well, give
you plenty of money?”
At these questions, the artful black conceived that there
was something in the wind, and he therefore very quietly re-
plied, “I do not care much for him.” _ ,
The friar ﬁxed his keen eye upon Mesty, and perceived
there was a savage look about the black, from which he
augured that he was a man who would suit his purpose.
“Your master oifers me a thousand dollars; would you
wish to gain this money for yourself?”
Mesty grinned, and showed his sharp-ﬁled teeth.
“ It would make me a rich man in my own country.”
“It would,” replied the friar; “now you shall have it, if
you will only give your master a small powder.”
“I understand,” replied Mesty; “hab those things in my
country.”
“Well — do you consent? — if so, I will write the letter
to get the money.”
“Suppose they ﬁnd me out?” replied Mesty.

“You will be safe, and you shall be sent away as soon as
possible — say, will you consent?”
“The whole thousand dollars?”
“Every one of them.”
“Den give me the powder!”
“Stay a little,” replied the friar, who went out of the cell,
and, in about ten minutes, retumed with an answer to our
hero’s letter, and a paper containing a greyish powder.
“ Give him this in his soup or anything — spread it on his
meat, or mix it up with his sugar if he eats an orange.”
“I see,” replied Mesty.
.“The dollars shall be yours, I swear it on the holy cross.”
Mesty grinned horribly, took his credentials, and then
asked, “When I come again?”
“As soon as you have received the money bring it to me
at Don Rebiera’s — then give the powder: as soon as it is
given you must let me know, _for you must not remain in Pa-
lermo. I will myself conduct you to a place Qfsafety.”
Mesty then quitted the cell, and was shown out of the mo-
nastery. ‘ ' " _
' “By de holy poker he one d——n rascal!” muttered
Mesty, as he was once in -thgopen air. “But stop a little.”
The Ashantee soon arrived at the-barracks, and repeated
the whole of the conference between himand the. Friar Tho~ _
maso.
“It must be poison, of course,” observed Gascoigne;
“suppose we try it upon some animal?”
“No, Massa Gascoigne,” replied Mesty, “I try~it myself, . '
by-and-bye. Now what we do?” ~_“
“I must give you the order for the thousand dollars, .
Mesty,” replied Jack. -“The rascal here writes tome that‘\
for that sum, he will consent not only not to oppose me, but
agrees to assist my cause; but the great question is, whether
he will keep his word with you, Mesty; if not, I shall lose
my money. So therefore we must now have another palaver,
and argue the point.”
_ The point was argued between Jack and Gascoigne. A

thousand dollars was a large sum, but Jack’s father was a
philosopher. After many pros and cons, it was at last decided
that the money should be given to Mesty; but Mesty should
state, when he took the money to the friar, that he had ad-
ministered the powder, and claim it when he presented it.
The next day, the order for the money was given to
Mesty, and he went to the Friar Thomaso with it. The friar
hastened with Mesty to the monastery, and sent for the inter-
preter.
“You have given it?” inquired the friar.
“Yes —not one hour ago. Here de order for de money.”
“You must run for the money before he is dead, for the
powder is very rapid.”
“And me ,” replied Mesty, apparently much alarmed,
“where am I to go?”
“As soon as you bring the money here, you must go back
to the barracks. Remain there till he is dead, and then re-
turn here. I will have all ready, and take you, as soon as it
is dusk, to a monastery of our order in the mountains, where
no one will think of looking for you, till the affair is blown
over; and then I will ﬁnd you a passage in some vessel out of
the island.”
Mesty hastened for the money, and taking it in a large
bag to the monastery, delivered it to the friar’s charge, and
then returned to the barracks to Easy and Gascoigne. It was
agreed that he should go with the friar, who would probably
remain away some time; indeed, Mesty insisted upon so
doing. Mesty stayed two hours, and then returned about
dusk to the monastery, and reported the death of our hero.
He remained there until it was dark, and then the friar
ordered him to tie the bag of dollars to his saddle-bow. They
mounted two mules, which stood all ready caparisoned, and
quitted Palermo.
In the morning Don Philip, as usual, made his appear-
ance, and told our hero that the friar had been summoned
away by the abbot, and would not return for some time.
“I came to tell you this news,” said Don Philip, “as I

MR. mnsrnrmnn nssv. 335
thought it would please you; the sooner you are now well,
the better. I mean to propose your being both removed to
my father’s palazzo, and then .you can recover your lost
ground during the confessor’s absence.”
“And I have the means,” replied Jack, showing the friar’s
letter. Don Philip read it with astonishment, but was still
more surprised when he heard the whole story from Jack.
He was for a time silent: at last he said, —
“I am sorry for your poor blac .”
“Why so?” replied Jack.
“You will never see him again, depend upon it. A thou-
sand dollars would sign the death warrant of a thousand
blacks; but there is another reason — they will put him out
of the way, that he may not give evidence. Where is the
powder?” '
“Mesty has it; he would not part with it.”
“He is a shrewd fellow, that black; he may be too much
for the friar,” replied Don Philip.
“He means mischief, 1’m sure,” replied Gascoigne.
“Still I feel a great deal of alarm about him,” replied
Easy; “I wish now that I had not let him go.”
“Are you sure that he went?”
“No, I am not; but the friar told him that he should take
him to the mountains as soon as it was dark.”
“And probably he will,” replied Don Philip, “as the best
place to get rid ot him. However, the whole of this story
must be told both to my father and my mother; to the former,
that he may take the right measures, and to my mother, that
it may open her eyes. Give me the copy of the letter you
wrote to the friar, and then I shall have it all.”
The report of the accident which had occurred to Easy
and Gascoigne had been spread and fully believed through-
out Palermo. Indeed, as usual, it had been magniﬁed, and
asserted that they could not recover. To Agnes only had the
case been imparted in conﬁdence by Don Philip, for her dis-
tress at the ﬁrst intelligence had been so great that her bro-
ther could not conceal it.

Two days after Don Philip had made his parents ac-
quainted with the villany of the friar, the midshipmen were
transported to the palazzo, much to the surprise of every-
body, and much to the renown of the surgeons, who were in-
demniﬁed for their duplicity and falsehood by an amazing
extension of their credit as skilful men.
After their arrival at the palazzo, Don Rebiera was also
entrusted with the secret, but it went no farther. As now
there was no particular hurry for our hero to get well, he was
contented and happy in the society of Agnes and her parents;
the old lady, after she had been informed of the conduct of
Friar Thomaso, having turned round in our hero’s favour,
and made a vow never to have a confessor in the house again.
Jack and Gascoigne were now as happy as could be; all
their alarm was about Mesty, for whose return they were
most anxious.
To Don Rebiera, Jack made known formally his intentions
with regard to Agnes. He fully satisﬁed him as to his qual-
iﬁcations and his property, and Don Rebiera was fully aware
of his debt of gratitude to our hero. But all he required was
the consent of Jack’s father, and until this was obtained, he
would not consent to the marriage taking place. Jack at-
tempted to argue the point; his father, he said, had married
without consulting him, and therefore he had a right to marry
without consulting his father. But Don Rebiera, not having
any acquaintance with the rights of man and equality, did
not feel the full force of Jack’s argument, and made it a
‘sine qua non’ that his parents should write and consent to
the alliance before it took place.

011‘ the harbour’s mouth. After breakfast the letters were
brought on shore, and the governor sent for our hero.
“Mr. Easy, here are two letters for you; I am sorry to say,
with black seals. I trust that they do not bring the intelli-
gence of the death of any very near relative.”
Jack bowed without speaking, took the letters, and went
to his room. The ﬁrst he opened was from his father.
“My dear John, — You will be much grieved to hear that
your poor mother, after sitting in the corner for nearly two
years waiting for the millennium, appeared to pine away;
whether from disappointment or not I do not know; but at
last, in spite of all Dr. Middleton could do, she departed this
life; and, as the millennium would not come to her as she
expected, it is to be hoped she is gone to the millennium.
She was a good wife, and I always let her have her own way.
Dr. Middleton does not appear to be satisﬁed as to the cause
of her death, and has wished to examine; but I said no, for I
am a philosopher, and it is no use looking for causes after
eifects; but I have done since her death what she never would
permit me to do during her life. I have had her head shaved,
and examined it very carefully as a phrenologist, and most
curiously has she proved the truth of the sublime science.
I will give you the result. Determination, very prominent;
Benevolence, small; Caution, extreme; Veneration, not very
great; Philo-progenitivencss, strange to say, is very large,
considering she has but one child; Imagination, very strong:
you know, my dear boy, she was always imagining some
nonsense or another. Her other organs were all moderate.
Poor dear creature! she is gone, and we may well wail, for
a better mother or a better wife never existed! And now,
my dear boy, I must request that you call for your discharge,
and come home as soon as possible. I cannot exist without
you, and I require your assistance in the grand work I have
in contemplation. The time is at hand, the cause of equality
will soon triumph; the abject slaves now hold up their heads;
1 have electriﬁed them with my speeches, but I am getting

old and feeble; I require my son to leave my mantle to, as
one prophet did to another, and then I will, like him, ascend
in glory.
“Your affectionate Father,
“N1conumus Easy.”
From this it would appear, thought J ack, that my mother
is dead, and that my father is mad. For some time our hero
remained in a melancholy mood; he dropped many tears to
the memory of his mother, whom, if he had never respected,
he had much loved; and it was not till half an hour had
elapsed, that he thought of opening the other letter. It was
from Dr. Middleton.
“My dear Boy, — Although not a correspondent of yours,
I take the right of having watched you through all your
childhood, and from a knowledge of your disposition, to write
you a few lines. That you have, by this time, discarded
your father’s foolish, nonsensical philosophy, I am very sure.
It was I who advised your going away for that purpose, and I
am sure, that, as a young man of sense, and the heir to a
large property, you will before this have seen the fallacy of .
your father’s doctrines. Your father tells me that he has re-
quested you to come home, and allow me to add any weight
I may have with you in persuading you to do the same. It
is fortunate for you that the estate is entailed, or you might
soon be a beggar, for there is no saying what debts he might,
in his madness, be guilty of. He has already been dismissed
from the magistracy by the lord-lieutenant, in consequence
of his harang11ing the discontented peasantry, and, I may
say, exciting them to acts of violence-and insubordination.
He has been seen dancing and hurraing round a stack ﬁred
by an incendiary. He has turned away his keepers, and
allowed all poachers to go over the manor. In short, he is
not in his senses; and, although I am far from advising
coercive measures, I do consider that it is absolutely neces-
sary that you should immediately return home, and look

after what will one day be your property. You have no oc-
casion to follow the profession with eight thousand pounds
per annum. You have distinguished yourself, — now make
room for those who require it for their subsistence. God
bless you. I shall soon hope to shake hands with you.
“Yours most truly,
“G. Mn>nI.nron.”
There was matter for deep reﬂection in these two letters,
and Jack never felt before how much his father had been in
the wrong. That he had gradually been weaned from his
ideas was true, but still he had, to a certain degree, clung to
them, as we do to a habit; but now he felt that his eyes were
opened; the silly, almost unfeeling letter of his father upon
the occasion of his mother’s death, opened his eyes. For a
long while Jack was in a melancholy meditation, and then
casting his eyes upon his watch, he perceived that it was
almost dinner-time. That he could eat his dinner was certain,
and he scorned to pretend to feel what he did not. He there-
fore dressed himself and went down, grave, it is true, but not
in tears. He spoke little at dinner, and retired as soon as it
was over, presenting his two letters to the governor, and
asking his advice for the next morning. Gascoigne followed
him, and to him he conﬁded his trouble; and Ned, ﬁnding
that Jack was very low-spirited, consoled him to the best of
his power, and brought a bottle of wine which he procured
from the butler. Before they retired to bed, Jack had given
his ideas to his friend, which were approved of, and wishing
him a good night, he threw himself into bed, and was s00u
fast asleep.
“One thing is certain, my good fellow,” observed the
governor to our hero, as he gave him back his letters at the
breakfast table the next morning; “that your father is as
mad as a March hare. I agree with that doctor, who appears
a sensible man, that you had better go home immediately.”
“And leave the service altogether, sir?” replied Jack.
“Why, I must say, that I do not think you exactly ﬁtted


## p. (#348) ################################################

348 MR. MIDSHIPMAN rzssv.
for it. I shall be sorry to lose you, as you have a wonderful
talent for adventure, and I shall have no more yarns to hear
when you return: but, if I understand right from Captain
Wilson, you were brought into the profession because he
thought that the service might be of use in eradicating false
notions, rather than from any intention or necessity of your
following it up as a profession.”
“I suspect that was the case, sir,” replied Jack; “as, for
my own part, I hardly know why I entered it.”
“To ﬁnd a mare’s nest, my lad; I’ve heard all about it;
but never mind that: the question is now about your leaving
it, to look after your own property, and I think I may venture
to say, that I can arrange all that matter at once, without
referringto admiral or captain. I will be responsible for you,
and you may go home in the packet, which sails on Wed-
nesday for England.”
“Thank you, Sir Thomas, I am much obliged to you,”
replied Jack.
“You, Mr. Gascoigne, I shall, of course, send out by the
ﬁrst opportunity to rejoin your ship.”
“Thank you, Sir Thomas, I am much obliged to you,”
replied Gascoigne, making a bow.
“You’ll break no more arms, if you please, sir,” continued
the governor; “a man in love may have some excuse in
breaking his leg, but you had none.”
“I beg your pardon, sir; if Mr. Easy was warranted in
breaking his leg out of love, I submit that I could do no less
than break my arm out of friendship.”
“Hold your tongue, sir, or I’ll break your head from
the very opposite feeling,” replied the governor, good-
humouredly. “But observe, young man, 1 shall keep this
affair secret, as in honour bound; but let me advise you, as
you have only your profession to look to, to follow it up
steadily. It is high time that you and Mr. Easy were
separated. He is independent of the service, and you are
not. A young man possessing such ample means will never
be ﬁtted for the duties of a junior ofﬁcer. He can do no

good for himself , and is certain to do much harm to others:
a continuance of his friendship would probably end in your
ruin, Mr. Gascoigne. You must be aware, that if the greatest
indulgence had not been shown to Mr. Easy by his captain
and ﬁrst-lieutenant, he never could have remained in the
service so long as he has done.”
As the governor made the last remark in rather a severe
tone, our two midshipmen were silent for a minute. At last
Jack observed, very quietly, —
“And yet, sir, I think, considering all, I have behaved
pretty well.”
“ You have behaved very well, my good lad, on all occa-
sions in which your courage and conduct, as an ofﬁcer, have
been called forth. I admit it; and had you been sent to sea
with a mind properly regulated, and without such an un-
limited command of money, I have no doubt but that you
would have proved an ornament to the service. Even now I
think you would, if you were to remain in the service under
proper guidance and necessary restrictions, for you have, at
least, learnt to obey, which is absolutely necessary before
you are ﬁt to command. But recollect, what your conduct
would have brought upon you, if you had not been under the
parental care of Captain Wilson. But let us say no more
about that: a midshipman with the prospect of eight thousand
pounds a-year is an anomaly which the service cannot admit,
especially when that niidshipman is resolved to take to him-
self a wife.”
“I hope that you approve of that step, sir.”
“That entirely depends upon the merit of the party,
which I know nothing of, except that she has a pretty face,
and is of one of the best Sicilian families. I think the dif~
ference of religion 2:. ground of objection.”
“We will argue that point, sir,” replied Jack.
“Perhaps it will be the cause of more argument than you
think for, Mr. Easy; but every man makes his own bed, and
as he makes it, so must he lie down in it.”

350 MR. MIDSHIPMAN EASY.
“What am I to do about Mesty, sir? I cannot bear the
idea of parting with him.”
“I am afraid that you must; I cannot well interfere
there.”
“He is of little use to the service, sir; he has been sent
to sick quarters as my servant: if he may be permitted to
go home with me, I will procure his discharge as soon as
I arrive, and send him on board the guard-ship till I ob-
tain it.”
“I think that, on the whole, he is as well out of the service
as in it, and'therefore I will, on consideration, take upon
myself the responsibility, provided you do as you say.”
The conversation was here ended, as the governor had
business to attend to, and Jack and Gascoigne went to their
rooms to make their arrangements.
“The governor is right,” observed Gascoigne; “it is
better that we part, Jack. You have half unﬁtted me for the
service already; I have a disgust of the midshipmen’s berth;
the very smell of pitch and tar has become odious to me.
This is all wrong; I must forget you and all our pleasant,
cruises on shore, and once more swelter in my greasy jacket.
When I think that, if om‘ pretended accidents were dis-
covered, I should be dismissed the service, and the misery
which that would cause to my poor father, I tremble at my
escape. The governor is right, Jack; we must part, but I
hope you never will forget me.”
“My hand upon it, N ed. Command my interest, if ever
I have any — my money — what I have, and the house,
whether it belongs to me or my father — as far as you
are concerned at least, I adhere to my notions of perfect
equality.”
“And abjure them, I trust, Jack, as a universal prin-
ciple.”
“I admit, as the governor asserts, that my father is as
mad as a March hare.”
“That is sufﬁcient; you don’t know how glad it makes
me to hear you say the. .”

The two friends were inseparable during the short time
that they remained together. They talked over their future
prospects, their hopes and anticipations, and when the con-
versation ﬂaggcd, Gascoigne brought up the name of Agnes.
Mesty’s delight at leaving the service, and going home
with his patron was indescribable. He laid out a portion of
his gold in a suit of plain clothes, white linen shirts, and in
every respect the wardrobe of a man of fashion; in fact, he
was now a complete gentleman’s gentleman; was very par-
ticular in frizzing his woolly hair — wore a white neck-cloth,
gloves , and cane. Every one felt inclined to laugh when he
made his appearance; but there was something in Mesty’s
look, which, at all events, prevented their doing so before
his face. The day for sailing arrived. Jack took leave of
the governor, thanking him for his great kindness, and
stating his intention of taking Malta in his way out to Pa-
lermo in a month or two. Gascoigne went on board with him,
and did not go down the vessel’s side till it was more than a
mile clear of the harbour.

Satisfaction of our Hero, and it is to be presumed to that also of the

Ar last the packet anchored in Falmouth Roads. Jack,
accompanied by Mesty, was soon on shore with his luggage,
threw himself into the mail, arrived in London, and, waiting
there two or three days, to obtain what he considered ne-
cessary from a fashionable tailor, ordered a chaise to Forest
Hill. He had not written to his father to announce his arri-
val, and it was late in the morning when the chaise drew up
at his father’s door. .
Jack stepped out and rang the bell. The servants who
opened the door did not know him; they were not the same
as those he left.
“Where is Mr. Easy?” demanded Jack.


## p. (#352) ################################################

352 MR. MIDSHIPMAN sssv.
“Who are you?” replied one of the men, in a gruff tone.
“By de powers, you very soon ﬁnd out who he is,” ob-
served Mesty.
“Stay here, and I’ll see if he is at home.”
“Stay here! stay in the hall like a footman? What do
you mean, you rascal?” cried Jack, attempting to push by
the man. .
“O, that won’t do here, master; this is Equality Hall;
one man’s as good as another.”
“Not always,” replied Jack, knocking him down. “Take
that for your insolence, pack up your traps, and walk out of
the house to-morrow morning.”
Mesty, in the meantime, had seized the other by the
throat.
“What I do with this fellow, Massa Easy?”
“Leave him now, Mesty: we’ll settle their account to-
morrow morning. I presume I shall ﬁnd my father in the
library.”
“His father!” said one of the men to the other; “he’s not
exactly a chip of the old block.”
“We shall have a change, I expect,” replied the other,
as they walked away.
“Mesty,” cried Jack, in an authoritative tone, “bring
those two rascals back to take the luggage out of the chaise;
pay the postilion, and tell the housekeeper to show you my
room and yours. Come to me for orders as soon as you have
done this.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Mesty. “Now come here, you d—n
blackguard, and take tings out of chaise, or by de holy
poker I choak your luff, both of you.”
The ﬁled teeth, the savage look, and determination of
Mesty, had the due effect. The men sullenly returned, and
unloaded the chaise. In the meantime, Jack walked into his

CHAPTER XXXII1.
In which Mesty should be called throughout Mephistopheles, for it abounds
in black Cloaks, Disguises, Daggers, and dark Deeds.
On the fourth evening after the removal of our two mid-
shipmen to the palazzo of Don Rebiera, as they were sitting
in company with Agnes and Don Philip in their own room, a
friar made his appearance at the door. They all started, for
by his height they imagined him to be the Friar Thomaso,
but no one addressed him. The friar shut the door without
saying a word, and then lifting up his cowl, which had been
drawn over it, discovered the black face of Mesty. Agnes
screamed, and all sprang from their seats at this unusual and
unexpected apparition. Mesty grinned, and there was that in
his countenance which said that he had much to com-
municate.
“ Where is the friar, Mesty?” inquired Easy.
“Stop a little, Massa — suppose we loek door ﬁrst, and
den I tell all.”
Taking this precaution, Mesty threw off the friar’s gown,
and appeared in his own dress, with the bag of dollars slung
round his body.
“Now, Massa Easy, I hab a long tory to tell — so I tink I
better begin at the beginning.”
“It is the most approved method,” replied Jack; “but
stop when I hold up my ﬁnger, that we may translate what
you say to the lady and Don Philip.”
“Dat all right, sar. Friar and I get on two mule as soon
as it quite dark. He make me carry all tousand dollars —
and we ride out of town. We go up mountain and mountain,
but the moon get up shine and we go on chece by jowl — he
nebber say one word, and I nebber say one word, ’cause I no
speak his lingo, and he no understand my English. About
two o’clock, in de morning, we stop at a house and stay dere
till eight o’clock, and den we go on again all next day, up all
mountain, only stop once, eat a bit bread and drink lilly wine.

Second night come on, and den we stop again, and people
how very low to him, and woman bring in rabbit for make
supper. I go in the kitchen, woman make stew smell very
nice, so I nod my head, and I say very good, and she make a
face, and throw on table black loaf of bread and garlic, and
make sign dat for my supper; good enough for black fellow,
and dat rabbit stew for friar. Den I say to myself, stop a
little; suppose friar hab all de rabbit, I tink I give him a lilly
powder.”
“The powder, Mesty?” exclaimed Jack. -
“What does he say?” inquired Don Philip.
Gascoigne translated all that Mesty had communicated.
The interest of the narrative now became exciting. Mesty
continued: —
“Well, Massa Easy, den woman she go for dish to put
stew in, and I take de powder and drop it in de pot, and den
I sit down again and eat black bread, she say good enough
for black man. She tir up de stew once more, and den she
pour it out into dish, and take it to friar. He lick um chops,
by all de powers, and he like um so well he pick all de bones,
and wipe up gravy with him bread. You tink it very nice,
Massa Friar, tink I; but stop a little. After he drink a whole
bottle of wine, he tell em bring mules to de door, and he put
him hands on de woman head, and dat de way he pay for him
supper.
“The moon shone bright, and we go up all mountain, al-
ways go up, and ’bout two hour, he get off him mule and he
put him hand so, and set down on de rock. He twist, and he
turn, and he groan, for half an hour, and den he look at me,
as much as to say, you black villain, you do this? for he not
able to speak, and den I pull out de paper of de powder, and
I show him, and make him sign he swallow it: he look again,
and I laugh at him — and he die.”
“Oh, Mesty, Mesty,” exclaimed our hero; “you should not
have done that, — there will mischief come from it.”
“Now he dead, Massa Easy, so much less mischief.”

Philip.
Gascoigne then interpreted to Don Philip and Agnes, the
former of whom looked very grave, and the latter terriﬁed.
“Let him go on,” said Don Philip; “I am most anxious to
hear what he did with the body.”
Mesty, at the request of our hero, proceeded: “Den I
thought what I should do, and I said I would hide him, and I
tink I take his coat for myself — so I pull oﬁ” him coat and I
pull oif all his oder clothes — he not wear many — and I take
the body in my arm, and carry him where I ﬁnd a great split
in de rock above all road. I throw him in, and den I throw
plenty large pieces rock on him till I no see him any more;
den I take de two mules and get on mine wid de dollars,
and lead the other three four mile, till I come to a large
wood — take oﬂ’ him saddle and bridle , turn him adrift.
Den I tear up all clothes all in lilly bits, hide one piece
here, noder piece dere, and de saddle and bridle in de bush.
All right, now, I say; so I put on friar cloak, hide my face,
get on my mule, and den I look where I shall go — so I say,
I not be in dis road anyhow. I passed through wood till I
ﬁnd nother. I go ’bout two mile — moon go down, all dark,
and ﬁve six men catch hold my bridle, and they all got arms,
so I do nothing — they speak to me, but I no answer, and
neber show my face. They ﬁnd all dollars (d—n um) fast
enough, and they lead me away through the wood. Last we
come to large ﬁre in de wood, plenty of men lie ‘bout, some
eat and some drink. They pull me off, and I hold down my
head and fold my arms, just like friar do. They bring me
along to one man, and pour out all my dollar before him. He
give some order, and they take me away, and I peep through
the cloak, and I say to myself, he that d—n galley- slave
rascal Don Silvio.”
“Don Silvio!” cried Jack.
“What does he say of Don Silvio?” demanded Don
Mesty’s narrative was again translated, and he continued.
“Dey led me away ‘bout ﬁfty yards, tie me to tree, and
den they leave me, and dey all drink and make merry, neber

offer me anything, so I hab noting den to eat; I eat de ropes
and gnaw them through, and den I stay there two hour until all
go asleep, and all quiet; for I say to myself, stop a little. Den
when dey all fast asleep, I take out my knife and I crawl
‘long de ground, as we do in our country sometimc—and den
I stop and look ‘bout me; no man watch but two, and dey
look out for squarl, not look in board where I was. I crawl
’gain till I lay down ’longside that d—n galley-slave Don
Silvio. He lie fast asleep with my bag thousand dollars under
him head. So I tink, ‘you not hab dem long, you rascal.’ I
look round — all right, and I drive my knife good aim into
him heart and press toder hand on him mouth, but he make
no noise; he struggle little and look up, and den I throw oif
de head of de gown and show him my black face,’and he look
and he try to speak; but I stop dat, for down go my knife
again, and de d—n galley-slave dead as herring.”
“Stop, Mesty, we must tell this to Don Philip,” said Gas-
coigne.
“Dead! Don Silvio dead! well, Mesty, we are eternally
obliged to you, for there was no safety for my father while he
was living. Let him go on.”
“ So when I put de knife through his body, I lie down by
him, as if noting had happened, for ten minute, and den I
take de bag of dollars from under him head, and den I feel
him all over, and I ﬁnd him pistols and him purse, which I
hab here, all gold. So I take them and I look — all asleep,
and I crawl back to de tree. Den I stay to tink a little; de
man on watch come up and look at me, but he tink all right
and he go away again. Lucky ting, by de power, dat I go
back to tree. I wait again, and den I crawl and crawl till I
clear of all, and den I take to my heel and run for um life,
till daylight come, and don I so tired I lie down in bush: I
stay in bush all day, and den I set off again back here, for I
ﬁnd road and know my way. I not eat den for one day and
one night, and come to house where I put my head in and
ﬁnd woman there. I not able to speak, so I help myself, and
not show my face. She not like dat and make a bobbery, but

1 lift up my cloak and show my black face and white teeth,
and den she tink me de debil. She run out of de house and I
help myself very quick, and den set off and come close here
yesterday morning. I hide myself all day and come in at
night, and now, Massa Easy, you ab all de whole truth—and
you ab your tousand dollars — and you ab got rid of de ras-
cal friar and de d—n galley-slave, Don Silvio.”
“Tell them all this, N cd,”said Jack, who, whilst Gascoigne
was so employed, talked with Mesty.
“ I was very much frightened for you, Mesty,” said Jack;
“but still I thought you quite as cunning as the friar, and so
it has turned out; but the thousand dollars ought to be
yours.”
“No, sar,” replied Mesty, “the dollars not mine; but 1
hab plenty of gold in Don Silvio’s purse — plenty, plenty
of gold. I keep my property, Massa Easy, and you keep
yours.”
“I’m afraid that this affair may be found out, Mesty; the
woman will spread the report of having been attacked by a
black friar, and that will lead to suspicion, as the other friars
of the convent knew that you left with Friar Thomaso.”
“ So I tink dat, but when a man starve, he quite forget his
thought.”
“I don’t blame you; but now I must talk to Don Philip.”
“Suppose you no objection, while you talk I eat something
from the table then, Massa Easy, for I hungry enough to eat
de friar, mule and all.”
“Eat, my good fellow, and drink as much as you please.”
The consultation between our two midshipmen and Don
Philip was not long: they perceived the immediate necessity
for the departure of Mesty, and the suspicion which would
attach to themselves. Don Philip and Agnes left them, to go
toDon Rebiera, and make him acquainted with what had passed,
and to ask his advice.
When they went into the room, Don Rebiera immediately
accosted his son.


## p. 342 (#358) ############################################

342 MR. MJDSHIPMAN EnSY.
“Have you heard, Philip, that Friar Thomaso has re-
turned at last? — so the servants tell Inc.”
“The report may be fortunate,” replied Don Philip; “but
I have another story to tell you.”
He then sat down and imparted to Don Rebiera all the ad-
ventures of Mesty. Don Rebiera was for some time in deep
thought; at last he replied, —
“That Don Silvio is no more is fortunate, and the negro
would be entitled to reward for his destruction — but for the
friar, that is a bad business. The negro might remain and tell
the whole story, and the facts might be proved by the evidence
of Signor Easy, and the letters; but what then? we should
raise the whole host of the clergy against our house, and we
have suffered too much from them already; the best plan would
be the immediate departure, not only of the negro, but of our
two young friends. The supposition of Friar Thomaso being
here, and their departure with the negro servant to rejoin
their ship, will remove much suspicion and destroy all inquiry.
They must be off immediately. Go to them, Philip, and point
out to them the absolute necessity of this measure, and tell our
young friend that I rigidly adhere to my promise, and as soon
as he has his father’s sanction I will bestow upon him my
daughter. In the meantime I will send down and see if a
vessel can be chartered for Malta.”
Our hero and Gascoigne fully admitted the wisdom of this
measure, and prepared for their departure; indeed, now that
Don Rebiera’s resolution had been made known to our here,
he cared more for obtaining his father’s consent than he did
for remaining to enjoy himself at Palermo; and before noon
of the next day all was ready, the vessel had been procured,
Jack took his leave of Agnes and her mother, and, acgom-
panied by Don Rebiera and Don Philip (for Don Martin was
on duty a few miles from Palermo), went down to the beach,
and, having bid them farewell, embarked withGascoigne and
Mesty on board of the two-masted latteen which had been
engaged, and before sunset not a steeple of Palermo was to
be seen.

“What are you thinking of, Jack?” said Gascoigne, after
our hero had been silent half an hour.
“I have been thinking, Ned, that we are well out of it.”
“So do I,” replied Gascoigne; and here the conversation
dropped for a time.
“What are you thinking of now, Jack?” said Gascoigne,
after a long pause.
“I’ve been thinking that I‘ve a good story for the old
governor.”
“Very true, replied Gascoigne; and both were again
silent for some time.

“What are you thinking of now, Jack?” said Gascoigne,
after another long interval.
“I’ve been thinking that I shall leave the service,” re-
plied Jack.
“I wish you would take me with you,” replied Gascoigne,
with a sigh; and again they were both in deep contempla-
tion.
“What are you thinking of now, Jack?” said Gascoigne
again.
“Of Agnes,” replied our her.
“Well, if that’s the case, I’ll call you when suppcr’s ready.
in the meantime l’ll go and talk with Mesty.”
CHAPTER XXXIV.
Jack leaves the Service, in which he had no Business, and goes home to
mind his own Business.
On the fourth day they arrived at Malta, and our two
midshipmen, as soon as they had settled with the padrone of
the vessel, went up to the government house. They found
the governor in the veranda, who held out both his hands, one
to each. .
“Glad to see you, my lads. Well, Jack, how’s the leg —
all right? don’t limp? And your arm, Gascoigne?”
“All right, sir, and as sound as ever it was,” replied they
both.

“Then you’re in luck, and have made more haste than
you deserve, after your mad pranks; but now sit down, and I
suppose, my friend Jack, you have a story to tell me.”
“O yes, Sir Thomas, and a very long one.”
“Then I won’t have it now, for I expect people on busi-
ness; we’ll have it after dinner. Get your things up and take
possession of your rooms. The Aurora sailed four days ago.
You’ve had a wonderful recovery.”
“Wonderful, sir!” replied our hero; “all Palermo rings
with it.”
“Well, you may go now — I shall see you at dinner.
Wilson will be delighted when he hears that you have got
round again, for he was low-spirited about it, I can tell you,
which is more than you deserve.”
“He’s right there,” said our hero to Gascoigne, as they
walked away.
When dinner was over, Jack narrated to the governor the
adventures of Mesty, with which he was much interested; but
when they were quite alone in the evening, the governor
called our two midshipmen into the veranda, and said, —
“Now, my lads, I’m not going to preach, as the saying is,
but I’ve been long enough in the world to know that a com-
pound fracture of the leg is not cured in fourteen or sixteen
days. I ask you to tell me the truth. Did not you deceive
Captain Wilson on this point?”
“I am ashamed to say that we did, sir,” replied Easy.
“How did you manage that, and why?”
Jack then went into further details relative to himself and
his amour, stating his wish to be left behind, and all that had
passed.
“Well, there’s some excuse for you, but none for the sur-
geons. If any surgeon here had played such a trick, I would
have hung him, as sure as I’m governor. This affair of yours
has become serious. Mr. Easy, we must have some conversa-
tion on the matter to-morrow morning.-”
The next morning the packet from England was reported

of his son. The cast of the skull was divided into many com-
partments, with writing on each; but what most astonished
our hero was the alteration in the apartment. The book-
cases and books had all been removed, and in the centre,
suspended from the ceiling, was an apparatus which would
have puzzled any one, composed of rods in every direction,
with screws at the end of them, and also tubes in equal
number, one of which communicated with a large air-pump,
which stood on a table. Jack took a short survey, and then
walked up to his father and accosted him.
“ What! ” exclaimed Mr. Easy, “is it possible? — yes, it
is my son John! I’m glad to see you, John, — very glad in-
deed,” continued the old gentleman, shaking him by both
hands—“very glad that you have come home: I wanted you
— wanted your assistance in my great and glorious project,
which, I thank Heaven, is now advancing rapidly. Very
soon shall equality and the rights of man be proclaimed
everywhere. The pressure from without is enormous, and
the bulwarks of our ridiculous and tyrannical constitution
must give way. King, lords, and aristocrats; landholders,
tithe-collectors, church and state, thank God, will soon be
overthrown, and the golden age revived — the millennium,
the true millennium — not what your poor mother talked
about. I am at the head of twenty-nine societies, and if my
health lasts, you will see what I will accomplish now that I
have your assistance, Jack;” and Mr. Easy’s eyes sparkled
and ﬂashed in all the brilliancy of incipient insanity.
Jack sighed, and to turn the conversation he observed,
“You have made a great change In this room, sir. What
may all this be for? Is it a machine to improve equality and
the rights of man?”
“My dear son," replied Mr. Easy sitting down and
crossing his legs complacently, with his two hands under his
right thigh, according to his usual custom, when much
pleased with himself, — “why, my dear son, that is not
exactly the case, and yet you have shown some degree of
perception even in your guess; for if my invention succeeds,

(and I have no doubt of it,) I shall have discovered the great
art of rectifying the mistakes of nature, and giving an
equality of organisation to the whole species, of introducing
all the ﬁner organs of humanity, and of destroying the baser.
It is a splendid invention, Jack, very splendid. They may
talk of Gall and Spurzheim, and all those; but what have
they done? nothing but divided the brain into sections,
classed the organs, and discovered where they reside; but
what good result has been gained from that? the murderer
by nature remained a murderer — the benevolent man, a
benevolent man —he could not alter his organisation. I have
found out how to change all that.”
“Surely, sir, you would not interfere with the organ of
benevolence ? ”
“But indeed I must, Jack. I, myself, am suffering from
my organ of benevolence being too large: I must reduce it,
and then I shall be capable of greater things, shall not be so
terriﬁed by difﬁculties, shall overlook triﬂes, and only carry
on great schemes for universal equality and the supreme
rights of man. I have put myself into that machine every
morning for two hours, for these last three months, and I feel
now that I am daily losing a great portion.”
“Will you do me the favour to explain an invention so
extraordinary, sir?” said our hero.
“Most willingly, my boy. You observe that in the centre
there is a frame to conﬁne the human head, somewhat larger
than the head itself, and that the head rests upon the iron
collar beneath. When the head is thus ﬁrmly ﬁxed, suppose
I want to reduce the size of any particular organ, I take the
boss corresponding to where that organ is situated in the
cranium, and ﬁx it on it. For you will observe that all the
bosses inside of the top of the frame correspond to the organs
as described in this plaster cast on the table. I then screw
down pretty tight, and increase the pressure daily, until the
organ disappears altogether, or is reduced to the size re-
quired.”
“I comprehend that part perfectly, sir,” replied Jack;

"but now explain to me by what method you contrive to raise
an organ which does not previously exist.”
“ That,” replied Mr. Easy, “is the greatest perfection of
the whole invention, for without I could do that, I could have
done little. I feel convinced that this invention of mine will
immortalise me. Observe all these little bell-glasses which
communicate with the air-pump; I shave my patient’s head,
grease it a little and ﬁx on the bell-glass, which is exactly
shaped to ﬁt the organ in length and breadth. I work the
air-pump, and raise the organ by an exhausted receiver. It
cannot fail. There is my butler, now; a man who escaped
hanging last spring assizes on an undoubted charge of murder.
I selected him on purpose; I have ﬂattened down murder to
nothing, and I have raised benevolence till it’s like a wen.”
“I am afraid my poor father’s head is an exhausted re-
ceiver,” thought Jack, who then replied, “Well, sir, if it suc_‘
ceeds it will be a good invention.” _
“If it succeeds! — why, it has succeeded — it cannot fail.
It has cost me near two thousand pounds. By-the-bye, Jack,
you have drawn very liberally lately, and I had some trouble,
with my own expenses, to meet your bills; not that I com-
plain—but what with societies, and my machine, and tenants
refusing to pay their rents, on the principle that the farms
are no more mine than theirs, which I admit to be true, I
have had some difﬁculty in meeting all demands.”
“The governor was right,” thought Jack, who now in-
quired after Dr. Middleton.
“Ah, poor silly man! hc’s alive yet — I believe doing
well. He is one who will interfere with the business of others.
complain: of my servants—very silly man indeed — but I
let him have his own way. So I did your poor mother. Silly
woman, Mrs. Easy — but never mind that.”
“If you please, sir, I have {also a complaint to make of
the servants for their insolence to me: but we will adjourn, if
you please, as I wish to have some refreshment.”
“Certainly, Jack, if you are hungry; I will go with you.

mistake—they are all shaved, and wear wigs, and I put
them in the machine every other morning; but I mean to
make an alteration in one respect. You observe, Jack, it re-
quires more dignity: we must raise the whole machinery some
feet, ascend it with state as a throne, for it is the throne of
reason, the victory of mind over nature.”
“As you please, sir; but I am really hungry just now.”
J ack and his father went into the drawing-room and rang
the bell; not being answered, Jack rose and rang again.
“My dear sir,” observed Mr. Easy, “you must not be in a
hurry; every man naturally provides for his own wants ﬁrst,
and afterwards for those of others. Now my servants — —”
“Are a set of insolent scoundrels, sir, and insolence I never
permit. I knocked one down as I entered your house, and,
with your permission, I will discharge two, at least, to-
morrow.”
“My dear son,” exclaimed Mr. Easy, “you knocked my
servant down! —are you not aware, by the laws of equal-
in
“I am aware of this, my dear father,” replied Jack, “that
by all the laws of society we have a right to expect civility
and obedience from those we pay and feed.”
“Pay and feed! Why, my dear son, —my dear Jack, —-
you must recollect —”
“I recollect, sir, very well; but if your servants do not
come to their recollection in a very short time, either I or
they must quit the house.”
“But, my dear boy, have you forgotten the principles I
instilled into you? Did you not go to sea to obtain that
equality foiled by tyranny and despotism here on shore? Do
you not acknowledge and support my philosophy?”
“We’ll argue that point to-morrow, sir — at present I
want to obtain my supper;” and Jack rang the bell furiously.
The butler made his appearance at this last summons,
and he was followed by Mesty, who looked like a demon with
anger. < .
“Mercy on me, whom have we here?”

“My servant, father,” exclaimed Jack, starting up; “one
that I can trust to, and who will obey me. Mesty, I wish
some supper and wine to be brought immediately — see that
scoundrel gets it ready in a moment. If he does not, throw
him out of the door, and lock him out. You understand me.”
“ “Yes, massa,” grinned Mesty; “now you hab supper very
quick, or Mesty know the reason why. Follow me, sar,” cried
Mesty, in an imperative tone to the butler: “quick, sar, or by
de holy poker, I show you what Mesty can do;” and Mesty
grinned in his wrath.
“Bring supper and wine immediately,” said Mr. Easy,
giving an order such as the butler had never heard since he
had been in the house.
The butler quitted the room, followed by the Ashantee.
“My dear boy -— my Jack — I can make every allowance
for hunger, it is often the cause of theft and crime in the
present unnatural state of society — but really you are too
violent. The principles --—”
“Your principles are all confounded nonsense, father,”
cried Jack, in a rage.
“What, Jack! — my son — what do I hear? This from
you —nonsensel Why, J ack, what has Captain Wilson been
doing with you?”
“Bringing me to my senses, sir.”
“Oh dear! oh dear! my dear Jack, you will certainly
make me lose mine.”
“G-one already,” thought Jack.
“ That you, my child, so carefully brought up in the great
and glorious school of philosophy, should behave this way —
should be so violent — forget your sublime philosophy, and
all — just like Esau, selling your birthright for a mess of
pottage. Oh, Jack, you’ll kill me! and yet I love you, Jack
»- whom else have I to love in this world? Never mind, we’ll
argue the point, my boy — I’ll convince you .— in a week all
will be right again.”
“It shall, sir, if I can manage it,” replied Jack.
“ That’s right, I love to hear you say so—that’s consoling,

very consoling — but I think now, I was wrong to let you go
to sea, Jack.”
“Indeed you were not, father.”
“Well, I’m glad to hear you say so; I thought they had
ruined you, destroyed all your philosophy —but it will be all
right again — you shall come to our societies, Jack — I am
president — you shall hear me speak, Jack — you shall hear
me thunder like Demosthenes — but here comes the tray.”
The butler, followed by Mesty, who attended him as if he
was his prisoner, now made his appearance with the tray,
laid it down in a sulky manner and retired. Jack desired
Mesty to remain.
“Well, Mesty, how are they getting on in the servants’
hall?”
“Regular mutiny, sar — ab swear dat they no stand our
nonsense, and dat we both leave the house to-morrow.”
“Do you hear, sir? your servants declare that I shall leave
your house to-morrow.”
“You leave my house, Jack, after four years’ absence! —-
no, no. I’ll reason with them—I’ll make them a speech. You
don’t know how I can speak, Jack.”
“Look you, father, I cannot stand this; either give me a.
carte-blanche to arrange this household as I please, or I shall
quit it myself to-morrow morning.”
“Quit my house, Jack! no, no — shake hands and make
friends with them, be civil, and they will serve you — but
you know, upon the principles —— ”
“Principles of the devil!” cried Jack, in a rage.
“Of the devil, Jack; dear me! I wish you had never gone
to sea.”
“In one word, sir, do you consent, or am I to leave the
house?”
“Leave the house! 0 no; not leave the house, Jack. 1

not send away my murderer, for I must have him cured, and
shown as a proof of my wonderful invention.”

“ Mesty, get my pistols ready for to-morrow morni:
your own too — do ye hear?”
“All ready, massa,” replied Mesty; “I tink dat rig--.
“Right! — pistols, Jack! What do you mean?”
“It is possible, father, that you may not have yet quite
cured your murderer, and therefore it is as well to be pre-
pared. I will now wish you good night; but before I go, you
will be pleased to summon one of the servants, that he may
inform the others that the household is under my control for
the future.”
The bell was again rung, and was this time answered with
more expedition. Jack told the servant, in presence of his
father, that, with the consent of the latter, he should here-
after take the whole control of the establishment, and that
Mesty would be the major-domo from whom they would re-
ceive their orders. The man stared, and cast an appealing
look to Mr. Easy, who hesitated, and at last said —
“Yes, William; you’ll apologise to all, and say that I have
made the arrangement.”
“You apologise to none, sir,” cried Jack; “but tell them
that I will arrange the whole business to-morrow morning.
Tell the woman to come here and show me my bed-room.
Mesty, get your supper and then come up to me; if they dare
to refuse you, recollect who does, and point them out to-
morrow morning. That will do, sir; away with you, and bring
ﬂat candlesticks.”
CHAPTER XXXVI.
In which Jack takes up the other Side of the Argument, and proves that he
can argue as well on one Side as the other.
Tms scene may give some idea of the state of Mr. Easy’s
household upon our hero’s arrival. The poor lunatic, for
such we must call him, was at the mercy of his servants, who
robbed, laughed at, and neglected him. The waste and ex-
pense were enormous. Our hero, who found how matters

stood, went to bed, and lay the best part of the night revolving
what to do. He determined to send for Doctor Middleton,
and consult him.
The next morning, Jack rose early; Mesty was in the room
with warm water, as soon as he rang.
“By de power, Massa Easy, your fader very silly old
man.”
“I’m afraid so,” replied Jack.
“He not right here,” observed Mesty, putting his ﬁngers
to his head.
Jack sighed, and desired Mesty to send one of the grooms
up to the door. When the man,knocked he desired him to
mount a horse and ride over to Dr. Middleton, and request
his immediate attendance.
The man, who was really a good servant, replied, “Yes,
sir,” very respectfully, and hastened away.
Jack went down to breakfast, and found it all ready, but
his father was not in the room: he went to his study, and
found him occupied, with a carpenter who was making a sort
of a frame as the model of the platform or dais, to be raised
under the wonderful invention. Mr. Easy was so busy that
he could not come to breakfast, so Jack took his alone. An
hour after this, Doctor Middleton’s carriage drove up to the
door. The Doctor heartily greeted our hero.
“My dear sir — for so I suppose I must now call you —I
am heartily glad that you have returned. I can assure you
that it is not a moment too soon.”
“I have found out that already, Doctor,” replied Jack;
“sit down. Have you breakfasted?”
“No, I have not; for I was so anxious to see you, that I
ordered my carriage at once.”
“Then sit down, Doctor, and we will talk over matttr:
quietly.”
“You of course perceive the state of your father. He has
been some time quite unﬁt to manage his own affairs.”
“So I am afraid.”

“What do you intend to do, then—put them in the hands
of trustees?”
“I will be trustee for myself, Doctor Middleton. I could
not do the other without submitting my poor father to a pro-
cess, and conﬁnement, which I cannot think of.”
“I can assure you, that there are not many in Bedlam
worse than he is; but I perfectly agree with you; that is, if
he will consent to your taking charge of the property.”
“A power of attorney will be all that is requisite,” re-
plied Jack; “that is, as soon as I have rid the house of the
set of miscreants who are in it; and who are now in open
mutiny.”
“I think,” replied the Doctor, “that you will have some
trouble. You know the character of the butler.”
“Yes, I have it from my father’s own mouth. I really
should take it as a great favour, Doctor Middleton, if you
could stay here a day or two. I know that you have retired
from practice.”
“I would have made the same offer, my young friend. 1
will come here with two of my servants; for you must dis-
charge these.”
“I have one of my own who is worth his weight in gold
—- that will be sufficient. I will dismiss every man you think
I ought; and as for the women, we can give them warning,
and replace them at leisure.”
“That is exactly what I should propose,” replied the
Doctor. “I will now go, if you please, procure the assistance
of a couple of constables, and also of your father’s former
legal adviser, who shall prepare a power of attorney.”
“Yes,”repliedJack, “and we must then ﬁnd out the tenants
who refuse to pay upon the principles of equality, and he
shall serve them with notice immediately.”
“I am rejoiced, my dear young friend, to perceive that
your father’s absurd notions have not taken root.”
“They lasted some time, nevertheless, Doctor,” replied
Jack, laughing.
“Well, then, I will only quit you for an hour or two, and

then, as you wish it, will take up my quarters here as long as
you ﬁnd me useful.”
In the forenoon, Dr. Middleton again made his appearance,
accompanied by Mr. Hanson, the solicitor, bringing with him
his portmanteau and his servants. Mr. Easy had come into
the parlour, and was at breakfast when they entered. He
received them very coolly; but a little judicious praise of the
wonderful invention had its due effect; and after Jack had
reminded him of his promise that, in future, he was to control
the household, he was easily persuaded to sign the order for
his so doing— that is, the power of attorney.
Mr. Easy also gave up to Jack the key of his eseritoire,
and Mr. Hanson possessed himself of the books, papers, and
receipts necessary to ascertain the state of his aifairs, and
the rents which had not yet been paid up. In the meantime
the constables arrived. The servants were all summoned;
Mr. Hanson showed them the power of attorney, empowering
Jack to act for his father, and, in less than half an hour after-
wards, all the men-servants, but two grooms, were dismissed;
the presence of the constables and Mesty prevented any re-
sistance, but not without various threats on the part of the
butler, whose name was O’Rourke. Thus, in twenty-four
hours, Jack had made a reformation in the household.
Mr. Easy took no notice of anything; he returned to his
study and his wonderful invention. Mesty had received the
keys of the cellar, and had now complete control over those
who remained. Dr. Middleton, Mr. Hanson, Mr. Easy, and
J ack, sat down to dinner, and everything wore the appearance
of order and comfort. Mr. Easy ate very heartily, but said
nothing till after dinner, when, as was his usual custom, he
commenced arguing upon the truth and soundness of his
philosophy.
“By-the-bye, my dear son, if I recollect right, you told
me last night that you were no longer of my opinion. Now,
if you please , we will argue this point.”
“I’ll argue the point with all my heart, sir,” replied J ack;
“ will you begin?”

“Let’s ﬁll our glasses,” cried Mr. Easy, triumphantly;
“let’s ﬁll our glasses, and then I will bring Jack back to the
proper way ofthinking. Now then, my son, I trust you will
not deny that we are all bor n equa .”
“I do deny it, sir,” replied Jack; “I deny it ‘in toto’ —-
I deny it from the evidence of our own senses, and from the
authority of Scripture. To suppose all men were born equal,
is to suppose that they are equally endowed with the same
strength, and with the same capacity of mind, which we
know is not the case. I deny it from Scripture, from which
I could quote many passages; but I will restrict myself to one
— the parable of the Talents: ‘To one he gave ﬁve talents,
to another but one,’ holding them responsible for the trust
reposed in them. We are all intended to ﬁll various situa-
tions in society, and are provided by Heaven accordingly.”
“That may be,” replied Mr. Easy, “but that does not
prove that the earth was not intended to be equally dis-
tributed among all alike.”
“I beg your pardon; the proof that that was not the in-
tention of Providence, is, that that equality, allowing it to
be put in practice, could never be maintained.”
“Not maintained! — no, because the strong oppress the
weak, tyrants rise up and conquer — men combine to do
’ wrong.”
“Not so, my dear father; I say it could not be maintained
without the organisation of each individual had been equal-
ised, and several other points established. For instance,
allowing that every man had, ‘ab origine,’ a certain portion
of ground. He who was the strongest or the cleverest would
soon cause his to yield more than others would, and thus the
equality be destroyed. Again, if one couple had ten children,
and another had none , then again would equality be broken
in npon, as the land that supports two in the one instance,
would have to feed twelve in the other. You perceive, there-
fore, that without rapine or injustice, your equality could
not be preserved.”
_“But, Jack , allowing that there might be some diversity

from such causes, that would be a very diiferent thing from
the present monstrous state of society, in which we have
kings, and lords, and people, rolling in wealth, while others
are in a state of pauperism, and obliged to steal for their
daily bread.”
“My dear father, I consider that it is to this inequality
that society owes its ﬁrmest cementation — that we are en-
abled to live in peace and happiness , protected by just laws,
each doing his duty in that state of life to which he is called,
rising above or sinking in the scale of society according as
he has been entrusted with the ﬁve talents or the one.
Equality can and does exist nowhere. We are told that it
does not exist in heaven itself — how can it exist upon earth?”
“But that is only asserted, Jack, and it is not proof that
it ought not to exist.”
“Let us argue the point, father, coolly. Let us examine
a little what would be the effect if all was equality. Were
all equal in beauty, there would be no beauty, for beauty is
only by comparison — were all equal in strength, conﬂicts
would be interminable — were all equal in rank, and power,
and possessions, the greatest charms of existence would be
destroyed — generosity, gratitude, and half the ﬁner virtues,
would be unknown. The ﬁrst principle of our religion,
charity, could not be practised — pity would never be called
forth — benevolence, your great organ, would be useless,
and self-denial a blank letter. Were all equal in ability,
there would be no instruction, no talent, no genius — no-
thing to admire, nothing to copy, to respect — nothing to
reuse emulation, or stimulate to praiseworthy ambition.
Why, my dear father, what an idle, unproﬁtable, weary
world would this be, if it were based on equality!”
“But, allowing all that, Jack,” replied Mr. Easy, “and I
will say you argue well in a bad cause, why should the in-
equality be carried so far — king and lords, for instance?”
“The most lasting and imperishable form of building is
that of the pyramid, which deﬁes ages, and to that may the
most perfect form of society be compared. It is based upon

the many, and rising by degrees, it becomes less as wealth,
talent, and rank increase in the individual, until it ends at
the apex, or monarch, above all. Yet each several stone
from the apex to the base is necessary for the preservation of
the structure, and fulﬁls its duty in its allotted place. Could
you prove that those at the summit possess the greatest share
of happiness in this world, then, indeed, you have a position
to argue on; but it is well known, that such is not the case;
and provided he is of a contented mind, the peasant is more
happy than the king, surrounded as the latter is by cares
and anxiety.”
“Very well argued, indeed, my dear sir,” observed Dr.
Middleton.
“But, my dear boy, there are other states of society than
monarchy; we have republics and despotisms.”
“We have, but how long do they last, compared to the
ﬁrst? There is a cycle in the changes which ggger varies,
‘We °?!I1_-b_r_amrolntl'2e.c-a"d re" ,-ts,

’"@q'a::ﬁF“y. In a republic, those who govern are more power-
ful than the rulers in a restricted monarchy — a president is
greater than a king, and next to a despot, whose will is law.
Even in small societies you ﬁnd, that some will naturally
take the lead and assume domination. We commence the
system at school, when we are ﬁrst thrown into society, and
there we are taught systems of petty tyranny. There are
some few points in which we can obtain equality in this
world, and that equality can only be obtained under a well-
regulated form of society, and consists in an equal administra-
tion of justice and of laws, to which we have agreed to sub-
mit for the beneﬁt of the whole — the equal right to live and
not be permitted to starve, which has been obtained in this
country. And when we are called to account, we shall have
equal justice. Now, my dear father, you have my opinion. "

“Yes, my dear, this is all very well in the abstract, but
how does it work?”
“It works well. The luxury, the pampered state, the
idleness — if you please, the wickedness — of the rich, all
contribute to the support, the comfort, and employment of
the poor. You may behold extravagance — it is a vice; but
that very extravagance circulates money, and the vice of one
contributes to the happiness of many. The only vice which
is not redeemed by producing commensurate good, is avarice.
If all were equal, there would be no arts, no manufactures,
no industry, no employment. As it is, the inequality of the
distribution of wealth may be compared to the heart, pouring
forth the blood like a steam-engine through the human frame,
the same blood returning from the extremities by the veins,
to beagain propelled, and keep up a healthy and vigorous
circulation.”
“Bravo, Jack!” said Dr. Middleton. “Have you any-
thing to reply, sir?” continued he, addressing Mr. Easy.
“To reply, sir?” replied Mr. Easy, with scorn; “why, he
has not given me half an argument_ yet: why that black
servant even laughs at him — look at him there showing his
teeth. Can he forget the horrors of slavery? can he forget
the base unfeeling lash? No, sir, he has suffered, and he can
estimate the divine right of equality. Ask him now, ask him,
if you dare, Jack, whether he will admit the truth of your
argument.”
“Well, I’ll ask him,” replied Jack, “and I tell you can-
didly that he was once one of your disciples. Mesty, what’s
your opinion of equality?”
“Equality, Massa Easy?” replied Mesty, pulling up his
cravat; “I say d—n equality, now I major-domo.”
“The rascal deserves to be a slave all his life.”
“True, I ab been slave — but I a prince in my own
country. Massa Easy tell how many skulls I have.”
“Skulls — skulls,— do you know anything of the sublime
science? Are you a phrenologist? ” ,/,_ »

h “I know man’s skull very well in Ashantee country, any-
ow.”
“ Then if you know that, you must be one. I had no idea
that the science had extended so far — maybe it was brought
from thence. I will have some talk with you to-morrow.
This is very curious. Doctor Middleton, is it not?”
“Very, indeed, Mr. Easy.”
“I shall feel his head to-morrow after breakfast, and if
there is anything wrong, I shall correct it with my machine.
By-the-bye, I have quite forgot, gentlemen; you will excuse
me, but I wish to see what the carpenter has done for me,
and after that I shall attend the meeting of the society. Jack,
my boy, won’t you come and hear my speech?”
“Thank you, sir, but I cannot well leave your friends.”
Mr. Easy quitted the room.
“Are you aware, my dear sir, that your father has opened
his preserves to all the poachers?” said Mr. Hanson.
“The devil he has!”
“Yes, he has allowed several gangs of gipsies to locate
themselves in his woods, much to the annoyance of the neigh-
bourhood, who suffer from their depredations,” continued Dr.
Middleton.
“I ﬁnd, by the receipts and books, that there is nearly
two years’ rental of the estate due; some tenants have paid
up in full, others not for four years. I reckon fourteen thou-
sand pounds still in arrear.”
“You will oblige me by taking immediate steps, Mr. Han-
son, for the recovery of the sums due.”
“Most certainly, Mr. John. I trust your father will not
commit himself to-night as he has done lately.”
When they rose to retire, Dr. Middleton took our hero by
the hand. “You do not know, my dear fellow, what plea-
sure it gives me to ﬁnd that, in spite of the doting of your
mother and the madness of your father, you have turned out
so well. It is very fortunate that you have come home; I
trust you will now give up the profession.”
“I have given it up, sir; which, by-the-bye, reminds me

that I have not applied for either my discharge or that of my
servant; but I cannot spare time yet, so I shall not report
myself.”
CHAPTER XXXVII.
In which our Hero ﬁnds himself an Orphan, and resolves to go to Sea again,
without the smallest Idea of Equality.
Tun next morning, when they met at breakfast, Mr. Easy
did not make his appearance, and Jack inquired of Mesty
where he was.
“They say down below that the old gentleman not come
home last night.”
“Did not come home!” said Dr. Middleton; “this must
be looked to.”
“He great rascal, dat butler man ,” said Mesty to Jack:
“but de old gentleman not sleep in his bed, dat for sure.”
“Make inquiries when he went out,” said Jack.
“I hope no accident has happened,” observed Mr. Hanson:
“but his company has lately been very strange.”
“ Nobody see him go out, sar, last night,” reported
Mesty.
“Very likely he is in his study,” observed Dr. Middleton:
“he may have remained all night, fast asleep, by his wonderful
invention.”
“I’ll go and see,” replied Jack.
Dr. Middleton accompanied him, and Mesty followed.
They opened the door, and beheld a spectacle which made
them recoil with horror. There was Mr. Easy, with his head
in the machine, the platform below fallen from under him,
hanging, with his toes just touching the ground. Dr. Middle-
ton hastened to him, and, assisted by Mesty and our hero
took him out of the steel collar which was round his neck:
but life had been extinct for many hours, and, on examination,
it was found that the poor old gentleman’s neck was dis-
ocated.
It was surmised that the accident must have taken place

mm. mmsnmmsu nssv. 369
the evening before, and it was easy to account for it. Mr.
Easy, who had had the machine raised four feet higher, for
the platform and steps to be placed underneath, must have
mounted on the frame modelled by the carpenter for his work,
and have ﬁxed his head in, for the knob was pressed on his
bump of benevolence. The frame-work, hastily put together
with a few short nails, had given way with his weight, and
the sudden fall had dislocated his neck.
Mr. Hanson led away our hero, who was much shocked at
this unfortunate and tragical end of his poor father, while Dr.
Middleton ordered the body to be taken up into a bed-room,
and immediately dispatched a messenger to the coroner of
the county. Poor Mr. Easy had told his son but the day be-
fore, that he felt convinced that this wonderful invention would
immortalise him, and so it had, although not exactly in the
sense that he anticipated.
We must pass over the few days of sorrow, and closed
shutters, which always are given to these scenes. The coro-
ner’s inquest and the funeral over, daylight was again ad-
mitted, our hero’s spirits revived, and he found himself in
possession of a splendid property, and his own master.
He was not of age, it is true, for he wanted nine months;
but on opening the will of his father, he found that Dr. Mid-
dleton was his sole guardian. Mr. Hanson, on examining and
collecting the papers, which were in the greatest confusion,
discovered banknotes in different corners, and huddled up
with bills and receipts, to the amount of two thousand pounds,
and further, a cheque signed by Captain Wilson on his banker,
for the thousand pounds advanced by Mr. Easy, dated more
than ﬁfteen months back.
Dr. Middleton wrote to the Admiralty, informing them
that family affairs necessitated Mr. John Easy, who had been
left at sick quarters, to leave His Majesty’s service, request-
ing his discharge from it forthwith. The Admiralty was
graciously pleased to grant the request, and lose the services
of a midshipman. The Admiralty were also pleased to grant
Mr. mampm» Easy. 24

the discharge of Mesty, on the sum required for a substitute
being paid in.
The gipsies were routed out of their abodes, and sent once
more to wander. The gamekeepers were restored, the pre-
serves cleared of all poachers , and the gentry of the country
were not a little pleased at Jack’s succession, for they had
wished that Mr. Easy’s neck had been broken long ago. The
societies were dissolved, since, now that Mr. Easy no longer
paid for the beer, there was nothing to meet for. Cards and
compliments were sent from all parts of the county, and every
one was anxious that our hero should come of age, as then he
would be able to marry, to give dinners, subscribe to the fox-
hounds, and live as a gentleman ought to do.
But during all these speculations, Jack had made Dr.
Middleton acquainted with the history of his amour with
Agnes de Rebiera, and all particulars connected therewith,
also with his determination to go out to bring her home as his
wife. Dr. Middleton saw no objection to the match, and he
perceived that our hero was sincere. And Jack had made in-
quiries when the packet would sail for Malta, when Mesty,
who stood behind his chair, observed,—
“Packet bad vessel, Massa Easy. Why not go out in man-
of-war?”
“Very true,” replied Jack; “but you know, Mesty, that
is not so easy.”
“And den how come home, sar. Suppose you and Missy
Agnes taken prisoner — put in prison?”
“Very true,” replied Jack; “and as for a passage home
in a man-of-war, that will be more difﬁcult still.”
“ Den I tink, sar, suppose you buy one ﬁne vessel -—- plenty
of guns — take out letter of marque — plenty of men, and
bring Missy Agnes home like a lady. You captain of your
own shipl’
“That deserves consideration, Mesty,” replied Jack, who
thought of it during that night: and the next day resolved to
follow Mesty’s advice. The Portsmouth paper lay onthe break-
fast-table. Jack took it up, and his eye was caught by an ad-

vertisement for the sale of the Joan d’Arc, prize to H. M.
ship Thetis, brigantine of 278 tons, copper-bottomed, armed
‘en ﬂute,’ with all her stores, spars, sails, running and stand-
ing rigging, then lying in the harbour of Portsmouth, to take
place on the following Wednesday.
Jack rang the bell, and ordered post-horses.
“VVhere are you going, my dear boy?” inquired Dr. Mid-
dleton.
“ To Portsmouth, Doctor.”
“And pray what for, if not an impertinent question?”
Jack then gave Dr. Middleton an insight into his plan, and
requested that he would allow him to do so, as there was plenty
of ready money.
“But the expense will be enormous.”
“It will be heavy, sir, I grant, but I have calculated it
pretty nearly, and I shall not spend at the rate of more than
my income. Besides, as letter of marque, I shall have the
right of capture; in fact, I mean to take out a pz-ivateer’s re-
gular licence.”
“But not to remain there and cruise?”
“N 0, upon my honour; I am too anxious to get home again.
You must not refuse me, my dear guardian.”
“As a lady is in the case, I will not, my dear boy; but be
careful what you are about.”
“Never fear, sir, Iwill be back in four months, at the farth-
est; but I must now set off and ascertain if the vessel answers
the description given in the advertisement.”
Jack threw himself into the chariot. Mesty mounted into
the rumble, and in two hours they were at Portsmouth; went
to the agent, viewed the vessel, which proved to be a very
ﬁne fast-sailing craft, well found, with six brass carronades
on each side. The cabins were handsome, ﬁtted up with
bird’s-eye maple, and gilt mouldings.
This will do, thought Jack; a couple of long brass nines,
forty men and six boys, and she will be just the thing we re-
quire. So Mesty and Jack went on shore again, and returned
to Forest Hill to dinner, when he desired Mr. Hanson to set

off for Portsmouth, and bid at the sale for the vessel, ashe
wfshed to purchase her. This was Monday, and on Wednes-
day Mr. Hanson purchased her, as she stood, for £ 1750, which
was considered about half her value.
Dr. Middleton had, in the meantime, been thinking very
seriously of Jack’s project. He could see no objection to it,
provided that he was steady and prudent, but in both these
qualities Jack had not exactly been tried. He therefore de-
termined to look out for some steady naval lieutenant, and
make it a ‘sine qua non’ that our hero should be accom-
panied by him, and that he should go out as sailing-master.
Now that the vessel was purchased, he informed Jack of his
wish; indeed, as Dr. Middleton observed, his duty as guar-
dian demanded this precaution, and our hero, who felt very
grateful to Dr. Middleton, immediately acquiesced.
“And, by-the-bye, Doctor, see that he is a good navigator;
for although I can fudge a day’s work pretty well, latterly I
have been out of practice.”
Every one was now busy: Jack and Mesty at Portsmouth,
ﬁtting out the vessel, and offering three guineas ahead to the
crimps for every good able seaman — Mr. Hanson obtaining
the English register, and the letters of licence, and Dr. Mid-
dleton in search of a good naval dry-nurse. Jack found time
to write to Don Philip and Agnes, apprising them of the
death of his father, and his intentions.
In about six weeks all was ready, and the brigantine,
which had taken out her British register and licence under
the name of the Rebiera, went out of harbour, and anchored
at Spithead. Dr. Middleton had procured, as he thought, a
very ﬁt person to sail with Jack, and our hero and Mesty em-
barked, wishing the Doctor and Solicitor good-bye, and leav-
ing them nothing to do but to pay the bills.
The person selected by Dr. Middleton, by the advice of an
old friend of his, a purser in the navy, who lived at Southsea,
was a Lieutenant Oxbelly, who, with the ship’s company,
which had been collected, received our hero as their captain
and owner upon his arrival on board. There certainly was no

small contrast between our hero’s active slight ﬁgure and hand-
some person, set off with a blue coat, something like the pre-
sent yacht-club uniform, and that of his second in command,
who waddled to the side to receive him. He was a very short
man, with an uncommon protuberance of stomach, with shoul~
ders and arms too short for his body, and hands much too
large, more like the paws of a Polar bear than anything else.
He wore trousers, shoes, and buckles. On his head was a
foraging cap, which, when he took it off, showed that he was
quite bald. His age might be about ﬁfty-ﬁve or sixty; his
complexion ﬂorid, no whiskers, and little beard, nose straight,
lips thin, teeth black with chewing, and always a little brown
dribble from the left corner of his mouth (there was a leak
there, he said.) Altogether his countenance was prepossess-
ing, for it was honest and manly, but his waist was preposter-
ous.
“Steady enough,” thought Jack, as he returned Mr. Ox-
belly’s salute.
“How do you do, sir?” said Jack; “I trust we shall be
good shipmates,” for Jack had not seen him before.
“Mr. Easy,” replied the lieutenant, “I never quarrel with
any one, except (I won’t tell a story) with my wife.”
“I am sorry that you have ever domestic dissensions, Mr.
Oxbelly.”
“And I only quarrel with her at night, sir. She will take
up more than her share of the bed, and won’t allow me to
sleep single; but never mind that, sir; now will you please
to muster the men?”
“If you please, Mr. Oxbelly.”
The men were mustered, and Jack made them a long
speech upon subordination, discipline, activity, duty, and so
fort .”
“Avery good speech, Mr. Easy,“ said Mr. Oxbelly, as
the men went forward; “I wish my wife had heard it. But,
sir, if you please, we’ll now get under way as fast as we can,
for there is a Channel cruiser working up at St. Helen’s, and
we may give him the go-by by running through the Needles.”

“But what need we care for the Channel cruiser?”
“You forget, sir, that as soon as she drops her anchor she
will come on board and take a fancy to at least ten of our
men.”
“But they are protected.”
“Yes, sir, but that’s no protection, now-a-days. I have
sailed in a privateer at least three years, and I know that
they have no respect for letters of marque or for privateers.”
“I believe you are right, Mr. Oxbelly; so, if you please,
we will up with the anchor at once.”
The crew of the Rebiera had been well chosen; they were
prime men-of-war’s men, most of whom had deserted from
the various ships on the station, and, of course, were most
anxious to be off. In a few minutes the Rebiera was under
way with all sail set below and aloft. She was in excellent
trim and ﬂew through the water; the wind was fair, and by
night they had passed Portland Lights, and the next morning
were steering a course for the Bay of Biscay without having
encountered what they feared more than an enemy, -— a
British cruiser to overhaul them.
“I think we shall do now, sir,” observed Mr. Oxbelly to
our hero; “we have made a famous run. It’s twelve o’clock,
and if you please I’ll work the latitude, and let you know
what it is. We must shape our course so as not to run in with
the Brest squadron. A little more westing, sir. I’ll be up
in one minute. My wife — but I’ll tell you about that when
I come up.”
“Latitude 41° 12' , sir. I was about to say that my wife,
when she was on boardofthe privateer thatI commanded —-—”
“Board of the privateer, Mr. Oxbelly?”
“Yes, sir, would go; told her it was impossible, but she
wouldn’t listen to reason—came on board, ﬂopped herself
into the standing bed-place, and said that there she was for
the cruise, — little Billy with her ——”
“What! your child, too?”
“Yes, two years old—ﬁne boy— always laughed when

the glllli were ﬁred, while his mother stood on the ladder and
held him on the top of the booby-hatch.”
“I wonder that Mrs. Oxbelly let you come here now?”
“ So you would, sir, but I’ll explain that— she thinks I’m
in London about my half-pay. She knows all by this time,
and frets, I don’t doubt; but that will make her thin, and
then there will be more room in the bed. Mrs. Oxbelly is a
very stout woman.”
“Why you are not a little man!”
“No, not little — tending to be lusty, as the saying is —-
that is,’in good condition. It’s very strange that Mrs. Ox-
belly has an idea that she is not large. I cannot persuade
her to it. That’s the reason we always spar in bed. She
says it is I, and I know that it is she who takes the largest
share of it.”
“Perhaps you may both be right.”
“No, no; it is she who creates all the disturbance. If 1
get nearer to the wall she jams me up till I am as thin as a
thread-paper. If I put her inside and stay outside, she cuts
me out as you do a cask, by the chime, till I tumble out of
bed.”
“Why don’t you make your bed larger, Mr. Oxbelly? ”
“Sir, I have proposed, but my wife will have it that the
bed is large enough if I would not toss in my sleep. I can’t
convince her. However, she’ll have it all to herself now. I
slept well last night, for the ﬁrst time since I left the
Boadicea.”
“The Boadicea?”
“Yes, sir, I was second-lieutenant of the Boadicea for
three years.”
“ She’s a ﬁne frigate, I’m told.” _
“On the contrary, such a pinched-up little craft below I
never saw. Why, Mr. Easy, I could hardly get into the door
of my cabin‘— and yet, as you must see, I’m not ‘a large
man”
“ Good heavens! is it possible,” thought Jack, “that this
man does not really know that he is monstrous?”

Yet such was the case. Mr. Oxbelly had no idea that he
was otherwise than in good condition, although he had pro-
bably not seen his knees for years. It was his obesity ‘that
was the great objection to him, for in every other point there
was nothing against him. He had, upon one pretence and
another, been shifted, by the manoeuvres of the captains, out
of different ships, until he went up to the Admiralty to know
if there was any charge against him. The ﬁrst lord at once
perceived the charge to be preferred, and made a mark
against his name as not ﬁt for anything but harbour duty.
Out of employment, he had taken the command of a privateer
cutter, when his wife, who was excessively fond, would, as
he said, follow him with little Billy. He was sober, steady,
knew\ his duty well; but he weighed twenty-six stone, and his
weight had swamped him in the service.
His wish, long indulged, had become, as Shakspeare
says, the father of his thought, and he had really at last
brought himself to think that he was not by any means what
could be considered a fat man. His wife, as he said, was also
a very stout woman, and this exuberance of ﬂesh on both
sides, was the only, but continual, ground of dispute.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
In which our Hero , as usual, gets into the very Middle of it.
On the eleventh day the Rebiera entered the straits, and
the rock of Gibraltar was in sight as the sun went down;
after which the wind fell light, and about midnight it became
calm, and they drifted up. At sunrise they were roused by
the report of heavy guns, and perceived an English frigate
about eight miles further up the straits, and more in the mid-
channel, engaging. nine or ten Spanish gun-boats, which had
came out from Algesiras to attack her. It still continued a
dead calm, and the boats of the frigate were all ahead towing
her, so as to bring her broadside to bear upon the Spanish

ﬂotilla. The reverberating of the heavy cannon on both sides
over the placid surface of the water — the white smoke
ascending as the sun rose in brilliancy in a clear blue sky —-
the distant echoes repeated from the high hills — had a very
beautiful effect for those who are partial to the picturesque.
But Jack thought it advisable to prepare for action instead
of watching for tints — and, in a short time, all was ready.
“They’ll not come to us, Mr. Easy, as long as they have
the frigate to hammer at; but still we had better be pre-
pared, for we cannot well pass them without having a few
shot. When I came up the straits in the privateer we were
attacked by two, and fought them for three hours; their shot
dashed the water over our decks till they were wet fore and
aft, but somehow or another they never hit us — we were as
low as they were. l’ll be bound but they’ll hull the frigate
though. Mrs. Oxbelly and Billy were on deck the whole
time — and Billy was quite delighted, and cried when they
took him down to breakfast.”
“Why, Mrs. Oxbelly must be very courageous.”
“Cares neither for shot or shell, sir — laughs when they
whiz over her head, and tells Billy to hark. But, sir, it’s not
surprising; her father is a major, and her two brothers are
lieutenants in the bombadiers.”
“That, indeed,” replied Jack — “but see, there is a
breeze springing up from the westward.”
“Very true, Mr. Easy, and a steady one it will be, for it
comes up dark and slow; so much the better for the frigate,
for she’ll get little honour and plenty of mauling at this
work.”
“I hope we shall take it up with us,” observed Jack;
“how far do you reckon the gun-boats from the shore?”
“I should think about ﬁve miles, or rather less.”
“Trim sails, Mr. Oxbelly — perhaps we may cut one or
two of these oﬁ’ — steer in shore of them.”
“Exactly. Up there, my lads, set top-gallant studding
sails, top-mast studdings to hand — rig out the booms—keep

as you go now, my lad — we shall be well in shore of them,
and out of the range of the batteries.”
The breeze came down fresh, and all sail was set upon
the Rebiera. She took the wind down with her, and it passed
her but little — half a mile ahead of them all was still and
smooth as a glass mirror, and they neared and gained in
shore at the same time. The gun-boats were still engaging
the frigate, and did not appear to pay any attention to the
Rebiera coming down. At last the breeze reached them and
the frigate, light at ﬁrst and then gradually increasing, while
the Rebiera foamed through the water, and had now every
chance of cutting off some of the gun-boats. The frigate
trimmed her sails and steered towards the ﬂotilla, which now
thought proper to haul off and put their heads in shore, fol-
lowed by the frigate ﬁring her bow-chasers. But the Rebiera
was now within half gun-shot in shore, and steering so as to
intercept them. As she rapidly closed, the ﬂotilla scarcely
knew how to act; to attack her would be to lose time, and
allow the frigate to come up and occasion their own capture;
so they satisﬁed themselves with ﬁring at her as she continued
to run down between them and the land. As they neared,
Jack opened his ﬁre with his eighteen-pound carronades and
long nines. The gun-boats returned his ﬁre, and they were
within a quarter of a mile, when Jack shortened sail to his
top-sails, and a warm engagement took place, which ended
in one of the gun-boats being, in a few minutes, dismasted.
The frigate, under all canvas, came rapidly up, and her shot
now fell thick. The ﬂotilla then ceased ﬁring, passing about
two cables’ length ahead of the Rebiera, and making all pos-
sible sail for the land. Jack now ﬁred at the ﬂotilla as they
passed, with his larboard broadside, while with his starboard
he poured in grape and canister upon the unfortunate gun-
boat which was dismasted, and which soon hauled down her
colours. In a few minutes more the remainder were too far
distant for the carronades, and, as they did not ﬁre, Jack
turned his attention to take possession of his prize, sending a
boat with ten men on board, and heaving-to close to her to

MR. mnsmrmsn nssv. 379
take her in tow. Ten minutes more and the frigate was also
hove-to a cable’s length from the Rebiera, and our hero
lowered down his other quarter-boat to go on board.
“Have we any men hurt, Mr. Oxbelly?” inquired Jack.
“Only two; Spearling has lost his thumb with a piece of
langrage, and James has a bad wound in the thigh.”
“Very well; I will ask for the surgeon to come on
board.”
Jack pulled to the frigate and went up the side, touched
his hat in due form, and was introduced by the midshipmen
to the other side, where the captain stood.
“Mr. Easy!” exclaimed the captain.
“Captain Sawbridge!” replied our hero, with surprise.
“Good heavens! what brought you here?” said the cap-
tain; “and what vessel is that?”
“The Rebiera, letter of marque, commanded and owned
by Mr. Easy,” replied Jack, laughing.
Captain Sawbridge gave him his hand. “Come down
with me into the cabin, Mr. Easy; I am very glad to see you.
Give you great credit for your conduct, and am still more
anxious to know what has induced you to come out again.
I knew that you had left the service.”
Jack, in a very few words, told his object in ﬁtting out the
Rebiera; “but,” continued Jack, “allow me to congratulate
you upon your promotion, which I was not aware of. May I
ask where you left the Harpy, and what is the name of your
frigate?”
“The Latona. I have only been appointed to her one
month, after an action in which the Harpy took a large
corvette, and am ordered home with despatches to England.
We sailed yesterday evening from Gibraltar, were becalmed
the whole night, and attacked this morning by the gun-boats.”
“How is Captain Wilson, sir?”
“I believe he is very well, but I have not seen him.”
“How did you know, then, that I had left the service,
Captain Sawbridge?”
“From Mr. Gascoigne, who is now on board.”


## p. 380 (#388) ############################################

380 ms. umsnrrman naSY.
“ Gascoigne!” exclaimed our hero.
“Yes, he was sent up to join the Aurora by the
governor, but she had left the ﬂeet, and having served his
time, and a passing day being ordered, he passed, and thought
he might as well go home with me and see if he could make
any interest for his promotion.”
“Pray, Captain Sawbridge, is the gun-boat our prize or
yours?”
“It ought to be wholly yours; but the fact is, by the
regulations, we share.”
“With all my heart, sir. Will you send an assistant-
surgeon on board to look after two of my men who are hurt?”
“Yes, directly-; now send your boat away, Easy, with
directions to your ofﬁcer in command. We must go back to
Gibraltar, for we have received some injury, and, I am sorry
to say, lost some men. You are going then, I presume, to
stay on board and dine with me: we shall be at anchor before
night.”
“I will with pleasure, sir. But now I will send my boat
away and shake hands with Gascoigne.”
Gascoigne was under the half-deck waiting to receive his
friend, for he had seen him come up the side from his station
on the fore-castle. A hurried conversation took place, after
our hero had dismissed his boat with the assistant-surgeon in
it to dress the two wounded men. Jack then went on deck,
talked with the ofﬁcers, looked with pleasure at the Rebiera
with the gun-boat in tow, keeping company with the frigate,
although only under the same canvas — promised Gascoigne
to spend the next day with him either on shore or on board
the Rebiera, and then returned to the cabin, where he had
a long conference with Captain Sawbridge.
“VVhen you ﬁrst entered the service Easy,” said Captain
Sawbridge, “I thought that the sooner the service was rid of
you the better; now that you have left it, I feel that it has
lost one who, in all probability, would have proved a credit
(0 it.”

“Many thanks, sir,” replied Jack: “but how can I be a
midshipman with eight thousand pounds a-year?”
“I agree with you that it is impossible: —but dinner is
serving: go into the after-cabin and the steward will give you
all you require.”
Our hero, whose face and hands were not a little grimed
with the gunpowder, washed himself, combed out his curly
black hair, and found all the party in the fore-cabin. Gas-
coigne, who had not been asked in the forenoon, was, by the
consideration of Captain Sawbridge, added to the number.
Before dinner was long off the table, the ﬁrst-lieutenant re-
ported that it was necessary to turn the hands up, as they
were close to the anchorage. The party, therefore, broke up
sooner than otherwise would have been the case; and as soon
as the Latona’s sails were furled, Captain Sawbridge went on
shore to acquaint the governor with the results of the action.
He asked Jack to accompany him, but our hero, wishing to
be with Gascoigne, excused himself until the next day.
“And now, Easy,” said Gascoigne, as soon as the captain
had gone over the side, “I will ask permission to go on board
with you — or will you ask?”
“I will ask,” replied Jack; “ a gentleman of fortune has
more weight with a ﬁrst-lieutenant than a midshipman.”
So Jack went up to the ﬁrst-lieutenant, and with one of
his polite bows hoped, “if duty would permit, he would
honour him by coming on board that evening with some of
his ofﬁcers, to see the Rebiera and to drink a bottle or two
of champagne.”
The ﬁrst-lieutenant, as the Rebiera was anchored not two
cables’ lengths from him, replied, “that as soon as he had
shifted the prisoners and secured the gun-boat, he would be
very glad:” so did three or four more of the ofﬁcers, and then
Jack begged as a favour, that his old friend, Mr. Gascoigne,
might be permitted to go with him now, as he had important
packages to entrust to his care to England. The ﬁrst-lieuten-
ant was very willing, and Gascoigne and our hero jumped

into the boat, and were once more in all the conﬁdence of
tried and deserved friendship.
“Jack, I’ve heen thinking of it, and I’ve made up my
mind,” said Gascoigne. “I shall gain little or nothing by
going home for my promotion: I may as well stay here, and
as I have served my time and passed, my pay is now of little
consequence. Will you take me with you?”
“It was exactly what I was thinking of, Ned. Do you
think that Captain Sawbridge will consent?”
“I do: he knows how I am circumstanced, and that my
going home was merely because I was tired of looking after
the Aurora.”
“ We’ll go together and ask him to-morrow,” replied Jack.
“At all events, you’ll have a more gentlemanly com-
panion than Mr. Oxbelly.”
“But not so steady, Ned.”
The ﬁrst-lieutenant and ofﬁcers came on board, and passed
a merry evening. There’s nothing passes time more agreeably
away than champagne, and if you do not affront this regal
wine by mixing him with any other, he never punishes you
the next morning.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
A Council of War, in which Jack decides that he will have one more
Cruise.
As Captain Sawbridge did not return on board that even-
ing, Easy went on shore and called upon him at the governor’s,
to whom he was introduced, and received an invitation to
dine with him. As Gascoigne could not come on shore, our
hero took this opportunity of making his request t- Captain
Sawbridge, stating that the person he had with him was not
such as he wished and could conﬁde everything to; that is,
not one to whom he could talk about Agnes. Jack, as he
found that Captain Sawbridge did not immediately assent,
pressed the matter hard: at last Captain Sawbridge, who re-

ﬂected that Gascoigne’s interest hereafter would be much
greater through his friend Easy, than any other quarter, and
that the more the friendship was cemented the more ad-
vantageous it might prove to Gascoigne, gave his consent to
our hero’s wish, who called on board of the Latona to ac-
quaint Gascoigne and the ﬁrst-lieutenant of Captain Saw-
bridge’s intentions, and then went on board of the'Rebiera
and ordered Mesty to come with his portmanteau on shore to
the inn, that he might dress for dinner. Gascoigne, now con-
sidered as not belonging to the Latona, was permitted to ac-
company him: and Jack found himself looking out of the
window at which he had hung out his trousers upon the me-
morable occasion when the boatswain had to follow his own
precept, of duty before decency.
“What scenes of adventures I have passed through since
that,” thought Jack; “not much more than four years ago,
then not three weeks in the service.” Whereupon Jack
fell into a deep reverie, and thought of the baboon and of
Agnes.
The repairs of the Latona were all made good by the
next day, and Gascoigue, having received his discharge-
ticket, went on board of the Rebiera. The gun-boat was put
into the hands of the agent, and shortly afterwards purchased
by government. The Rebie1'a’s crew did not, however, ob-
tain their prize-money and share of the head-money, for she
had seventy men on board, until their return, but, as they
said, they had broken the ice, and that was everything.
Moreover, it gave them conﬁdence in themselves, in their
vessel, and in their commander. Our hero weighed a short
time after the Latona, having ﬁrst taken leave of Captain
Sawbridge, and committed to his care a letter to Dr. Mid-
dleton. .1‘
Once more behold the trio together, —the two midship-
men hanging over the taﬁrail, and Mesty standing by them.
They had rounded Europa Point, and, with a ﬁne breeze ofl‘
the land, were lying close-hauled along the Spanish shore.
Mr. Oxbelly was also walking near them.

“ When I was cruising here it was very different,”observe:1
Jack: “I had a vessel which I did not know how to manage,
a crew which I could not command, and had it not been for
Mesty, what would have become of me! ”
“Massa Easy, you know very well how to get out of
scrapes, anyhow.”
“Yes, and how to get into them,” continued G-ascoigne.
“And how to get others out of them, too, Ned.”
“‘No more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me,”’ quoted Gas-
coigne. “I have often wondered what has been the lot of
poor Azar.”
“The lot of most women, Ned, in every country —prized
at ﬁrst, neglected afterwards —the lot she might have had
with you.”
“Perhaps so,” replied Ned, with a sigh.
“Massa Easy, you get eberybody out of scrape; you get
me out of scrape.”
“I do not recollect how, Mesty.”
“You get me out from boil kettle for young gentlemen —
dat devil of a scrape.” -
“And I’m sure I’ve got you out of a scrape, Mr. Ox-
belly.”
“How so, Mr. Easy?”
“How s0l—have I not prevented your quarrelling with
your wife every night?”
“Certainly, sir, you have been the means. But do you
know when we were engaging the other day, I could not help
saying to myself, ‘I wish my wife was here now, holding
little Billy at the hatchway.’ ”
“But at night, Mr. Oxbelly.”
“At night! —why, then I’m afraid I should have wished
her home again —it’s astonishing how comfortable I sleep
now every night. Besides, in this climate it would be in-
tolerable. Mrs. Oxbelly is a very large woman —very large
indeed.”
“Well, but now we must hold a council of war. Are we
to run up the coast, or to shape a course direct for Palermo ‘B "

“Course direct, and we shall take nothing, that is cer-
tain,” said Gascoigne.
“If we take nothing we shall make no prize-money,” con-
tinued Oxbelly.
“If we make no prize-money the men will be discon-
tented,” said Easy.
“If no abnoting to do —it will be d— d ’tupid,”‘con-
tinued Mesty.
“Now then the other side of the question. If we steer
for Palermo, we shall be sooner there and sooner home.”
“To which I reply,” said Gascoigne, “that the shorter
the cruise is, the less I shall have of your company.”
“And I shall have to sleep with Mrs. Oxbelly,” continued
Oxbelly.
“Hab ﬁne ship, ﬁne gun, ﬁne men, and do noting ,” cried
Mesty. “By de power, I no like dat, Massa Easy.”
“You want eight months of coming of age, Jack,” ob-
served Gascoigne.
“It won’t make a difference of more than three or four
weeks,” said Mr. Oxbelly; “ and the expenses have been very
great.”
“But ——”
“But what, J ack? ”
“Agnes.”
“Agnes will be better defended going home by men
who have been accustomed to be in action. And as for her
waiting a little longer, it will only make her love you a little
more.”
“ Sleep single a little longer, Mr. Easy, it’s very pleasant,”
said Mr. Oxbelly.
“That’s not very bad advice of yours,” observed Gas- -
cor ne.
g“ Stop a little, Massa Easy,” said Mesty, “you know dat
very good advice.” _
“Well, then,” replred Jack, “Iwill, as I am quite in
the minority. We will work up the whole coast — up to

Toulon. After all, there’s something very pleasant in com-
manding your own ship, and I’m not in a hurry to resign it—
so that point’s decided.” '
The Rebiera was steered into the land, and at sunset they
were not four miles from the lofty blue mountains which over-
hang the town of Malaga. There were many vessels lying
at the bottom of the bay, close in with the town; the wind
now fell light, and the Rebiera, as she could not fetch the
town, tackedas if she were a merchant vessel standing in,
and showed American colours, a hint which they took from
perceiving three 01' four large vessels lying in the outer roads,
with the colours of that nation hoisted at the peak.
“What is your intention, Jack?” said Gascoigne.
“I’ll be hanged if I know yet. I think of working up to
the outer roads, and anchoring at night—boa1-ding the Ame‘
rican vessels, and gaining intelligence.”
“Not a bad idea; we shall then learn if there is anything
to be done, and if not we may be off at dayligh .”
“The pratique boat will not come off after sunset.”
“And if they did, we could pass for an American, bound
to Barcelona or anywhere else —the outer roads where the
vessels lie are hardly within gun-shot.”
Mesty, who had resumed his sailor’s clothes, now ob-
served, “What we do, Massa Easy, we do quickly — time for
all ting, time for show face and ﬁght—time for hide face,
crawl, and steal.”
“Very true, Mesty, we’ll crawl this time , and steal if we
can. It’s not the warfare I like best of the two.”
“Both good, Massa Easy; suppose you no steal board of
polacca ship, you not see Missy Agnes.”
“Very true, Mesty. ’Bout ship, Mr. Oxbelly.”
“Mr. Oxbelly not good for boat service,” observed Mesty,
showing his teeth.
It was dark before the Rebiera was anchored in the outer
roads, a cable’s length astern of the outermost American
vessel. One of her quarter-boats was lowered down, and

Gaseoigne and our hero pulled alongside, and, lying on their
oars, hailed, and asked the name of the vessel.
“So help me Gad, just now I forget her name,” replied a
negro, looking over the gangway.
“Who’s the captain?"
“ So help me Gad, he gone on shore.”
“Is the mate on board?”
“No, so help me Gad — be gone shore, too.”
“Who is aboard then?”
“ So help me Gad, nobody on board but Pompey — and
dat me.”
“Good ship-keepers, at all events,” said Jack. “A ship
in the outer roads, with only a black fellow on board! I
say, Pompey, do they always leave you in charge of the
vessel?”
“No, sar; but to-night great pleasure on shore. Ebery~
body dance and sing, get drunk, kick up bobbery, and all
dat.”
“What, is it a festival?”
“ So help me Gad, I no know, sar.”
“Is there any one on board of the other vessels?”
“Eberybody gone on shore. Suppose they have black
man, he stay on board.”
“ Good-night, Pompey.”
- “Good-night, sar. Who I say call when captain come on
board ?”
“Captain Easy.”
“Captain He-see, very well, sar.”
Our hero pulled to another ship, and found it equally
deserted; but at the third he found the second mate with
his arm in a sling, and from him they gained the informa-
tion that it was a great festival, being the last day of the
carnival; and that every one was thinking of nothing but
amusement.
“I’ve a notion,’

“You’ve guessed righ ,” replied Jack.

“What ship, and from what port?”
“Rhode Island, the Susan and Mary,” replied Gas-
coigne.
“I thought you were north. We’re of New York. What
news do you bring?”
“Nothing,” replied he, “we are from Liverpool last.”
A succession of questions was now put by the American
mate, and answered very skilfully by Gascoigne, who then
inquired how the markets was?
It was necessary to make and reply to all these inquiries
before they could ask apparently indifferent questions of
American traders; at last, Gascoigne inquired, —
“Do you think they would allow us to go on shore? the
pratique boat has not been on board.”
“ ‘I‘hey’ll never ﬁnd you out if you are off before daylight;
I doubt if they know that you are anchored. Besides, from
Liverpool you would have a clean bill of health, and if they
found it out, they would not say much; they’r not over parti-
cular, I’ve a notion.”
“What are those vessels lying in-shore?”
“I guess they have olive oil on board, the chief on ’em.
But there are two double latteens come in from Valparaiso
the day before yesterday, with hides and copper. How they
’scaped the British, I can‘t tell, but they did, that’s sure
enough.”
- “Good night, then.”
“You won’t take a glass of sling this ﬁne night with a
countryman?”
“To-morrow, my good fellow, to-morrow; we must go on
shore now.”
Our hero and Gascoigne returned on board the Rebiera,
consulted with Oxbelly and Mesty, and then manned and
armed the two quarter and stern-boats. They thought it
advisable not to hoist out their long-boat; no ﬁre-arms were
permitted to be taken, lest, going off by accident or other-
wise, an alarm should be given. Our hero and Mesty pro-
ceeded in the ﬁrst boat, and pulled in for the town; Gascoigne

shortly after in the second, and the boatswain in the jolly-
boat, followed at some distance.
There was no notice taken of them; they pulled gently
down to the landing-place, which was deserted. There was
a blaze of light, and the sounds of revelry in every quarter
on shore; but the vessels appeared equally deserted as the
American ones in the ofﬁng.
Finding themselves unobserved, for they had taken the
precaution to pull only two oars in each boat, they dropped
gently alongside one of the double-masted latteen vessels,
and Mesty stepped on board. He peeped down in the cabin,
and perceived a man lying on the lockers; he came up in his
stealthy manner, closed the hatch softly, and said, “All
right.” Jack left Gascoigne to take out this vessel, which
he did very successfully, for it was very dark; and although
there were sentries posted not far off, their eyes and ears were
turned towards the town, listening to the music.
A second vessel, her consort, was boarded in the same
way, but here they found a man on deck, whom they were
obliged to seize and gag. They put him down in the cabin,
and Mesty, with another boat’s crew, cut her cables, and
swept her gently out towards the American vessels. One
more vessel was required, and Jack, pulling two oars as
usual, saluted a galliot heavily laden, but of what her cargo
consisted was not known. In this vessel they found two men
in the cabin playing cards, whom they seized and bound, and,
cutting her cables, were obliged to make sail upon her, as
she was much too large to sweep out. As they were making
sail they, however, met with an interruption which they did
not expect. The crew belonging to the vessel, having had
enough amusement for the evening, and intending to sail the
next morning, had thought it right to come oif sooner than
the others: it was then about midnight or a little later, and
while some of Jack’s men were aloft, for he had six with
him, Jack, to his annoyance, heard a boat coming off from
the shore, the men in her singing a chorus. The galliot was
at that time just under steerage way, her topsails had been

loosed and her jib hoisted, but the former had not been
sheeted home, for the three men below could not, in the dark,
ﬁnd the ropes. The other three men were on the fore-yard
loosing the foresail, and Jack was undetermined whether to
call them down immediately, or to allow them to loose the
sail, and thus get good way on the vessel, so as to prevent
the boat, which was loaded with men, from overtaking
them. The boat was not more than twenty yards from the
galliot, when, not ﬁnding her where they left her, they
pulled to the right, and lay on their oars. This gave a moment
of time, but they very soon spied her out. “Carambo!” was
the excla.mation—and the head of the boat was pulled round.
“Down, my lads, in a moment by the swifters,” cried Jack.
“Here’s a boat on board of us.”
The men were in a few seconds on deck, and the others,
who had now sheeted home the topsails, hastened aft. The
vessel soon gathered way, but before that her way was suf-
ﬁeient, the boat had pulled under the counter, and the
Spaniards, letting their cars swing fore and aft, were climb-
ing up, their knives in their teeth. A scuffle ensued, and
they were thrown down again, but they renewed their at-
tempt. Our hero, perceiving a small water or winecask lashed
to the gunwale , cut it loose with his cutlass , and with one of
the men, who was by his side, pushed it over, and dropped
it into the boat. It struck the gunwale, stove a plank, and
the boat began to ﬁll rapidly; in the meantime the galliot
had gained way— the boat could not longer be held on, from
its weight, and dropped astern with the men in it. Those
who were half in and half out were left clinging to the gun-
wale of the vessel, and as they climbed up were secured, and
put down in the cabin. Fortlmately, no ﬁre-arms having
been used on either side, the alarm was not given generally,
but the sentry reported ﬁghting on board one of the vessels,
and the people of the guard-boat were collected, and pulled
out; but they only arrived in time to see that the galliot was
under way, and that the two other vessels from Valparaiso
were not in their berths.

MR. mnsmrmAN nssv. 391

They hastened on shore, gave the alarm: the gun-boats,
of which there were three at the mole, were ordered out, but
half the crew and all the ofﬁcers were on shore, some at balls,
others drinking at taverns or posadas; before they could be
collected, all three vessels were alongside of the Rebiera; and
not aware that anything had been discovered, our hero and
his crew were lulled in security. Jack had gone on board,
leaving fourteen of his men on board the galliot —Gascoigne
had done the same — Mesty still remained on board his
vessel; and they were congratulating themselves, and ordering
the men on board to the windlass, when they heard the sound
of oars.
“Silence! — what is that?” exclaimed Oxbelly. “The
gun-boats or row-boats, as sure as I’m alive!”
At this moment Mesty jumped up the side.
“Massa Easy, I hear row-boat not far off.”
“ So do we, Mesty. Gascoigne, jump into the boat—tell
the men in the prizes to make all sail right out, and leave us
to defend their retreat—stay on board of one and divide
your men.”
“Dat all right, Massa Easy. —Mr. Gascoigne, be smart
—and now, sar, cut cable and make sail; no time get up
anchor.”
This order was given, but although the men were aloft in
a moment, and very expeditious, as the Rebiera payed her
head round and the jib was hoisted, they could perceive the
boom of the three gun-boats pulling and sailing not ﬁve cables’
length from them. Although rather short-handed, topsails,
courses and top-gallant sails were soon set, the men down to
their quarters, and the guns cast loose, before the gun-boats
were close under their stern. Then Jack rounded to, braced
up, and the Rebiera stood across them to the westward.
“Why the devil don’t they ﬁre?” said Jack.
“I tink because they no ab powder,” said Mesty.
Mesty was right—the ammunition chests of the gun-boats
were always landed when they were at the mole, in case of
accidents, which might arise from the crew being continually

with cigars in their mouths, and in the hurry they had quite
forgotten to put them on board.
“At all events, we have powder,” said Jack, “and now
we’ll prove it. Grape and canister, my lads, and take good
alm.”
The commanders of the gun-boats had hailed each other,
and agreed to board the Rebiera, but she now had good way
on her, and sailed faster than they pulled. /A well-directed
broadside astonished them — they had no idea of her force;
and the execution done was so great, that they ﬁrst lay on
their oars and then pulled back to the mole with all speed,
leaving the Rebiera in quiet possession of her prizes, which
had already gained two miles in the ofﬁng.
The Rebiera, as soon as J aek perceived that the gun-boats
had retreated, was put before the wind, and soon closed with
her captures, when she was hove-to till daylight with the
three vessels in company. Gascoigne returned on board,
prize-masters were selected, and Jack determined to keep
them all with him, and take them to Palermo.
CHAPTER XL.
In which there is another slight Difference of Opinion between those who
should he Friends.
Tm: two latteen vessels proved of considerable value, being
laden with copper, hides, and cochineal. The galliot was
laden with sweet-oil, and was also no despicable prize. At
daylight they were all ready, and, to the mortiﬁeation of the
good people of Malaga, sailed-away to the eastward without
interruption.
“Me tink we do dat job pretty well, Massa Easy,” ob-
served Mesty, as he laid the breakfast table.
“Nothing like trying,” replied Gascoigne; “ I’m sure when
we stood into the bay I would have sold all my prize-money
for a doubloon. How do I share, Jack?”
“Only as one of the crew, Ned, for you are a super-

numerary, and our articles and agreement for prize-money
were signed previous to our sailing.”
“I ought to share with Mr. Oxbelly’s class by rights,” re-
plied Gascoigne.
“That would be to take half my prize-money away. I
shall want it all, Mr. Gascoigne, to pacify my wife for giving
her the slip.”
“Ah, very well; I’ll get all I can.”
For ten days they ran down the coast, going much too fast
for the wishes of the crew, who were anxious to make more
money. They seized a ﬁshing boat and put on board of her
the four prisoners, which they had found in the vessels , and
arrived of Barcelona, without falling in with friend or foe.
The next morning; the wind being very light, they discovered
a large vessel at daylight astern of them to the westward,
and soon made her out to be a frigate. She made all sail in
chase, but that gave them very little uneasiness, as they felt
assured that she was a British cruiser. One fear, however,
came over them, that she would, if she came up with them,
impress a portion of their men.
“As certain as I’m here, and Mrs. Oxbelly’s at Southsea,”
said Oxbelly, “they’ll take some of the men—the more so
as, supposing us to be a Spanish convoy, they will be disap-
pointed.”
“They will hardly take them out of the prizes,” observed
Easy.
“I don’t know that; men must be had for His Majesty’s
service somehow. It’s not their fault, Mr. Easy — the navy
must be manned, and as things are so, so things must be.
It’s the king’s prerogative, Mr. Easy, and we cannot ﬁght the
battles of the country without it.”
“ Yes,” replied Gascoigne, “and although, as soon as the
services of seamen are no longer wanted, you ﬁnd that there
are demagogues on shore who exclaim against impressment,
they are quiet enough on the point when they know that their
lives and property depend upon sailors’ exertions.”
“Very true, Mr. Gascoigne, but it’s not our fault if we are


## p. 394 (#402) ############################################

394 MR. MIDSHIPMAN EASY.
obliged to take men by force; it’s the fault of those who do
not legislate so as to prevent the necessity. Mrs. Oxbelly
used to say that she would easily manage the matter if she
were Chancellor of the Exchequer.”
“I dare say Mrs. Oxbelly would make a very good Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer,” replied Gascoigne, smiling; “one
thing is certain, that if they gave the subject half the con-
sideration they have others of less magnitude, an arrange-
ment might be made by which His Majesty’s navy would
never be short of men.”
“N o doubt, no doubt, Mr. Gascoigne; but nevertheless,
the king’s prerogative must never be given up.”
“There I agree with you, Mr. Oxbelly; it must be held in
case of sudden emergency and absolute need.”
“We’l1 argue that point by-and-bye,” replied Jack; “now
let us consult as to our measures. My opinion is, that if I
made more sail we should beat the frigate, but she would
.come up with the prizes.”
“That’s the best thing we can do, Mr. Easy; but let us
send a boat on board of them, and take out all the men that
can possibly be spared, that there may be no excuse for im-
pressing them.”
“Yes,” replied Gascoigne; “and as the wind is falling it
is possible it may fall calm, and they may send their boats;
suppose we separate a mile or two from each other.”
“Dat very good advice,Massa Gascoigne,”observed Mesty.
This plan was acted upon; only three men were left in the
latteens, and four in the galliot, and the vessels, in obedience
to the orders, s_heered off on both sides of the Rebiera, who
made all sail and started ahead of the prizes. This manoeuvre
was perceived on board of the frigate, and made them sure
that it was a Spanish convoy attempting to escape. The
ﬁre-engine was got on deck, sails wetted, and every exertion
made to come up. But about four o’clock in the afternoon,
when the frigate was eight or nine mlles off, it fell calm, as
Gascoigne had predicted, and the heads of all the vessels , as
well as the frigate, were now round the compass.

MR. MIDSHIPMAN nersv. 395
“There’s out boats,” said Mr. Oxbelly_: “they will have a
long pull, and all for nothing.”
“How savage they will be!” observed Gascoigne.
“Never mind that,” repliedJack; “Mesty says that dinner
is ready.” .
After dinner, they all went on deck, and found that the
boats had separated, one pulling for each of the prizes, and
two for the Rebiera. In less than an hour, they would pro-
bably be alongside. _
“And now let us decide how we are to act. We must not
resist, if they attempt to impress the men?”
“I’ve been thinking upon that matter, Mr. Easy, and it
appears to me that the men must be permitted to act as they
please, and that we must be neuter. I, as a lieutenant in His
Majesty’s service, cannot of course act, neither can Mr. Gas-
coigne. You are not in the service, but I should recommend
you to do the same. That the men have a right to resist, if
possible, is admitted; they always do so, and never are
punished for so doing. Under the guns of the frigate, of
course we should only have to submit; but those two boats do
not contain more than twenty-ﬁve men, I should think, and
our men are the stronger party. We had better leave it to
them, and stand neuter.”
“Dat very good advice,” said Mesty; “leab it to us:”
and Mesty walked away forward where the seamen were
already in consultation.
Jack also agreed to the prudence of this measure, and he
perceived that the seamen, after a consultation with Mesty,
were all arming themselves for resistance.
The boats were now close on board, and English colours
were hoisted at the gaff. This did not, however, check the
impetus of the boats, who, with their ensigns trailing in the
still water aster n of them, dashed alongside, and an ofﬁcer
leaped on board, cutlass in hand, followed by the seamen of
the frigate. The men of the Rebiera remained collected
forward — Easy, Gascoigne, and Oxbelly aft.

396 MR. MIDSHIPMAN msv.
“What vessel is this?” cried the lieutenant who com-
manded the boats.
Jack, with the greatest politeness, took off his hat, and
told him that it was the Rebiera letter of marque, and that
the papers were ready for his inspection.
“And the other vessels?”
“Prizes to the Rebiera, cut out of Malaga Bay,” replied
Jack.
“Then you are a privateer,” observed the disappointed
ofﬁcer. “Where are your papers?”
“Mr. Oxbelly, oblige me by bringing them up,” said
Jack.
“Fat Jack of the bone house,” observed the lieutenant,
looking at Oxbelly.
“A lieutenant in His Majesty’s service, of longer standing
than yourself, young man,” replied Oxbelly, ﬁrmly; — “and
who, if he ever meets you in any other situation, will make
you answer for your iusolent remark.”
“Indeed!” observed the lieutenant, ironically; “now, if
you had said you were once a boatswain or gunner.”
“Consider yourself kicked,” roared Oxbelly, losing his
temper.
“Heyday! why, you old porpoise!”
“Sir,” observed Jack, who listened with indignation,
“Mr. Oxbelly is a lieutenant in His Majesty’s service, and
you have no right to insult him, even if he were not.” ‘
“I presume you are all ofﬁcers,” replied the lieutenant.
“I am, sir,” retorted Gascoigne, “an ofﬁcer in His Ma-
jesty’s service, and on board of this vessel by permission of
Captain Sawbridge of the Latona.”
“And I was, until a few months ago, sir,” continued J ack;
“at present I am captain and owner of this vessel— but here
are the papers. You will have no obstruction from us in the
execution of your duty — at the same time, I call upon the
two young gentlemen by your side, and your own men, to
bear witness to what takes place.”
“0 very well, sir—just as you please. Your papers, I

perceive, are all right. Now you will oblige me by mustering
your men.”
“Certainly, sir,” replied Jack: “send all the men aft to
muster, Mr. Oxbelly.”
The men came aft to the mainmast, with Mesty at their
head, and answered to their names. As the men passed
over, the lieutenant made a pencil-mark against ten of them,
who appeared the ﬁnest seamen; and, when the roll had
been called, he ordered those men to get their bags and go
into the boat.
“Sir, as you must observe, I am short-handed, with my
men away in prizes; and I, as commander of this vessel,
protest against this proceeding: if you insist upon taking
them, of course I can do nothing,” observed Jack.
“I do insist, sir; I’m not going on board empty-handed,
at all events.”
“Well, sir, I can say no more,” said Jack, walking aft
to the taﬂrail, to which Oxbelly and Gascoigne had re-
treated.
“Come, my lads, get those men in the boat,” said the
lieutenant.
But the men had all retreated forward in a body, with Mesty
at their head, and had armed themselves. Some of the seamen
of the frigate had gone forward, in obedience to their ofﬁcer,
to lead the men selected into the boat; but they were imme-
diately desired to keep back. The scufﬂe forward attracted
the notice of the lieutenant, who immediately summoned all
his men out of the boats.
“Mutiny, by heavens! Come up all of you, my lads.”
Mesty then came forward, wrth a sabre in one hand and a
pistol in the other, and then addressed the seamen of the
frigate: —
“I tell you dis, my lads — you not so strong as we — you
not got better arms — we not under grm of frigate now, and
ab determination not to go board. ’Pose you want us, come
take us—’pose you can. By all de power, but we make
mince-meat of you, anyhow.”

398 am. mnsmrmx sssv.
The seamen paused — they were ready to ﬁght for their
country, but not to be killed by or kill those who were their
own countrymen, and who were doing exactly what they
would have done themselves. The lieutenant thought other-
wise; he was exasperated at this sensation.
“You black seoundrel, I left you out because I thought
you not worth having, but now I’ll add you to the number.”
“Stop a little,” replied Mesty.
The lieutenant would not take the Ashantee’s very prudent
advice; he ﬂew forward to seize Mesty, who striking him a
blow with the ﬂat of his sabre, almost levelled him to the
deck. At this the men and other ofﬁcers of the frigate darted
forward; but after a short scufﬂe, in which a few wounds
were received, were beaten back into the boats. The lieuten-
ant was thrown in after them, by the nervous arm of Mesty
— and, assailed by cold shot and other missiles, they sheered
off with precipitation, and pulled back in the direction of the
frigate.
“There will be a row about this,” said Oxbelly, “as soon
as they come clear of the vessel. If the frigate gets hold of
us she will show us no mercy. There is a breeze coming from
the northwest; How fortunatel we shall be three leagues
windward, and may escape.” -
“I doubt if she could catch us at any point of sailing:
they may come up with the prizes, but can do nothing with
them.”
“No, the boats which boarded them are already returned
to the frigate; she must wait for them, and that will give
us a start, and it will be night before they can make sail.”
“Fire a gun for the prizes to close,” said Jack; “we will
put the men on board again, and then be off to Palermo as
fast as we can.”
“We can do no better,” said Oxbelly. “If ever 1 chance
to meet that fellow again, I will trouble him to repeat his
words. Trim the sails, my lads.”
“His language was unpardonable," observed Jack.
“ Since I’ve been in the service, Mr. Easy, I have always

observed that some ofﬁcers appear to imagine, that because
they are under the king’s pennant, they are warranted in in-
sulting and tyrannising over all those who have not the honour
to hoist it; whereas , the very fact of their being king’s ofﬁcers
should be an inducement to them to show an example of
courtesy and gentlemanly conduct in the execution of their
duty, however unpleasant it may be.”
“It is only those who, insigniﬁcant themselves, want to
make themselves of importance by the pennant they serve
under,” replied our hero.
“Very true, Mr. Easy; but you are not aware that a great
part of the ill-will shown to the service, is owing to the in-
solence of those young men in ofﬁce. The king’s name is a
warrant for every species of tyranny and unwarrantable
conduct. I remember Mrs. Oxbelly telling one of them,
when k ”
“I beg your pardon, Mr. Oxbelly,” interrupted Jack, “but
we have no time to chat now; the breeze is coming down fast,
and I perceive the prizes are closing. Let us lower down the
boat, send the men on board again, and give them their
orders — which I will do in writing, in case they part com-
pany.’i
“Very true, sir. It will be dark in half an hour, and as -
we are now standing in-shore, they will think that we intend
to remain on the coast. As soon as it is quite dark we will
shape our course for Palermo. I will go down and look at
the chart.”

,s CHAPTER XL 1.
Whrch winds up the nautical Adventures of Mr. Midshipman Easy.
In half an hour the prizes were again alongside , the men
put on board, and the boat hoisted up. The frigate still re-
mained becalmed to leeward, and hoisted in her boats. They
watched until she was hid by the shades of night, and then
wearing round stood away, with the wind two points free, for
the coast of Sicily. The next morning when the sun rose
there was nothing in sight. Strange anomaly, in a state of
high civilisation, where you ﬁnd your own countrymen
avoided and more dreaded than even your foes!
The run was prosperous, the weather was ﬁne, and the
prizes did not part company.
On the sixteenth day the Rebiera and her convoy anchored
in Palermo Bay. The wind was light in the morning that
they stood in, and as Jack had a large blue ﬂag with Rebiera
in white letters hoisted at the main, Don Philip and Don
Martin were on board andigreeting our hero, before the Re-
biera’s anchor had plunged into the clear blue water.
The information which our hero received, after having
been assured of the health of Agnes and her parents, was
satisfactory. The disappearance of the friar had, at ﬁrst,
occasioned much surprise; but as the servants of Don Rebiera
swore to his return without the black, and the letter of Don
Rebiera, sent to the convent, requesting his presence, was
opened and read, there was no suspicion against the family.
A hundred conjectures had been aﬂoat, but gradually they
had subsided, and it was at last supposed that he had been
carried off by the banditti, some of whom had been taken,
and acknowledged that they had seized a friar, on a day
which they could not recollect. The reader will remember
that it was Mesty.
The Rebiera received pratique, and Jack hastened on
shore with Don Philip and his brother, and was once more in

company of Agnes, who, in our hero’s opinion, had improved
since his departure. Most young men in love think the same
after an absence, provided it is not too long. The prizes were
sold and the money distributed, and every man was satisﬁed,
as the cargoes fetched a larger sum than they had antici-
pated. .
We must pass over the ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ of Don Rebiera
and his lady, the pleading of Jack for immediate nuptials,
the unwillingness of the mother to part with her only
daughter, the family consultation, the dowry, and all these
particulars. A month after his arrival Jack was married, and
was, of course, as happy as the day was long.
A few days afterwards, Mr. Oxbelly advised departure, as
the expenses of the vessel were heavy, and it was his duty so
to do. Don Philip and Don Martin obtained leave to go to
England, with their sister and her husband. Nevertheless,
Jack, who found Palermo a very pleasant residence, was per-
suaded by the Don and his wife to remain there a month,
and then there was crying and sobbing, and embracing, and
embarking; and at last the Rebiera, whose cabins had been
arranged for the reception of the party, weighed and made .
sail for Malta, Jack having promised to call upon the
governor.
“In four days they anchored in Valette Harbour, and
Jack paid his respects to his old friend, who was very glad
to see him. The governor sent his own barge for Mrs. Easy,
and she was installed in the state apartments, which were
acknowledged to be very comfortable. Our hero had, as
usual, a long story to tell the governor, and the governor
listened to it very attentively, probably because he thought
it would be the last, which opportunity Jack employed to
narrate the unfortunate end of his father.
“I would not have said so at the time, Mr. Easy, but now
the wound is healed, I tell you, that it is the best thing that
could have happened —- poor old gentleman! he was mad in-
deed.”
Our hero remained a fortnight at Malta, and then Signora

Easy was re-embarked, and once more the Rebiera made
sail.
“Fare you well, my lad; what I have seen of your bro-
thers-in-law pleases me much; and as for your wife, it will
be your own fault if she is not all that you would wish. If
ever I come to England again, I will pay my ﬁrst visit to
Forest Hill. God bless you!”
But Sir Thomas never did go back to England, and this
was their ﬁnal adieu. Once more the Rebiera pursued her
course, stopped a day or two at Gibraltar, shared the pro-
ceeds of the captured gun-boat, and then made sail for Eng-
land, where she arrived without adventure or accident in
three weeks. Thus ended the last cruise of Mr. Midshipman
Easy. As soon as their quarantine at the Motherbank was
over, they disembarked, and found Dr. Middleton and Mr.
Hanson waiting for them at the George Hotel. Our hero
scarcely had time to introduce his wife, when the waiter said,
that a lady wished to speak to him. She did not wait to
know if Jack was visible, but forced her way past him. Jack
looked at her large proportions, and decided at once that it
‘ must be Mrs. Oxbelly, in which conjecture he was right.
“Pray, sir, what do you mean by carrying of my husband
in that way?” exclaimed the lady, red with anger.
“God forbid that I should have to carry your husband,
Mrs. Oxbelly, he is rather too heavy.”
“Yes, sir, but it’s little better than kidnapping, and there’s
a law for kidnapping children at all events. I shall send my
lawyer to you, that you may depend upon.”
“You hardly can consider your husband as a child, Mrs.
Oxbelly,” replied Jack, laughing.
“Very well, sir, we shall see. Pray, where is he now?”
“He is on board, Mrs. Oxbelly, and will be delighted to
see you.”
“I’m not quite so sure of that.”
“He’s very anxious to see little Billy,” said Gascoigne.
“What do you know of little Billy, young man?”

“And more than anxious to be on shore again. He’s quite
tired of sleeping single, Mrs. Oxbelly.”
“Ah, very well, he has been talking, has he? very well,”
exclaimed the lady, in a rage.
“But,” said Easy, “I am happy to say, that with pay and
prizemoney, during his short absence, he has brought home
nearly ﬁve hundred pounds.”
“Five hundred pounds! — you don’t say so, sir?” ex-
claimed Mrs. Oxbelly; “are you sure of that?”
“Quite sure,” rejoined Gascoigne.
“Five hundred pounds! — Well, that is comfortable —
dear me! how glad I shall be to see him! Well, Mr. Easy, it
was hard to part with him in so unhandsome a way — but
all’s for the best in this world. What a dear nice lady your
wife is, Mr. Easy — but I won’t intrude — I beg pardon.
Where is the brig, Mr. Easy?”
“Now coming into harbour,” replied Gascoigne; “if you
bargain, you can get off for two-pence.”
“Five hundred pounds!” exclaimed Mrs. Oxbelly, whose
wrath was now appeased.
“By all power, she no fool of a woman dat,” said Mesty,
as she retreated curtseying. “I tink Mr. Oxbelly very right
sleep tingle.”
We have now come to the end of our hero’s adventures:
that afternoon they all started for Forest Hill, where every-
thing was ready for their reception. The Rebiera’s men were
paid off, and were soon distributed on board of His Majesty’s
ships; the vessel was sold, and Mr. Oxbelly retired to
Southsea, to the society of his wife and little Billy. \Vhether
he obtained from his wife a divorce ‘de thoro’ is not handed
down.
Our hero, who was now of age, invited all within twenty
miles of home to balls and dinners, became a great favourite,
kept a pack of hounds, rode with the foremost, received a
deputation to stand for the county, on the conservative in-
terest, was elected without much expense, which was very
wonderful, and took his seat in parliament. Don Philip and

404. r. MIDSHIPMAN EASY.
Don Martin, after two months’ stay, took their passage back
to Palermo, fully satisﬁed with the prospects of their sister
as to competence and happiness. Jack had no occasion to
argue the point with Agnes; she conformed at once to the
religion of her husband, proved an excellent and affectionate
wife, and eventually the mother of four children, three boys
and a girl.
Mesty held his post with dignity, and proved himself
trustworthy. Gascoigne, by the interest of the conservative
member, soon obtained the rank of post-captain, and was
always his devoted and sincere friend. And thus ends the
. history of Mr. Midshipman Easy.
THE END.
