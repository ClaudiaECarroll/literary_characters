PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.
NOV 17 87 aile ?
THE writer has laid his hand to a task somewhat unusual
and unpleasant, as well as very difficult-no less a task
than to mend his faults by the light of adverse criticism.
For he found his reviewers, upon the whole, so nearly
of one opinion, that only a coxcomb could impugn a
verdict so decisive. "Two or three virtues and a score
of vices," is that verdict's summary. The descriptive
parts were said to be good, the characters distinctly
drawn, the style original, and the plot well conceived
and striking. But these merits were more than balanced
by “obscurity, want of proportion, crudeness, imperfect
development, pedantry, involution of diction, prolixity,
inner consciousness," and manifold other portentous
faults understanded of reviewers.

PREFACE.
Confessing the truth of all these findings, savé
“pedantry”—which he has not even learning enough
to simulate—the present writer has done his best to
mend the error of his ways. A new book might have
been written while this old one was a-mending ; but
half the value of discipline consists in mortification. If
this lesson imparts to the writer more self-control and
less self-content, more breadth of view and less petu-
lance, he may, in length of time, attain the reward of
much revision—the power of affording pleasure upon
reperusal.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
CHAPTER I.
A HOUSE AMONG THE WOODLANDS.
W
ITHIN the New Forest, and not far from its western
boundary, as defined by the second perambulation
of the good King Edward the First, stands the old
mansion of the Nowells, the Hall of Nowelhurst. Not
content with mere exemption from all feudal service,
their estate claims privileges, both by grant and
custom. The benefit of Morefall trees in six walks of the forest,
the right of digging marl, and turbary illimitable, common of
pannage, and licence of drawing akermast, pastime even of hawking
over some parts of the Crown land,-all these have been pre-
served by careful stewards at due interval. With many of these
privileges the Royal Commissioners will deal in a spirit of scant
courtesy, when the Nowell influence is lost in the neighbouring
boroughs; but as yet these claims have not been treated like
those of some poor commoners.
And if the rights of that ancient family are ever called in
question, some there are which will require a special act to abolish
them. For Charles the Second, of merry memory (saddened
somewhat of late years), espied among the maids of honour an
uncommonly pretty girl, whose name was Frances Nowell. He
suddenly remembered, what had hitherto quite escaped him, how
old Sir Cradock Nowell-beautiful Fanny's father—had saved
him from a pike-thrust during Cromwell's “crowning mercy.”. In
gratitude, of course, for this, he began to pay most warm attentions
to the Hampshire maiden. He propitiated that ancient knight
B

with the only boon he craved-craved hitherto all in vain-a
plenary grant of easements in the neighbourhood of his home.
Soon as the charter had received the royal seal and signature, the
old gentleman briskly thrust it away in the folds of his velvet
mantle. Then taking the same view of gratitude which his liege
and master took, home he went without delay to secure his
privileges. When the king heard of his departure, without any
kissing of hands, he was in no wise disconcerted; it was the very
thing he had intended. But when he heard that lovely Fanny was
gone in the same old rickety coach, even ere he began to
whisper, and with no leave of the queen, His Majesty swore his
utmost for nearly half an hour. Then having spent his fury, he
laughed at the “sell," as he would have called it if the slang had
been invented, and turned his royal attention to another of his
wife's young maidens.
Nowelhurst Hall looks too respectable for any loose doings of
any sort. It stands well away from the weeping of trees, like
virtue shy of sentiment, and therefore has all the wealth of foliage
shed, just where it pleases, around it. From a rising ground the
house has sweet view of all the forest changes, and has seen three
hundred springs wake in glory, and three hundred autumns
waning. Spreading away from it wider, wider, slopes “the Chase," as
they call it, with great trees stretching paternal arms in the vain
attempt to hold it. For two months of the twelve, when the
heather is in blossom, all that chase is a glowing reach of amaranth
and purple. Then it fades away to pale orange, dim olive, and a
rusty brown when Christmas shudders over it; and so throughout
young green and russet, till the July tint comes back again. Often-
times in the fresh spring morning the blackcocks—“heathpoults”
as they call them-lift their necks in the livening heather, swell
the ruffing breasts, and crow for their rivals to come and spar
with them. Down the slope the thickening trees assemble into a
massive wood, tufted here and there with hues of a varying richness;
but for the main of it, swelling and waving, crisping, fronding,
feathering, coying, and darkening here and there, until it reaches the
silver mirror of the spreading sea. And the seaman, looking upwards
from the war-ship bound for tropic countries, looking back at his
native land, for the last of all times it may be, over brushwood
waves, and billows of trees, and the long heave of the gorse-land
cries aloud, “I shall see no sight like that, till I come home
again."
South-west of the house, half a mile away, and scattered along
the warren, the simple village of Nowelhurst digests its own ideas.
in and out the houses stand, endwise, crossways, akimbo, anyhow
except upside down, and some even tending that way. It looks
like a game of dominoes, when the leaves of the table have opened
and gaped betwixt the players. Nevertheless, it is all good

A HOUSE AMONG THE WOODLANDS.

English ; for none are bitterly poor there ; in any case of illness,
they have the great house to help them, not proudly, but with
feeling; and, more than this, they have a parson who leads
instead of driving them. There are two little shops exceedingly
anxious to under-sell each other, and one mild alehouse conducted
upon the very lowest chemical, but the highest moral principles.
Morality under pressure, a cynic perhaps might call it, for the publican
knows, and so do his customers, that if poachers were encouraged
there, or any uproarious doings permitted (except in the week of
the old and new year), down would come his licence-board, like a
flag hauled in at sunset.
Pleasant folk, who there do dwell, calling their existence “life,"
and on the whole enjoying it more than many of us do ; forasmuch
as they know their neighbours far better than themselves, and
perceive each other's need of trial, and console him when he gets
it. What village, hamlet, or even house has not its little bickerings?
Good will, however, and sympathy grow warmer after pepper-
ing.
No hurst village is not on the main road, but keeps a
straggling companionship with a quiet parish highway which re-
quires much encouragement. This little highway does its best
to blink the many difficulties, or, if that may not be, to compromise
them, and establish a pleasant footing upon its devious wandering
course from the Lymington road to Ringwood. Here it retires to
escape the frown of a heavy-browed crest of furzery,and then it returns
and shrinks into its sides, because a little stream has babbled at it.
It even seems to dip, or jump, as the courtesies may demand, for
fear of prying into an old oak's storey or dusting a cottage-garden.
The hard-hearted traveller who lives express, and is bound for the
train at Ringwood, blesses amiss, both up hill and down dale, the
quiet lane's inconsistency. What right has any road to do any thing
but go straight on end to its purpose ? What decent lane stops for
a gossip with flowers-flowers overhanging the steep ascent, or
eavesdropping on the rabbit-holes? And as for the beauty of
ferns-confound them, they shelter the horse-fly—that horrible
forest-fly, whose tickling no civilized horse can endure. Even
locusts he has heard of as abounding in the New Forest; and if a
swarm of them comes this very hot weather, good-bye to him,
horse and trap, newest patterns, sweet plaid, and chaste things.
But we who carry no chronometer, neither puff locomotively-
now he is round the corner-let us saunter down this lane beyond
the mark-oak and the blacksmith's, even to the sandy rise whence
the Hall is seen. The rabbits are peeping forth again, for the
dew is spreading quietude : the sun has just finished a good day's
work and is off for the western waters. Over the rounded heads
and bosses, and then the darker dimples of the many-coloured
foliage-many-coloured even now with summer's glory fusing it-

CRADOCK NOWELL.
over heads and shoulders, and breasts of heaving green, floods the
lucid amber, trembling at its own beauty, and now descends the leni-
ency of the July sun. Nowevery moment has its difference. Having
once acknowledged that he may have been too downright in his
ride of triumph, the sun, like every generous nature, scatters
broadcast his amends. Over holt, and knoll, and lea, and narrow
dingle, scooped with shadow where the brook is wimpling, and
through the breaks of grass and gravel, where the heather purples,
scarcely yet in prime flush, and down the tall wood overhanging,
mossed and lichened, green and grey, as the grove of Druids-over,
through, and under all flows pervading sunset. Then the birds
begin discoursing of the thoughts within them—thoughts that are
all happiness, and thrill and swell in utterance. Through the voice
of the thicket-birds—the mavis, the whinchats, and the warblers
--comes the tap of the yaffingale, the sharp, short cry of the
honey-buzzard above the squirrel's cage, and the plaining of the
turtle-dove.
But from birds and flowers, winding roads and woods, and
waters where the trout are leaping, come we back to the only thing
that interests a man much-the life, the doings, and the endings
of his fellow-men. From this piece of yellow lane, where the
tree-roots twist and wrestle, we can see the great old house,
winking out of countless windows, deep with sloping shadows,
mantling back from the clasp of the forest, in a stately, sad reserve.
It looks like a house that can endure and not talk about affliction,
that could disclose some tales of passion were it not undignified, that
remembers many a generation, and is mildly sorry for them. Oh!
house of the Nowells, grey with shadow, wrapped in lonely
grandeur, cold with the dews of evening and the tone of sylvan
nightfall, never through twenty generations have you known a
darker fortune than is lowering now around you, growing through
the summer months, deepening ere the leaves drop! All men, we
know, are born for trial, to work, to bear, to purify; but some
there are whom God has marked for sorrow from their cradle. And
strange as it appears to us, whose image is inverted, almost always
these are they who seem to lack no probation. The gentle and
the large of heart, the meek and unpretending, yet gifted with a
rank of mind that needs no self-assertion, trebly vexed in this
wayfaring, may they not be blest tenfold in the everlasting
equipoise ?
So there is a grander time for gazing at that same old house, than
even the young flush of spring, or warm plenitude of July. It
is the nobility of October, when the calm of resignation rests upon
the time-worn woods : when the weary trees accept the touch
of autumn sweetly, all with divers lines of oval, and the different
depths of tint, spreading at a distance one great pomp of rival
harmony.

WEIGHED AND FOUND WANTING.

If we stand here, and from great things turn our eyes to little
ones, we can see the congregation of that ancient country church,
crossing the narrow bridge this lovely Sunday evening, toward the
cottage homestead. The church and churchyard are put well
away, as respect for religion ordains of us : the power of the
parson's words has not departed from the docile, solid, and faithful
West-Saxon mind. Yet are these folk talking briskly, when they
ought to be meditating.
The question is, when Lady Nowell will give an heir to the
name, the house, the village, the estates, worth fifty thousand a
year—an heir long time expected, hoped for in vain through six
long years, now reasonably looked for. All the matrons have
settled that it must be on a Sunday ; every body knows that Sunday
is the day for birth and battle. Therefore all good women fixed it
for that same day fortnight. But while they were all agreeing
exactly how it should come to pass-behold, it was over, and two
fine fellows were added to the population.
CHAPTER II.
WEIGHED AND FOUND WANTING.
“WHISHTREW, whishtrew, every bit of me! Whativer will I do,
God knows. The blue ribbon there forenint me, and the blessed
infants one to aich side !"
The good nurse fell against a chest of drawers, as she uttered
this loud lament; the colour ebbed from her cherry cheeks, and
her sturdy form shook with terror. She had scarcely turned her
back, she could swear, upon her precious charges; and now only
look at the murder of it! Two little cots stood side by side, not
more than four feet asunder; and on each cot fast asleep lay a fine
baby, some three or four days old. Upon the floor between them
was a small rosette of blue ribbon. The infants were slumbering
happily, and breathing as calmly as could be. Each queer little
dump of a face was nestled into its pillow; and a small red podge,
which was meant for an arm, lay crosswise upon the flannel.
Nothing could look more delicious to the eyes of a fine young
Nevertheless, that fine young woman, Mrs. Biddy O'Gaghan,
stood gazing from one cot to the other, in hopeless and helpless
dismay. Her comely round face was drawn out with horror, her
mouth wide open, and large tears stealing into her broad blue
woman.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“And the illigant spots upon them, as like as two Blemishing
spannels; nor the blissed saints in heaven, if so be they was tuk
to glory, afore they do be made hairyticks, cudn't know one from
the ither, no more nor the winds from the brazes. And there go
the doctor's bell again! Oh whurrastrew, whurra, whurra !”
Now Biddy O'Gaghan would scarcely have been head-nurse at
Nowelhurst Hall, before she was thirty years old, but for her quick
self-reliance. She was not the woman therefore to wring her
hands long, and look foolish. Her Irish wit soon suggested
so many modes of solution, all so easy, and all so delightfully free
from reason, that the only question was how to listen to all at once.
First she went and bolted carefully both the doors of the nursery.
Then, with a look of triumph, she rushed to her yellow workbox,
snatched up a roll of narrow tape, some pins, and a pair of scissors,
and knelt upon the floor very gingerly, where the blue ribbon lay.
Then, having pinned one end of the tape to the centre of the rosette,
and the rosette itself to the carpet, she let the roll run with one
hand, and drew the tape tight with the other, until it arrived at the
nose of the babe ensconced in the right-hand cot. There she cut it
off sharply, with a snip that awoke the child, who looked at her
contemplatively from a pair of large grey eyes. Leaving him to his
meditations, she turned the tape on the pin, and drew it towards the
nasal apology of the other infant. The measure would not reach;
it was short by an inch and a half. What clearer proof could be
given of the title to knot and pendency?
But alas for Biddy's triumph! The infant of the last measure-
ment awoke at that very moment, and lifting his soft fat legs, in
order to cry with more comfort, disclosed the awkward fact that his
left knee was nearer by three inches to the all-important rosette,
than was any part of his brother. Biddy shook anew, as she drew
the tape to the dimples. What is the legal centre of a human
being? Is it the seat of the mind, heart, or soul, or is it the centre of
gravity?
Ere further measurement could be essayed, all the premises
were gone utterly ; for the baby upon the right contrived to turn in
the flannels, as an unsettled silkworm pupa rolls in his cocoon.
And he managed to revolve in the wrong direction; it was his fate
through life. Instead of coming towards the rosette, as a selfish
baby would have done, away he went, with his grey eyes blinking
at the handle of the door. Then he put up his lips, like the ring of
a limpet, and poked both his little fists into his mouth.
“Well, I never," cried Bridget; “that settles it altogether.
Plase the saints an' he were a rogue, it's this way he'd ha' come
on his blessed little empty belly. My darlin' dumplin'
dillikins, it's you as it belongs to, and a fool I must be to doubt of
it. Don't I know the bend o’your nose, and the way your purty
lips dribbles, then ? And to think I was near a robbing you !

What with the sitting up o' nights, and the worry of that carroty
spalpeen, and the way as they sends my meals up, Paddy
O’Gaghan, as is in glory, wud take me for another man's wife.”
With great relief and strong conviction, Mrs. O'Gaghan began
to stitch the truant rosette upon the cap of the last-mentioned
baby, whence (or from that of the other) it had dropped through
her own quick carelessness, before they were cuddled away. And
with that ribbon she stitched upon him the heritage of the old
family, the name of “Cradock Nowell,” borne by the eight last
baronets, and the largest estates and foremost rank in all the fair
county of Hants.
Sure an' it won't come off again,” said Biddy to the baby, as
she laid down her needle, for, like all genuine Irishwomen, she
despised a thimble; “and it's meself as is to blame, for not taking
a nick on your ear, dear. A big fool I must be only to plait it in
afore, and only for thinkin' as it wud come cross-ways, when you
wint to your blissed mammy, dear. And little more you
be likely to get there, I'm afeared, me darlin'. An’skeared any
body would be to hoort so much as a hair o' your skull, until such
time as you has any, you little jule of jewels, and I kisses every bit
on you, and knows what you be thinking on in the dead hoor of
the night. Bless your ticksy-wicksies, and the ground as you shall
step on, and the childer as you shall have.”
Unprepared as yet to contemplate the pleasures of paternity,
Master Cradock Nowell elect opened great eyes and great mouth,
in the untutored wrath of hunger, while from the other cot arose a
lusty yell, as of one unhardened yet to all the injustice of this
world. That bitter cry awoke the softness and the faint misgivings
of the Irishwoman's heart.
“And the pity of the world it is ye can't both be the eldest. And
bedad you should if Biddy O'Gaghan had the making of the laws.
There shan't be any one iver can say as ye haven't had justice, me
honey."
Leaving both the unconscious claimants snugly wrapped and
smiling, she called to her assistant, now calmly at tea in an inner
“Miss Penny, run down now just, without thinking, and
give my compliments, Mrs. O'Gaghan's kind compliments to the
housekeeper's room, and would Mrs. Toaster oblige me with her
big square scales? No weights you needn't bring, you know.
Only the scales, and be quick with them.”
“And please, ma'am, what shall I say as you wants them for?”
“Never you mind, Jane Penny. Wait you till your betters asks of
you. And mayn't I weigh my grandfather's silver, without ask
you, Jane Penny? And likely you'd rather not, and good reason
for that same, I dessay, after the way as I leaves it open.”
Overlooking this innuendo, as well as the slight difficulty of
weighing, without weights, imaginary bullion, Miss Penny hurried
room.

away; for the wrath of the nurse was rising, and it was not a thing
to be tampered with. When Jane returned with the beam of
justice, and lingered fondly in the doorway to watch its application,
the head-nurse sidled her grandly into the little room, and turned
the key upon her.
“Go and finish your tea, Miss Penny. No draughts in this
room, if you please, miss. Save their little sowls, and divil a hair
upon them. Now come here, my two chickabiddies.”
Adjusting the scales on the bed, where at night she lay with the
infants warm upon her, she took the two red lumps of innocence in
her well-rounded arms, and laid one in either scale. As she did so,
they both looked up and smiled : it reminded them, perhaps, of
being laid in their cradles. Blessing them both, and without
any nervousness—for to her it could make no difference—she
raised by the handle the balance. It was a very nice question-
which baby rose first from the counterpane. So very slight was the
difference, that the rosette itself might almost have turned the scale.
But there was a perceptible difference, of perhaps about half an
ounce, and that in favour of the sweet-tempered babe who now
possessed the ribbon; and who, as the other rose slowly before
him, lay in the loosest manner smiling, not having learned how to
suck his thumb.
No further mistrust was left in the mind of Mrs. O'Gaghan.
Henceforth that rosetted infant is like to outweigh and outmeasure
his brother, a hundredfold, a thousandfold, in every balance, by
every standard, save those of self, and of true love, and the kingdom
that has no coinage.
CHAPTER III.
A FALSE CONCORD.
THE reason why Mrs. O'Gaghan, generally so prompt and careful,
though never very lucid, had neglected better precautions in a
matter so important, was simply and solely this, Lady Nowell, the
delicate mother, was dying. Ít had been known, ever since the
birth, that she had scarcely any chance of recovery. And Biddy
loved her with all her warm heart, and so did every one in the
house who owned a heart that could love. In the great anxiety, all
things were upside down. None of the servants knew where to go
for orders, and few could act without them; the housekeeper was
all abroad; house-steward there was none; head-butler Hogstaff
cried in his pantry, and wiped his eyes with the leathers; and, as

for the master of them all, Sir Cradock Nowell himself, he rarely
left the darkened room, and when he did he could not see well.
A sweet frail creature the young mother was, wedded too early,
as happens here more often than we are aware of. Then disap-
pointed, and grieving still more at her husband's disappointment,
she had set her whole heart so long and so vainly upon a mother's
happiness, that now it was come she had not the strength to do
any thing more than smile at it. And her smile was sweet as well
as sad, even while she knew she was dying ; she felt so proud of
those two fine boys, and the life that lay before them.
When her eyes for the last time rested (except from heaven) upon
them, instead of showing any doubt or flutter of uneasiness, she
simply took her husband's hand, without the strength to lift it, and
could not lead, but somehow guided, till it lay where she desired.
So it lay on the little ones, quite equally divided ; and though she
could not speak, he felt that with her dying breath she prayed him
to regard the twain alike.
Mrs. O’Gaghan was standing by, and her views of the situation
were altogeth different. She had broug the babes for the very
purpose of “larning which was which of them.”
“If I've made it wrong, then, she'll make it right,” thought the
conscientious Biddy. “I can take my oath on't she knowed the
differ from the very first, though nobody else couldn't see it, barring
the caps they was put in. Now, if only that gossoon will kape his
self out of the way a bit, and it can't hurt the poor darlin'—and the
blessing as comes from the death's gaze-
Mrs. O'Gaghan's scheme was spoiled by the entrance of the
doctor, a spare, short man, with a fiery face, red hair, and quick
little eyes. He was not more than thirty years old, but knew his
duties thoroughly; nevertheless, he would not have been there but
for the sudden emergency. He whispered to Biddy to leave the
room and take the babies with her. He had ridden hard for a
certain new cordial used in desperate cases, and only in perfect
darkness.
The nurse pushed him back with her elbow, and held the infants
with their heads propped up, that each might do his utmost. But
the mother's gaze was not of this world, as poor Biddy hoped-her
heart and soul were going farther than rosettes and titles. In one
long, yearning look, she lingered on her new-born babes, then
turned those hazy eyes in fondness to her kneeling husband, then
tried to pray or bless the three, and feebly shivered, and then died.
Sir Cradock Nowell had never dreamed of losing his wife in this
way. Violet Incledon seemed too young to think about her dying.
She was eighteen years of age, and he was six-and-thirty, when
they vowed for all their lives to cleave to one another. And how
they had loved one another was now both a pain and a pleasure to
dwell upon.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
A few days after the funeral, the lonely man was sauntering here
and there about his book-room, caring no whit for his once-loved
books, for the news of the day, or his business, and listless to look
at any thing, even the autumn sunset; when the door was opened
quietly, and shyly through the shadows stole his schoolfellow of
yore, his old and true friend, John Rosedew.
Never lived on the face of earth a nobler man than John Rose-
dew : very well born in a quiet way, and thoroughly educated,
gifted with a mind of vast and accurate comprehension, yet with
such quick ways of humour that all children loved him. Finished
gentleman as he was, nothing did so well become him as his own
humility. Easily content with others, never satisfied with himself,
even now, at the age of forty, he had not overcome the distance of
a sensitive nature. And, first-rate scholar as he was, he would have
lost his class at Oxford solely through that shyness, unless a kind
examiner, who saw his blushing agony, had turned from some
commonplace of Sophocles to a glorious passage of Pindar. Then,
carried away by the noble poet, John Rosedew forgot the schools,
the audience, even the row of examiners, and gave grand thoughts
their grand expression, breathing free as the winds of heaven. Nor
till his voice began to falter from the high emotion, and his heart
beat fast, though not from shame, and the tears of genius touched
by genius shone through twenty centuries, not till then knew he, or
guessed, that every eye was fixed upon him, that every heart was
thrilling, that even the stiff examiners bent forward like eager
children, and the young men in the gallery could scarcely keep
from chéering. Then suddenly, in the full sweep of magnificence,
he stopped, like an eagle shot.
Now this parson, ruddy cheeked, with a lock of light brown hair
astray upon his forehead, and his pale, blue eyes looking much as
if he had just awoke and rubbed them, came shyly and with deep
embarrassment into the darkening room. For day's and days he
had thought and thought, but could not see his way to it, whether,
and when, and how, he ought to visit his ancient friend. His own
heart first suggested that he ought to go at once, if only to show the
bereaved one that still there were some to love him. To this right
impulse—and the impulse oí a heart like his could not be wrong--
rose counter-checks of worldly knowledge, such very little as he
had.
It seemed to many people strange and unaccountable, that if Mr.
Rosedew piqued himself upon any thing whatever, it was not on
his learning, his candour, or benevolence, it was not on his gentle
bearing, or the chivalry of his soul, but on a fine acquirement,
whereof in all opinions (except, indeed, his own) he possessed no jot
or tittle—a strictly-disciplined and astute experience of the world.
Now this supposed experience told him that it might seem coarse
and forward to offer the hard grasp of friendship ere the soft clasp

A FALSE CONCORD.
II
of love was cold ; that he, as the clergyman of the parish, inust not
presume upon his office; that no proud man could ever bear to
have his anguish pryed into, These and many other doubts over-
bore his strong desire to be at the side of his dear old friend.
Suddenly and to his great relief-for he knew not how to begin,
though he felt how and mistrusted it—the old friend turned upon
him from his lonely pacing, and held out both his hands. Not a
word was said by either ; what they meant required no telling, or
was told by silence. Long time they sat in the western windo:v,
John Rosedew keeping his eyes from sunset, which did not suit
them then.
At last he said, in a very low voice, which it cost himn much to
find,-
“ What name, dear Cradock, for the younger babe ? Your own,
of course, for the elder.”
No name, John, but his sweet mother's ; unless you like to add
his uncle's."
John Rosedew was puzzled lamentably. He could not bear to
worry his friend any more upon the subject; and yet it seemed to
him sad, false concord, that a boy's name should be “Violet.” But
he argued that, in botanical fact, a violet is male as well as female,
and at such a time he could not think of thwarting a widower's
yearnings. In spite of all his worldly knowledge, it never occurred
to his simple mind that poor Sir Cradock meant the lady's maiden
surname, the good old name of Incledon. And yet he had a case
in point even then before him, for Sir Cradock Nowell's brother
bore the name of “ Clayton;" which name John Rosedew added
now, and found relief in doing so.
So it came to pass, that the babe without rosette was baptized
“ Violet Clayton," while the owner of that ornament received the
name of “ Cradock”-Cradock Nowell, now the ninth in lineal
succession. The father was still too broken down to care about
being present; godfathers and godmothers made their vows very
cleverly by proxy: Mrs. O'Gaghan held the infants, and one of
them cried, and the other laughed. The rosette was there in all its
glory, and received a tidy sprinkle; and the wearer of it was, as
usual, the one who took things easily. As the common children
said, who came to see the great ones “loustering ,” the whole affair
was much more like a “white burying” than a baptism. Never-
theless, the tenants and labourers moistened their semi-regenerate
clay with many a fontful of good ale, to ensure the success of the
ceremony.
I “Loustering” in West Saxon = “ blubbering" in school-slang.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
CHAPTER IV.
UNCLE JOHN'S BABY,
POOR Lady Nowell had become a mother, as indeed we learned
from the village gossip, nearly a fortnight before the expected time.
Dr. Jellicorse Buller, a very skilful man, in whom the Hall had
long confided, was suddenly called to London the day before that
on which we last gazed at the Hall from the Ringwood road. With
Sir Cradock's full consent, he obeyed the tempting su nmons. So
in the hurry and flutter of that October Sunday, it seemed a most
lucky thing to obtain, in a thinly-peopled district, the prompt at-
tendance of any medical man. And but that a gallant regiment
then happened to be on the march from Dorchester to Southampton,
there to embark for India, no masculine aid would have been forth-
coming till after the event. But the regimental surgeon, whose
name was Rufus Hutton, did all that human skill could do, and
saved the lives of both the infants, but could not save the young
mother. Having earned Sir Cradock's lasting gratitude, and Biddy
O’Gaghan's strong contempt, he was compelled to rejoin his regi-
ment, then actually embarking.
The twins grew fast, and throve amain, under Mrs. O'Gaghan's
motherly care, and shook the deep-rooted country faith, that children
brought up by hand are sure to be puny weaklings. Nor was it
long till nature reasserted her authority, and claimed her rights of
compensation. The father began to think inore and more, first of
his duty towards the dead mother, and then of his duty towards his
children ; and ere long affection set to work, and drove duty away
tiil called for, which happened as we shall see presently. By the
time those two pretty babies were “busy about their teeth,” Cradock
Nowell the elder was so deep in odontology, that Biddy herself
could not answer him, and was afraid to ask any questions. He
watched each little white cropper, as a girl peers day by day into
a starting hyacinth. Then, when they could walk, they followed
their father every where, and he never was happy without them.
It was a pretty thing to see them toddling down the long passages,
stopping by the walls to prattle, crawling at the slippery parts, where
the newly-invented tiles shone, or sitting down in gravest council
over some new ball or top, or simply kissing one another, when
either had been overtaken by the unutterable anguish of an upset
babe's despair. And when the little storm was over, and they put
their fat legs forward, sitting side by side, and relapsing into good
content with life, while their bright locks flowed together, and their
lisping red lips opened with the folly of a sage remark, or the
wisdom of a smile there was no woman in the world could look
and not long to kiss them.

UNCLE JOHN'S BABY.

As a natural consequence there came a time of spoiling, a time of
doing whatever seemed good in their eyes, even after those eyes were
opening to the light and shadow of right and wrong. If they smiled,
or pouted, or even cried-though in that they were very moderate-
in a fashion which descended to them from their darling mother,
thereupon on their father's part great right and law, and even the
very oldest prejudice, fell prone as a tear before them. So they
toddled about most gloriously, with a strong sense of owning the
universe.
Next ensued a time of mighty retribution. Astræa, with her
feelings hurt, came down for a slashing moment. Fond as he was,
and far more weak than he ever had been before, Sir Cradock
Nowell was not a fool. He saw it was time to check the licence,
ere mischief grew irretrievable. Something flagrant occurred one
day ; both the children were in for it; they knew as well as possible
that they were jolly rogues together, and together in their childish
counsel they resolved to stand it out. There could be no doubt
that they had stolen into Mrs. Toaster's choicest cupboard, and
hardly left enough to smell at in a two-pound pot of greengage jam.
Nevertheless, there stood they both, scarlet in face and bright of
eye, back to back, with their broad white shoulders, their sturdy
legs set wide apart, and their little heels stamping defiantly. Mrs.
Toaster had not the heart to do any thing but kiss them, with a
number of “O fies !” and they accepted her kisses indignantly, and
wiped their lips with their pinafores. They knew that they were in
the wrong, but they had not tried to conceal it, and they meant to
brazen it out. They looked such a fine pair of lords of the earth,
and vindicated their felony with so grand an air, such high contempt
of all justice, that Cookey and Hogstaff, empannelled as jury, said,
“Drat the little darlings, let 'em have the other pot, mem !" But
as their good star would have it, Mrs. O’Gaghan came after them.
Upsetting the mere nisi prius verdict, she marched them off, one in
either hand, to the great judge sitting in banco, Sir Cradock him-
self, in the library. With the sense of heavy wrong upon them, the
little hearts began to fail, as they climbed with tugs instead of jumps,
and no arithmetic of the steps, the narrow flight of stone stairs that
led from regions culinary. But they would not shed a tear, not they,
nor even say they were sorry, otherwise Biddy (who herself was
crying) would have let them go with the tap of a battledore.
Poor little souls, they got their deserts with very scanty ceremony.
When Biddy began to relate their crime, one glance at their father's
face was enough; they hung behind, and dropped their eyes, and
flushed all under their curling hair. Yet little did they guess the
indignity impending. Hogstaff had followed all the way, and so
had Mrs. Toaster, to plead for them. Sir Cradock sent them both
away, and told Biddy to wait outside. Then he led his children to
an inner room, and calmly explained his intentions. These were of

CRADOCK NOWELL.
such a nature that the young offenders gazed at each other in dumb
amazement and horror, which very soon grew eloquent as the
sentence was being executed. But the brave little fellows cried
more, even then, at the indignity than the pain of it.
Then the stern father ordered them out of his sight for the day,
and forbade every one to speak to them until the following morning;
and away the twins went, hand in hand, down the cold cruel passage,
their poor smart curls all lumped together, and tossing at every
breathless jerk of their contrite sobs and heart-pangs. At the
corner, by the steward's room, they turned with one accord, and
looked back wistfully at their father. Sir Cradock had been saying
to himself, as he rubbed his hands after the exercise—“A capital
day's work : what a deal of good it will do them ; the self-willed
little rascals !” but the look cast back upon him was so like their
mother's when he had done any thing to vex her, that he locked all
the doors of the library, and forgot to despatch his letters.
But, of course, he held to his stern resolve to see them no more
that evening, otherwise the lesson would be utterly thrown away.
Holding to it as he did, the effect surpassed all calculation.
It was
the turning-point in their lives.
by boy, you know it hurts me a great deal more than you,”
says the hypocritical usher, who rather enjoys the cane-swing. The
boy knows it is hypocrisy, and is morally hurt more than physically.
But wholly different is the result when the patient knows and feels
the deep love of the agent, and cannot help believing that justice
has flogged the judge. And hitherto their flesh had been intemerate
and inviolable; the strictest orders had been issued that none
should dare to slap them, and all were only too prone to coax and
pet the beautiful angels. Little angels : treated so, they would soon
have been little devils. As for the warning given last week, they
thought it a bit of facetiousness : so now was the time, of all times,
to strike temperately, but heavily.
That night they went to bed before dark, without having cared
for tea or toast, and Biddy's soft heart ached by the pillow, as they
lay in each other's arms, hugged one another, having now none else
in the world to love, and sobbed their little troubles off into moan-
ing slumber.
On the following morning, without any concert or debate, and
scarcely asking why, the little things went hand in hand, united
inore than ever by the recent visitation, as far as the door of their
father's bedrooin. There they hid themselves under a curtain ; and
when he came out, the rings above fluttered with fear and love and
hope. Much as the father's heart was craving, he made believe to
walk onward, till Craddy ran out, neck or nothing, and sprang into
his arms.
After this great event, their lives flowed on very happily into
boyhood, youth, and manhood. They heartily loved and respected

their father; they could never be enough with John R-sedew; and
although they quarrelled and tussled sometimes, they languished
and drooped immediately when parted from one another. As for
Biddy O'Gaghan, now a high woman in the household, her only
difficulty was that she never could tell of her two boys which to
quote as the more astounding.
“ If you plase, ma'am," she always concluded," there'll not be so
much as the lean of a priest for any body iver to choose atwane the
bootiful two on them. "No more than there was on the day when
my blissed self-murder now !—any more, I manes, nor the differ a
peg can find 'twane a murphy and a purratie. And a Murphy I
must be, to tark, so free as I does, of the things as is above me.
Says Patrick O'Geoghegan to meself one day-glory be to his sowl,
and a gintleman every bit of him, lave out where he had the small-
pux-'Biddy,' he
says,
hould
your pratie-trap, or I'll shove these
here bellises down it. And for my good it would have been, as
I am thankful to acknowledge that same, though I didn't see it
that day, thank the Lord. Ah musha, musha, a true gintleman he
were, and lave me out his fellow, ma'am, if iver you comes acrass
him.”
But, in spite of Biddy's assertion, there were many points of dif-
ference, outward and inward too, between Cradock and Clayton
Nowell. By this time the “ Violet” was obsolete, except with Sir
Cradock, who rather liked it, and with young Crad, who had
corrupted it into the endearing “ Viley." John Rosedew had done
his utmost to antiquate the misnomer, being sensitive on the subject,
from his horror of false concord, as attributed to himself. Although
the twins were so much alike in stature, form, and feature that it
required care to discern them after the sun was down, no clear-
sighted person would mistake them when they both were present,
and the light was good. Clayton Nowell's eyes were brown,
Cradock's a dark grey; Cradock's hair was one shade darker, and
grew more away from his forehead, and the expression of his gaze
came from a longer distance. Clayton always seemed up for ban-
tering ; Cradock anxious to inquire, and to joke about it afterwards,
if occasion offered. Then Cradock's head inclined, as he walked, a i
little towards the left shoulder ; Clayton's hung, almost impercep-
tibly, somewhat to the right; and Cradock's hands were hard and
dry, Clayton's soft as good French kid.
And, as regards the inward man, they differed far more widely.
Every year their modes of thought, fancies, tastes, and habits, were
diverging more decidedly. Clayton sought command and power,
and to be admired; Cradock's chief ambition was to be loved by
every one.
And so with intellectual matters ; Clayton showed more
dash and brilliance, Cradock more true sympathy, and thence more
grasp and insight. Clayton loved the thoughts which strike us,
Cradock those which move us subtly. But as they lived not long

CRADOCK NOWELL.
together, it is waste of time to split straws between ther. What-
ever they were, they loved one another, and could not bear to be
parted.
Meanwhile, their “Uncle John” as they always called Mr. Rose-
dew—their uncle only in the spirit—was nursing and making much
of a little daughter of his own. Long before Lady Nowell's death,
indeed for ten long years before he obtained the living of Nowel-
hurst, with the little adjunct of Rushford, he had been engaged to a
lady-love much younger than himself, whose name was Amy Venn.
Not positively engaged by word, for he was too shy to pop the
question to any one but himself, for more than seven years of the
ten. But all that time Amy Venn was loving him, and he was
loving her, and each would have felt it a grevious blow, if the other
had started sideways. Miss Venn was poor, and had none except
her widowed mother to look to, and hence the parson was trebly
shy of pressing a poor man's suit. He, a very truthful mortal, had
pure faith in his Amy, and she had the like in him. So for several
years he shunned the common-room, and laid by all he could from
his fellowship, college-appointments, and professorship. But when
his old friend Sir Cradock, Nowell presented him to the benefice--
not a very gorgeous one, but enough for a quiet parson's family-he
took a clean white tie at once, vainly strove to knot it grandly,
actually got his scout to brush him, and after three glasses of
common-room port, strode away to his Amy at Kidlington. There
he found her training the apricot on the south wall of her mother's
cottage, one of the three great apricot-trees that paid the rent so
nicely. What a pity they were not peaches; they would have
yielded so fit a simile. But peach-bloom will not thrive at Kidling-
ton, except upon ladies' faces.
Three months afterwards, just when all was arranged, and Mrs.
Venn was at last persuaded that Hampshire was not all pigs and
rheumatism, forests, and swamps, and charcoal, when John, with
his voice rather shaky, and a patch of red where his whiskers should
have been, had proclaimed his own banns three times—for he was
a very odd fellow in some things, and scorned the "royal road” to
wedlock—just at that time, as it happened, poor Lady Nowell's con-
finement upset all calculation, and her melancholy death flung a pall
on wedding-favours. Not only through respect, but from real
sympathy with the faithful friend, John Rosedew and Amy held
counsel together, and deferred the long-pending bridal.
"*000
Marpórepov, tócQ uakáprepov," said John, who always thought in
Greek, except when Latin hindered him ; but few young ladies will
admit-and now-a-days they all understand it—that the apophthegm
is applied well.
However, it did come off at last; John Rosedew, when his banns
had been rolling in his mind, in the form of Greek senarii, for six
months after the first time of out-asking, set to and read them all

over again in public ; to revive their efficacy, and to surrebut all let
and hindrance.
Upon the wedding morn, Sir Cradock, whom they scarcely ex-
pected, gathered up his broken courage, sank his own hap in
another's, and came down, and tried to enjoy himself. How shy
John Rosedew was, how sly to conceal his blushes, how spry when
the bride glanced towards him, and nobody else looked that way,
all this very few could help observing ; but they loved him too
much to talk of it. Enough that the friend of his youth, thoroughly
understanding John, was blessed with so keen a perception of those
simple little devices, that at last he did enjoy himself, which he
deserved to do for trying.
When the twins were nearly three years old, Mrs. Rosedew pre-
sented John with the very thing he wished for most, an elegant
little girl. And here the word “ elegant" is used with forethought,
and by prolepsis ; though Mrs. O'Gaghan, lent for a time to the
Rectory, employed that epithet at the first glance, even while
announcing the gender.
“My musha, then, and she's illigant intirely; an' it's hopin' I be
as there'll only be two on her, one for each of me darlin'boys. And
now cudn't you manage it, doctor dear?”
But alas ! the supply was limited, and no duplicate ever issued.
Lucina saw John Rosedew's pride, and was afraid of changing his
character. He dwelt on the subject himself so much, that his
intellect grew dreamy, and he forgot all about next Sunday's sermon,
until he was in the pulpit. And four weeks after that he made
another great mistake, which did not please him, when he knew it,
but gratified the parish.
It had been settled with Mrs. Rosedew, that if she only felt strong
enough, she should come to church in the afternoon, to offer the due
thanksgiving.
In the grey old church at Nowelhurst, a certain pew had been set
apart, by custom immemorial, for the use of goodwives who felt
grateful for their safe deliverance. Here Mrs. Rosedew was to
present herself at the proper period, with the aid of Biddy's vigorous
arm down the hill from the Rectory. As yet she was too delicate to
bear the entire service. The August afternoon was sultry, and the
church doors stood wide open, while the bees, among the church-
yard blossoms, drowsed a sleepy sermon. As luck would have it, a
recruiting sergeant,“toling” for the sons of Ytene, finding the road so
dusty, and the alehouse barred against him, came sauntering into
the church duri the second lesson, for a little mild change of air.
Espying around him some likely rustics, he stationed himself in the
vacant churching pew," because the door was open, and the
position prominent. “All right,” thought the rector, who was very
short-sighted, “how good of my darling Amy to come! But I
wonder she wears her scarlet cloak to come to church with, in such

CRADOCK NOWELL.
weather! But perhaps Dr. Buller ordered it, for fear of her
catching cold.” So at the proper moment he drew his surplice
round him, looked full at the sergeant standing there by the pillar,
and began majestically, though with a trembling voice,
“Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His goodness
to give you safe deliverance, and hath preserved you in the great
danger of childbirth, you shall therefore give hearty thanks unto
God and say
The sergeant looked on very primly, with his padded arms
tightly folded, and his head thrown back, calling war and victory
into his gaze, for the credit of the British army. Then he wondered
angrily what the those chawbacons saw to be grinning at.
"I am well pleased,” &c., continued John Rosedew sonorously;
for he had a magnificent voice, and still regarding the sergeant with
a look of tender interest. Even Sir Cradock Nowell could scarcely
keep his countenance ; but the parson went through the whole of it
handsomely and to the purpose, thinking only, throughout it, of
God's great mercies to him. So beloved he was already, and so
much respected, that none of the congregation had the heart to tell
him of his mistake, as he talked with them in the churchyard ;
though he thought even then that he must have his bands, as lie
often had, at the back of his neck.
But on his way home he overtook an old hobbler, who enjoyed a
joke more than a scruple.
“How are you, Simon Tapscott? How do you do to-day?
Glad to see you at church, Simon,” said the parson, holding his
hand out, as he always did to his parishioners, unless they had dis-
graced themselves.
“Purty vair, measter; purty vair I be, vor a woald galley baggar
as ave bin in the Low Countries, and dwoant know sin from
righteousness." This last was a gross perversion of a passage in
the sermon which had ruffled ancient Simon. “Can't goo much,
howiver, by rason of the rhymatics. Now cud 'e do it to 1,
measter? cud 'e do it to I, and I'll thraw down bath my critches?
Good vor one sojer, good vor anoother.”
“Do what for you, Simon ? Fill your old canteen, or send you a
pound of baccy ?” asked the parson, mildly chaffing,
“Noo, noo; none o' that. There baint noo innará parts grace of
the Lord in that. Choorch I handsomely, zame as 'e dwoed that
strapping soger now jist.”
What, Simon! Why, Simon, do you know what you are say-
ing-
But nobody can wish to see John Rosedew humiliated; he was
humble enough by nature. And so fearful was the parson of
renewing light memories within the sacred walls, that no thanks
were offered there for the birth of sweet Amy Rosedew, save by, or
on behalf of, that recruiting sergeant.

CHAPTER V.
A DANCE INTERRUPTED.

WHEN Cradock and Clayton were ten years old, they witr.essed
a scene which puzzled them, and dwelt long in their boyish
memories. Job Hogstaff was going to Ringwood, and they followed
him down the passage towards the entrance-hall, over and over
again renewing all their orders to him. Old Job loved them as if
they were his own grandsons, and would do his utmost to please
them ; but they could not trust his memory, or even his capacity.
“Now, Job,” cried little Cradock, pulling at his coat-lappet, “it's
no good pretending that you know all, when you won't even stop to
listen. I'm sure you'll go and make some great mistake, as you did
last Tuesday. Mind you tell Mr. Stride it's for Master Cradock
Nowell, and they must be sure to give you a good one, or I shall
send it back. Now just tell me what I have told you. I ought to
have written it down, but I wasn't sure how to spell 'groove.'
Why, Master Crad, I'm to say a long spill, very sharp at the
end."
“Sharp at the point, Job, not blunt at the end like a new black-
lead pencil.”
And whatever you do, Job, don't forget the catgut for my cross.
bow, one size larger than last time.*
“Just you wait, Viley, till I've quite finished; or he'll ask for a
top made of catgut.”
Both the boys laughed at this; their laughter rang all down the
long passage. Any small folly makes a good boy laugh.
Well, Master Crad, you must think me a'muff,' as you call it
And the groove is to go quite up to the spill; there must be two
rings below the crown of it.”
“ Below the crown, indeed! On the fat part, I said three times
Now, Viley, you know you heard me.”
“Well, well,” cried Job in despair,“ two rings on the fat part,
and no knot at all in the wood, and at least six inches round, and,
and, well—I think that's all of it, thank the Lord.”
“All of it, indeed! Well, you are a nice fellow! Didn't I tell
you so, Viley? Why, you've left out altogether the most important
point of all, Job! The wood must be a clear bright yellow, or else
a very rich gold colour, and I'm to pay for it next Tuesday, because
I spent my week's money yesterday, as soon as ever I got it, and--
oh, Viley! can't you lend me sixpence?"
No, not to save my life, Crad. Why, Craddy, you know I
wouldn't let you go tick if I could.”
- Then the boys ran at one another, half in fun and half in love,
and, seizing each other by the belt' of the light-plaid tunic, away

they went dancing down the hall, while Hogstaff whistled a polka
gently, with his old eyes glistening after them. A prettier pair, or
better matched, never laid step together. Each put his healthy,
clear, bright face on the shoulder of the other, each flung out his
short-socked legs, and pointed his dainty feet. Then were the fat
young calves jerked up, as they sprang with double action, and the
hollow of the back curved in, as they threw asunder recklessly, then
clasped one another again, to save each other from reeling over.
Sir Cradock Nowell hated trousers, and would not have their hair
cropped, because it was like their mother's; else there never could
have been so pretty a picture moving.
Before the match was fairly finished-for they were used to this
sort of thing, and the object always was to see which would give in
first-all was cut short most suddenly. While they were taking a
sharp pirouette down at the end of the hall—and as they whirled
round even their father could scarce have known one from other-
the door of the steward's room opened loudly, and a tall dark
woman came out. The twins in full merriment dashed up against
her, and must have fallen if she had not collared them with strong
and bony arms. Like little gentlemen, as they were, they turned in
a moment to beg pardon, and their cheeks were burning red.
They saw a gaunt old woman, wide-shouldered, stern, and dark,
and forcible.
Oo, ah! a bonnie pair ye've gat, as I see in all my life lang.
But ye'll get no luck o' them. Tak’ the word o' threescore year,
ye'll never get no luck o' them, you that calls yourseľ Craydock
Nowell.”
She was speaking to Sir Cradock, who had followed her from the
steward's room, and who seemed as much put out as a proud man
of fifty ever cares to show himself. He made no answer, and the
two poor children fell back against a side-bench.
I'll no talk o' matters noo. You've a gi'en me my refoosal, and
I tak’ it once for all. But ye'll be sorry for the day ye did it,
Craydock Nowell.”
To the great amazement of Hogstaff, who was more taken aback
than any one else, Sir Cradock Nowell, without a word, walked to
the wide front door with ceremony, as if he were leading a peeress
out. He did not offer his arm to the woman, but neither did he
shrink from her; she gathered her dark face up again from its
softening glance at the children, and without another word or look,
but sweeping her skirt around her, away she walked down the broad
front road, as stiff and as stern as the oak-trees.

VERY CAREFUL GROUNDING.

CHAPTER VI.
VERY CAREFUL GROUNDING.
THE lapse of years made little difference with the noble parson,
John Rosedew, except to mellow and enfranchise the heart so free
and rich by nature, and to pile fresh stores of knowledge in the
mind so stored already. Of course even this man had his faults.
In many a little matter his friends could come down upon him
sharply, if their mind was so to do. But any one so minded would
not have been fit to be called the friend of Mr. Rosedew.
His greatest fault was one which sprang from his own high
chivalry. If once he detected a person, whether taught or un-
taught, in the attempt to deceive or truckle, that person was to him
thenceforth a thing to be pitied and prayed for. Large and liberal
as his heart was, charitable and even lenient to all other frailties,
the presence of a lie in the air was to it as ozone to a test-paper.
And then he was always sorry afterwards when he had shown his
high disdain. For who could disprove that John Rosedew himself
might have been a thorough liar, if trained and taught to consider
truth a policeman with his staff drawn?
Another fault John Rosedew had—and we do not tell his foibles
(as our friends do) to enjoy them-he gave to his books and their
bygone ages much of the time which he ought to have spent abroad
in his own little parish. But this could not be attributed to any form
of self-indulgence. Much as he liked his books, he liked his flock
still better, but never could overcome the idea that they would rather
not be bothered. If any one were ailing, if any one were needy, he
would throw aside his Theophrastus, and be where he was wanted,
with a mild sweet voice and gentle eyes that crannied not, like a
crane's bill, into the family crocks and dustbin. It was a part, and
no unpleasant one, of his natural diffidence, that he required a poor
man's invitation quite as much as a rich one's, ere ever he crossed
the threshold ; unless trouble overflowed the impluvium. In all the
parish of Nowelhurst there was scarcely a man or a woman who
did not rejoice to see the rector pacing his leisurely rounds, carrying
his elbows a little out, as men with large deltoid muscles do,
wearing his old hat far back on his head, so that it seemed to slope
away from him, and smiling gently upon the children who tugged
his coat-tails for an orange or a halfpenny. He never could come
out but what the urchins of the village were down upon him as
promptly as if he were apple-pie; and many of them had the
impudence to call him “Uncle John” before his hair was grey.
Instead of going to school, the boys were apprenticed to hiin in
the classics ; and still more pleasantly he taught them to swim,
and fish, and row. Of riding he knew but little, except from the

treatise of Xenophon, and a paper on the Pelethronian Lapiths; so
they learned it as all other boys do, by dint of crown and hard
bumpage. Moreover, Mark Stote, head gamekeeper, took them in
hand very early as his pupils in woodcraft and gunnery. To tell
the truth, Uncle John ohjected a little to this accomplishment; he
thought that the wholesome excitement and exercise of shooting
afforded scarcely a valid reason for the destruction of innocent life.
However, he recollected that he had not always thought so—his
conversion having been wrought by the shrieks of a wounded hare-
neither did he expect to bind all the world with his own girdle.
Sir Cradock insisted that the young idea should be taught to shoot,
and both the young ideas took to it very kindly.
Perhaps on the whole they were none the worse for the want of
public school training. What they lost thereby in quickness,
suspicion, and effrontery, was more than balanced by the gain in
purity, simplicity, love of home, and kindliness. For nature had
not gifted them with that vulgar arrogance, for which the best
prescription is “calcitration nine times a day, and clean the boots
for kicking you.” Every year their father took them for a month or
two to London, to garnish with some courtly frilling the knuckles
of his Hampshire hams. But they only hated it; thorough
agricoles they were, and well knew their own blessings: and sweet
and gladsome was the morning after each return, though it might
be blowing a gale of wind, or drizzling through the ash-leaves.
And then the headlong rush to see beloved Uncle John. Nature
they loved in any form, sylvan, agrarian, human, when that human
form was such as they could climb and nestle in. And there was
not in the parish, nor in all the forest, any child so rough and dirty,
so shock-headed, and such a scamp, that it could not climb into the
arms of John Rosedew's fellow-feeling.
But enough already of these calm days, the father's glory, the
hopes of the sons, the love of all who came near them, and the
blessings of Mrs. O'Gaghan.
They were now to go to Oxford, and astonish the natives there,
by showing that a little hic, hæc, hoc, may come even out of Galilee ;
that a youth never drawn through the wire-gauge of Eton, Harrow,
or Rugby, may carry still the electric spark, and be taper and well-
rounded. Half their learning accrued sub dio, in the manner of the
ancients. Uncle John would lead them between the trees and down
to some forest dingle, the boy on his right hand construing aloud or
parsing very slowly, the little spark at his left all glowing to explode
at the first mistake. DeEcógelpos made the running, until he tripped
and fell mentally, and even then he was set on his legs, unless the
other was down upon him ; but in the latter case the yoke-mate
leaped into the harness. The stroke-oar on the river that evening
was awarded to the one who paced the greatest number of stades in
the active voice of expounding. The accuracy, the cantion, born of

23
CG
this warm rivalry, became at last so vigilant, that the boy who won
the toss for the right-hand place at starting, was almost sure of the
stroke-oar.
So they passed the matriculation test with consummate ease, and
delighted the college tutor by their clear bold writing. They had
not read so much as some men have before entering the University,
but all their knowledge was close and firm, and staunch enough for
a spring-board. And they wrote most excellent Latin prose, and
Greek verse easily flowing. However, Sir Cradock was very ner-
vous on the eve of their departure for the first term of Oxford
residence, and led John Rosedew, in whose classical powers he
placed the highest confidence, into his private room, and there
begged him, as a real friend, tested now for forty years, to tell him
bluntly whether the boys were likely to do him credit.
Don't spare me, John, and don't spare them : only let us have
no disappointment about it.”
“My dear fellow, my dear fellow !” cried John, tugging at his
collar, as he always did when nonplussed, for fear of losing himself ;
“how on earth can I tell ? Most likely the men know a great deal
more in the University now than they did when I had lectures.
Haven't I begged you fifty times to have down a young first-class-
man ?"
“Yes, I know you have, John. But I am not quite such a fool,
nor so shamelessly ungrateful. To upset the pile of your ten years'
labour, and rebuild it upon its apex! And talk to me of young first-
classmen! Why, you know as well as I do, John, that there is not
one of them, however brilliant, with a tenth part of your knowledge.
It could never be, any more than a young tree can carry the fruit of
an old one. Why, when you took your own first-class, they could
only find one man to put with you, and you have never ceased to
read, read, read, ever since you left old Oriel, and chiefly in taste
and philology. And such a memory as you have ! John, I am
ashamed of you.
You want to impose upon me.”
And Sir Cradock fixed the parson's eyes with that keen and point-
blank gaze, which was especially odious to the shy John Rosedew.
“ I am sure I don't. You cannot mean that,” he replied, rather
warmly, for, like all imaginative men, when of a diffident cast, he was
desperately matter-of-fact the moment his honour was played with.
His friend began to smile at him, drawing up his grey moustache,
and saying, “ Yes, John, you are a donkey."
“I know that I am,” said John Rosedew, shutting his eyes, as he
loved to do when he got on a favourite topic ; “after those gigantic
philologists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—the Sca-
ligers, the Casaubons, the Vossii, the Heinsii,--my poor spicilegium
is scarcely the thistle-crop of the animal you have mentioned. But
as regards our English critics--at least too many of them-I submit
that we have been misled by the superiority of their Latin, and their

more slashing style. I doubt whether any of them had a tenth part
of the learning, or the sequacity of genius-
Come, John, I can't stand this, you know; and the boys will
be down here directly, they are so fond of brown sherry.”
Well, to return to the subject-I own that I was surprised and
hurt when a former Professor of Greek actually confounded the
Æolic form of the plusquam perfectum of so common a verb
“ Yes, John, I know all about that, and how it spoiled your break-
ſast. But about the boys, the boys, John ?”
" And again, as to the delicate sub-significance, not the well-
known tortuousness of tapá in composition, but-
“ Confound it, John.' They've got all their things packed.
They'll be here in a moment, pretending to rollick for our sakes;
and you won't tell me what you think of them.”
Well, I think there never were two finer fellows to jump a gate
since the days of Castor and Pollux. 'Hunc equis, illum superare
pugnis.'. You remember how you took me down for construing
'pugnis' wrongly, when we were at Sherborne?"
Yes, and how proud I was, John! You had been at the head of
the form for three months, and none of us could stir you ; but
you came back again next day in the fifth Æneid. But here come
the villains—now it's all over."
And so the boys went away, and their father could not for his life
ascertain what opinion his ancient friend had formed as to the
chances of their doing something good at Oxford. Simple and
straightforward as Mr. Rosedew was, no man ever lived from whom
it was harder to force an opinion. He saw matters from so many
aspects, every thing took so many facets, shifting lights, and playing
colours, from the versatility of his mind, that whoso could fix him
at such times, and extort his real sentiments, might spin a diamond
ring, and shave by it. He had golden hopes about his “nephews,"
as he often called them, but he would not pronounce those hopes at
present, lest the father should be disappointed. And so the boys
went up to Oxford, half a moon before the woodcocks came.
CHAPTER VII.
LEADS TO GREAT SUCCESS.
The twins were entered at Merton, and had the luck to obtain
adjoining garrets. Sir Cradock had begun to show a decided pre-
ference for Clayton, as he grew year by year more and more like his

mother. Also that mother's last entreaty that he would not allow
the younger to feel the difference of his position may have urged him
unawares into the opposite extreme. But this was not the only reason
why he would not listen to a friend's suggestion, that Cradock, the
heir to the property, should be ranked as a “gentleman-commoner.”
That stupid distinction he left for men who require self-assertion,
admiring as he did the sense and spirit of that Master, well known
in his day, who, to some golden cad insisting that his son should be
entered in that college as a gentleman-commoner, angrily replied,
Sir, all my commoners are gentlemen.”
But the brothers were very soon parted. Clayton got sleeved in
a scholar's gown, while Cradock still fluttered the leading-strings.
“ Et tunicæ manicas-you effeminate Viley !” said Cradock,
admiring hugely, when his twin ran up to show himself off, after
winning a Corpus scholarship ; "and the governor won't allow me
a chance of a parasol for my elbows.”
Sir Cradock, a most determined man, and a very odd one to deal
with, had forbidden his elder son to stand for any scholarship, ex-
cept those few which are of the University corporate. “A youth of
your expectations,” he exclaimed, with a certain bitterness, for he
often repined in secret that Clayton was not the heir, “a boy placed
as you are, must not compete for a poor young lad's viaticum. You
may go in for a University scholarship, though of course you will
never get one; an examination does good, I have heard, to the
unsuccessful candidates. But if Clayton stands against you, it might
be wiser to withdraw."
Craddy was deeply hurt by this; he had long perceived his
father's partiality for the son more dashing, yet more effeminate,
more pretentious, and less persistent. So Cradock set his heart
upon winning Craven, Hertford, or Ireland, and never even alluding
to it in the presence of his father. Hence it will be evident that the
youth was proud and sensitive.
Amy amata, peramata a me,” cried the parson to his daughter,
now a lovely girl of sixteen, straight, slender, and well-poised;
“how glad and proud we ought to be of Clayton's great success !”
“Pa, dear, he would never have got it, I am quite certain of that,
if Cradock had been allowed to go in; and I think it most unfair,
shamefully unjust, that because he is the eldest son he is never to
have any honour. And Amy coloured brilliantly at the warmth of
her own championship ; but her father could not see it.
So I am inclined to think”—John Rosedew was never positive,
except upon great occasions—"perhaps I should say perpend, if I
were fond of hybrid English. I don't mean about the unfairness,
Amy; for I think I should do the same if I were in Sir Cradock's
place. I mean that our Crad would have got it, instead of Clayton,
with health and fortune favouring. But it stands upon a razor's
edge. You know the Greek proverb, Amy ?”

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“Yes, pa, when you tell me the English. How the green is
coming out on the fir-trees ! So faint and yet so bright. Oh, papa,
what Greek triple composite is equal to that composition ?”.
Well, my poppet, I am so short-sighted, I would much rather
have a
“ Triple composite than three good kisses from me, daddy ?
Well, there they are, at any rate, because I know you are disap-
pointed.” And the child, herself more bitterly disappointed, as
becomes a hot partisan, ran away to sit under a sprawling larch,
just getting new nails on its fingers, for the spring was awaking
early.
It was not more than a week after this, and not very far from
All-Fools'-day, when Clayton, directly after chapel, rushed into
Cradock's garret, hot, breathless, and unphilosophical. Cradock,
calm and thoughtful, as he usually was, poked his head through the
open slide of the dusthole called a scout's room, and brought out
three willow-pattern plates, a little too retentive of the human
impress, and an extra knife and fork, dark-browed at the tip of
the handle. Then he turned up a corner of tablecloth, where it
cherished sombre memories of a tearful teapot, and set the mustard-
pot to control it. Nor long before he doubled the coffee in the
strainer of the biggin, and shouted “Corker !” thrice, far as human
voice would gravitate, down the well of the staircase. Meanwhile
Master Clayton stood fidgeting, and doffed not his scholarly toga.
Corker, the scout, a short fat man, came up the stairs with dignity
and indignation contending. He was anazed that any freshman
“should have the cheek to holler so." Mr. Nowell was such a
quiet young man, that the scout looked for some apology. “Corker,
a commons of bread and butter, and a cold fowl and some tongue.
Be quick now,
before the buttery closes. And, as I see I am
putting you out in your morning work, get a quart of ale at your
dinner-time." “Yes, sir, to be sure, sir ; I wish all the gentlemen
was as thoughtful.”
“No, Craddy, never mind that," cried his brother, reddening
richly, for Clayton was fair as a lady,“ I only want to speak to you
about—well, perhaps, you know what it is I have come for. Is that
fellow gone from the door ?"
“I am sure I don't know. Go and look yourself. But, dear
Viley, what is the matter?”
Oh, Cradock, you can so oblige me, and it can't matter much to
you. But to me, with nothing to look to, it does make such a
difference.”
Cradock never could bear to hear this—that his own twin-brother
should talk, as he often did, so much in the pauper strain. And all
the while Clayton was sure of 50,000l. under their mother's settlement.
But Crad was full of wild generosity, and had made up his mind
to share Nowelhurst, if he could do so, with his brother. He began

to pull Clayton's gown off; he would have blacked his shoes if
requested. He always thought himself Viley's prime minister.
Whatever it is, my boy, Viley, you know I will do it for you, if
it is only fair and honourable.”
“Oh, it is no great thing. I was sure you would do it for me.
To do just a little bit under your best in this hot scrimmage for the
Ireland. I am not much afraid of any man, Crad, except you, and
Brown, of Balliol."
* Viley, I am very sorry that you have asked me such a thing.
Even if it were in other ways straightforward, I could not do it, for
the sake of the father, and Uncle John, and little Amy."
Don't
you know that the governor doesn't want you to get
it? You are talking nonsense, Cradock, downright nonsense, to
cover your own selfishness. And that frizzle-headed Amy, in-
deed!”
“I would rather talk nonsense than fraud, Clayton. And I can't
help telling you that what you say about my father may be true,
but is not brotherly; and your proposal does you very little
honour; and I never could have thought it cf you; and I will do
my very utmost. And as for Amy, indeed, she is too good for
you to speak of-and-and He was highly wroth at the
sneer about Amy's hair, which he admired beyond all reason, as
indeed he did every bit of her, but without letting any one know it.
He leant upon the table, with his thumb well into the mustard-pot.
This was the first real quarrel with the brother he loved so much ;
and it felt like a skewer poked into his heart.
“Well, elder brother by about two seconds," cried Clayton,
twitching his plaits up well upon his coat-collar, “I'll do all I can
to beat you. And I hope Brown will have it, not you. There's the
cash for my commons. I know you can't afford it, until you get a
scholarship.”
Clayton flung half-a-crown upon the table, and went down
the stairs with a heavy tramp, knocking over a dish with the
college arms on, wherein Corker was bringing the fowl and the
tongue. Corker got all the benefit of the hospitable doings, and
made a tidy dinner out of it, for Cradock could eat no breakfast
It was the first time bitter words had passed between the brothers
since the little ferments of childhood, which are nothing more than
sweetwort the moment they settle down. And he doubted himself;
he doubted whether he had not been selfish about it.
It was the third day of the examination, and when he appeared
at ten o'clock among the forty competitors, he was vexed anew to
see that Clayton had removed to a table at the other end of the
room, so as not to be even near him. The piece of Greek prose
which he wrote that morning dissatisfied him entirely; and then
again he rejoiced at the thought that Viley need not be afraid of
him. He had never believed in his chance of success, and went

from any
in for the scholarship to please others and learn the nature of the
examination. Next year he might have a fairer prospect; this
year—as all the University knew-Brown, of Balliol, was sure
of it.
Nevertheless, by the afternoon he was in good spirits again, and
found a mixed paper which suited him as if Uncle John had set it.
One of the examiners had been, some twenty years ago, a pupii
of John Rosedew, and this, of course, was a great advantage to any
successor alumnus; though neither of them knew the other. It is
pleasant to see how the old ideas germinate and assimilate, as the
olive and the baobab do, after the fires of many summers.
Clayton, a placable youth (even when he was quite in the wrong,
as in the present instance), came to Craddy's rooms that even-
ing, begged him not to apologize for his expressions of the
morning, and compared notes with him upon the doings of the
day.
"Bless you, Crad,” he cried, after a glass of first-rate brown
sherry-not the vile molassied stuff, thick as the sack of Falstaff,
but the genuine thing, with the light and shade of brown olives in
the sunset, and not to be procured, of course,
Oxonian
wine-dealer ;-"oh, Crad, if we could only wallop that Brown,
of Balliol, between us, I should not care much which it was.
He has booked it for such a certainty, and does look so cocky
about it. Did you see the style he walked off, before hall, arm in
arm with his cousin the Don, and spouting his own iambics ?”
“First-rate ones, I dare say, Viley. Have a pipe, old fellow.
After all, it doesn't matter much. Folk who have never been in
them think a deal the most of these things. The wine-merchant
laughs at beeswing; and so, I suppose, it is with all trades.”
Cradock was not by any means prone to the discourse sententious ;
and the present lapse was due, no doubt, to the reaction ensuing
upon his later scene with Viley, wherein each had promised heartily
to hold fast by the brotherhood.
On the following Saturday morning, John Rosedew's face flushed
puce-colour as he opened his letters at breakfast-time. “Hurrah !
Amy, darling; hurrah, my child ! Terque quaterque, et novies
evoe! Eat all the breakfast, melimel ; I won't tell you till I come
back."
“Oh, won't you, indeed ?" cried Amy, with her back against the
door and her arms in mock grimness folded. “I rather think you
will, papa; unless you have made up your mind to choke me. And
you are half-way towards it already."
John saw that peculiar swell of her throat which had frightened
him so often-her dear mother had died of bronchitis, and he
knew nothing of medical subjects—and so he allayed her ex-
citement at once, gave her over to Aunt Eudoxia, who was late in
her bedroom as usual, and then set off at his utmost speed to tell

his old friend, Sir Cradock. And a fine turn of speed he still
could show, though the whiskers under his college-cap (stuck on
anyhow in the hurry) were as white as the breast of a martin
quivering under the eaves. Since he lost his wife he had never
cared to walk fast, subsiding into three miles an hour, as thoughtful
and placid men will do, when they begin to thumb their waistcoats.
But now through the waking life of the Chase,” where the brown
fern-stalks bent over the Ammon horn of the lifting frond, and the
fescue grass was beading rough with dew already, here and among
the rabbit-holes, nimbly dodging the undermine, ran as hard as a
boy of twelve, the man of threescore, John Rosedew. Without
stopping to knock as usual, he burst in upon Sir Cradock, now
sitting all alone at his simple, old-fashioned breakfast. Classical
and theological training are not locomotive, as all good parsons
are well aware ; and the rector stood gasping ever so long, with
both hands pressed to his side.
“Why, John? quick, quick! You frighten me. Is your house
on fire ?"
Old fellow-old fellow; such news! Shake hands-ever since
the chartı foreste; shake hands again. Oh, I came rather fast.
May I have a cup of tea ?”
“What is it, John? Do be quick. I must send for Mrs. O'Gaghan
and her tansy tea.” Biddy was now the licensed doctoress of the
household, and did little harm with her simples, if she failed of doing
good.
“ Times there? Open it; look, University news! Crad and
Clayton."
Wondering, smiling, placidly anxious, Sir Cradock tore open the
paper, and found, after turning a great many corners, the Univer-
sity news. Then he read out with a trembling voice, after glancing
over it silently :
“The Ireland scholarship has been awarded to Cradock Nowell,
of Merton College. Proxime accessit Clayton Nowell, scholar of
Corpus Christi. Unless we are misinformed, these gentlemen are
twin-brothers.”
Grintie, grintie, grunt,
Oos be arl tew blunt;
Naw oose Hampshire hogs,
But to zhow the way in bogs.”
)
So John Rosedew quoted in the fulness of his glory from an old
New Forest rhyme. John's delight transcended every thing, because
he had never expected it. He had taken his own degree ere ever
the Ireland was heard of; but three pupils of his had won it while
he was still in residence. Of that he had not thought much. But
now to win it by proxy in his extreme old age, as he began to

consider it, and from all the crack public schoolmen, and with his
own pet alumni, whom no one else had taught any thing—such an
Ossa upon Pelion, such an Olympus on Ossa-no wonder that the
snow of his whiskers shook and the dew trembled under his eyelids.
Sir Cradock, on the other hand, had never a word to say,
but turned his head like one who waits for a storm of dust to
go by.
66
Why, Cradock, old friend, what on earth is the matter? You
don't seem at all delighted.”
" Yes, I am, of course, John; as delighted as I ought to be. But
I wish it had been Viley ; he wants it so much more, and he is
so like his mother."
So is Crad; every bit as much ; an enlarged and grander por-
trait. Can't you see the difference between a large heart and a
mere good one ? Will no one ever appreciate my noble and simple
Craddy?”
John Rosedew spoke warmly, and was sorry before the breath
from his lips was cold. Not that he had no right to say it, but
because he felt that his rashness had done harm to Cradock.
CHAPTER VIII.
SELF-REFLECTION.
HONOURS flash in the summer sun, as green corn does in the
morning; then they gleam mature and mellow at the time of reap-
ing; they are bagged, perhaps by a woman's arm, with a cut “below
the knees ;" set on their butt for a man to sit under while eating his
bread and cheese ; then they wither, and are tossed into chaff by a
contumelious steam-engine with a leathern strap inflexible.
Cradock's “Ireland” has gone by, and another has succeeded it,
and this has fallen, as most things fall, to the sap of perseverance,
steel-tipped with hard self-confidence—this Ireland has fallen to the
lot of Brown Balliolensis. Clayton would not go in for it ; his
pride, or rather vanity, would not allow him to do so. Was he
going to take Cradock's leavings, and be a year behind him, when
he was only a few minutes younger ? However, he went in for the
Hertford, and, what was a great deal more, he got it ; Cradock
would not stand; and, even if he had, perhaps the result would have
been the same. Viley had made up his mind to win it, and worked
very hard indeed ; and so won it very easily. Cradock could usually
beat him in Greek, but not so often in Latin And Clayton wrote

the prettiest, most tripping, coquettish, neat-ankled hendecasyllables
that ever whisked roguishly round a corner, wondering where Ca-
tullus was.
Ah! light-hearted poet, sensitively sensuous, yet withal deep-
hearted, with a vein of golden philosophy, and a pensive tenderness,
now-a-days we overlook thee. Horace is more fashionable, more
suited to a flippant age, because he has no passion.
Early on a sunripe evening in the month of June, “when the sun
was shifting the shadows of the hills, and doffed the jaded oxen's
yoke, distributing the lovetime from his waning chariot,” a forest
dell, soft, clear, and calm, was listening to its thrushes. And more
than at the throstle's flute, or flageolet of the blackbird, oaks and
chestnuts pricked their ears at the voice of a gliding maiden.
Where the young fern was pluming itself, arching, lifting, ruffling
in filigree, light perspective, and depth of Gothic tracery, freaked
by the nip of fairy fingers, tremulous as a coral grove in a crystal
under-current, the shyer fronds still nestling home, uncertain of the
world as yet, and coiled like catherine-wheels of green ; where the
cranesbill pushed like Zedekiah, and the succory reared its sky-blue
windmill (open for business till 8 P.M.); where the violet now was
rolled up in the seed-pod, like a stylite millipede, and the great
bindweed, in its crenate horn, piped and fluted spirally, had for-
gotten its noonday flaunt: here, and over the nibbled sward, where
the crisp dew was not risen yet, here came wandering the lightest
foot that ever passed, but shook not, the moss-bed of the glow-
Under the rigorous oaks (so corded, seamed, and wenned
with humps of grey), the stately, sleek, mouse-coloured beech, the
dappled, moss-beridden ash, and the birch-tree peeling silverly,
beneath the murmuring congress of the sunproof leaves; and again
in the open breaks and alleys, where light and shade went see-saw;
by and through and under all, feeling for and with every one,
glanced, and gleamed, and glistened, and listened the loveliest being
where all was love, the pet in the nest of nature.
Of all the beauty in that sweet dell, where the foot of man came
scarcely once in a year; of all the largesse of earth and heaven;
of all the grace which is Nature's gratitude to her heavenly Father :
there was not one, from the lily-bell to the wild rose and the heather-
sprig, fit for a man to put in his bosom, and look at Amy Rosedew.
It is told of a certain good man's child, whose lineage still is
cherished, that when she was asked by her father (half bantering,
half in earnest) to tell him the reason why every body loved her so,
she cast down her eyes with a puzzled air, then opened them wide,
as a child does to the sunrise of some great truth—“Father,
perhaps it is because I love every body so." Lucan has it in a
neater form : “amorem quæris amando." And that was Amy
Rosedew's secret, by herself undreamed of-lovely, because she
could not help loving all our God has made. And of all the fair
worni,

things He has made, and pronounced to be very good, since sun-
shine first began to gleam, to glow, and to fade away, what home
has beauty found so bright, so rich in varied elegance, so playfully
receptive of the light shed through creation—the light of the
Maker's smile—as a young maiden, pure of heart, natural, true, and
trusting?
She came to the brink of a forest pool, and looked at herself in
the water. Not that she thought more than she could help of the
outward thing called “ Amy,” but that she wondered how her old.
favourites, Cradock and Clayton Nowell, would esteem her face
and style of dress now she was turned seventeen. Most likely they
had seen ever so many girls, both at Oxford and in London, com-
pared with whom poor Amy was but a rustic Phidyle, just fit to
pick sticks in the New Forest.
The crystal mirror gave her back even the shade on her own
sweet face, which fell from the cloud of that simple thought; for
she stood where the westering sunshine failed to touch the water,
but flushed with rich relief of gold the purity of her figure. Every
sapling, dappled hazel, sloughing birch, or glabrous maple, glistened
with the plumes of light, and every leaf was twinkling. The
columns of the larger trees stood like metal cylinders, whereon the
level gleam rules a streak, and glints away round the rounding.
Elbows, arms, and old embracings, backed with a body-ground of
green, laced with sunset's golden bodkin, ever shifting every eyelet,
-branch, and bough, and trunk, and leaves, ruffling and twisting,
or staunch and grand, they seemed but a colonnade and arch, for
the sun to peep through at the maiden, and tell of her on the calm
waters.
Floating, fleeting, wavering there, in a frame of stately summer
flags, vivid upon the crystal shade, and twinkling every now and
then to the plash of a distant moorhen, or the dip of a swallow's
wing, lay her graceful image, wondering in soft reply to her play of
wonder. She took off her light chip hat, and laughed ; lo ! the
courteous picture did the same. She offered, with a mincing air,
her little frail of wood-strawberries; and the shadowy Amy put
them back with the prettiest grace ever dreamed of. Then she
cast the sparkling night of her tresses down the white shoulders
and over her breast; and the other Amy was looking at her
through a ripple of cloudiness, with the lissom waist retiring. She
smoothed her hair like a scarf around her, withdrew her chin on
the curving neck, and bowed the shapely forehead, well pleased to
see thus the foreshortening undone, and the pure, bright oval
shown as in a glass. Then, frightened almost at the lustrous
depth of her large grey eyes, deep-fringed with black, she thought
of things all beyond herself, and woke, from Nature's innocent joy
in her own brief luck of beauty, to the bashful consciousness, the
dawn of a maiden's dreamings. "Bridling next at her mirrored face,

with a sudden sense of humour, all the time she watched the red
lips, and the glimmer of pearls between them, “ Amy,” she cried,
“now, after this, don't come to me for a character, unless you want
one, you pretty dear, for conceit and self-admiration.”
So saying, she tossed her light head at herself, and lookeround
through her flickering cloudlets. What did she see? What made
the dark water flame upon the instant with a richer glow than
sunset? The delicate cheeks, the fair forehead and neck, even the
pearly slope of the shoulders, were flooded with deepest carmine.
Her pride fell flat, as the cistus stamen at a touch droops away
on the petal. Then she shrank into a flowering broom, and
cowered among the spikelets, and dared not move to wipe away the
tears she was so mad with. Oh! the wretched abasement earned
by a sweet little bit of vanity!
How she hated herself, and the light, and the water, and every
thing, her senseless habit of thinking aloud, above all, her despicable
fancy that she was growing-what nonsense !—such a pretty girl !
Thenceforth and for ever, she felt quite sure, she never could look
in a glass again, unless it were just for a moment, to put her hair
to rights, if ever she got home.
“ To think of my hair all down my neck, and the way I had
turned in the gathers !”--the poor little thing had been making
experiments how she would look in a low-necked dress“Oh! that
was the worst thing of all. I might have laughed at it but for
that. And now I am sure I can never even peep at his face
again. Whatever will he think of me, and what would my papa
say
After crying until she began to laugh, she resolved to go straight
home, and confess all her crime to Aunt Eudoxia, John Rosedew's
maiden sister, who had come to live with him when he lost his wife,
three dreary years agone. So Amy rolled up her long hair anyhow,
without a bit of pride in it, shrank away and examined herself, to
be sure that all was right, and, after one peep, came bravely forth,
trying to look as much as possible like her good Aunt Doxy; then
she walked at her stateliest, with the basket of strawberries, picked
for papa, in one hand, and the other tightly clasped upon the
bounding of her heart. But her eyes were glancing right or left,
like a fawn's when a lion has roared ; and even the youngest trees
saw quite well that, however rigid with Miss Eudoxia the gliding
form might be, it was poised for a dart and a hide behind them at
every crossing shadow.
But fortune favours the brave. She won her own little sallyport
without the rustle of a blackberry-leaf, and thereupon rushed to a
hasty and ostrich-like conclusion. She felt quite sure that, after
all, none but the waters and winds could tell the tale of her little
coquetry. Beyond all doubt, Cradock Nowell was deep in the
richest mental metallurgy, tracing the vein of Greek iambics, as he

did before his beard grew; and she never, never would call them
“stupid iambics” again.
Cradock, who had espied her, but turned away immediately (as
became a gentleman), did not, for the moment, know his little Amy
Rosedew. A year and a half had changed her from a stripling,
jumping girl to a shy and graceful maiden, dreadfully afraid of
swcethearts. She had not been away from Nowelhurst throughout
that year and a half, for her father could not get on without her for
more than a month at a time, and all that month he fretted. But
the twins had spent the last summer in Germany, with a merry
reading (or talking) party; and their Christmas and Easter va-
cations were dragged away in London, through a strange whim of
Sir Cradock Nowell ; at least, they thought it strange, but there
was some reason for it.
Young Cradock Nowell was not such a muff as to be lost in
Greek senarii; no trimeter acatalectics of truest balance and purest
fall could be half so fair to scan; not“ Harmony of the golden
hair," and her nine Pierid daughters round the crystal spring, were
worth a glance of the mental eye, wh fortune granted bodily
vision of our unconscious Amy. But he did not stand there
watching mutely, as some youths would have done ; for a moment,
indeed, he forgot himself in the flush of admiration. The next
moment he remembered that he was a gentleman; and he did
what a gentleman must have done-whether marquis or labourer :
he slipped away through the bushes, feeling as if he had done some
injury. Then the maiden, glancing round, caught one startled
glimpse, as Nyssia did of the stealthy Gyges, or Diana of Actæon.
From that one glimpse she knew him, though he was so like
his brother, but he had failed to recognize the Amy of his
boyhood.
CHAPTER IX.
UPON A SUNDAY MORNING.
Miss EUDOXIA ROSEDEW pas now the queen of the rectory; and
the sceptre she bore was an iron one to all except her niece. John-
that easy, good-natured parson, who coming in from the garden or
parish, any summer forenoon, would halt in the long low kitchen, if a
nice crabbed question presented itself, take his seat outright upon
the corner of the ancient dresser, and then and there discourse
upon some moot point in the classics, or tie and untie over again
some fluffy kr.ot historical, talking mainly to himself, of course, and

answering himself and balancing all that ever had been said on
either side of the question; while his sister, with her store-room
apron on, could not help admiring him, yet could not forget
propriety, and Amy all the time poked in little pike-points of
impudence, and the cook and housemaid theoretically kept them-
selves well out of the way, but practically were always present,—the
worthy rector had now so long been threatened by his sister and
child with dishclouts, pepper, and rolling-pins, that the cook began
to forget the name of Plato (which had struck her), and the house-
maid could not justly tell what Tibullus says of Pales.
“John, you really do not show enough of moral dignity! And the
inutton not put down yet, and the kidney-beans getting ropy! If
you must sit there, you might as well begin to slice the cucumber.
I dare say you'd do that with pleasure.”
To be sure, Doxy; so I will. I sharpened my knife this
morning."
“ Doxy, John! And with that glass-window ! I am sure Jo-
hanna must have heard you, though she makes such a strong
commotion in there with the rolling-pin, like a doctor's pestle and
mortar. She always does when I come out, to impress me with her
activity; and I dare say she sat down for half an hour, to listen to
her master. Really, my dear brother, you ought to make more
allowance for cooking.”
“Eudoxia, that is in strong departure from the great Philo's
opinion. He says-
Now, John, I know all he could say, and cannot stop to hear
it. Only will you, or will you not allow me to order the dinner ?"
“I have great ideas upon that subject, not only from the
Deipnosophists, but from a rare tractate which I lately happened
“John, you really are too bad. Is a dinner a matter of thcory?
I know it is to you, my dear, when you are over busy. But I do
feel that it ought not to be so regarded.”
“ All antiquity is in your favour," answered Mr. Rosedew, who
always had the due soft word ; "and lately there seems to be reason
to hope that the same mode of thought is returning.”
This, ainong other little strokes and gentle passages of arms, shows
how these two softened off the difference nature insists on making
between male and female. John always yielded at once whenever
Eudoxia tried to argue; and the lady had the pleasure of feeling-
until she began to think a little—how much she had the best of it.
Every gentleman is bound to behave so towards the ladies. And
his reward is ready for him. They exalt their vanquished.
To forsake these common reflections, and to come to church at
last. A good and pleasant sight it was for any man to stand
outside the dry wall of the churchyard, and at his leisure watch
Mr. Rosedew going to church with his sister.

CRADOCK NOWELL
At no other time except a quarter to eleven o'clock on the
forenoon of Sunday did this gentleman spare two thoughts as to
what the world might think of him. Neither would he have done
so then, except that long stimulation had at length worked him up
to the proper pitch; because Miss Rosedew, anticipating a great
intellectual movement, really did perceive that we ought to insist
a great deal more upon the dignity of the priesthood. Wherefore
she made a new cassock for John out of the undertakers' scarves,
and gave him no rest until he donned it, laughing at him.self and
her.
“How can it matter?” John Rosedew asked ; “the women attend
to our clothes of course. I remember a passage in Naumachius,
worthy of more attention than-
“ Than the traditions of the Church, and the true significance of
vestments, John!”
“Nay, did I say that, Eudoxia? I only meant to say—than
many patterns I have had by post. However, Doxy, if you find
it right to brush me down so much, I can stand a good deal
longer ; and Jem has not begun on the cracked bell yet.”
In this manner they issued forth, Sunday after Sunday, poor
John Rosedew always lacking the moral support of Amy, and his
sister always making the most of her fair field to be at him.
Dear Amy was at the Sunday school from half-past nine till
church-time, doing a good bit of work, in her way, and smoothing
the quarrels of teachers. For strange though it is, it is equally true
that the duty and practice of teaching the young idea how to
shoot drive many good and benevolent people to long to shoot one
another.
But now here comes Amy to meet her papa, and take the girls in
at the chancel door, while the boys enter under the tower. Her
favourite scholars, the first-class girls, march in the van; and some
have gloves, and some even pocket-handkerchiefs. But these have
orders to share their talent, upon strong emergency, with their little
sisters.
Behind sweet Amy come little girls, even too young for flirting
(or at least supposed to be so), who straggle along with a very loose
sense of any responsibility. Three, or four, or five in a line, or out
of line altogether, they lag, and they swing, and they jerk their legs,
without any sense of the house of God. This is put into them
every Sunday, but goes out before they go in.
Amy draws up before her father, just to show him what she can
do. All her scholars who have any gloves salute therewith empha-
tically; all the others, who are too poor, kiss their hands, and
Mr. Rosedew loves them all the more for it.
How smooth, and calm, and rich looks Amy; as if she had
governed a school for at least a downright generation. To catch
the sweetness of her smile and the radiance of her lovely face is as

good as to go to church almost; while the cut of her clothes is
enough to show that she feels how much it would be amiss to
encourage these girls into any light ways, by the smallest insinua.
tion of her own sweet sinuosities.
All these girls, being ranged in order, pull down their chins,
as if they had never seen such a thing as a boy before, and never
desired to see him again.
The boys however are pretty nearly fit to be a match for them.
In their stomachs they do feel how much they have had the best of
it, after ignominious failure—when it came to treacle-tucks—to
assert themselves against true feminine self-sacrifice. And at this
moment, rolling their tongues, in a manner basely practical, in at
the tower porch they go, and the girls look away, most decidedly.
CHAPTER X.
LOVE IN THE FOREST.
The scenery of the New Forest is of infinite variety ; but the
wooded parts may be ranged, perhaps, in a free, loose-branching
order (as befits the subject), into some three divisions, which cross
and interlace each other, as the trees themselves do.
First, and most lovely, the glades and reaches of gentle park and
meadow, where the beech-tree invades not seriously, or, at any rate,
not with discipline, but straggles about like a tall centurion amused
by ancient Britons. Here are the openings winged with fern, and
ruffling to the west wind; and the crimped oval leaves of the alder
rustle over the backs of the bathing cows. In and out we glance,
or gaze, through the groined arcade of trees, where the sun goes
wandering softly, as if with his hand before his eyes. Of such kind
is the Queen's Bower Wood, beside the Boldre Water.
Of the second type, most grand and solemn, is the tall beech-
forest, darkening the brow of some lonely hill, and draping the
bosomed valleys. Such is Mark Ash Wood, four miles to the west
of Lyndhurst.' Overhead, is the vast cool canopy; underfoot, the
soft brown carpet, woven by a thousand autumns. No puny under-
wood foils the gaze, no coppice-whispers circulate ; on high there
moves one long, unbroken, and mysterious murmur, and all below
grey twilight broods in a lake of silent shadow. Through this the
ancient columns rising, smooth, dove-coloured, or glimpsed with
moss, others fluted, crannied, bulging, hulked at the reevings of
some great limb; others twisted spirally and tortuously rooting; a
thousand giants receding, clustering, opening elbow-peeps between
them, standing forth to stop the view, or glancing some busy slant

of light-in the massive depth of gloom they seem, at times, to be
gliding.
The third and most rudely sylvan form is that of the enclosures,
where the intolerant beech is absent, and the oak, the spruce, and
the Spanish chestnut protect the hazel, the fern and bramble, the
dog-rose and the honeysuckle.
In a bowering, gleaming, twinkling valley, such as I have first
described, we saw Miss Amy Rosedew admiring her own perfec-
tions; and now, some three months afterwards, a certain young
lady, not wholly unlike her, is roaming in a deep enclosure, thick
with oaks and underwood. It lies about a furlong from the
western lodge of Nowelhurst, and stretches away towards the sun-
set, far from the eye of house or hut. Even the lonely peatman,
who camps (or camped, while so allowed) beneath the open sky,
wherever the waste yields labour freely, and no prescription bars
him-even he finds nothing here to draw his sauntering footstep.
The gorse prefers more open places, the nuts are few and hard to
reach, the fuel-turf is not worth cutting, and the fuel-wood he dare
not hew. So there is nothing there to tempt him. As for shade,
and solitude, and the crystal rill, he gets a little too much of that
sort of thing already.
By the side of that crystal rill, and where the trees hung thickest,
in the early gloom of St. Michael's evening, walked the aforesaid
maiden, nor was it difficult to espy a handsome youth beside her.
The light through the lapping boughs and leaves-whose summer
whisper now was growing hoarse in autumn's rustle—the clouded
light fell charily, but showed the figures comely, as either could wish
of the other.
The maiden's face was turned away ; but one hand lay in her
lover's; with the other she was drawing close the loose folds of her
mantle; the play of colour on her cheeks outflushed the tints of
autumn ; and not a doomed leaf of the forest fluttered more than
her young heart.
Meanwhile, he was gazing down, as if loth to break the spell of
passion woven by the time, the scene, the interchange of look and
touch, and most of all, by his own brave words, and fervid eloquence
of love. Although his whole life was waiting for a whisper, a
murmur, or even a glance, the power of the moment held him calm,
and firm, and silent.
Therefore all her pride could scarcely keep her lips from
trembling, and she would not say a word, from fear of what
her voice might be. Only she gently withdrew her hand, and
turned to the brink of the brook, and felt the fleeting of the
waters.
What could she have done more simple, and more captivating ?
Down the water flowed, as if for ever would it flow and flow; and
down she gazed at it, as if all the world went on in that way. Over

the ever-changing surface briars hung and willows wept, and the
silver-weed at her foot withdrew from the passion of the rivulet.
Then with a sudden change of mood she turned to him sadly
and proudly, and thought it no disgrace to show him freely flowing
tears.
“Mr. Nowell, you are very eloquent; but it would have been
kinder of you not to use your eloquence.”
“How could I help it? What can I do? You never would say
such a thing, if you cared a single atom for me."
“It is not that-as you know too well. It is the impos-
sibility"
“Impossibility of parting us, if only you care for me a ten
thousandth part of what I do for you. Do you now? Now
do you ?"
The young lady replied with a glance at once playful, loving, and
sorrowful, “Well, perhaps I do. But how can I hope to tell you
the accurate fraction ?"
“Fractions be hanged !” cried Clayton Nowell ; "I want every
bit of you."
Hereupon ensued a congress-in the true sense of the word-and
a press, from which the Press, though “rigidly excluded,” once for a
wonder would admit the justice of the exclusion.
At length came the lucid interval, which even lovers cannot
manage to defer for ever.
“ Come now, Clayton, no more if you please," the young lady
said in a resolute voice, at the same time replacing her gardening
hat, which seemed somehow to have fallen off: we have many
and many a trouble before us. We must be like people of the
world, you know, and not two foolish children. I am frightened to
think of my father's anger; and I cannot long keep it from him.”
“Plenty of time to discuss our troubles, my gem, my jewel, my
precious pearl. Only now pledge me once and for ever, that
nothing that possibly can happen shall part us from one another.”
“Nothing, dear Clayton; at least if you remain as true as I am.
Nothing, I mean, less than death.”
On their homeward road they were passing now under the
shadow of an old grey oak, whose dead boughs and hoary ivy took
up the word, and whispered “death.”
The youth, having touches of poetry, had some touch of super-
stition also; and a cold shudder ran through his healthy young
frame at the oracular oak's response. With love's intuition, the
girl perceived it, and crept closer to his side.
I will give you a week, dear, if you wish it,” she said, while her
right hand stole back into his; “but I could not keep it any longer
from my father, who loves me so. And all that time I shall be
wretched to think of deceiving him. I would rather meet him in
all his anger than feel myself playing false with him.”

serve.
“Of course you would,” poor Clayton answered, being himself of
the eager kind; "only give me a week, my darling, so that I may
take Sir Cradock at a happy moment, and then he will make it all
right with your father. Now for the form that our people have for
five hundred years insisted upon, borrowed no doubt from forest
usage. You know well what it is, of course."
Of course do,” she answered with a sigh which Clayton won-
dered at: “but I have no time to lose. I am very late already."
However, she could not refuse him her hand, as he went through
the form of betrothal long traditionary with the Nowells. This
old usage well became his gallant aspect and graceful figure, as
with one knee on the ground, hat cast off, and fair locks waving,
he made a deep obeisance to her, and uttered the accustomed
words.
My fealty is to you," he cried: "I am yours to command and
Of you I hold my power, and fortune, fame, and lands, and
heart, and home."
She tried to smile, as she ought to have done, while he
kissed her hand, and she touched his forehead; but some fore-
boding or terror seized her, and she could not check a long
ow sob.
They had stopped at a point where two forest-paths met, and
the bushes fell back a little, and the last of the sunset memory
glanced through the pales of a moss-grown gate, the mark
whereby some royalty, or right of chase, was limited. The youth,
surprised as well as grieved at the reception of his homage, was
soothing, administering, and persuading, in the natural manner of
young lovers, and winning her back to her usual state of mind
(which was a merry one), when she drew back with a startled
glance, as if at a hidden enemy.
Clayton, following her glance, sprang up to defend her ; but
there was no antagonist. All he saw was a man on horseback,
passing silently over the turf, behind a low bank crowned with fern.
Here a narrow track, scarce visible, saved the traveller some few
yards, subtending as it did the angle where the two paths met.
Clayton could not see the horse, for the thick brake-fern eclipsed
him. But he knew by the joggings of a hat that the nag was
getting weary. The face of the rider now expressed the most
abstract philosophy ever invented, and superlunary absence. Any
rabbit acquainted with Lavater would have come out of his hole
again for another bout of play.
Because this man was riding along, as if it never occurred to his
mind that any thing, or any one, had existed, or could exist, at a
lower level than the top of the loftiest oak-trees upwards. He
seemed to be a little man with an upward tendency of nose, red
hair, and general redness, heightened at the moment by the tint of
leaves around him. Then as he passed by a shadowy oak, which

swallowed him up in a moment, that oak (if it had been duly vocal)
would have repeated these words
“Well, if that ain't the parson's daughter, grind me under a
curry-stone. What a sly minx !—but devilish pretty. You're a deal
too soft, John Rosedew.
The young lady was of the twain the quicker to recover presence
of mind. She pressed on her glossy round head the hat which had
been so long in her left hand, and, drawing a long breath, looked
point-blank at the wondering stare of her sweetheart.
'Well, Clayton, we may make up our minds for it now.”
“For what, I should like to know? Who cares for that inter-
ioping, beetroot-coloured muff?"
'He is no muff at all, I can tell you, but an exceedingly clever
Do you mean to say you don't know him ?”
“Not I, from Esau or Ishmael. And he looks like a mixture of
both."
“ He is Doctor Rufus Hutton."
Clayton indulged in a very long whistle, indrawn, and mildly
melodious. 'Twas a trick he had learned at Oxford ; it has long
been discarded elsewhere, but at both Universities still subsists, as
the solace of newly-plucked men ; the long-drawn sound seems to
wind so soothingly down the horns of dilemma. Then the youth
jumped up, and gathered a nut, cracked it between his white front
teeth, and offered it, husk and all, well split, to his beautiful
frightened darling. She took it, without any prudery, and picked
out the thin shell, piece by piece, carefully seeking kernel. He all
the while with admiration watched the delicate fingers moving, the
reflex play of the lissome joints, the spiral thread and varying
impress of the convex tips, and the faintly flushing pink beneath
the transparency of those nails. Then she laughed and looked
slyly at him, as she turned out a fine double nut—two fat kernels
close together, shaped by one another. Of course she gave him
one, and of course we know what they did about it.
Enough to say that they very soon forgot all about Dr. Rufus
Hutton, and could scarcely part where the last branch-path was
quite near to the maiden's window. Even there, where the walks
divided, and neither could see the other, each stepped aside, and
listened long to hear the last of the other's footfall ; neither was
there peace for either, till that sound was heard again.

CHAPTER XI.
AN ADVANCED CHRISTIAN.
WHATEVER the age, or the intellect of the passing age, may be,
even if ever arise again such a cycle of brilliant minds as rose upon
this world of ours three hundred years ago, though all those bright
minds start upon their glorious career, comprising and enhancing
all the light engendered by, before, and since the time of Shakspeare,
Bacon, Newton; then, though they multiply that light tenfold by
newer genius, till a thousand waking nations gleam, like hill-tops
touched with sunrise—to guide men on the human road, to lead
then heaven-ward, all shall be no more than a benighted river
wandering away from the stars of God. Do what we will, and
think as we may, enlarging the mind in each generation, growing
contemptuous of contempt, casting caste to the winds of heaven,
and antiquating prejudice, nevertheless shall we ever outrun or
overtake true Christianity ? Science, learning, philosophy, may
regard it through a telescope: they touch it no more than astronomy
sets foot upon a star. To a thoughtful man, who is scandalized at
all the littleness felt and done under the holy name, until he almost
begins to doubt if the good outweigh the evil, it is reassurance to
remember that we are not Christians yet, and comfort to confess that
on earth we never can be. For nothing shows more clearly that
our faith is of heaven, than the truth that we cannot rise to it until
it raise us thither. And this reflection is akin to the stately writer's
sentiment, that our minds conceive so much more than our bodies
can perform, to give us token, ay, and earnest, of a future state.
Of all the creeds which have issued as yet from God, or man, or
the devil, is there another so far in advance of human civilization ?
True Christianity, like hope, cheers us to continual effort, exalts us
to unbounded prospect, flies in front of our best success.
call it a worn-out garb, when we have begun to wear it; as yet the
mantle is in the skies, and we have only the skirt with the name
Let us
on it.
Such thoughts as these were always stirring in the heart of a man
of power, a leading character in this story, a leading character
every where, whithersoever he went. Bull Garnet, Sir Cradock
Nowell's steward, was now forty-five years old, and all who met him
were surprised at his humble place in the commonwealth. A sense
of power so pervaded even the air he breathed, that strong men
rebelled instinctively, though he urged no supremacy; weak men
caught some infection from him, and went home and astonished their
families. Strong and weak alike confessed that it was a mysterious
thing how a man of such motive strength, and self-reliance illimit-

able, could be content with no higher post than that of a common
steward. But neighbourly interest in this subject met with no
encouragement. Albeit his views of life expanded into universal
sympathy, his practice now and then admitted some worldly-wise
restrictions. And so, while really glad to advise on the doings of
all around him, he never permitted brotherly interference with
Whoever saw Bull Garnet once was sure to know him again.
If you met him in a rush to save the train, your eyes would turn
and follow him. “There goes a man remarkable, whether for
good or evil.” Tall though he was, and large of frame, with
swinging arms, and a square expression, it was none of this that pro-
longed the bystander's glance into a gaze. It was the cubic mass of
the forehead, the span between the enormous eyes, and the depth
of the thick-set jowl, which rolled with the volume of a bulldog's.
The rest of the face was in keeping therewith : the nose bold,
broad, and patulous, the mouth large and well banked up, the chin
big and heavily rounded. No shade of a hair was ever allowed to
dim his healthy colouring, his head was cropped close as a Puritan's,
and when beard grew fast he shaved twice in a day. High culture
was a necessity to him, whether of mind, or body, or of the world
external ; he would no more endure a moustache on his lip than
a frouzy hedgerow upon his farm. That man, if you came to think
about him, more and more each time you saw how different he was
from other men. Distinctness is a great merit in roses, especially
when the French rosarians have so overpiled the catalogue. It is plea-
sant to walk up to a standard, and say, “You are ‘Jules Margottin,'
and your neighbour the ‘Keepsake of Malmaison;' I cannot mistake
you
for
any other, however hot the weather may be.” Distinctness
is also a merit in apples, pears, and even peaches; but most of all
in man. And so, without knowing the reason, perhaps, we like a
man whom we cannot mistake for any other of our million
brethren.
However, Mr. Garnet's leading trait was not at first sight
amiable. It was, if one may be allowed, upon the strength of the
subject, to indulge in strongish language,-a furious, reckless,
damnable, and thoroughly devilish temper. All great qualities,
loving-kindness, yearnings for Christian ideals, fell like sugar-
canes to a hurricane in the outburst and rush of that temper.
He was always grieved and deeply humbled, when the havock
v:as done ; and, being a man of generous nature, would bow his
soul in atonement. But in the towering of his wrath, how grand
a sight he afforded! As fine as the rush of the wild Atlantic upon
St. David's Head. For a time, perhaps, he would chafe and fret
within the straits of reason, his body surging to and fro, and his
mind making grasp at boundaries. Then some little aggravation,
some trifle which no other man would notice-and out would leap

all the pent-up fury of his soul. His great eyes would gather
volume, and spring like a mastiff from a kennel ; his mighty
forehead would scarp and chine like the headland when the plough
turns; and all his aspect grow four-square with more than hydraulic
pressure. Whoever then could gaze unmoved at the raging fire of
his eyes must be a philosopher or a fool-and sometimes the two
are synonymous.
But touch him, even then, with a single turn of softness, the
thought of some one dear to him, a large and genial sentiment, or
a tender memory—and the lines of his face would relax and quiver,
the blazing eyes be suffused and subdued to a tremulous glow; and
the man, so far beyond reason's reach, be led back, like a boy, by
the feelings.
All who think they can catch and analyze that composite, subtle,
volatile gas-neither body nor spirit, yet in fief to the laws of either
—which men call “human nature," these, no doubt, will perceive
at once, from even this meagre description, that Mr. Bull Garnet's
nature was scant of that playful element, humour. If thought be
(as German philosophers have it) an electric emanation, then wit is
the forked flash, gone in a moment; humour the soft summer
lightning that shows us the clouds and the depth, the background
and night of ourselves. No man of large humour, can be in a
passion, without laughing inwardly at himself. And wrath, which
laughs at itself, is not of much avail in business.
Mr. Garnet's wrath, on the contrary, was a fine, free-boiling,
British anger, not at all liable to reason, and therefore very
precious. By dint of it, he could score at night nearly twice as
much work done in the day as a peaceable man could have reckoned.
Man or woman, boy or girl, Mr. Garnet could extract from each all
tri :0apacity, leaving them just enough of power to crawl
honze stiti, and admire him F the truth of it is, as all kn to
their cost, who have had much to do with spade or plough, hod or
hammer, that the British workman admires most the master who
makes him sweat most. Perhaps it ought not to be so. Theo-
retically, we regard it thus, that a man ought to perspire, upon
principle, when he is working for another man. But tell us where,
and oh ! where, to find the gentle British labourer who takes that
view of the subject.
Sith it will na better be; let us out and look for him. The sky is
bright blue, and the white clouds flock slowly, like sheep cropping
after each other. What man but loves the open air, and to walk
about and think of it, with fancies flitting lazily, like fluff of dandelion?
What man but loves to sit under a tree, and let the winds go
wandering, and the shadows come and play with him, to let work
be a pleasant memory, and hurry a storm of the morning ? Every
body except Bull Garnet.

CHAPTER XII.
NEWS FOR MR. GARNET.
ALL the leaves of the New Forest, save those of the holly and
mistletoe, some evergreen spines, and the blinder sort, that know
not a wink from a nod—all the leaves, I mean, that had sense of their
position, and when to blush and when to retire, and how much was
due to the roots that taught them-all these leaves were beginning
to feel that their time in the world was over. The trees had begun
to stand tier upon tier, in an amphitheatrical fashion, and to
sympathize more with the sunset; while the sun every evening was
kissing his hands, and pretending to think them younger. Some
outspoken trees leaned forward, well in front of the forest-galleries,
with amber sleeves, and loops of gold, and braids of mellow
abandonment, like liberal Brazilian ladies, bowing from the
balconies. Others drew away behind them, with their mantles
folded, leaning back into unprobed depths of semi-transparent
darkness, as the forest of the sky amasses, when the moon is rising.
Some had cast off their children in parachutes, swirling as the
linden berries do throughout September; some were holding their
treasures grimly, and would even when they were naked.
Now the flush of the grand autumnal tide had not risen yet to its
glory, but was freaking, and glancing, and morrising round the bays
and the juts of the foliage. Or it ruffled, among the ferny knaps,
and along the winding alleys. The sycamores truly were reddening
fast, and the chestnut palms growing bronzy ; the limes were
yellowing here and there, and the sere leaves of the woodbine
fluttered the cob of clear red berries. But the great beechen hats,
which towered and darkened atop of the moorland hollows and
across the track of the woodman-these, and the oaks along the
rise, where the turtle dove was cooing, had only shown their sense
of the age by an undertint of olive.
It was now the fifth day of October—a day to be remembered
long by all the folk of Nowelhurst. Mr. Garnet stood at the end
of his garden, where a narrow pinewood gate opened to one of the
forest rides. Of course he was doing something, and doing it very
forcibly. His life was a fire that burned very fast, having plenty of
work to poke it. But the little job which he now had in hand was
quite a relaxation : there was nothing Bull Garnet enjoyed so much
as cutting down a tree. He never cared what time of year it was,
whether the leaves were on or off, whether the sap were up or down,
as we incorrectly express it. The sap of a tree is ever moving, liké
our own life-blood; only it feels the change of season more than we
who have no roots. Has a dormouse no circulation, when he
coils himself up in his elbowed hole? Is there no evaporation from

the frozen waters? The two illustrations are wide apart, but the
principle is the same. Nature admits no absolute stoppage, except
as death, in her cradle of life; and then she sets to, and transmutes
it. Why Bull Garnet so enjoyed the cutting down of a tree, none but
those who themselves enjoy it may pretend to say. Of course, we will
not refer it to the reason assigned in the well-known epigram, which
contains such a wholesale condemnation of this arboricidal age. In
another century, London builders will perhaps discover, when there
are no trees left, that a bit of tuck-pointing by the gate, and a dab of
mud-plaster beside it, do not content the heart of man like the
leaves, and the drooping shadowy rustle, which are the type of him-
self and his life.
Bull Garnet stood there in the October morning, with the gate
wide open, flung back by his strong hand upon its hinges, as if it
had no right to them. The round bolt dropped from the quivering
force, dropped through the chase of the loop, and bedded deep in the
soft, wet ground. With much satisfaction the gate brought up, and
felt itself anchored safely ; Bull Garnet gave the bolt a kick, which
hurled the rusty screws out. Then he scarcely stopped to curse
the blacksmith; he wanted the time for the wood-cutters. At a
glint from the side of his vast round eyes-eyes that took in every
thing, and made all the workmen swear and believe that he could
see round a corner-he descried that the axemen were working the
tree askew to the strain of the ropes. The result must be that the
comely young oak, just proud of its first big crop of acorns, would
swerve on the bias of the wind, stagger heavily, and fall headlong
upon the smart new fence. There was no time for words-in a
moment he had kicked the men right and left, torn off his coat, and
caught up an axe, and dealt three thundering strokes in the laggard
twist of the breach. Away went the young oak, swaying wildly,
trying once to recover itself, then crashing and creaking through the
brushwood, with a swish from its boughs and leaves, and a groan
from its snaggy splinters. A branch took one of the men in his
face, and laid him flat in a tussock of grass.
“Serve you right, you lubber ; I'm devilish glad,” cried Bull
Garnet ; "and I hope you won't move for a week.”
The next moment, he went up and raised him, felt that his limbs
were sound, and gave him a dram of brandy.
“ All right, my fine fellow. Next time you'll know something of
the way to fell a tree. Go home now, and I'll send you a bottle of
wine.”
But the change of his mood, the sudden softening, the glisten
that broke through the flash of his eyes, was not caused
this time by the inroad of rapid Christian feeling. It was the
approach of his son that stroked the down of his heart the right
way. Bull Garnet loved nothing else in this world, or in the world
to come, with a hundredth part of the love wherewith he loved his

only son. Lo, the word "love" thrice in a sentence-nevertheless,
let it stand so. For is there a word in our noble tongue, or in any
other language, to be compared for power and beauty with that
little word “love"?
Bob came down the path of the kitchen-garden at his utmost
speed. He was like his father in one or two things, and most
unlike in others. His nature was softer and better by far, though
not so grand and striking-Bull Garnet in the young Adam again,
ere ever the devil came. All this the father felt, but knew not : it
never occurred to him to inquire why he adored his son.
The boy leaped the new X fence very cleverly, through the fork
of the fingers, and stood before his father in a flame of indignation.
Mr. Garnet, with that queer expression which the face of a middle-
aged man wears when he recalls his boyhood, ere yet he begins to
admire it, was looking at his own young life with a contemplative
terror. He was saying to himself, “What cheek this boy has got!”
and he was feeling all the while that he loved him the more for
having it.
“Hurrah, Bob, my boy; you're come just in time.”
Mr. Garnet tried very hard to look as if he expected approval.
Well enough all the time he knew that he had no chance of getting
it. For Bob loved nature in any form, especially as expressed in
the noble eloquence of a tree. And now he saw why he had been
sent to the village on a trifling errand that morning.
“ Just in time for what, sir ?” Bob's indignation waxed yet more.
That his father should dare to chaff him !
“ Just in time to tell us all about these wonderful red-combed
fungi. What do you call them—some long name, as wonderful as
themselves?"
Bob kicked them aside contemptuously. He could have told a
long story about them, and things which men of thrice his age, who
have neglected their mother, would be glad to listen to. Nature,
desiring not revenge, has it in the credulous itch of the sons whó
have turned their backs on her.
“Oh, father,” said Bob, with the tears in his eyes ; " father, you
can't have known that three purple emperors came to this oak, and
sat upon the top of it, every morning for nearly a week, in the
middle of July. And it was the most handsomest fifty-year oak
till you come right to Brockenhurst bridge.”
“Most handsomest, Bob !" cried Mr. Garnet, glad to lay hold of
any thing; come along with me, my son; I must see to your
education.
Near them stood a young spruce fir, not more than five feet high.
It had thrown up a straight and tapering spire, scaled with tender
green. Below were tassels, tufts, and pointlets, all in triple order,
pluming over one another in a pile of beauty. The tips of all were
iouched with softer and more glaucous tone. But all this gentle

tint and form was only as a framework now, a loom to bear the
web of heaven. For there had been a white mist that morning-
autumn's breath made visible; and the tree with its net of spider's
webs had caught the lucid moisture. Now, as the early sunlight
opened through the layered vapours, that little spruce came boldly
forth a dark bay of the forest, and met all the spears of the orient.
Looped and traced with threads of gauze, the lacework of a fairy's
thought, scarcely daring to breathe upon its veil of tremulous
chastity, it kept the wings of light on the hover, afraid to weigh
down the whiteness. A maiden with the love-dream nestling under
the bridal faldetta, a child of genius breathing softly at his own
fair visions, even an infant's angel whispering to the weeping
mother—what image of humanity can be so bright and exquisite as
a common tree's apparel ?
Father, can you make that ?" Mr. Garnet checked his rapid
stride;
and for once he admired a tree.
No, my son ; only God can do such glorious work as that.”
“But it don't take God to undo it. Smash!”
Bob dashed his fists through the whole of it, and all the draped
embroidery, all the pearly filagree, all the festoons of silver, were
but as a dream when a yawning man stretches his scraggy arms
forth. The little tree looked woe-begone, stale, and draggled with
drunken tears.
“Why, Bob, I am ashamed of you.”
Father, so am I of you."
Before the bold speech was well out of his mouth, Bob took
heartily to his heels; and, for once in his life, Mr. Garnet found
himself in the weaker position. After all, he was not so very angry,
for he thought that his son had been rather clever in his mode of
enforcing the moral ; and a man who loves ability, and loves his
boy still more, regards with a liberal shrewdness the proof of the
one in the other.
Bull Garnet was a Christian of the most advanced intelligence,
so far as our ideas at the present time extend. He felt the beauty
and perfection of the type which is set before us.
He nevei

neither did he clip them to the shape of his own esophagus. Only
in practice, like the rest of us, he was sadly centrifugal. He may
have regarded the Decalogue as the bond of a bygone covenant;
at any rate there was one commandment from which he omitted
the negative, and daily honoured it in the breach on the mildest
provocation.
Now with his nostrils widely open, and great eyes set on the ground,
he was pacing rapidly up and down his sheltered kitchen-garden.
Every square was in perfect order, every tree in its proper compass,
all the edging curt and keen. The ground was cropped with that
trim luxuriance which we never see except under first-rate manage-

ment. All the coleworts for the winter, all the well-earthed celery,
all the buttoning Brussels sprouts, salsify just fit to dig, turnips
lifting whitely forth (though not enough for fashion), modest savoys
just hearting in and saying “no” to the dew-beads, prickly spinach
daily widening the chipped arrowhead-they all had room to eat
and drink, and no man grudged his neighbour; yet Puck himself
could not have skipped through with dry feet during a hoar-frost.
As for weeds, Bull Garnet-well, what "flowers of speech” would
have followed them !
Suddenly a small, spare man turned the corner upon him, where
a hedge of hornbeam, trimmed and dressed as if with a pocket-
comb, broke the south-western violence. Most men would have
shown their hats above the narrow spine, but Rufus Hutton was
very short, and seldom carried a chimney-pot.
“Sir, what can I do for you?" said Mr. Garnet, slightly surprised,
but not taken aback.
“ Excuse me, sir, but I called at your house, and came this way
to find you. You know me well, by name, I believe ; as I have the
pleasure of knowing you. Rufus Hutton; ahem, sir ! Delightful
occupation! I, too, am a gardener. Dumelow Seedling,' I
flatter myself. Know them well by the eye, sir. But what a
difference the soil makes! Ah, yes, let them hang till the frost
What a plague we have had with earwigs! Get into the
seat of the fruit; now just let me show you. Ah, you beggars,
there you are.
Never take them by the head, sir, or they'd nip my
fingers. Take them under the abdomen, and they haven't room to
twist upon you. There, now ; what can he do ?”
Not even thank you, sir, for killing him. And now what can I
do for you ?”
" Mr. Garnet, I will come to the point. A man learns that in
India. Too hot, sir, for much talking. Bless my heart, I have
known the thermometer at 10 o'clock P.M., sir-not in the barracks,
mind me, nor in a stilling nullah-
“Excuse me, I have read of all that. I have an engagement,
Dr. Hutton, at eight minutes past eleven.”
“Bless my heart, and I have an appointment at 11.9 and five
seconds. How singular a coincidence !”
Bull Garnet looked down at the little doctor, and thought him
too small to be angry with. Moreover, he was a practical man,
and scarcely knew what chaff meant. So he kept his temper won-
derfully, while Rufus looked up at him gravely, with his little sharp
eyes gleaming through his burnt complexion, like glow-worms
among heather.
“I have heard of you, Dr. Hutton, as a very skilful gardener.
Perhaps you would like to look round my garden, while I go and
despatch my business. If so, I will be with you again in exactly
thirty-five minutes."

“Stop, stop, stop! you'll have cause to regret it all your life, if
you don't stop to hear my news.”
So Rufus Hutton thought. But Mr. Garnet had cause to lament
all the rest of his life, that he ever stopped to hear it.
CHAPTER XIII.
GREAT PREPARATIONS.

BULL GARNET forgot his appointment for eight minutes after
eleven ; indeed it was almost twelve o'clock when he came out of
the summer-house (made of scarlet-runners) to which he had led
Dr. Hutton, when he saw that his tale was of interest. As he came
forth, and the noonday sun fell upon his features, any one who knew
him would have been surprised at their expression. A well-known
artist, employed upon a fresco not far from Lyndhurst, had once
described Mr. Garnet's face in its ordinary aspect as violence in
repose." Epigrammatic descriptions of the infinite human nature
are like tweezers to hold a whale with. At any rate, now• Bull
Garnet's face, as he strode out of his summer-house, may have
expressed some violence, but certainly no repose.
Now Rufus Hutton, however garrulous, was a kind and sensible
man, and loth to make any mischief. He ran after Mr. Garnet,
hotly. Bull Garnet had quite forgotten him, and would take no
notice. The doctor made a short cut through a quarter of Brussels
sprouts (which almost knocked off his wide-awake hat) and stood
in the arch of trimmed yew-tree, opening at the western side upon
the forest lane. Here he stretched his arms to either upright, and
mightily barred all exit. He knew that the other would not go
home, and he meant him to go no further.
Presently Bull Garnet strode up : not with his usual swing, how-
ever ; not with his wonted self-confidence. He seemed to walk off
from a staggering blow, which had, dulled his brain for the moment.
He stopped politely before Mr. Hutton (who expected to be thrust
aside), and asked as if with new interest, and as if he had not heard
the tale out,
Are you quite sure, Dr. Hutton, that you described the dress
correctly?”
“As sure as I am of the pattern of my own pantaloons. Miss
Rosedew wore, as I told you, a lavender serge, looped at the sides
with purple-a pretty dress for Christmas, but it struck me as. warm
for Michaelmas. Perhaps it was meant for the Michaelmas daisies;
or perhaps she suffers from rheumatism, or flying pains in the
patella."

How can I speak of such a thing after that lovely
creature? Such an exquisite fall of the shoulders-good wide
shoulders too-and such a delicious waist! I assure you, my dear
sir, I have seen fine men in India-
“Dr. Hutton,” said Mr. Garnct, sternly, “let me hear no inore o
that. You are a newly-married man, a man of my time of life. I
will have no warm description of- of any young ladies.”
Rufus Hutton was a peppery man, and not very easily cowed.
Nevertheless, his mind was under the pressure of a stronger one.
So he only relieved himself with a little brag.
“Why, Mr. Garnet, you cross-examine me as I did the natives
when I acted as judge in Churramuttee, when the two chuprassies
came before me, and the water-carrier. I tell you, sir, I see more
in a glance than most men do in a long set stare, when they are
called in to appraise a thing. I could tell every plait in your shirt-
front, and the stuff and cut of your coat, before you could say good
morning. It was only last Thursday that Mrs. Hutton, who is a
most remarkable woman, made an admirable observation about my
rapid perception.”
* I have not the smallest doubt of it. And I believe that you
fully deserved it. You will therefore perceive at once that this
matter must go no further. Did you see my—son at the house
here?"
"No. Only the maid-servant, who directed me where to find
you."
“ Then you did not go in at all, I suppose ?”
No; but I admired greatly your mode of training that beautiful
tropæolum over the porch. I must go and look at it again, with
your kind permission. I never neglect the chance of a wrinkle
such as that."
“Another time, Dr. Hutton, I shall hope to show it to you; though
you must have seen it all at a glance, for it is simpler than my shirt-
fronts. But my business takes me now to the Hall, and I shall be
glad of your company."
Hospitable fellow, with a vengeance !” thought little Rufus.
“And I heard he had some wonderful sherry, and it's past my time
for a snack. Serves me right for meddling with other people's
business."
But while he stood hesitating, and casting fond glances towards
the cottage, Mr. Garnet, without any more ado, passed his powerful
long arm through the little wing of Rufus, and hurried him down
the dingle.
“Excuse me, sir, but I have never much time to waste. This, as
you know is a most busy day, and all the preparations are under

that question is not for me. Cradock Nowell is a noble fellow, and
I have the highest respect for him.”
“Well, I rather prefer young Clayton. Having brought them
both into the world, I ought to understand them. But I hope
he won't make a fool of himself in this matter we have been
talking of."
Mr. Garnet jerked his companion's arm, and his face went pale
as Portland stone.
Make a d-d rogue more likely. And he won't be the first of
his family."
“Yes, as you say," replied the doctor to all he could catch of the
muttered words, which few over the crown of his hat, “ beyond all
doubt the first family in this part of the kingdom, and so they must
have their jubilee. But I trust you will use with the utmost caution
what I thought it best to confide to you, under the bond of secrecy.
Of course, I could not think of telling papa, either of lady or gentle-
man; and knowing how you stand with the family, you seemed to
me the proper person to meet this little difficulty.”
Beyond a doubt, I am.”
“ Pooh, sir, a boy and a girl. I wonder you think so much about
it. Men never know their own minds in the matter until they
arrive at our age. And as for the chits on the other side-whew,
they blow right and left, as the feathers on their hats do."
"That is not the case with my family. We make up our minds,
and stick to them.”
“Then your family is the exception, which only proves niy rule;
and I am glad that it has nothing to do with the present question.”
When they came to that part of the lawn in front of the ancient
Hall where the fireworks stage had been reared on a gently-rising
mound, Cradock Nowell met them, with a book in his hand. To-
morrow he would be twenty-one ; and a more honest, open-hearted
fellow, or a better built one, never arrived at man's estate, whether
for wealth or poverty. He had not begun to think very deeply;
indeed, who could expect it, where trouble had never entered ? It
is pain that deepens the channel of thought, and sorrow that sweeps
the bar away. Cradock as yet was nothing more than a clever,
fine young man, an elegant and accurate scholar, following thought
more than forming it. Nevertheless, he had the material of a
grand unselfish character-of a nature which, when perfected, could
feel its imperfections. Sorrow and trial were needed for him ; and
God knows he soon got enough of them.
He shoved away his Tauchnitz Herodotus in his shooting-coat
pocket. Neither of the men he met was a scholar ; neither would
feel any interest in it. Being driven forth by his father's grumbling
at the little pleasure he showed in the fuss that was making about
him, he had brought his genial, true cosmopolite to show him a

53
thing which his heart would have loved. Cradock had doubled
down the leaf whereon was described the building of the boat-
bridge over the Hellespont. Neither had he forgotten the inter-
ment of the Scythian kings. It was not that he purposed to instruct
the carpenters thence, or to shed any light on their doings; but
that he hoped to learn from them some words to jot down on the
margin. He had discovered already, being helped thereto by the
tongue of Ytene, that hundreds of forcible Saxon words still lurk in
the crafts to which the beaten race betook itself—words which are
wanted sadly, and pieced out very unpleasantly by roundabout
foreign fanglements.
Even the gratitude now due to the good will of all the neighbour-
hood, had failed to reconcile his mind to the turgid part before him.
At Oxford he had been dubbed already“ Caradoc the Philosopher;"
and the more he learned, the less he thought of his own importance.
He had never regarded the poor around him as dogs made for him
to whistle to; he even knew that he owed them some duties, and
wondered how to discharge them. Though bred of high Tory
lineage, and corded into it by the twists of habit and education, he
never could hang by neck and gullet; he never could show base-
ment only, as a well-roped onion does. Encased as he was by
strict surroundings, he never could grow quite straight and even,
without a seed inside him, as a prize cucumber does in the cylinder
of an old chimney-glass.
Some of this dereliction sprang, no doubt, from his native staple,
and some from the free trade of his mind with the great heart
called " John Rosedew."
Now he came up, and smiled, like a boy of fourteen, in Mr. Gar-
net's face ; for he liked Bull Garnet's larger qualities, and had no
fear of his smaller ones. Mr. Garnet never liked ; he always loved
or hated. He loved Cradock Nowell heartily, and heartily hated
Clayton.
“Behind my time, you see, Cradock. I am glad you are doing
my duty.—Ha, there! I see you, my man.”
The man was skulking his work, in rigging out with coloured
lamps an old oak fifty yards away. That ancient oak, the pride of
the chase, was to represent, to-morrow night, a rainbow reflectin ;
“Cradock Nowell." Young Crad, who regarded it all as ill-taste, if
it were not positive sin, had lifted his voice especially against that
oak's bedizenment. “ 'It will laugh at us from every acorn," he had
said to his father. But Sir Cradock was now a man of sixty, and
a stickler for ancient ways. He hated fuss and ostentation, but he
could not disappoint the tenants and the neighbourhood.
At the sound of the steward's tremendous voice, the man ran
recklessly out on the branch, the creaking of which had alarmed
him. Snap went the branch at a cankered part, and the poor
fellow dropped from a height of nearly forty feet. But the crashing

wood caught in the bough beneath, which was sound and strong,
and there hung the man, uninjured as yet, clinging only by one arm,
and struggling to throw his feet up. In a moment Cradock caught
hold of a ladder, reared, and fixed, and mounted it, and helped the
poor fellow to slide off upon it, and stayed him there gasping and
quivering: Bull Garnet set foot on the lowest rung, and Rufus
Hutton added his weight, which was not very considerable. A
dozen workmen came running up, and the man, with the whole of
his joints laid loose, was carefully eased to the ground.
“Mr. Garnet," said Cradock, with some contempt, “would you
have walked on that branch yourself ?”
“ To be sure I would, if I had orders.”
“But you were the one who gave the order. You frightened him
into a thing which might have cost him his life, and cost you
nothing."
“Give me your hand, my boy. I was wrong, and you are right.
I wish every man to hear me. Jem, come to my house this evening.
You owe your life to Mr. Cradock.”
Nature itself is better than the knowledge of human nature. Mr.
Garnet, by generosity quicker than quickest perception, had turned
to his credit an incident which would have disgraced a tyrant. A
powerful man’s confession of wrong is sure to enhance his power.
While the inen were falling to work again, every one under the
steward's eyes, Sir Cradock Nowell and Clayton his son came
cantering up from the stables. The dry leaves crackled or skirred
away crisply from their horses' feet, for the day was fine and breezy;
the nags were arching their necks and pricking their bright ears
with enjoyment; but neither of the riders seemed to be in high
spirits. The workmen touched their hats to them in a manner very
different from that with which they received Mr. Garnet or Cradock
Nowell. There was more of distant respect in it, and less of real
interest.
Sir Cradock now was a perfect specimen of the well-bred English-
man at threescore years of age. Part of his life had been touched
by sorrow, but in the main he had prospered. A man of ability and
high culture, who has not suffered deeply, is apt, after passing
middle age, to substitute tact for feeling, and common sense for
sympathy. Mellow and blest is the age of the man who naturally
can do otherwise.
Sir Cradock Nowell knew his age, and dressed himself accord-
ingly. Neither stiffness nor laxity, neither sporting air nor austerity,
could be perceived in his garb or manner. He respected himself
and all whom he met, until he had cause to the contrary. But his
heart, instead of expanding, had narrowed in the loneliness of his
life ; and he really loved only one in the world—the son who rode
beside him. He had loved John Rosedew well and truly for many
an honest year; of late, admiration was uppermost, and love grown

a thing to be thought about. The cause of the change was his own
behaviour, and John's deep hate of injustice.
That old friend of the family could not keep silence always at
the preference of Clayton, and the disparagement of Cradock. The
father himself could scarcely have told whence arose this preference.
Year by year it had been growing, for a long time unsuspected ;
suspected then and fought with, then smothered at once and justi-
fied ; allowed at last to spread and thrive on the right of its own
existence. And yet any one, to look at Sir Cradock, would have
thought him justice personified.
And so he was, as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions. Clear
intelligence, quick analysis, keen perception of motive in others,
combined with power to dispense (when nature so does) with reason,
and used with high sense of honour-all these things made him an
oracle to every one but himself. Although he had never been in
the army, he looked like a veteran soldier; and his seat on horse-
back was stiff and firm, rather than easy and graceful. Tall, spare
figure, and grey moustache, Roman nose, and clear bright eyes, thin
lips, and broad white forehead-the expression of the whole
bespoke an active, resolute, upright man, not easily pleased or dis-
pleased.
As every one now must keep holiday, the farmers had challenged
the Ringwood club to play them a game of cricket, and few having
seen a bat ere then, some practice seemed indispensable. Accord-
ingly, while Bull Garnet was busy among the firework people, the
farmers, being up for play, were at it in hard earnest, toiling with
much applause and joy, threshing or churning, mowing or plough-
ing, and some making kicks at the ball. Dr. Hutton looked on in
a spirited manner, and Cradock was bowling with all his might at
the legs of a petty tyrant, when his father and brother rode up
between the marquees and the awnings. The tyrannical farmer
received a stinging crack on the shin, and thought (though he feared
to say)“d-n.
Hurrah, Crad ! more jerk to your elbow !" cried Clayton, who
also disliked the man; “ Blackers, you mustn't break the ball, it's
against the laws of cricket.”
Grinning sympathy and bad wit deepened the bruise of the tibia,
till Farmer Blackers forgot all prudence in the deep jar of the

To the great surprise of all present there, Sir Cradock did not
look at the speaker, but turned on his son with anger.
Sir, you ought to know better. Your sense of justice will lead
you, I hope, to apologize to that man.”
He did not wait to see the effect of this public reproof, which was
heard by a hundred people, but struck his mare hastily on the
marrow.

shoulder, called Clayton, and rode away. Cradock, who now had
the ball in his hands, threw it a hundred feet high.
“Catch it who will,” he said ; “I shall bowl no more to-day.
Farmer Blackers, I beg your pardon; I did not know you were so
tender.”
Feeling far more tender himself (for all that was the youth's
bravado), he went away, doubting right and wrong, to his own little
oom on the ground floor. There he would smoke his pipe, and
think, and condemn himself, if the verdict were true. A young
min's sense of justice boils with less of fuel than is needed to make
an old man's simmer.
CHAPTER XIV.
TO LOSE EVERY THING.
ALTHOUGH Cradock Nowell was a generous fellow, and deeply
attached to his twin-brother Clayton, he was not quite so faultless
as to bear with an even mind and perfect self-denial his father's
evident preference of the younger brother. Self-love suggested,
now and then, that Sir Cradock showed very bad taste in his choice,
and that Mr. Rosedew was a better judge : also that these bitter
pills (administered, perhaps unwittingly, at almost every meal-time)
were only part of a lowering system, meant to reduce him from self-
assertion as the elder brother.
But self-love cannot always have the ascendant with young
people, unless they are very small; and upon the whole, Master
Cradock thought it hard to be the elder son. He little imagined
how near at hand the remedy for this evil was ; for while he yet
pondered these things slowly over the pipe of contemplation, a pair
of keen eyes twinkled in at the window, and a shrewd, shrill voice
made entry.
Pray let me in, Mr. Nowell ; I want to inquire about the
grapes.”
“What a wonderful man that is !” said Cradock to himself, as he
came from his corner reluctantly to open the French window
“there is nothing he doesn't inquire about. Erotetic philosopher !
He has only been here some three or four days, and he knows all
our polity better than we do! I wish his wife would come; though
I believe he is an honest fellow."
Unconscious of any satirical antithesis, he opened the window,
and admitted the polypragmonic doctor; and, knowing that homæo-
pathic treatment is the wisest for garrulous subjects, he began
;

saw
upon him at once. Nor omitted a spice of domesticity, which he
thought would be sove
vereign.
“Now, Dr. Hutton, it is too bad of you to wander about like a
bachelor. How long before we have the pleasure of seeing Mrs.
Hutton ?”
“My dear boy, you know the reason; I hope you know the
eason. Your roads are very rough for ladies, especially when in
delicate health, and our four-wheel is being mended. So I rode
over alone; and what a lovely ride it is! Ah, Clayton-yes,
Clayton somewhere. But your father has promised most kindly to
send a carriage to-morrow to Geopharmacy Lodge—the name of
our little place, sir."
At the thought of his home, the little doctor pulled up both his
shirt-collars, and looked round the room disparagingly.
“Oh, I am very glad to hear it. Meanwhile, you would like to
see our grapes. Let me show you the way to the vinery ; though I
cannot take you without misgivings. Your gardening fame has
frightened us. Our old man, Snip, is quite afraid of your new
lights and experience.”
“ Sensible lad,” muttered Rufus Hutton, who was pleasantly con-
ceited—“uncommonly sensible lad! I am not at all sure that he
isn't a finer fellow than Clayton. But I must take my opportunity
now, while he has his stock off. There is something wrong : I am
sure of it."
“Excuse me a moment,” said Cradock; “I am sorry to keep you
waiting, but I must just put on my neckerchief, if I can only find it.
How very odd ! I could have declared I put it on that table.”
“What's that I see on the floor there, by the corner of the book-
case?” Rufus pointed his cane at the tie, which lay where himself
had thrown it.
“Oh, thank you ; must be getting blind, for I am sure I looked
there just now.'
While the young man stooped forward, the little doctor, who had
posted himself for the purpose, secured a quick glimpse at the back
of his neck, where the curling hair fell sideways. That glance
increased his curiosity, and confirmed his strange suspicions. The
surprise and suspicion had broken upon him, as he stood by the
farmer's wicket, and Cradock sprang up to the bowling crease. And
now, in the hurry of discovery, he forgot all scruples. It was strange
that he had felt any, for he was not very sensitive; but Cradock,
with all his good nature, had a certain unconscious dignity, from
which Dr. Hutton retreated.
“ The grapes I came to inquire about,” said Rufus, with ch
solemnity, “are not those in the vinery, which I have seen often
enough, but those on your neck, Mr. Nowell.”
Cradock returned with a look of surprise, but more at the in-
quirer's manner than at his seeming impertinence.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“I really cannot see how the 'grapes,' as some people call the
blue lines on my neck, can interest you, sir, or are important enough
to be spoken of.”
“ Then I do, Cradock Nowell. Do you refuse to let me see
them ?"
“No, why should I? though I might refuse it to any one, when
demanded so. Not that I am sensitive about such a trifle. You, as
a medical man, and an old friend of my father, are welcome to your
autopsy. Is not that what you call it, sir?”
Nevertheless, from the tone of his voice, Rufus Hutton knew that
he liked it not—for it was a familiarity, and seemed to the youth a
childish one.
“Sit down, young man,
sit down," said the doctor, very pompously,
and waiving further discussion. " I am not-I mean to say you are
taller than when I first-ah, yes, manipulated you.”
As the doctor warmed to his subject, he grew more and more
professional, and perhaps less considerate, until his good feelings
came into play, for his heart, after all, was right. It is as needless
as it would be difficult to report all his technical terms : enough
that he exclaimed at last, after a long inspection-
“Sir, this confirms to a nicety my metrostigmatic theory."
“Dr. Hutton, I know not what you mean, neither do I wish to
know."
Cradock put on his neckerchief anyhow, and walked to his chair
by the mantelpiece, although no fire was burning. The medical
man said nothing, but gravely looked out of the window. Presently
the young gentleman felt that he was not acting hospitably.
“ Excuse me, sir, if I have seemed rude ; but you do not know
how these things I
mean, when I think of my mother, of whom
you have spoken so often. Let me ring for some sherry and sand-
wiches; you have had no luncheon."
“Ring for some brandy, my boy ; and give me a cheroot. What
a magnificent property ! Look at the sweep and the range of the
land-look at the woods, and the hills, and the meadows-and
then think of losing the whole at a blow !"
Instead of ringing, Cradock went and fetched the cognac himself,
and took down a glass from a cupboard.
“Two glasses, my dear boy, two."
“No, sir; I never take it."
“Then take it now, for the first time. Here, let me feel your
pulse."
“Once for all, I beg you to tell me what is all this mystery? Do
you think I am a child »»
“Fill your pipe again, while I light a cigar."
Cradock did as he was told, although with trembling hands.
Rufus Hutton went for a wine-glass, filled it with brandy, and
pushed it across, then gulped down half a tumblerful ; but Cradock
did not taste his.

“Now, my boy, can you bear some very bad news indeed ?"
Any thing better than this suspense. I have heard some bad
news lately, which has seasoned me for any thing."
This was a rumour concerning Amy Rosedew.
“ Then listen to this. You are not the heir to this title or these
estates. You are only the younger son.”
Is that all ?”
All! Isn't that enough? Good God! What more would you
have?-you don't deserve brandy."
“ My father will be glad, and so will Clayton, and-perhaps one
other. But I don't mean to say that I am.
“I should rather fancy not. But you take it most philoso-
phically!"
Dr. Hutton gazed at the poor young fellow in surprise and admi-
ration, trying vainly to make him out. Then he reached over to
Cradock's elbow, took his glass of cognac, and swallowed it.
“This has upset me, my boy, more than you. How miserable I
felt about it! But perhaps you place no faith in my opinion about
the matter?"
“Indeed, it has quite amazed me; and I have had no time to
think of it. My head seems spinning round. Please to say no
more just for a minute or two, unless you find it uncomfortable."
He leaned back in his chair, and tried to think, but could not
make head or tail of it.
Rufus Hutton said nothing. In spite of all his experience, the
scene was very strange to him ; and he watched it out with interest,
which deepened into strong feeling.
“Now, Dr. Hutton,” said the youth, trying to look as he thought
he ought, though he could not keep his lips quite steady,“ I beg you
to think of me no more. Let us have the strictest justice. I have
not known you so long-so long as you have known me-but I feel
that you would not say what you have said, without the strongest
evidence.”
“ Confound me for a meddlesome fool! My dear boy, no one has
heard us. Let us sink the matter entirely. Least said, soonest
mended.”
“ What do you mean? Do you think for a moment that I would
be a blackguard ?"
“Hush !-don't get so excited. Why, you look as fierce as Bull
Garnet. All I mean is-you know the old saying-Quieta non
movere.'
“ The motto of fools and dastards. 'Have it out,' is an English-
man's rule. No sneaking tricks for me, sir. Oh, what a fool I am!
I beg your pardon with all my heart; you will make allowances for
Instead of being rude, I ought to be grateful for kindness
which would even compromise your honour.”
With these words, the youth stood up, and held out his hand to
the doctor.

“Crad, my dear boy,” exclaimed Mr. Hutton, with a big tear
twinkling in each little eye, “the finest thing I ever did was showing
you to the daylight. If I rob you of what has appeared your birth-
right, curse all memorandum-books, and even my metrostigmatic
treatise, which I fully meant to immortalize me.”
“And so I hope it may do. I am not so calm as I ought to be.

know you will allow for this; I beg you to allow for nothing else,
except a young fellow's delicacy. Give me your reasons, or not, as
you like. The matter will be for my father."
Cradock looked proud and beautiful. But the depth of his eyes
was troubled. He longed for John Rosedew's counsel, but he dared
not now to ask it. Young as he was, he knew that his father was
the first man who should hear of this; and that the question must
be dealt with legally and formally.
Therefore he did nothing either pitiable or scornful, but held up
his head, and looked down at Rufus, waiting for the elder man to
suggest the proper course.
Heigho! Very hot work !” said Dr. Hutton, puffing ; “summer
quite come back again! I vote that we adjourn, my boy."
For even Rufus Hutton, though of very large experience, could
not for the moment see exactly what might come of this.

CHAPTER XV.
A CLASSIC HORSEMAN.
On the morning of that same day, our Amy at her father's side,
in the pretty porch of the Rectory, uttered the following wisdom :
“ Darling Papples, Papelikidion-is there any other diminutivicle
half good enough for you, or stupid enough for me ?-my own father
(that's best of all), you must not ride Coræbus to-day.”
Amy amata, peramata a me, aim of my life, amicula, in the name
of sweet sense, why not?”
Because, pa, he has had ten great long carrots, and my best hat
full of new oats; and I know he will throw you off.”
Scrupulum injecisti. I shouldn't like to come off to-day. Ana
it rained the night before last.” So said the rector, proudly con-
templating a pair of new kerseymeres, which Channing the clerk
had made upon trial. Nevertheless, I think that I have read
enough on the subject to hold on by his mane, if he does not kick
out of all dialectics. And if he gives me time to reason—that horse
has a real taste for Greek—and, after all, the ground is soft."

"
No, dad, I don't think it is prudent. And you won't have me
there to advise you.”
My own pet, that is a serious point. And with all your know-
ledge of riding ! Why, my own seems quite theoretical by the
side of yours. And yet I have kept my seat under very trying
circumstances. You remember the time when Coræbus met the
trahea ?”
“ Yes, pa ; but he hadn't had any oats; and I was there to advise
you."
True, ny child, quite true. But I threw my equilibrium just as
a hunter does. And I think I could do it again. I bore in mind
what Xenophon says-
“Pa, here he is! And he does look so fat, I know he will be
restive."
“Prepare your Aunt Doxy's mind, my dear, not to indulge in vain
regrets, in case of the very worst-I mean, if the legs of my trousers
should want rubbing. How rash of me, to be sure, to have put
them on to-day! Prius dementat. I trust sincerely—and old
Channing is so proud of them, and he says the cut is so fashionable.
Nevertheless, I heard our Clayton, as he went down the gravel-walk,
dilating, with what he himself would have called 'colores orationis,'
upon Uncle John's new bags; Búlakol, I suppose he meant, as
opposed to åva&vpides. I was glad that the subject possessed so
lively an interest for him ; notwithstanding which, I was very glad
Mr. Channing did not hear him.”
“The impudence! Well, I am astonished. And to see the
things he brought back from Oxford-quince-coloured, with a stripe
that wide, like one of my fancy gourds. I'll be sure to have it out
with him. No, I can't, though; I forgot.” And Amy looked down
with a rosy smile at the delicacy of the subject. But I am quite
sure of one thing, pa : Mr. Cradock would never have done it.
Ræbus, don't kick up the gravel. Do you suppose we can roll every
day? Oh, you are so fat, you darling !"
“When the sides are deep,” said the rector, quoting from Xeno-
phon, and somewhat protuberant at the stomach, the horse is
generally more easy to ride. What a comfort, Amy! Stronger,
moreover, and more capable of enjoying food.”
“He has enjoyed a rare lot this morning. At least I hope you
have, you sweetest. Why, pa, I declare you are whistling !”
“ It also behoves a horseman to know that it is a time-honoured
precept to soothe the steed by whistling, and rouse him by a sharp
sound made between the tongue and the palate.”
“Oh, father, don't do that. Promise me now, dear, won't you ?"
“ I will promise you, my child, because I don't know how to do
it. I tried very hard last Wednesday, and only produced a guttural.
But I think I shall understand it, after six or seven visiting days.
At least, if the weather is favourable.”

“No, pa dear, I hope you won't. It would be so reckless of you;
and I know you will get a sore throat.”
“Sweet of my world, cor cordium, you have wrapped me with
three involucres tighter than any hazel-nut. They will all go into
my pocket the moment I am round the corner.”
No, daddy, you won't be so cruel. And after the rime this
morning! Ræbus will tell me if you do. Won't you now, my
pretty ?"
Coræbus was a handsome pony, but not a handsome doer. He
could go at a rare pace when he liked, but he did not often like it.
His wind was short, and so was his temper, and he looked at the
world unpleasantly. Perhaps he had been disappointed in love in
the tenderness of his youth. Nevertheless he had many good
points, and next to himself loved Amy. He would roll his black
eyes, put his nose to her lips, and almost leave oats to look at her.
His colour varied sensitively according to the season. In the
height of summer, a dappled bay ; towards the autumnal equinox,
a tendency to nuttiness; then a husky bristle of deepest brown
flaked with hairs of ginger; after the clips a fine mouse-colour,
with a spirited sense of nakedness, fierce whiskers, and a love of
buck jumps. Then, ere the blessed Christmas-tide, nature began
to blanket him with a nap the colour of black frost; and so through
the grizzle of spring he came round to his proper bay once more.
Amy declared she could tell every month by the special hue of
Coræbus; but, albeit she was the most truthful of girls, her heart
was many degrees too warm for her lips to be always at dew-
point.
Both in the stable and out of it, that pony had a bluff way
with
his heels, which none but himself thought humorous. He never
meant any harm, however-it was only his mode of expressing
himself; and he liked to make a point when he felt his new shoes
tingling. But as for kicking his Amy, he was not quite so low as
that. He would not even jump about, when she was on his back,
more than was just the proper thing to display her skill and figure.
“Oh, you sad Coræby," always brought him to sadness; and he
expected a pat from her little gloved hand, and cocked his tail with
dignity the moment he received it. Nevertheless, for her father,
the rector of the parish, he entertained, when the oats were
plentiful, nonconformist sentiments, verging almost upon scepti-
cism. He liked him indeed, as the whole world must; he even
admired his learning, and turned up his eyes at the Greek ;
but he was not impressed, as he should have been, by the
sacerdotal office. Fatal defect of all, he knew that the rector could
not ride.
John Rosedew was a reasoning man, and uncoinmonly strong in
the legs, but a great deal too philosophical to fit himself over a
horse well. He had written a treatise upon the Pelethronian

63
Lapiths (which he could never be brought to read before a learned
society), he knew all about the Olympics and Pythics, and Xeno-
phon gave him a text-book; but, for all that, he never put his feet
the right way into the stirrups.
“Look at him now !” said John, as the boy led the pony up and
down, while Amy was knotting the mufflers so that they never
might come undone again ; "how beautifully Xenophon describes
that very animal ! 'When the horse is excited to assume that
artificial air which he adopts when he is proud, he then delights in
riding, becomes magnificent, terrific, and attracts attention !' And
again, persons beholding such a horse pronounce him generous,
free in his motions, fit for military exercise, high-mettled, haughty,
and both pleasant and terrible to look on.' Pleasant, I suppose,
for other people, and terrible for the rider. But why our author
insists so much upon the horse being taught to rear gracefully,' I
am not horseman enough as yet to understand. It has always
appeared to me that Coræbus rears too much already. And then the
direction—' but if after riding, and copious perspiration, and when
he has reared gracefully, he be relieved immediately both of the
rider and reins, there is little doubt that he will spontaneously
advance to rear when necessary.' What does that mean, among
modern horses? I never find it necessary, except, indeed, when the
little girls jump up and pull my coat-tails, in their inquisition for
apples; and then I am always afraid that they may suffer some
detriment. But let us not overtask his patience; here he comes
again. James, my boy, lead him up to the chair.”
Any jam in your pocket, father?”
No, my child, not any. Your excellent Aunt Eudoxia has it all
under lock and key. Now I will mount according to Xenophon,
though I do not find that he any where prescribes a Windsor
chair. When he has well prepared himself for the ascent, let him
support his body with his left hand, and stretching forth his right
hand let him leap on horseback, and when he mounts thus he will
not present an uncomely spectacle to those behind. There, I am
up, most accurately; excellent horse, and great writer! And now
for the next direction : 'We do not approve of the same bearing a
man has in a carriage, but that an upright posture be observed,
with the legs apart.'
" How could they be otherwise, pa, when the horse is there
between them ?"
“Your criticisms are rash, my child. Jem, how dare you laugh,
sir? I will buy a pair of spurs, I declare, the next time I go to
Ringwood. Good-bye, darling ; Aunt Doxy will take you up to the
park, when the sun comes out, to see all the wonderful doings. I
shall be home in time to dress for the dinner at the Hall.”
Sweet Amy kissed her hand, and curtseyed-as she loved to do
to her father; and, after two or three wayward sallies (repressed by

Jem with the gardening broom), Coræbus pricked his little ears, and
shook himself into a fair jog-trot. So with his elbows well stuck
out, and shaking merrily to and fro, his right hand ready to grasp
the pommel in case of consternation, and one leg projected beyond
the other, after the manner of a fowl's side-bone, away rode John
Rosedew in excellent spirits, to begin his Wednesday parochial
tour.
Being duly victualled, and thoroughly found, for a voyage of
long duration and considerable hazard, the good ship" John
Rosedew” set sail every Wednesday for commeice with the neigh-
bourhood. This expedition was partly social, partly ministerial, in
some degree parochial; but from first to last, universal. There
was no bombardment of dissenters, no firing of red-hot shot at
Papists, no up with the helm and run him down, if any man
launched on the mare magnum, or any frail vessel missed stays.
And yet there was no compromise, no grand circle sailing, no
luffing to a trade-wind; straight was the course, and the chart most
clear, and the good ship bound, with favour of God, to a haven for
the desolate.
The sun came out and touched the trees with every kind of
gilding, as the rector having fulfilled the village, and learned every
gammer's alloverishness, and every gaffer's rheumatics, drew the
snaffle upon Coræbus longside of Job Smith's pigsty, and plunged
southward into the country. Above him every tree was leaning
forth its green with yellowness; even proud of the novelty, like a
child who has lost his grandmother. And though he could not see
very far, he wondered at a little thing which he had never observed
before.
It was that while the other trees took their autumn evenly, the
elin was brushed with a flaw of gold while the rest of the tree was
verdure. A single branch would stand forth from the others,
mellow against their freshness, like a harvest-sheaf set up perhaps
on the foreground of a grass-plot.
Mr. Rosedew saw not clearly any of these little things, having no
such little gift; but for all that they entered into and composed his
sauntering mind.
Then soothing his pony with novel sounds, emnulous of eque 3-
trianism, he struck into a moorland track leading to distant
cottages. Thence he would bear to the eastward, arrive at his
hostel by one o'clock, visit the woodmen, and home through the
forest, with the evening shadows falling.

CHAPTER XVI.
A DELICATE INQUIRY,
BESIDE the embowered stream that forms the eastern verge of the
chase, young Cradock Nowell sat and gazed, every now and then,
into the water. Through a break in the trees beyond it, he could
see one chimney-top and a streak of the thatch of the Rectory. In
vain he hoped that Dr. Hutton would leave him to himself; for he
did not wish to go into the proofs, but to think out some of the
consequences. Some bitterness, no doubt, there was in the corner
of his heart, when he thought of all that Clayton' now had to offer
Amy Rosedew. He had lately been told, as a mighty secret, a
thing which grieved and angered him ; and the more, that he must
not speak of it, as his straightforward nature urged him.
The secret was that innocent Amy met his brother Clayton, more
than once, in the dusk of the forest, and met him by appointment.
It grieved poor Cradock, because he loved Amy with all his un-
changeable heart; it angered him, because he thought it very mean
of Clayton to take advantage of one so young and ignorant of the
world. But never until the present moment, as he looked at the
homely thatch in the distance, and the thin smoke curling over it,
had it occurred to his honest mind, that his brother might not be
like himself-that Clayton might play with the maiden.
And now for the moment it seemed more likely, as he glanced
back at the lordly house, commanding the country for miles around,
the country its fief and the people its serfs, and now the whole
destined for Clayton. He thought of the meanness about the Ire-
land, and two or three other little things, proofs of a little nature.
Then he gazed at the Rectory thatch again, and the smoke from the
kitchen chimney, and seemed to see pure playful Amy making
something nice for her father.
“Good God ! I would shoot him if he did ; or strike him dead
into this water.”
In the hot haste of youth he had spoken aloud, with his fist
gathered up, and his eyes flashing fire. Rufus Hutton saw and
heard him, and thought of it many times after that day.
“Oh, you are thinking of Caldo, because he snapped at me.
There are no signs of hydrophobia. You must not think of shooting
hiin.”
“I was not thinking of Caldo. I hope I did not mean it. God
knows, I am very wicked.”
So we are all, my boy. I should like to see a fellow that
wasn't. I'd pay fifty pounds for his body, and dissect him into an
angel."
Cradock Nowell smiled a little at such a reward for excel-

lence, and then renewed his gaze of dreary bewilderment at the
water.
Now let me show you my tracings, Cradock, for which I have
ridden straight hoine and back. There now ! And after all my
trouble you won't even deign to glance at them! You have made
up your mind to abdicate upon my ipse dixi. Now look at the
bend sinister, that is yours; the bend dexter is for the elder
brother."
“ Dr. Hutton, it may be, and is, very likely, quite false shame on
my part; but I wish to hear nothing about it. Perhaps, if my
mother were living, I might not have been so particular. But
giving, as she did, her life for ours, I cannot regard it medically.
The question is now for my father. I will not enter into it.”
“Oh the subjectiveness of the age !” said Rufus Hutton, rising,
then walking to and fro on the bank, as he held discourse with him-
self; “here is a youth who ought to be proud, although at the cost
of his inheritance, of illustrating, in the most remarkable manner,
indeed I may say of originating, my metrostigmatic theory. He
carries upon the cervical column a clear impression of grapes, and
they say that before the show at Romsey Sir Cradock's gardener
was very cross about his choice Black Hamburgs. The twin-
brother carries the very same impress, but with the direction
inverted—dexter in fact, and dexter was the mark of the elder
That I can prove by this tracing I made, not with any view to
this sort of thing, but from the interest I felt, at an early stage of
my experience, in a question then under controversy.
this, what happens ? Why, that he loses every thing--the import-
ance, the house, the lands, the title ; and becomes the laughing-
stock of the county as the sham Sir Cradock. What ought he to
do at once, then ? Why, perhaps to toss me into that hole, where
I should never get out again. By Gad, I am rash to trust myself
with him, and no other soul in the secret !”. Here Dr. Hutton
shuddered to think how little water it would take to drown him, and
the river so dark and so taciturn! At any rate, he ought to fall upon
me with forceps, and probe, and scalpel, and tear my evidence to
atoms. For, after all, what is it, without corroboration ? But
instead of that, he only says, ' Dr. Hutton, no more of this, if you
please, no more of this ! The question is now for my father.' And
he must know well enough to which side his father will lean in the
inquiry. Confound the boy! If he had only coaxed me with those
kind eyes, I would have kept all snug till Doomsday.. Oh what
will my Rosa say to me? She has always loved this boy, and
admired him so immensely.”
Perhaps it was his pretty young wife's high approval of Cradock
which first had made the testy Rufus a partisan of Clayton. The
cause of his having settled at “ Geopharmacy Lodge” was, that upon
his return from India he fell in love with a Hampshire maiden,
son.

whom he met “above bar” at Southampton. How he contrived to
get introduced to her, he alone can tell; but he was a most perse-
vering fellow, and little hampered with diffidence. She proved to
be the eldest daughter of Sir Cradock's largest tenant, a man of
good standing and education, who lived near Fordingbridge. As
Rufus had brought home tidy pickings from his appointment in
India, the only thing he had to do was to secure the lady's heart.
And this he was not long about, for many ladies like high colour
even more than hairiness. First she laughed at his dancing ways,
incessant mobility, and sharp eyes; but very soon she began to like
him, and now she thought him a wonderful man. This opinion
(with proper change of gender) was heartily reciprocated, and the
result was that a happier couple never yet made fools of themselves,
in the judgment of the world ; never yet enjoyed themselves, in the
sterling wisdom of home. They suited each other admirably in
their very differences; they laughed at each other, and themselves,
and any one else who laughed at them.
“Well, I shall be off,” said Dr. Hutton at last, in feigned disgust;
"you will stare at the water all day, Mr. Cradock, and take no
notice of me.”
“I beg your pardon, I forgot myself; I did not mean to be rude,
I assure you."
“ I know you did not. I know you could never be rude, if you
tried it, to any body. Good-bye, I have business on hand.”
“You will be back, Dr. Hutton, when my father returns from his
ride ? It is very foolish of me, but I cannot bear this suspense.”
“ Trust me. I will see to it. But he will not be back, they tell
me, till nearly four o'clock."
“Oh, what a time to wait! Don't send for me if you can help it.
But, if he wants me, I will come.”
“Good-bye, my lad. Keep your pecker up. There are hundreds
of men in the world with harder lines than yours.”
“ I should rather think so. I only wish there were not.”
Cradock attempted a lively smile, and executed a pleasant one, as
Rufus Hutton shook his hand, and set off upon his business. And
his business was to ride at once as far as the “ Jolly Foresters," that
lonely inn on the Beaulieu-road, at the eastern end of the parish,
whereat John Rosedew baited Coræbus at the turn of the pastoral
tour. The little doctor knew well enough, though he seldom passed
that way, how the smart Miss Penny of former days, Mrs.
O’Gaghan's assistant, was now the important Mrs. George Cripps,
hostess of the “Jolly Foresters," where the four roads met.
Meanwhile, the scaffolds went on merrily under Mr. Garnet's
care, and so did the awnings, marquees, &c., and the tiers of seats
for the ladies. The lamps in the old oak being fixed, the boughs
were manned, like a frigate's yards, with dexterous fellows hoisting
flags, devices, and transparencies, all prepared to express in fire the

morrow.
mighty name of Cradock. All the men must finish that night, lest
any one lose his legitimate chance of being ancestrally drunk on the
Cradock Nowell, wandering about, could not bear to go
near them. Those two hours seemed longer to him than any year
of his previous life. He went and told Caldo all about it; and that
helped him on a little.
Caldo was a noble setter, pure of breed, and high of soul, and
heavily feathered on legs and tail. His colour was such a lily
white, that you grieved for him on a wet fallow; and the bright red
spots he was endowed with were like the cheeks of Helen. Deli-
cate carmine, enriched with scarlet, mapped his back with islands ;
and the pink of his cheeks, where the whiskers grew, made all the
young ladies kiss him. His nostrils were black as a double-lined
tunnel leading into a pencil-mine ; and his gums were starred with
violet, and his teeth as white as new mushrooms. In all the county
of Hants there was no dog to compare with him ; for he came of a
glorious strain, made perfect at Kingston, in Berkshire. Lift but a
finger, and down he went, in the height of his hottest excitement ;
wave the finger, and off he dashed, his great eyes looking back for
repression. For style of ranging, all dogs were rats to him, any
where in the New Forest; so freely he went, so buoyant, so careful,
and yet so grandly hilarious. Only one fault he had, and there
never was dog without one-he was jealous to the backbone.
Cradock was dreadfully proud of him. Any thing else he had in
the world he wouid have given to Clayton, but he could not quite
give Caldo ; even if Clayton had begged, instead of backing his
Wena against him. Wena was a very nice creature, anxious to
please, and conscientious; but of a different order entirely from the
high-minded Caldo. Any man who loveth dogs, both great and
small, will understand the difference between them.
Cradock now leaned over Caldo, with a brightness in his eyes,
and gently feeling the soft puckers and velvet veining of his ears,
looked straight into his heart, and begged to tell him something
sorrowful. In a single glance the dog perceived that something had
gone much amiss, and his great brown eyes were filled with sorrow,
rather than mere sympathy. The feathery tail which had been
wagging like a screw-propeller, ceased its sprightly to-and-fro, and
sank into a level state of quivering disquietude. Then through the
gaze of soft inquiry the flash of a fine idea broke; for the dog was
saying to himself,“ Surely now I may be of use; when men are in
their little troubles, the experience of a well-trained setter is not to
be sneezed at.” With this impulse he just offered the smallest
corner of his tongue, not enough to wet a lip, and drawn back ere
ever there was the smallest chance of having tasted it. Then re-
ceiving no repulse, what did he do but present a paw, diffidently,
and drawing back the callousparts for fear of hurting. His master
accepted this pretty foot, and stroked it, and put it to his lips.

In the thick of this dialogue Cradock was sent for hastily. Old
Hogstaff trotted across the yard (whereon he seldom ventured) to
say that Sir Cradock Nowell was waiting to see his son. The
young man walking all amort, yet with all his heart in his mouth,
wondered at the penny-wort, the wall-rue, and the snap-dragons,
which he had never observed before. Hogstaff tottered along before
him, picking uneasily over the stones, bbing his chin, and mut-
tering.
Sir Cradock sat in the long heavy room known as the “justice-
hall,” where he and his brother magistrates held oyer of many a
culprit. The great oak table was dabbed with ink, and the grey
walls with mop-shaped blotches, where sullen prisoners had thrown
their heads back, and refused to answer. At the lower end was
Rufus Hutton, jerky, dogmatical, keenly important; while the
baronet sat at the head of the table, with his back to the pointed
window, and looked (perhaps from local usage) more like a magis-
trate than a father.
Straight up the long room Cradock walked, as calmly as if he
were following the pitch of his quoit for measurement. Then he
saluted his father, according to the custom; for many bygone
fashions were retained in the ancient family.
Sir Cradock was proud of his son's self-command and dignified
manly carriage, and if Dr. Hutton had not been there, he would
have arisen to comfort him. As it was, he only said, with a faint
and doubtful smile,
“ Cradock, my boy, I would have gladly spared you this, and
might have done so, but for the most unlucky moment at which it
has been thrust upon us.”
"I thank you, father,” said Cradock Nowell; “ but if you please
just to settle it-
“ It cannot be settled quite so shortly as you naturally wish. You
have a right to be represented by a proper man of law. I have sent
for Mr. Brockwood, but they could not find him. Would you like
us to wait until he comes? Even Clayton cannot be found.”
“ No, sir, I want no lawyers whatever. I only want your judg-
ment and the whole thing settled speedily.”
“What a fool!” said Dr. Hutton to himself unguardedly;
and Sir Cradock's stern eyes were upon him ere he could begin
again.
“I am glad and proud, my boy, to find-although of course I
expected it-that you are so true a gentleman. It was my place to
offer you the advantage of legal advice; and it was your place, as a
gentleman, to decline the offer."
“Father, I never thought of my place; I thought of you and
Clayton."
Sir Cradock looked at Rufus Hutton, with the gentle moisture of
a father's pride enriching him; and then he turned to his son to sec

from habit of the bench perhaps, whether all he said was felt, or
only meant for acting.
“Do you doubt me, my dear father? Am I guilty of this mis-
take?”
"My dear boy," cried Rufus Hutton, always apt to be familiar,
and now in the agony of long silence; “ if you made a mistake, you
may plead the glorious plea of infancy."
Cradock," said his father strongly, "you are taking this great
trouble, for your time of life, so well, that I am very proud of you. If
your dear mother had been alive-but what has that to do with it?"
Exactly this—that there never could have been such a stupid
error.”
So said Rufus Hutton; and Sir Cradock answered haughtily,-
“Unless my memory is at fault, you were present, Dr. Hutton,
throughout this stupid error.”
“I!” cried the doctor; nay, good sir, I sailed for India even
before it arose.”
“We shall see. Now, Cradock, do you really wish to go through
this without any legal advice, or even time for consideration?”
“Father, how many times must I say it? You are my lawyer. I
leave it to you."
“Then more fool you !" Dr. Hutton muttered, as he took a high
chair to see it out.
But Sir Cradock Nowell looked as if his whole experience failed
him, after years of justiceship, when the justice was to be dealt home
in his own family. True it was that Clayton had for years been
growing into favour, while the other was growing out; but the
father would have been surprised and vexed to hear of it. And
now, though love of Clayton lay the deeper in his heart perhaps, he
could not help some pity for the nobler son before him.
“My good sirs, we must look sharp," cried Rufus Hutton merrily;
“ do you know what o'clock it is? Four, seven, and three-quarters,
as that wonderful Garnet would say. There will be no time to
change the names. You must have the matter out, Sir Cradock.
Will allow me to take it in hand?"
“I am glad that Clayton is not here," Sir Cradock said, more to
himself than them ; " I could not have borne to be looking at both.
But both shall have fair play, poor lads! It is an irregular pro-
ceeding; but there is no adjourning it."
Oh, father, do let us have it all out."
" Sir Cradock, you must go through with it.”.
My boy, so be it. But I rather think-although of course you
have a right to be here"
To be sure. I forgot about that. I had better be out
of the way, of course. Thank you, father, for thinking of me.

With these words he saluted his father and Dr. Hutton stead.

man. Then he marched down the long room placidly, and whistled
his way to the main front-door, passing through which he set off at
full speed for some of his brother's especial haunts. Failing to find
him, he had a great mind to rush into the Rectory, but denied him-
self that pleasure, and turned, with a heavy but throbbing heart,
into his own little sanctuary.
CHAPTER XVII.
UNREASONABLE ACCURACY.
BIDDY O’GAGHAN was hard at work, boiling down herbs and
blessing them, drying and bottling cleverly, scraping, and picking
the cloves out. She had turned the still-room of the house into her
private laboratory; and she saved all the parish and half of the
hundred from "them pisoners, as call theirselves doctors.” Now, she
was one of those excellent women, kindly provided by nature with
power to combine their missions, who work all the better for talking;
and, between her sniffs at the saucepan-lids, and elegant tests on
the drying-pans, she had learned that something strange was up, and
had made fifty guesses about it. Blowing the scum and the pearly
beads from a pot of pellitory of the wall (one of her staunch
panaceas), she received a command most peremptory to present
herself in the justice-room.
“ Thin was that the way as they said it, Dick? No sinse nor
manners no more nor that! An' every bit of the blessed while they
knowed it for my bilin’-day! Muckstraw, thin, is Bridget O'Gaghan
no more count than a pisonin' doctor?' Hould that handle there,
Dick. If iver you stirs it the bridth of one on your carroty whiskers
from that smut on the firebar, till such time as you sees me agin, i'l!
down with it arl in your crooked back bilin', and your chilthers
shall disinherit it."
Leaving Dick rooted in abject dread of the spells now well
established, she hurried into her little bedroom; for she had the
strongest sense of propriety, and would not “make herself com-
Then she dashed her apron aside, and softened the fire-
glow from her nose, and smoothed the creases of her jet-black hair,
which curled in bars like crochet-work. This last she did with
some gummy material of her own invention, applying it with the
ball of her thumb. “The hairs of me head," as she always called
them, were thick of substance and strong of fibre, and went zig-zag
on their road to her ears, like a billow struck by a cross-flaw of
mon.

wind. After this final polish, she cast a comprehensive glance at
her looking-glass, just to know if she were all right; the glass gave
her back a fine, warm-hearted face, still young in its rapid expres-
sion, Irish in every line of it, glazed with lies for hatred, and beaming
with truth for love. So Biddy gave two or three nods thereat, and
knew herself match for fifty examiners, if she could only keep her
temper.
As she marched up to the table, with her head thrown back, her
portly shape made the most of, and the front of her strong arms
glistening, then dropped a crisp curtsey to Sir Cradock without
deigning to notice his visitor, the little doctor's experience told him
that he had caught a thorough Tartar. All his solemn preparations
were thrown away upon her, though the biggest Testament in the
house lay on the table before him; and a most impressive desk was
covered with pens, and paper, and sealing-wax.
Dr. Hutton would not yet open his mouth, because he wished to
begin augustly. Meanwhile, Sir Cradock kept waiting for him, till
Biddy could wait no longer. Turning her broad back full upon
Rufus, who appreciated the compliment, she made another short
scrape to her master, and asked, with an ogle suppressed to a
mince,-
And what wud your honour be pleased to want with the poor
widow, Bridget O'Gaghan, then?”
“Bridget, that gentleman, Dr. Hutton, has made an extremely
important discovery, affecting most nearly my honour and that of
the family. And now I rely upon you, Bridget, as a faithful and
valued dependent of ours, to answer, without reservation or attempt
at equivocation, all the questions he may put to you."
Quistions, your honour?” and Biddy looked stupid in the
cleverest way imaginable.
“Yes, questions, Bridget O’Gaghan," cried Rufus; “inquiries,
interrogations—ah! that quite explains what I mean.”
“Is it axing any harm, thin, any ondacency of a poor lone wid-
der woman, as yer honour wud allow of, at me taime of life?” She
took to her brogue as a tower of refuge. Bilingual races are up to
the tactics of rats with a double hole.
“Sir Cradock Nowell,” said Rufus, from the bottom of his chest,
you, I believe, are a magistrate for this county of Hants, Vice-
Lieutenant, Colonel of Yeomanry, the representative of the sove-
reign. I call upon you now, in all these capacities, to administer
the oath to this prevaricating woman.”
The penultimate word rather terrified Bridget, for she never had
heard it before ; but the last word of all reassured her.
She turned round suddenly on little Rufus, who had jumped froin
his chair in excitement, and standing by head and shoulders above
him, she opened her great eyes down upon him, like the port-holes
of a frigate.

“Faix, thin, and I niver seen this young man at all at all. It's
between the airms of the cheer he were, and me niver to look so low
for him! 'Tis the black measles as he've tuk, and I've seen as bad
a case brought through with. The luck o' the blessed saints in
glory! I've been bilin' up for the same. If it's narse him I can to
the toorn of it, I'm intirely at your sairvice, Sir Craduck. I likes
to narse a base little chap, sin' there's no call to fear for his
beauty."
This last was uttered gently, and quite as a private reflection ;
but it told more than all the rest. For ever since Dr. Hutton had
married a woman half his age, he had grown exceedingly sensitive
as to his personal appearance. By a very great effort he kept silent,
but his face was almost black with wrath, as he handed the great
book to Sir Cradock. The magistrate presented it very solemnly to
Bridget, who took it as patly as if it had been a flat iron. A score
of times she had sworn according to what was thought good for her,
years ago, in Ireland. At the right moment of dictation, she gave
the book a loud smack that proved the solidity of the binding, and
then crossed herself very devoutly, to take the taste away. Of a
heretic oath she had little fear, though she would not have told a
big lie to her priest. Then she dropped her eyes, and chastened
her aspect, as if overcome by the sense of solemn responsibility..
Bridget O'Geoghegan," began the worthy doctor, emphasizing
slowly every syllable of her name, and prepared to write down her
replies, "you are now upon your solemn oath, to declare the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And if you fail in this,
remember, you will place your precious soul in the power of the
evil one.”
“Amin to that same, thin. And more power to yer.”
Bridget, do you remember the night when your master's chil-
dren were born ?"
“Sure an' I do, thin. Unless it wur the mornin', how wud I
help remimber it ?"
“And do you remember the medical gentleman who was suddenly
called in ?"
“ And if I wur ten times on my oath, I don't remimber no gin-
tleman. A bit of a red-haired gossoon there was, as wor on the
way to be transported.”
“Do you remember his name?”
“Remimber it? Let me see, thin. It wor hardly worth the
throuble of forgittin Button, or Mutton ; no, faix I b’lieve it wor
Rubus Rotten."
“Well, never mind his name

Silence, woman, or else be civil,” Sir Cradock exclaimed, with
all the authority which a widower dare exhibit to his own domestics.
“And I thought it was arl the truth as yer honour said I was to
tell.” Here Biddy looked hurt and amazed. “ Have the little clerk
got it all in black and white ?” With a sigh for his incapacity, she
peered over the desk at his paper.
“Now, Mrs. O'Gaghan, no trifling !" Her master spoke sternly
and sharply. But-Rufus could not speak at all by reason of chok-
ing passion.
“ If so be I have said any harm, sir, for the best of us is errow-
neous, I axes a humble pardon. Iver since I lose my good husband
-and a better husband there cudn't be, barrin only the bellises,

“Mrs. O'Gaghan,” said Dr. Hutton, trying very hard to look
amiable, “ do your best for once, I entreat you, to prove yourself, if
there is such a thing, a respectable Irishwoman.”
From that moment the tables were turned. Her temper boiled
up like a cauldron. It is quite of a piece with a thing that is all
pieces—the genuine Irish nature-that, proud as they are of their
country, they cannot bear to be told of their citizenship.
“Irish, thin, is it? Irish indade! Well, and I knows I'm Irish.
And if I ain't, what do I care who knows I am ?”
She flung up her head superbly, and great tears ran from her
eyes. Rufus Hutton perceived his advantage, and, though not at
all a mean fellow, he was smarting far too sharply from the many
attacks on his vanity, to forego his sweet revenge.
“You remember, then, when the doctor gave you the first-born
child, that he made some odd remark, and told you to keep it sepa-
rate?”
“And how can a poor Irishwoman remimber any thing at all ?”
Come, you know very well that you remember that. Now, can
you deny it?"
“ Is it likely you'll catch me deny any thing as is a lie, then, Irish
or not, as you plases ?” Her bosom still was heaving with the
ground-swell of the bygone storm.

UNREASONABLE ACCURACY.

“Thim very same words as you've said.” She turned towards
the door with a sullen air, while he looked at Sir Cradock in triumph.
Nevertheless, he still wanted her evidence as to her own doings in
the matter.
Before he rode home for his own tracings, he had walked, with his
usual promptitude, as far as the “Jolly Foresters," and there had
discovered the late Miss Penny ; who now, as the mother of nine or
ten children, was kindly expansive and garrulous concerning all
questions of infancy.
“So then, Mrs. O'Gaghan, with the best intentions in the world,
you inarked the elder child with a rosette, as I saw on the following
day.”
“Thrue for you as the Gospel. And what more wud you have
me do ?”
“Nothing Unless it were just to stitch it, instead of crimping
it into the cap."
Poor Biddy started from where she stood, and pressed one hand
to her heart." It's the divil himself,” she muttered, “as turns me
inside out so. And sure that same is the reason he does be so black
red.” Then aloud, with a final rally,–
“And who say they iver see me take a needle and thread? And
if I did, what odds to them ?”
“No, that was the very thing you omitted to do, until it was too
late. But when you sent to Mrs. Toaster for her large butter-scales,
what was it you put on each side ?"
“What was it? No lining at all. Fair play for the both of
them, as I hope to have the same in purgatory, plaze the saints and
our blessed Lady !"
Sir Cradock was listening, all this while, with some surprise and
more interest. He now found it right to say something, for fear of
being too much conducted.
“And, pray, what was the reason that you wanted to weigh them
at all? You know it is thought most unlucky, by every orthodox
nurse, even to allow a babe to be weighed.”
“With the hairyticks, not with us, yer honour. Why else wud I
weigh them, except to see which wur the heaviest ?”
“And pray, Bridget, which was the heavier ?" asked Sir Cradock,
almost smiling
“Mr. Cradock, as is now, yer honour. I'd swear it on my dying
bed. Did you think, then, i'd iver wrong him, the innocents as
they was?"
And did you weigh them with rosettes on?” Rufus Hutton had
not finished yet.
How cud I, and only one got it?"
Oh, then, you had fastened it on again ?”
Did
you think they was born with ribbons on?”
This was poor Biddy's last bit of spirit. She lost heart and opened

it out after this. How she had heard that there was some difference
in the marks of the infants, though what it was she knew not justly ;
having, like most Irishwomen, the clearest perception that right and
left are only relative terms, and come wrong in the looking-glass, as
they do in heraldry. How, when she found the rosette adrift, she
had done the very best she could, according to her lights, to work
even-handed justice, and up to this very day believed that the heft
of the scales was the true one. Then she fell to a-crying bitterly that
her darling Crad should be ousted, and then she laughed as heartily
that her dear boy Clayton was in for it.
Now Dr. Hutton, well content with what he had established,
turned and gazed at Sir Cradock Nowell, with that fine complacent
manner which so often is acquired by successful little men. Then,
to make assurance doubly sure, he called in a voice of authority
for Mrs. Jane Cripps, of the “Foresters.”. Mrs. Cripps came sidling
and bridling, even now unable to lay aside that awe with which she
had been wont, in the days when she was Jane Penny, to regard the
great Mrs. O'Gaghan. However, she told all she knew of the matter,
saying “ please, sir,” at every sentence. She had seen at the time
Dr. Hutton's sketch, which was made without Biddy's knowledge,
because she never would have allowed it, on account of the bad
luck to follow. And Mrs. Cripps was very clever now every thing
was known. She had felt all along that things went queerly on the
third day after the babes were born. She had made up her mind
to speak at the time, only Mrs. O'Gaghan was such-excuse her-
such a disciplinarian, that-that-and then Lady Nowell died, and
every thing was at sixes and sevens, and no one cried more violent,
let them say what they like about it, than she, Jane Penny as had
been.
"If Sir Cradock thought further evidence needful, there was Mrs.
Bowyer, a most respectable woman, who washed thirty shillings a
week, Mrs. Cripps' first cousin and comate, who had heard at the
time all about the drawing, and had not been easy about the scales,
and had dreamed of it many times afterwards, as indeed her Aunt
Betsy know; and her husband was no man, or he never would have
said to her
By this time the shadows came over the room, and the trees out-
side were rustling, and drawing rough lines on the amber sunset,
like a child's scrawling on his horn-book. Volunteers throughout
the household longed to give their evidence. Their self-respect for
a week would be hostile, if it were not accepted. But Sir Cradock
kept the door fastened, till Mrs. O'Gaghan slipped out, and put all
the wenches down the steps backwards. Mrs. Toaster alone she
durst not touch ; but Mrs. Toaster will never forgive her, and never
believe the case tried on its merits, because she was not summoned
to depose to the loan of the scales.
But now Sir Cradock Nowell saw that quite enough had been

established on this first inquiry to make it needful that the matter
should be sifted thoroughly, in proper legal form, and under conduct
of the men of law.
“I wish most heartily, Dr. Hutton, that you had made this strange
discovery either a week or two earlier, or else but two days later.
It is the most awkward time in the world to have such a question
thrust upon one.”
He spoke with some impatience, feeling strongly his annoying
and almost ludicrous position. But as he leaned his head on his
hands to consider how to meet the case, his conscience told him that
he had often wished for what was come to pass, but without this
inconvenience.
Still, a father who has made his children his chief study, and has
no other tie or care to wrest away his love from them, this man
cannot but be sorry when a sudden grief befalls even the less
favoured members of his little flock. A great annount of love is
always going from him, and coming home; and some of it lingers
wherever wanted to assuage especial wounds. And if there be but
two for all the father's love to dwell upon, nature will not often leave
him so wrapt up in one as not to feel for the other also. And so the
old man thought of both his sons, and felt his heart go yearning, to
its own surprise almost, over the one he less had loved, until the
call arose for it.
CHAPTER XVIII.
INVASION OF A WOODCOCK.
The rays of the level sun were nestling in the brown bosom of the
beech-clump, and the fugitive light slid undulating through the grey-
arched portico, like a reedy river; when Cradock and Clayton
Nowell met in the old hall of their childhood. With its deep em-
brasures and fluted piers, high-corniced mantel of oak relieved
with alabaster figures, and the stern array of pike, and steel-cap,
battle-axe, and arquebus, which kept the stag-heads over against
them nodding in perpetual fear, this old hall was so impressed upon
their earliest memories, that they looked upon it, in some sort, as
the entrance to their lives.
Clayton had just received the news of Dr. Hutton's discovery, and
his first impulse had been to rush, not to his father, or any one
else, but in search of his twin-brother. This proves him to have
been at heart a really good fellow.
As the twins drew near from opposite doors, each hung back for

a moment : knowing all that had passed that day, how would his
brother receive him? But in that moment each perceived how the
other's heart was ; Cradock cried, “Hurrah, all right !” and Clay-
ton's arms were round his neck. Clayton sobbed hysterically-for
he had always been woman-hearted—while Cradock coaxed him
with his hand, as though ten years the elder. It was as if the days
of childhood had returned once more, the days when the world came
not between them, for each was the world to the other.
“ Crad, I won't have a bit of it. Did you think I would be such
a robber, Crad? And I don't believe one syllable of their hum-
bugging nursery stories. Why, every fellow knows that you must
be the eldest brother.”
“ Viley, my boy, I am so glad that it has turned out so. You
know that I have always longed to fight my way in the world, and
I am fitter for it than you are. And you are more the fellow for a
baronet, and a big house, and all that sort of thing; and in the
holidays I shall come every year to shoot with you, and to break
your dogs, and all that; for you haven't got the least idea, Viley, of
breaking a dog."
“Well, no, I suppose I haven't,” said Clayton, very submissively;
at any other time he would have said, “Oh, haven't I ?” for it was
a moot point between them. “But, Craddy, you shall have half, at
any rate. I won't touch it, unless you take half.”
Then the estates must go to the Queen, or to Mr. Nowell Cor-
klemore, your especial friend, Viley."
Clayton was famed for his mimicry of the pompous Mr. Corkle-
more, and he could not resist it now, though the tears were still in
“Haw, yes; I estimate so, sir. A mutually agreeable and unob-
jectionable arrangement, sir. Is that your opinion ? Haw!" and
Clayton stroked an imaginary beard, and closed one eye at the
ceiling. Cradock laughed from habit; and Clayton laughed because
Cradock did.
Oh that somebody had come by to see them thus on the very best
terms, as loving as when they whipped tops together, or practised
Sir Roger de Coverley! They agreed to slip away that evening
from the noise of the guests and the wine-bibbing, and have a quiet
jug of ale in Cradock's little snuggery. There they would smoke
their pipes together, and consider the laws of inheritance. Alieady
they were beginning to laugh and joke about the matter ; what odds
about the change of position, if they only kept the brotherhood ?
Unluckily, no one came near them. The servants were gathered in
their own hall, discussing the great discovery ; Sir Cradock was gone
to the Rectory to meet John Rosedew upon his return, and counsel
how to manage things. Even the ubiquitous Dr. Hutton had his
especial alibi. He had rushed away to catch Mr. Garnet and the
illumination folk, that the necessary changes might be made in the
bedizenment of the oak-tree.

These young fellows being of the thorough English breeding, and
the high manhood which despises all display of emotion, cut short
all their most unusual outbreak of affection. They looked with some
shyness at one another, eager to catch the first bit of slang that
might relieve the position.
Suddenly Clayton exclaimed, “Oh, what a fool I am, Craddy!
I forgot the most important thing, until it is nearly too late for it."
“What?” asked Cradock, red hot for great news, which he saw
was coming.
“When I was out with the governor to-day, what do you think
I saw?"
“What, what, my boy? Out with it."
“Can't stop to make you guess. A woodcock, sir; a woodcock.”
" A woodcock so early? Nonsense, man; it must have been a
hawk or a night-jar.”
“Think I don't know a woodcock yet ? And I'll tell you who
saw it, too. Glorious old Mark Stote ; his eyes are as sharp as
ever. We marked hiin down to a T, sir, just beyond the hoar-
witheys at the head of Coffin Wood; and I should have been after
him two hours ago if it had not been for this rumpus. I meant to
have had such a laugh at you, for I would not have told you a word
of it; but now you shall go snacks in him. Even the governor
does not know it."
Fancy killing a woodcock in the first week of October !” said
Cradock, with equal excitement; "why, they'll put us in the paper,
Viley."
“ Not unless you look sharp. He's sure to be off at dusk. He's
a traveller, as Mark Stote said : sailed on from the Wight, most
likely, last night ; he'll be off for Dorset, this evening. Run for
your gun, Crad, your pet Purday; I'll meet you here with my
Lancaster in just two minutes' time. Don't say a word to a soul.
Mind, we'll go quite alone."
“Yes; but you bring your little Wena, and I'll take my Caldo,
and work him as close as possible. I promised him a run this
afternoon."
Away they ran, out of different doors, to get their guns and
accoutre themselves; while the poor tired woodcock sitting on one
leg, under a holly bush, was drawing up the thin quivering coverlet
over his great black eyes.
Cradock came back to the main hall first, with his gun on his
arm, and his shot-belt across him, his broad chest shown by the
shooting-jacket, and the light of hope and enterprise in his clear
strong glance. Before you could have counted ten, Clayton was
there to meet him; and none but a very ill-natured man could have
helped admiring the pair of them : honest, affectionate, simple
fellows, true West Saxons as could be seen, of the same height and
figure as nearly as could be, each with the pure bright Nowell com-
plexion, and the straightforward Nowell gaze.
The wide forehead,

pointed chin, arched eyebrows, and delicate mouth of each boy
resembled the other's exactly, as two slices cut from one fern-root.
Nevertheless, the expression—if it may be said without affectation,
the mind of the face was different. Clayton, too, was beginning
to nurse a very short moustache, a silky bright brown tasselet ;
while Cradock exulted rationally in a narrow fringe of young
whiskers. And Viley's head was borne slightly on one side,
Cradock's almost imperceptibly on the other.
With a race to get to the door first, the twins went out together,
and their merry laugh rang round the hall, and leaped along the
passages. That hall shall not hear such a laugh, nor the passages
repeat it, for many a year of winter nights, unless the dead bear
chorus.
The moment they got to the kennel, which they did by a way of
their own, avoiding all grooms and young lumbermen, fourteen
dogs, of different races and a dozen languages, thundered, yelled,
and yelped at the guns, some leaping madly and cracking their
staples, some sitting up and begging dearly, with the muscles of
their chest all quivering, some drawing along on their stomachs, as
if they were thoroughly callous, and yawning for a bit of activity;
but each in his several way entreating to be the chosen one, each
protesting that he was truly the best dog for the purpose—whatever
that might be—and swearing stoutly that he would down-charge
without a hand being lifted, never run in upon any temptation,
never so much as bolt after a hare. All the while Caldo sat grimly
apart; having trust in human nature, he knew that merit must
make its way, and needed no self-assertion. As his master came
to him he stood upon his hind-legs calmly, balanced by the chain-
stretch, and bent his fore-arms as a mermaid or a kangaroo does.
Then, suddenly, Cradock Nowell dropped the butt of his gun on
his boot, and said, with his face quite altered, -
Viley, I am very sorry; but, after all, I can't go with you.”
Not come with me, Craddy, and a woodcock marked to a
nicety! And you with your vamplets on, and all! What the
deuce do you mean ?”
“I mean just what I say. Don't ask me the reason, my dear
fellow ; I'll tell you by-and-by, when we smoke our pipes together.
Now I beg you, as an especial favour, don't lose a moment in
arguing Go direct to the mark yourself, and straight powder to
you! I'll come and meet you in an hour's time in the spire-bed by
the covert."
“Crad, it's no good to argue with you; that I have known for
ages. Mind, the big-wigs don't dine till seven o'clock, so you have
plenty of time to come for me. But I am so sorry I shan't have
you there to wipe my eye as usual. Nevertheless, i'll bring home
Bill Woodcock; and what will you say to me then, my boy? Ta,
ta; come along, Wena, won't we astonish the natives ? But I

81
take it rather unkind of you, Crad, that you won't come with
me.”
The brothers went out at the little gate, and there Cradock
stopped and watched the light figure hurrying westward over the
chase, taking a short cut for the coverts. Clayton would just carry
down the spinney, where the head of the spring was, because the
woodcock might have gone on there, and if ever a snipe was come
back to his home yet, that was the place to meet him. Thence he
would follow the runnel, for about a third of a mile, clown to the
spot in the Coffin Wood, where the hollies grew, and the hoar-
witheys. When quit of that coppice, the little stream stole away
down the valley, and so past Mr. Garnet's cottage to the Nowel-
hurst water beyond the church bridge. Now whether this were the
self-same brook on whose marge we observed Master Clayton last
week walking, not wholly in solitude, is a question of which there is
little to say-except that it does not matter much. There are so
many brooks in the New Forest; and after all, if you come to that,
how can the most consistent of brooks be identical with the special
brook which we heard talking yesterday? Isn't it running, running
on, even as our love does ? Join hands and keep your fingers
tight; still it will slip through them.
When Clayton was gone but a little way over the heather and
hare-runs, his brother made off, with his gun uncharged, for the
group still at work in the house-front. Bull Garnet was there, with
Rufus Hutton sticking like a leech to him; no man ever was bored
more sharply, or more bluntly expressed it. The veins of his
temples and close-cropped head stood out like a beech-tree's stay
roots; he was steaming all over with indignation, and could not
find a vent for it. When Cradock came up, Mr. Garnet knew well
that he was expected to say something; in fact, that he ought, as a
gentleman, to show his interest, not his surprise. Nevertheless he
would not do it, though he loved and admired Cradock; and for
many reasons was cut to the heart by the very strange news
concerning him. So he left Craddy to begin, and presented no
blank in his swearing. His swearing was tremendous, for he hated.
change of orders.
" Mr. Garnet,” said Cradock, at last, “I have heard a great deal
of bad language, especially among the bargees at Oxford and the
piermen at Southampton; and I don't pretend to split hairs myself,
nor am I mealy-mouthed; but I trust you will excuse my observing,
that up to the present moment I have never heard such black-
guardly language as you are now employing."
Bull Garnet turned round and looked at him. If Cradock had
shown any sign of fear, he would have gone to the earth at once, for
his unripe strength would have had no chance with Garnet's prime
in its fury. But after gazing with much amazement and no little
haughtiness at the young man's firm and yet kindly eyes, Mr.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Garnet dashed forth his hand and shook Cradock's mightily, quite
at the back of the oak-tree; then he patted him on the shoulders,
to resume his superiority; and said, -
My boy, I thank you."
“Well," thought Cradock,“ of all the extraordinary fellows I ever
came across, you are the most extraordinary. And yet it is quite
impossible to doubt your perfect sincerity; is it so impossible to call
in question your sanity ?”
These reflections of Master Cradock were not so lucid as usual.
At least he made a false antithesis. If it had been possible to
doubt Mr. Garnet's sincerity, he would not have been by any means
so extraordinary as he was.
“Not much trouble, after all,” cried Rufus Hutton, rollicking up
like a man of thrice his true cubic capacity ; "ah, these things are
simple enough for a man with a little volls. I shall explain the
whole process to Mrs. Hutton, she is so fond of information.
Never saw a firework before, sir-at least, I mean the machinery of
them-and now I understand it thoroughly; much better, indeed,
than the foreman does. Did not I hear you say so, George ?”.
“Eh, my mon, I deed so "—the foreman was a shrewd, dry
Scotchman—"in your own opeenion mainly. But ye havena peyed
us yet, my mon, for the dustin' o' your shoon."
Rufus Hutton began, amid some laughter, to hunt his French
purse for the siller, when the foreman leaped up as if he were shot,
and dashed behind the oak-tree. “Awa, mon, awa, if ye value your
life! Dinna ye see the glue-pot burstin'?”
Rufus dropped the purse, and fled for his life, and threw himself
flat, fifty yards away, that the explosion might pass over him. Even
then, when the laugh was out, and Mr. Garnet had said to him,
“ Perhaps, sir, you will explain that process for the benefit of Mrs.
Hutton," instead of being disconcerted he was busier than ever, and
took Mr. Garnet aside some little way down the chase.
“They want to make a job of it, I can see that well enough. To
charge for it, sir ; to charge for it."
“ Thank you for your advice, Dr. (Hutton,” replied Bull Garnet
crustily; he was very morose that afternoon, and surly betwixt his
violence ; “but perhaps you had better leave them to me, for fear
of the glue-pot bursting.”
“Ah, I suppose I shall never hear the last of that most vulgar
pleasantry. But I tell you they can't see it, or else it is they won't.
They are determined to do it all over again, and they need only
change four letters, and the fixings all come in again. For the Ř
they should put an L, for the D a YBless my soul, Mr. Garnet,
what is it you see there?”
No wonder Rufus Hutton asked what Mr. Garnet saw, for the
steward's eyes were fixed intently, wrathfully, ferociously, upon
something not very far from the place where his home lay among

the trees. His forehead rolled in three heavy furrows, deep and
red at the bottom, his teeth were set hard, and the muscles of his
shoulders swelled as he clenched his hands fast. Dr. Hutton,
gazing in the same direction, could see only trees and heather.
“What is it you see there, Mr. Garnet?” Rufus Hutton by this
time was quivering with curiosity.
“I'd advise you, sir, not to ask me :" then he added, in a dif-
ferent tone,“ the most dastardly scoundrel poacher that ever wanted
an ounce of lead, sir. Let us go back to the men, for I have little
time to waste."
“ Cool fellow,” thought Rufus ; " waste of time to talk to me, is
it? But what eyes the man must have !"
And so he had, and ears too. Bull Garnet saw and heard every
single thing that passed within the furthest rim of his presence.
No matter what he was doing, or to whom he was talking, no
matter what was afoot, or what temper he was in, he saw and heard
as clearly as if his whole attention were on it, every moving, breath-
ing, speaking, or spoken thing, within the range of human antennæ.
So a spider knows if even a midge or a brother spider's gossamer
floats in the dewy unwoven air beyond his octagonal subtlety. From
this extraordinary gift of Bull Garnet, as well as from his appear-
ance, and the force of his character, the sons of the forest were quite
convinced that he was under league to the devil.
In half an hour's time or less, when the dusk came down like
wool, Cradock cast loose his favourite Caldo, and set out for the
Coffin Wood. From habit more than forethought, and to give his
dog some pleasure, there by the kennel he loaded' his double-bar-
relled gun. He had made up his mind to shoot no more upon his
father's land, until he had express permission from Sir Cradock
Nowell. This was a whim, no doubt, and a piece of pride on his
part ; but the scene of that afternoon, and the sudden change of
position, had left some bitter feeling, and a sense of alienation.
This was the reason why he would not go with Clayton, much as
he longed to do so.
Now, with some dull uncertainty and vague depression clouding
him, he loaded his gun in an absent manner; putting loose shot,
No. 6, in one barrel, and a cartridge in the other.
boy.!” he cried to Caldo, who had crouched at his feet the while ;
then he struck off hot foot for the westward, with the gun upon his
shoulder. But just as he started, one of the lads, who was often
employed as a beater, ran up, and said, with his cap in his hand, in
a manner most insinuating,
“ Take I 'long of 'ee, Meestur Craduck. I'll be rare and keerful
sir."
“No, thank you, Charley, not this time. I am not even going
shooting, and I mean to go quite alone."
Poor Cradock, unlucky to the last. Almost every thing he had

done that day had been a great mistake; and now there was only
one more error, the deadliest error of all, to come.
Whistling a dreamy old ture, he hurried over the brown and
Lufted land, sometimes leaping a tussock of bed-furze, sometimes
following a narrow hare-run, a soft green thread through the hea-
ther.
The sun had been down for at least half an hour, and under the
trees there was twilight; but here, in the open, a tempered brightness
flowed from some yellow clouds still hovering in the west reluctantly.
You might still know a rabbit from a hare at fifty or sixty yards
away. And in truth both bunnies and hares were about; the
former hopping, and stopping, and peeping, and pricking their ears
as the fern waved, and some sitting gravely upon a hillock, with
their backs like a home-made loaf; the hares, on the other hand,
lopping along, with their great ears drooping warily, and the spring
of their haunches gathered up for a dash away any whither : but all
alike come abroad to look for the great and kind God who feeds
them.
Then, from either side of the path, or the sandy brows of the
gravel-pit, the diphthong cry of the partridge arose, the call that tells
they are feeding. Convivial and good-hearted birds, who cannot
eat without much talk, nor without it be duly eaten; no marvel that
the Paphlagonians assign you a brace of hearts. The pheasants
were flown to the coverts long since, being fearful of losing the way
to bed ; two or three brown owls were mousing about, and a horned
fellow came sailing smoothly from the deep settlements of the
thicket, as Cradock Nowell leaped up the hedge, a hedge over-
leaning, overtwisting, stubby, and crowded with ash, rose, and
hazel, the fence of the Coffin Wood.
Though Caldo had stood picturesquely at least a dozen times,
and looked back at his master reproachfully, turning the white of
his eye, and champing his under-lip, and then dropping as if he
himself were shot, when the game sped away with a whirr, Cradock,
true to his resolution, had not pulled trigger yet. And though the
repression was not entirely based upon motives humane, our
Cradock felt a new delight in sparing the lives of those poor things
who have no other life to look to, according to our opinions : so
merry and harmless to him they seemed, so glad that the dangerous
day was done, so thankful for having been ſed and saved by the
grcat unknown, but ever felt, Feeder, Father, and Saviour.

WHILE his sons were thus forgetting, in truly British love of sport,
all the heavy fall of facts upon their young and lively pates, Sir
Cradock Nowell sought the comfort and the strong support which
even proud men have a call for in a life-long friend.
In the presence of Rufus Hutton, which was never very pleasant
to him, the father had been striving hard to put a good face upon
every thing. Nevertheless he was much disturbed and even vexed
at the sudden change, and the necessity of meeting it. All his par-
tiality to Clayton could not relieve him from a painful sympathy
with Cradock, nor could.the sudden gratification of an old desire
atone for all the unpleasantness of the new position. That the an-
cient family of the Nowells should form the subject of county gossip,
and even afford some laughter upon the very point to which they
had always attached so much importance-this alone must be a
sore matter for a proud and reserved man like Sir Cradock. But
he foresaw that other troubles, of a far more serious nature, were too
likely to arise and perhaps destroy the union of his quiet house-
hold.
Fearing many things, and feeling want of friendly comfort, he
plodded forth, to make the best of the hour or so remaining before
he must begin to get ready for the few friends asked to dine with
him. To-morrow would be the great day, of course, when every
body must be received; but the really valued "guests of the hearth”
were to gather around him that evening.
Dwelling on these things, and well aware that Wednesday was
Mr. Rosedew's day for making the round of the parish, Sir Cradock
determined to intercept the ancient friend, if possible, upon his home-
ward journey. Therefore, as if from a sudden impulse, off he set
for the Rectory. And there, in the shrubbery near the gate, he
found that factotum Jem Pottles.
James Pottles, groom and gardener, knife-cleaner, and “boots,"
at the Rectory, who even aspired to the hand, or at any rate, to the
lips, of the plump and gaudy Jemima, was not at all a man, or boy,
to be discovered at first interview. His wits were slow and mild,
and had never yet been hurried, for his parents were unambitious.
It took him a long time to consider, and a long time again to ex-
press himself, which he did with a roll of his tongue. And perhaps
for that very reason, Jem Pottles was quoted all over the village as
a sayer of good things. No conclusion was thought quite safe, at
least by the orthodox women, until it had been asked with a know-
ing look—“And what do Jem Pottles say of it?” Feeling thus his
responsibility, and the gravity of his opinion, Jem grew slower than

ever, and had lately contracted a habit of shutting one eye as he
cogitated. As cause and effect always act and react, this added
enormously to his repute, until Mark Stote the gamekeeper, and
Reuben Cuff the constable, ached and itched with jealousy of that
“cock-eyed, cock-headed boy."
Sir Cradock found Jem quite at his leisure, sweeping up some of
the leaves in the shrubbery, and pleasantly cracking the filberts
which he discovered among them. These he peeled very carefully,
and put them in the pocket of his stable waistcoat, ready for Jemima
by-and-by. He swished away very hard with the broom the mo-
ment he saw such a visitor, and touched his hat in a way that
showed he could scarcely spare time to do it.
“What way, my lad, do you think it likely your master will come
home to-day ?”
This was just the sort of question upon which Jem might commit
himself, and lose a deal of prestige ; so he pretended not to hear it,
and brushed the very ground up. These tactics, however, availed
him not, for Sir Cradock repeated his inquiry in a tone of irritation.
Jem leaned his chin on the broom-handle, and closed one eye deli-
berately.
Well, he maight perhaps come the haigher road, and again a
maight come the lower wai, and I've a knowed him crass the chase,
sir, same as might be fram alongside of Meester Garnet's house.
There never be no telling the wai, any more than the time of un.
But it's never no odds to me."
“And which way do you think the most likely now ?”
“Not to say now,' but bumbai laike. If so be a cooms arly, a
maight come long of the haigher road as goes to the ‘Jolly Fo-
resters ;' and if a com'th middlin' arly, you maight rackon may be
on the town wai ; but if he cometh unoosial late, and a heap of folks
be sickenin, or hisself hath pulled a book out, a maight goo round
by Westacot, and come home by Squire Garnet's wai.” Rich in
alternatives, Jem Pottles opened the closed eye, and shut the open
“What a fool the fellow is !” said Sir Cradock to himself; “I”!!
try the first way, at any rate. For if John is so late, I could not
stop for him, with my guests invited. How I wish we were free
from that dinner to-night, with this strange thing to consider ! But
perhaps, if we manage it well, it will carry it off all the better."
Making thus the best of things, he pulled his watch out, and
found time to try a little quiet saunter along the higher road, by
which Mr. Rosedew might return, if he chanced to take the shortest
way. This road, leading eastward from the Rectory into the depths
of the forest, is one of the loveliest to be found in the whole of lovely
England. Some of the forest roads disappoint us from their width
and openness. By showing too much they distract and weaken the
enjoyment; of the eyes and mind, as well as dissipate that sense of
one.

mystery and grandeur which the mighty works of nature carry in
their shadow.
But here we have the forest roof spread amiably over us, without
the oppression which the more gigantic domes shed downwards.
See how the arches spring overhead, and the brown leaves flutter
among them! In and out, and through and through, across and
across, with delicacy, veining the very shadows. For miles we may
wander beneath them, and see no two alike. How, for fear of
wearying us, after infinite twists and turns—but none of them con-
tortions—after playing across the heavens, and sweeping away the
sunshine, now in this evening light they hover, and rustle like the
skirts of death. Is there one of them with its lichen-mantle copied
from its neighbour's ? Is there one that has borrowed a line, a
character, even a cast of complexion from its own brother rubbing
against it? Their arms bend over us as we walk, we are in their
odour and influence, we know that, like the Magi of old, they adore
only God and His sun; and, when we come out from under them,
we feel that our hearts are larger.
CHAPTER XX.
DEATH IN THE FOREST.
THERE is a long, mysterious thrill, a murmur rather felt than heard,
a shudder of profundity, which traverses the woodland hollows at
the sun's departure. In autunin most especially, when the glory of
trees is saddening, and winter st ms are in prospect, this dark dis-
quietude moves the wood, this horror at the nightfall, and doubt of
the coming hours. Touched as with a subtle stream, the pointlets
of the oak-leaves rise, the crimped fans of the beech are futtered,
and lift their glossy ovals, the pendulous chains of the sycamore
swing; while the poplar flickers its silver skirts, the tippets and
ruffs of the ivy are ruffling, and even the three-lobed bramble-leaf
cannot repress a shiver.
Touched with a stream at least as subtle, we, who are wandering
among the dark giants, shiver and shrink, we know not why; and
our hearts beat faster, to feel how they beat. The cause is the same
both for tree and for man. Earthly nature has not learned to trust
in immortality. Therefore all her works lie ever in bondage to the
dread of death.
Sir Cradock Nowell had passed the age of excessive sensi-
bility, and if he felt chilled in his forest walk, it was less from the
influence of the trees than the keen air stealing under them. More-

CRADOCK NOWELL.
over, in spite of all other cares, he began to want his dinner ; and
as no John Rosedew came up the hill, it became more and more
certain that the parson had taken the longer road. Therefore the
baronet, after waiting for nearly an hour to meet him, turned, and
with a rapid stride took the shortest cut for home. But just as he
crossed a dusky dingle towards the bottom of the chase, he heard
the report of a gun far away, and after a little while, two more.
Well,” he exclaimed to himself, “those boys really take things
easily. To think of their going out shooting, after all that has hap-
pened this afternoon !"
Meanwhile Mr. Rosedew was speeding merrily, according to his
ideas of speed (which were not those of this generation), along a
narrow bridle-way, some two miles to the westward. It would be a
serious insult,so the parson argued-to the understanding of any
man who understood a horse, and now John Rosedew had owned
Coræbus very nearly nine months, and though he had never owned
a horse before, surely by this time he could set papers in the bar-
bara celarent of the most recondite horse-logic-or was it dialectics?
-an insult it would be to that Hippicus who felt himself fit now to
go to a fair and discuss many points with the jockeys, if any body
suggested to him that Coræbus ought to trot.
Trot, sir !” cried the rector, to an imaginary Hippodamas,
“hasn't he been trotting for nearly an hour to-day, sir ? Quite an
equus tolutarius. And upon my word, I only hope he is not so
sore as I am. Then he threw the reins over the pony's neck, and
let him crop some cytisus.
“ Coræbus, have no fear, my horse, you shall not be overworked.
Or if Epirus or Mycenæ be thy home and birthplace—incertus
ibidem sudor-thrice I have wiped it off, and no oaten particles in
it; urit avenæ, so I suppose oats must dry the skin. 'Ad terramque
fuit devexo pondere cervix, a line not to be rendered in English,
even by my Cradock. How fine that whole description, but made
up from alien sources ! Oh how Lucretius would have done it !
Most sad that he was not a Christian."
A believer was what Mr. Rosedew meant. But by this time he
was beginning to look upon all his classical friends as in some sort
Christians, if they only believed in their own gods. Wherein, I fear,
he was far astray from the text of one of the Articles.
Cob Coræbus by this time knew his master thoroughly ; and
exercising his knowledge cleverly, made his shoes last longer. If
the weather felt muggy and “trying.”—from an equine view of pro-
bation—if the road was rough and against the grain, even if the
forest-fly came abroad upon business, Coræbus used (in ting
parlance) to “shut up” immediately. This he did, not in a defiant
tone, not in a mode to provoke antagonism ; he was far too clever a
horse for that ;, but with every appearance of a sad conviction that
his master had no regard for him. At this earnest appeal to his

DEATH IN THE FOREST.
89
feelings, John Rosedew would dismount in haste, and reflect with ad.
miration upon the weeping steeds of Achilles, or the mourning horse of
Mezentius, while he condemned with acrimony the moral conveyed
by a song he had heard concerning the “donkey wot wouldn't go.”
Then he would loosen the girths, and, remonstrating with Coræbus
for his want of self-regard, carefully wipe with his yellow silk pocket-
handkerchief first all the accessible parts of the cob that looked at
all uncomfortable, and then his own capacious forehead. This
being done, he would search around for a juicy mouthful of grass,
or dive for an apple or slice of carrot-Coræbus at the same time
diving nasally-into the depths of his black coat pocket, where he
usually discovered his lunch, which he had altogether forgotten.
While the horse was discussing this little refreshment, John would
put his head on one side, and look at him very knowingly, revolving
in his mind a question which very often presented itself, whether
Coræbus were descended from Corytha or Hirpinus.
However this may have been—and from his “ staying qualities”
one would have thought him rather a chip from the old block of
Troy—he was the first horse good John Rosedew had ever
called his own; and he loved and admired him none the less for
certain calumnies spread by the envious about seedy-toes, splints,
and spavins. Of these crimes, whatever they might be, the parson
found no mention in Xenophon, Pliny, or Virgil, and he was more
than half inclined to believe them clumsy modern figments. As for
the incontestable fact that Coræbus began to whistle when irra-
tionally stimulated beyond his six miles an hour, why, that John Rose-
dew looked upon as a classical accomplishment, and quoted a line
from Theocritus. Very swift horses were gifted with this peculiar
power, for the safety of those who would otherwise be the victims of
their velocity, even as the express train always whistled past Brock-
enhurst station.
After contemplating the animal till admiration was exhausted, and
wondering why some horses have hairy, while others have smooth
ankles, he would refresh himself with a reverie about the Numidian
cavalry; then declaring that Jem Pottles was “impolitiæ notandus,"
he would pass his arm through the bridle, and calling to mind the
Pæon young lady who unduly astonished Darius, pull an old book
from some inner pocket, and stroll on, with Coræbus sniffing now
and then at his hat-brim.
To any one who bears in mind what a punctual body Time is,
this account of the rector's doings will make it not incredible that
he was often late for dinner. But he never lost reckoning alto-
gether in his circumnavigation, because his leisure did not begin
till he had passed the “Jolly Foresters ;" for there he must be by a
certain hour, or Coræbus would feel aggrieved, and so would
Mrs. Cripps, who always looked for him at or about 1.30 P.M. For
some mighty fine company was to be had by a horse who could

behave himself, in the stable of the “ Jolly Foresters," about middle.
day on a Wednesday. Several high-stepping buggy-mares, one or
two satirical Broughamites, even some nags who gave a decided
tone to the neighbourhood, silver-hamed Clevelands, and champ-
the-bit Clydesdales : even these were not too proud—that they left
for vulgarian horses—to snori and blow hard at the “ Foresters' ”
oats, and then eat them up like winking. To this select circle our
own Coræbus had been admitted already, and his conversational
powers admired, when he had produced an affidavit that his master
was in no way connected with trade.
Coræbus now bade fair to be spoiled by all this grand society.
Every Wednesday he came home less natural, more coxcombical.
He turned up his nose at many good horses, whom he had once
respected, fellows who wandered about in the forest, and hung
down their chins when the rain came! And then he became so
affected and false, with an interesting languor, when Amy jumped
out to caress him! Verily, friend Coræbus, thou shalt pay out for
this! What call, pray, hast thou to become a humbug, from seeing
how men are successful ?
John Rosedew awoke quite suddenly to the laws of time and
season, as the hazel branches came over his head, and he could see
to read no longer. The grey wood closed about him, to the right
hand and to the left; the thick shoots of the alder, the dappled ash,
and the osier, hustled among the taller trees whose tops had seen
the sunset ; tufts of grass, and blackberry-tangles, hipped dog-roses
leaning over them, stubby clumps of cornel, brake-fern waving
six feet high where the ground held moisture-who, but an absent
man, would have wandered at dusk into such a labyrinth ?
“Actum est' with my dinner," exclaimed the parson aloud, when
he awoke to the situation; "and what, perhaps, is more important
to thee, at least, Coræbus, thine also is pessum datum. And there
is no room to turn the horse round without scratching his eyes and
his tail so.
Nevertheless, this seems to be a path, or at one time
may have been so ; 'semita, callis, trames'—that last word is the
one for it, if it be derived from 'traho' (which, however, I do not
believe)—for, lo ! there has been a log of wood dragged here even
during a post-diluvial period : we will follow this track to the utter-
most; what says the cheerful philosopher ?— Travtoinu Blótolo táuous
ódóv. Surely a gun, nay, two, or, more accurately, two explosions;
now for some one to show us the way. Coræbus, be of good cheer,
my steed; there is supper yet awaiting thee ; advance then thy best
foot. Why not ?--seest thou some ghost of Polydorus ? Come on, I
say, mine horse-Great God !-
Tired as he was, Coræbus had leaped back from the leading rein,
then cast up his head and snorted, and with a glare of terror stood
trembling. "What John Rosedew saw at that moment was stamped
on his heart for ever. Across his narrow homeward path, clear in

the grey light, and seeming to creep, was the corpse of Clayton
Nowell, laid upon its left side, with one hand to the heart, the wan
face stark and spread on the ground, the body stretched by the final
throe. The pale light wandered over it, and showed it only a shadow.
John Rosedew's nerves were stout and strong, as of a man
who has injured none; he had buried hundreds of fellow-men,
after seeing them die ; but, for the moment, he was struck with a
mortal horror. Back he fell, and drove back his horse ; he could
not look at the dead man's eyes fixed inter.tly upon him. One
minute he stood shivering, and the ash-leaves shivered over him.
· He was conscious somehow of another presence which he could not
perceive. Then he ran up, like a son of God, to what God had left
of his fellow-man. The glaze (as of ground glass) in the eyes, the
smile that has swooned for ever, the scarlet of the lips beclouded
with a chalky dampness, the falling in of the waistcoat pocket over
the broad breast, never again to rise or fall in breathing, and, of
all that wondrous nothing, the dumb, helpless eloquence-a child
that had never seen death before might know him here in his
element-his finest element, man.
But a worse sight than of any dead man-dead, and gone home
to his Father-met John Rosedew's quailing eyes, as he turned to
look around him. It was the sight of Cradock Nowell, clutching
his gun with one hand, and clinging hard with the other, while he
hung from the bank (which he had been leaping) as a winding-sheet
hangs from a candle. The impulse of his leap had failed him,
smitten back by horror; it was not in him to go back, nor to come
one inch forward. The parson called him by his name, but he
could not answer ; only a shiver and a moan showed that he knew
his baptism. The living was more startled, and more startling, than
the dead.

THERE was a little dog that crept and moaned by Clayton's body,
a little dog that knew no better, never having learned much. It was
a small black Swedish spaniel, skilful only in woodcocks, and pretty
well up to a snipe or two, but actually afraid of a pheasant on account
of the dreadful noise he made. She knew not any more than the
others why her name was“ Wena,” and she always answered briskly
to it, though it must have been a corruption. The men said it ought
to be “ Winifred;" the maids, more romantic, “Rowena ;" but very
likely John Rosedew was right, being so strong in philology, when

he maintained that the name was a syncopated form of“ Wadstena,"
and indicated her origin.
However, she knew her master's name better than her own almost.
You had only to say “ Clayton," any where or any when, and she
would lift her tangled ears in a moment, jerk her little whisk of a
tail, till you feared for its continuity, and trot about with a sprightly
air, seeking all around for him. Now she was cuddled close into his
bosom, moaning, shivering, and licking him, staring wistfully at his
cyes and the wound where the blood was welling. She would not
let John Rosedew touch him, but snapped as he leaned over; and
then she began to whimper softly, and nuzzle her head in closer.
Wena,” he said, in a very low voice—“pretty Wena, let me.” And
then she felt that he meant well, and stood up, and watched him.
Uncle John knew in a moment that all was over between this world
and Clayton Nowell. He had felt it from the first glance indeed, but
could not keep hope from fluttering. Afterwards he had no idea
what he did, or how he did it, but the impression left by that
moment's gaze was as stern as the death it noted. Full in the
throat was the ghastly wound, and the charge had passed out at the
back of the neck, through the fatal grape-cluster. Though the bright
hair flowed in a pool of blood, and the wreck of life was pitiful, the
face looked calm and unwrung by anguish, yet firm and staunch,
with the courage summoned to ward death rather than meet it.
Mr. Rosedew, shy and diffident in so many little matters, was
not a man to be dismayed when the soul is moving vehemently.
Now he leaped straight to the one conclusion, fearful as it was.
“ Holy God, have mercy on those we love so much! No accident
is this, but a savage murder.”
He fell upon his knees one moment, and prayed with a dead hand
in his own.
He knew, of course, that the soul was gone, a distance
thought can never gaze; but prayer flies best in darkness.
Then, with the tears all down his cheeks, he looked round once,
as if to mark the things he would have to tell of. In front of the
corpse lay the favourite gun, with the muzzle plunged into the bushes,
as if the owner had fallen with the piece raised to his shoulder. The
hammer of one barrel was cocked, of the other on half-cock only ;
both the nipples were capped, and, of course, both barrels loaded.
The line of its fire was not towards Cradock, but commanded a
little by-path leading into the heart of the wood.
Meanwhile, Cradock had fallen forward from the steep brow of
the hedge-bank; the branch to which he clung in that staggering
way had broken. Slowly he rose from the ground, and still intent
and horror-struck, unable to come nearer, looked more like one of
the smitten trees which they call in the forest“ dead men,” than a
living and breathing body. John Rosedew, not knowing what he
aid, ran to the wretched fellow, and tried to take his hand, but the
offer was quite unnoticed. With his eyes still fixed on his twin.

you?"
brother's corpse, the youth began fumbling clumsily in the pocket
of his shooting-coat; he pulled out a powder-flask, and rapidly,
never once looking at it, dropped a charge into either barrel. John
heard the click of the spring-one, two, as quick as he could have
said it. Then the young man drew from his waistcoat-pocket two
thick patent wads, and squeezed one into either cylinder. All at
once it struck poor “ Uncle John” what he was going to do. Pre-
paring to shoot himself!
Cradock, my boy, is this all the fear of God I have taught
Cradock looked at him curiously, and nodded his head in acknow-
ledgment. It was plain that his wits were wandering. The parson
immediately seized the gun, and sowed the powder broadcast, then
wrenched the flask away from him with a hand there was no resist-
ing. Then for the first time he observed Caldo in the hedge,
“ down-charging ;" the well-trained dog had never moved from the
moment his master fired.
“Come with me at once, come home, Cradock; boy, you shall
come home with me !"
But the man of threescore was not quick enough for the young
despair. Cradock was out of sight in the thicket, and Caldo galloped
after him. Wild with himself for his slowness of wit, John Rosedew
ran to poor Clayton's gun, for fear of his brother finding it. Then
he took from the dead boy's pocket his new and burnished powder-
flask, though it went to his heart to do it, and leaped upon the
back of Coræbus, without a thought of Xenophon. Only Wena was
left to keep her dead young master company.
How Mr. Rosedew got to the Hall he never could remember;
but he must have sat his horse like a Nimrod, and taken a hedge
and two ditches. All he knew was that he did get there, with Coræ-
bus as frightened as he was, and returned to the place of disaster
and death, with three men, of whom Dr. Hutton was one. Sir
Cradock was not yet come back to his home, and the servants re-
ceived proper orders.
As the four men, walking in awe and sorrow, cast the light of a
lamp through the bushes, they heard a quick rustle of underwood,
and crackle of the dead twigs, but saw no one moving.
'Some one has been here since I left," exclaimed John Rosedew,
trembling; some one has lain beside the body, and put marks of
blood on the forehead.”
They all seemed to guess at once what it was, -Cradock embracing
his brother !
"A good job you took the gun away; wonder you had the sense,
though,” said Rufus Hutton, sharply, to pretend he wasn't crying ;
“I only know what I should have done, if I had shot my brother so
-blown out the remains of my brains, sir !”
“ Hush !” said John Rosedew, solemnly, and his deep voice made

their hearts thrill; “it is not our own life to will or to do with. In
the hands of the Lord are our life and our death."
They knelt round the poor corpse tenderly, shading the lamp from
the eyes of it; even Rufus could not handle it in a medical manner.
One of the men, who always declared that he had saved Clayton's
life in his childhood, fell flat on the ground, and sobbed fearfully.
Who could think of the young life gone, in all its brightness gone
for ever to a world unknown, unthought of, and without a thing
to do?
They turned him over and over again, and smoothed his eyes,
and felt his pulse, or where it bounded lately, and would not listen
to the doctor's sentence,“ Dead as a stone, I tell you."
CHAPTER XXII.
NEEDFUL INQUIRY.
MARK STOTE, the head-gamekeeper on the Nowelhurst estate, was
a true and honest specimen of the West Saxon peasant-slow,
tenacious, and dogged, faithful and affectionate, with too much
deference, perhaps, to all who seemed "his betters." He was now
about fifty years old, but sturdy and active as ever, with a weather-
beaten face and eyes always in quest of something. His home was
a lonely cottage in one of the plantations, and there he had a tidy
and very intelligent wife, and a host of little anxieties. His children,
the sparrow-hawks, the weasels, the young fellows who “called
theirselves under-keepers, and all they kept was theirselves, sir,"-
what with these troubles, and (worst, perhaps, of all) that nest of
charcoal-burners by the bustle-headed oak, with Black Will at the
head of them, sometimes, Mark Stote would assure us, his head was
gone “all wivvery' like," and he could get no sleep of night-time.
A mizzly, drizzly rain set in before the poor people got home that
evening with the body of Clayton Nowell. Long mournful soughs
of wind ensued, the boughs of the trees went heavily, and it blew half
a gale before morning; but it takes a real storm to penetrate some
parts of the forest. Once, however, let the storm get in, and it
inakes the most of the opportunity, raging with triple fury, as a lion
does in a compound—the rage of the imperious blast, when it finds
no exit.

and thrum of the loom ; or, more probably, a softer form of “ quivery :"

In the grey of the morning, two men met, face to face, in the
overhanging of the Coffin Wood. Which was the more scared of
the two, neither could have said ; although each felt a little pleased
at the terror of the other. The one of strong nerves was super-
stitious; the other, though free from much superstition, was nervous
under the circumstances. The tall and big man was Mark Stote,
the little fellow who frightened him Dr. Rufus Hutton. The latter,
of course, was the first to recover presence of mind, for Mark Stote's
mental locomotion was of ponderous metal.
“What brings you here, Mr. Stote, at this time of the morn-
ing?"
“And what brings you here, Dr. Hutton ?” Mark might have
asked with equal reason. He wondered afterwards why he did not;
the wonder would have been if he had. As it was, he only said,-
“To see the rights o' my young meester, sir.”
“ The wrongs, you mean,” said Rufus ; “Mark Stote, there is
more in this matter than any man yet has guessed at.”
“You be down upon the truth of it, my word for it but you be,
sir. I've a shot along o’ both of 'em, since 'em wor that haigh, and
see'd how they thought of their guns, sir; Meester Clayton wor laike
enough to shoot Meester Cradock 'xidentually; but never wicey
warse, sir, as the parson sayeth, never wicey warse, sir, for I niver
see no one so cartious laike."
“ Mark Stote, do you mean to say that Cradock shot his brother
on purpose ?”
Mark stared at Rufus for several moments, then he thrust forth
his broad brown hand and seized him by the collar. Dr. Hutton
felt that he was nothing in that big man's grasp, but he would not
play the coward.
Stote, let me go this instant. I'll have
you discharged this very
day unless you beg my pardon."
“ That you moy then, if you can, meester. A leetle chap coom
fram Ingy, an’ we bin two hunner and feefty year ’long o' the squire
and his foregoers !” Nevertheless he let Rufus go, and looked over
his hat indignantly.
"You are an honest fellow," cried Hutton, when he got his breath
again ; an uncommonly honest fellow, although in great need of
enlightenment. It is not in my nature, my man,” here he felt like a
patron, getting over his shaking, so elastic was his spirit ; “I assure
you, Luke-ah no, your name is Matthew; upon my word, I beg
your pardon, I am almost sure it is Mark—Mr. Mark, I shall do my
utmost for your benefit. Now talk no more, but act, Mark.”
“I oodn't a talked nothing, but for mating with your honour.”
"Then resume your taciturnity, which I see is habitual with you,
and perhaps constitutional.”
Mark Stote felt sore all over. Dr. Hutton now was the collarer.
Mark, in his early childhood, had been to school for a fortnight,

and ran away with a sense of rawness, which any big word rc.
newed.
“Mr. Stote, I will thank you to search in that direction, while I
investigate this way."
Mark Stote longed to suggest that possibly Dr. Hutton, being (as
you might say) a foreigner, was not so well skilled in examining
ground as a woodman of thirty years' standing; and therefore that
he, old Mark, should have the new part assigned to him, before it
was trampled by Rufus. But the gamekeeper knew not how to
express it ; sure though he was (as all of us are, when truth hits
the heart like a hammer) that something evil would come of slurring
the matter so stupidly. Therefore he began to search where Dr.
Hutton had ordered him ; that is to say, towards the hedge where
Cradock had been standing, while Rufus himself took the thicker
parts and the tufts towards the heart of the coppice.
With the heavy rain-drops hanging like leeches, or running
together, as they do, at every thorn or scale of the bark, seeking
provocation to come down the nape of the neck of a man, Rufus
Hutton went creeping under, trying not to irritate them, pretending
that he was quite at home, and understood them like a jungle.
Nevertheless he repented, and did not thoroughly search more than
ten square yards. The things would knock him so in the face, and
the stumps would stick in his trousers so, and the drops were so
bad for his rheumatism ; and, as it was quite impossible for any
man to make way there, what on earth was there to look for ?
In spite of all this, he did find something, and stowed it away in
his waistcoat-pocket, to be spoken of, or otherwise, according to the
turn of events. And by this he meant no dishonesty, but being a
very warm-hearted man, as well as a very hasty one, he pitied young
Cradock most deeply, and would do all he could to save him.
At the side of the narrow by-path leading from that woodınan's
track (by which John Rosedew had approached) into the far depth
of the thicket, Dr. Hutton found, under a blackberry-bush, a little
empty tube, unlike any tube he had seen before. It was about two
inches and a half in length, and three-fourths of an inch in diameter.
Sodden as it was with the rain, and opened partway along the
seam, it still retained, unmistakably, the smell of exploded powder.
It seemed to be made of mill-board, or some other form of paper,
with a glaze upon the outside and some metal foil at the butt of it.
What puzzled Rufus most of all was a little cylinder passing into
and across the bottom, something like a boot-tag.
Dr. Hutton was not at this time skilled in modern gunnery. He
knew how to load a fowling-piece, and what the difference was
between a flint-gun and a percussion-gun; moreover, he had been out
shooting once or twice in India, not from any love of the sport, but
to oblige his neighbours. So he thought himself both acute and
learned in arriving at the conclusion that this was a cartridge-case.

Mark, does Mr. Cradock Nowell generally shoot with car-
tridges?”
"He laiketh mostways to be with a curtreege in his toard barryel,
sir."
“Oh, keeps a cartridge in his left barrel, does he ; and fires first
the right, I suppose ?"
Leaving Mark to continue the search, Rufus returned to the Hall,
after carefully taking the distances between certain important points.
He was bound, as he felt, to lose no time in making the strictest
examination of the poor youth’s body. For now, in this great
calamity, the management of every thing seemed to fall upon Rufus
Hutton. Sir Cradock, of course, was overwhelmed ; John Rosedew,
although so deeply distressed, for the boys were like his own to
him, was ready to do his utmost; but, as every one knew, except
himself, he was not a man of business. Unluckily, too, Mr. Garnet,
always the leading spirit wherever he appeared, had not yet pre-
sented himself in this keen emergency. But his son came up, in
the course of the day, to ask how Sir Cradock Nowell was, and to
say that his father was quite laid up with a violent bilious attack,
such as he had every month almost.
Dr. Hutton worked very hard, kept his mind on the stretch con-
tinually, ordered every one right and left. He even contrived to
repulse all the kindred, to the twentieth collateral, who were flock-
ing in, that day, to rejoice at the manhood of the heir. From old
Hogstaff, who knew all the family, kith and kin, and friends and
enemies, he learned the names of the guests expected, and met
them with laconic missives handed through the closed gates at the
lodges. In many cases, it is to be feared, indignation overcame
sympathy; upstart insolence !” was heard through the clatter of
carriage-windows, very nearly as often as, “most sad occur-
rence ! ”
However, most of them were consoled by the prospect of learning
every thing at the inquest on the morrow. What could be clearer
than that Cradock must be hanged for Clayton's murder? The
disgrace would kill the old baronet. “And then, it would be very
painful, but my wife would be bound, sir, for the sake of all our
children, to prove her direct descent from that well-known Sir
Cradock Nowell, who shot a man in the New Forest. Ah, I fear it
runs in the family.”
But their wrath was most unphilosophical, unworthy of any
moralists, when they found that Rufus had cheated them all as to
the time of the inquest. In every direction he spread a report that
the coroner could not attend until three o'clock on Friday, while he
had arranged very quietly to begin the proceedings at noon. And
he had taken good care to secure the presence of all the chief men
in the neighbourhood—the magistrates, the old friends of the family,
all who were interested in its honour rather than in its possessions.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
As none of the baffled cousins could solace themselves with outcry
that the matter had been hushed up, they discovered that kind
feeling had made the scene too distressing for them.
The coroner sat in the principal room at the "Nowell Arms;"
the jury had been to see the body lying at the Hall, and now were
to hear the evidence. Six or seven of the county magistrates sat
behind the coroner, and their clerk was with them. Of course they
did not attend officially, their jurisdiction being entirely several from
that of the present court.
But there could be little doubt that their
action would depend, in a great measure, upon what should now
transpire.
The jury was chosen carefully to preclude, so far as might be, the
charge of private influence. They were known, for the most part,
as men of independence and probity, and two of them as consistent
enemies to the influence of the Hall. As for general spectators,
only a few of the village-folk allowed their curiosity to conquer their
good feeling, or, perhaps, it might be their discretion; for all were
tenants under Sir Cradock; and though it was known by this time
that Bull Garnet was ill and in bed, laid up with one of his old
attacks, every body felt certain that he would find out who dared to
be present, and visit them pretty smartly.
It would be waste of time to recount all the evidence given; for
we know nearly all that Dr. Hutton and the clergyman. would
depose. Another medical man, Dr. Gall, had also examined poor
Clayton's remains; and the healing profession, who cure us (like
bacon) after they have killed us, are remarkable for agreeing in
public, and quarrelling sadly in private life. So Dr. Gall deposed
exactly as Mr. Hutton had done. He was very emphatic towards
Rufus, in the use of the proper prefix; but we who know the skill
displayed care not for the game certificate.
One part, however, of the medical evidence ought to be repeated.
Poor Clayton had not died from an ordinary small-shot wound or
wounds, but from a ghastly hole through his throat, cut as if by a
bullet. As Dr. Gall, who knew something of guns, very concisely
put it, the hole was like the hole in a door, when boys have fired,
as they sometimes do, a tallow-candle through it. And yet it was
fluted at the exit, in the fleshy part of the neck, as no bullet could
have marked it. That was caused by the shot diverging, beginning
to radiate, perhaps from the opposition encountered.
“In two words,” said Dr. Gall, when they had badgered him in
his evidence, the deceased was killed either by a balled cartridge,
or by a charge of loose shot fired within six feet of him.”
“Very good,” thought Rufus Hutton, who heard all Dr. Gall
said; I'll keep my cartridge-case to myself. Poor Crad shan't
have that against him.”
Hereupon, lest any mist (which goddesses abound in, vide Homer
passim) descend upon the eyes or mind of any gentle follower of

that poor Craddy's fortunes, let us endeavour to explain Dr. Gall's
obscurities.
Cartridges, as used by sportsmen with guns which load at the
muzzle, are packages of shot compact, and rammed down in a body.
Some of them have spiral cases of the finest wire, covered round
with paper; others, used for shorter distance, have only cylinders of
paper to enclose the shot. The interstices between the shots are
solidified with sawdust. The only use of these things is—for they
save little time in loading-to kill the game, whatever it may be, at
a longer distance. The shots are prevented from scattering so
widely as they love to do, when freed from the barrel's repression.
They fly in a closer body, their expansive instincts being checked,
when first they leave the muzzle, by the constraint of the case and
the tightness of their brotherhood. But it sometimes happens,
mainly with wire-cartridges, that the shot can never burst its cere-
ments, and flies in the compass of a slug, until it meets an obstacle.
When this is so, the quarry escapes, unless a bullet so aimed would
have hit it. This non-expansion is called, in good English, the
“balling" of the cartridge. And those which are used for the
longest distance, and for wild-fowl shooting-green cartridges, as
they are called, containing larger shot-are especially apt to ball.
Dr. Gall was aware, of course, that no one beating for a woodcock
would think of putting a green cartridge into his gun at all; but it
seemed very likely indeed that Cradock might have used a blue
one, for a longer shot with his left barrel; and the blue ones, having
wire round them, sometimes ball, though not so often as the green
ones do. It only remains to be said that when a cartridge balls, it
flies with the force, as well as in the compass, of a bullet. With
three drachms of powder behind it, it will cut a hole at forty yards
through a two-inch deal.
Whether it were a balled cartridge or a charge of loose shot at
six feet distance, was the momentous issue. In the former case,
there would be fair reason to set it down as an accident; for the
place where Cradock had first been seen was thirty yards from
Clayton; and he might so have shot him thence, in the dusk, and
through the thick of the covert. But if that poor boy had died
from a common charge of shot,“ Murder” was the only verdict true
men could return on the evidence set before them. For Cradock
mást have fired wilfully at the open throat of his brother, then flown
to the hedge and acted horror when he saw John Rosedew. Where
was Cradock? The jury trembled, and so did Rufus Hutton. The
coroner repeated the question, although he had no right to do it at
that stage of the evidence.
“Since it occurred he has not been seen,” whispered Rufus
Hutton at last, knowing how men grow impatient and evil when
unanswered.
“Let us proceed with the rest of the evidence,” said his honour,

refreshment, gentlemen. Justice must not be hurried."
CHAPTER XXIII.

means
It may have been perceived already that the coroner was by no
the right man in the right place.” The legal firm, “Cole,
Cole, and Son," had been known in Southampton for many years,
as doing a large and very respectable business.
The present
Mr. Cole, the coroner, who had been the “Son” in the partnership,
became sole owner suddenly by the death of his father and uncle.
Having brains enough to know that he was far from having too
much, he took at once into partnership with him an uncommonly
wide-awake, wary fellow, who had been head-clerk to the old firm,
ever biding his time for this inevitable result. So now the firm was
thriving under the style and title of “Cole, Chope, and Co.,"
Mr. Chope being known far and wide by the nickname of “ Cole's
brains." "Mr. Cole being appointed coroner, not many months ago,
and knowing very little about his duties, took good care for a time
not to attempt their discharge without having “ Cole's brains" with
him. But this had been found to interfere so sadly with private
practice, that little by little Cole plucked up courage, as the novelty
of the thing wore off, and now was accustomed to play the coroner
without the assistance of brains. Nevertheless, upon an occasion
so important as this, he would have come with full cerebrum, but
that Chope was gone for his holiday. Mr. Cole, however, was an
honest man-in the absence of his partner-and meant to do his
duty, so far as he could see it. In the present inquiry he had less
chance of seeing it than usual, for he stood in great awe of
Mr. Brockwood, a man of ability and high standing, who, as Sir
Cradock Nowell's solicitor, attended to watch the case, a: the
suggestion of Rufus Hutton.
Both the guns were produced to the court, in the condition in
which they were found, except that Mr. Rosedew, for safety's
sake, had lowered the right hammer of Clayton's to the half-cock,
before he concealed it from Cradock. Cradock's own unlucky
piece had been found, on the following morning, in a rushy pool,
where he had cast it, as he fled so wildly. Both the barrels had
been discharged, while both of Clayton's were loaded. It went to
the heart of every man there who could not think Cradock a
murderer, when in reply to a juryman's question, what was the

meaning of certain lines marked with a watch-spring file on the
trigger-plate of his gun, it was explained that the twins so registered
the number and kind of the season's game.
After this, Mark Stote was called, and came forward very
awkwardly with a deal of wet on his velveteen cuffs, which he tried
to keep from notice. His eyes were fixed upon the coroner, with a
kind of defiance, but even while he was kissing the book, he was
forced to sniff behind it.
“Mr. Mark Stote,” said the coroner, duly prompted, you have,
I believe, been employed to examine the scene of this lamentable
occurrence ?"
Mark Stote, with his chest thrown forward, and his arms hanging
straight at his sides, took a minute to understand this, and a
minute to consider his answer.
“Yees, my lard, I throwed a squoyle at ’un.”
The representative of the Crown looked at Mark with amaze-
ment equal at least to that with which Mark was regarding him.
Gentlemen,” asked Mr. Cole, addressing the court in general,
“what language does this man talk?”
West Saxon," replied Mr. Brockwood, speaking apart to the
coroner ; “West Saxon of the forest. He can talk plain English
generally, but whenever these people are nervous, they fall back
unconsciously upon their native idiom. You will never be able to
understand him : shall I act as interpreter ?”
“With all my heart; that is to say, with the consent of the jury.
But what I mean to say, how-
“How am I to be checked, you mean, unless I am put upon oath;
and how can you enter it as evidence ? Simply thus-let your
clerk take down the original answers. All the jury will understand
them, and so, perhaps, will he.”
The clerk, who was a fine young gentleman, strongly pronounced
in attire, nodded a distinct disclaimer. It would be so unaris-
tocratic to understand any peasant-tongue.
At any rate, most of the magistrates do. There are plenty of
checks upon me.
But I am not ambitious of the office. Appoint
any one you please.”
Gentlemen of the jury,” said the coroner, glad to shift from
himself the smallest responsibility, are you content that Mr.
Brockwood should do as he has offered ?"
Certain, and most kind of him,” replied the jury, all speaking at
once, “if his honour was unable to understand old English.”
“Very good,” said Mr. Brockwood; “don't let us make a fuss
about nothing. Mr. Stote says he 'throwed a squoyle ;' that is to
say, cast a glance at it.”
“And in what state did you find the ground ?" was the coroner's
next question.
“ Twearable, twearable. Dwont 'e ax ov me vor gude now,

CRADOCK NOWELL.
dwont 'e.” And he put up his broad hand before his broad
face.
“Terrible, terrible," said the coroner, going by the light of nature
in his interpretation; "but I do not mean the exact spot only where
the body was found. I mean, how was the ground as regards dry
and wet, for the purpose of retaining footmarks ?”
Thar a bin zome rick-rack wather, 'bout a sannit back. But
most peart on it ave a droud up agin. 'Twur starky, my lard, moor
nor stoachy.” Here Mark felt that he had described things lucidly
and powerfully, and looked round the room for approval.
“Stiff rather than muddy, he means,” explained Mr. Brockwood,
smiling at the coroner's dismay.
“Were there any footprints upon it, in the part where the ground
could retain them?”.
“'Twur dounted and full of stabbles, in the pearts whur the
mulloch
wur,
but the main of'un tuffets and stramots."
“That is to say,” Mr. Brockwood translated, “ the ground was
full of impressions and footmarks, where there was any dirt to
retain them; but most of the ground was hillocky and grassy, and
so would take no footprints.”
“When you were searching, did you find any thing that seemed
to have been overlooked ?”
“Yees, my lard, I vound thissom "-producing Crad's stubby
meerschaum—"and thissom”-a burnt felt-wad" and a whaile
vurther, ai vound thissom.” Here he slowly drew from his pocket
a very fine woodcock, though not over fat, with its long bill
tucked most carefully under its wing. He stroked the dead bird
softly, and set its feathers professionally, but did not hand it about,
as the court seemed to anticipate.
“In what part, and from what direction, has that bird been shot?"
“Ramhard of the head, my lard, as clane athert shat, and as
vaine a bird as iver I wish to zee. But, ah’s me, her be a wosebird,
a wosebird, if iver wur wan.”
Mark could scarcely control his tears, as he thought of the bird's
evil omen, and yet he could not help admiring him. He turned
him over and over again, and dropped a tear into his tail coverts.
Mr. Brockwood saw it and gave him time; he knew that for
many generations the Stotes had lived under the Nowells.
“Oh, the bird was shot, you say, on the right side of the head,
and clean through the head.”
“ Thank you,” proceeded the coroner. “Now, do you think that
he could have moved after he touched the ground ?"
“Nivir a hinch, I allow, my lard. A vell as dead as
stwoun."
“Now inform the court, as nearly as you can, of the precise spot
where you found it."
It took a long time to discover this, for Mr. Stote had not been

taught the rudiments of topography. Nevertheless, they made out
at last that the woodcock had been found, dead on his back, with
his bill up, eight or ten yards beyond the place where Clayton
Nowell fell dead, and in a direct line over his body from the gap in
the hedge where Cradock stood. Dr. Hutton must have found the
bird, if he had searched a little further.
“Now," said the coroner, forcibly, “Mr. Stote, I will ask you a
question, which is, perhaps, a little beyond the rules of ordinary evi-
dence, I mean, at least, as permitted in a court of record”--here he
glanced at the magistrates, who could not claim the rank of
record_" which of these two unfortunate brothers caused, in your
opinion, the death of—of that woodcock?"
Mr. Brockwood glanced at the coroner sharply, and so did his
own clerk. Even the jury knew, by intuition, that he had no right
to tout for opinions.
“ Them-crink-crank words is beyand me. Moy head be awl
wivvery wi' em, zame as if my old ooman was patchy."
“His honour asks you," said Mr. Brockwood, with a glance not
lost on the justices—for it meant, You see how we court inquiry,
though the question is quite inadmissible—“ which of the brothers
in your opinion shot the bird which you found ?''
Why, Meester Cradock, o' course. Meester Cleaton 'ud needs
a blowed un awl to hame, where a stwooud.”
“Mr. Clayton must have blown him to pieces, if he shot him
from the place where he stood, at least from the place where Mr.
Clayton fell. And poor Mr. Clayton lay directly between his
brother and the woodcook?"
Mr. Brockwood in his excitement forgot that he had no right to
put this question, nor, indeed, any other, except as formally repre-
senting some one formally implicated. But the coroner did not
check him.
“By whur the blude wor, a moost have been naigh as cud be
atwane the vern-patch and the wosebird."
“Very good. That fern-patch was the place where Mr. Cradock
dropped from the gap in the hedge. Mr. Rosedew has proved that.
Now let us have all you know, Mark Stote. Did you see any other
marks, stabbles you call them, not, I mean, in the path Mr. Rosedew
came along, nor yet in the patches of thicket through which Mr.
Cradock fled, but in some other direction ?”
This was the very question the coroner ought to have put long
ago. Thus much he knew when Brockwood put it, and now he was
angry accordingly.
Mr. Brockwood, I will thank you-consider, sir, this is a court
of record !”
“Then don't let it record stupid humbug !” Mr. Brockwood was
a passionate man, and his blood was up. I will take the respon-
sibility of any thing I do. All we want to elicit the truth is a little

skill and patience ; and for want of that the finest young fellow I
have ever known may be blasted for life, for this world and the other.
Excuse me, Mr. Coroner, I have spoken precipitately ; I have much
reverence for your court, but far more for truth.”
Here Mr. Brockwood sat down again, and all the magistrates
looked at him with nods of approbation. Human passions and
human warmth are sure to have their way, even in Areopagus. At
last the question was put by the coroner himself. Of course it was
a proper one.
“Yees, I zeed wan,” said Mark Stote, scratching the back of his
head (where at least the memory ought to be) ; " but a wadn't of no
'count much.”
"Now tell us where that one was."
“Homezide of the rue, avore you coams to them hoar-witheys,
naigh whur the bower-stone stanneth. 'Twur zumbawdy yaping
about mebbe after nuts as had lanced fro' the rue auver the water-
tabble.”
Before this could be translated, a great stir was heard in the
outer room, a number of people crying, “Don't 'ee-now!” and a
hoarse voice uttering “I will.". The coroner was just dismissing
Mr. Stote with deep relief to both of them, and each the more
respecting because he could not understand the other.
"Mark Stote, you have given your evidence in a most lucid
There are few people more to be respected than the
thorough Saxon gamekeeper.”
Moy un goo, my lard ?” asked the patient Mark, with his neck
quite stiff, as he at first had stuck it, and one eye cocked at the
coroner, as along the bridge of a fowling-piece.
“Mr. Stote, you may now depart. Your evidence does you the
greatest credit, both as the father of a family, and as—as a conservator
of
game, and I may say—ah, yes—as a faithful family retainer.”
"Thank 'ee, my lard, and vor my peart I dwoan't b'leeve now as
you manes all the 'arm as most volks says of 'ee."
Mark was louting low, trying to remember the fashion they taught
him forty years since in the Sunday-school, when the door flew
back, and the cold wind entered, and in walked Cradock Nowell.
As regards the outer man, one may change in fifty ways in half
of fifty hours. Villanous ague, writing a book, violent attacks of
bile, Gladstone claret, love rejected, scarlet fever, small-pox, any of
these may make a man lose memory in the looking-glass ; but all
combined could not have wrought such havock, such appalment,
such drought in the fountains of the blood, as that young face now
told of. There was not one line of it like the face of Cradock Nowell.
It struck the people with dismay, as they made room and let him
pass; it would have struck the Roman senate, even with Cato
speaking. Times there are when we forget even our sense of
humour, absorbed in the power of passion, and the rush of our
manner.

souls along with it. No one in that room could have laughed at the
best joke that ever was made, with his eyes upon Cradock Nowell.
Uiterly unconscious what any fellow thought of him (except per-
haps in some under-current of electric sympathy, whose wires never
can be cut, up to the drop of the gallows), Cradock crossed the
chairs and benches, feeling them no more than the wind feels the
hills it crosses. Yet with the inbred courtesy of nature's thorough
gentleman, though he forgot all the people there as thinking of
himself, he did not yet forget himself as bound to think of them.
He touched no man on leg or elbow, be he baronet or cobbler,
without apologizing to him. Then he stood in the foremost place,
looking at the coroner, saying nothing, but ready to be arraigned of
any thing.
Mr. Cole had never yet so acutely felt the loss of his “brains ;” and
yet it is likely that even Chope would have doubted how to manage
it. The time a man of the world might pass in a dozen common-
places, passed over many shrewd heads there, and none knew what
to say. Cradock's deep grey eyes, grown lighter by the change of
health, and larger from the misery, seemed to take in every one who
could or could not feel for him.
“Here I am, and cannot be hurt more than my own soul has
Charge me with murder, if you please, I never can dis-
prove it. Reputation is a thing my God thinks needless for me ;
and so it is, in the despair which He has sent upon me.”
Not a word of this he spoke, but his eyes said every word of it,
to those who have looked on men in trouble, and heard the labour-
ing heart. As usual, the shallowest man there was the first to
speak.
“Mr. Nowell," asked the coroner blandly, as of a wealthy
client, am I to understand, sir, that you come to tender your
evidence ?"
“Yes,” replied Cradock. His throat was tight, and he could not
manage to say much.
“Then, sir, I am bound to administer to you the caution usual
on these occasions. Excuse me; in fact, I know you will ; but your
present deposition may be-I mean it is possible-
· Sir, I care for nothing now. I am here to speak the
truth."
“Very laudable. Admirable ! Gentlemen of the jury-Mr.
Brockwood, perhaps you will oblige the court by examining in chief?"
“No, your honour, I cannot do that; it would be a confusion of
duties."
“ I will not be examined,” said Cradock, with a low hoarse voice ;
he had been in the woods for a day and two nights, and of course
had taken cold,—“I don't think I could stand it. A woman who
gave me some bread this morning told me what you were doing, and
I came here as fast as I could, to tell you all I know. Let me do it,

if you please, in the best way I can; and then do what you like with
me."
The utter despair of these dry words went cold to the heart of
every one, and Mark Stote burst out crying so loud that a woman
lent him her handkerchief. But Cradock's eyes were hard as flint;
and his heart as empty as if hope had never lived there.
The coroner hesitated a little, and whispered to his clerk. Then
he said with some relief, and a look of kindness,-
“The court is ready, Mr. Nowell, to receive your statement. Only
you must make it upon oath."
Cradock, being duly sworn, told all he knew, as follows:-
“It had been agreed between us, that my-my dear brother
should go alone to look for a woodcock, which he had seen that day.
I'was to follow in about an hour, and meet him in the spire-bed
just outside the covert. For reasons of my own, I did not mean to
shoot at all, only to meet my brother, hear how he had got on, and
come home with him. But I happened to take my gun, because my
dog was going with me, and I loaded it from habit. Things had
happened that afternoon which-it does not matter-but my
thoughts were running upon them. When I got to the spire-bed,
there was no one there, although it was quite dusk; but I thought
I heard my brother shooting inside the Coffin Wood. So I climbed
the hedge, with my gun half-cocked, and called him by his
name.”
Here Cradock broke down fairly, as the thought came over him
that henceforth he might call and call, but none would ever
answer.
“By what name did you call him?" Mr. Brockwood looked at
the coroner angrily. What difference could it make ?
“I called, ' Viley, Viley, my boy!' thrce times, at the top of my
voice. I used to call him so in the nursery, and he always liked it.
I can't make out why he did not answer, for he must have been
close by—though the bushes were very thick, certainly. At that
instant, before I had time to jump down into the covert, a wood-
cock, flushed, perhaps, by the sound of my voice, crossed a little
clearing not thirty yards in front of me. I forgot all about my
determination not to shoot that day, cocked both barrels in a
moment, but missed him clean with the first, because a branch of
the hedge flew back and jerked the muzzle sharply. But the bird
was flying rather slowly, and I got a second shot at him, as he
crossed a little path in the copse, too narrow to be called a ride. I
felt quite sure that I shot straight at him, and I thought I saw him
fall; but the light was very bad, and the trees were very thick, and
he gave one of those flapping jerks at the moment I pulled the
trigger, so perhaps I missed him.”
" That 'ee doedn't, Meester Craydock. Ai’se larned 'ee a bit too
much for thic. What do 'ee call thissom?” Here Mark Stote held

up the woodcock. “Meester Craydock, my lard, be the sprackest
shat anywhur round these pearts.”
Poor Mark knew not that in his anxiety to vindicate his favourite's
skill, he was making the case more black for him.
“ Mark Stote, no more interruptions, if you please,” exclaimed
the coroner; “Mr. Nowell, pray proceed."
“Dwoan't 'ee be haish upon un, my lard, dwoan't 'ee vaind un
guilty. A coodn't no how ’ave doed it. A wor that naice and per-
tiklar, a woodn't shat iven toard a gipsy bwoy. And his oyes be as
sprack as a merlin's. A cood zee droo a mokpie's neestie."
Cradock's face, so pale and haggard but a minute before, was
now of a burning red. The jury looked at him with astonishment,
and each, according to his bias, put his construction upon the
change. Two of them thought it was conscious guilt; the rest be-
lieved it to be indignation at the idea of being found guilty. It was
neither; it was hope—the flash and flush of sudden hope, leaping
across the heart, like a rocket over the sea in a tempest. He could
not speak, but gasped in vain, then glutched (to use a forest word,
which means gulped down a sob), and fell back into John Rosedew's
arms, faint, and stark, and rigid.
The process of his mind which led him to the shores of light-
but only for a little glimpse, a glimpse and then all dark again-
was somewhat on this wise : “Only a bullet, or balled cartridge, at
the distance I was from him, could have killed my darling Viley on
the spot, as I saw him dead, with the hole cut through him. I am
almost sure that my cartridge was in the left barrel of the gun,
where I always put it. And now it is clear that the left barrel
killed that unlucky bird, and killed him with shot flying separate,
so the cartridge must have opened. Viley, too, was ten feet under
the height the bird was flying. I don't believe that I hit him at all.
I had loose shot in my right barrel; the one that sent so random,
on account of the branch that struck it. I am almost sure I had,
and I fired quite straight with the left barrel. God is good, the
great God is merciful, after all I thought of Him." No wonder that
he fainted away, in the sudden reaction.
There is no need to dwell any longer on the misery of that
inquest. The principal evidence has been given. The place where
Cradock stood in the hedge, and the place where Clayton tell and
died; how poor Cradock saw him first, in the very act of jumping,
and hung like a nut-shuck, shrivelled up; how he ran back to his
dead twin-brother and could not believe in his death, and went
through the woods like a madman, with nothing warm about him
except his brother's blood, -all this must be now clear enough, as
it had long been to the jury, and even to the coroner.
Only Cradock awoke from his hope-what did he care for their
verdict ? He awoke from his hope not in his moral—that there
could be no doubt of—but in his manual innocence; when, to face

all circumstances, he had nothing but weak habit. He could not
swear, he could not even feel confident (and we want three times
three for swearing, that barbarous institution) that he had rammed
the cartridge down the left barrel, and the charge of shot down the
right. All he could say was this, that it was a very odd thing if he
did not so.
The oddity of a thing is seldom enough to establish its contrary,
in the teeth of all evidence. So the jury found that“ Violet Clayton
Nowell had died from a gunshot wound, inflicted accidentally by
his brother Cradock Nowell, whom, after careful consideration, they
absolved from all shadow of blame.”
CHAPTER XXIV.
A GARDEN PARTY.
RUFUS HUTTON rode home that night to Geopharmacy Lodge.
He had worked unusually hard, even for a man of his activity,
during the last three days, and he wanted to see his Rosa again,
and talk it all over with her. Of course he had cancelled her in-
vitation, as well as that of all others, under the wretched circum-
stances. But before he went, he saw Cradock Nowell safe in the
hands of the rector, the only hands that still could hold any hope
for such an outcast.
If we strike the average of mankind, we shall find Rufus Hutton
above it. He had his many littlenesses, like the whole of us, his
oddities of mind and manner, even his want of charity, and his
practical faith in selfishness; none the less for all of that there
were many people who loved him. And those of us who are loved
of any-save parents, wife, or daughter-loved, I mean, as the
word is felt and not interpreted,- with warmth of heart, and
moistened eyes (when good or ill befalls us); any such
may
have
no doubt of being loved by the angels.
All this while, Sir Cradock Nowell_shut himself up, and, as
Homer has it, “fed on his own heart.” Ever since that fearful time,
when, going home to his happy dinner with a few choice friends, he
had overtaken some dark thing, which he would not let them hide
from him-ever since that awful moment when he saw what it was,
the father had not taken food, nor comfort either of God or man.
All they did-well-meaning people—was of no avail. It might
be very well for people, who had never known deep trouble, to talk
freely of it. Even to himself he would not try to reason over it.
There it was. He took it as it came; and meant to take it so.

A GARDEN PARTY.
109
Only if he could recollect one single action of his life to give so
much as a shadow of justice to this visitation, of course it would be
no comfort to him, only some satisfaction.
Dwelling thus on his bitterness, he grew tenfold more bitter.
Admitting none to comfort him, he hardened against all comfort.
Only sometimes, when the softness of great anguish vanquished
him, he longed to meet his one surviving son, and try to comfort
him.
And here arose the gross injustice, sure to grow in narrow minds
that stickle most for justice, against the broader and larger sense of
those who are far above them.
Sir Cradock Nowell felt a little doubt at first, and then mistrust;
and after that suspicion even of his friend John Rosedew !
For instance, why should his most unlucky and fatally careless
son take refuge from his own father at the Rectory, and be harboured
there as if there were no one else to care for him ? John Rosedew
was an ancient friend, a very dear friend of course, and one most
truly to be relied upon : still it seemed, to say the least of it, rather
an odd way of proving friendship, to hold aloof in the time of
trouble, and leave a comparative stranger to discharge the count-
less kind offices, and more than all, at such a time, to keep an only
child from coming to his afflicted father.
These charges, of course, were untrue in the main, especially that
last one ; for Mr. Rosedew had done his utmost to persuade poor
Cradock to seek and get over that dreadful interview, which sooner
or later he must have with his father. But being repeatedly begged
to spare him for one day more, just one more day, the kind-hearted
parson allowed the blame to rest on his own broad shoulders rather
than the poor boy's laden back.
Neither did Mr. Rosedew mean to spare himself, or hold himselt
aloof at such a time of grief; gladly would he have hurried to help, at
any hour of the day or night. Only it happened that when he called,
Sir Cradock was down in his deepest depression, and Dr. Hutton,
who took on himself the medical and all other duties, believed and
honestly said that his patient must not be excited.
So it came to pass that a cloud arose, and thickened, between two
worthy men, who thoroughly understood each other, according to
their own ideas. And the genuine love felt by each towards the
other served only to edge their perceptions.
Turn we now to luckier people, for a little change of scene, Rufus
Hutton in his garden, with his pretty wife adıniring, chattering, and
criticizing.
“Rufus, why, my darling Rufus, how much more d-g are you
going to put on that little piece of ground, no bigger than my work-
table ?"
Mrs. Hutton had been brought up to “call a spade a spade;" and

she extended this wise nomenclature to the contents of the spade as
well.
Rosa, why, my darling Rosa, that bed contains one hundred
and twenty-five square feet. Now, according to the great Justus
Liebig, and his mineral theory~
“ One hundred and twenty-five feet, Rue! And I could jump
across it! I am sure it is not half so long as my silk measure in
the shell, dear !"
Dearest Rosa, just consider : my pet, get out your tablets, for
you are nothing at mental arithmetic."
“ Indeed! Well, you never used to tell me things like that, dear
Rufus !!
“Well, perhaps I didn't, Roe. I would have forsworn to any
extent, when I saw you among the candytuft. But now, my darling,
I have got you; and from a lofty feeling, I am bound to tell the
truth. Consider the interests, Rosa-
“Go along with your nonsense, Rue. You talk below your great
understanding, because you think it suits me.”
* Perhaps I do,” said Rufus, “perhaps I do now and then, my
dear : you always hit the truth so. But is it not better to do that
than to talk Hindustani to my Rosa ?”
“I am sure I don't know; and I am sure I don't care. When
have I heard you say any thing, Rufus, so wonderful, and so out of
the way, that I, poor I, couldn't understand it? Please to tell me
that, Rufus.”
"My darling, consider. You are exciting yourself so fearfully.
You make me shake all over.''
“Then you should not say such things to me, Rufus. Why, Rue,
you are quite pale !"—What an impossibility! She might have
boiled him in soda without bringing him to a shrimp-colour.
“Come into the house this moment, I insist upon it, and have two
glasses of sherry. And you do say very wonderful things, much too
clever for me, Rufus; and indeed, I believe, too clever for any
woman in the world, even the one that wrote Homer, according to
the last opinion.”
Rosa Hutton ran into the house, and sought for the keys high
and low; then got the decanter at last out of the cellaret, and
brought out a bumper of wine. Crafty Rufus stopped outside,
thoroughly absorbed in an autumn rose; knowing that she liked to
do it for him, and glad to have it done for him.
“Not a drop, unless you drink first, dear. Rosa, here under the
weeping elm : you are not afraid of the girls who are making the
bed, I hope !"
“'I should rather hope not, indeed! Rue dear, my best love to
you. Do you think I'd keep a girl in the house I was afraid to see
through the window ?"
To prove her spirit, Mrs. Hutton tossed a glass of wine off,

although she seldom took it, and it was not twelve o'clock yet.
Rufus looked on with some dismay, till he saw she had got the
decanter.
“Well done, Rosa! What good it does me to see you take the
leastest little drop of wine ! You are bound now to obey me.
Roe, my love, your very best health, and that involves my own.
You're not heavy on my shoulder, love."
“No, dear, I know that : you are so very strong. But don't you
see the boy coming ? And that hole among the branches ! And
the leaves coming off too! Oh, do let me go in a moment, dear,
dear Rue !"
“ Confound that boy! I'm blest if he isn't always where he
shouldn't be."
The boy, however, or man as he called himself, though his warts
were not yet over, was far too important a personage in their
domestic economy to be confounded audibly: gardener, groom,
page, footman, knife-boy, and coachman, all in one; a long, loose,
knock-kneed, big-footed, what they would call in the forest a
“yaping, shammocking gally-bagger.” His name was Jonah, and
he came from Buckinghamshire, and had a fine drawl of his own,
quite different from that of Ytene, which he looked upon as a
dreadful barbarism.
“ Plase, sir, Maister Reevers ave a zent them traases as us
hardered.” Jonah's eyes, throughout this speech, which occupied
him at least a minute, were fixed upon the decanter, with ineffable
admiration at the glow of the wine now the sun was upon it.
“Then, Jonah, my boy," cried Rufus Hutton, all animation in a
moment, “I have a great mind to give you sixpence. Rosa, give
me another glass of sherry. Here's to the health of the king of the
fruit, the husband of Pomona-Rivers ! Most obliging of him to
send my trees so early, even before the leaves are off. Come along,
Roe, you love to see trees unpacked, and eat the fruit by anticipa-
tion. I believe you'll expect them to blossom and bear by Christ-
mas, as St. Anthony made the vines do."
Well, darling, and so they ought, with such a gardener as you
to manage them.-Jonah, you shall have a glass of wine, to drink
the health of the trees. He has never taken his eyes off the decanter,
ever since he came up, poor boy.”
Rosa was very good-natured, and accustomed to farm-house
geniality. Rufus laughed and whispered, "My love, my Indian
sherry !”
“Can't help it,” said Mrs. Hutton; “less chance of its disagreeing
with him. Here, Jonah, you won't mind drinking after your master."
“ Here be vaine health to all on us,” said Jonah, scraping the
gravel and putting up one finger as he had seen the militiamen do
in imitation of the regulars); "and may us nayver know no taime
warse than the prasent mawment.”

Hear, hear !" cried Rufus Hutton; "now, come along, and cut
the cords, boy."
Dr. Hutton set off sharply, with Rosa on his arm, for he did not
feel at all sure but that Jonah's exalted sentiment might elicit, at any
rate, half a glass more of sherry. They found the trees packed
beautifully; a long cone, like a giant lobster-pot, weighing nearly
two hundred-weight, thatched with straw, and wattled round, and
corded over that.
6 Out with your knife and cut the cords, boy."
“Well, Rufus, how extravagant !”-“Rather fine, that,” thought
Dr. Hutton, “after playing such pranks with my sherry!”—“Jonah,
I won't have a bit of the string cut. I want every atom of it.
What's the good of your having hands if you can't untie it?"
At last they got the great parcel open, and strewed all the
lawn with litter. There were trees of every sort, as tight as sar-
dines in a case, with many leaves still hanging on them, and the
roots tied up in moss : half a dozen standard apples; half a
hundred pyramid pears, the prettiest things imaginable, furnished
all round like a cypress, and thick with blossom-spurs; then young
wall-trees, two years' trained, tied to crossed sticks, and drawn up
with bast, like the frame of a schoolboy's kite; around the roots
and in among them were little roses in pots No. 60, wrapped in
moss, and webbed with bast; and the smell of the whole was
glorious.
“Hurrah !" cried Rufus, dancing, “no nurseries in the kingdom,
nor in the world, except Sawbridgeworth, could send out such a lot
of trees, perfect in shape, every one of them, and every one of them
true to sort. What a bore that I've got to go again to Nowelhurst
to-day, Rosa dear! every one of these trees ought to be planted
to-day. The very essence of early planting (which in my opinion
saves a twelvemonth) is never to let the roots get dry. These peach-
trees in a fortnight will have got hold of the ground, and be
thinking of growing again; and the leaves, if properly treated,
will ripen, instead of flagging. Oh, I wish you could see to it,
Rosa."
'Well, dear Rufus, and so I can. To please you, I don't mind
at all throwing aside my banner-screen, and leaving my letter to
cousin Magnolia.”
“No, no. I don't mean that. I mean, how I wish you under-
stood it.”
“ Understood it, Rue! Well, I'm sure! As if any body couldn't
plant a tree! And I, who had a pair of gardening gloves when I
was only that high !”
“ Roe, now listen to me. Not one in a hundred even of profes-
sional gardeners, who have been at it all their lives, knows how to
piant a tree.”
“Well, then, Rufus, if that is the case, I think it very absurd of

you to expect that I should know. But Jonah will teach me, I dare
say. I'll begin to learn this afternoon.”
No, indeed, you won't. At any rate, you must not practise on
my trees; nor in among them, either. But you may plant the
mop, dear, as often as you like -- you cannot have finer prac-
tice— in that empty piece oí ground where the cauliflowers were.”
Plant the mop, indeed! Well, Dr. Hutton, you had better ride
back to Nowelhurst, where all the grand people are, if you only
come home for the purpose of insulting your poor wife. It is there,
no doubt, that you learn to despise any one who is not quite so fine
as they are. And what are they, I should like to know? What a
poor weak thing I am, to be sure : no wonder no one cares for me.
I can have no self-respect. I am only fit to plant the mop.”
Hereupon the blue founts welled, the carmine of the cheeks
grew scarlet, the cherry lips turned bigarreaux, and a very becoming
fur-edged jacket lifted, as if with a zephyr stealing it.
Rufus felt immediately that he had been the lowest of all low
brutes; and almost made up his mind on the spot that it would be de.
cidedly wrong of him to go to Nowelhurst that evening. We will not
enter into the scene of violent repentance, strong self-condemnation,
reciprocal collaudation, extraordinary admiration, because all newly-
married people are pretty sure to know it ; and as for those who are
single, let them not get married and learn it. Only in the last act
of it, Jonah, from whom they had retreated, came up again, looking
rather sheepish—for he had begun to keep a sweetheart-and spake
these winged words :-
Plase, sir, if you be so good, it baint no vault o' maine nohow."
“Get all those trees at once laid in by the heels. What is no fault
of yours, pray? Are you always at your dinner ?”
“ Baint no vault o’mine, sir; but there coom two genelmen chaps,
as zays they musten zee you."
“Must see me, indeed, whether I choose it or no! And with all
those trees to plant, and the mare to be ready at four o'clock !”
“ Zo I told un, sir ; but they zays as they must zee you."
“In the name of the devil and all his works, but I'll give them a
bitter reception. Let them come this way, my boy.”
“Oh, dear, if you are going to be violent! You know what you are
sometimes, Rue-enough to frighten any man.”
Never, my darling, never. You never find Rufus Hutton
formidable to any one who means rightly.”
“No, no; to be sure, dear. But then, perhaps, they may not.
And after all that has occurred to-day, I feel so much upset. Very
foolish of me, I know. But promise me not to be rash, dear.”
“ Have no fear, my darling Rosa. I will never injure any man
who does not insult you, my dear.”
While Rufus was looking ten feet high, and Mrs. Rufus tripping
away, after a little word in a whisper, Jonah came pelting down the

walk with his great feet on either side of it, as if he had a barrow
between them. At the same time a voice rolled round the corner
past the arbutus-tree, now quivering red with strawberries, and the
words thereof were these :-
“Perfect Paradise, my good sir! I knew it must be, from what
I heard of him. Exactly like my friend the Dook’s, but laid out
much more tastefully. Bless me, it looks very much as if his Grace
had copied it! Won't I give him a poke in the ribs when he dines
with me next 'Toosday! Sly bird, a sly bird, I say, though he is
such a capital fellow. Knew where to come, I'm blest if he didn't,
for taste, true science, and landscape.”
“ Haw ! Yes; I quite agree with you. But his Grace has
nothing so chaste, so perfect as this, in me opeenion, sir. Haw!"
The cockles of the Rufine heart swelled warmly; for of course he
heard every word of it, though, of course, not intended to do so.
“Now Rosa ought to have heard all that,” was passing in his mind,
when two gentlemen stood before him, and were wholly amazed to
One of them was a short stout man, scarcely taller than
Rufus, but of double his cubic contents; the other a tall and portly
signor, fitted upon spindle shins, with a slouch in his back, grey
eyebrows, long heavy eyes, and large dewlaps.
The short gentleman, evidently chief spokesman and proud of
his elocution, waved his hat most gracefully, when he recovered
from his surprise, drew back for a yard or so, in his horror at in-
truding, and spoke with a certain flourish, and the air of a man
above humbug.
“Mr. Nowell Corklemore, I have the honour of making you
known to the gentleman whose scientific fame has roused such a
spirit among us. Dr. Hutton, sir, excuse me, the temptation was
too great for us. My excellent friend, Lord Thorley, who has, I be-
lieve, the honour of being related to Mrs. Hutton, pressed his ser-
vices upon us, when he knew what we desired. But, sir, no. 'My
lord,' said I,' we prefer to intrude without the commonplace of so-
ciety; we prefer to intrude upon the footing of common tastes, my
lord, and warm, though far more rudimental and vague pursuit of
science. Bless me, all this time my unworthy self, sir ! I am too
prone to forget myself, at least all who know me tell me so. Bailey
Kettledrum, sir, is my name, of Kettledrum Hall, in Dorset. And
I have the enlightenment, sir, to aspire to the honour of your
acquaintance."
Rufus Hutton bowed rather queerly to Mr. Nowell Corklemore
and Mr. Bailey Kettledrum ; for he had seen a good deal of the
world, and had tasted sugar-candy. Moreover, the Kettledrum
pattern was known to him long ago; and he had never found them
half such good fellows as they pretend to think other people.
Being, however, most hospitable, as are all men from India, he
invited them to come in at once, and have luncheon after their

man,
journey. They accepted very warmly; and Mrs. Hutton having
now appeared and been duly introduced, Bailey Kettledrum set off
with her round the curve of the grass-plot, as if he had known her
for fifty years, and had not seen her for twenty-five. He engrossed
her whole attention by incessancy of chattering, and appeals to her
opinion, praising all things, taking notes, red-hot with admiration,
impressively confidential about his wife and children, in a word, re-
gardless of expense to make himself agreeable. Notwithstanding
all this, he did not get on much, because he made one great mis-
take. He rattled and flashed along the high road leading to fifty
other places, but missed the quiet and pleasant path which leads to
a woman's good graces—the path which follows the little brook,
whose name to itself is “sympathy," a winding but not a shallow
brook, over the meadow of soft listening.
Mr. Nowell Corklemore, walking with Rufus Hutton, was, as he
was induced to be by a feeble nature enfeebled, a dry and pompous
“Haw! I am given to understand you have made all this your
self, sir. In me 'umble opeenion, it does you the greatest credit,
sir; credit, sir, no less to your heart than to your head. Haw!"
Here he pointed with his yellow bamboo at nothing at all in
particular.
“Every thing is in its infancy yet. Wait till the trees grow up a
little. I have planted nearly all of them. All except that, and that,
and the weeping elm over yonder, where I sit with my wife some-
times. Every thing is in its infancy.”
“Have you-haw! excuse my asking, for you are a great luminary
here--have you as yet made trial of the Spergula pilifera ?”
“Yes; and found it the biggest humbug that ever aped God's
grass."
Dr. Hutton was always very sorry when he had used strong lan.
guage ; but being a thin-skinned, irritable, cut-the-corner man, he
could not be expected to stand Nowell Corklemore's "haws."
“Haw-then-haw !--I have been given to understand that the
Spergula pilifera succeeds most admirably with people who have-
haw !-have studied it."
“Very likely it does," said Rufus, though he knew much better,
but now he was on his own door-step, and felt ashamed of his rude-
ness; “but come in, Mr. Corklemore; our ways are rough in these
forest outskirts, and we are behind you in civilization. Neverthe-
less, we are heartily glad to welcome our more intelligent neigh-
bours.”
At luncheon he gave them home-brewed ale and pale sherry of
no especial character. But afterwards, being a genial soul, and
feeling still guilty of rudeness, he went to the cellar himself and
fetched a bottle of the richest Indian gold. Mrs. Hutton withdrew
very prettily; and the three gentlemen, all good judges of wine,

began to warm over it luminously, more softly indeed than they
would have done after a heavy dinner. Surely noble wine deserves
not to be the mere operculum to a stupidly-mixed hot meal.
“Have another bottle, gentlemen : now do have another bottle."
“Not one drop more for the world,” exclaimed they both, with
their hands up. None the less for that, they did, and, what was
very unwise of them, another after that, until nobody in straight
lines may chronicle their doings. Meanwhile Jonah had prigged
three glassfuls out of the decanter now forgotten beneath the elm-
“Now,” said Rufus, who alone was almost in a state of sobriety,
suppose we take a turn in the garden and my little orchard-house?
I believe I am indebted to that for the pleasure of your very dis-
I mean most agreeable company to-day.”
So these three gentlemen went out, in a metaphysical condition,
which none but a narrow-minded man would call a “ state of
intoxication.”
“Now I will show you a thing, sir,” cried Rufus in his glory, “a
thing which has been admired by the leading men of the age. No-
where else, in this part of the world, can you see a piece of ground,
sir, cropped in the manner of that, I believe.”
And to tell the plain, unvinous truth, the square to which he
pointed was a triumph of high art. The style of it was wholly dif-
ferent from that of Mr. Garnet's beds. Bull Garnet was fond of
novelties, but he made them square with his system ; the result was
more strictly practical, but less nobly theoretical. Dr. Hutton, on
the other hand, gloried in great surprises; obstacles of soil and
season were as nothing to him, and when the shape of the ground
was wrong, he called in the navvies and made it right.
A plot of land four-square, and measured to exactly half an acre,
contained 2400 trees, cutting either way as truly as the spindles of
machinery ; there was no tree more than five feet high, the average
height was four feet six inches. They were planted just four feet
asunder, and two feet back from the pathway. There was every
kind of fruit-tree there which can be made by British gardeners to
ripen fruit in Britain, without artificial heat. Pears especially, and
plums, cherries, apples, walnuts (juglans præparturiens), figs, and
medlars, quinces, filberts, even peaches, nectarines, and apricots-
though only one row, in all, of those three; there was scarcely one
of those miniature trees which had not done its duty that year, or
now was bent upon doing it. Still the sight was beautiful ; although
far gone with autumn, still Cox's orange-pippin lit the russet leaves
with gold, or Beurré Clairgeau and Capiaumont enriched the air
with scarlet.
Each little tree looked so bright and comely, each plumed itself
so naturally, proud to carry its share of tribute to the beneficent
Maker, that the three men who had been abusing His choice gift,

the vine, felt a little ashamed of themselves, or perhaps felt that
they ought to be.
Magnificent, magnificent !" cried Kettledrum theatrically; "I
must tell the Dook of this. He will have the same next year.”
“Will he, though ?” said Rufus, thinking of the many hours he
had spent among those trees, and of his careful apprenticeship to
the works of their originator ; “I can tell you one thing. He won't,
unless he has a better gardener than I ever saw in these parts. Now
let us go to the orchard-house."
The orchard-house was a span-roofed building, very light and
airy; the roof and ends were made of glass, the sides of deal, with
broad falling shutters, for the sake of ventilation. It was about fifty
feet in length, twenty in width, and fifteen in height. There was no
ventilation at the ridge, and all the lights were fixed. The free air
of heaven wandered through, among peaches, plums, and apricots,
some of which still held their fruit, crimson, purple, and golden.
The little trees were all in pots, and about a yard apart. The pots
were not even plunged in the ground, but each stood, as a tub
should, on its own independent bottom. The air of the house was
soft and pleasant, with a peculiar fragrance, the smell of ripening
foliage. Bailey Kettledrum saw at once--for he had plenty of ob-
servant power, and the fumes of wine were dispersing—that this
house must have shown a magnificent sight, a month or two ago.
And having once more his own object in view, he tripled his true
approval.
“Dr. Hutton, this is fine. Fine is not the word for it; this is
grand and gorgeous. What a triumph of mind! What a lot you
must pay for wages ! ”
“ Thirteen shillings a week in summer, seven shillings a week in
the winter.” This was one of his pet astonishments.
“What! I'll never believe it. Sir, you must either be a con-
jurer, the devil, or-or-
“ Or a liar," said Rufus placidly ; " but I am none of the three.
Jonah has twelve shillings a week, but half of that goes for house-
work. That leaves six shillings for gardening ; but I never trust
him inside this house, for he is only a clumsy dolt, who does the
heavy digging. And besides him I have only a very sharp lad, at
seven shillings a week, who works under my own eye. I have in
some navvies, at times, it is true, when I make any alterations. But
that is outlay, not working expense. Now come and see my young
trees just arrived from Sawbridgeworth.”
“Stop one moment. What is this stuff on the top of the pots
here? What queer stuff! Why, it goes quite to pieces in my
hands."
“Oh, only a little top-dressing, just to refresh the trees a bit.
This way, Mr. Kettledrum.”
"Pardon me, Dr. Hutton, if I appear impertinent or inquisitive.

But I have learned so much this afternoon, that I am anxious to
learn a little more. My friend, the Dook, will cross-examine me as
to every thing I have seen here. He knew our intention of coming
I must introduce you to his Grace before you are a week
older, sir; he has specially requested it.”.
“ Indeed ! I am most proud to hear it.”
“But I don't believe a word of it, and don't believe you ever spoke
to him,” Dr. Hutton continued, below his breath, while his guests
went towards the stable; “neither of those fellows knows or cares
a rap for gardening ; I wonder what has brought them here, and
made them so amazingly affectionate and blarneysome ?"
“Wonderful, perfectly wonderful !” exclaimed Mr. Bailey Ket-
tledrum, as Rufus was showing them out at the gate, before having
his own horse saddled. “ The triumphs of horticulture in this age
are really past belief. You beat all of us, Dr. Hutton, you may
depend upon it; you beat all of us. I never would have believed
that trees ought to be planted with their heads down, and their
roots up in the air. Stupid of me, though, for I have often heard of
root-pruning, and of course you could not prune the roots unless
they grew in that way.”
Haw!” added Mr. Corklemore ; “I do declare it is a most
admirable idea !"
Rufus thought they were joking, or suffering from vinous inversion
of vision.
“Remember, my good friend Hutton-excuse my familiarity, I
feel as if I had known you for years-remember, my dear friend,
you have pledged your word for next Wednesday—and Mrs. Hut-
ton, too, mind - Mrs. Hutton with you. We waive formality, you
know, in these country quarters. Kettledrum Hall, next Wednes-
day-honour bright, next Wednesday! You see I know the motto
of your family."
Thank
you, all right,” said Rufus Hutton. Good-bye, good-
bye, and a pleasant ride to you! But I must know the meaning of
all this,” he exclaimed to himself as he went up the drive ; “I dare
say Rosa can tell me. Holloa ! I do declare! Well, I'm d-
I am done for at last at any rate !"
No wonder he was done for. He spied that strange phenomenon
which his visitors had taken in the purest faith. All those lovely
little trees, dwarf pyramids, &c., just received from Sawbridgeworth,
were standing on the apex. Jonah, after all the sherry given to and
stolen by him, had “laid them in by the heels.” with a vengeance.
All the pretty heads were a foot under ground, and the roots, like
the locks of a mermaid, wooing the buxom air.

CHAPTER XXV.
A RIDE IN THE FOREST.
THAT evening Dr. Hutton started, on his long, swift mare, for the
Hall at Nowelhurst, where he had promised to be that night. He
kissed his Rosa many times, and begged her pardon half as often, for
all the crimes that day committed. Her brother Ralph, from Fording-
bridge, who always slept there at short notice, because the house
was lonely, would be sure to come (they knew) when the little boy
Bob was sent for him. Ralph Mohorn-poor Rosa rejoiced in her
rather uncommon patronymic, though perhaps it means Cow-horn
-Ralph Mohorn was only too glad to come and sleep at Geophar-
macy Lodge. He was a fine, fresh-hearted fellow, only about nine-
teen years old ; his father held him hard at home, and of course he
launched out all the more abroad. So he kicked up, as he expressed
it, the devil's own dust,” when he got to the Lodge, ordered every
thing in the house for supper, with a bottle of whiskey afterwards
--which he never touched, only he liked the name of the thing-
and then a cardinal, or the biggest meerschaum to be found in any
of the cupboards. His pipe, however, was not, like his grog, a
phantom of the imagination ; for he really smoked it, and sat on
three chairs, while he “baited” Rosa, as he called it, with all the
bogeys in Christendom. It was so delicious now to be able to
throw her into a tremble, and turn her cheeks every colour, and
then recollect that a few years since she had smacked his own
cheeks ad libitum. However, we have little to do with him, and
now he is a jolly farmer.
Rufus Hutton rode through Ringwood over the low bridge where
the rushes rustle everlastingly, and the trout and dace for ever wag
their pellucid tails up stream. How all that water, spreading
loosely, wading over miles of meadows, growing leagues of reed and
rush, mistress of a world in winter, how it all is content to creep
through a pair of little bridges—matter of such mystery, let the
Christchurch salmon solve it. Dr. Hutton went gaily over-at
least his mare went gaily-but he was thinking (beyond his wont)
of the business he had in hand. He admired the pleasant old
town as he passed, and the still more pleasant waters; but his mare,
the favourite Polly, went on at her usual swing, until they came to
che long, steep hill towards the Picked Post. As he walked her up
the sharp parts of the rise, he began again to ponder the myste-
rious visit of those convivial strangers. It was very plain
neither of them knew or cared the turn of a trowel about the frank
art of gardening ; that, of course, was only a sham; then what did
they really come for ? Rufus, although from childhood upwards
he had been hospitable to his own soul, that is to say, regarded him-

a woman sees
self with genial approbation, was not by any means blindly con-
ceited, and could not suppose that his fame, for any thing except
gardening, had spread through the regions round about. So he felt
that his visitors had come, not for his sake, but their own. And it
was not long before he suspected that they wished to obtain through
him some insight, perhaps even some influence, into and in the
course of events now toward at Nowelhurst Hall. They had
altogether avoided the subject; which made him the more suspi-
cious, for at present it was of course the leading topic of the
county.
However, as they were related to the family, while he, Rufus Hut-
ton, was not, it was not his place to speak of the matter, but to let
his guests do as they liked about it. They had made him promise,
moreover, to dine with the Kettledrums on the very earliest day he
could fix-viz. the following Wednesday--and there he was to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Corklemore. Was it possible that they intended, and
perhaps had been instructed, to subject the guest on that occasion
to more skilful manipulation than that of their rude male fingers ?
“I'll take Rosa with me,” said Rufus to himself; “
a woman's game best; hough Rosa, thank Heaven, is not very
Machiavellian. How very odd that neither of those men had the
decency to carry a bit of crape, out of respect for that poor boy;
and I, who am noway connected with him, have been indued by
my Roe with a hatband !”
Shrewd as our friend Rufus was, he could not be charged with
low cunning, and never guessed that those two men had donned the
show of mourning, and made the most of it round their neighbour-
hood to impress people with their kinship to the great Nowells of
Nowelhurst, but that their guardian angels had disarrayed them ere
they started, having no desire to set Rufus thinking about their chance
of succession. As the sharp little doctor began to revolve all he had
heard about Corklemore, his mare came to the Burley-road, where
they must leave the turnpike. Good Polly struck into it, best foot
foremost, and, as she never would bear the curb well, her rider had
quite enough to do, in the gathering darkness, and on that cross-
country track, to attend to their common safety.
She broke froin the long stride of her trot into a reaching canter,
as the moon grew bright between the trees, and the lane was barred
with shadow. Pricking nervously her ears at every flaw or rustle,
bending her neck to show her beauty, where the light fell clear on
the moor-top, then with a snort of challenge plunging into the
black of the hollows, yet ready to jump the road and away, if her
challenge should be answered; bounding across the water gulley
and looking askance at a fern-shadow; then saying to herself, “ It
is only the moon, child,” and up the ascent half ashamed of herself;
then shaking her bridle with reassurance to think of that mile of
great danger flown by, and the mash and the warm stable nearer,

me !
and the pleasure of telling that great roan horse how brave she had
been in the moonlight-
Goodness me! What's that ?"
She leaped over road and roadside bank, and into a heavy gorse-
bush, and stood there quivering from muzzle to tail in the intensity
of terror. If Rufus had not just foreseen her alarm, and gripped
her with all his power, he must have lain senseless upon the road,
spite of all his rough-riding in India.
“Who-hoa, who-hoa, then, Polly, you little fool, you are killing
Can't you see it's only a lady?"
Polly still backed into the bush, and her unlucky rider, with every
prickle running into him, could see the whites of her eyes in the
moonshine, as the great orbs stood out with horror. Opposite to
them, and leaning against a stile which led to a footpath, there
stood a maiden dressed in black, with the moonlight sheer upon her
face. She took no notice of any thing; she had heard no sort of
footfall ; she did not know of Polly's capers, or the danger she was
causing. Her face, with the hunter's moon upon it, would have
been glorious beauty, but for the broad rims under the eyes, and
the spectral paleness. One moment longer she stared at the moon,
as if questing for some one gone thither, then turned away with a
heavy sigh, and went towards the Coffin Wood.
All this time Rufus Hutton was utterly blind to romance, being
scarified in the calf and thighs beyond any human endurance.
Polly backed further and further away from the awful vision before
her—the daughter of the horse-fiend at least-and every fresh
swerve sent a new lot of furze-pricks into the peppery legs of Rufus.
“ Hang it !” he cried, “ here goes ; no man with a ha’porth of
flesh in him could stand it any longer. Thorn for thorn, Miss
Polly.” He dashed his spurs deep into her flanks, the spurs he had
only worn for show, and never dared to touch her with. For a
moment she trembled, and reared upright in wrath worse than any
horror; then away she went like a storm of wind, headlong through
trees and bushes. It was all pure luck or Providence that Rufus
was not killed. He grasped her neck, and lay flat upon it ; he clung
with his supple legs around her ; he called her his Polly, his darling
Polly, and begged her to consider herself. She considered neither
herself nor him, but dashed through the wild wood, wilder herself,
not knowing light from - darkness. Any low beech branch, any
scrag holly, even a trail of loose ivy, and man and horse were done
for. The lights of more than a million stars flashed before Rufus
Hutton, and he made up his mind to die, and wondered how Rosa
would take it. Perhaps she would marry again, and rear up
another family who knew not the name of Hutton ; perhaps she
would cry her eyes out. Smack, a young branch took him in the
face, though he had one hand before it. “Go it again !” he cried,
with the pluck of a man despairing, and then he rolled over and

over, and dug for himself a rabbit-hole of sand, and dead leaves,
and moss.
There he lay on his back, and swooned, after luckily
letting go the bridle.
The mare had fallen, and grovelled in the rotten ground where
the rabbits lived ; then she got up and shook herself, and the stir-
rups struck fire beneath her, and she spread out all her legs, and
neighed for some horse to come and help her. She could not go
any further ; she had vented her soul, and must come to herself,
like a lady after hysterics. Presently she sniffed round a bit, and
the grass smelled crisp and dewy, and, after the hot corn and musty
hay, it was fresher than ice upon brandy. So she looked through:
the trees, and saw only a squirrel, which did not frighten her at all,
because she was used to rats. Then she brought her forelegs well
under her stomach, and stretched her long neck downwards, and
skimmed the wet blades with her upper lip, and found them per-
fectly wholesome. Every horse knows what she did then and there,
to a great extent, till she had spoiled her relish for supper.
After that she felt grateful and good, and it repented her of the
evil, and she whinnied about for the master who had outraged her
feelings so deeply. She found him still insensible, on his back, be-
neath a beech-tree, with six or seven rabbits, and even a hare, come
to see what the matter was. Then Polly, who had got the bit out of
her mouth, gave him first a poke with it, and then nuzzled him
under the coat-collar, and blew into his whiskers as she did at the
chaff in her manger. She was beginning to grieve and get very
uneasy, taking care not to step on him, and went round him ever
so many times, and whinnied into his ear, when either that or the
dollop of grass half chewed which lay on his countenance, revived
the great spirit of Rufus Hutton, and he opened his eyes and looked
languidly. He saw two inmense black
eyes
full upon him, tenderly
touched by the moonlight, and he felt a wet thing like a sponge
poking away at his nostrils.
“Polly,” he said, “oh, Polly, dear, how could you serve me so?
What will your poor mistress say ?”
Polly could neither recriminate nor defend herself; so she only
looked at him beseechingly, and what she meant was, Oh, do get
So Rufus arose, and dusted himself, and kissed Polly for forgive-
ness, and she, if she had only learned how, would have stooped like
a camel before him. He mounted, with two or three groans for his
back, and left the mare to her own devices to find the road again.
It was very pretty to see in the moonlight how carefully she went
with him, not even leaping the small water-courses, but feeling her
footing through them. And so they got into the forest-track, some
half-mile from where they had left it ; they saw the gleam of Bull
Garnet's windows, and knew the straight road to the Hall.

of supper.
expected; but kind John Rosedew came up from the parsonage to
keep Rufus Hutton company. So the two had all the great
dinner-
table to themselves entirely; Uncle John, as the old friend, sat at
the head, and the Doctor sat by his right hand.
Although there were few men in the world with the depth of
mind, and variety, the many-branching grace of thought, the
fruitage infinitely rich of genius and old reading, which made
John Rosedew's company a forest for to wander in and lose the way
in pleasure, Rufus Hutton, sore and stiff, and aching in the back,
thought he had rarely come across so very dry a parson,
Mr. Rosedew was not inclined to talk : he was thinking of his
Cradock, and he had a care of still sharper tooth-what had
happened to his Amy? He had come up much against his wishes,
only as a duty, on that dreary Saturday night, just that Dr. Hutton,
who had been so very active, might not think himself neglected.
The parson had dined four hours ago, but that made no difference to
him, for he scarcely knew when his dinner was over, and when it
was impending. Nevertheless he was human, for he loved his bit
Mr. Rosedew had laboured hard, but vainly, to persuade Sir
Cradock Nowell to send some or any message to his luckless son.
“No," he had answered ; "I will leave him to his sense of duty, as he
seems to be outside the influence of affection. If he had come to
me at once, I should have-well, I should have felt quite differently
towards him. But he shows so little consideration for me, and what
he has done to me-such heartless conduct shows how little he was
fit to be my dead boy's brother.”
Almost any good man other than Mr. Rosedew would have
managed to set this crooked matter straight, but the rector's sense
of justice was already somewhat outraged ; and feeling the delicacy
of his position as the host of Cradock Nowell, relying, moreover, as
good men do, on the power of natural affection, and perceiving a
certain change in the tone of Sir Cradock towards himself, he
thought it wiser to let time plead the cause he was only injuring.
And now to-night he was inclined to be silent and pre-occupied,
wondering whether he had done his best : but silence was a state
of the air at once uncongenial to Dr. Hutton, and repugnant to all
his finest theories of digestion. For lo, how all nature around us
protests against the Trappists, and the order of St. Benedict! See
how the cattle get together when they have dined in the afternoon,
and had their drink out of the river. Don't they flip their tails, and
snuffle, and grunt at their own fine sentiments, and all the while
they are chewing the cud take stock of one another ? Don't they
discuss the asilus and cestrum, the last news of the rinderpest, and
the fly called by some the cow-dab, and don't they abuse the festuca
tribe, and the dyspepsia of the sorrel ? Is the thrush mute
when he has bolted his worm, or the robin over his spider's eggs?

CRADOCK NOWELL.
So Rufus looked through his glass of port, which he took merely
as a corrective to the sherry of the morning, cocked one eye first,
and then the other, and loosed the golden bands of speech.
Uncommonly pretty girls, Mr. Rosedew, all about this neigh-
bourhood.”
“Very likely, Dr. Hutton ; I see many pleasant faces; but I am
no judge of beauty." He leaned back with an absent air, just as if
he knew nothing about it. And all the while he was saying to
himself,“ Pretty girls indeed! Is there one of them like my Amy?”
“A beautiful girl I saw to-night. But I don't wish to see much
more beauty in that way. Nearly cost me my life, I know You
are up in the classics so : what is it we used to read at school?-
Helene, Helenaus, Helip-something-teterrima belli causa fuit.
Upon my word, I haven't talked so much Latin and Greek-have
another glass of port, just for company; the dry vintage of '34
can't hurt any body." John Rosedew took another glass, for his
spirits were low, and the wine was good, and the parson felt then
that he ought to have more confidence in God. Then he brought
his mind to bear on the matter, and listened very attentively while
the doctor described, with a rush of warm language and plenteous
exaggeration, the fright of his mare at that mournful vision, the
vision itself, and the consequences.
Sir, you must have ridden like a Centaur, or like Alexander.
What will Mrs. Hutton say? But are you sure that she leaped an
oak-tree ?”
“Perfectly certain," said Rufus gravely, “clean through the fork
of the branches, and the acorns rattled upon my hat like the hail of
the Himalaya."
Remarkable ! Most remarkable !"
“ But you have not told me yet,” continued Dr. Hutton,
" although I am sure that you know, who the beautifulyoung lady is."
“From your description, and the place, though I have not heard
that they are in mourning, I think it must have been Miss
Garnet.”
“Miss Garnet! What Miss Garnet? Not Bull Garnet's daughter!
I never heard that he had one."
Yes, he has, and a very nice girl. My Amy knows a little of her.
But he does not allow her to visit much, and is most repressive to
her. Unwise, in my opinion : not the way to treat a daughter ;
one should have confidence in her, as I have in my dear child."
Oh, you have confidence in Miss Rosedew; and she goes out
whenever she likes, I suppose ?".
“Of course she does,” said the simple rector, wondering at the
question ; "that is, of course, whenever it is right for her."
“Of which, I suppose, she herself is the judge.”
Why, no, not altogether. Her aunt has a voice in the matter
always, and a very potent one."

A RIDE IN THE FOREST.
125
“ And, of course, Miss Rosedew, managed upon such enlightened
principles, never attempts to deceive you?”
Amy! my Amy deceive me !” The rector turned pale at the
very idea. “But these questions are surely unusual from a gentleman
whom I have known for so very short a time. I am entitled, in
turn, to ask what reason you have in putting them.” Mr. Rosedew,
never suspecting indignities, could look very dignified.
“ I'm in for it now," thought Rufus Hutton; "what a fool I am !
I fancied the old fellow had no nous, except for Latin and Greek.”
Strange to say, the old fellow had nous enough to notice his
hesitation. Mr. Rosedew got up from his chair, and stood looking
at Rufus Hutton.
“Sir, I will thank you to tell me exactly what you mean about my
daughter."
'Nothing at all, Mr. Rosedew. What do you suppose I should
mean?"
“You should mean nothing at all, sir. But I believe that you
do
mean something. And you will not leave this room until you tell
me what you do mean.” Rufus Hutton said afterwards that he had
two great frights that evening, and he believed the last was the
worst. The parson never dreamed that any man could be afraid
of him, except it were a liar, and he looked upon Rufus con-
temptuously. The man of the world was nothing before the man
of truth.
“Mr. Rosedew," said Rufus, recovering himself, “ your conduct
is very extraordinary; and (you will excuse my saying it) more
violent than becomes a man of your position and character.”
“ No violence becomes any man, whatever his position. I am
sorry if I have been violent.”
“You have indeed,” said Ruſus, pushing his advantage : a
generous man would have said, “No, you haven't,” at seeing the
parson's distress, and so would Rufus have said, if he had happened
to be in the right; “so violent, Mr. Rosedew, that I believe you
almost frightened me.”
“Dear me !” said John, reflecting, “and he has just leaped an
oak-tree! I must have been very bad.”
“Don't mention it, my dear sir, 1 entreat you say no more about it.
We all know what a father is.” And Rufus Hutton, who did not
yet, but expected to know in some three months, grew very large,
and felt himself able to patronize the rector. “ Mr. Rosedew, I as
well am to blame. I am thoughtless, sir, very thoughtless, or rather
I should say too thoughtful; I am too fond of seeing round a
corner, which I have always been famous for. Sir, a man who
possesses this power, this gift, this—I don't know the word for it,
but I have no doubt you do--that man is apt to-I mean to-
“Knock his head against a wall ?” suggested the parson, in all
good faith.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“ No, you mistake me; I don't mean that at all; I mean that a
man with this extraordinary foresight, which none can understand
except those who are gifted with it, is liable sometimes, is amenable--
I mean toto
“ See double. Ah, yes, I can quite understand it." Mr. Rosedew
shut his eyes, and felt up for a disquisition, yet wanted to hear of his
daughter.
“No, my dear sir, no. It is something very far from any thing
so common-place as that. What I mean is--only I cannot
express it, because you interrupt me so—that a man may have this
faculty, this insight, this perception, which saves him from taking
offence where none whatever is meant, and yet, as it were by some
obliquity of the vision, may seem, in some measure, to see the
wrong individual.”
“That is an interesting question, and reminds me of the state of
åppepía, as described in the life of Pyrrho by Diogenes Laertius;
whose errors, if I may venture to say it, have been made too much
of by the great Isaac Casaubon, then scarcely mature of judgment.
It will give me the greatest pleasure to go into that question with
you. But not just now. I am thrown out so sadly, and my memory
fails me”-john Rosedew had fancied this, by-the-by, ever since
he was thirty years old—“only tell me one thing, Dr. Hutton, and
I am very sorry for my violence ; you meant no harm about my
daughter?” Here the grey-haired man, with the mighty forehead,
opened his clear blue eyes, and looked down upon Rufus beseech-
ingly
Upon my honour as a gentleman, I mean no harm whatever.
I made the greatest mistake, and I see the mistake I made.”
“Will you tell me, sir, what it was? Just to ease my mind. I
am sure that you will."
“No, I must not tell you now, until I have worked the matter
out. You will thank me for not doing so. But I apologize most
heartily. I feel extremely uncomfortable. No claret, sir, but the
port, if you please, I was famous, in India, for my nerve; but now
it seems to be failing me."
Rufus, as we now perceive, had fully discovered his mistake, and
was trying to trace the consequences. The beautiful girl whom he
saw in the wood, that evening, with Clayton Nowell, was not our
Amy, as he had felt sure, but Mr. Garnet's daughter. He knew
the face, though changed and white, when it frightened his mare
in the moonlight : and, little time as he had to think, it struck him
then as very strange that Miss Rosedew should be there. Bull
Garnet's cottage, on the other hand, was not far away in the
hollow.

CHAPTER XXVI.
THE FATHER AND THE SON.
Ar this melancholy time Mr. Rosedew had quite enough to do
without any burden of fresh anxieties about his own pet Amy.
Nevertheless that burden was added, not by Dr. Hutton's vague
questions, although they helped to impose it, but by the father's own
observation of his darling's strange condition. “ Can it be,” he
asked himself, and often longed to ask her, as he saw only lilies
where roses had been, and little hands trembling at breakfast-time,
can it be that this child of mine loved the poor boy Clayton, and
is wasting away in sorrow for him? Is that the reason why she
will not meet Cradock, nor Cradock meet her, and she trembles even
at his name? Well, if it truly is so, there is nothing to be done,
except to be unusually kind to her, and trust to time for the cure,
and give her plenty of black-currant jam.”
These ideas he imparted to the good Aunt Doxy, who delivered
some apophthegms (which he did not want to listen to), but undertook,
whatever should happen, to be down upon Amy sharply. She
knew all about her tonsils and her uvula, and all those things, and
she did not want John's advice, though she had never had a family;
and no doubt it was ordered wisely.
On Monday, when poor Clayton's funeral came winding its
way to the churchyard, Mr. Rosedew felt his heart give way, and
could not read the service. At the risk of deeply offending Sir
Cradock, whose nerves that day were of iron, he passed the surplice
to his curate, Mr. Pell, of Rushford; and begged him, with a
sad, slow smile, to do the duty for him. Sir Cradock Nowell
frowned, and coloured, and then bowed low with an icy look, when
he saw the change which had been made, and John Rosedew fall
in as a mourner. People said that from that day the old friendship
was dissevered.
John, for his part, could not keep his eyes from a nook of the
churchyard where among the yew-trees stood, in the bitterness of
anguish, he who had not asked nor been asked to attend as
Cradock bowed his head and wept, for now his tears
came freely, and prayed the one Almighty Father, who alone has
mercy, not to take his misery from him, but to take him from it.
When the mould was thrown upon the coffin, black Wena came

sympathies, turned away his face, and could not go on without a
jujube.
That evening, when all was over, and the grave heaped snugly
up, and it was time to think of this world, and only dream of the
other, John Rosedew went to Sir Cradock Nowell, not only as a
fellow-mourner and a friend of ancient days, but as a minister of
Christ. It had cost him many struggles after his last reception ;
and what with his sense of worldly favours, schoolday-friendship,
delicacy, he could scarce tell what to make of it, till he just went
down on his knees and prayed; then the learned man learned his
duty.
Sir Cradock turned his head away, as if he did not want him.
The parson held out his hand, and said nothing.
“ Mr. Rosedew, I am surprised to see you. And yet, John, this
is kind of you.”
John hoped that he only said “Mr. Rosedew” because the foot-
man was lingering, and he tried not to feel the difference.
“ Cradock, you know what I am, as well as I know what you are.
Fifty years, my dear fellow, fifty years of friendship.”
Yes, John, I remember when I was twelve years old, and you
fought Sam Cockings for me.”
And, Cradock, I thrashed him fairly; you know I thrashed him
fairly. They said I got his head under the form ; but you know it
was all a lie. How I do hate lies! I believe it began that day.
If so, the dislike is subjective. Perhaps I ought to reconsider
it."
“John, I know nothing in your life which you ought to reconsider,
except what you are doing now.”
Sir Cradock Nowell began the combat, because he felt that it
must be waged; and perhaps he knew in that beginning that he
had the weaker cause.
Cradock, I am doing nothing beyond my simple duty.
When I see those I love in the deepest distress, can I help trying
to help them?”
Upon that principle, or want of it, you might espouse, as a duty,
the cause almost of a murderer."
The old man shuddered, and his voice shook, as he whispered
that last word. As yet he had not worked himself up, nor been
worked up by others, to the black belief which made the living lost
beyond the dead.
“ I am sure I don't know what I might do,” said Mr. Rosedew,
simply,“ but what I am doing now is right ; and in your heart
you know it. Come,
as an old man now, and one whom
God has visited, forgive your poor, your noble son, who never will
forgive himself."
But for one word in that speech, perhaps Mr. Rosedew might
have won, and reconciled son and father.

My 'noble? son indeed, John! A very noble thing he has
done. Shall I never hear the last of that great nobility ? And
who ever called my Clayton noble ? You have been unfair
throughout, John Rosedew, most unfair and blind to the merits of
my more loving, more simple-hearted, more truly noble boy, I tell
you."
Mr. Rosedew, at such a time, could not of course contest the
point, could not tell the bereaved old man that it was he himself
who had been unfair.
“And when,” asked Sir Cradock, getting warmer, “when did
you know my poor boy Violet stick up for political opinions of his
own at the age of twenty, want to drain tenants' cottages, and
pretend to be better and wiser than his father ?”
“And when have you known Cradock do, at any rate, the
latter?"
“Ever since he got that scholarship, that Scotland thing at
Oxford”—Sir Cradock knew the name well enough, as every Oxford
man does—"he has been perfectly insufferable ; such arrogance,
such conceit, such airs ! And he only got it by a trick. Poor Viley
ought to have had it."
Mr. Rosedew tried to control himself, but the gross untruth
and injustice of that last accusation were a little too much for
him.
“ Perhaps, Sir Cradock Nowell, you will allow that I am a com.
petent judge of the relative powers of the two boys, who knew all
they did know from me, and from no one else."
“Of course, I know you are a competent judge, only blinded by
partiality.”
The parson allowed even that to go by.
“Without any question of preference, simply as a lover of litera-
ture, I say that Clayton had no chance with him in a Greek exami-
nation. In Latin he would have run him close. You know I
always said so, even before they went to college. I was surprised,
at the time, that they mentioned Clayton even as second to
him.”
“And grieved, I dare say, deeply grieved, if the truth were
told !”
“ It is below me to repel mean little accusations."
"Come, John Rosedew," said Sir Cradock, magnanimously and
liberally, “ I can forgive you for being quarrelsome, even at such a
time as this. It always was so, and I suppose it always will be. To-day
I am not fit for much, though perhaps you do not know it. Thinking
so little of my dead boy, you are surprised that I should grieve for
him."
“ I should be surprised indeed if you did not. God knows even
I have grieved deeply, as for a son of my own.”
“Shake hands, John ; you are a good fellow—the best fellow in

the world. Forgive me for being petulant. You don't know how
my heart aches. I hide it even from you, John Rosedew.”
After that it was impossible to return for the moment to Cradock
Nowell. But the next day Mr. Rosedew took advantage of some
opening, and at length obtained a request from the father that his
son should come to him.
By this time Cradock hardly knew when he was doing any thing,
and when he was doing nothing. He seemed to have no regard
for any one, no concern about any thing, least of all for himself.
Even his love for Amy Rosedew had a pall thrown over it, and lay
upon the trestles. The only thing he cared at all for was his
father's forgiveness : let him get that, and then go away and be
seen no more among them. He could not think, or feel surprise, or
fear, or hope for any thing; he could only tell himself all day long,
that if God were kind He would kill him. A young life wrecked, so
utterly wrecked, and through no fault of its own ; unless (as some
begin to dream) we may not slay for mere luxury ; unless we have
but a limited right to destroy our Father's property.
Sir Cradock Nowell, as may have been seen, cared a great deal
more for his children than he did for his ancestors. His over-
powering sorrow left him listless to take into thought what other
people said of him. In the first little trouble about the heirship,
this had been one chief element; but now such trifles sank out of
sight in the gulf of real misery.
So now he sat in his carved oak-chair, expecting his only son,
and he tried to sit upright. But the flatness of his back was gone,
never to return; and the shoulder-blades showed through his coat,
like a spoon left under the tablecloth. Still he appeared a stately
man, one not easily bowed by fortune, or at least very slow to
acknowledge it.
Young Cradock entered his father's study, with a flush on his
cheeks, which had been so pale, and his heart strung up for any
thing, but his wits going round like a swirl of leaves. He could
not tell what he might say or do. Only it seemed to make little
difference what he said or what he did. Trying in vain to master
his thoughts, he stood with his quivering hands clasped hard, and
his chin upon his breast.
So perhaps Adrastus stood, Adrastus son of Gordias, before the
childless Croesus; and the simple words are these :-
After this there came the Lydians carrying the corpse. And
behind it followed the slayer. And standing there before the
corpse, he gave himself over to Cresus, stretching forth his hards,
commanding to slay him upon the corpse, telling both his own
former stress, and how upon the top of that he had destroyed his
cleanser, nor was his life now liveable. Cræsus, having heard
these things, though being in so great a trouble of the home, has
compassion on Adrastus.

THE FATHER AND THE SON.
131
“But Adrastus, son of Gordias, son of Midas, this man, I say,
who had been the slayer of his womb-brother, and slayer of him
that cleansed him, when there became around the grave a quietude
from men, feeling that he was of all men whom he had ever seen
the most over-burdened with disaster, kills himself dead upon the
tomb."
But the father now was not like Cresus, that grand-hearted
Lydian, although the youth who stood before him, instead of a
runagate from Phrygia, was the son of his own loins.
We all may have felt that chill of the ribs, that icy interception,
which crawls between us and our very dearest, now and then
perhaps. It is not mere mistrust, misprision, or the fear of being
left behind by younger people. Is it one of those caprices of pure
contradiction which our nature still insists on, every now and then,
to show that she will have absolute though irrational command of us?
Be that as it may, the father, at the first sight of his son, felt (to
his own surprise, perhaps) a cold repulsion overcoming all that
sympathy and yearning which a father should have felt. A sudden
shudder ran through his frame, and his first glance was not at the
eyes, but at the hands of the luckless boy.
Cradock saw it, as we see things without looking at them, at
times of rigid tension ; and a horrible idea made him dread thence-
forth his father's eyes. “He is looking for my brother's blood ;
and he will always look for it.”
Having this idea thus, he could not think it even strange or
indifferent on his father's part that no hand was held out to
him.
“I never must dream of that again," was all the wrong he felt of
it. Then he could not wait any longer ; but spoke in a hollow and
trembling voice,
“Father, I am here. I came as soon as I got your order.”
"That was very good of you. But you might have come without
orders.”
“Oh, father, I can never tell you, how I have tried, and tried, and
dreaded
“Dreaded to come near me. Yes, you have always found me
harsh to you."
“You would not speak like that to me, sir, if you only knew my
misery.”
These last words were uttered in such a tone of more than misery, of
despair, that the father's heart was touched, even through that cold,
repellent barrier which a mother's heart would have scouted. He
looked at the lad who once had been the idol of his pride and joy
(until the less straightforward child by softer manners ousted him)
and there he saw on that young face the stamp of anguish such as
at his owr, age was impossible. The lines beneath the old man's eyes
now twitched and quivered slightly, and, like breath on glass, a

dimness fitted on his eyeballs ; but his lips were firm as ever, and
no tear came forth to help him.
It was the turning-point of young life, hope, and welfare to the
one, to the other the hinge of happiness in the old days yet to come,
of consolation still abiding, and of re-established pride, and, best of
all, a heart to love him.
Sir Cradock threw away the whole. As bravely as a man of
thirty tears away some little flirt unworthy of his manhood, this
punished man, in his declining years, made choice to cast away
his son, and treble his own punishment. He had always been proud
of his firmness; and now this pride (which grows as snake-wood
does, by knotting outward yearly) was beginning to harden into a
crooked, inveterate obstinacy.
There is no need to tell the rest, or dwell on little quick turns of
manner, and quicker turns of feeling. It is enough to say that
Cradock, having every nerve alive, and every fibre sensitive, saw
and heard, and felt, and fancied plenty to convince him that his
father slightly hated him.
No great depth of hate, of course, for that would be wasted on
a man so hated of God as he was; but only a quiet dislike, which
now had been growing perceptibly for years, and was quickened
into hatred by his destruction of the true darling.
The youth inherited no little of his father's pride, only of a
higher order, and a wider justice. In the full strength of this
righteous pride, he rose for the first time like a man, since his
great calamity, bowed to his father, and asked to be let go, if he were
done with.
From that day forth he walked the earth again with an upward
countenance, as one in early prime severely visited of heaven, and
humbled; but facing now his fellow-men, and not abashed by
affliction.
CHAPTER XXVII.
'TIS A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO TURNING.
With an even step, and no frown on his forehead, nor glimpse
of a tear in his eyes, young Cradock walked to his own little room,
his “nest,” as he used to call it ; where pipes, and books, and
Oxford prints-no ballet-girls, however, and not so very many
hunters-and whips, and foils, and boxing-gloves and sundry other
of youth's delights, were handled more often than dusted. All these
things, except one pet little pipe, which he was now come to look

for, and which Viley had given him a year ago, when they swopped
pipes on their birthday (like Diomed and the brave Lycian), all
the rest were things of a bygone age, to be thought of no more for
ever in the stern life set before him. After a few sad glances
round, and one or two sighs which he proudly cut short as soon
as he detected them, Cradock proceeded with great equanimity to
do a very foolish thing, which augured badly for the success of a
young man just preparing to start in the world. He poured the
entire contents of his purse into a little cedar tray, then packed all
the money in paper rolls with a neatness which rather astonished
him, and sealed each roll with his amethyst ring. Then he put
them into a little box of some rare and beautiful palm-wood, which
had been his mother's, laid his cheque-book beside them (for he
had been allowed a banking account long before he was of age),
and placed upon that his gold watch and chain, and trinkets, the
amethyst ring itself, his diamond studs, and other jewellery, even a
locket which had contained two little sheaves of hair, bound
together with golden thread, but from which he first removed, and
packed in silver paper, the fair hair of his mother. This last, with
the pipe which Clayton had given him, and the empty purse made
by Amy's fingers, were all he meant to carry away, besides the
clothes he wore.
After locking the box and writing a letter with a hand as firm as
a copying-press,he rang the bell, and begged the man who answered
it to send old Hogstaff to him. That faithful servant, from whom
he had learned so many lessons of infancy, came tottering along
the passage, with his old eyes dull and heavy. For Job had
gloried in those two brothers, and loved them both as the children
of his elder days. And now one of them was gone for ever, in the
height of his youth and beauty, and a whisper was in the household
that the other was likely to leave them. Of him, whom Job had
always looked upon as his future master (for he meant to outlive
the present Sir Cradock, as he had done the one before him), he
had just been scoring upon his fingers all the things he had taught
him—to whistle " Spankadillo,” while he drummed it with his
knuckles ; to come to the pantry-door, and respond to the “Who's
there?"-"A grenadier !" shouldering a broomstick; to play on
the Jew's harp with variations, “ An old friend, and a bottle to give
him ;" and then to uncork the fictitious bottle with the pop of his
forefinger out of his mouth, and to decant it carefully with the pat
of his gurgling cheeks ! After all that, how could he believe Master
Crad could ever forsake him?
Now Mr. Hogstaff's legs were getting like the ripe pods of a
scarlet-runner (although he did not run much); here they stuck in,
and there they stuck out, abnormally in either case; his body began
to come forward as if warped at the small of the back; and his
honest face (though he drank but his duty) was September'd with

many a vintage. And yet, with the keenness of love and custom,
he saw at once what the matter was, as he looked up at the young
master.
“Oh, Master Crad, dear Master Crad, whatever are you going toº
do ? Don't, for good now, don't, I beg on you. Hearken now;
do'ee hearken to an old man for a minute." And he caught him by
both arms to stop him, with his tremulous, wrinkled hands.
“O Hoggy, dear, kind Hoggy ! you are almost the only one left
to care about me now."
No, don't you say that, Master Crad ; don't you say that, whata
ever you do. Whoever tell you that, tell a lie, sir. It was only last
night, Mrs. Toaster, and cook, and Mrs. O'Gaghan, the Irish-
woman, was round the fire boiling, and they cried a deal more than
they boiled, I do assure you they did, sir. And Mr. Stote, he come in
with some rabbits, and he went on like mad. And the maids, so
sorry every one of them, they can't be content with their mourning,
sir; I do assure you they can't. Oh, don't ’ee do no harm to your-
self, don't 'ee, Mr. Cradock, sir.”
No, Hoggy,” said Cradock, taking his hands; "you need not
fear that now of me. I have had very wicked thoughts, but God
has helped me over them. Henceforth I am resolved to bear my
trouble like a man. I will not be like a dog who runs when the
hoot begins behind him. Now take this little box, and this key,
and letter, and give them yourself to Sir Cradock Nowell; but not
till to-morrow morning. It is the last favour I shall ask of you.
I
am going away, my dear old friend ; don't keep me now, for I must
go. Only give me your good wishes ; and see that they mind poor
Caldo : and whatever they say of me behind my back, you won't
believe it, Job Hogstaff, will you
u?"
Job Hogstaff had never been harder put to it in all his seventy
years. Then, as he stood at the open door to see the last of his fa-
vourite, he thought of the tall, dark woman's words so many years
ago : “A bonnie pair ye have gat; but ye'll ha' no luck o' them.
Tak’ the word of threescore year, ye'll never get no luck o’’em.”
Cradock turned aside from his path, to say good-bye to Caldo.
It would only take just a minute, he thought, and of course he
should never see him again. So he went to that snuggest and
sweetest of kennels, and in front of it sat the king of dogs.
The varieties of canine are quite as manifold and distinct as those
of human nature. But the dog, be he saturnine or facetious, sociable
or contemplative, mercurial or melancholic, is quite sure to be one
thing-true and loyal ever. Can we, who are less than the dogs of
the Infinite, say as much of ourselves to Him? Now Caldo, as
has been implied, if not expressed before, was a setter of large
philosophy and rare reflective power. It was, of course, theoretical
more than practical philosophy, as any dog would soon have dis-
covered who tried to snatch a bone from him. Moreover, he had

'TIS A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO TURNING. 135
some originality, and a turn for satire. He would sit sometimes by
the hour, nodding his head impressively, and blinking first one eye
and then the other, watching and considering the doings of his fél-
low-dogs. How fashionably they yawned and stretched, in a mode
they had learned from a pointer, who was proud of his teeth and
vertebræ ; how they hooked up their tails for a couple of joints, and
then let them fall at a right angle, having noticed that fashion in
ladies' bustles, when they came on a Sunday to talk to them ; how
they crawled on their stomachs to get a pat, as a provincial mayor
does for knighthood ; how they sniffed at each other's door, with an
eye to the rotten bones under the straw, as we all smell about for
the wealthy; how their courtesy to one another flowed from their
own convenience—these, and a thousand other dog-tricks, Caldo,
dwelling apart, observed, but did not condemn, for he felt that
every one of them was his own.
Now he hushed his bark of joy, and looked up wistlully at his
master, for he knew by the expression of his face that things were
not as they ought to be. Why had Wena snapped at him so, and
avoided his society, though he had always been so good to her, and
even thought of an alliance? Why did his master order him home
that dull night in the covert, when he was sure he had done no
harm? Above all, what meant that moving blackness he had seen
through the trees quite lately, when the other dogs (muffs as they
were) expected a regular battue, and came out strong at their kennel
doors, and barked for young Clayton to fetch them?
So he looked up now in his master's face, and guessed that it
meant a long farewell, perhaps a farewell for ever. He took a fond
look into his eyes, and his own pupils told great volumes. Then he
sat up, and begged for a minute or two, with a most beseeching
glance, to share his master's fortunes, though he might have to steal
his livelihood, and never get any shooting. Seeing that this could
never be, he planted his fore-paws on Cradock's breast (though he
felt that it was a liberty) and nestled his nose right under his cheek,
and wanted to keep him thus ever so long. Then he howled with a
low, enduring despair, as the footfall he loved grew fainter.
Looking back sadly, now and then, at the tranquil home of his
childhood, whose wings, and gables, and depths of stone reposed
in the autumn sunset, Cradock Nowell went his way toward the
simple Rectory; he would say good-bye there to Uncle John and
the kind Aunt Doxy ; Miss Rosedew the younger, of course, would
avoid him, as she had done ever since that day. But suddenly he
could not resist the strange desire to see once more the scene of
his ruin and despair—the "bidental' of his destiny. So he struck
into a side-path leading to the deep and bosky covert.
The long shadows fell from the pale birch stems, the hollies
looked black in the sloping light, and the brown leaves fluttered
down here and there as the cold wind set the trees shivering. Only

ten days ago, with the very same shadows falling thus, here had ho
slain his twin-brother. He crawled up the hedge through the very
same gap, for he could not leap it now; his back ached with weak-
ness, his heart with despair, as he stayed himself by the sanie hazel.
branch which had struck his gun at the muzzle. Then he shivered,
as the trees did, and his hair, like the brown leaves, rustled, as he
knelt and prayed that his brother's spirit might appear there and
forgive him. Hoping and dreading to see something, and with
every nerve on the tingle, into the deep dark wood he dropped, and
forced himself to face it.
All at once his heart stood still, and the fibres of his flesh went
creeping. He saw a tall, white figure kneeling where his brother's
blood was-kneeling, never moving, the hands together as in prayer,
the face as wan as shadow-land, the black hair-if it were hair-
falling in a curve away, like a pall, when the bearers lift it. The
power of the entire form was not of earth, nor heaven; but as of the
intermediate state, when the angels have not come for us.
Cradock did not think nor breathe. Every spring or pulse of life
stood still, and could not feel itself. It showed him in the after
time, when he came to think about it, the ignorance, the insolence,
of dreaming that any man's despair can quit him of man's cowardice.
While he gazed, and would have gazed at least five minutes
longer, with the deepest interest in gazing at the world beyond the
grave, the tall, white figure threw its arms up to the darkening sky,
rose, and vanished instantly.
What do you think Cradock Nowell did? We all know what he
ought to have done. He ought to have walked up calmly, with
measured yet rapid footsteps, and his eyes and wits well about him,
and investigated every thing. Instead of that, he cut and ran as
hard as he could go. No tidier pair of heels was ever shown to the
glades of the forest. He would never turn back upon living man;
but our knowledge of Hades is limited. We pray for angels around
our bed ; if they came, should we call them nightmares ?
Now Cradock, going at a desperate pace, with a handsome pair
of legs, which had recovered their activity, kicked up something
hard and bright from a little dollop of leaves, caught it in his hand
! like a tennis-ball, and leaped the hedge slap-dash anyhow. Away
he went, without stopping to think, through the splashy sides of the
i spire-bed, almost as fast, and quite as terrified, as Dr. Hutton's mare
i herself.
When he got well out into the chase, he turned, and began to
laugh at himself almost; but a great white owl flapped over a
furze-bush, and away went Cradock as fast as ever. The light had
gone out very suddenly, as it often does in October, and the youth
(whose wind was uncommonly good) felt it his duty to keep good
hours at the Rectory. So, with the bright thing, whatever it was,
poked any where into his pocket, he came up the drive at early tea-
time, and got a glimpse through the window of Amy.

'TIS A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO TURNING. 137
“It could not have been Amy, at any rate,” he said to himself, in
extinction of some very vague ideas; “I defy her to come at the
pace I have done. No, no; it must have been in answer to my
desperate prayer.”
Amy was gone, though her cup was there, when Cradock entered
the drawing-room. “Well,” he thought, “ how hard-hearted she is !
But it cannot matter now much. Though I never believed she
would be so."
Being allowed by his kind entertainers to do exactly as he pleased,
poor Cradock had led the life of a hermit more than that of a guest
among them. He had taken what little food he wanted in the garret
he had begged for, or carried it with him into the woods, where
most of his time was spent.. Of course all this was very distressing
to the hospitable heart of Miss Doxy; but her brother John would
have it so, for so he had promised Cradock. And though he would
never encourage the lad to nurse his trouble, and hide away, as if a
ban were over him, he knew that time and change of scene alone
could shift the heavy burden—the overpowering sense that all who
met him thought of what he had done.
So it came to pass that Miss Rosedew, who now sat alone in the
drawing-room, was surprised as well as pleased at the entrance of
their refugee. As he hesitated a moment, in doubt of his reception,
she ran up at once, took both his hands, and kissed him on the
forehead.
“Oh, Cradock, my dear boy, this is kind of you; most kind, in-
deed, to come and tell me at once of your success. I need not ask
-I know by your face; the first bit of colour I have seen in your
poor cheeks this many a day.”
“That's because I have been running, Miss Rosedew.”
“Miss Rosedew, indeed; and now, Cradock! Aunt Eudoxia, if
you please, or Aunt Doxy, with all my heart, now.”
He used to call her so, to tease her, in the happy days gone by ;
and she loved to be teased by him, her hero, her pet, and idol.
“Dear Aunt Eudoxia, my father never again will be able to
endure the sight of me.”
I cannot believe it, I will not believe it; obstinate as Sir Cradock
he cannot be so cruel as that. You must place your trust in
e goodness of God, my poor dear boy."
I have not had much of that to trust in. Even time and absence
have but little faith in."
After all he had undergone, Miss Rosedew could not reproach
him yet for his want of faith in Providence ; “Wait till your Uncle
John comes in," was all she could say in that way.
“And I can tell you another thing, good and kind Miss Rose-
dew," he went on, with a sternness in his eyes which almost
frightened her ; "my father is by no means sure that I did not
shoot my brother on purpose.
“How can you say such a frightful thing?"

CRADOCK NOWELL.
'It is true. I saw it in his eyes. He thinks so much of these
cursed lands-forgive me, dear Miss Rosedew,—the position, and
the title, &c., &c., that he cannot believe I could love my brother-
oh, Viley, Viley, Viley !”
Here he broke down, and turned away; but in his indignation
would not let a sob escape him.
Miss Rosedew scarcely knew what to say. She felt that argu-
ment was likely to do more harm than good while his mind was
thus; until, having long suspected where the poor fellow's heart
was dwelling, she cleverly contrived some little comfort for his
misery.
Come, you must listen to words of good omen; and I have
words of excellent omen, from a source a young gentleman cannot
slight. Our dearest Amy is, as you know, a very odd girl indeed.
Sometimes, when something happens very puzzling and perplexing,
some great visitation of Providence, Amy becomes so dreadfully
obstinate, I mean she has such delightful faith, that we are obliged
to listen to her. And she is quite sure to be right in the end,
though at the moment, perhaps, we laugh at her. And yet she is
so shy, you can never get at her heart, except by forgetting what
you are about. Well, we got at it somehow this afternoon; and
you should have heard what she said. Her beautiful great eyes
flashed upon us, like the rock that was struck, and gushed like it,
before she ended. Can we dare to think,' she cried, 'that our
God is asleep like Baal-that He knows not when He has chastened
His children beyond what they can bear? I know that he, who is
now so trampled and crushed of Heaven, is not tried thus for
nothing. He shall rise again more pure and large, and fresh from
the hand of God, and do what lucky men rarely think of—the will
of his Creator.' And when her papa and I looked at her, she fell
away and cried terribly."
Cradock listened with very deep interest, but still deeper astonish-
ment: it seemed so unlike the shy young Amy to be carried away
in that style. And now for a week it had been to him a sad and
bitter thing to see how the maiden was avoiding him ; whence, and
from what he heard about her dejection and love of solitude, he
concluded that she was grieving inconsolably for Clayton.
“How wonderfully good,” he cried, “how loving you all are to
me! But I can't talk about it, though I shall think of it as long as
I live. I am going away to-night, Aunt Doxy, but I must first see
Uncle John."
Of course Miss Rosedew was very angry, and proved it to be
quite impossible that Cradock should leave them so; but, before
very long, her good sense prevailed, and she saw that it was for
the best. While he stayed there, he must either persist to shut
himself up in solitude, or wander about in desert places, and never
look with any comfort on the face of man. So, having heard

'TIS A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO TURNING. 139
Mr. Rosedew come in, she took Cradock down to the door of the
book-room, and left him with none but her brother.
John Rosedew sat in his little room, with only one candle to light
him, and the fire gone out as usual : his books lay all around him,
even his best-loved treasures, but his heart was not among them.
The grief of the old, though not wild and passionate as a young
man's anguish, is perhaps more pitiable, because more slow and
hopeless. The young tree rings to the keen pruning-hook, the old
tree groans to the grating saw; but one will blossom and bear
again, while the other gapes with canker. None of his people had
heard the rector quote any Greek or Latin for a length of time un-
precedented. When a sweet and playful mind, like his, has taken
to mope and be earnest, the effect is far more sad and touching
than a stern man's melancholy. A ruined castle-wall is dreary;
but a family hearth moss-grown is woeful.
Uncle John leaped up very lightly from his brooding (rather than
reading), and shook Cradock Nowell by the hand, as if he never
would let him go, all the time looking into his face by the light of a
composite candle. It was only to know how he had fared, and
John read his face too truly. Then, as Cradock turned away, not
wanting to make much of it, his friend came before him with sad-
ness and love, and his blue eyes glistened softly.
“My boy, my boy!" was all he could say, or think, for a very
long time. Then Cradock told him, without a tear, a sigh, or even
a comment, but with his face as pale as could be, and his breath
coming heavily, how his father had received his visit, and what he
meant to do through it.
And so, Uncle John,” he concluded, rising to start immediately,
“here I go to seek my fortune, such as it will and must be. Good-
bye, my best and only friend. I am ten times the man I was
yesterday, and shall be grander still to-morrow." He tried to pop
off like a lively cork, but the rector would not have it.
“Young man, don't be in a hurry. It strikes me that I want a
pipe; and it also strikes me that you will smoke one with me."
Cradock was taken aback by the novelty of the situation. He
had never dreamed that Uncle John could, under any possible
circumstances, ask him to smoke a pipe. He knew well enough
that the rector smoked a sacrificial pipe to Morpheus, in a room
of his own up-stairs ; only one, while chewing the cud of all he had
read that day. But Mr. Rosedew had always discouraged, as
elderly smokers do, any young aspirants to the mystic hierophancy.
It is not a vow to be taken rashly, for the vow is irrevocable, except
with men of no principle.
And now he was to smoke there—he, a mere bubble-blowing boy,
to smoke in the middle of deepest books, to fumigate a manuscript
containing a lifeful of learning, which the parson had now no heart
for; and-oh, Aunt Eudoxia !—to make the hall smell and the

drawing-room! The oxymoron overcame him, and he took his
pipe. His host had filled it for him judiciously, and quite as a
matter of course; then Mr. Rosedew filled for himself in the self-
same manner, with a digital skill like an ancient fox trying on a
foxglove. All the time John was shyly wondering at his own great
force of character.
• Now," said the rector, still keeping it up," I have a drop of
very old Schiedam-Schnapps I think, or something-of which I
want your opinion ; Crad, my boy, I want your opinion, before we
import any more. I am no judge of that sort of thing; it is so long
since I was at Oxford.”
Without more ado, he went somewhither, after lighting Cradock's
yard of clay--which the young man burnt his fingers about, for he
wouldn't let the old man do it-and came back like a Bacchanal,
with a square black-jack beneath his arm, and Jenny after him,
wondering whether they had not prayed that morning enough
against the devil. It was a good job Miss Amy was out of the way;
old Doxy was bewitched, that was certain, as well as her dear good
master.' Miss Rosedew was happy in knowing not that she was
called in the kitchen,“ old Doxy."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
A LITTLE CONSOLATION.
“Now, Craddy, my dear, dear boy," said Uncle John, when things
had been done with lemon and cold water, and all that wherein
discussion so utterly beats description," you know me too well to
suppose that I wish to pass things over lightly. I know well enough
that you will look the hard world full in the face. And so should
I do, in your case. All I wish is, that you should do it, not with
spite, or bile, or narrowness, but broadly as a Christian.”
“ It is hard to talk about that now,” said Cradock, inhaling
charity, and puffing away some acrimony; Uncle John, I hope I
may come to it as my better spirit returns to me."
“I hope it indeed, and believe it, Crad; I don't see how it can
be otherwise, with a young man of your breadth of mind, and solid
faith to help you. An empty lad, who snaps up stuff because he
thinks it fine, and garbles it into garbage, would become an utter
infidel under what you have suffered. With you, I believe, it will
be otherwise; I believe you will be enlarged and purified by
sorrow—the night which makes the guiding-star so much the
clearer to us." John Rosedew was drinking no Schiedam-allow

me to explain-though pretending rare enjoyment of it, and making
Cradock drink a little, because his heart was down so.
After they had talked a pipeful longer, not great weighty senti-
ments, but a deal of kindly stuff, the young fellow got up quietly,
and said, “Now, Uncle John, I must leave you all.”
“My boy, I can trust you any where, after what you have
been telling me.
Of human nature I know nothing, except”-
for John thought he did know something—"from my own little
experience. I find great thoughts in the Greek philosophers; but
somehow they are too general, and too little genial. One thing I
know, we far more often mistrust than trust unwisely. And now
I can trust you, Cradock; in the main, you will stand upright.
Stop, my boy; you must have a scrip; I was saving it for your
birthday.”
“You don't despise me, I hope ?” said Cradock; "you don't
think me a coward for running away so ? After what has happened
to-day, I should go mad, if I stopped here. Not that that would
matter much ; only that, if it were so, I should be sure to do it.
Mr. Rosedew had no need to ask what was meant by the last
two words, for the hollow voice told him plainly. But for him, it is
sure enough that it would have been done ere this; at any rate,
in the first horror, his hand alone had prevented it. The parson
trembled at the idea, but thought best not to dwell upon it.
“Reformidare mortem est animi pusillanimi,' but ' reformidare
vitam' is ten times worse, because impious. Therefore, in your
case, my boy, it is utterly impossible, as well as ignoble towards us
who love you so. Remember that you will break at least two old
hearts you owe some duty to, if you allow your own to be broken.
And now for your viaticum ; see how you have relieved me! While
you lived beneath Hymettian beams in the goods of Tyre and
Cyprus, even I your godfather, knew not what to give you. The
thought has been vexing me for months, and now what a simple
solution! You shall have it in the original dross, to pay the toll on
the Appian road, at least the South-Western Railway. Figs to
Athens, I thought it would be, or even as eels to Copaïs; and now
serves iturum Cæsarem. I believe it is at the twenty-first page of
my manuscript, such as it is, upon the Sabellian elements."
After searching in three or four drawers--for he was rather astray
at the moment, though generally he could put his hand, even in the
dark, upon any particular one of his ten thousand books—he came
upon the Sabellian treatise, written on backs of letters, on posters, on
puffing circulars, even on visiting cards, and cast-away tradesmen's
tickets, and there, at the twenty-first page or deltis, lay a 501. Bank
of England note, with some very tough roots arranged diamond-
wise on the back, and arrows, and hyphens, and asterisks, flying
about thickly between them. These he copied off, in a moment,
on a piece of old hat-lining, and then triumphantly waved the

bank-note in the air. It was not often poor Uncle John got hold of
so much money ; too bitterly knew Aunt Doxy how large was the
mesh of his purse.
While Cradock gazed with great admiration, Mr. Rosedew, with
his fingers upon his lips, and looking half ashamed of himself,
went to a cupboard, whose doors, half open, gave a glimpse of
countless sermons. From among them he drew a wide-mouthed
bottle of leeches, and set it upon the table. Then he pulled out the
stopper, unplugged it, and lo! from a hole in the cork fell out
two sovereigns and a half one. As this money rolled on the table,
John could not help chuckling a little.
“Ha, good sister Eudoxia, have I overreached thee again
Double precaution there, you see, Crad. She has a just horror of
my sermons, and she runs at the sight of a leech. Non missura
cutem'—be sure, not a word about it, Crad. That asylum is
inviolable, and sempitern, I hope. I shall put more there next
week.”
Cradock took the money at once, with the deepest gratitude, but
no fuss about it; for he saw how bitterly that good man would feel
it, if he were small enough to refuse.
No need to dwell upon their good-bye, after so much vale-
diction; only Cradock promised to write from London, so soon
as he could give an address there ; then, leaving sadness behind
him, carried enough of it with him. Only he found some little
comfort before he quite left Nowelhurst. And this is the first act
of it.
While he was in his garret, packing a little bag of necessaries,
forced upon him by Miss Doxy from her brother's wardrobe and
her own almost indiscriminately, and while she was pulling and
struggling up-stairs with the rector, Jemima, and Jenny-for she
would have made Cradock, if she could, carry the entire house with
him-he, stowing some fine food in his pocket, felt what he had
caught up so cleverly in his headlong flight from the coppice. He
examined it by the candlelight, and became at once intent upon it.
It had lain beneath a drift of dead leaves backed by a scraggy
branch, whence any thing short of a grand “skedaddle” would never
have dislodged it.
And yet it was a great deal too pretty to be treated in that way.
Cradock could not help admiring it, though he shuddered and felt
some wild hopes vanish as he made out the meaning. It was a
beautiful gold bracelet, light, and of first-rate workmanship, har-
monious too with its purpose, and of elegant design. The lower
half was a strong soft chain of the fabric of Trichinopoli, which
bends like the skin of a snake; the front and face showed a strong
right arm, gauntleted, yet entirely dependent upon the hand of a
lady. No bezilling, no jewel whatever, except that a glorious
rose-shaped pearl hung, as in contest, between them.

A LITTLE CONSOLATION.
143
Cradock wondered for some little time what could be the meaning
of it. Then he knew that it was Clayton's offering to the beloved
Amy. No doubt could remain any longer, when he saw in the
hollow of the back the proposed inscription pencilled, “Rosa de-
bita,” for the dead gold of the lady's palm, “Rosa dedita” for the
burnished gold of the cavalier's high pressure. With ingenious
jealousy to help him, he made it out in a moment. “A rose due,
now a rose true.” That was what it came to, if you took it in
punster fashion. Just one of poor Viley's conceits.
Cradock had no time to follow it out, for Miss Rosedew then
came in with a parcel as large as a feather-bed, of comforters,
wrappers, and eatables, which were to be sent by the morning train,
to be called for at Waterloo station.
But after he had left the house, he began to think about it, in the
little path across the green toward the village churchyard. He
concluded that Amy had been in the wood at some time of that fatal
evening. She must have come to meet Clayton there; and yet it
was not like her. Facts, however, are facts, as sure as eggs are
eggs; though our knowledge makes no great advance through
either of those aphorisms. But a growing sense of injury—though
he had no right to feel injured, however it might be—this sense had
kept him from asking for Amy, or leaving the little coquette a
good-bye.
He entered the quiet churchyard, with the moon rising over the
tombstones, a mass of shadow cast by the great tower, and some
epitaphs pushing well into the light, like the names that press forth
into history. The wavering glance of the diffident moon, uncertain
yet what the clouds meant, slipped along the buttressed walls, and
ſit up well-accustomed friends, grown pale with age-odd angles.
Many a retiring corner would have nought to do with light, now
the imperious sun was gone, and sleep and death were wandering.
A perfect stillness, and a river of gray oblivion swayed the night;
and a thousand sacred memories, grown weary and rheumatic, had
stopped their ears with lichen.
Cradock came in at the rickety swing-stile, and, caring no
shadow for ghost or ghostess, although he had run away so, took the
straight course to the old black doorway, and on to the heart of the
churchyard ; because it was on his road, and because he must say
good-bye to Clayton. All Nowelhurst still admired that path; but
those who had paved and admired it first were sleeping on either
side of it.
It is to be hoped that these worthy fellows were sounder in their
ways of life than in their style of paving. For now, in the dark,
no mortal there with any respect for his grandfather, nor even a
ghost with unbevilled soles, could go many steps without tripping.
Is it, then, a wonder that the lightest and loveliest foot that ever
tripped in the New Forest not only tripped but stumbled there?

CRADOCK NOWELL.
At the very corner where the side walks come in, and the shade of
the tower is deepest, smack from behind a hideous sarcophagus fell
into Cradock's arms the most beautiful thing ever seen perhaps.
If he had not caught her, she must have cut the very sweetest face
in the world into great holes like the pavement.
Stunned for a moment, and then so abroad that she could not
think, nor even speak-“speak nor think," one ought to have said,
if Amy had been masculine-she lay in Cradock's trembling arms,
and never wondered where she was. The youth forgot his despair
for a moment, and applied himself to his duty. It was the sweetest
piece of comfort sent to him yet from heaven. Afterwards he
always thought that his luck turned from that moment. Perhaps it
did; although most people would laugh who knew him afterwards.
Presently Amy recovered, and was wroth with herself and every
body. Ruddier than a Boursalt rose, she fell back against a
tombstone.
“Oh, Amy,” said Cradock, retiring ; “ I have known it long.
Even you are turned against me.”
“ I turned against you, Mr. Nowell! What right have you to
say that of me?"
“No right to say any thing, Amy; and scarcely a right to think
any thing. Only I have a right to feel.”
“Then I wouldn't give much for your feelings. I mean-I beg
your pardon-you know I can never express myself.”
“Of course, I know that,” said Cradock.
“It may be so, indeed," said Amy; "and, of course, you think
so, Mr. Nowell. You have always thought so meanly of me. But,
if I can't express my meaning, is it any wonder, when I am not fit
to have any?”.
Amy,” said Cradock, for all this was so very unlike herself, that,
loving that self more than his own, he was lost in trying to follow
it—“Amy Rosedew, I shall never see you in this world again, will
you make one bitter effort to forgive me before I go ?”
“To forgive you for what, Mr. Nowell? I did not know that
you had injured me."
“ Not injured you, Miss Rosedew! Then what is the meaning of
this, if you please ?"
The moon, being now on her way towards the south, looked over
the counter-like gravestone, and Cradock placed on the cold, level
surface the beautiful bracelet he found in the wood. Amy knew it
in a moment; and she burst out crying, -
“Oh, poor Clayton! How proud, how very proud he was of it!
Mr. Nowell, I never could have thought this of you; never, never,
never !”
Thought what of me, Amy? Darling Amy, what can I have
done to offend you so ?”
“Oh, nothing. I suppose it is nothing to remind me how cruel I

145
have been to him. Oh no, nothing at all. And all this to come
from you!”
In a storm of sobs she fell upon Jeremy Wattle's tombstone, and
Cradock put one arm around her, to prevent her being hurt.
Amy, you drive me wild. I have brought it to you only because
it is yours, and because I am going away.'
Cradock, it never was mine. I refused it months ago; and I
believe he gave it-you know what he was, poor dear-I believe he
transferred it, and something else—oh no, I can't express myself-
to-just to somebody else.”
“Oh, you darling? Who was that other? What a fool he must
have been! Confound it, I never meant that.”
“I don't know, Cradock. Oh, please keep away. But I think it
was Pearl Garnet. Oh, Cradock, poor dear Cradock, what would
you have me say or do? No, I could never think of it. Yes, I will,
Crad; poor Crad, I will, when I think of all your misery.”
She put up her pure lips in the moonlight-for Cradock had got
her in both arms now, and was listening to no reason-her sweet
lips, pledged once pledged for ever, she put them up in her love
and pity, and let him for ever own them. And the moon, that
monthly witness of at least a million seals, never witnessed one
more holy.
After all, young Cradock Nowell, so tried of Heaven, so scourged
with the bitterest ro is of despair, your black web of life is inwoven
now with one bright thread of gold. The purest, the sweetest, the
loveliest girl that ever spun happiness out of sorrow, or smiled
through the veil of affliction, the truest and dearest of all God's
children, loving all things, hating none, pours into your heart for
ever all that heavenly fount of love.
Freed henceforth from doubt and wonder (except at her own
happiness), enfranchised of another world, enriched beyond the
power of earth, ennobled beyond self, she cast her blameless life
and love into the fortunes of another, with joy and hope and faith
tenfold, because he was so unfortunate. A woman's generous
warmth arose through maiden sensibility, and taught her how to
comfort best, and whence to replume the wings of peace.
Cradock, drawn forth from himself, absorbed in her sweet love of
him, tasting, feeling, thinking nothing, except of her deliciousness,
brought his darling's face to light, and led her soft hair down it.
It was his first, and his last chance perhaps, of ever so caressing
her.
Amy stood up in the moonlight, and was not ashamed to show
herself. She felt that Cradock was poring upon her, to store every
glance of her soft bright eyes, and every smile of her coying lips,
for many a weary day and many a restless night to look back upon.
And so she let him form his picture, quite as if she never dreamed
that he was doing any thing.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Her thick hair had fallen most grievously forward, because she
had been crying so; her delicate form, still so light and girlish,
leaned forward in trust of the future, and the long dark lashes she
raised for her lover glistened with the deep light under them.
Shame was nestling in her cheeks, the shame of growing woman-
hood, the down on the ripening fruit of love. She gave him time
enough, and then she crept in closer to him; even the most unhappy
lover must be held to reason.
“Darling Cradock, my own dear Cradock, don't you know me
well enough? You see, I only love you so because you are so
unlucky, and I am so dreadfully obstinate.”
“Of course, I know all that, my pet; my beauty inexpressible.
And remember that I only love you so, because you are such a
darling."
Then Amy told him how sorry she was for having been so pettish
lately; and she would never be so again, only it was all his fault,
because she wanted to comfort him, and he would not come and let
her-here the softest gleam fluttered through her tears, like the
Mazarine Blue among dewdrops—and that only for the veriest
chance, and the saucer she had broken-but what of that, she,
would like to know ; it was the surest sign of good luck to them,
although it was the best service-only for that, her Crad would
have gone-gone away for ever, and never known how she loved
him ; yes, with all her heart, every single atom of it, every delicious
one, if he must have it. And she would keep it for him for ever,
for ever ; and be thinking of him always. Let him remember that,
poor darling, and worry himself with his troubles no more !
Then he told her how Uncle John had behaved-how nobly, how
magnanimously; and had given every bit of money he could lay
hold of in the world for Cradock to start in life with. John Rose-
dew's only child began to cry again at hearing it, and put her little
hand into her pocket in the simplest way imaginable. “ Yes,
you will, dear;" "No, I won't;" went on for several minutes, till
Amy nestled quite into his bosom, and put her sweet lips to his ear.
“ If you don't, I will never believe that you love me truly. I
am your little wife, you know; and all that I have is of course
The marriage-portion in debate was no more than five and six-
pence, for Amy could never keep money long ; so Cradock accepted
the sweet little purse, and he must have a bit of her hair in it. She
pulled out her little sewing-case, which she always took to the day-
school, and the small bright scissors flashed in the moonlight, and
they made a great play of this serious job. Two great snips were
heard at last; and exchange, after all, is no robbery.
Then hand in hand they went together to see poor Clayton's
grave, and Cradock started as they approached, for something black
was moving there.

“Little dear,” said Amy, as the doggie look mournfully up at
them, “she would starve if it were not for me. And I could not
coax her to eat a morsel until I said, 'Clayton, poor Clayton !
And then she licked my hand and whined, and took a bit to please
If I had not come to feed her, you would have gone away
without a word to your own best sweetheart. She has had such a
beautiful tea to-night!. I told you I broke the saucer, but that was
all my own clumsiness.”
And what has she got there? Oh, Amy! Amy, it is horrible!”
Black Wena, when it was dark that evening, and Clayton must
have done dinner, had stolen away to his dressing-room, and
fetched, as she had been taught to do, his smoking-jacket and
slippers. It took her a long time to carry the jacket, for fear it
should be wet for him. Then she came with a most important air,
and put them down upon his grave, and wagged her tail for ap-
proval. She was lying there now, and wondering how long till he
would get up, and pat her.
Cradock sobbed hysterically, and Amy led him softly away to the
place where his travelling-bag was.
“Now wait here a moment, my poor dear, and I will bring you
your future companion.”
Presently Amy came back, with Wena following the coat and
the slippers. “Darling Cradock, take her with you. She is so
true and faithful. She will die if she is left here. And she will be
such a comfort to you. Take her, Cradock, for my sake.”
That last entreaty settled it. Cradock took the coat and slippers,
and carried Wena a little way, while she looked back wistfully at
the churchyard, and Amy coaxed and patted her. They arranged,
ere they parted, that Amy Rosedew should call upon Miss Garnet,
should restore the bracelet, and should mark in what manner she
received it; for Amy had now a strong suspicion (especially after
what Cradock had seen, and now described quite calmly) that Pearl
knew more of poor Clayton's death than had been confessed to any
“My own Cradock, only think,” said Amy; “I have felt the
strongest conviction, throughout, that you had nothing to do with
it.”
“Sweetest one,” he replied, with a desperate longing to clasp
her, but for Wena and the carpet-bag,“ that is only because you
Isve me so. Never say it again, dear ; suspense, or even doubt
about it, would kill me like slow poison.”
Amy shuddered at his tone, and thought how different men were:
for a woman would live on the hope of it. But she remembered
those words when the question arose, and rejoiced that he knew not
a word of it.
And now with the great drops in her eyes, she stood at her
father's gate, to say good-bye to her first and her only love for
one.

>>
ever. She would not let him know that she cried; but Wena was
welcome to know it, and Wena licked some nice tears off, and then
quite felt for Amy.
Good-bye, my own, my only,” said Cradock, for the twentieth
time ; while the latch of the gate was trembling ; “ God loves us,
after all, Amy. Or, at any rate, He loves you."
“And you, and you. Oh, Cradock ! if He loves one, He must
love both of us."
I believe He may begin again ; if

hopes of it; especially as there is nothing now to take from me
“ Dearest darling, life of my life, promise me not to fret so. I
cannot bear to hear it."
Fret, indeed, with you to love me! Give me only one more
assurance.”
Cradock, with a braver heart than he ever thought to own again
(yet with a hole and a cord in it, because it was no more his own),
being begged away at last by one who then went down on her
knees, only to beg him back again,—that hapless yet most happy
fellow strode away as hard as he could, for fear of running back
again ; and the dusky trees closed round him, opening only one
little star, embowered in a long arcade. So the latch of the gate
for the last time clicked, when he was out of hearing, and the
laurustinus by the pier, beginning to bud for the winter, glistened
in the moonlight with a silent storm of tears.

CHAPTER XXIX.
SIMPLE-MINDED GEORGIE.
Dr. and Mrs. Hutton had been, as some of us may remember, in-
vited in the very kindest manner to dine the next Wednesday at
Kettledrum Hall ; and the distance being considerable, and the
roads so shockingly bad—“even dangerous, I am told, to gentlemen
who have dined with me, sir,” said Kettledrum, in his proudest
manner-they had accepted his offer, and that of Mrs. Kettledrum,
which she herself had come over to make, that they should not
think of returning until after breakfast on Thursday. In conse-
quence of her husband's hints, Rosa felt the keenest interest in
" that Mrs. Kettledrum.” “Leave her to me, dear Rufus. You need
not be afraid, indeed. Trust me to get to the bottom of it.” And
so she exerted her probing skill upon her to the uttermost, more
even than ladies usually do, when they first meet one another. Of

course, there was no appearance of it, nothing so ill-bred as that ;
it was all the sweetest refinement, and the kindest neighbourly
interest. They even became affectionate in the course of half av
hour, and mutual confidence proved how strangely their tastes and
their hearts beat in unison. Nevertheless each said good-bye with
a private effusion of gratitude at having befooled the other. “Poor
thing, she was so stupid. What a bungler, to be sure ! And to
think I could not see through her !”
But the return-match between these ladies, which was to have
come off at Kettledrum Hall-where, by-the-bye, there appeared a
far greater performer than either of them—this interesting display
of skill was deferred for the present; inasmuch as Rosa was taken
ill during the mysteries of her toilet. It was nothing more serious,
however, than the “flying spasms," as she always called them, to
which she had long been subject, and which (as she often told her
husband) induced her to marry a doctor.
Rufus administered essence of peppermint, and then a dose of
magnesia; but he said that it was a most strong exhibition, and he
wanted to stop at home with her, and see that she sat by the fire.
She in turn would have her way, and insisted that Rue should go,
“for he had made himself such a very smart boy, that she was
really quite proud of him, and they would all be so disappointed,
and he was taller than Mr. Kettledrum, she felt quite sure he was.”.
The bearing of that last argument may not to a masculine neutral
mind be altogether duly cogent. However, the lady insisted upon
it, till to Rue it was quite conclusive. So Ralph Mohorn was sent
for, the pony-carriage countermanded, and Rufus set forth upon
Polly, whose oats were now restricted.
Kettledrum Hall stood forth on a rise, and made the very most of
itself. Expansive, and free, and obtrusively honest, it seemed to
strike itself on the bre (as its master did) with both gables. A
parochial assessment committee, or a surveyor for the property-tax,
would have stuck on something considerable, if they had only seen
the outside of it. Look at the balustrade that went (for it was too
heavy to run) all along the front of it, over the basement windows.
No stucco, either ; but stone, genuine stone, that bellied out like a
row of Roman amphoræ, or the calves of a first-rate footman. After
that, to see the portico, “ decempedis metata,” which “excipiebat
Eurum”-not Arcton in this climate. No wonder-although it was
rotten inside, and the whole of it mortgaged ten fathom deep-that
Bailey Kettledrum hit his breast, and said, “ Our little home, sir !"
“Your great home, you mean," said Rufus; "what a noble situa-
tion! You can see all over the county."
They had come to meet him down the hill, the kindest country
fashion, Mr. and Mrs. Kettledrum, like Jack and Jill going for
water.
“ Not quite that," replied Kettledrum ; “but we saw you with my

binocular, between two and three miles off, and became so anxious
about Mrs. Hutton, that I said to my wife, ' Put your bonnet on;'
and she only said, “Bailey, put your hat on;' nothing more, sir,
I assure you; nothing more, sir, upon my honour.”
Rufus could not see exactly why there should have been any
thing more, but he could not help thanking them for their kindness,
and saying to himself, “What nice people ! Quite an agricultural
life, I see, in spite of that grand mansion.”
Now," said Mr. Kettledrum, when Polly had been committed to
one of the stable-boys—but Rufus still wanted to look at her, for he
never grew tired of admiring any thing that belonged to him, and
he knew they wouldn't do her legs right—"now, Dr. Hutton, you
have come most kindly, according to your promise, so as to give us
an hour or two to spare before the dinner-time. Shall we take a
turn with the guns? I can put my hand on a covey; or shall we
walk round the garden, and have the benefit of your advice ?”
Rufus looked in dismay at his “choice black kerseymeres;" he
had taken his patent gaiters off, and was proud to find not a flake
inside. But to think of going out shooting! He ought not to have
dressed before he left home, but he hated many skinnings. So he
voted very decidedly for a walk in the kitchen-garden.
Into this he was solemnly instituted, and the beauties all pointed
out to him. What a scene of weeds and rubbish! How different
from Bull Garnets dainty and trim quarters, or from his own new
style of work at Geopharmacy Lodge! Rotten beansticks crackling
about, the scum of last summer's cabbages, toad-stoolş cropping up
like warts or arums rubbed with caustic, a fine smell of potato-
disease, and a general sense of mildew ; the wall-trees curled and
frizzled up with aphis, coccus, and honeydew; and the standards
scraggy, and full of stubs, canker, and American blight, sprawling,
slouching, hump-backed, and stag-headed, like the sick ward of a
workhouse fighting with tattered umbrellas.
“Ah,” said Rufus, at his wits' end for any thing to praise, “what
a perfect paradise—for the songsters of the grove."
Oh,” replied Mr. Kettledrum, “you should hear the Dook
admire it. Kettledrum, my boy,' he said, when he dined with me
last Friday, 'there is one thing I do envy you—no, sir, neither your
most lady-like wife, nor yet your clever children, although I admit
that neither of them can be paralleled in England—but, Kettledrum,
it is—forgive me -it is your kitchen-garden. My kitchen-garden,
your grace,' I replied, for I hate to brag of any thing, “it is a poor
thing, my lord Dook, compared to your own at Lionshill.' 'May I
be d-d,' his grace replied, for I never shall break him of swearing,
‘if I ever saw any thing like it, dear Kettledrum, and so I told the
Duchess.' And after all, you know, Dr. Hutton, a man may think
too little of what it has pleased God to give him.”
“Well,” said Rufus to himself, “ I'm blessed if I think you can.

But I don't like you any the worse for a bit of brag. I have met
great brags in India, and most of them honest fellows. But I must
peg him down a bit. I must, I fear; it is my duty as an enlightened
gardener.”
“But you see, now," said Bailey Kettledrum, smacking his lips,
and gazing into profundity,"you see, my dear sir, there is nothing
6 ab omni parte beatum ; perhaps you remember the passage in the
heroic epistles of-ah, Cicero it was, I believe, who wrote all those
epistles to somebody.”
“No doubt of it," said Rufus Hutton, who had forgotten all his
classics in bad Hindustani ; "and yet St. Paul wrote some.”
“Not in Latin, my dear sir; all St. Paul's were Greek. 'Nihil
est,' I now remember, 'ab omni parte beatum.' I don't know how
it scans, which I suppose it ought to do, but that isn't my look-out.
Perhaps, however, you can tell me?"
“ I'm blowed if I can,” said Rufus Hutton, in the honesty of his
mind ; " and I am not quite sure that it has any right to scan.”
"Well, I can't say ; but I think it ought,”—he was in the mists of
memory, where most of the trees have sensitive roots, though the
branches are not distinguishable. “ However, that can't matter at
all; I see you are a classical scholar. And, Hutton, I like a clas-
sical scholar, because he can understand me. But you see that
these trees are rather-ah, what is the expression for it——?”
Cankered, and scabby, and scrubs.”
“That is to say-yes, I suppose, they would crop the better, if
that be possible, for a little root-pruning."
You have gathered the fruit for this year, I presume ?”
“Well, no, not quite that. The children have had some, of course,
But we are very particular not to store too early.”
I really don't think you need be.”
Why, many people say, ' let well alone;' but my gardener talks
of making
“A jolly good bonfire of them, if he knows any thing of his
business. Then drain the ground, trench, and plant new ones.
Mr. Kettledrum looked quite thunderstruck; he caught hold of
a tree to help him, and a great cake of rotten bark, bearded with
moss, came away like the mask of a mummer. It was slimy on the
under side, and two of his fingers went through it.
“Nice state of things,” said Rufus, laughing. “I suppose the
Dook likes lepers ?”
Why, my dear sir, you don't mean to say-
“ That I would leave only one of them, and I would hang the
head-gardener upon it."
That worthy was just coming round the corner, to obtain the
applause of a gentleman well known to the Gardener's Chronicle;
but now he turned round abruptly, and scratched his head, and
thought of his family.

on.
When Rufus came down and entered the drawing-room he was
perfectly gorgeous; for although he had been in black dress for the
main, he knew better than to ride with his Alumbaggah waistcoat
There was nothing in all the three presidencies to come up to
that waistcoat. It would hold Dr. Hutton and Rosa too, for they
had stood back to back and tried it. And Rufus vainly sighed for
the day when his front should come out and exhaust it. He stole
it, they say, from a petty rajah, who came to a great durbar with it,
worn like an Oxford hood. At any rate, stolen or bought, there it
was,
and who
may attempt to describe it?
But truly it required some strength of mind to present it to
170dern society, although it was a work of considerable art, and no
little value.
The material was soft Indian silk of the very richest quality. It
hird no buttons, but golden eyelets and tags of golden cowries. The
background of the whole was yellow, the foreground of a brilliant
green, portraying the plants of the jungle. On the left bosom
leaped and roared an enormous royal tiger, with two splendid
jewels, called "cat's-eyes," flashing, and a pearl for every fang.
Upon the right side a hulking elephant was turning tail igno-
miniously; while two officers in the howdah poked their guns at the
eyes of the tiger. The eyes of the officers in their terror had turned
to brilliant emeralds, and the blood of the tramping elephant was
represented by seed rubies. The mahout was cutting away in the
distance, looking back with eyes of diamonds.
Beyond a doubt, it required uncommonly fine breeding, especially
in a lady, to meet that waistcoat at a dinner-party, and be entirely
unconscious of it. And perhaps there are but few women in
England who would not contrive to lead up to the subject, quite
accidentally, of course, before the evening was over.
The ladies, however, looked as grave as judges ; and somehow it
was managed (as if by the merest oversight) that Dr. Hutton should
lead to dinner, not the lady of the house, whom, of course, he ought
to have taken, but her sister, Mrs. Nowell Corklemore. He felt, as
he crossed the hall with her, that the beauty of his waistcoat had
raised some artistic emotion in a bosom as beautiful as its own.
Georgiana Corklemore was an uncommonly clever woman, and a
thoroughgoing flirt, as well by nature as by practice. She loved her
child, and liked her husband, the man of the many “haws," and
had all the respect for her own self which may abide with vanity.
Nevertheless she could not help doing something to amuse her, and
her beauty being beyond dispute, all married women hated her.
On the present occasion“ Georgie Corklemore," as she called
herself, set about Airting with Rufus Hutton, not from her usual
love of power, nor even for the sake of his waistcoast, but because
she had an especial purpose, and a very important one. The
Kettledrum-cum-Corklemore conspiracy was this—to creep in once

more at Nowelhurst Hall through the interest of Dr. Hutton. They
all felt perfectly certain that Cradock Nowell had murdered his
brother, and that the crime had been hushed up through the in-
fluence of the family. They believed that the head of that family, in
his passionate sorrow and anger, might be brought to their view of
the subject, if he could only be handled properly ; and who could
manage that more adroitly than his first cousin once removed, the
beautiful Mrs. Corklemore? Only let her get once invited, once
inducted there, and the main difficulty after that would be to appor-
tion the prey between them. They knew well enough that the old
entail expired with the present baronet; and that he (before his
marriage) held in fee pure and simple all that noble propery. His
marriage-settlement, and its effects, they could only inkle of; but
their heart was inditing of a good matter, and Mr. Chope, their
solicitor, was just the sort of man to worm out every thing about it.
Of course these members of the family” combined for the present
in detestation and scorn of Dr. Hutton. An upstart Indian apothe-
cary, without a drop of the Nowell blood in him, to play lord
paramount at the Hall, and bang the gates on true relatives !
However, there he was; and dear Sir Cradock was so obstinate-
not to say demented—that the only channel of access to him was
kept by this “apothecary.”
Only two things need be added: one that Sir Cradock had always
disliked, and invited them but for appearance' sake; the other, that
they fairly believed in the righteousness of their cause, and that
Rufus Hutton could prove the murder, and would if he had not
been tampered with.
Mrs. Córklemore was now, perhaps, twenty-five years old, possibly
turning thirty; for that lustrum of a lady's life is a hard one to beat
the bounds of; at any rate, she had never looked better than she did
at the present moment. To delicate features, and soft large eyes,
and cheeks of a glistening curvature, was added a power of lighting
up with irrepressible sympathy every lovely lineament. At such
moments all her shapely, beautifully jacketed form quivered with
intense desire for the good and pure and right. And now she was
just at the age to spread open, with the memory of shyness upon
them (like the dew when the sun is up), the curving petals of beauty.
Who understands the magnetic current? Who can analyze ozone?
Is there one of us able to formularize the polarity of light? Will
there ever be an age when chemists metaphysical will estimate, not
by troy weight, and carat, cast up in decimals, but by subtle spirit-
force, the sovereignty of women?
That soft Georgiana Corklemore, so lively, lovely, and gushing,
focussed all her fascinations upon Rufus Hutton. She knew that
she had to deal with a man of much inborn acuteness, and who
must have seen a hundred ladies quite as fair as Georgie. But had
he seen one with her-well, she knew not what to call it, though

CRADOCK NOWELL.
she thoroughly knew how to use it? So she magnetized him with
all her skill; and Rufus, shrewdly suspecting her object, and con.
fiding in a certain triarian charge, a certain thrust Jarnacian, which
he would deliver at the proper moment, allowed her to smile, and to
show her white teeth and dimples of volatile velvet (so natural, so
inevitable, at his playful, delightful humour), and to loose whole
quiverfuls of light shafts from the arch flash under her eyelids.
What sweet simplicity she was, what innocent desire to learn, what
universal charity!
“How dreadful, Dr. Hutton! Oh, please not to tell me of it!
How could any ladies do it? I should have fainted at once, and
died within an hour afterwards.” She turned up her large mild
eyes, deeply beaming with centralized light, in a way that said, “ If
I died, is there any one who would think it a very, very great
pity?"
Rufus had been describing historically, not dramatically, the
trials of the ladies, when following their regiment during a sudden
movement in the perils of the mutiny. With a man's far stiffe
identity, he did not expect or even imagine that his delicate listener
would be there, and go through every hour of it. But so it was, and
without any sham ; although she was misusing her strange sym.
pathetic power. Georgiana Corklemore would have made a very
great actress ; she had so much self-abandonment, such warm intro-
jection, and hot indignant sympathy; and yet enough of self-
reservation to keep them all to their proper work.
lvleanwhile Mrs. Kettledrum, a lady of ordinary sharpness, like a
good pudding-apple-Georgie being a peach of the very finest
quality-she from the top of the table was watching all her sister's
lovely tricks-delighted, amused, indignant; glad that none of her
children were there to store up Auntie's doings. As for Mr. Corkle-
more, he was quite accustomed to it; and looking down com-
placently upon the little doctor, thought to himself, "How beautifully
my Georgie will cold-shoulder him, when we have got all we want
out of this conceited, chattering, gardening apothecary!"
When the ladies were gone, Mr. Bailey Kettledrum, who had no
idea of playing dummy even to Mrs. Córklemore, made a trick or
two from his own hand.
“ Corklemore, my dear fellow, you think we are all tee-totallers.
On with the port, if you please, 'cessantem Bibuli Consulis am-
phoram;' never shall forget that line. The bibulous consul, eh!
Capital idea. Corklemore, you can construe that?”
“Haw! Perhaps I can't. Really don't know; they beat a heap
of stuff into me when I was at Eton; but they found it no more
good than whipping-ha, haw, something like whipping-
" Eggs,” said Rufus Hutton, “all came to bubbles, you mean,
sir?"
Not at all, sir; not at all; you entirely misunderstand me. I

155
mean that it was similar to—to the result produced by the whipping
of a top.”
The other extreme appears more apt,” said Mr. Kettledrum,
winking at Rufus; and thenceforth had established a community of
interest in the baiting of “long Corklemore.”
“Well," at any
rate,” he continued, “Hutton is a scholar-excuse my freedom, my
dear sir; we are such rustics here, that I seldom come across a
man who appreciates my quotations. You are a great acquisition,
sir, the very greatest, to this neighbourhood. How can we have let
you remain so long without unearthing you ?"
Because,” said Rufus to himself, "you did not happen to want
me; when are you going to carry out my introduction to the
Dook'?"
The gentlemen passed the decanter briskly, and talked about all
the best vintages, and smacked their lips, and looked most wise,
and declared that the wine must be '34. Rufus knew better, but
held his peace. Kettledrum and Corklemore had shared a pipe of
'51, a noble vintage, not half ripe yet, and had helped each other
to bottle it.
Now if these hospitable men had any hope of making Dr. Hutton
spring his anchors even, much more get “half-seas over,” it showed
their ignorance of a sound East Indian constitution. The worthy
Rufus drank glass for glass, as the pluck of his nature prompted
him ; yet he alone put no foot over the vaguest verge of tipsiness.
Come, Dr. Hutton, another olive; and another glass on the
strength of it.”
Certainly. say yes to both. But your olives are not of the
proper kind. You scarcely ever see the right olive in this country,
Corklemore," said Rufus, turning his waistcoat upon that sleepy
individual ; “the Italian olive is like sea pop-weed. The Portu-
guese olive is the one for port.”
“ Haw, to be sure !” answered Mr. Corklemore ;
you come to think of it."
Sad, sad, sad affair !” cried Mr. Kettledrum, clumsily plunging,
through the power of wine, into the black sea of diplomacy.
suppose, about those poor Nowells,” Dr. Hutton
answered quietly. “You are right; it was a most sad thing. Let
us, at this pleasant period, talk of lighter subjects. Your apple-
trees, for instance.”
Bailey Kettledrum, though a little fond of brag, had the instincts
of a gentleman, whereof the first is hospitality ; and he felt that he
could not, at his own table, press any subject declined by a guest.
And as for Mr. Corklemore, by this time he was snoring.
So they departed to brighter scenes and the dominion of the
ladies; where they found five pretty little samples of the genus
Kettledrum, tidy, very good, quite female, and of pink-ribbon
pattern. After some little fuss, of course, melting melodies began

66
to flow from Georgie's sweet fingers and sweeter lips ; until
Mrs. Kettledrum exclaimed,-
“Oh, Dr. Hutton, do you ever play chess? We are such players
here; all except my poor self ; I am a great deal too stupid.”
“I used to play a little when I was in India. We are obliged to
play all sorts of games in India." Dr. Hutton piqued himself not a
little on his skill in the one true game.
At a sign from their mother, the five small Kettledrums rushed
for the board most zealously, and knocked their soft heads together.
Mrs. Corklemore was declared by all to be the only antagonist
worthy of an Indian player, and she sat down most gracefully, pro-
testing against her presumption. “ Just to take a lesson, you know;
only to take a lesson, dear. Oh, please, don't let any one look
Rufus, however, soon perceived that he had found his match, if
not his superior, in the sweet, impulsive, artless creature, who threw
away
the game so neatly when she was quite sure of it.
Oh, poor me! Now, I do declare- Isn't it most heartbreaking ?
I am such a foolish thing. Oh, can you be so cruel ?”
Thrilling eyes of the richest grey trembled with dewy radiance as
Rufus coolly marched off the queen, and planted his knight instead
of her.
“ Mrs Corklemore, can I relent? You are far too good a player.”
The loveliest eyes, the most enchanting sigh of the fairest bosom,
could not make that dry Dr. Hutton, well content with his Rosa,
give away so much as the right to capture a pawn in passing.
Now observe the contrariety, the want of pure reason, the con-
fusion of ảpxý-sorry and ashamed one is to go out of the native
tongue (but English, though rich in emotion, is a pauper in philo-
sophy)—the distress upon the premises of the cleverest woman's
mind. The lady had purposely thrown her queen at the mercy of
her antagonist; but she never forgave him for taking it.
A glance shot from those soft bright eyes, when Rufus turned
away from them, of which a dear sister or husband alone could
believe such an angel capable.
Mrs. Corklemore was not bound to throw away the second game,
but became most sweet and humble about her wonderful luck in
winning it. And then, alas ! it was too late to try the decisive
contest.
“Early hours. Liberty Hall, Liberty Hall at Kettledrum !
Gentlemen stay up, and smoke if they like. But early hours, sir,
for the ladies.”
Mr. Kettledrum had his orders, no doubt, as in his noble,
dramatic manner, so playful and yet so commanding, he advanced,
struck an attitude, and with decisive elegance parted the com.
batants.
“Oh, how cruel !” cried Georgie, pouting, and making a tele-

graphic face behind his back at Rufus ; " just when it was so very
exciting! Just when you saw that I might have a chance to win
another game almost !
“ Discipline, discipline !"answered their host. “My dear Georgie,
could you beat Dr. Hutton if your forces were not under discipline ?"
“Mrs. Corklemore has not beaten me," began Dr. Hutton, with
all the self-assertion of an old chess-player : “I assure you, I assure
you-
But they laughed him down in a pretty little way, as if they knew
all about it, and expected him to argue.
When all the rest were at breakfast, next morning, in came
Mrs. Corklemore, looking as fresh as daybreak.
“Oh, I am so ashamed of myself. What a sluggard you will
think me! What is it in the divine song of that great divine,
Dr. Watts ? Nowell, dear, you must not scold me. I cannot bear
being scolded, because I never have tit for tat. Good morning,
dearest Anna ; how is your headache, darling? Oh, Dr. Hutton, I
forgot! No wonder I overlooked you. I shall never think much
of you again, because I beat at chess so.”
Game and game,” said Rufus, solemnly; "and I ought to have
won that last one, Mrs. Corklemore ; you know I ought.”
“To be sure, to be sure. Oh, of course I do. But-a little
thing perwented him-his antagonist was too good, sir. Ah, we'll
play the conqueror some day; and then the tug of war comes.
Oh, Anna, I am so conceited! To think of my beating Dr. Hutton,
the best player in all India.”
“Well, darling, we know all that. And we must not blame you
therefore for lying in bed till ten o'clock."
“Oh,” said Rufus, with a groan, “do look at ladies' logic !
Mrs. Corklemore gained one game out of two-only because I was-
ah-hem, I mean by her very fine play—and now she claims absolute
victory; and Mrs. Kettledrum accepts it as a premise for a negative
conclusion, which has nothing on earth to do with it.”
But Rufus got the worst of that protest. He tilted too hard at
the quintain. All came down upon him at once, till he longed for a
cigar. Then Mrs. Corklemore sympathized with him, arose, their
breakfast being over, and made him a pretty curtsy. She was
very proud of her curtsies ; she contrived to show her figure so.
“ Confound that woman,” thought Rufus, “ I can never tell when
she is acting. I never met her like in India. And thank God for
that same."
She saw that her most bewitching curtsy_was entirely thrown
away upon him ; for he was thinking of his Rosa, and looking out
for the good mare, Polly.
“Dr. Hutton, I thank you for your condescension in giving me
that lesson. You let me win that last game out of pure good-
nature. I shall always, always be grateful. Meanwhile I shall say

to every one, 'Oh, do you know, Dr. Hutton and I play even ?'
taking very good care meanwhile never to play again with you.
Shocking morality! Yes, very shocking. But, then, I know no
better, do I, Nowell dear ?í.
“Haw? Well, Georgie, I am not so sure of that. My wife is
absolute nature, sir, simple, absolute–haw—unartificial nature.
But unartificial nature is, in mee opeenion-haw-yes, the very best
nature, sometimes."
“Haw!” said his wife, to the very echo, so that nobody could
help laughing. Then she stood upon tiptoe and blew him a kiss, as
a sort of apology. She was so very simple, she never could think of
what people might think of her. All the pretty airs and graces of
a fair Parisian, combined with all the domestic duty of an English
wife! Mr. Corklemore was appeased, and uttered a "haw!" which
she could not imitate.
“Dear me! I forgot," the lady cried. “Nowell, we must say
'good-bye,' I fear, to Dr. Hutton. We are on the wing, as he is.
Good-bye, Dr. Hutton. I fear you will hardly ever forgive me for
tarnishing your laurels so."
“Now or never," thought Rufus Hutton ; she has beaten me at
chess, she thinks. Now I'll have the change out of her. Only let
her lead up to it.”
Mrs. Corklemore, we will fight it out upon some future occa-
sion. I never played with a lady so very hard to beat.”
“Ah, you mean at Nowelhurst. But we never go there now.
There is—I ought to say, very likely, there are mistakes on both,
sides—still there seems to exist some dreadful prejudice against us.
-Anna, dear, you put a lump of sugar too much in my tea:
already too saccharine.”
“Well, dear, I put exactly what you always tell me. And you
sent your cup for more afterwards."
“Matter-of-fact animal-how can she be my sister ?” Georgie
only muttered this. Rufus Hutton did not catch it. Mr. Garnet
would have done so.
Now is the time," thought Rufus again, as she came up to shake
hands with him, not a bit afraid of the morning sun upon her
smooth rich cheeks, where the colour was not laid on in spots, but
seemed to breathe up from below, like a lamp under water. Outside
he saw the good mare Polly scraping holes in the gravel, and the
groom throwing all his weight on the curb to prevent her from
bolting homewards.
“Hang it, she won't stand that,” he cried ; "her mouth is like a
emone. Take her by the snaffle-rein. Can't you see, you
fool, that she hasn't seven coats to her mouth, like you ? Excuse
my opening the window,” he apologized to Mrs. Kettledrum, “and
excuse my speaking harshly ; for if I had not stopped him, he
would have thrown my horse down, and I value my Polly
enormously."

"Especially after her behaviour the other night in the forest. It
is the same with all you gentlemen; the worse you are treated, the
more grateful you are. Oh yes, we heard of it; but we won't tell
Mrs. Hutton."
No, indeed, I hope you won't. I should be very sorry for her to
get even a hint of it."
To be sure," said Mrs. Corklemore, coming back with a special
smile ; "to be sure we will keep the secret, for ever so many reasons;
one of them being that Dr. Hutton would be obliged to part with
Miss Polly, if her mistress knew of her conduct. But I must not
be so rude. I see you want to be off quite as much as fair Polly
does. Ah, what a thing it is to have a happy home !”
Here Mrs. Corklemore sighed very deeply. If a woman who
always has her own way, and a woman who is always scheming, can
be happy, she ought to be so ; but she did so love compassion.
Come,” she said, after turning away, for she had such a jacket
- the most bewitching thing ; it was drawn in tight at her round
little waist, and seemed made like a horse's body-clothes, for a trot
on a wintry morning-“come, Dr. Hutton, say good-bye, and for-
give me for beating you." Simple creature, of course she knew not
the sacra fames" of chess-players.
“We inust have our return match. I won't say 'good-bye' until
you have promised me that. Shall it be at my own house ?"
No. There is only one place in the world where I would dare
to attack you again, and that is Nowelhurst Hall.”
And why there, more than any where else ?"
Because there is a set of men there with which I can beat any
body. I believe I could beat Morphy with those men at Nowel.
hurst. Ah! you think me, I see, grossly and stupidly superstitious.
Well, perhaps I am. I do sympathize so with every thing."
"I hope we may meet at Nowelhurst,” replied Rufus, preparing
his blow of Jarnac, “when they have recovered a little from their
sad distress.”
Ah, poor Sir Cradock !” exclaimed the lady, with her expres-
sive eyes tear-laden,“ how I have longed to comfort him! It does
seem so hard that he should renounce the sympathy of his relatives
at such a time as this. And all through some little wretched dis-
sensions in the days when he misunderstood us! Of course we
know that you cannot do it ; that you, a comparative stranger, can-
not have sufficient influence where the dearest friends have failed.
My husband, too, in his honest pride, is very, very obstinate, and
my sister quite as bad. They fear, I suppose-well, it does seem
ridiculous, but you know what vulgar people say in a case of that
sort—they actually fear the imputation of being fortune-hunters !”
Georgie looked so arrogant in her stern consciousness of right,
that Rufus said, and for the moment meant it, “How absurd, to be
sure!"
Yes," said Georgie confidentially, and in the sweetest of all

sweet voices; between you and me, Dr. Hutton for I speak to
you quite as to an old friend of the family, whom you have known
so long”-“ Holloa,” thought Rufus, “in the last breath I was a
comparative stranger'!”—“I think it below our dignity to care
for such an absurdity; and that now, as good Christians, we are
bound to sink all petty enmities, and comfort the poor bereaved one.
If you can contribute in any way to this act of Christian charity,
may I rely upon your good word? But for the world don't tell my
husband; he would be so angry at the mere idea.”
"I will do my best, Mrs. Corklemore ; you may rely upon
that.”
“Oh, thank
you,
thank
you. I felt quite sure that you had a
generous heart. I should have been so disappointed. Perhaps,
after all, we shall play our next game of chess at Christmas with
the men I am so lucky with. And then look to yourself, Dr.
Hutton."
“I trust you will find a player there who can give me a pawn and
two moves. If you beat him, you may boast indeed.”
“What player do you mean?” she asked, with a shadow of mis-
giving Any Indian friend of yours ?”
Yes, one for whom I have the very greatest regard. For whose
sake, indeed, I first renewed my acquaintance with Sir Cradock,
because I bore a message to him ; for the Colonel is a bad corre-
spondent."
“The Colonel! What Colonel, Dr. Hutton?"
As she said these words, how those eyes of hers, those expressive
eyes, were changing! And her lovely jacket, só smart and well
cut, began to “draw” across the chest.
“ Did you not know,” asked Rufus, watching her in a way that
made her hate him worse than when he took her queen ; is it
possible that you have not heard that Colonel Nowell, Clayton
Nowell, Sir Cradock's only brother, is coming home this month
and brings his darling child home with him ?"
She was equal to the emergency. She commanded her eyes,
and her lips, and bosom, after that one expansion, even her nerves,
to the utmost fibre-every thing but her colour. The greatest actor
ever seen, when called on to act in real life, can never command
colour if the skin has proper spiracles. The springs of our heart
will come up and go down, according to the human weather. But
she turned away, with that lily-whiteness, because she knew she had
it, and rushed up enthusiastically to her sister at the end of the
“Dear Anna, darling Anna, oh, I am so delighted! We have
been so wretched about poor Sir Cradock. And now his brother
is coming to mind him, with such delightful children ! We thought
he was dead, oh, so many years! What a gracious Providence !"

“ The devil !” said Bailey Kettledrum, and Rufus caught the re-
echo, but hoped it might be a mistake.
Then they all came forward, gushing, rushing, rapturous to
embrace him.
Oh, Dr. Hutton, surely this is too good news to be true!”
I think not,” said Rufus Hutton, mystical and oracular; “I
really trust it is not. But I thought you must have heard it, be-
longing as you do to the family; otherwise I should have told you
the moment I came in; but now I hope this new arrival will heal
over all—make good, I mean, all family misunderstandings.”
“ Colonel Clayton Nowell,” said Mr. Nowell Corklemore, con-
clusively, and with emphasis, “ Colonel Clayton Nowell was shot
dead outside the barracks at Mhow, on the 25th day of June, sir, in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-six.
Correct me, sir, if I am wrong."
" Then,” said Rufus, “I venture to correct you on the spot
sir."
“Shot, sir," continued Corklemore,“ as I am, I may say—haw,

lieved to be a Mussulman. Colonel Clayton Nowell, sir, command-

I am sure I can't say,” said Rufus.
* No, sir, my memory is more tenacious than that of any man I
meet with. He, Colonel Clayton Nowell, sir, upon that fatal morn-
ing, was remonstrated with by the two-ah, yes, the two executors
of his will—upon his rashness in riding forth to face those carnal, I
mean to say, those incarnate devils, sir. 'Are you fools enough,
he replied,' to think that my fellows would hurt me? Give me a
riding-whip, and be ready with plasters, for I shall thrash them be-
fore I let them come back. Now, isn't every word of that true?”
“Yes, almost every word of it,” cried Rufus, now growing
excited.
“Well, sir, he took his favourite half-bred-for he understood
cross-breeding thoroughly-and he rode out at the side-gate, where
the heap of sand was; 'Coming back,' he cried to the English
sentry, 'coming back in half an hour, with all my scamps along of
Keep the coppers ready.' And with that he spurred his
brown and black mare ; and no man saw him alive thereafter,
except the fellows who shot him. Haw!”
“Yes,” said Rufus Hutton, one man saw him alive, after they
shot him in the throat, and one man saved his life; and now he
stands before you.”

“What you, Dr. Hutton! What you ! Oh, how grateful we
ought to be to you.”
Thank you. Well, I don't quite see that,” Rufus replied, most
dryly. Then he corrected himself: “You know I only did my
duty.
“And his son ?" inquired Georgie timidly, and with sympathy,
but the greatest presence of mind. She had stood with her hands
clasped, and every emotion (except the impossible one of selfish-
ness) quivering on her sweet countenance; and now she was so
glad, oh, so glad, she could never tell you. “His poor illegitimate
son, Dr. Hutton ? Will he bring the poor child home with him?
How we shall feel for him, to be sure !"
“ The child he brings with him is Eöa, dear natural odd Eöa, his
legitimate daughter."
Then you know her, Dr. Hutton ; you could depose to her
identity ?”
A very odd question ; but some women have almost the gift of
prophecy.
“Oh, yes ! I should rather think so. I have known her since
she was ten years old.”
“And now they are coming home. How exceedingly delightful !
What a sweet surprise to receive them, quite from another world
almost! By the overland route, I suppose, and with a lac of rupees?”
“No," said the badgered Rufus, you are wrong in both conjec-
tures. They come round the Cape, by the clipper-ship Aliwal;
and with very few rupees. · Colonel Nowell has always been extra-
vagant, a wonderfully fine-hearted man, but a hand that could never
hold any thing-except the hand of a true old friend.”
By the moisture in Dr. Hutton's eyes Mrs. Corklemore saw that
her interests would fare ill with him, if brought into competition
with those of Colonel Nowell.
Meanwhile Polly was raving wild, and it took two grooms to hold
her, and the white froth dribbling down her curb was to Rufus
Hutton as the foam of the sea to a sailor. He did love a tearing
gallop, only not through the thick of the forest.
“Good-bye, good-bye! I shall see you soon. Thank you, I will
take a cheroot. But I only smoke my own. Good-bye! I am so
much obliged to you. You have been so very kind. Mrs. Hutton
will be miserable until you come over to us. Good-bye; once more,
good-bye !"
Rufus Hutton was a man of the world, and could be false “on
occasion.” John Rosedew could never have made that speech with
a smile at detected falsehood.
Away went Polly, like a gale of wind ; and Rufus (who was no
rogue by nature, only by the force of circumstances, and then could
never keep to it), he going along twenty miles an hour, set his teeth
to the breeze, which came down the funnel of his cigar as down a

steamer's chimney, stuck his calves well into Polly's sides, and felt
himself a happy man, going at a rocket's speed, to a home of
happiness.
Rosa was waiting at the gate ; why do his mare's shoes linger?
Rosa ran in, and ran out again, and was sure that she heard some-
thing pelting down the hill much too fast, for her sake! but who
could blame him when he knew he was coming home at last ? Then
Rosa snapped poor Jonah's head off, for being too thick to hear it.
Meanwhile a mighty senate was held at Kettledrum Hall, Mrs.
Corklemore herself taking the curule chair. After a glimpse of
natural life, and the love of man and woman, we want no love of
money ; so we lift our laps (like the Roman envoy) and shake out
war with the whole of them.
Fools who think that life needs gilding-life, whose flowing blood
contains every metal but gold and silver,-which but clog and
poison it! Blessed is he who earns his money, and turns it over to
his wife, to be husbanded, on Saturday. He counts it into her hand,
and he need not count any thing, except his children, for another
week of work.
For it would show injustice to him, and ignorance of the human
stomach, to charge him with counting one o'clock. There is no
arithmetic about that. He knows by instinct one o'clock. He
stands upright, and in his eyes (if photographed and magnified), is
an image forty cubits high, to which all nations bow them down,
and its name in every language written, just means “ dinner.”
CHAPTER XXX.
A BUTTERFLY BOY.
MR. GARNET's house, well away to the west, was embraced more
closely and lovingly by the gnarled arms of the Forest than the
Hall, or even the Rectory. Just in the scoop of a sunny valley, high
enough to despise the water, and low enough to defy the wind, there
was nothing to affect it much, but the sighing of the branches.
Over the brown thatch hung two oak-trees, whispering leaves of
history, offering the acorn cup upon the parlour hearth, chafing
their rheumatic knuckles against the stone of the chimneys, won-
dering when the great storm should come that would give them an
inside view of it.
For though the cottage lay so snugly, scarcely lifting its thatched
eyebrows at the draught which stole up the valley, nevertheless those
guardian oaks had wrestled a bout or two with the wind. In the

cyclone on the morning of November 29th, 1836, and again on the
7th of January, 1842, they had gripped the ground, and set hard their
knees, and groaned at the thought of salt water. Since then the
wind had been less of a lunatic (although there had been some
ruffianly work in 1854), and they hoped there was a good time
coming, and spread their branches further and further, and thought
less of the price of timber. ere was only one wind that frightened
them much, and that was two points north of west, the very direc-
tion whence, if they fell, crash they must come on the cottage. For
they stood above it, the root-head some ten feet above the back-floor
of the basement, and the branches towering high enough for a wood-
pigeon not to be nervous there.
Now we only get heavy pressure of squalls from the west-north-
west after a thorough-going tempest which has begun in the south-
ward, and means to box half the compass. So the two great oaks
were regarded by their brethren up the hill as jolly fellows, happy
dogs, born with a silver spoon in their mouths, good for another
thousand years, although they might be five hundred old ; unless,
indeed-and here all the trees shuddered-there came such another
hurricane as in 1703. But which of us knows his own brother's
condition? Those two oaks stood, and each knew it, upon a steep
bank, where no room was for casting out stay-roots to east-south-
east.
Bull Garnet hated those two trees, with terror added to hatred.
Even if they never crushed him, which depended much on the
weather, they would steal in at his bedroom window when the moon
was high. Wandering shapes of wavering shadow, with the
flickering light between them, walking slowly as a ghost does, and
then very likely a rustle and tap, a shivering, a shuddering, it made
the ground floor of his heart shake in the nightmare hours.
Never before had he feared them so much, one quarter so much,
as this October ; and, during the full and the waning moon after
Clayton Nowell's death, he got very little sleep for them. By day
he worked harder than ever, did more than three men ought to do,
was every where on the estates, but never swore at any one-though
the men scratched their ears for the want of it-laboured hard, and
early, and late, if so he might come home ere nightfall, thoroughly
worn and weary.
If his energy had been surprising before, it was now becomeamazing.
No man any where felling wood-Mr. Garnet's especial luxury-
no man hedging and ditching, or frithing, or stubbing up fern and
brambles, but had better look out what he had in his bag, or the
governor would be there, and no mistake.” A workman could
scarcely stand and look round, and wonder how his sick wife was,
or why he had got to work so hard, could scarcely slap himself on
the breast, or wet his hard hands for a better grip, but there was
Bull Garnet before him, with sad, fierce, dogged eyes, worse than
his strongest oaths had been.

Every body said it was (and every body believed it; for the gossip
had spread from the household in spite of the maidens' fear of him),
the cause of it was, beyond all doubt, the illness of his daughter.
Pearl Garnet, that very eccentric girl, as Rufus Hutton pronounced
her, who had startled poor Polly so dreadfully, was prostrate now
with a nervous fever, and would not see even the doctor.
Our Amy,
who pleaded hard to see her, because she was sure she could do her
good, received a stern, sharp negative, and would have gone away
offended, only she was so sorry for her. Not that any fervid friend-
ship, such as young ladies exult in for almost a fortnight incessant,
not that any rapturous love exclusive and exhaustive had ever arisen
between them, for they had nothing whatever in common, save
beauty and tenacity, which girls do not love in each other : only that
Amy was always sorry for any one deep in trouble. And believing
that Pearl had loved Clayton Nowell, and was grieving for him
bitterly, how could she help contrasting that misery with her own
happiness?
For Amy was nice and happy now, in spite of Cradock's departure,
and the trouble he had departed in. He loved her almost half as
much, she believed, as she loved him; and was not that enough for
any body ? His troubles would flow by in time : who on earth could
doubt it, having faith in their great Father? He was gone to make
his way in the world, and her only fear was lest he should make it
too grand for Amy to share in. She liked the school children so,
and the pony, and to run out now and then to the kitchen, and dip
a bit of crust in the dripping-pan; and she liked to fill her dear
father's pipe, and spread a thin handkerchief over his head. Would
all these pleasures be out of her sphere when Cradock came back,
with all London crowning him the greatest and best man of the age ?
Innocent Amy, never fear. “Nemo, nisi per homicidium, repente
fuit clarissimus."
Mr. Garnet would have felled those oaks, in spite of Sir Cradock's
most positive orders, if there had not been another who could not
command, but could plead for them. Every morning as the steward
came out, frowned and shook his fist at them, the being whom he
loved most on earth-far beyond himself, his daughter, and the
memory of their mother, all multiplied into each other,-that boy
Bob came up to him, and said, "Father, don't, for my sake.”
We have not heard much of Bob Garnet yet ; we have scarcely
shaped him feebly; by no means was he a negative character, yet
described most briefly by negatives. In every main point, except
two, he was his father's cardinal opposite. Those two were gene.
rosity (which combines the love of truth with a certain warmth of
impulse) and persevering energy. Even those two were displayed
in ways entirely different, but the staple was very similar.
Bob Garnet' was a naturalist. Gentle almost as any girl, and
more so than his sister, he took small pleasure in the ways of men,
intense delight in those of every other creature. Bob loved ali

things God had made, even as fair Amy did. All his day, and all his
life, he would have spent, if he had the chance, among the ferns and
mosses, the desmidia of the forest pools, the sun-dew and the fungi,
the buff-tips and red underwings, privet-hawks, and emperors. He
knew all the children of the spring and handmaids of the summer,
all of autumn's laden train and the comforters of winter. The
happiest of mankind is he whose stores of life are endless, whose
pure delights can never cloy, who sees and feels in every birth, in
every growth or motion, his own Almighty Father; and loving Hiin
is loved again, as a child in the lap of his parent.
Mr. Garnett's affection for this boy surpassed the love of women.
He petted, and patted, and coaxed him, and talked nonsense to him
by the hour; he was jealous even of Bob's attachment to his sister
Pearl ; in short, all the energy of his goodness, which, like the rest
of his energies, transcended the force of other men's, centred and
spent itself mainly there. But of late Bob had passed all his time
with his mother-we mean, of course, with Nature; for his mother in
the flesh was dead many a year ago. He had now concluded, with
perfect contentment, that his education was finished ; and to have
the run of the forest at this unwonted season more than consoled
him for the disgrace of his recent expulsion from school.
Scarcely any one would believe that Bob Garnet, the best and
gentlest boy that ever cried over Euripides—not from the pathos of
the poet, but the smart of private tragedy-Bob Garnet, who sang
to snails to come out, and they felt that he could not beat them,
should have been expelled disgracefully from a private school, whose
master must needs expel his own guineas with every banished pupil.
However, so it
was,
and the crime was characteristic. No punish-
ment would keep him from sitting at night in the lime-trees.
Those lime-trees overhung the grey stone wall of the playground
near Southampton; and some wanton boys had been caught up
there, holding amoibæans with little nursemaids and girls of all
work, come out to get lung-and-tongue food. Thereupon a stern
ukase was issued that the next boy caught up there would be
expelled without trial, as the corrupter of that pure flock. The
other boys laughed, most sad to say, when “Bob the natural,” as
they called him, meaning thereby the naturalist, was the first to be
discovered there, crawling upon a branch as cleverly as a looper
caterpillar. Even then the capital sentence was commuted that
time, for every master knew, as well as every boy, that Bob could
“say bo” to a gosling of the feminine gender. So Bob had
to learn the fourth Georgic by heart, and did most of it (with some
consolation) up in that very same tree. For he kept all his cater-
pillars there, his beetle-traps, his moth-nets, even some glorious
pupæ, which were due at the end of August; and he nursed a snug
little fernery, and had sown some mistletoe seeds, and a dozen
other delicious things, and the lime-hawks wanted to burrow soon;

in a word, it was Bob's hearth and heart-place, for no other boy
could scale it. But just when Bob had got to the beginning of
Aristæus, and the late bees were buzzing around him, although the
linden had berried, an officious usher spied the boy, and his little
eyes twinkled with the joy of detection.
Boy in the tree there! I see you! Your name this moment,
Garnet, sir, Bob Garnet. And if you please, sir, I am not a
rascal.”
“Come down, sir, this very instant; or else I'll come up after you.”
“I don't think you can, sir," replied Bob, looking down com-
placently; for, as we shall see by and by, he was no coward in an
emergency
If
you please, sir, no boy in the school can climb
this tree except me, sir, since Brown senior left.”
“I can tell you one thing, Garnet : it's the last time you'll ever
climb it."
"Oh, then, I must collect my things; I am sorry to keep you
waiting, sir. But they are such beauties, and I can't see well to
pack them.”
Bob packed up his treasures deliberately in his red pocket-
handkerchief, and descended very cleverly, holding it with bis
teeth. The next morning he had to pack his box, and became in
the school a mere legend.
His father flew into a violent passion, not with the son, but the
schoolmaster : however, he was so transported with joy at getting
his own Bob home again, that he soon forgave the cause of it. So
the boy got the run of the potato-fields, pollard-trees, and rushy
pools, and hunted and grubbed and dabbled, and came home
sometimes with three handkerchiefs, not to mention his hat, full.
One lovely day this October, soon after Cradock left Nowel-
hurst, and before the frost set in-a frost of a length and severity
most rare at that time of year-Bob Garnet took his basket and
trowel, nets, lens, &c., and set out for a sandy patch, not far from
the stream by the Rectory, where in his July holidays he had found
some Gladiolus Illyricus, a bloom of which he had carried home,
and now he wanted some roots of it. He could not think why his
father left him so very much to himself now, and had ceased from
those little caresses and fondlings which used to make Bob look
quite ashamed sometimes in the presence of strangers. He felt
that his father loved him quite as much as ever, and he had found
those strong eyes set upon him with an expression, as it appeared
to him, of sorrow and compassion. He had a great mind to ask
what the matter was; but his love for his father was a strange
feeling, mixed with some' dread and uncertainty. He would make
Pearl tell him all about it, that would be the best way; for she as
well had been carrying on very oddly of late. She sat in her own
room all day long, and would never come down to dinner, and

would never come out for a stroll with him, but slipped out by her-
self sometimes in the evening ; that, at least, he was sure of. And
to tell him indeed, him going on now for seventeen years of age,
that he was too young to ask questions ! He would let her know,
he was quite resolved, that because she happened to be two years
older-a pretty reason that was for treating him like a baby! She
who didn't know a wire-worm from a ring-worm, nor an elater from
a tipula, and thought that the tippet-moth was a moth that fed upon
tippets ! Recalling fifty other instances of poor Pearl's deep
ignorance, Bob grew more and more indignant, as he thought of
the way she treated him. He would stand it no longer. If she
was in trouble, that was only the greater reason Holloa !
Helter-skelter, off dashed Bob after a Queen of Spain fritillary,
the first he had ever seen on the wing, and a grand prize for any
collector, even of ten times his standing. It was one of the second
brood, invited by the sun to sport awhile. And rare sport it
afforded Bob, who knew it at once from the other fritillaries, for
the shape of the wings is quite different, and he had seen it in
grand collections. An active little chap it was, greatly preferring
life to death, and thoroughly aware that man is the latter's prime
minister. Once Bob made quite sure of it, for it had settled on a
blackberry-spray, and smack the net came down upon it, but a
smack too hard, for the thorns came grinning out at the bottom,
and away went the butterfly laughing. Bob made good the net in
a moment with some very fine pins that he carried, and off again in
still hotter pursuit, having kept his eyes on dear Lathonia. But
the prey was now grown wondrous skeary since that narrow shave,
and the huntsman saw that his only chance was a clever swoop in
mid air. So he raised his net high, and zig-zagged recklessly
round the trees, through the bushes, up the banks and down them.
At last he got quite close to her, but she flipped round a great
beech-trunk; Bob made a cast at hazard, and caught, not the
Queen, but Amy.
Amy was not frightened much, neither was she hurt, though her
pretty round head came out through the net—for she had taken
her hat off—and the ring lay upon her shoulders, which the rich
hair had shielded from bruises. She would have been startled, no
doubt, a good deal, only she knew what was going on, and had
stepped behind the tree to avoid the appearance of interfering.
For she did not wish-she knew not why—but, by some instinct,
she did not wish to have much to do with the Garnets. She
regarded poor Bob as a school-boy, who was very fond of insects,
and showed his love by killing them.
But if Amy was not frightened much, Bob, the captor, was. He
dropped the handle of his net, and fell back against the beech-tree.
Then Amy laughed, and took off the net, or the relics of the gauze
at least, and kindly held out her hand to him, and said, -

“Oh, how you are grown!”
“And so are you. Oh dear me, have you seen her? Have you
seen her?"
“Seen whom ?” asked Amy, “my aunt, Miss Rosedew? There
she is, by the ash-tree.”
“The Queen of Spain, Miss Rosedew, the Queen of Spain
fritillary! Oh, tell me which way she went ! If I lose her, I am
done for !”
“Then, I fear, Master Garnet ”—["Confound it,” thought Bob,
"how all the girls do patronize me !"]—“I am very much afraid
you must make up your mind to annihilation, if by the 'Queen of
Spain' you mean that common brown little butterfly you wanted
just now to kill so much.”
“Is she gone across the river, then? That is nothing, I assure
you. I would go through fire after her. Oh, tell me, only tell
me."
Amy could not help laughing ; poor Bob looked so ridiculous,
fitting a new net all the time upon the ring of the old one, the
crown of his hat beaten down on his forehead, his trousers kicked
well up over his boots, and his coat an undoubted ventilator.
“I really don't know,” said Amy; “how could you expect me to
see through your shrimp-net, Master Garnet ?”
“Oh, I beg your pardon-how stupid I am, to be sure-
-I beg
your pardon a thousand times; really I might have hurt you. I
would not do that for "
“Even the Queen of Spain. To tell you the truth, Master
Garnet, if I knew where she was gone I would not tell you, because
I can't bear to have things killed. In my opinion, it is so cruel.”
“Oh !” cried Bob, a very long “oh," of amazement at such an
idea ; and he looked at Amy all the time he was saying it, which
was a wonderful thing for him to do. Then it occurred to his
mind, for the first time possibly, what a beautiful creature she was,
more softly shaded than a Chalk-hill blue, and richer than a cream-
spotted tiger-moth! The moment he felt this Bob was done for ;
Amy had caught her captor.
Flushed as he was with the long, hot chase, his cheeks grew
hotter and redder as he got a dim consciousness of a few of the
things which he was feeling. He was like a chrysalis, touched in
the winter, when it goes on one side from the crust of the thorax,
and sometimes can never get right again. After having said “oh,"
with emphasis and so much diæresis, Bob did not feel called upon
for any further utterance till Amy was gone to her Aunt Eudoxia ;
and then he contrived to say, “Ah!” He was more put out than
he had been even when his pet poplar-hawk caterpillar was devoured
alive by ichneumon grubs. He went round the tree ever so many
times, and wondered what was the matter with him, how he came
there, and what he was doing.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Alas, poor Bob! Nature, who overlooks nothing, was well aware
of the difficulties when she cried, “ Jump up on my lap, Bob, and
never be weaned from me." She knew that things of all sorts
would come between herself and her child, some of them drawn
from her own mother-milk, but most of them from man's muzzling.
Of the latter she had not much fear with Bob; but the former, she
knew, were beyond her, and she had none but herself to thank for
them. She knew that the lad, so strongly imbued with her own
pleasant affluences, was almost sure to be touched with that one
which comes from her breast the warmest. And then what would
become of zoology, phytology, entomology, and all the other yard-
long names which her children spin out of her apron-strings?
While Bob was still fiddling with his fingers, and forgetting all
about butterflies, Miss Eudoxia, called by Amy, came to hold
discourse with him.
“Why, Master Robert, I do declare, Robert, my butterfly boy! I
have not seen you for such a time, Robert.” And she held out her
hand, which Bob took with very little sense of gratitude. To be
called a “butterfly boy” before Amy, and Amy to acquiesce in it!
“Ah, you think I have nothing for you, Robert. You school-
boys live upon suction. But just wait a moment, my dear.”
She drew forth an old horn comfit-box, which had belonged to
her grandmother, and was polished up like amber from the chafing
of many a lining. This she opened with much ado, poured three
crinkled sugar-plums on her gloved palm, and a smooth one as
large as a hazel-nut, and offered them all to Robert, with a smile of
the finest patronage.
No, thank you, Miss Rosedew; no, thank you. I am very
much obliged to you.”.
Miss Eudoxia had been wondering at her own generosity, and
thought that he was overcome with it. So her smile became one
of encouragement and assurance against self-sacrifice.
“Oh, you need not be afraid, Robert. And you can put some
under your pillow, and wake up in the night and suck them. How
nice that will be, to be sure ! You see I know what boys are. And
I have plenty left for the infant-school. And they don't deserve
them as you do, Robin.”
Miss Rosedew," said Bob, in his loftiest manner, though he
was longing for them, only that Amy was there ; "you will believe
me when I assure you that I never touch sweets of any sort ; not
even at a late dinner-party."
Miss Eudoxia turned her eyes up, and almost dropped the sugar-
plums. But Amy, instead of being impressed, merrily laughed, and
said,
“Give them to me, then, auntie, please. Some of the men at
the night-school eat sweets after early suppers.”
Bob said "good-bye” disconsolately, for he knew that he had

affronted Miss Rosedew, without rising in Amy's opinion. He forgot
all about the gladiolus, and let many great prizes escape him; for
the day was the last of the soft and sunny, which tempt forth the
forest denizens ere the frosty seal is set on them. In the glimpses
of every brown arcade, in the jumbled gleam of the underwood, in
the alleys between the upstanding trees, even in the strong light
where the gold patches shone, and the wood fell back to look at
them, in all of these he seemed to see and then to lose his angel.
Her face he could not see clearly yet, hard as he strove to do it ;
affection is, but love is not, a photographic power. Still he could
see her shadowly; her attitude, the fall of her hair, the manner of
her gestures; even the ring of her voice would seem to dwell about
the image. But he never got them altogether; one each time was
the leading thing ; vague; and yet it went through him.
He made one attempt—for he feared from the first, although he
never could feel it so, that his love was a thorough wild-goose chase
-the poor boy made one last attempt to catch at some other pursuit.
“Father," he said that very same night, after sitting for hours of
wandering, “ will you give me a gun and let me take to shooting ?"
“A gun !" cried Bull Garnet, starting; a gun, Bob? What do
you mean by that?”
“I meant nothing at all, father. Only I know the way to stuff
birds, and there are some rare ones here sometimes, and I want to
inake a collection."
“Bob Garnet, as long as I am alive, you never shall have a gun.”
“ Then, will you lend me yours, father? I know very well how
to use it. I mean your patent-
“Never, Bob. My son, if you love me, never speak of it again.”
CHAPTER XXXI.
THE RISING OF THE STORM.
THAT very same day, when Miss Rosedew and her niece came
in to get ready for dinner, Amy cried out suddenly, “Oh, only
look at the roses, aunt; how they have opened to-day! What de-
licious Louise Odier, and just look at General Jacqueminot ! and I
do declare Jules Margottin is finer than he was at Midsummer. I
must cut a few, for I know quite well there will come a great frost
if I don't, and then where will all my loves be?”
Amy's prediction about the weather was as random a guess as
we may find in great authorities, who are never right, although they
give the winds sixteen points of the thirty-two to shuffle in. But it

so turned out that the girl was right-a point of the compass never
hit till a day too late by our weather-clerks.
That very same night such a frost set in as had not been known
in October for very nearly a century. It lasted nine nights and
eight days; twice the mercury fell more than half way from the
freezing point to zero, and the grass was crisp in the shade all day,
though the high sun wiped off the whiteness at noon wherever he
found the way to it. Boys rejoiced, and went mitching, to slide on
the pools of the furzery: no boys since their great-grandfathers had
done the heel-tap in October.
But the birds did not see the fun of it. What in the world did it
mean? Why, there were the hips not ripe yet, and the holly-berries
come to no colour, and half the blackberries still too sour, and lo!
it was freezing hard enough to make a worm cold for the stomach,
even if one could get him! Surely there was some stupid mistake
of two months in the piper's almanac.
The trees of the forest as well were amazed, and stood in the cold
air shivering, having lost all the comfort of their leaves before the
sap was out of them. When the evening settled down to freeze,
and the chilly stars looked through them, and the late forester
hasted home with the fagot to keep his children warm, and the crisp
sleuth step of frost began to make things shrink and crackle,
what could ancient trees do more than enter stubborn protest?
However, in this unaccountable mood of the weather they had no
choice, except to make the best of it. So each, according to his
sort, offered to the ungenial weather deference or defiance; some
hung sadly limp with numbness and distressed with frozen leaves ;
others lifted rigid antlers more keenly outlined by the cold, more
rugged and of veteran aspect, where their moss was barbed with
ice.
In the learts of these nobler trees, and among ancestral harbour-
age, the small birds flocked with their rustle and flutter, even be-
fore the bright sun went down. Bed is the warmest place after all ;
and in such weather what better thing could a hungry warbler find to
do? Why, a bird might dig, and tap, and jump, and add emphasis
with his tail, and cock his peartest eye down splendidly, or even
flick round a great tuft of grass, and wait there ever so patient, yet
never so much as new-born worm came up for the latest intelli-
gence. Therefore, with their feathers ruffled to an alarming bulk
almost, and a mighty fuss of chirrups sinking into sleepy twitters,
in they nestled, side by side, tucking their little heads under their
wings quite placidly and cosily, nor heeded how the cold rime
settled on gray twig and on good brown leaf.
John Rosedew met the prettiest bird that ever had nest in the New
Forest, his own little duck of an Amy, in the passage by the parlour-
door, at eight o'clock in the morning of that 25th of October. He
kissed her white forehead lovingly, according to early usage; then

he glanced at the weather-glass, and went nearer, as if his short
sight had cheated him.
Why, Amy dear, you must have forgotten to set the glass last
night.”
No, indeed, papa. I set it very carefully. You know I can do
it as well as you can, since you showed me the way. It was just a
little hollow last night, and I moved the Vernier scale just a hun-
dredth part of an inch downwards, and then it was ten o'clock.”
“ Then I fear there is some great danger hanging over all sea-
faring men, especially our poor boatmen, and the dredging people
of Rushford !"
Mr. Rosedew, as has been said before, was parson of Rushford as
well as of Nowelhurst. At the former place he kept a curate, but
looked after the poor people none the less, for the distance was only
six miles ; and now, as his legs were getting stiff, he had bought
Coræbus to help him. Rushford lies towards the eastern end of the
great Hurst shingle bank, the most dangerous part of Christchurch
Bay, being fully exposed to the south-west gales, and just in the run
of the double tide : in the eddy of the Needles.
Why, what is the matter, papa ? Even if it rains, it won't hurt
them much. And as lovely a morning as ever was seen, and the
white frost sparkling beautifully. What a magnificent sunrise ! Or,
at least, a very grand one."
“Sibi temperat unda carinis.' All is smooth for the present.
But I heard the lash of the ground-sea last night quite early, and
quite late again. Fetch my telescope, darling, and come with me to
the green room. We can see thence to St. Alban's Head; but the
danger is for those beyond it. All the ships on this side of it will have
time to work up the Solent. Never before have I known the mercury
fall as it has done now. An inch and a tenth in only ten hours !
When they went to bed on the previous night, the quicksilver
stood at 30° 10'. Now it was at 29°, and cupped like the bottom of
a champagne bottle, which showed that it still fell rapidly. But as
yet the silver of the frost was sparkling on the lawn, and the morn-
ing sun looked up the heavens, as if he felt all right. Nevertheless,
it was but show: he is bound to make the best of it, and, like all
other warm-hearted beings, sometimes has sorry work there.
When they saw that no large craft had rounded St. Alban's Head,
only that the poor cement-dredgers were working away at septaria,
John and his daughter went to breakfast, hoping that no harm
would be, while Aunt Eudoxia lay in bed, and reflected on her own
good qualities.
Amy came out after breakfast, without any bonnet or hat on, to
make her own observations. That girl so loved the open air, the
ever-glorious concave, the frank palm of the hand of God, that she
felt as if she had not' bowed before her Friend and Maker, the all-
giving, the all-loving One, until she had paid her orisons and sung

her morning hymn with His own ceiling over her. So now she
walked beneath the branches laden with His jewellery, and over the
ground hard-trodden by ministers doing His will, and beside the
spear and the flat-grass, chilled with the awe of His breath, and
among the wailing flowers, wailing and black and shrivelled up,
because His face was cold to them.
For these poor Amy grieved sadly, for she was just beginning to
care again for the things whose roots were outside of her. Lo, the
bright chrysanthemums, plumed, reflex, and fimbriate ; lo, the gor-
geous dahlias, bosses quilled and plaited tight, and wrought with
depth of colour; and then the elegant asters cushioned, cochleate,
praying only to have their eyes looked into; most of all, her own
sweet roses, chosen flowers of the chosen land- they hung their
heads, and stuck together, as brown as a quartered apple. Who
could look at them, who could think of them, and not feel as if some
of herself were dead ?
Now, walking there, this youthful maiden, fairest of Nature's
works and purest, began to employ her eyes and mind upon the
strange and varying aspect of the world around her. Not that she
could enter into all these subtle delicacies any more than a writer
may hope to trace them ; for observation is the child as well as the
nurse of experience; and the girlish mind (and the boyish too, at
any rate for the most part) troubles itself very little about the ap-
pearances of nature. How seldom do we meet a lady who knows
what way the wind is ! All women believe that it must freeze
harder when the sky is cloudy ; not one in fifty but trembles more
at the thunder than at the lightning.
Yet Amy, with true woman's instinct, being alarmed for the lives
of others, after her father's prediction, looked around her carefully.
And first her eyes went upwards, and they were right in doing so.
Of the sky she knew less than nothing-although herself well known
there; but the trees—come now, she was perfectly sure she knew
something about the trees. So she did, as a child of the forest ;
and yet a very wee little ; though more than half the ladies do. She
knew an elm from a wych-elm, and a hornbeam from a beech; and
what more could be expected ?
The rime upon the dark tree-boles and the forward push of the
branches, the rime of white fur, newly breathen but an hour ago,
when a flaw from the east came cat-like, and went through without
stirring any thing ; this delicate down from the lips of morning,
this silk-work upon night-rleece, was, as all most beautiful is, the
first to fleet and vanish. Changing into a doubtful glister, which
you must touch to be sure of it, then trickling away into beaded
drops, like a tear that takes no denial, it came down the older and
harder rime, and perhaps would bring that into its. humour, and
perhaps would get colder and freeze again into little lumps, like the
ſeak froin a tap. Then the white face of the rough pillared trurks,

pearled with glistening purity, showed half-round scollops of black
or brown, where the bark was re-appearing, like a growing eclipse of
the rnoon, or the sweep of a scythe in the morning. Even the bars
of gates and palings, deeply mantled with ruffled ermine, and each
at sunrise flashing like a tray of splintered diamonds, even these,
however, serried with a million sparkling barbs, showed an ominous
streak of wet, and from fur passed into wool, and from wool to yarn,
and then collapsed into mere shoddy.
But the notable sight of all, at least to a loitering mind and body,
the one of brightest interest, was to see the hoar-frost slowly lifting
its sensitive wing from the grass. There the broad spread of the
frost-dew, beading on each lance of green, crossing spears wherever
space of wider leaf was given it, and crocketed and shed with
spangles where the depth of occasion lay, and in and out and every
where scattering candid lavishment_already this crispness and its
crackling were beginning to run to wet.
But throughout the sparkling scene and among the hovering
changes on the boles of the trees, and the bars of the gate, the
ridge of the ruts, and the dapples of lawn,-one thing Amy observed
which puzzled her, for even she knew that it was quite contrary to
all usage. The thaw was not on the south side or the south-east
side of any thing, though the sickly sun was gazing there ; but the
melting came from the north, and took the frost aback.
She won-
dered vainly about it, but the matter was simple enough, like most of
the things which we wonder at, instead of at our own ignorance. A
flaw of warm air from the north had set in ; a lower warp which
shot through and threaded the cold south-eastern woof. So subtle
was this sure precursor of the conflict in the air, that even the dead
leaves scarcely lifted their brown edges to it, and shivered without
rustling. More often we see a frost break up with a shift of the
wind to the south-east and south, a gradual relaxing, a fusion of
warmer air, and a great effusion of damp, a blanket of clouds for the
earth, and a doubt in the sky how to use them. Then the doubt
ends-as many other doubts end-in precipitation. The wind
chops round to the west of south ; the moisture condenses outside
our windows, instead of starring the inside ; and then come a few
spits of rain. But the rain is not often heavy at first, although it is
stinging and biting,-a rain which is half ashamed of itself, as if it
ought to be hail.
But, after all, these things depend on things we cannot depend
upon,-moods of the air to be multiplied into humours of the earth
and sea, and the product traversed, indorsed, divided, touched, and
sliced at every angle by solar, nar, and astral influences.
“Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.
“Blest is the man who knows when to carry his umbrella."
While yet the maiden watched and wondered, the sky began to be

slurred across with white clouds breathing out from it, as a child
breathes on the blade of a knife, or on a carriage window. These
blots of cloud threw feelers out, and strung themselves together,
until a broad serried and serrate bar went boldly across the heavens,
from south-east to north-west. It marked the point whence the
gale would begin, and the quarter where it would end. From this
great bar, on either side, dappled and mottled, like the wash of sepia
on a drawing, little offsets straggled away, and began to wisp with a
spiral motion, slow and yet perceptible.
This went on for an hour or two, darkening and deepening con-
tinually, amassing more and more of the sky, gathering vapours
to it, and embodying as it gathered them. But still there was some
white wan sunshine through the mustering cloud-blots and the
spattering mud of the heavens; and still the good folk who had
suffered from chilblains, and found it so much milder, exclaimed,
6. What a beautiful day !"
Then about noon a mock sun appeared, feeble, wild, and haggard,
whose mates on the crown and the east of the arc could scarcely
keep him in countenance. Over all this, and over the true sun and
the cirrhous outrunners, heavily drove at one o'clock the laden and
leaden cumulus, blurred on the outskirts with cumulostrate, and
daubed with lumps of vapour which mariners call " Noah's arks.”
Then came the first sough of the wind, and thrilled throughout
the forest-a long, prolonged, deep-drawn, dry sob, a hollow and
mysterious sound, that shivered through the shadowy leaves, and
moaned among the tree-boles. Away went every beast and bird
that knew the fearful signal: the deer lanced away to the holm-
frith ; the cattle in huffs came belloking to the lew of the boughy
trees; the hogs ran together, and tossed their snouts, and skittered
home from the ovest; the squirrel hied to his hollow dray, the
weasel slunk to his tuffet lair, and every rabbit skipped home from
grass. The crows and the magpies were all in a churm; the heavy-
winged heron flapped off from the brook-side ; the jar-bird ficked
out from the ivy-drum ; the yaffingale darted across the ride with
his strange discordant laugh; even the creepers that ply the trees
crept into lichened fastnesses, lay flat to the bark, and listened.
Nor less the solid, heavy powers that have to stay and break the
storm, no less did they, the beechen clump, the funnelled glens, the
heathery breastwork, even the depths of forest night-whence com-
mon winds shrink back affrighted-even the bastions of Norman
oak, scarred by many a tempest-siege, and buckled by the mighty
gale of 1703,-one and all they trembled at the stress of heaven
impending.
1 The writer has been blamed for using words of the forest, in attempting
to describe a forest-storm; but he hopes that common sense as well as
local feeling will be with him, when the stormy winds do blow,

THE RISING OF THE STORM.
177
First came fitful scuds of rain, “Aisky” rain they call it, loose
outriders of the storm, spurning the soft ice, as they dashed by, and
lashing the woodman's windows. Then a short dark pause ensued,
in which the sky swirled up with clouds, and the earth lay mute
with terror. Only now and then a murmur went along the up-
lands.
Suddenly, ere a man might say, “Good God!" or, “Where are
my children ?” every tree was taken aback, every peat-stack reeled
and staggered, every cot was stripped of its thatch, on the opposite
side to that on which the blow was expected.
The first squall of that great tempest broke from the dark south-
east. It burst through the sleet, and dashed it upwards like an
army of archers shooting ; ere a man could stay himself one way, it
had caught him up from another. The leaves from the ground
flew up again through the branches which had dropped them ; and
then a cloud of all inanner of foliage, whirling, flustering, capering,
fitting, soared high over the highest tree-tops, and drove through
the sky, like dead shooting-stars.
Faster and faster flew the mad squalls after one another, scream-
ing onward and bellowing back, dashing in and swooping out, lash-
ing themselves and every thing. Then there came a lull. So sud-
den that the silence was more stunning than the turmoil. A pause
for sunset ; for brave men countless to see their last of sunlight.
That evening, the sundown gun from Calshot was heard over all
the forest.
Many of us expected fully that the next rush of air would come,
like a heavy sigh, from the south-west. The expectation showed
how much we underrated the magnitude of that broad storm's area.
If the wind had chopped then, it would have been only a hard gale,
not a hurricane.
Like a wave of the sea, it came again solidly, and from the old
direction; no squall, no gust, no blast, any more ; but one bodily
rush of phalanxed air through a chasm in the firmament. Gaily
tossing tree and tower as a girl jerks up her hat-plume, it swept the
breadth of land and sea, as bisons horded sweep the snow-drifts, as
Niagara breaks a cobweb.
Where the full force of that tempest broke, any man must have
been mad or drunk who attempted to go to bed. Houses unroofed,
great trees snapped off and Aung into another tree, men caught like
chaff from the winnowing and dropped somewhere in pond or
gravel-pit, the carrier's van overthrown on the road, and three oaks
come down to lie upon it,-some blown-away people brought news
of these things, and fetched their breath up to tell them.
Our own staunch hearths rocked under us, and we looked for the
walls to fall in upon us, as every mad rush came plunging.
Miss Rosedew was trying to sit with Amy, near the kitchen fire ;
at least where the fire should have been, but the wind had quenched

it long ago. Near them cowered Jemima and Jenny, begging not
to be sent to bed. They had crawled up-stairs to see about it, and
the floor rose at them-as they declared-like the shifting plate of
the oven. The parlour chimney-stack had fallen; but the sweep of
the wind had borne it clear and harmless from the roof; and the
thatch was welcome to take fire. That wind would have blown out
the fire of London.
Now as they sat, or crouched and sidled, watching the cracks of
the ceiling above, starting every now and then, as big lumps of
mortar fell down the chimney, and shrinking into themselves, every
time the kitchen stack groaned and laboured so, Miss Rosedew,
with a wholesome spirit, was reading aloud-to little purpose, for
she scarcely could hear her own voice-the prayers which are
meant to be used at sea, and the 107th Psalm. And who shall say
that she was wrong, especially as the devil is ever so busy in a gale
of wind ?
Jemima and Amy were doing their best to catch her voice at
intervals. As for Jenny, she did not care much what became of her
now, not she. She knew at the last full moon that her sweetheart
was thoroughly up for jilting her; and now when she had ventured
out-purely of her own self-will—the wind had taken her up any
how, and whisked her like a snow-flake against the wash-house
door. She was sure to have a black eye in the morning, and then
it would be all up with her; and Jemima might go sweethearting,
and she could not keep her company,
The roar through the wood, the yells at the corners, the bellowing
round the chimneys, the thunder of the implacable hurricane; any
mortal voice was less than a whisper into a steam-whistle. Who
could tell what trees were falling ? A monster might be hurled on
the roof, and not one of them would know it until it came sheer
through the ceiling. Amy was pale as the cinders before her, but
firm as the bars of iron, and even trying to smile sometimes at the
shrieks and queer turns of the tempest. No candle could be kept
alight, and the flame of the parlour lamp shook like a mitten
dancing on the washing-line. But Amy was thinking dearly of the
father of the household, the father of the parish, out in the blinding
wind and rain, and where the wild waves were lashing. And now
and then Amy wondered whether it blew so hard in London, and
hoped they had no big chimneys there.
John Rosedew had taken his little bundle, in a waterproof case,
and set out on foot for Rushford, when the storm became unmistake-
able. He would not ride Coræbus ; first because he would have
found it impossible to wipe him dry, secondly because the wind
has such purchase upon a man when he is up there on the pommel.
So the rector strode off in his stoutest manner, an hour or so before
nightfall, and the rain went into him, neck and shoes, before he got
to the peat-rick. To a resolute man, who feels sometimes that the

human hide wants tanning, there are few greater pleasures than
getting basted and cracklin'd by the wet wind; only it must not
come too often, neither last too long.
So John was in excellent spirits, quelching along and going pop
like a ball of India-rubber, when he came on a weaker fellow-mortal,
stuck fast in a chair of beech-roots.
“Why, Robert !” said Mr. Rosedew, and nine tenths of his voice
went to leeward ; “Robert, my boy ;-oh dear!”
That last exclamation followed in vain John's favourite old hat,
which every one in the parish loved, especially the children. The
hat went over the crest of the hill, and leaped into an oak-tree, and
was seen no more but of turtle doves, who built therein next summer,
and for three or four generations; and all the doves were blessed,
for the sake of the man who sought peace and ensued it.
“Let me go after it,” cried Bob, with his knees and teeth knock-
ing together.
“To be sure I will,” replied John Rosedew--the nearest approach
to irony that the worst wind ever took him ; now, Robert, come
with me.”
He hooked the light stripling, hard and firm, to his own staunch,
powerful frame, and, like a steamer lashed alongside, forced him
across the wind-brunt. And so, by keeping the covered ways, by
running the grooves of the hurricane, they both got safe to Rush-
ford; to which achievement Bob's loving knowledge of every inch
of the forest contributed at least as much as the stern strength of
the parson.
Pretty Bob had no right, of course, to be out there at that time
but he had heard of a glorious company of the death's-head cater-
pillar, in a snug potato-field, scooped from out the woodlands. He
knew that they must have burrowed now, and so he set out to dig
for them with his little hand-fork, directly the thaw allowed him.
Any thing to divert his mind, or rather revert it into the natural
channel. He had dreamed about sugar-plums, and Amy, and
butterfly-nets, and Queens of Spain, and his father scowling over
all, until his brain, at that sensitive time, was like a sirex, trying
to get out, but stuck fast by the antennæ.
Now Bob, though awake to the little tricks and pleasant ways of
Nature, as observed in cricks and crannies, knew nothing as yet of
her broader moods, her purging sweeps, her clearances,-in a word,
he was a stranger to the law of storms. Therefore he got a bitter
lesson, and one which set him a-thinking. John Rosedew, with his
grand bare head bent forward to the wind-blow, and the grey locks
sweeping backward-how Amy would have cried !-towed Bob
Garnet down the combe which spreads out to the sea at Rushford.
The fall of the waves was short and hard-no long ocean rollers
yet, only an angry beating surf, sputtering under the gravel-cliff.
They found some shelter in the hollow, which opens to the south-

south-west; for though it was blowing as hard as ever, the wind
had not canted round yet; and the little village of Rushford, upon
which the sea is gaining so, was happy enough in its “bunny,”
and could keep its candles burning.
“ I'll go home with the boy at sundown, when the gale breaks, as
I hope it will. His father will be in a sad state of mind; and I
know what that man is. But I could not leave the boy there, neither
could I go back again."
So said John Rosedew, lulled by the shelter, feeling as if he had
frightened himself and all his household for nothing; almost
ashamed to show himself at Octavius Pell's sea-cottage, the very
last dwelling of the village. But Octave Pell knew better. He had
not lived upon that coast, fagging out as a cricketer of the Church
of England, with his feet and his hands ready always, and his
spiked shoes holding the ground,—he had not been on the outside
of all things, hoping for innings some day, without looking up at
the skies sometimes, and guessing about promotion. So he knew
that his rector, whom he revered beyond all the fathers of men or
women-for he too was soft upon Amy-he saw that his rector was
right in coming, except for his own dear sake.
Mr. Rosedew came in, with his shapely legs stuck all tight in the
shrunk kerseymere (shrunk, and varnished, and puckered like plait-
ing, from the pelt of the rain), and by one hand still he drew the
quenched and welty Bob. The wind was sucking round the cliff,
and the door flew open hard enough for a weak man's legs to go
with it. But “Octave” Pell-as he was called, because he must
sing, though he could not-the Reverend Octavius was of a sturdy
order, well-balanced and steady-going. He drew in his reeking
visitors, and dried, and fed, and warmed them; Bob being lodged
in a suit of clothes which he could only inhabit sparsely. Then
Pell laid aside his rose-root pipe out of deference to his rector, and
made Bob drink hot brandy-and-water till he chattered more than
his teeth had done.
That curate was a fine young fellow, a B.A. of John Rosedew's
college, to whom John had given a title for orders-not sold it, as
some rectors do, for a twelvemonth's stipend. A tall, strong, gen-
tlemanly parson, stuck up in no wise, nor stuck down; neither of
the High nor Low Church rut, although an improvement on the old
type which cared for none of these things. He did his duty by his
parish; and, as follows almost of necessity, his parish loved and
admired him. He never lifted a poor man's pot-lid to know what
he had for dinner ; he never made much of sectarian squabbles, nor
tried to exorcise dissent. In a word, he kept his place, because he
felt and loved it.
Only two rooms had Pell to boast of, but he was wonderfully
happy in them. He could find all his property in the dark, and had
only one silver spoon. And the man who can be happy with one,

was born with it in his mouth. Those two rooms he rented frona
old Jacob Thwarthawse, or rather from Mrs. Jacob, for the old man
was a pilot on the Southampton Water, and scarcely home twice in
a twelvemonth. The little cot looked like a boat-house at the
bottom of the bunny; so close it was to the high-water mark, that
the froth of the waves and the drifting skates' eggs came almost up
to the threshold when the tide ran big, and the wind blew fresh.
And in the gentle summer night-pray what is it in Theocritus ?
John Rosedew could tell, but not 1—at least, I mean without
looking,
“Along the pinch'd caboose, on every side,
With mincing murmur swam the ocean tide."
ID. xxi, 17.
CHAPTER XXXII.
THE FURY OF THE STORM.
By the time Octavius Pell had clothed, and fed, and warmed his
drenched and buffeted guests, the sun was slipping out of sight, and
glad to be quit of the mischief. For a minute or two the cloud-
curtain lifted over St. Alban's Head, and a narrow bar oí lively
green striped the lurid heavens. This was the critical period, and
Mr. Rosedew was aware of it, as well as Octave Pell. Either the
wind would shift to south-west quicker than vanes could keep time
with it, and then there would be a lively storm, with no very wide
area; or else it would come on again with one impetuous leap and
roar, and no change of direction, and work to the south-west
gradually, blowing harder until it got there.
The sea was not very heavy yet, when they went out to look at
it; the rain had ceased altogether; there was not air enough to
ruffle the fur on the back of a rabbit; but, out in the far and foamy
offing, great brown trenches of jagged water cast up combing
ridges.
“Your eyes are young, Mr. Pell,” said the rector; “is there any
ship in sight?"
No," replied Pell, “and I'm heartily glad that there is no ship
in sight; for, unless I'm much mistaken-run, sir, run like light-
ning. I've got no more dry clothes."
They ran for it, and were just in time before the fury came down
again.' Bob Garnet was ready to slip away, for he knew that his
father would be wild about him; he had taken his drenched hat

from the firetongs, and was tugging at the latch of the door. But
now there was no help for it.
“Now we shall have it,” said Mr. Rosedew; I have not come
down for nothing. It is, what I feared this morning, the lieaviest
storm that has broken upon us for at least a generation. And we
are not yet come to the worst of it. God grant there be no unfor-
tunate ship making for the Needles. All our boats, as you told me,
Pell, are in the Solent long ago. Robert, my boy, you must not
expect to see your father until to-morrow. Of course he will guess
what has happened."
The beach, or pebble bank of Hurst, is a long and narrow spit of
land, growing narrower every year, which forms a natural break-
water to the racing frith of the Solent. It curves away to the south
of east from the straighter and more lofty coast of Barton, Hordle,
and Rushford. Hurst Castle, in which it terminates, is the eastern
horn of Christchurch Bay, as Hengistbury Head is the western.
The Isle of Wight and the Needle Rocks protect this bay from the
east wind's power, but a due south wind brings in the sea, and a
south-west the Atlantic.
Off this coast are seen at times those strange floating or rising
islands called by the pilots the “Shingles;" which sometimes stay
above water so long, that their surface is clad with the tender green
of bladderwort and samphire; but more often they disappear after
taking the air for a few short hours. For several years now they
have taken no air; and a boatman, who knows every shift of the
coast, says that he thinks that the “Shingles” now can never top
the waves again.
Up and down the Solent channel the tide pours at a furious
speed; and the rush of the strong ebb down the narrows, flushed
with the cross-tide from St. Helen's, combs and pants out into
Christchurch Bay, above the floodmark of two hours since. This
great eddy, or reflux, is called the “double-tide;" and an awkward
power it has for any poor vessel to fall into.
All that night it blew and blew, harder and harder yet; the fisher-
men's boats on the beach were caught up, and flung against the
gravel-cliff; the stout men, if they ventured out, were snatched up
as a mother snatches a child from the wheels of a carriage; the
oaks of the wood, after wailing and howling, as they had done to a
thousand tempests, found that outcry go for nothing, and with it
went themselves.
Seven hundred towers of Nature's building showed their roots to
the morning. The old moon expired at o‘32; and many a gap the
new moon found, where its mother threw playful shadows. The
sons of Ytene are not swift-witted, nor deeply read in the calendar;
yet they are apt to mark and heed the great convulsions of nature.
The old men used to date their weddings from the terrible winter of
1787; the landmark of the young men's annals is the storm of 1859.

THE FURY OF THE STORM.

All that night young Robert Garnet was strung by some sırange
tension. Of course he could not sleep amid that fearful uproar,
although he was plunged and lost from sight in Octavius Pell's
great chair. The only luxury Pell possessed-and that somehow
by accident-was a deep, and soft, and mighty chair, big enough
for three people. After one of the windows came in, which it did,
with a crash, about ten o'clock, scattering Pell's tobacco-jars, and
after they had made it good with books and boxes and a rug, so
that the wind was filtered through it, Mr. Rosedew and his curate
sat on a couple of hard old Windsors, watching the castle of Hurst.
Thence would come the signal flash, if any hapless bark should be
seen driving over the waters.
There they sat, John Rosedew talking, as he could to a younger
man, when his great heart was moved to its depth, and the multi-
tude of his mind in march, and his soul anticipating it: talking so
that Octave Pell, following his silver tones, even through that tur-
moil, very nearly forgot the tempest, and the lapse of hours, and let
fall on his lap the pipe which Mr. Rosedew had made him smoke.
The thunder of the billows waxing, for the wind was now south-
west, began to drown the roar of the gale, and a storm of foam was
Aying, when the faint gleam of a gun at sea was answered by
artillery's flash from the walls of old Henry the Eighth. Both men
saw the landward light leap up and stream to leeward; but only the
younger one descried the weak appeal from the offing.
“Where is she, Pell? Have you any idea ?”
“She is away, sir, here to the right: dead in the eye of the
wind."
“Then may our God and Father pity our brothers and our
sisters !"
Out ran both those strong good men, leaving poor Bob (as they
thought) asleep in the depth of the easy-chair. The little cottage
was partly sheltered by an elbow of the cliff; otherwise it would
have been flying up the bunny long ago. The moment the men
came out of the shelter, they were driven one against the other, and
both against the cliff.
“My castle will go at high-water," said Pell, though none could
hear him; “ but I shall be back in time enough to get the old
woman out.”
Then, as far as Pell could make out in the fierce noise and the
darkness, Mr. Rosedew begged him to go back, while himself went
on alone. For this was the rector's especial business; he had pro-
cured the lifeboat, chosen the crew, and kept the accounts; and he
thought himself responsible for any wreck that happened. But
what good on earth could Pell do, and all his chattels in danger?
1 The chink or narrow rift in the cliff-line, called in the Isle of Wight a
“chine,” is known in the New Forest as a “bunny.”

“No good, very likely," Pell shouted, “and a good deal perhaps
in-doors! Keep the sea out with a besom, sir.”
Octave had a dry way with him, not only when he sang, but when
lie thought he saw the right, and did not mean to argue it. So
rector and curate, old man and young man, trudged along to-
gether, each bending low, and throwing his weight, like a quoit,
against the wind; each stopping and crouching at every tenth yard,
as the blast irresistible broke on them. Crusted with hunks of froth
and foam-drift, drenched by pelting sheets of spray, deafened by the
thundering surf, and often obliged to fly with the wind from a wave
that rushed and hissed at them, they battled for that scoop of the
bay where the ship must be flung by the indraught.
At the place whence they set out, Christchurch Point, and St.
Alban's Head, broke (as the wind was westering) some little of the
wildest sea-brunt. But now they stood, or rather crouched, over
against the wild white moil, the bourne and doom of all the driven
madness of an ocean.
Here the mountain surges swept, superbly rolling ; swallowing
up the petty wrath of windy waves, scarcely deigning to lift their
crests to even such a hurricane. After a hundred leagues of rolling,
with the weight of heaven behind them, and the trumpery world in
front, and their bulk as firmly built and massive as a mountain-in
their arrogance, where on earth should they ever find a barrier ?
Each in stately grandeur left the tumbling valley of white waters to
subside behind it, and with plume of snowy spray towered up and
onward. Then, above the shattered ebb, and hoarse convulsive
rattle of the pebbles from a dead wave, the hesitating monster hung,
and Aung its arching chine on high-hung with awful volume curl-
ing like the scroll of God on high; then thundered down in one
vast roar through sea and land resounding.
And now, scarce half a mile from shore, as the breaking daylight
showed it, heaved and pitched, and wallowed hog-like in the trough
of waters, a large ship, swept and naked. Swept of her masts, oí
her canvas naked; but clad, alas ! with men and women, clustering,
clinging, cowering from the great white grave beneath them. As
she laboured, reeled, and staggered up to the storin-rent heavens,
and then plunged down the yawning chasm, every attitude, every
gesture of terror, love, despair, and madness, could be descried on
the object-glass of the over-faithful telescope. As a wan gleam from
the east lit up all that quivering horror, all that plight of anguish, John
Rosedew turned away in tears, and fell upon his knees, and prayed.
But Pell caught up the clear Munich glass, blocked every now
and then with foam ; he wiped it with his cuff, ar levelled it on a
stony ledge. There he lay behind the pebbles, himself not out oi
danger, unable to move, or look away, spell-bound by the awe of
death in numbered moments coming. Round him many a sturdy
boatman, gazing, listening, rubbing his eyes, wondering about thi

wives and children of the brave men there. The great disaster
imminent was known all over the village, and all who dared to cross
the gale had crept, under shelter, hitherwards. None was fool
enough to talk of boat, or tug, or lifeboat ; a child who had then
first seen the sea must have known better than that. The best ship
in the British navy could not have come out of the Needles in the
teeth of such a hurricane.
Some of the tars had brought their old Dollonds, preventive
glasses long cashiered, and smugglers' night-rakers cheek by jowl,
and every sort of "perspective,” fifty years old and upward, with
the lenses cracked and rattling, and fungoid tufts in the object-
glass. Nevertheless each man would swear that his own glass was
the best of the lot, and his neighbour's "not of much count.” To
their minds, telescopes like spectacles suit the proprietor only.
“ By Jove, I believe she'll do it !” cried Pell, the chief interpreter,
his glass being the only clear one.
“Do what, sir? what?" asked a dozen voices hurriedly.
Get her head round to windward, and swing into smoother
water. They're in the undertow already. Oh, if they only knew it !"
They knew it, he saw, in a moment. They ran up a'spare sail,
ere he could speak, to the stump of the mizen-mast, and a score of
brave men strained on the sheets until they had braced them home.
They knew that it could not stand long ; it would fly away to lee-
ward most likely when once they mounted the wave-crest ; but two
or three minutes might save them. With eight hands jamming the
helm
up,
and the tough canvas tugging and bellying, the ship, with
the aid of the undertow, plunged heavily to windward. All knew
that the ship herseli was doomed, that she never could fetch off
shore; but, if she could only hold her course for some half-mile to
the westward, she would turn the flank of those fearful rollers, and
a good stout boat might live. For there a south-western headland
broke the long fury of the sea.
Every eye was intent, every bosom drew a deep breath, as the
next great_billow rose under the ship, and tossed her up to the
tempest. They had brought her as near to the wind as they dared,
so as still to have steerage way on her, and she took the whole
force of the surge on her port bow, not on her beam, as the folk
ashore had feared. The sea broke bodily over her, and she stag-
gered back from the blow, and shook through every timber, then
leaped and lurched down the terrible valley, but still with the good
sail holding. She was under noble seamanship, that was clear to
every one, and herself a noble fabric. If she could ride but two
billows more, without falling off from the wind (within three points
of which her head lay), some of the crew at least might be rescued.
Already a stout galley, manned with ten oars, was coming out of
Christchurch Harbour, dancing like a cork on the waves, though
sheltered by the headland.

ocean.
up it.
(
The poor ship rode the next billow bravely; it was a wave that
had some moderation, and the lungs of the gale for the moment were
panting, just as she topped the comb of it. “ Hurrah !" shouted the
men ashore ; “By God, she'll do it yet!"
By God alone could she do it. But the Father saw not fit. The
third billow was the largest of all that had yet rolled up from the
Beam-end on she clomb the mountain, heeling over heavily,
showing to the shore her deck-seams,-even the companion-finial,
and the poor things clinging there ; a wail broke from them as the
great sea struck her, and swept away half a score of them.
Now's your chance, men. D-n your eyes! She won't hang
there two minutes, Out with the boats you lubbers. Look
sharp, and be d-d to you.”
The ancient pilot, Thwarthawse, dancing and stamping, his blue
jacket flapping in the wind, and his face of the deepest plum colour,
roared to windward his whirlwind of oaths up an old split trumpet,
down which the wind came bellowing harder than his voice went
“Stow that, Jacob!” cried an ancient Scotchman,survivor of many
a wreck; can ye nae see his reverence, mon? It's an unco thing
for an auld mon like you to swear at your mates in their shrouds,
chap. I ken the skipper of that there ship, and he's no lubber, no
more than I be.”
Sandy Macbride was known to fear God, and to have fifty pounds
in the savings' bank. Therefore no one flouted him.
“You're right, Mac; you're right, by George!” cried Pell.
“What a glorious fellow ! I can see him there holding on by the
stanchion, giving his orders as coolly as if for the cabin dinner. I
could die with that man."
The tear in Octavius Pell's right eye compelled him to shift the
glass a bit. He was just the man who would have done even as that
captain did.
“Hurrah, hurrah! they've got the launch out ; only she and the
gig are left. Troops on the deck, drawn up in a line, and the
women hoisted in first, of course. Give them three cheers, men,
although they cannot hear you! Three cheers, if you are English-
men! Glorious, glorious ! There they go ; never saw such a fine
thing in all my life. Oh, I wish I had been a sailor !"
The tears ran down the young parson's cheeks, and were blown
into the eyes of old Macbride ; or else he had some of his own.
“ Shove off, shove off ; now's your time, for the under-current is
failing her. Both of them off, as I'm alive; and yet a third boat I
could not see. What magnificent management! That man ought
to command a fleet. Two of them off for Christchurch Harbour ;
away, away, while the wind lulls; but what is the third boat doing?”
Every one was looking: no one answered. Old Mac knew what
it was, though his eyes were too old to see much.

“ Captain Roberts, I'll go bail, at his old tricks again. And
there's none with the sense to mutiny on him, and lash his legs, as
we did in the Samphire.”
“ As the ship rolls, there is some dispute. The boat is laden
to the water's edge, and the ship paying off to leeward, for there is
no man at the wheel ; there goes the sail from the bolt-ropes. If
they don't push off, ere an oar's length, they will all be sucked into
the rollers! Kind Lord of our lives, how fearful! There is but
room for one life more; and not one of the three will take it. Two
white-haired men and a girl. Life against honour with the old
men; and what is life compared with it! Both resolved not to stir
a peg; now they join to make the girl go. Her father has got her
in his arms to pitch her into the boat ; she clings around his neck
so that both must go, or neither. He could not throw her; she
falls on her knees, and clings to his legs to die with him. Smack-
there, the rope is parted, and it is too late for further argument.
The troops in the boat salute the officer, and he returns it as on
parade.”
“ Name of that ship?” said Jacob curtly, to old Sandy Macbride.
Aliwal, East India trader, Captain Roberts. Calcutta to
Southampton."
“Then it's all up now with the Aliwal, and every soul on board
of her."
“ Don't want a pilot to tell us that,” answered old Mac testily.
“You've seed a many good craft, pilot, but never one as could last
five minutes on the Shingle Bank, with this sea running."
Ropes, ropes !” cried Octave Pell; “in five minutes she'll be
ashore here."
No, she 'ont, nor yet in ten,” answered his landlord gruffly ;
“she'll fetch away to the eastward first, now she is in the tide
again, specially with this gale on ; and she'll take the ground over
yonner, and go to pieces with the next breaker."
She took her course exactly as old Jacob mapped it out for her.
He knew every run and flaw of the tide, and how it gets piled in the
narrows by a very heavy storm, and runs back in the eddy which
had saved so many lives there. This has nothing to do with the
“double tide ;" that comes after high-water.
As the good ship traced the track of death, doing as the waves
willed (like a little boy's boat in the Serpentine), the people on
shore could see those three, who had contested the right of prece-
dence to another world.
They were all upon the quarter-deck; and three finer figures
never yet came to take the air there, in the weariness of an Indian
voyage. Captain Roberts, a tall, stout man, with ruddy cheeks and
a broad white beard, stood with his hands in his pockets, and his
feet asunder, and a sense of discipline in his face, as of a man who
has done his duty, and has no fear of his Maker. No sign of

finching or dismay in his weather-beaten eyes, as he watched his
death roll towards him ; though the gazers said that he brushed a
tear off; perhaps at the thought of his family just coming down-
stairs at Lymington.
The land-officer beside him faced his death quite differently ;
perhaps with even less of fear, but with more defiance, broken, every
now and then, by anguish for his daughter. He had not learned to
fear the Lord, as those men do who go down into the great deep.
He looked as if he felt some anger at the turbulence of the sea.
The ship, running now before wind and wave, laid her course as
truly as a row-boat in a river; she did not lurch any more, or
labour, but rose and fell, just showing her fore-foot or stern-post, as
the billows passed under her. And so that young maiden could
stand and gaze, with her father's arm thrown round her.
She was worthy to be his daughter; tall, and light of form, and
calm, with eyes of wondrous brightness, she was looking at her
father's face to say the last good-bye. Then she flung both arms
around his neck, and fondly, sadly, kissed him. Meanwhile the
ship-captain turned away, and thought of Susan Roberts. Suddenly
he espied a life-belt washed into the scuppers. He ran for it in a
moment, came behind the maid, and, without asking her consent,
threw it over her, and fastened it. There was little chance of it
helping her, but that little chance she should have.
"She'll take the ground next biller," cried the oracular Jacob;
“ stand by there with the ropes, boys."
On the back of a huge wave rose for the last time that unfortunate
Aliwal. Stem on, as if with strong men steering, she rushed
through the foam and the white whirl, like a hearse run away with
in snowdrifts. Then she crashed on the stones, and the raging sea
swept her from taffrail to bowsprit, rolled her over, pitched her
across, and broke her back in two moments. The shock rang
through the roar of billows, as if a nerve of the earth were thrilling.
Another mountain-wave came marching to the roll of the tempest-
drum. It curled disdainfully over the side, like a fog sweeping over
a hedge-row; swoop-it cast the wreck on high, as a giant tosses a
fir-cone.
"I can't look any longer,” cried Pell; “give me something to
feel, men. Quick, there! I see something !”
He seized the bight of a rope, and rushed any how into the
waters. But John Rosedew and the life-boatmen held hard upon
the coil of it, and drew him with all their might back again. They
hauled Octavius Pell up as a line-fisher hauls a cod-fish, and he
was so bruised and stupefied, that he could not tell what he had
gone for. They only saw floating timber and gear, and wreck of
every sort drifting, till just for one sight-flash a hoary head, whiter
than driven waters, leaped out of the comb of the billow. A naval
man, or a military—who knows, and how could it matter ?

THE FURY OF THE STORM.
189
Brave men ashore, all waiting ready, dashed down the steep of
death to save him, if the great wave should toss up its plaything.
All Rushford strained at the cables that held them from the savage
recoil. Worse than useless; the only chance of it was to make
more widows. The sea leaped at those gallant strong men; there
were five on either cable ; it leaped at them as the fiery furnace
leaped on the plain of Dura. It struck the two ropes into one with
a buffet, as a lion's paw shatters a cobweb; it dashed the men's
heads together, and Aung them all in a pile on a ballast-heap.
Lucky for them that it fought with itself, and clashed there, and
made no recoil. The white-haired corpse was seen no more ; and
all Rushford shrunk back in terror.
The storm was now at its height; and of more than a hundred
people gathered on the crown of the shore, and above the reach of
the billows, not one durst stand upright. Nearer the water the
wind had less power, for the rampart of waves broke the brunt of it.
But there no man, unless he were most quick of eye and foot, might
stand without great peril. For scarcely a single billow broke, but
what, in the first rebound and toss, two churning hummocks of serf
met, and flashed up the strand like a mad white horse, in front of
all expectation. Then a hissing ensued, and a roll of shingle, and
the water poured huddling and lappeting back from the chine itself
had crannied.
As brave men fled from a rush of this sort, and cowards on the
bank were laughing at them, something white was seen in the curl
of the wave which was breaking behind it. The ebb of that inrush
met the wave and partly took the crash of it, then the white thing
was shot on the shore like a pellet, and lay one instant motionless.
There was no rope there, and the men hung back; John Rosedew
cried “Shame !" and ran for it; but they joined hands across and
stopped him. Before they could look round again, some one had
raised the body. 'Twas young Bob Garnet, and in his arms lay a
young maiden senseless. She had looked at him once, and then
swooned
away from the whirl, and the blows, and the terror. No
rope round his body, no cork, no pad ; he had rushed full into the
raging waves, as he woke from his sleep of heaviness. He lifted
the girl, and a bending giant hung thirty feet above them.
Then a shriek, like a woman's, rang out on the wind, and two
great arms were tossed to heaven. Bull Garnet stood there, and
strove to rush on, strove with every muscle, but every nerve strove
against it. He was balanced and hung on the wind for a moment,
as the wave hung over his heart's love.
Crash came the wave-what shriek should stop it, after three
hundred miles of rolling ?-a crash that rang in the souls of all
whom youth could move or nobleness. Nothing was seen in the
depth of water, the swirling, hurling whiteness, until the billow had

swept many a fathom in-shore, but griping still that senseless
thing, that should either live or die with him-Bob, who could
swim as well or better than he could climb a tree, but felt that he
and his load were only dolls for the wave to dandle-down he
went, after showing his heels, and fought the deadly outrush.
None but Nature's pet would have thought of, none but the
favoured of God could have done, it. He felt the back-wave
tugging at him, he felt that he was going ; if another billow broke
on him, it was all up with his work upon wire-worm. Holding his
breath, he flung his right leg over the waist of the maiden, dug his
two hands deep into the gravel, and clapped his feet together.
Scarcely knowing what was up, he held on like griin death for life,
and felt a barrowload of pebbles rolling down the small of his back.
Presently he saw light again, and sputtered out salt water, and
heard a hundred people screaming out “Hurrah !” and felt a
strong arm thrown round him-not his father's, but John Rose-
dew's. Three senseless bodies were borne to the village-Bull
Garnet's, and Bob's and the maiden's.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
EÖA.
MEANWHILE that keen engineering firm, wind, wave, tide, and Co.,
had established another little business on the coast hard by. This
was the general wreck and crack-up of the stout Pell-castle, a
proceeding unnoticed by any one except good mother Jacob, whose
attention was drawn to it forcibly, as the head of the bed fell in
upon her. Thereupon the stout dame made a rush for it, taking
only her cat and spectacles, and the little teapot of money. As she
started at a furious pace, and presented to the elements a large
superficial area, the wind could not resist the temptation, but waſted
her to the top of the bunny, without her feet so much as once a.
touching the blessed earth-she goes mad if any one doubts it-
and planted her in a white-thorn tree, and brought an elam” of
thatch to shelter her from her own beloved roof. There, when the
wind subsided, she was happily discovered by some enterprising
children ; the cat was sitting at her side; in one blue hand she
held her specs, and in the other a teapot.
Poor Pell's easy-chair was thrown up, three miles to the west-
ward, in the course of the next spring-tides, and, being well known
all over the neighbourhood (from his lending it to sick people), was
brought to him, with a round of cheers, by half a dozen fishermen.
They refused the half-crown he offered them, and displayed the

greatest anxiety lest his honour should believe it was them as had
taken the shine off. The workmanship not being modern, the
chair was little the worse for its voyage; only it took six months to
dry, and had a fine smell of brine ever afterwards. Then, having
been lent to an old salt's widow, it won such a reputation, all across
the New Forest, as a specific for “rheumatics in the small of the
back," that old women, long quit of all small to their backs, walked
the whole way from Lyndhurst, “just to sot themselves down in it,
and how much was to pay, please, for a quarter of an hour ?" “A
shilling," said Octave Pell, “a shilling for the new life-boat that
lives under Christchurch Head.” Then they pulled out mighty
silver watches, and paid the shilling at the fifteen minutes. The
walk, and the thought of the miracle, and the fear of making fools
of themselves, did such a deal of good, that a man got up a 'bus for
it; but Pell said, “No; none who come by 'bus shall sit in my
chair of ease.”
The greedy sea returned brave Pell no other part of his property.
His red tobacco-jar, indeed, was found by some of the dredgemen
three or four years afterwards, but they did not know it was his,
and sold it-crusted as it was with testacea, and ribboned with
sea-weed-to the zealous secretary of—no matter what museum.
“Roman, or perhaps Samian, or possibly Phænician ware,” cried
the secretary, lit with fine-though, it may be, loose-ideas; and
he catalogued it : “ Phoenician in the opinion of an F.A.S. There
is every reason to believe it a vase for Thuricremation.” “Hollo!”
cried Pell, when he went there to lecture upon cricket as played by
Ulysses, “why, I'm blessed if you haven't got
" The most
undoubted Phænician relic contained in any museum !” So he
laughed with other people's cheeks, like a man of sense.
All the folk of Rushford, and many too of Nowelhurst, contri-
buted to a secret fund for refurnishing Octavius Pell. So great
were the mystery and speed, and so clever the management of the
dissenting parson, that two great vans were down upon Pell before
he had heard a word of it. He stood at the door of the cobbler's
shop, and tried to make a speech; but the hurrahs were too many
for him, and he turned away and cried. Tell us that any parson in
England can be the poison of his parish, if he has but a heart
of his own, and is not ashamed of having it!
At the "Crown," where the three sick people were now, a very fine
trade was doing ; but a finer one still upon the beach, as the sea
went down and the choice contents of the Aliwal came up. For
that terrible storm began to abate about noon on the 26th. It had
blown as hard for twenty-four hours as it ever does blow in any
land, except in the gaps of the Andes and during cyclones of the
tropics.
Now the core of the storm had no more cells in it; and the puffs
that came from the west and north-west, and so on till it got to the

pole-star, were violent indeed, but desultory, and seemed not to
know where they were going. Finally, at its second midnight, the
wind owned that its turn was over, and sunk (well satisfied with its
work) into the arms of slumber—"placitâque ibi demum morte
quievit.”
And its work had been done right well. No English storm since
the vast typhoon of 1703 had wrought such glorious havock upon
that swearing beaver, man. It had routed his villages at the
Land's End, and lifted like footstools his breakwater blocks; it had
scared of their lives his Eddystone watchmen, and put out half his
lighthouses; it had broken upon his royalty, and swept down the
oaks of the New Forest; it had streaked with wrecks the Goodwin
Sands, and washed ships out of harbours of refuge; it had leaped
upon London as on a drain-trap, and jarred it as a man whistles
upon his fingers; it had huddled pell-mell all the coal-trade ;
saddest vaunt (though not the last), it had strewn with gashed and
mangled bodies (like its own waves, countless) the coast of
Anglesea and Caernarvon.
On the morning now of the 27th, with the long sullen swell gold-
beater-skinned by the recovering sun, the shingle-bank was full
of interest to an active trader. They had picked up several bodies
with a good bit of money upon them, and the beach was strewn with
oranges none the worse for a little tossing. For the stout East
Indiaman Aliwal had touched at the Western Islands, and taken
on board a thousand boxes of the early orange harvest. And not
only oranges were rolling among the wrack, the starfish, the shark's
teeth, and the cuttle-eggs, but also many a pretty thing, once prized
and petted by women. There were little boxes with gilt and paint,
sucked heartily by the salt water, and porcupine-quills rasping up
from panels of polished ebony, cracked mirrors inside them, and
mother-of-pearl, and manifold carving of scented wood ; all the taste
and the labour of man yawning like dead cockles, crimped back-
ward, sodden and shredded, as hopeless a wreck as a drunkard.
Then there were barrels, and heavy chests, planking already like
hemp in the prison-yard, bulkheads, and bulwarks, and cordage,
and reeve-blocks, and ten thousand other things, well appreciated
by the wreckers, who were hauling them up the bunnies; while the
Admiralty droitsmen made an accurate inventory of the bungs and
the blacking bottles. Some of the sailors, and most of the passen-
gers, who had escaped in the boats to Christchurch, came over to
look for any thing that might turn up of their property. Hereupon
several fights ensued; and many poor fellows obtained occasion
for a closer inspection of the Rushford stratum than the most geo-
logical members on any society could desire ; until the police came
down in force, and quenched all other rights of salvage in strict
justice to their own.
Nevertheless there was yet one field upon which the police could

not interfere ; although Jack wished for nothing better than to catch
the lubbers there. This was Jack's own domain, the sea, where was
now beginning a lively search for the body of Colonel Nowell. His
servant had hurried from Christchurch to Nowelhurst to report the
almost certain death of Sir Cradock's only brother. He did not go
first to ascertain it : for the road along the cliffs was impassable
during the height of the storm.
Sir Cradock received the announcement with very few signs of
emotion. He had loved that Clayton in early youth, but now had
almost forgotten him ; and Clayton had never kept his brother at
all apprised of his doings. Sir Cradock had gone into mourning for
him, some three years ago; and Colonel Nowell never took the
trouble to vindicate his vitality until Dr. Hutton's return. And,
even though they had really known and loved one another as
brothers, the loss would have been but a tap on the back to a man
already stabbed through the heart. Therefore Sir Cradock's sorrow
exploded (as we love to make our griefs do, and as we so often
express them) in the moneyed form : “ I will give 500l. to the man
who finds my poor brother's body.”
That little speech launched fourteen boats. What wrecker could
hope for any thing of a tenth part of the value? Men who had
sworn that they never would pull in the same boat again together-
might the Great Being, the Giver of life, strike them dead if they
did !—forgot the solemn perjuration, and cried,
flipper, Ben; after all, there are worse fellows going than you, my
lad :” and Ben responded, “ Jump into the starn-sheets ; you are
just the hand as we want, Harry. Many's the time I've thought on
you.” Even the dredging-smacks hauled in-shore from their proper
business, and began to dredge for the Colonel ; till the small boats,
unable to stand such trespass, resolved on united action, tossed oars,
and held solemn council. Several speeches were made, none of
them very long, but all embodying that fine sentiment, “fiat
justitia, ruat cælum,” in the form of "fair play, and be d-d to you."
Then Sandy Mac, of the practical mind, made a suggestion which
was received with three wild rounds of cheers.
“Give 'em a little ballast, boys, as they be come in-shore to
dredge for it.”
With one consent the fourteen boats made for the shore, like the
fleet of canoes described by the great Defoe. Nor long before each
shallop's nose “grated on the golden sands.” The men in the
dredging-smacks looked at the sky to see if a squall was coming.
And soon they got it, thick as hail, and as hot as pepper. The four-
teen boats in battle array advanced upon them slowly, only two men
rowing in each, all the rest standing up, and every man charged
heavily. When they were at a nice wicket distance, old Mac gave
the signal, and a flight of stones began, which, in the words of the
ancient chroniclers,“ well-nigh darkened the noonday sun.” The

bravest dredger durst not show his head above the gunwale ; for the
Rushford stones are close of grain, and it is sweeter to start than to
stop them. As for south-westers and dreadnoughts, they were no
more use than vine-leaves in a storm of electric hail.
“Ah, little then those mellow grapes their vine-leaf shall avail,
So thickly rattles on the tiles the pelting of the hail.”
GEORG, i. 448.
The dredgers gave in, and hoisted a shirt as a signal for a parley.
The Rushford men refused to hear a syllable about snacks."
What they demanded was “unconditional surrender ;" and the
dredgers, having no cement-stones on board, were compelled to
accept it. So they took up their bags, and walked the smacks off
three miles away to their station, with very faint hopes indeed that
the obliging body might follow them. The boatmen celebrated
their victory with three loud cheers for Sandy Mac, and a glass of
grog all round. Then they returned to the likeliest spot, and
dragged hard all the afternoon.
“ Tarnation 'cute body," cried Ben, “as ever I come across.
Who'd a thought as any perfessing Christian would have stuck to
Davy Jones's locker, and refooged the parson and clerk so? Spit
on your grapples, my lads of wax, and better luck the cast
after.”
The Lord kens the best,” replied Sandy Mac, with a long-drawn
sigh, us poor vessels canna do more than is the will of the Lord,
boys. Howsomever, I brought a bit of bait, a few lug-worms, and
a soft crab or two; and please the Lord I'll rig my line out, and see
if the bass be moving. And likely there may be a tumbling cod on
the run speering after the puir bodies. Ah, yes, the will of the
Lord ; we ates them, and they ates us."
The canny old Scotchman, without foregoing his share in the
general venture—for he helped to throw the grapnels, or took a spell
at the rudder-rigged out a hook on his own account, and fastened
the line to the rowlocks.
“ Fair play, my son,” cried Ben, winking at his comrades ; "us
go snacks in what you catch, mind. And the will of the Lord be
done.”
'Dinna ye
wish ye may get it ?”—the old man glowered at him
indignantly—“I'll na fish at all on that onderstanding."
“ Fish away, old boy, and be blessed, then. I see he ain't been
in the perwentive sarvice for nothing. But I'm blowed if he'll get
much supper, Harry, if it's all to come off that darned old hook.”
They all laughed at old Mac, who said nothing, but regarded his
line attentively.
With many a joke and many an oath, they toiled away till the
evening fog came down upon the waters. Then, as they turned to

go home, old Mac felt a run upon his fishing-gear. Hánd over
hand he began to haul in, coiling the line in the stern-sheets.
“It's a wapping big fish, as ever I feel, mates; na, na, ye'll no
touch it, or ye'll be claiming to come and sup wi' me. And deil a
bit-the Lord forgive me-will ye ha', for grinning at an auld mon
the likes of that, I tell ye. Lord ha’ mercy on me, a wake and
sinful crater !”
They all fell back, except Macbride, as before them in the twi-
light rose the ashy grey face and the long white hair of Colonel
Clayton Novell.
Mac stuck to his haul like a Scotchman ; to him the main chance
was no ghost. Many a time has he told that story, and turned his
quid upon it, cleverly raining between his teeth with fine art to
prolong the crisis.
The line being his, and the hook being his, and the haul of his
hands only, Sandy Mac could never see why he should not have all

compounded at last for 300l., and let the other four share the
residue.
So poor Colonel Nowell's countenance, still looking grand and
dignified, was saved from the congers and lobsters ; and he sleeps
close by his nephew and namesake in Nowelhurst churchyard. The
body of Captain Roberts was found a long way up the Solent. He
had always carried a weather helm, and shaped a good course for
harbour. May they rest in peace !
We may trust that Captain Roberts so rests, and hope we may,
in the mercy of God, the same of the brave old Colonel. At least,
which of us shall condemn him to that eternal punishment, whose
existence our divines contend for in a manner so purely dis-
interested ? He had been a harumscarum man; and now that he
is drowned and buried, we may enter upon his history with the
charity due to both quick and dead, but paid to the latter only.
A soldier is, in many things, by virtue of his calling, a generous,
careless man. We have always credited the sailor with these
popular qualities; hornpipes, national drama, and naval novels im-
buing us. Yet is the sailor, upon the whole, a more careless man
than the soldier ? Jack is obliged, by force of circumstance, to
bottle up his money, his rolliсksomeness and sentimentality, and
therefore has more to get rid of when he comes ashore once in
a twelvemonth. But spread the outburst over the year, strike the
average of it, and the rainfall at Aldershot will equal that at Ports-
mouth.
And so to watch the Army List—which at length he grew tired
of doing-was the only way left to the English brother to know in
what land might the Indian be. Even the most careful of us begin
to feel that care is too much for the nine lives of a cat, when

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Fahrenheit scores 1100 in the very coolest corner, and the punkah
is too hot to move. So, after one or two Griffin letters, full of
marvels which the writer pretended not to marvel at, a silence, as
of the jungle, ensued, and Sir Cradock thought of tigers. Then the
slides of his own life began to move upon him; and less and less
every year he thought of the boy who had laughed and cried with
him.
Lieutenant Nowell was ordered suddenly to the borders of the
Punjaub, and for twenty years his brother Cradock drank his health
at Christmas, and wondered how about the Article against praying
for the dead. The next thing he heard, though it proved his own
orthodoxy, disproved it by making him swear hard. Clayton
Nowell had married; married an Affghan woman, to the great
disgust of his brother officers, and the furious disdain of her kins-
men. A very fine family of Affghan chiefs immediately loaded
their fusils, and swore to shoot both that English dog and their own
Bright Eyes of the Morning.
“To think,” cried Sir Cradock Nowell, “ that a brother of mine
should disgrace himself, and (what matters far more) his family, by
marrying a wretched low Affghan woman !"
“To think,” cried Mohammed Khans, “that a sister of ours
should disgrace herself, and (what matters far more) her family, by
marrying a cursed low English dog !"
Which party was in the right, judge ye who understand the
matter. The officers' wives got over their prejudice against Bright
Eyes of the Morning, and matronized, and petted, and tried to
make a Christian of her. Captain Nowell adored her ; she was so
elegant in every motion, so loving, and so simple. She quite
reformed him for the time from his too benevolent anthropology,
from the love of dice, and the vinous doings which the Prophet
does not encourage.
But the poor thing died in her first confinement, while following
her husband's regiment at the foot of the Himalayah, leaving her
new-born babe to the care of a faithful Affghan nurse, who had kept
at her dear lady's side, even among the infidels. This good nurse,
being great of soul, and therefore strong of faith, could not bear that
the child of her mistress, the highest blood of the Affghans, should
become a low Frank idolater. So she set off with it, in the dark
night, crouching past the sentinels, thieves, and other camp fol-
lowers, and trusted herself to the boundless jungle, with only the
stars to guide her. She put the wailing child to her breast, for her
own dear babe was dead, and hushed it from the vigilant ears of the
man-eating tiger. Then off again for Affghanistan, six hundred
miles in the distance.
How this wonderful woman, soothing and coaxing the little
stranger (obtrusively remarkable for the power of her squalls), how
she got on through the thorns, the fire, the famine, the jaws of the

tiger, and, worse than all, the pestilent fever, bred from the rich
stagnation of that alluvial soil, is more than any man unversed in
woman's tenacity may tell. Enough that with her eyes upon the
grand religious heights—heathen high places we should call them
-she struggled along through nearly three-quarters of her pilgrim-
age, and then she fell among robbers. A villanous hill-tribe, of
mixed origin, always shifting, er working, never even fighting
when they could run away, hated and despised by the nobler moun-
tain races, the pariahs of the Himalayah, ignorant of any good,
debased as any Africans-in a single word, Rakshas, or worshippers
of the devil. A nice school of education for a young lady of tender
years-or rather months—to commence in.
The nurse was allotted to one of their chiefs, and the babe was
about to be knocked on the head, when it struck an enlightened
priest that in two years' time she would make a savoury oblation to
the devil ; so the Affghan woman was allowed to keep her, until
she began to crawl about among the dogs and babes of the station.
Here she so distinguished herself by precocious skill in thieving,
that her delighted owner conferred upon her the title of “ Never-
spot-the-dust," and even instructed her how to steal the high priest's
knife of sacrifice. That last exploit saved her life. Such a genius
had never appeared in any tribe of the Rakshas until this great
manifestation.
So“Never-spot-the-dust” was well treated, and made much of
by her owner, to whom she was quite a fortune; and soon all the
band looked up to her as the future priestess of the devil. For ten
years she wandered about with them, becoming every year more
important, proud that none could approach her skill in stealing,
lying, and dancing, utterly void of all religion, except the few
snatches of Moslemism which her nurse had contrived to impart,
and the vague terror of the evil spirit to whom the wild men paid
their vows.
But when she was ten years old, a tall and wonder-
fully active child, and just about to be consecrated by the blood of
inferior children, a British force drew suddenly all around the nest
of robbers. Of late the scoundrels had done things that made John
Bull's hair stand on end; and, when his hair is in that condition,
sparks are apt to come out of it.
Seeing no chance of escape, and having very faint hopes of
quarter, the robbers fought with a bravery which quite astonished
themselves; but the evil spirit was against them—a rare incon-
sistence on his part. Their rascally camp was burnt, which they
who had burned some hundreds of villages looked upon as the
grossest cruelty, and more than half of their number were sent
home to their patron and guardian. Then the Affghan nurse, so
faithful and so unfortunate, fled from the burning camp with her
charge, fell before the British colonel, and poured forth all her
troubles. The Englishman knew Major Nowell, and had heard some

parts of his history; so he took “Never-spot-the-dust" to her
father, who was amazed at once and amused with her.
She could run up the punkah, and stand on the top, and twirl
around on one foot; she could cross the compound in three
bounds; she could jump upon her father's shoulder, and stay there
with the spring of her sole ; she could glide along over the floor
like a serpent, and hold on with one hand to any thing. And then
her most wonderful lightness of touch ; she had fully earned her
name, she could brush the dust without marking it. She could
come behind her father's back, crawling over the table, and fasten
his sword-hilt to his whiskers, without his knowing a thing of it.
She could pick all his pockets, of course; but that was too rude an
operation for her to take any delight in it. What she delighted to
do, and what even she found difficult, was to take off his shoes and
stockings without his being aware of it. It was a beautiful thing to
see her : consummate skill is beautiful, in whatever way exhibited.
The shoe she could get off easily enough, but the difficulty was
with the stocking; and there the chief difficulty was through the
sensitiveness of the skin, unaccustomed to exposure. Though she
had never heard of temperature, evaporation, or any thing long, her
genius told her the very first time where the tug was and how to
meet it. Keeping her little cornelian lips lips which you could
see through-just at the proper distance, she would breathe so
softly upon the skin that the breath could not be felt, as inch by
inch she lowered down the thin elastic covering. Then she would
jump up out of the ground, and shout into his ears, with a voice of
argute silver,-
"Faddery, will 'oo have 'oor shoe? Fear to go wiyout him ?”
She began to talk English, after a bit; and the weatherbeaten
Colonel--for now he had got that far-who had never looked upon
any child, except as one rupee per month-thinking of his beloved
Bright Eyes of the Morning, who might, with the will of God, have
made a first-rate man of him, only she was too good for him,-
thinking of her, and seeing the gleam of her glorious eyes in her
child, he loved that child beyond all reason, and christened her
Eöa."
He never took to bad things again. He had something now in
pledge with God; a part of himself that still would live, and love
him when he was skeleton. And this, his better part, should learn
how lying and stealing do not lead to the right half of the other
world.
His ideas about that other world were as dormant as Eöa's ; but
now he began to think about it, because he wanted to see her there.
So, after a little weeping, the whole of which was not feminine, Eöa
Nowell was sent to the best school in Calcutta, where she taught
the other young ladies some very odd things indeed.
Wherever she went, she must be foremost ; " second to none”

was her motto. Therefore she learned with amazing quickness;
but it was not so easy to unlearn.
Then arose that awful mutiny, and the Colonel at Mhow was shot
through the neck, and let lie, by his own soldiers. His daughter
heard of it, and screamed, and no walls ever built would hold her.
All the way from Calcutta, up the dreary Ganges, she forced her
passage, sometimes by boat, sometimes on her weariless feet.
She had never cared much for civilization, and loved every blade
of the jungle. The old life revived within her, as she looked upon
the broad waters, and the boundless yellow tangle, wherein glided
no swifter thing, nothing so elegant as herself.
She found her darling father in some rude cantonment, prostrate,
helpless, clinging faintly to the verge of death. Dead long ago he
must have been but for Rufus Hutton; and dead even now he
would have been but for his daughter's presence. His dreamy eyes
went round the hut to follow her graceful movements; she alone
could tend the wounds as if with the fall of gossamer, she alone
could soothe and fan the intolerable aching. They looked into
each other's eyes, and cried without thinking about it.
Then, as he gradually got better. and the surge of trouble passed
them, Eöa showed for his amusement all her strange accomplish-
ments. She had not forgotten one of them in the grand school at
Calcutta. They had even grown with her growth, and strengthened
with her strength.
She would leap over Rufus Hutton's head like a flash of light, and
stand facing him, without a muscle moving, and on his back would
be a land-crab; she would put his up-country hat on the floor, and
walk on one foot round the crown of it; she would steal his case of
instruments, and toss them in the air all open, and catch them all
By her nursing and her loving, her stealing and her mockery, she
won Dr. Hutton's heart so well that he pledged himself to be her
father, if the worthy Colonel failed to gird his old sword on again.
Then at barely three hours' notice all had to fly for their very
lives; for the ebb of the rebellion swept through that district
mightily. Eöa went to school again, and her father came to see her
daily, until he was appointed to a regiment having something more
than name and shadow.
Now Eöa, having learned every thing that they can teach in Cal-
cutta, the Himalayah, or the jungle, was coming to England to
receive the down and crown of accomplishments. Who could tell
but what they might even teach her affectation? Youth is plastic
and imitative; and she was sure to find plenty of models.
Not that the honest Colonel wished to make her a fashionable
doll. His own views were wide and grand, only too philopro-
genitive. Still, like most men of that class, who, upon sudden
reformation, love Truth so much that they roll upon her, having no
at once.

firm rules of his own, and being ashamed to profess any thing, with
the bad life fresh in memory, he took the opinion of old fogeys who
had been every bit as unblest as himself, but had sown with a drill
their wild oats. The verdict of all was one-"Miss Nowell must
go to England."
Finding his wound still troublesome, he resolved to retire from
service; he had not saved half a lac of rupees, and his pension
would not be a mighty one; but, between the two, there would be
enough for an old man to live upon decently and go wherever he
was told that his daughter ought to go.
He had seen enough of life, and found that it only meant repen-
tance; all that remained of it should be for the pleasure and love of
his daughter.
And he knew that there was a sum in England,
which must have been long accumulating--a sum left on trust for
him and his children, under a very old settlement. He would never
touch a farthing of it; every farthing should go to Eöa. Bless her
dear eyes; they had the true light of his own “Bright Eyes of the
Morning."
CHAPTER XXXIV.
INTRUDERS ARE EXTRUDED.
EÇA was now sixteen years old, tall, and slim, and graceful as the
creepers of tropic woodlands. Her face was of the clearest oval, a
quick concise terse oval, such as we find in the eggs of wild birds
rather an of tame ones. Her eyes were of bewildering bright-
ness, always flashing, always moving, rarely allowing the gazer time
to dwell upon their colour. Indeed they seemed sometimes to be of
no decided colour, but of a pure dark lustre, such as a clear swift
river has, when overhung by palm-trees. Her complexion, beauti-
fully soft and even, was toned with a delicate eastern tinge, like that
fawn-coloured light which sometimes flushes the sky at sumrner
sunrise. And her warm oriental blood suffused it, at the slightest
emotion, as the leaping sun pervades the heaven with a flood of
limpid rubies.
She had never been flattened by education: all her qualities and
feelings, like her beauty, were in excess. She showed it in the
quick rise and fall of her lovely throat and neck, in the sudden grace
of her movements, in the infinite variety of attitudes and aspects.
Whatever she thought, she said at once; yet none could take it
for “boldness." Her modes of thought were as widely different
from those of an English maiden as a wild honeysuckle differs in

form, habit, and scent, from a rose. She cared for no one's opinion
of her, any more than the wind cares how a tree swings; unless
indeed it were one whom she loved, and then she would crawl to
please him. For she loved with all her heart and soul, and hated
with no less; and she always took care in either case to apprise the
object of it. And yet, with all her depth of passion, Eöa was pure
of heart and mind, -as pure as Amy Rosedew.
She soon recovered from her bruises, being perfectly healthy, and
elastic as india-rubber. Nevertheless she would not have been
saved from that terrible sea but for the generosity of poor Captain
Roberts and the gallantry of Bob Garnet.
Now Bob was hurt rather seriously, and being (as we are well
aware) an uncommonly shy young fellow, he was greatly astonished,
and shocked a little, when on the Friday morning a beautiful girl,
very strangely dressed, ran to the side of his sofa, threw her arms
round him, and kissed him till he was out of breath, and his face
was wet with the dew of her tears.
Oh, please don't,” said Bob; “I am sure I don't deserve it.”
Yes, you do; and I will marry you when I am old enough. I
don't know what you are like, and I don't care two straws, directly
they told me what you had done. Only I must have papa's leave.
Kiss me again, if you think it is good. Now where is my darling
father?”
“What, don't you know ? Haven't they told you? Oh, poor
thing!”
At the tone of his voice she leaped back, like a diving bird at the
flash of a gun, and stood with her little hands clasped on her head,
her eyes with their deep light quivering, and the whole of her form
swinging to and fro with the gasp of sudden terror. Then she
spoke with a hollow depth, which frightened Bob more than the
kissing,
“ They told me that he was well, gone to his brother somewhere,
and I thought it wasn't like him to leave me so, and tell me the
truth, or I'll shake you to pieces.”
“No, don't,” said Bob, as she leaped at him ; "I have had
shaking enough.”
“Yes, you poor boy, and for my sake. I am a brute, I know.
Tell me the truth, if you love me.”
“ Your dear father is dead. But they have found his body."
“Do you mean to say that God has been so wicked as to kill my
father ?"
“God knows best,” said Bob; he could think of nothing else to say.
“No, He doesn't. No, He doesn't. No, He never knows any
thing. He couldn't have known who he was, and how terribly !
loved him, or He wouldn't have the heart to do it. Oh, you wicked
boy; oh, you wicked boy! I will never forgive you for saving me.
Hya, hya, hya!"

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Bob never saw such a thing before, and never will again. And
he won't be much the loser, although the sight was magnificent.
The screams and shrieks of the clearest voice that ever puzzled echo
brought up the landlord and landlady, and our good friend Rufus
Hutton, who had set forth full speed from home on hearing about
the Aliwal. He caught Eöa in his arms, carried her back to her
room, and dosed her. He gave her some Indian specific, some
powder of a narcotic fungus, brought through his old experience.
It stupefied her for nearly three days, and even then she awoke
into the dreamy state of Nirwana, that bliss of semi-consciousness,
like mild annihilation, into which the Buddha is absorbed, and to
which all pious Buddhists look as their eternal happiness. Then
she opened her delicate tapering arms, where you could see the
grand muscles moving, but never once protruding, and she called
for her darling father to come. Finding that he did not come, she
was satisfied with some trifling answer, and then wanted to have
Bob instead ; but neither was Bob forthcoming.
On the very day when Dr. Hutton came to look for Eöa, Mr.
Garnet found himself getting better from that wretched low nervous
fever into which his fright had thrown him. Then he asked Dr.
Hutton whether there would be any danger in moving Robert, and,
finding that there would be none whatever, if it were carefully
managed, he ordered a carriage immediately, and with some of his
ancient spirit. The Crown, which had the cross-bar of its N set up
the wrong way (as is done, by-the-bye, on the roof of Hampton Court
chapel, and in many other places), nade public claim to be regarded
commercial hotel and posting-house.” No Rushford folk
having yet been known to post any thing, except a letter at rare
intervals, and a bill at rarer, this claim of the Crown had never been
challenged, and strangers entertained a languid theoretical faith in
it. But Mr. Brown looked very blue when Bull Garnet in reviving
accents ordered "a chaise and pair at the door in half an hour's
time ; a roomy chaise, if you please, because my son must keep his
feet up.”
“Yes, sir ; yes, to be sure, sir ; I quite understand, sir. It shall
be attended to, sir.”
“Then why don't you go and order it ?"
“To be sure, sir ; 'I forgot. I will speak to Mrs. Brown, sir.”.
Mrs. Brown being a woman of resource, mounted the boy on her
donkey, the only quadruped she possessed, but a “wonner to go,
as the boy said, “ when you knows the right place to prog him in,"
and sent him post-haste to Lymington, whence the required con-
veyance arrived in about an hour and a half.
Rufus Hutton, having promised to be at home that evening, left
Eöa to sleep off her heavy soporific, and followed the carriage on
horseback; neither did he leave its track where the Ringwood Road
turns off, for he had undertaken to tell Sir Cradock how his niece

was getting on. He started nearly half an hour after the Lyming-
ton chaise, for Polly would never demean herself by trotting behind
the “posters.” During that half-hour he drank hot brown brandy-
and-water, although he could not bear it, to ingratiate him with Mrs.
Brown for the sake of the poor Eöa. For Mrs. Brown had no other
hot method of crowning the flowing bowl.
And now while we think of it, let us warn all gentle and simple
people who deign on this tale of the New Forest, never to ask for
pale brandy within the perambulations. How do you think they
make it ? By mixing brown brandy with villanous gin. Rufus was
up to this, of course, and, as he must take something for the good
of the house, and to get at the kindly kernel of the heavy-browed
hostess, he took that which he thought would be least for his own
evil. Then, leaving Mrs. Brown (who, of course, had taken her own
glass at his sole charge and largesse, after fifty times “Oh no, sir,
never! Oh Lord, how my Brown would be shocked !"), having
imbued that good Mrs. Brown, who really was not a bad woman-
which means that she was a good one, for women have no medium
—with a strong aromatic impression that he was a pleasant gentle-
man, and no pride, not a bit of it, in him, no more than you nor me
might,-off he trotted at a furious pace, smoking two cheroots at
Really there was and is--for he still inhales the breeze of life
down a fine cigar, and looks browner and redder than ever-in spite
of all his troubles in connexion with this story, which took a good
deal out of him, there was and is no happier man in our merry
England than the worthy Rufus Hutton. And, as all happiness is
negative, and goes without our knowing it, and only becomes a
positive past for us to look back upon, so his went before it came,
and goes or e'er it comes. And yet he enjoys it none the less; he
multiplies it by three for the past and by nine for the future, and he
never finds it necessary to deduct for the present moment.
Happy man who never thinks beyond salutary average, who can
accept, in perfect faith, the traditions of his forbears, and yet is
shrewd enough to hope that his grandsons will discard at least a
part of his acceptance,-who looks upon the passing life as a thing
he need not move in, a world which must improve itself, and every
day is doing so. And all the while he sympathizes with his fellow-
men, enjoys a bit of human nature, laughs at the cross-purposes of
native truth and training, loves whatever he finds to be true, and
does his best to foster it, is pleased with his after-dinner story, and
feels universally charitable ; then smiles at his wife, and kisses his
children ; and goes to bed with the firm conviction that they are
worth all the rest put together.
Yet this man's happiness is not sound, because it is built upon
selfishness.
In Nowelhurst village Dr. Hutton met Mark Stote, the game-

keeper, who begged him to stop for a moment, just to hear a word
or two. Rufus, after hearing his news, resolved to take the upper
road to the Hall, past Mr. Garnet's house; it was not so very far
out of his way, and perhaps he might be of service there, and—ah,
yes, Dr. Hutton, this last was the real motive, though you may not
have thought so—what a fine opportunity to discover something
which was plaguing him! Perhaps the proper thing to say is, the
want of which was plaguing him.
For Rufus took so kind an interest in his neighbours' affairs, that
any thing not thoroughly transparent in their dealings, mode of life or
speech, or management of their households, was to him the subject-
matter of continual mental scratchings. Ah, how genteel a peri-
phrase, worthy of Bailey Kettledrum ; how happily we have shown
our horror of that English monosyllable, beginning with the third
vowel, which must be (according to Dr. Aldrich) the correlative of
scratch! Score two, and go on after Dr. Hutton.
He overtook the Garnets twain just at their front gate, whence the
house could not be seen, on account of a bank of evergreens. The
maid came out with her cap flying off, and all her mind distracted.
Then Dr. Hutton, checking his mare, for the road was very narrow,
heard the entire dialogue.
“Oh, sir! oh, master! have you heard of it? Such a thing, to
be sure!"
“Heard of what, Sarah? Of course I have heard of the great
disaster at Rushford.”
“No, no. Here, sir, here! The two big trees is down on the
house. It's a mussy as Nanny and me wasn't killed. And poor
Miss Pearl have been in hysterics ever since, and not eat a mossel.
There, you can hear her screeching now, worse than the mangle,
ever so much.”
Mr. Garnet did not say a word, but set off for the house full speed,
even forgetting that Bob wanted help to get from the gate to the
doorway.
Then Dr. Hutton jumped down from his mare, and called to the
driver to come and hold her, just for a minute or two; no fear of the
post-horses bolting. Finding good excuse in Bob, vho really
wanted some support, he led him through the shrubbery. When
they came within full view of the house, they were quite amazed at
the mischief. The two oaks interlocked had fallen upon it, and,
crashing as they did from the height above, the breaches they made
were hideous. They had cloven the house into three ragged pieces,
from the roof-ridge down to the first floor, where the solid joists had
stopped them. It had happened in the afternoon of the second day
of the tempest; when the heart of the storm was broken, but tre-
mendous squalls came now and then from the bright north-west.
Mr. Garnet's own bed was occupied by the tree which he detested.
Pearl had screamed " Judgment, judgment !” and danced among

the ruins ; so the inaid was telling Mr. Garnet, as he feared to enter
his own door.
“Judgment for what ?” asked Rufus Hutton, and Mr. Garnet
seemed not to hear him.
“ I am sure I don't know, sir,” answered the maid, "for none of
us done any harm, sir ; unless it was the bottle of pickled onions,
when master were away, and there was very few of them left, sir,
very few, I do declare to you, and we thought they was on the turn,
sir, and it seemed such a pity to waste them. And please, sir,
we've all been working like horses, though frightened out of our
lives ’most; and we fetched down all the things from your room,
where the cupboards was broken open, for 'fraid it should come on
to rain, sir; and we've taken all our meals standing, sir ; and made up
a bed on the parlour sofy, and another upon the dresser; and Miss
Pearl, what turns she have given us -Here she comes, I do declare."
“ Dr. Hutton,” said Bull Garnet hastily, “good-bye ; I am much
obliged to you. I shall see you, I hope, next week. Good-bye,
good-bye. Excuse me.”
But before he could get him out of the way—for Rufus lingered
strangely-Pearl Garnet came into the little hall, with her hair all
down her back, and her eyes distended fearfully.
There, there it is,” she cried, “there it is, I tell you ! No
wonder the tree came down upon it. No wonder the house was
crushed for it.”. And she pointed to a shattered box, tilted up end-
wise, among a heap of account-books, clothes, and furniture.
"Oh yes, you may look at it. To be sure you may look at it.
God would not have it hidden longer. I have done my best, God
knows, and my heart knows, and my-I mean that man there
knows. Is there any thing more I can do for you, any thing more,
you very dearest darling of a father? You have done so much for
me, you know. And I will only ask you one little thing—put me in
his coffin."
“ The girl is raving,” cried Mr. Garnet. “Poor thing, it comes
from her mother."
“No, it comes from her father," said Pearl, going boldly up to
him, and fixing her large bright eyes upon his. “Do as you like
with me; I don't care ; but don't put it on any one else. Oh,
father, father, father !”
Moaning, she turned away from him ; and then sprang into his
arms with shrieks. He lifted her tenderly, and forgot all about his
own safety. His great tears fell on her wan, sick face; and his
heavy heart throbbed for his daughter only, as he felt hers bounding
perilously. He carried her off to an inner room, and left them to
their own devices.
“I should like uncommonly,” said Rufus Hutton, rubbing his
chin, “to know what is in that box. Indeed, I feel it my duty at
once to ascertain."

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“No, you shan't,” cried Bob, limping across in front of it; “I
know no more than you do, sir. But I won't have father's things
pryed into.”
“You are very polite," replied the Doctor ; "a chip of the old
block, I perceive. But, perhaps, you will believe me, my boy, when
I tell you that, if ever there was a gentleman totally devoid of im-
proper curiosity, it is Dr. Rufus Hutton, sir.”
Oh, I am so glad,” said Bob; “because you won't be disap-
pointed, then."
Rufus grinned, in spite of his wrath ; but he was not to be baffled
so easily. He could not push poor Bob aside, in his present dis-
abled state, without being guilty of cowardice. So he called in an
auxiliary.
“ Betsy, my dear, your young mistress wished me just to examine
that box. Be kind enough to bring it to the light here, unless it is
too heavy for your little hands.”
Oh, if he had only said “ Miss Sarah," what a difference it might
have made !
“ Betsy, indeed !” cried Sarah, who had followed her mistress,
but, being lock out, had come bac to see the
of it; “my
name, sir, is nothing so low as that. My name is Sarah Mackar-
ness, sir, very much at your service; and
my
mother keeps a potato-
shop, the largest business in Lyndhurst, sir. Betsy, indeed! and
from a stranger, not to say a strange gentleman, for fear of making
a mistake. And as for my hands”—she thought he had been
ironical, for her hands were above regulation size“ my hands are
such as pleased God to make them, and honest hands, any how, and
doesn't want to interfere with other people's business. Oh, what
will poor Nanny say, to think of me, Sarah Mackarness, be per-
miscuous called Betsy ?”.
At this moment, when Sarah Mackarness, having recovered
breath, was starting into another native discourse on prænomina,
and Rufus was calling upon his resources for some constitutional
measure, Bull Garnet came back, treading heavily, defiant of all
that the world could do. His quick eyes, never glimpsing that way,
but taking in all the room at once, espied the box unmeddled with,
and Bob upon guard in front of it. He was his own man now again.
What did he care for any body so long as he had his children ?
“Dr. Hutton, I thought that you were gone."
'You see I am not,” said Rufus, squaring his elbows, and looking
big, for he was a plucky little fellow; “and, what's more, I don't
mean to go until I know what there is in that box of yours.”
Box, box !” cried Bull Garnet, striking his mighty forehead, as
if to recall some memory ; “have we a box of yours, Dr. Hutton ?"
“No, no; that box of your own. Your daughter told us to
examine it. And, from her manner, I believe that I am bound to
do so."


## p. 207 (#219) ############################################

INTRUDERS ARE EXTRUDED.
207
“ Bound to examine one of my boxes !” Bull Garnet never looked
once that way, and Rufus took note of the strange avoidance ; “my
boxes are full of confidential papers ; surely, sir, you have caught
my daughter's—I mean to say, you are labouring under some
hallucination."
“There are no papers in that box. The contents of it are metal.
I have seen one article already through the broken cover, and shall
not forget its shape. Beware ; there have been strange things done
in this neighbourhood. If you refuse to allay my suspicions, you
confirm them."
The only answer he received was a powerful hand at the back of
his neck, a sensation of being lifted with no increase of facilities for
placid respiration ; finally, a parabolic curve of great rapidity
through the air, and a loud sound as of a bang. Recovering reason's
prerogative, he found himself in a dahlia, whose blossoms, turned
into heel-balls by the recent frost, were flapping round his counte-
nance, and whose stake had gone through his waistcoat back, and
grazed his coxendix, or something; he knows best what it was, as a
medical man deeply interested.
He had also a very unpleasant reminiscence of some such words
as these, to which he had no responsive power, “ You won't take a
hint like a gentleman ; so take a hit like a blackguard."
Dr. Rufus Hutton was not the man to sit down quietly under an.
insult of any sort. At the moment he felt that brute force was irre-
sistibly in the ascendant, and he was wonderfully calm about it. He
shook himself, and smoothed his waistcoat, and tried the stretch of
his braces ; then never once looked towards the house, never shook
his fist, nor so much as frowned. He walked off to his darling Polly
as if nothing at all had happened ; gave the man a shilling for hold-
ing her, after looking long for a sixpence ; then mounted, and rode
towards Nowelhurst Hall, showing no emotion whatever. Only
Polly knew that burning tears of a gallant man's bitter sense of out-
rage
fell
upon her glossy shoulder, and were fiercely wiped away.
At the Hall he said nothing about it; never even mentioned that
he had called at Garnet's cottage ; but told Sir Cradock, like a true
man, of poor Eöa's troubles, of her now forlorn condition, and power
of heart to feel it. He even contrived to interest the bereaved man,
now so listless, in the young life thrown upon his care, as if by the
breath of heaven. We are never so eloquent for another as when our
own hearts are moved deeply by the feeling of wrong to ourselves;
unless, indeed, we are very small, and that subject excludes all
others.
So it came to pass that the best new carriage was ordered to the
door, and Sir Cradock would himself have gone-only Rufus Hutton
had left him, and the eloquence was oozing. The old man, there-
fore, turned back on the threshold, saying to himself that it would
be hardly decent to appear in public yet; and Mrs. O'Gaghan was

sent instead, sitting inside, and half afraid to breathe for fear of the
crystal. As for her clothes, they were good enough, she knew, for
the Lord Mayor's coach. "Five-and-sixpence a yard, ma'am, lave
alone trimming and binding.” But, knowing what she did of herbs,
she could not answer for the smell of peppermint in the britchska.
It was not however found safe to bring that young Eöa home yet;
but Biddy had orders to stay there until the poor child should be
movable. Biddy took to her at once, in her heavy, long-drawn
sleep, with the soft black lashes now and then lifting from the rich
brown cheek.
“An' if she isn't illigant, then,” said Biddy to Mrs. Brown, “ate
me wi’out a purratie. Arl coom ov' the blude, missus. Sazins,
then, if me and Pat had oonly got a child this day! Belikes,
ma'am, for the matter o' that, a drap o'whisky disagrays with you.
Biddy, feeling strongly moved, and burning to drink her new
child's health, showed a small flask of brown potheen.
“To tell you the truth, mem," said Mrs. Brown, “ I know nothing
about them subjects. Spirituous liquors is a thing as has always
been beyond me.”
“ Thin I'll clap it away again,” said Biddy, “and the divvil only
the wiser. I never takes it alone, marm."
“It would ill become me, mem," replied Mrs. Brown, "to be
churlish in my own house, mem. I have heard of you very often,
mem. Yes, I assure you I have, from the people as comes to bathe
here, as a lady of great experience in diseases of the chest. If you
recommend any cordial, mem, on the strength of your experience,
for a female of weak witality, I should take it as a dooty, mem,
strictly as a dooty to my husband and two darters."
Arrah, then, weak's the wise femmale. Me witality goes cross-
ways, like, till I has a drap o' the crather.” And so they made a
night of it, and Mr. Brown had some.

A HARD FLINT TO CRACK.

Amy; thee, too, rare Bull, and thee, O Rufus, overcast with anger.
It is time to track the steps of him whom Fortune, blithe at her
cruel trade, shall track as far as Gades, Cantaber, and wild Syrtes,
where the Moorish billow is for ever heaving. Will he exclaim with

and wrap me in my manhood robe, and woo the upright poverty,
the bride without a dower.” A very fine sentiment, Master Horace;
but were you not a little too fond even of Sabine and Lesbian
when the Massic juice was beyond your credit—to do any thing
more than write it?
As Cradock Nowell trudged that night towards the Brockenhurst
Station, before he got very far from Amy, and while her tears were
still on his cheek, he felt a little timid lick, a weak offering of
sympathy.
Hereby black Wena made known to him that she was melted by
his misfortunes, and saw that the right and most feeling course, and
the one most pleasing to her dead master, was the transfer of her
allegiance, and the swearing of fealty to the brother. To which
conclusion the tender mode in which she was being carried con-
duced, perhaps, considerably; for she was wrapped in Clayton's
woolly jacket, enthroned on Cradock's broad right arm, and with
only her black nose exposed to the moon. So she jogged along
very comfortably, until she had made up her mind, and given
Cradock the kiss of seisin.
“Dear little thing,” he cried, for he looked on her now as Amy's
keepsake," you shall go with me wherever I go. You are faithful
enough to starve with me; but you shall not starve until after
>
me.
Then he put her down, for he thought that a little run would do
her good, and, in spite of all her misery, Amy had kept her pretty
plump, as plump as she herself was ; and it became no joke to
carry her, with a travelling-bag, &c., after the first half-mile.
Then Wena capered about, and barked, and came and licked his
shoe, and offered to carry the coat for him. As he would not let
her do this, she occupied her mind with the rabbits, which were out
upon the feed largely, and were the last she would see for a long
while, except the fat Ostenders.
Thus went Cradock to London, and after a day or two found
himself in small lodgings at a Mrs. Ducksacre's, “greengrocer and
general fruiterer, Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square.”
Now, what made him rush to London; and what need had
London, at this time, of any such young fellow ? The latter
question at once is answered, by the one word—“None." Cradock
had no money.
London thinks of nothing else but money. He
was not worth swallowing.
Why he went to London is a broadly different question, and
beyond the answer of a man who has not done it. Even perhaps
beyond the answer of a man who has done the like, whether in hope
or in despair ; and found it turn out just the same as things turn
out in his own village. To talk of “the centre of the world,” and
“merit acknowledged,” is rubbish. The number of the people only
drives them more to walk in track. However, Cradock being here,

ness.
it was not long before he made two important discoveries more
valuable than flattering.
The first of these discoveries was, that our university portals are
a mere side-postern, and not the janua mundi. He found his
classical scholarship, his early fame at Oxford, his love of elegant
literature, rather a disadvantage than a recommendation for busi-
“Prigs, sir, prigs," said a member of an eminent City firm to whom
Cradock bore a letter; “of course, I don't mean to be personal; but
I have always found your Oxford men prigs, unfit for desk-work.
You fancy you know so much; you are always discovering mare's-
nests, and you won't bear to be spoken to, even if you stick to your
work; which, I assure you, is quite the exception. Then you hold
yourself aloof, with your stupid etiquette, from the other young men,
who are quite as good as you are. I assure you, the place was too
hot to hold us with the last Oxford man we tried with us; he gave
himself such airs and graces! I vowed never to do it again : and
I never will, sir. Good morning, sir; Gregson, show this gentle-
man the way out.”
Gregson did so with a grin, for Cradock's proud face showed
that the banker had not been altogether wrong.
Is this prejudice (or, rather, perhaps, one should say, this
aversion) disappearing now-a-days, or is it upon the increase ? At
any rate, one cause of it is being removed most rapidly; for the
buckram etiquette of Oxford will soon be a mere tradition. Old
Oxford men are much afraid that “Alma Mater” may run too far
into the “free and easy."
Cradock's other discovery was that 50l. is no large capital to
commence in life with, especially when the owner does not find his
start prepared for him ; fails to prepare it for himself; and has
never been used to economy. He would not apply to any of his
father's friends, or of the people whom he had known in London,
to help him in this emergency. He would rather starve than do
that; for he had dropped all name and claim of Nowell, and cut
his life in twain at manhood; and the parts should never join
again. Only one feeling should be common to the two existences,
to the happy and the wretched life; that one feeling was the love
of Amy, and, what now seemed part of it, his gratitude to her
father.
Mr. Rosedew had commended him to a clergyman in London, a
man of high standing and large influence, an intimate friend of the
rector at college, now past out of ken, as all such friends are apt to
do, yet borne in kindly remembrance. But the youth had not
undertaken to deliver that credential, and he never did so. It
would have kept him to his identity, which (so far as the
world was concerned) he wished to change entirely, immediately,
and irrevocably,

mankind and of personal insignificance, which are so far removed
from all the enthusiasm, exclusiveness, and strong identity of
youth. Therefore young Cradock did nothing more than was
natural at his age when he fancied that every one even in London
would shrink at the sound of his name, as from a man who had
slain his brother. So he called himself “Nowell” no longer-
although the name is common enough in one form or another : the
Nowells of Nowelhurst, however, are proud of the double l, and
think a good deal of the w—and Cradock Nowell became “ Charles
Newman," without licence of Her Majesty.
Even before his vain attempts to enter the stronghold of com-
merce, and before he had learned that Oxford men are not thought
“prima virorum,” he had lifted the latch of literature, but the door
would not swing back for him. The mare magnum—to mix
metaphors, although bars are added to the Lucrine—the inare
magnum of letters was more like his native element; and, if he
once could have only gotten-bare-footed as all must go--over the
jagged rocks which hedge that most capricious sea, no doubt he
might have swum there.
In one respect he was fortunate. The publishers upon whom he
called were gentlemen, and told him the truth.
“Oh, poetry !” exclaimed one and all, as their eyes fell upon his
manuscript, we cannot take it on our own account; and, if we
published it at your expense, we should only be robbing you."
“Indeed !" replied Cradock, in the first surprise; “is there no
chance, then, of a sale for it?"
“None whatever. Poetry, unless it be some one's whose name is
well known, is a perfect drug in the market. In the course of ten
or a dozen years, by advertising continually, by influence among
the reviewers, by hitting some popular vein, or being taken up by
some authority, you might attain an audience. Are you ready to
encounter all this? Even if you are, we must decline, we are sorry
to say, to have any thing to do with it.”
“Verse, eh? Better have cut your throat !” more tersely replied
an elderly gentleman, proud of growing currants, and of insulting
ambitious authors.
However, even that last was a friend, when compared with some
whom his evil star might have led him to consult.
These advertise their patent methods of putting a work before
the public, without any risk to the author, &c., &c. Disinterested
gentlemen! They are to have no profit whatever, except from the
sale of the work, and they know they won't sell five copies.
However, there are not many of this sort in an honourable and
most important profession; and Cradock Nowell was lucky enough

not to fall in with any of them. So he accepted the verdict so
unanimously returned, and stored away with a heavy heart his
laborious little manuscript. It was only a translation in verse of
the Halieutics, and a few short original pieces-the former at any
rate valuable, because revised by John Rosedew.
A proud and perilous thing it is, for any young man knowing
nothing of the broad and narrow ways of human nature-now
called life”-suddenly to plunge unaided into the world of
London.
Not that any thing, in London, any man, or even woman, is
distinct in any way from what the same three genders show in any
country village ; neither is there any wonder (with the business we
are doing) that we have a city nearly half as large as Rome was in
the second century; and by downright noise disturbing any body's
judgment.
From all the gay temptations ready for a youth of good estate,
bright vigour, and fine inexperience, Cradock was saved, of course,
by his bitter, and ever-abiding misery. Even if his want of money,
and his native manliness, and modesty, had not been there, to
help him against enemies, there was all the power of trouble to
deepen and to strengthen him. Dark, uncertain, and unaccustomed
as his own state and prospects were, perhaps he was all the more
inclined to look abroad for change, relief, and deliverance from
brooding. Neither was he any longer hardened, as at first seemed
likely, by his own affliction. The sense of a bitter wrong from
heaven, the resentment and defiance of a blow so fatal and
mysterious, even the pain and indignation caused inevitably by his
father's cold estrangement, these and other elements of sternness
and misanthropy, although still present, were checked and weakened
by larger and better influence. The warmth of kindness and
delicate pity shown to him at the rectory, and even by the simple-
hearted people about Nowelhurst, the calm bright faith and gentle
suasion of an intellect far riper and much larger than his own, most
of all the pure affection and sweet maiden confidence of Amy, his
own Amy-Cradock had no idea how all these things had wrought
But the effect was there ; and now he could not look upon great
trouble (such as it is hard to help discovering in London) without
being able and compelled to enter into it.
When a man is man enough to let his heart begin to move at the
miseries of other men, it is by nature's order made a terrible mishap
for him. He cannot even feel his comfort all his own, and undis-
turbed; he has not in his property the pride which should possess
him ; vague ideas flit about him; and he is afraid to seem a fool
to all his neighbours.
Yet at moments (far apart, and nothing upon average) this man
has the purest and the highest pleasure known to man. He feels
upon him.

that he has raised and greatened, towards and in the eternity, a
· fellow particle of mankind.
So it came to pass that Cradock, yielding daily bit by bit of
misery and fatalism, and with more and more of interest in the
world around him, did begin, and then went on, from looking
round him on the level at the people kindly, after a little earthly
practice, to look up to heaven again.
There is a flint of peculiar character, and which has some local
name, found sometimes on the great Chissel Bank, and away
towards Lyme Regis. As hard, and sullen, and dull a flint (with
even the gleam of its fusion lost from the chafing of the waves) a
stone as grey and foggy-looking as ever Deucalion grew weary of
casting over his left shoulder into an empty world. Yet this Aint
has, through the heart of it, traversing from pole to pole (for the
shape is always conical) a thread, a spindle, a siphuncle, of the
richest golden hue. None but those who are used to it can see the
head of the golden column, can even guess its existence. The
stone is not hollow; it is quite distinct from all pudding-stones and
conglomerates.
Many such fints poor Crad came across, among his nearest
neighbours, the dwellers in a court hard by, into which he was led
one morning by a cry of sore distress. One, especially, one great
fellow, was harder and rougher than any flint, like the matrix of the
concentric jasper. No good had come nigh him for such a time
that he scarce knew good from evil now, and getting so much more
of the latter, showed the spirit of a Briton by contentment with it.
The only right of a true Briton (except of course that of being
drunk) which his self-respect would not allow him to surrender,
was, as scarcely need be said, the right of leathering his own
wife.
This is a part of our constitution; as all magistrates allow, and
with proper reverence for long-established privilege, really deſer
a little to the modern tone of thought, when they fine a noble
fellow five shillings, if he did not kick much; and if he overdid this
latter pleasant pastime,-fifteen shillings !
No man ever ought to pay for having shown his manhood. It
cannot always be proved at first, how thoroughly, upon reflection,
the good wife enjoyed it. But in nine causes out of ten, she swears,
on remand, the opposite to all she swore in the first sting of it.
The excellent woman whose cries drew Cradock from his proper
course that morning was a certain Rachell Jupp. Every body
in the court was well accustomed to her noise, and no more
dreamed of interfering than of stealing her Sunday dinner. It was
only “Zakey” at his little game, and no harm ever came of it.
Moreover, there was another good reason to restrict curiosity. It
was well proven that Issachar Jupp could lick any two men in the
court. A bargee, Mr. Jupp was, of good intentions-at least, when

he took to the cuddy; but his horses had pulled crosswise ever
since ;
and the devil knew, better than the angels now, what his
nature was come to.
“None of your d-d Scripture-reading for me!” he cried, when
Cradock came near him ; mistaking him, in the heat of his
exercise, for another fine young fellow who had been there now
and then.
“You blackguard !” said Cradock, and nothing more. But the
stern deep sorrow of his eyes stirred or soothed some rugged
sorrow in the heart of Issachar. His lifted fist relaxed and
opened, as with love of pluck he saw how calmly Cradock gazed at
it; neither would his rude heart back him up to strike a weaker
man, and one of such an aspect. As for beating a woman, of
course, he never meant to hurt her much.
Cradock went on his way without the smallest idea of having
done a thing of any bravery, or even of any good at all. But
having once entered that “Paradise Court,” so near his own poor
lodgings, he seemed in some way forced to go again and seek the
people.
Mr. Jupp, having drunk out his wages, went upon river or canal
again; and the youth, being far too free of hand for one in his con-
dition, let some of his worry float away in the gay tide of being
cheated.
Now, to do justice (late perhaps, but better late than never) to
two of those conventionally vulgarly and universally abused folk
who let lodgings, Mrs. and Miss Ducksacre, Cradock Nowell's
landladies, were very good-hearted women, but, like many other
women of that fibre, whose education has been neglected, of a hot
and hasty order. Not that we need suppose the pepper to be
neutralized by the refinement, only to be absorbed more equably,
and transfused more delicately.
One dark and foggy November evening, a little thing came
feeling the way into the narrow, dingy shop of the good Ducksacre
firm, gradually groping along by the sacks of potatoes (all of them
“seconds,” for the firm did not deal much in “Ware Regents,")
feeling its way along the sacks which towered above its head, like
bulky snow-giants embrowned with thaw; and then by the legs of
the “tatie-bin," with the great scales hanging above it, and then by
the heap of lighting-wood, piled in halfpenny bundles, with the
ends against the wall : and so the little thing emerged between
two mighty hills of coleworts, and under the frugal gas-burner,
and congratulated itself, with a hug of the infant heart, upon
safety.
"Take care, my dear,” cried Mrs. Ducksacre, looking large behind
the counter,
or you'll tumble down the coal-trap, where the black
bogeys lives. Bless my heart, if it ain't little Loo! Why, Loo, I
hardly knew you. You ain't looking like yourself a bit, child.

215
And who sent you out at this time of night? What a shame, to be
sure !"
Loo, the pride of Issachar Jupp, was rather a pretty little body,
about three and a half years old, "going on for four," as she loved
to say, if any body asked her ; and her pale but clean face would
have been very pretty, if her mother would have let her hair
alone. But all her hair was combed well back, and tied on the
crown very tightly, like the tail of a horse at a fair, or like a
brown Cos lettuce bursting.
Now this small creature raised her eyes to that great Mrs. Ducks-
acre, while her fingers played with the coleworts, for her hands
were hot, and the dew of the country cooled them; and then, with
the instinct of nature, she stuck up for her father and mother.
“ Pease, ma'am, Loo not fray much,"—though her trembling frock
belied her, all over the throat and the heart of it—"and father don
from home, ma'am, on the Wasinstote” [Basingstoke canal], "and
mother dot nobody, on'y Loo, to do thins. And she send this,'cause
Loo's poor troat be bad, ma'am.”
The little child, whose throat was tied up with worn flannel as if
from a char-bucket, with the grey edge still upon it, wriggled in and
out of her shape and self, in the way only children can do ; and at
length drew, from some innermost shrine, a halfpenny and a
farthing.
“And what am I to give you for it, Loo? Oh, you poor little thing,
how very hoarse you are !"
Loo, with a confidence in human nature purely non-Londinian, had
placed her cash upon the altar, upon the inside of which so many
worship, while on the outside so many are sacrificed! without
circumlocution, the counter. Her eyes were below the rim of it, till
she stood upon tiptoe with one foot, while the other was up in the
colewort roots, and then she could see the money, and she poked
out her little lips at it, as if she would fain suck it back again.
“Pease, ma'am, Loo's troat so bad, mother are going to make a
'tew, tree ha’porth of tipe and a ha’porth of ’egents and a fardy of
inons !”
“What a splendid stew, Loo !” said Mrs. Ducksacre, seeming to
smell it ; "and so you want a ha’porth of taties, and a farthing's
worth of onions. And you shall have them, my dear, and as good a
three farthings' worth as ever was put up in London. Where are you
going to put them all ?”
Loo opened her sore throat, and pointed down it. She had not
yet lost her appetite ; and that child did love tripe so.
“No, no, I don't mean that, Loo. I know you have a nice room
inside ; though some will be for mother, won't it now? I mean,
how are you going to carry it home?”
“In Loo's pinney,” replied the child, delighted with her success;
for ever so many people had told her, that the Ducksacres low

were getting so high, they would soon leave off making farthings-
worths ; and any tradesman who comes to that rises beyond the poor
street-child.
“My dear, your pinney won't hold them, potatoes are so cheap
now” —she had just declared they were awfully dear to a lady
whom she disliked—“I am sure you can't carry a ha’porth. Oh,
Mr. Newman, you are so good-natured”—Cradock was just coming
in, rather glum from another failure of obtaining some employment-
" I really don't believe you would think you were bemeaning yourself
by going home with this poor little atom.”
"I should rather hope I would not," replied Cradock, looking
grand.
“Oh, I did not know. I beg your pardon, I'm sure.
myself, only Sally is out, and the boy gone home ever so long ago.
I beg your pardon, I'm sure, Mr. Newman-I thought you were so
good-natured.”
“ Mrs. Ducksacre," said Cradock, "you utterly misunderstand
I spoke to the form of your sentence, perhaps, rather than to its
meaning. What I meant was, that I should rather hope I would
not think it below me to go home with this little dear. Why, I
know this little creature well ; and her name is Louisa Jupp."
“ Tiss Loo,” said the little child, standing up on tiptoe, and
spreading out her arms to Cradock. All the children loved him, as
the little ones at Nowelhurst would run after Mr. Rosedew. Chil-
dren are even better judges of character than dogs.
“Why, you poor little soul,” said Crad, as he seated her on his
strong right arm with her little cheek to his, and she drew a thousand
straws of light through her lashes from the gas-jet, which she had
never yet been so close to, “how hot and dry your lips are ! I hope
you are not taking the-sickness”—he was going to say “fever,"
but feared to frighten Loo.
“Mother fray," cried the small girl, proud of the importance
accruing to her, “Loo dot wever, Irishers dot bad wever on the foor
below mother. Loo det nice thins, and lay abed, if me dot the
wever.”
“Put the poor child's things, whatever they are, in a basket, Mrs.
Ducksacre. How odd her little legs feel! And a shilling's worth
of grapes, if you please, in a bag by themselves. Here's the money
for them. You know I'll bring back the basket. But the bags
don't come back, do they ?”
“No, sir, of course not. Half-a-crown a gross for the small ones,
with the name and the cross-handle basket, and the cabbage and
carrots, sir. Sixpence more for cornopean-pattern with a pine-apple,
and grapes and oranges. But lor, sir, the cornopean" (cornucopiæ]
would frighten half our customers. The basket-pattern pays
better for an advertisement than to get them back again, even if
parties would bring them, which I knows well they never would, sir.""

A HARD FLINT TO CRACK.
217
Then Cradock set forth with the child on his arm, his coat
thrown over his shoulders, and the best shilling's worth of foreign
grapes-Mrs. Ducksacre never bought English ones—and the best
three farthings' worth of potatoes and onions that was made that
day by any tradesman in any part of London, not excluding “them
low costers," as the Ducksacre firm expressed it.
Little Loo Jupp's sore throat proved to be, as Cradock feared it
would, the first symptom of scarlet fever; and the young man had
the pleasure—one of the highest and purest pleasures which any
man can have—of saving a human life. He watched that trembling
flame of life, and fostered it, and sheltered it, as if “the hopes of
a nation hung”—as our great journals love to say of some babe not
a whit more valuable—upon its feeble flicker. He hired another
room for her, where the air was purer; he made the doctor attend
to the case, which at first that doctor cared little to do; he
brought her many a trifling comfort; in a word, he waited upon her
so that the old women of the court called him thenceforth, “ Nurse
Newman."
“What, you here again, you white-livered young sneak !” cried
Issachar Jupp, reeling in at the door, just as Cradock was coming
out one day; “take that, then--" and he lifted a great oak
bludgeon, newly cut from the towing-path of the Basingstoke Canal.
If Cradock had not been as quick as lightning, and caught the stick
over the bargeman's shoulder, there would have been weeping and
wailing and a lifelong woe for Amy.
“ Hush,” he said ; “ don't make such a noise, man. Your child
is at the point of death, in the room overhead.”
Poor Crad, naturally of a bright complexion, but pale from long
adversity, might now have retorted the compliment as to the
whiteness of liver; the bargee turned so pale, that he looked like a
collier's tablecloth. Then he planted his heavy stick on the ground,
to save him from lying flat on his threshold.
“ My Loo, my Loo ! My little bright Loo! What a damned lie
to tell me !"
I wish it was, Mr. Jupp," said Cradock. " But don't be over-
frightened. We hope with all our hearts to save her, and to-night
we shall know. Already the doctor says that there is some little
change in her breathing, though her tongue is like a furnace.”
He spoke with a tone and in a voice which no man ever has
described, nor shall ; but which every born man feels to be genuine,
long ere he can think.
The only answer Jupp could make was a little gasp, and half a
sob, and then two gre tears guttering down the coal-dust of his
countenance. The rugged, coarse, defiant nature of the man was
cloven, for the moment, through and through; the power of evil was
gone from him, and the power of good not come.
Cradock having no experience of any trouble, except his own, felt

ashamed to seem to notice how this man was taking it. And while
he turned away, the bargeman managed to let some shaggy locks
fall over his “ damned" eyes.
Now come up with me, Mr. Jupp,” said Crad, taking care not to
look at him, out at this door, in at the other. Poor little soul !
she has been so good. You can't think how good she has been.
And she has taken her medicine so nicely."
“ Pray God Almighty not to damn me, for not damning myself
enough,” said Issachar Jupp, below his breath, as up the rickety
stairs he tottered, with the help of Cradock's arm.
It was his first attempt to pray. The form was not-to put it
mildly-altogether orthodox. Elegant writers, sweetly dallying
with the quill of the turtle dove, whose highest ambition is to
repose on the surface of human polish, as a gilded cloth lies on a
drawing-room table—“shocked” is their favourite word of the few
in their native tongue fine enough for them.
Shocked they would be to hear such a speech, and far more
shocked to repeat it, but what is shocking to mannikins may not
earn the spite but pity of men, and of the powers that guard them.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
COALS ARE UP.
LITTLE Loo's fever “took the turn" that night. Cradock went
away, of course, committing the child to her father ; and the savage
bargee would have gone on his knees, and crawled in that fashion
-wherein all fashion crawls-down the rough stairs, every one of
them, if the young man would have been pleased by it.
We are just beginning to scorn the serfdom of one mind to
another. We begin to desire that no man should, without fair
argument, accept our dicta as equal to his own in wisdom. And even
if time could reproduce for us Shakespeare, Bacon, and Newton, we
should now be inclined to refer to committee any propositions they
might offer.
And yet the servience, not of the mind, but of the heart to a larger
one, is a fealty most honourable to the giver and the receiver. In
a bold independent man, such as Issachar Jupp was, this fealty was
not to be won by any of those pretty sentiments about birth, clan-
ship, wealth, position, appearance, &c., which reconcile us to our
habit of circumcising the New Testament–it was only to be won by
proof that the other heart was bigger than his, and the owner of it

Jupp ?”
grander. Jupp never asked how or why; he was not a man of
reasoning power, but well content to feel things.
Now small Loo Jupp being out of danger, and her father, grinning
like a gridiron with the fire-light behind it, every day at her bed-
side, the force of circumstances-which, in good English, means the
want of money-sent Cradock Nowell once more cat’s-cradling
throughout London, to answer vile advertisements. His heart rose
within him every day as he set out in the morning, and in the same
relative position fell, as he came home every evening.
“Do, sir, do,” cried Issachar Jupp, who never swore now, before
Cradock, except under strongest pressure; “do come aboard our
barge. I've aʼmost a-got the appointment of skipper to the Indus-
trious Maiden, homeside of Nine Elms, as tight a barge as ever
was built, and the name done in gold letters. Fact, I may say, and
not tell no secrets; I be safe to be aboord of her, if my Loo allow
me to go, and I don't swear hard at the check-house. And, per-
haps, I shall be able to help it, after Loo so ill, and you such a
hangel.”
“Well, I don't know," replied Cradock, who could not bear to
simulate intense determination ; “I should like a trip into the
country, if I could earn my wages as traveller, or whatever it is.
But suppose the canal is frozen up before our voyage begins,
“Oh, damn that !" cried Issachar, for the idea was too much for
him, even in Cradock's presence; “I never yet knew a long winter,
sir, after a wonderful stormy autumn.”
And in that conclusion he was right, to the best of all present
experience. Perhaps because the stormy autumn shows the set of
the Gulf Stream.
By this time more than a month had passed since Cradock and
Wena arrived in London; half his money was spent, and he had
found no employment. He had advertised, and answered advertise-
ments, till he was tired. He had worn out his last pair of boots
with walking, for he had thought it better to walk, as it might be of
service to him to know London thoroughly; and that knowledge
can only be acquired by perpetual walking.
No man can be said to know London thoroughly, who does not
know the suburbs also-who, if suddenly put down at the Elephant
and Castle, or at Shoreditch Church, cannot tell exactly whither
each of the six fingers points. Such knowledge very few men
possess; it requires the genius loci—to apply the expression bar-
barously—as well as peculiar calls upon it. Cradock, of course,
could not attain such knowledge in a month. Indeed, he was
obliged to ask his way to so well-known a part as Hammersmith,
when he had seen an advertisement for a clerk, to help in some
coal-office there.
With the water quelching in his bools (which were worn away to

the welting)—for the sky was like the pulp of an orange, and the
pavement wanted draining-he turned in at a little gate near the
temporary terminus of the West London line.
In a wooden box, with a kitchen behind it, he found Mr. Clinkers,
the advertiser; who thought, when he saw Crad's face, that he was
come to give a large order; and when he saw his boots, that he was
come to ask to be errand-boy. Clinkers was a familiar, jocular,
red-faced fellow, whom his friends were fond of calling “not at all a
bad sort."
“ Take a glass, mister," said he, when Cradock had stated his
purpose; “ won't do you no harm such a day as this, and I don't
fancy 'twould me either. Jenny! Jenny! Why, bless that gal;
ever since my poor wife died, she's along of them small-coals
fellows. I'll bet a tanner she is. What do you say to it, sir? Will
“Well,” replied Cradock, smiling, “it wouldn't be at all a fair
bet. In the first place, I know nothing of Miss Jenny's propen-
sities; and, in the second, I have no idea what the small-coals
fellows are."
The small-coals men are the truck-drivers and the greengrocers
in the by-streets, who buy the crushings and riddlings by the sack,
at the wharf or terminus, and sell them by the quarter hundred-
weight, at a profit of two hundred per cent. Cradock might have
known this, for the Ducksacre firm did a little in coal, but kept it
away from the counter.
Mr. Clinkers could not stop to explain ; only he said to himself,
Pretty fellow to apply for a clerkship in the coal-line, and not
know that !”
Jenny appeared at last, looking perfectly self-possessed.
Jenny, you baggage, two tumblers and silver teaspoons in no
time. And the little kettle ; mind now, I tell you the little kettle.
Can't you understand, gal, that I may want to shave with the water,
but ain't going to have the foot-tub?"
Jenny's broad face, mapped with coal-dust, grinned from ear to
ear, as she looked at her master saucily—a proof almost infallible
of a very genial government. She heard that shaving joke every
day, and, the more she heard it, the more she enjoyed it. So the
British public, at a theatre, or an election, appreciates a joke
according to the square of the number of the times the joke has
been poked at it. There is nothing so good as the British percep-
tion, and the blunt knife that opens the oyster.
“Queer gal, that,” said Clinkers, producing his raw material ;
non queer gal, sir, as any you may have met with.”
“No doubt of it,” replied Cradock;“and now for the cause of my
visit
Hang me, sir, you don't understand that gal. I say she is the
queerest gal that ever lived out of a barge. You should see her

when she gets along of some of them small-coals fellows. Blow me
if she can't twist a dozen of them round her finger, sir.”
“And her master, too,” thought Cradock; "unless I am much
mistaken, she will be the new Mrs. Clinkers.”
Jenny heard most of her master's commentary, as she was going to
and fro, and she kept up a constant grin without speech, in the
manner of an empty coal-scuttle.
“Ah, sir, grief is a dry thing, a sad dry thing !” and Clinkers
banged down his tumbler till the spoon reeled round the brandy;
no business, if you please now, not a word of business till we both
be below the fiddle ; and, if it isn't to your liking, speak out like a
“Below the fiddle, Mr. Clinkers! What fiddle? I don't at all
understand you."
“Very few people does, young man; very few people indeed.
Scarcely any, I may say, except Jenny and the cookshop woman;
and the latter have got encumbrances as quite outweighs the busi-
Ain't you ever heard of the fiddle of a teaspoon, sir ?”
Oh, very well,” said Cradock, tossing off his brandy-and-water
to bring things to a point. It was a good thing for him that he got
it, poor fellow, for he was sadly wet and weary.
Lor, now, to see that !” cried Clinkers, opening his eyes ; I'm
blowed if you musn't be a Hoxford gent.”
“To be sure, so I am,” replied Cradock, laughing; “but I should
not have thought that you would have known-1 mean, I am sur-
prised that you, at this distance, should know any thing of Oxford
men."
“Tell you about that presently. Come over again the fire, sir.
Up with your heel-tap, and have another.”
“No, thank you, Mr. Clinkers. You are very kind; but I shall
not take one drop more.”
“ Then you ain't been there very long, that's certain. Now you
have come about this place, I know; though it's a queer one for a

eyes on you. Ah, I knows the aristocraxy, sir. Now, what might
be your qualifications ?”
“None whatever; except that, of course, I have had a good
education.”
“Whew !” whistled Mr. Clinkers, and that sound was worth fifty
sentences.
“Then you think,” said Cradock, not so greatly downcast, for he
had got this little speech now by heart, “ that I am not likely to be
of any service to you ?”.
“ Knows what they Hoxford gents is,” continued Clinkers, re-
flectively; come across a lot of them once, when I was gay and
rattling. They ran into my tax-cart, coming home from Ascot,
about a mile this side of Brentford. Famous good company over a

glass, when they drops their aristocraxy; they runs up a tick all
over town, and leaves a Skye dog to pay for it; comes home about
four in the morning, and don't know the latch from the scraper.
Always pays in the end, though; nearly always pays in the end-so
a Hoxford tradesman told me—and interest ten per cent. Different
there from the medicals; the fast medicals never do pay, sir.”
“Very well,” the young man answered, with the soft sad smile
which now might be expected from him ; “ I thank you, Mr. Clinkers,
for your kindness and hospitality, to which I am not much accus-
tomed. I have taken up your time for nothing. But if you had
said, when you advertised, that experience was needful, I would
not have troubled you. Good evening, Mr. Clinkers."
Stop, stop. Just understand me. I don't care that for experience.
Jenny could show you that. But the fact is that you Hoxford gents
ain't got the grease for business.”
Sorely down at heart and heel, Cradock plodded away from the
yard of the hospitable Clinkers, who came to the door and looked
after him, fearing to indulge his liking for that queer young fellow.
But he had taken Crad's address; for who knew but something
might turn up?
"He ain't a gent, he's a gentleman !" Clinkers softly uttered,
with his hands far down his pockets : “very likes, a baronet ; but
down on his luck most dreadful. I wish I could do something for
him. But it ain't to be thought of."
“That man,” said Cradock to himself, stepping out from the
black to the brown mud, “has a kindly heart, and would have
helped me if he could. He wanted to pay my fare back to town,
but of course I would not let him. It was well worth while to come
all this distance, and get wet through twice over, to come across a
kind-hearted man, when a fellow is down so. I began with apply-
ing for grand places ; what a fool I was! Places worth 150l. or
2001. a year. No wonder I did not get them : and what a lot of
leather wasted ! Now I am come down to 50l. per annum, and 751.
would be a fortune. If I had only begun at that mark, I might have
got something by this time. Vaulting ambition doth o'erleap
itself.' And I might have emigrated-good Heavens! I might
have emigrated upon the bounty of Uncle John, to some land where
a man is worth more than the cattle of the field. Only Amy stopped
me, only the thought of my Amy. Darling love, the sweetest angel
--stop, I am so unlucky; if I begin to bless her, very likely she'll
get typhus fever. After all, what does it matter what sort of life I
take to ? Or whether, indeed, I take the trouble to take to any at
all ? Only for her sake, her sake. A man who has done what I
have lives no more, but drags his life. Now I'll go in for common
labour, work of the hands and muscles; many a better man has
done it ; and it will be far wiser for me while my brain is so loose
and wandering. I wonder I never thought of that. Isn't it raining,

though! What we used, in the happy days, to call'Woud Fidley
The future chironax trudged more cheerfully after this decision.
But he was sorry to get so soaked, for, in spite of Miss Rosedew's
providence, he was getting as scant of raiment now as were the sons
of the prophets. He had brought but one suit of his own; and all
he had bought with the rector's money was six shirts at 35. 6d., and
four pairs of cotton hose. So he could not afford to get wet too
often.
There could be no doubt that he was shabbily dressed, no rich
game to an hotel-tout, no tempting fare to a cabman : but neither
could there be any doubt that he was a pure and noble gentleman.
That was as clear as in the heyday of finest Oxford dandyism. Only
he carried his head quite differently, and the tint of his cheeks was
gone. He used to walk with his broad and well-set head thrown
back, and slightly inclined to one side; now it began to flag and
droop, as if the spring of the neck were gone.
But still the brave clear eyes met frankly all who cared to meet
them; the face and gait were of a man unhappy but not unmanly:
He looked perhaps ten years older now than he had looked two
months ago : and most of the gay friends of his youth would have
been scared at the sight of him. But for that, and all that, and
twice so much as all that, any loving girl would think him worth
tenfold of what he had been.
Soaked and tired out at last, he reached his little lodgings-quite
large enough for him, though—and found Black Wena warming the
chair, the only chair he had to sit on. Unluckily, he did not do
what a man who cared for himself would have done. Having no
change of raiment–in plain English, but one pair of trousers-he
should have gone to bed at once, or at any rate have pulled his wet
clothes off. Instead of doing so, he sat and sat, with the wet things
clinging closer to him, and the shivers crawling deeper, until his
last inch of candle was gone, and the room was cold as an ice-
house, for the rain had turned to snow at nightfall, and the fire had
not been lit.
Wena sat waiting and nodding upwards, on the yard and a half
of brown drugget, which now was her special allotment, and once
or twice she nudged her master, and whined about supper and bed-
time. But Cradock only patted her, and improved the turn of his
sentence. He was making one last effort to save from waste and
ridicule his birth, and tastes, and education.
A craftsman, if he have self-respect, is worthy, valuable, admirable,
nearer to the perception of simple truth than some men of high
refinement. Nevertheless, it is too certain-as those who know
them well, and not unkindly, can testify—that there is scarcely one
in a dozen labourers, even around the metropolis, who respects
himself and his calling. Whose fault is this? That question each

of us answers according to predilection. Probably, the guilt is
“much of a muchness," as in all mismanaged matters.
It is as lowering to us as themselves, that the "enlightened
working-men of England” cannot go out for their holiday, cannot
come home from their work, cannot even speak among their own
young children, and in the goodwife's presence, without words, not
of manly strength, but of hoggish coarseness. In time this must be
otherwise ; but the evil is not cured easily. The boy believes it
manly to talk as he hears his father talk; he rejoices in it the more,
perhaps, because the school forbids it. He does not know what the
foul words mean; and all things strange have the grandest range.
Those words tell powerfully in a story, with smaller boys round him
upon the green, or at the street-corner.
And so he grows up
engrimed with them, and his own boys follow suit.
Cradock was young and chivalrous, and knew not much of these
things, which his position had kept from him ; nor in his self-
abandonment cared he much about them. Nevertheless, he shrank
unconsciously from the lowering of his existence. And now he sat
up, writing, writing, till his wet clothes made little pools on the floor,
while he answered twenty advertisements, commercial, literary,
promiscuous. Then he looked at his little roll of postage-stamps,
and with shivering fingers affixed them. There were only fifteen ;
and it was too late to get any more that night; and he felt that he
could not afford to use them now so rashly. So he ran out into the
slushy streets, gamboged by this time with London snow, and
posted those fifteen of his letters which were the least ambitious.
By this time he knew that the best chance was of something not
over-gorgeous. Wena did not go with him, but howled until he
came back. Then he gave the poor little thing, with some self-
reproach at his tardiness, all the rest of his cottage-loaf, and his
ha'porth of milk, which she took with some protestations, looking
up at him wistfully now and then, to see whether he was eating.
No, Wena, I can't eat to-night; bilious from over-feeding, per-
haps. But I've done a good evening's work, and we'll be very
plucky for breakfast, girl, and have sixpenceworth of cold ham.
No fear there of making a cannibal of you, you innocent little
soul.”
He was desperately afraid, as most young fellows from the country
are, of having unclean animals spicily served up by the London
victuallers. This terror is the result for the most part of rustic
sham knowingness, and the British love of stale jokes. However,
beyond all controversy, dark are the rites of sepulture of the crampy
pigs around London.
He crept, at last, beneath his scanty bedding-clean, although so
patched and threadbare—and the iron cross-straps shook and
rattled with the shudders that went through him.

drugget-scrap, juniped upon the blanket at midnight, to know pray
what was the matter. Then she licked his face, and tried to warm
him, in his broken slumbers. That day he had taken a virulent
cold, which struck into his system, and harboured there for a fort-
night, till it broke out in a raging fever.
The next day, Cradock received a letter, of questionable ortho-
graphy, and bearing the Hammersmith post-mark.
“RESPECTED SIR,—Was sorry after you streaked off yesterday
that had not kept you longer. You was scarce gone out of the gate
as one might say, when in comes a gent, no end of a nob, beats you
as one might say in some respects, and a head of hair as good.
Known by the name of Hearty,—Hearty Wibraham, Esquire, but
friends prefers callin' him Hearty, such bein' his character. And
hearty he were with my brandy, I do assure you, and no mistake.
This gent say as he want to establish a hagency for the sale of first-
class Hettons to the members of the bone tons: was I agreeable to
supply him ? So I say, “Certainly, by all means, if I see my way
my money. And then he breaks out, in a manner as would
frighten some hands, about the artlessness of the age, the suspicious-
ness of commercial gents, and confidence between man and man.
Waste of time,' says I ; 'coals is coals now, and none of them
leaves this yard for nothing. Better keep that sort of stuff,' says I,
' for the green young gent from Hoxford as was here just now.'
'What,' says he, 'Hoxford man after a situation ?' 'Yes,' I says,
' nice young gent, only under a cloud.' Says he, 'I loves a Hoxford
man; hope he has got some money.' For what?' I
says ;
have
you got any thing good for him to invest it in ?' 'Haven't' I?' he
says; 'take a little more brandy, old chap'-my own brandy, mind
you, blow me if he ain't a hearty one. Well, I can't tell you half
he said, not being a talkative man myself, since the time as I lost
Mrs. Clinkers. Only the upshot of it is, I think you couldn't do
no harm by callin', if he write you as he said he would.
“Yours to command, and hope you didn't get wet,
' ROBERT CLINKERS, Jun., for POKER, CLINKERS, and Co.,
Coal Merchants, West London Terminuss, Hammersmith.
N.B.—Coke supplied in your own sacks, on the most moderate
terms. Cash upon delivery.”
By the next post Cradock got another letter, far more elegantly
written, but not half so honest.
“Mr. Hearty Wibraham, having heard of Mr. Charles Newman
from a mutual friend, Mr. Clinkers, of Hammersmith, presents his
compliments to the former gentleman, and thinks it might be worth
Mr. Newman's while to call upon him, Mr. H. W., at six o'clock
this evening, supposing the post to do its duty, which it rarely does.

district. N.B.-The above is bona fide. References will be re-
quired. Strictest confidence guaranteed.
“H. W."
"Well,” said Cradock to Wena, shivering as he said it, for the
cold was striking into him," you see we are in request, my dear.
Not that I have any high opinion of Mr. Hearty Wibraham-as a
gentleman, I mean. But for all that he may be an honest man.
And beggars—as you know, Wena, dear, when you sit up so prettily
-beggars must not be choosers. Do you think you could walk so
far, Wena ? If you could, it would do you good, my beauty ; and
I'll see that you are not run over."
Wena agreed, rather rashly, to go; for the London stones, to a
country dog, are as bad as a mussel-bank to a bather ; but she
thought she might find some woodcocks-and so she did, at the game
shops, and some curlews which they sold for them—but her real
object in going was that she had made some nice acquaintances in the
neighbourhood, whom she wanted to see again. She wouldn't speak
to any low dog, for she meant to keep up the importance and grandeur
of the Nowell family, but there were some London dogs, heigho!
they had such ways with them, and they were brushed so nicely,
what could a poor little country dog do but fall in love with them?
Therefore Wena came after her master, and made believe not to
notice them, but she lingered now and then at a scraper, and, when
she snapped, her teeth had gloves on.
When Cradock and his little dog, after many a twist and turn,
found Aurea Themis Buildings, the master rang at the sprightly
door, newly grained and varnished. Being inducted by a young
woman with a most coquettish cap on, he told black Wena to wait
outside, and she lay down upon the door-step.
Then he was shown into the first floor drawing-room,” according
to arrangement, and requested to “take a seat, sir.” The smart
maid, who carried a candle, lit the gas in a twinkling, but Cradock
wondered why the coal-merchant had no coals in his fire-place.
Just when he had concluded, after a fit of shivering, that this
defect was due perhaps to that extreme familiarity which breeds in a
grocer contempt for figs, Mr. Wibraham came in, quite by accident,
and was evidently amazed to see him.
“What! Ah, no, my good sir, not Mr. Charles Newman, a
member of the University of Oxford !”
Cradock bowed, without any answer, feeling rather uncomfort-
able at the prominent use of his "alias.”
“Then, allow me, sir, to shake hands with you. I am strongly
prepossessed in your favour, young gentleman, from the description.
I received of you from our mutual friend, Mr. Clinkers. Ah, I like
that Clinkers. No nonsense about Clinkers, sir.”
“So I believe,” said Cradock; “but, as I have only seen him
once, it would perhaps be premature of me-

“Not a bit, my dear sir, not a bit. That is one of the mistakes
we make. I always rely upon first impressions, and they never
deceive me. Now, I see exactly what you are, an upright, honour-
able man, full of conscientiousness, but not overburdened here
perhaps.”
He gave a jocular tap to his forehead, which was about half the
width of Cradock's.
“Well,” thought Cradock,"you are straightforward, even to the
verge of rudeness. But no doubt you mean well, and perhaps you
are nearer the truth than the people who have told me otherwise.
Anyhow, it does not matter much.” But, in spite of this conclusion,
his manner was rather stiff, as he answered, -
“If that be the case, Mr. Wibraham, I fear it will hardly suit
your purpose to take me into your employment.”
“Ah, I have hurt your feelings, I see. I am so blunt and hasty.
Hearty Wibraham is my name; and hearty enough I am, God
knows; and perhaps a little too hearty. 'Hasty Wibraham you
ought to be called, by Jove, you ought," said one of my friends last
night, and by Gad I think he was right, sir.”
"I am sure I don't know,” said Cradock; “how can I pretend to
say, without myself being hasty ?”
“I suppose, Mr. Newman, you can command a little capital ? It
is not at all essential, you know, in a bona fide case like yours.”
“I am glad to hear it,” said Cradock; for my capital, like the
new one of Canada, is below contempt.”
“ To a man imbued, Mr. Newman, with the genuine spirit of
commerce, no sum, however small, but may be the key of fortune.”
My key of fortune, then, is about twenty pounds ten shillings.”
A very, very small sum, my dear sir; but I dare say some of
your friends would assist you to make it, say fifty guineas. You
Oxford men are so generous ; always ready to help each other.
That is why I can't help liking you so. Thoroughly fine fellows,"
he added, in a loud aside, “thoroughly noble fellows, when a mess-
mate is in trouble. Can't apply to his family, I see; but it would
be mean in him not to let his friends help him. I do believe the
highest privilege of human life is to assist a friend in difficulties."
Cradock, of course, could not reply to all this, because he was
not meant to hear it, but he gazed with some admiration at the
utterer of such exalted sentiments. Mr. Hearty Wibraham, now
about forty-five years old, was rather tall and portly, with an aquiline
face, a dark complexion, and a quick, decisive manner. His clothes
were well made, and of good quality, unpretentious, neat, substan-
tial. His only piece of adornment was a magnificent gold watch-
chain, which rather shunned than courted observation.
“No," said Cradock, at last,“ I have not a single friend in the
world to whom I would think of applying for the loan of a sixpence.”
“ Well, we are independent !” Mr. Wibraham still held discourse

with himself; “but Hearty Wibraham likes and respects him the
more for that. He'll get over his troubles, whatever they are. My
good sir,” he continued, aloud, “I will not utter any opinion, lest
you should think me inclined to flatter—the last thing in the world
I ever would do. Nevertheless, in all manly candour, I am bound
to tell you that my prepossession in your favour induces me to make
you a most advantageous offer."
“I am much obliged to you. Pray, what is it?
' A clerkship in my counting-house, which I am just about to
open, having formed a very snug little connexion to begin with.”
“Oh!” cried Cradock, for, 'green' as he was, he would rather
have had to do with a business already well established.
I see you are surprised. No wonder, sir; no wonder! But
you must know that I shall have at least my quid pro quo. My
connexion is of a very peculiar character. In fact, it lies entirely in
the very highest circles. To meet.such customers as mine, not only
a man of gentlemanly manners is required, but a man of birth and
education. How could I offer such a man less than 1501. per
annum ?"
Your terms are very liberal, very liberal, I am sure,” replied
Cradock, reddening warmly at the appraisement of his qualities.
“I should not be comfortable without telling you frankly that I am
worth about half that yearly sum ; until, I mean, until I get a little
up to business. I shall be quite content to begin upon tool. a year.”
“No! will you, though ?” exclaimed Hearty Wibraham, flushed
with a good heart's enthusiasm. “You are the finest young fellow
I have seen since I was your age myself. Suppose, now, we split the
difference. Say 1251. ; and I shall work you pretty hard, I can tell
you. For we do not confine our attention exclusively to the mem-
bers of the Ministry and the House of Lords; we also deal with the
City magnates, and take a contract for Somerset House. And
remember one thing; you will be in exclusive charge whenever I
am away negotiating. A man deserves to be paid, you know, for
high responsibility."
And where will the”-he hardly knew what to call it—"the
office, the counting-house, the head-quarters be?”
“ Not in any common thoroughfare,” replied Mr. Wibraham,
proudly ; " that would never do for a business of such a character.
What do you think, sir, of Howard Crescent, Park Lane? Not so
bad, sir, is it, for the sale of the grimy ?"
“I really do not know," said Cradock; “ but it sounds very wel.
When do we open-I mean, when do we begin?”
Monday morning, sir, at ten o'clock precisely. Let me see !
to-day is Friday. Perhaps it would be an accommodation to you
to have your salary paid weekly, until you draw by the quarter.
Now, remember, I rely upon you to promote my interest in every
vay consistent with honour.”

of you.
" Thank you,
“That you may do, most fully. I shall never forget your kind
confidence and your liberality.”
“You will have two young gentlemen, if not three, wholly under
your orders. Also a middle-aged gentleman, a sort of sleeping-
partner, will kindly attend pro tem., and show you the work expected
I myself shall be engaged, perhaps, during the forenoon,
in promoting the interests of the business in a most important
quarter. Now, be true to me, Newman-I take liberties, you see-
keep your subordinates in their place, and make them stick to work,
sir. And remember that one ounce of example is worth a pound of
precept. If you act truly and honestly by me, as I know you will,
you may look forward to a partnership at nó distant date. But
don't be over-sanguine, my dear boy; there is hard work before you.”
“And you will not find me shrink from it,” said Cradock, throwing
his shoulders back; “but we have not settled yet as to the amount
of the premium, or deposit, whichever it may be.”
To be sure. I quite forgot that incident. Thirty
guineas, I think you said, was all that would be convenient to you."
“No, Mr. Wibraham; I said twenty pounds ten shillings.”
Ah, yes, my mistake. I knew that there was an odd ten shil-
lings. Say twenty-five guineas. A mere matter of form, you know;
but one which we dare not neglect. It is not a premium ; simply
a deposit ; to be returned at the expiration of the first twelve
months. Will you send it to me by cheque? That, perhaps, would
be the more convenient form. It will save you from coming again.”
“I am sorry to say I cannot; for now I have no banker. Neither
can I by any means make it twenty-five guineas. I have stated to
you the utmost figure of my present census.”
Ah, quite immaterial. I am only sorry for your sake. The sum
will be invested. I shall hold it as your trustee. But, for the sake
of the books, merely to look well on the books, we must say twenty
guineas. How could I invest twenty pounds ten shillings?”
This appeared reasonable to Cradock, who knew nothing about
investment; and, after reflecting a minute or two, he replied as
follows:
“I believe, Mr. Wibraham, that I might manage to make it
twenty guineas. You said, I think, that my salary would be payable
weekly.
“ To be sure, my dear boy, to be sure. At any rate, until further
arrangements.
“ Then I will undertake to pay you the twenty guineas. Next
Monday, I suppose, will do for it?"
“Oh yes, Monday will do. But stop, I shall not be there on that
morning; and, for form's sake, it must be paid first. Let us say
Saturday evening. I shall be ready with a stamped receipt. Will
jo'i meet me here at six o'clock, as you did this evening ?”

with him most cordially, begging that mutual trust and amity might
in no way be lessened by his own unfortunate obligation to observe
certain rules and precedents.
In the highest spirits possible under such troubles as his were,
Crad strod away from Aurea Themis Buildings, and whistled to
black Wena, whom two of the most accomplished dog-stealers in
London had been doing their best to inveigle. Failing of skill—for
Wena was a deal too knowing—they at last attempted violence,
putting away their chopped liver and hoof-meat, and other baits
still more savoury, but not to be described too accurately. But, just
as Black George, having lifted her bodily by the nape of the neck,
was popping her into the sack tail foremost, though her short tail
was under her stomach, what did she do but twist round upon him,
in a way quite unknown to the faculty, and make her upper and
lower canines meet through the palm of his hand? Black George's
remark upon this occasion was too unparliamentary to be even
loosely reported; enough that he let her drop, in the manner of a
red-hot potato; and Blue Bill, who made a dash at her, took no
more than a scar on the wrist. Then she retreated to her step, and
fired a royal salute of howls, never ending, ever beginning, until her
master came out.
"Wena, dear," he said, for he always looked on the little thing as
an inferior piece of Amy," you are very tired, my darling ; the
pave-
ment has been too much for you. Sit upon my arm, pretty. We
are both going to make our fortunes. And then you shall walk in
silk attire, and siller hae to spare...
Wena nuzzled her nose into its usual place under Cradock's
shoulder, and growled if any other dog took the liberty of looking
at him. And so they got home, singing snug little songs to each
other upon the way; and they both made noble suppers on the
strength of their rising fortunes.
CHAPTER XXXVII. .
COALS COME DOWN.
THE following day was Saturday, and the young fellow spent great
part of it in learning the rules, the tables, and statistics of the coal
trade, so far as they could be ascertained from a sixpenny work
which he bought. Not satisfied with this, he went to the Geological
Museum, in Jermyn-street, and pored over the specimens, and laid
in a stock of carbonic knowledge that would have astonished
Clinkers and Jenny. When the building was closed at four o'clock
he hurried back to Mortimer-street, paid Mrs. Ducksacre for his

week's lodgings, and ran off to a pawnbroker's to raise a little money.
Without doing this, he would not be able to deposit the twenty
guineas ; so fast had his fifty guineas made themselves angelic
wings and flown to help the wretched.
Mr. Gill's shopman knew Cradock well, from his having been
there frequently to redeem some trifling articles for the poor folk
of Paradise Court, and felt some good-will towards him for his kind-
ness to the little customers. It increased the activity of his trade,
for most of the pledges were repledged or ever the week was out.
And of course he got the money for issuing another duplicate.
Hope there's nothing amiss, Mr. Newman,” said the pawn-
broker's assistant; " sorry to see you come here, sir, on your own
account.”
Oh, you ought to congratulate me,” returned Cradock, with a
knowing smile; “I am going to pay a premium, and enter into a
good position upon advantageous terms; very advantageous, I may
say, seeing how little I know of the coal trade.”
“Take care, sir, take care, I beg of you. People run down our
line of business, and call it coining tears, &c. ; but you may take
my word for it, there is a deal more roguery in the coal trade, or
rather in the sham of it, than ever there is in the broking way.”
“ There can be none in the present case, for the simple reason
that I am not in any way committed to a partnership, neither am I
lo be at all dependent upon the profits.” And Cradock looked
thankful for advice, but a deal too wise to want it.
“Well, sir, I hope it may be all right; for I am sure you deserve
it. But there is a man, not far from here, I think you took some
things out for him, by the name of Zakey Jupp; a shrewdish
sort of fellow, though a deal too fond of fighting. He'll be up to
some of the coal tricks, I expect, he's about in the yards so much ;
and the whippers and heavers are good uns to talk, and he knows
all the genuine dealers. Don't you think it beneath you, sir, to con-
sult with Zachy Jupp, if you have the pleasure of his acquaintance.”
“I am proud to say that I have at last,” replied Cradock, smiling
grimly; "but he went on board the Industrious Maiden, at Nine
Elms, yesterday morning, and may not be back for a month. He
wanted me to go with him ; but I did not see how to be useful, and
had not given my landlady notice. Now, if you please, I have not
a moment to spare.”
The shopman saw that he could not, without being really imper-
tinent, press his advice any further; and, although Cradock was so
communicative, as young men are apt to be, especially about their
successes, he never afforded much temptation to any one for im-
pertinence.
“And how much upon them little articles ?" was the next question
put to Cradock; and he did not ask any very high figure, for fear
of not getting them out again.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
As he set off at full speed for Aurea Themis Buildings, without in-
viting Wena, it struck him that it would be but common prudence
just to look at the place of business ; so he dashed aside out of
Oxford-street, at the rate of ten miles an hour-for he was very
light of foot-and made his way to Howard-crescent, whose position
he had learned from the map. Sure enough there it was, when he
got to the number indicated. And what a noble plate! So large,
indeed, that it was absolutely necessary to have it in two parts.
What refulgent brass! What fine engraving, especially on the
lower part ! You might call it chalco-illumination, chromography,
chromometallurgy; indeed there can be no word half grand enough
to describe it. And the legend itself so simple, how could they have
made so much of it? The upper plate, though beautifully bright,
was comparatively plain, and only carried the words, “Wibraham,
Fookes, and Co. ;" the lower and far more elaborate part enabled
the public to congratulate itself upon having the above as “Coal
Merchants and Colliery Agents to her Most Gracious Majesty and
the Duchy of Lancaster. Hours of Business, from Ten till Four.”
Cradock just took time to read this, by the light of the gas-lamp
close to it; then glanced at the house (which looked clean and smart,
though smaller than what he expected), and, feeling ashamed of
his mean suspiciousness, darted away towards Notting Hill. When
he came to Aurea Themis Buildings, he was kept waiting at the
door so long that it made him quite uneasy, lest Hearty Wibraham
should have forgotten all about his little deposit. The sum was so
paltry to these rich people ; and he should not have insulted them
by being so over-punctual.
At last the smart girl opened the door, and a short young man,
whose dress more than whispered that he was not given to com-
promise his æsthetic views, came out with a bounce, and clapped a
shilling in the hand of the smiling damsel. “There Polly, get a
peach-coloured cap-ribbon, and wear it in a true knot for my sake.
I fancy I've done your governor. He's a trifle green ; isn't he ?”
But, in spite of his conversational powers, the handmaid dismissed
him summarily, when she saw Cradock waiting there.
The gas in the drawing-room was lit this time, and a good fire
burning; and Mr. Wibraham, in spirits absolutely jocular, sprang
forward to meet Cradock, and cried, “ Hail ! oh future partner!”
Then he offered him a glass of “rare old Madeira ;" and, producing
a blank receipt form, exclaimed, “Whatever you do, my young
friend, never let it be known in the counting-house that I accepted
you with so ridiculous a deposit as the sum of thirty guineas.”
“ Twenty, Mr. Wibraham, twenty was what you agreed to accept.”
Poor Cradock trembled from head to foot, lest even now, at the last
moment, he should be rejected. But, to his delight, his new prin-
cipal replied,
"Then, sir, twenty be it : if in a weak moment I agreed. Hearty

Wibraham would rather throw up all his connexion than allow any
man to say of him, sir, that he had departed from his word.”
His voice trembled slightly, and there was a twinkle as of tears
in his eyes. Crad began to apologize, though he could not quite
see what harm he had done.
“ Dash it, my boy, not another word. We understand each other.
There is your receipt.”
In his confidence, Hearty Wibraham passed the receipt form,
now filled up, to the aspiring coal-merchant, without having seen so
much as the colour of his money. Then Cradock pulled out Amy's
purse, in which he had put the cash, for good luck, and paid his
footing bravely.
“Sir, I will not thank you,” said Mr. Wibraham, as he took the
money, because the act would not be genuine. And I am proudly
able to declare that I have never yet done any thing, even for the
sake of the common courtesies of life, which has not been thoroughly
genuine. My boy, this paltry twenty guineas is the opening of your
mercantile life. May that life be prosperous; as I am sure you
deserve.”
Cradock took another glass of Madeira, as genuine as its owner,
and, after a hearty farewell, felt so rapidly on the rise, so touched,
for the first time of many weeks, by the dexter wand of fortune, that
he bought a quarter of an ounce of bird's-eye with an infusion of
“ Latakia” (grown in the footpath field at Mitcham), and actually
warmed his dear brother's pipe, which had not once been on the
glow, ever since the sacred fire of the Prytaneum quenched itself.
Wena was overjoyed to see him, and she loved the smell of
tobacco, and had often come sniffing about on the hearth-rug (or
the bit of felt that served for it) to know whether it was true that a
big man—a mastiff of a man, they told her—had succeeded in
abolishing it. low, ing the blue curls quivering nicely, she
jumped upon his lap; and, although she was rather heavy, he
thought it would be practice towards the nursing of Amy, and
possibly Amy's children. Then, when he thought of that, he grew
more happy than fifty emperors.
Fortune may jump on a young fellow's heart, with both heels set
together ; but, the moment she takes one off, up comes the heart,
like a bladder too big to go into the football.
On Monday morning, at ten o'clock, our Crad, in a state of large
excitement, appeared before the gorgeous plate, and rang the bell
thereover. It was answered by an office-boy, with a grin so intensely
humorous that it was worth all the guineas that could have been
thrust into the great mouth he exhibited.
“Mr. Newman ?" asked the boy, with a patronizing air, which a
little mind would have found offensive.
“Yes, my boy,” replied Cradock; “I suppose I am expected.”
That you are," said the humorous boy, grinning harder than

ever ; “the other three gents is waiting, sir. Get you a penny paper
for three halfpence.”
“ Thank you," answered Cradock, hoping to depress that boy, “I
am not come here, my boy, to read the penny papers."
“Oh no! oh lor no," cried the boy as he led the way in ; "tip-top
business this is, and all of us wears out our marrow-bones. His
Ro-oyal Highness will be here bumbye. 'Spect they'll appoint you
to receive him, 'cos you would look such a swell with our governor's
best boots on. Don't you refoose now, mind me, don't refoose,
mate, if
you
loves me.”
You want a little whipcord,” said Cradock; "and you shall have
it too, young man, if you come too near me.”
“There now; there now !” sighed the boy–who would have been
worth something on the stage-"I have never been appreciated, and
suppose I never shall. What's the odds to a jinker?" Cockalocks,
there go in, and let me mind your beaver.”
Cradock was shown into a room furnished as philosophically as
the wash-house of Cincinnatus; still, it looked like business. There
was no temptation to sit down, even though one had rowing-trousers
There were four tall desks of deal uncovered; each had four
legs, and resembled a naked Punch-and-Judy box. Hales, the
Norfolk giant, could not have written at either of them, while sitting
on any of the stools there.
Three of these desks were appropriated by three very nice young
gentlemen, all burning to begin thei: labours. Two of the men
were unknown to Cradock; but the third, the very short one, who
had taken a stool to stand upon, and was mending a pen most
earnestly-him Cradock recognized at once as the disburser of the
shilling, the sanguine youth, of broad views in apparel, who had
cheated Mr. Wibraham so.
“Mr. Fookes, I presume," he exclaimed, with a leap from the
stool, and a little run towards Cradock; you see we are all ready,
sir, to receive the junior partner. Hardly know what to be up to."
I am sure I cannot tell you," answered Crad, with a smile ; "I
do not belong to the firm as yet, although I am promised a partner-
ship at a date not very distant."
So am I," said the little man, staring ; "indeed, I came up
from Cambridge principally upon the strength of it."
“The deevil you did !” cried a tall, strapping fellow, crossing
suddenly from his desk; "if ye'll hearken me, my time comes first.
The agrahment was signed for Candlemas, when the gloot of busi-
ness allows it. And a Durham man knows what coals are."
Agrayment, thin, is it?” exclaimed the fourth, a flourishing, red-
haired Irishman; do

the same token, it's meself as is foremost. Christmas is the time,

sthipend in the intherim. Divil take me sowl, but none o' ye shall
git before Manus O'Toole."
“ Gentlemen,” said Cradock, “don't let us be in a hurry. No
doubt Mr. Fookes will be here presently, and then we can settle
precedence. I see there is work set out for us ; and I suppose we
are not all strangers here.”
“Can't answer for the other gentlemen," returned the little Cam-
bridge man," but I was never here before, except to see the place
on Saturday.”
" And that's joost my own predeecament,” cried the tall man from
Hatfield Hall.
“Chop me up smarl," said the Irishman, when they turned to
him as their senior, “but the gintleman has the advantage o' me.
I never was here at all, at all; and I hope I niver shall be."
The four young men gathered round a desk, and gazed sadly at
one another. At this moment the office-boy, seeing the distance
safe, for he had been watching through the keyhole, pushed his head
in at the door, and shouted, “Hi! there, juvenile coal-merchants
don't yer sell too much now! Telegram from the Exchange, gents ;
grimy is on the rise. But excoose me half an hour, gents; her
Majesty have commanded my presence, to put the ro-oyal harnis on
me. Ho-hoop! I'm after you, Molly. Don't be afraid of my
splashing your legs, dear."
Well,” said Cradock, as the rising young coal-merchants seemed
to look to him for counsel, and stood in silent bewilderment—"this
looks rather queer. However we can do nothing better than stop,
and see the matter out. I trust that none of you gentlemen have
paid a premium, as I have.”
“I am sure I don't know," said the Cantab, “what the others
have done; but I was allowed to enter the firm for the sum of
eighty guineas, a great deal too little, considering all the advantages
offered—the proper sum being a hundred; but an abatement was
made in my favour.”
Ahty guineas !" cried the Durham man; “why I was admeeted
for saxty, because I had no more."
“It's me blessed self, then, as bates you all," shouted the son of
Dublin ;
“shure and I've made a clear sixty by it, for I had no
more than forty."
And I," replied Cradock, with a melancholy air, was received
for the trifling sum of twenty, on account of my being an Oxford man.”
“Why, gentlemen,” said the little Cantab, “let us shake hands
all round. We represent the four chief universities, only Scotland
and London omitted."
“Catch a Scotchman with salt, me frinds !” cried the red
Hibernian, as they went through the ceremony. “By Jasers, but
that infernal old Jew would have had to pay the porridge-man, for
the pleasure of his company.”

“ Now let us see what we have here,” said Cradock, with his
gentle smile; “ we must not be in too much of a llurry, although
I'm afraid we are horribly choused. Gentlemen, look at your desks,
if you please. I was told to act for our principal, during the absence
of the sleeping partner ; to keep you ail in your places, and make
you stick to your work; and especially to remember that one ounce
of practice is worth a pound of precept.”
"I should be most happy to obey your orders,” said the little
Cambridge man, bowing; “only I hold the identical commission,
ounce of practice and all, for your benefit, my good sir, and that of
all the other juniors.”
“Now that shows a want of vareaty," cried the tall Dunelmian,
“for the sole charge of all of ye is commeeted to my poor self.”
“It's me blessed self that got it last, and that manes to kape
it. What time wur you there, gintlemen, at Ory Thamis Build-
ings ?”
It was settled that the Irishman had received his commission
last, for, some whisky having been produced, he and Hearty
Wibraham had kept it up until twelve o'clock on the Saturday
night. So, to his intense delight, he was now appointed captain.
“An' if I don't drag him from his hole, to pay him the sixty
guineas I owe him, out of your money, gintlemen, say my name isn't
Manus O'Toole. Now the fust arder I give, is to have in the bhoy,
and wallop him.”
Easier said than done, Mr. Toole. There was no boy to be found
any where ; and the only result of a strong demonstration in the
passage was a curt note from the landlord.
“GENTLEMEN,-I understood as I had lett my rooms to a
respectable party, rent payable weakly, and weak is up this day.
Will take it a favior to reseeve two pound ten per bearer.
“ JOHN CODGER.”
The four university men looked wondrously blank at this
“ gelidusque per ima cucurrit ossa tremor.”
"Well, I am blowed !" cried the little Cantab, getting smaller,
and with the sky-blue stripes on his trousers quivering.
“ There's a cousin of mine, a soleecitor," said the young north
countryman, “ would take up this case for us, if we made a join ;
deposeet."
" Have down the landlord and fight him," proposed the Emerald
Islander.
“I don't care a fig for the landlord,” said Cradock, who now
recalled some shavings of law from the Quarter Sessions spoke-
shave; "he can do nothing at all to us, until twelve o'clock, and
then he can send us about our business, and no more harm done.
We were not parties to the original contract, and have nothing to
do with the rent. Now, gentlemen, there is only one thing I would
ask you, in return for my lucid legal opinion.”

6 What is that?" cried all the rest; “ whatever it is, you shall
have it."
“That you make over to me, in toto, your three-fourths of that
brass-plate. I have taken a strange fancy to it; the engraving is
so fine."
“You are perfectly welcome to it,” exclaimed the other three ;
“ but won't it belong to the landlord ?”
“Not if it is merely screwed on, as probably is the case. And
I have a screw-driver in my knife, which very few screws
resist.”
“ Then go and take it, by all means, before twelve o'clock; aſter
that we shall only be trespassers.”
Crad put his hat on and went out, but returned with the wonder-
ful screw-driver snapped up into his knife-handle, and the first flush
of real British anger yet seen upon his countenance. What marvel-
lous beings we are ! He had lost nearly all his substance, and he
was vexed most about the brass-plate.
“Done at every point,” he said ; "that glorious under-plate is
gone,
and only the narrow bar left with the name of the thief upon
it, which of course would not suit him again."
Oysters all round !” cried the Cambridge man; for the natives
had not yet been “ cultivated” into non-existence. “An oyster is a
legal esculent; I see they teach law at Oxford ; let us at least die
jolly. And I claim the privilege of standing oysters, because I have
paid the highest premium, and am the most promising partner-at
any rate, the softest fellow. Gentlemen, if you refuse me, I claim
our captain's decision. Captain O'Toole, how is it?”
Arrah, thin, and I order eysters at this gintleman's expinse,
London stout for the waker stomiks, and a drop o'poteen for diges-
tion, to thein as are wakest of all.”
Done,” said the little Cantab, “ if only to rile the landlord, and
he may distrain the shells. Call four university men, by iinpli-
cation, unrespectable parties ! We must have our action against
him. Gentlemen, I am off for the grub, and see that I get in again.”
“ Faix, then, my honey," cried the Irishman, forgetting all univer-
sity language, “and, if ye don't, 'twill be a quare job for the bones
on the knuckles of Manus O'Toole.”
While all four were enjoying their oysters—for Cradock, being a
good-natured fellow, did not withhold his assistance-a sharp rap-
rap announced the postman, and Mr. O'Toole returned from the
door with a large square letter, sealed with the coat of arms of the
coinpany. Ship-letther, and eightpence to pay, begorra. Gintle-
men, will we take it?”
“ How is it addressed ?" asked two or three.
'Most gintaal. “To the sanior clerk or junior partner of the firm
of Wibraham, Fookes, and Co., Coal Merchants; and that's meself,
if it's nobody.”

“Then it's you to pey the eightpence,” cried the Durham man.
“Do yer think, then, it's me who can't do it?" answered Mr.
O'Toole, angrily. And then he broke open the letter and read :
“P. & 0. steamer Will o'the Wisp, off the Start Point.-Sunday.

entrusted me with the whole arrangements, and the entire supply
of coal, with no restriction except that the Nile shall not be set on

“Interested as you are in the success of our noble firm, you will
thank, instead of blaming me, for an apparently unceremonious
departure. By an extraordinary coincidence, Mr. Fookes has also
been summoned peremptorily to Constantinople, to contract with

time, deposited in the Bosporus.
Therefore, gentlemen, the entire interest of the London branch
is left in your experienced hands. Be steady, I entreat you ; be
diligent, be methodical. Above all things, remember that rigid
probity, and the strictest punctuality in meeting payments, are the
very soul of business, and that an ounce of practice is worth a
pound of precept. But I have the purest confidence in you. I need
not appeal to the honour of four university men. From my child-
hood upward, I have admired those admirable institutions, and the

credit is unbounded. Push our united interests, for I trust you to

“Raw Irishman! Oh then the powers! And the punch of the
head I never giv' him, a week ago next Saturday." "Mr. O'Toole
danced round the room, caught up the desks like dolls, and dashed
all their noses together. Then he summoned the landlord, and
pelted him out of the room and up the stairs with oyster-shells, the
books, and the whisky-bottle, and two pewter-pots after his legs, as
he luckily got round the landing-place. The terrified man, and his
wife worse frightened, locked themselves in, and then threw up a
window and bawled out for the police.
Cradock, feeling ashamed of the uproar, seized O'Toole by the
collar; and the Durham man, being sedate and steady, grasped him
on the other side. So they lifted him off the ground, and bore him
even into Hyde Park, and there they left him upon a bench, and
each went his several way. Thus did our great universities vindi-
cate their intelligence; and the police, according to precedent, were
in time to be too late.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
DOWN AMONG THE DEAD MEN.
CRADOCK NOWELL shivered hard, partly from his cold, and partly
at the thought of the poverty before him. He had Amy's five and
sixpence left, an immutable peculium. In currency his means were
limited to exactly four and ninepence. With the accuracy of an
upright man (even in smallest matters), he had forced upon Mr.
O'Toole his twopence, the quaternary of that letter. Also he had
insisted upon standing stout, when thirst increased with oysters.
Now he took the shillings four, having lost all faith in his destiny,
and put one in each of his waistcoat pockets; for he had little
horse-shoes upwards, as well as the straight chinks below. This
being done, he disposed of his ninepence with as tight a view to
security.
All that day he wandered about, and regretted Issachar Jupp.
Towards nightfall he passed a railway terminus, miserably lighted,
a disgrace to any style of architecture, teeming with insolence,
pretence, dirt, discomfort, fuss, and confusion. Let us call it the
“ Grand Junction Wasting and Screwing Line ;" for no line then
can appropriate a name universally applicable.
In a window, never cleaned since the prorogation of Parliament,
the following “ Notice” tried to appear; and, if you rubbed the
glass, you might read it.

tion. His duties will not be onerous. Wages one pound per week.

Uniform allowed. Apply to Rotten Sleeper, Esquire, next door to
the booking-office."
Cradock read this three times over, for his wits were growing dull;
and then he turned round, and felt whether all his money was safe.
Yes, every blessed halfpenny, for he had eaten nothing since the
oysters.
Surely I am an active young man, of good education,” said
Crad to himself, “ although not very smart, perhaps, especially as
to my boots; but a suit, all uniform, allowed, will cure my chief
deficiency, I could live and keep Wena comfortably upon a pound
a week. I hope, however, that they cash up. Railway companies
do not care, of course, for reputation. But I suppose they pay in
cases where they cannot help it.”
Having meditated with himself thus much, he went, growing
excited on the way-for who can be a philosopher upon four and
ninepence ?—to the indicated whereabouts of that line's factotum,
Mr. Sleeper. Here he had to wait very nearly an hour, Mr. Sleeper
being engaged, as usual, in the company's most active department,
arranging very effectually for a collision down the line.

fully," I would have said ; but, though the accident came off quite
according to the most sanguine, or sanguinary expectation, the
result was a slur on that company's fame; only three people being
killed, and five-and-twenty wounded.
“Now, young man," asked Mr. Sleeper, when all his instructions
were on the wires, “what is your business with me?”
Cradock, having stated his purpose, name, and qualifications, the
traffic-manager looked at him with interest and reflection. Then he
said impressively, “ You can jump well, I should think ?"
“I have never yet been beaten,” Crad answered; but of course
there are many who could do it."
“And run, no doubt? And your sight is accurate, and your
nerves very good ?"
“My nerves are not what they were, sir; but I can run fast and
see well."
“Why do you shiver so ? That will never do. And the muscles
of his calf are too prominent. We lost No. 6 through that.”
“ It is only a little cold I have caught. It will go off in a moment
with regular work.”
“ You have no relation, I suppose, in any way connected with the
law? No friend, I mean, of litigious tendencies ?”
I have no friends whatever; none, I mean, in London,
only one family, far in the country, to care at all about me.”
" No father or mother of any importance? No wife to prevent
your attending to business ?”
No, sir, nothing of the sort. I am quite alone in the world ;
and my life is of no importance.”
“Wonderful luck," muttered Mr. Sleeper ;“exactly the very thing

such a reputation. Poor Morshead cannot get through the work
any longer by himself. And the coroner made such nasty remarks,

"Young man,” he continued in a louder tone,“ you are in luck this
time, I believe. It is a very snug situation; only you must look
sharp after your legs, and be sure you never touch spirits. Not
given to blue ruin, I hope ?”
I never touch it."
“That's right. I was afraid you did, you look so down in the
mouth. You can give us a reference, I suppose ?”
“Yes, to my landlady, Mrs. Ducksacre, a most respectable per-
son, in trade in Mortimer-street."
"Good,” replied Mr. Sleeper ; "you mustn't be alarmed, by the
way, by any foolish rumours you may hear as to dangers purely
imaginary. Your predecessor lost his life through the very grossest
carelessness. You are as safe there as in your bed, unless your
nerves happen to fail you. And, when that is the case, I should
like to know," asked the traffic-manager indignantly, which of us
is not in danger, even in coming down-stairs ?”
“What will my duties be, then ?” asked Cradock, with some
surprise.
Why, you are not afraid, are you ?” Mr. Sleeper looked at him
contemptuously.
“No, I should rather hope not,” replied Cradock, meeting him
eye to eye, so that the wholesale smasher quailed at him ; "there
is no duty, even in a powder-mill, which I would shrink from now.”
“Ah, terrible things, those powder-mills ! A perfect disgrace to
this age and country, their wanton waste of human life. How the
Legislature lets them go on so, is more than I can conceive.

“She's all right, sir ; jumped over three carriages, and went a
header into a sand-hill. Driver cased in glass, from vitrifaction of

our sake. The Company can't have another inquest for at least six
months. I mean, of course, by that fool of a coroner. Confound
that fellow; he will not take a right view of things. At eight o'clock
to-morrow morning, you will be at the gate of the Cramjam goods
station. The clerk there will have his orders about you. He will
supply you with a book, and map out for you your duties. Also
Morshead, your mate, an invaluable man, will show you the practical
part of it. Now good-bye, my lad. Remember, you never wear
any except your official dress. We allow you two suits in the
twelvemonth. Your duties will be of a refined character, and the
exercise exhilarating. I trust to receive a good report of you ; and
I hope, my boy, that you are at peace, both with God and man.”
Even Mr. Sleeper had been touched a little by Cradock's air of
uncomplaining sorrow, and the stamp of high mind and good
breeding
“Very foolish of me,” he muttered, as he lit his cigar, and went
up to telegraph to the Slayham station-master-Commit yourself
to nothing ; observe the strictest economy; look first to the engine;
allow no bonfires of splinter-wood, such as you had last week ’-
very foolish of me,” he said on the stairs,“ but it goes to my
heart
to kill that young fellow. How I should like to know his history !
That face does not mean nothing."
Cradock, caring very little what his duties might be, and feeling
the night-wind go through his heart, hastened to the outfitters', and
there he was received with a grin by an experienced shopman, on
the production of his note.
“Capital customers, sir," he said ; "famous customers of ours,
that Grand Junction Wasting and Screwing Line, and the best of
all for the gentlemen in your way of business, sir. Must have new
clothes every new hand, and they changes pretty often, sir. Pervides

all the comforts of a home for you, and a gentlemanly competence,
before you've been half a year with them.”
The man grinned still more at his own grim wit, while Cradock
stared at him in wonderment.
“ Don't you see, sir, they can't pass the clothes on, after the man
has been killed, even if there's a bit of them left ; for they must fit
you like your skin, sir. The leastest little wrinkle, sir, or the ruffle
of a hinch, or so much as the fray of a 'em, and there you are, sir;
and they have to look for another hactive young man, sir. And
hactive young men are getting shy, sir, uncommon shy of it now,
except they come from the country. Hope you insured your life,
sir, before taking the situation. There's no company will accept
your life now, sir. What a nice young man the last were,—what a
nice young man, to be sure ! outrageous fond of filberts; till they
cracked him, and found a shell for him.”
“Well,” said Cradock, whom the busy tailor had been measuring
all this while, “from all that you tell me, I had better go and order
my coffin than to-morrow's dinner. What is there so very dangerous
in it ?"
“Well, you'll see, sir, you'll see, if you lives. Hitch your pants a
wee bit up, sir. I would not frighten you for the world, because it's
all up in a moment, if you lose your presence of mind. Thank you,
sir ; all right now, except the calves of the tights, and that's the
most particular part of it all. May I trouble you to turn your
trousers up ? It will never do to measure over them. We shall
put six hands on at once at the job. The whole will be ready at
eleven this evening. You must kindly call and try every thing.
We are ordered to insist upon that. It always tells so with the
jury."
The next morning, Crad, in a suit of peculiar, tough, and yet most
elastic cord, which fitted him as if he had been dipped in it, walked
in at the open gates of the front yard, leading to the Cramjam
general goods terminus. This was the only way in or out (except
along “the metals”), and, so haughtily frowned it with ginger-
bread stucco, that all the porters were proud of it, and called it
a "slap-up harch-way."
Stop, stop," cried a sharp little fellow, gurgling up, like a foun-
tain, from among the sham pilasters; “what's your business here,
iny man, on the premises of the Grand Junction Wasting and
Screwing Company ? Ah, I see by your togs. Just come this way,
if you please, my man.”
Here, having only a train to start, which goes at its own con-
venience, there is time for a prolix explanation, that the more
fashionable of the railway companies have lately agreed that a
station-yard is a sort of royal park, which cannot be kept too private,
which no doors may rashly open upon, a pleasant rural solitude and
weed-nursery for the neighbourhood, and wherein the senior porter

has his private mushroom-bed. They are wise in this seclusion, and
wholesome in their privacy, so long as they have their own absolute
way, so long as they are allowed to swindle us, and jabber about
"public interests.” Perhaps, ere very long, we shall have a modern
Dædalus; and then the boards of directors, so ready to do collec-
tively things which, done individually, would compel a gentleman
to cut his throat, may awake from some snores of complacency, and
rout up their thieves of lawyers, and learn that a gentleman's honour
cannot exist with a limited liability.
Cradock, in no wise overwhelmed by the “compo” arch (about
half the size of the stone one at Nowelhurst Hall's chief entrance),
went straight up to the sharp little fellow, and told him what he was
come for.
“Glad to hear it," said the gateman, “uncommonly glad to hear
it. Morshead is a wonderful fellow; there is not another man in
England could have stuck to that work as he has done. He ought
to have five pounds a week, that he ought, instead of a single
sovereign. Screwing Co.” (this was their common name) “ will be
sorry when they have lost him. Now your duty is to enter, in this
here book, the number of every truck, jerry, trod, or blinkem, tar-
paulin, or covering of any sort; also the destination chalked on it,
and the nature of the goods in the truck, so far as you can ascertain
them; coals, iron, chalk, packing-cases, boxes, crates, what not, so
fast as they comes into the higher end, or so fast as they goes out
of it. You return this book to the check office every time you come
off duty. You begin work at eight in the morning, and you leave at
eight in the evening. You don't pass here meanwhile, and you can't
pass up the line. Hope you have brought some grub. You'll have
five minutes in the afternoon, long enough to get a snack in, after
the up goods for Millstone is off. Oh, you ought to have brought
some grub; if you faint, you will never come to again. But perhaps
Morshead can spare you a bit. He'll be glad to see you, that's
certain, for he ain't slept a wink for a week. And such a considerate
chap. I enter you in and out. 'Number-taker 26. That's all
right from your cap, my lad. No room for it on your sleeve. Might
stick out, you know, and you must pack tighter than any of the
goods is. Undertakers, we call you always. Good-bye, sir;
Morshead will tell you the rest, and I hope to see you all right at
eight P.M. The first day is always the worst. Go in at that door
by the Pickford, and ask the first porter you see for Morshead, and
take care how you get at him."
Morshead was resting for a moment upon a narrow piece of
planking, amid a regular Seventy Dials of sidings, points, and turn-
tables. Cradock could scarcely see him, for trucks and vans and
boxes on wheels were gliding past in every direction, thick as the
carts on London Bridge, creaking, groaning, ricketing, lurching ;
thumping up against one another, and then recoiling with a heavy

kick, straining upon coupling-chains, butting against bulkheads,
staggering and jerking into grooves and out of them, crushing flints
into a shower of sparks, doing any thing and every thing except
standing still for a moment. And among them rushed about, like
dragons-ramping, and routing, and swearing fearfully, gargling
their throats with a boiling riot, and then goring the ground with
ļusks of steam, whisking and flicking their tails, and themselves,
in and out at the countless crosswebs, screaming, and leaping, and
rattling, and booming—the great ponderous giant goods-engines.
Every man was out-swearing his neighbour, every truck browbeat-
ing its fellow, every engine out-yelling its rival. There is nothing
on earth to compare with this scene, unless it be the jostling and
churning of ice-packs in Davis's Straits, when the tide runs hard,
and a gale of wind is blowing, and the floes have broken up sud-
denly. And even that comparison fails, because, though the mon-
sters grind and crash, and labour and leap with agony, they do not
roar, and vomit steam, and swear at one another.
At the risk of his life, for as yet he knew nothing of the laws that
governed their movements-a very imperfect code, by-the-by-
Cradock made his way to the narrow staging where Morshead was
taking a breathing-time. His fellow " number-taker” of course
descried him coming ; for he had acquired the art of seeing all
round, as a spider is falsely supposed to do. He knew in a moment,
by Cradock's dress, what business he was meant for ; and he said
to himself, “ Thank God !” in one breath, for the sake of his wiſe
and family ; and “Oh, poor fellow !" in the next, as he saw how
green the youth was. Then he held up his hands for Cradock to
stop, and waved them for him to run; and so piloted him to the
narrow knife-board,“ where a man's life was his own a'most.”
The highest and noblest of physical courage is that which, fully
perceiving the danger, looking into the black pit of death, and
seeing the night of horrors there, without either fatalism or deep
religion to strengthen it, encounters them all, treads the narrow cord
daily, not for the sake of honour or fortune; not because of
the dash in it, and the excitement to a brave soul; not even to win
the heart's maiden, that pearl of romance and mystery : but simply
to supply the home, to keep in flow the springs of affection, whence
the geyser heat is gone-to support and comfort (without any com-
fort from them) the wife, whose beauty has passed away, and who
now is an unattractive scold, as well as the children, whose sole idea
of daddy is--a halfpenny.
This glorious inglorious courage, grander than any that ever won
medal or cross for slaughtering, had a little home-though he knew
it not, and never thought about it-in the broad, but sinewy bosom
of simple Stephen Morshead. None but himself knew his narrow
escapes; an inch the wrong way and he was a dead man, fifty times
2 day. And worst of all in the night, in the foggy time of night, and

yet more in the first gleam of morning, when the body was worn out,
and dreams came over the eyes, but were death if they passed to
the brain, and the trucks went by, like nightmares—that very morn-
ing he had felt, after taking duty night and day for more than a
week, since they killed his partner, he had felt that his Sally must
be a widow, and his seven children orphans, if another night went
over him without some relief of sleep.
That every word of this is true, many a poor man would avouch
{if he only had time and the money to read it, and were not afraid);
but few rich men can really find the time to think about it.
Stephen Morshead was astonished at seeing that his mate was
come. None of the men in the goods' station would have any thing
to do with it. 'It was very well to be up in the trucks, or upon the
engines, or even to act as switchman, for you had a corner inviolable,
and could only do mischief to others. But to run in and out, and
through and through, in that perpetual motion, to be bound to jot
down every truck, the cover, and contents of it, entering or departing
from that crammed and crowded terminus, to have nobody to help
you therein, and nobody to cry“ dead man” if you died, and the
certainty that if you stood a hair's-breadth out of the perpendicular,
or a single wheel had a bunion, you with the note-book in your hand
must flood the narrow 'tween ways, and find your way out under-
neath to heaven; all this, and the risk of the fearful jumps from
one sliding train to another, sliding oppositely, and jerking, perhaps,
as you jumped; and yet if you funked the jump you must be
crushed, like a frog beneath a turf-beater: these considerations,
after many pipes were smoked over them, had induced all the
porters and stokers to dwell on the virtues of the many men killed,
and to yield to their wives' entreaties, acquiesce in their sixteen
shillings, nor aspire to the four shillings Charon-fare.
“Now," said Morshead, “shake hands with me," as Cradock,
breathless with running wonder, leapt upon the nine-inch gangway.
“I see you belongs to a different horder of society; obliged to keep
my eyes open, mate; but, as long as you and I works together, I
ask it as a favour of you, to shake hands night and morning.”
“With the greatest pleasure,” said Cradock,“ if you think there's
room for our funny-bones.”
“Ha! ha!” laughed Morshead," you are the right sort for it.
Not a bit afeard, I see. Now I mustn't stop to talk; just follow me,
and do as I do. I can put you up to it in six hours; and then if
you can spare me for the other six, 'twill be the saving of the little
But tell the truth if you're tired. I should scorn myself if
harm came to you.”
“You are the bravest man I ever met,” said Cradock, with his
heart rising ; "you cannot expect me to be like you. But you shall
not find me a coward."
“I can see it by your eyes, lad. No sparkle, but a glowing like.

I can always tell by the eyes of a man how long he will last at this
work. Now come along o' me, and I'll show you the nine worst
crushing places.”
Cradock followed him through the threads—threads of Clotho
and Atropos-feeling the way with his legs, like a gnat who“
the posts” of a spider's web. In and out, with a jump here and
there, when two side-boards threatened to shear them, they got to
the gorge at the entrance, where the main turmoil of all was. The
Symplegades were a joke to it. And all because the Screwing
Company would not buy land enough to get elbow-room. There
are several lines of railway which do a much larger business; there
is no other which attempts to do so much upon less than four times
the acreage.
“ I've tottled all them as are going out,” Mr. Morshead informed
Cradock;
now you'll see how we enters them as they enters."
Laughing at his own very miserable joke, he leaped on the chains
of the passing waggons, and held up his hand for Cradock not to
attempt to do the same.
“ Takes a deal of practice that,” he cried, after he had crossed
the train; “it ain't like a passenger train, you know; and you must
larn when they are standing. I need not to have done it now, but
sometimes I be forced. Bide where you are; no danger unless they
comes with the flaps down.”
Then he jotted down, with surprising quickness, all the necessary
particulars of the train that was coming in. It happened to be an
easy one; for there were no tarpaulins at all, and it was not travel-
ling faster than about four miles an hour.
Some drivers there is,” said Morshead, as he rejoined Cradock
round the tail of the train, “who really seem to want to kill a fellow,
they come by at such a pace, without having any call for it. I be-
lieve they think, the low fools, that we are put as spies upon them,
and they would rather kill us than not.-Hold your tongue,” to a
man in a truck, who was interrupting his lecture; “ don't you know
better than to offer me that stuff? Never touch what they offers
you, sir. They means no harm, but you had safer take poison when
you be on duty. There is not much real danger just here, if a fellow
is careful, because the rails run parallo ; there is nothing round the
curve now, I see, and only two coming out, and both of they be
scored; it's a rare chance to show you the figures of eight, and slide-
points where the chief danger is. Show you where poor Charley
was killed last week, and how he did it."
Poor fellow ! Did he leave any family ?"
“Twelve in all. No man comes here, unless he be tired of his
life, or he be druv to it by the little ones.'
“And what did the Company do for them ?”
Oh, behaved most 'andsome for them. Allowed 'em two bob
a week for a twelvemonth to come-twopence apiece all round. But

my lad.”
they only did it to encourage me, for fear I should funk off. I have
seen out three mates now. Please God, I shan't see you out too,
If f you do, it shan't be from funk, Morshead. I rather like the
danger."
“ That's the worst thing of all,” replied Stephen; “I beg of you
not to say that, sir.”
A thoroughly brave man almost always has respect for order.
The bold man —which means a coward with jumps in him-gene-
rally has none. It was strange to see how Stephen Morshead, in all
that crush, and crash, and rattle, that swinging and creaking as of
the Hellespontic boat-bridge, mixed deference with his pity for
Cradock. He saw, from his face, and air, and manner, that he was
bred a gentleman. Shall we ever come-or rather the twentieth
generation come—to the time when every man of England (but for
his own fault) shall be bred and trained a gentleman in the true and
glorious sense of it ?
Cradock saw the fatal places, where the sleepers still were purple,
where danger ran in converging lines, where a man must stand
sideways, like a duellist, and with his arms in like a drill-sergeant's,
and not shrink an inch from the driving-wheels; where his size was
measured as for his coffin, and if he stirred he would want nothing
more. Then, if a single truck-flap were down, if an engine rollicked
upon the rail, if a broad north-country truck, overreaching, hap-
pened to be in either train, when you were caught between the two,
your only chance was to call on the Lord, and lie upon your side,
and straighten all your toes out.
And yet these were the very places where, most of all, the “
ber-taker" was bound to have his stand—where alone he could
contrive to check two trains at once. “Could they help starting
two trains at once?" poor Crad asked himself—for he had found no
time to ask it before—when, weary to the last fibre with the work
of the day, he fell upon his little bed, and could hardly notice Wena.
Perhaps they could not; it was more than he knew; only he knew
that, if they could, they were but wanton man-slaughterers.
After a deep sleep, all in his clothes, he awoke the next morning
quite up for his work, and Morshead, who had been on duty all
night, and whose eyes seemed made of adamant, only stayed for
an hour with him, and then, feeling that Crad was quite up to the
day-work, ran home and snored for ten hours, as loud as Phle-
gethon or Enceladus.
The most fearful thing, for a new hand, was, of course, the night-
work; and Stephen Morshead, delighted to have such a mate at
last, had begged to leave Cradock the day-spell, at least for the first
three weeks ; for to Stephen the moon was as good as the sun, and
sweet sleep fell like wool when plucked at, and hushed the tramping
steeds of the day-god. Only, for the sake of Stephen's eyes, on
num-

249
whose accuracy hung the life-poise, it was absolutely necessary not
to dilate the pupils by incessant night-work.
But Cradock never took night-work there; and the change came
about on this wise. Wena felt that she was wronged by his going
away from her every day so early in the morning, and not coming
home to her again till ever so late at night, and then too tired to
say a word, or perhaps he didn't care to do it. Like all females of
any value-unless they are really grand ones, and, if such there be,
please to keep them away-Wena grew jealous desperately. She
might as well be any body else's dog ; and the baker's dog was with
his master all day; and the butcher's lady dog, a nasty ill-bred
thing-the idea of calling her a lady !-why, even she was allowed,
though the selfish thing didn't care for it, unless there was suet on
his apron, to jump up at him and taste him, all the time he was
going for orders. And then look even at the Ducksacre dog, a
despicable creature—his father might have been a bull-terrier, or he
might have been a Pomeranian, or a quarter-bred Skye, or the
Lord knows who, very likely a turnspit, and his mother, oh ! the less
we say of her the better :-why, that wretched, lop-eared, split-
tailed thing, without an eye fit to look out of, had airs of his own;
and what did it mean, she would like to know, and she who had
formed some nice acquaintances, dogs that had been presented at
Court, and got Eau-de-Cologne every morning, and not a blessed
flea upon them? Why, it meant simply this : that Spot, filthy
plague-spot, was allowed to go out with the baskets, and made a
deal of by his owners, and might cock his tail with the best of
them, while she, black Wena, who had been brought up so dif-
ferently-
Here her feelings were too much for her, and she put down her
soft flossy ear upon the drugget-scrap, and looked at the door
despairingly, and howled until Mrs. Ducksacre was obliged to come
up and comfort her. Even then she wouldn't eat the dripping.
From that day she made her mind up. She would watch her
opportunity. What was the good of being endowed with such a
nose as she had, unless she could smell her master out, even
through the streets of London ? What did he wear such out-
landish clothes for ? Very likely on purpose to cheat her. Very
likely he was even keeping some other dog. At any rate, she would
know that, if it cost her her life to do it. What good was her life to
her now, or to any body else? Heigho !
On the following Saturday, when Cradock was gone to his fifth
day's work, what did Wena do, when Mrs. Ducksacre came up on
purpose to coax and make much of her, but most ungratefully give
her the slip, with a skill worthy of a better purpose, then scuttle
down the stairs, all four legs at once, in that clever style of bone-
slide which domestic dogs acquire. Miss Ducksacre ran out of the
shop at the noise-for this process is not a silent one; but she

66
could only cry,“ Oh, Lord !" as Wena, with the full impact of her
weight multiplied into her velocity; or, if that is wrong, with the
cube of her impetus multiplied into the forty-two stairs—bang she
came anyhow, back-foremost, against the young lady's—nay, you
there, I said, “ lower limbs”-and deposited her in a bushel of
carrots, just come from Covent Garden.
Stop her, Joe, for God's sake, stop her !” Miss Ducksacre cried
to the shop-boy, as well as she could for the tail of a carrot which
had gotten between her teeth.
“ Blowed if I can, miss,” the boy responded, as Wena nipped his
fingers for him ; the next moment she was free as the wind, and
round the corner in no time.
“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Polly Ducksacre, a buxom young lady,
with fine black eyes,
whatever will Mr. Newman think of us? It
will seem so unkind and careless; and he does love that dog so
unreasonably !"
Polly was beginning to entertain a tender regard for Cradock;
especially since he had shown his proportions in “them beautiful
buff pantaloons." What a greengrocer he would make, to be sure,
so hupright and so lordly like; and she'd like to see the man in the
“ Garden” who would tell her she had eaten sparrow-pie, if she
only had Mr. Newman to hold the basket for her.
By this time, Mrs. Ducksacre was come down the stairs, scream-
ing “Wena !” at the top of her voice the whole way; and out they
ran, boy and all, to search for her, while three or four urchins came
in, without medium of exchange, and filled cap, mouth, and pocket.
One brat was caught upon their return, and tied up for the day in
an empty potato-sack, and exposed, behind the counter, to universal
execration; in which position he took such n te of manner and
custom, time and place, that it was never safe for the Ducksacre
firm to dine together afterwards.
Meanwhile, that little black Wena, responsive and responsible to
none except her master, pursued the even tenor of her way, nosing
the ground, and asking many a question of the lamp-posts, as far as
the Cramjam Terminus, at least three miles from Mortimer-street.
The sharp little gate-clerk, animated with railway love of privacy,
ran out, and clapped his hands, and shouted "hoo” at Wena; but
she only buttoned her tail down, and cut across the compound. As
for the stone he threw at her, she caught it up in her mouth as it
rolled, and carried it on to her master.
There was Cradock, in the thick of it, standing on a narrow pile
of pig-iron, one of his chief fortalices; his book was in his hand,
and he was entering, as fast as he could, all the needful particulars
of a goods train sliding past him.
Creak, and squeak, and puff, and shriek,-Oh, what a scene,
thought Wena,-and the rattle of the ghostly chains, and the rush-
ing about, and the roaring. She lost her presence of mind in a

251
moment,-she always had been such a nervous dog-she tightened
her tail convulsively, and dropped her ears, while her eyes came
forth; and, glancing at the horrors on every side, she fled for dear
life from the evil to come.
The faster she fled, the more they closed round her. She had
not espied her master yet; she could not find the way back again ;
she was terrified out of all memory; and a host of frightful genii,
more sooty than Cocytus, and riding hideous monsters, were yelling
at her on every side, clapping black hands, and hooting. The dog
on the Derby course, when the race rushes round the corner, was in
a position of glory and safety compared to poor Wena's now.
Already the tip of her tail was crushed, already one pretty paw was
broken; for she had bolted in and out through the trains, truck-
bottoms, wheels, and driving-wheels. Oh, you cowards, to yell at
her! with black death grating and grinding upon her soft silky
back!
At last, she gave in altogether. They had hunted her to her grave.
Who may contend with destiny? She lay down under a moving
coal-train, and resigned herself to die. But first she must ask for
sympathy, although so unlikely to get it. She looked once more at
her wounded foot, and shivered and sobbed with the agony; and
then gave vent to one long low cry, to ask if no one loved a poor
dog there.
Cradock heard it, and started so that it was nearly all up with
him too. Thoroughly he knew the cry, wherein she had wailed for
Clayton. He flung down his book, and dashed to the place, and
there he saw Wena, and she saw him. She began to try to limp to
him, but he held up his hand to stop her ; disabled as she was,
she was sure to be caught by the wheel. Could she stay there, and
let the train pass her? No. At its tail was an empty horse-box,
almost scraping the ground, perfectly certain to crush her, Crying,
“Down, down, my poor darling!” he ran down the train, which was
travelling seven or eight miles an hour, seized the side of a truck,
and leaped, at the risk of his life, upon the fender in front of the
horse-box. Then he got astride of the coupling-chain, and kept his
right hand low to the ground, to snatch her up ere the crusher
came. Knowing where she was, he caught her by the neck the
instant the truck disclosed her, and, with a strong swing, heaved
her up into it. But he lost his balance in doing it, and fell side-
ways, with his head on the other coupling-chain. Stunned by the
blow, he lay there, only clinging by his right calf to the chain he
had sat astride upon. The first jerk of either chain, the first swing
of either carriage, and must be ground to powder.
Luckily for him and for Amy, Morshead was not gone home yet,
seeing more to do than usual. Missing his mate from the proper
place, he had run up in terror to look for him, when a man in a
truck, who had vainly been shouting to stop the coal-train's engine,

pointed and screamed to him where and what was doing. Morshead
jumped on the heap of pig-iron, and sideways thence on the board
of the truck just passing, as dangerous a leap as well could be, but
luckily that truck was empty. He jumped into the truck, a shallow
one, where poor Wena lay quite paralyzed, and, stooping over the
back with both arms, he got hold of Cradock's collar. Then, with
a mighty effort, he jerked him upon the tail-board, and lugged hin
in, and bent over him.
Wounded Wena crawled up, and begged to have her poor foot
looked at; then, obtaining no notice at all, she felt that Cradock
must be killed and dead, just as Clayton had been. Upon this
conclusion, she fetched such a howl, though it shook her sore tail
to do it, that the engine-driver actually looked round, and the train
was stopped.
When at last one of the heavy good-porters came home in the
cab with Cradock and Wena at the expense of the Company (which
was boasted of the next board-day)—when one of these came home
with Crad--for Morshead had double work again-Polly Ducksacre
went into strong hysterics, and it required two married men and a
boy to get her out of the potato-bin.
It was all up with poor Crad that night. The overwork of brain
and muscle, the presence of mind required all the time when his
mind was especially absent, the impossibility of thinking out any
of his trains of ideas when a train of trucks was upon him, the
native indignation of a man at knowing that his blood is meant to
ebb down a railway sewer, and a new broom will sweep him clean-
all these worries and wraths together, cogging into the mill-wheel
of cares already grinding, had made such a mill-clack in his head
near the left temple, where the thump was, that he could only roll
on his narrow bed at imminent risk of a floor-bump.
Then the cold, long harbouring, struck into his heart and reins;
and he knew not that Dr. Tink came, and was learned and
diagnostic upon him ; nor even that Polly Ducksacre took his feet
out of bed, and rubbed them until her wrists gave way; and then,
half ashamed of her womanhood, slunk away, and cried over
Wena.
Wena's foot was put into splinters, Wena's tail was stypticized ;
but no skill could save her master from a long impending fever.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
TWO TRYING VISITORS.
LEAVING the son on his narrow hard pallet, to toss and toss, and
turn and turn, with nobody to nurse him, let us see how the father
and folk at home were flourishing.
Sir Cradock Nowell sat all alone in his little breakfast-room,
soon after the funeral of his brother, and before Eöa came to him.
For the simple, hot-hearted girl fell so ill after she heard of her loss,
and recovered from the narcotic, that Biddy O'Gaghan, who got on
famously with the people at the “Crown,"would not hear of her being
moved yet, and drove Dr. Hutton all down the stairs,“ with a word
of sinse on the top of him,” when he claimed his right of attending
upon the child he had known in India.
That little breakfast-room adjoined Sir Cradock's favourite
study, and was as pretty a little room as he could have wished to
sit in. He had made pretence of breakfasting, but perhaps he
looked forward to luncheon, for not more than an ounce of food
had he swallowed altogether.
There he sat nervously, trying vainly to bring his mind to bear
on the newspaper. Fine gush of irony, serried antithesis, placid
assumption of the point at issue, then logic as terse and tight as
the turns of a three-inch screw-jack, withering indignation at those
who won't think exactly as we do, the sunrise glow of metaphor,
the moonlight gleam of simile, the sparkling stars of wit, and the
playful Aurora of humour-alas, all these are like water on a duck's
back when the heart won't let the brain work. If we cannot
appreciate their beauty, because our opinions are different, how can
we hope to do so when we don't care what any opinions are ?
It is all very well, and very easy, to talk about objectivity ; but a
really objective man the Creator has never shown us, save once ;
and even He withered up the fig-tree, and destroyed a herd of
swine, to show sympathy with our impatience.
And who knows but that it may be lest we deify the grand
incarnations of intellect—the Platos and the Aristotles, the Bacons
and the Shakspeares-that it has pleased the Maker of great and
small to leave us small tales of the great ones, mean anecdotes, low
traditions ; lest at any time we should be dazzled, and forget that
they were but sparkles from the dross of eternal heaven's anvil.
Oh vast and soaring intellects, was it that your minds flew higher
because they had shaken the soul off; or was it that your souls
grew sullen at the mind's preponderance ?
Fash we not ourselves about it, though we pay the consequence.
If we have no grand nuggets of intellect (as when the primitive
channel was delved) yet we gain, at any rate, a heavier average

CRADOCK NOWELL.
of washed-out stuff, from the cradle we were born in, the great gold-
hunter's cradle.
This is the only thing any good Briton ever thinks of nowadays.
All over the world we are scorned and kicked; what care we,
so long as our seat of honour is not too sore to go down on its
board, and be to the world the ninth part of a man—the cosmo-
politan tailor?
Nevertheless, Sir Cradock Nowell (being no Briton of the pre-
sent day, to abandon all rights joyfully) lay deep in the pot of
despondency; and, even worse than that, hung, jerked thereout
every now and then, by the flesh-hook of terror and nervousness.
How could he go kindly with his writer, when his breakfast would
not so with him ?
He was expecting Bull Garnet. Let alone all his other wearing
troubles, he never could be comfortable when he expected Bull
Garnet. At every step in the passage, every bang of a door, the
proud old gentleman trembled and fushed, and was wroth with
ſimself for doing so.
Then Hogstaff came in, and fussed about, and Sir Cradock was
fain to find fault with him.
“How careless you are getting about the letters, Hogstaff.
Later and later every morning! Wlrat is the reason that you never
now bring me the bag at the proper time?”
It was very strange, no doubt, of Job Hogstaff, but he could not
bear to be found fault with; and now he saw his way to a little
triumph, and resolved to make the most of it.
“Yes, Sir Cradock; to be sure, Sir Cradock; how my old head
is failing me! Very neglectful of me never to have brought the bag
to-day Then he turned round suddenly at the door, to which he
had been hobbling. “Perhaps you'd look the date, Sir Cradock,
of the paper in your hand, sir.”
Yesterday's paper, of course, Hogstaff. What has that to do
with it?"
Oh, nothing, sir, nothing, of course. Only I thought it might
have comed in the letter-bag. Perhaps it never does, Sir Cradock;
you knows best, as you takes it out.” Here old Job gave a quiet
chuckle, and added, as if to himself, “No, of course, it couldn't
have come in the letter-bag this morning, or master would never
have blowed me up for not bringing him the bag, as nobody else
got a key to it !"
“How stupid of me, to be sure, how excessively stupid!”
exclaimed Sir Cradock; with a sigh ; of course I had the bag, a
full hour ago ; and there was nothing in it but this paper. Job, I
beg your pardon.”
“And I hope it's good news you've got there, Sir Cradock, and
no cases of starvation; no baronet's heir found dead in the streets,
or drownded in the Serpentine. Anyhow, there's a many births, I

255
see, and a deal too many. Children be now such a plenty nobody
care about them.”
"Job, you quite forget yourself,” said his master, very grandly ;
but there came a long sigh after it, and Job was not daunted
easily.
“ And if I do, Sir Cradock Nowell, I'd sooner forget myself than
my children.”
Sir Cradock was very angry, or was trying to feel that he ought
to be so, when a heavy tread, quite unmistakable, and yet not so
firm as it used to be, shook the glazed tiles of the passage. That
step used to cry to the echoes, “ Make way; a man of vigour and
force is coming.” Now all it said was, “ Here I go; and am not in
a mood to be meddled with."
“Come in,” said Sir Cradock, fidgeting, and pretending to be up
for an egg, as Mr. Garnet gave two great thumps on the panel of
the door. Small as the room was, Job Hogstaff managed to be too
late to let him in.
Bull Garnet first flung his great eyes on the butler ; he had no idea
of
any fellows daring to skulk their duty. Old Hogstaff, who looked
upon Garnet as no more than an upper out-door servant, gazed back
with a long-practised obtuseness, and waved his napkin cleverly.
“ Please to put that mat straight again, Mr. Garnet. You kicked
it askew as you came in. And our master can't abide things set
crooked."
To Job's disappointment and wonder, Bull Garnet stepped back
very quietly, stooped down, and replaced the sheep's-skin.
Hogstaff, leave the room this moment!” shouted Sir Cradock,
wrathfully; and Job hobbled away to brag how he had “pulled
Muster Garnet down a peg.”
“Now, Garnet, take my easy-chair. Will you have a cup of
coffee after your early walk ?”
“No, thank you.
I have breakfasted three hours and a half
ago. In our position of life, we must be up early, Sir Cradock
Nowell.”
There was something in the tone of that last remark, common-
place as it was, without the key to it, which the hearer disliked
particularly.
“I have requested the favour of your attendance here, Mr. Garnet,
that I might have the benefit of your opinion upon a subject which
causes me very deep anxiety—at least, I mean, which interests me
deeply."
“Ah !” exclaimed Mr. Garnet : he could say “ ah !” in such a
manner that it held three volumes uncut.
“ Yes. I wish to ask your opinion about my poor son,
Cradock."
Bull Garnet said not a word, but conveyed to the ceiling his
astonishment that the housemaid had left such cobwebs there,

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“I fear, Garnet, you cannot sympathize with me. You are so
especially fortunate in your own domestic circumstances.”
Oh, indeed !” said Mr. Garnet, still contemplating the cornice.
“Yes, your son Robert is a very nice boy indeed. So gentle, so
amiable, and so courageous! I had no idea he was so brave. I
wish to see him to thank him for saving the life of my
niece.”
“He is a fine fellow, a noble fellow; Sir Cradock, I need not tell
you, the dearest and the best boy in the whole wide world, to me at
least."
The old man long had known that the flaw in Bull Garnet's
armour was the thought of his dear boy, Bob.
“And can you not fancy, Garnet, that my son, whatever he is,
may also be dear to me!"
• I should have said so, I must have thought so, but for the way
you have treated him."
Bull Garnet knew well enough that he was a hot and hasty man.
But he seldom had felt that truth more sharply than now, when he
saw the result of his words. Nevertheless, he faltered not. He
had made up his mind to deliver its thoughts, and he was not the
man to care for faces.
Garnet," began Sir Cradock, suddenly, hoping perhaps to escape
this trial by another outlet ; “ will you kindly tell me what you
would have done if you had been cast off like this ?”
The steward took, without a word, the letter handed to him. On
the cover was written, in a small clear hand, “Cradock's Defiance :'
which defiance was as follows:-
“MY DEAR FATHER, -Although you have not said so much as
one unkind word to me, I cannot help perceiving that you
would
rather now be quit of me. It is only what I expected, of course,
and what I deserve to have done to me. Every one must feel the
same thing about me now, and you most of all. At such a time, no
one of my age, or of any age perhaps, can say a word to defend
himself, or even desire to do it. I wish I could give my life
up,
if
that would be any good to you. I did not even presume to hope
that you ever could forgive me; and now I know that you never
can. Therefore, father, I can do no more than say farewell to you.
“C. N.”
Bull Garnet read this letter at a glance, as he did every thing, and
if he had not read it so, the great tears would have blinded him.
Then he returned it, and spoke up.
“Sir Cradock Nowell, I am a violent, hot, and passionate man.
I have done many things in my fury which I would give my life to
undo; but I would rather have them all on my soul than such
cold-blooded, calm, unnatural cruelty as you are showing to your only
- I mean to your own-son. I suppose you never cared for him ;
suppose! I mean of course you did not."
Speaking thus, the steward gazed at his employer, not only with-

257
out respect, but with undisguised contempt. The old man could not
glance it back; neither did he seem to be as indignant as he should
have been.
“Then—then, I suppose you don't think-you don't imagine, as
some people do,—that he did it on purpose ?"
Mr. Garnet turned pale as a winding-sheet, and could not speak
for a moment. Then he looked away from Sir Cradock's eyes, and
said, as if to himself:
“Can his father have ever thought so ?”
“I have tried, I have tried,” said the luckless father. “God
knows that I have done my best. Garnet, have pity upon me. If
you have any of our blood in you, tell me the truth-what do you
think?"
“I not only think, but know, that the devil only could have sug-
gested such an idea to you. Man, for the sake of the God that
made you, and made me as well as your brother, and every one of
us brethren, rather put a pistol to your heart than that damned idea.
In cold blood! in cold blood! And for the sake of gain! A brother
to, to-make away with a other so! Oh, what things we come
to think of! Where is my God, and where is yours?"
“I am sure I don't know,” replied the old man, gazing round in
wonderment, as if he expected to see Him-for the scene had quite
unnerved him_“I suppose He is—is somewhere in the usual place,
my good Garnet.”
“ Then that's not in this neighbourhood," muttered Bull Garnet,
heavily ; “He is gone from me, from all of us. And His curse is
on my children. Poor innocents, poor helpless lambs! The curse
of God is on them."
He took his great strides to the window; and, through his tears,
and among the trees, tried to find his cottage-roof.
Sir Cradock Nowell was lost to thought, and heard not one of
those woeful words, although from the depth of a stormy heart they
came like the distant sea-roar.
Bull Garnet returned with his fierce eyes softened to a woman's
fondness, and saw, with pity as well as joy, that his last words had
not been heeded. Ever hot and ever hasty, until it comes to my
own death," he muttered, still in recklessness; “perhaps then I
shall be tardy. For my son's sake, for my Bob and Pearl, I must
not make such an ass of myself. Like Cradock, I must write and
run."
Garnet," said Sir Cradock Nowell, slowly recovering from his
stupor (a slight pressure on the brain perhaps), “say nothing of
what has passed between us-nothing, I entreat you; and not
another word just now. I only understand that you assert empha-
tically my boy Cradock's innocence"
“With every fibre of my heart. With every atom of my brain.”
“ Then you deserve my iove for it.”

now, Sir
“Don't say that. Never say it again. I can't bear it
Cradock."
“ Very well then, let it pass. I think now of so many things; but
never want to be thanked for them.”
“I am very thankful to you. Gratitude, Sir Cradock Nowell, is
a very admirable and old-fashioned institution-quite out of date,
as I now will show.
I am come to give you notice—as well as to
answer your summons-notice of my intention to quit your service
shortly."
“Nonsense!” cried Sir Cradock, carried out of his usual manner;
nonsense, Garnet! You never mean that you, even you would
desert me !"
The steward turned away from the look of proud and stern dis-
appointment; and then he said, --
“Yes, I know. I ought to be more grateful—at such a time
especially. But, I cannot help it.”
• Very well,” Sir Cradock answered ; “let it be so, if it must. I
have done my best to right an ancient wrong. And this is all that
comes of it."
“No wrong ever can be righted," answered Garnet sternly;
“ until it is repented of, and spread before both God and man.”
“Enough, enough!" replied Sir Cradock; “I am not accus-
tomed to that sort of thing. If you choose to leave me, you must
do so. I have nothing more to say.”
That same forenoon there came from Rushford Mrs. Brown's boy
and donkey, with a very long message from a lady who had tucked
the boy on the head because he could not make out her meaning.
He believed her name was Mrs. Jogging, and he was to say that
Miss Oh Ah was fit to come home to-day, please, if they'd please to
send the shay for her. And they must please to get ready Satan's
room, where the daffodil curtains was, because the young woman
loved to look at the yeast, and to have a good fire burning. And
please they must send the eel-skin cloak, and the foot-tub in the
shay, because the young woman was silly.
“Chilly, you stupid,” replied Mrs. Toaster. “She shall have the
foot-warmer and the seal-skin cloak; but what Satan's room with
the daffodil curtains is, only the Lord in heaven knows; and how
she is to see any yeast there! Are you certain that was the
message?”
Sartin, ma'am. I said it to myself ever so many times ; every
time that Í whacked the Neddy.”
Sir Cradock Nowell, upon appeal, speedily decided that the satin
room was meant—the room with the rose-coloured curtains, and the
windows facing the east; but the boy stuck out for the daffodil;
leastways he was certain it was some sort of flower.
It was nearly dark when the carriage returned; and Sir Cradock

came down to the entrance-hall to meet his brother's child. Too
proud though he was to make any outward sign of any difference,
yet inside himself he felt that his nerves were not as they used to be.
Do what he would, he could not keep a little flutter from his lips,
and temples, and gray eyelids, or from his thin straight-fingered
hands a sort of shaking stiffness.
Because, from Dr. Hutton's description, as well as from his own
ideas of things done in India, he feared to see in his probable
heiress (for now he seemed to have no heir) something outlandish
and barbarous.
Great therefore were his surprise and delight, when a graceful and
beautiful girl, with high birth and elegance in every movement,
flung off her cloak, and skipped up to him with the lightness of a
gazelle, and threw her arms round his neck, and kissed him.
“Oh, uncle, I shall love you so! You are so like my darling-
you have got his nose exactly, and just the same shaped legs. Oh,
to think he should ever have left me !” And she burst into tears
then and there before half a dozen servants. Oh, Uncle Cradock,
you have got a fine house; but I never shall care about it.”
“ Hush, my dear; come with me, my child !” Sir Cradock was
always wide awake upon the subject of proprieties.
“I am not your child ; and I won't be your child, if you try to
stop me like that. I must cry when I want to cry, and it is so
stupid to stop me.”
“What a pretty dear you are !” said Sir Cradock, scarce knowing
what to say, but confiding in feminine vanity.
“Am I indeed ? That shows how much you know about it.
was very pretty, of course I was, until I began to cry so.
But now
I am gone like a bundle of reed mashed up for making paper. But
when you come to think of my father never, never to take me on
his lap again! Hya! Hya! Hya!"
Faix, thin, me darlin'," cried Mrs. O'Gaghan, stroking her
down in a shampooing manner, “it's meself as knows how to dale
with you. Lave her to me, Sir Crayduck; she's pure and parfict,
every bit on her. I knows how to bring her out, and she'll come to
your room like a lamb, now jist.-Git out of the way, the lot on
you”—to several officious maidens-“me honey, put your hand in
my neck, your blissed leetle dove of a hand, and fale how me heart
goes pat for you. Sir Crayduck, me duty to you, but you might ’ave
knowed how to git out of the way, and lave the ladies to the ladies."
Sir Cradock Nowell marched away, thinking what a blessing it
was that he had not had much to do with women. Then he reproached
himself for the thought, as he remembered his darling Violet, the
mother of his children.
But, before he had brooded very long in the only room he liked
to use now, his study just off from the library, a gentle knock came
to the door--as Biddy always expressed it-and Eöa, dressed in

deepest mourning (made at Lymington, from her own frock, while
she lay ill at the “ Crown"), came up to him steadily, and kissed
him, and sat on a stool at his feet.
“Oh, uncle, I am so sorry,” she said, with the weight of her hair
falling over his knees, and her deep eyes looking up at him, “ I am
so sorry, Uncle Cradock, that I vexed you so, just now.”
“ You did not vex me, my pretty. I was only vexed for you.
Now, remember one thing, my darling-for I shall love vou as my
own daughter-I have been very harsh and stern where, perhaps, I
had no right to be so : if I am ever unkind to you, my dear, if I ever
say any thing hard, only say · Clayton Nowell' to me, and I will
forgive you directly.'
"You mean I must forgive you, uncle. I suppose that's what
you mean.
If you are unkind to me, what will you want to forgive
me for? But I couldn't do it. I couldn't say it, even if I had done
any harm. Please to remember that I either love, or else I hate
people dreadfully. I know that I shall love you. But you must
not contradict me. I never could endure it yet ; and I never intend
to try.”
“Well,” said Sir Cradock, laughing; “I will try to remember
that, my dear. Though, in that respect, you differ but little from
our own young
ladies.
If you please, Uncle Cradock, I must go to-night to see where
you have put my father. There, I won't cry any more, because he
told me never to vex you, and I see that my crying vexes you. Did
you cry, yourself, Uncle Cradock, when you heard of it first ?”
She looked at him, as she asked this question, with such wild
intensity, as if her entire opinion of him would hang upon his reply,
that the old man felt himself almost compelled to tell“ a corker.”
“Well, my dear, I am not ashamed to confess-
Ashamed to confess, indeed! I should rather hope not. But
you ought to be ashamed, I know, if you did not cry, Uncle
Cradock. But now I shall love you very much, now I know how
much you cried. And how much have you got a year, Uncle
Crad ?"
“How much what, my dear? What beautiful eyes you have,
Eva; finer than any of the Nowells !”
“Yes, I know. But that won't do, Uncle Crad; you don't want
to answer my question. What I want to know is a very simple
thing. How much money have you got a year ? You must have
got a good deal, I know, because every body says so, and because
this is such a great place, as big as the palaces in Calcutta.”
“Really, Eöa, it is not usual for young people, especially young
ladies, to ask such very point-blank questions.
Oh, how should I know such things as that; and what harm
can there be in it? I know the English girls at Calcutta used to
think of nothing else. But I am not a bit like them; it isn't that I

care for the money a quarter so much as tamarinds; but I have a
particular reason; and I'll find out in spite of you. Uncle Cradock,
you'll see how I'll manage it.”
“A very particular reason, Eöa, for inquiring into my income !
Why, what reason can you have?”
“Really, Uncle Cradock, is it usual for old people, especially old
gentlemen, to ask such very point-blank questions?”
Sir Cradock would have been very angry with any
other
person
in the world for such a piece of impertinence; but Eöa gave such a
smile of triumph at having caught him in his own net (as she
thought), and looked so exquisite in her beauty, as she rose, and the
firelight fashed on her; then she tossed her black hair over her
shoulders, and gave him such a kiss (with all the spices of India in
it) that the old man was at her mercy quite, and she need have no
mercy upon him.
Oh, Mrs. Nowell Corklemore-so proud of having obtained at
last an invitation to Nowelhurst, so confident that, once let in, you
can wedge out all before you, like Alexander's phalanx-call a halt,
and har your iles, and look to belt and buckler, have every
lance fresh set and burnished, every sword a razor; for verily the
fight is hard, which art must wage with nature.
CHAPTER XL.
AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE.
PREVIOUS to the matters chronicled in the preceding chapter, Mr.
Garnet had received a note, of which the following is a copy :-
“SIR,-My friend, Major Blazeater, late of the Hon. East India
Company's 59th Regiment of Native Infantry, has kindly con-
sented to see you, on my behalf, to request a reference to any
gentleman whom you may be pleased to name, for the purpose of
concerting measures for affording me that satisfaction which, as a
man and a gentleman, I am entitled to expect for your cowardly
and most ruffianly violence on the 28th ultimo.
“I beg you to accept my sincere apologies for the delay which
has occurred, and my assurance that it has been the result of cir-
cumstances entirely beyond my own control.
“ I have the honour to be, Sir,
“Your most obedient Servant,
“ RUFUS HUTTON.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
The circumstances beyond the fiery little doctor's control were
that he could not find any one who would undertake to carry his
message.
When Bull Garnet read this letter-handed to him, with three
great bows of the Chinese pattern, by the pompous Major Blazeater
-his face flushed to a deep amethyst tinge, which subsided to the
colour of cork. Then he rolled his great eyes, and placed one
strong finger across the deep channels of his forehead, and said,
“Let me think, sir !”
“Hurrah,” said the Major to himself, “now we shall have some-
thing to redeem the honour of the age. It is a disgrace for a fellow
to live in a country where he can never get satisfaction, although he
gets plenty of insult.”
“ Major Blazeater, you will make allowances for me," resumed
Mr. Garnet ;“ but I have never had much opportunity of becoming
acquainted with the laws—the code, perhaps I should say—which
govern the honourable practice of duelling at the present day.”
No matter, my dear sir; no matter at all, I assure you. Your
second, when I have the honour of meeting him, will settle all
those little points, which are beside the general issue; we shall
settle them together, sir, with the strictest regard to punctilio, and
to your entire satisfaction."
Capital fellow !” pursued the Major, in his own reflection-room;
“knew he couldn't be a coward : just look at his forehead. No
doubt he was perfectly justified in kicking out Rue Hutton ; Rue is
such an impudent beggar. Ah!” referring to his pocket-book to find
his military friend's address; “now we shall do it in style. Glorious
fellow this Garnet--shall have the very best powder. Wish I was
on his side.” And the Major rubbed his long brown hands upon
his lanky knees.
“Will it be according to rule," asked Mr. Garnet, looking steadily
(“What an eye for a pistol !” said the Major to himself), “ quite
according to rule and order, if I write down for you, Major Blazeater,
the name of the friend to whom I refer ; also the time and place
at which he will be ready to discuss this little matter with
“To be sure, to be sure, my dear sir; nothing could be better.
Your conduct, Mr. Garnet, does you the very highest honour.”
"Nothing, you think, can be objected to my course in this ?
nothing against the high chivalric code of modern duelling?"
“No, my dear sir, nothing at all. Please to hand me the assig-
nation; ha, ha, it is so pleasant-I mean the rendezvous.”
Garnet handed to him a card, whereon was written : "Town
Hall, Lymington, Wednesday, November 2nd. Before Admiral
Reale, Col. Fale, and C. Durant, Esq. Application will be made at
12 o'clock for a warrant against Rufus Hutton and Major Blazeater
-Christian name unknown-for conspiring together to procure one

Bull Garnet to fight a duel, against the peace of her Majesty and
the spirit of the age.”
Major Blazeater fell back in his chair; and all his blood ran to
his head. As he told his daughter afterwards, he had never had
such a turn in his life. The fairest prospect blasted, the sunrise
of murder quenched; what good was it to live in a world where
people won't shoot one another? Bull Garnet bent his large eyes
upon him, and the Major could not answer them.
“Now, Major Blazeater," said Mr. Garnet," I shall bind you over
to keep the peace, and your principal as well, and expose you to the
ridicule of every sensible man in England, unless I receive by to-
morrow morning's post at 10.15 a.m. an apology for this piece of
infantile bravado. What a man does in hot passion, God knows,
and God will forgive him for, if he truly strive to amend it—at least
-at least, I hope so.”
Here Mr. Garnet turned away, and looked out of the window, and
perhaps it was the view of Bob that made his eyes so glistening.
“But, sir,” he resumed-while the Major was wondering where on
earth he should find any sureties for keeping her Majesty's peace,
which he could not keep with his wife—“sir, I look at things of this
sort from a point of view diametrically opposed to yours. Perhaps
you have the breadth to admit that my view may be right, and yours
may be wrong."
Nothing, nothing at all, sir, will I admit to a man who actually
appoints the magistrates the custodians of his honour.”
Honour, sir, as we now regard it, is nothing more than fool's
varnish. Justice, sir, and truth are things we can feel and decide
about. Honour is the feminine of them, and, therefore, apt to con-
fuse a man. Major Blazeater, the only honour I have is to wish you
good morning.”
Hang it all,” said the Major to himself, as he was shown out
honourably, “I have put my foot in it this time; and won't Mrs.
Blazeater give it to me! That woman finds out every thing. This
is now the third time I've tried to get up a snug little meeting, and
the fates are all against me. Dash it, now, if I've got to pay costs,
O Boadicea Blazeater, you won't mend my gloves for a fortnight.”
Major Blazeater wore very tight doeskin gloves, and was always
wearing them out. Hence, his appeal to the female Penates took
this constricted form. The household god of the Phænicians, and
the one whose image they affixed to the bows of their galleys,
hoping to steer homewards, was (as we know from many sources)
nothing but a lamb; a very rude figure, certainly,--square, thick-set,
inelegant; but perhaps they felt that some grand home-truth clung
to their Agna Dea. Major Blazeater was a lamb, whose wits only
went to the shearing the moment you got him upon his own hearth,
and Boadicea bleated at him. He would crumple his neck up, and
draw back his head, and look pleadingly at any one, as a house

lamb might do on Good Friday, and feel that his father had done it
before him, and he, too, must suffer for sheepishness.
Meditating sadly thus, he heard a great voice coming after him
down the gravel-walk, and, turning round, was once more under Mr.
Garnet's eyes.
“ One more word with you, if you please, sir. It
will be necessary that you two warlike gentlemen should appoint a
legal second. Mine will be Mr. Brockwood, who will be prepared
to show that your principal was grossly inquisitive and impertinent,
before I removed him from my premises."
“Oh!” cried the Major, delighted to find any loophole for
escape, “that puts a new aspect upon the matter, if he gave you
provocation, sir."
“ He gave me as strong rovocation as one man can well give
another, by prying into my-domestic affairs, in the presence of my
son and daughter, and even tampering with my servants. He left
me no other course, except to remove him from my house."
“Which you did rather summarily. My dear sir, I should have
done the same. Had I been aware of these facts, I would have
declined to bear his cartel. You shall receive my apology by to-
morrow morning's post. I trust this unwise proceeding-may-may
not proceed any further. Your behaviour, sir, does you credit, and
requires no vindication at law.”
Thus spoke Major Blazeater, bowing and smiling elaborately
urder a combination of terrors—the law, public ridicule, expenses ;
worst of all, Mrs. Blazeater. The next morning, Mr. Garnet received
from him a letter, not only apologetic, but highly eulogistic, at
which Bull Garnet smiled grimly, as he tossed it into the fire. By
the same post came a letter from Rufus, to the following effect :-
"SIR, -I regret to find that your courage consists in mere brute
force and power. I regard you as no longer worthy of the notice
of a gentleman. The cowardly advantage you took of your superior
animal strength, and your still more cowardly refusal to redress the
brutal outrage, as is the manner of gentlemen, stamp you as no more
than a navvy, of low corporeal brutishness. Do not think that, be-
cause I cannot meet you physically, and you will not meet me fairly,
you are beyond my reach. I will have you yet, Bull Garnet; and I
know how to do it. Your last ferocious outrage has set me think-
ing, and I see things which I must have been blind not to see
before. I shall see you, some day, in the felon's dock, an object
of scorn to the lowest of the low, so sure as my name is
“ RUFUS HUTTON.
“P.S.-I shall be at Lymington to-morrow, ready to meet you,
if
you
dare initiate the inquiry."
Mr. Garnet did not burn this letter, but twice read it through
very carefully, and then stowed it away securely. Who could tell
but it might be useful as a proof of animus? During these several
operations his eyes had not much of triumph in them.

AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE.
265
Rufus Hutton rode to Lymington. carrying a life-preserver : he
appeared in the Town Hall, at the petty sessions ; but there was no
charge made against him. Being a pugnacious little fellow, and no
lover of a peaceful issue, he had a great mind then to apply for a
warrant against Garnet for assaulting him. But he felt that he had
given some provocation, and could not at present justify it; and he
had in the background larger measures, which might be foiled by
precipitancy. So that lively broil, being unfought out and unfor-
given—at least on one side-passed into as rank a feud as ever the
sun went down upon. Not that Mr. Garnet felt much bitterness
about it; only he knew that he must guard against a powerful
enemy.
Meanwhile Amy had told her father what Cradock had said to her
in the churchyard, and how she had replied to him. In fact, she
could not keep it to herself until she went to bed that night ; but
mingled her bright, flowing hair with his beautiful silver locks,
while her heart was still pit-a-patting, and leaned on his shoulder
for comfort, and was not long in finding it.
My own dearest, life of my life," cried her father, forgetting both
Greek and Latin, but remembering how he loved her mother, “my
own and only child—now you do look so like your mother, darling
—may the God who has made you my blessing bless your dear
warm heart in this !”
The very next day Mr. Rosedew fell into a pit of meditation. He
forgot all about Pelethronian Lapiths, the trimming of Gruter's
lamp (which had long engaged him ; for he knew the flame of learn-
ing there unsnuffed by any Smelfungus): even the Sabellian elements
were but as sabellicus sus to him. It was one of his peculiarities,
that he never became so deeply abstracted as when he had to take
in hand any practical question. He could take in hand any glo-
rious thesis, such as the traces still existing of a middle voice in
Latin, or the indications of very early civilization in Eubea, and the
question whether the Ionians came not mainly westward-any of
these things he could think of, dwell upon, and eat his dinner with-
out knowing salt from mustard. But he could not make a treatise
of Amy, nor could he get at her etymology. He began to think
that his education had been neglected in some points. And then
he thought about Socrates, and his symposiastic drolleries, and
most philosophic reply when impeached of Xanthippic weakness.
Nevertheless, he could not make up his mind upon one point-
whether or not it was his duty to go and inform Sir Cradock Nowell
of his son's attachment. If the ancient friend had been as of old,
or had only changed towards John Rosedew, continuing true all the
while to the son, the parson would have felt no doubt as to how his
duty lay. And the more straightforward and honest course was ever
the first to open upon him. But, when he remembered how sadly
estranged the father already was from the son, how he had even

CRADOCK NOWELL.
dared in his grief to suspect him of wilful fratricide, how he had
wandered far and wide from the sanity of affection, and was, in-
deed, no longer worthy to be called a father, John Rosedew felt
himself absolved from all parental communion.
Then how was it as to expediency? Why, just at present, this
knowledge would be the very thing to set Sir Cradock yet more
against the outcast. For, in the days of old confidence and friendly
interfusion, he had often expressed to John his hope that Clayton
might love Amy; and now he would at once conclude that Cradock
had been throughout the rival of his darling, and perhaps an unsuc-
cessful one, till the other was got rid of. Therefore the rector re-
solved, at last, to hold his peace in the matter ; to which conclusion
Aunt Doxy's advice and Amy's entreaties contributed. But these
two ladies, although unanimous in their rapid conclusion, based it
upon premises as different as could be.
Appease him, indeed!” cried Aunt Eudoxia, drawing up her
stately figure, and twitching her shawl on the slope of her shoulders,
of which, by-the-by, she was very proud-she had heard it showed
high breeding—" appease him, brother John; as if his son had dis-
graced him by meditating an alliance with the great-granddaughter
of the Earl of Driddledrum and Dromore! Upon such occasions,
as I have always understood, though perhaps I know nothing about
it, and you understand it better, John, it is the gentleman's place to
secure the acquiescence of his family. Acquiescence, indeed !
What has our family ever thought of a baronetcy? There is better
blood in Amy Rosedew, Brian O’Lynn, and Cadwallader, than any
Cradock Nowell ever had, or ever will have, unless it is her son,
Inform him, indeed ! as if our Amy was nobody!”
“Pa, don't speak of it,” said Amy,“ until dear Cradock wishes it.
We have no right to add to his dreadfully bad luck; and he is the
proper judge. He is sure to do what is right. And after all that
he has been through, oh, don't treat him like a baby, father."
CHAPTER XLI.
A QUESTION OF PRECEDENCE.
In spite of many obstacles, Mrs. Nowell Corklemore was now well
established at the Hall, and did not mean in her kind rich heart to
quit the place prematurely. Almost every day, however, she made
some feint of departure, which rendered every one more alive to the
value of her presence.
“How could her dear Nowell exist without her? She felt quite

..
sure he would come that day-yes, that very day—to fetch her, in
their little simple carriage, that did shake her poor back so dread-
fully"-back thrown into prominence here, being an uncommonly
pretty one—“but oh, how thankful she ought to be for having a
carriage at all, and so many poor things-quite as good, quite as
refined, and delicate-could scarcely afford a perambulator for their
dear little ducks of babies! But she hoped for dear Sir Cradock's
sake, and that sweet simple-minded Eöa—who really did require
some little cultivation—that, now she understood them both, and
could do her little of ministering, Mr. Corklemore would let her
stay, if it were only two days longer. And then her Flore, her
sweet little Flore! An angel of refinement to them.”
Georgie had been married twice; and she was just the sort of
woman who would have been married a dozen times, if a dozen,
save one, of husbands were so unfortunate as to leave her. Her
first lord, or rather. vassal, had been the Count de Vance—"a
beggarly upstart Frenchman,” in the language of his successor, who,
by-the-by, had never seen, but heard of him too often; but, accord-
ing to better authority, “a man one could truly look up to; so
warm-hearted, so agreeable; and never for a moment tired, dear,
of his poor little simple wife.”
Perhaps it is needless to state that Mr. Corklemore long had been
so scientifically henpecked that he loved the operation. He now was
almost afraid to say “Haw," when there was even a possibility
that his wife should reply with “Pshaw."
Sir Cradock Nowell, of course, had seen a good deal of what is
called the world; but his knowledge of women was only enough to
teach him the extent of that subject. He never was surprised much
at any thing they did; but he could not pretend to tell the reason of
their doing it, even when they had any, of which he did not often
suspect them. He believed that they would have their way, when-
ever they could, wherever, and by whatever means; that very few
of them meant what they said, and none of them knew what they
meant; that the primal elements, in the entire body feminine, were
jealousy, impulsiveness, vanity, and contrariety.
Georgie Corklemore soon found out that he had adopted this, the
popular male opinion; and she did not once attempt to remove it,
knowing, as she did, that nothing could be more favourable to her
purposes. So she took up the part—which suited her as well as any,
and enabled her to say many things which else would have given
offence—the part of the soft, impulsive, warm-hearted, foolish
woman, who is apt among men to become a great pet, if she happens
to be good-looking.
Eöa would gladly have yielded her prerogatives to Georgie, but Mrs.
Corklemore was too wide awake to accept any one of them. “No,
darling," she replied, “ for your own sake I will not. It is true that
Uncle Cradock wishes it, and so, no doubt, do you; but you are

bound to acquire all this social knowledge of which you have
now so little; and how can you do so except by instruction and
practice ?"
“Oh,” cried Eöa, firing up,“ if Uncle Cradock wishes it, I'ın sure
I'll leave it to you, and not be laughed at any longer. I'll go to
him at once, and tell him so. And as for being bound, I won't be
bound to learn any nonsense I don't like. My papa was as wise as
any of you, and a great deal better; and he never made such a fuss
about rubbish as you do here.”
“Stop, sweet child, stop a moment-
“I am not a sweet child, and I won't stop. And another thing
I had made up my mind to it before this, mind-be-
fore you tried to turn me out of my place-and it's this. You may
call me what you like, but I don't mean to call you' Cousin Georgie'
any longer. In the first place, I don't like you, and never shall as
long as I live; for I never half believe you; and, in the next place,
you are no cousin of inine; and social usage (or whatever it is you
are always bothering me about) may require me to tell some stories,
but not that one, at any rate. Or, at any rate, I won't do it.”
“Very well,” replied Mrs. Corklemore, looking up from the softest
of fancy-work, with the very sweetest of smiles; “then I shall be
obliged, in self-defence, to address you as “ Miss Nowell.”
“To be sure. Why shouldn't you ?"
“Well, it can be shown, perhaps, that you are entitled to the
name. Only at first it will seem absurd when applied to a baby
like you.”.
“A baby like me, indeed!” This was Eöa's sore point; and
Georgie, who delighted in making her outrageous, was always harp-
ing upon it. “Mrs. Corklemore, how dare you call me, at my age,
a baby?”
Eöa looked down at Georgie, with great eyes Aashing fire, and
her clear, bright forehead wrinkling, and her light form poised like
an antelope's on the edge of a cliff. Mrs. Corklemore, not thinking
it worth while to look up at her, carelessly threw back a curl, and
went on with her rug-work.
“Because you are a baby, and nothing more, Eöa.”
In a moment she was tossed through the air, and sitting on Eöa's
head, low satin chair and all. She had not time to shriek, so rapid
was her elation. Little Flore, running in at the moment, clapped
her hands and shouted, “ Oh, ma, have a yide, a nice yide, same as
me have yesterday. Me next, me next. Oh, ah!”
Eöa, with the greatest ease, her figure as straight as a poplar-tree,
bore the curule chair and its occupant to the end of the room, and
there deposited them carefully on a semi-grand piano.
“ That's how we nurse the babies in India," she cried, with a
smile of sweet temper, “but it takes a big baby to do it, and some
practice, I can tell you. Now, I'll not let you down, Mrs. Corkle-

more,—and, if visitors come in, what will they think of our social
usages ? Down you don't come, till you have promised solemnly
never to call me a baby again.”
“My dear,” began Georgie, trying hard not to look ridiculous-
though the position was so unfavourable—“my dear child-
“No, not my dear child, even !' 'Miss Nowell,' if you please, and
nothing else.”
“Miss Nowell, if you will only lift me down-oh, it is polished so
nastily, I am slipping off already-I will promise solemnly to call
you only what you like, all the rest of my life.”
Eöa lifted her off in an instant. “But mind, I will be even with
you,” cried Georgie, through her terror, when safe on the floor once
I don't care that for you,” answered Eöa, snapping her fingers
like a copper-cap; “only I will have proper respect shown to me
by people I particularly dislike. People I love may call me what,
or do with me what, they please. My father was just the same;
and I don't want to be any better than he was; and I don't believe
God wants it."
He must be easily contented, then.”
Georgie, with all her deliciousness, could never pass a chance of
more.
sarcasm.
“Now I'll go and have it out with Uncle Cradock, about having
you for my ayah.”
Mrs. Corklemore trembled far more at those words than at find-
ing herself on the piano. This strange girl—whom she had so
despised-was baffling all her tactics, and with no other sword and
shield but those of truth and candour.
“ I've been a fool," said Georgie to herself, for about the first
time in her life; “I have strangely underrated this girl, and shall
have hard work now to get round her. But it must be done. Come,
though I have been so rash, I have two to one in my favour, now
I see the way to handle it. But she must not tell the old noodle ;
that will never do."
“I thought, Miss Nowell,” she continued aloud," that it would
not be considered honourable, even among East Indians, to repeat
to a third person what was said familiarly and in confidence.”
“Of course not. What makes you speak of it? Do you mean to
say I would do such a thing?"
“No, I am sure you would not, knowingly. But if you think for
a moment, you will see that what I said just now, especially as to
Sir Cradock's opinions, was told to you in pure confidence, and
meant to go no further."
“Oh,” answered Eöa, “ then please not to tell me any thing in
pure confidence again, because I can't keep secrets, and you have
no right to load me with them, without ever asking my leave even.
But I'll try not to let it out, unless you provoke me before him.”

CRADOCK NOWELL.
With this half promise Georgie was obliged to be content. She
knew well enough that, if Eöa brought the question before her
uncle, the truth would come out that Sir Cradock had never
dreamed for a moment of substituting. Georgie, the daughter of his
cousin, for Eöa, the only daughter of his only brother Clayton. He
knew, of course, that the Eastern maiden had no artificial polish;
but he saw that she had an inborn truth, a delicacy of feeling, and
a native sympathy, which wanted only experience to be better than
any polish.
From that day forth Mrs. Corklemore (aided perhaps by physical
terror) formed a higher estimate of Eöa's powers. So she changed
her tactics altogether, and employed her daughter, that sharp little
Flore, to cover the next advance. Flore was a little beauty; so far
as any thing artificial can be really beautiful. Dressed, as she was,
in the height of French fashion, and herself nine-tenths of a French-
woman-for there is no such thing as a French girl, as we English-
men understand girlhood-she always looked like a butterfly, just
born in and just about to pop out of a bower; for little Flore was
divinely beautiful.”
This angel was now nearly four years old, and would look at you
with the loveliest eyes that ever appealed from the cradle to heaven,
and throw her exaggerated little figure back, and tell you the biggest
lie that an angel ever wiped her mouth over. Oh, you lovely child !
Far better to be that little Loo Jupp, who knows a number of bad
words, which you would faint to hear of. But Loo won't tell a lie.
Her father beat her out of it the very first time she tried.
CHAPTER XLII.
SEVERAL DISCOVERIES.
"
“ DEAR Uncle Cradock," said Georgie next day, for she had obtained
permission long ago to address her father's cousin so, “what a very
sweet girl our Eöa is !”
“I am very glad that you think so, Georgie ; she reminds me
very often of what my brother was at her age.
Oh, I do love her so! She has so much variety, and she does
seem so straightforward."
“Not only seems but is so, Georgie ; at times, indeed, a little too
much of it."
“Well, I doubt if there can be too much of it,” cried Georgie, in
the rapture of her own heart's truth and simplicity,“especially among
relations, uncle. Just see now how all the misunderstandings which
arose between ourselves, for instance, might have been saved by a

271
little straightforward explanation. In my opinion, our Eöa would be
absolutely perfect, if we could only put a little polish, a little finish,
upon her. I suppose that was what her poor father intended, in
bringing her to England."
“Ah, perhaps it was. I never thought of that. But I have
thought, often enough, my dear Georgie, of my own duty towards
her; and I wish to consult you about it ; you are so discreet and
sensible.”
“Yes,” replied Mrs. Corklemore, with a facetious curtsy, “to be
sure I am, a perfect Queen of Sheba.”
As this implied, by the manner of it, that Sir Cradock was a per-
fect Solomon, he accepted the chaff very graciously, and said to
himself, “What magnificent eyes my niece Georgie has, and what
a sweet complexion, and a most exquisite figure! I wonder what
Corklemore is about, in leaving her here so long! But then he has
such confidence in her. Women of sense and liveliness, who have
an answer for every body, are so much more trustworthy than the
sly things who drop their eyes, and think all sorts of evil.”
Meanwhile Georgie saw all this passing through his mind-more
clearly, perhaps, than she would have seen it, if it had been passing
through her own.
“ To be sure. How thoughtful of you! You mean your duty,
Uncle Cradock, as to making her your heiress, now ?"
Mrs. Corklemore knew well enough that he meant nothing of the
sort; but the opportunity for the suggestion was too fine to be lost.
Oh,"
,” said Sir Cradock, with a grim smile, "you consider that
my duty, do you ? No, it was not on that subject I was anxious for
your opinion, but as to sending the child to school, or taking some
other means to finish her education."
She won't go," replied Mrs. Corklemore, seeing some chance of
a quarrel here : “of course it would be the best thing for her ; but I
am quite certain the sweet creature never will go."
“The sweet creature must, if I make her.”
“ To be sure, Uncle Cradock; but I don't believe you can. Has
she not favoured you with her intentions as to settling in life, rather
-well, perhaps rather prematurely ?”
“Yes,” replied the old man, laughing," she has informed me, with
all due ceremony, of her intention to marry Bob Garnet, the moment
she is out of mourning for her dearest father.”
“ Master Garnet has not asked her yet. And I have reason to
believe". -here Georgie softly hesitated.
“What?" asked Sir Cradock, anxiously, for he was very fond of
Eöa ; she was such a novelty to him.
“ That Master Bob Garnet, just come from school, loves Amy
Rosedew above Eöa, toffee, rock, or peppermint.”.
Amy Rosedew is a minx," answered the old man hotly. “I
offered to shake hands with her, when I met her on Wednesday, and

was even going to kiss her, because she is my god-daughter, and-
and -an uncommonly pretty girl, you know, and what do you think
she said ?”
“Oh don't tell me, Uncle Cradock, if it was any thing impudent.
You know I could not stand it, thinking what I do of those Rose-
dews."
“She threw herself back with her great eyes flashing, and the
colour in her cheeks dark crimson, and she said, “No, thank you.
No contact for me with unnatural injustice!' And she drew her
frock around her, and swept away as if the road was not wide
enough for both of us. Nice behaviour, was not it? And I fear
her father endorses it.”
“I know he does," answered Georgie, whose face during that
description had been a perfect study of horror contending with
humour ; “I know that Mr. Rosedew, one of the best men in the
world, if, indeed, he is sincere—which others may doubt, but not I
--he, poor man, having little perception, except of his own interest,
has taken a most unfavourable view of every thing we do here. Oh,
I am so sorry. It almost makes one feel as if we must be in the
wrong.” Beautiful Georgie sighed heavily, like a fair woman at a
confessional.
“His own interest, Georgie ! Ourselves in the wrong! I don't
quite understand you."
“ As if we were harsh, you know, Uncle Cradock; when, Heaven
be thanked, we have not concluded, as too, too many -But, not to
talk of that absurdity, and not to pain you, darling uncle, you must
know what I meant about Mr. Rosedew's interest.'
“No, indeed I don't, Georgie. I don't see how John-I mean
Mr. Rosedew's interest is at all involved in the matter."
“He had a daughter passing fair," sang Mrs. Corklemore, without
thinking. Oh, uncle, I forgot ; I am so light-headed and foolish,
I forget every thing now. It is Nowell's fault for worrying me, as
he does every week, about income.”
She passed her hand across her forehead, and swept the soft dark
hair back, as if worldly matters were too many for her poor childish
brain. Who could look at her without wishing that she really cared
for herself, just a little?
“I insist upon knowing what you mean, Georgie,” said Sir
Cradock, frowning heavily, for he was not at all sentimental ; “ John
Rosedew's daughter is Amy; and Amy, I know, is perfectly honest,
though as obstinate as the dev?--hem, I beg your pardon ; I mean
that Amy is very obstinate, as well as exceedingly bigoted, and I
might almost say insolent.”
"Oh no; I can never believe that, Uncle Cradock, even upon
your authority.” In the heat of truth, Mrs. Corklemore stood up
and faced Sir Cradock.
“But I tell you she is, Georgie. Don't try to defend her. No

young woman of eighteen ought to have spoken as she did to me
when I met her last Wednesday. 'Outrageous' is the mildest word
I can use to describe her manner.”
“Very likely you thought so, dearest Uncle Cradock; and so very
likely I might have thought, or any of the old-school people. But
we must make allowances-you know we are bound to do so—for
young people brought up to look at things from a different point of
view."
“No-by-George I won't. I have heard that stuff too often.
Spirit of the age, and all that balderdash. Because a set of young
jackanapes are blessed with impudence enough to throw to the dogs
all the teachings of ages, just when it doesn't suit them, is it likely
that we, who are old enough to see the beauty of what they despise,
are to venerate and bow down to infantile inspiration, which itself
bows down to nothing ? Georgie, you are too soft, too mild. Your
forbearance quite provokes me. Leave me, if you please, to form my
own opinions, especially about people whom I know so much better
than you do."
“I am sure, Uncle Cradock," answered Georgie, pouting, “I
never presume in any way to interfere with your opinions. Your
judgment is proverbial ; whereas I have none whatever. Only it was
natural that I should wish you to think well of one who is likely to
be so nearly related to you. What ! why you look surprised, uncle?
Ah, you think me wrong in alluding to it. What a simple silly I am,
to be sure ! But please not to be angry, uncle. I never dreamed
that you wished it kept secret, dear, when all the parish is talking
of it."
Georgie Corklemore, have the goodness to tell me what you
mean.
Oh, don't look at me so, uncle. I never could bear a cross look.
I mean no mystery whatever, only Amy Rosedew's engagement to
your unlucky-I mean your unhappy son. Of course it has your
sanction."
Amy engaged to my-to-that sullen Cradock ! I cannot
believe it. I will not believe it ; and at a time like this !”
Well, I thought the time ill-chosen. But I am no judge of pro-
priety. And they say that the poor-poor darling who is gone, was
himself attached-let us hope that it was not so ; however, I cannot
believe, Uncle Cradock, that you have not even been told of it.”.
" But I tell you, Georgie, that it is so. Perhaps you disbelieve
me in your anxiety to screen them ?”
You know better than that, dear uncle. I believe you, you of
course, before all the rest of the world. And I will screen them no
longer, for I think it bad and ungrateful of them. And after all you
have done for them! Why, surely, you gave them the living ! It
makes me feel quite ill. Ingratitude always does.” Georgie pressed
her hand to her heart and was obliged to get up and walk about.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Presently she came back again, with great tears in her eyes, and her
face full of anger and pity.
Oh, uncle dear, I cannot tell you how grieved I am for your
sake. It does seem so hard-hearted of them. How I feel my own
helplessness that I cannot comfort you! What a passion my
Nowell will be in, when I tell him this! His nature is so warm
and generous, so upright and confiding, and he looks up to you with
such devotion, and such deep respect. I must not tell him at night,
poor fellow, or he would not sleep a wink. And the most contume-
lious thing of all : that pompous old maid, Miss Eudoxia Rosedew,
to be going about and boasting of it—the title and the property-
before any one had the manners even to inform so kind a friend,
and so affectionate a father! The title and the property! How I
hate such worldliness. I never could understand how people could
scheme and plot for such things. And to make so little of you,
uncle, because they relied upon the entail!”
This was quite a shot in the dark, for she knew not whether any
entail subsisted ; and, as it was a most essential point to discover
this, Georgie fixed her swimming eyes--swimming with love and
sympathy-full upon poor Sir Cradock's. He stared a little, but she
scarcely knew what to augur thence. She must have another shot
at it ; but not on the present occasion.
It is scarcely needful, perhaps, to say, knowing Mrs. Corklemore
and Miss Rosedew as we do, that there was not a syllable of truth
in what the former said of the latter. Sir Cradock himself would
have doubted it, if he had been any judge of women ; for Miss
Eudoxia Rosedew thought very little of baronets. How could she
help it, she of the illustrious grandfather? Oh her indignation, if
she only could have dreamed of being charged with making vaunt
over a baronet's title! Neither was it like her, even if she had
thought great things of any pledged alliance, to go about and share
her sentiments with the “common people.” The truth of the
matter was this : Georgie, with her natural craft—no, no! skill we
mean ; how a clumsy pen will stumble—and ten more years of life
to drill it, had elicited Amy's sentiments; as one who, having
stropped a razor, carves his lady's pincushion, or tapster who
blowing on bright gimlet tempts the spigot of bonded wine, or
varlet who with a knowing worm giveth taste of Stilton. Or even,
"As when a man, a sluice-captain, adown from a blackwater head-spring,
All through his plants and garden a waterflow is pioneering,
Holding a shovel in hand, from the carrier casting the sods out;
Then as it goes flowing forward, the pebbles below in a bevy
Swirl about, and it rapidly wimples downhill with a tinkling,
In a spot where a jump of the ground is, and overgets even the guideman.

a sly innuendo and many an Artesian auger, gushed out, like liquid
diamonds, upon the skilful Georgie, and piled upon her a flood of
truth, a Scamander upon Achilles. Oh water upon a duck's back,
because Georgie always swam in truth; please not to say that Cas-
talia, rore puro, wets not the kerchief of a lady three times dipped
in Styx.
And so it came to pass that young Amy let out every thing, having
a natural love of candour and a natural hatred of Georgie, and
expecting to overwhelm her with the rolling seventh billow of truth.
Mrs. Corklemore, softly smiling, reared her honest head out of the
waters, sleeked her soft luxuriant locks, and the only thing likely to
overwhelm her was sympathy unfathomable. Amy did not wish for
that, and begged her, very dryly, by no means to exhaust herself ;
for Amy had moral scent of a liar, even as her father had.
About this time that father-the finest fellow, take him for all in
all, whom one need wish to look upon—was (according to a good
man's luck) in fearful tribulation. Fearful, at least, to any man except
John Rosedew himself; but John, though fully alive to the jeopardy
of his position, allowed his epidermis to quill toward the operator,
and abstracted all his too sensitive parts into a Sophistic apory.
The rector, sitting in his book-room, had got an apron tucked
well under his rosy chin-an apron with two pockets in it, and the
strings in a bow at the back of his neck; and he trembled for his
ear-lobes, whenever he forgot his subject. Around him, with per-
petual clatter, snip and snap and stir-about, hovered, like a Jewish
maiden fingering the mill-stone, who but his Eudoxia ?
In her strong right hand was a pair of shears, keen as those of
Atropos, padded at the handles, lest to hurt the thumb, but the
blades, the trenchant edges-oh what should keep their bright love
asunder? No human ear, for a moment; nay, nor the nose of a
mortal. Neither was this risk and tug, and frequent fullers’-
teaseling, the whole or even the half of the agony Mr. Rosedew was
undergoing. For though he sat with a pile of books heaped in fair
disorder around him—though three were pushing about on his lap,
dusting themselves on his well-worn kersey, like sparrows on a
genial highway-though one was even perched on his right hand
and another on his left, yet he had no more fruition of them (save
in the cud of memory) than had Prometheus of his fire-glow in the
frost of Strobilus, or than the son of Jove and Pluto, whom Ulysses
saw, had of his dessert.
;
Nay, then I looked at Tantalus having a rough tribulation,
Standing fast in a lake, and it came quite home to his chin-beard
Nevertheless he stood thirsting, and had not to seize and to quaff it ;
For every time when the old man would stoop in his longing to quaff it,
Then every time the water died, swallowed back, and at his ancles
Earth shone black in a moment, because a divinity parched it.

CRADOCK NOWELL,
Trees as well, leafing loftily, over his head poured fruitage,
Pear-trees, and pomegranates, and apple-trees glittering-fruited,
Fig-trees of the luscious, and olive-trees of the luxuriant ;
Whereat whenever the old man shot out his hands to grasp them,
Away the wind would toss them into the shadowy cloudland.”
OD. xi. 581.
“Now, John, you are worse than ever, I do declare you are ;
why, you won't even hold your neck straight. I try to make you
look decent: I try so very hard, John; and you haven't even the
gratitude to keep your chin up from the apron. You had much
better go to a barber, and get half your hair pulled out by the roots,
and the other half poisoned with a leaden comb, and then you'll
appreciate me, perhaps."
“We read,” said John Rosedew, complacently gazing at his white
locks as they tumbled and took little jumps on the apron, “ that
when the Argives lost Thyrea, they pledged themselves to a law and
a solemn imprecation, that none of the men should encourage his
hair, and none of the ladies wear gold.”
“And pray what gold do I wear ? Brother John, you are so
personal ; you never can let me alone. I do believe you have never
forgiven me my poor dear grandmother's ring, and watch, and Aunt
Diana's brooch and locket; no, nor even my own dear mother's
diamond ring with the sapphires round it. And perhaps you don't
hate even my bracelet, a mere twist of gold with cat's eyes! Oh,
John, John, how can you be my brother, and show such a little
mind, John ?"
“Whence we may infer,” continued John, quite unruffled ; for he
knew that it would be worse than useless to assure Miss Doxy that
he was not even aware of the existence of the things he was im-
peached with; or at least we have some grounds for supposing
that the Greeks, a very sensitive and highly perceptive race, did not
like to have their hair cut. Compare with this another state-
ment
“No, indeed I won't, John. I should rather hope I would not.
You can't hold your tongue for a moment, however solemn the
occasion is. There, that's the third cut you've got, and I won't
take another snip at you. But you have quoted less Greek than
usual; that's one comfort, at any rate, and I will put you on some gold-
beater's skin, for being so very good, John. Only don't tell Amy ;
she does make such a fuss about it. But there, I need not tell you,
for you won't know how you got them in half an hour's time. Now,
don't make a fuss, John; one would think you were killed”—the
poor rector had dared to put his hand up-“as if you cared indeed
even if you had three great stripes of red all down your collar, or
even upon your white neckerchief. You wouldn't be at all ashamed
of yourself. Have you the face to say that you would, now ?”
Well, dear Doxy, I am not convinced that you are reasonable in

expecting me to be ashamed of bleeding when you have been cutting
“Oh, of course not. I never am reasonable, according to your
ideas. But one thing you may be convinced of, and that is, that I
never will toil and degrade myself by cutting your hair again, John,
after this outrageous conduct."
Mr. Rosedew had been visited so often with this tremendous
menace, that he received it with no satisfaction. Well he knew
that on that day four weeks he must don the blue apron again,
unless something happened worse even than Aunt Doxy's tonsorial
flourishes.
“Now, you are not done yet, John. You are in a great hurry,
are you not, to get the apron off and scatter the hair all about?
What's the good of my taking the trouble to spread Jemima's shawl
down? Can you imagine you are done, when I haven't rubbed you
up with the rosemary even ?"
Coronari marino rore !' No wonder good Flaccus puts it after
multâ cæde bidentium.'. Oh, Doxy, you are inexorable. O averse
Penates ! By the way, that stanza is to my mind the most obscure
(with one exception) in all the Odes. Either Horace had too much
of the ‘lene tormentum'applied just then 'ingenio non sæpe duro,
or else"
Please, miss”—all the girls called her miss—" Dr. Hutton,
miss !”
Bang went Miss Doxy, quicker than thought, left an exclamation,
semi-profane, far behind on the light air, slammed the door on the
poor girl's chilblains, bolted and locked it, and pulled out the key,
and put the scutcheon over the key-hole.
Well, why, dià tí; móbev; unde terrarum ? Women are not
allowed to say 'mehercle, neither men 'mecastor ;. 'ædepol' is

“I have ro patience with you, John," cried Miss Doxy, snatching
up brush, comb, scissors, extract of the sea-dew, the blue apron,
Jemima's shawl of white hair, and we know not how many other
things, and huddling all into a cupboard, and longing to lock her-
self in with them.
“Great truths come out,” answered John, quite placidly, "at
periods of mental commotion. But why, oh Doxy, and whence this
inopine hurry-scurry? There is no classic expression-except per-
haps in Aristophanes or that very strange work the "Atys"-of
prosody quick enough; and, doubtless, for very good reason,
because the people were too wise to hurry so. *Rumpe moras,
for instance, is-

only I don't believe it's English-there, I am as bad as you are to
discuss such a question now. And I am quite sure Jenny can't tell
a good story soundly. And he has got such ferret eyes! Thank
Heaven, the key was inside, John.”
Poor Miss Doxy was panting so, that her brother was quite
frightened for her; and the more so because he had no idea what
there was to be frightened at.
Why, Doxy," he said, “my darling, he need never see that you
have cut me."
“ As if I cared for that! Oh, John, my dearest brother, he'll see
that I've cut your hair !"
The idea struck Mr. Rosedew as so gloriously novel—that man
who knew.the world so !-to him it appeared such a mountain of
wonder that a sister should want to sink through the floor, for
having saved her brother from barberism, that he laughed as hard
as any man of real humour ever laughs. Miss Doxy stole on the
opportunity, when he sat down to have his laugh out, to dust a little
white hair with her handkerchief from his coat-collar.
Suddenly the rector arose, and his laugh went away in
gravity. He walked to the door more heavily than was natural to
ħim (lest he should seem to go falsely), unlocked and unbolted it,
and in his most stately manner marched into the hall. Jenny was
telling a "jolly lie”-jollity down below, perhaps--to Mr. Rufus
Hutton; she was doing it very clumsily, not “oculo irretorto.”
“ Please sir, yes, my master is gone round the parish, sir; and the
rest, they be at the school, sir. How sorry they will be, to be sure,
to hear that you have called, sir, and all of them out of the way so!”
“No, they won't,” said Mr. Rosedew, looking over her head;
“the only thing I am sorry for, Jenny, is that you can tell a false-
hood so.
But the fault is not yours only. I will talk to you by and
by. Dr. Hutton, come in, if you please. I was having iny hair cut
by my sister, Miss Rosedew. You have met her before. Eudoxia,
Dr. Hutton is kind enough to come and see us. I have told him
how good and how sisterly you have been to me, and I am sure that
he must wish to have a sister so capable—that is to say if he has
not,” added John, who was very particular about his modal and
temporal prefix.
Miss Rosedew came forward, with a few white hairs still on her
dark reps " bell-sleeve, and, being put upon her inettle, was
worthy of her brother. Rufus Hutton, of course, not being quite a
fool, respected, and trusted, and loved them both, more than he
would have done after fifty formal dinners. And he knew quite
well that there was on his own part something akin to intrusion :
for he had called in the forenoon, when visits from none but an in-
timate friend are expected ; and he had pushed his advance rather
vigorously, not towards the drawing-room, but to the parson's
favourite book-room, where the lady Licinus plied her calling. But

279
for this he had good reason, as he wished to see Mr. Rosedew alone,
and the cause of his visit was urgent.
It was not long before the lady withdrew in a very
noble manner,
earning gratitude of Rufus. Then the doctor drew his chair close
home to the parson's, looked all round the room, and coughed to
try how big the echo was. Finding no response returned by that
prolific goddess, who loves not calf or sheep-skin, and seeing that
no other lady was dangerously acoustic, Rufus inclined his little red
head towards Mr. Rosedew's great and black and slightly dog.eared
waistcoat, and spake these winged words :-
“ Ever see a thing like that, sir ?”
“No, I don't think I ever did. Dear me, how odd it smells !
Why, how grave you are, Dr. Hutton!”
“So will you be, when I have told you what I have to tell.
My discovery is for your ears only ; I have been to London about
it, and there found out its meaning. Now I will act upon your ad-
vice. Nothing in all my experience-though I have seen a great
deal of the world-nothing has ever surprised me more than what
I have told you."
“But you forget, Dr. Hutton," cried John, imbibing excitement,
“that as yet you have told me nothing at all, only shown me some-
thing which I cannot in the least make out. A cylinder, hollow,
and blocked at one end; of a substance resembling book-binding,
and of a most unsavoury odour !"
“Ha!” replied Rue Hutton, “ha, my dear sir, you little guess
the importance of that thing no bigger than a good cigar. Ah,
indeed! ah, yes !”
“Do you mean to tell me, or not, Dr. Hutton? Your behaviour
is most unusual. I am greatly surprised by your manner.'
" Ah, no doubt; no doubt of that. Very odd if you were not.
also am astonished at your apparent indifference.”
Hereupon Rufus looked. so intensely knowing, so loaded with
marvel and mystery, too big to be discharged even, that John Rose-
dew himself, so calm and large, and worthy to be called a philoso-
pher, very nearly grew wroth with longing to know what all the
Then Dr. Hutton, having bound him by an urgent entreaty that
he would not for the present even hint of that matter to any one,
poured out the hissing contents of his mind under the white curls
which still overhung the elder man’s porch of memory. And what
he told him was indeed a thing not to be forgotten.
The spectator is said to see more of the game than any of the
players see, and the reader of a story knows a great deal more than
the actors do, or the writer either, for that matter; marry, there-

Hutton's faith, for he is an awkward enemy.

Rosedew, Nowel-house, somewhere in England.” Much as
abuse the Post-office people, they generally manage to find us out
more cleverly than we do them; and so this letter had not been to
more than six wrong places. As our good journalists love to say,
it was couched in the following terms :-
“ HONOURED AND REVEREND SIR,—Takes the liberty of stating
price of inland coals, as per margin, delivered free within six miles
of Charing Cross. N.B. Weighed as the Act directs, whether re-
quired or otherwise, which mostly is not, and the dust come back if
required. Excuse me the liberty of adding that a nice young gent
and uncommon respectable, only not a good business address-no
blame to him, being an Oxford gent-lie here very ill, and not much
expect to get over to-morrow night. Our junior, Mr. Clinkers, with
full commission to take all orders and sign receipts for the firm,
have been up with him all night, and hear him talk quite agreeable
about some place or business called Amery, supposed in the hard-
ware line by mistake for emery. This young gent were called Mr.
Newman, by the name of Charles Newman, but Mrs. Ducksacre half
believe clandastical and temporal only, and no doubt good reason
for it, because he always pay his lodging. Rev. sir, found your
direction as per endorsement plain as could be in the inside pocket
of the young gent's coat, and he only have one to look in. But for
fear to be misunderstood this firm think none the less of him by the
same reason, having been both of us in trouble as soon as we was
married. Also as per left-hand cover a foreign-looking play-book,
something queer and then 'Opera,' which the undersigned under-
stand at once, having been to that same theayter when our gracious
Queen was married, and not yet gone into the coal-trade. Requests
to excuse the liberty, but if endorsed correctly and agreeable to see
the young gent's funeral performed most reasonably, at sole expense
of this firm, and no claim made on any survivors because Robert
Clinkers like him, must come by express day after to-morrow at
latest.

CHAPTER XLIII.
KIND FRIENDS, BUT NO ANGEL
CRADOCK NOWELL had written from London to the Parsonage
once, and once only. He told them how he had changed his name,
because his father had cast him off ; and (as he bitterly added), ac-
cording to filial duty, he felt himself bound to be Nowell no longer.
But he did not say what name he had taken, neither did he give any
address ; only he would write again when he had found some good
situation. Of course he longed to hear from Amy-his own loving
Amy, who begged that poor letter and bore it in her own pure
bosom long after the Queen's head came off—but his young pride
still lay hot upon him, and for Amy's sake he nursed it.
A young man is never so proud of his honour, so prompt to deny
himself any thing, so strong in another's lifehold, and careless about
his own living, as when he has won a true love's worth, and sees it
abiding for ever. Few are the good who have such luck-for the
success is not of merit, any more than it is in other things; more
often indeed some fish-tailed coxcomb is a woman's Dagon, doubly
worshipped for crushing her—but when that luck does fall to the
lot of a simple and honest young fellow, he piles his triple mountains
up to the everlasting heaven, but makes no Babel of them. A man
who chatters about his love does not deserve to have any.
The rector, upon the receipt of that letter, shut every book on
his table, chairs, and desk, and chimney-piece. He must think
what to do, and how: and he never could think hard on the flints
of daily life, while the green pastures of the dead were tempting his
wayward steps away.
Of course he would go to London at once, by the very next train;
but whether or no should he tell his people the reason of his going ?
He felt so strongly inclined to tell, even at risk of domestic hysterics
and parochial convulsions, that he resolved at last not to tell ; for
he thought of the great philosopher's maxim (not perhaps irrefrag-
able), that when the right hangs dubious, we may safely conclude
that it rides in the scale swinging opposite to our own wishes. To
most of us (not having a quarter of John Rosedew's ability, and
therefore likely to be a hundred times less hesitant) it seems that the
maxim holds good with ourselves, or any other common mortal, but
makes Truth actually cut her own throat when applied to a mind
like his—a mind already too timorously and humorously self-
conscious.
Let 99,000 angels get on the top of John Rosedew's pen—which
generally had a great hair in it-and dance a faux pas over that
question, if it was laid the wrong way ; for we, whose consciences
must work in corduroys and highlows, roughly conclude that right

and wrong are but as button and button-hole when it comes to a
question of hair-splitting. Blest are they whose conscience-edge,
like the sword of Thor, can halve every wisp of wool that floateth
down the rapid stream of life.
After breakfast Mr. Rosedew mounted his Coræbus, leaving a
short farewell, and set off hastily with the old-fashioned valise be-
hind the saddle, wherein he was wont to bear wine and confections
upon his parochial tours. The high-mettled steed was again amazed
at the pace that could be pumped out of him ; neither did he long
continue ingloriously mute, but woke the echoes of Ytene with many
a noble roar and shriek, so that consternation shook the heart of deer
and pig and cow. But the parson did not exult as usual in these
proofs of velocity, because his soul within him was sad; neverthe-
less he preserved cohesion, or at least coincidence, in an admirable
manner, with his feet thrust strenuously into the stirrups, his bridle-
hand thrown in great emergencies upon the peak of the saddle, and
whip-hand reposing on the leathern outwork, which guarded and
burnished his rear. Anchored thus by both strong arms-for the
sake of his mission and family—he feſt capable of jumping a gate
if Coræbus had equal confidence.
That evening he entered the Ducksacre shop, and found no one
there but the mistress.
Pray excuse me, but I have been told, ma'am," said Mr. Rose-
dew, lifting his hat-as he always did to a matron-and, bowing
his silvery head," that you have a lodger here who is very ill.”
Yes, sir," replied Mrs. Ducksacre, fetching her breath very
quickly, “and dead, too, for all I know. Oh Lord, I am so put
The soft-hearted parson was shocked at this apparent apathy
and thought her no true woman. Who is not wrong sometimes ?
It was a very rare thing for John Rosedew to judge man or woman
harshly. But only half an hour ago that poor woman had been
up-stairs, neglecting till, present and future, estranging some ex-
cellent customers, leaving a wanton shop-boy to play marbles with
Spanish chestnuts, while she did her most misguided best to
administer to sick Cradock soup wildly beyond her own economy,
and furiously beyond his powers of deglutition.
Mr. Rosedew, with his stout legs shaking, and his stockings
expressing excitement, went up three pairs (ill-assorted) of stairs
into Cradock's sick-room. Then he started back from the Aristo-
phanic climax-even the rags of Telephus; though, after all, Polly
Ducksacre had done her best to make the room comely. Why,
there were three potato-sacks on the bed, with the names of Fulham
growers done in red letters upon them, and giving the room quite
a bright appearance, as if newly-marked sheep were in it. Nay,
and a gardening nan might swear there were two bast mats
from Covent Garden, gloriously fixed as bed curtains, mats from
upon!"

that open iwarket where a rat prays heaven vainly to grant him the
coat of a water-rat.
There, by Cradock Nowell's bed, sat the faithful untiring nurse,
the woman who had absorbed such a quantity of strap, and had so
kindly assimilated it. Meek-spirited Rachael Jupp waited and
watched by the bed of him through whom she had been enfranchised.
Since Issachar Jupp obtained conversion, she had not tasted the
buckle-end once, and scarcely twice the tongue-end.
Mrs. Jupp had been employed years ago as a nurse in the Middle-
sex Hospital; so she knew her duties thoroughly. But here she
had exceeding small chance of practising that knowledge; because
scarcely any thing which she wanted, and would have rung for, if
there had been any bell, was ever to be found in the house. Even
hot water, which the doctor had ordered, was cold again ere it came
to her, and had taken an hour before it started; for there was no
fireplace in the little room, nor even on the floor below it.
Uncle John could scarcely keep from tears, as he looked at poor
Craddy propped up in the bed there, with his lips so pale and blood-
less, cheeks sunken in and shining like dry oyster-shells, but with a
round red spot in the centre, large eyes glaringly bright and starting,
and red-hot temples and shorn head swathed with dripping bandages;
while now and then he raised his weak hands towards the surging
tumult, and dropped them helpless on the sun-blind, tucked round
him as part of his counterpane.
“Ah, that's the way, sir,” said Rachel, after she had risen and
curtsied," that's the way he go on now, all the day and all the night;
and he have left off talking now for two days only to moan and to
wamble. He used to jump up in the bed at first, and shut his left
eye, and put his arms like this, as if he was shooting at something;
and it pleased him so when I give him Mrs. Ducksacre's hair-
broom. He would put the flat of it to his shoulder, and smile as if
he see some game, and shoot at the door fifty times a day; and
then scream and fall back and cover his eyes up. But he haven't
done that these three days now; too weak, I'm afeard, too weak
for it."
John Rosedew sighed heavily for the bright young mind, so tried
above what it was able to bear; then, as he kissed the flaming fore-
head-sometimes flaming and sometimes icy-he thought that it
might be the Father's mercy to obliterate sense of the evil. For the
mind of the insane, or at least its precious part, is with Him, who
showers afar both pain and pleasure, but keeps at home the happi-
“ Can you send for the doctor at once, ma'am, or tell me where
to find him?” The parson still kept to the ancient fashion, and
addressed every woman past thirty as “ma'am," whatever her rank
or condition.
As he spoke, a heavy man entered on tiptoe, and quietly moved
ness.

taw is, or used to be, shaded, with keen artistic feeling, in many a
ring concentric, from the equator to the poles. Mr. Jupp's face was
a villanous one; as even the softest philanthropist would have been
forced to acknowledge. The enormous jaws, the narrow forehead,
the grisly, porkish eyebrows, the high cheek-bones, and the cunning
skance gleam from the black, deep-ambushed squinters—all these
were enough to warn any man who wished to get good out of Zakey
Jupp that he must try to put it there first, and give it time to go to
the devil and come back; as they say that parsley-seed does.
Mr. Jupp was a man of remarkable strength,-not active elastic
Achillean vigour, nor even stalwart Ajacian bulk, but the sort of
strength which sometimes vanquishes both of those, by outlasting,
-a slouching, slow-to-come, long-to-go power, that had scarcely
found its proper wind when better-built men were exhausted.
Men of this stamp are usually long-armed, big in the lungs and
shoulders, small in the loins, knock-kneed, and splay-footed; in a
word, shaped like a John Dory, or a miller's thumb, or a banjo.
They are not very “strong on their pins," nor active ; they generally
get thrown in the first bout of wrestling before ever their muscles get
warm; they cannot even run fast, and in jumping they spring from
the heel; nevertheless, unless they are stricken quite senseless at
the outset-and their heads for the most part are a deal too thick for
that-the chances are that they make an example of the antagonist
ere he is done with.
And so, in Mr. Jupp's recent duello with an Irish bully, who
scoffed at Cradock, and said something low of his illness, the Eng-
lishman got the worst of it in the first round, the second, the third,
and the fourth ; but, just as Dan Sullivan's pals and backers were
wild with delight and screeching, the brave bargee settled down on
his marrow, and the real business began. After twenty-five rounds,
the Tipperary Slasher had three men to carry him home, and looked
fit for an inquest to sit upon, without making him any flatter.
Now, Issachar being a very slow man, there was no chance that
he would hurry over his present inspection of Cradock. For a very
long time he looked at him from various points of view ; then, at
last, he shook his head, and poked his long black chin out.
“Now this here wunna do, ye know. I'll fetch the doctor to ye,
master, as ye seem to care for the pore young charp.”
And Zakey Jupp, requiring no answer, went slowly down the
stairs, with a great hand on either wall to save noise ; then at
a long trot, rolling over all who came in his way, and rounding the
corners, like a ship whose rudder-bands are broken, he followed the
doctor from street to street, keeping up the same pacę till he found

him. Dr. Tink was coming out of a court not far from Marylebone-
lane, where the small-pox always lay festering.
“ Ye'll just corm street 'long wi' me to the poor charp as saved our
Looey," said Mr. Jupp, coolly getting into the brougham, and sitting
in the place of honour, while he dragged Dr. Tink in by the collar,
and set him upon the front seat. “Fire awa' now for Martimer-
straat,” he yelled to the wondering coachman, “and if ye dunna
laither the narg, mind, I'll laither ye when we gits there."
The nag was leathered to Mr. Jupp's satisfaction, and far beyond
his own, and they arrived at the coal and cabbage shop before John
Rosedew had finished reading a paper which Mrs. Jupp had shown
him, thinking that it was a prescription.
“ He wrote it in his sleep, sir, without knowing a thing about it;
in his sleep, or in his brain-wandering ; I came in and found him at
it, in the middle of the night ; and my, how cold his fingers was, and
his head so hot! We took it to three great chemists' shops, but
they could not make it up. They hadn't got all the drugs, they said,
and they couldn't make out the quantities."
“ Neither can 1,” said John ; “ but it rings well, considering that
the poor boy wrote it when his brain was weak with fever. The
dialects are somewhat muddled, moreover ; but we must not be
hypercritical."
No, sir, to be sure not. I am sure I meant no hypocrisy. Only
you see it ain't Christian writing ; and Mr. Clinkers shake his head
at it, and say it come straight from the devil, and his hoof in every
line of it."
“ Mrs. Jupp, the Greek characters are beautiful, though some of
the lines are not up to the mark. But, for my part, I wonder how
any man can write mixed Greek in London. Nevertheless, I shall
have great pleasure in talking it over with him, please God that he
ever gets well. To think that his poor weary brain should still be
hankering after his classics !”
It was the dirge in Cymbeline put into Greek choral metre, and
John Rosedew's tears flowed over the words, as Polydore's had done,
and Cadwal's.
Unhappy Cradock! His misty brain had vapoured off in that
sweet wild dirge, which hovers above, as if the freed soul lingered,
for the clogged one to shake its wings to it.
The parson was pondering and closing his wet eyes to recover his
faith in God—whom best we see with the eyes shut, except while
His stars are shining—when Issachar Jupp came up the stairs,
poking Dr. Tink before him, because he still thought it likely that
the son of medicine would evaporate. The doctor, who knew his
tricks and put up with them, lest any thing worse might come of it,
solaced his sense of dignity, when he got to the top, by a grand bow
to Mr. Rosedew. John gave him the change in a kind one; then
offered his hand, as he always did, being a man of the ancient fashion.

While they were both looking sadly at Cradock, he sat up sud-
denly in the bed, and stretching forth his naked arms (wherein was
little nourishment), laughed as an aged man does, and then nodded
at them solemnly. His glazed eyes were so prominent, that their
whites reflected the tint of the rings around them.
“ Ladies and gentlemen, stop him if you please, and give him a
pen and ink, and let him have my hat to write on. Oh, don't let
him go by."
Stop whom, my dear sir ?” asked the doctor, putting out his
arms as if to do it. "Now I've stopped him. What's his name?”
“The golden lad. Oh, don't you know? You can't have got him,
if you don't. The golden lad that came from heaven to tell me I
did not do it, that I didn't do it, do it, sir-all a mistake altogether.
It makes me laugh, I declare it does ; it makes me laugh for an
hour, every time he comes, because they were all so wise. All but
my Amy, my Amy; she was such a foolish little thing, she never
would hear a word of it. And now I call you all to witness, obtestor,
antestor, one, two, three, four, five; let him put it down on a sheet
of foolscap, with room enough for the names below it; all the
ladies and gentlemen put their names in double column, and get
Mr. Clinkers, if you can, and Jenny, to go at the bottom; only be
particular about the double column, ladies one side, gentlemen the
other, like a country dance, you know, or the carmen sæculare,'
and at the bottom, right across, Miss Amy Rosedew's name."
The contemplation of that last beatitude was too much for the
poor fellow; he fell back, faint on the pillow, and the shop-blind,
untucked by his blissful emotions, rattled its rings on the boards of
the floor,
“Blow me if I can stand it,” cried Issachar Jupp, going down
three stairs at a step ; and when he came back his face looked
clearer, and he said something about a noggin. Mrs. Ducksacre
bolted after him, for business must be attended to.
“Will he ever be right again, poor fellow? Dr. Tink, I implore
you to tell me your opinion sincerely."
“Then I cannot say that I think he will. Still, I have some hopes
of it. Much will depend upon the original strength of the cerebel-
lum, and the regularity of his previous habits. If he has led a wild,
loose life, he has no chance whatever of sanity.”
“No, he has led a most healthy life-temperate, gentle, and
equable. His brain has always been clear and vigorous, without
being too creative. He was one of the soundest scholars for his age
I have ever met with."
“ But he had me terrible blow, eh?”
“ The most terrible blow any man can have."
Mr. Rosedew thought what a terrible blow it would be to himself,
and his own life's life, if the issue went against them.
It was not a thing to be talked about with a stranger, or even

with any man. It was one of those cases where nothing is left,
except to wait, and watch, and trust, as men who have faith are
enabled to do.
CHAPTER XLIV.
LOST IN THE FOREST
The good people gathered in Nowelhurst church were agreeably
surprised, on the following Sunday, by the announcement from Mr.
Pell—in that loud sonorous voice of his, which had frightened
spinsters out of their wits, lest he were forbidding, instead of asking
their banns of matrimony-that there would be no sermon that
morning, inasmuch as he, the Rev. Octavius, was forced to hurry
away, at full speed, to assuage the rampant desire of Rushford for
the performance of divine service.
Mrs. Nowell Corklemore, who had the great curtained pew of the
Hall entirely to herself and child—for Eöa never would go to
church, because they defy the devil there--Georgie, who appeased
her active mind by counting the brass-headed nails in the baize,
and then multipłying them into each other, and subtracting the
ones that were broken, lifted her indescribable eyes, and said,
“Thank God," almost audibly.
Octavius Pell, hurrying out of the porch, ascended Coræbus, as
had been arranged; but he did it so rapidly, and with such an air
of decision, that Amy, standing at the churchyard gate, full of
beautiful misgivings, could not help exclaiming, —
“ Oh please, Mr. Pell, whatever you do, leave your stick here till
Monday. We will take such care of it.”
“Indeed, I fear I must not, Miss Rosedew," Octavius answered,
gravely, looking first at his stick, and then at the flanks of Ræby,
who was full of interesting tricks ; " I have so far to go, you know,
and I must try to keep time with them. Whoa, you little villain !"
“Oh, dear, I am so sorry, At any rate please not to strike him,
only stroke him with it. He is so very high-spirited. And he has
never had a weal upon him, at least since James Pottes was stopped
from riding. And I could not bear to see it. And I know you
won't, Mr. Pell.”
Octavius looked at the soft-hearted girl, blushing so in her new
drawn bonnet-mauve with black, for the sake of poor Clayton. He
looked at her out of his knowing dry eyes in that sort of response-
to-the-Litany style which a curate adopts to his rector's daughter.

“Can you suppose, Miss Rosedew, that I would have the heart
to beat him now ?-Ah, you will, will you then ?” Ræbus thought
better of it.
No, I hope you would not,” said Amy, in pure good faith, with a
glance, however, at the thick bamboo,“ because it would be so cruel.
It is hollow, I hope ; but it has such knots, and it looks so very
hard !
“Hollow, and thin as a piece of pie-crust; and you know how
this wood splits."
Oh, I am so glad, because you can't hurt him so very much.
Please not to go, if you can hold him, more than three miles and a
half an hour. Papa says that is the pace that always keeps him in
his best condition. And please to take the saddle off, and keep it
at your house, that the Rushford boy may not ride him back. And
please to choose a steady boy from the head-class in your Sunday
school, and, if possible, a communicant. But I'm sadly afraid
there's no trusting the boys.”
“Indeed, I fear not,” said Octavius, gravely; and adding to him-
self, “at any rate when you are concerned, you darling. What a.
love you are ! But there's no chance for me, I know; and it's a
good job for me that I knew it. Oh you little angel, I wonder who
the lucky fellow is !” Aunt Eudoxia had dropped him a hint, quite
in a casual way, when she saw that the stout young bachelor was
going in, over head and ears.
Sweet Amy watched Mr. Pell, or rather his steed, with fond in-
terest, until they turned the corner ; and certainly the pace, so far,
was very sedate indeed. Octavius was an upright man-you could
see that by his seat in the saddle-as well as a kind and good-
natured one ; and on no account would he have vexed that gentle
and beautiful girl. Nevertheless he grew impatient, as Coræbus
pricked his ears pretentiously, and snorted so as to defy the winds,
and was fain to travel sidewise, as if the distance was not enough
for him ; and all the time he was swallowing the earth at the rate
of no more than four miles an hour. Then the young parson pulled
out his watch, and saw that it wanted but half an hour of the time
himself had fixed for the morning service at Rushford. And he
could not bear the thought of keeping the poor folk waiting about
the cross, as they always did and would wait, till the parson appeared
among them. As Mr. Wise has well observed, “the peasant of the
New Forest is too full of veneration."
And here let the present writer acknowledge, as behoveth a man
to do, not in a scambling preface, which nobody ever would read,
but in the body of this work, great and loving obligation to the la-
bours of Mr. John R. Wise. His book is perfectly beautiful, written
in admirable English, full of observation, taste, and gentle learning;
and the descriptions of scenery are such that they make the heart
yearn to verify them. Knowing the forest well, one could not love

it so truly and clearly, without the aid of that agreeable and adroit
interpreter.
“ The Rev. Mr. Pell,” as some people write when addressing a
parson,-hoping still to keep faith with Amy, because her eyes were
so lovely,-pulled the snaffle, and turned Coræbus into a short cut,
through beeches and hazels. Then compromise came to a short, sharp
end, and the big bamboo was compelled to fall upon the fat flank of
Coræbus, because he would not go without it. He showed sense of
that first attention only by a little buck-jump, and a sprightly wag
of his tail ; then, hoping that the situation need not be looked in
the face, shambled along at five miles an hour, with a mild respon-
sibility.
“Five miles more,” said Octave Pell, “and only twenty minutes
to do it in ! It's an unlucky thing for you, Coræbus, that your
mistress is engaged.” Whack, came the yellow bamboo again, and
this time in solid earnest; Ræbus went off as if he meant to go mad.
He had never known such a blow since the age wherein he
belonged to the innkeeper. How could a horse with four feeds a
day be expected to put up with tyranny ?
But, to the naggy's great amazement, Octave Pell did not tumble
off; more than that, he seemed to stick closer, with a most un-
pleasant embrace, and a pressure that told upon the wind—not of
heaven but of horse--till the following symptoms appeared :-First
a wheeze, and creak internal, a slow creak, like leather chafing, or a
pair of bellows out of order; then a louder remonstrance, like the
ironwork of a roller, or the gudgeons of a wheelbarrow; then, faster
and faster, a sucking noise, like the bucket of an old pump, when
the gardener works by the job; finally, puff, and roar, and shriek,
with notes of passing sadness, like the neap-tide wailing up a
cavern, or the lament of the Berkshire Blowing Stone.
In forest glades, where hollow hoofs fell on the sod quite mutely,
that roar was enough to try masculine courage, though never un-
nerved by a heart-shock. How then could poor Pearl Garnet,
sitting all alone, in a lonely spot, wherein she had pledged herself
to her dead love, sitting there to indulge her tears, the only luxury
left her-how could she help being frightened to death as the
unearthly sound approached her?
The terror was mutual. Coræbus, turning the corner sharply,
stopped short, in a mode that must have sent his true master over
his withers, to explore the nature of the evil. Then he shook all
through, and would have bolted, if the bamboo had not fallen heavily.
In the niche of a hollow oak was crouching, falling backward with
terror, and clutching at the brave old bark, yet trying to hide behind
it-only the snowy arms would come outwards—a beautiful girl,
clad in summer white on that foggy day of December. The brown
cloak, which had protected her from sylvan curiosity, lay on the
ground, a few yards away, on the spot so sad and sacred.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Pearl Garnet's grief, if we knew the whole of it, or perhaps
because we cannot, was greater than any girl could bear. A lovely,
young, and loving maid, with stores of imagination, yet a practical
power of stowing it ; of building castles, yet keeping them all within
compass of the kitchen-range ; quite different from our Amy, yet a
better wife for some men-according to what the trumps are, and
Amy must have hearts, or she dies ;-that very nice girl, we have
let her go weep, and never once cared to follow her. There is
never any justice in this world; therefore who cares to apologize ?
It would take up all our business-time, if we did it properly.
Now, as she stretched her white arms forth, and her delicate form
shrunk back into the black embrace of the oak-tree; while her rich
hair was streaming all down her breast, and her dark eyes still full
of tear-drops; the rider no less than the horse was amazed, and
seemed to behold a vision. Then as she shrunk away into the tree-
bole, with a shriek of deadly terror-for what love casteth out fear?
-and she saw not through the ivy-screen, and Coræbus groaned
sepulchrally, Pell came down with a dash on one foot, and went,
quick jump, to help her.
In a fainting fit--for the heart so firm and defiant in days of
happiness was fluxed now and frail with misery-she was cowering
away in the dark tree-nook, like the pearls of mistletoe fallen, with
her head thrown back (such an elegant head, a woman's greatest
beauty), and the round arms hanging helpless.
Hereupon Mr. Pell was abroad. He had never experienced any
sisters, nor much mother consciously-being the eighth son, as of
course we know, of a jolly Yorkshire baronet ; at any rate he had
lost his mother at the birth of Nonus Pell; and it is a loss to the
age that there were not ninety of them, if of equal merit.
So Octavius stood like a fish out of water, with both hands in his
pocket, as it is so generally the habit of fishes to stand.
Then, meaning no especial harm, nor perhaps great good, for that
matter, he said to himself,
“ Confound it all. What the deuce am I to do ?”
His sermon upon the Third Commandment, about to be preached
at Rushford, where the fishermen swore like St. Peter,--that sermon
went crack in his pocket at such a shocking ejaculation. Never
heeding that, he went on to do what a stout fellow and a gentleman
must have done in this emergency. He lifted the drooping figure
forth into the open air, touching it only with his hands. timidly and
reverently, as if every fair curve were sacred. Then he fetched
water in his best Sunday hat-the only chimney-pot he possessed
--from the stream trickling through the spire-bed; and he sprinkled
it on the broad, white forehead, as if he were christening a baby.
The moment he saw that her life was returning, and her deep
grey eyes, quiet havens of sorrow, opened and asked where their
owner was, and her breast rose like a billow in a place where two

tides meet, that moment Octave laid her back against the rugged
trunk, in the thick brown cloak which he had fetched when he went
for the water; and wrapped it around her, delicately, as if she were
taking a nap there.
Oh, man of short pipes and hard, bachelor fare, for this thou
deservest as good a wife as ever basted a leg of mutton !
At last the young lady looked up at him with a deep-drawn sigh,
and said, -
“I am afraid I have been very silly.”
No, indeed, you have not. But I am very sorry for you, because
I am dreadfully clumsy."
She glanced at his snowy choker-which he seldom wore save on
Sundays-and, being a very quick-witted young woman, she guessed
at once who he was.
“Oh, please to tell me,I hope the service is not over at Nowel-
hurst church."
“ The service has been over for a quarter of an hour; because
there was no sermon.
“Oh, what shall I do, then ? What can I do? I had better
never go home again.”
This was said to herself in anguish, and Pell saw that he was not
meant to hear it.
“ Can I go, please, to the Rectory? Mr. Rosedew is from home;
but I'm sure they will give me shelter until my—until I am sent for.
I have lost my way in the wood here."
This was a very strange thing to be done by a clever young lady
so near to her home; and Mr. Pell began to think that she must
have come from Southampton; whence. come many people, and
contrive to get lost in the forest.
“To be sure," said the hasty parson, forgetting about the Rush-
ford bells, the rheumatic clerk, and the quid-chewing pilots-let
them turn their quids a bit longer~"to be sure, I will take you at
once to the Rectory. Allow me to introduce myself. How very
stupid of me! Octavius Pell, Mr. Rosedew's curate at Rush-
ford.”
Hereupon “ Pello, pepuli, pulsum” (as his friends loved to call
him from his driving powers at cricket, and to show that they knew
some Latin) executed a noble salaam-quite of the modern school,
however, and without the old reduplication (like the load on the
back of Christian) till the duckweed came out of his hat in a body,
and fell into the flounce tucket of the beautiful Pearl's white skirt.
She never looked, though she knew it was there—that girl under-
stood her business—but curtseyed to him prettily, having recovered
strength by this time; and there was something in his dry, manly
tone, curt modesty, and breeding, without any flourish about it,
which led the young maid to trust him, as if she had known him
since tops and bottoms.

“I am Pearl Garnet,” said she, imitating his style unconsciously,
the daughter-I mean I live at Nowelhurst Dell Cottage.”
Coræbus had cut off for stable long ago, with three long weals
from bamboo upon him, which he vowed he would show to Amy.
“Please to take my arm, Miss Garnet. You are not very strong
yet. I know your brother well; and a braver or more straightfor-
ward
young fellow never thought small things of himself after doing
great ones.
Pearl was delighted to hear Bob's praises ; and Mr. Pell treated
that subject so cleverly, from every possible point of view, that she
was quite astonished when she saw the Rectory side-gate,' and
Octavius, in the most light-hearted manner, made a sudden and
warm farewell, and darted away for Rushford. How good it is for
a sad, heavy heart to exchange with a gay and light one!
Hang it! after that let me have a burster ?" was his clerical
ejaculation, “or else it is all up with me. I hope we haven't spilt
the sermon, though, or got any duckweed down it. Duckweed,
indeed; what a duck she is! And oh, what splendid eyes !”
He ran all the way to Rushford, at a pace unknown to Coræbus ;
and his “governor-coat” flew away behind him, with the sermon
banging about, and the text peeping out under the pocket-lap.
“Swear not at all,” were the words, I believe; and a rare good
sermon it must have been, if it stuck to the text under the circum-
stances.
The jolly old tars, after waiting an hour, orally refreshing their
grandmothers' epitaphs, and close-hauling on many a tight yarn,
were just setting up stun'sails to take grog on board at the “ Lug-
ger's Locker," hard by, as the banyan time was over. Let them
ship their grog, and their old women might keep gravy hot, and be
blessed to them. They had come there for sarvice, and shiver their
timbers if they'd make sail till the chaplain came. Good faith, and
they got their service at last, but an uncommonly short-winded one,
a sermon, moreover, which each man felt coming admirably home
--to his shipmate.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pell had left behind him no small excitement at
Nowelhurst. For a rumour took wing after morning service—when
the wings of fame are briskest in all country parishes—that parson
John was gone to London to complain to the Queen that Sir
Cradock Nowell never came to church now, nor even sent his
agent thither, to manage matters for him. For Mr. Garnet still
retained his stewardship among them, though longing to be quit of
it, and discharging his duties silently, and not with his old pro-
nouncement, because his health was weaker. The vivid power of
vital force seemed to be failing the man who had stamped his
character on all the folk around him ; because he never said a thing
which he did not think, and scarcely ever thought a thing with any
ear of saying it.

THE MURDERER'S TREE.

Hitherto we have had of Bull Garnet by far the worst side upper-
most. Let us offer no excuses now for his too ready indulgence of
his far too savage temper. In sooth, we meet with scarce any case
in which excuses are undiscoverable. God and the angels find them
always; our best earthly friends can see them, when properly pointed
out; our enemies, when they want to make accusation of them.
All we can say for Bull Garnet is (to invert the historian's sen-
tence) “Hæc tanta viri vitia ingentes virtutes exæquabant”—“These
blemishes, however dark, had grand qualities to redress them.”
Strong affection, great scorn of falsehood, tenderness almost too
womanly, liberality both of mind and heart, a real depth of sym-
pathy-would all these co-exist with, or be lost in, one great vice?
Possibly we are so indentured, spliced and mortised, dovetailed,
double-budded, and inarched, both of good and evil, that the wrong,
instead of poisoning the right, often serves as rich food to it.
Nevertheless we had better be perfect—when we have found the
way out,
CHAPTER XLV.
THE MURDERER'S TREE.
It must not be forgotten that Rufus Hutton all this time was very
hard at work, and so was Mrs. Corklemore. Between that lady and
Eöa pleasant little passes gave a zest to daily intercourse, Georgie's
boundless sympathies being circumscribed only by terror. Never-
theless, although Sir Cradock laughed (when his spirits were good,
and his mind was clear) at their fundamental difference, Georgie
began to gain upon him, and Eöa to lose ground. How could it be
otherwise, even if their skill had been equal—and Eöa not only had
no skill, but scorned sweet Georgie for having any–how could Mrs.
Corklemore fail of doing her blessed duty, when she was in the
house all day, and Eöa out, jumping the river, or looking about for
Bob Garnet ?
Whatever the weather was, out went Eöa, speering around for
the tracks of Bob, which, like those of a mole, were self-evident ;
and then hiding behind a great tree when she found him; and
hoping, with Autter of heart about it, that Bob had not happened to
see her. Yet, if he happened not to see, she would go up and be
cross with him, and ask whether Amy Rosedew had turned to the
right or left there, or had stopped in a hollow tree. And did Bob
think she looked well that morning? Then he had no right to think
so. And perhaps her own new hat, with black ostrich, was a
hideously ugly thing. Oh, she only wished there were tigers !

Leave the little dear to do exactly as she likes—for nothing else
she will do ; and now, in looking through the forest, grey and white
with winter, scorn we not the grand old trunk, in our gay love of the
mistletoe.
There is a very ancient tree, an oak well known and good of fame,
even at the first perambulation of our legislator king. It stands
upon the bend and brow under which two valleys meet, where a
horse-shoe of the wood has chanced, and water takes advantage.
In the scoop below the tree, two covered brooks fetch round high
places into one another, prattle satisfaction, and steal away for their
honeymoon, without a breeze upon them. This “mark-oak,” last
of seven stout brothers, dwells upon a surge of upland, and com-
mands three valleys, two of which unite below it, and the other
leads them off, welcoming their waters. The grand tree lifts its
proven column, channelled, ramped, and crocketed, flaked with
brown on lines of grey, and bulked with cloud-like ganglions. Then
from the maintop, where is room for fifty archers to draw the bow,
limbs of rugged might arise, spread flat, or straggle downwards.
But the two great limbs of all, the power and main glory, the arms
that reared their pride to heaven, are stricken, riven, and blasted.
Gaping with great holes and rotten, heavily twisted in and out, and
ending in four long scraggy horns, ghastly white in the winter sun;
where the squirrel durst not build, nor the honey-buzzard watch for
prey; this shattered hope of a noble life records the wrath of
Heaven.
The legend is that a turf-cutter having murdered a waylost pedlar,
for the sake of his pack, buried the corpse in this hollow tree, and
sat down on the grave to count his booty. Here, while he was
bending over the gewgaws and the trinkets, which he had taken for
the
poor huckster's word, and which gleamed and flashed
in the August twilight, the vengeance of God fell upon him. In
bodily form God's lightning crashed through the dome of oak above
him, leaped on the murderer's head, and drove him through the
cloven earth, breast to breast on his victim's corpse. You may be
sure that the sons of Ytene, a timid and superstitious race, find small
attractions in that tree, when the shades of night are around it.
John Rosedew did not return on the Monday, nor yet on the
Tuesday, &c. Not even until the last down-train roared through
the Forest on Saturday. Then, as it rushed through the dark night
of winter, throwing its white breath (more strong than our own, and
very little more fleeting) in bracelets on the brown-armed trees, and
in chains on the shoulders of heather, the parson leaned back on
the filthy panels of a second-class carriage, and thought of the scene
he had left.
He had written from. London to Miss Rosedew, insisting, so far
as he ever cared to insist on a little matter, that none at home
should stay up for him, that no one should come to the station to
gold upon

meet him, and that Pell should be begged to hold himself ready for
the Sunday's duty, because Mr. Rosedew would not go home, if any
change should that day befall unlucky Cradock Nowell. Lucky
Cradock, one ought to say, inasmuch as for a fortnight now he had
lost all sense of trouble.
Finding from Dr. Tink that no rapid change was impending,
John Rosedew determined to see his home, and allay his child's
anxiety. Moreover, he felt that his “cure of souls” must need their
Sunday salting. Now walking away from the wooded station that
cloudy Christmas Eve-for Christmas that year fell on Sunday
how grand he found the difference from the dirty coop of London.
The new moon was set, but the clouds began to lift above the
tree-tops, and a faint Aurora flushed and flickered in the far north-
west. Then out came several stars rejoicing, singing in twinkles
their Maker's praise; and some of the sounds that breathe through
a forest, even in the hush of a winter's night, began to whisper peace
and death,
The parson, who feared not his Master's works, and was happiest
often in solitude, trudged along with the leathern valise, and three
paper parcels strapped comfortably upon his ample back. Presently
he began to think of home and his parish cares, and the breadth of
God spread around him; and then from thinking rose unawares into
higher communion, inasmuch as it is a grander thing to feel than
to think of greatness.
And in this humour quietly he plodded his proper course for the
first four miles or so, until he had passed the Dame Slough, near
the Blackwater stream, and was over against Vinney Ridge. But
here he must needs try a short cut, through the Government Woods,
to Nowelhurst, though even in the broad daylight he could scarcely
have found his way there. He thought that, in spite of his orders,
Amy would be sure to stay up for him, and so he must hurry home-
ward.
At a fine brisk pace, for a man of his years, he plunged into the
deep wood, and in five minutes' time he had very little hope of
getting out before daylight.
Have you ever been lost in a great wood at night, alone, and
laden, and weary, where the frithings have not been cut for ten
years, when there is no moon or wind to guide a man, and the stars
glimpse so deceitfully? How the stubs, even if you are so quick-
footed as not to be doubled back by them, or thrown down with
nostrils patulous—how they catch you at the knee with three prongs
apiece, and make you think of white swelling! Then the slip,
where the wet has dribbled from some onscious branch, or sow, or
cow, summer-pasturing, has kept her volutabre. Down you plump,
and your heels alone have chance of going to heaven, because
(unless you are a wonder) you employ such powerful language.
Rising with some difficulty, after doubting if it be worth the while,

and rubbing spitefully ever so long at “the case of the part affected,”
you have nothing for it but to start again, and fall into worse disas-
ters. Going very carefully then you jump from the goading repulse
of a holly into the heart of a hazel-bush-one which has numberless
clefts and tongs, and is hospitable to a bramble. Tumbling out of
it, full of thorns, recalling your Farnaby epigram, and wishing they
had pelted the hazel harder, away you go, quite desperate now,
knowing well that the wood is full of swamps, some of which will
petrify you, under sun-dew and blue campanula, when the summer
comes again.
Through all these pleasing incidents and animating encounters
John Rosedew went ahead, and, too often, a header," until he was
desperately tired, and sat down to think about it. Then he heard
two tawny owls hooting to one another, across at least a mile of trees;
and every forest sound grew clearer in the stillness of the night;
the sharp, sad cry of the marten-cat, the bark of the fox so im-
patient, the rustle of the dry leaves as a weasel or rat skirred over
them, the wing-flap of some sliding bird roused from his roost by
danger, the scratching of claws upon trunks now and then, and the
rubbing of horns against underwood : these and other stranger
noises, stirring the “down of darkness,” moving the sense of lone-
some mystery and of fear indefinite, were abroad on the air (in
spite of Shakespeare) on that Christmas Eve.
John Rosedew laid his burden by, and began to think, or wonder,
what was best to do. Long as he had lived amid the woods, he
knew much more of classic sylvulæ and poetical arundines, than of
the natural greenwood, and the tasselling of morasses.
Bob Garnet would have found his way there, or in any other
English forest, with little hesitation. From his knowledge of all
the epiphytes and their different aspects, the bent of the winter
grasses, the sense which even a bramble has of sun and wind and
rain, he would soon have established his compass, with allowance
for slope and exposure.
The parson sat upon an ants' nest, which had done its work, and
feeling discharged, collapsed with him-a big nest of the largest
British ant, which is mostly found near fir-trees. That nest alone
would have told poor Bob something of his whereabouts ; for there
are not many firs in that part of the forest, and only one clump,
high up on a hill, in the wood where John Rosedew had lost himself.
But the man of great learning was none the wiser, only he felt that
his smallclothes were spoiled, and Mr. Channing's fashionable cut
gone almost as prematurely as the critic who had condemned it.
“Let me now consider," said Mr. Rosedew to himself, for about
the fiftieth time ; "it strikes me at the first sight--though I declare
I can't see any thing-would that I could not feel! for I confess
that these legs are grievous ; but putting aside that view or pur-
view of the question, it strikes me that, having no Antigone to lead

me from this, which certainly is the grove of the Eumenides—there
is another ant gone up my leg—' ingentis formica laboris.' I wish
he wouldn't work so hard, though, and I always have had the im-
pression that they stayed in-doors in the winter. Mem. To consult
Theophrastus, and compare him, as usual, with Pliny. Also look
at the Geoponika, full of valuable hints-why there he is again,
biting very hard or stinging. What says Aristophanes about the
music of the gnats? Indelicate, I fear, as he too often is. Nay,
nay, good ant, if indeed thou art an ant -Why, what is that over
yonder ?
It was a dim light in the great hollow oak," the Murderer's Tree,”
as they called it, not a hundred yards from John Rosedew.
The parson approached it cautiously, for he knew that desperate
men, fierce smugglers, and criminals under a ban, still harboured
sometimes in the Forest. As he drew nearer, the feeble light,
glimmering through the entrance, showed him at once what tree it
was, because the rays glanced through two dark holes under the
bulging and beetling brow, called by woodmen “the eyes of God.”
John Rosedew was as brave a man as ever wept for another's
grief, or with kind words assuaged it. No man could have less
superstition, unless (as some would have us believe) all religion
is superstition. Upon this point we will be persuaded, when we
have seen them live the better, and die the more calmly for holding
it. Yet John Rosedew, so firmly set, so full of faith in his Maker,
so far above childish fears (which spring from the absence of our
Father),—he, who having injured none had no dread of any, yet
drew back and trembled greatly at the sight before him.
A small reflector-lamp, with the wick overhung with fungus, stood
upon a knotted niche in the hollow of the tree. By it, and with
his face and eyes set towards the earth, a tall and powerful man,
stripped to the waist, was leaning, with one great arm beneath his
forehead, and bloody stripes across his back. The drooping of his
figure, the woe in every vein of it, the deep and everlasting despair
in every bone—it was an extremity of our nature, which neither
chisel nor pen may approach, nor even the mind of man conceive,
until it has been through it.
Presently the man upraised his massive head, and scorned him-
self for being so effeminate. He had nearly fainted with the pain ;
what right had he to feel it? Why should his paltry body quail at
a flea-bite lash or so, when body and soul were damned for ever?
But if his form had told of sorrow, great God, what did his face
tell ? He never sighed, nor groaned, nor moaned ; his woe was
beyond such trumpery; he simply took the heavy scourge from the
murderer's grave, upon which it had dropped when the swoon came
over him, and, standing well forth in the black hollow's centre, to
gain full swing for his scorpion thongs, he lashed himself over back
and round breast, with the utmost strength of his mighty arms,

with every corded muscle leaping, but not a sign of pain on his face,
nor a nerve of his body flinching. Then, at last, he fell away, and
allowed himself to moan a little.
Mr. Rosedew would have leaped forward at once, in liis horror
at such self-cruelty, but that he saw who it was, and knew how his
remonstrance would be taken. He knew that Bull Garnet's religious
views were very strange and peculiar, and never must be meddled
with, except at his own request, and at seasonable moments.
Yet he had never dreamed that self-chastisement was part of
them.
“Garnet a wild flagellant !" said the parson to himself; “ well,
I knew that he was an enthusiast, but not that he was such a
fanatic. And how shockingly hard he hits himself! Strong as
Dr. Mastix at Sherborne ; but the doctor took good care never to
hit himself. Upon my word, I must run away. It is too sad to
laugh at. What resolution that man must have! He scarcely feels
those tremendous blows in the agony of his mind. I must reason
with him about it, if I ever find good occasion. With such viola-
tion of His image, God cannot be well pleased.”
Meditating deeply upon this strange affair, the parson plodded
homewards, for now he knew his way, with the Murderer's Oak for
his landmark. At last he saw his quiet home, and gave a very
gentle knock, because it was so late at night.
The door was opened by Amy herself, pale, excited, and jumping.
“Oh, daddy, daddy!" Chock-chock-chock-such a lot of
kisses, and both arms round his neck.
“Corculum, voluptas, glycymelon, anima mea—"
Oh, papa, say "Amy dear, and then I shall know it is you at
last.
Then she laughed, and then she cried, and presently fell to at
kissing again. It was a most unfashionable proceeding altogether.
But allowance must be made for her; because she had never tried
before to get on without her father.
“Oh, you beautiful love of a daddy! I was quite sure you would
come, you know; that you could not leave me any longer; so I
would not listen to a single word any one of the lot of them said.
And I kept the kitchen fire up, and a good fire in your pet room,
dear; and I have got such a supper for you! Now, off with your
coat in a minute, darling. Oh, how poorly you look, my own
father! But we will soon put you to rights again. Aunt Doxy is
gone to bed, hurrah ! and so are Jemima and Jenny. And she
won't have the impudence to come down, with all her hair in the
jelly-bags. So I shall have you all to myself, dada ; and if any one
can deserve you, I do."
My own pet child, my warm-hearted dear,” said John, with great
tears in his eyes ; “I had not the least idea that your mind was so
thoroughly ill-disciplined. We must have a course of choriambics

together, or the heavy trimacrine dimeter, as I have ventured to
name it, about which
“ About which not another short syllable, till you have had a
light tri-mackerel supper, and not even a quasi-cæsura left.”
“Why, Amy, you are getting quite witty !” And John, with one
arm still in his overcoat, looked at her bright eyes wonderingly.
“Papa, can I be otherwise, when my own dad comes home to
me? My learning sparkles at sight of you. Come, quick now, for
fear of my eating you up before you begin your supper, dada. You'll
have it in the kitchen, you know, dear, because it will be so much
nicer; and then a pipe by the book-room fire, and a chat with your
good little daughter. O father, father, mind you never go away
from your own Amy, such a long, long time again.”
John thought to himself that, ere many years, he must go away
from his Amy for much more than a fortnight; but of course he
would not damp her young joy with any such troubles now.
“If you please, my meritorious father, you will come to the door,
and just smell them; and then you will have five minutes allowed
you to put on your dear old dressing-gown, and the slippers worked
by the Vestal virgins; five minutes by the kitchen clock, and not a
book to be touched, mind. Now, don't they just smell lovely? I
put them on when I knew your knock. The first mackerel of the
season, only caught this afternoon. I sent word to Mr. Pell for
them. He can do what he likes with the fishermen. And you
know as well as I do, papa, you can never resist a mackerel.”
When the parson came down, half the table was covered with
some of his favourite authors—not that she meant to let him read,
but only because he would miss his books a great deal more than
the salt-cellar—and the other half she was bleaching, and smooth-
ing, and stroking with a snowy cloth, soft and sleek as her own bare
arms, setting all things in lovely order, and looking at her father
every moment, with the skirt of her frock pinned up, and her glossy
hair dancing jigs on the velvet slope of her shoulders. And she
made him hungrier every moment by savoury word and choice
innuendo.
“Worcester sauce, pa darling, and a little of the very best butter,
not mixed up with flour, you know, but melting on them, like their
native element. Just see how they are browning, and not a bit of
the skin come off. What is it about the rhombus, pa, and when am
I to read Juvenal ?"
“ Never, my child."
“Very well, pa dear, you know best, of course ; but I thought it
was very nice about weighing Hannibal, in the Excerpta. Father,
put that book down; I can't allow any reading. And after supper
I shall expect you to spin me such'a yarn, dear, to wind up the
thread of your great adventures."
“TOAUTÉVELV," said John, calmly, although he was so hungry;

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“the very word poor Cradock used in his rendering of that dirge-
Oh, I forgot ; ah yes, to be sure. A word, I mcan, which expresses
in a figurative and yet homely manner-
Cradock, papa! Oh, father, have you been with him in
London? Oh, how Aunt Doxy has cheated me!
You know very
well, my own father, that you cannot tell me a story. Did you go
to London because poor Cradock was very, very ill ?”
“Yes,” said her father, those soft bright eyes beamed into his so
appealingly; “ my own child, your Cradock is very ill indeed."
Not dead, father? Oh, not dead ?"
“No, my child ; nor in any great danger, I sincerely believe, just
at present.”
"Then eat your supper, pa, while it is hot. I am so glad you
have seen him. I am quite content with that.”
She believed, or she would not have said it. And yet how far
from the truth it was !
“You shall tell me all after supper, my father. Thank God for
His mercies to me. Let none of us be in a hurry, dear.”
Yet Amy, in dishing up the mackerel, had the greatest difficulty
(for her breath came short, and her breast heaved fast) in locking
the sluice-gate of sobs, which would have spoiled her father's
supper.
“My amulet, I cannot eat a morsel while I see your hand shake.
Darling, I must tell you all ; I cannot bear your anxiety.”
The second mackerel, a fish of no manners, instead of curling his
tail at the frying, had glued it to the pan, until a tear of Amy's
fried, and then he let go in a moment. John Rosedew caught his
darling child, and drew her to his knees, with the frying-pan in her
hand; and then he made her look at him, and she tried to show
her eyes dry. Do what she might she could not speak, only to let
her neck rise, and her drooping eyelids tremble.
“My own life's love, I have told you the worst. God is very
good to us. Cradock has been at the point of death, but now he is
better a little. Only his mind is in danger. And it must come
home very slowly, if it comes at all. Now, darling, you know
every thing.
She took his magnificent silvery head between her little white
hands, and kisseå him twice on either brow, but not a single word
she said.
“My own sweet child,” cried her father, slowly passing one arm
around her, and swindling his heart of a smile ; “I am apt to make
the worst of things. Let us try to be braver, or at least to have
more faith.”
She leaped up at that very word, with the dawn of a glorious
smile in her eyes, and she took the frying-pan once again, and
eased out, with a white-handled knife, mackerel No. 3. But, upon
second thoughts, she let him slide into the frizzle again, to keep him

warm and comfortable. Her heart was down very deep just now;
but nevertheless, her father must have and well enjoy his supper.
“Father, I am all right now. Only eat your supper, dear. What
a selfish thing I am !"
Have a bit, my darling heart.”
“Yes, I will have a bit of tail, pa, just to test my cookery: Now
that's what I call frying! Look at the blue upon him, and the crisp
brown shooting over it! Come, daddy, no nonsense, if you please.
I could have eaten all three of them, if I had only been out on the
And
you to come starving from London so! Now No. 3,
papa, if you please.” But she kept her eyes away from his, and
made clever use of her clustering hair.
"How beautifully fresh this ale is! Oh, the stuff they sell in
London! I am almost inclined to consider the result of taking
another half-glass.”
Her quick feet went pat on the cellar-steps, while her father con-
sidered the subject : and back she came not a whit out of breath,
but sweetly fresh and excited.
"Such a race, pa ; because I know of one family of cockroaches,
and half suspect another. They are so very imprudent. Robert
Garnet says that they stay at home, and keep their Christmas
domestically, and I need not run for fear of them, at least till the
end of April. And perhaps he is right, because he knows and
studies every thing nasty. Only I can't believe what he says about
ants, because it contradicts Solomon, who was so very much older.
Now, you paternal darling, let me froth it up for you.”
“Thank the Lord for as good a meal as ever one of His children
was blessed with."
The parson stood up as he said these words, and put his thick
but not large hands together, among the crumbs on the tablecloth.
“Now, if you please, the leastest-double superlative, pa, you
know, like TpóTLOTOS, and something else-oh, they will pluck me at
Oxford !--the very leastest little drop of the old French cognac we
bought for parochial rheumatism, with one thin slice of lemon, an
ebullition of water, and half a knob of sugar.”
Before John could remonstrate, there it was, all winking at him,
and begging to be sniffed before sipping.
“My pet, you are so premature. How can I trust your future ?
You never give me time to consider a subject, even in the first of its
bearings."
“To be sure not, father. You know quite well you would take at
least eight different views of the matter, and multiply them into
eight others of people I never heard of. Now the pipe, dear. You
shall have it here, because it is so much warmer. You know you
can't fill it properly.”
So the parson, happy in having a child who could fill a pipe
better than he could, leaned back in his favourite chair, which Amy

had wheeled in for him, and held his long clay in his left hand,
while his right played with her hair, as she sat at his feet, and
coaxed him.
“Sermon all ready, dear?”
Well, you know best about that, Amy; I always trust you to
arrange them."
Never fear, papa ; leave it to me. What would you do without
me? I have put you out such a beauty, because it is Christmas
Day: one that always makes me cry, because I have heard it so
often. But you must have confidence in me."
“Implicit confidence, my pet. Still I like to run my eyes over
them, for I cannot see as I did. My eyes are getting so old.”
“ I'll kiss them till you can't see one bit, if you dare to say that
again, papa. Old, indeed! They are better than mine. And I
can see the pattern of a lady-bird, all across the room. There was
a lady-bird going up the pane of my bedroom window to-day. At
this time of year, only think! That was good luck, wasn't it?
And a dear little robin flew in, and perched upon your own hat-
peg; and then I felt sure that you must come home, if you tried to
stay away ever so."
“Oh, you superstitious pet! I must reason with you to-morrow.”
CHAPTER XLVI.
BOXING DAY.
UPON the Christmas morning, the parish flocked to church ; and
the church was dressed so beautifully that the parish was amazed.
Amy and Eöa had made the wreaths, the garlands, and rosettes ;
there was only one cross to be discovered—a badly-bred Maltese
one. Eöa had been walking over the barbarous pew-screens (like
the travisses in a stable), springing from one to another, with a
cable of flowers and evergreens, as easily and calmly as she would
step from the scraper to the door-mat. Of course she had never
heard of that sort of thing before, but she took to it at once, as she
did to any thing pretty; and soon she was Amy's mistress, as indeed
she must be every one's, unless she could not bear them.
The sons of the Forest looked up with amazement as they sham-
bled in one after another, and an old woodcutter went home for his
axe, lest the ivy should throttle the pillars. Many of the old
parishioners attributed this great outburst of foliage to the indigna-
tion of the pixies at Parson John's going to London, and staying
there so long

troubled in mind. But he would not forego his pleasant words to
the well-known flock upon Christmas Day.
While the choir was making a stupendous din out of something
they called an “anthem,” Octave slipped off to his Rushford duty,
through the chancel-door.
Then, with his silken gown on--given him years ago by subscrip-
tion, and far too grand for him to wear, except at Christmas and
Easter-John Rosedew mounted the pulpit-stairs, and showed (as
in a holy bower of good-will and of gratitude) the loving-kindness of
his face and the grandeur of his forehead. As he glanced from one
to the other with a general welcome, a genial interest in the welfare
both of soul and body, a stir and thrill ran through the church, and
many eyes were tearful. For already a rumour was abroad that
“Uncle John" must leave them, that another Christmas Day would
see a stranger in his pulpit.
After dwelling briefly on his favourite subject, Christian love, and
showing (by quotations from the noblest of heathen philosophers)
how low and false their standard was, how poor a keystone is
earthly citizenship, the patriotism of a pugnacious village, or a little
presumptuous Attica, to crown and bind together the great arch of
humanity ; after showing, too, with a depth of learning lost upon
his audience, how utterly false it is to say that the doctrines, or
rather the principles, nay, the one great principle of our New Testa.
ment, had ever been anticipated on the banks of the Yellow
River-kindly and heartily he turned to the application of his
subject.
With some unconscious yearning perhaps, or perhaps some sense
of home-truth, he gazed towards the curtained pew where sat his
ancient friend, brought thither (as he knew too well) by tidings of
his absence. As the eyes of the old men met, for the first time after
long estrangement--those eyes that had met so frankly and kindly
for more than fifty years, during all which time each to the other
had been a necessarius”-and as each observed how pale and
grey his veteran comrade looked, neither heart could be acquit of
self-reproach and sorrow.
John Rosedew's mild eyes glistened so, and his voice so shook
and faltered, that all the parish noticed it, and wondered what
harm it had done last week. For none of them had ever known the
parson's voice to tremble, unless some old parishioner had done the
unbecoming; and then the village mourned it, because it vexed the
parson so.
The next day, as soon as Uncle John had found that all parochial
matters were in proper trim, and that he might leave home again
without neglect of duty, what did he do but order a fly, no less than
a one-horse fly, from the "Jolly Foresters ;” which fly should rush
to the parsonage-door, as nearly as might be, at one o'clock? Now
why would not Coræbus suffice to carry the rector and valise,

according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, a distance of two
parasangs?
Simply because our Amy was going. Amy had won leave to go.
Beautiful Amy was going to London, great fountain-head of all
visions and marvels, even from white long-clothes up to the era of
striped crinoline. And who shall object, except on the ground that
Amy was too good to go.
If Amy were put down now in Hyde Park, Piccadilly, or Regent-
street, at the height and cream of the season, when fop, and screw,
and fogey, Frivolus and Frivola, Diana Venatrix, Copa Syrisca,
Aphrodite Misthoté, yea, and even some natural honest girls mode-
rately ticketed, are doing their caravaning-if Amy were put on the
pathway there, in her simple grey hat and feather, and that round-
about chenille thing which she herself had made, and which fol-
lowed the lines of her figure so, fifty fellows, themselves of the most
satisfactory figure (at Drummond's, or at Coutts's), fifty fellows who
had slipped the hook fifty times apiece (spite of motherly bend
O'Shaugnessey) must have received their stroke of grace, and hated
Cradock Nowell.
Although the South-Western Railway had been open so many
years, our forest-child had never been further from green leaf and
yellow gorse than Winchester in the eastern hemisphere, and Salis-
bury in the western. And now after all to think that she was going
to London, not for joy, but sorrow. Desperate coaxing it had cost;
every known or new device-transparent every one of them, as the
pleading eyes that urged it-every bit of cozening learned from
three years old and upward, every girlish argument that never can
hold water, unless it be a tear-drop; and, better than a million
pleas, every soft caress and kiss, all loving, all imploring—there was
not one of these but came to batter Amy's father, or ever he surren-
dered. For John's ideas were very old-fashioned as to maidenly
decorum, and Aunt Eudoxia's view of the matter was even more prim
and grim than his. Yet (as Amy well remarked) if she herself could
see no harm in it, there certainly could be none; and how could they
insist so much on the καλόν and the πρέπον, as if they over-rodeτο δέον!
It is likely enough that this last stroke won the palm of victory ;
for, though dear Amy knew little of Greek, and her father knew a
great deal, she often contrived, with true feminine skill, to take his
wicket neatly, before he had found his block-hole. And then her
father would smile and chuckle, and ask to have his bat again;
which never was allowed him. To think that any man should be
the father of such ευστοχία!
Therefore, that father was compelled to throw himself, flat as a
flounder, on Eudoxia's generosity; for the leech-bottle now had no
leeches.
“Darling Doxy, you know quite well you are such a wonderful
manager; you have got a little cash somewhere ?"

He put it with a twist of interrogation, a quivering lever of doubt,
and yet a grand fulcrum of confidence, which were quite irresistible.
Whereupon Aunt Doxy smiled, with the perception of superior
mind, and the power of causing astonishment. Ñever a word she
said, but went to some unknown recesses in holy up-stair adyta :
she fussed about with many keys, over sounding boards and creak-
ing ones, to signify her caution; and at last came back with a
leathern bag, wash-leather tied with bobbin. Putting up her hands
to keep Amy at a distance, she pursed her lips, as if to say, "Now
don't be disappointed; there is really nothing in it. Nothing, at
least, I mean for people of your extravagant ideas.”
Then, one by one, before John's eyes, which enlarged with o
geometric progression of amazement, she laid a gorgeous train of
gold, as if it were but dominoes, beginning with half-sovereigns
first, then breaking into the broader gauge, until there must have
been twenty pounds, and the parson thought of all his poor people.
Verily then she stopped awhile, to enhance her climax; or perhaps she
hesitated, as was only natural. But now the pleasure of the thing
was too much for her prudence. Looking at her brother, and then
at Amy, and wanting to look at both at once, she drew from a little
niche in the bag, with a jerk (as if it were nothing) a dainty marrow-
fat ten-pound note of the Bank of England, with the name of a
butcher upon the back, and an authenticity of grease grander than
any water-mark. She tried very hard to make light of it, and not
wave it in the air even ; but the tide of her heart was too strong for
her, and she turned away, and cried as hard as if she had no money.
Who may pretend to taste and tell every herb in the soup of
nature ? There is no sovereign moly, no paramount amellus ; even
basil (the herb of kings) may be drowned in garlic. Blest are they
who seek not ever for the forced-meat balls, but find some good in
every brewis, homely, burnt, or overstrained.
Mr. Rosedew, putting on his boots for the road to London, felt
himself, at every tug, quite as rich as Megacles—that man of fore-
most Athenian blood, but none the more a gentleman, who walked
capaciously into, and rapaciously walked out of, the gold-granaries
of Creesus. A delightful sense of having gotten great money out of
Eudoxia—a triumph without historic parallel-inspired him, away
with that overdone word !-aërated him with glory. Thirty pounds,
and some odd shillings, wholly at John Rosedew's mercy (who
never gave quarter to money, but hewed it as small as Agag, when
any body asked him),-thirty pounds, with no duty upon it, no
stamp of responsibility, and a peculiar and peppery piquancy in the
spending of every halfpenny, to wonder what sister Doxy would
think if she could only know it!
He gave careful Amy the note to keep, and 151. to go inside it,
because he had promised to do so; for Eudoxia knew his nature.
In that noble fly from the “Foresters,” which had only two

springs broken, John and his daughter went away to catch the
train at Brockenhurst. Out of the windows dangerously they
pushed their beautiful heads—the beauty of youth on one side, the
beauty of age on the other-although the coachman had specially
warned them that neither door would fasten. But what could they
do, when Aunt Doxy was there looking through the great rhododen-
dron, with a kettle-holder over her mouth because it was so cold ;
fat Jemima too, and Jenny,and Jem Pottles leading Coræbus to shake
off his dust at the shay-horse, and learn what he might come to?
Some worthy people had journeyed up from the further end of the
village, to bid an eternal farewell to Amy, and to take home the
washing. They knew she would never come back again ; she would
never be let go again ; folks in London were so wicked, and parson
was so innocent. Evil though the omens were, as timidly blushing
she went away, tearfully leaving her father's hearth, though a daw
on the left hand forbade her to go, and a wandering chough was
overhead, and a croaking raven whirled away into the wilds of the
woodland-for whom shall I fear, I the cannie seer, while Amy
smiles dexter out of the cab, and wraps her faith around her ?
Make we not half our life here, according as we receive it? Is
it not as the rain that falls, softly when softly taken, as of leaves
and grass and water ; but rattling and flying in mud and foul
splashes, when met at wrong angles repulsively?
My little daughter, if you cannot see your way in that simile-a
very common-place one,--take a still more timeworn and venerable
illustration. Our life is but a thread, my child, at any moment
snappable, though never snapped unwisely; and true as it is that
we cannot spin and shape it (as does the spider) out of our own
crnotions, yet we have this gift of God, that we can make some
beauty and delight of simple elements; even as the outer nature
makes delicious beauty of a little web of crosses, gemmed with the
veeping of the sky
Knowing, then, in whose Hand we are, and feeling how large
that Hand is, let us know and feel therewith that He will never
crush us; because He loves us to rejoice, and tamely to regard
Him; with confidence in adoration, and a smile in every bow.
CHAPTER XLVII.
THE VISION OF AN ANGEL.
POLLY DUCKSACRE was sitting in state behind the little counter,
and opposite the gas-jet, upon her thronema bushel basket set
upside down on another. It was the evening of Boxing Day, and

Polly was arrayed with a splendour that challenged the strictest
appraisement; so gorgeous were her gilt earrings, cornelian neck-
lace, sham cameo brooch-Cupid stealing the sword of Mars-and
German-silver bracelets. The children who came in for “ha'porths
of specked” forgot their errand and hopes of prigging, and, suck-
ing their lips with wild admiration, cried “Lor now! Ain't she
stunnin ?" 'Spexs her sweetheart in a coach and four," exclaimed
one little girl of great penetration ; “ oh give us a ride, miss, when
he comes.'
That little girl was right, to a limited extent. Polly did expect
her sweetheart ; not in a coach and four, however, but in a smallish
tax-cart, chestnut-coloured, picked out with white; on the panel
whereof was painted, as the Act directs, “ Robert Clinkers, Junior,
Coal-merchant, Hammersmith.” Mr. Clinkers, whose first visit
had been paid siinply from pity for Cradock, and to acquit himselí
of all complicity in Hearty Wibraham's swindle, had called again
to inake kind inquiries, after finding how ill the poor fellow was,
and that his landlady sold coals. Nor was it long before he ven-
tured to propose an arrangement, mutually beneficial, under which
the Ducksacre firm should receive their supply from him. Two or
three councils were held, but the ladies were obliged to surrender at
last, because he was so complimentary, and had such nice white
teeth, and spoke in such a feeling manner of his dear departed
angel. On the other hand, their old wharfinger would come blus-
tering about his sacks, loud enough to make the potatoes jump,
and he kept such impudent men, and bit his nails without any
manners, and called them both “ Mrs. Acreducks."
During this Clinkerian diplomacy, Polly showed such shrewdness,
and such a nice foot and ancle, and had such a manner of rolling
her eyes-blacker and brighter than best Wallsend—that the coals
of love were laid, the match struck, the fire kindled, and drawing
well up the hearth-place, before Robert Clinkers knew what he was
doing. And now he came every evening, bringing two sacks of coal
with him, and sat on a bag of Barcelonas, and cracked, and gazed
at Polly.
Miss Ducksacre, you should sell lemonade,” he had said only
Saturday last, which was Christmas Eve," it is such a genteel
drink, you know, when a chap is consumed with immortal fíres, as
the great poet says-him as wrote the operas, or the copperas, bless
me;
I never know which it is; likely you can tell, miss ?”
“Lor, Mr. Clinkers, why, the proper name is hopperas; we shows
the boards, and we gets a ticket, when nobody else won't go.”
“Oh now! Do you, though? Ah, I was there, afore ever I
knew what life was. A tricksomething is life, Miss Polly,
especially for a 'andsome female, and no young fellow to be
trusted with it. Valuable cargo on green wood. Sure to come to
shipwreck."

“ Lor, Mr. Clinkers, what can you mean? I am sure I am not
at all handsome.”
“ Then there isn't one in London, miss. Coals is coals, and fire
is fire-oh, I should like some lemonade, with a drop of rum in it.
Would you join me in it now, if I just pop round the corner ? It
would make you feel so nice now.”
“Do I ever feel any thing else but nice ?" Oh, Polly, what a
leading question !
“ I wishes it was in my province now, with the deepest respect,
to try !” Here Polly flashed away, though nobody was pursuing
her, got behind some Penzance broccoli, and seized a half-pottle to
defend herself. Mr. Clinkers, knowing what he was about, appealed
to a bunch of mistletoe, under which, in distracting distraction, the
young lady had taken refuge.
“Now nobody else in all this London,” said the coal-merchant to
the ivory berries, " in all this mighty Belial, as the poet beautifully
expresses it, epecially if a young man, not over five-and-thirty, not
so very bad-looking but experienced in life, and with great venera-
tion for the sex, and a business, you may say, of three hundred a year
clear of income-tax, and increasing hannually, and a contract with
the company, without no encumbrances, would ever go to think of
letting that beautiful young lady enjoy the sweets of retirement in
that most inwiting position, without plucking some of the pearls off,
and no harm done or taking. And nothing at all pervents me, no
consideration of the brockolo-could pay for it to-morrow morning
—but my deepest respects, not having my best togs on, through a
cruel haxident. Please pigs they'll come home to-morrow morning,
and I'll do it on Monday, and lock up yard at four o'clock, if tailor
has made a job of it. Look nice indeed, and feel nice? I should
like to know how she could help it !”
This explains why, when the wheels at the door, early on Monday
evening, proved to be not of the sprightly tax-cart, but a lumbering
cab, Polly was disappointed. Neither was her displeasure removed
when she saw a very pretty girl get out, and glide into the shop,
with the loveliest damask spreading over the softest and clearest
oval. Though Polly had made up her mind about Cradock as
now a bad speculation, it was not likely that she should love yet
any other who meant to have him.
Amy shrunk back as her nice clean skirt swept the grimy thres-
hold. She was not by any means fidgety, but had a nervous dislike
of dirt, as most upright natures have. Then she felt ashamed of
herself, and coloured yet more deeply to think that a place good
enough for Cradock should seem too sordid for her, indeed! And
then her tears glanced in the gas-light, that Cradock should ever
have come to this, and partly, no doubt, for her sake, though she
never could tell how.
The little shop was afforested with Christmas-trees of all sorts

and of every pattern, as large as ever could be squeezed, with a
knuckle of root to keep them steady, into pots No. 32. The coster-
mongers won't have larger pots, because they take too much room
on a truck, and force them to hire a big boy to push.
Aucuba, Irish yew, Portugal laurel, arbor vitæ, and bay-tree, but
most of all—and for the purpose by far most convenient, because
of the hat-peg order-the stiff, self-confident, argumentative spruce.
All these, when they have done their spiriting, and yielded long-
remembered fun, will be fondly tended by gentle-hearted girls on
some suburban balcony ; they will be watered enough to kill lignum
vitæ ; patent compost will be bought at about the price of sugar ;
learned consultations will be held between Sylvia and Lucilla ; and
then, as the leaves grow daily more yellow, and papa is so pro-
voking that he will only shake his head (too sagaciously to commit
himself), an earnest appeal will be addressed to some of the
gardening papers. Or perhaps the tree will be planted, with
no little ceremony, in the centre of some grass-plot nearly as
large as a counterpane; while the elder members of the family,
though bland ough to drink its alth, regard the measure as
very unwise, because the house will be darkened so in a few short
years.
Meanwhile the editor's reply arrives--" Possibly Sylvia's tree has
no roots.” He is laughed to scorn for his ignorance, until little
Charley falls to work with his Ramsgate spade unbidden. Factura
nepotibus umbram! It has been chopped all round the bole with a
hatchet, and is as likely to grow as a lucifer-match.
Through that Christmas Tabraca Mr. Rosedew led his daughter,
begging her at every step to be careful of the trees, whose claims
upon her attention she postponed to those of her frock.
Lor bless me, sir, is that you now, and your good lady along of
you! How glad I am, to be sure !"
Miss Ducksacre, this is my daughter, Miss Amy Rosedew, of
whom
you have heard me speak;" here John executed a flourish of
great complacency with his hat; my only child, but as good to me
as any dozen could be. Will you allow her to stop here a minute,
while I go up-stairs ?”
Amy was trembling now, more and more every moment, for her
father would not ask how Cradock was, lest the answer should be
unfavourable.
“To be sure she can stay here," said Polly, not over graciously;
for if Mt. Clinkers should come in just then, it might alter his
ideal.
“Ah, so very sad ; so very sad, miss, ain't it now?"
“Yes,” said Amy, having no desire to pursue the subject with
Polly. But Polly's tongue could no more keep still than a frond of
maiden-hair fern in the draught of a river archway.
Ah, so very sad ! To think of him go, quite young as he is, to

one of them moon-struck smilems, where they makes rope-mats and
tiger rugs! As 'andsome a young man, miss, as ever I see off a
hengine; and of course he must be such, ’appening to be your
brother."
Before the young lady could answer, Mrs. Ducksacre came to fetch
her, and frowned very hard at Polly, who began to feel somewhat
ashamed of herself. For, in spite of all her faith and hope, poor Amy
could scarcely get up the stairs, till her father came to meet her.
“ There is no one with him now, dear ; Mrs. Jupp is in the sitting-
room, so very kindly lent us by the good landlady. Only two more
pairs of stairs, and there our Cradock lies, not a bit worse than he
was ; if any thing, a little better; and his faithful little Wena with
him : she won't leave him, night or day, dear. Give me your hand,
Amy. Why, I declare, it is rather dark, when you get too far from
the windows! Madam, come in with us.”
Mrs. Ducksacre however, having a woman's quick perception,
knew when her presence had better be absence, as well as a
sleeping partner does at the association's bankruptcy. So, after
showing them up to the door, she slipped away into the side-
cupboard which Mr. Rosedew had called a “sitting-room.”
Then John took Amy's bonnet off (after ruining the strings),
and stroked her pretty hair down, and took her pale face in his
hands, and begged her not to tremble so, because she would quite
upset him. Only she might cry a little, if she thought it would do
her good. But when she put her hand up, and gave a dry sob only,
the father led her very tenderly into the little chamber.
It was a wretched little room, low, and cold, and dark, and void
of all attempt at decoration, or even common comfort. Amy took
all of it in at a glance, for in matters of that sort a woman's
perception flies on the wings of the pratincole, the swiftest of all
embodied speed.
She even knew why the bed was awry; which her father could
sooner have written ten scolia than discover. The bed was placed
so, because poor Cradock, jumping up all of a sudden in an early
stage of illness, and before his head grew soft, had knocked a great
piece of plaster down from the projecting hip-beam.
Now Craddy was looking away from them, sitting up in the sack-
cloth bed, and trying with the sage gravity of fixed hallucination to
read some lines which his fancy had written on the glazed dirt that
served for a window. That window perhaps pronounced itself more
by candlelight than by daylight, and the landlord had forbidden
any attempt at cleaning it, because he knew that the frame was
inclined to drop out. Two candles, the residue of two pounds which
Mr. Rosedew had paid for, only helped to interpret the squalid
room more forcibly.
While poor Amy was standing waiting, full of fear and misery,
and her father was thinking what to say, the weak sick fellow turned

towards them, and his eyes met hers. She saw that the tint of her
lover's eyes was gone from a beautiful deep grey to the tone of a
withered oak-leaf, the pupils forthstanding haggardly, with livid
circles around them, and the face itself a type of trouble and
long suffering, so gaunt, and wan, and weary,
Amy could not weep, but gazed (feeling, but not thinking much)
with all the love and pity, devotion and eternal faith, which are sure
to shine in a true girl's eyes, when trouble strikes its light there.
Nothing could have been more touching than to see her gaze fixed
on him, fixed yet ever flitting with a crowd of rapid memories, that
made her now adore him. Who beside in all the world could
look at him with eyes so full of sorrow, pride, humility, glory, hope,
and pity, comfort-and in one word, love ?
But from him no answer came, until her tears began to flow ; his
wan and wandering and wild gaze slowly went around, and weakly,
without finding any place to be at home, and settle in. Now as
soon as those eyes lit on certain eyes so deep with tears, and dark
with craving after them, something of a soft and piteous wish came
through their wildness.
They looked, and wandered on again, and seemed to lose all
thought of it, and then with some shade of remembrance, happened
to come back again, and felt inclined to linger. Not to stay too
long, but linger, with a longing to know something, which they must
have krown somewhen.
The maiden dried her eyes and fixed them with a cheerful glance
on his. A tear had caught his notice first, and now a smile should
rivet it.
From that moment all was right. The sick youth even smiled in
answer to the bright waft of her smile, as his softening gaze began
to ieel its way and come again, to flutter with a pulse of joy and
sense of resting somewhere; then to quicken, flush, and deepen-
irom some fount that flows in heaven-then to waver and suffuse
(with side-long memories of grief), and at last, with a leap of rap-
ture (as a bird springs into nest), to return for ever into the beloved
home, thrilling, beaming, glowing with the light, the life, the love.
So with a faint but joyful cry, like a shipwrecked man at his
hearth again, he stretched out both his wasted arms, and there ran
Amy into them. She laid his white cheek on her shoulder, and let
her hair flow over it ; she held him up with her own pure breast, till
his worn heart beat on her warm one. Then she sobbed, and laughed,
and sobbed, and called him her world, and heart, and heaven, and
kissed his wondering brow, and looked, and asked, now was he sure
of her? All she begged for was one word, just one little word (or
whisper would do quite as well) to show if he now could begin to
guess who it was that was come to comfort him.
“Oh, he must know her-of course he must-wouldn't she know
him, that was all, though she hadn't a breath of life left? His own,

his faith, his truth, his love-his own-let him say his own what-
if she lived a hundred years, never would she cry again. Only
say it once, his own, little, foolish”
Amy!”
“Yes, your Amy, Amy, Amy. Say it again, say one more ‘Amy,'
my darling everlasting love !"
Suddenly the barriers of his frozen grief were loosened. With
one weak arm still hanging round her, though it could not cling to
her, he burst into a flood of tears, from the fountain of great waters,
source and home whereof is God.
Then John, who had stood at the door all the time, with his
white head bowed on his coat-sleeve, came forward and took a hand
of each, knelt by the bed, and poured forth thanks. They wanted
not to talk of it, nor any doctor to tell them. Because they had an
angel's voice, that heaven at length was watching them.
Darlings, didn't I tell you," said Amy, taking a hand of each,
with her rich curls tear-bespangled, like a young grape-leaf in the
vinery; " don't you know that I was sure our Father would never
forsake us; and that even a simple thing, like me, might fetch back
my own blessing? Oh, we could not have loved one another so;
only God knew it was good for us."
While she spoke, Cradock looked at her with a faint far-off intelli-
sence of her love, but not of her arguments. He only cared to hear
her voice; to see her more with heart than eyes ; and touch her to
inake sure of her; then to dream that it was an angel; then to wake
and be very glad that she was only Amy.
CHAPTER XLVIII.

Slowly from that night, but surely, Cradock's mind came home
again, as a child comes back to its mother, who is stretching forth
her arms to it; timid at first and wondering, and apt for a long time
to reel and stagger upon very small occasion.
Then as the water flows over the ice, in a gradual gentle thaw,
beginning to gleam at the margin first, where the reeds are and the
willow-trees, then gliding slowly and brightly on, following every
skate-mark or line where a rope or stick has been, till it meets in one
broad limpid sheet; so crystal reason dawned and wavered, felt its
way and went on again, tracing many a childish channel, many a
dormant memory, across that dull lethargic mind, until the clear
surface was restored, and the mirror could reflect again.
Mr. Rosedew quartered himself and his Amy at the Portland

Hotel hard by, and reckless of all expense moved Cradock into
Mrs. Ducksacre's very best room. He would have done this long
ago, only the doctor would not allow it.
Then Amy, who did not like London at all, because there were so
few trees in it, hired some of the Christmas-grove from the fair
greengrocers, and decked out the little sitting-room, so that Cradock
enjoyed sweet visions of the Queen's bower mead. As for herself,
she would stay in the shop, perhaps half an hour together, and
rejoice in the ways of the children. All her pocket-money went
into the till, as if you had taken a shovel to it. Barcelonas, Brazils,
and cob-nuts she was giving all day, to the fracture of teeth; and
golden oranges rolled before her, as from Atalanta.
It is a most wonderful fact, and far beyond medical knowledge,
that instead of losing her roses in London, as a country girl ought to
have done, Amy bloomed with more Jacqueminot upon very bright
occasions—more Louise Odier constantly, with Goubalt in the
dimples, then toning off at any new fright to Malmaison, or Devo-
niensis—more of these roses now carmined or mantled in the deli-
cate bend of her cheeks, than ever had nestled and flourished there
in the free air of the Forest.
Good Aunt Doxy was quite amazed on the Saturday afternoon,
when meeting her brother and niece at the station-for it made no
difference in the outlay, and the drive would do her good-she
round, not a pale and withered child, worn out with London racket,
and freckled with dust and smoke-spots, but the loveliest Amy she
had ever yet seen—which was something indeed to say, with a
brilliance of bloom which the good aunt at once, suspecting London
practices, proceeded to test with her handkerchief.
But before the young lady left town-to wit, upon the Friday
evening-she had a little talk with Rachel Jupp, or rather with
strapping Issachar, which nearly concerns our story:
“Oh, Miss Amy,” said Rachel that morning-for, in the course of
her duty as nurse, she had made such acquaintance that “Miss
Amy” sounded more natural than “Miss Rosedew”-“ so you're
going away, miss, after all, and never see my Looey; and a pretty
child she is, and a good one, and a quiet one, and father never lift
hand to her now; and the poor young gentleman saved her life, and
he like her so much, and she like him.”
“ I will come and see her this evening, as you have so kindly
asked me. That is, with my papa's leave; and if
you
don't mind
coming for me to the inn at six o'clock. I am afraid of walking by
myself after dark in London. My papa has found some books ai
the bookstalls, and he is so delighted with them, he never wants me
after dinner.”
“Dear Miss Amy, would you mind, then-would you mind taking
a drop of tea with us?”
“To be sure I will. I mean, if it is quite convenient, and it yoit

CRADOCK NOWELL.
can be spared here, and if-oh nothing else, Mrs. Jupp, only I
shall be most happy.” She was going to say, “and if you won't
make any great preparations;" but she had managed her parish too
long, not to know how sensitive poor people are at any restraint
on their hospitality.
Therefore grand preparations were made ; and grander still they
would have been, and more formal and uncomfortable, if Amy had
finished her sentence. Rachel at once rushed off to her lord, whose
barge-shaped frame was moored alongside of his wharf, dreaming
as stolidly as none except a bargee can dream. He immediately
shelled out seven and sixpence from the cuddy of his inexpressibles,
and left his wife to her own devices, except in the matter of tea
itself. The tea he was resolved to fetch from a little shop in the
barge-walk, where, as Mother Hamp declared, who kept the tobacco-
shop by the gate, they sold tea as strong as brandy.
“If you please to excuse our Zakey, miss, taking no more tea,"
said Mrs. Jupp, after Issachar had laboured very hard at it, the host
being bound, in his opinion, to feast even as the guest did ; "be-
cause he belong to the anti-teatotallers, as takes nothing no stronger
than gin, miss."
“Darrn't take more nor one noggin of tay, miss,” cried Mr. Jupp,
touching his short front curl with a hand scrubbed in quick-lime
and copperas ; “likes it, but it don't like me, miss. Makes me feel
quite intemperant like,-50 narvous, and queer, and staggery.
Looey, dear, dad's mild mixture, for to speak the young lady's
health in. Leastways, by your lave, miss.”
Dad's mild mixture soon made its appearance in a battered half-
gallon can, and Mr. Jupp was amazed and grieved that none but
himself would quaff any. The strongest and headiest stuff it was,
which even the publicans of London, alchymists of villainy, can
quassify, and cocculize, and nux-vomicize up to proof. Then, the
wrath of hunger and thirst being mollified, Issachar begged leave
to smoke, if altogether agreeable, and it would all go up the
chimney ; which, however, it refrained from doing.
Now, while he is smoking, we may admit that the contents of Mr.
Jupp's census-paper (if, indeed, he ever made legal entries, after
punching the collector's head) have not been transcribed to the
satisfaction of the Registrar-General, or Home-Office, or whoever or
whatever he, or she, or it is, who or which insists upon knowing
nine times as much about us as we know about ourselves. Mr.
Jupp was a bargee of Catholic views; “it warn't no odds to he"
whether he worked upon wharf or water, sea or river or canal, at
coal, or hay, or lime, breeze, or hop-poles, or any thing else. Now
and then he went down to Gravesend, or up the river to Kingston
or Staines ; but his more legitimate area was navigable by three
canals, where a chap might find time to eat his dinner, and give his
wife, and nag, and child, their'n.

Issachar's love of nature always culminated at one o'clock; and
then how he loved to halt his team under a row of alders, and see
the painted meadows gay, and have grub and pipe accordin’. His
three canals, affording these choice delights unequally, were the
Surrey, the Regent's, and the Basingstoke.
That last was, indeed, to his rural mind, the nearest approach to
Paradise ; but as there is in all things a system of weights and
measures, Mr. Jupp got better wages upon the other two, and so
could not very often afford to indulge his love of the beautiful.
Hence he kept his household gods within reach of the yellow Tibers,
and took them only once a year for a treat upon the Anio. Then
would Rachel Jupp and Looey spend a summer month afloat,
enjoying the rural glimpses and the sliding quietude of inland
navigation, and keeping the pot a-boiling in the state cabin of the
Enterprise or the Industrious Maiden.
Now Amy, having formed Loo's acquaintance, and said what was
right and pretty in gratitude for their entertainment and faithful
kindness to Cradock, was just about to leave them, when Issachar
Jupp delivered this speech, very slowly, as a man who has got to
the marrow and pope's-eye of his pipe :-
Now 'scuse me for axing of you, miss, and if any ways wrong
in so doing, be onscrupulous for to say so, and no harm done or
taken. But I has my raisons for axing, from things as I've a 'eard
him say, and oncommon good raisons too. If you please, what be
the arkerate name and dwellin'-place of the young gent as saved
our Loo ? Mr. Clinkers couldn't find out, miss, though he knowed
as it warn'tCharles Newman.”
Don't
you know his story, then ?" asked Amy, in some astonish-
ment. “I thought you knew all about it, and were so kind to him
partly through that, and at the same time kind enough not to talk
to me about it."
“We guesses a piece here and there, miss, since he talk so wild
in his illness. And that's what made me be axing of you; for I
knowed one name right well as he out with once or twice ; not at
all a common name nother. But we knows for sartin no more nor
this, that he be an onlucky young gent, and the best as ever come
into these parts.”
“There can be no harm in my telling you, such faithful friends
ils you are. And the sad tale is known to every one, far and wide,
in our part of Hampshire.”
Hampshire, ah !” said Mr. Jupp, with a very mysterious look ;
we knowed Mr. Rosedew come from Hampshire, and that set us
the more a-thinkin' of it. Loo, child, run for dad's bacco-box, as
were left to Mother Richardson's, and if it ain't there, try at Blinkin'
Davy's, and if he ain't got it, try Mother Hamp.”
The child, sadly disappointed, for her eyes were large with hopes
of a secret about her “dear gentleman," as she called Cradock,

CRADOCK NOWELL.
departed upon her long errand. Then Amy told, as briefly as
possible, all she knew of the great mishap, and the misery which
followed it. From time to time her soft voice shook, and her tears
would not be disciplined ; while Rachel Jupp's strayed anyhow.
But Issachar listened dryly and sternly, with one great brown hand
on his forehead. Not once did he interrupt the young lady, by ges-
ture, look, or question. But when she had finished, he said very
quietly,-
“One name, miss, as have summat to do with it, I've not 'eard you
sinnify ; and it were the sound o' that very namé as fust raised my
coorosity. Scuse me, miss, but I wouldn't ax, only for good
raison."
“I hardly know what right I have to mention any other names,"
replied Amy, blushing and hesitating, for she did not wish to speak
of Pearl Garnet ; "there is only one other name connected at all
with the matter, and that one of no importance.”
“Ah,” returned Jupp, with a glance as intense as a cat's through
a dairy keyhole,“ maybe the tow-rope ain't nothin' to do with the
goin' of the barge, miss. That name didn't happen permiskious
now to be the name of Garnet, ma'am ?”
“Yes, indeed it did. But how could you know that, Mr. Jupp?”
“Pearl Garnet were the name I 'ear'd on, and that ain't a very
common name, leastways to my experience. Now, could it 'ave
'appened by a haxident that her good father's name were Bull
Garnet ?"
Amy drew back, for Mr. Jupp, in his triumph and excitement,
had laid down his pipe, and was stretching out his unpeeled crate
of a hand, as if to take her by the shoulder, and shake the whole
truth out of her. It was his fashion with Rachel, and he quite
forgot the difference. Mrs. Jupp cried, “ Zakey, Zakey !” in a tone
of strong remonstrance. But he was not abashed very seriously.
“ It couldn't be now, could it, miss; it worn't in any way possible
that Pearl Garnet's father was ever known by the name of Bull
Garnet ?”
“ But indeed that is his name, Mr. Jupp. Why should you be so
incredulous?"
“Oncredulous it be, miss ; oncredulous, as I be a sinner ! Rachy,
who'd ha' thought it?' How things does come about, to be sure !
Now plase to tell me, miss-very careful, and not passin' lightly of
any thing ; never you mind how small it seem-every word you
knows about Pearl Garnet and that there-job there ; and all you
knows on her father too.”
“You must prove to me first, Mr. Jupp, that I have any right to
do so.”
Issachar now was strongly excited, a condition most unusual with
him, except when his wife rebelled, and that she had, years ago,
ceased to do. He put his long black face, which was working so

that the high cheek-bones almost shut the little eyes, quite close to
Amy's pearly white ear, and whispered, -
If ye dunna tell me, ye'll cry for it arl the life long, ye'll never
right the innocent, and ye'll let the guilty ride over ye. I canna tell
no more just now, but every word is gospel. I be no liar, miss,
though I be rough enough, God knows. And He knoweth He made
me so."
Then Amy, trembling at his words, and thinking that she had
hurt his feelings, put her soft little hand, for amends, into Zakey's
great black piece of hold, which looked like the bilge of a barge ;
and he wondered what to do with it, such a sort of chap as he was.
He had never heard of kissing a hand, and even if he had it would
scarcely be a timely offering, for he was having a chaw to compose
himself-yet he knew that he ought not, in good manners, to let go
her hand in a hurry; so what did he do but slip off a ring (one of
those so-called “galvanic rings,” in which sailors and bargemen
have wonderful faith as an antidote to rheumatics, tick dolorous, and
the Caroline Morgan), and this ring he passed down two of her
fingers, for all females do love trinkets so. Amy kept it carefully,
and will put it on her chatelaine, if ever she sets up one.
Then being convinced by his words and manner, she told him
every thing she knew about the Garnet family—their behaviour in
and after the great misfortune; the strange seclusion of Pearl, and
Mr. Garnet's illness. And then she recurred to some vague
rumours which had preceded their settlement on the property of
Sir Cradock Nowell.
To all this Issachar listened, without a word or a nod, but with
his narrow forehead radiant with concentrated labour, his lips
screwed up in a serrate ring, after the manner of a medlar, and a
number of winks so intensely sage that his barge might have
turned a corner with a team of eight blind horses, and no nod
wanted for one of them.
“ Ain't there no more nor that, miss ?” he asked, with some dis-
appointment, when the little tale was ended ; “ can't you racollack
no more?"
“No, indeed I cannot. And if you had not some important
object, I should be quite ashamed of telling you so much gossip. If
I may ask you a question now, what more did you expect me to
tell you ?”
“That they had know'd, miss, as Bull Garnet were Sir Cradock
Nowell's brother."
“ Mr. Garnet Sir Cradock's brother! You must be mistaken,
Mr. Jupp. My father has known Sir Cradock Nowell ever since he
was ten years old; and he could not have failed to know it, if it had
been so.
“ Most like he do know it, miss. But dunna you tell him now,
nor any other charp. It be true as gospel for all that, though."

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“Then Robert and Pearl are Cradock's first cousins, and Mr.
Garnet is his uncle !"
“Not ezackly as you counts things," answered the bargeman,
looking at the fire ; " but in the way as we does.”
Amy felt that she must ask no more, at least upon
that
subject; and that she was not likely to speak of it even to her
father.
“Let him go, miss,"continued Issachar, referring now to Cradock;
let him go for a long sea-vohoyage, same as doctor horders un.
He be better out of the way for a spell or two. The Basingstoke
ain't fur enoo, whur I meant to ’ave took him. 'A mun be quite
out ’o the kintry till this job be over like. And niver a word as to
what I thinks to coom anigh his ear, miss, if so be you vallies his
raison."
But you forget, Mr. Jupp, that you have not told me, as yet, at
all what it is you do think. You said some things which frightened
me, and you told me one which astonished me. Beyond that I
know nothing."
“And better so, my dear young leddy, a vast deal better so.
Only you have the very best hopes, and keep your spirits roaring:
Zakey Jupp never take a thing in hand but what he go well
through with it. Ask Rachey about that. Now this were a casooal
haxident, mind you, only a casooal haxident-
“Of course we all know that, Mr. Jupp. No one would dare to
think any thing else.”
Yes, yes; all right, miss. And we'll find out who did the
casooal'haxident-that's all, miss, that's all. Only you hold your
tongue."
She was obliged to be content with this, and on the whole it
greatly encouraged her. Then she returned to the Portland Hotel,
under convoy of all the Jupp family, and Issachar got into two or
three rows by hustling every one out of her way. Although poor
Amy was frightened at this, no doubt it increased her faith in him
through some feminine process of dialectics unknown to the author
of the Organon.
Though Amy could not bear to keep any thing secret from her
father, having given her word she of course observed it, and John
was greatly surprised at the spirits in which his daughter took
leave of Cradock. But there were many points in Amy's character,
as has been observed before, which her father never understood;
and he concluded that this was a specimen of them, and was
delighted to see her so cheerful.
Now, being returned to Nowelhurst, he held council with sister
Eudoxia, who thoroughly deserved to have a vote after contributing
so to the revenue. And the result of their Lateran-for they both
were bricks-council was as follows :That John was bound, how-
soever much it went against his proud stomach after his previous

treatment, to make one last appeal by the father according to the
spirit to the father according to the flesh, in favour of the unlucky
son who was now condemned to exile, so as at least to send him
away in a manner suitable to his birth. That, if this appeal were
rejected, and the appellant treated unpleasantly—which was almost
sure to follow-he could not, consistently with his honour and his
clerical dignity, hold any longer the benefices (paltry as they were),
the gifts of a giver now proved unkind. That thereupon Mr. Rose-
dew should first provide for Cradock's voyage so far as his humble
means and small influence permitted ; and after that should settle
at Oxford, where he might get parochial duty, and where his old
tutorial fame and repute (now growing European from a life of
learning) would earn him plenty of pupils-
“And a professorship at least !” exclaimed the elder Miss Rose-
dew; for, much as she loved to be down on her brother, she was
proud as could be of his learning.
“Marry, ay, and a bishopric,” John answered, smiling pleasantly;
“ you have often menaced me, Doxy dear, with Jemima's apron."
So, on a bright day in January, John Rosedew said to Jem Pottles,
“ Saddle me the horse, James." And they saddled him the “horse"
—not so called by his master through any false aggrandizement
(such as maketh us talk of “the servants," when we have only
got a maid-of-all-work), but because the parson, in pure faith,
regarded him as a horse of full equine stature and super-equine
powers.
After tightening up the girths, then-for that noble cob, at the
saddling period, blew himself out with a large sense of humour un-
appreciated by the biped who bestraddled him unwarily-there-
fore, having buckled him up, till the clever nag creaked like a
tight-laced maid, away rode the parson towards the Hall. Much
liefer would he have walked by the well-known and pleasant foot-
path, but he felt himself bound, as one may say, to go in real style,
sir.
The more he reflected upon the nature of his errand, the fainter
grew his hopes of success; he even feared that his ancient friend-
ship would not procure him a hearing, so absorbed were all the
echoes of memory in the pique of parental jealousy, and the cajole-
ries of a woman. And the consequences of failure-how bitter they
must be to him and his little household ! Moreover, he dearly
loved his two little quiet parishes; and, though he reaped more
tithe from them in kindness than in kind or by commutation, to his
contented mind they were far_sweeter than the incumbency of
Libya-cum-Gadibus, and either Ponus for churchwarden.
He thought of Amy with a bitter pang, and of his sister with
heaviness, as he laid his hand-for he never used whip-on the fat
flank of the pony to urge him almost to a good round trot, that sus-
pense might sooner be done with. And when the Hall was at last

before him, he rode up, not to the little postern hard by the house.
keeper's snuggery (which had seemed of old to be made for him),
but to the grand front entrance, where the orange-trees in tubs were,
and the myrtles, and the marble steps.
Most of the trees had been removed, with the aid of little go-
carts, before the frosts began; but they impressed John Rosedew
none the less, so far as his placid and simple mind was open to
small impressions.
Dismounting from Coræbus, whose rusty snaffle and mildewed
reins would have been a disgrace to any horse, as Amy told him
every day, he rang the main entrance bell, and wondered whether
any body would let him in.
That journey had cost him a very sharp battle, to bear himself
humbly before the wrong, and to do it in the cause of the injured.
In the true and noble sense of pride, there could not be a prouder
man than this gentle parson. But he ruled that natural human
pride with its grander element, left in it by his Lord and master,
one great bequest of His presence here—the pride which never apes,
but is itself humility.
At last the door was opened, not by the spruce young footman
(who used to look so much at Amy, and speer about as to her expec-
tations, because she was only a parson's daughter), but by that an-
cient and most respectable Job Hogstaff, patriarch of butlers. Dull
and dim as his eyes were growing, Job, who now spent most of his
time in looking for those who never came, had made out Mr. Rose-
dew's approach, by virtue of the pony's most unmistakable shamble.
Therefore he pulled down his best coat from a jug-crook, twitched
his white hair to due stiffness, pushed the ostiary footman back with
a scorn which rankled for many a day under a zebra waistcoat, and
hobbled off at his utmost pace to admit the visitor now so strange,
gh once it was strange without him.
Mr. Rosedew walked in very slowly and stiffly, then turned aside
to a tufted mat, and began to wipe his shoes in the most elaborate
manner, though there was not a speck of dirt upon them. Old Job's
eyes blinked vaguely at him : he felt there was something wrong in
this.
“Don't ye do that, sir, now; for God's sake don't do that. I
can't abear it; and that's the truth.”
Full well the old man remembered how different, in the happy
days, had been John Rosedew's entrance ; and now every scrub on
the mat was a rub on his shaky hard-worn heart.
Mr. Rosedew looked mildly surprised, for his apprehension (as we
know) was swifter on paper than pavement. But he held forth his
firm strong hand, and the old man bowed tearfully over it.
Any news of our boy, sir ? Any news of my boy, as was?”
“Yes, Job; very bad news. He has been terribly ill in London,
and nobody there to care for him.”

“Then I'll throw up my situation, sir. Many's the time I have
threatened them, but didn't like to be too hard like. And pretty
goings on there'd be, without old Job in the pantry. But I bain't
bound to stand every thing for the saving of them as goes on so.
And that Hismallitish woman, as find fault with my buckles, and
nice things she herself wear-I'd a given notice a week next Mon-
day, but that I likes Miss Oa so, and feel myself bound, as you may
say, to see out this Sir Cradock; folk would say I were shabby to
leave him now he be gettin' elderly. Man and boy for sixty year,
and began no more than boot-cleaning ; man and boy for sixty-
three year, come next Lammas-tide. I should like it upon my
tombstone, sir, with what God pleases added, if I not make too bold,
and you the master of the churchyard, if so be you should live long
enough, when my turn come, God willing."
“ It may not be in my power, Job. But if ever it is, you may
trust me.”
“And I wants that in I was tellin' my niece about, “Put Thy
hand in the hollow of my thigh. Holy Bible, you know, sir, and
none can't object to that."
“ Come Job, my good friend, you must not talk so sepulchrally.
Leave His own good time to God.”
“ To be sure, sir; I bain't in no hurry yet. I've a sight of things
to see to, and my master must go first, he be so very particular. I'll
live to see the young master yet, as my duty is for to do. He 'ont
carry on with a Hismallitish woman; he'ont say, 'What, Hogstaff,
are your wits gone wool-gatherin'?' and his own wits all the time,
sir, fleeced, fleeced, fleeced-
Here Mr. Rosedew cut short the contrast between the present
and the future master (which would soon have assumed a golden
tinge as of the Fourth Eclogue), for the parson was too much a gen-
tleman to foster millennial views to the disadvantage of the master.
“Job, take my card to your master; and tell him, with my com-
pliments, that I wish to see him alone, if he will so far oblige me.
By-the-by, I ought to have written first, to request an interview;
but truly that never occurred to me.”
He could scarcely help sighing as he thought of formality re-
established on the ruins of familiarity.
“He'll be in the little coved room, no doubt, long o' that Hismal-
litish woman. But step in here a moment, sir.”
Instead of passing the doorway, which the butler had thrown
open for him, Mr. Rosedew stood scrupulously on the mat, as if it
marked his territory, until the old man came back and showed him
into the black oak parlour.
The little coved room was calmly and sweetly equal to the emer-
gency. The moment Job's heels were out of sight, Mrs. Corkle-
more, who had been indulging in a nice little chat with Sir Cradock,
“when she ought to have been at work all the while, plain-sewing

CRADOCK NOWELL.
for her little household, for who was to keep the wolf from the door,
if she shrank from a woman's mission—though irksome to her, she
must confess, for it did hurt her poor fingers so "-here she held up
a dish-cloth rather rougher than a coal-sack, which she had stolen
cleverly from her hosts own lower regions, and did not know from
a glass-cloth ; but it suited her because it was brown, and set off
her lily hands so ;—“oh, Uncle Cradock, in all this there is
something sweetly sacred, because it speaks to the heart of
home.”
She was darning it all the while with white silk, and took good
care to push it away, when any servant came in. It had lasted her
now for a week, and had earned her a hundred guineas, having made
the most profound impression upon its legitimate owner. She would
earn another hundred before the week was out by knitting a pair of
rough worsted socks for her little Flore," though it made her heart
bleed to think how that poor child hated the feel of them.”
Now she rose in haste from her chair, and pushed the fortunate
dish-cloth, with a very expressive air, into her pretty work-basket,
and drew the strings loudly over it.
“What are you going for, Georgie ? You need not leave the
room, I am sure.'
“ Yes, uncle dear, I must. You are so clear and so honest, I
know; and perhaps I inherit that feeling. But I could not have
any thing to do with any secret dealings, uncle, even though you
wished it, which I am sure you never could. I never could keep a
secret, uncle, because I am so shallow. Whenever secrecy is re-
quested, I feel as if there was something dishonest, either done or
contemplated. It is most childish of me, I know, but my nature
is so childishly open. At least every body says so ; while all the time
I seem to myself that is the oddest thing of all—to be compara-
tively clever. But that must be my mistake of course, and of course
Mr. Rosedew has a perfect right, and shows the result of his great
learning in concealing his little scheme about his ill-manner'd
daughter."
Georgie, stay in this room, if you please ; he is not coming
here."
“But that poor simple Amy will, if he has brought her with him.
Well, I will stay here and lecture her, uncle, about her very strange
manner to you.”
After all this the old man set forth, in some little irritation, to
receive his once-loved friend. He entered the black oak parlour in
a cold and stately manner, and bowed without a word to the friend
who had crossed the room to meet him. The parson held out his
hand, as a lover and preacher of peace should do ; but the offer,
ay, and the honour too, not being at all appreciated, he withdrew it
with a crimson blush all over his bright clear cheeks, as deep as his
daughter's would have been

me.”
come.
Then Sir Cradock Nowell, trying to seem quite calm and col.
lected, addressed his visitor thus :
“Mr. Rosedew, I thank you for the honour of this visit. I beg
your pardon, that you were shown into a room without a fire. Pray
take a chair. I have no doubt that your intentions are kind towards
“I thank you," replied the parson, speaking rather faster than
usual, and with the frill of his shirt-front rising ; " I thank you, Sir
Cradock Nowell; but I will not sit down in the house of a gentle-
man who declines to take my hand. I am here much against my
own wishes, and only because I supposed that it was my duty to
I am here on behalf of your son, a dear, and good, and
most hapless fellow, and now in great trouble of mind.”
If he had only said “in great bodily danger,” it inight have made
a difference.
“Your interest in him is very kind; and I trust that he will be
grateful, which he never was to me. He has left his home in de-
fiance of me. I can do nothing for him until he comes back, and is
penitent. But surely the question concerns me rather than you,
Mr. Rosedew."
“I am sorry to find,” said the parson quite calmly, “ that you
think me guilty of impertinence and meddling. But even that I
would bear, as becomes my age and my profession,”—here he gave
Sir Cradock a glance, which was thoroughly understood, because
they had been at school together,—"and more than that I would
do, Cradock Nowell, for a man I have loved like you, sir.”
That" sir” came out very oddly. Mr. Rosedew put it in by way
of proud apology for having called him “Cradock Nowell,” and as
a salve to self-respect, lest he might have been too appealing. And
to follow up this view of the subject, he made a bow such as no man
makes to one from whom he begs any thing.
But Sir Cradock Nowell lost altogether the excellence of the bow.
The parson had put up his knee in a way which took the old man
back to Sherborne. His mind was there playing cob-nut, as fifty
years since, with John Rosedew. Once more he saw the ruddy, and
then pugnacious, John bringing his calf up, and priming his knee,
for the cob-nut to lie upon it. This he always used to do, and not
care a flip for the whack upon him, instead of using his blue cloth
cap, as all the other boys did ; because his father and mother were
poor, and could only afford him one cap per annum.
And so the grand bow was wasted, as most formalities are ; but
if John had only known when to stop, it might have been all right
after all, in spite of Georgie Corklemore.
But urged by the last and most vexatious infirmity of noble minds,
our parsons never do know the proper time to stop. Excellent men,
and admirable, they make us shrink from eternity, by proving them-
selves the type of it.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Mr. Rosedew spoke well and eloquently, as he was sure to
do ; but it would have been better for his cause if he had simply
described the son's distress, and left the rest to the father's
heart. At one time, indeed, poor old Sir Cradock, who was
obstinate and misguided, rather than cold and unloving, began to
relent, and a fatherly yearning fluttered in his grey-lashed eyes.
But at this critical moment, three little kicks at the door were
heard, and the handle rattled briskly; then a shrill little voice came
through the key-hole,–
“Oh pease let Fore tum in. Pease do, pease do, pease do. Me
’ost me ummy top. Oh you naughty bad door!”
Then another kick was administered by small but passionate
toe-toes. Of course your mother did not send you, innocent bright-
haired popples, and with a lie so pat and glib in that pouting pearl-
set mouth. Foolish mother, if she did, though it seal Attalic bargain !
Sir Cradock went to the door, and gently ordered the child away.
But the interruption had been enough—ibi omnis effusus labor.
When he returned and faced John Rosedew, the manner of his visage
was altered. The child had reminded him of her mother, and that
graceful, gushing, loving nature, which tried so hard not to doubt the
minister. So he did what a man in the wrong generally does in-
stinctively ; he swept back the tide of war into his adversary's
country.
“ You take a very strong interest, John, in one whose nearest rela-
tions have been compelled to abandon him."
“ I thought that your greatest grievance with him was that he had
abandoned you."
“Excuse me; I cannot split hairs. All I mean is that some-
thing has come to my knowledge—not through the proper channel,
not from those who ought to have told me--something which makes
your advocacy seem a little less disinterested than I might have
supposed it to be.”
“ Have the kindness to tell me what something it is."
Oh, perhaps a mere nothing. But it seems a significant
rumour.”
“What rumour, if you please ?"
“That my—that Cradock Nowell is attached to your daughter,
who behaved so ill to me. Of course, it is not true?"
Perfectly true, every word of it.”
Speaking thus, Mr. Rosedew looked at Sir Cradock Nowell as
proudly as ever a father looked. Amy, in his opinion, was peeress
for any mortal. And perhaps he was not presumptuous.
Sir Cradock Nowell said never a word; but his face was not
discouraging only, but to a proud man mortifying.
“Why,” continued Mr. Rosedew, with unfeigned surprise, “I
would have told you long ago, the moment that I knew it, but for
your great trouble, and your bitterness towards him. You have

often wished that a son of yours should marry my daughter Amy.
Surely you will not blame him for desiring to do as you wished ?".
“No, because he is young and foolish ; but I may blame you for
encouraging it, now that he is the only one."
Do you dare to think that I am in any way moved by interested
ryotives ?"
“I dare to think what I please. No bullying here, John, if you
please. We all know how conibative you are. And now you have
forced me to it, I will tell you what will be the conviction, ay, and
the expression of every one in this county, except those who are
afraid of you. 'Mr. Rosedew has entrapped the future Sir Cradock
Nowell, hushed up his trouble, and made all snug for his daughter
at Nowelhurst Hall.'”
Sir Cradock did not mean half his words, any more than the rest
of us do, when hurt; and he was bitterly sorry for them the
moment they were past his lips.
Those words put a barrier, as of iron, between him and John Rose-
dew, between him and his own conscience, for many a day and
night to come.
Have you ever seen a pure good man, a man of large intellect and
heart (a lover of truth, and justice, of honour, and of dignity), confront,
without warning, some black charge, some despicable calumny, in
a word (for we all do love strong English, and nothing else will tell
it), some damned lie? If not, hope that you never may, for it makes
a man's heart burn so.
John Rosedew was not of the violent order. Indeed, as his sister
Eudoxia said, and to her own great comfort knew, his cistern of
wrathfulness was so small, and the supply-pipe so unready-as must
be where the lower passions filter through the intellect--that most

few of those who knew him could have borne to make the trial.
hurt as he was to the very depth of his heart, he was
indignant more than angry.
“ It would have been more manly of you, Sir Cradock Nowell, to
have said this very mean thing yourself, than to have put it into
the mouths of others. I grieve for you, and for myself, that so
mean a man was ever my friend. Perhaps you have still some
relics of gentlemanly feeling which will lead you to perform a
host's duty towards his visitor. Have the kindness to order my
horse."
Then John Rosedew, so punctilious, so polite to the poorest cot-
tager, turned his broad back upon the baronet, and as he slowly
walked to the door, these words came over his shoulder :-
“To-day you will receive my resignation of your two benefices.
If I live a few years more, I will repay you all they have brought
me above a curate's stipend. My daughter is no fortune-hunter,
She never shall see your son again, unless he renounce you and

yours for ever, or you come and implore us humbly as now you
have spoken arrogantly, contemptibly, and meanly."
Then, fearing lest he had been too grand about a little matter-
not his daughter's conduct, but the aspersion upon himself-he
closed the door very carefully, so as not to make any noise, and
walked away towards his home, forgetting Coræbus utterly. And,
before his fine solid face beg to recover its healthy and bashful
pink, he was visited by sore misgivings as to his own behaviour.
To wit, what claim had any man, however elate with the pride of
right and the scorn of wrong, to talk about any fellow-man becom-
ing humble to him? Nevertheless, he could not manage to retract
the wrong expression in his letter of resignation ; not from any false
pride--oh no!—but for fear of being misunderstood. But that very
night he craved pardon of Him before whom alone we need humbly
bow; who alone can grant us any thing really worth having.
CHAPTER XLIX.
BEAUTY AMID SCENES OF BEAUTY.
What is lovelier, just when Autumn throws her lace around us,
and begs us not to begin to think of any spiteful winter, because
she has not yet unfolded half the wealth of her bosom, and will not
look over her shoulder—when we take that rich one gaily for her
gifts of beauty ; what among her clustered hair, freshened with the
hoar-frost in imitation of the Spring (all fashions do recur so), tell
us what can be more pretty, pearly, light, and elegant, more
memoried of maidenhood, than a jolly spider's web?
See how the diamonds quiver and sparkle in the September
morning! What jeweller could have set them so ? All of gra-
duated light and metrical proportion, every third pre-eminent,
strung on soft aerial tension, as of woven hoar-frost, and every car-
rying thread encrusted with the breath of fairies, then crossed and
latticed at just angles, with narrowing interstices, to a radiated octa-
gon—the more we look, the more we wonder at the perfect tracery.
Then, if we gently breathe upon it, or a leaf of the bramble shivers,
how from the open centre a whiff of waving motion flows down
every vibrant radius, every weft accepts the waft slowly and lulling
vibration, every stay-rope jerks and quivers, and all the fleeting
subtilty expands, contracts, and undulates.
Yet if an elegant spider glide out, exquisite, many-dappled, pel-
lucid like a Scotch pebble or a calceolaria, with a dozen dimples

upon his back, and eight fierce eyes all up for business, the moment
he slips from the blackberry-leaf, all sense of beauty is lost to the
gazer, because he thinks of rapacity.
And so, perhaps, Mr. Rosedew's hat described in the air a flourish
of more courtesy than cordiality, when he saw Mrs. Corklemore
gliding forth from the bend of the road in front of him. Although
she had left the house after him, by the help of a short cut through
the gardens, where the rector would no longer take the liberty of
trespassing, she contrived to meet him as if herself returning from
the village.
Oh, Mr. Rosedew, I am so glad to see you,” cried Georgie, as
he tried to escape with his bow; “what a fortunate accident !”
“Indeed!” said John, not meaning to be rude, but unwittingly
suggesting a modified view of the bliss.
Ah, I am so sorry; but you are prejudiced against me, I fear,
because my simple convictions incline me to the Low Church
view."
That hit was a very clever one. No other bolt she could have
shot would have brought the parson to bay so, upon his homeward
road, with the important news he bore.
I assure you, Mrs. Corklemore, I beg to assure you most dis-
tinctly, that you are quite wrong in thinking that. Most truly 1
hope that I have allowed no prejudice, upon such grounds, to dwell
for a moment with me."
“Then you are not a ritualist? And you think, so far as I un-
derstand you, that the Low Church people are quite as good as the
High Church?”
I hope they are as good ; still I doubt their being as right. But
charity is greater even than faith and hope. And, for the sake of
charity, I would wash all rubrics white. If the living are rebuked
for lagging to bury their dead, how shall they be praised for battling
over the Burial Service ?
Mrs. Corklemore, quick as she was, did not understand the allu-
sion. Mr. Rosedew referred to a paltry dissension over a corpse in
Oxfordshire, which had created strong disgust, far and near, among
believers ; while infidels gloried in it. Such a thing cannot be too
soon forgotten and forgiven.
“Oh, Mr. Rosedew, I am so glad that your sentiments are so
liberal. I had always feared that liberal sentiments proceeded from,
or at least were associated with, weak faith."
I hope not, madam. The most liberal One I have ever read
of was God as well as man. But I cannot speak of such matters
casually, as I would talk of the weather. If your mind is uneasy,
and I can in any way help you, it is my duty to do so."
“Oh, thank you. No; I don't think I could do that. We are
such Protestants at Coo Nest. Forgive me, I see I have hurt
you."

oh yes,
“You misunderstand me purposely," said John Rosedew, with
that crack of perception which comes (like a chapped lip) suddenly
to folk who are too charitable, “ or else you take a strangely inten-
sified view of the simplest matters. All I intended was
Oh yes, I am always misunderstanding every body. I
am so dreadfully stupid and simple. But will you try to relieve my
mind, if you think you can, Mr. Rosedew?"
Here Georgie held out the most beautiful hand that ever darned
a dish-cloth, so white, and warm, and dainty, from her glove and
pink muff-lining. Mr. Rosedew, of course, was compelled to take
it, and she left it a long time with him.
To be sure I will, if it is in my power, and you will only tell me
how."
“It is simply this,” she answered meekly, dropping her eyes, and
sighing ; "I do so long to do good works, and never can tell how to
set about it. Unhappily, I am brought so much more into contact
with the worldly-minded, than with those who would improve me;
and I feel a need of something, something sadly deficient in my
spiritual state. Could you assign me a district any where? I am
sadly ignorant, but I might do some little ministering, feeling as I
do for every one. If it were only ten cottages, with an interesting
sheep-stealer!. Oh, that would be so charming. Can I have a
sheep-stealer ?”
“I fear I cannot accommodate you "—the parson was smiling in
spite of himself, she looked so beautifully earnest; we have no
felons here, and scarcely even a hen-stealer. Though I must not
take any credit for that. Every house in the village is Sir Cradock
Nowell's, and Mr. Garnet is not long in ousting the evil-doers."
“Oh, Sir Cradock ; poor Sir Cradock !” Here she came to the
real object of her expedition. Oh, Mr. Rosedew, tell me kindly,
as a Christian minister ; I am in so difficult a position, -have you
noticed in poor Sir Cradock any thing strange of late, any thing oad
and lamentable ?"
Mr. Rosedew hated to be called a “minister,"—the Dissenters
love the word so, and even the great John had his weaknesses.
“ I trust I should tell you the truth, Mrs. Corklemore, whe: har
invoked as a minister, or asked simply as a man.”
“No doubt you would—of course you would. I am always
making such mistakes. I am so unused to clever people. But do
į tell me, in any capacity which may suit you best”-it was foolish of
her not to forego that little repartee—“whether you have observed
of late any thing odd and deplorable, any thing we who love him
Here she hesitated, and wiped her eyes.
“ Though Sir Cradock Nowell,” replied Mr. Rosedew, slowly, and
buttoning up his coat at the risk of spoiling his cock's-comb frill,
“is no longer my dearest friend, as he was for nearly fifty years, it ,
does not become me to speak about him confidentially and dispa-

ragingly to a lady whom I have not had the honour of seeing more
than four times, including therein the celebration of Divine service,
at which a district-visitor should attend with some regularity, if only
for the sake of example. Mrs. Corklemore, I have the honour of
wishing you good morning."
Although the parson had neither desire nor power to pierce the
lady's schemes, he felt, by that peculiar instinct which truly honest
men have (though they do not always use it), that the lady was dis-
honest, and dishonestly seeking something Else had' he never
uttered a speech so unlike his usual courtesy. As for poor simple
Georgie, she was rolled over too completely to do any thing but
gasp. Then she went to the gorse to recover herself; and presently
she laughed, not spitefully, but with real amusement at her own
discomfiture.
Being quite a young woman still, and therefore not spe longa, and
feeling a want of sympathy in waiting for dead men's shoes, Mrs.
Corklemore, who had some genius, and therefore much fine ardour,
that sweet mother of a sweeter child (if so much of the saccharine
be admitted by Chancellors of the Exchequer, themselves men of
more alcohol), what did she do but devise a scheme to wear the
shoes, ipso vivo, and put the old gentleman into the slippers.
How very desirable it was that Nowelhurst Hall, and those vast
estates, should be in the possession of some one who knew how to
enjoy them, and make a proper use of them! Poor Sir Cradock
never could do so; it was painfully evident that he never more
could discharge his duties to society, that he was listless, passive,
somnolent,-somnambulant perhaps she ought to say, a man walk-
ing in a dream. She had heard of cases,-more than that, she had
actually known them,-sad cases in which that pressure on the
brain, which so frequently accompanies the slow reaction from
sudden and terrible trials, had crushed the reason altogether,
especially after a certain age.” What a pity! And it might be
twenty years yet before it pleased God to remove him. He had a
tough and wiry look about him. In common kindness and
humanity, something surely ought to be done to relieve him,
to make him happier.
Nothing rough, of course ; nothing harsh or coercive. No per-
sonal restraint whatever, for the poor old dear was not dangerous ;
only to make him what she believed was called a “ Committee in
Chancery”-there she was wrong, for the guardian is the Com-
mittee—and then Mr. Corklemore, of course, and Mr. Kettledrum
would act for him. At least she should think so, unless there was
some obnoxious trustee, nder his narriage-settlement. That
settlement must be got at; so much depended upon it. Probably
young Cradock would succeed thereunder to all the settled estate
upon his father's death. If so, there was nothing for it, except to
make him incapable, by convicting him of felony. Poor fellow!

CRADOCK NOWELL.
She had no wish to hang him. She would not have done it for the
world ; and she had heard he was so good-looking. But there
was no fear of his being hanged, like the son of a tradesman or
peasant.
Well, when he was transported for life, with every facility for
repentance, who would be the next to come bothering ? Why, that
odious Eöa. As for her, she would hang her to-morrow, if she
could only get the chance. Though she believed it would never
hurt her; for the child could stand upon nothing. Impudent
wretch! Only yesterday she had frightened Georgie out of her
life again. And there was no possibility of obtaining a proper
influence over her. There was hardly any crime which that girl
would hesitate at, when excited. What a lamentable state of
morality! Could she be made to choke Amy Rosedew, her rival
in Bob's affection ? But no, that would never do. Too much
crime in one family. How would society look upon them? And it
would make the house unpleasant to live in. There was a simpler
way of quenching Eöa-deny at once her legitimacy. The chances
were ten to one against her having been born in wedlock-such a
loose, wild man as her father was. And even if she had been,
why, the chances were ten to one against her being able to prove it.
Whereas it would be very easy to get a few Hindoos, or Coolies, or
whatever they were, to deliver their opinion about her mother.
Well, supposing all this nicely managed, what next? Why, let
poor Sir Cradock live out his time, as he would be in her hands
entirely, and would grow more and more incapable; and when it
pleased God to release him, why then,“ thou and Ziba divide the
land," and for the sake of her dear little Flore, she would take good
care that the Kettledrums did not get too much of it.
This programme was a far holder one than that with which
Mrs. Corklemore had first arrived at the Hall. But she was
getting on so well, that of course her views and desires expanded.
All she meant at first was to gain influence over her host, and
irrevocably estrange him from his surviving son, by delicate
insinuations upon the subject of fratricide ; at the same time to
make Eöa do something beyond forgiveness, and then to confide
the reward of virtue to obituary gratitude.
Could any thing be more innocent, perhaps we should say more
laudable? What man of us has not the privilege of knowing a
dozen Christian mothers, who would do things of nobler enterprise
for the sake of their little darlings?
But now, upon the broader gauge which the lady had selected,
there were two things to be done, ere ever the train got to the
switches. One was, to scatter right and left, behind and before,
and up and down, wonder, hesitancy, expectation, interrogation,
commiseration, and every other sort of whisper, confidential, suge
gestive, cumulative, as to poor Sir Cradock's condition. The other

thing was to find out the effect in the main of his marriage-settle-
ment. And this was by far the more difficult.
Already Mrs. Corklemore had done a little business, without
leaving a tongue-print behind her, in the distributory process; and
if Mr. Rosedew could just have been brought, after that rude
dismissal, to say that he had indeed observed sad eccentricity,
growing strangeness, on the part of his ancient friend, why then he
would be committed to a line of most telling evidence, and the
parish half bound to approval.
But the parson's high sense of honour, and low dislike of Georgie,
had saved him from the neat, and neatly-baited, trap.
That morning Mr. Rosedew's path was beset with beauty, though
his daughter failed to meet him; inasmuch as she was looking for
him on the parish road, by which he would have returned of course,
if he had not forgotten his pony.
When he had left the chase, and was fetching a compass by the
river, along a quiet footway, elbowed like an old oak-branch, over-
lapped with scraggy hawthorns, paved on either side with good
intention of primroses, there, just in a nested bend where the bank
overhangs the stream, and you would like to lie flat and flip in a
trout-fly about the end of April, over the water came lightly
bounding, and on a mossy bank alighted, young Eöa Nowell.
" To and fro, that's the way I go; don't you see, Uncle John, I
must; only the water is so narrow. It scarcely keeps me in
practice.”
“Then your standard, my dear, must be very high. I should
have thought twice about that jump, in my very best days !”
“You indeed !” said Eöa, with the most complacent contempt;
eyeing the parson's thick-set figure and anterior development.
“ Nevertheless," replied John, with a laugh,"it is but seven and
forty years since I won first prize at Sherborne, both for the long
leap and the high leap; and proud enough I was, Eöa, of sixteen
feet four inches. But I should have had no chance, that's certain,
if you had entered for the stakes."
“How could I be there, Uncle John, don't you see, thirty years
before I was born ?"
“My dear, I am quite prepared to admit the validity of your
excuse. Tyrio cothurno ! child, what have you got on?”
“Oh, I found them in an old cupboard, with tops, and whips, and
whistles; and I made Mother Biddy take them in at the ankle,
because I do hate needles so. And I wear them, not on account of
the dirt, but because people in this country are so nasty and par-
ticular; and now they can't say a word against me. That's one
comfort, at any rate."
She wore a smart pair of poor Clayton's "vamplets,” and a dark
morning-frock drawn tightly in, with a little of the skirt tucked up,
and a black felt hat with an ostrich feather, and her masses of hair

rolled closely. As the bright colour shone in her cheeks, and the
heartlight outsparkled the sun in her eyes, John Rosedew thought
that he had never seen such a wildly beautiful, and yet perfectly
innocent, creature.
“Well, I don't know," he answered, very gravely, “ about your
gaiters proving a Palladium against calumny. But one thing is
certain, Eöa, your face will, to all who look at you. But why
don't you ride, my dear child, if you must have such rapid exer-
cise ?"
“Because they won't let me get up the proper way on a horse.
Me to sit cramped up between two horns, as if a horse was a cow !
Me, who can stand on the back of a horse going at full gallop !
But it doesn't matter now much. Nobody seems to like me
for it.”
She spoke in so wistful and sad a tone, and cast down her eyes
so bashfully, that the old man, who loved her heartily, longed to
know what the matter was.
“Nobody likes you, Eöa! Why every body likes you. You are
stealing every body's heart. My Amy would be quite jealous, only
she likes you so much herself.”
“I am sure, I have more cause to be jealous of her. Some
people like me, I know, very much ; but not the people I want
to do it.”
“Oh, then you don't want us to do it. What harm have we
done, Eöa ?”
“ You don't understand me at all, Uncle John. And perhaps you
don't want to do it. And yet I did think that you ought to know,
as the clergyman of the parish. But I never seem to have right
ideas of any thing in this country !"
“Tell me, my dear,” said Mr. Rosedew, taking her hand, and
speaking softly, for he saw two great tears stealing out from the
dark shadow of her lashes, and rolling down the cheeks that had
been so bright but a minute ago ; " tell me, as if you were my own
daughter, what vexes your dear heart so. Very likely I can help
you, and I will promise to tell no one."
Oh no, Uncle John, you never can help me. Nobody in the
world can help me. But do you think that you ought to know ?"
“That depends upon the subject, my dear. Not if it is a family-
secret, or otherwise out of my province. But if it is any thing with
which I have to deal, or which I understand-
Oh yes, oh yes! Because you manage, you manage all-all the
banns of matrimony."
This last word was whispered with such a sob of despairing
tantalization, that John, although he was very sorry, could scarcely
keep from laughing.
“You need not laugh, Uncle John. You wouldn't if you were in
my place, or could at all understand the ways of it. And as for its

333
being a family-secret, ever so many people know it, and I don't
care two pice who knows it now.”
“ Then let me know it, my child. Perhaps an old man can
advise you."
The child of the East looked up at him, with a mist of softness
moving through the brilliance of her eyes, and spake these un-
romantic words :-
“ It is that I do like Bob so; and he doesn't care one bit for
me.”
She looked at the parson, as much as to say, “What do you
think of that, now? I am not at all ashamed of it." And then she
stooped for a primrose bud, and put it into his button-hole, and
then she burst out crying.
Upon my word,” said Mr. Rosedew,“ upon my word, this is too
bad of you, Eöa.”
“Oh
yes,
I know all that; and I say it to myself ever so many
times. But it seems to make no difference. You can't understand,
of course, Uncle John, any more than you could jump the river.
But I do assure you that sometimes it makes me feel quite desperate.
And yet all the time I know what a foolish thing I am. And then
I try to argue, but it seems to hurt me here. And then I try not to
think of it, but it will come back again, it always will come back
again, and I am glad to have it. And then I begin to pity myself,
and to be angry with every one else in the world. And after that I
get better and whistle a tune, and go jumping. Only I take care
not to see him.”
“There you are quite right, my dear: and I would strongly
recommend you not to see him for a month.'
“ As if that could make any difference! And he would go and
have somebody else. And then I should kill them both.”
“Well done, Oriental ! Now, will you be guided by me, my
dear? I have seen a great deal of the world.”
“Yes, no doubt you have, Uncle John. And you are welcome to
say just what you like; only don't advise me what I don't like; but
tell the truth exactly."
“Then what I say is this, Eöa : keep away from him altogether--
don't allow him to see you, even when he wishes it, for a month at
least. Hold yourself far above him, as you are in every thing. He
will begin to think of you more and more. Why, you are ten times
too good for him. There is not a man in England who might not
be proud of you, Eöa, when you have learned a little dignity."
Somehow or other none of the Rosedews appreciated the
Garnets.
“Yes, I dare say; but don't you see, I don't want him to be
proud of me. I only want him to like me. And I do hate being
dignified."
“If you want him to like you, do just what I have advised.”

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“So I will, Uncle John. Kiss me now, to make it up. Oh, you
are such a dear !-don't you think a week would do, now?”
CHAPTER L.
TWO SMART LITTLE TERRIERS.
At high noon of a bright cold day in the early spring of March, a
labourer who had been “frithing," that is to say, cutting under-
wood, in one of the forest copses, came out into the green track, which
could scarce be called a lane," to eat his well-earned dinner.
As it happened to be a Monday, the poor man had a better
dinner than he would see or smell again until the following Sun-
day. For there, as throughout rural England, a working man,
receiving his wages on the Saturday evening, lives upon a sliding
scale throughout the dreary week. He has his “bit of hot” on
Sunday, smacking his lips at every morsel ; and who shall scold
him for staying at home to see it duly boiled, and feeling his heart
move with every stir of the steaming and savoury pot-lid, more
kindly than if he went to church, to watch the long, dry parson?
And he wants his old woman ʼlong of him; he see her so little all
the week, and she be always best-tempered on Sundays. Let the
young uns go to school to get their learning-though he don't much
see the use of it, and his father and mother lived happy without it,
and was allers respected—'bating that matter, which is beyond him,
let them go, if they will, to hear parson, and bring home his tale
to the old folk. Only let 'em come home good time for dinner, or
they had best look out. "Now, Molly, lift the pot-lid again. Oh,
it do smell 'nation good! But us ought to shove in another onion.”
Having held high feast on Sunday, and thanked the Lord, without
knowing it (by inhaling happiness, and being good to the children
-our Lord's own pets and delight), off he sets on the Monday
morning, to earn another eighteenpence—twopence a piece for the
young uns. And he means to be jolly that day, for he has got his
pinch of tobacco and two lucifers in his waistcoat pocket, and in
his frail a most glorious dinner hanging from a hedge-stake.
All the dogs he meets jump up on his back, because he smells so
good of meat; but he really cannot encourage them, with his own
dog so fond of bones, and having the first right to them. Of course,
his own dog is not far behind; for it is a law of nature, admitting
no exception, that the poorer a man is, the more certain he is to
have a doy, and the more certain that dog is to love him.


## p. 335 (#347) ############################################

TWO SMART LITTLE TERRIERS.

Pretermitting the dog, important as he is, let us ask of the
naster's dinner. He has a great hunk of cold bacon, from the
cabbage-soup of yesterday, with three short bones to hold it to-
gether, and a cross junk from the clod of beef (out of the same
great pot) which he will put up a tree for Tuesday ; because, if it
had been left at home, mother couldn't keep it from the children ;
who do scarce a stroke of work yet, and only get strong victuals to
console them for school upon Sundays. Then upon Wednesday
our noble peasant of this merry England will have come down to the
scraping of bones ; on Thursday he may get bread and dripping
from some rich man's house ; on Friday and Saturday nothing but
bread, unless there be cold potatoes. And he will not have fed in
this fat rich manner, unless he be a good workman, a hater of
public-houses, and his wife a tidy body,
Now this labourer who came out of the copse, with a fine appetite
for his Monday's dinner (for he had not been “spreeing” on Sun-
day), was no other than Jenl-not Jem Pottles, the oracle, but
the Jem who fell from the oak-branch, and must have been
killed or terribly hurt, but for Cradock Nowell's quickness. Every
body called him “Jem," except those who called him “father;"
and his patronymic, not being Norman, matters “nout to no-
body."
Now why could not Jem enjoy his dinner more thoroughly in the
copse itself, where the witheys were gloved with silver and gold,
and the primroses and the violets peeped, and the first of the wood-
anemones began to star the dead ash-leaves ?
In the first place, because in the timber-track happen he might
see somebody just to give “good day” to; the chances were
against it in such a lonesome place, still m' happen might so be.
And a man who has been six hours at work in the deep forgotten-
ness of a wood, with only birds and rabbits living, is liable to a
gregarious weakness, when it comes to feeding-time.
Furthermore, this particular copse had earned a very bad name.
It was said to be the harbourage of a white and lonesome ghost, a
ghost with no consideration for embodied feelings, but apt to walk
in the afternoon, in the glimpses of wooded sunshine. Therefore
Jem was very uneasy at having to work alone there, and very angry
with his mate for having that day abandoned him. And but that
his dread of Mr. Garnet was more than supernatural, he would
have wiped his billhook then and there, and gone all the way to the
public-house, to fetch back that mate for company,
Pondering thus, he followed the green track as far as the corner
of the coppice hedge, and there he sat down on a mossy log, and
began to dine delightfully. He had washed his hands at a little
spring, and gathered a bit of watercress, and fixed his square
of cold bacon cleverly into a mighty hunk of brown bread, like a
whetstone in its socket; and truly it would have whetted any plain

man's appetite to see the way he sliced it, and his concentrated
interest.
With his mighty clasp-knife (straight, not curved like a gar-
dener's) he cut little streaky slips along, and laid each on a good
thickness of crust, and patted it like a piece of butter, and fondly
looked at it for a moment, then popped it into his mouth, with a
vigorous resolution that the next should be a still better mouthful,
supposing such excellence possible. And all the while he rolled his
tongue so, and smacked his lips so fervently, that you saw the man
knew what he was about, dealt kindly with his hunger, and felt a
good dinner—when he got it.
“ There, Scratch,” he cried to his dog, after giving him many a
taste, off and on, as in fairness should be mentioned ; "hie in, and
seek it there, lad."
With that he tossed well in over the hedge—for he was proud of
his dog's abilities—the main bone of the three (summum bonum
from a canine point of view; and, after all, perhaps they are right),
and the flat bone fell, it may be a rod or so, inside the fence of the
coppice. Scratch went through the hedge in no time, having
watched the course of the bone in air (as a cricketer does of the ball,
or an astronomer of a comet) with his sweet little tail on the quiver.
But Scratch, in the coppice, was all abroad, although he had
measured the distance; and the reason was very simple—the bone
was high up in the fork of a bush, and there it would stay till the
wind blew. Now this apotheosis of the bone to the terrier was not
proven; his views were low and practical; and he rushed (as a
terrier ought to do) to an earthly-minded conclusion. The bone
must have sunk into the bosom of the earth, being very sharp at one
end, and heavy at the other. The only plan was to scratch for it,
within a limited area; and why was he called “Scratch," but for
scarifying genius?
Therefore that dog set to work, in a manner highly praiseworthy
(save, indeed, upon a flower-bed). First he wrought well with his
fore-feet, using them at a trot only, until he had scooped out a little
hole, about the size of a rat's nest. This he did in several places,
and with sound assurance, but a purely illusory bonus. Presently
he began in earnest, as if he had smelled a rat; he put out his
tongue and pricked his ears, and worked away at full gallop, all
four feet at once, in a fashion known only to terriers. Jem came
through the hedge to see what it was, for the little dog gave short
barks now and then, as if he were in a rabbit-hole, with the coney
round the corner.
“Mun there, mun, lad ; show whutt thee carnst do, boy."
Thus encouraged, Scratch went on, emulative of self-burial,
thrɔwing the soft earth high in the air, and making a sort of
laughing noise in the rapture of his glory.
After a while he sniffed hard in the hole, and then rested, and

then again at it. The master also was beginning to share the
little dog's excitement, for he had never seen Scratch dig so hard
before, and his mind was wavering betwixt the hope of a pot of
money, and the fear of finding the skeleton belonging to the ghost.
Scratch worked for at least a quarter of an hour, and then ran to
the ditch and lapped a little, and came back to work again, while
Jem stood by at a prudent distance, and puffed his pipe commensu-
rately, and wished he had somebody with him. Presently he saw
something shining in the peaty and sandy trough, about two feet from
the surface, something at which Scratch tried his teeth, but found
the subject ungenial. So Jem ran up, making sure this time that it
was the pot of money. Alas, it was nothing of the sort, nothing at
all worth digging for. Jem was so bitterly disappointed that he laid
hold of Scratch, and cuffed him well, and the little dog went away
and howled, and looked at his bleeding claws, and stood penitent,
with his tail down.
Nevertheless, the thing dug up had cost some money in its time,
for gunmakers know the way to charge, ií never another soul does.
It was a pair of gun-barrels, without any stock, or lock, or ramrod,
heavily battered and inarked with fire, as if an attempt had been
made to burn the entire implement, and then, the wood being con-
sumed, the iron parts had been kicked asunder, and the hot barrels
fiercely trampled on. Now Jem knew nothing whatever of guns,
except that they were apt to go off, whether loaded or unloaded ; so
after much ponderous thinking and fearing-fiat experimentum in
corpore vili-he summoned poor Scratch, and coaxed him, and
said, “ Hie, boy, vetch thic thur thin'!”
When he found that the little dog took the barrels in his mouth
without being hurt by them, and then dragged them along the
ground, inasmuch as he could not carry them, Jem plucked up
courage and laid them by, to take them home that evening.
After his bit of supper that night, Jem and his wife held counsel,
the result of which was that he took his prize down to Roger Sweet-
land's shop, at the lower end of the village. There he found tha*
industrious blacksmith working overtime, repairing a harrow, which
must be ready for Farmer Blackers next morning. The worthy
Vulcan received Jem kindly, for his wife was Jem's wife's second
cousin; and then he blew up a sharp yellow fire, and examined the
barrels attentively.
“Niver zeed no goon the likes o'thissom, though a ’ave 'eered say
as they makes 'em now to shut out o' t'other end, man. Whai, her
han't gat niver na brichin'! A must shut the man as shuts wi’

“What wull e' gie vor ’un, Roger? Her bain't na gude to ussen.”
“Gie thee a zhillin', lad, mare nor her be worth, on’y to bate up

accept the shilling; and this piece of beautiful workmanship, and
admirable “ Damascus twist,” was set in the corner behind the door,
to be forged into shoes for a cart-horse. So, as Sophocles well ob-
serves, all things come round with the rolling years : the best gun-
barrels used to be made of the stub-nails and the horse-shoes
(though the thing was a superstition); now good horse-shoes shall
be made out of the best gun-barrels.
But, in despite of this law of nature, those gun-barrels never were
made into horse-shoes at all, and for this simple reason :-Rufus
Hutton came over from Nowelhurst to have his Polly shodden ;
meanwhile he would walk up to the Hall, and see how his child Eöa
It is a most worshipful providence, and as clever as the works
of a watch, that all the people who have been far abroad, whether in
hot or cold climates (I mean, of course, respectively, and not that a
Melville Bay harpooner would fluke in with a Ceylon rifleman),
somehow or other, when they come home, groove into, and dove-
tail with, one another; and not only feel a pudor not to contradict
a brother alien, but feel bound by a sacramentum to back up each
other's histories. To this rule of course there are some exceptions
(explosive letters in the Times, for instance), but almost every one
will admit that it is a rule ; just as it is not to tell out of school.
As regards Rufus and Eöa, this association was limited (as all of
them are now-a-days, except in their powers of swindling), strictly
limited to a keen and spicily patriarchal turn. Eöa, somehow or
other, with that wonderful feminine instinct (which is far in advance
of the canine, but not a whit less jealous) felt that Rue Hutton had
admired her, though he was old enough to be her grandfather in
those precocious climates. And though she would not have had him,
if he had come out of Golconda mine, one stalactite of diamonds,
she really never could see that Rosa had any business with him.
Therefore, on no account would she go to Geopharmacy Lodge, and
she regarded the baby, now imminent there, as an outrage and an
upstart.
Dr. Hutton knew more about shoeing a horse than any of the
country blacksmiths; and as Polly, in common with many fast
trotters, had a trick of throwing her hind-feet inwards, and“ cutting:)
(as it is termed in the art), she liked to have her hind-shoes turned
up, and her hoofs rasped in a peculiar manner, which Sweetland
alone could execute to her perfect satisfaction.
“ Ha, Roger, what have you got here?” said Rufus, having re-
turned from the Hall, and inspected Polly's new shoes, which she
was very proud to show him.
“Naethin' at all, yer honour, but a bit o’a old anshent goon, as
happed to coom in last avening.”
Ancient gun, man! Why, it is a new breech-loader, only
terribly knocked about. I found it all out in London. But there
are none in this part of the country. How on earth did you come

;
by it? And what made you spoil it, you stupid, in your forge-
fire ?
“Her han't a bin in my varge-vire. If her had, herd niver a coom
out alaive. Her hath bin in a wood vire by the look o' the
smo-uk."
Then Roger Sweetland told Dr. Hutton, as briefly as it is pos-
sible for any New Forest man to tell any thing, all he knew about it;
to which the inquisitive doctor listened with the keenest interest.
“ And what will you take for it, Sweetland ? Of course it is
utterly ruined; but I might stick it up for a rose-stake, or some-
thing.”
“ I'll tak whutt I gie vor ’un; no mare, nor no less. Though
be warth a dale mare by the looks ov'un.”
“ And what did you give for it—twopence ?"
“As good a croon-pace as wor iver cooined. Putt ’un barck in
carner, if a bain't worth thart.”
Dr. Hutton was glad to get it for that; but the blacksmith looked
rather blue when he saw him, carefully wielding it, turn his mare's
head towards the copse where poor Jem was at work. For to lose
the doctor's custom would make his lie at four shillings premium an
uncommonly bad investment, and Jem was almost sure to “let out”
how much he had got for the gun-barrels.
After hearing all that Jem had to say, and seeing the entire pro-
cess of discovery put dramatically, and himself searching the spot
most carefully without any further result, and (which was the main
point of all, at least in Jem's opinion) presenting the woodman with
half-a-crown, and bidding him hold his tongue, Rufus Hutton went
home, and sagely preferred Harpocrates to Hymen.
The which resolution was most ungrateful, for Hymen had just
presented him with a perfect little Cupid, according to the very best
judges, including the nurse and the mother, and the fuss that was
made at the Lodge about it (for to us men a baby is neuter, a hete-
rogeneous vocable, unluckily indeclinable) ; really the way every
body went on, and worst of all Rufus Hutton, was enough to make
a sane bachelor bless the memory of Herod. However, of that no
more at present. Some one was quite awake to all the ridiculous
parts of it, and perfectly ready to turn it all to profitable account, as
an admirable reviewer treats the feeble birth of a novel.
That is to say, Mrs. Corklemore made the utmost of the geniality
of the caudle period, and of all the privileges conferred thereby on
ladies, and used her sympathetic power to such good effect, that
before long she had added one, and this the fundamental, step to
the ascending scale of the amiable monarch. For she could manage
baby, and baby could manage Rosa, and Rosa could manage Rufus.
Only Rufus was not lord of the world, except in his own and his
wife's opinion.
As soon as Dr. Hutton could get away from this charmed and

charming circle, he took the barrels to his own little room, and
examined them very carefully. Scarred as they were, and battered,
and discoloured by the fire, there could be no question as to their
having formed part of an implement but little known at that time,
to wit a patent breech-loading gun ; even the hinge and the bolt
still remained, though the wooden continuation of the stock was, of
course, consumed; moreover, there was no loop for ramrod, nor
screw-thread to take the breeching. Then Rufus went to a little
cupboard, and took out a very small bottle of a strong and mordent
acid, and with a feather slightly touched the battered, and crusted,
and rusty“ bridge,” in the place where a gunmaker puts his name,
and for the most part engraves it wretchedly. In breech-loading
guns, the bridge itself was only retained from the force of habit, and
perhaps the love of appearance ; for as the breech-end is so much
thicker than the muzzle-end of the barrel, and the interior a perfect
cylinder, the line of sight (if meddled with) should be raised instead
of being depressed at the muzzle-end, to give us a perfect parallel.
Of course we know that shot falls in its flight, and there is no pure
point-blank; but surely the allowance for, and correction of, these
defeasances, according to distance, &c., should be left to the marks-
man's eye and practice, not slurred by a crossing of planes at one
particular distance.
Leaving that to wiser heads, which already are correcting it (by
omitting the bridge entirely), let us see what Dr. Hutton did. As
the acid began to work, it was very beautiful to watch the clouding
and the clearing over the noble but fiercely-abused metal. There is
no time now to describe it-for which readers will be thankful-
enough that the result revealed the maker's name and address,
“L-, C--r-street," and the number of the gun. Dr. Hutton by
this time had made the acquaintance of that eminent gunmaker,
who, after improving greatly upon a French design, had introduced
into this country a rapid and striking improvement; an implement
of slaughter as far in advance of the muzzle-loader as a lucifer-match
is of Alint and tinder. And Rufus, although with a set design to
work out his suspicions, would have found it a very much slower
work, but for a bit of accident.
A few weeks ago he had been sauntering from Charing Cross to
the westward, looking in at every window (as his manner was, for he
loved all information), when suddenly he espied the
very moral”
-as the old women say—the exact fac-simile of the thing in his
waistcoat pocket.
Instantly he entered the shop, and asked a number of questions.
Though it was clear that he came to purchase nothing, he was re-
ceived most courteously; for it is one of the greatest merits of men
who take the lead with us, that they drop the snarl of the British
lion, and substitute for John Bull's jumble of surliness and serfdom,
the courtesy of self-respect

Then the brevity and simplicity of the new invention-for every
thing is new with us during five-and-twenty years; and it took
thirty years of persistent work to make Covent Garden sell rhubarb
-all the great advantages, which true Britons would consider of,"
were pointed out to Rufus Hutton, and he saw them in a moment,
though of guns he had known but little.
And now, by means of this information, he espied so much of import
in new discovery, that he resolved to neglect all other business,
and start for London the very next morning, if Rosa could be per-
suaded to let him, without having heard his purpose. But in spite
of all his eagerness, he did nothing of the sort; for Rufus junior
that very night was taken with some infantile ailment of a serious
kind, and for more than a month the doctor could not leave home
for a day even, without breach of duty towards his wife, and
towards the unconscious heir of his orchard-house and pyramids.
Troubles were closing round Bull Garnet, but he knew nothing of
them; and, to tell the truth, he cared not now what the end would
be, or in what mode it would visit him. All he cared for was to
defer (if it might be so) the violence of the outburst, the ruin of the
household, until his darling son should be matured enough of
judgment, and shaped enough in character, to feel, and to make
others feel, that to answer for our own sins is quite enough for the
best of us.
Yet there was one other thing which Mr. Garnet fain would see
in likely course of settlement ere the recoil of his own wrath should
sweep upon his children. It regarded only their worldly affairs ;
their prospects, when he should have none. And being the mixture
he happened to be—so shrewd, and so sentimental-he saw how
good it was to exert the former quality, when his children were
concerned ; and the latter, and far larger one, upon the world at
large.
He had lately made some noble purchase from the Government
Commissioners—who generally can be cheated, because what they
sell is not their own—and he felt that he was bound by the very
highest interests to be a capable grantee, till all was signed, and
sealed, and safely conveyed to uses beyond attaint of felony.
Therefore he was labouring hard to infuse some of his own rapidity
into the breasts of lawyers—which attempt proves the heat of his
nature more than world a world of testimony.

“Why should I care for life or death? The one is no good, and the
other no harm. What is existence but sense of self, severance for
one troubled moment from the eternal unity? We disquiet our-
selves, we fume, and pant-lo, our sorrows are gone, like the steam
of a train, and our joys like the noise behind it. Why should I
fear to be mad, any more than fear to die? What harm if the mind
outrun the body upon the road of return to God? And yet we look
upon loss of mind as a thousand times worse than loss of soul.

Not because we have read and heard it, in a hundred forms and

“ That naval captain, so well known as an explorer of the Ama-

light-hearted man by nature, and full of wit and humour. And yet,
in spite of wine and warmth, he made the summer twilight creep
with the sadness of his stories. Nevertheless, we hung upon them
with a strange enchantment; we drew more real pleasure from them
than from a world of drolleries. Poor Clayton tried to run away,
for he never could bear melancholy; but all he did was to take a chair
nearer to the voyager. As for me, I cried ; in spite of myself, I cried;
being carried away by the flow of his language, so smooth, and wide,
and gliding, with the mystery of waters.
And he was not one of those shallow men who talk for effect at
dinner-parties. Nothing more than a modest sailor, leaving his
mind to its natural course. Only he had been so long upon that
mighty river, that he never more could cease from gliding, ever
gliding, with it.
Once or twice he begged our pardon for the sweep of hazy sad-
ness moving (like the night on water) through his tales and scenery.
He is gone there again of his own free choice. He must die upon
that river. He loves it more than any patriot ever loved his
country. Betwixt a man and flowing water there must be more than
similitude, there must be deep, congenial, unutterable sympathy."

“ Tap-Robin, ahoy there! Ahoy, every son of a sea-cook of you.
Heave us over a rope, you lubbers. Would yer swamp us with
parson aboard of me?"
This was Mr. Jupp, of course, churning up Crad's weak ideas,
like a steam-paddle in a fish-pond. Perhaps the reason why those
ideas had been of such sad obscurity, and so fluxed with sorry sen-
timent, was that the vague concipient believed himself to be shipped
off for an indefinite term of banishment, without even a message
from Amy. Whereas, in truth, he was only going for a little voyage
to Ceylon, in the clipper ship Taprobane, A 1 for all time at Lloyd's,
and never allowed to carry more than twice as much as she could.
How discontented mortals are! Young Cradock surely ought to
have been even jollier than a sandboy, for he had a cabin all to him-
self (quite large enough to turn round in), and, what of all things we
Britons love best, a happy little sinecure. He was actually appointed
-on the strength of his knowledge of goods earned at the Cram-
jam terminus, but not through any railway influence (being no chip
of the board, neither any attorney's “love-child”—if there be such
a heterogeny), only through John Rosedew's skill and knowledge
of the world, Cradock was actually made “under-supercargo” of a
vessel bound to the tropics.
The clipper had passed Greenhithe already, and none had hailed
her or said“ Farewell.” The Taprobane would have no tug. She
was far too clean in the bows for that work. Her mother and grand-
mother had run unaided down the river ; even back to the fourth
generation of ships, when the Dutchmen held Ceylon, and doubtless
would have kept it, but for one great law of nature : no Dutchman
must be thin. “But even a Dutchman loses fat within ten degrees of
the line. So Nature reclaimed her dear Dutchmen from a position
which baffled even her resources. Most likely these regions are
meant, in the end, for the Yankee, who has no fat to lose, and is
harder to fry than a crocodile.
But who can stop to theorize while the Taprobane is dancing
along under English colours, and swings on her keel just in time to
avoid running down Mr. Rosedew and Issachar? Mr. Jupp is com-
bining business with pleasure, being, as you may say, under orders
to meet the Saucy Sally, and steer her home from Northfleet to the
Surrey Docks. So he has taken a lift in a collier, and met Mr.
Rosedew at Gravesend, according to agreement, and then borrowed
a boat to look out alike for Saucy Sally and Taprobane.
When words and gifts had been interchanged—what Amy sent is
no matter now; but Loo Jupp sent a penny 'bacco-box, which beat
father's out and out (as he must be sure to tell Cradock), and had
' Am I welcome?” on it, in letters of gold at least—when “ God
bless you” had been said for the twentieth time, and love tied the
tongue of gratitude, the Taprobane lay-to for a moment, and the
sails all shivered noisily, and the water curled crisply, and hissed

and bubbled, and the little boats hopped merrily to the pipe of the
rising wind.
Then Mr. Rosedew came down the side, lightly of foot and
cleverly ; while the under-supercargo leaned upon the rail and
sorrowfully watched him. Ponderously then and slowly, with his
great splay feet thrust into the rope-ladder, even up to the heel,
quite at his leisure descended that good bargeman, Issachar Jupp.
This noble bargee had never been seen to hurry himself on his own
account. He and his deeds lagged generally on the bight of a long
and slack tow-rope.
The sailors, not entering into his character, thought that he was
frightened, and condemned his apprehensive luminaries, in words of
a quarter the compass. Then Mr. Jupp let go with both hands,
stood bolt upright on the foot-rope, and shook his great fists at
them. “ Let him catch them ashore at Wapping, if the devil fore-
went his due ; let him catch them, that was all !" Thereupon they
gave him a round of cheers, and promised to square the account,
please God.
Mr. Rosedew and the bargeman looked up from the tossing
wherry, and way eir last farewell, the parson reckless of Sunday
hat, and letting his white locks glance and flutter on the cold March
wind. But Cradock made no reply.
“All right, gov'nor !” said Jupp, catching hold of the parson; “no
call for you to take on so. I've a been the likes o' that there mysel
in the days when I tuk' blue ruin. The rattisination of it are to
fetch it out of him by travellin'. And the Tap-Robin are a traveller,
and no mistake. Directly moment I comes to my fortin', I'll
improve self and family travellin'.”
Zakey, to assert his independence as his nature demanded,
affected a rough familiarity with the man whom he revered. The
parson allowed it as a matter of course. His dignity was not so
hollow as to be afraid of sand-paper. The result was that Issachar
Jupp, every time, felt more and more compunction at, and less and
less of comfort in, the unresented liberties.
As he said “good-bye” at the landing-place—for he had seen the
Sally coming-he put out his hand, and then drew it back with a
rough bow (disinterred from long-forgotten manners), and his raspy
tongue thrust far into the coal-mine of his cheek. But John Rose-
dew accepted his hand, and bowed, as he would have done to a
nobleman. Even if a baby smiled at him, John always acknowledged
the compliment. For he added Christian courtesy, and the humility
of all thoughtful minds, to a certain grand and glorious gift of
radiating humanity.
Cradock Nowell was loth to be sent away, and could not see the
need of it ; but doubtless the medical men were right in prescribing
a southern voyage, a total change of scene and climate, as the
likeliest means to re-establish the shattered frame and the tottering

mind. And so he sailed for the gorgeous tropics, where the sun
looks not askance, where the size of every climbing, swimming,
fluttering, or crawling thing (save man himself) is doubled ; where
life of all things bounds and beats-until it is quickly beaten-as it
never gets warm enough to do in the pinching zones, tight-
buckled.
Meanwhile John Rosedew went to his home-a home so loved
and fleeting—and tried to comfort himself on the road with various
Elzevirs. Finding them fail, one after another, for his mind was
not in cue for them, he pulled out his little Greek Testament, and
read what a man may read every day, and never begin to be weary;
because his heart still yearns the more towards the grand ideal, and
feels a reminiscence such as Plato the divine, alone of heathens,
won.
John Rosedew read once more the Sermon on the Mount, and
wondered how his little griefs could vex him as they did. That ser-
mon is grander in English, far grander, than in the Greek; for the
genius of our language is large, and strong, and simple-the true
spirit of the noblest words that ever on earth were spoken. How
cramped they would be in Attic Greek (like Mount Athos chiselled);
in Latin how nerveless and alien ! Ours is the language to express;
and ours the race to receive them.
What man, in later life, whose reading has led him through vexed
places-whence he had wiser held aloof-does not, on some little
touch, brighten, and bedew himself with the freshness of the morn-
ing, thrill as does the leaping earth to see the sun come back again,
and, dashing all his night away, open the power of his eyes to the
kindness of his Father?
John Rosedew felt his cares and fears vanish like the dew-cloud
among the quivering tree-tops; and bright upon him broke the
noon, the heaven wherein our God lives. Earth and its fabrics may
pass away; but that which came from heaven may surely be trusted
to go back again.
Meditating, comforted, strengthened on the way, Mr. Rosedew
came to his little hearth, and was gladdened again by little things,
such as here are given or lent us to amuse our exile life. Most of
us, with growing knowledge and keener sense of honesty, more
strongly desire from year to year that these playthings were dis-
tributed more equally amongst us. But let us not say “equably.”
For who shall impugn the power of contrast even to heighten the
zest of heaven?
Amy met him, his own sweet Amy, best and dearest of all girls, a
thoroughly English maiden, not salient like Eöa, but warmly kind,
and thoughtful, and toned with self-restraint. But even that last
she threw to the winds when she saw her father returning, and ran
with her little feet pattering, like sweet.gale leaves, over the gravel,
to the unpretentious gate.

“Darling father!” was all she said ; and he seemed to find it
quite enough.
Of late she had dropped all her little self-will (which used to vex
her aunt so), and her character seemed to expand and ripen in the
quiet glow of her faithful love.
Thenceforth, and for nearly a fortnight, Amy Rosedew, if sud-
denly wanted, was sure to be found in a garret, whose gable-window
faced directly towards the breadth of sea. When a call for her
came through the crazy door, she would slam up with wonderful
speed her own little Munich telescope, having only two slides and a
cylinder, but clearer and brighter than high-powered glasses, ten
stories long perhaps, and of London manufacture : and then she
would confront the appellant, with such a colour to be sure, and a
remark upon the weather, as sage as those of our weather-clerks,
who allow the wind so much latitude that they never contrive to hit
it. But which of the maids knew not, and loved her not the more
for knowing, that she was a little coast-guard now, looking out for
her eau de vie? Of course she saw fifty Taprobanes-every one more
genuine than its predecessor—and more than fifty Cradocks, some
thirty miles away, leaning over hearts of oak, with a faint sweet
smile, waving handkerchiefs as white as their own unsullied con-
stancy, and crying with a heavy sigh, “My native land, good
night!”
Facts, however, are stubborn things, and will not even make a
bow to the sweetest of young ladies. And the fact was that the
Ceylon trader fetched away to the southward before a jovial nortn-
east wind, and, not being bound to say any thing to either Plymouth
or Falmouth, never came near the field of gentle Amy's telescope.
That doctor knew something of his subject-the triple con-
glomerate called man—who prescribed for Cradock "Nowell,
instead of noxious medicines—medicina a non medendo—the
bounding ease and buoyant freedom of a ship bound southward.
Go westward, and you meet the billows, headers all of them,
exceeding even the glorious Psalmist's picture (for he was never in
the Bay of Biscay), and a wind that stings the tears of a patriot
with the everlasting brine. Go eastward, and you meet the ice, or
(in summer) shoals and soundings, and a dreary stretch of sand-
banks. Go northward, and the chances are that you find bad
chance of coming back. But go full-sail to the glorious south, and
well beyond the long cross-ploughings and headland of the Gulf
Stream, you slide into a quiet breast, a confidence of waters, over
which the sun more duly does his work and knows it, and under
which the growth of beauty weaves a world of wonder.
When shall we men leave off fighting, cease to prove the Dar-
winian theory, and the legends of Kilkenny (by leaving only our
tails behind us, a legacy for new lawsuits); and in the latter days
ask God the reason we were made for? When our savage life is

done with, and we are no longer cannibals—and at present canni-
bals are perhaps of more practical mind than we, for they have an
object in homicide, and the spit justifies the battle-field—when we
do at last begin not to hate one another; not to think the evil first,
because in nature prior; not to brand as maniacs, and marks for
paltry satire, every man who dares to think that he was not born a
weasel, and that ferocity is cowardice—then a man of self-respect
may begin to be a patriot. At present, as our nations are, all
abusing one another, none inquiring, none allowing, all preferring
wrong to weakness, if it hit the breed and strain ; each proclaiming
that it is the favoured child of God, the only one He looks upon
(merging His all-seeing eye in its squint ambition)—at present even
we must feel that “patriotism” is little more than selfishness in a
balloon.
Poor Cradock, wasted so and altered (when he left black London)
that nothing short of woman's true love could run him home with-
out check, began to feel the change of sky, and drink new health
from the balmy air, and relish the wholesome mind-bread, leavened
with the yeast of novelty. A man who can stay in the same old
place, and work the blessed old and new year at the same old work,
dwell on and deal with the same old faces, receive and be bound to
reciprocate the self-same old ideas, without crying out,“Oh, bother
you !" without yearning for the sea-view, or pining for the moun-
tain—that man has either a very great mind, or else he has none at
all. For a very great mind can create its own food, fresh as the
manna, daily, or dress in unceasing variety the fruit of other
intellects, and live thereon amid the grand and ever-shifting scenery
of a free imagination. On the other hand, a man of no mind gets
on quite contentedly, having never tasted thought-food; only wind
him up with the golden key every Saturday night, and oil him with
respectability at the Sunday service.
Now the under-supercargo of the Taprobane was beginning to
eat his meals like a man, to be pleased with the smell of new tar,
and the head-over-heel of the porpoises, and to make acquaintance
with sailors of large morality. In a word, he was coming back, by
spell and spate, to Cradock Nowell, but as yet so merely skew-
nailed to the pillar of himself, that any change of weather caused a
gape, a gap, a chasm.
Give him bright sun and clear sky, with a gentle breeze over the
water spreading wayward laughter, with an amaranth haze just
lightly veiling the union of heaven and ocean, and a few flying-fish,
or an albatross, for incident in the foreground-and the young man
would walk to and fro as briskly, and talk as clearly and pleasantly,
as any one in the ship could.
But let the sky gather weight and gloom, and the sullen sun hang
back in it, and the bright flaw of wind on the waters die out, and
the sultry air, in oppressive folds, lean on the slimy ocean—and

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Cradock's mind was gone away, like a bat flown into dark-
ness.
Sometimes it went more gradually, giving him time to be con-
scious that his consciousness was departing; and that of all things
was perhaps the most woeful and distressing. It was as if the weak
mind-fountain bubbled up reproachfully, like a geyser over-gargled,
and flushed the thin membrane and cellular tissue with more
thought than they could dispose of. Then he felt the air grow
chill, and saw two shapes of every thing, and fancied he was hold-
ing something when his hands were empty. Then the mind went
slowly off, retreating, ebbing, leaving shoal-ground, into long abey-
ance, into faintly-known bayous, feebly navigated by the nautilus of
m mory
It is not pleasant, but is good, now and then to see afar these
pretty little drawbacks upon our self-complacency—an article
imported hourly, though in small demand for export. However,
that is of little moment, for the home consumption is infinite.
How noble it is to vaunt ourselves, how spirited to scorn as faber
Him who would be father ; when a floating gossamer breathed
between the hemispheres of our brain makes imperial reason but
the rubbish of an imperious flood.
Upon a glaring torpid sea, a degree or two south of the line, the
Taprobane lay so becalmed that the toss of a quid into the water
was enough to drive her windward, or leeward, whichever you
pleased to call it. The last of the trade winds, being long dead,
was buried on the log by this time; and the sailors were whistling
by day and by night, and piping into the keys of their lockers; but
no responsive dimple appeared in the sleek cadaverous cheek of the
never-changing sea.
What else could one expect? They had passed upon the wind's-
eyes so adverse a decision-without hearing counsel on either side
—that really, to escape ophthalmia, it must close its eyelids. So
every thing was heavy slumber, sleep of parboiled weariness.
Where sea and sky met one another—if they could do it without
moving-the rim of dazzled vision whitened to a talc-like glimmer.
Within that circle all was tintless, hard as steel, yet dull and oily,
smitten flat with heat and haze. Not a single place in sky or sea
to which a man might point his finger, and say to his mate, “ Look
there !” No skir of fish, not even a shark's fin, or a mitching
dolphin, no dip of wing, no life at all, beyond the hot rim of the ship,
or rather now the “vessel,” where many a man lay frying, with
scarcely any lard left. And how the tar and the pitch did smell,
running like a cankered apricot-tree, and the steam of the bilge-
water found its way up, and reeked through the yawning deck-
seams!
But if any man durst look over the side (being gifted with an
Egyptian skull, for to any thin head the sunstroke is death, when

caken upon the crown), that daring man would have seen in blue
water, some twenty fathoms below him, a world of life, and work,
and taste, complex, yet simple, more ingenious than his deftest
labours. For here no rough rivers profane the sea with a flood of
turbulent passion, like a foul oath vented upon the calm summer
twilight; neither is there strong indraught from the tossing of
distant waters, nor rolling leagues of mountain surf, as in the
Indian Ocean. All is heat and sleep above, where the sheer dint of
the sun lies; but down in the depth of those glassy halls they
heed not the fervour of the noon-blaze, nor the dewy sparkle of
starlight.
“Typhoon by-and-by," said the first mate, yawning, but too lazy
to stretch, under the awning of a sail which they wetted with a
hydropult, a most useful thing on shipboard, as well as in a garden.
“Not a bit of it,” answered the captain, looking still more lazy,
but managing to suck cold punch.
“We shall see,” was all the mate said. It was a deal too hot to
argue, and he was actually drinking ale, English bottled ale, hoisted
up from a dip in blue water, but as hot as the pipes in a pinery.
The under-supercargo heeded not these laconic interchanges.
The oppression was too great for him. Amid that universal blaze
and downright pour of stifling heat, his mind was gone wool-gather-
ing back into the old New Forest. The pleasant stir of the
stripling leaves, the shadows weaving their morrice-dance, and
trooping away on the grass-tufts at the pensive steps of evening ;
the sound and scent of the vernal wind among the blowing gorse;
the milky splash of the cuckoo-flower in swarded breaks of wood-
land, the bees in the belfry of cowslips, the frill of the white wind-
flower, and the fleeting scent of violets—all these in their form and
colour moved, or lay in their beauty before him, while he was
ng against the side-rail, and it burned his hand to touch it.
“Wants a wet swab on his nob," said the first mate tersely ;
“never come to himself, sure as my name is Cracklins.”
“Don't agree with you," answered the captain, who always
snubbed the mate ; "he's a sight better now than at Blackwall.
Poor young gent, I like him.”
“So do I," said the mate, pouring out more boiling beer; but
that ain't much to do with it. There's the wet swab anyhow.”
About an hour before sunset, when the sky was purple, and the
hot vapours piling away in slow drifts, like large haycocks walking,
a gentle breeze came up and made little finger-marks on the water.
First it awoke shy glances and glosses, light as the play upon
richly-glazed silk, or the glimpse upon mother-of-pearl. Then it
breathed on the lips of men, and they sucked at it as at spring-
water. Then it came sliding, curling, ruffling, breaking the image
of sky upon sea, but bringing earthly life and courage, hope, and
the spirit of motion. Many a ruff and gruff tar shed tears, not

knowing the least about them, only from nature's good-will and
power, as turpentine flows from the pine-wood.
“Hearty, my lads, and bear a hand.” Pipe my eye, and be
blessed to me!” They rasped it off with their tarry knuckles, and
would knock down any one of canine extraction, who dared to say
wet was the white of their eyes.
The gurgling of the water sounded like the sobs of a sleeping
child, as it went dapping and lipping and lapping, under the bows
and along the run of the sweetly-gliding curvature. Soon you could
see the quiet closure of the fluid behind her, the fibreing first (as of
parted hair) convergent under the counter, the dimples circling in
opposite ways on the right and left of the triangle, and then the
linear ruffles meeting, and spreading away in broad white union,
after a little jostling. You may see the same at the tail of a mill-
stream, when the water is bright in July, and the alder-shade falls
across it. For the sails were beginning to draw again now, and the
sheets and tacks were tightening, and the braces creaking merrily,
and every bit of man-stuff on board felt his heart go, and his lungs
work. Therefore all were glad and chaffing, as the manner is of
Britons, when the man in the foretop shouted down,“ Land upon
the port-bow."
I have looked for it all day," said the captain ; "I was right to
half a league, Smith.”
The skipper had run somewhat out of his course to avoid a
cyclone to the westward, but he had not allowed sufficiently for the
indraught of the Gulf of Guinea, and was twenty leagues more to
the eastward than he had any idea of being. Nevertheless, they
had plenty of sea-room, and now from the trending of the coast
might prudently stand due south. They had passed Cape Lopez
three days ago, of course without having sighted it, and had run by
the log three hundred miles thence, despite the dead calm of that
day. So they knew that they could not be very far from the mouth
of the river Congo.
As they slipped along with that freshening breeze, the water lost
its brightness, and soon became of a yellowish hue, as if mixed with
a turbulent freshet. Then they lay-to in fifteen fathoms, and sent
off a boat to the island, for the intense heat of the last few days had
turned their water putrid. The first and second mates were going,
and the supercargo took his gun, and declared that he would stretch
his legs and bring home some game for supper. What island it was
they were not quite sure, for there was nothing marked on the charts
just there, to agree with their reckoning and log-run. But they
knew how defective charts are.
When the water-casks were lowered, and all were ready to shove
off, and the mast of the yawl was stepped, and the sail beginning to
flap and jerk in a most impatient manner, Cracklins, who was a
good-natured fellow, hollaed out to Cradock,-
“Come along of us Newman, old fellow. You want bowsing up,

351
I sce. Bring your little dog for a run, to rout up some rabbits or
monkeys for Tippler. And have a good run yourself, my boy.”.
Without stopping to think—for his mind that day had only been
a dream to him-Cradock Nowell went down the side, with Wena
on his arm, and she took advantage of the occasion to lick his face
all over.
Then he shuddered unconsciously at the gun which lay
under the transoms.
“Look sharp, Cracklins," shouted the captain from his window;
“the glass is down, I see, half an inch. I can only give you two
hours."
All right, sir," answered the mate ; "but we can't fill the casks
in that time, unless we have wonderful luck."
The land lay about a mile away, and with the sail beginning to
tug, and four oars dipping vigorously,-for the men were refreshed
by the evening breeze, and wild for a run on shore,- they reached
it in about ten minutes, and nosed her in on a silvery beach strewn
with shells innumerable. A few dwarf rocks rose here and there,
and the line of the storms was definite, but for inland view there
was nothing more than a crescent terrace of palm-trees. The air
felt beautifully fresh and pure, and entirely free from the crawling
miasma of the African coast. "No mangrove swamps, no festering
mud, no reedy bayou of rottenness.
But the boat-crew found no fresh water at first ; and they went
in three parties to search for it. The mate with three men struck
off to the right, the boatswain with three more made away to the
left, only Cradock and the supercargo walked directly inland.
Wena found several rabbits, all of a sandy colour, and she did
enjoy most wonderfully her little chivies after them. Most of the
birds were going to rest, as the rapid twilight fell, but the trees
were full of monkeys, and here and there a squirrel shook the light
tracery of the branches.
Tippler and Cradock wandered inland for half a mile or more,
keeping along a pleasant hollow which they feared to leave, lest
they should lose the way back, and as yet they had seen neither
spring nor brook, although from the growth and freshness they
knew that water must be near them. Then suddenly the super-
cargo fired his gun at a flying green pigeon, whose beauty had
caught his eyes.
To his great amazement, Cradock fell down, utterly helpless, pale
as a corpse, not trembling, but in a syncope. His comrade tried to
restore him, but without any effect, then managed to drag him part
way up the slope, and set him with his back to an ebony-tree, while
he ran to fetch assistance. Suddenly then an ominous sound
trembled through the thick wood, a mysterious thrill of the earth
and air, at the coming of war between them. It moved the wild
grapes, the flowering creepers, the sinuous caoutchouc, the yellow
nuts of the palm-oil-tree, and the pointed leaves of the ebony.
When the supercargo ran down to the boat, the mer were rushing

off hastily, the water curling and darkening, and a sullen swell
increasing. A heavy mass of cloud hung to leeward, and the
iropical night fell heavily, till the ship was swallowed up in it.
Jump in, Tippler ! Just in time,” cried the first mate, seizing
the tiller-ropes; “not a moment to lose. We must go without
water ; we shall have enough out of the sky to-night. I could not
tell what to do about you, and the signals ''Return immediately.””
“But I tell you, we can't go, Cracklins. Poor Newman is up
there in a fit, or something. Send two men with me to fetch him.”
“How far off is he?”
Nearly a mile.”
“Then I daren't do it. We are risking our lives already. The
Typhoon will be on us in half an hour. Said so this morning-
skipper wouldn't listen. Jump in, man, jump in ; or we're off with-
Can't you see how the sea is rising ? Ease off the sheet,
you lubber there. We must down with the sail in two minutes, lads,
soon as ever we've got way on her. Lend a grip of your black fist,
Julep, instead of yawing there like a nigger. Now will you come,
or won't you ?”
Tippler was a brave and kind-hearted man; but he thought of
his wife and children, and leaped into the boat. Although he was
not a sailor, he saw the urgency of the moment, and confessed that
nine lives must not be sacrificed for the sake of one. The power of
the wind was growing so fast, and the lift of the waves so menacing,
that the nine men needed both skill and strength to recover their
ship, ere the storm burst.
And a terrible storm it was, of the genuine Capricorn type, sud-
den, deluging, laced with blue lightning, whirling in the opposite
direction to that which our cyclones take. At midnight the Tapro-
bane was running under bare poles, shipping great seas heavily,
with an electric coronet gleaming and bristling all around truck
and dog-vane. And by that time she was sixty miles from her
under-supercargo.
CHAPTER LII.
TWO GOOD RECEPTIONS.
DR. HUTTON'S baby was getting better, and Rosa, who had been,
as the nurse said, “ losing ground so sadly, poor dear," was begin-
ning to pick up her crumbs again. Therefore Rufus, who in
common with Rosa and all the rest of the household) regarded that
baby as the noblest and grandest sublimation of humanity, if not as

the final cause of this little world's existence, was beginning now to
make up his mind that he really might go to London that week,
without being (as his wife declared he must be, even to think of
such a thing) cruel, inhuman, unfatherly, utterly void of all sense of
duty, husbandly feeling, or common affection.
And she knew quite well what he wanted. All he wanted was to
go and see Mr. Rivers's peach-trees in blossom, as if that was such
a sight as her baby. Yes, her baby, ma's own darling, a dove of a
dumpling dillikins; to think that his own pa should prefer nasty
little trees without a hair on them, and that didn't even know what
“bo” meant, to the most elegant love of a goldylocks that ever was,
was, was!
Master Goldylocks had received, from another quarter, a less
classical, and less pleasing, but perhaps (from an objective point of
view) a more truthful and unprismatic description of the hair it
pleased God to give him.
“Governor's carrots, and no mistake,” cried Mrs. O'Gaghan the
moment she saw him, which, of course, was upon his first public
apr ance-catch Biddy out of the way when any baby, of any
father or mother she had ever heard of, was submitted even to the
most privileged inspection—“knew he must have 'em, of course.
You niver can conquer that, ma'am, if your own hair was like a
sloe, and you tuk me black briony arl the time. Hould him dacent
will yer, nurse ? Not slot his head down that fashion ! He don't
want more blood in his hair, child. Oh yes, I can see, ma'am!
Niver knowed more nor two wi' that red-hot poker colour, colour of
the red snuff they calls ‘Irish blackguard' in the top of a hot
shovel; and one of the two were Mr. Hutton, ma'am, saving your
presence to spake of it; and the other were of Tim Brady, as were
hung at the cross-roads, near Clonmel, for cutting the throat of his
grandmother."
Oh, Mary, take her away. What a horrid woman !”
Here Mrs. Gaghan was marched away, amid universal indigna-
tion, which she could not at all understand. But she long had
borne against Rufus Hutton the bitterest of all bitter spites (such
as only an Irishwoman can bear), for the exposure of her own great
mistake, and the miserable result which (as she fully believed) had
sprung from all his meddling. And yet she was a “good-hearted”
But a good heart is only the wad upon powder, when a
violent will is behind it.
Not to attach undue importance to Biddy's prepossessions, yet to
give every facility for a verdict upon the question, we are bound to
state what an old-young lady, growing every month more satirical,
because nobody would have her, yet quite unconscious that the one
drawback was the main cause of the other (for all men hate sarcastic
women),-how tersely she expressed herself.

But a lady, who would marry for ever, because she was so soft
and nice, came to see darling baby again, the moment she was quite
assured that he was equal to the interview, having denied herself
from day to day, although it had affected her appetite, and was
telling upon her spirits. Neither would she come alone—that
would be too selfish : she must make a gala day of it, and gratify
her relatives.
So Mrs. Hutton had the rapture of sitting behind her bedroom
curtain, and seeing no less than three carriages draw up in a thun-
dering manner ; while Rufus was in the greatest fright that they
would not find room to turn, but must cut up his turf. Luckily the
roller was in the way; or else those great coachmen, who felt them.
selves lowered by coming to a place of that size, would have had
their revenge on the lawn. The three carriages were, of course, that
of Nowelhurst Hall in the first rank, with two noble footmen behind
it, and Georgie in state inside. Then the “ Kettledrum rattletrap,"
as the iconoclastic termed it, with Mr. Kettledrum driving, and
striking statuesque attitudes for the benefit of the horses, and Mrs.
Kettledrum inside, entreating him not to be rash. Last of all the
Coo Nest equipage, a very neat affair, with Mr. Corklemore inside,
wanting to look at his wife in the distance, and wondering what she
was up to.
“Oh, such shocking taste, I know," cried Georgie, directly the
lower order were supposed to be out of hearing, “horribly bad taste
to come in such force; but what could we do, Dr. Hutton? There
was my sister, there was my husband, there was my own silly self,
all waiting, as for a bulletin, to know when baby would receive. And
so, at the very first moment, by some strange coincidence, here we
are all at once. And I do hope darling Rosa will allow some of us
to come in."
“Jonah,” shouted Rufus Hutton, going away to the door very
rudely (according to our ideas, but with Anglo-Indian instincts),
see that all those men have beer.”
“Plaise, sir, there bain't none left. Brewer hain't a been since
you had that there half-gallon.” As every one in the house heard
this, dear Georgie had some revenge.
However, babe Rufus received his ovation; and the whole thing
went off well; as most things do in the counties of England, when
plenty of good wine produces itself. Luncheon was ready in no
time ; and, as all had long ago assented to Mrs. Corklemore's most
unselfish proposition that she, as the privileged of pet Rosa, should
just steal up-stairs for a minute, and then come down again-after
giving notice, of course, that dear baby should have all his lace
on—the pleasant overture of the host was accepted with little
coyness :-
“Let us suppose that we have dined : because the roads are so
very bad. Let us venture upon a light dessert. I have a few pears,

355
even now in April, which I am not altogether afraid to submit to
the exquisite taste of ladies,—Van Mons' Inconnu,' and 'Jose-
phine. May we think that we have dined ?”
As the company not only thought, but felt that they had made an
uncommonly good dinner, this little proposal did pleasant violence
to their sense of time. It would be so charmingly novel to fancy
that they had dined at three o'clock! Oh, people of brief memory!
For Kettledrum Hall and Coo Nest loved nothing better than to
dine at two ; which, perhaps, is two hours too late, according to
nature versus fashion.
“For such an occasion as this,” said Rufus, under all the excite-
ment of hospitality multiplied by paternity,“ we will have a wine
worth talking of. Clicquot, of course, and Paxarette for the ladies,
if they prefer it; which perhaps they will do, because it is sweeter
than port. But I do hope that some will deign to taste my 1820,
President's unrefreshed.”
Georgie's pretty lip came out, like the curl of an opening con-
volvulus ; to think of offering her sweet wine, when choice port
was forthcoming! There are few, better judges of a good glass of
port than Mrs. Nowell Corklemore.
“ Port, sir, for my wife, if you please. She likes a rather dry
wine, sir, but with plenty of bouquet. There is no subject, I may
say, in which she has—ha, haw-a more profound capacity."
“My dear Nowell, why you are perfectly calumnious. Thank
you, no champagne. It spoils the taste of-your beautiful water.
How dreadfully we were alarmed in Ringwood. We all but drove
over a child. What a providential escape! I have scarcely yet
recovered it. It has made me feel so nervous. What, Dr. Hutton,
port for a lady, at this time of day, and not ordered medically !"
Thereupon, of course Rufus prescribed it, till Georgie, being quite
overcome by the brilliance, as the host himself decanted it, capitu-
lated at last for“ strictly half a glass.”
After a little, the ladies withdrew, to see double perfections in the
baby, and Mrs. Hutton, who knew quite well what they had been
doing, while she was discussing arrowroot, received them at first
rather stiffly. But she had no chance with Georgie, who entered
beautifully into the interesting room, and exclaimed with great
vivacity,
“Oh, dear Mrs. Hutton, as the little boys say, 'here we are
again.' And so glad to get away, because your husband is so
hospitable, and we thought of you all the time. I wanted so much
to bring you a glass of that very exquisite-let me see, I think it
must have been port, though I never know one wine from another-
only I feared it might seem rude, if I had ventured to propose it. Of
course Dr. Hutton knew best.”
Of course he didn't,” said Rosa pettishly; "he never thought
about it Not that I would have taken it; oh dear no! Ladies

cannot have too little wine, I think. It seems to make them so
masculine."
"Well, dear, you know best. Very likely you heard us laughing.
I assure you we were quite merry. We drank his health three
times three-don't they call it about a baby? And I was nearly
proposing yours; only a gentleman ought to do that. Oh, it was so
interesting, and the wine superb—at least, so said the gentlemen ;
I do wish they had brought you some, dear.”
I am very glad they did not. It is so very lowering to a fine sense
of the ideal. I heard you laughing, or making some noise ; only I
was so absorbed in these lovely poems. "To my Babe'is so very
beautiful, so expressive, so elevating! I feel every single word of
it. And this sonnet-about the first cropper! And the stanzas to
his little red shoes, terminating with 'pinch his nose !' You have
had so many husbands, dear; you must know all about it.”
“My darling child, how I feel for you! But, in all probability,
he will come up when both decanters are empty ; let him find you
in a good temper, dear.”
But this (which must have grown into a tiff, for Georgie had
even more spirit than tact, and Rosa was equal to any thing), all this
evil was averted, and harmony restored by the popping in of nurse,
who had not taken her half-crowns yet, but considered them desir-
able, and saw them now endangered.
Goldylocks, Goldylocks ! Oh, bring him here, nurse. Skillikins,
dillikins ! oh, such a dove! And if nobody else cares for poor
mamma, he has got so much better taste, hasn't he?”
Goldylocks very soon proved that he had ; and Georgie, having
quite recovered her temper, admired him so ecstatically, that even
his mother thought her judgment was really worth something.
“Give him to me; I can't do without him. Oh, you beautiful
cherub! Kicklewick, I am sure you never saw any one like
him."
“That indeed I never did, ma'am" answered nurse Kicklewick,
holding her arms out, as if she must have him back again ; “many
a fine child I have seen, and done for to my humble ability, ma'am,
since the time I were at Lord Eldergun's; and her ladyship said to
me, ' Kicklewick,' says she-"
Oh, his love of a nosey-posey ! Oh, then his bootiful eyes, dick,
dock ! And then his golden hair, you know, so lovely, chaste, and
rare, you know! Will um have a dancey-prancey ?”
And Georgie, forgetting all dignity, went through a little Polish
dance, with the baby in her arms, to his very grave amazement,
and the delight of all beholders.
Although of the genuine Hutton strain, he was too young to crow
yet, nevertheless he expressed approval in the most emphatic water-
colours, Mrs. Hutton's heart was won for ever.
“Oh, darling, I am so obliged to you. He has positively popped

two bubbles. A thing he never did before! How can I ever
repay you ? "
" By letting me come over and dance him twice a week. Oh, that
I only had a boy !-because I do love boy-babies so."
“One would think that you must have had fifty, at least, before
you were five-and-twenty! How on earth do you understand him
so ? I only know half what he means, though I try for hours and
hours.”
“Simply by sympathizing with him. I feel all his ideas come
home to me, and I put them into shape.”
“ You are the loveliest creature I ever saw.”
And, indeed, Georgie did look very well, for it was not all mere
humbug now, though perhaps it was at first.
“Oh, no wonder baby loves you. Kicklewick, isn't it wonderful ?”
“Indeed, then, and it would be ma'am," replied Mrs. Kicklewick,
rapturously-for now she had four half-crowns in her pocket-
“only for it bein' nature, ma'am. Nature it is as does it, as must
be. Nothing else no good again it. And how I should like to
be long of you, ma'am, when your next time come, please God.

have hopes to be again, ma'am, if any confidence in head-footman.

the wind a-blowin'-
“To be sure,” said Georgie, “and the water a-flowing ; how
cleverly you describe it ! ”
But we must cut her short, as she cut short nurse Kicklewick.
Enough that she won such influence over the kind but not too clever
Rosa, that Rufus Hutton's plans and acts, so far as they were known
to his wife, were known also to his wife's best friend.
But one thing there was which Mrs. Corklemore could not at all
understand,—why should he be going to London so, and wanting to
go again, in spite of domestic emergencies? She very soon satisfied
herself that Rosa was really in the dark upon this point, and very
indignant at being so. This indignation must be fostered and
pointed to a practical end. Mrs. Kettledrum, of course, had been
kept in the background all this time, and scarcely allowed to dandle
the baby, for fear of impairing her sister's triumph.
“How wonderfully kind and thoughtful of you !” said Rosa, as
Georgie came in again. “Have you really brought me a glass of
wine? And no one else in the house to suppose that I ought to
have any nourishment ! How can I thank you, Mrs. Corklemore ?”
No more 'Mrs. Corklemore, if you please. I have begun to
call you 'Rosa'-it is such a pretty name—and you must call me
•Georgie,' darling. Every one does who loves me.”
“Then I am sure all the world must. Dearest Georgie, how did
you get it? I am sure I would not touch it, only for your sake.”

onc."
Oh, I did such a shameful thing. Such a liberty I never took
before! I actually sent the servant to say, with Mrs. Corklemore's
compliments, that she felt the effect of the fright this morning, and
would like another glass of port, but would not touch it if any of
the gentlemen left the table even for a moment. And they actually
sent me a dock-glass, in pleasantry, I suppose: but I am very glad
they did.”
“I will take some, if you take half, dear.”
Not a drop. My poor weak head is upset in a moment. But
you really need it, dear; and I can.so thoroughly feel for you,
because the poor Count, when my Flore was born, waited on me
with such devotion, day and night, hand and foot.”
" And I am sure Mr. Corklemore must do the same. No husband
could help adoring you.”
“Oh, he is very good, 'according to his lights,' as they say. But
I have known him let me cough three times without getting up for
the jujubes. And once—but perhaps I ought not to tell you : it was
so very bad.”

that I must have a new fur cloak, or even asking if I had a cold.”
“Oh dear, is that all? I may sneeze six times in an hour, and
my husband take no notice, but run out and leave the front door
open, and prune his horrid little trees. And then he shouts for his
patent top-dressing. He thinks far more of dressing them than he
does of dressing me.”
“And don't you know the reason? Don't cry, sweet child ; don't
cry. I have had so much experience. I understand men so
thoroughly."
“Oh yes, I know the reason. I am cross to him sometimes.
And of course I can't expect a man with a mind like his-
“ You may expect any man to be as wise as Solomon, if you only
know how to manage him. It is part of the law of nature."
“Then I am sure I don't know what that means : except that
people must get married, and ought to love one another.”
“The law of nature is this. Between a wife and a husband there
never must be a secret, except when the lady keeps one. Now your
husband is, to some extent, a rather superior man-
“Oh yes, to the very greatest extent. No one of any perception
can help perceiving that.”
“Then he is quite sure to attempt it ; to reserve himself, upon
some point or other, in an unsympathetic attitude. This is just
what you must not allow. You have no idea how it grows upon
them, and how soon it supplants affection, and makes a married
man a mere bachelor.”
“Oh, how dreadful! But I really do think, dear, that you must

wrong this once. My husband has never kept any thing from
me; any thing, I mean, which I ought to know."
“Then he told you about that poor wild Polly? How very good
and kind of him!'
Polly! What Polly? You don't mean to say-
“No, no, dear, nothing of that sort ! Only the mare running
away with him at night through the thickest part of the forest.”
My Polly that eats from my hand! Run away with Rufus !”
Yes, your Polly. A perfect miracle that both of them were not
killed. But of course he must have told you.”
Then, after sundry ejaculations, Rosa learned all about that
matter, and was shocked first, and then thankful, and then hurt.
And now," said Mrs. Corklemore, when the sense of wrong was
paramount," he has some secret, I am almost sure, about our very.
sad affair at Nowelhurst. And I am sure, even if you were not his
wife, dear, he need not conceal any matter of that sort from the
daughter of Sir Cradock Nowell's old friend, Mr. Ralph Mohorn.”
“ I will tell you another thing," answered Rosa, shaking all her
pillows with the vehemence of her emotions, “whether he ought or
not, he shall not do it, Georgie darling. As sure as I am his lawful
wife I will know every word of it before I sleep one wink. If not,
he must take the consequences upon both his wife and child."
“Darling, I think you are quite right. Only don't tell me a word
of it. It is such a dreadful matter, it would make me so
happy-
“ I will tell you every single word, just to prove to you, Georgie,
that I have found the whole of it out."
After this laudable resolution, Rosa may be left to have it out
with Rufus. It requires greater skill than ours to interfere between
man and wife, even without the tertium quid of an astounding
baby.

it was nearly dark by this time, and two nightingales, across the
valley, strove in Amoibæan song till the crinkles of the opening
leaves fluttered with soft melody.

Her callow nestlings plunder'd from her by the ploughman rude :
From lonely branch all night she pours her weeping music's flow
Repeats her tale, and fills the world with melody and woe.
GEORG. iv. 511.
Mr. Garnet heeded neither crisp young leaf nor bulbul ; neither
did his horse appear to be a judge of music. Man and horse were
drooping, flagging, jaded, and bespent ; wanting only the two
things which, according to great authority, are all that men want
here below-a little food, and a deal of sleep.
Bull Garnet was on his return from Winchester, whither he now
went every week, for some reason known only to himself, or at least
unknown to his family. It is a long and hilly ride from the west of
Ytene to Winton, and to travel that distance twice in a day takes
the gaiety out of a horse, and the salience out of a man. No wonder
then that Mr. Garnet slouched his heavy shoulders, and let his
great head droop; for at five-and-forty a powerful man jades sooner
than a slight one.
Presently he began to drowse ; for the stout grey gelding knew
every step of the road, and would take uncommonly good care to
avoid all circumambience : and of late the rider had never slept,
only dozed, and dreamed, and started. Then he muttered to him-
self, as he often did in sleep, but never at home, until he had seen
to the fastening of the door.
“ Tried it again-tried very hard and failed. Thought of Bob, at
last moment. Bob to stand, and see me hang--and hate me, and
go to the devil. No, I don't think he would hate me, though; he
would say, 'Father could not help it. And how nice that would be
for me, to see Bob take my part. To see him with his turn-down
collars standing proudly up, and saying, 'Father was a bad man-
according to your ideas—I am not going to dispute them—but for
all that I love him, and so my children shall.? If I could be sure
that Bob would only think so, only make his mind up, his mind up,
his mind up-for there is nothing like it—whoa, Grayling, what be
looking at?-and take poor little Pearl with him, I would go to-
morrow morning, and do it over at Lymington.”

ear.
“ Best do it to-night, gov'nor. No time like the prasent, and us
knows arl about it.”
A tall man had leaped from behind a tree, and seized Bull
Garnet's bridle. The grey gelding reared and struck him ; but he
kept his hold, till the muzzle of a large revolver felt cold against his
Then Issachar Jupp fell back; he knew the man he had to
deal with, how stern in his fury, how reckless, despite the better
part of him. And Issachar was not prepared to leave his Loo an
orphan.
" No man robs me,” cried Mr. Garnet, in his most tremendous
voice, “except at the cost of my life, and the risk of his. I have
seven and sixpence about me; I will give it up to no man. Neither
will I shoot any man, unless he tries to get it.”
“Nubbody wants to rob you, gov'nor, only to have a little ratty-
sination with you. Possible you know me now?”
Bull Garnet fell back in his saddle. He would rather have met a
dozen robbers. By the voice he recognized a man whom he had
once well known, and had good cause to know ;-through his out-
rage upon whom, he had left the northern counties ; the man whom
he had stricken headlong down a coal-shaft, as the leader of rebellion,
the night after Pearl was christened, nigh twenty years ago.
“Yes, I know you ; Jupp your name is. Small credit it is to
know you."
“And smarler still to know you, Bull Garnet. Try your pistol
thing, if you like. You must have rare stommick, I should think,
to be up for another murder."
Issachar, I am sorry for you. Do you call it a murder to keep
such a fellow as you off?”
“No, I dunna carl that a murder, because I be arl alive. But I
do carl a murder what you did to young Clayton Nowell.”
"Fool, what do you know of it? Let go my horse, I say. You
know pretty well what I am.”
“I know you ha’n’t much patience, gov'nor, nor much rattysina-
tion."
Jupp hesitated, but would not be beaten, whatever might be the
end of it.
“Issachar Jupp, I am ready to listen to all you have to say. But
not with your hand on my bridle."
“There goeth free then. Arl knows you be no liar.”
“I am glad you remember that, Issachar. Hold the horse, while
I get off. Now throw the bridle over that branch, and I will sit
down here. Come here into the moonlight, man; and look me
in the face. Here is the pistol for you, if you bear me any
revenge.”
Scarcely knowing what he did, because he had no time to think,
Jupp obeyed Bull Garnet's orders even to the last-for he took the
pistol in his hand, and tried to look straight at his adversary; but

his eyes would not co-operate. Then he laid the pistol on the bank;
but so that he could reach it.
“Issachar Jupp," said Mr. Garnet, looking at him steadily, and
speaking very softly; “have you any children ?”.
“Only one-a leetle gal, but an oncommon good un."
“ How old is she ?"
Five year old, plase God, come next Valentine's Day.”
"Now, when she grows up, and is pure and good, would you like
to have her heart broken?”
“I'd break any cove's head as doed it.”
“But supposing she were betrayed and ruined, made a plaything,
and then thrown away–what would you do then ?"
“ God Almighty knows, man. I can't abide to think of it."
“And if the-the man who did it, was the grandson of the man
who had ruined your own mother, lied before God in the church to
her, and then left her to go to the workhouse, with you his outcast
bastard—while he rolled in gold, and laughed at her—what would
you do then, Jupp ?”
By the God that made me, I'd have my revenge, if I went to
hell for it."
“I have said enough. Do what you please. Me you cannot help
or harm. Death all I long for-when my duty is done to my
children.”
Still he looked at Issachar, but now without a thought of him
only as a man looks out upon the earth, or sea, or sky, without
expecting answer. And Issachar Jupp, so dense and pig-headed-
surly and burly, and weasel-eyed-in a word, retrospectively
British-gazing at Bull Garnet then, got some inkling of an anguish
such as he who lives to feel_far better were it for that man that he
had never been born.

To bar the entail of crime. A bitter and abortive task; at least, in
this vindictive world, where Christians dwell more on Mount Sinai
than on the mount that was not made to quake and burn with fire.
And yet for this, and little else, still clung to fair fame and life
the man who rather would have lain beneath the quick-lime of
Newgate. It was not for the empty part, the reputation, the posi-
tion, the respect of those who prove the etymon of the word by truly
looking backward—not for these alone, nor mainly, did Bull Garnet

bear the anguish now from month to month more bitter, deeper, less
concealable. He strove with himself, and checked himself, and bit
his tongue, and jerked back his heart, and nursed that shattered lie,
his life, if so might be that Pearl and Bob should start anew in
another land, with a fair career before them. Not that he cared,
more than he could help, whether they might be rich or poor; only
that he would like them to have the chance of choosing,
This chance had not been fair for him, forsaken as he was, and
outcast; banned by all the laws of men, because his mother had
been trustful, and his father treacherous. Yet against all chances,
he, by nothing but his inborn power, deeply hating, and (which was
worse) conscientiously despising every social prejudice, made his
way among smaller men, taught himself by day and night, formed
his own strong character, with the hatred of tyranny for its base,
and tyranny of his own for its apex; and finally gained success in
the world, and large views of Christianity. And in all of this he was
sincere !
It was a vile and bitter wrong to which he owed his birth. Sir
Cradock Nowell, the father of the present baronet, had fallen in
love (of some sort) with a comely Yorkshire maiden, whose mother's
farm adjoined the moors, whereon his shooting quarters were.
Then, in that period of mean licence, when fashionable servility
was wriggling, like a cellar-slug, in the slime-track of low princes,
Sir Cradock Nowell did what few of his roystering friends would
have thought of-unfashionable Tarquinian, he committed a quiet
bigamy. He had lived apart from Lady Nowell, even before her
second confinement; because he could not get on with her. So
Miss Garnet went with him to the quiet altar of a little Yorkshire
church, and fancied she was Lady Nowell; only that must be a
secret,“ because they had not the king's consent, for he was not in
a state to give it.”
When she learned her niddering wrong, and the despite to
her unborn child, she cast her curse upon the race, not with loud
rant, but long scorn, and went from her widowed mother, to a cold
and unknown place.
So soon as Bull Garnet was old enough to know right from
wrong, and to see how much more of the latter had fallen to his
share, two courses lay before him. Two courses now were possible
to a strong and upright nature; to a false and weak one fifty would
have presented themselves, and a little of each been taken. Con-
scious as he was of spirit, energy, and decision, he might apply
them all to very ungenial purposes, to sarcasm, contemptuousness,
and general misanthropy. Or else he might take a larger view,
pity the poor old-fashioned prigs who despise a man for his father's
fault, and generously adapt himself to the broadest Christianity.
The latter course was the one he chose ; in solid earnest, too,
because it suited his nature. And so perhaps we had better say

364
CRADOCK VOWELL.
that he chose no course at all, but had the wiser one forced upon
him. Yet the old Adam of damnable temper too often would rush
out of Paradise, and prove in strong language that he had learned
more of evil than of good perhaps. Exeter Hall would have owned
him, however, in spite of all backslidings, as a very “far-advanced
Christian;" because he was so “evangelical.” And yet he neve.
dealt in cant, nor distributed idyllic tracts, Sabbatarian pastorals,
where godly Thomas meets drunken John, and converts him in a
page and a half of monologic dialogue.
And now this man, whom all who knew him either loved or
hated, felt the troubles closing round him, and saw the end soon
coming. He had kept his own sense of justice down, while it
jerked (like a caltrop on springs) in his heart; he had worn himself
out with thinking and thinking what would become of his children,
whom he had wronged more heavily than his own bad father had
wronged him-only the difference was that he loved them; and
worst of all he had let a poor fellow, whom he liked and esteemed
most truly, bear all the brunt, all the misery, all the despair of
fratricide.
Now all he asked for, all he prayed for-and, indeed, he prayed
more than ever now, and with deeper feeling ; though every one
else would have feared to pray—now his utmost hope was to win
six months of life. In that time all might be arranged for his chil-
dren's interest; his purchase of those five hundred acres from the
Crown Commissioners-a il good land, near the Romsey-road, but
too full of juice-would soon be so completed that he could sell
again at treble the price, so well had he reclaimed the land, while
equitably his; and then Bob should have half, and Pearl take half
(because she had been so injured), and, starting with the proceeds
of all his earthly substance before it should escheat, be happy in
America, and think fondly of dead father.
Nothing else was left to this unhappy man to live for. He felt
that he had lived long enough; and too long to die happily; yet so
that almost any death would be a blessing to him, if it did not leave
behind a curse upon his children.
The thought of these lay on his mind so heavily, that often now
he could not put things one against another, as he used to do. If
his mind had only been quite rid of heart and conscience, nothing
would have been allowed to get the better of him.
Still his troubled heart could not prevent his rapid mind from
working in its own way now and then; so that he knew, quite as well
as those now in pursuit of him, who they were, and what they
wanted, and how much they had to find.
Three foes now were closing round him ; all of whom, by different
process, and from different premises, had arrived at the one con-
clusion. These three, acting, happily for him, without any concert,
were Dr. Hutton, Issachar Jupp, and Mr. Chope of Southampton.

365
Of the first he held undue contempt (not knowing all his evidence);
the second he had for the time disarmed, by an appeal ad hominem;
the third was the most to be dreaded, because so crafty, keen, and
Jeep, and hard to have to deal with.
Mr. Chope, the partner and “brains” of Cole (the coroner), was
absent upon a lawyer's holiday, at the time of the inquest on Clayton
Nowell. When he came home, and heard all about it, and saw the
place, and put questions, at first he knew not what to think. Only
upon one point he was certain—the verdict had been wrong. Either
Cradock Nowell had shot his brother purposely, or someone else had
done so. To Chopes clear intuition, and thorough knowledge of fire-
arms—for his one relaxation was shooting—it was plain as possible
that there had been no accident. To the people who told him
about the cartridge “balling,” he expressed no opinion. But to
himself he said, “ Pooh! I have seen Cradock Nowell shoot. He
always knew all he was doing. He never would put a green car-
tridge into his gun for a woodcock. And the others very seldom
ball. And even if he had a green cartridge, look at the chances
against it. I would lay my life that Clayton Nowell either shot
himself, or else was shot on purpose.”
Then, of course, Mr. Chope set to, not only with hope of reward,
but to gratify his own instinct, at the puzzle and wards of the ques-
tion. If he had known the neighbourhood well, and all the local
politics, and had not been interrupted, he must have arrived at due
conclusion long before he did. But a heavy piece of conveyancing
came into the office of Cole, Chope, and Co., and, being far more
lucrative than amateur detectiveness, engrossed for the time all
attention.
But now that stubborn piece was done with, and Mr. Chope
again at leisure to pursue his quest. Twice or thrice every week
he was seen, walking in his deliberate way (never straightening his
knees, but setting his feet down at a dead level, as if every step
were paid for), going thus through the village of Nowelhurst, and
into the haunts of the woodmen. He carried his great head down-
wards, as a bloodhound on the track does, but raised it, and met
with a soft sweet smile all who cared to look at him. In his hand
he bore a fishing-rod, and round his hat some trout-flies; and often
he entered the village inn, and had bread and cheese in the tap-
room, though invited into the parlour.
Although his boots were soaked and soiled, as if he had been
wading, and the landing-net, slung across his back, had evidently
been dripping, he opened to none his fishing-creel, neither had any
trout fried, but spoke in a desponding manner of the shyness of the
fish, and the brightness of the water, and vowed every time that his
patience was now at last exhausted. As none could fish in that
neighbourhood without asking Sir Cradock's permission, or tres-
passing against him, and as the old baronet was most duly tenacious

race
of all his sporting rights, every body wondered what Mark Stoto
was about to allow a mere far-comer to carry on so in Nowelhurst
water. But Mark Stote knew a great deal better what was up than
they did.
Four or five times now, Bull Garnet, riding on his rounds of
business, had met Simon Chope, and bowed politely to him. On
the first occasion, Mr. Chope, knowing very little of Garnet, and
failing to comprehend him, lost his slow sequacious art, because he
carried his nose too low. All very cunning men do this; even my
Lord Bacon, but never our brother Shakspeare.
But Mr. Garnet read him truly, and his purposes also, by the aid
of his own consciousness; and a thrill of deep, cold fear went
through that hot and stormy heart. Nevertheless, he met the case
in his usual manner, and puzzled Mr. Chope on the third or fourth
encounter by inviting him to dinner.
The lawyer found soine ready plea for declining this invitation ;
sleuth and cold-blooded as he was, he could not accept hospitality
to sift his host for murder. Of course Mr. Garnet had foreseen the
refusal of this overture ; but it added to his vague alarm, even
more than it relieved him from a momentary trial. Clearly
enough he knew, or felt, that now he was running a
against time; and if he could only win that race, and give the
prize to his children, how happily would he yield himself to his
only comfort-death. With his strong religious views-right or
wrong, who shall dare to say? for the matter is not of reason-
he doubted God's great mercy to him in another world no more
than he doubted his own great love to those he should leave
behind in this one.
Sad it was, and enough to move the tears of any Stoic, to behold
Bull Garnet now sitting with his children. Instead of being shy
and distant (as for a while he had been, when the crime was new
upon him) he would watch them, word by word, smile by smile, or
tear for tear, as if he never could have enough of the little that was
left to him. They, on the other hand, were beginning to talk
before him comfortably, cheerfully, and at random, as the manner
of the young is. Bob had found that the vague, dark cloud, of
whose origin he knew nothing, was lifted a little, and lightened ; and
Pearl, who knew all about it, was trying to slip from beneath its
shadow, with the self-preservation of youth, and into the long-
obscured but never quenched delight of youth and beauty in their
own luxuriance.
And all the while their father, the man of force and violence,
would look from one to the other of them, perceiving, with a curious
smile, little traits of himself; often amused at, and blessing them
for, their very sage inexperience; thinking to show how both were
wrong, yet longing not to do it. And then he would begin to wonder
which of them he loved more deeply. Pearl had gained upon him

367
so, by the patience of her wrong, by coming to the hearth for shelter
from the storms of alien love.
In all races against time, luck (itself the child of time), is apt to
govern the result more than highest skill may. So far, all of the
luck had been in Mr. Garnet's favour ; the approach of unlucky
Cradock in the dusk, and with senses so distracted, the hurried and
jostled aim acknowledged and insisted upon by the youth himself ;
the arrival of Mr. Rosedew; the blundering and timid coroner and
the soft-hearted jury; even the state of the weather; and since
that time the perversion and weakness of the father's mind : all
these had prevented that close inquiry which must have ended in
Bull Garnet's conviction or confession. For, fall foul or fall fair
his children, he was man enough to confess at once, ere ever an in-
nocent man should be in danger for his blood-guiltiness.
Only in one important matter-so far at least as he knew yet, not
having heard of Jem's discovery, and Mr. Hutton's advance upon
it-had fortune been against him ; that one was the crashing of his
locked cupboard, and the exposure of the broken gun-case to Rufus
Hutton's eyes. And now it was an adverse fate which brought Mr.
Chope upon the stage; and yet it was a kindly one which kept him
apart from Hutton. For Simon Chope and Rufus Hutton could
not bear one another, according to the old repulsion between cold
blood and hot blood.
As it happened, Mr. Chope was Mrs. Corklemore's pet lawyer :
he had been employed to see that she was not defrauded of any
possible rights uxorial upon her second marriage. And uncommonly
good care he took to secure the lion's share for her. Indeed, had
it been possible for him to fall in love at all with any thing but
money, that foolish lapse would have been his, at the very first sight
of Georgie. Sweetly innocent and good, she did so sympathize
with “to wit, whereas, and notwithstanding ;" she entered with such
gush of heart into the bitter necessity of making many folios, and
charging for every one of them, which the depravity of human
nature has forced on a class whose native bias rather tends to
poetry; she felt so acutely (when all was made plain to her, and
Mr. Corklemore paid the bill) how very very wrong it was not to
have implicit confidence-“ in being cheated,” under her breath, and
that shaft was Cupid's to Mr. Chope-in a word, he was so smitten,
that he doubled all his charges, and inserted an unusual power of
appointment, because Nowell Corklemore had the gout, and Chope
might come in for remainder.
“ Hang it,” he said, for his extreme idea of final punishment was
legal ; "hang it, I married that woman, our son would be Lord
Chancellor. I never did see such a liar."
Now it was almost certain that, under Sir Cradock Nowell's
settlement upon marriage, an entail had been created. The lawyers,
who do as they like in such matters, and live in a cloud of their own

breath, are sure to provide for continuance, and the bills of their own
grandchildren.
Alas, how sad !” thought Georgie, as she lay back in the
Nowelhurst carriage on her way to Cole, Chope, and Co.; "how
very sad if it should be so. Then there will be no cure for it, but
to get up the evidence, meet the dreadful publicity, and get the poor
fellow convicted. And they say he is so good-looking! Perhaps I
hate ugly people so much, because I am so pretty. Oh, how I wish
Mr. Corkiemore walked a little more like a gentleman. But as
a sacred duty to my innocent darling, I must leave no stone
unturned.”
Fully convinced of her pure integrity, Georgie drove up in state
and style to the office of Cole, Chope, and Co., somewhere in
Southampton. She would make no secret of it, but go in Sir Cradock
Nowell's carriage, and then evil-minded persons could not mis-
interpret her. Mr. Chope alone could tell her, as she had said to
Uncle Cradock” (with a faint hope that he might make some slip),
what really was the nature and effect of her own marriage-settle-
ment. Things of that sort were so far beyond her, so distasteful
to her; sufficient for the day was the evil thereof; she could
sympathize with almost any one, but really not with a person who
looked forward to any disposal of property, unless it became, for
the sake of the little ones, a matter of strict duty; and even then
it must cause a heart-pang--oh, such a bitter heart-pang !
“ Cole's brains” was not the man to make himself too common.
He always required digging out, like a fossil, from three or four
mural septa. Being disinterred at last from the innermost room,
after winks, and nods, and quiet knocks innumerable, he came out
with both hands over his eyes, because the light was too much for
him, he had been so hard at work.
And the first thing he always expressed was surprise, even though
he had made the appointment. Mr. Simon Chope, attorney and
solicitor, was now about five-and-thirty years old, a square-built man,
just growing stout, with an enormous head, and a frizzle of hair which
made it look still larger. There was a depth of gravity in his paper-
white countenance-slightly marked with small-pox--a power of not
laughing, such as we seldom see, except in a man of great humour,
who says odd things, but rarely smiles till every one else is laughing.
But if Chope were gifted, as he may have been, with a racy vein of
comedy, nobody ever knew it. He was not accustomed to make a
joke gratis, neither to laugh upon similar terms at the jokes of other
people. Tremendous gravity, quiet movements, very clear percep-
tion, most judicious reserve these had been his characteristics
since he started in life with the office-broom; and these would abide
with him until he got every thing he wanted ; if any man ever was
known to do that.
With many a bow and smile, expressing surprise, delight, and

deference, Mr. Chope conducted to a special room that lady in whom
he felt ai interest transcending contingent remainder. Mrs. Corkle-
more swam to her place with that ease of movement which was
one of her chief fascinations, and fixed her large grey eyes on the
lawyer with the sweetest expression of innocence.
"I fear, Mr. Chope-oh, where is my husband ? he promised to
meet me here—I fear that I must give you, oh, so much trouble
again. But you exerted yourself so very kindly on my behalf about
eighteen months ago, that I cannot bear to consult any other gentle-
man, even in the smallest matter.'
“My services, such as they are, shall ever be at the entire
disposal of Madame la Comtesse."
Mr. Chope would always address her so ; "a countess once, a
countess for ever," was his view of the subject. Moreover, it ignored
Mr. Corklemore, whom he hated as his supplanter; and, best reasor.
of all, the lady evidently liked it.
“You are so very kind, I felt sure that you would say so. But
in this case, the business is rather Mr. Corklemore's than my own.
But he has left it entirely to me, having greater confidence, perhaps,
in my apprehension.”
She knew, of course, that so to disparage her husband, by impli-
cation, was not in the very best taste; but she felt that Mr. Chope
would be pleased, as she quite understood his sentiments.
And not without excellent reason," answered the lawyer softly ;
"if any lady would be an ornament to our profession, it is Madame
la Comtesse."
“Oh no, Mr. Chope, oh no! I am so sadly and shamefully
simple. And I never should have the heart to do the things you
are compelled to do. But to return : this little matter, in which we
hope for your assistance, is a trifling exchange of mixed land with
Sir Cradock Nowell.”
“Ah, to be sure !” said Chope, feeling slightly disappointed, foi
he had looked forward to something far more lucrative ; " if you
will give me particulars, it shall have our best attention.”
“I think I have heard,” said Georgie, knowing thoroughly all
about it, “ that there is some mode of proceeding, under some Act
of Parliament, which lightens, perhaps, to some extent, the legal
difficulties-and, oh yes, the expenses."
Mrs. Corklemore knew how Mr. Chope had drawn her a very long
bill—upon his imagination.
“Oh, of course," replied Mr. Chope, smitten yet more deeply
with the legal knowledge, and full of the future Lord Chancellor ;
“there is a rough and ready way of dealing with almost any thing
What they call a statutory proceeding, shockingly careless and
haphazard, and most ungermanely thrust into an Enclosure Act.
But we never permit any clients of ours to imperil their interests so,
for the sake, perhaps, of half a sovereign. There is such a deal

of quackery in all those dabblesome interferences with ancient insti:
tutions. For security, for comfort of mind, for scientific investigation,
there is nothing like the exhaustive beauty of a good common-law
conveyance. Look at a proper abstract of title ! A charming
thing to contemplate ; and still more charming, if possible, the
requisitions upon it, when prepared by eminent counsel. But the
tendency of the present age is to slur and cut short every thing.
Melancholy, most melancholy !"
Especially for the legal gentlemen, I suppose, Mr. Chope?"
“Yes. It does hurt our feelings so to see all the grand safe-
guards, invented by men of consummate ability, swept away like
old rubbish. I even heard of a case last week, where a piece of
land, sold for as much as 400l., actually cost the purchaser only
80l. for conveyance !”
“Oh, how disgraceful !” cried Georgie, so nicely, that Chope
detected no irony: “and now, I presume, if we proceed in the
ordinary way, we must deliver and receive what you call' abstracts
of title.'s
Quite se, quite so, whichever way you proceed. It is a most
indispensable step. It will be my duty and privilege to deduce
Mr. Corklemore's title ; and Mr. Brockwood's, I presume, to show
Sir Cradock Nowell's. All may be completed in twelve months'
time, if both sides act with energy. If you will favour me with the
description of parcels, I will write at once to Mr. Brockwood ; or,
indeed, I shall see him to-night. He will be at the Masons' dinner.”
For a moment Mrs. Corklemore was taken quite aback. It is
needless to say that no interchange of land had ever been dreamed
of, except by herself, as a possible method of learning “how the
land lay ;” and indeed there was no intermixed land at all, as Mr.
Chope strongly suspected. Neither was he, for the matter of that,
likely to meet Mr. Brockwood ; but when it becomes a professional
question, a man can mostly out-lie a woman, even as experience
outgoes imagination.
“Be guided by me, if you please,” said Georgie, smiling enough
to misguide any man; we must not be premature, lest we seem
too anxious about the bargain. And, I am sure, we have done o ir
very best to be perfectly fair with Sir Cradock. Only, for some of
the tenants' interests, or some little hitch of that kind, nothing is to
be said at present about this friendly transaction. Only, as ine:'e
matter of business, we must ascertain, they tell me, whether he has
reposing, composing-oh, how stupid I am! I mean disposing
power ; that there is no awkward entail in the way."
Here she looked so preternaturally simple, which she would never
have done but for her previous flutter, that Simon Chope in a
moment knew exactly what her game was. Nevertheless, he
answered nicely in that tantalizing way which often makes a woman
flash forth.

371
** We shall, of course, enter into that question as our first preli-
aninary. Of course Sir Cradock would not propose that exchange
unless he had full power. Is it quite certain that poor Clayton
Nowell left no legitimate offspring ?”
Oh, what a horrible suggestion ! Such a thing would quite upset
every scheme. Georgie had never thought of it. And yet it might
even be so. There was something in the tone of Mr. Chope's
whisper, which convinced her that he had heard something.
And only think ; young men are so little looked after at Oxford,
that they can get married quite easily, at Headington or at Abingdon,
as had happened a score of times, without any thing being heard of
it. At least, so thought Mrs. Corklemore. And then oh, if poor
Clayton had left a child, how his grandfather would idolize him !
Sir Cradock would slip from her hands altogether; and scarcely any
hope would remain of diverting the succession. Even if the child
was a daughter, probably she would inherit, and could not yet have
committed felony. Oh, what a fearful blow to think of!
All this passed through that rapid mind in about half a second,
during which time, however, the thinker could not help looking non-
plussed. Mr. Chope of course perceived it, and found himself more
and more wide-awake.
“Well, what a strange idea !” she exclaimed, with surprise, which
for once was natural. * There has not been the slightest suggestion
of any thing of the kind. And indeed I have lately heard what
astonished me very much, that he had formed an-an improper
attachment in a quarter very near home.”
“Indeed! Do you know to whom ?” It was Mr. Chope who was
trying now to appear indifferent.
“Yes. I was told. But it does not become me to repeat such
stories.”
“ It not only becomes you in this case, but it is your absolute
duty, and—and your true interest.”
“Why, you quite frighten me, Mr. Chope. Your manner is so
strange."
“It would grieve me deeply indeed to alarm Madame la
Comtesse," answered the lawyer, trying in vain to resume his
airiness ; " but I cannot do justice to any one who does not fully
confide in me. In a case like this, especially, such interests are
concerned, the title is so-so complicated, that purely as a matter
of business we must be advised about every thing.”
“Well, I see no reason why I should not tell you. It cannot be
of any importance. Poor Clayton Nowell had fallen in love with
a girl very far beneath him—the daughter, I think she was, of a
Mr. Garnet."
Oh, I think I had heard a report of that sort”-he had never
heard, but suspected it—"it can, of course, signify nothing, if the
matter went no further ; nevertheless, I thank you for your gratify-

ing confidence. I apologize if I alarmed you ; there is nothing
alarming at all in it. I was thinking of something very different.
This was utterly false; but it diverted her from the subject.
“Oh, yes, I see. Of something, you mean, which might have
caused a disagreement between the unfortunate brothers. Now tell
me your opinion—in the strictest confidence, of course--as to that
awful occurrence. Do you think-oh, I hope not

know that my partner, Mr. Cole, the coroner, was too sadly con-
vinced,--oh, I beg your pardon, I forgot for the moment that

"Pray forget my relationship, or rather consider it as a reason ;
oh, I would rather know the sad, sad truth. It is the suspense, oh,
the cruel suspense. What was Mr. Cole's conclusion ?”
“ That if Cradock Nowell were put on his trial, he would not find
a jury in England but must convict him."
“Oh, how inexpressibly shocking! I am so sorry to give trouble,
but

I ask for a glass of water? Oh, thank you, thank you. No
wine, if you please. I am so overcome that I must hurry away
quite rudely. The fresh air will revive me. I cannot conclude my
instructions to-dav. How could I think of such little matters?
Please to do nothing and say nothing, until you hear from me.
Yes, I hear the carriage. I told Giles to allow me ten minutes
only, unless Mr. Corklemore came. You see how thoroughly well
I know the value of your time. We feel it so acutely always, that I
must not presume; no further, if you please !”
Having thus appraised Mr. Chope, and apprised him of his dis-
tance, from a social point of view, Georgie gave him a smile which
disarmed hiin, at least for the moment. But he was not the lawyer,
or the man, to concede her the last word.
“We lawyers never presume, madam, any more than we assume.
We must have every thing proved.”
“Except your particulars of account, which you leave to prove
themselves."
“Madame la Comtesse is too clever for the whole profession.
To her we can only prove our own inferiority.”
He stood, with his great bushy head uncovered, looking after the
grand apparatus, and three boys sitting behind it; and then he went
sadly back, and said, “ Our son must have been Lord Chancellor.
But this time, I am really afraid that I out-lied her !"

MAIDENS IN THE SPRING-TIDE.
373
CHAPTER LIV.
MAIDENS IN THE SPRING-TIDE.
Two months of opening spring are past, and the forest is awaking.
Up, all we who love such wakening ; come and see more glorious
doings than of man or angel. However hearts have been winter-
bound with the nip of avarice, and the iron frost of selfishness, how-
ever minds have checked their sap in narrowness of prejudice, let
us all burst bands awhile before the bright sun, as the leaves are
doing. Heaven's young breath is stirring through crinkled bud and
mossy crevice, harmless lance of reed, and peaceful sabretash of
willow, “ bloody warriors," whose breath proclaims them gilly-
flowers, and flags that wave, but not for battle.
Lo, where the wind goes, while we look, playing with and laugh-
ing at us, chasing the turn of a primrose-bank, and touching sweet
lips with dalliance. Lifting first the shining tutsan, gently so, and
apologizing, then after just one tender whisper to the nodding milk-
wort, away to where the light blue eyes of the periwinkle hesitate.
Last, before he dies away, the sauntering ruffler looks and steps into
a quiet tufted nook, overhung with bank, and linteled with the
twisted oak-roots. Here, as in a niche of Sabbath, dwells the
nervous shy wood-sorrel, feeding upon leaf-mould, quivering with
its long-stalked cloves, pale of hue, and shunning touch, delicate
wood-sorrel, coral-rooted, shamrock-leafed, loved and understood of
few, except good Fra Angelico.
Tut—we want stronger life than that; and here we have it over-
head, with many a galling boss and buff, yet, on the whole, worth
tree's exertion, and worth man's inspection. See the oak-leaves
bursting out, crimped and crannied at their birth, with little nicks
and serrate jags (like “painted lady” chrysalids, or cowries pushing
their tongues out) throwing off the liidesome tuck, and frilled with
pellucid copper. See, as well, the Auted beech-leaves, started a full
moon ago, offering out of fawn-skin gloves, and glossed with water-
proof copal. Then the ash-but hold, I know not how the ash
comes out, because it gives so little warning; or rather, it warns a
long, long time, and then does it all of a sudden so. Tush-what man
cares now to glance at the yearly manuscript of God ? Let the
leaves go; they are not inscripti nomina regum.
Yet the brook-though time flees faster, who can grudge one
glance at brooklet ? Where the mock-myrtle begins to dip, where
the
young agrimony comes up, and the early forget-me-not pushes
its claim upon our remembrance, and the water-lily floats half-way
up, quivering dusk in the clearness, like a trout upon the hover.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Look how the little waves dance towards us, glancing and casting
over, drawing a tongue with limpid creases from the broad pool
above, then funnelling into a narrow neck over a shelf of gravel, and
bubbling and babbling with petulant freaks into corners of calmer
reflection. There an old tree leans solemnly over, with brows bent,
and arms folded, turning the course of the brook with his feet, and
shedding crystal darkness.
Below this, the yellow banks break away into a scoop on either
side, where a green lane of the forest comes down and wades into the
water. Here is a favourite crossing-place for the cattle of the wood.
and, and a favourite bower for cows to rest in, and chew the cud of
soft contemplation. And here is a grey wooden bridge for the foot-
path, adding to rather than destroying the solitude of the scene,
because it is plain that a pair of feet once in a week would astonish
it. Yet in the depth of loneliness, and the quiet repose of shadow,
all is hope, and reassurance, sense of thanks, and breath of praise.
For is not the winter gone by, and forgotten, the fury and darkness
and terror, the inclination of March to rave, and the April too given
to weeping ? Surely the time of sweet flowers is come, and the glory
of summer approaching, the freedom of revelling in the sun, the
apparelling of the magnificent trees, and the singing of birds
among them.
Through the great Huntley Wood, and along the banks of the
Millaford brook, this fine morning of the May, wander our Rosalind
and Celia, Amy to wit, and Eöa. It is a long way from Nowelhurst,
but they have brought their luncheon, and mean to make a day of
it in the forest, seeking balm for wounded hearts in good green leaf
and buoyant air. Coming to the old plank-bridge, they sit upon a
bank to watch the rising of the trout, for the stone-fly is on the
water. Eöa has a great idea that she could catch a trout with a
kidney-bean stick and a fly ; but now she has not the heart for it;
and Amy says it would be so cruel, and they are so pretty.
“What a lovely place !” cries Amy; “I could sit here all day
long. How that crab-apple, clothed with scarlet, seems to rouge
the water !”
“It isn't scarlet, I tell you, Amy, any more than you are. It's
only a deep, deep pink. You never can tell colours."
“Well, never mind. It is very pretty. And so are you, when
you are good and not contradictory—'contradictionary, as James
Pottles calls Coræbus."
“Well, it does just as well. What's the good of being so par-
ticular? I am sure I am none the better for it; and I have not
jumped the brook ever so long, and have thrown away my gaiters
just because Uncle John said-oh, you are all alike in England.”
“What did my father say, if you please, that possessed such
odious sameness ?”
“There, there, I am so glad to see you in a passion, dear;

because I thought you never could be. Uncle John only said that
no doubt somebody would like me better, if I gave up all that, and
stayed in-doors all day. And I have been trying hard to do it;
but he is worse than he was before. I sat on a bench in the chase
last Monday, and he went by and never noticed me, though I made
quite a noise with my hat on the wood, until I was nearly ashamed
of myself. But I need not have been alarmed, for my lord went by
without even looking.”
“And what do you mean to do about it?” Amy took the
deepest interest in Eöa's love-affair.
“Oh, you need not smile, Amy. It is all very well for you, I
dare say; but it makes me dreadfully angry, Just as if I were
nobody! And after I have told Uncle Cradock of my intentions to
settle."
"You premature little creature ! But my father was quite right
in his advice, as he always is; and not for that reason only. You
belong to a well-known family, and, for their sake as well as your
own, you are bound to be very nice, dear, and to do only what is
nice, instead of making a tomboy of yourself.”
Tomboy, indeed! And nice! Nice things they did, didn't
they-shooting one another?”
Almost before she had uttered the words, she was thoroughly
ashamed of herself, for she knew about Amy and Cradock from the
maiden's own confession. Amy arose without reply, and, taking
her little basket, turned into the homeward path, with a little quiet
sigh. Eöa thought for a moment, and then, having conquered her-
self, darted after the outraged friend.
“I wish to have no more to do with you. That is all,” cried
Amy, with Eöa's strong arms round her waist.
But, indeed, you shall. You know what a brute I am. I can't
help it; but I will try. I will bite my tongue off to be forgiven.”.
“I simply wish, Miss Nowell, to have nothing more to do with
you.”
“ Then you are a great deal worse than I am; because you are
unforgiving. I thought you were so wonderfully good; and now I
am sorry for you, even more than for myself. I had better go back
to the devil's people, if this is the way of Christians.”
“ Could you forgive any one in a moment who had wounded you
most savagely?"
" In a moment--if they were sorry, and asked me.”
Are
you quite sure of that?"
Sure, indeed! How could I help it?”
“ Then, Eöa, you cannot help being more like a Christian than I
I am very persistent, and steadily bitter to any one who
wrongs me. You are far better than I am, Eöa ; because you
cannot hate any one."
“I don't know about being better, Amy; I only know that I
am.

I
don't hate any one—with all my heart I mean–except Mrs Nowell
Corklemore."
Here Amy could not help laughing at Eöa's method of proving
ber rule; and the other took advantage of it to make her sit down,
and kiss her, and beg her pardon a dozen times, because she was
such a little savage ; and then to open her own lunch-basket, and
spread a white cloth, and cover it with slices of rusk and reindeer's
tongue, and hearted lettuce, and lemonade, and a wing of cold duck
at the corner.
“I left it to Hoggy," she cried in triumph ; "and he has deserved
my confidence. Beat that if you can now, my darling."
“Oh, I can beat that out and out,” said Amy, who still was
crying, just a drop now and then, because her emotions were
per-
sistent:" then she smiled, because she knew so well no old butler
could touch her in catering ; but we must not tell what Amy had, for
fear of making people hungry. Only in justice it should be said
that neither basket went home full ; for both the young ladies were
“hearty ;" and they kissed one another in spite of the stuffing.
Oh, Amy, I do love you so, whenever you don't scold me.
am sure I was meant for a Christian. ere's that nasty sneak's
lawn handkerchief. I picked her pocket this morning. I do twice
a week for practice. But I won't wipe your pretty eyes with it,
darling, because I do so loathe her. Now, if you please, no more
crying, Amy. What a queer thing you are !”
"Most truly may I return the compliment,” answered Amy,
smiling through the sparkle of her tears. “But you don't mean to
say that you keep what you steal ?"
“Oh no; it is not worth it. And I hate her too much to keep
any thing.
Last week I lit the fire in my dressing-room, on purpose
to burn her purse. You should have seen the money melting. I
took good care, of course, not to leave it in the ashes, though. I
am forming quite a collection of it; for I don't mind keeping it at
all, when it has been through the fire. And you can't think how
pretty it is, all strings and dots of white and yellow.”
“Well ! I never heard such a thing. Why, you might be trans-
ported, Eöa!”
“Yes, I know, if they found me out; but they are much too
stupid for that. Besides, it is such fun; the only fun I have now,
since I left off jumping. You know the old thing is so stingy."
“Old thing, indeed! Why, she is not five-and-twenty!"
“I don't care ; she has got a child. She is as old as Methusalem
in her heart, though she is so deucedly sentimental”—the old
Colonel's daughter had not forgotten all her beloved papa's expres-
sions—“I know I shall use what you call in this country' physical
force,' some day, with her. I must have done it long ago, only for
picking her pocket. She would be but a baby in my hands, and
she is quite aware of it. Look at my arm ; it's no larger than

yours, except above the elbow, and it is nearly as soft and delicate.
Yet I could take you with one hand, Amy, and put you into the
brook. If you like, I'll do it.”
“Much obliged, dear; but I am quite content without the crucial
test. I know your wonderful strength, which none would ever
suspect, to look at you. I suppose it came to you from your
mother."
“Yes, I believe. At any rate, I have heard my father say so;
and I could hold both his hands most easily. But oh, she is such
a screw, Amy, that sympathetic Georgie! She never gives any one
sixpence; and it is so pleasant to hear her go on about her money,
and handkerchiefs, and, most of all, her gloves. She is so proud of
her nasty little velvet paws. She won't get her gloves except in
Southampton, and three toll-gates to pay, and I steal them as fast
as she gets them. She grumbles about it all dinner-time, and I
offered her eighteenpence for turnpikes-out of her own purse, of
course—because she was so poor, I said. But she flew into such a
rage that I was forced to pick her pocket again at breakfast-time
next morning. And the lies she told about the amount of money in
her purse! Between eight and nine pounds, she said the last time,
and there was only ten rupees. Uncle Cradock made it good to
her, because he guessed that I had done it, though he was afraid to
tell me so. But, thank God, I stole it again the next day when she
went out walking; and that of course he had nothing to say to,
because it did not occur in his house. Oh, what a rage she was in!
She begins to suspect me now, I think; but she never can catch
me out."
“You consummate little thief! why, I shall be afraid to come
near you."
Oh, I would never do it to any one but her. And I should not
do it to her so much, only she thinks me a clumsy stupid. Me who
was called 'Never-spot-the-dust!' But I have got another thing of
hers, and she had better take care, or I'll open it.”
Something else! Take care, Eöa, or I must really go and
tell.”
“No, you know better than that. It is nothing but a letter she
wrote, and was going to post at Burley. I knew, by her wonderful
sympathies that day, that she was at something nasty ; and she
would not let it go in the post-bag. So I resolved to have it; and
of course I did. And she has been in such a fright ever since; but
I have not opened it yet.”
And I hope you never will. Either confess, or post it at once,
or I shall be obliged to ask my father what I ought to do.”
“Oh, you need not be hot, Amy; you don't know any thing at
all about it. I know that she is doing all sorts of things; and I
need not have any scruples with her, after what I caught her doing.
Twice she has been at my desk, my own new desk Uncle Cradock

gave me, where I put all the letters and relics that were found on
my dear, dear father.” Here Eöa burst out crying, and Amy came
near again and kissed her.
Darling, I did not mean to be cross; if the wretch would do
such a thing as that, it justifies almost any thing."
“ And what do you think I did ?” said Eöa, half crying, and half
laughing : “ I set a fishhook with a spring to it, so that the moment
she lifted the cover, the barb would go into her hand ; and the next
day she had a bad finger, and said that little Flore bit it by acci.
dent while she was feeling her tooth, which is loose. I should like
to have seen her getting the barb out of her nasty little velvet
paw.”
“I am quite surprised,” cried Amy; "and we all call you so
simple--a mere child of nature ! If so, nature is up to much
more than we give her credit for. And pray, what is your next
device?"
“Oh, nothing at all, till she does something. I am quits with
her now; and I cannot scheme as she does."
Suddenly Amy put both her hands on Eöa's graceful shoulders,
and poured the quick vigour of English eyes into the fathomless
lustre of darkly-fringed Oriental orbs.
“ You will not tell me a story, dear, if I ask you very parti-
cularly?”
“I never tell stories to any one ; you might know that by this
time. At any rate, not to my friends."
“No, I don't think you would. Now, do you think that Mrs."
Corklemore is at the bottom of this vile thing ?”
“What vile thing ? The viler it is, the more likely she is to have
done it."
“Oh no, she cannot have done it, though she may have had
something to do with it. I mean, of course, about poor
Cradock.”
“What about Cradock? I love Cousin Cradock, although I
have never seen him, because he is so unlucky; and because you
like him, dear, so much.”
“Don't you know it? You must have seen what wretched spirits
I was in. And this made me feel it so much the more, when you
said what you did just now. We have heard that an application
has been made in London, at the Home Office, or somewhere, that
a warrant should be issued against Cradock Nowell, and a reward
be offered for him as -Oh, my Cradock, my Craddy!”
“Put your head in here, darling. What a brute you must have
thought me! Oh, I do so love you. Don't think twice about it,
dear. I will take care that it all comes right. I will go to London
to-day, dearest, and defy them to dare to do it. And I'll open that
letter at once. It becomes a duty now; as that nasty beast always
says, when she wants to do any thing wrong."
“No, no !” sobbed Amy, “ you have no right to open her letter,

and you shall not do it, Eöa, unless my father says that it is
right. Will you promise me that, dear? Oh, do promise me that.”
“How can I promise that, when I would not have him know, for
a lac of rupees, that I had ever stolen it? He would never perceive
how right it was: and, though I don't know much about people, I
im sure he would never forgive me. He is such a fidget. But I
will promise you one thing, Amy-never to open it till you tell me.”
Amy was obliged at last to be contented with this; though she
said it was worse than nothing, for it forced the decision upon her ;
and scrupulously honest and candid as she was, she would feel it
right to settle the point against her own desires.
“Old Biddy knows I have got it,” cried Eöa, changing her
humour : “and she patted me on the back, and said, Begorra,
thin, you be the cliver one ; hould on to that same, me darlint, and
we'll bate every bit of her, yit; the purtiest feet and ankles to you,
and the best back legs, more than iver she got, and now you baté
her in the stalin'. And plase, Miss, rade yer ould Biddy every con-
sumin' word on it. Mullygaslooce, but we've toorned her, this time,
and thank Donats for it."
Eöa mocked Biddy so cleverly, even to the form of her counte-
nance, and her peculiar manner of standing, that Amy, with all those
griefs upon her, could not help laughing heartily.
Come along, I can't mope any longer ; when I have jumped
the brook nine times, you may say something to me.
What do you
think of a bathe, Amy? I am up for it, if you are—and our table-
cloths for towels. Nobody comes here once in a year ; and if they
did, they would run away again. What a lovely deep pool! I can
swim like a duck; and you like a stone, I suppose.”
Amy, of course, would not hear of it, and her lively friend, having
paddled with her naked feet in the water, and found it colder-oh,
ever so much-than the tributaries of the Ganges, was not so very
sorry (self-willed though being) to keep upon the dry land ; only she
had made up her mind to be off at once for the Queen's Mead, and
Amy must come with her, and run every yard of the way, to get
away from trouble.
Amy was light enough of foot, when her heart was light; but Eöa
coulds
run round her," as the sporting phrase is, and she gave her-
self the rein at will that lovely afternoon; as a high-mettled filly
does, when she gets out of Piccadilly. And she chatted as fast as
she walked all the time, hoping so to divert her friend from this new
distress.
“I should not be so very much surprised, if we saw that-Bob,
here somewhere. We are getting near one of his favourite places-
not that I know any thing about it; and he is always away now in
Mark Ash Wood, or Puckpits, looking out for the arrival of honey-
buzzards, or for a merlin's nest. Oh, of course we shall not see
him."

siness;
6 Oh
Now, you know you will,” replied Amy, laughing at Eöa's clum.
and
you have brought me all this way for that very reason.
Now, if we meet him, just leave him to me, and stay out of hearing.
I will manage him so that he shall soon think you the best and the
prettiest girl in the world.”
"Well, I wish he would," said Eöa, blushing beautifully;
“ wouldn't I torment him then ?”
“No doubt you would, and yourself as well. Now where do you
think he will be ?”
“ Oh, Amy, how can I possibly guess ? But if I did guess at a.?,
I should say there was just an atom of a chance of his being not
far from the Queen's Mead.”
“Suppose him to be there. What would bring him there? Not
to see you, I should hope?"
“As if he would go a yard for that! Oh no, he is come to look
for—at least, perhaps he might, just possibly, I mean-
“ Come to look for whom?” Amy was very angry, for she thought
that it was herself, under Eöa's strategy.
A horrid little white mole."
A white mole! Why, I had no idea that there was such a
thing.”
yes, there is : but it is very rare ; and he has set his heart
upon catching this one.”
“ That he shan't. Oh, I see exactly what to do. Come quickly,
for fear he should catch it before we get there. Oh, I do hate
such cruelty. Ah, there, I see him! Now, you keep out of
sight.”
In a sunny break of tufted sward, embayed among long waves
of wood, young Bob Garnet sat, more happy than the king of all the
world of fairies. At his side lay several implements of his own
devising, and on his lap a favourite book with his open watch upon
it. From time to time he glanced away at a chain of little hillocks
about twenty yards in front of him, and among which he had stuck
seven or eight stout hazel rods, and brought them down as benders.
He was trying not only to catch his niole, but also to add another to
his many observations as to the periods of molar exertion. Whether
nature does enforce upon these clever miners any Three Hour Act,
as the popular opinion is; or whether they are free to work and
rest, at their own sweet will, as seems a world more natural.
Amy walked into the midst of the benders, in her self-willed,
characteristic manner, as if they were nothing at all. She made
believe to see nought of Bob, who, on the other side of the path, was
futtering and blushing, with a mixture of emotions.
“Some very cruel person,” she exclaimed, in loud self-commune,
“probably a savage boy, has been setting mole-traps here, I see.
And papa says the moles do more good than harm, except perhaps
in my flower-beds. Now I'll let them all off very quietly. The boy

will think he has caught a dozen; and then how the moles will
laugh at him. He will think it's a witch, and leave off, very likely,
for all cruel boys are ignorant. My pretty little darlings; so glossy,
and so clever !"
“Oh, please not to do that,” cried Bob, having tried in vain to
contain himself, and now leaping up in agony ; “I have taken so
much trouble, and they are set so beautifully."
What, Master Robert Garnet ! Oh, have you seen my com-
panion, Miss Nowell, about here?”
“Look there, you have spoiled another! And they'll never set so
well again. Oh, you can't know what they are, and the trouble I
have had with them.”
“ Oh yes, Master Garnet, I know what they are ; clumsy and
crucl contrivances to catch my innocent moles.”
“Your moles !” cried Bob, with tremendous wrath rising, as she
coolly destroyed two more traps ; "why are they your moles, I
should like to know? I don't believe you have ever even heard of
them before."
“Suppose I have not ?" answered Amy, screwing up her lips, as
she always did when resolved to have her own way.
“Then how can they be your moles ? Oh, if you haven't spoiled
another !”
Well, the Queen's moles, if you prefer it, Master Garnet. At
any rate, you have no right to catch them.”
“But I only want to catch one, Amy; a white one, oh, such a
beauty! I have heard of him ever since he was born, and had my
eye on him down all the galleries ; and now he must be full-grown,
fór he was born quite early in August.”
“I hope he'll live to be a hundred. And I will thank you,
Master Garnet, to speak to me with proper respect. My name is
Miss Rosedew."
Up went another riser. There was only one left now, and that a
most especial trap, which had cost a whole week's cogitation.
“I declare you are a most dreadful girl. You don't like any thing
I do. And I have thought so much of you.”
“Then, once for all, I beg you never more to do so. I have
often wished to speak with you upon that very subject.”
“What—what subject, Miss Rosedew? I have no idea what you
mean."
That is altogether false. But I will tell you now. I mean the
silly, ungentlemanly, and very childish manner, excusable only in
such a boy, in which I have several times observed you loitering
about in the forest."
Bob knew what she meant right well, although she would
not more plainly express it—his tracking of her footsteps. He
turned as "red as meadow-sorrel, and quivered like a bobbing
float.

"I am-very-very sorry. But I did not mean it. . I mean-I
could not help it.”
“You will be kind enough to help it now, for once and for all.
Otherwise, my father, who has not heard of it yet, shall speak to
yours about it.
Insufferable impudence in a boy just come from
school !”
Amy was obliged to turn away, for fear he should look up again,
and see the laughter in her eyes. For all her wrath was feigned;
inasmuch as to her Bob Garnet was far too silly a butterfly-boy to
arouse her real anger. But of late he had been intrusive; and the
wisest plan was to stop it.
“If I have done any thing wrong, Miss Rosedew, any thing in any
way unbecoming a gentleman-
“Yes, try to be a good boy again,” said Amy, very graciously; at
the same time giving the stroke of grace to his masterpiece of me-
chanism, designed to catch the white mole alive ; “, now take up
your playthings and go, if you please ; for I expect a young lady
here directly; and your little tools for cockchafer-spinning would
barbarize the foreground of our sketch, besides being very ugly.”
“Oh!” cried Bob, with a sudden access of his father's readiness
you spin a fellow worse than any cockchafer, and you do it in
the name of humanity !”
“Then think me no more a divinity," answered Amy; because
she must have the last word; and even Bob, young as he was, knew
better than to paragogize the feminine termination. Utterly dis-
comfited, as a boy is by a woman—and Amy's trouble had advanced
her almost to that proud rank-Bob gathered up his broken traps,
and scuttled cleverly out of sight. She, on the other hand (laughing
all the while at herself for her simple piece of acting, and doubting
whether she had been right in doing even a little thing so much
against her nature), there she sat, with her sketching-block ready,
and hoped that Eöa would have the wit to come and meet her
beloved Bob, while labouring under this vile rebuff.
But Eöa could not do it. She had wit enough, but too much
heart. She had heard every word of Amy's insolence, and was
very indignant at it. Was Bob to be talked to in that way? As if he
knew nothing of science ! As if he had an atom of any sort of cruelty
in him! Was Amy so very ignorant as not to know that all Bob did
was done with the kindest consideration, and for the interest of the
species, though the pins through the backs were unpleasant,
perhaps ? But that was over in a moment, and he always carried
ether; and it was nothing to the Fakirs, or the martyrs of
Christianity.
Therefore Eöa crouched away, behind a tuft of thicket, because
her maidenhood forbade her to come out and comfort him, to take
advantage of his wrong, and tell him how she felt for him.' There-
fore, too, she was rather sharp with Amy throughout the homeward

road; vindicating Bob, and snapping at all proffered softness; the
truth being that she had well known his boyish whim for Amy, and
now was sorry for him about it, and a little hurt with both of
them.
From that true touch of woman's nature she learned more dignity,
more pride, more reservation, and self-respect, than she could have
won from a score of governesses, or six seasons of “society.”

“Not another minute to lose, and the sale again deferred! All
the lots marked, and the handbills out, and the particulars and con-
ditions ready ; and then some paltry pettifogging—and another
fortnight will be required to do 'justice to my interests.' Justice to
my interests ! How they do love round-mouthed rubbish! The
only justice to me is, from a legal point of view, to string me up,
and then quick-lime me; and the only justice to my interests is to
rob my children, because I have robbed them already. Robbed
them of their birth and name, their power to look men in the face,
their chance of being allowed to do what God seems chiefly to want
us for—to marry and have children, who may be worse than we
are ; though, thank Him, mine are not. Robbed them even of their
chance to be met as Christians (though I have increased their right
to it), in this wretched, money-seeking, servile, and contemptuous age.
But who am I to find fault with any, after all my wasted life? A
life which might, in its little way, have told upon the people round
me, and moved, if not improved them. Which might, at least, have,

me,
but never forsake my children !-Bob, what are you at with

already, and the leaves flag directly the sun shines. And I want to

and I can't tell without pulling the plants up, and they can't como
to any good, you know, with all this ambury in them.”
“I know nothing of the sort, Bob. I know nothing at all about
it. Go into the house to your sister. I can't bear the sight of
Bob, without a single word, did as he was told. He knew that
his father loved him; though he could not guess the depth of that
love, being himself so different. And so he never took offence at
his father's odd ways to him, but thought, “Better luck next time ;
the governor has got red spider this morning, and he won't be right
till dinner-time."
Bull Garnet smiled at his son's obedience, with a mighty fount
of pride in him; and then he sighed, because Bob was gone-and
he never could have enough of him, for the little time remaining.
He loved his son with a love surpassing that of woman, or man for
Men would call him a fool for it. But God knows how
He has made us.
Thinking none of this, but fretting over fierce heart-troubles,
which now began to be too many even for his power of life as a
hundred wolves pull down a lion-he turned again through the
espalier-walk, where the apple-trees were in blossom. Pinky shells
spread to the sun, with the little close tuft in the middle'; some
striped, some patched, some pinched with white, some streaky, as
the fruit would be, and glancing every gloss of blush-no two of
them were quite alike, any more than two of us are. Yet the bees
knew every one of them, among the countless multitude, and never
took the wrong one; even as the angels know which of us belongs
to them, and the order of their visiting.
Bull Garnet, casting to and fro, and taking heed of nothing, not
even of the weeds which once could not have lived before his eyes,
began again in a vague loose manner (the weakness of which would
have angered him, if he had been introspective) to drone about the
law's delays, and the folly of institution. He stood at last by his
wicket gate, where the hedge of Irish yew was, and there carried
on his grumbling
Lawyers indeed! And cannot manage a simple thing of that
sort ! Thank God, I know nothing of law.”
“Excuse me, Mr. Garnet. It is possible that you may want to
know something of law, shortly."
By what right, sir, dare you break in upon my privacy like
this?"
Pale as he was, and scorning himself for the way in which his
blood shrunk back, Bull Garnet was far too strong and quick ever
to be dumb-foundered. Chope looked at him, with some admira-
tion breaking through the triumph of his small comprehensive
eyes.
Excuse me, Mr. Garnet. I forgot that a public man like you

must have his private moments, even at his own gate. I am sorry
to see you so hot, my dear sir ; though I have heard that it is your
character. That sort of thing leads to evil results, and many
deplorable consequences. But I did not mean to be rude to you, or
to disturb you so violently."
“You have not disturbed me at all, sir."
“I am truly happy to hear it. All I meant, as to knowledge of
law, was to give you notice that there is some heavy trouble
brewing, and that you, on your principal's behalf, must be prepared
to meet some horrible accusations."
“May I trespass further upon your kindness, to ask what their
nature is ?”
Oh, nothing more than a rash and of course unfounded charge
of murder.”
Mr. Chope pronounced that last awful word in a deeply sepulchral
manner, and rivetted his little eyes into Bull Garnet's great ones.
Mr. Garnet met his gaze as calmly as he would meet the sad clouded
aspect of a dead rabbit, or hare, in a shop where he asked the price
them, and examined their eyes as the test of their freshness.
Chope could not tell what to make of it. The thing was beyond
his experience.
But all this time, Bull Garnet felt that every minute was costing
him a year of his natural life ; even if he got a chance of living
naturally
“How does this concern me? Is it any one on our estates ?”
Yes, and the heir to 'your estates.' Poor young Cradock
Nowell."
Bull Garnet sighed very heavily; then he strode away, and came
back again, with indignation swelling out the volume of his breast,
and filling the deep dark channels of brow, and the turgid veins of
his eyeballs.
Whoever has done this thing is a fool ; or a rogue-which
means the same.”
It may be otherwise. We always hope for the
best. Very likely he is innocent. Perhaps they are shooting at

Perhaps you know best what their motives are.
in canvassing them. You have heard, I suppose, the rumour that
Mr. Nowell has left England ?”
“I know very little about it. I have nothing to do with the
case ; or it might have been managed differently. But I heard
that the civil authorities, being called upon to act, discovered, with-
out much trouble, that he had sailed, under a false name, in a ship
called the Taprobane, bound direct for Ceylon. And that, of course,
told against hiir. heavily."
Ah, he sailed for Ceylon, did he? A land full of venomous rep-
tiles, that crawl round people's houses.”

6. Yes ;
“Yes, Ceylon, where flying foxes are. Not so cunning, perhaps,
as our foxes of the Forest. And yet the fox is a passionate animal.
Violent, hot, and hasty. Were you aware of that fact ?”
“Excuse me ; my time is valuable. I will send for the game-
keeper, if you wish to have light thrown upon that question; or
my son will be only too glad-
“Ah, your son ! Poor fellow !”
These few short words, pronounced in a tone of real feeling, with
no attempt at inquiry, quite overcame Bull Garnet. First extrinsic
proof of that which he had so long foreseen with horror—the de-
gradation of his son. He dropped his eyes, which had borne till
now, and returned, the lawyer's gaze; and the sense of his own peril
failed to keep the shame and sorrow in. Up to this time Mr. Chope
was doubting, and even beginning to reject his shrewd and well-
founded conclusion. Now he saw and knew everything. And
even he was overcome. Passion is infectious ; and lawyers are like
the rest of us. Mr. Chope had loved his mother.
Bull Garnet gave one quick strange glance at the eyes of Simon
Chope, which now were turned away from him, and then he looked
at the ground, and said, -
I have wronged him bitterly.”
Simon Chope drew back from him mechanically, instinctively, as
human skin keeps far from cold iron in the arctic regions. He
could not think, much less could he speak, though his mind had
been prepared for it.
To human nature it is so abhorrent to take the life of another : to
usurp the rights of God. To stand in the presence of one who has
done it, touches our pulse with death. We feel that he might have
done it to us, or that we might have done it to him ; and our love
of ourselves is at once accelerated and staggered. And then we
feel that “life for life," the tit for tat of the hangman, is such low
revenge ; the vendetta imposed by cowardice. Very slowly are we
beginning to enter into our manhood.
Bull Garnet was the first to speak, and now he spoke quite calmly.
“You came with several purposes. One of them was, that I
should break to Sir Cradock Nowell these tidings of new trouble ;
the news of the warrant which you and others have issued against
his poor lost son, I will see to it to-day, and I will try to tell him.
It will be a difficult thing to do. You may not think so. I believe,
Mr. Chope, that as yet you have no children.”
Mr. Chope happened to have two sons, not to be loosely boasted
of, whom he meant to take into the office, pseudonymously, some
day; and he was rather inclined to like these little, but hopeful,
nullius filii. First, because they were his own; secondly, because
they had big heads; thirdly, because they had cheated all their
fellow school-boys in a style which was truly promising. Neverthe-
less, he was in no hurry to be confidential about them. Yet, without

387
his knowing it, or at least with only despising it, this little natter
shaped its mcasure upon his present action.
The lawyer lifted his hat to Bull Garnet in a very peculiar
manner, conveying to the quick apprehension what it would not
have been safe to pronounce-to wit, that Mr. Chope quite under-
stood all that had occurred; that he would not act upon his dis-
covery until he had well considered the ma for, after all, he had
no evidence ; lastly, that he was very sorry for Mr. Garnet's posi-
tion, but would rather not shake hands with him.
The steward watched him walking softly among the glad young
leaves, and down the dell where the sunlight flashed on the merry
leaps of the water. Long after the lawyer was out of sight Bull
Garnet stood there watching, as if the forest glades would show him
the approaching destiny. Strong and firm as his nature was, he
had suffered now such wearing, wearying agonies, that he almost
wished the weak man's wish-to have the mastery taken from him,
to have the issue settled without his own decision.
Poor Cradock sailed in the Taprobane! What an odd name,”
he continued, with that childishness in which sometimes the over-
wrought brain relieves itself; “tap, tap-root, tap-robin! Tush,
what a fool I am! Oh Heaven, that I could only think! My God,
that I could only learn whether iny first duty is to You, or to my
children! Let me go indoors and think.”
In the passage he met his son, and kissed his forehead gently, as
if to atone for the harshness of his words to him only an hour ago.
"Father,” said Bob,“ shall you want me to-day? Or may I be
from homé till dark? I have so many things, most important
things, to see to."
“ Birds' nests, I suppose, and grubs, field-mnice, toads, and tad-
poles. Yes, my son, you are wise. Enjoy them while you can.
And take your sister also for a good run, if you can.
carry your dinner with you : I shall do well enough.”
Oh, it's no use asking Pearl ; she never will come with me.
And I am sure I don't want her. She does much more harm than
good ; she can't kill anything properly, nor even blow an egg. But
I'll ask her, as you wish it, sir; because I know that she won't come."
Mr. Garnet had not the heart to laugh at his children's fine sense
of duty towards him ; but he saw Bob start with all his tackle, in
great hopes and high spirits. The father looked sadly after him,
wondering at his enjoyment, yet loving him the more, perhaps, for
being so unlike himself. And as he gazed he could not help saying
to that poor bad self-
“Sure it is that I shall never see him look at me so again, but
perhaps have to look at him when he will not care to look at me.
Yet he must know, in the end, and she, the poor thing, she must
know how all my soul was on them. Now God in heaven, lead me
aright! Half an hour shall settle it.”

CHAPTER LVI.
IN A LOVELY ISLAND.
MEANWHILE, if any warrant ever has a chance of issuing, let us
see what chance it has of ever being executed. And it may be a
pleasant change to fit to southern latitudes from the troubles,
and the drizzle, and the weeping summer of England.
Poor Cradock, as we saw him last, backed up by the ebony-tree,
and with Wena crouching close to him, knew nothing of his lonely
plight and very sudden abandonment; until the sheets of plashing
rain, and long howls of his little dog, awoke him to great wonder-
ment. Then he arose, and rubbed his eyes, and thought that his
sight was gone, and felt a heavy weight upon him, and a want of
power to grope about, and a vain desire to scream, such as comes in
nightmare. Meanwhile, he felt something pulling at him, always in
the same direction, and he did not like to put his hand down, for he
had some idea that it was the devil.
Suddenly a great flash of lightning, triple thrice repeated, lit up
the whole of the wood, like day; and he saw black Wena tugging
at him, to draw him into good shelter. He saw the shelter also,
ere the gush of light was gone—an enormous and hollow mowana-
tree, a little higher up the hill. Then all was blackest night again,
wherein even Wena was swallowed up.
So, with both hands spread, to fend the blows of hanging branch
or creeper, he committed himself to the little dog's care, and she
took him to the mowana-tree. Then another great flash lit up all
the hollow ; and Wena was frightened and dropped her tail, but
still held on to her master.
Cradock neither knew nor cared what the name of the tree was,
nor whether it possessed, as some trees do, especial attractions for
lightning Any harbour in a storm," was all he thought, if he
thought at all; and he lay down very snugly, and felt for Amy's
present to him, and then, in spite of the crashing thunder and the
roaring wind, snugly he went off to sleep; and at his feet lay
Wena.
In the bright morning the youth arose and shook himself, and
looked round, and felt rather jolly than otherwise. Travellers say
that the baobab, or mowana-tree, is the hardest of all things to kill,
and will grow along the ground, when uprooted, and not allowed tú
grow upright. Frenchmen have proved, to their own satisfaction,
that some baobabs now living grew under the deluge of Noah, and
not improbably had the great ark floating over their heads. Be that
as it may, and though it is a Cadmeian job to cut down the baobab,

can all of us tell the travellers of a thing yet harder to kill—the hope
in the heart of a young and good man. And, the better man he is,
the more of hope's spores are in him ; and the quicker they grow
again, after they have all been stamped upon. A mushroom in the
egg likes well to have the ground beaten overhead with a paviour's
ramrner, and comes up all the bigger for it, and lifts a pave-stone of
two hundredweight. Shall then the pluck of an honest man fail,
while his true conscience stirs in him, though the result be like a
fleeting fungus, supposed to be born in an hour by those who know
nothing about it, and who make it the type of an upstart-shall not
his courage work and spread, although it be underground, as he
grows less and less defiant; and rear, perhaps in the autumn of
life, a genuine crop, and a good one ?
Cradock Nowell found his island not at all a bad one. There
was plenty to eat at any rate, which is half the battle of life. Plenty
to drink is the other half, in the judgment of some philosophers.
But may we not say that plenty to look at should form at least a
third of it? The pride of the eyes, if not exercised on that vanish-
ing point, oneself, is a pride legitimate, and condemned by no apostle.
And here there was noble food for it, and it is a pride which, when
duly fed, slumbers off into humility.
Oh the glory of everything, the promise, and the brightness; the
large leading views of sky and sea, and the crystal avenues onward.
The young man looked at his lovely island, and was well content
with it. It was not more than four miles long, and perhaps three
miles across ; but it was gifted with three grand things-beauty,
health, and nourishment. It might have been ages, for all he saw
then, since man had sworn or forsworn in it; perhaps none since
the voyagers of Necho, whose grand truth was so incredible. There
were no high hills, and no very deep holes; but a pleasant undulating
place, ever full of leaves and breezes. And as for wild beasts, he
had no fear; he knew that they would require more square miles
than he owned. As for snakes, he was not so sure ; and indeed
there were some nasty ones, as we shall see by-and-by.
Then he went to the shore, and looked far away, even after the
Taprobane. The sea was yet heaving heavily, and tumbling back
into itself with a roar, and some fishing eagles were very busy,
stooping along the foam of it; but no ship was to be seen any
where, and far away in the south and south-east the selvage of
black clouds, lopping over the mist of the horizon, showed that still
the typhoon was there, and no one could tell how bad it was.
Cradock found a turtle, at which Wena looked first in mute
wonder, with her eyes taking jumps from their orbits ; and then,
like all females, she found tongue, and ran away, and barked furi.
ously. Presently she came back, sniffing along, and drawing her
nose on the sand, yet determined to stick by her master, even if the

turtle should eat him. But, to her immense satisfaction, the result
was quite the converse : she and her master ate the turtle ;
beginning, ab ovo, that morning.
For, although Crad could not quite eat the eggs raw (by-the-by,
they are not so bad that way), and although he could not quite strike
a light by twirling one stick in the back of another, he had long ago
found reason for, and he rapidly found that excellent goddess in, the
roasting of eggs. And for that, he had to thank Amy. Only see
how thoughtful women are !--yes, a mark of astonishment.
But the astonishment will subside, perhaps, when we come to
know all about it ; for then all the misogynes may declare that the
thought was born of vanity. Be that as it may, we greatly prefer to
think it born of love.
Amy had sent him a photograph of her faithful self, beautifully
done by Mr. Silvy, of Bayswater, and framed in a patent lover's
box, the present writer forgets its name— -something French, of
course—so ingeniously contrived, that when a spring at the back
was pressed, a little wax match would present itself, from a lining of
asbestos, together with a groove to draw it in. Thus by night, as
well as by day, the smile of the loved one might illumine the lonely
heart of the lover.
Now this device stood him in good stead—as doubtless it was
intended to do by the practical mind of the giver-for it served to
light the fire wherewith man roasteth roast, and is satisfied. And a
fire once lit in the hollow heart of that vast mowana-tree (where
twenty men might sit and smoke, when the rainy season came), if
you only supplied some fuel daily, and cleared away the ashes
weekly, there need be no fear of philanthropy making a trespasser
of Prometheus. · Cradock soon resolved to keep his head-quarters
there, for the tree stood upon a little hill, overlooking land and sea,
for many a league of solitude. And it was not long before he found
that the soft bark of the baobab might easily be cut so as to make a
winding staircase up it ; and the work would be an amusement to
him, as well as a great advantage.
Master and dog having made a most admirable breakfast upon
turtles'
eggs, “roasted very knowingly”-as Homer well expresses
it—with a large pine-apple to follow, started, before the heat of the
day, in search of water, the indispensable. Shaddocks, and limes,
and mangosteens, bananas—with their long leaves quilling-pine-
apples, mawas, and mamoshoes, cocoa-nuts, plantains, mangoes,
palms, and palmyras, custard-apples, and gourds without end, be-
sides fifty other ground fruits, ay, and tree-fruits for that matter,
quite unknown to Cradock-no fear remained of dying from drought;
and yet the first thing to seek was pure water. If Cradock had
thought much about the thing, very likely it would have struck him
that some of the fruits which he saw are proof not so much of human
cultivation, as of human presence, at some time or other.

But he never thought about that; and indeed his mind was too
full for thinking. So he cut himself a most tremendous bludgeon of
camel-thorn, as heavy and almost as hard as iron, and off he went
whistling, with Wena wondering whether the stick would beat
her.
He certainly took things easily ; more so than is quite in accord
with human nature and reason. But the state of his mind was to
blame for it; and the freshness of the island air, after the thunder
and storm of the night.
Even a rejected lover, or a disconsolate husband, gives a jerk to
his knee-joints, and carries his elbows more briskly, when the bright
spring morning shortens his shadow at every step. Cradock,
moreover, felt quite sure that he would not be left too long there
that his friends on board the Taprobane would come aside from theii
track to find him, on their return-voyage from Ceylon; and so no
doubt they would have done, if it had only lain in their power. But
the Taprobane, as we shall see, never made her escape, in spite of
weatherly helm and good seamanship, from the power of that
typhoon. She was lost on the shoals of Benguela Bay, thirty miles
south of Quicombo ; and not man ever reached the shore to tell
the name of the ship. But a Portuguese half-caste, trading there,
found the name on a piece of the taffrail, as well as a boat which was
driven ashore.
After all, we see then that Cradock was wonderfully lucky-at
least, if it be luck to live-in having been left behind, that evening,
on an uninhabited island. “Desolate" nobody could call it, for the
gifts of life lay around in abundance; and he soon had proof that the
feet of men, ay, of white men, trod it sometimes. Following the
shore, a little further than the sailors had gone, he came on a pure
narrow thread of crystal, a current of bright water dimpling and
twinkling down the sand. Wena at once lay down and rolled, and
wetted every bit of herself; and then began to lap the water wherein
her own very active and industrious friends were drowning. That
Wena was such a ladylike dog ; she washed herself before drinking,
and she never would wash in salt water. It made her hair so unbe-
coming
Cradock followed up that stream, and found quite a tidy little
brook, when he got above the sand-ridge, full of fish, and fringed
with trees, and edged with many a quaint bright bird, scissor-bills
and avosets, demoiselles and flamingoes. Wena plunged in and
went hunting blue rats, and birds, and fishes, while her master
stooped down, and drank, and thanked God for this discovery
A little way up the brook he found a rude shanty, a sort of wig-
wam, thatched with leaves and waterproof, backed by a low rock,
but quite open in front and at both ends. Under the shelter were
blocks of ebony, billets of bar-wood piled up to the roof, some hun-
dred tusks of ivory, bales of dried bark, and piles of rough cylinders

full of caoutchouc, and many other things which Cradock could not
wait to examine. But he felt quite certain that this must be some
trader's depôt for shipping : the only thing that surprised him was
that the goods were left unprotected. For he knew that the West
Africans are the biggest thieves in the world, while he did not un-
derstand the virtue of the hideous great Fetich, hanging there.
It was made of a long dried codfish, with glass eyes, ground in the
iris, and polished again in the pupil, and a glaring stripe of red over
them, and the neck of a bottle fixed as for a tongue, and the body
skewered open and painted bright blue, ribbed with white, like a
skeleton, and the tail prolonged with two spinal columns, which
rattled as it went round. The effect of the whole was greatly in-
creased by the tattered cage of crinoline in which it was suspended,
and which went creaking round, now and then, in the opposite
direction.
No nigger would dare to steal any thing from such a noble idol.
At least so thought the Yankee trader who knew a thing or two
about them. He had left his things here in perfect faith, while he
was travelling towards the Gaboon, to complete his cargo.
Cradock was greatly astounded. He thought that it must be a
white man's work; and soon he became quite certain, for he saw
near a cask the clear mark of a boot, of civilized make, unquestion-
ably. Then he prized out the head of the cask, after a deal of
trouble, and found a store of ship-biscuit, a little the worse for
weevil, but in very fair condition. He gave Wena one, but she
would not touch it, for she set much store by her teeth, and had
eaten a noble breakfast.
Having made a rough examination of the deserted shed, and
found no sort of clothing-which did not vex him much, except that
he wanted shoes—he resolved to continue the circuit of his new
dominions, and look out perhaps for another hut. He might meet
a man at any time ; so he carried his big stick ready, though none
but cannibals could have any good reason to hurt him. As he went
on, and struck inland to cut off the northern promontory, the lie of
thé land and the look of the woods brought to his mind more clearly
and brightly his own beloved New Forest. He saw no quadruped
larger than a beautiful little deer, lighter than a gazelle, and of a
species quite unknown to him. They stood and looked at him
prettily, without either fear or defiance, and Wena wanted to hunt
i them. But he did not allow her to indulge that evil inclination. He
had made up his mind to destroy nothing, even for his own subsist-
ence, except the cold blooded creatures which seem to feel less of
the death-pang. But he saw a foul snake, with a flat heavy head,
which hissed at and frightened the doggie, and he felt sure that it
was venomous : monkeys also of three varieties met him in his pil-
grimage, and seemed disposed to be sociable; while birds of every
tint and plumage fluttered, and flashed, and flitted. Then Wena

393
ran up to him howling, and limping, and begging for help; and he
found her clutched by the seed-vessels of the terrible uncaria. He
could scarcely manage to get them off, for they seemed to be
crawling upon her.
When he had made nearly half his circuit, without any other dis-
covery-except that the grapes were worthless—the heat of the noon-
day sun grew so strong, although it was autumn there—so far as they
have any autumn-that Cradock lay down in the shade of plan-
tain ; and, in a few seconds afterwards, was fast asleep and
dreaming. Wena sat up on guard and snapped at the nasty
poisonous flies, which came to annoy her master.
How heavenly tropical life would be, in a beautiful country like
that, but for those infernal insects! The mosquito, for instance,
and he is an angel, compared to some of those Beelzebubs,-must
have made Adam swear at Eve, even before the fall. And then
those awful spiders, whose hair tickles a man to madness, even if he
survives the horror of seeing such hideous devils. And then the
tampan-but let us drop the subject, lest we should fail to sleep to-
night. Cradock awoke in furious pain, and spasms most unphilo-
sophical. He had dreamed that he was playing football upon
Cowley Green, and had kicked out nobly with his right foot into a
marching line of red ants. Immediately they swarmed upon him,
up him, over him, into him, biting with wild virulence, and twisting
their heads and nippers round in every wound to exasperate it.
Wena was rolling and yelling, for they had attacked her also.
Cradock thought they would kill him ; although he did not know
that even the python has no chance with them. He was as red all
over, inside his clothes and outside, as if you had winnowed over
him a bushel of fine rouge. Dancing, and stamping, and recalling,
with heartfelt satisfaction, some strong words learned at Oxford, he
caught up Wena, and away they went, two solid lumps of ants,
headlong into the sea. Luckily he had not far to go; he lay down
and rolled himself, clothes and all, and rolled poor Wena too in the
waves, until he had the intense delight of knowing that he had
drowned a million of them. Ah ! and just now he had made up his
mind to respect every form of life so.
But surely we may defy any man-even the sage Archbishop of
York, who reads novels to stop other people-to have lectured
Crad under the circumstances, or to have failed to let out an oath,
with those twenty thousand holes in him. The salt water went into
Cradock's holes, and made him feel like a Cayenne pepper-castor ;
and the little dog sat in the froth of the sea, and reasoned within
her blistered mind that even dogs must be allowed a hell.
After that there was nothing to do, except to go home mourn-
fully-if a tree may be called a home, as no doubt it deserves to be
- and then to dry the clothes, and wish that the wearer knew
something of botany. Cradock had no doubt at all that around

CRADOCK NOWELL.
him grew whole stacks of leaves which would salve and soothe his
desperate pain ; but he had not the least idea which were balm and
which were poison. How he wished that, instead of reading so
hard for the scholarship of Dean Ireland, he had kept his eyes
open in the New Forest, and learned just Nature's rudiments ! Of
course he would have other leaves to deal with ; but certain main
laws and principles hold good the whole world over. Bob Garnet
would have been quite at home, though he had never seen one of
those trees before.
There Cradock was, and there he stopped; because he could not
get away. Than which there can be no finer reason for leaving him
to meditate. Enough that he found no other trace of man upon the
island, except the trader's hut, or store, with the hideous scarecrow
hanging, and signs of human labour, in the growth of some few
trees-about which he knew nothing and in a rough piece of
ground near the shanty, cleared for a kitchen-garden. Cassavas,
and yams, and kiobos, and pea-nuts, and some other things, grew
there ; which, as he made nothing of them, we must treat likewise.
There had even been some cotton sown, but the soil seemed not to
suit it. It was meant, perhaps, by keen American, who thought
himself lord of the island, for a little random experiment.
When would he come back ? That was the question Cradock
asked, both of himself and Wena, twenty times a day. Of course
poor Cradock knew not whether his lord of the manor were a
Yankee or a Britisher, a Portuguese or a Dutchman ; “ Thebis
nutritus an Argis.”. Only he supposed and hoped that a white man
came to that island sometimes, and brought other white men with
him.
Now he had cut a winding staircase up the outer walls of his
castle, and added a great many rough devices to his rugged interior.
Twice every day he clomb his tree, to seek all round the horizon ;
and at one time he saw a sail in the distance, making perhaps for
Loanda. But that ship was even outside the expansive margin of
hope. So he divided his time between his grand mowana citadel
and the storehouse, with whose contents he did not like to meddle
much, because they were not his property.
There he placed the ship’s hydropult, which he had found lying
on the beach; for the mate had brought it to meet the chance of
finding shallow water, where the casks could not be stooped or the
water bailed without fouling it; and the boat's crew, in their rush
and flurry, had managed to leave it behind them. Cradock left it
in the storehouse, because it was useless to him in his tree where
he had no water, and it amused him sometimes to syringe Wena
from the brook which flowed hard by. Moreover, he thought that
if any thing happened to prevent him from explaining things, the
owner of the place, whoever he might be, would find in that imple-
ment more than the value of the biscuits which Cradock was eating,

and getting on nicely with them; they seemed to chasten so beau-
tifully the richness of his turtles.
Truly, his diet was glorious, both in quality and variety; and he
very soon became quite a pomarian Apicius. Of all fruits, perhaps
the mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) is the most delicious, when
you get the right sort of it-which is not to be had in Brazil-
neither is the lee chee a gift to be despised, nor the chirimoya, and
several others of the Anona race; some of the Granadillas, too, and
the sweet lime, and the plantains, and many another fount of
beauty and delight—all of which, by skill and care, might be raised
in this country, where we seem to rest content with our meagre
hothouse catalogue.
Not for a moment that all these fruits were native to “ Pomona
Island," as Cradock, appreciating its desserts, took the liberty of
naming it ; but most of them were discoverable in one part or
another of it'; some born froin the breast of nature, others borne
by man or tide. And almost all of them still would be greatly
improved by culture.
So the head-gardener of the island, who left the sun to garden
for him, enjoyed their exquisite coolness, and wondered how they
could be so cool in the torrid sunshine; and though he did not
know the name of one in fifty of them, he found out, without long
inquiry, which of them were the nicest. And soon he discovered
another means of varying his diet ; for he remembered having read
that often, in such lonely waters, the swarming fish will leap on
board of a boat floating down the river. Thereupon he made him-
self a broad flat tray of bark, with a shallow ledge around it, and
holding a tow-rope, made also of bark, launched it upon the brook.
Immediately a vast commotion arose among the finny ones; they
hustled, and huddled, and darted about, and then paddled gravely
and stared at it. Then, whether from confusion of inind, or the
reproaches of their comrades, or the desire of novelty, half a dozen
of them made a rush, and carried the ship by boarding. Where-
upon Cradock, laughing heartily, drew his barge ashore; and soon
Wena and himself were wondering how many bones there can be
in a fish.
All these fresh delights, and all the newness of increasing know-
ledge and enlarging wonder, taken in the balmy air, and with the
brilliant heaven above them, and the graceful trees around, softly
were beginning now, and sweetly were proceeding to find their way
across the borders of incessant sorrow,

CRADOCK NOWELL
CHAPTER LVII.
HOW TO REPEL INVASION.
Now and then Pomona Island had its own anxieties. How much
longer was Cradock Nowell to live upon fruit, and fish, and turtle,
with ship-biscuit for dessert ? When would the trader come for
his goods, or had he quite forgotten them? What would Amy and
Uncle John think, if the Taprobane went home without him ? And
the snakes, the snakes, that cared not a rap for the enmity of man,
since the rainy season set in, but came almost up to be roasted !
And worst of all and most terrible thing, Crad was obliged to go
about barefooted, while the thorns were of nature's invention, and
rasped up every way all at once, like a hedgehog upon a frying-pan.
For that last evil he found a cure before he had hopped many
hundred yards. He discovered a pumpkin about a foot long,
pointed, and with a horny rind, and contracted towards the middle.
He sliced this lengthwise, and took out the seeds, and planted his
naked foot there. The coolness was most delicious, and a few
strips of baobab bark made a first-rate shoe of it. He wore out
one pair every day, and two when he went exploring ; but what did
that matter, unless the supply failed ? and he kept some hung up for
emergency.
As to the snakes, though he did not find out the snake-wood, or
the snake-stone, or the fungoid substance, like a morel, whichi
pumices up the venom; he invented something much better, as
prevention is better than cure. He discovered a species of aspala-
thus, perfectly smooth near the root, and not very hard to pull up,
yet so barbed, and toothed, and fanged upon all except the seed-
leaves, that even a python-whereof he had none—could scarcely
have got through it. Of this he strewed a ring all round his great
mowana-tree, and then a fenced path down the valley toward his
bathing-place, and then he defied the whole of that genus so closely
akin to the clevil.
But Wena had saved his life ere this from one of those slimy
demons. Of course we know how hateful it is to hate any thing at
all, except sin and crime in the abstract ; but surely a man may be
forgiven for hating snakes and scorpions. At any rate, if he cannot
be, he ought to be able to help it.
While Cradock was making his fence aspalathine, and before he
had finished the ring yet, a little snake about two feet long, semi-
transparent, and jellified, of a dirty bottle-green colour, like the
caterpillar known as the pear-leech (Selandria Æthiops), only some
hundreds of sizes bigger, that loathsome reptile sneaked in through,

397
and crouched in a corner, while Cradock thought that he smel.
something very nasty, as he smoked a pipe of the trader's tobacco,
hefore turning into his locker.
He had cut himself a good broad coving from the inside of the
mowana-tree, about three feet from the ground, fitted up with a flap
and a pillow-place, and strewn with fresh plantain-leaves. Across
the niche he had fastened a new mosquito net, borrowed from his
friend the trader, whose goods he began to look upon now as placed
under his trusteeship. And in that rude couch he slept as snugly,
after a hard day's work, as does the pupa of the goat moth, or of
the giant sirex. Under his feet was Wena's hole, wherein she
crouched like a rabbit, and pricked her ears every now and then,
and barked if ever the wind moaned. Fortunatos nimium; there
was nobody to rogue them.
And yet no sooner was Craddy asleep, upon the night we are
come to, than that dirty bottle-green snake, flat-headed, and with a
year's supply of venom in its tooth-bag, came wriggling on its dap-
pled belly around the hollow ring, while the dying embers of the fire
—for the night was rather chilly and wet, and Cradock had cooked
some fish-showed the mean sneak, poking its head up, feeling the
temper of the time, like a radical candidate, ready to wriggle to any
thing. Then it came to the bedposts of Cradock's couch, which he
had cut, in a dry sort of humour, from the soft baobab wood. It
lifted its head, and heard him snoring, and tapped its tail, and
listened again. Very likely it was warm up there, and the snake
was a little chilly, in this depth of the winter. So without any evil
forethought-for justice is due, even to a snake-though ready to
bite, at a move or a turn, the animal known as man,” up went
that little serpent, cleverly and elegantly, as on a Bohemian vase.
Cradock would have died in two hours after that snake had bitten
him. But before that lissom coil of death had got the whole of his
tail off the ground, fangs as keen as his own, though not poisonous,
nipped him by the nape of his neck. Wena knew a snake by this
time, and could treat those sneaks aright. She gave the devilish
miscreant not a chance to twist upon her, but tore him from his
belly-hold, and walked pleasantly to the fire, and with a spit of
execration threw him into it, and ran back, and then ran to again,
and barked at the noise he made in fizzing. Therewith Cradock
awoke, and got out of bed, and saw the past danger, and coaxed
the little dog, and kissed her, and talked to her about Amy, whose
name she knew quite as well as her own.
After all his works were finished, and when he hardly knew what
public improvement next to try, Cradock received visitors, unex-
pected, but most fashionable. In fact, they were all stark naked ;
showing themselves far in front of our period ; which proves its
good taste by reserving that privilege for the ladies.
Climbing his tree, one beautiful morning, he saw four or five

CRADOCK NOWELL.
little marks on the sea, as of so many housemaids' thumbs, when
the cheek of the grate has been polished. Staring thereat with all
his eyes—as we loosely express it-he found that the thumb-marks
got bigger and bigger, until they became long canoes, paddling, like
good ones, towards him.
This was not by any means the sort of thing he had bargained
for ; and he became, to state the matter mildly, somewhat inclined
to be nervous. He saw that there were invading him five great
double canoes, each containing ten or twelve men; and he had no
gun, nor a pinch of powder. Very likely they were cannibals, and
would roast him slowly, to brown him nicely, and then serve up
Wena for garnish. He shook so up there among the rough
branches—for he did not so very much mind being killed, but he
could not bear to be eaten—that Wena began to howl down below,
and he was obliged to come down to quiet her.
Then he tied up black Wena, and muzzled her, to her immense
indignation, with a capistrum of mowana bark, which quite foreclosed
her own, and then he crept warily through the woods, to observe
his black brethren’s proceedings. They were very near the shore
by this time, and making straight for the trader's hut, of which,
perhaps, they had obtained some inkling.
Cradock felt his courage rising, and therewith some indignation,
for he knew that the goods could not be theirs, and by this time he
considered himself in commission as supercargo. So he resolved
to save the store from pillage, if it could any how be done, even at
the risk of his own life.
For this purpose he lay down in a hollow place by the water-side,
where he could just see over the tide-bank without much fear of
discovery, at least till the robbers had passed the shed, which, of
course, was their principal object.
A high-born king of men was he, who stood at the prow of the
foremost canoe, with a javelin in his great black hand, poised, and
ready for casting: His apparel consisted of two great ear-drops,
two rings upon his right wrist, and one below either knee ; also a
chain of teeth was dangling down his brawny bosom. He was
painted red, and polished highly, which had to be done every
morning ; and he looked as dignified and more powerful than a don
or dean. In each of the other canoes, one man was painted and
polished also--to prove to the ignorant outer world that good birth
deserves good blacking.
When the bottom of the double canoe grated upon the beach, the
negro king flung back his strong arm, and cast at the shed his
javelin. It passed through the roof and buried itself in the
body of the fetich, which swung horribly too and fro, while the
crinoline moved round it. Hereupon a yell arose from the invading
flotilla, and every man trembled, waiting to see what would come of
such an impiety.

--
Finding that nothing at all ensued, for Cradock had not the
presence of mind to advance at the moment, they gave another yell
and landed, washing a great deal of red from their legs. But the
king was carried ashore, dry and bright, sitting on some officers'
shoulders. Then they came up the bank, without any order, but
each with his javelin ready, and his eyes intent on the idol. How
Cradock longed for a piece of packthread, to have set the dried
codfish dancing !
At last they came quite up to the shed, and held a consultation,
in which it seemed the better counsel to allow the god, who looked
ever so much more awful now they were near him, a certain time
to vindicate himself, if he possessed the power to do so. Cradock
was watching them closely, through a tussock of long sea-grass,
and, in spite of their powerful frames and elastic carriage, he began
to despise them in the wholesale Britannic manner. They should
not steal his property, that he was quite resolved upon, although
there were fifty of them. They were so near to him now that he could
see their great white teeth, and hear them snapping as they
talked.
When the allotted time, which their Agamemnon was telling upon
his fingers, had quite expired, and Olympian Jove had sent as yet
no lightnings, the king, who was clearly in front of his age, cast
another javelin through the frame of crinoline, and leaped boldly,
like Patroclus, following his dart. Suddenly he fell back, howling
and yelling, cured for ever of scepticism, and with both his great
eyes quite slewed up, and all his virtue in his heels. Away went
every nigger, drowning the royal screams with their own, pell-mell
down the beach, any how, only caring to cut hawser. Words like
these came back to Cradock, as they rolled over one another,--
Mbongo, pongo; warakai, urelwäi ;” which mean, as interpreted
afterwards by the Yankee trader, -
“He is a' God, a great God; he maketh rain, yea, very great
rain !"
Headlong they tumbled into their boats, not stopping to carry
the king even, for which he kicked them heartily, as soon as he
got on board, and every son of a woman of them plied his knotted
arms at the paddle, as if grim Death was behind him.
Cradock laughed so heartily, that he rolled over with the hydropult
on him, and threw his heels up in the air, and if they had not
yelled so, they would have been sure to hear him. Very skilfully
he had brought the nose of that noble engine to bear full upon the
royal countenance, and the jet of water from the little stream passed
through the ribs of the fetich. That god had asserted himself to
such purpose,
that henceforth you might hang him with beads, and
give him a wig of tobacco, and no black man would dare to covet
them.

movement, and began to think more than ever that the whole of
the island was his. These things show, more than any thing else
can, his return to human reason ; for of the rational human being-
as discovered ordinarily—the very first instinct and ambition is
the ownership of a peculium. Whạt man cannot sympathize with
that feeling who has got three fields and six children ?
Therefore when a beautiful schooner, of the true American rig,
which made such lagging neddies of our yachts a few years since, came
into view one afternoon, and fetched up, with the sails all shaking in
the wind, abreast of the shed, ere sun-down, Cradock felt like the
owner of a house who sees a man coming towards his gate. Then
he came down quietly with Wena, and sat upon a barrel, with a
pipe of Cavendish in his mouth, and Wena crouched, like a chrysalis,
between his pumpkin'd feet.
Even the Yankee, who had not been surprised at any incident of
life since his nurse dropped him down an oil-well, when he was
two years old, even he experienced some sensation, when he saw
a white man sitting and smoking upon his barrel of knowingest
notions, with a black dog at his feet. But Recklesome Young was
not the man to be long taken aback.
“Darn me, but yoo are a cool hand. Britisher, for ten dollars.
Never see none like 'em, I don't.”
“ You are right,” answered Cradock, “I am an Englishman. Very
much at your service. What is your business upon my island ?”
Waal,” said the Yankee, turning round to the four men who
had rowed him ashore ; “ Zebedee, this is just what I likes, and
no mistark about it. One of them old islanders come to dispute
possession. And perhaps a cannon up the hill, and a company of
sojers. Ain't it good, Zeb, ain't it? Lor, how I do love them !"
Now, don't be too premature,” said Cradock, “it is the fault of
your nation, as the opposite is ours."
“Darned well said, young Britisher, give us your hand upon it;
for, arter all, I likes yoo."
Cradock shook hands with him heartily, for there was something
in the man's face and manner, when you let his chaff drift by, which
an Englishman recognizes, as kindly, strong, and sincere, although
now and then contemptuous. The contempt alone is not genuine,
but assumed to meet ours or any body's. The active, for fear of the
passive voice.
“You are welcome to all the island,” said Cradock, “and all my
improvements, if you will only take me home again. The whole or
it belongs to me, no doubt; but I will make it all over to you, foi
a passage to Southampton.”
“ Can't take you that way, young Boss, and don't want your legal
writings. How come you here, to begin with ?”
Cradock told him all his story, while the men were busy; and
the keen American saw at once that every word was true.

“Strikes me," he said, with a serious drawl, which the fun in his
eyes contradicted, “that yoo, after the way of the British, have
made a trifle free, young man, with some of my goods and chattels
he-ar; and even your encro-aching country can't prove tittle to
them.”
“Yes," replied Cradock ; "and I will pay you, if I have not done
so already. I will give you the thing which' has saved the whole
from plunder, and perhaps fire afterwards.”
Then he fetched the little machine, which the Yankee recognized
at once as an American invention, and he laughed till his yellow
cheeks were reeking at the description of the “darned naygurs’
retreat.
“Rip me up, young man,” he said, “ but yoo'd be a credit to us
a’most. Darn'd if I thought as any Britisher wud ever be up to so
cute a dodge. Shake hands agin, young chap, I likes yoo. And
you've airned your ticket anywhor, and a hundred dollars to back
of it. We'll take you to the centre of the univarsal world, and
make you open yer eyes a bit. Ship aboard of us for Noo Yerk,
and if that don't make a man of yoo, call me small pumpkins
afterwards."
But I want to get to England,” said Cradock, looking very
blank; "and I have no money for passage from New York to
Southampton.”
“ Thur now, you be all over a Britisher agin, and reck-wirin
enlightment. You allas spies out fifty raisons agin a thin' smarter
than one in it's favior. Harken, now, I'll have yoo sot down in the
docks of Suthanton, free, and with fifty dollars to trade upon,
sure as my name is Recklesome Young. Thur, now! Bet, I don't,
will yoo, and pay me out o' my own spisshy ?”
Not to dwell too long upon these little side-paths, suffice it to say
that Captain Recklesome Young, of New York, and the schooner,
Don't you wish you may catch me, made sail two days afterwards,
with half of his best cabin allotted to Cradock and to Wena. And,
keen as he was to the shave of a hair, in striking a contract or
cutting it; in a question of friendship he scorned all higgling, as a
thing only fit for“ darned niggers.” No English duke or prince of
the blood could or would have behaved to Cradock so grandly as
Recklesome Young did, when once he understood him. In such
things the Yankees are far ahead of us. Keen as they are, and for
that same reason, they have far more trust than we have, in large
and good human nature. Of the best of them, many a true tale has
the present writer heard, such as bring tears to the eyes of a man
accustomed to British suspicion ; and such as one never could hope
to hear of our noblest London merchants. Proofs of grand faith,
and Godlike confidence in a friend once approved, and loved, which
enlarge the heart of him who hears them, and makes him scorn
small satire.

to
BOB GARNET, with his trowel, and box, and net, and many other
impediments, was going along very merrily, in a quiet path of the
Forest, thinking sometimes of Amy and her fundamental errors, and
sometimes of Eöa, and the way she could catch a butterfly, but for
the most part busy with the display of life around him, and the
prospects of a great boring family, which he had found in a willow-
tree. Suddenly, near the stag-headed oak, he chanced upon young
Eöa, tripping along the footpath lightly, smiling and blushing
rosily, and oh! so surprised to see him ! She darted aside, like a
trout at a shadow, then, finding it too late for that game, she tried
pass
him rapidly, with her long eyelashes drooping,
Oh, please to stop a minute, if you can spare the time,” said
Bob;
“what have I done to offend
you
?"
She stopped in a moment at his voice, and lifted her radiant eyes
to him, and shyly tried to cloud away the sparkling night of hair,
through which her white and slender throat gleamed like the Milky
Way. The sprays of the wood and the winds of May had romped
with her glorious tresses ; and now she had been lectured so, that
she doubted her right to show even her hair.
“Miss Nowell," said Bob, as she had not answered, but only been
thinking about him, “ only please to stop and tell me what I have
done to offend you; and you do love beetles so—and you never saw
such beauties—what have I done to offend you
?”
An English maiden would have said, “Oh, nothing at all, Mr.
Garnet;" and then swept on, with her crinoline embracing a
thousand brambles.
But Eöa stood just where she was, with her bright lips pouting
slightly, and her gaze absorbed by a tuft of moss.
* Only because you are not at all good-natured to me, Bob. But
it doesn't make much difference."
Then she turned away from him, and began to sing a little song,
and then called, “ Amy, Amy!"
“ Don't call Amy. I don't want her.”
"Oh, I beg your pardon, I'm sure I rather thought you did."
“Eöa !” said Bob; and she looked at him, and the tears were in
her eyes. And then she whispered, “Yes, Bob.”
“ You have got on the very prettiest dress I ever saw in all

"Oh, is that all ?” she answered. “But I am very glad indeel
that you like—my frock, Bob.” Here she looked down at it, with
much interest.
And, to tell you the truth,” continued he “I think, if you will
please not to be offended, that you look very well in it.”
Oh
yes, I am very well. I wish I was ill, sometimes.”
Now, I don't mean that. What I mean is, very nice."
“Well, I always try to be nice. But how can I, out butterfly-
hunting?"
“Now, you won't understand me. You are as bad as a weevil
that won't take chloroform. What I mean is, very pretty.”
“I don't know anything about that,” said Eöa, drawing back;
“and I don't see that you have any right even to talk about it. Oh,
there goes a lovely butterfly !”
Where, where? What eyes you have got! I do wish I was
married to you. What a collection we would have ! And you would
never let my traps off. I am sure that you are a great deal better
and prettier than Amy. And I like you more than anybody I have
ever seen."
Do
you, Bob? Are you sure of that?”
She fixed her large eyes upon his; and in one moment her beauty
went to the bottom of his heart. It changed him from a boy to a
man, from play to passion, from dreams to thought. And happy for
him that it was so, with the trouble impending over him.
She saw the change; herself too young, too simple (in spite of all
the evil that ever had drifted by her) to know or ask what it meant.
She only felt that Bob liked her now better than he liked Amy. She
had no idea of the deep anticipation of her eyes.
“ Eöa, won't you answer me?” He had been talking some
nonsense. “Why are you crying so dreadfully? Do you hate me
so much as all that ?"
“Oh no, no, Bob. I am sure I don't hate you at all. I only wish
I did. No, I don't, Bob. I am so glad that I don't. I don't
care a quarter so much, Bob, for all the rest of the world put
together."
“Then only look up at me, Eöa. I can't tell what I am saying.
Only look up. You are so nice. And you have got such eyes."
“Have I ?” said Eöa, throwing all their splendour on him ; "oh,
I am so glad you like them.”
“Do you think that you could give me just a sort of a kiss, Eöa ?
People always do, you know. And, indeed I feel that you ought
to do something of that sort, you know."
I scarcely know what is right, Bob, after all the things they
have told me. But perhaps you understand the proper thing in this
country, Bob."
“Then, I'll tell you what. Just let me give you one. The leaves
are coming out so."

“Well, that's a different thing," said Eö. “Amy can't see us,
can she ?"

Sir Cradock was very angry when his niece came home, and told
him, with an air of triumph, all that Bob had said to her.
“ That butterfly-hunting boy, Eöa! To think of his presuming
so! A mere boy! A boy like that!”
“ That's the very thing, uncle. If he had been a girl, you know,
I might not have liked him half so much. And as for his hunting
butterflies, I like him all the better for that. And we'll hunt them
all day long."
“Oh!" exclaimed Uncle Cradock, smiling at the young girl's
earnestness in spite of his indignation ; that is
married life then, is it? But we must not think of such nonsense,
Eöa : he is not your equal."
“Of course not, uncle. He is my superior in every possible
way.”
“Scarcely so, in the matter of birth; and as for money–he has
none.”
“For both of those I don't care two pice. You know it is all very
nice, Uncle Cradock, to live in large rooms, where you can put
three chairs together, and jump over them all without even knocking
your head, and to have beautiful books, and prawns for breakfast,
and flowers all the year round ; and to be able to scold people
without their daring to argue about it. That is all very nice ; but
I could do without a single bit of it—but I never could do without
Bob.”
"I fear you must, indeed, my dear. As other people have had
to do.”
Well, I don't see why, unless God takes him ; and then He
uld tal me too. And, indeed, I had better tell you once all,
Uncle Cradock, that I do not mean to try. It would be so shabby
of me, after what I told him just now, and after his saving my life;
and you yourself said yesterday that no Nowell had ever been
shabby. You have been very kind to me and good ; and I love
you very much, I am sure. But in spite of all that, I wish you clearly
to understand, Uncle Cradock, that if you try any nonsense with
me, I shall get my darling father's money, and go and live away
from you.”
My dear," said the old man, smiling at the manner and tone of
her menace, which she delivered as if her departure must at least
annihilate him, “you are laying your plans too rapidly. You are
not seventeen until next July; and you cannot touch your poor
father's money until you are twenty-one.”
“What do I care for that ?" she answered ; "he is sure to have
been right about it. But I will tell you another thing. Everybody
says that I could earn ten thousand a year as an opera-dancer in

London. And I should like it very much,—that is to say, if Bob did.
And I would not think of changing my name, as they say that you
made your son do. I should be ‘Miss Eöa Nowell, the celebrated
dancer.''
“ God forbid !” said Sir Cradock. “My only brother's only
child ! My darling, how little you know of the things you talk
about so lightly! Have I not been kind to you, my pretty dear
Eöa ?”
“Yes, to be sure, you have, Uncle Cradock; kinder than ever I
can deserve. And I would do anything to please you, except about
giving up my poor Bob. I like him ten times as much since you
told me that he has got no money. I never knew any one fit for
anything after they got money. All they think of, is more and
more, and to starve themselves, and everybody. You know, Uncle
Cradock, you do it yourself, because you have got such a lot of
money."
“What do you mean, Eöa ?”
“ As if you did not know now! You know you are starving your
own son, my poor Cousin Cradock. I am sure he was very nice,
uncle, from what everybody says of him, and I am quite certain
that you behaved very badly to him.”
“ My dear, you are allowed to say what you like, because nobody
can stop you. But your own good feeling should make you spare
me the pain of that sad subject.”
“Not if you deserve the pain for having been hard-hearted. And
much you cared for my pain, when you spoke of Bob so. Besides,
you are quite sure to hear of it; and it had better come from me,
dear uncle, who am so considerate.”
Something new? What is it, my child ? I can bear almost any
thing now.”
“ It is that some vile wretches are trying to get what they call a
warrant against him, and so to put him in jail.”
Put him in jail ? My unfortunate son ! What more has he been
doing?”
Nothing at all. And I don't believe that he ever did any harm.
But what the brutes say is that he did that terrible thing on purpose.
Oh, uncle, don't look at me like that. How I wish I had never told
Sir Cradock Nowell's mind was not so clear and strong as it had
been; although the rumours scattered by Georgie were shameful
exaggerations. The habit of brooding over his grief, whenever he
was alone—a habit more and more indulged, till it grew into a mor-
bid pleasure—the loss moreover of his wonted air, and wholesome
exercise (for he never would go out riding now, having no son to
ride with him) these, and the ever-present dread of some inevitable
inquiry, were now beginning to cloud and darken a quick and clear
intelligence.

He fell into the depths of an easy-chair, and wondered what it
was he had heard. The lids of his mind's eye had taken a blink, as
will happen sometimes to old people, and to young ones too for that
matter; neither was it the first time this thing had befallen him.
Then Eöa told him again what it was, because he made her tell
it ; and again it shocked him dreadfully ; but that time he remem-
bered it.
“And I have no doubt,” continued his niece, with bright tears on
her cheeks, "that Mrs. Corklemore herself is at the bottom of it.”
“Georgie ! What, my niece Georgie !”.
“She is not your niece, Uncle Cradock. I am your niece, and
nobody else; and you had better not think of wronging me.
call her your niece any more, I know I will never call you my uncle.
Nasty limy slimy thing! If you would only give me leave to choke
her !."
“My darling child," cried her uncle, who loved her the more
(though he knew it not) for siding with his son so,"you are so very
hot and hasty. I am sure Mrs. Corklemore speaks of you with the
warmest pity and affection."
“Shall I tell you why she does, Uncle Crad ? Shall I tell you in
plain English ? Most likely you will be shocked, you know."
“My dear, I am so used to you, that I am never shocked now at
anything."
Then it is because she is such a jolly liar."
"Eöa, I really must send you to a nice institution for young
ladies. You get worse and worse.”
“ If you do, I'll jump over the wall the first night, and Bob shall
come to catch me. But now without any nonsense, uncle, for you
do talk a good deal of nonsense, will you promise me one thing?"
“A dozen, if you like, my darling. Anything in reason. You
did look so like your poor father then.”
“Oh, I am so glad of that. But it is not a thing of reason, uncle;
it is simply a thing of justice. Now will you promise solemnly to
send away Mrs. Corklemore, and never speak to her again, if she
vows that she knows nothing of this, and if I prove from her own
handwriting that it is her plot altogether, and also another plot
against us, every bit as bad, if not worse?”
Of course, 'Eöa, I will promise you that, as solemnly as you
please. What a deluded child you are !"
“Am I? Now let her come in, and deny it. That's the first part
of the business.”
Without waiting for an answer, she ran to fetch Mrs. Corklemore,
whom she well knew where to find, that time of the afternoon.
Dear Georgie had just had her cup of tea with the darling Flore, in
her private audience-chamber—"oratory” she called it, though all
her few prayers were public; and now she was meditating what
dress she should wear at dinner. Those dinners were so dreadfully

dull, unless she could put Eöa into a vehement passion—which was
not very hard to do-and so exhibit her in a pleasant light before
the serving-men. Yet, strange to say, although the young lady ob-
served little moderation, when she was baited thus, and sunk irony
in invective, the sympathies of the audience were far more often on
her side than on that of the soft tormentor.
" Come, now, Sugar-plums,” said Eöa, who often addressed her
so, we want you down-stairs, if you please, for a minute.”
“Tum, pease, Oh Ah,” cried little Flore, running up ; "pease
tum, and tell Fore a tory.”
Can't now, you good little child. And your mamma tells stories
so cleverly, oh, so very cleverly, it quite takes away one's breath.”
“ I'll have my change out of you at dinner-time," said Georgie to
herself most viciously, as she followed down the passage.
Eöa led her along at a pace which made her breath quite shcrt,
for she was not wont to hurry so, and she dropped right gladly into
the chair which Sir Cradock politely set for her. Then, as he him-
self sat down, facing her with a heavy sigh, Georgie felt rather un-
comfortable. She was not quite ready for the crisis, but feared that
it was coming. And she saw at a glimpse that her hated foe,
Never-spot-the-dust," was quite ready, burning indeed to begin,
only wanting to make the most of it. Thereupon Mrs. Corklemore,
knowing the value of the weather-gage, and being unable to bear a
slow silence, was the first to speak.
“ Something has occurred, I see, to one of you two dear ones. Oh,
Uncle Cradock, what can I do to prove the depth of my regard for
you? Or-
“To be sure, the depth of your regard,” Eöa interrupted.
“Or is it for you, you poor wild thing? We all make suclı allow-
ance for you, because of your great disadvantages. If you have
done anything very wrong indeed, poor darling, anything which hard
people would call not only thoughtless but unprincipled, I can feel
for you so truly, because of your hot temperament and most unhappy
circumstances.”
"You had better not go too far!” cried Eöa, grinding her little teeth,
“ Thank Heaven! I see, dear, it is nothing so very disgraceful
after all, because it has nothing to do with you, or you would not
smile so prettily. You take it so lightly, it must be something about
dear Uncle Cradock. Oh, Uncle Cradock, tell me all about it ; my
whole heart will be with you."
“Our silky hen has broken her eggs. Nothing more," said Eöa.
“ De-ar, oh we do love you so !” She made two syllables of that
word, as Mr. Corklemore used to do, in her many gushing moments.
Georgie looked at Eöa with wonder. How stupid to think her a
stupid !
Then Sir Cradock Nowell rose, in a stately manner, to put an end
to all this little nonsense.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
“My niece, Eöa, declares, Mrs. Corklemore, that you, in some
underhand manner, have promoted a horrible charge against my
poor son Cradock, a charge which no person in any way connected
with our family should ever dare to utter, even if he or she believed
its justice, far less dare to bring forward, and even force into the
courts of law. Is this so, or is it not?”
“Oh, Uncle Cradock, how can you speak so? What charge
should I ever dream of?”
See how her hands are trembling, and how white her lips are;
not with telling black lies, Uncle Cradock, but with being found
out.”
“ Eöa, have the kindness not to interrupt again.”
“Very well, Uncle Cradock; I won't, unless you make me."
“Then, as I understand, madam, you deny entirely the truth of
this accusation ?”
“Of course I do, most emphatically. What can you all be dream-
ing about?”
Now, Eöa, it is your turn to establish what you have said."
“I can't establish anything, though I know it, Uncle Cradock."
“Know it, indeed, you poor wild nautch-girl! Dreamed it you
mean, I suppose."
“I mean," continued Eöa, not even looking at her, but bending
her fingers in a manner which Georgie quite understood, “that I
cannot prove anything, Uncle Cradock, without your permission.
But here I have a letter, with the seal unbroken, and which I pro-
mised some one not to open without her leave, and now she has
given me leave to open it, with your consent, and in the presence of
the writer. Why, how pale you are, Mrs. Corklemore!”
“My Heavens! And this is England! Stealing letters, and
forging them-_"
“Which of the two do you mean, madam ?” asked Sir Cradock,
looking at her in his old magisterial manner, after examining the
envelope ; “either involves a heavy charge against a member of my
family. Is this letter yours, or not?”
“Yes, it is," replied Georgie, after a moment's debate, for if she
called it a forgery, it must of course be opened ; “have the kindness
to give me my property. I thought there was among well-bred
people a delicacy as to scrutinizing even the directions of one
another's letters."
“So there is, madam ; you are quite right-except, indeed, under
circumstances altogether exceptional, and of which this is one. Now
for your own exculpation, and to prove that my niece deserves heavy
punishment (which I will take care to inflict), allow me to open this
letter. I see it is merely a business letter, or I would not ask even
that ; although you have so often assured me that you have no secret
in the world from me. You can have nothing confidential to say to
'Simon Chope, Esq. ;' and if you had, it should remain sacred and

secure with me, unless it involved the life and honour of my son.
Shall I open this letter ?”
“Certainly not, Sir Cradock Nowell. How dare you to think of
such a thing, so mean, so low, so prying?”
After those words, madam, you cannot continue to be a guest of
mine; or be ever received in this house again, unless you prove that
I have wronged you, by allowing me to send for your husband, and
to place this letter in his hands, before you have in any way com-
municated with him."
“Give ine my letter, Sir Cradock Nowell, unless your niece
inherits the thieving art from you. As for you, wretched little
Dacoit," here she bent upon Eöa flashing, eyes quite pale from
wrath, for sweet Georgie had her temper, “bitterly you shall rue the
day when you presumed to match yourself with me. You would
like to do a little murder, I see. No doubt it runs in the family ;
and the Thugs and Dacoits are first cousins, of course."
Never had Eöa fought so desperate a battle with herself, as now
to keep her hands off Georgie. Without looking at her again, she
very wisely ran away, for it was the only chance of abstaining. Mrs.
Corklemore laughed aloud; then she took the letter, which the old
man had placed upon the table, and said to him, with a kind look of
pity,
What a fuss you have made about nothing! It is only a ques-
tion upon the meaning of a clause in my marriage-settlement; but
I do not choose to have my business affairs exposed, even to my
husband. Now do you believe me, Uncle Cradock?”
No, I cannot say that I do, madam. And it does not matter
whether I do or not. You have used language about my family
which I can never forget. A carriage will be at your service at any
moment you please.”
“ Thanks for your hospitable hint. You will soon find your
mis-
take, I think, in having made me your enemy; though your rudeness
is partly excused, no doubt, by your growing hallucinations. Fare-
well for the present, poor dear Sir Cradock Nowell.”
With these words, Mrs. Corklemore made him an elegant curtsy,
and swept away from the room, without even the glisten of a tear to
mar her gallant bearing, although she had been so outraged. But
when she got little Flore's head on her lap, she cried over it very
vehemently, and felt the depth of her injury.
When she had closed the door behind her (not with any vulgar
bang, but firmly and significantly), the master of the house walked
over to a panelled mirror, and inspected himself uncomfortably.
It was a piece of ancient glass, purchased from an Italian chapel by
some former Cradock Nowell, and bearing a mystic name and fame
among the maids who dusted it. By them it was supposed to have
a weird prophetic power, partly, no doubt, from its deep dark lustre,
and partly because it was circular, and ever so slightly, and quite

there were, of course, many founts of error in this Italian mirror.
Nevertheless, all young ladies who ever beheld it were charmed
with it, so sweetly deeply beautiful, like Galatea watching herself
and finding Polypheme over her shoulder, in the glass of the blue
Sicilian sea.
To this glass Sir Cradock Nowell went to examine his faded
eyes, time-worn, trouble-worn, stranded by the ebbing of the brain.
He knew too well what Mrs. Corklemore meant by her last thrust;
and the word “hallucination” happened, through a great lawsuit
then in progress, to be invested with an especial proininence and
significance. While he was sadly gazing into the convergence of
grey light, and feebly reassuring himself, yet like his image waver-
ing, a heavy step was heard behind him, and beside his flowing
silvery locks appeared the close-cropped massive brow and the
gloomy eyes of Bull Garnet.
CHAPTER LIX.
MR. GARNET DECLARES HIMSELF.
As the brothers confronted one another, the well-born and the base-
born, the man of tact and the man of force, the luxurious and the
labourer, strangely unlike in many respects, more strangely alike in
others; each felt kindly and tenderly, yet tímidly, for the other.
The old man thought of the lying wrong inflicted upon the
stronger one by their common father; the other felt the worse
wrong done by himself to his brother. The measure of such
things is not for us. God knows, and deals with, and forgives
them.
Even by the failing light-for the sun was westering, and a cloud
flowed over him-each could see that the other's face was not as it
should be, that the flight of weeks was drawing age on, more than
the lapse of years should.
“ Garnet, you do a great deal too much. I shall recall my urgent
request, if you look so harassed and haggard. Take a holiday now
for a month, before the midsummer rents fall due. I will try to do
without you'; though I may want you any day.”
“I will do nothing of the sort ; work is needful for me-without
it I should die. But you also look very unwell. You must not
attempt to prescribe for me.”

“I have not been happy lately. By-and-by things will be better.
What is your impression of Mrs. Nowell Corklemore?”
“That she is an arrant hypocrite, unscrupulous, foul, and
deadly."
“Well, that is plain speaking; and by no means complimentary.
Poor Georgie, I hope you misjudge her, as she says bad people
always do. But for the present she is gone. There has been a
great fight, all along, between her and Eöa; they could not bear
one another. And now my niece has discovered a thing which
brings me to her side in the matter; for she at least is
genuine.”
“That she is indeed, and genuinely passionate ; you may trust
her with anything. She has been very rude indeed to me; and
yet I like her wonderfully. What has she discovered ?"
" That Mrs. Corklemore is at the bottom of this horrible appli-
cation for a warrant against my son."
“I can well believe it. It struck me in a moment; though I
cannot see her object. I never understand plotting.”
“Neither do 1, Garnet; I only know she has made me insult the
dearest friend I ever had or shall have upon earth.”
“Yes, Mr. Rosedew; I heard of it, and was astonished at your
weakness. But it did not become me to interfere."
“Certainly not: most certainly not. You could not expect me to
bear it. And the Rosedews never liked you."
“That has nothing to do with it. Very probably they are right;
for I do not like myself. And you will not dislike, but loathe me,
when you know what I have to say."
Bull Garnet's mind was now made up. For months he had been
thinking, forecasting, doubting, wavering—a condition of mind so
strange to him, so adrift froin all his landmarks, that this alone,
without sense of guilt, would have kept him in constant wretched-
ness.
Sir Cradock Nowell only said, “ Keep it for another time. I
cannot bear any more excitement; I have had so much to-day
already.”
Bull Garnet looked at him sorrowfully. He could not bear to see
his brother beaten so by trouble, and to feel his own hard hand
in it.
“Don't you know what they say of me? Oh, you know what
they say of me; and nothing of the kind in the family!" The old
man seemed to prove that there was, by the vague flashing of his
eyes :
“Garnet, you are my brother; after all, you are my brother.
And they say I am going mad; and I know they will try to shut me
up, without a horse, or a book, or a boy to brush my trousers.
Oh, Garnet, you have been bitterly wronged, shamefully wronged,
detestably; but you will not let your own brother-brother, whó
has no sons now to protect him,-be shut up, and made nothing

CRADOCK NOWELL.
of? Bull Garnet, promise me this, although we have so wronged
you.”
Garnet knew not what to do. Even he was taken aback, shocked
by this sudden outburst, which partly proved what it denied. And
this altogether changed the form of the confession he was come to
make--and changed it for the better.
“My brother”-it was the first time he had ever so addressed
him ; not from diffidence, but from pride~"my brother, let us look
at things, if possible, as God made them. I have been basely
wronged myself, almost as much as my mother was-blasted, both
of us, for life, according to the little ideas of this creeping world.
In many cases, the thief is the rogue; in even more, the robbed
one is the only villain. Now can you take the large view of
things which is forced upon us outsiders when we dare to think at
all ?
“I cannot think now of such abstract things. My mind is
astray with trouble. Did I ever tell you your mother's words, when
she came here ten or twelve years ago, and demanded a share
of the property? Not for her own sake, but for yours, to get you
into some business."
“No, I never heard of it. How it must have wrung her proud
heart !” Bull Garnet was astonished; because it had long been
understood that his mother should not be spoken of.
“And mine as well. I gave her a cheque for a liberal sum, as I
thought. She tore it, and threw it at me. What more could I do?
Did I deserve her curse, Garnet ? Is all this trouble come upon me
because I did not obey her?”
“I believe that you meant to do exactly what was right.”
“I hope—I believe, I did. And see how wrong she was in one
part of her prediction. She said that I, and my father also, should
pay the penalty through you, through you, her only son. Could she
have made any greater mistake? You, who are my right arm and
brain; my only hope, my support, and comfort!”
Sir Cradock Nowell came up, and looked with the deepest trust
and admiration at his unacknowledged brother. A few months
ago, Bull Garnet would have taken such a look as his truest and
best revenge for the cruel wrong to his mother. But now he fell
away from it, and muttered something, sad and dark, and choked
with his own misery. His mind had been settled to come and tell
all; but how could he do it now, and wrench the old man's latest
hope away?
Then suddenly he remembered, or knew from his own feelings,
that an old man's last hope in earthly matters should rest upon
no friend or brother, nor even upon a wife, but upon his own
begotten, his successors in the world. And what he had to
say, while tearing all reliance from himself, would replace it where
it should be.

Meanwhile Sir Cradock Nowell, thinking that Garnet was too
grateful for a few kind words, followed him, and placed his slender
tremulous and pure-bred hand in the useful cross-bred palm which
had sent Mr. Jupp down the coal-shaft.
“Bull, you are my very best friend. After all, we are brothers,
Promise to defend me."
But Garnet only withdrew his hand, and sighed, and could not
look at him.
Oh, then, even you believe it; I see you do! It must be true.
God have mercy upon me!”
“Cradock, it is a cursed lie; you must not dwell upon it. Such
thoughts are spawn of madness. Turn to another subject. Just
tell me what is the greatest thing one man can do to another ?”
“To love him, I suppose, Garnet. But I don't care much for
that sort of thing, since I lost my children."
“ Yes, it is a grand thing to love ; but far grander to forgive.”
“Is it? I am glad to hear it. I always could forgive.”
“ Little things, you mean, no doubt. Slights and slurs—and so
forth ?”
“Yes, and great things also. But I am not what I was. You
know what I have had to go through-many things, yes, many
things; I cannot remember half of them.”
“ Can you forgive as deep a wrong as one man ever did to
another ?"
Yes, I dare say. I am sure I don't know. What makes you
look at me like that?"
“ Because I shot your son Clayton ; and because I did it on
purpose."
"Viley ! my boy Viley shooting! Oh, I had forgotten. What a
stupid thing of me! I thought he was dead somehow. Now, I
will open the door for him, because his hands are full. And let
him put his game on the table-never mind the papers-he always
likes me to see it. Oh, Viley, how long you have been away!
What a bag you must have made ! Come in, my boy; come
in.”
Bull Garnet's heart cleaved to his side, as the old man opened
the door, and looked, with the leaping joy of a father's love, for his
pet, his beloved, his treasured one. But nothing except cold air
came in.
“ The passage is empty. Perhaps he is waiting, because his
boots are dirty. Tell him not to think twice about that. I am
fidgety sometimes, I know; and I scolded him last Friday. But
now he may come any how, if he will only come to me. I am so
dull without him."
“ You will never see him more"-Bull Garnet whispered through
a flood of tears, like grass waving out of water—"until it pleases
God to take you home, where son and father go alike ; sometimes

one first, sometimes other, as His holy will is. He came to an
unholy end. I tell you again-I shot him.”
Excuse me; I don't quite catch your words. There was a grey
hare, with a nick in her ear, who came to the breakfast-room window
all through the hard weather last winter, and he promised me not to
shoot her; and I am sure that he cannot have done it, because he
is so soft-hearted, and that is why I love him so. Talk of Cradock
--talk of Cradock! Perhaps he is cleverer than Viley—though I
never will believe it—but is he half so soft and sweet? Will the
pigeons sit on his shoulder so, and the dogs nuzzle under his coat-
lap? Tell me that—tell me that-Bull Garnet."
He leaned on the strong arm of his steward, and looked eagerly
for his answer ; then trembled with an exceeding great fear, to see
that he was weeping. That such a man should weep! But Garnet
forced himself to speak.
“ You cannot listen to me now; I will come again, and talk to
you. God knows the agony to me; and worst of all that it is for
nothing. Yet all of it is not a thousandth part of the anguish I have
caused. Perhaps it is wisest so. Perhaps it is for my children's
sake that I, who have killed your pet child, cannot make you know
it. Yet it adds to my despair, that I have killed the father
also.”
Scarcely knowing voice from silence, dazed himself, and blurred,
and giddy-so strong is contagion of the mind-Bull Garnet went
to the stables, saddled a horse without calling groom, and rode off
at full gallop to Dr. Buller. By the time he got there his business
habits and wonted fashion of thought had returned, and he put
what he came for in clear form, tersely, crisply, dryly, as if in the
world there were no such thing as ill-regulated emotion-except on
the part of other people.
Not a bit of it,” said Dr. Buller; "his mind is as sound as yours
or mine, and his constitution excellent. He has been troubled of
course a good deal; but bless me-I know a man who lost his
three children in a month, and could scarcely pay for their coffins, sir.
And his wife only six weeks afterwards. That is what I call trouble,
sir !"
Bull Garnet knew, from glistening eyes, and the quivering of
grey locks, that the man Dr. Buller was speaking of happened to be
his own only son.
Reassured about Sir Cradock, yet fearing to try him further at
present, Mr. Garnet went heavily homewards, after begging Dr.
Buller to call, as if by chance, at the Hall, observe, and attend to
the master.
Heavily and wearily Bull Garnet went to the home which once
had been so sweet to him, and was now beloved so painfully: The
storms of earth were closing round him, only the stars of heaven
were bright. Myriad as the forest leaves, and darkly moving in

like manner, fears, and doubts, and miseries sprang and trembled
through his heart and soul.
No young maid at his door to meet him lovingly and gaily. None
to say, “Oh, darling father, how hungry you must be, dear!" Only
Pearl, so wan and cold, and scared of soft affection. And as she
timidly approached, then dropped her eyes before his gaze, and
took his hat submissively, as if she had no lips to kiss, no hand to
lay on his shoulder, he saw with one quick glance that still some
new grief had befallen her, that still another trouble was come to
make its home with her.
“ What is it, Pearl ?” he asked her sadly ; come in here and
tell me.” He never called her his Pearly now, his little native, or
pretty pet, as he used to do in the old days. They had dropped
those little endearments.
“You will be sorry to hear it-sorry, I mean, that it happened ;
but I could not have done otherwise."
“I never hear anything, now, Pearl, but what I am sorry to hear.
This cannot make much difference.”
“So I suppose,” she answered. “Mr. Pell has been here to-day,
and-and-oh, father, you know what.”
“ Indeed I have not been told of anything. What do I know of
Mr. Pell?"
“ More than he does of you, sir. He asked me to be his wife.”
“ He is a good man.
But of course you said 'No.'"
“Of course I did. Of course, of course. What else can I ever
She leaned her white cheek on the high oak mantel, and a little
deep sob came from her heart.
“Would you have liked to say "Yes,' Pearl ?” her father asked
very softly, going to put his arm round her waist, and then shrinking
back from doing it.
“Oh no! oh no! At least, not yet, though I respect him very
highly. But I told him that í never could, and never could tell him
The reason. And oh, I was so sorry for him—he looked so hurt,
and disappointed."
“ You shall tell him the reason very soon, or rather the news-
papers shall.”
Father, don't say that ; dear father, you are bound for our sake.
I don't care for him one atom, father, compared with—compared
with you, I mean. Only I thought I must tell you, because -oh,
you know what I mean. And even if I did like him, what would it
matter about me? Oh, father, I often think that I have been too
hard upon you, and all of it through me, and my vile concealment !"
“My daughter, I am not worthy of you. Would God that you
could forgive me !".
“I have done it long ago, my father. Do you think a child of
yours could help it, after all your anguish?”

“My child, look kindly at me ; try to look as if you loved
She turned to him with such a look as a man only gets once in
his life, and then she fell upon his neck, and forgot the world and
all it held, except her own dear father. Wrong he might have done,
wrong he had done; but who was she, his little child, to remember
it against him ?
She lay for a moment in his arms, overcome with passion, lean-
ing back, as she had done there, when a weanling infant. For him
it was the grandest moment of his passionate life-a father's power-
ful love, ennobled by the presence of his God. Such a moment
teaches us the grandeur of our race, the traces of a higher world
stamped on us indelibly. Then we feel, and try to own, that in
spite of satire, cynicism, and the exquisite refinements of the purest
selfishness, there is, in even the sharpest and the shallowest of us,
something kind and solid, some abiding element of the all-pervading
goodness.
“Now I will go through with it”-Bull Garnet was recovering-
my own child; go and fetch your brother, if it will not be too much
for you. If you think it will, only send him.”
“Father, I will fetch him. I may be able to help you both.
And now I am so much better."
Presently she returned with Bob, who looked rather plagued and
uncomfortable, with a great slice of cork in one hand and a bottle
of gum in the other, and a regular housewife of needles in the lappet
of his coat. He was going to mount a specimen of a variety of
“ devil's coach-horse," which he had never seen before, and whose
tail was forked like a trident.
“Never can let me alone,” said Bob; "just ready to begin I was ;
and I am sure to spoil his thorax. He is getting stiff every
moment.”
Bull Garnet looked at him brightly and gladly, even at such a
time. Little as he knew or cared about the things that crawl and
hop-as he ignorantly put it--skilled no more in natural history
than our early painters were, yet from his own strong sense he per-
ceived that his son had a special gift ; and a special gift is genius,
and may (with good luck) climb eminence. "Then he thought
of what he had to tell him, and the power of his heart was
gone.
It was the terror of this moment which had dwelt with him night
and day, more than the fear of public shame, of the gallows, or of
hell. To be loathed and scorned by his only son! Oh that Pearl
had not been so true; oh that Bob suspected something, or had
even found it out for himself! Then the father felt that now came
part of his expiation.
Bob looked at him quite innocently with wonder and some fear,
To him “the governor” long had been the strangest of all puzzles,

sometimes so soft and loving, sometimes so hard and terrible. Per-
haps poor Bob would catch it now for his doings with Eöa.
i Sit down there, my son. Not there, but further from me.
Don't be at all afraid, my boy. I have no fault to find with you.
I am far luckier in my son, than you are in your father. You must
try to bear terrible news, Bob. Your sister long has borne it.”
Pearl, who was ghastly pale and trembling, stole a glance at each
of them from the dark end of the room, then came up bravely into
the lamplight, took Bob's hand and kissed him, and sat close by to
comfort him.
Bull Garnet sighed from the depths of his heart. His children
seemed to be driven from him, and to crouch together in fear of
him.
“ It serves me right. I know that, of course. That only makes
it the worse to bear."
“Father, what is it ?” cried Bob, leaping up, and dropping his
cork-slice and gum-bottle ; " whatever the matter is, father, tell me,
that I may stand by you.”
“ You cannot stand me in this. When you know what it is,
you will fly from me.”
“Will I, indeed! A likely thing. Oh, father, you think I am
such a soft, because I am fond of little things."
“Would you stand by your father, Bob, if you knew that he was
a murderer?"
"Oh come,” said Bob, "you are drawing it a little too strong,
dad. You never could be that, you know.”
“ I not only can be, but am, my son.”
Father and son looked at one another. The governor standing
square and broad, with his shoulders thrown well back, and no
trace of emotion in form or face, except that his quick wide nostrils
quivered, and his lips were white. The stripling gazing up at him,
seeking for some sign of jest, seeking for a ray of laughter in his
father's eyes ; too young to comprehend the power and fury and
stillness of large passion.
Ere either spoke another word--for the father was hurt at the
son's delay, and the son felt all abroad in his head—between them
glided Pearl, the daughter, the sister, the gentle woman—the one
most wronged of all, and yet the dearest one to forgive it.
Darling, he did it for my sake,” she whispered to her brother,
though it cut through her heart to
say
it. “Father, oh father, Bob
is so slow ; don't be angry with him. Come to me a moment,
father, for I still shall love and honour you !"
Those last few words to the passionate man were like heaven
poured into hell. That a child of his should still honour him! He
kissed her with tenfold the love that young man has for maiden !
then he turned away and could not, for the moment, speak or think.
Very little more was said. Pearl went away to Bob, and whis-

pered how this fate befell; and Bob wept great tears for her sake,
and most of all for his father's sake. Then, as the father lay
cramped up upon the little sofa, wrestling with the power of life and
the promise of death, Bob came up, and kissed him dearly on his
rugged forehead.
“Is that you, my own dear son ? God is far too good to me."
CHAPTER LX.

it.”
THAT night the man of violence enjoyed the first sweet dreamless
sleep that had spread its velvet shield between him and his guilt
and sorrow. Pearl, who had sat up late with Bob, comforting and
crying with him, listened at her father's door, and heard his quiet
breathing. Through many months of trouble, now, she had watched
him kindly, tenderly, fearing ever some wild outbreak upon others
or himself, hiding in her empty heart all its desolation.
The very next day, Bull Garnet resolved to have it out with his
son; not to surprise him by emotion to a hasty issue, but now to learn
what he thought and felt, after taking his time about it. All this
we need not try to tell, only so much as bears upon the staple of the
story.
“Father, I know that you had-you had good reason for doing
“ There could be no good reason. There might be, and were
many bad ones. Of this I will not speak to you. I did it in
violence and fury, and under a false impression. When I saw him,
with his arm cast round my pure and darling Pearl, and when I
thought of my mother's wrong, Satan's rage is a 'baby's rattle
compared to the fury of my heart. He had his gun, and I
had mine; I had taken it to shoot a squirrel which meddled
with our firework nonsense. I tore her from him before I could.
speak, thrust her aside, stepped back two paces, gave him 'one,
two, three,' and fired. He had time to fire in self-defence, and his
muzzle was at my head, and his finger on the trigger ; but there it
crooked, and he could not pull. Want of nerve, I suppose. I saw
his finger shaking, and then I saw him fall. Now, my son, you
know everything.
" Why, father, after all then, it was nothing worse than a duel.
He had just the same chance of killing you, and would have done
it, only you were too quick for him."
“Even to retain your love, I will have no lie in the matter, Bob ;

"
although a duel, in my opinion, is only murder made game of. But
this was no duel, no manslaughter even, but an act of downright
murder. No English jury could help convicting me, and I will
never plead insanity. It was the inevitable result of inborn
violence and self-will, growing and growing from year to year, and
strengthened by wrongs of which you know little. God knows
that I have fought against it ; but my weapon was pride, not
humility. Now let this miserable subject never be recurred to by
us, at least in words, till the end comes. As soon as I hear that
poor innocent Cradock is apprehended, and brought to England, I
shall surrender myself and confess. But for your sake and poor
Pearly's, I should have done so at the very outset. Now it is very
likely that I may not have the option. Two persons know that I
did it, although they have no evidence, so far as I am aware ; a
third person more than suspects it, and is seeking about for the
evidence. Moreover, Sir Cradock Nowell, to whom, as I told you,
I owned my deed, although he could not then understand me, may
have done so since, or may hereafter do so, at any lucid interval.”
“Oh, father, fat
he never would be so mean
He is bound by his duty to do it-and for his living son's sake
he must. I only tell you these things, my son, to spare you a part
of the shock. One month now is all I crave, to do my best for you
two darlings. I will not ruin the chance by going again to poor Sir
Cradock. God saved me from my own rash words, doubtless for
your pure sake. Now, knowing all, and reflecting upon it, can you
call me still your father, Bob?"
This was one of the times that tell whether a father has through
life thought more of himself or of his children. If of himself, they
fall away, like Southern ivies in a storm, parasites which cannot
cling, but glide on the marble surface. But if he has made his
future of them, closer they cling, and clasp more firmly, like our
British ivy engrailed into the house wall.
So the Garnet family clung together, although no longer blossom-
ing, but flagging sorely with blight and canker, and daily fear of the
woodman. Bob, of course, avoided Eöa, to her great indignation,
though he could not quite make up his mind to tell her that all was
over, without showing reason for it. In the forcing temperature of
trouble, he was suddenly become a man, growing daily more like his
father, in all except the violence. He roamed no more through the
wilds of the forest, but let the birds nest comfortably, the hutterflies
hover in happiness, and the beetle cast his shard unchallenged. All
those things he might care for again, if he ever recovered his comfort.
Now Eöa, as everybody knew, did not by any means embody the
spirit of toleration. She would hardly allow any will but her own in
anything that concerned her. In a word, she was a child, a very
warm-hearted and lovely one, but therefore all the more requiring a
strong will founded on common sense to lead her into the life-

brunt. And so, if she must have Bob some day, she had better
have him consolidated, though reduced to three per cent.
Not discerning her own interests, she would have been wild as a
hare ought to be at the vernal equinox, but for one little fact. There
was nobody to be jealous of. Darling Amy, whom she loved as all
young ladies love one another-until they see cause to the contrary
-sweet thing, she was gone to Oxford with her dear, good father.
They had slipped off without any fuss at all (except from Biddy
O’Gaghan, who came and threw an old shoe at them), because Mr.
Rosedew, in the first place, felt that he could not bear any public
farewell, and thought, in the second place, that it would be an un-
courteous act towards Sir Cradock Nowell to allow any demonstra-
tion. And yet it was notorious that even Job Hogstaff had arranged
to totter down on Mark Stote's arm, followed by a dozen tenants (all
of whom had leases), and the rank and file of Nowelhurst who had
paid their house-rent; and then there would be a marshalling out-
side the parsonage-gate ; and upon the appearance of the fly, Job
with his crutch would testify, whereupon a shout would arise pro-
nouncing everlasting divorce between Church and State in Nowel-
hurst, undying gratitude to the former, and defiance of the latter
power.
Yet all this programme was set at nought by the departure of John
and his household gods at five o'clock one May morning. Already
he had received assurance from some of his ancient co-mates at
Oriel (most cohesive of colleges) that they would gladly welcome
him, and find him plenty of work to do. In less than six weeks'
time, of course, the long vacation would begin. What of that? Let
him come at once, and with his widespread reputation he must have
the pick of all the men who would stay up to read for honours. For
now the fruit of a lifetime lore was ripening over his honoured head,
not (like that of Tantalus) wafted into the cloud-land, not even
waiting to be plucked at, but falling unawares into his broad and
simple bosom, where it might lie uncared for, except for the sake of
Amy. So large a mind had long outlived the little itch for fame,
wrongly perhaps supposed to be "the last infirmity of noble
minds." Their first it is, beyond all doubt; and wisely nature
orders it. Their last is far more apt to be—at least in this genera-
tion contempt of fame, and man, and God, except for practical
purposes.
Mr. Rosedew's careful treatises upon the Sabellian and Sabello-
Oscan elements had stirred up pleasant controversy in the narrow
world of scholars; and now at the trito-megistic blow of the Roseo-
rorine hammer, ringing upon no less a theme than the tables of
Iguvium, the wise men who sit round the board of classical educa-
tion, even Jupiter Grabovius (the original of John Bull), had clapped
their hands and cried, “ Hear, hear! He knows what he is talking
of; and he is one of us."

That, after all, is the essence of it—to know what one is talking
of. And the grand advantage of the ancient universities is, not the
tone of manners, not the knowledge of life-rather a hat-box thing
with them-not even the high ideal, the manliness, and the chivalry,
which the better class of men win ; but the curt knowledge, whether
or not they are talking of what they know. Scire quod nescias is
taught, if they teach us nothing else. And though we are all
still apt to talk, especially among ladies, of things beyond our
acquaintance-else haply we talk but little—we do so with a qualm,
and quasi, and quemadmodum, and fluttering sense that effronterý
is not—but leads to—“pluck.”
As they rose the hill towards Carfax, Amy (tired as she was)
trembled with excitement. Her father had won a cure in St. Oles
- derived no doubt from oleo—and all were to lodge in Pembroke
Lane, pending mature arrangements. Though they might have
turned off near the jail, and saved a little cab fare, John would go by
the broader way, as his fashion always was; except in a little post-
humous matter, wherein perhaps we have over-defined with brimstone
the direction-posts.
Be that as it may,—not to press the scire quod nescias (potential
in such a case, we hope, rather than conjunctive)—there they must
be left, all three, with Jenny and Jemima outside, and Jem Pottles
on the pavement, amazed at the cheek of everything. Only let one
thing be said. Though prettier girl than Amy Rosedew had never
stepped on the stones of Oxford since the time of Amy Robsart, if
even then,-never once was she insulted.
Lowest of all low calumnies. There are blackguards among
university men, as everybody knows, and as there must be among
all men. But even those blackguards can see the difference between
a lady, or rather between a pure girl and-another. And even those
blackguards have an intensified reverence for the one ;-but let the
matter pass; for now we hide in gold these subjects, and sham not
to see their flaunting.
Be it, however, confessed that Amy (whose father soon had rooms
in college, not to live, but to lecture in), being a very shy young
maiden, never could be brought to come and call him to his tea,
oh no.
So many young men in gorgeous trappings, charms, and
dangles, and hooks of gold, and eye-glasses very knowing not to
mention volunteer stuff, and knickerbockers demonstrant of calf-
oddly enough they always happened to feel such interest in the archi-
tecture of the porter's lodge whenever Amy came by, never gazing
too warmly at her, but contriving to convey their regret at the sup-
pression of their sentiments, and their yearning to be the stones she
trod on, and their despair at the possibility of her not caring if they
were so-really all this was so trying that Amy would never go into
college without Aunt Doxy before her, gazing four-gunned cupolas
even at scouts and manciples.

And this was a most provoking thing upon the part of Amy, not
only to the hearts that beat under waistcoats ordered for her dear sake,
but also to the domestic kettle a-boil in Pembroke Lane. For, over
and over again, Uncle John, great as he was in chronology and
every kind of “marmora,” and able to detect a flaw upon Potamo-
geiton's tombstone, lost all sense of time and place, me and te, and
hocce and Doxy, and calmly went home some two hours late, and
complacently received Doxology.
But alas, we must abandon Amy to the insidious designs of Heb-
domadal Board, the velvet approaches of Proctor and Pro, and the
brass of the gentlemen Bedels, while we regard more rugged scenes,
from which she was happily absent.
CHAPTER LXI.
TO FLY IS NOT TO FLY AWAY.
FOR by this time Dr. Hutton had discovered the missing link, and
at the same time the strongest staple, of the desired evidence. The
battered gun-barrels had been identified, and even the number
deciphered, by the foreman of Messrs. L and Co. And the
entry in their books of the sale of that very gun (number, gauge, and
other particulars beyond all doubt corresponding) was—“to Bull
Garnet, &c., Nowelhurst Dell Cottage,” whom also they could
identify from his “strongly-marked physiognomy," and his quick,
decisive manner. And the cartridge-case, which had lain so long
in Dr. Hutton's pocket, of course they could not depose to its sale,
together with the gun ; but this they could show, that it fitted the
barrels, was not at all of a common gauge, but two sizes larger-
No. 10, in fact—and must have been sold during the month in
which they sold the gun, because it was one of a sample which they
had taken upon approval, and soon discarded for a case of better
manufacture.
Then as to motive, Rufus Hutton himself could depose to that,
or the probability of it, from what he had seen, but not understood,
at the fixing of the fireworks ; neither had he forgotten the furious
mood of Bull Garnet, not only then, but also in his garden during
the morning.
While he was doubting how to act-for, clearly as he knew his
power to hang the man who had outraged him, the very fact of his
injury made him loth to use that power; for he was not at all a
vindictive man, now the heat of the thing was past, and he saw that

the sudden attack had been made in self-defence-while he was
hesitating between his sense of duty and pity for Cradock on one
hand, and his ideas of magnanimity and horror of hanging a man
on the other, he was thrown, without any choice or chance, across
the track of Simon Chope.
Perhaps there is no more vulgar error, no stronger proof of
ignorance and slavery to catch-words, than to abuse or think ill of
any particular class of men, only by reason of their profession-
although, perhaps, we might justly throw the burden of proving
their merit upon hangmen, body-snatchers, informers, and a few
others—yet may we think (deprecating most humbly the omen of
this conjunction) that solicitors, tailors, and Methodist parsons fight
at some disadvantage both in fact and in fiction? Yet can they
hold their own; and sympathy, if owing, is sure to have to pay
them-notwithstanding, goose, and amen.
Away with all feeble flippancy! Heavy tidings came to Nowel-
hurst Hall, Dell Cottage, and Geopharmacy Lodge simultaneously,
as might be, on the 20th of June. The Taprobane had been lost,
with every soul on board ; and this is the record of it, enshrined in
many journals :-
By recent advices from Capetown, per the screw-steamer Sutler,
we sincerely regret to learn that the magnificent clipper-built ship
Taprobane, of 2200 tons (new system), A 1 at Lloyd's for 15 years,
and bound from the Thames to Colombo, with a cargo valued by
competent judges at 120,000l., took the shore in Benguela Bay
during a typhoon of unprecedented destructiveness.
It is our
melancholy duty to add that the entirety of the valuable cargo was
entirely lost, although very amply assured in unexceptionable
quarters, and that every soul on board was consigned to a watery
grave. A Portuguese gentleman of good family and large fortune,
who happened to be in the neighbourhood, was an eye-witness to
the catastiophe, and made superhuman exertions to rescue the
unfortunate mariners, but, alas ! in vain. Senhor José de Calcavello
has arrived at the conclusion that some of her copper may be saved.
The ill-fated bark broke up so rapidly, from the powerful action of
the billows, that her identity could only be established from a por-
tion of her sternpost, which was discovered half buried in sand three
nautical miles to the southward. We have been informed, upon
good authority, although we are not at liberty to mention our source
of information, that Her Britannic Majesty's steam-corvette Mumbo
Jumbo, pierced for twenty-eight guns, and carrying two, is under
orders to depart, as soon as ever she can be coaled, for the scene of
the recent catastrophe. Meanwhile, the tug Growler has arrived
with all the memorials of the calamity, after affording the rights of
sepulture to the poor shipwrecked mariners cast up by the treacherous
billows. The set of the current being so adverse, we have reason to
fear that the rest of the bodies must have fallen a prey to the

»
monsters of the deep. But sanguine hopes are entertained of
recovering much of the specie.”
Mrs. Corklemore happened to be calling at Geopharmacy Lodge,
when the London papers arrived in the early afternoon. Rufus
begged pardon, and broke the cover, to see something in which he
was interested. Presently he cried, “Good God !" and let the
paper fall ; and, seasoned as he was, and shallowed by the shifting
of his life, it was not in his power to keep two little tears from
twinkling.
“ Too late all my work," he said ; “ Heaven has settled it with-
out me.”
“How very sad !" cried Mrs. Corklemore, dashing aside an
unbidden tear, when she came to the end of the story ; "to think of
all those brave men lost! And perhaps you knew some of them,
Dr. Hutton ? Oh, I am so sorry!”.
“Why, surely you know that the Taprobane was the ship in
which
poor Cradock Nowell sailed, under Mr. Rosedew's auspices ?”
Oh, I hope not. Please not to say so.
It would be so very
horrible! That he should go without repenting-
“You must have forgotten, Mrs. Corklemore ; for I heard Rosa
tell you the name of the ship, and her destination.”
“Oh, very likely. Ah, now I remember. For the moment it
quite escaped me. How truly, truly grieved—it has quite overcome
me. Oh, please not to notice me -please not. I am so stupidly soft-
hearted. I shall have no relations left. Oh-ea, isha, isha, ea !”
No woman in the world could cry more beautifully than poor
Georgie. And now she cried her very best. It would have gone to
the heart of the dryest and bitterest sceptic that ever doubted all
men and women because they would doubt him. But Rufus, whose
form of self-assertion was not universal negation, in what manner
then do you suppose that Rufus Hutton was liquefied? A simple
sort of fellow he was (notwithstanding all his shrewdness), although,
or perhaps one might say because, he thought himself so knowing ;
and his observation was more the result of experience than the
cause of it. So away he ran to fetch Rosa, and Rosa wiped dear
sensitive Georgie's eyes, and coaxed her very pleasantly, and
admired her more than ever.
Bull Garnet rode home at twelve o'clock from a long morning's
work. He never could eat any breakfast now, and his manner was
to leave home at six (except when he went to Winchester), gallop
fiercely from work to work, or sometimes walk his horse and think,
often with glistening eyes (when any little thing touched him), and
return to his cottage and rest there during the workmen's dinner-
time. Then he had some sort of a meal himself, which Pearl began
to call “ dinner," and away with a fresh horse in half an hour,
spending his body if only so he might earn rest of mind. All this
was telling upon him fearfully ; even his muscular force was going,

and his quickness of eye and hand failing him. He knew it, and
was glad.
Only none should ever say, though every crime was heaped upon
him, that he had neglected the interests of his master.
He tore the morning journal open in his sudden turbulent fashion,
as if all paper was rags, and no more ; and with one glance at each
column knew all that was in the 'tween-ways. Suddenly he came to
a place at the corner of a page which made him cease from eating.
He glanced at Pearl, but she was busy, peeling new potatoes for
him. Bob was not come in yet.
Darling, I must go to London. If possible I shall return to-
night, if I catch the one o'clock up express."
Then he opened the window, and ordered a horse, his loud voice
ringing and echoing round every corner of the cottage, and in five
minutes he was off at full gallop, for the express would not stop at
Brockenhurst.
At 3.15 he was in London, and at 3.40 in the counting-house of
Messrs. Brown and Smithson, owners, or at any rate charterers, of
the Taprobane, Striped-ball Chambers, Fenchurch Street. There
he would learn, if he could, what their private advices were.
The clerks received him very politely, and told him that they had
little doubt of the truth of the evil tidings. Of course the fatality
might have been considerably exaggerated, &c., &c., but as to the
loss of the ship, they had taken measures to replace her. Would he
mind waiting only ten minutes, though they saw that he was in a
hurry? The Cape mail-ship had been telegraphed from Falmouth;
they had sent to the office already, and expected to get the reply
within a quarter of an hour. Every information in their power, &c.
-we all know the form, though we don't always get the civility.
Bull Garnet waited heavily with his great back against a stout
brass rail, having declined the chair they offered him; and in less
than five minutes he received authentic detail of everything. He
listened to nothing except one statement, “every soul on board was
lost, sir."
Then he went out, in a lumpish manner, from the noble room,
and was glad to get hold of the iron rail in the bend of the dark
stone staircase.
So now he was a double murderer. Finding it not enough to
have killed one brother in his fury, he had slain the other twin
through his cowardly concealment. Floating about in tropical
slime, without a shark to eat him, leaving behind him the fair
repute of a money-grabbing fratricide. And he, the man who had
done it all, who had loved the boy and ruined him, miserably
plotting for his own far inferior children.
No, no! Not that at any rate,-good and noble children: and
how they had borne his villainy! God in mercy only make him, try
to make him, over again, and how different his life would be. All

his better part brought out; all his lower kicked away to the devil,
the responsible father of it. “Good God, how my heart goes !
Death is upon ine, well I know, but let me die with my children by
-unless I turn hymn-writer”-
Quick as he was in his turns of thought-all of them subjective-
he was scarcely a match for the situation, when Mr. Chope and
Bailey Kettledrum brushed by the sleeves of his light overcoat, and
entered the doors with “push-pull” on them, but, being both oi
the pushing order rather than the pulling, employed indiscriminate
propulsion, and were out of sight in a moment. Still, retaining
some little of his circumspective powers, Bull Garnet knew them
both from a corner flash of his sad tear-laden eyes. There was no
mistaking that great legal head, like the breech-end of a cannon.
Mr. Kettledrum might have been overlooked, for little men of a
fussy nature are common enough in London, or for that matter
everywhere. But Garnet's attention being drawn, he knew them
both of course, and the errand they were come upon, and how soon
they were likely to return, and what they would think of his being
there, if they should happen to see him. Nevertheless, he would
not budge. Nothing could matter so very much now.
He must
think out his thoughts.
When this puff of air should pass which some men breathe almost
long enough to learn that it was “life," some so long as to weary of
it, none so long as to comprehend its littleness and greatness—when
that should be gone from him, and absorbed into a boundless desert
even more unknown, would not the wrong go with it, if left in this
world unatoned, and abide in the other world evermore? And not
to think of himself alone-what an example now to leave to his
innocent injured children! The fury hidden by treachery, the
cowardice washed by penitence !
His mind was made up to no more of it. His cursed mind was
made up now. A man can die in the flesh but once.
His spirit
had been dying daily, going to the devil daily, every day for weeks
and months ; and no place found for repentance. As for his
children, they must abide it. No man of any mind would blame
them for their father's crime. If it was more than they could bear,
let them bolt to America. Any whither, any where, so long as they
came home in heaven-if he could only get there—to the father who
had injured, ruined, bullied, cursed, and loved them so.
After burning out this hell of thought in his miserable brain, he
betook himself to nature's remedy,-instant, headlong action. He
rushed down the stairs, forgetting all about Chope and Bailey
Kettledrum, shouted to the driver of a hansom cab so that he sawed
his horse's mouth raw, leaped in, and gave him half a sovereign
through the pigeon-hole, to get to D 's bank before the closing
time. But at Temple Bar, of course, there was a regular Chubb's
lock, after a minor Bramah one at the bottom of Ludgate Hill.

Cabby was forced to cut it, and slash up Chancery Lane, and across
by King's College Hospital, and back into the Strand by Wych
Street.
It is easy to imagine Mr. Garnet's state of mind; yet the imagi-
nation would be that, and nothing more. He sat quite calmly,
without a word, knowing that man and horse were doing their
utmost of skill and speed, and having dealt enough with both to
know that to worry them then is waste.
The Bank had been closed, the day-porter said, as he girded him-
self for his walk to Brixton, exactly- let him see-yes, exactly one
minute and thirty-five seconds ago. Most of the gentlemen were
still inside, of course, and if the gentleman's business was of a con-
fidential Here he intimated, not by words, that there were
considerations-
“ Bow Street police office," Mr. Garnet cried to the driver, not
even glancing again at the disappointed doorkeeper. In three
minutes he was there. Man and horse seemed strung and nerved
with his own excitement.
A stolid policeman stood at the door, as Bull Garnet leaped out
anyhow, with his high colour gone away as in death, and his strong
legs cramped with vehemence. Then Bobby saw that he had met
his master, the perception being a mental feat far beyond the
average leap of police agility. Accordingly he touched his hat, and
crinkled his eyes in a manner discovered by policemen, in conse-
quence of the suggestion afforded by the pegging of their hats.
“Mr. Bennings gone?” asked Bull Garnet, pushing towards the
entrance.
“ His wusship is gone arf an hour, sir; or may be at most fifty
minutes. Can we do anything for you, sir? His wusship always
go according to the business as is on."
“Thank you," replied Mr. Garnet ; " that is quite enough. What
time do they leave at Marlborough Street ?”
According to the business, sir, but gone afore us aʼmost always,
We sits as long as anybody, and gets through twice the business.
But any message you like to leave, or anything to be entered, I can
take the responsibility."
6 No. It does not matter. I will only leave my card. Mr.
Bennings knows me. Be kind enough to give him this, when he
comes to-morrow morning. Perhaps I may call to-morrow. At
present I cannot say.”
The policeman lifted his hat again, like a cup taken up from a
saucer, and Bull Garnet sat heavily down in the cab, and banged
the door-shutters before him. rand," he called out to the
driver ; “D and C-'s, the watchmakers." There he bought
a beautiful watch and gold chain for his daughter Pearl, giving a
cheque for nearly all his balance at the banker's. The cheque was
so large that in common prudence the foreman declined to cash it

without some confirmation; but Mr. Garnet gave him a reference,
which in ten minutes was established, and in ten more he was oft
again with his very handsome trinkets, and a large sum in bank-
notes and gold, the balance of his draft.
“Where now, sir?" shouted the driver, delighted with his fare,
and foreseeing another half-sovereign.
“I will tell you in thirty seconds."
Well, if he ain't a rum ’un," Cabby muttered to himself, while
amid volleys of strong language he kept his horse gyrating, like a
twin-screw ship trying circles ; “but rum customers is our windfalls.
Should have thought it a reward case, only for the Bobby. Keep a
look-out, any how ; unless he orders me back to Bedlam.”
“Not Bedlam. Waterloo Station, main line !” said Bull Garnet,
standing up in front, and looking at him over the roof. “Fivé
minutes is all I give you, mind.”
“What a blessed fool I am,” said the cabman below his breath,
but lashing his horse explosively, “to throw away half a sovereign
sooner than hold my tongue! He must be the devil himself to have
heard me—and as for eyes-good Lord, I shouldn't like to drive
him much.”
“You are wrong,” replied Mr. Garnet through the pigeon-hole,
handing him twopence for the tollman ; " I am not the devil, sir, as
you may some day know. Have no fear of ever driving me again.
You shall have your half-sovereign when I have got my ticket.
Follow me in, and you shall know for what place I take it.”
The cabman was too dumb-foundered to do anything but resolve
that he would go straight home when he got his money, and tell his
old woman about it. Then he applied himself to the whip in
earnest, for he could not too soon be rid of this job; and so Bull
Garnet won his train, and gave the driver the other half-sovereign,
with a peculiar nod, having noticed that he feared to approach while
the ticket was applied for.
Bull Garnet took a second-class ticket. His extravagance towards
the cabman was the last he would ever exhibit. He felt a call upon
him now to save for his family every farthing. All was lost to them
but money, and alas, how much was lost of that! Now if he cut his
throat in the train, could he be attainted of felony? And would God
be any the harder on him ? No, he did not think He would. It
might be some sort of atonement even. But then the shock to Pearl
and Bob, to see him brought home with his head hanging back, and
hopeless red stitches under it. It would make the poor girl a maniac,
after all the shocks and anguish he had benumbed her with already.
What a fool he had been not to buy strychnine, prussic acid, or
laudanum! And yet-and yet—and yet He would like to see
them just once more-blessed hearts-just to say “good-bye.”
He sat in the last compartment of the last carriage in the train,
which had been added, in a hurry, immediately behind the break-

429
van, and the swinging and the jerking very soon became tremendous.
He knew not, neither cared to know, that Simon Chope and Bailey
Kettledrum were in a first-class carriage towards the middle of the
train. Presently the violent motion began to tell upon him, and he
felt a heavy dulness creeping over his fiercely-excited mind; and all
the senses, which had been during several hours of tension as
prompt and acute as ever they were in his prime of power, began to
flag, and daze, and wane, and seem to belong to some one else ;
until at last he fell into a waking dream of trouble, a loose imper-
sonality fitting over all he saw, or felt, or tried to think of.
But first—whether for suicide, or for self-defence, he had tried
both doors and found them locked ; and he was far too large a man
to force his way through the window.
He dreamed (without knowing dream from memory) of the simple
and trustful childhood, the boyhood's aspiration, the young man's
sense of ability confirming the right to aspire. Even his bodily
power and vigour revived in the dream before him, and he knitted his
muscles, and clenched his fists,and was ready to fight fools and liars.
Who had fought more hard and hotly against the hard cold ways
of the age, the despite done to the poor and lowly, the sarcasm bred
by self-conscious serfdom in clever men of the world, the preference
of gold to love, and of position to happiness? All the weak grega-
rious tricks, shifts of coat, and pupa-ism, whereby we noble Chris-
tians reduce our social history to a passage in entomology, and
quench the faith of thinking men in Him whose name we take in
vain—the great Originator-all these feminine contradictions, and
fond things foully invented, fables Atellan (if they be not actually
Fescennine) had roused the combatism of young Bull, ere ever he
learned his own disgrace.
And when he learned it, such as it was—a proof, by its false
incidence, how infantile our civilization is--all his mother's bitter
wrong, her lifelong sense of shame and crushing (because she had
trusted a liar, and the hollow elder-stick “institution
was held
up
against her, and none would take her part without money, even if
she had wished it)—then he had chosen his mother's course, in-
heriting her strong nature, let the shame lie where it fell by right
and not by rule, and carried all his energies into Neo-Christian
largeness.
All that time of angry trial now was passing before him, and the
five years of his married life (which had not been very happy, for
his wife never understood him, but met his quick moodiness with
soft sulks); and then in his dream-review he smiled, as his children
began to toddle about, and sit on his knees, and look at him.
Once he awoke, and gazed about him. The train had stopped at
Winchester. He was all alone in the carriage still, and all his cash
was safe. He had stowed it away very carefully in a hidden pocket.
To his languid surprise, he fell back on the seat. How unlike him-

self, to be sure ; and with so much yet to do! He strove to arise
and rouse himself. He felt for the little flask of wine, which Pearl
had thrust into his pocket, but he could not pull it out and drink;
such a languor lay upon him.
This strange weakness had touched him before ; but never before
had vanquished him. Once or twice, an hour or so before the
rising of the sun, this deep, silent, deathlike chill (like a mammoth
nightmare frozen) had lain on him, in his lonely bed, and gone to
his heart, and spread over him ; and then he felt what death was,
and only came back to life again through cold sweat and long
fainting.
He had never consulted any doctor about the meaning of this.
With his bold way of thinking, and judging only by his own expe-
rience and feeling, he had long ago decided that all medical men
were quacks. What one disorder could they cure ? All they had
learned, and that by a fluke, was a way to anticipate small-pox :
and even that way had been over-trodden.
Now he fell away, and feared, and tried to fold hands upon breast,
and tried to pray to God; but no words came, nor any thoughts,
only sense of dying, and horror at having prayed for it. A coldness
fell upon his heart, and on his brain an ignorance ; he was falling
into a great blank depth, and nothing belonged to him any more-
only utter, utter loss, and not a chance of heaven.
Happy and religious folk, who have only died in theory, contem-
plating distant Death, knowing him only as opportune among kins-
folk owning Consols, these may hope for a Prayer-book end, sacra-
ment administered, weeping friends, the heavenward soul glad to
fly through the golden door, animula, vagula, blandula, yet assured
of its reception with a heavenly smile of foretaste-this may be ;
no doubt it may be, after the life of a Christian Bayard ; though it
need not always be, even with so pure a spirit.
All we who from our age know death, and have taken little trips
into him, through fits, paralysis, or such-like, are quite aware that
he has at first call as much variety as life has. But the death of
the violent man is not likely to be placid, unless it come unforeseen,
or has been filtred through years of remorse, weakness, weariness,
and repentance.
At last, Bull Garnet tried to rise, and fought once more, with the
agony of athletic life, against the heavy yet hollow numbness in the
hold of his deep wide chest, against the dark, cold stealth of death,
and the black and bottomless depth of the grave.
The train ran lightly and merrily into Brockenhurst Station,
while the midsummer twilight floated around, like universal gossa-
mer. In the yard stood the Kettledrum “rattletrap," and the
owner was right glad to see it. To his eyes it was worth a dozen
of the carriages from Nowelhurst.

“None of the children come, dear?” asked Bailey, having kissed
his wife, as behoves a man from London.
“No, darling, not one. That _” here she used an adjective
which sounded too much like “odious” for any man to trust his
ears—“Georgie would not allow them. Now, darling, did you do
exactly what I told you ?”
Yes, darling Anna, I followed your directions, as far as ever I
could. I had a basin of mulligatawny at Waterloo going up, and
one of muck-turtle coming back, and at Basingstoke ham-sand-
wiches, a glass of cold cognac and water, and some lemon-chips.
Since that, nothing at all, because there has been no time.”
“You are a dear,” said Mrs. Kettledrum,“to do exactly as I told
you. Now come round the corner a moment, and take two glasses
of sherry; I can see quite well to pour it out. I am so glad of her
new crinoline. She won't get out. Don't be afraid, dear.”
Oh, Georgie, Georgie! To think that her own sister should be
so low, so unfeeling, and treacherous! Mr. Kettledrum sınacked
his lips, for the sake of euphony, after the second glass of sherry;
but his wife would not give him any more, for fear of spoiling his
supper. Then they came back, and both got in, and squeezed
themselves up together in the front seat of the old carriage, for
Mrs. Corklemore occupied the whole of the seat of honour.
“You are very polite, to keep me so long. Innocent turtles ;
sweet childish anxiety! The last survivor of a wrecked train ! So
you took advantage, Anna dear, of my not being dressed quite so
vulgarly as you are, to discuss this little matter with him, keeping
me in ignorance."
The carriage was off by this time, and open as it was, they had
no fear of old coachey hearing, for it took a loud hail to reach
him.
“ Take the honour of a Kettledrum, cried Bailey, smiting his
bosom,“ that the subject has not even been broached between my
wiser part and myself. Ladies, in this pure aerial-no, I mean
ethereal-air, with the shades of night around us, and the breezes
wafting, would an exceedingly choice and delicately aromatic
cigar-
Oh, I should so like it, Bailey; and perhaps we shall have the
nightingales.”
“I fear we must not think of it," interposed Mrs. Corklemore,
gently; "my dress is of a fabric quite newly introduced, very beau-
tiful, but (like myself) too retentive of impressions. If Mr. Kettle-
drum smokes, I shall have to throw it away.”
“There goes the cigar instead,” cried Bailey; "the paramount
rights of ladies ever have been, and ever shall be, sacred with
Bailey Kettledrum."
But Mrs. Kettledrum was so vexed that she jumped up, as if to
watch the cigar spinning into the darkness, and contrived with

sisterly accuracy to throw all her weight upon a certain portion of
a certain lovely foot ; whereupon there ensued the neatest little
passes, into which we need not enter. Enough that Mrs. Corkle-
inore, having higher intellectual gifts," won," in the language of the
ring, “ both events”—first tear, and first hysterical symptom.
Come,” cried Mr. Kettledrum, at the very first opportunity, to
wit, when both were crying ; we all know what sisters are : how
they mingle the—the dulcet sensitiveness of affection with a certain
--ah, yes—a piquancy of expression, most pleasant, most improving,
because so highly conducive to self-examination !” Here he stood
up, having made a hit, worthy of the House of Commons. “All
these little breezes, ladies, may be called the trade-winds of affec-
tion. They blow from pole to pole,”-
“The trade-winds never do that,” said Georgie.
They pass us by as the idle wind, when the clouds are like a
whale, ladies, having overcome us for a moment, like a summer
dream. Hark to that thrush, sitting perhaps on his eggs”—“Oh,
Oh !” from the gallery of nature can there be, I pause for a
reply, anything but harmony, where the voices of the night pervade,
and the tranquil melody of the spheres ?”
“You-you do speak so splendidly, dear," sobbed Mrs. Kettle-
drum from the corner ; " but it is a nasty, wicked, cruel story, about
dear papa saying that of me, and he in his grave, poor dear, quite
unable to vindicate himself. I have always thought it so unchristian
to malign the dead !"
“ What's that?” cried Georgie, starting up, in fear and hot earnest;
you are chattering so, you hear nothing."
A horse dashed by them at full gallop, with his rider on his neck,
shouting and yelling, and clinging and lashing.
“Missed the wheel by an inch,” cried Kettledrum, drawing his
head in faster than he had thrust it out; "a fire, man, or a French
invasion ?” But the man was out of hearing, while the Kettledrum
horses, scared, and jumping as from an equine thunderbolt, tried
the strength of leather and the courage of ladies.
Meanwhile, at the station behind them, there was a sad ado. A
man was lifted out of the train, being found in the last compartment
by the guard who knew his destination-a big man, and a heavy
one ; and they bore him to the wretched shed labelled, “ First-
Class Waiting-room.”
“ Dead, I believe," said the guard, having sent a boy for brandy;
“ dead as a door-nail, whoever he be.”
Not thee knaw who he be ?” cried a forester, coming in, “Whoy,
marn, there be no mistaking he. He be our Muster Garnet.”
“Whew!” And the train whistled on, as it must do, whether we
live or die, or whether itself has made mincemeat of us.

CHAPTER LXII.
WHO CAN FIGHT FOR EVER?
That night there had been great excitement in the village of
Nowelhurst. A rumour had reached it that Cradock Nowell, loved
in every cottage there, partly as their own production, partly as
their future owner, partly for his own sake, and most of all for his
misfortunes, was thrown into prison, to stand his trial for the
murder of his brother. Another rumour was that, to prevent any
scandal to the nobility, he had been sent to sea alone in a seventy-
four gun ship, with corks in her bottom tied with wire arranged so
as to fly all at once, same as if it was ginger-beer bottles, on the
seventh day, when the salt-water had turned the wires rusty.
It is hard to say of these two reports which roused the greater
indignation ; perhaps on the whole the former did, because the
latter was supposed to be according to institution. Anyhow, all
the village was out in the street that night; and the folding of arms,
and the self-importance, the confidential winks, and the power to
say more (but for hyper-Nestorean prudence) were at their acme in
a knot of gaffers gathered around Rufus Hutton, and affording him
good sport.
Nothing now could be done in Nowelhurst without Rufus Hutton.
He had that especial knack (mistaken sometimes in a statesman
for grand administrative power) which becomes in a woman fine
capacity for gossip. By virtue thereof Rufus Hutton was now prime-
minister of Nowelhurst ; and Sir Cradock, the king, being nothing
more now than the shadow of a name, his deputy's power was
absolute. He knew the history by this time of every cottage, and
pigsty, and tombstone in the churchyard; how much every man got
every week, and how much he gave his wife out of it, what he had
for dinner on Sundays, and how long he made his waistcoat last.
Suddenly the double-barrelled noise which foreruns a horse at full
gallop came from the bridge, and old folk hobbled, and young got
ready to run away.
“ Hooraw—hooraw!” cried a dozen and a half of boys, “here
be Hempror o' Roosia coming."
Boys will believe almost anything, when they get excited (having
taken the trick from their fathers), but even the women were
disappointed, when the galloping horse stopped short in the crowd,
and from his withers shot forward, and fell with both hands full of
mane, a personage not more august than the porter at Brockenhurst
Station.
“ Catch the horse, you fool !” cried Rufus.

CRADOCK NOWELL,
“Cuss the horse," said the porter, trying to draw breath;
: "better
been under a train, I had. Don't stand gaping, chawbacons. Is
ever a saw-bones, surgeon, doctor, or what the devil you call them
in these outlandish parts, to be got for love or money ?”
"I am a sawbones,” said Rufus Hutton, coming forward with his
utmost dignity ; “and it's a mercy I don't saw yours, young man,
if that's all you know of riding."
The porter touched his hair instead of his hat (which was gone
long ago), while the “chawbacons" rallied, and laughed at him,
and one offered him a “zide-zaddle,” and all the women of the
village felt that Dr. Hutton had quenched the porter, and vindicated
Nowelhurst.
"When you have recovered your breath, young man," continued
Rufus, pushing, as he always did, his advantage; "and thanked
God for your escape from the first horse you ever mounted, perhaps
you will tell us your errand, and we chawbacons will consider it.”
A gruff haw-haw and some treble he-he's added to the porter's
discomfiture, for he could not come to time yet, being now in the
second tense of exhaustion, which is even worse than the first, being
rather of the heart than lungs.
“ Station-Mr. Garnet-dead !” was all the man could utter, and
that only in spasms, and with great chest-heavings.
Rufus Hutton leaped on the horse in a moment, caught up old
Channing's stick, and was out of sight in the summer dusk ere
any one else in the crowd had done more than gape, and say, "Oh
Lor!” By dint of skill he sped the old horse nearly as quickly to
the station as the fury of Jehu had brought him thence, and landed
him at the door with far less sign of exhaustion. Then walking
into the little room, in the manner of a man who thoroughly
knows his work, he saw a sight which never in this world will
leave him.
Upon a hard sofa, shored up with an ash-log where the mahogany
was sprung, and poked up into a corner as if to get a bearing
there, with blankets piled upon him heavily and tucked round the
collar of his coat, and his great head hanging over the rise where
the beading of the brass ends, lay the ill-fated Bull Garnet,-a man
from birth to death a subject for pity more than terror. Fifty years
old—more than fifty years—and scarce a twelvemonth of happiness
since the shakings of the world began, and childhood's dream was .
over. Toiling ever for the future, toiling for his children, ever
since he had them, labouring to make peace with God, if only he
might have his own, where passion is not, but love abides. The
room smelled strongly of bad brandy, some of which was oozing
now down his broad square chin, and dripping from the great blue
jaw. Of course he could not swallow it ; and now one of the women
(for three had rushed in) was performing that duty for him.
“ Turn out that drunken hag !" cried Dr. Hutton, feeling he had

435
no idea how. “ Up with the window. Bring the sofa here ; and
take all but one of those blankets off.”
“ But, master," objected another woman, “he'll take his death of
cold.”
“ Turn out that woman also !" He was instantly obeyed. “Now
roll up one of those blankets, and put it under his head here—this
side, can't you see? Good God, what a set of fellows you are to
let a man's head hang down like that! Hot water and a sponge
this instant. Nearly boiling, mind you. Plenty of it, and a foot-
tub. Now don't stare at me.
With a quick light hand he released the blue and turgid throat
from the narrow necktie, then laid his forefinger upon the heart and
watched the eyelids intently.
Appleplexy, no doubt, master," said the most intelligent of the
men ; "I have 'eared that if you can bleed them-
“Hold your tongue, or I'll phlebotomize you." That big word
inspired universal confidence, because no one understood it. “Now,
support him in that position, while I pull his boots off. One of you
run to the inn for a bottle of French cognac-not this filthy stuff,
mind -- and a corkscrew and a teaspoon. Now the hot water
here! In with his feet, and bathe his legs, while I sponge his face
and chest-as hot as you can bear your hands in it. His heart is
all but stopped, and his skin as cold as ice. That's it ; quicker
yet! Don't be afraid of scalding him. There, he begins to feel it."
The dying man's great heavy eyelids slowly and feebly quivered,
and a long deep sigh arose, but there was not strength to fetch it.
Dr. Hutton took advantage of the faint impulse of life to give him a
little brandy, and then a little more again, and by that time he could
sigh.
Bo," he whispered very softly, and trying to lift his hand for
something, and Rufus Hutton knew somehow (perhaps by means of
his own child) that he was trying to say “Bob.”
“Bob will be here directly. Cheer up, cheer up, till he comes,
He called him his friend, and the very next day he would have
denounced him as murderer to the magistrates at Lymington. Now
his only thought was of saving the poor man's life.
The father's dull eyes gleamed again when he heard those words,
and a little smile came fickering over the stern lines of his face.
They gave him more brandy on the strength of it, while he kept
on looking at the door.
Rub, rub, rub, men ; very lightly, but very quickly. Keep your
thumbs up, don't you see? Mustn't get cold again for the world.
There now, he'll keep his heart up until his dear son arrives. And
then his children shall nurse him, much better than any one else
could ; and how glad they will be, John Thomas, to see him looking
so well and so strong again !"

CRADOCK NOWELI..
All this time, Rue Hutton himself, with a woman's skill and
tenderness, was encouraging, by gentle friction over the stagnant
heart, each feeble impulse yet to live, each little bubble faintly
rising from the well of hope, every clinging of the soul to the things
so hard to leave behind. “While there is life, there is hope." True
and genial saving! And we hope there is hope beyond it.
Poor Bull Garnet was taken home, even that very night. For
Dr. Hutton saw how much he was longing for his children, who
(until he was carried in) knew nothing of his danger. “Please God,”
said Rufus to himself, as he crouched in the fly by the narrow
mattress, even foregoing his loved cheroot, and keeping his hand
on his patient's pulse ; “ please God, the poor fellow shall breathe
his last with a child at either side of him."
Meanwhile, an urgent message from Sir Cradock Nowell was
awaiting the sick man at his cottage. Eöa herself had brought
word to Pearl (of whom she longed to make a friend) that her
uncle was walking about the house, perpetually walking, calling
aloud in every room for Mr. Garnet and John Rosedew. He had
heard of no disaster, any more than she had, for he seldom read
the papers now; but Mr. Brockwood had been with him a very
long time that morning, and Dr. Buller came in accidentally ; and
Eöa could almost vow that there was some infamous scheme on
foot, and she knew whose doing it was; and oh that Uncle John
would come back! But now they wanted Mr. Garnet, and he must
hurry up to the Hall the moment he came home.
Mr. Garnet, of course, they could not have: his soul was wrecked,
his heart benumbed, his mind incapable of effort, except to know
his children, if that could ever be one. And in this paralytic state,
never sleeping, never waking, never wholly conscious, he lay for
weeks; and time for him had neither night nor morning.
Mr. Rosedew could be brought to help his ancier friend,
if only it was in his power to overlook the injury. He did not overlook
it. For that he was too great a man. He utterly forgot it. To his
mind it was thenceforth a thing that had never happened :-
“To-morrow, either with black cloud
Let the Father fill the heaven,
Or with crystal sunshine:
Yet shall He not erase the past,
Nor beat abroad, and make undone,
What once the fleeting hour hath borne.”
Truly so our Horace saith. And yet that Father gives, some-
times, to the noblest of His children, power to revoke the evil, or at
least annul it,-grandeur to undo the wrong done by others to them.
Not with any sense of greatness, neither hope of self-reward,
simply from the loving-kindness of the deep humanity.

In truth it was a noble thing, such as not even the dryest man,
sapped and carked with care and evil, worn with undeserved rebuff,
and dwelling ever underground, in the undermining of his faith,
could behold and not be glad with a joy unbidden, could turn away
from without wet eyes, and a glimpse of the God who loves us,
and yet the simplest, mildest scene that a child could describe to
its mother. So let me tell it, if may be, casting all long words
away, leaning on an old man's staff, looking over the stile of
the world.
It was the height of the summer-time, and the quiet mood of
the setting sun touched with calm and happy sadness all he was
forsaking. Men were going home from work; wives were looking
for them ; maidens by the gate or paling longed for some pro-
tection ; children must be put to bed, and what a shame, so early !
Puce and purple pillows lay, holding golden locks of sun, piled and
lifted by light breezes, the painted eider-down of sunset. In the
air a feeling was—those who breathe it cannot tell-only this, that
it does them good ; God knows how, and why, and whence—but it
makes them love their brethren.
The poor old man, more tried and troubled than a lucky labourer,
wretched in his wealth, worse hampered by his rank and place-
ment, sat upon a high oak chair—for now be feared to lean his head
back-and prayed for some one to help him. Oh, for any one who
loved him ; oh, for any glimpse of God, whom in his pride he had
forgotten! Eöa was a darling, his only comfort now; but what
could such a girl do? Who was she to meet the world? And the
son he had used so shamefully. His own, and now his only son !
And now he knew, with some strange knowledge, loose and wide, and
wandering, that his son was innocent after all, and lost to him for
ever, through his own vile cruelty. And now they meant to prove
him mad—what use to disguise it ?-him who once had the clearest
head, chairman of the Quarter Sessions-
Here he broke down, and lay back, with his white hair poured
against the black and carven oak of the chair, and his wasted hands
fung downward, only praying God to help him, anyhow to help him,
now that all men were against him so.
Then John Rosedew came in softly, half ashamed of himself, half
nervous lest he were presuming, overdrawing the chords of youth,
the bond of the days when they went about with arm round the
neck of each other. In his heart was pity, very deep and holy;
and yet, of all that filled his eyes, the very last to show itself.
Over against the ancient friend, the loved one of his boyhood, he
stopped and sadly gazed for a moment, and then drew back with a
shock and sorrow, as of death brought nearer. At the sound, Sir
Cradock Nowell lifted his weary eyes and sighed; and then he
looked intently ; and then he knew the honest face, the smile, the
gentle forehead. Quietly he arose, with colour flowing over his

and a
pallid cheeks, and in his eyes strong welcome, and ready with his
lips to speak, yet in his heart unable. Thereupon he held the chair,
and bowed with the deepest reverence, such as king or queen
receives not, till a life has earned it. Even the hand which he was
raising he let fall again, drawn back by a bitter memory,
fudden spasm of shame.
But his friend of olden time would not have him so disgraced,
wanted no repentance. With years of kindness in his eyes and the
amnesty of ancient love, he came, without a bow, and took the
hand that now was shy of him.
Cradock, oh, I am so glad.”
“John, thank God for this, John !"
Then they turned to other subjects, with a sort of nervousness-
the one for fear of presuming on pardon, the other for fear of
offering it. Only both knew, once for all, that nothing more could
come between them till the hour of death.
The rector accepted once again his well-beloved home and cares,
for the vacancy had not been filled, only Mr. Pell had lived a short
time at the Rectory. The joy of all the parish equalled, if it could
not well surpass, the joy of parson and of patron.
And, over and above the ease of conscience, and the sense of
comfort, it was a truly happy thing for poor Sir Cradock Nowell,
when the loss of the Taprobane could no longer be concealed from
him, that now he had the proven friend once more to fall back
upon. He had spent whole days in writing letters-humble,
loving, imploring letters to the son in unknown latitudes-directing
them as fancy took him to the Cape, to Port Natal, Mozambique,
or even Bombay (in case of stress of weather), Point de Galle,
Colombo, &c., &c., in all cases to be called for, and invariably
marked "
urgent." Then from this labour of love he awoke to a
vague sort of conviction that his letters ought to have been addressed
to the bottom of the ocean.
CHAPTER LXIII.
DEATH,
AUTUMN in the Forest now, once again the autumn. All things
turning to their rest, bird, and beast, and vegetable. Solemn and
most noble season, speaking to the soul of man, as spring speaks to
his body. The harvest of the ample woods spreading every tint of
ripeness, waiting for the Maker's sickle, when His breath is frost.

Trees beyond trees, in depth and height, roundings and massive
juttings, some admitting flaws of light to enhance their mellowness,
some very bright of their own accord, when the sun thought well of
them, others scarcely bronzed with age, and meaning to abide the
spring. It was the same in Epping Forest, Richmond Park, and
the woods round London, only on a smaller scale, and with less
variety.
And so upon his northern road, every coppice, near or far, even
“Knockholt Beeches” (which reminded him of the “beechen hats”),
every little winding wood of Sussex or of Surrey brought before
Cradock Nowell's eyes the prospect of his boyhood. He had
begged to be put ashore at Newhaven, from the American trader,
which had rescued him from Pomona Island, and his lonely but
healthful sojourn, and then borne him to New York. Now, with
his little store of dollars, earned from the noble Yankee skipper by
the service he had rendered him (freely given and freely taken, as
behoves two gentlemen), and with great store of health recovered,
and recovered mind, he was walking all the way to London, fifty
miles or may be more ; so great a desire entered into him of his
native English land, that stable versatility, those free and ever-
changing skies, which all her sons abuse and love.
Cradock looked, let us assure you, as well, and strong, and stout,
and lusty, as may consist with elegance at the age of two-and-
twenty. And his dress, though smacking of Broadway, “could not
conceal,” as our best writers say, “his symmetrical proportions."
His pantaloons were of a fine bright tan colour, with pockets fit for
a thousand dollars, and his boots full of eyelets, like big lampreys,
and his coat was a thing to be proud of, and a pleasing surprise for
Regent-street. His hat, moreover, was umbratile, as of the Pilgrim
Fathers, with a measure of liquid capacity (betwixt the cone and the
turned-up rim) superior to that of the ordinary cisterns of the
London water-companies. Nevertheless he had not acquired the
delightful hydropultic art, distinctive of the mighty nation which
had been so kind to him. And, in spite of little external stuff (only
worthy of two glances-one to note, and the other to smile at it),
the youth was improved in every point worth a man's observation.
Three months in New York had done him an enormous deal of
good; not that the place is by any means heavenly (perhaps there
are few more hellish), only that he fell in with men of extraordinary
energy and of marvellous decision, the very two hinges of life where-
upon he (being rather too “philosophical”) had several screws
loose, and some rust in the joints.
As for Wena, she (the beauty) had cocked her tail with great
arrogance at smelling English ground again. To her straight came
several dogs, who had never travelled far (except when they were
tail-piped), and one and all cried, “ Hail, my dear! Have you seen
any dogs to compare with us? Set of mongrel parley-woos, can't

bark or bite like a Christian. Just look round the corner, pretty,
while we kill that poodle.”
To whom Wena-leniter atterens caudam “Cordially I thank
you. So much now I have seen of the world that my faith is gone
in tail-wags. If you wish to benefit by my society, bring me a bit
from the hock of bacon, or a very young marrow-bone. Then will
I tell you something." They could not comply with her requisitions,
because they had eaten all that themselves. And so she trotted along
the beach, like the dog of Polyphemus, or the terrier of Hercules,
who tinged his nose with murex.
'Tis a very easy thing to talk of walking, fifty miles, but quite
another pair of shoes to do it; especially with pack on back, and
feet that have lost habitual sense of Macadam's tender mercies.
Moreover, the day had been very warm for the beginning of
October—the dying glance of Summer, in the year 1860, at her
hitherto foregone and forgotten England. The highest temperature
of the year had been 72° (in the month of May); in June and July,
66° and 68° were the maxima, and in August things were no better.
Persistent rain, perpetual chill, and ever-present sense of icebergs,
and longing for logs of dry wood. But towards the end of Sep-
tember some glorious weather set in; and people left off fires at the
time when they generally begin them. Therefore, Cradock Nowell
was hot, footsore, and slightly jaded, as he came to the foot of
Sydenham Hill, on the second day of his journey. The Crystal
Palace, which long had been his landmark through country cross-
roads, shone with blue and airy light, as the sun was sinking.
Cradock admired more and more, as the shadows sloped along it,
the fleeting gleams, the pellucid depth, the brightness of reflection
framed by the softness of refraction.
He had always loved that building; and now, at the top of the
hill, he resolved (weary as he was) to enter and take his food there.
Accordingly Wena was left to sup and rest at the stables; he paid
the shilling that turns the wheel, and went first to the refreshment
court. After doing his duty there, he felt a great deal better; then
buttoned his coat like a Briton, and sauntered into the transept.
It had been a high and mighty day, for the Ancient Order of
Mountaineers (who had never seen a mountain) were come to look
for one at Penge, with sweethearts, wives, contingencies, and
continuations. It boots not now to tell their games; enough that
they had been very happy, and were gathering back in nave and
transept for a last parade.
To Cradock, now so long accustomed to sadness, solitude, and
bad luck, the scene, instead of being ludicrous (as a youth of
fashion would have found it), was interesting and impressive, and
even took a solemn aspect as the red rays of the sun retired, and
the mellow shades were deepening. He leaned against the iron
rail in front of the grand orchestra, and seeing many pretty faces,

thought about his Amy, and wondered what she now was like, and
whether she were true to him. From Pomona Island he could not
write; from New York he had never written; not knowing the loss
of the Taprobane, and fearing lest he should seem once more to be
trying the depth of John Rosedew's purse. But now he was come
to England, with letters from Captain Recklesome Young, to his
London correspondents, which ensured him a good situation, and
the power to earn his own bread, and perhaps in a little while
his Amy's.
As he leaned and watched the crowd go by like a dream of faces,
the events of the bygone year passed also in dark parade before
him. Sad, mysterious, undeserved—at least so far as he could
judge, though he did not dare to say so—how had they told upon
him? Had they left him in better, or had they left him in bitter
frame with his father God and his fellow-man ?
That question might be solved at once, to any but himself, by
the glistening of his eyes, the gentleness of his gaze around, the
smile with which he drew back his foot when a knickerbocked child
trod on it. He loved his fellow-creatures still ; and love is law and
gospel.
While he thought these heavy things, feeling weary of the road,
of his life half weary, shrinking from the bustling world again to be
encountered, suddenly a grand vibration thrilled his heart, and
mind, and soul. From the great concave above him, melody was
spreading wide, with shadowy resistless power, like the wings of
angels. The noble organ was pealing forth, rolling to every nook
and corner, sweeping over the heads of the people and into their
hearts (with one soft passport), “ Home, sweet home !"
The men who had come because tired of home, the wives to give
them a change of it, the maidens perhaps to get homes of their own,
the children to cry to go home again ;-all with one accord stood
still, all listened very quietly, and said nothing at all about it.
Only they were the better for it, with many a kind old memory
rising, at least among the elder ones, and many a large unselfish
hope making the young people look, with trust, at one another.
And what did Cradock Nowell feel? His home was not a sweet
one ; bitter things had been done against him ; bitter things himself
had done. None the less, he turned away and wept beneath a
music-stand, as if his heart would never give remission to his eyes.
None could see him in the dark there, only the God whose will it
was, and whose will it often is, that tears should make Him look at
“I will arise, and go home to my father. I will cry, ' Father, I
have sinned against heaven, and against thee.””
And so he had. Not heavily, not wilfully, not wittingly, not a
hundredth part so badly as that father had sinned against him.
Yet it was wrong in him not to allow the old man to recover
us.

himself; but, forgetting a son's love-duty, so to leave him-hotly,
hastily, with a proud defiance. Till now he had never felt, or at
least confessed to himself, that wrong. Now, as generous natures
do, he summed up sternly against himself, leniently against others.
And then he asked, with yearning and bitter self-reproach, “Is the
old man yet alive?”
*
*
The woods were still as rich and sweet, and the grass as soft as
in May month; the windings of the pleasant dells were looped with
shining waters; but she who used to love them so and brighten at
their freshness, to follow the steps of each wandering breeze, and
awake to the sun as a flower does-now she came through her
favourite places, and hardly cared to look at them.
Only three short months ago she had returned to her woodland
home, and the folk that knew and loved her, in the highest and
brightest spirits of youth, conscious beauty, and hopefulness. All
her old friends were rejoicing in her, and she in their joy delighted,
when her father thought it his sorrowful duty, in this world of
sorrow, to tell her the bad news about her ever unlucky Cradock.
At first she received it with scorn--as the high manner of her
mind was—utter unbelief, because God could not have done it.
Being simple, and very young, she had half as much faith in her
heavenly Father as she had in the earthly and fallible parent; neither
was she quite aware that we do not buy, but accept from Heaven.
But, as week upon back of week, and month upon head of month,
went by, Amy's faith began to wane, and the maid herself to
languish. She watched the arrival of every mail from the Cape,
from India, from anywhere; her heart leaped up as each steamer
came in, and sank at each empty letter-bag. Meanwhile her father
was growing very unhappy about her, and so was good Aunt Doxy.
At first John had said, when she took it so calmly, “Thank God !
How glad I am! But her mother cared for me more than that.”
Like many another loving father, he had studied, but never learned
his child.
Now it was the fifth day of October, the weather bright and
beautiful, the English earth and trees and herbage trying back for
the summer of which they had been so cheated. Poor pale Amy
asked leave to go out. She had long been under Rue Hutton's
care, not professionally, but paternally (for Rufus would have his
own way, when he was truly fond of any one), and she asked so
quietly, so submissively, without a bit of joke about it, that when
she was gone her father set to, and shook his head, till a heavy tear
came and blotted out a reference which had taken all the morning.
As for Aunt Doxy, she turned aside, and took off her spectacles
quickly, because the optician had told her to keep them perfectly dry.
Where the footpath wanders to and fro, preferring pleasure to
duty, and meeting all remonstrance by quoting the course of the

brook alongside it, Amy Rosedew slowly walked, or heavily stopped
every now and then, caring for nothing around her. She had made
up her mind to cry no more, only to long for the time and place when
and where no crying is. Perhaps in a year or so, if she lived, she might
be able to see things again, and attend to her work as usual. Till
then she would try to please her father, and keep up her spirits for
his sake. Every one had been so kind to her, especially dear Eöa,
who had really cried quite steadily; and the least thing poor Amy
herself could do was to try and deserve it.
Thinking thus, and doing her best to feel as well as think it, yet
growing tired already, she sat down in a chair as soft as her own
weary heart was. A noble beech, with a head of glory overlooking
the forest, had not neglected to slipper his feet with the richest of
nature's velvet. From the dove-coloured column's base, two yards
above the ground-spread, drifts of darker bulk began, gnarled crooks
of grapple, clutching wide at mother earth, deeply fanged into her
breast, sureties against every wind. Ridged and ramped with many
a hummock, rift, and twisted sinew, forth these mighty tendons
stretched, some fathoms from the bole itself. Betwixt them nestled,
all in moss, corniced with the golden, and cushioned with the
emerald, nooks of cool, delicious rest, wherein to forget the world,
and dream upon the breezes. “As You Like It,” in your lap, Theo-
critus tossed over the elbow, because he is too foreign-what sweet
depth of enjoyment for a hard-worked man who has earned it!
But, in spite of all this voluptuousness, the “ moss more soft than
slumber," and the rippling leafy murmur, the poets could tell that
Amy Rosedew managed to have another cry ere ever she fell
asleep. To cry among those arms of moss, fleecing, tufting, pillow-
ing, an absorbent even for Niobe! Can the worn-out human nature
find no comfort in the vegetable, though it does in the mineral,
kingdom?
Back, and back, and further back into the old relapse of sleep, the
falling thither whence we came, the interest on the debt of death.
Yet as the old Stageirite hints, some of day's emotions filter through
the strain of sleep; it is not true that good and bad are, for half of
life, the same. Alike their wits go roving haply after the true
Owner, but some may find Him, others fail-Father, who shall limit
thus Thine infinite amnesty ?
It would not be an easy thing to find a fairer sight than Amy. Her
white arms on the twisted plumage of the deep green moss, the
snowy arch of her neck revealed as the clustering hair fell from it, and
the frank and playful forehead resting on the soft grey bark. She
smiled in her sleep every now and then, for her pleasant young
humour must have its own way when the schoolmaster, sorrow,
was dozing; and then the sad dreaming of trouble returned, and
the hands were put up to pray, and the red lips opened, whispering,
“Come home ! Only come to your Amy!”

CRADOCK NOWELL.
And then, in her dream, behold he was come-raining tears upon
her cheek, holding her from all the world, fearing to thank God
yet. She in her dream was smiling at him; not by any means
prepared to jump into his arms, but still—oh, it was so delicious !
Suddenly she opened her eyes. What made her face so wet? Why,
Wena !
Wena, as sure as dogs are dogs; mounted on the mossy arm,
lick-lick-licking, mewing like a cat almost, even offering taste of her
tongue, while every bit of the Wena dog shook with ecstatic
rapture.
Oh, Wena, Wena! what are you come to tell me, Wena ?
Oh that you could speak!”
Wena immediately proved that she could. She galloped round
Amy, barking and yelling, until the great wood echoed again ; the
rabbits, a mile away, pricked their ears, and the yaffingales stopped
from tapping. Then off set the little dog down the footpath. Oh,
could it be to fetch somebody?
The mere idea of such a thing made Amy shake so, and feel so
odd, she was forced to put one hand against the tree, and the other
upon her heart.
She could not look, she was in such a state ; she
could not look down the footpath. It seemed, at least, a century,
and it may have been half a minute, before she heard through the
bushes a voice-tush, it was the voice.
“Wena, you bad dog, come in to heel. Is this all the Yankees
have taught you?”
But Wena broke fence and everything, set off full gallop again
to Amy, tugged at her dress, and retrieved her.
What happened after that, Amy knows not, neither knows Cradock
Nowell. So anything we might set down, would be a fond thing
vainly invented.
All they remember is-looking back upon it, as both of them do,
as the zenith of their lives—that neither of them could say a word
except“ darling, darling, darling !” all pronounced as superlatives,
with “my own," once or twice between, and an exclusive sense of
ownership, illiberal to the last degree, and most unphilosophical.
What business have we with such minor details ? Who has sworn
us accountants of kisses ? All we have any right to say is, that
after a long spell of inarticulate tautology, Amy looked up when
Cradock proposed to add another cipher; very gravely, indeed, she
looked up; except in the deepest depth of her eyes.
“Oh no, Cradock. You must not think of it. Seriously now,
no more, love."
“Why? I should like to know, indeed! After all the time I
have been away !"
“I have so little presence of mind. I forgot to tell you in time,
dear. Why, because Wena has licked my face all over, darling.
Darling, yes, she has, I say. You are too bad not to care about it.

Now come to my own best father, dear. Offer your arm like a

“ So they”—as Milton concisely says. Homer would have written
“they two." How sadly our language wants a dual! We, the
domestic race, have we rejected it because the use would have
seemed a truism ?

That same afternoon Bull Garnet lay dying, calmly and peace-
fully going off, taking the accounts of his stewardship to a larger
world. He knew that there were some heavy items underscored
against him; but he also knew that the mercy of God can even
outdo the hope He gives us for token and for keepsake,
A greater and a grander end, after a life of mark and power,
might, to his early aspirations and self-conscious strength, have
seemed the bourne intended. If it had befallen him-as but for
himself it might have done—to appear where men are moved by
passion, vigour, and bold decision, his name would have been
historical, and better known to the devil.
As it was, he lay there dying, and was well content. The turbu-
lence of life was past, the torrent and the eddy, the attempt at fore-
reaching upon his age, and sense of impossibility, the strain of his
mental muscles to stir the great dead trunks of “orthodoxy," and
then the self-doubt, the chill, the depression, which follow such
attempts, as surely as ague tracks the pioneer.
Thank God, all this was over now, and the violence gone, and
the dark despair. Of all the good and evil things which so had
branded him distinct, two yet dwelled in his feeble heart, only two
still showed their presence in his dying eyes. Each of those two
was good, if two indeed they were—faith in the heavenly Father,
and love of the earthly children.
Pearl was sitting on a white chair at the side of the bed away
from the window, with one hand in his failing palm, and the other
trying now and then to enable her eyes to see things. She was
thinking, poor little thing, of what she should do without him, and
how he had been a good father to her, though she never could
understand him. That was her own fault, no doubt. She had
always fancied that he loved her as a bit of his property, as a thing
to be managed. Now she knew that it was not so; and he was
going away for ever, and who would love or manage her? And
the fault of all this was her own perhaps.
Rufus Hutton had been there lately, trying still to carry on sone
little show of comfort, and a large one of encouragement; for he
was not the man to " say die” till a patient came to the preterite.
Throughout the whole, and knowing all, he had behaved in the
noblest manner, partly from his own quick kindness, partly from
that protective and fiduciary feeling which springs self-sown in

the hearts of women when showers of sorrow descend, and crops
up in the manly bosom at the sunshine of golden fees. Not that
he took or thought of fees; but that his professional habits re-
vived, with a generosity added, because he knew that he would
take nothing, though all were in his power.
Suddenly Mr. Pell came in, our old friend Octavius, sent for in
an urgent manner, and looking as a man looks who feels, but
cannot move upon, the hinge of his existence. Like a thorough
gentleman, he had been shy of the cottage, although aware of
their distress; eager at once and reluctant, partly because it
stood not in his but his rector's parish, partly for deeper
reasons.
Though Pell came in so quietly, Bull Garnet rose at his entry, or
tried to rise on the pillow, swept his daughter back by a little
motion of his thumb, which she quite understood, and cast his eyes
on the parson's with a languid yet strong intelligence. He had
made up his mind that the man was good, and yet he could not
help probing him.
The last characteristic act of poor Bull Garnet's life, a life which
had been all character, all difference from other people.
“Will you take my daughter's hand, Pell?”
Only too gladly," answered Pell: but she shrank away, and
sobbed at him.
“Pearl, come forward this moment. It is no time for shilly-
shallying."
The poor thing timidly gave her hand, standing a long way back
from Pell, and with her large eyes streaming, yet fixed upon her
father, and no chance at all of wiping them.
“Now, Pell, do you love my daughter? I am dying, and I ask
6.
you."
'That I do, with all my heart,” said Pell, like a downright
Englishman. “I shall never love any other.”
“ Now, Pearl, do you love Mr. Pell ?" Her father's eyes were
upon her in a way that commanded truth. She remembered how
she had told a lie, at the age of seven or eight, and that gaze had
forced it out of her, and she had never dared to tell one since, until
no lie durst come near her.
“Father, I like him very much. Very soon I should love him,
if-if he loved me.”
“Now, Pell, you hear that !”
“ Beyond all doubt I do,” said Octave, whose dryness never
deserted him in the heaviest rain of tears; "and it is the very
best
thing for me I have heard in all my life.”
Bull Garnet looked from one to the other, with the rally of his
Xfe come hot, and a depth of joyful sadness. Yet must he go a
little further, because he had always been a tyrant, till people
understood him.

one.
“Do you want to know how much money, sir, I intend to leave
her, when I die at four o'clock this afternoon ?"
Cut-and-dry Pell was taken aback. A thoroughly upright and
noble fellow, but of wholly different and less rugged road of
thought. Meanwhile Pearl had slipped away; it was more than
she could bear, and she was so sorry for Octavius. Then Pell up
and spake bravely,--
“Sir, I would be loth to think of you, my dear one's father, as
anything but a gentleman; a strange one, perhaps, but a true
And so I trust you have only put such a question to me in
irony."
“ Pell, there is good stuff in you. I know a man by this time.
What would you think of finding your dear one's father a mur-
derer ?”
Octavius Pell was not altogether used to this sort of thing. He
turned away with some doubt whether Pearl would be a desirable
mother of children (for he, after all, was a practical man), and
hereditary insanity Then he turned back, remembering that
all mankind are mad.
Meanwhile Bull Garnet watched him, with extraordinary wrinkles,
and a savage sort of pleasure. He felt himself outside the world,
and looking at the stitches of it. But he would not say a word.
He had always been a bully, and so to the last he would be.
Sir,” said Octave Pell, at last,“ you are the very oddest man I
ever saw in all my life.”
Ah, you think so, do
you,
Pell? Possibly you are right; pos-
sibly you are right, Pell. I have no time to think about it. It
never struck me in that light. If I am so very odd, perhaps you
would rather not have my daughter ?”
“If you intend to refuse her to me, you had better say so at once,
sir. I don't understand a word of this.”
“I wish you to understand nothing at all beyond the simple fact.
I shot Clayton Nowell, and did it on purpose, because I found him
insulting her.”
6 Good God! You don't mean to say it ?”
I never yet said a thing, Pell, which I did not mean to say."
“ You did it in haste? You have repented ? For God's sake, tell
me that."
“ Treat this as a question of business. Look at the deed and
nothing else. Do you still wish to marry my daughter ?”
Pell turned away from the great wild eyes now solemnly fix il
upon him. His manly heart was full of wonder, anguish, and giddy
turbulence. The promptest of us cannot always “ come to time,”
like a prizefighter.
Pearl came in, with her chest well forward, and then drew back
very suddenly. She thought her fate must be settled now, and
would like to know how they had settled it. Then, like a genuine

English lady, she gave a short sigh and went away. Pride makes
the difference between us and all other nations.
But the dignified glance she had cast on Pell settled his fate and
hers for life. He saw her noble self-respect, her stately reservation,
her deep sense of her own pure value (which never would assert
itself), and her passing contempt of his hesitation.
At all risks I will have her," he said to mself, for his manly
strength gloried in her strong womanhood ; “if she can be won I
will have her. Oh, how I am degrading her! What a fool-bound
fellow I am!”
Then he spoke to her father, who had fallen back, and was faintly
gazing, wondering what the stoppage was.
'Sir, I am not worthy of her. God knows how I love her. She
is too good for me.”
Bull Garnet gathered his fleeting life, and looked at Pell with a
love so deep that it banished admiration. Then his failing heart
supplied, for the last, last time of all, the woe-worn fountain of his
eyes. Strong and violent as he was, a little thing had often touched
him to the turn of tears. What impulse is there but has this end ?
Even broadest laughter.
Pell lifted from the counterpane the large but shrunken hand,
which was on the way to be offered to him, until sad mernory.
stopped it. Then he looked down at the poor grey face, where the
forehead, from the fall of the rest, appeared almost a monstrosity,
and the waning of strong emotions left a quivering of hollowness.
The young parson looked down with noble pity. Much he knew of
his father-in-law! Bull Garnet would never be pitied. He drew
his hand back with a little jerk, and placed it against his broad,
“I can't bear to die like this, Pell. I wish to God you would
shave me.”
Pell went suddenly down on his knees, put his firm brown
hands up, and said nothing except the Lord's Prayer. Bull Garnet
tried to raise his palms, but the power of his wrists was gone, and
so he let them fall together. Then at every grand petition he
nodded at the ceiling, as if he saw it going upward, and feared for
the lath and plaster,
He had said he should die at four o'clock, for the paroxysms of
heart-complaint returned at measured intervals, and he felt that he
could not outlast another. So with his usual mastery and economy
of labour, he had sent a man to get the keys and begin to toll the
great church bell, as soon as ever the clock struck four. “Not
too long apart," he said, “steadily, and be done with it." When
the boom of the sluggish bell came in at the open window, Bull
Garnet smiled, because the man was doing exactly as he had
ordered him.
Right,” he whispered “yes, quite right. I have always been
square chin.

oh, if
before my time. Just let me see my children." And after that he
had no more pain.
Amy came in very softly, to know if he was dead. They had told
her she ought to leave it alone, but she could not see it so. Know-
ing all and feeling all, she felt beyond her knowledge. If it would-
vould help him with a spark of hope in his parting, help
him in the judgment-day, to have the glad forgiveness of the brother
with the deeper wrong—there it was, and he was welcome.
A little whispering went on, pale lips into treinbling ears, and then
Cradock, with his shoes off, was brought to the side of the bed.
“He won't know you,” Pearl sobbed softly; "but how kind of you
to come !" She was surprised at nothing now.
Her father raised his languid eyes, until they met Cradock's eager
ones; there they dwelt with doubt, and wonder, and a slow re-
joicing, and a last attempt at meaning:
John Rosedew took the wan stiffening hand, lying on the sheet
like a cast-off glove, and placed it in Cradock's sunburnt palm.
“ He knows all,” the parson whispered; "he has read the letter
you left for him; and, knowing all, he forgives you."
“That I do, with all my heart," Cradock answered firmly. “May
God forgive me as I do you. Wholly, purely, for once and for all !"
“ Kind-noble-Godlike _” the dying man gasped very slowly,
but with his old decision.
Bull Garnet could not speak again. The great expansion of heart
had been too much for worn weariness. Only now and then he
looked at Cradock with his Amy, and every look was a prayer for
them, and perhaps a recorded blessing.
Then they slipped away, in tears, and left him, as he ought to be,
with his children only. And the telegraph of death was that God
would never part them.
Now, think you not this man was dying a great deal better than
he deserved ? No doubt he was. And, for that matter, so perhaps
do most of us. Yet who can be blamed for that, but God?
CHAPTER LXIV.
REST YE IN THE WOODLAND.
SOFTLY and quietly fell the mould on the coffin of Bull Garnet. A
great tree overhung his sleep, without fear of his wood-axe. Clayton
Nowell's simple grave, turfed and very tidy, was only a few yards
away. That ancient tree spread forth' its arms on this one and the

other, as a grandsire spreads his hands peacefully and playfully on
children who have quarrelled.
A lovely spot, as one might see, for violence to rest in, for long
remorse to sink and sleep, and deep repentance hopefully abide the
time of judgment. To feel the soft mantle of winter return, and the
promising gladness of spring, the massive depths of the summer-tide,
and the ripe disarray of autumn. And to be, no more the while,
oppressed, or grieved, or overworked, passionate, or weary.
There shall forest-children come, joining hands in pleasant fear,
and, sitting upon grassy mounds, wonder who inhabits them, won-
der who and what it is that cannot wonder any more. And haply
they shall tell this tale—become a legend then when he who writes,
and ye who read, are shadows in a larger forest.
Ay, and tell it better far, more simply, and more sweetly, never
having gone astray from the inborn sympathy. For every grown-
up man is apt to mar the uses of his pen with bitter words, and
small, and twaddling ; conceiting himself to be keen in the first, just
in the second, and sage in the third. For all of these let him crave
forgiveness of God, his fellow-creatures, and himself, respectively.
Šir Cradock Nowell, still alive to the normal sense of duty,
cottered away on John Rosedew's arm, from the grave of his half-
brother. He had never learned whose hand it was that dug the
grave near by, and no one ever forced that bitter knowledge on
him. This last blow, which seemed to strike his chiefest prop from
under him, had left its weal on his failing mind in great marks of
astonishment. That such a strong, great man should drop, and he,
the elder and the weaker, be left to do without him !
He was going to the Rectory now, to have a glass of wine, after
fatigue of the funeral, a vintage very choice and rare, according to
Mr. Rosedew, and newly imported from Oxford. And truly that was
its origin. It might have claimed "founder's kin fellowship,” like
most of the Oxford wine-skins.
“Wonderful, wonderful man !" said poor Sir Cradock, doing his
best to keep his back very upright, from a sudden erection of memory,
“to think that he should go first, John! Oh, if I had a son left,
he should take that man for his model.”
Scarcely that,” John Rosedew thought, knowing all that had
come to pass ;
“ but of the dead I will say no harm.”
“So quick, so ready, so up for any thing! Ah, I remember he
knocked a man down just at the corner by this gate here, where we
can't get the couch-grass out. And afterwards he proved to me how
richly he deserved it. That is the way to do things, John.”
"I am not quite sure of that,” said the conscientious parson ; “it
might be wiser to prove that first ; and then to abstain from doing
it. I remember an instance in point-
“Of course you do. You always do, John, and I wish you
wouldn't. But that has nothing to do with it. You are always

his eyes,
cutting me short, John : and worse than ever since you came back,
and they talked of you so at Oxford. I hope they have not changed
you, John."
He looked at the white-haired rector, with an old man's jealousy.
Who else had any right to him?
“My dear old friend,” replied John Rosedew, with kind sorrow in
“I never meant to cut you short. I will try never to do it
again. But I know I am rude sometimes, and I am always sorry
afterwards."
“Nonsense, John; don't talk of it. I understand you by this
time ; and we allow for one another. But now about my son, my
poor unlucky boy."
To be sure, yes," said the other old man, not wishing to hurry
matters. And so they stopped, and probed the hedge with their
sticks, instead of one another.
"I don't know how it is," at last Sir Cradock Nowell said, being
rather aggrieved with John Rosedew for not breaking ground upon
him,“ but how hard those stubs of ash are ! Look at that splinter,
almost severed by a man who does not know how to splash; Jem,
his name is, poor Garnet told me, Jem-something or other-and
yet all I can do with my stick won't fetch it away from the stock.”
“ Like a child who will not quit his father, however his father has
treated him.”
“What do you mean by that, John ? Are you driving at me
again? I thought you had given it over."
“I never give over anything," answered the parson, in a manner
for him quite melodramatic, and above his usual key.
“ No. "We always knew how stubborn you were. And now you
are worse than ever."
“No fool like an old fool,” Mr. Rosedew answerea, smiling
sweetly, yet with some regret. “Cradock, I am such a fool I shall
let out everything."
“What do you mean ?” asked Sir Cradock Nowell, leaning
heavily on his staff, and setting his white face rigidly, yet with every
line of it ready to melt ; “John, I have heard strange rumours, or
I have dreamed strange dreams. In the name of God, what is it,
John ? My son !-my only son-
He could say no more, but turned away, and bowed his head, and
crembled.
“Your only son, your innocent son, has been at my house these
three days; and when you like, you can see him.”
“When I like-ah, to be sure! I don't like many people. I arat
getting very old, John. And no one to come after me. It seems a
pity, don't you think, and every one against me so ?”
" You can take your own part still, my friend. And you have to
take your son's part."
“Yes, to be sure, my son's part. Perhaps he will come back

some day. And I know he did not do it, now; and I was very
hard to him-don't you think I was, John ?-very hard to my poor
Craddy, and he was so like his mother !”
But you will be very kind to him now; and he will be such a
comfort to you, now he is come back again, and going away no
more, for ever.”
I declare you make me shake, John. You do talk such nonsense.
One would think you knew all about him,-more than his own
father does. What have I done, to be kept like this in the dark,
all in the dark? And you seem to think that I was hard to
him."
“ Cradock, all you have to do is just to say the word ; just to
say that you wish to see him, and your son will come and talk to
you.”
“Talk to me! Oh yes, I should like to talk to him-very much-
I mean, of course, if he is at leisure.”
He leaned on his stick, and tried to think, while Mr. Rosedew
hurried off; and of all his thoughts the foremost were, “What
wi Cradock my boy be like; and what shall I give him for
dinner?"
Cradock came up shyly, gently, looking at his father first, then
waiting to be looked at. The old man fixed his eyes upon him, at
first with some astonishment-for his taste in dress was somewhat
outraged by the Broadway style—then, in spite of all the change,
remembrance of his son returned, and love, and sense of ownership.
Last of all, paternal pride in the young man's height and magnitude,
blended with soft recollections of the time he dandled him.
“Why, Cradock! Is it my Craddy, then ? What a size you are
grown, my boy, my boy!”
“Oh, father, I am sure you want me. Only try me once again.
I am not at all a radical.”
“ Crad, you never could be. I knew you must come round at last
to a proper way of thinking. When you had seen the world, Crad;
when you had seen the world a bit, as your father did' before
you."
And thus they made the matter up, in politics, and dress, and
little touches of religion, and in the depth of kindred love which
underlies the latter; and never after was there word, except of
migrant petulance, between the crotchety old man, and the son who
held his heart's key.
All this while we have been loth to turn to Mrs. Corklemore,
and contemplate her discomfiture, although in strict sequence of
events we ought to have done so long ago. But it is so very painful
-and now-a-days all writers agree with Epicurus, in regarding pain
as the worst of evils—so bitter is the task to describe a lovely

in robbing other people, that really-ah well-a-day, physic must be
taken.
At the time of her dismissal from the halls of Nowelhurst,
Mr. Corklemore had been so glad to see his pretty wife again, and
that queer little Flore, who amused him so by pinching his stiff
leg, and crying, “haw," and he had found the house so desolate,
and the absence of plague so unwholesome, and the responsibility
of having a will of his own so horrible, that he scarcely cared to
ask the reason why they were come home again. And Georgie-
who was not thoroughly heartless, else how could she have got on
50 ?-thought Coo Nest very snug and nice, with none to contradict
her. So she found relief awhile, in banishing her worse, while she
indulged her better half.
Let us also do the same by suppressing once for all the
tendency to moralize. In Georgie's case, as well as ours, the in-
dulgence possessed at any rate the attractions of change and
variety. But, knowing how strictly we are bound by the canons of
philosophy to suspect and put the curb on every natural bias, that
good young woman soon refrained from over-active encouragement
of her inclination to goodness. Rallying her sense of right, she
vanquished very nobly all the seductions of honesty, and, by a
virtuous effort, marched from the Capua of virtue.
She stood upon the wood-crowned heights which look upon Coo
Nest, and as the smoke came curling up, the house seemed very
small to her. What a thing to call a garden! And the pigeon-
house at Nowelhurst was nearly as large as our stable! And oh
that little vinery, where one knew every single bunch, and came
every day to watch its ripening, and the little fuss of its solouring,
like an ogre watching a pet babe roasting. Surely nature never
meant her to live upon so small a scale; or why had she been
gifted with such large activities ?
She turned her back upon Coo Nest, and her face to Nowelhurst
Hall, and in her mind's eye saw a place ever so much larger.
Then a pleasant sound came up the hollow, a nice ring of revolving
wheels coquetting with the best C springs and all the new improve-
ments. Well-mettled horses, too, were there, stepping together
sonipedally, and a footman could be seen, whose legs must stand
him in bol. a year.
“ That odious old Sir Julius Wallop and his wizen-faced wife
come to patronize us again and say, 'Ha, Corklemore, snug little
place, charming situation ; but I think I should pull it down and
rebuild ; no room for Chang to stand in it. And how is my old
friend, Sir Cradock, your forty-fifth cousin, I believe? Ah, his
place is fit to look at. I haven't the heart to meet them now, and
their patronizing disparagement. Heigho! It is a nice turn-out.
And yet they have at Nowelhurst three more handsome carriages.
And it does look so much better to have two footmen there behind;

CRADOCK NOWELL.
and I do like watered linings so. How nice Flo did look by niy
side in that new barouche ! Oh, my darling child, I must not give
way to selfish feelings. I must do my duty towards you.”.
Therefore she proceeded, against her better nature, in the face of
prudence, with her attempt to set aside poor Sir Cradock Nowell,
and obtain fiduciary possession of his property. Cradock was lost
in the Taprobane, -of that there could be no doubt; and so she was
saved all further trouble of laying before the civil authorities the
stronger evidence they required before issuing a warrant. But all
was going very nicely towards the beginning of an inquiry as to the
old man's state of mind. Then suddenly she was checkmated, and
never moved a pawn again.
One afternoon, Mrs. Corklemore was sitting in her drawing-room,
expecting certain visitors, and quite ready to be bored with them,
because they were leading gossips-ladies who gave the first com-
plexion to any nascent narrative. And Georgie knew how to handle
them. In the county talk which must ensue, only let them take her
side, and all the world would feel for her in her painful and trying
position,
After a rumble of rapid wheels, and a violent pull at the bell
(which made the lady of the house to jump, because they had just
had the bell-hanger) into her sanctuary, came, with a cooler than
cucumine temperature, not indeed Lady Alberta Smith and her
daughter Victorina Beatrice, but Miss Eöa Nowell and her cousin
Cradock.
For once in her life Mrs. Corklemore was deprived of all presence
of mind, ghostly horror being added to bodily fear of Eða. She
fain would have fled, but her limbs gave way, and she fell back into
a soft French chair, and covered her face with both hands. Then
Eöa, looking tall and delicate in her simple mourning dress, came
up to her very quietly, leading Cradock as if she were proud of
him.
"I have taken the liberty, Mrs. Corklemore, of bringing my
cousin Cradock to see you, because it may save trouble.”
I trust you will forgive,” said Cradock, “our very sudden inva-
sion. We are come upon a matter of business, to save unpleasant
exposures and disgrace to our distant relatives."
Oh,” gasped poor Mrs. Corklemore, "you are alive, then, after
all ? You were proved to have lost your life upon the coast of
Africa."
“ Allow me to assure you that I am now proved to have saved it,"
Crad answered, bowing neatly.
“But it would have been so much better, under the sad, sad
circumstances, for all people of good feeling, and all interested in
the family.”
For the latter, perhaps it would, madam ; not so clearly for the
former. I am here to protect my father from all machinations."

“ Leave her to me,” cried Eöa, slipping beautifully in front of
him, “ I understand her best, because -because of my former voca-
tion. And I think she knows what I am."
“That I do," answered Georgie, cleverly interposing first a small
enamelled table; “not only an insolent, but an utterly reckless
creature.”
• You
may think so," Eöa replied, with calm superiority ;. " but
that only shows your piteous ignorance of the effects of discipline.
I am now so sedate and tranquil a woman, that I do not hate, but
scorn you."
Cradock could not help smiling at this, knowing what Eöa was.
“We want no strong expressions, my dear, on one side or the
other," for he saw that a word would have overthrown Eöa's new-
born discipline; “ Mrs. Corklemore is far too clever not to perceive
her mistake. She knows quite well that any inquiry as to my dear
father's state of mind can now be of no use to her. And if she
thinks of any further proceedings against myself, perhaps she had
better first look at just this—just this document.”
He laid before her a certificate, granted by three magistrates, that
indisputable evidence had been brought before them as to the cause
and manner of Clayton Nowell's death, and that Cradock Nowell
had no share in it, wittingly or unwittingly. That was the upshot
of it ; but of course it extended to about ħfty-fold the length.
Mrs. Corklemore bent over it in her most bewitching manner, and
perused it very leisurely, as if she were examining Flore's attempts
at pothooks. Meanwhile, with a side-glint of her eyes, she was
watching both of them; and it did not escape her notice that Eöa
was very pale.
“To be sure," she said at last, looking full at the Eastern maid,
“I see exactly how it was. I have thought so all along. A female
Thug must be charmed, of course, by the only son of a murderer.
My dear, I do so congratulate you."
“ Thank you," answered Eöa, and the deep gaze of her lustrous
eyes made the clever woman feel a world unopened to her ; “I
thank you, Georgie Corklemore, because you know no better. My
only wish for you is, that you may never know unhappiness, because
you could not bear it.”
Saying so, she turned away, and, with her light, quick step, was
gone, before her enemy could see a symptom of the welling tears
which then burst all control. But Cradock, who had dwelt in
sorrow, compared to which hers was a joke, stayed to say a few soft
words, and made a friend for evermore of the woman who had
plotted so against his life and all his love.
Madame la Comtesse since that time has seen much tribulation,
and is all the better for it. Mr. Corklemore died of the gout, and
the angel Flore of the measles ; and she herself, having nursed
them both, and lost some selfishness in their graves, is now (as her

CRADOCK NOWELL.
destiny seemed to be) the wife of Mr. Chope. Of course she is
compelled to merge her strong will in a stronger one, and, according
to nature's Salique law, is the happier for doing so. Whether this
union will produce a subject for biography to some unborn Lord
Campbell, time alone can show.
From the above it will be clear that poor Eöa Nowell was now
acquainted with the secret of the Garnet family. Bob himself had
told her all, about a month after his father's death, renouncing at
the same time all his claims upon her. Of that Eöa would not
hear; only at his urgency she promised to consult her friends, and
take a week to think of it. And this was the way she kept her
promise.
First she ran up to Cradock Nowell, with the bright tears still
upon her cheeks, and asked him whether he had truly and purely
forgiven his injurer. He took her hand, and answered her with his
eyes, in which the deepened springs of long affliction glistened,
fixed steadily on hers.
“As truly and purely as I hope to be forgiven at the judgment-
day."
“ Then that settles that matter. Now order the dog-cart, Craddy
dear, and drive me to Dr. Hutton's.”
Of course he obeyed her immediately, and in an hour they
entered the gate of Geopharmacy Lodge. Rosa was amazed at her
beauty, and thought very little, after that, of Mrs. Corklemore's
appearance.
“For my part,” said Rufus Hutton, when Eöa had laid the case
before him in a privy council," although it is very good of you,
and very flattering to me, that you look upon me still as your
guardian, I think you are bound first of all to consult Sir Cradock
Nowell."
"How very odd ! Now that is exactly what I do not mean to do.
He never can understand, poor dear, and I hope he never will, the
truth about poor Clayton's death. His present conviction is, lik
that of all the neighbourhood, that Black Will the poacher did it,
the man who has since been killed in a fight with Sir Julius
Wallop's gamekeepers. And it would shock poor uncle so ; I am
sure he would never get over it, if the truth were forced upon him.
And if it were, I am sure he would never allow me to have my way,
which, of course, I should do in spite of him. And I am not his
heiress now, since Cradock came to life again. But I have plenty
of money of my own; and I have quite settled what to give him
the day that I am married, and you too, my dear guardy, if you
behave well about this. Look here !”
She drew forth a purse quite full of gold, and tossed it in her old
Indian style, so that Rufus could not help laughing.
“Well, my dear,” he answered kindly, “who could resist such
bribery?' Besides, I see that your mind is made up, and we all

REST YE IN THE WOODLAND.
457
know what the result of that is. And after all, the chief question is,
what effect will your knowledge of this have on your love for your
husband ?"
It will only make me love him more, ever so much more, because
of his misfortune."
“And will you never allude to it, never let him see that you think
of it, so as to spoil his happiness ?”
“Is it likely I should think of it? Why, my father must have
killed fifty men. He was desperate in a battle. And Bob has never
brought any one of those murders up against me."
“Well, if you take it in that light-decidedly not an English
light
“And perhaps you never heard that Bob's father, by his quick-
ness and boldness, saved the lives of fifteen men in a colliery ex-
plosion, before ever he came to Nowelhurst, and therefore he had a
perfect right to-to-"
“ Take the lives of fifteen others. Fourteen to his credit still.
Well, Eöa, you can argue, if any female in the world can. Only in
one thing, my dear child, be advised by me. If you must marry
Robert Garnet, leave this country for a while, and take his sister
Pearl with you."
“Of course I must marry Bob," said Eöa ; "and of course I
should go away with him. But as to taking Pearl with us, why,
that's a thing to be thought about."
However, they got over that, as well as all other difficulties ; Sir
Cradock Nowell was at the wedding, Mr. Rosedew performed the
ceremony, and Rufus Hutton gave away as lovely a bride as ever
Bob Garnet spied a purple emperor, who had lost his
way, knocking his head in true imperial fashion against the chancel-
window, and he glanced at Eöa about it, between the two “I wills,"
and she lifted her beautiful eyebrows, and he saw that she meant to
catch him. So, after signing the register, they contrived to haul
him down, without letting Mr. Rosedew know it; then at the
chancel-porch they let him go free of the Forest, with his glorious
wings unsoiled. Not even an insect should have cause to repent
their wedding-day.
And now they live in as fair a place as any the world can show,
not far from Pezo da Ragoa, in the Alto Douro district. There
Eöa's children toddle by the brilliant river's brink, and form their
limbs to strength and beauty up the vine-clad mountain's side.
Bob has invested his share of proceeds in a vineyard of young
Bastardo, and Muscat de Jesu ; moreover, he holds a good appoint-
ment under the Royal Oporto Company, agricultural of the
vine.
Many a time Eöa sits watching with her deep bright eyes the
purple flow of the luscious juice from the white marble "lagar,"
wherein the hardy peasants, with their drawers tied at the knee,
was seen.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
tramp to the time of the violin to and fro, without turning round,
among the pulpy flood. Then Bob, who has discovered a perfect
cure for oïdium, and knows how to deal with every grub that bores
into or nips the vine, to his wife and bairns he comes in haste,
having been too long away, bringing a bunch of the “ladies'
fingers,” or the Barrete de Clerigo, or it may be some magnificent
insect new to his entomology; or, still more interesting prize, a
letter from Pearl or Amy, wherein Mrs. Pell, or Nowell, gossips of
the increasing cares which increase her happiness. Yet even among
those lovely scenes, and under that delicious sky, frequent and fond
are the glances cast by hope, as well as memory, at the bowered
calm of the Forest brooks, and the brown glamour of the beech-
wood.
And when they return to dwell in the Forest, and to end their
days there, even Bob will scarcely know the favourite haunts of his
boyhood-to such an extent has Cradock Nowell planted and im-
proved, clothing barren slopes with verdure, adding to the wealth
of woods many a new tint and tone, by the aid of foreign trees
unknown to his father. In doing so, his real object is not so much
to improve the estate, or gratify his own good taste, or even that of
Amy; but to find labour for the hands, and food for the mouths, of
industrious people. Sir Cradock grumbles just a little every now
and then, because, like all of us Englishmen, he must have his
grievance. But, on the whole, he is very proud of what his son is
doing, and thoroughly enjoys his power of urging or repressing
it.
And if on theoretic matters any question chances to arise between
them, when one says “no” to the other's “yes”-as all true Britons
are bound to do upon politics, port wine, and parsons,—then a
gentle spirit comes and turns it all to laughter, with the soft and
pleasant wit of a well-bred woman's ignorance.
For Amy still must have her say, and still asserts her privilege to
flavour every dull discussion with lively words, and livelier glances,
and a smile for both the disputants. Then Cradock looks at his
dear young wife with notes of admiration, and bids her keep such
piquant wisdom for the councils of the nursery. Upon which
pleasant reminder, the old man chuckles, as if some very good
thing had been said ; then craftily walks with a spotted toy, capable
of barking and exactly representing Caldo or Wena, whichever you
please, to the foot of certain black oak-stairs, where he fully expects
to hear the prattle of a small Clayton.
To wit, it has been long resolved, and managed with prospective
wisdom down the path of years, that the county annals shall not be
baulked of a grand Sir Clayton Nowell. And a very grand fellow
indeed he is, this two-year-old Clayton Nowell-grand in the
stolid sageness of his broad and steadfast gaze, grand in the
manner of his legs and his Holbein attitude, grander still in

459
stamping when his meat and ale are late, but grandest of all,
immeasurably grand, in the eyes of his grandfather.
Hogstaff, whose memory is quite gone, and his hearing too of
every sound except the voice of this boy, identifies him beyond all
cavil with the Clayton of our story. Many a time the bowed
retainer chides his little master for not remembering the things he
taught him only yesterday. Then Cradock smiles at his son's
oblivion of the arts his uncle learned, but never reminds old Hoggy
that the yesterday was rather more than five-and-twenty years
ago.
Is it true or is it false, according to the rules of art, that the
winding-up of a long, long story, handled with more care than
skill, should have some resemblance to the will of a kindly-natured
man? In whose final dispositions, no dependent, however humble,
none who have helped him in the many pages of his life, far less
any intimate friend, seeks in vain a grateful mention or a token of
regard.
Be that as it may, any writer who loves his work (although a fool
for doing so) feels the end and finish of it like the signature of his
will.
And doubly saddened must he be, if the scenes which
charmed him most, and cast .upon him such a spell that he could
not call spectators in,-if these, for want of skill, have wearied eyes
and hearts he might have pleased.
For surely none would turn away, whose nature is uncancelled, if
once he could be gently led into that world of beauty. To rest in
the majesty of shade, forgetting weary headache; to let the little
carking cares, avarice and jealousy, self-conceit and thirst of fame,
fly away on the wild wood, like the piping of a bird ; to hear the
rustle of young leaves, when their edges come together, and
dreamily to wonder at the stretch of the world beyond us.
Shall ever any man enclasp the good that grows above him, or
even offer to receive the spread of Heaven's greatness ? Yet every
man may lift himself above the highest tree-tops, even to the throne
of God, by loving and forgiving.
And verily, some friends of ours, who could not once forego a
grudge, are being taught, by tare and tret, how much they owe
their Maker, and how little to themselves.
First of these is Rufus Hutton, quite a jolly mortal, getting fat,
and riding Polly for the sake of his liver and renes. And all he
has to say is this : first, that he will match trees and babies with
any nurseryman; next, that as we have a knack of puffing good
people and good things, he begs for reciprocity on the part of
superior readers. And if this should chance to meet the eye of any
one who knows where to find a really first-rate Manilla, conducted
on free-trade principles, such knowing person, by addressing,
confidentially under seal, “R. H., Post-office, Ringwood," may
hear of something very greatly to his own advantage.

CRADOCK NOWELL.
Now do we, without appeal to the blue smoke of enthusiasm,
know of anything to the advantage of anybody whatever ? Yes,
beyond all doubt, we do. We may highly commend the recent
career of the Ducksacre firm, and Mr. Clinkers, and Issachar Jupp
the bargee. Robert Clinkers and Polly his wife are driving a first-
rate business in coal and coke and riddlings, not highly aristocratic
perhaps, but therefore free from all bad debts. You may see the
name on a great brass-plate near the Broadway, Hammersmith, on
the left hand, where the busses stop.
But Mr. Jupp flies at higher game. He has turned his length of
wind, that once secured the palm of victory in physical encounters,
to a higher and nobler use. In a word, Mr. Jupp is a Primitive
Christian upon and beside the waters of Avon. There you may
hear him preaching and singing through his nose alternately-ah,
me, that is not what I mean--for either proceeding is nasal—every
Sunday and Wednesday evening, when the leaks in the punt allow
him. He gets five-and-thirty shillings a-week, as Sir Cradock's
water-bailiff, and he has not stolen twig or catkin of all the trees he
convoys down Avon. In seven eight more summers, little Loo
Jupp will be perhaps the prettiest girl in the Forest. May we be
there to see her !
The best and kindest man of all who have said their say in this
story, and not thrust their merits forward, John Rosedew, still leads
his quiet life, nearer and nearer to wisdom's threshold, nearer and
nearer to the door of God. His temper is as soft and sweet, his
memory as bright and ready, and his humour as playful, as when
he was only thirty years old, and walked every day to Kidlington,
As for his shyness, that we must never ask him to discard ; because
he likes to know us first, and then he likes to love us.
But of all the people in the world, next to his own child
Amy, most he loves and most he honours his son-in-law, Cradock
Nowell.
Cradock Nowell, so enlarged and purified by affliction, so able
now to understand and feel for every poor man. He, when placed
in large possessions and broad English influence, never will forget
the time of darkness, grief, and penury, never will look upon his
brethren, as under another God than his.
It is true that we must have hill and valley, towering oak and
ragged robin, zenith cloud overlooking the sun, and crouching mist
in the hollows. And true as well that we cannot see all the causes
and needs of the difference.
But is it not still more true and sure, that the whole is of one
universal kingdom (bound together by one great love), the high and
low, the rich and poor, the powerful and the helpless?
And in the spreading of that realm, beyond the shores of time
and space, when at last old men discover what the true aim of this
life has been,-not greatness, honour, wealth, or science, no, nor

even wisdom (as we unwisely take it)—but happiness here, and
hereafter happiness, a flowing tide whose fountain is our love of
one another, then may we truly learn by feeling (whereby alone
we can learn) that all the clefts of anguish, and the rifts into the
heart of us, were but the needful entrance for the grafts of fruit
eternal,
