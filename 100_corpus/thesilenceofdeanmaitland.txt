DEAN MAITLANDQ
PART I.
“ Not poppy, nor mandragora,
Nor all the drowsy sirups of the world,
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou ow’dst yesterday.”
CHAPTER I.
THE gray afternoon was wearing on to its chill close; the dark
cope of immovable dun cloud overhead seemed to contract and grow
closer to the silent world beneath it; and the steep, chalky hill,
leading from the ancient village, with its hoary castle and church,
up over the bleak, barren down, was a weary thing to climb.
The solitary traveler along that quiet road moved her limbs more
slowly, and felt her breath coming more quickly and shortly, as she
mounted higher and higher, and the gray Norman tower lessened
and gradually sank out of sight behind her. But she toiled bravely
on between the high tangled hedges, draped with great curtains of
traveler‘s joy, now a mass of the silvery seed-feathers which the
country children call» “old man’s beard,” and variegated with the
deep-purple leaves of dogwood, the crimson of briony and roseberry,
the gleaming black of privet, and the gold and orange reds of ivy
hangings; and, though her pace slackened to a mere crawl, she did
not pause till she reached the brow of the hill, where the hedges
ceased, and the broad white high-road wound over the open down.
Here, where the inclosed land ended, was a ﬁve-barred gate in
the wild hedgerow, and here thzwggﬁtgjpn, depositing the

numerous parcels she carried on the ground at her feet, rested, her
arms supported on the topmost bar, and her face and the upper por-
tion of her tall ﬁgure traced clearly against the gray, gloomy sky.
Some linnets ﬂuttered out of the hedge beside her, one or two silent
larks sprang up from the turf of the downland sloping away from
the gate, and some rooks sailed cawing overhead. All else was still
with the weird, dreamy stillness that hangs over the earth on a day
of chill east-wind haze. ‘
There is a brooding expectancy about such a day that works
strongly on the imagination, and suggests the dark possibilities of
irresistible Fate. There is an austere poetry in the purply gray,
breathless earth, and the dark, unchanging sky, and a mute pathos
in the quiet hush of weary Nature, thus folding her hands for rest,
which has an unutterable charm for some temperaments, and touches
far deeper chords than those vibrated by the brilliance and joyous
tumult of life and song in the pleasant June-time. There is some-
thing of the inﬁnite in the very monotony of the coloring; the
breathless quiet, the vagueness of outline, and dimness of the all-
infolding mist are full of mystery, and invest the most commonplace
objects with interest.
The sense of inﬁnity was deepened in this case by the vast sweep
of the horizon which bounded our pedestrian’s gaze. The gray fal-
lows and wan stubble-ﬁelds sloped swiftly away from the gate to a
bottom of verdant pastures dotted with trees and homesteads; be-
yond them were more dim ﬁelds, and then awide belt of forest,
principally of ﬁrs. To the right the valley, in which nestled the
now unseen tower of Ohalkburne, widened out, bounded by gentle
hills, till the stream indicating its direction became a river, on the
banks of which stood the mist-veiled town of Oldport, the tall tower
of whose church rose light, white, and graceful against the iron-
gray sky, emulating in the glory of its maiden youth—for it had seen
but two lusters—the hoary grandeur of its Norman parent at Chalk-
burne. Beyond the town, the river rolled on, barge-laden, to the
sea, the faint blue line of which was blurred by a maze of masts
where the estuary formed a harbor.
To the left of the tired gazer stretched a wide champaign, rich
in woodland, and bounded in the far distance by two chalky sum-
mits, at whose steep bases surged the unseen sea, quiet to-day on
the surface, but sullen with the heavy roar of the ground-swell be-
neath. Here and there, in the breaks of wood and forest on the

horizon, Alma’s accustomed eyes saw some faint gray touches which
in bright summer were tiny bays of sapphire sea.
Alma Lee herself made a bright point of interest in the afternoon
grayness, as she leaned wearily, and not ungracefully, on the gate,
her face and ﬁgure outlined clearly against the dark sky. Her dress
was a bright blue, and her scarlet plaid shawl, fastened tightly about
her shoulders, revealed and suggested, as only a shawl can, a full,
supple form, indicative of youth and health. Her dark, thick. hair
was crowned by a. small velvet hat, adorned with a bright bird’s
wing; and her dark eyes and well-formed features, reposeful and
indiﬂ‘erent as they were at the moment, suggested latent vehemence
and passion. Her hands and feet were large, the former bare and
wrapped in the gay shawl for warmth.
Alma was not thinking of the mystery and inﬁnite possibility
suggested by the gray landscape before her; still less was she dream-
ing of the tragic shades Fate was casting even now upon her com-
monplace ‘path. Unsuspecting and innocent she stood, lost in idle
thought, deaf to the steps of approaching doom, and knowing noth-
ing of the lives that were to be so tragically entangled in the mazes
of her own. Could she but have had one glimpse of the swift-com-
ing future, with what horror would the simple country girl have
started back and struggled against the ﬁrst suspicion of disaster!
The silence was presently broken by four mellow, slowly falling
strokes from the gray belfry of Chalkburne; then all was still again,
and Alma began to pick up her parcels. Suddenly she heard the
sound of hoofs and wheels, and, dropping her packages, turned once
more to the gate, and appeared a very statue of contemplation by
the time a dog-cart, drawn by a high-stepping chestnut, and driven
by a spick-and-span groom, fair-haired and well-featured, drew up
beside her, and the groom sprang lightly to the ground.
“Come, Alma,” he said, approaching the pensive ﬁgure, which
appeared unconscious of him, “ you won’t say no now? You look
dog-tired.” ‘
“I shall say exactly what I please, Mr. Judkins,” she replied.
“Then, say yes, and jump up. Chestnut is going like a bird,
and will have you at Swaynestone in no time. Do say yes, do ee
now.”
“Thank you, I intend to walk.”
“Just think what a way it is to walk to Swayncstone, and you
so tired.”

“i am not tired.” ,
“ Then, why are you leaning on that there gate? ”
“I am admiring the view, since you are so very inquisitive.”
“ O Lord! the view! There’s a deal more view to be seen from
the seat of this here cart, and it‘s pleasant ﬂying along like a bird.
Come, now, Alma, let me help you up."
“ Mr. J udkins, will you have the kindness to drive out I said
in Oldport that I intended to walk. It’s very hard a person mayn’t
do as she pleases without all this worry,” replied Alma, impatiently.
“ Willful woman mun have her way,” murmured the young
fellow, ruefully. “ Well, let me carry them parcels home, at
least.”
“I intend to carry them myself, thank you. Good afternoon";
and Alma turned her back upon the mortiﬁed youth, and appeared
lost in the charms of landscape.
“Well, darn it! if you won’t come, you won’t; that‘s ﬁat! ”
the young man exclaimed, angrily. “ This is your nasty pride, Miss
Alma; but, mind you, pride goes before a fall,” he added, springing
to his perch, and sending the high stepper ﬂying along the level
down road like the wind, with many expressions of anger and dis-
appointment, and sundry backward glances at Alma, who gazed
with unruﬁled steadiness on the ﬁelds.
‘5 I wonder,” she mused, “ why a person always hates a person
who makes love to them? I liked Charlie Judkins well enough
before he took on with this love nonsense.”
And she did not know that by declining that brief drive she had
refused the one chance of escaping all the subsequent tragedy, and
that her fate was even now approaching in the growing gloom.
But what is this fairy music ascending from the direction of
Chalkburne, and growing clearer and louder every moment? Sweet,
melodious, drowsily cheery, ring out ﬁve tiny merry peals of bells,
each peal accurately matched with the other, and consisting of ﬁve
tones. The music comes tumbling down in sweet confusion, peal
upon peal, chime breaking into chime, in a sort of mirthful strife of
melody, through all which a certain irregular rhythm is preserved,
which keeps the blending harmonies from degenerating into dis-
sonance. With a sweep and a clash and a mingling of sleepy rapt-
ure, the elﬁn music ﬁlled all the quiet hazy air around Alma, and
inspired her with vague pleasure as she turned her head listening in
the direction of the dulcet sounds, and discerned their origin in the

nodding head of a large, silk-coated cart-horse looming through the
haze. ' ‘
He was a handsome, powerful fellow, stepping ﬁrmly up the hill
with the happy consciousness of doing good service which seems to
animate all willing, well-behaved horses, and emerging into full
view at the head of four gallant comrades, each nodding and step-
ping as cheerin as himself, with a ponderous wagon behind them.
Each horse wore his mane in love-locks, combed over his eyes, the
hair on the massive neck beingrtied here and there with bows of
bright woolen ribbon. Each tail was carefully plaited at its spring
from the powerful haunches for a few inches; then it was tied with
another bright knot, beneath which the remainder of the tail swept
in untrammeled abundance almost down to the pasterns, the latter
hidden by long fringes coming to the ground. The ponderous har-
ness shone brightly on the broad, shining brown bodies, and, as
each horse carried a leading-rein, thickly studded with brass bosses
and fastened to the girth, and there was much polished brass‘about
headstall, saddle, and collar, they presented a very glittering appear-
ance.
But the crowning pride of every horse7 and the source of all the
music which was then Witching the wintry air, was the lofty erec-
tion springing on two branching wires from every collar, and tow-
ering far above the pricked ears of the proud steeds. These wires
bore a long, narrow canopy placed at right angles to the horse’s
length, and concealing beneath a deep fringe of bright scarlet
worsted the little peal of nicely graduated bells. Balls of the same
bright worsted studded the roof of the little canopy, and ﬁnished
the gay trappings of the sturdy rustics, who here these accumulated
honors with a sort of ,meek rapture.
The wagon these stout fellows drewr needed all their bone and
sinew to bring it up and down the steep, hilly roads. Its hind
wheels were as high as Alma’s head; their massive felloes, shed
with double tires, were a foot broad; the naves were like moderate-
’sized casks. High over the great hind wheels arched the wagon‘s
ledge in a grand sweep, descending with a boat-like curve to the
‘ smaller front wheels, whence it rose again, ending high over the
Wheeler’s haunches, like the prow of some old ship over the sea.
A massive thing of solid timber it was, with blue wheels and red
body, slightly toned by weather. On the front, in red letters on a
yellow ground, was painted, “Richard Long, Melbourne, 1860/?

Two human beings, who interrupted the fairy music with strange
gutturals and wild ejaculations to the steeds, mingled with sharp
whip-cracks, accompanied this imposing equipage. One was a tall,
straight-limbed man in fustian jacket and trousers, a coat slung hus~
sar-wise from his left shoulder, and a cap worn slightly to one side,
with a pink chrysanthemum stuck in it. His sunburned face was
almost the hue of his yellow-brown curls and short beard ; his eyes
were blue; and his strong, labored gait resembled that of his horses.
The other was a beardless lad, his satellite, similarly arrayed, minus
the ﬂower. Sparks ﬂew from the road when the iron hoofs and
heavy iron boots struck an occasional ﬂint. When the great wagon
was fairly landed on the brow of the hill, the horses were brought-
to by means of sundry strange sounds and violent gestures on the
part of the men, and with creaking and groaning and hallooing the
great land-ship came to anchor, the elﬁn chimes dropped into silence,
interrupted by little bursts of melody at every movement of the
horses, and the lad seized a great wooden mallet and thrust beneath
the hind wheel. The carter leaned placidly against the ponderous
shaft with his face to Alma, and struck a match to kindle his re~
plenished pipe.
“ Coldish,” he observed, glancing with surly indifference toward
her.
“It is cold,” returned Alma, drawing her shawl cozily round
her graceful shoulders; while the wheeler, stimulated into curiosity
by his master’s voice, turned round to look at Alma, and shook out
a little peal of bells, which roused the emulation of his four broth-
ers, who each shook out a little chime on his own account; while
the wagoner glanced slowly round the vast horizon, and, after some
contemplation, said in a low, bucolic drawl :
“ Gwine to brain, I ’lows.”
“ It looks like it,” replied Alma. “ How is your wife, William? ”
The wagouer again interrogated the horizon for inspiration, and,
‘ after some thought, answered with a jerk, “Neuce the same."
“I hope she will soon be about again,” said Alma; and the
leader emphasized her words by shaking a little music from his can-
opy, and thus stimulated his brothers to do likewise. “ You come
home lighter than you set out,” she added, looking at the nearly
empty wagon, which she had seen pass in the morning ﬁlled with
straw.
William turned slowly round and gazed inquirineg at the wagon,

as if struck by a new idea, for some moments; then he said, “ Ay.”
After this he looked thoughtfully at Alma and her parcels for some
moments, until his soul again found expression in the words, “ Like
a lift? ” the vague meaning of which was elucidated by the pointing
of his whip toward the wagon.
Alma assented, and with the wagoner’s assistance soon found
herself, with all her merchandise, comfortably installed in the great
wagon, which was empty save for a few household and farming
necessaries from Oldport. Before mounting—a feat, by the way,
not unworthy of a gymnast—she stroked the wheel-horse’s thick,
silken coat admiringly.
“ You do take care of your horses at Malbourne, William,” she
said. “I heard father say this morning he never saw a better-
groomed and handsomer team than yours.”
William went on silently arranging Alma’s seat, and stowing her
parcels for her; but a smile dawned at the corners of his mouth,
and gradually spread itself over the whole of his face, and his
pleasure at length found a vent, when he reached the ground, in a
sounding thwack of his broad hand on the Wheeler's massive ﬂank
—-a thwack that set the bells a-tremble on the horse‘s neck, and
sent a sympathetic shiver of music through all the emulous brother-
hood.
“Ay,” he observed, with a broad smile of admiration along the
line of softly swaying tails and gently moving heads, with their
nostrils steaming in the cold air; “ he med well say that."
“Ay,” echoed Jem, the satellite, removing the sledge-mallet
from the wheel and striding to the front, with a reﬂection of his
. chief’s pleasure in his ruddy face as he glanced affectionately at the
team, “that he med.”
It was not Alma’s admiration which evoked such satisfaction—-
she was but a woman, and naturally could not tell a good horse
from a donkey; but her father, Ben Lee, Sir Lionel Swaynestone‘s
coachman, a man who had breathed the air of stables from his
cradle, and who drove the splendid silk-coated, silver-harnessed
steeds in the Swaynestone carriages, his opinion was something.
With a joyous crack of the whip, and a strange sound from the
recesses of his throat, William bid his team “Gee-upl ” -
The mighty hoofs took hold of the road, the great wheels slowly
turned, a shower of confused harmony fell in dropping sweetness
from the bells, and with creaking and groaning, and nodding heads,

and rhythmic blending of paces and music, the wagon lumbered
ponderously along the level chalk road which led, uninclosed by
hedge or fence, over the open down.
To ride in a wagon with ease, and at the same time enjoy the
surrounding landscape without a constant exercise of gymnastic
skill in balancing and counter-balancing the body in response to
the heavy swaying and jerking of the unwieldy machine, is difﬁ-
cult; to sit on the ledge is to be an acrobat; to lie on the ﬂoor is
to see nothing but sky, besides having one’s members violently
wrenched one from the other. Alma, however, was very comfort-
ably placed on a pile of sacks, which served as an arm-chair, dead-
eued the jerking power of the motion, and left her head and
shoulders above the ledge, so that she could well see the gray
surrounding landscape in the deepening haze.
She leaned back with a feeling of agreeable languor, wrapped
her hands in her shawl, and gazed dreamin on the down rising
steeply to the left, and forming, where chalk had been quarried in
one place, a miniature precipice, crested with overhanging copse,
rich in spring with fairy treasures of violets in white sheets over
the moss, clusters of primroses and oxlips among the hazel-stumps,
blue lakes of hyacinth, and waving forests of anemone; and she
gazed on the sloping ﬁelds, farmsteads, and bounding forest to the
right, lulled by the steady music of the bells, among which she
heard from time to time William’s satisﬁed growl of “Ay, he med
well say that,” and the occasional song of J em, as he trudged along
by the leader:
“ For to plow, and to sow, and to reap, and to mow,
Is the work of the farmer’s bu-oy-cy.”
Happy and harmless she looked in her rustic chariot, as they
rolled slowlyalong in the gathering gloom, now over a heathy
stretch nearly at the summit of the down, past a lonely, steep-
roofed, red-tiled hostelry, with a forge cheerily glowing by its side,
whence the anvil-music rose and blended pleasantly with that of
the bell-team, and over which hung a sign-board bearing the black-
smith’s arms, the hammer, with the couplet inscribed beneath, “By
hammer and hand, All arts do stand.”
Down-hill now, with the heavy drag cast beneath the wheel by
mighty efforts on the part of Jem; then again on the level road,
with the chalk down always rising to the left, and falling away to

the right; past farm-houses, where the cattle stood grouped in the
yard, and the ducks quacked for their evening meal; then once
more down a hill, steep and diﬁicult, down to the level of a willow-
shaded stream by a copse, outside which daifodils rioted all over
the sloping lea descending to the brook-side in spring; and then
again up and up, with straining and panting and creaking, with iron
feet pointed into and gripping the steep chalk road, with louder
pealing of the fairy chimes, whose rhythm grows irregular and ﬁt-
ful, with strange shouts and gestures from the men, with “ Whan "
and “ Whoa! ” and “Hither! ” with many pauses, when the great
heads droop, the music stops, and the mallet is brought into requi-
sition.
Happy and harmless, indeed, was Alma, the lashes drooping over
her rose-leaf cheeks, her fancies roving unfettered. She was hoping
to get home betimes, for she had something nice for father’s tea
among her parcels, and she was thinking of the penny periodical
folded up in her basket, and wondering how the heroine was get-
ting on in the story which broke off abruptly at such an interesting
moment in the last number. Was the peasant girl, in whom Alma
detected a striking likeness to herself, really going to marry the
poor young viscount who was so deplorahly in love with her? She
could not help furnishing the Viscount with the form and features
of Mr. Ingram Swaynestone, Sir Lionel’s eldest son, though the
latter was fair, while the Viscount happened to be dark.
Now they are at the summit of the steep hill, and pause to
breathe and replenish pipes. On one side is dense coppice; on the
other, Swaynestone Park slopes down in woodland, glade, and
park-like meadow to the sea-bounded horizon. Then on again,
up hill and down dale, past cottage and farmstead, with the park
always sloping away to the sea on the right. Lights glow cheerily'
now from distant cottage windows, and they can even catch glimpses
of lights from the facade of Swaynestone House between the trees
occasionally, while the merry music peals on in its drowsy rhythm,
and little showers of sparks rise at the contact of iron-shod wheel
and foot with the ﬁinty road.
They have just passed the entrance-gates of Swaynestone—
lonely gates, unfurnished with a lodge—and the wagon stops with
interrupted music at some smaller gates on the other side of the
road, where the upland still rises, not in bare down, but in rich
meadow, to a hanging wood, out of which peeps dimly in the dusk

a small white structure, built with a colonnade supporting an archi.
trave, to imitate a Greek temple—Alma’s home.
“Ayl he med well say that,” repeated the wagoner, still digest;
ing the pleasure of Ben Lee’s compliment, and slapping the wheel-
horse’s vast ﬂank, so that the fairy chime began again, and the
smack resounded like an accompaniment to its music. It was fairly
dark in the road; the misty dusk of evening was overshadowed by
the thick belt of chestnut, lime, and beech bounding the park by
the road-side; and the large horn lantern was handed to Alma to
aid her in gathering her parcels together, and its light fell upon her
bright dark eyes, and rosy, dimpled cheeks, making her appear more
than ever as if her gaudy dress was but a disguise assumed for a
frolic. Her almond-shaped, rather melancholy eyes sparkled as she
looked in the young carter’s stolid face, and thanked him heartily.
“I have had such a nice ride,” she added pleasantly, and the
horses one by one dropped a bell-note or two to emphasize her
words.
“You must gie I a toll for this yere ride,” returned William,
with a look of undisgnised but not rude admiration.
Alma ﬂushed, and drew back. “How much do you want?”
she asked, taking out her purse, and pretending not to understand.
“ You put that there in your pocket,” he replied, offended, “ and
gie I a kiss.”
“Indeed, I shall do nothing of the kind,” retorted Alma. “ Let
me get down. I’ll never ride with you again, if I walk till I drop
—that I won’t! ”
But the wagoner insisted on his toll, and vowed that she should
not descend till it was paid; and poor Alma protested and stormed
vainly, while J em leaned up against a horse and laughed, and ad-
jured her to make haste. Alma burst into tears, wrung her hands,
and wished that she had not been so obdurate to poor Charlie
J udkins. He would not have been so rude, she knew. Nor, in-
deed, would William have been so persistent had she not offended
him by her unlucky offer of money, and roused the dogged ohstinacy
of his class. She darted to the other side of the wagon, but in
vain; William was too quick, and she was just on the point of rais-
ing her voice in the hope that her father might be near, when a
light, ﬁrm step was heard issuing from the park-gates, and a clear
and singularly musical voice broke into the dispute with a tone of
authority.

“For shame, William Grove! ” it said. “How can you be so
cowardly? Let the girl go directly. Why, it is Alma Lee,
surely! "
CHAPTER II.
THE speaker emerged into the little circle of light cast by the
lantern—a slight, well-built, youthful ﬁgure of middle height yet
commanding presence, clad in dark gray, with a round, black straw
hat and aneat white necktie, the frequent costume of a country
curate in those days, when the clerical garb had not reached so
high a stage of evolution as at present. His beardless face made
him look still younger than he really was; his features were reﬁned
and clearly cut; his hair very dark; and his eyes, the most striking
feature of his face, were of that rare, dazzling light blue which can
only be compared to a cloudless noon sky in June, when the pale,
intense blue seems penetrated to overﬂowing with ﬂoods of vivid light.
“I waren’t doing no harm,” returned the wagoner, with a kind
of surly respect; “I gied she a ride, and she med so will gie I a.
kiss."
“And you a married man! ” cried the indignant young deacon;
“for shame! ”
“There ain‘t no harm in a kiss,” growled William, with a sheep-
ish, discomforted look, while he stood aside and suffered the new-
comer to help Alma in her descent.
“There is great harm in insulting a respectable young woman,
and taking advantage of her weakness. As for a kiss, it is not a
seemly thing between young people who have no claim on each
other, though there may be no positive harm in it. You ought to
know better, William.”
“ There ain’t no harm for the likes of we,” persisted the
wagoner. “ ’Tain’t as though Alma was a lady; she’s only a poor
man’s daughter.”
7 “And a poor man’s daughter has as much right to men’s respect
as a duchess,” cried the young fellow, with animation. “ I wonder
you can say such a thing, Grove. And you a poor man yourself,
with a little daughter of your ownl How would you like her to
he kissed against her will? ”

William muttered to the eﬂ‘ect that “Anybody med kiss she "—-
which was true enough, as she had seen but three summers yet——
and went on twining his whip with a cowed, injured look, while
Alma gazed in awed admiration at her handsome young champion,
whose kindling eyes seemed to send forth ﬂoods ‘of pale-blue light
in the gloom.
“There is something so unmanly in attacking a girl's self-
respect,” continued the eager champion. “I did not think you
capable of it, William. A stout fellow like you, a man I always
liked. Go home to your wife, and think better of it.—I will see
you across the meadow myself, Alma. though it is hard that a girl
can not be abroad alone at this hour.”
50 saying, the young Bayard possessed himself of sundry of
Alma’s parcels, and with a pleasant “Good-night, Jem,” turned
his back on the wagon and opened the gate, through which Alma
passed quickly, followed by her protector, while the cumhrous
wagon went on its way to the rhythmic jangle of the sweetly
clashing bells, and William trudged stolidly on with his accustomed
whip-crackings and guttural exclamations, murmuring from time to
time with a mortiﬁed air, “ There ain’t no harm in a kiss! ” And,
indeed, he meant no harm, though he took care not to relate the
incident to his wife; it was only his rough tribute to Alma‘s unac-
customed beauty, and signiﬁed no more than a gracefully turned
allusion in higher circles. “And Mr. Cyril must go a-spiling of
she,” he added. “as though she didn’t look too high already. But
pride goes before a fall, as I‘ve hcerd ’un zay.” Ominous repeti-
tion of J udkins’s words!
Alma, in the mean time, murmured her thanks to her chivalrous
protector, and stepped up the dewy meadow with a beating breast
and a ﬂushing check, her ears tingling with the words, “A poor
man‘s daughter has as much right to respect as a duchess,” her
heart swelling at the memory of the courtesy with which Maitland
handed her down from the wagon and carried half her parcels; she
knew that a veritable duchess would not have been treated with
more honor. All her life she had known Cyril Maitland. She had
sported with him over that very lea, where the tall yellow cowslips
nodded in spring, and where they had pelted each other with
sweet, heavy cowslip-balls; she had kissed and cuffed him many a
time, though he was always “Master Cyril ” to the coachman’a
child; and, as they grew up, had been inclined to discuss him

with a half-respectful, half-familiar disparagement, such as well-
known objects receive. Never till that fatal evening had his grace
of mind and person and the singular charm of his manner keenly
touched her. But when he stood there in the lantern’s dim rays,
looking so handsome and so animated by the impulsive chivalry
with which he defended her, and she heard the musical tones and
reﬁned accents of the voice pleading her cause and the cause of her
sex and her class, a new spirit came to her—a spirit of sweetness
and of terror, which set all her nerves quivering, and opened a new
world of wonder and beauty to her entranced gaze. As holy as a
young archangel, and as beautiful, he seemed to the simple girl’s
dazzled thoughts, and she felt that no harm could ever come to her
in that charmed presence, no pain ever touch her.
All unconscious of the tumult of half-conscious emotion awakene-
ing beside him, Cyril Maitland walked on, chatting with pleasant
ease on all sorts of homely topics, in no wise surprised at his com-
panion’s faltering, incoherent replies, which he attributed to the
embarrassment from which he had just delivered her. The dulcet
clashing of the bells grew fainter, and then rose on a sudden gust
of wind just as they reached the door of the strangely built white
house, before the square windows of which rose a small colonnade '
of white pillars. Alma opened the door, and a ruddy glow rushed
out upon her, while within a cheerful little home-scene presented
itself. A small table, covered with a clean white cloth, touched
with rose by the ﬁrelight, and spread with tea-things, was drawn
up before the glowing hearth, and a warm aroma of tea and toast
greeted the tired, hungry girl. Before the ﬁre sat a strong, middle-
aged man in an undress livery, consisting partly of a sleeved waist-
coat, busily engaged in making toast; while a neatly dressed woman
moved about the warm parlor, adding a few touches to the table.
“Just in time, Alma,” called out the man, without turning his
head.
“And a pretty time, too,” added the woman, who was Alma’s
step-mother. “ Why hadn’t you a come along with Charlie J udkins
this hour agone? Gadding about till it’s dark night— 0 Mr. Cyril,
I beg your pardon, sir! ” and she dropped a courtesy, while her hus-
band turned and rose.
“May I come in? ” asked Cyril, pausing, hat in hand, and smiling
his genial smile. “Your tea is very tempting, Mrs. Lee.”
“Come in and welcome, Master, Cyril,” said the coachman, as

Cyril, with the air of an accustomed guest, placed his hat on a side-
table adorned with the family Bible, Work-boxes, and tea-trays,
and took the chair Mrs. Lee handed him.
“Why, I’ve not had tea with you for an age,” continued Cyril,
stroking a large tabby cat, which sprang purring upon his knee the
moment he was seated; “ and I don’t deserve any now, since I come
straight from the drawing-room at Swaynestone, where the rites of
the tea-pot were being celebrated. But the ladies there have no
idea of tea-making, and I,only had two cups, and was tantalized
with a vague sketch of a piece of bread and butter.”
“ Well, you always were a rare one for tea, Master Cyril,” re-
turned his hostess. “If I had but known you were coming, I’d ’a
made some of them hot cakes. But there’s jam in plenty, some
blackberry as Alma made this fall.”
“Alma came by Long’s wagon,” he explained, when she had
withdrawn to lay aside her hat and shawl; “and as I chanced to
be at the gate when she got down, I saw her across the meadow.”
“Thank ’ee kindly, Master Cyril. I don’t like her to be out
alone at nights,” said Ben Lee, “though, to be sure, there’s only
our own people about on the estate.”
Before Alma’s mind there arose a vision of the Swaynestone
drawing-room as she had seen it once at tea-time when she was
summoned to speak to the young ladies about some needlework she
was doing for them. She saw in imagination the long range of win-
dows with their rich curtains; the mirrors and couches; the cabi-
nets ﬁlled with rare and costly bris-d-b'rac; the statuettes and pict-
ures; the painted ceiling of the long, lofty room ; the beautiful
chimney-piece of sculptured Parian marble; the rich glow from the
hearth throwing all kinds of warm reﬂections upon the splendid
apartment, and principally upon the little table, laden with silver
and priceless china, by the ﬁre; and the charming group of ladies
in their stylish dress and patrician beauty, half seen in the ﬁre-lit
dusk. It was a world of splendor to Alma’s unaccustomed eyes—a
place in which an ordinary mortal could in no wise sit down with
any comfort, without, indeed, a something almost amounting to
sacrilege; a world in which the perfume of hot-house ﬂowers took
away the bated breath, and in which no footfall dared echo, where
voices were low and musical, and manners full of courteous ease; a
world inhabited by beings untouched by common cares, with other
thoughts, and softer, more beautifully adorned lives ; a world which

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 17
Alma entered with a burdensome sense of being out of place, in
which she only spoke when spoken to, and where she heard herself
discussed as if she were a thing without hearing.
“ What! is this Lee’s daughter? " Lady Swayuestone had asked,
putting up her gold-rimmed glasses, and takingr a quiet survey of
Alma and her blushes.
“ Surely you remember little Alma Lee, mother,” Ethel Swayne-
stone replied. “ She has shot up, you see, like the rest of us.”
“ Ah, to be sure! How the time goes, Ethel! How is your
mother, Alma? And she is embroidering Maude’s handkerchiefs?
A very nice employment for a young woman. But I don‘t like her
gown; it is far too smart for a coachinan’s daughter.”
“ Nonsense, mother dear. Why shouldn’t she be smart, if she
likes? But if you want really to look nice, Alma, you must not
wear violet and pale blue together,” said the fair-haired Maude, with
a sweet look of interest in Alma’s appearance that won her heart,
wounded as it was by “her ladyship‘s ” want of consideration.
Very glad was Alma to retire from that august presence—almost
as glad as she had been to enter it. And Mr. Cyril had walked
straight from the splendid apartment, from the light of Miss Ethel
and Miss Maude’s eyes, and the sound of their sweet, cultured voices,
with a disparaging remark upon their tea, and chosen Alma’s own
humble every-day dwelling and homely meal in the narrow room in
preference. This ﬁlled her with a strange, indeﬁnable emotion,
half pleasure and half pain. Some instinct told her that he was the
same welcomed, admired guest there as here; that he spoke with
the same easy charm to Lady Swaynestone and her daughters and
the high-born visitors he chanced to meet there, as to her parents
and herself. And could her imagination have borne her into Cyril’s
future, she would have seen him, as he subsequently was, a wel-
comed frequent guest at royal tables, where his beautiful voice and
perfect manner east the same glamour over the palace atmosphere as
over that of the coachman’s little dwelling.
Quickly as Alma returned to the parlor, she yet found time to
arrange her rich hair and add a necklace of amber beads, thus im-
parting a kind of gypsy splendor to her dark face, and other little
triﬂes to her dress; and very handsome she looked in the ﬁrelight
—for the one candle but emphasized the gloom—with that new
sparkle in her eyes and ﬂush on her cheek. It was Cyril who rec~
ommended her to toast the sausages she had brought from Oldport
2

instead of trying them; he and Lilian had often cooked them so in
the school-room at home, he said, when Mrs. Lee demurred at trust-
ing to his culinary skill. It was Cyril also who suggested the agree-
able addition of cold potatoes warmed up.
“ Well, Master Cyril, I never thought to see you teach my wife
cooking,” laughed Ben, paying a practical compliment to his skill.
“Hand Master Cyril some tea, Alma; and do you taste the sau~
sages, my girl. Why, where’s your appetite after tramping all the
way into Oldport, and nothing but a bit of bread and cheese since
breakfast? You sha’n’t walk there and back again any more ; that
and the shopping is too much. And so you came along part of the
way in Long’s wagon, when you might have been tooled along by
the best horse in our stables, and J udkius ﬁt to cry about it.——Now,
don’t you call that silly, Mr. Cyril? ”
“ Every one to his taste, Ben. I prefer the dog-cart.”
“And it ain’t every day a girl like Alma gets a chance of riding
behind such a horse or beside such a young man,” added Mrs. Lee,
severely. “But there’s people as never knows where their bread’s
buttered.” ‘
“ There are people,” said Alma, with a toss of her graceful head,
“ as know what they’ve a mind to do, and do it.”
“And there’s headstrong girls as lives to repent,” retorted the
step-mother.
“Ay, you was always a willful one, Alma,” said her father;
“but if you don’t look out you’ll be a. old maid, and you won’t like
that. And a smarter fellow than Charlie J udkins never crossed a
horse. No drink with Charlie—goes to church regular, and has a
matter of ﬁfty pound in the bank, and puts by every week. And.
Sir Lionel ready to ﬁnd him a cottage and raise his wages when he
marries.”
“Well, let him marry, then," returned Alma, airily; “I don’t
want to prevent him. I dare say Mr. Cyril would be kind enough
to perform the ceremony if he wished it.”
“I should have the greatest pleasure, Alma, particularly if he
chose a certain friend of mine. For, as your father says, Charlie is
a really good fellow, as warm-hearted a man as I know, and de-
serves a good wife.”
“There are plenty of good wives to be had," returned Alma;
“no doubt Mr. Judkins will soon ﬁnd one, especially as he has so
many friends to put in a word for him.”

“ Ay, and he might have the pick of girls in Melbourne, and ﬁve
miles round,” added Mrs. Lee.
“ And Charlie won’t stand Alma’s hoity-toity airs much longer,”
chimed in her father. “ He was terrible angry this afternoon,
and talked about stuck-up fagots, he~ did. And you rising twenty-
two, and refused Mr. Ingram’s own man. I don’t know what ’d be
good enough for ye, Alma, I don’t without ‘twas Mr. Ingram hisself.
-—Ain’t she a willful one, Mr. Cyril? ”
“We mustn’t be hard upon her, Ben. She has a right to refuse
a man if she doesn’t care for him. But any girl might think twice
before refusing Charlie J udkins,” said Cyril, in his gentle, gracious
way.—“I was to tell you, Mrs. Lee,” he added, “that we are run-
ning short of eggs at the Rectory, and ask if your fowls were laying
enough to spare? ”
“ Ourn have mostly give over laying, but Mrs. Maitland shall
have a dozen so soon as Alma can get over to-morrow. Why, you
don’t bide at the Rectory now, sir? ”
“ No. I have rooms in my own parish at Shotover,” he replied ;
“ but I am always running in and out at home. It is only a mile
and a half, you know ; and Shotover is such a tiny parish, it leaves
us very idle.”
“That‘s well for your book-learning, Mr. Cyril. I reckon you
have to know a good deal more before you can be priested next
Trinity. When are ye coming over to Malbourne to preach to we? ”
“ 0h, not for a long while, Ben. I feel as if I could never have
the assurance to preach to all you grave and reverend seigniors. I
don’t even preach at Shotover, if I can help it," he replied, with an
air of ingenuous modesty that became him well.
“You mun get over that, sir," continued Ben ; “you mun think
of Timothy. He was to let no man despise his youth, you mind.”
“Certainly, Ben. But I have only been ordained three months,
and I may well hold my tongue till I have learned a little wisdom.
Ah, Ben, you can’t imagine what a dreadful ordeal it is to preach
one’s ﬁrst sermon l I feel cold water running down my back when
I think of it. They say my face was whiter than my surplice, and
my voice sounded so loud and strange in my ears I thought it must
frighten people, instead of which they could scarcely hear me.”
“ Lauk-a-mercy, Mr. Cyril, you’ll soon get over that,” said Mrs.
Lee, in a tone of consolation. “ That’s just how I felt the ﬁrst time
I acted parlor-maid, Jane being took ill, and a party to dinner, and

I housemaid. You mid a seen the glasses knock up agen the de-
canter when I ﬁlled them, the jellies all a-tremble with the palpita-
tions—mot to mention the ﬁrst time I walked into Mulbourne Church
with Lee, and made sure I should a dropped every step I took up
the aisle, and all them boys staring, and your pa beginning ‘the
wicked man.’ But law] I thinks nothing of it now.”
“ You may still hear my teeth chatter in Shotover Church, nev-
ertheless, Mrs. Lee,” replied Cyril, softly stroking the cat, which
still nestled purring on his knee, and casting an amused glance on
Mrs. Lee and on Alma, whose face expressed the most sympathetic
interest. “But, as you say, I shall get over it in time. And indeed,
if the congregation consisted of Alma, and Lilian, and Mr. Ingram
Swaynestone, and his sisters, I shouldn‘t mind preaching at Mal-
bourne. Fellow-sinners of my own age are not so appalling.”
“Ay, with a head like yourn, you med be a bishop some day,”
observed Lee, thoughtfully. “ What‘s this yere thing they made ye
at college? somat to do with qnarreling? "
“A Wrangler.”
“ Ah! You may depend upon it, it’s a ﬁne thing to be a wran-
gler. Mr. Ingram, now, they only made he a rustic; but he was at
t’other place—Oxford, they calls it.”
“He was rusticated,” said Cyril, gravely. “That is not so ad-
vantageous as being made a Wrangler.”
“You see, I was right, after all, mother,” Alma interposed;
“and you always would have it that Mr. Cyril was a mangler. As
if they had mangles at Cambridgel ”
“You’d better be less forward with your tongue, and get on
with your vittles, miss. Why, bless the girl, she’s eat nothing, and
if that ain’t the third time shelve put sugar into the milk-jug by
mistakel—Why, father, whatever’s come to her? ”
Alma blushed prettily, but her confusion almost amounted to
distress; and Cyril, with his ready tact, again drew attention from
her.
“You must not imagine,” he said, “that I have to pass my time
in strife and dissension because I am a Wrangler. Quite the con-
trary. Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Lee—Good night, Ben ” ; and,
placing the cat very gently on the warm hearth, and shaking hands
with his hosts, Cyril rose, took his hat, and followed Alma out into
the darkness.
She bore the candle, and by its light guided him to the little

wicket at the end of the garden, where, with a courtesy, she bid him
good night.
“ Good night, Alma,” he returned carelessly, and stepped briskly
down the dark meadow, the grass of which was crisped now by
frost; while Alma remained at the wicket, that he might have the
beneﬁt of the candle’s feeble ray.
When he was half-way across, he suddenly stopped and turned.
“ 0 Alma!” he cried, retracing his steps, when she looked up
with startled inquiry in his face, “I quite forgot the very thing I
came for." Here he paused, overcome with surprise at the vivid,
tense expression of Alma’s bright face, and a ray of illumination
shot over the something he had observed in the house, the absent
manner and the lack of appetite, and accounted for her disparage
ment of the enamored Judkins. By these signs he knew that Alma
was in love with some other swain. “I quite forgot Miss Lilian‘s
message to you. My sister is getting up a Bible-class for young
women, and she wishes you to join. She is to hold it in her room
at the Rectory after even-song on Sunday afternoons. Will you
come? ”
“ Oh, I don’t know, Mr. Oyrill You see, I should be dark home
these winter nights,” returned Alma, hesitating and blushing, and
looking up at Cyril and down on the frosted grass and up again.
“Well, you can talk it over with Miss Lilian when you bring
the eggs. I think we might get over the difﬁculty of getting home
in the dark. If that was all, I might see you home myself.”
“ 0 Mr. Cyril! ”
There was a quiver and ﬂash and illumination in the words and
look of the simple, unconscious girl which shot like electric ﬂame
through her interlocutor’s frame, and made him speechless. The
blue radiance from his eyes mingled for a moment with the dark
ﬁre of Alma’s, and a strange, unaccustomed tremor, that was not
all pain, set his pulses beating as they were not used to beat, and
stirred all the currents of his blood.
“Good night, Alma,” he said shortly, and in a voice so unlike
his own that the girl stood petriﬁed in pained amazement; and he
turned, and sped swiftly over the crisp grass to the gate, glad to be
out of the inﬂuence of the solitary candle’s dim light.
He let the gate fall-t0 with a clash which made it vibrate back-
ward and forward for some minutes before it found rest, and strode
rapidly over the dark highway beneath the trees.


## p. 22 (#28) ##############################################

22 THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND.
“ What have I done? ” he muttered, with a beating heart. “0
my God! I meant no harm. What have I done? ”
Yet the warm, delicious glow still lingered, paining him, in his
breast, and he strode on with his head bent down, humbled and
wretched. His soul was yet spotless as the untrodden snow; all
his hopes and tastes were innocent; the ﬁerce ﬂame of temptation
had never yet cast its scorching glare upon him, hitherto he had
deemed himself invulnerable. In his trouble he put his hand in-
stinctively in his pockets, where nestled as usual the rubbed covers
of his “ Visitatious and Prayers for the Sick,” and other devotional
books, and was comforted. He lifted his head, and felt in his
breast-pocket for a letter, the pressure of which, though he could
not read it beneath that dark dome of solid night, fully restored the
serenity to his face. It began, “ Dearest Cyril,” and ended, “Ever
aﬁectionately yours, Marion Everard ”; it alluded to the pains of
separation, and the hopes expressed by Cyril of a possible marriage
in a year’s time.
They had been engaged a whole year, and the necessity of wait-
ing another year before marriage was the tragedy of their young
lives. A year seemed an eternity to them, and the life they passed
apart from each other no life. A vision of Marion’s gentle face
brightened the curtain of thick darkness spread before Cyril. He
recalled her tones and looks with a rush of sweet aﬁ'ection—all the
tender looks she had ever given him, and they were many ; but he
could not recall any one look that resembled the glance of fervid,
unquenchable passion which ﬂashed from Alma’s tell-tale eyes in
that fatal moment at the gate. Such a look he had beheld in no
woman’s eyes; such a look, he feared, in the narrowness of his se—
rene purity, could light no good woman’s eyes.
He was wrong. The ﬂame which burned in poor, innocent Alma’s
breast, and which her guileless nature so rasth and unconsciously
betrayed, descended like a celestial glory upon her life with a puri-
fying and strengthening power, which could have lifted her to un-
imagined summits of heroism.
There are people whose lives are never touched by passion, and
who, when they come in contact with it, recognize only its strength,
which they dread, and condemn its mysteries as baleful. Such was
Cyril in these white young days of his before any shadow fell upon
his sunny, safe path. Such was not Cyril in after days, when the
agony of the penitent and the evil-deer found a responsive echo in

his heart, and made him pitiful and lenient in judging character and
discriminating motives. But to-night, in spite of the momentary
glow for which he so despised himself, he drew the robe of the
Pharisee about his upright soul, and cast a stone of condemnation
upon the suﬁerer as he passed her swiftly by.
Alma remained statue-like, with her solitary light painting a
feeble halo on the all-encompassing gloom, until Cyril’s steps had
ceased to echo along the lonely highway, and her mother called to
her to bring back the candle and shut the door.
As soon as she had obeyed, she found a pretext for going to her
room, and there, sitting down on the edge of the bed in the dark,
she burst into tears.
“ I am tired, and William Grove frightened me,” she said to her-
self; and a few minutes later she was at needlework in the parlor,
singing like any wild bird.
CHAPTER III.
A WARM glimmer of ruddy light on the thick darkness told
Cyril of the approach of the wheelwright’s house and shop, and,
passing this and descending the hill, he became aware of the rich
crimson which marked the lower windows of the Sun inn, and
found himself at the end of the wheelwright’s yard, at the meeting
of four roads. Opposite the Sun, and colored by its light, a. sign-
post reared itself at the corner, oblique, and appearing to gesticulate
madly with its outspread arms. This corner turned, all the village
sparkled out in a little constellation of cottage easements before his
gaze; and there, beyond the brook, which murmured faintly in the
stillness, the Rectory windows shone out among masses of foliage,
or rather of branches, behind which the gray church-spire lifted
itself unseen in the mirk. As soon as Cyril’s foot was within the
gate, a sudden illumination from the hall door, which simultaneously
opened, poured itself upon the drive, and showed him the outline
of a woman’s young and graceful ﬁgure in the porch.
“Did you hear me coming, Lilian?” asked he, entering the
house. “ Your hearing must indeed be acute.”
“ Did we hear him, Mark Antony? ” echoed Lilian, addressing a
magniﬁcent black cat, with white breast and paws, which had been

sitting upon the step at her feet, and gazing with grave expectancy
down the drive till Cyril reached the door, when he rose, and re-
spectfully greeted him with elevated tail and gentle mews, inter-
spersed with purring. “ You know that puss and I have an extra
sense, which tells us when you are coming,” she replied lightly, as
she passed her arm through his, and led him through the little hall
into the drawing-room, on the threshold of which a terrier and a
pug sprang out to greet the new-comer with short barks of joy and
sudden bounds and various Wild expressions of delight—an indis-
creet behavior quietly rebuked by two swift but digniﬁed strokes of
Mark Antony‘s white velvet paw, which sent the heedless animals,
with dismal yelps and mortiﬁed tails, to a respectful distance.
A lady lay on a sofa near the ﬁre, and a boy and a girl of some
eight and nine years rolled on the hearth-rug with some toys. These
children, with Cyril and Lilian, who were twins, constituted the
sole remainder of Mrs. Maitland’s once too numerous family. What
with bearing and rearing them all, and the sorrow of losing so
many, her strength was now exhausted, and the prime of her life
was passed chieﬂy on that sofa, among its warm rugs. Cyril bent
to kiss her, and a look of pride and joy lighted her pale, reﬁned face
as she gazed upon him.
The children sprang upon Cyril, and be, having caressed them,
took a seat by Lilian, who was at the writing-table, from which she
had risen on his approach.
“ Will it do?” he asked, gazing upon some manuscript before
her.
“I think so,” she replied. “ I have drawn a line through the
most ornate passages. But you must really try and adapt yourself
to your congregation, Cyril. This goes completely over their
heads. Be less elaborate, and speak from your heart, simply and
honestly.”
“The discipline which turns out Wranglers,” observed Cyril,
with a dry little smile, “ does not train popular rustic preachers.”
“ Cyril’s sermons again? ” asked Mrs. Maitland. “Lilian should
compose them entirely, I think. And yet I am wrong, for I doubt
if either of you could do anything without the other.”
The twins smiled, knowing this to be perfectly true. They were
alike, and yet diﬁerent. Lilian’s features were fuller than Cyril’s;
her eyes softer and of a gray color, but they met the gazer with an
even more powerful electric thrill than Cyril’s light blue orbs; her

hair was many shades lighter than her brother’s; and while Cyril
could not appear in any assembly without exciting interest and
drawing all eyes to himself, Lilian had a peculiar manner of pervad-
ing places without attracting the slightest observation. Gradually
one became aware of an inﬂuence, and only after a long time dis-
covered the personage from whom it emanated.
No one ever praised Lilian’s beauty, though she possessed all
the elements of loveliness. She shared Cyril’s musical voice, but
lacked its more powerful and penetrating tones. Cyril had beau-
tifully shaped hands, but Lilian’s were like two fair spirits, and
formed the only striking part of her personality; they were the
ﬁrst thing the stranger observed in her, and, once observed, they
were never for a moment forgotten. The twins had shared every-
thing from their babyhood. The same tutor demanded equal tasks
of brother and sister; and when Cambridge separated them, Lilian
still followed the course of her brother’s studies, and would doubt-
less have been a high wrangler, had she been submitted to the same
tests as he. The peculiar bond between them was respected and
acknowledged even by Mark Antony, who was, as his mistress fre-
quently observed, a cat of considerable force of character. Besides
Lilian, Cyril was the only human being Mark Antony ever followed
or fawned upon, and it was supposed that his very strong affections
were entirely bestowed upon the twins.
To strangers this cat was haughtin indifferent; and, if a visitor
took such a liberty as to stroke his ebon far, would rise and walk
away with offended majesty. To the family he observed a distant
but eminently courteous demeanor; to the servants he was conde-
scending; to the children polite, but never familiar, their respectful
caresses being received with digniﬁed resignation, and never suffered
to go beyond a certain point; his bearing to the dogs was that of a
despot. He was a great warrior, and suffered no other cat to in-
trude so much as a paw on the Rectory grounds; hence his name.
He never left Lilian while she was in the house, and at certain
seasons exacted games of play from her, scorning to play with any
one else, save occasionally when he unbent so far as to entangle
himself wildly in Winnie’s curls, to the great consternation of the
(logs. But Cyril might do anything with him, and could never do
wrong. In this Mark Antony differed from his mistress, since Cyril
was the only person with whom she ever quarreled, the two having
had many a pitched battle in their childhood, though they always

stood up for each other to such an extent that, if one was punished
by the deprivation of pudding, the other was permitted to go on
half rations with the delinquent, and to give one an orange meant
to give each half a one.
“Did you tell him that the Everards were here this afternoon? "
Mrs. Maitland added, the personal pronoun being considered sufﬁ-
cient indication to Lilian of her brother, while “ her " in addressing
Cyril was known to mean Lilian.
“Were they, indeed? and I away, of course,” grumbled
Cyril.
“You may guess Marion’s message," laughed Lilian, in a low
aside, at which Cyril looked pleased.
“Well, mother, and the news? " he added.
“ Henry's long silence is satisfactorily explained.”
“Satisfactorily? O motherl—and he has been at death’s
door! ” interrupted Lilian.
“Ill? Everard? I knew there must be something very seri-
ous,” ejaculated Cyril. “But he is better? ”
“ He is convalescent, dear. He is a noble, unselﬁsh fellow, as I
always knew when he was but a tiny boy! He would not let his
friends be written to until he was completely out of danger. There
was a child dangerously ill of scarlet fever in some dreadful court
in Seven Dials. He was too ill to be moved, and had a bad,
drunken mother, and Henry watched him for several nights, reliev-
ing guard with a day nurse. By the time the child was out of
danger Henry was raving—"
“Then, why,” interrupted Cyril, with agitation, “were we not
told ’I ”
“ He had foreseen his delirium, and forbidden any communica-
tion till he died or recovered. He knew full well that nothing
would have kept Marion from him, had she known—”
“ He was right! ” broke in Cyril, in a low, fervid tone. “ Thank
Heaven that he thought of that! ”
“Henry always thinks of everything that may affect the welfare
of his friends,” added Lilian, whose face wore a look of quiet en-
thusiasm, and whose dark gray eyes Were shining with repressed
tears.
“And now?” added Cyril, with energy. “They will not let
Marion go to him now, I hope. rlv‘he convalescent stage is the most
infectious.”

“They will not meet until Henry is perfectly free from infec-
tion. You may trust Henry for that, Cyril.”
“ He has been very ill," said Lilian; “ they feared he would be
both blind and deaf. It will be months before he can recover,
though the infectious stage is already nearly past."
“Poor old Everard! that will be a terrible trial for him with
his ambition. Time is so precious to a man who is beginning his“
career.”
“ I suspect he has been working too hard,” said Mrs. Maitland,
“and the enforced rest to his brain may beneﬁt him more than
they think. Admiral Everard is ordered to the Mediterranean with
the squadron in a few weeks’ time, and, a winter abroad being
necessary for Henry, he is to go in the Greasy to Malta, from whence
he will afterward go to other places—Egypt and the Holy Land
among them—and Marion is to be his companion.”
“Marion? What! Marion spend the winter abroad? Impos-
siblel She shall not go.”
“ You are not married yet, Cyril,” said Lilian, laughing.
“ My dear boy, why should Marion not go? ” asked his mother,
in surprise. “She is delighted at the prospect. It is perhaps the
only chance she will have of going abroad for any length of time.
Once married, a girl can not see much of the world, as the admiral
says, and a country curate’s wife is especially bound to home.”
“ And do you suppose, mother, that I shall always be a country
curate? ” asked Cyril, with ﬁre. “No, indeed. My wife will have
as many opportunities of seeing the world as any one, I trust. But
she can not, she must not leave me all this winter. I simply can
not spare her.” '
“And Henry—can he spare her? ” asked Lilian.
“She is not engaged to Henry. Let Henry get a wife of his
own.”
“My dear Cyril, how absurdly you talk! ” said Mrs. Maitland,
“ You forget that Henry is an invalid, and will need his sister‘s
care. And you forget, too, that Marion is looking forward with
the greatest delight to this unexpected trip.”
“ The only lady on board—on board a man-of-warl ”
“And awful fun, too,” interposed the boy on the rug. “I only
wish I was ill, and the admiral would take me.”
“Well, Lennie, you would be a more appropriate passenger,
certainly. The admiral had better take us all, I think. Snip, the

terrier, and Snap, the pug, with Mark Antony to catch the mice
and keep us in order.”
“But Marion is not going in the Greasy,” interposed Lilian.
“There was some idea of her going at ﬁrst. It seems, however,
that ladies are not supposed to sail with their relations.”
“I was beginning to wonder whether the admiral purposed
’ carrying a regular Noak’s ark about with him,” grumbled Cyril.
“And pray, how does Marion get to Malta unless in the Greasy?
By balloon? or does she charter a vessel of her owni ”
“ She goes with the Wilmots, Overland by Marseilles. Captain
Wilmot is joining his regiment at Malta. They stop at Paris and
other places, taking it leisurely, and that will be delightful to
Marion, who has traveled so little.”
“It seems, then, after all, that Henry will have to do without
Marion till he reaches Malta,” said Cyril.
" But he will have his father, and, of course, a proper attendant
on board. At Malta he will be thrown on his own resources, and
will need a companion. They will take care of. each other,” Mrs.
Maitland replied cheerfully. “ They think of coming home by way
of Sicily.”
“I shall go to Woodlands to-morrow, and remonstrate with the
admiral if he is there. I shall take the pony-chaise, unless you
want it, Lilian.”
' “Nonsense, Cylll You may go to the Woodlands and take the
pony, but you will not remonstrate with the admiral, or make your-
self in any way obnoxious,” said Lilian. “When you come to re-
ﬂect, you will see what a charming arrangement it is for every-
body. The admiral is the more delighted, as he thinks this voyage
will make Henry so desperately in love with the navy that he will
become a naval surgeon.”
“Hang the admiral! ” observed Cyril, in his softest, most plain-
tive voice, while a droll little smile curved his lips. “ Why doesn’t
somebody pity me? Isn‘t it hard lines, Mark Antony? ”
Mark Antony responded by a tiny mew. He was sitting on
the writing-table between his twin favorites, the picture of feline
bliss; his tail curled round his dainty white paws, his snowy breast
tinted by the ruddy ﬁre-light, his eyes lazily closing and nnolosing,
while he made rhythmic accompaniment to their voices in deep,
long-drawn purrs, and expressed a benevolent and condescending
interest in the conversation by occasional winks and movements in

THE SILENCE OF DEAN JIAITLAND. 29
the direction of brother or sister, as each spoke. He had inspected
and thoroughly sniﬁ‘ed Cyril’s sermon with an air of approving
criticism.
“Mark Antony was most condescending to Marion this after~
noon," said Lilian; “he not only purred affany when she stroked
him, but even allowed her to kiss him on the breast.”
Whereupon Cyril bestowed a salute on the same spot, com-
mending the cat‘s sagacity in thus recognizing Marion as one of
the family. Mark Antony drew himself up with gratiﬁed pride,
and returned his friend’s caress by lifting his velvet paw, placing
his head on one side with an arch, roguish expression in his spark-
ling eyes and bristled white whiskers, and chucking Cyril under
the chin with the daintiest grace, to the envy and delight of the
children, who worshiped this household divinity at a distance;
the jealous disgust of the dogs, who were sleeping with one eye
open, after the manner of their tribe, and growled faintly; and the
admiration of the whole family, who knew that this delicate caress
was never accorded save to the twins.
“ No one seems to have thought of me in this matter,” observed
Cyril, stroking the delighted animal. “I shall certainly stand up
for my rights. This notion of sacriﬁcing Marion, and sending her
half the world over in charge of an invalid brother, is too detest-
able. Her sisters should interfere; they stand in the place of a
mother to her.”
“Married sisters have little inﬂuence on home affairs, fortu-
nately for Marion’s freedom in the choice of a husband,” Mrs. Mait-
land said, laughing.
“Well, it grows late," said Cyril, rising. “By the way, I did
your errands at Lee’s. The eggs and the pupil are to arrive to-
morrow morning.”
“I am so glad you remembered,“ replied Lilian; “I have the
greatest desire to gain some inﬂuence over Alma Lee. Do you
know, Cyril, she is a girl of no common character. No one in the
least suspects what that girl is capable of.”
“What, Lill, have you unearthed another genius? ” asked Cyril,
carelessly.
“Oh, no; no genius. But the next time you see her, observe
the way-in which her eye ﬂashes, and the mobility of her features.
Poor Alma! she is so liable to fall into temptation, with her beauty
and ignorance, and passionate, undisciplined nature. There are

ﬁne elements in her, deep feeling, strong imagination, and capa-
bility of self-sacriﬁce. How she tended that poor little step-sister
of hers! Lucy was fearfully afﬂicted. Her own mother shrank
from her at times; but Alma, never. Yet she is very wayward,
and so spoiled. Her nature is powerful for evil and good. N oth-
ing but strong principle can keep such a nature straight.”
Cyril listened, looking thoughtfully toward the ﬁre, with his
hand shading his eyes from its light.
“ My sister is a profound student of human nature, mother,” he
observed lightly. “She is right in saying that Miss Alma has a
will of her own—Let us hope you will succeed in putting a curb on
this unbridled nature, Lilian. You are quite right in your analysis
of it. But I am not sure that a Bible-class is the panacea you im-
agine. To move Alma Lee, I think you must appeal to her affec-
tions."
“She is frightfully vain, poor girll” interposed Mrs. Maitland.
“If you could induce her to dress more quietly, Lilian l ”
“I am not so much afraid of her vanity, mother. As Cyril says,
her affections must be got at, and I want to make my Bible-class a
means to that end.”
“Just listen to the parish priest! ” laughed Cyril; “ she talks
like a book. She is worth ten curates to my father. The time I
have wasted, as usual; it is past seven! Good night, Lennie. Have
you earned the half-crown yet? No? Lazy fellow. You will
never be able to own a menagerie as you wish, unless you work
harder. You may still get the half-crown if you bring me a fable
of La Fontaiue's, in decent Latin, remember. Winnie has fully
earned hers, and here it is, brand now. Good night, mother.
Father will be home at eight, he bid me tell you. Good night,
Lilian.” And, having been duly taken leave of by the dogs, Cyril
left the drawing-room, accompanied to the door by Lilian and Mark
Antony, the latter ﬂourishing his tail aloft with due ceremony, and
remaining seated on the step at Lilian’s feet, watching till the young
man’s form was swallowed up in the wintry gloom.
“Cyril appears anxious to be married,” Mrs. Maitland observed,
on Lilian’s return to the drawing-room. “It is a very strong at-
tachment, and well placed, fortunately for the dear boy. His anx-
iety about Marion actually made him forget Henry’s peril and the
heroism which brought it upon him. Love is stronger than friend-
ship.”

“ Cyril is very impulsive,” replied Lilian, “and, like all impulsive
people, is in a desperate hurry about everything. An early mar-
riage is the thing to give balance to such a temperament.”
“Dear child,” remonstrated her mother, “I do not think he
needs balance. I may be a foolish old woman,” she added, smiling,
“but I can see no fault in Cyril. Neither can your father. I wish
he had wider scope for his ﬁne talents. To cramp a young fellow
of his splendid powers and attainments in that narrow country
parish seems such a deplorable waste of good material. I see, too,
that the bondage chafes him."
Lilian made no reply, but looked thoughtfully at the ﬁre, sooth-
ing some inward perturbation by stroking and restroking Mark
Antony, who sat purring with an expression of imbecile rapture on
her knee.
Cyril meanwhile made his way through the foggy darkness of
the country roads to his rooms in the tiny village where lay his
cure, vexed and cogitating upon every possible means of keeping
Marion in England.
His dinner was ready—a simple chop, but cooked and served in
the daintiest perfection, and accompanied by a bottle of claret of a
delicate vintage. Some late ﬂowers and a dish of autumn fruit
garnished his table, all the appointments of which were elegant and
reﬁned. Nothing in the simple little lattice-windowed room could
offend the most fastidious taste, though it was rather bare, and its
easiest chair would haVe been full of penance to some people’s limbs.
Two proof line-engravings, after Raphael, were its sole adornments,
unless we include a great many books, most of which were well
bound, and a harmonium. His solitary meal ended, Cyril’s land-
lady brought him some coffee, made as English coffee rarely is, and
served in a lovely, cup of Sévres, the gift of Marion Everard, and
acquainted him with the fact that an old woman had sent three
times that day, requesting him to come and read to her, as she was
taken worse.
“I’ll go directly,” replied Cyril. “ Poor old soull I’m so sorry
I was out when she sent ”; and he started from his seat to get his
hat. Then it struck him that he had better drink the coffee while
it was hot, and he sat down again, and fell into a reverie. experi-
encing the delicious physical languor which comes after much air
and exercise and the satisfaction of a temperate appetite, and which
is so favorable to a certain kind of mental occupation. He looked

wistfully at a volume of St. Augustine, which lay ready to his hand,
and then at his watch. “ It is too late for Martha Hale to-night,”
he reﬂected; “and, after all, what 'good can I do her? Her life
has been a combination of a martyr’s and a saint's; she has the
Bible at her ﬁngers’ ends, and caught me tripping in a quotation
twice the other day. Her spiritual knowledge is such as I can only
dimly guess at. I can tell her nothing that she does not know ﬁve
times as well as I. Her daughter reads to her by the hour. She
has no sins to confess, no doubts to calm. And it would be a sin
to disturb her at this time of night.” And he ﬁnished the coffee,
and was soon lost in St. Augustine’s “ City of God,” which he closed
at last at about the time when Martha Hale’s radiant soul ﬂitted
from its worn and suffering tenement. Then he slept as youth
sleeps, Marion’s sweet face ﬂitting through his dreams, and her
voice making melody to an accompaniment of sweetly clashing peals
of the bell-music from Long’s wagon team.
CHAPTER IV.
RATHER more than a year after Alma Lee’s evening ride in the
wagon, a railway carriage containing two travelers was speeding
southward through the wintry air, with din and rattle and smoke
in the wake of the red-eyed engine, which panted, groaned, and
throbbed as with the agony of some vexed demon.
The travelers were men in the heyday of youth, and their com-
fortable rugs, and the array of books and papers with which they
were surrounded in the well-padded carriage, marked them as among
' those fortunate sons of earth who are absolved from the labor of
carefully considering sixpences and shillings before converting them
into things of convenience or pleasure. An odor as of a recently
evanished cigar of ﬁne ﬂavor further emphasized their emancipation
from the slavery of petty economies, though a practiced observer
would never for a moment have classed them in the ranks of those
gilded youth who are exempted from the blessed curse of labor,
and at liberty to squander the rich prime of their strength on pleas~
nres and follies as they will. No; they were evidently two young
men of the cultured middle class, bred in comfort, if not luxury,

but with their own standing yet to make—a truly happy position
for a youth of average thews and sinews.
They eat in opposite corners, with their legs stretched out be-
neath their warm rugs, one looking backward at the swiftly receding
perspective of trees and ﬁelds, villages and farmsteads, ﬂashing and
fading on the sight; the other facing forward to the yet unseen,
but seeing it not, since he was fast asleep. Fast asleep, unconscious
and peaceful as any babe on its mother’s breast, he was speeding
on without fear to a fate which in his wildest dreams he could
never have pictured, and which, could it have been shadowed forth
ever so dimly to him, he would have dismissed with laughing scorn
as utterly improbable—nay, impossible. Yet the train rushed on
with pant and puff and clatter, hearing him nearer and nearer to
the hidden terror with every quiet breath he drew in his secure
slumbers, while pleasant fancies of the present and warm hopes of
the future wove themselves into fantastic images in his light dreams.
His was a well-built, manly form, and his sleeping face, with all its
placid calm, was full of latent energy and bright intellect; a strong,
serene face, with ﬁrm lips and chin, the face of a man who could
do and endure much; a face expressive of healthy vigor of both
mind and body, though it bore traces of fatigue, which the soft
touches of sleep were every moment erasing.
His wakeful companion was a clergyman, a man whose mobile
and ﬁnely cut features, and eyes full of intense blue light, were ex-
pressive of something akin to genius; a man whose delicately or-
ganized nature could be touched, the observer would imagine, only
to the ﬁnest issues.
A world of thought and care sat on the young priest‘s brow, and
the look which he bent on the fast-receding ﬁelds was so profoundly
sad, that it would seem as if happiness could never again smile on
him. None of the layman’s calm strength and wholesome serenity
was his; such power as his face expressed would come in lightning
ﬂashes of brief but keen intensity. All nerve, ﬁre, imagination, and
feeling, was this young spirit apparently; capable of descending to
the lowest depths of snﬁering, or rising to the very airiest summits
of enthusiasm. It was an eminently beautiful and spiritual young
face, and one which never failed to awaken interest, if not love.
He looked very worn and fatigued; but no merciful wing of sleep
came to fan the trouble from his brow, while his companion slept so
serenely and dreamed so pleasantly.

In one hand he held a little book with red edges, but, instead of
consulting its pages, his eyes were bent ﬁxedly on the ﬂying wintry
landscape, which, nevertheless, they saw not, their gaze of intense
abstraction being turned inward upon some unspeakable sorrow.
His face was in the shadow, while some rays of wintry sunlight
fell upon the sleeper’s face, touched the brown mustache with tints
of gold, and ﬁnally dazzled the closed eyes to wakefulness. They
were very pleasant eyes when opened—honest, hazel eyes, looking
directly and kindly upon the world, and suggesting the sunshine of
wholesome mirth in their depths; shrewd eyes, for they had seen
many varieties of human beings in the course of six and twenty
years, and were not easily deceived.
“ Upon my word," observed the owner of the eyes, “I think I
must have forgotten myself for a moment, Cyril.”
At the ﬁrst sound of his voice all the sadness vanished from the
young priest’s face; the mournfully brooding eyes left the landscape,
and ﬂashed a gay brilliance upon the face in the sunshine; the
ﬁnely molded lips lost their drooping curve in a smile; the dejected
attitude became one of alert repose; the whole man was changed.
“You may have forgotten yourself, old fellow, but it was im'
possible for any one else to forget you with that dulcet harmony of
yours resounding through the brain,” he replied.
“ Come, now, that’s a libel; I never snore,” returned the other,
with a hearty yawn that brought the tears into his eyes; “and if I
did. you might forgive me, since you were not preaching.” \
“ There are some sermons of mine just over your head, Everard;
who knows but some lulling inﬂuence may have emanated from
them i ”
“ ‘ He jests at scars that never felt a wound.’ You sconndrel,
you know very well that the sleep of the just is murdered the
.moment you begin thumping the pulpit-cushion," said Everard,
with a banter which veiled an honest enthusiasm for his friend’s
gifts.
“I suppose I ought to say something neat with regard to the
elegance with which you take off people’s legs and tie up their ar-
teries. But, you see, my ignorance is so total—”
“ Exactly. Genius in our profession is known only to the ini-
tiated, while in yours it is impossible to hide its light under a bushel.
Lucky fellows, you parsons. Not the minutest spark of werth in
you escapes observation."

“You have hit on the weak point in our profession, Henry,”
said Cyril; dropping his air of banter. “ Seriously, it is a very aw-
ful thing to be placed as we are in the full light of public observa-
.tion, all our weaknesses, failings, and errors heightened by its glare,
and doing—oh, the smallest of them l—such worlds and worlds of
harm.”
“ Stuﬁ, Maitlandl 'That is where you persons err. You think
too much of your example and inﬂuence' You don’t suppose, man,
that we think you superior to human weaknesses? Not a bit of it;
we should loathe you if we did. For goodness’ sake, Cyril, don’t
take up with these superﬁne priestly notions. By the way, why
didn’t you go to sleep? You look as if you wanted it badly enough.
Have you got some infernal machine secreted under your waistcoat,
to wake you with a timely dig in case you succumb to nature’s
weakness, according to the rule of St. What’s-his-name’l ”
“ My dear fellow,” returned the other, with a pained look,
“ you mean’ no harm, but you handle certain subjects with a lev-
ity____n
“ Come now, Cyril, we are not treading on holy ground. Your
'conscience and feelings are in a state of hyper-sesthesia; you have
been working too hard. I didn’t mean that parsons were not
expected to practice what they. preach a little more precisely than
other men, or that any grave lapse on their part is not worse in
them than in others. But I object to this morbid self-conscious-
ness and conscience-searching. Surely a clergyman who is honest
in his faith ought to be able to lead a Christian’s life with sufﬁcient
ease to prevent him from torturing himself about the effect of his
peccadilloes, which are all taken for granted, on his ﬂock.”
> “There are no peceadilloes for us,” returned Cyril, with a deep
sigh. “ But now, Henry, let me speak out my anxiety about you as
a friend merely, not as a priest. Many things you have said lately
have grieved me deeply—”
“ Oh, I knowl Because I don’t believe in the devil, I am in a
parlous state. You priests have a great tenderness for that absurd
old devil of yours. Beg his pardon; I will speak more respectfully
of him in future. Drive on.”
‘ “Your profession,” pursued Maitland. with a look of shocked
forbearance, “is a noble one ; nay, in some respects it is more noble
than the priesthood itself, though lacking the special stamp of sane-
tity that it bears. It is more noble because it involves so much

more self-sacriﬁce. But it is one beset with special and awful dau-
gers. Your minds are so constantly set upon the material, that it
is no wonder if you are tempted to lose sight of the spiritual.”
“ That I admit,” returned Everard.
“You risk your souls that you may heal our bodies, and the
Italian proverb, ‘ Where there are three doctors there are two athe-
ists,’ is daily veriﬁed.”
“ Granted. But I am not one of the atheists, happily for me.”
“ Not yet; but I tremble for you, Henry. That light tone
grows upon you. And you reason every day more and more from
the point of view of the man of science. You learn more and more
to distrust everything that can not be proved by the evidence of the
senses-J
“ Of reason.”
“It amounts to the same thing. Will you promise to pray
against this, Henry ? ” asked Cyril, with intense supplication.
“ My friend,” returned the other, with a slight shake of his
body, like that a dog gives in issuing from the water, “ you accused
me just now of treating sacred things with levity. N ow your
words jar upon my sense of reverence, which is strangely different
in a priest and a layman. You are accustomed, you see, to handle
religious topics freely. I am not. _ And as I have no words to ex-
press them in, I would rather leave them alone.”
Cyril heaved a profound sigh, and was silent for some seconds,
while Everard kindled a second cigar.
“ You think I have taken a liberty, Harry?” he asked, after a
while. v
“Not in the least. Feeling as you do, you would have been
wrong to be silent. You have but done your duty, old friend.
Cheer up. Oh, do keep a fellow company in a cigar! It is holi:
day-time.”
Cyril’s sensitive face brightened. It was evident that he was
extremely anxious about the eﬁ‘ect his words would have on his
friend’s estimation of him. But he resolutely declined the cigar—
a self-denial which fretted his friend as being quite a new feature in
his character.
“ You are very much changed, Maitland, during the past year,”
he said, locking keenly at him.
“I am indeed,” he replied, with a heavy sigh; and he turned
the subject by pointing out the towers of a gray cathedral in the

distance. “It is always a pleasant friend to meet on one‘s way
home,” he said; and the twojoined in admiring the massive pile,
till their passage through a chalk cutting hid it from their sight for
a time, and then the train slackened, the shouts of porters were
heard, the cathedral appeared once more, and they glided under
the roofs of the smoky station, amid a confused din of bell-ringing,
door-banging, hurrying steps and wheels, and all the turmoil at-
tending a brief pause on a main line.
“ Belminster always had a great fascination for me,” observed
the doctor, looking across the sea of smoke-wreathed roofs to the
vast towers of the cathedral. “ Surely that serenely majestic per-
son in gaiters is the bishop himself. The expression ‘Ohurch dig-
nitary ’ is so ﬁt. Who ever heard of a medical dignitary, or a legal
dignitaryl Good gracious me, Maitland, what an awful thing it
must be to be a bishop’s son! Fancy asking that urbane and digni-
ﬁed cleric to pass the wine? I should faint if called upon to feel a
spiritual lordship’s pulse."
Cyril smiled as the unconscious bishop made a stately and soli~
tary progress past their carriage, recognizing the young clergyman
as he passed.
“ He is very kind and fatherly,” he observed, as the train moved
on. “I wish I were still in his diocese. Yes, I have a great re-
gard for Belminster. I was ordained there.”
“ May you walk in the gaiters of that good old gentleman, Cyril,
some score of years hence, and make the splendid old arches of the
minster ring with your eloquence! I shall settle near you—as
parish doctor, mind—though I invent Heaven knows how many
diseases, as I hope to do, and Europe rings with my discoveries.
No fashionable physician business for me.”
“A bishop,” observed the young priest, thoughtfully, “has an
' immense scope for action.”
“ Here is a man,” said Everard, appealing to the windows and
sides of the carriage, “ who is too honest to say, ‘N 010 episcopari.’
Let us make much of this man! Let us—hem l—marry him to our
sister."
“This day two months,” added Maitland, “the wedding will
take place.”
“By the way, the young minx suggested that I should read
Tennyson’s ‘St. Simeon Stylites ’ at the next Penny Readings. The
suggestion is, I suppose, intended for a profound joke. Rather a

weak poem. Lunacy requires the master-mind of a Shakespeare to
handle it without repulsiveness.”
“I am not sure that it was lunacy,” said Cyril.
“Not lunacy to stand on a pillar for thirty years? My good
fellow, when I consider the doings of the Stylites and the recluses
of the Thebald, I sometimes wonder if there was any sanity in the
world in those days.”
“ There was, at least, method in their madness, Everard. Con-
sider the power their austerities gained them over the minds of ordi-
nary men.” .
“Of course; many an authentic maniac has been honored with
almost divine honors in certain stages of society. The lust of
power is a curious thing. For my part, I would rather be a non-
entity than stand on a pillar to gain inﬂuence.”
“But consider what they wanted inﬂuence for.
to God."
“ So they persuaded themselves, no doubt. Of all things I loathe
asceticism. Not so much for the spiritual ambition and pride that
attend it, as because it is in reality only the other side of proﬁigacy,
or, in other words, an ascetic is a rake turned monk.”
“ Can a rake do better than turn monk? ”
“In my judgment, he can. He can repent, turn away from his
wickedness, and lead a rational human life.”
“Nay. He has made himself unworthy of those common human
enjoyments in which innocent men may indulge. Nothing but a
life of penance can atone—” 1
“Nothing can atone,” interrupted Everard. “I am a Protest-
ant, Cyril—a rabid Protestant, as you observed the other day.
None of your popish penances for me. What‘s the matter? ”
“Nothing,” replied Oyril, whose features quivered with pain, as
he pressed his hand to his side. “At least, only a ‘stitch’ I am

stern avenger."
The spasm again ﬁitted across Cyril’s face, unnoticed by his
friend, for Cyril turned to the window as he pressed his side. Be-
neath his clothes he wore a little golden cross studded with tiny
spikes, which, on pressure, pierced the ﬂesh.
“The exception rather proves the rule,” he said, smiling, as he
turned his face again toward his friend. “The ascetics have in all
ages of the world been the salt of the earth. A mere protest
against sensuality is something. And people need the discipline of
pain.”
“If I were to invent a purgatory, Cyril, it would be one of hap,~
piness. Joy is the true educator and reﬁner, not pain. Nothing
exists, or can exist, without joy, which is both the originator and
sustainer of life in the organic world, and therefore, by analogy, in
the spiritual. You and I are here to-day as the result of long ages
of physical and moral well-being enjoyed through an inﬁnite chain
of ancestors. Without continued physical, mental, and moral en-
joyment throughout our own individual lives, you and I would ~
never have attained to our present physical, mental, and moral
stature—such as it is. Good Heavens, Cyril! think of the stunted,
stiﬂed natures we have been seeing daily in those dens of East-End
vice and misery, and contrast them with the men who were one
companions at Cambridge! ”
“I grant a certain necessary basis of physical well-being," re—
joined Cyril, wearily; “but I trust the day will dawn when you
too will rejoice in the discipline of sorrow. It may even now be
knocking at your doors; for you are too happy, Harry, for a sinful
man—"
“I am most perfectly happy, and trust to remain so, my grue-
some prophet,” said Everard, with a cheery laugh. “ I have youth,
health, a clear conscience, a profession I love, and good prospects in
it, and—and—” Here a curious smile, and something distantly
resembling a blush, irradiated the doctor’s face. “In short, I should
be an ungrateful miscreant if I were not perfectly happy. Though,
to be sure,” he added, “ I am not going to be married to one of the
dearest girls on earth this day two months. Why, what is this?
Oldport already, as I am a living man i ” He was on his feet in a
moment, eagerly scanning the faces on the platform, while Cyril

collected the various impedimenta. “She is not there,” he mut-
tered, in a tone of disappointment, as he appropriated his own share
of the plunder.
“ Oh no l " returned Cyril, in a composed manner; “ she had no
intention of coming. Lilian would pome alone; the phaeton only
holds three, and Marion, of course, would not drive in alone.”
Everard smiled at the different signiﬁcance of the word “ she ”
in his own and his friend‘s vocabulary; to the latter it meant Ma-
rion; to himself, Lilian.
“Perhaps she is here, after all,” he continued, “ waiting outside
with the pony.”
“ Go and see," said Cyril; “time and patience, meanwhile, may
result in the production of a porter, which event I will abide.”
Everard eagerly strode along the little platform, thronged with
laborers, and market-women bearing baskets of the singularly
aggressive nature affected by market-women—baskets constructed
apparently for the express purpose of damaging passengers’ ribs,
and ﬁnding out their tenderest spots. He threaded his way eagerly
through these perils, occasionally removing a stolid and motionless
human obstacle by the simple process of placing his hands on its
shoulders and wheeling it aside, till he issued on the top of the hill
outside the station. The river ﬂowed peacefully by its wharves at
the foot of the hill; the little town rose on its banks, and clustered
lovingly round the base of the tall white tower, whose weatliercock
burned golden in the clear wintry sky; and the gray downs laid
their arms protectingly round this their child.
But Everard did not look at this scene; be scanned only the
lines of ﬂys and omnibuses, each manned by a gesticulating whip-
waving driver, in search of the well-known pony from Malbonrne, '
with the face he loved behind it. But there was no pony and no
Lilian, and he returned disconsolate to Cyril, who, in the mean time,
had succeeded in gaining the attention of one of the two distracted
porters.
“Perhaps,” observed Cyril, tranquil] y, “ I forgot to write. Who
knows? Well, we must have a ﬂy.”
“By the sword of my grandfather,” cried Everard, “I will not
go in one of those confounded ﬁys. Let us walk. The weather is
made for it. A country walk will drive ascetic megrims out of your
brain.”
“And the portznanﬁeausf ”

“Left till called for. We can carry our own bags. Now, look
here,” he added, as Cyril demurred, “I am not going to mortify my
ﬂesh by riding in a cushioned ﬂy behind two horses, with my lug-
gage carried for me. I shall walk across country, bag on shoulder;
and if that is too comfortable for your reverence, you can get some
dried peas at the ﬁrst grocer’s we come to."
Cyril laughed and consented. Everard gave the man silver to
buy peas to put in his boots, to his great mystiﬁcation, and the two
young men set off down the hill, deafened by the importunities of
ﬂymen, and crossed the bridge over the dark, sluggish river, and
admired the artistic pyramids of casks on the brewers’ wharves,
and rejoiced at hearing the familiar Hampshire drawl in the streets;
for it was market-day, and many a rustic lounged, stolid, with open
month, before the gay shop-windows decked for Christmas.
Presently a more musical sound made their ears tingle with
pleasant home thoughts—the sweet, melodious confusion of wagon-
bells, clashing rhythmically along the street, and they soon recog-
nized Long’s ﬁne team of horses, each proudly shaking the music
from his crest, and responding to the guttural commands of Will-
iam Grove, who strode along with an expressionless face and a sprig
of mistletoe in his cap, cracking his whip, and accompanied by his
satellite Jem, who bore holly in his hat. A faint gleam, distantly
resembling a smile, spread over William‘s face at the greeting of the
two young men, and he even went so far as to issue the strange
monosyllable which brought his team to a standstill at their request,
while the more youthful and impassioned J em expanded into a dis-
tinct grin, and replied that his health was “middling.”
“ Well, and how are all the Malbourne folk? and are any of our
people in Oldport to-day, Grove? ”
“I ain’t zeed none as I knows on,” he replied, after a profound
consideration.
“Any of the Malbourne folk ‘ gone up the steps ’ today i ”
asked Everard, looking in the direction of the town hall, which was
closed, with its clock glittering in the sunshine.
“Ah! ’tain’t often we goos up steps,” returned William, who
knew well that the steps referred to were those conducting the
malefactor before the magistrates at the town hall, and which were
numerous and unpleasant to climb with a burdened conscience.
“ We never knows, though,” he added, in an unusual burst of mor-
alizing, “ who med be the next.”

“I hope it won‘t be you, William,” returned Everard; “if it is,
it won’t be for robbing those ﬁne horses of their corn. Why, they
look as ﬁt as ﬁlberts,” he added, patting the leader.
“ It wun‘t be you neither, doctor,” growled William, affection-
ately; “for all they zes as how you done for Jem Martin, a-cutting
of him open and a-zewing of him up so many times, and pretty nigh
pisened Mam Lee.”
“ Do they say that? ” laughed Everard. “ And this is fame, as
Mr. Crummles observed, Cyril. Well, look here, William! you take
these bags of ours, if you think the wagon can stand it, and fetch
our p.0rtmanteaus from the station. Jem can run up the hill. for
them.”
“ Our luggage, William,” explained Cyril, “if it won’t put you
out of your way. We are going home on foot, and didn’t know'
how on earth to get our things out till we met you.”
After deep cogitation, and some assistance from the quicker in-
telligence of Jem, the nature of the service he was required to
render at last dawned upon William Grave‘s intellect, which was
apparently situated at a long distance from the material world, and
he consented with grutf heartiness, and, waking all the ﬁve little
peals of music with one motion of his whip, started off in the
direction of the station.
“A happy New Year to you! ” the two friends cried together
at parting.
“And beware of going up the steps,” added Everard. “Upon
my word, Cyril, I should like to explore the recesses of that fel-
low’s moral consciousness. He is apparently up to the level of the
most advanced thinkers of the day. He evidently looks upon
crime as a misfortune dependent upon quite intrinsic circum-
stances.”
“They all do,” returned Cyril. “It is the part of Christianity
to convince the world of sin.”
“Who shall say how far a man’s will consents to his acts?”
added Everard, musingly. “I hope some day to be able to give
myself to the study of mental disease, and more accurately trace
the connection between that and crime.”
“Let us forget both this one day," said Cyril, whose spirits had
undergone a wonderful change in the last half-hour, and were now
gay even to boyishness. "
Everard fell readily into his humor, and, chatting and laughing,

the friends soon passed the streets of the little town and its minia-
ture suburbs, and gained the pretty village of Chalkburne, "the
Norman tower of which showed in the sunlight fresh and unworn
by its eight centuries of storm, and greeted the travelers with the
music of its chiming hour as they walked through the linden-
girdled churchyard, rejoicing in their youth and the live wintry,
air.
Cyril had the gift of conversation, which Everard somewhat '
lacked, and the talk was, brilliant and sparkled with his ready wit
and quick repartee, in which the doctor was continually worsted,
greatly to his own good-humored content. His love for Cyril and
his admiration for his gifts were boundless. The two friends had
passed all their school-time together, Everard riding daily to Mal-
bourne to study with Cyril’s tutor, Mr. Maitland’s curate; and in
those young days the hero-worship began, the elder boy, whose
mental powers were slower if more solid, admiring, protecting, and
helping the bright-eyed, clever child who shared his studies and so
often distanced him. They met again at Cambridge, where the
senior was only one year ahead of his two-years junior. and there
Everard found fresh cause to admire his brilliant and successful
friend, who gathered friends and admirers innumerable about him,
and won laurels, both literary and social.
And new family ties promised to unite them more closely, and
Everard .was glad—far more glad than Maitland, whose affection
for his friend, though warm, had not the slightest element of hero—
worship, but was, on the contrary, ﬂavored with a good spice of
condescension. With all his imagination and quick sympathy,
Cyril did not see that Henry possessed those solid and patient
mental gifts which readily master the facts of physical science, and,
above all, had the peculiar faculty which may be called scientiﬁc
imagination—that he was, in short, one of those chosen few who
make new epochs in the history of scientiﬁc research. Cyril looked
upon his enthusiasm for his profession as praiseworthy, but inex-
plicable. It seemed to him that Henry crawled upon the earth,
while he soared in the vast heaven’s blue. Such was the bond
which united the two hard-working young men who walked along
the chalky road that bracing afternoon at the end of December, to
pass a week‘s well-earned holiday under the friendly roof of Mal-
bourne Rectory.

CHAPTER V.
THE afternoon sun was shining peacefully upon the thatched
roofs of Melbourne, on the dark gray spire of its tree-girdled
church, and on the southwest front of Melbourne Rectory. At one
of the sun-lighted windows sat Lilian Maitland, busily writing, her
face directed to the prospect without, which she occasionally
looked upon in her thoughtful pauses. I
The lawn sloped quickly from the windows to a road which was
. concealed by trees, and beyond which rose the park-like grounds
of Northover House in such a manner as to appear but a continua-
tion of the Rectory grounds. Somewhere down in the hollow by
the road there danced and murmured the bright little stream which
gave its name to Melbourne, and which Lilian knew was sparkling
gayly now in the sunshine, as it washed the drooping hart’s-tongue
waving from its mossy bank. Beyond the cluster of village roots
on the right spread a range of ﬂat, windy ﬁelds to the unseen sea.
Behind the Rectory, and on the left of Lilian’s window, rose the
bleak chalk downs, strong barriers against the wild salt winds
which swept over those regions summer and winter from the
sea.
Mark Antony, the cat, sat demurely on the table by the blotting-
book, thoughtfully scanning the sunny landscape, and pretending not
to see the pert little robin on the lawn, while he occasionally ap-
pealed to Lilian’s sympathies by rubbing his velvet head against her
cheek, or giving her a dainty little bite, which he had copied from
his human friends, under the impression that it was a kiss. In a
low chair, between the table and the ﬁre, sat a very pretty, slender
girl, toying with a piece of fancy work, but really intent upon
trying to win a glance or responsive purr from Mark Antony, who
regarded all her eﬂ‘orts with haughty indifference, and continued to
evolve his philosophy of the visible universe unmoved.
“He is so tantalizing! ” she cried, throwing away her work
with a pretty pettish gesture. “ If he would only once show some
deference to me, I should not care. Puss, puss, I say! Come to
me at once, sir i ”
“ He thoroughly understands the secret of his own supremacy,
Marion,” replied Lilian, coming to the end of her writing, and softly
stroking the animal’s snow-white breast. “He knows as well as

you do that you would think nothing of his caresses if he lavished
them nnasked.” '
“Selﬁsh, hateful animal 1 ”
“He is not selﬁsh,” replied Lilian; “he is a profound student
of human nature. He has discovered that the deepest joy a. human
being can taste is to love disinterestedly. He therefore offers man-
kind this enjoyment by permitting them to adore him at a distance.
Dogs afford a far lower enjoyment—that of being loved.”
“Dogs are right,” said Marion, her brown eyes softening in a
wistful gaze; “the happiest thing is to be loved. I should dieif
people didn’t love me. I almost hated Cyril when I thought, in
that dreadful time last spring, that he didn’t care for me.”
“ It is delicious to be loved,” rejoined Lilian, “ but to love is
best. How happy Henry is in his affection for you! You are the
dearest thing in the world to him, and yet I think you care little
comparatively for him; you even prefer your brother Leslie, who
is always too busy with sport and gayeties to write to you.”
“ Well, it is dilferent," replied Marion. “ Henry is so full of
learning that he seems older than Leslie, who is the darling of his
regiment and so full of life. And then, Henry is not engaged. I
am sure he has never cared for any girl, and will die an old bache-
lor. Of course, he cares much more for me than I care for him.
And he is so devoted to Cyril.”
“ I think," said Lilian, pressing her check against her pet's glossy
fur, “ that neither of you know the real worth of Henry.”
“ Oh, he is the best old fellow in the world, but not clever and
handsome like Cyril, and without the dash of Leslie. By the way,
I suppose those bad boys will be here to-night.”
“ No doubt they will turn up some time, unless something serious
detains them, in which case they will telegraph. Oyll has promised
to preach to~morrow. Are you quite sure, Marion, that he did not
mention his train? He always likes me to meet him at Oldport.”
“He said he would write later to name the train. I suppose he
forgot."
“ He does forget now, Marion, as he never used to. He is kill-
ing himself in that dreadful parish. Oh, I shall be so thankful when
you are married! There will be a perfect holiday to begin with,
and then you will keep him within reasonable bounds.”
Marion laughed. “He will have to take care of me as well as
the parish,” she said. “ But what is this? ”

“ This” proved to be merely Eliza, the parlor-maid, who entered
with her usual unmoved countenance.
“It is only Stevens, Miss Lilian,” she said. “And could you
please step down to the forge at once 2 ”
“ The forge! ” exclaimed Marion, with wide eyes of astonish-
ment. \
9‘ What is the matter there, Eliza? " asked Lilian, tranquilly.
“ Only Hotspur, Mr. Ingram’s horse, miss. They‘ve been trying
this hour to get him shod. Straun says he wouldn’t touch him for
a hundred pounds.”
“ But what has the parish clerk to do with shoeing horses?” ex-
claimed the bewildered Marion.
“ Or the pal-son‘s daughter?” added Lilian, laughing. “Why,
nothing is done in the village without Stevens, Marion. He and
Grandfer together are the oracles of Melbourne. N 0, you shall not
come with me; you would be frightened to death. Go and see if
mother wants anything. She will be waking now.”
_ “ Oh, I say, Lilian! ” cried a little voice, as Lennie burst in, rosy
and excited, “ do come along. Such larks! Hotspur has kicked a
cart to atoms, and now he is letting ﬂy in all directions, and is kill-
ing Judkins, and there‘s Stevens stamping at the back door, and the
whole village with its hair on end.”
“Hyperbole is Lennie’s favorite ﬁgure," commented Lilian, go~
ing out into the hall and taking her hat and jacket. “Run on, Len-
nie, and say I am just coming. Matter? Oh, my dearest Marion,
nothing! Only that Ingram Swaynestone spoils his horses' tem-
pers, and then is surprised that his servants can’t manage them."
In another minute Lilian had passed with quick, light step and
erect carriage down the drive, and along the village high-road, bor-
dered with its little gardens, in which one or two belated autumn
ﬂowers still made a brave show against the wintry rigor. She
went quickly, but without hurry, and found time on the way to
give some directions about the church to the clerk, a lean, rugged
ﬁgure, stooping slightly beneath the fardel of some ﬁfty winters,
and crowned with a shock of grizzled red hair, who walked and
talked excitedly at her side.
Soon she saw the forge, from the black heart of which streamed
a ruddy glow, looking lurid in contrast with the sunshine, and
round which was grouped a dense little crowd of women and chil-
dren, with a few men. Straun, the smith, a burly, grimy, bare;

armed ﬁgure in a leathern apron, stood in an attitude of deﬁant
despair, one strong hand grasping his great hammer, which he had
ﬂung on the anvil, and calling silently on Heaven to witness that
he was ready to shoe Christian horses, however rampant, but not
demons, hippogriﬂ’s, or any such uncanny monsters. Near him,
looking rather pale, but resolute, as became one superior to the
weaker emotions, an old, bent, withered man, with shrewd gray
eyes and pureed-up mouth, stood leaning forward on a stout oaken
stick, and shook his head as one who despaired of ﬁnding virtue in
these degenerate days in either man or beast.
, “ And I zays, as l zed afore,” he repeated, emphasizing his words
with the stick, which be dug into the ground with all the force of
his two withered hands, “ zend for Miss Lilian—zend for she I ”
“Lard love ’ee, Granfer,” observed a stout fellow in a smock-
frock, who stood inside the forge in attendance on a couple of mass-
ive, glossy-coated cart-horses, who were 002in munching some hay
dropped before them, and contemplating the proceedings lazily with
their great soft winking eyes, “ where’s the use of a gal? ” a propo-
sition received by Granfer and the assembled village with silent
scorn.
The center of the excited little crowd, which occasionally burst
asunder and ﬂew outward with a wild mingling of women’s and
children’s shrieks—for the men skurried off with a silent celerity
that was all the more eﬁ'ectualﬂwas a beautiful chestnut horse, not
standing, according to the comfortable and decent wont of horses,
on four ﬁrmly-planted feet, but outraging people’s belief in the sta-
bility of natural laws by rearing himself wildly and insecurely on
his two hind legs, and dangling from his mouth in mid-air a miser-
able white-faced biped in sleeved waistcoat and gaiters, whose cap
had fallen OE and whose damp hair streamed as wildly as Hotspur‘s
own frenetic mane and quivering tail. Tired of this folly, with his
ears laid back, his nostrils wide and red, and his eyes showing noth-
ing but the whites, Hotspur would suddenly drop his victim to his
native earth, and, plunging forward on his other end, as if intent on
turning a somerset, would throw his hind hoofs up toward the
sky in a manner most alarming to those who enjoyed a near view
of the proceedings; and then, wearying of this, he would dance
round on all four legs at once in a manner utterly bewildering to
contemplate.
“ Why, Hotspur,” cried Lilian, in her clear, mellow voice, as she
ins-sn- $5»

stepped quickly through the crowd just as Hotspur dropped the
unfortunate groom to the ground, and prepared to turn himself the
other way up, “ what is this, old fellow? ” and she caught the rein
from the groom’s hand, pushing the latter gently away, and laid her
slender, strong white hand ﬁrmly upon the quivering neck of the
maddened, plunging horse. “ Fie, Hotspur, ﬁe! ”
No one had observed Lilian’s approach, and when she appeared
as if dropped from the skies in the groom’s place, a sudden quiet
pervaded every human face and limb, the crowd fell back, and all
looked on, save the skeptic with the cart-horses, with an air of tran-
quil expectancy; while Lilian, without a trace of anxiety or agita-
tion, talked in caressing, reproving tones to the ill-conducted steed,
whose limbs had quivered into some approach to quiet at the ﬁrst
touch of the slender, spirit-like hand on his neck.
But even Lilian’s magic touch could not expel the demon of
passion at once from the maddened creature. He still reared and
plunged and danced, in a manner that led the spectators to give him
plenty of room for his evolutions; but he became gradually quieter,
until he stood as Providence intended horses should stand, on all
four feet at once, and only betrayed the internal workings of his
outraged feelings by the quivering of his limbs and body, the work-
ings of his ears and eyes, and the redness of his wide nostrils, while
Lilian’s musical voice never ceased its low monologue of soothing
and reproach, and her hand never left stroking and patting his
shining neck and shoulders. At Hotspur’s ﬁrst backward rear,
indeed, her hand left him perforce, and she only avoided being
hoisted in mid-air like the luckless groom by giving him a long rein,
and stepping quickly back out of the way of his formidable fore—
feet.
This was an ugly moment, and a woman in the crowd uttered
an exclamation of dismay, and turned pale at the sight of the girl
beneath the rearing horse, though no one else betrayed the least
emotion, not even the skeptic in the smock-frock, whose mouth was
too widely opened in astonishment to leave room for his features to
express any other feeling; but Hotspur, ﬁnding that Lilian did not
balk him of his dance on his hind legs, soon desisted from that
uncomfortable performance, and yielded, as his betters frequently
did, gradually to the soothing charm of her voice and touch, until
he became, ﬁguratively speaking, clothed and in his right mind.
She found fault with Hotspur’s bit, and pointed out the undue

tightness of his girths to J udkins, whose cheeks had now resumed
their native ruddy hue; and when these defects were remedied, she
led the horse a little way along the road and back again, and fed
him with sugar and other dainties, till Hotspnr’s heart waxed so
glad within him that he consented to stand like a lamb, while
Straun, not without some misgiving in his bluﬁ face, and nmut-
tered reference to his wife and seven children, ﬁtted his new shoes
on to his restive feet with what speed and dexterity he could
muster.
“And I zed,” observed Granfer, again striking his oaken staff
emphatically on the ground, and looking round on the assembled
village as if for applause, “zed I, ‘Zend for Miss Lilian—zend for
she ‘I "
The crowd, in the mean time, had been augmented by the ar-
rival of two other spectators, who were unobserved in the absorb-
ing interest evoked by Hotspur and his conqueror. One was a tall,
ﬁnely built man, somewhat past middle life, on a good, well-bred
bay horse, which he rode and handled with perfect horsemanship.
He stopped, in the ﬁrst instance, to avoid riding over the village
population; and in the second, to witness the curious little‘drama
enacted in the wintry sunshine. He was soon joined by a gray-
haired clergyman, of venerable aspect and reﬁned features, who
I looked on with quiet interest.
“Upon my word, Maitland,” said the equestrian, addressing the
latter, “this is a new revelation of your daughter’s powers. I was
already aware that she soothed the troubles and quieted the con-
sciences of the whole village, but I did not know that she under-
took the blacksmith’s labors as well."
“My daughter,” replied Mr. Maitland, tranquilly, “has received
a very singular gift from the Almighty. She can subdue any ani-
mal, tame or wild, by some mysterious virtue of touch, voice, or
glance—perhaps of all three. N ot a very lofty gift, perhaps, Sir
Lionel, but one which is often very useful in a homely way.”
“But surely, Maitland, you can not approve of Lilian’s rendering
such dangerous services as these. Are you not afraid for her? ”
“No; I have every conﬁdence in her powers. And I do not
like to make her nervous by suggesting danger. Perhaps one secret
of her inﬂuence is her absolute fearlessness. Watch the expression
of her eye. No; I like my child to render whatever service she is
capable of to her fellow-creatures. Parents often err, I think, by

interfering unnecessarily with their children’s actions. Well, Lilian,
and what was the matter?" he asked, as the crowd, perceiving
them, fell back respectfully, with courtesies and cap~touchings. J ud~
kins, receiving his four-footed charge from Lilian’s hand, prepared
to mount and ride away, not without warning from Lilian, and
strict injunctions to eschew whipping and other irritations, and to
quiet IIotspur’s nerves by a good canter on the turf.
“ Only a horse with a spoilt temper, father,” she replied. “How
do you do, Sir Lionel? Tell Mr. Swaynestone that I mean to scold
him roundly about Hotspur. He is far too hot himself to be able
to indulge in chestnut horses. And, indeed, I am not sure that he
ought to have any horse at all."
“ All this,” said Sir Lionel, who had dismounted and taken off
his hat with graceful, old-fashioned courtesy, “I will faithfully do,
though surely one word from yourself would have more eifect than
volumes I could say. Do your spells work only on the lower crea-
ticn, Lilian?”
“ I suppose so," returned Lilian, turning homeward in the
reddening sunbeams, accompanied by the two gentlemen and the
horse, which latter she patted to his great satisfaction. “ My spells
consist chieﬂy of sympathy and affection, and these are perfect with
innocent animals and children, but only partial with sinful men.”
“ Ben Lee will never forgive you for inducing me to drive with-
out bcaring-reins,” said Sir Lionel. “I wish you could have seen
Y the sight, Maitland. Lee ignominiously dethroned, your daughter
and myself on the box, Lilian handling the ribbons, and driving me
up and down before the house without bearing-reins. Lee never
drives out now without preparing for his last moment, poor fellow.
I hope you will not help poachers, Lilian. I hear you can surround
yourself with ﬁfty pheasants at any moment in our woods.”
“If I were to hurt anything, I think my power would be gone;
and even if I did not love a thing I should have no power, for I have
no inﬂuence on reptiles.”
“ And does Cyril, who is so like you, share your power? ”
“As a child he did,” interposed Mr. Maitland. “ You remember
the bull that killed Lee’s father, Sir Lionel? Imagine my feelings
on seeing the twins, then about six years old, stroking him, and
trying to reach by jumping up to his terriﬁc horns! Still, Cyril has
an unusual inﬂuence over animals, though it becomes fainter. He
has more power With human beings than his sister.”

“Yet Lilian stopped that fellow who was beating his wife to
death.” ,
“ And the whole village looking on and not lifting a ﬁnger-
the cowards! ” Lilian ﬂashed out. “He fell down in sheer fright
when I rushed at him. Come in, Sir Lionel, and have some tea,”
she added, as they reached the gates.
But Sir Lionel refused the tea, having still some distance to ride
before dark.
“I am in Lady Swaynestone’s service to-night,” he said, “and
she bid me ask you to come and counsel her about some distribution
of coals or what not, when you have a spare moment. I wish you
could also exorcise the demon of extravagance from that boy In-
gram.”
“She nearly scolds the poor fellow to death as it is,” said Mr.
Maitland. “ We are expecting Henry Everard to-night.”
“ So I hear. A promising fellow, Sir Andrew Smithson tells me.
He was both clever and kind in his treatment of Lee’s wife last
spring. As a. lad, I thought him rather dull. However, we all pin
our faith on Dr. Everard now at Swaynestone.”
And bidding them farewell, Sir Lionel sprang like any youth
to his saddle, and rode away at a canter, looking like a very prince
as his tall and gracefully erect ﬁgure disappeared among the trees
in the dusk.
The group at the forge, meantime, rightly judged that so much
heat, toil, and anxiety required the alleviation of moisture, and
Straun, casting his hammer aside, proclaimed his intention of ad-
journing for solace to the Sun, which stood at the corner by the
cross-roads, a few paces further down the road.
“ Come on, Stevens,” he said, “and toss me who’ll treat Gran-
fer."
The guardian of the cart horses thought it a pity not to follow
so good an example; so also did Hale, the wheelwright, who lived
at the opposite corner; and Wax, who chanced to be the school-
master, and Baines, the tailor, whose monotonous indoor occupa-
tion, though varied with pig-jabbing and gardening, required fre-
quent solace of this nature. Hale‘s brother Tom, a soldier resting
from war’s alarms in his native village in a very undress uniform,
consisting of no belt, a tunic unbuttoned all the way down and dis-
playing a large expanse of striped shirt, trousers tucked up round
the ankles, a short pipe, and a muﬁn-cap perilously askew‘, con-

sidered it a breach of manners unbecoming a soldier and a gentle-
man to permit these worthy men to drink without his assistance;
and similar feelings animated his brother Jim, a sailor, bearing the
legend, “H. M. S. Bellerophon,” on his cap. So the brave fellows,
accommodating their pace to that of Granfer, which was more dig-
niﬁed than swift, turned in as one man beneath the low doorway
of the Sun, and grouped themselves about the cozy, sanded bar,
where the ﬁre~light was beginning to look cheerily ruddy in the
fading afternoon.
“And I zaid,” added Granfer, striking the sanded ﬂoor dogmatic-
ally with his stick, “ ‘Zend for Miss Lilian—zend fur she.’ ”
“ Ay, Granfer,” growled the smith, “it’s all very well for Miss
Lilian. She ain’t got a wife and seven children, and her bread to
git.”
“I zes, zes I,” interposed the skeptic in the smock-frock, who
had taken a pull at his tankard, and was removing the foam from
his lips by the simple application of the back of his hand, “ ‘ Where’s
the use of a gal? ’ I’ve a zin it, and I believes it. I shouldn’t a be-
lieved it if I hadn’t a zin it.”
“ You never believes nothink,” observed Jim. “Ah! if you’d
a sin what I’ve a sin aboord the Bellyruﬁ‘iaw” ‘
“Or if he’d a sin they there snake-charmcrs in India, what he
won’t believe in,” added the soldier.
“Ah!” broke in the clerk, “ you put Miss Lilian aboord the
Bellyruﬁan, or take her out to Injy and let her charm snakes, and
I'll war’nt she’ll do it. That ar buoy Dick, whatever she done to
he, nobody knows. A bad ’un he wer, wouldn‘t do nothing he
hadn‘t a mind to. You med bate ’un till you couldn‘t stand. Wax

catch he gwine to school if he’d a mind to miche. I zes to Miss
Lilian, I zes, ‘I’ve a hate that ar buoy black and blue,’ I zes, ‘and
I’ve a kep 'un without vittles this two days, and he wun’t do

stick. ‘I should like to hate you green and yaller, Stevens,’ she
ses. And she’d a done it, she would, green and yallcr—ahl that
she would, mates.” .
“I don’t deny,” said Baines, the tailor, whose profession ren-
dered him morbid, revolutionary, and inclined to distrust the
utility of existing institutions, “ but what Miss Lilianmay have her
uses.”
“ Ah, Baines,” interrupted the soldier, “ you ain’t such a fool as
you looks, after all.”
Before the stupeﬁed Baines, who was accustomed to have his
remarks received with reverence, could reply to this insult, public
feeling was suddenly outraged by the following observation from
the smock-frocked skeptic, the want of wisdom in whom was ac-
counted for by his having only recently come to Malbourne, from a.
village at least ten miles off that center of intelligence.
“But what shall us do when Miss Lilian gets married? ”
“Marriedl ” shouted the clerk. “And who ses she’s a-gwine
to marry? ”
“She med marry; then agen she medn’t,”~ replied this foolish
person, unabashed by the dark glances bent upon him.
“Miss Lilian,” observed Granfer, who had been indulgently
listening while be dispatched his beer, and thus aﬁ'ording weaker
wits the opportunity of exercising themselves during his forbear-
ance, “ain‘t a-gwine to marry nobody”; and, thrusting his staff
forward and resting his two hands upon it, Granfer looked round
the assembly with austere menace in his shrewd gray eyes.
Nobody dared reply to this, and silence prevailed, broken only
by the sound of good liquor disappearing down men’s throats, and
a weak, halfaudible murmur from the smock-frock about girls '
'being girls, whether gentle or simple.
“I zes to my missus, vive year agone last Middlemas, zes I,”
continued Granfer, who chanced to he the grandsire of the in-
dignant clerk, “‘Miss Lilian ain’t one 0’ your marrying zart’”;
and again Granfer looked round the assembly as if challenging
them to deny the undeniable, and was met by an assenting mur-
mur of “ Ah’sl ”
“Miss Lilian,” pursued Granfer, with an air of inspiration, “is
turned vour and twenty. Vour and twenty year old come last
May is they twins. Well I minds the night they was barned. The

all the archards miles round, and there warn’t no vruit that year.
Ah! Varmer Long he’d a lost dree and dirty yowes lambing-time
that year. Well I minds it. I druv pony-chaise into Oldport, and
vetched out t’ doctor. And I zes to my missus, I zes, when I come
home, ‘Master’s got twins!’ Ay, that’s what I zed, znre enough.
And my missus she zes, zes she, ‘Lard love ’ee, Granfer,’ she zes,
‘you don’t zay zo! ’ she zes ”; and again Granfer paused and
looked round to perceive the effect of his eloquence.
“ Ay,” said the landlord, feeling that courtesy now obliged him
to entertain the intellects as well as the bodies of his guests, “twins
is znmmat when it comes to that. Twins is bad enough for poor
volk, but when it comes to ladies and they, Lard ’a massey l ”
“Ah! ” murmured Granfer, shaking his head with profound
wisdom, and at the same time regretfully contemplating the
vacuum in his beer-pot, “them twins done for Mrs. Maitland.
She ain’t ben the zame ’ooman zince, never zimmed to perk up
agen arter that. Vine children they was, too, as ever you’d wish
to zoo, and brought up on Varmer Long‘s Alderney cow, kep’
special vor ’nm, as I used to vetch the milk marnin’ and evenin’.
I did, zure enough.”
Here Tom, the soldier, who, in virtue of his red coat, was bound
to be susceptible to feminine charms, opined that Miss Lilian was
still “a smartish-looking gal ”; and Jim, the sailor, added that he
didn’t see why she shouldn‘t pick up some smart lad yet, for his
heart was warm, and he could not bear to consign an unoffending
girl to the chills of single blessedness. There was Lieutenant
Everard of the Bellerophon, a frequent visitor at the Rectory, for
example—as smart an ofﬁcer as Jim had ever seen, he added.
“ Ah, goo on wi’ yel ” cried Granfer, greatly refreshed by the
polite replenishment of his pot at Tom’s expense. “Miss Lilian’s as
pretty a maid as Tom’ll zee in a day's march. But she wun’t marry
nobody. Vur why? zes I. Cause she wun’t ha’e the common zart,
and the upper crust they wun‘t ha’e she."
“ W’atever’s come over J udkins now ’f " asked Hale, the wheel-
wright. musingly. “ He’d had a drop too much ’s afternoon, and
he was a latherin’ into Hotspur like mad coming down shoot.* He
hadn’t ought to treat a boss like that.”
* A short steep hill on the highway. ’

“Aman med well drink,” said the tailor, “afore trusting his-
self to a animal like that there. Steady as Charlie J udkins was,
poor chap! What these ’ere rich men get to answer for! ”
“ I never zeen a ‘oss rampageouser,” replied the smith; “ but I
never zeen a ’oss Miss Lilian couldn’t quiet, or a ass either."
“ Your missus ’ull be sending for her one day, then," said Jim;
and the whole assembly broke into a loud guﬁ'aw, after which Gran-
fer very impressively related the history of the hunted fox, which
appeared one day with his paws on the window-sill of Lilian's sit-
ting-room, followed by the pack in full cry, and the whole ﬁeld at
no great distance. He told how Lilian quickly opened the window,
Reynard leaped in, and she as quickly shut it; and how the hunts-
man, on ﬁnding the hounds at check round the Rectory window,
looked in, and was greatly shocked to see poor Reynard’s pointed
nose and glittering eyes peering out- from among the skirts of a
‘ young lady sitting quietly at work, and tranquilly surveying the
baﬂled hounds buying outside.
Lilian refused to deliver up her fugitive, holding parley with the
master of the hounds through the closed and latched window, until
the latter had withdrawn his pack; and it was not until the prem-
ises had been cleared a good half-hour of every vestige of hound,
horse, and man, that she unbolted door or window, and suffered
her weary, panting prisoner to depart, which he did with evident
regret and thankfulness for hospitality—a hospitality poorly re-
quited by him, since he managed to snatch a chick from the poul-
try-yard in effecting his escape.
But no one seemed to think there was anything unusual in Lili-
an’s power over living creatures; it was simply what one expected
of Miss Lilian, just as one expected church bells to ring and cocks
to crow. Nor had any one thanked her for assisting so effectively
at the shoeing of Hotspur.
Then followed a long history of animals healed by Lilian, and
in particular of a dog of Ingram Swaynestone’s, which the latter
was going to shoot, when she begged its life, and nursed it into
health. Also of the racers Ingram had at a. trainer’s, and the money
he lost by them; of the oaks and beeches at Swaynestone, which
had to expiate these losses: and of the young fellow’s probable de-
scent to beggar-y through the paths of pleasure.
“ He’s a vine young veller,” observed Granfer, at the close of
his second pot; “a wild ’un zurely. His rather was a wild ’un,

too; ’tis the blood and the high veeding. So was his grandfather.
I minds things as Sir Lionel did would make ’ee all stare. Men is
just the same as osses—veed ‘em up, and they vlings. The well-
bred ’uns is vive times skittisher than t’others. Wuld Sir Lionel,
he was the wildest of all—druv his stage into Oldport vour-in-hand,
he did, and killed dree or vour volks in the streets. Ah! times isn‘t
what they was,” sighed Granfer, regretfully draining his pot.
By this time it was dark night. The Sun windows threw a
warm glow over the road; the stars sparkled keenly above the
thatched roof of the little hostel; and the smell of wood-smoke
mingled with the appetizing odor of fried pork, red herrings, and
onion soup, rising all over the village, warned the topers that the ,
hour of supper was approaching, and they would have dispersed,
however unwillingly, but for the chimes of wagon-bells along the
road, which beguiled them into waiting while William Grove depos-
ited his parcels at the Sun, took the one glass oﬂered by the host,
and recounted the news from Oldport.
CHAPTER VI.
ON looking back in after life to that brisk winter’s walk, both
Everard and Maitland held it as one of their sunniest memories.
Every step seemed to put a fresh luster in Cyril’s eyes, and add to
the wine-like sparkle of his conversation. In proportion as his spir-
its fell at one time, they rose at another by virtue of his sensitive,
emotional temperament; while Henry’s steady, sunny cheerfulness
went on deepening more slowly, but perhaps more surely, and at
last bubbled over. Presently they passed a woman toiling up a hill
with a baby and a basket, of both which burdens Everard relieved
her, to her unbounded surprise, coolly handing the basket to Cyril,
and himself bearing the baby, which be tossed till it crowed with
ecstasy. Having left these triﬂes at (a roadside cottage, with a shil-
ling to requite the woman for the loan of her infant, they reached
Swaynestone Park, and met Ben Lee, who was crossing the road on
his way from his cottage to the stables.
Everard greeted him with a cordiality to which Lee replied
gruiiiy, and with an evident intention of hurrying on.


## p. 57 (#63) ##############################################

‘THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 57
“ Oh, come, Lee," said Everard, “ you are not so busy as all that!
How are they all up at the Temple? Alma’s roses in full bloom, I
hope? And my patient, Mrs. Lee, has she quite got over the acci-
dent? I shall be looking in very soon.”
“You may save yourself the trouble, Dr. Everard,” returned
Lee, in la surly manner; “thank ’ee kindly all the same. But I
want no more gentlefolk up at my house. I’ve had enough of they.
Good afternoon, Mr. Cyril; glad to see you home, sir ”; and, touch—
ing his hat, he passed quickly on, leaving Everard in a state of
stupefaction in the middle of the road.
“ What the deuce is the matter with Lee? " he exclaimed.
“ Surely he can’t be drunk, Cyril! ”
All the light had faded from Cyril‘s radiant face. The moment
he caught sight of the coachman, he made the old movement of
pressing his hand to his side in a spasm of pain, and he seemed al-
most as impatient of delay as Lee himself.
“I never heard of his drinking,” he replied, evasively. “Per-
haps things have gone wrong with him. Look here, Henry! let us
out the high-road. and get home across country ; we shall save half
a mile, and ﬁnd the ladies at tea.”
“What sense can you get out of a fellow in love?" returned
Everard, leading the way over the stile. “ For him mankind dwin-
dles down to a slim puss of a girl, with dimples and a pair of brown
eyes. Go on, man! ‘Gather ye rosebuds while ye may’; ” and,
lilting out the gay old ballad with all the strength of his honest
lungs, Everard resumed his light-hearted manner, and did not ob-
serve that Cyril’s gayety had become forced and spasmodic.
A ruddy glow above the wooded crests of Northover was all
that remained of day when they entered the Rectory grounds by
the churchyard path, and found Lilian, with the cat gravely coiled
at her feet at the hall door, darkly outlined against the faint, crim-
son light of the hall stove.
“ Your instinct is infallible, Lilian,” said Cyril, embracing her;
“for you were not even sure that I was coming to-night. Dear
Lilian, it is nice to see you again! ”
“ I am‘ glad not to be wholly eclipsed by the new star,” she re-
plied, laughing, yet soanning his face with some anxiety, while she
continued to hold his hand. Then she turned to Henry, over whose
spirits an unaccountable damp had descended, and oﬂ'ered him her
hand; while Cyril stooped to stroke Mark Antony, who was tri-

umphantly rubbing himself round and round his legs with loud
purrs and exultant tail. “I am so glad you have brought him,
Henry,” she said; adding, in a lower voice, “ He is looking horribly
ill.”
By this time Mr. Maitland, the children, the dogs, and all the
servants were in the hall, greeting Cyril with such enthusiasm that
Henry remained for some moments unnoticed by Lilian’s side.
“ You all seem extremely glad to see Cyril,” he observed to her,
with rueful emphasis.
“Dear Henry, I know we are horribly rude to our guests when
we have Cyril to spoil,” she replied, laying her hand gently on his
arm.
He took the hand in his and pressed it warmly to his side, and
felt that the rainbow radiance had suddenly returned to his universe.
But the bright moment was very brief, for it was now his turn to
be welcomed, and by the time he was free to go into the drawing-
room, Lilian was not to be seen.
“ But where is Marion?” asked Cyril, looking round the draw~
ing-room, after he had duly saluted his mother, who was, as usual,
on her couch.
“I think you will ﬁnd her in my room,” replied Lilian, as in-
differently as if she had not specially arranged for the lovers to meet
there. “ We dine punctually at half-past seven. No, Henry, you
foolish fellow, you are to stay here,” she added, as Cyril left the
room, and Henry attempted to follow him.
“ A brother, I suppose, is of no account in these days,” grumbled
Everard, seating himself by Mrs. Maitland‘s couch with a contented
air, nevertheless. “ All this courtship is sickening to me. Mrs.
Maitland. As for that hopeful son of yours, not one word of sense
have I got out of him this day, or do I expect to get for the next
two months. Thank goodness, it must come to an end then, and
they will settle down to a life‘s squabbling like sane people.”
“Ah, young people! young people! ” said Mr. Maitland, looking
very happy about it. “ We must not be hard upon them, Henry.
We all go mad once—Lennie will turn that back into Latin for you,
eh l—But we consider Cyril and Marion a very sensible young
couple, don’t we, Nellie?”
“I think,” replied Mrs. Maitland, laughing, “that we consider
everything that Cyril does sensible. When his biography is written,
it will be said that his family did, to a certain extent, appreciate him.”


## p. 59 (#65) ##############################################

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 59
Whereupon the conversation turned upon Cyril and his doings
and his prospects, and their anxiety about him, and suddenly the
thought struck chill to Everard‘s marrow: What would happen,
in case of Cyril’s failure, death, or other misadventure, to the inno-
cent family circle of which he was the central hope?
The curtains were drawn snugly against the frosty cold without.
Eliza, all smiles and fresh cap-ribbons, brought a lamp and tea;
and Everard wondered if Heaven could possibly be an improvement
on the present. N 0 one ever made or poured out tea like Lilian, he
thought; no tea ever had so divine an effect on the nervous system
as hers. For weeks he had dreamed of sitting thus by the drawing-
room ﬁre, his whole being pervaded by the delicious fact of her
presence, and now he found the reality sweeter than the dream.
Not for weeks only, but for years afterward, did the memory of
that ﬁreside scene shine warmly on the darkness of his life. The
lamplight was so soft that the ﬁre, on which Lennie had thrown
some ﬁr-cones, disputed for mastery with it, and added to the cheery
radiance of the pretty drawing-room. On one side of the ﬁre Mrs.
Maitland, still beautiful, though faded, and exquisitely dressed, lay
on her couch amid becomingly arranged furs and shawls; Henry ‘
sat by her on a. low seat, and rendered her various little ﬁlial atten-
tions; Mr. Muitland sat facing the ﬁre, with its light playing on his
silvery hair and clean-cut features, the prototype of Cyril’s.
On the other side of the hearth sat Lilian, with the tea-table at
her side; Winnie was on a stool at her feet, her head pressed to
hersister’s knee, on which reposcd, in careless majesty, Mark An-
tony, gracefully toying with the golden curls tossed in pretty negli-
gence within reach of his paws. The warm rug before the ﬁre
was occupied by the terrier and the pug, the children’s tea-cups,
and the recumbent full-length of Lennie, who sprang to his feet
from time to time to pass people‘s cups.
Lilian spoke little. She and Henry did not address each other
once; but his eye never lost the picture on the opposite side of the
ﬁre, which reminded him of Raﬂ'aellc’s Virgin of the Cardellino.
It was not that Lilian’s intelligent face in the least resembled that
harmless, faultlesst featured Madonna’s, though her deep gray eyes
were bent down much in the same way on the child-face and sportive
animal on her knee as the Virgin's in the picture. It was the look
of divine, innocent, ineﬁ'able content that she wore. And yet
Everard did not appear to be looking at this charming picture,


## p. 60 (#66) ##############################################

60 THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND.
though Lilian knew that he saw it, and was equally conscious of
the picture he made, his broad shoulders and athletic limbs afford-
ing a ﬁne contrast to her mother‘s fragile, faded grace.
“ And what are your plans, Henry? ” asked Mr. Maitland at last,
when Cyril’s affairs had been discussed over and over again.
“I think of buying a good practice near Southampton, and set-
tling down as a country doctor,” he replied. “I have enough
property to make me fairly independent, and shall be able to carry
on my scientific pursuits without fear of starvation.”
“And the next step, I suppose, will be to take a wife? ”
“The very next step,” replied Everard, looking thoughtfully
into the glowing heart of the ﬁre.
Lilian bent her head a little, and caught away a curl at which
Mark Antony was snatching. “If no one is going to have any
more tea, pussy shall have the rest of the cream,” she said.
Cyril, in the mean time, quickly found his way to the well-
knovm room called Lilian’s, where Marion was sitting, in the dusk,
alone, but acutely conscious of the light, swift steps along the cor-
ridor which bore her expected lover to her side. They met in
silence, each young heart being too full for speech : and it was not
until Cyril had released Marion from his embrace, and placed her in
a chair by the ﬁreside, that he said, kneeling on the rug near her:
“Am I indeed quite forgiven, Marion? "
“You foolish fellow! How many times have I written that
word ? ” she replied, laughing.
“Written, yes; but I want to hear it from your own lips—I
want to be quite sure,” he continued, with unabated earnestness,
the blue ﬁre of his eyes bent upon her soft brown gaze, while he
held both her hands pressed against his breast.
“Dear Cyril, you make too much of what is better forgotten,”
she said. “ We quarreled long ago and made it up long ago, though
we have not met since."
“Forgotten? Oh, Marion, do you think I can ever forget?
And though you forgive me, do you think I can ever forgive my-
self '1 ”
“Certainly. Don’t lovers always quarrel; and are they not
better friends afterward? And don’t you mean to forgive poor,
me? Ihave forgiven us both; though, indeed, those few months
were very dreadful."
“ Dreadful I They were more than dreadful to me. Oh, Marion,

if you knew, if you only dreamed, how unworthy I am, you who
are so white, so stainless! You can never guess. Sometimes I
wonder that I ever dare hope to call you mine, so black amI in
comparison with you.” -
“Oyril, this is lover’s talk—exaggeration. It makes me feel
ashamed,” she replied, soft blushes stealing over her gentle face in
the ﬁrelight; “it makes me remember that I am but a weak, fool-
ish girl, and greatly need the guidance of a strong, good man like
you.”
“Good! God help me! ” he exclaimed, turning his face from
the modest glance that seemed to scorch his very soul. “Marion,
I am not good; there is no weaker man than I on God’s earth, and
without youI think I should be utterly lost. Do you know—no,
you never can know—what it is to be able to love a good woman;
to feel the vileness die out of one at the very thought of her; to be
strengthened and puriﬁed by the very atmosphere she breathes ;—-
to feel at the thought of losing her—Marion, dear Marion, I think
sometimes if you knew the darkness that was upon my soul during
those wretched months when we were parted, I fear—oh, I fear
that you would cast me of? with loathing and scorn—”
Marion smiled a gentle smile, only dimly seeing the passionate
agony in Cyril’s shadowed face. “ I know that I could never scorn
you,” she interrupted, with tender emphasis.
- Cyril bent his head over her hands in silence for a few seconds;
and then, looking up again, said in a more collected manner, “Mari-
on, will-you take me, worthless as I am, and bear with me and cleave
to me through good and evil report, and help me, in spite of the
past, to be a better man? ”
“Dear,” she replied gently, “I have taken you for better and
for worse. I don’t expect you to be faultless, though I do admire
and honor you above all men. I should be sorry if you were fault-
less, because, you know, I am not faultless myself; I am not like
Lilian, even. We shall help each other to be wiser and better, I
hope.”
Cyril had averted his face from the innocent, loving gaze he
could not endure, but he turned once more and looked into Marion’s
charming face, which was radiant in a sudden burst of ﬁrelight,
while his own remained in darker shadow than ever. “Promise
once more,” he said, in low, impassioned tones, “ that you will never
leave me.“


## p. 62 (#68) ##############################################

62 .THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND.
Marion suffered herself to glide into the embrace before her, and
repeated the promise, half laughing to herself at the foolish impor-
tance assigned to triﬂes by lovers, and half believing in the intensity
of the oft-repeated assurances, and was very happy until a discreet ~
clatter of silver and china was heard outside, followed by a knock
at the door, and, after an interval, the entrance of Eliza, who was
ediﬁed to ﬁnd Marion at one end of the room, adjusting some china
on a bracket. and Cyril at the other, gazing out of the window with
great interest at the frosty stars.
When the candles were lighted, the curtains drawn, and the tea
poured out, all traces of his passionate agitation had left Cyril’s
beautiful, severely cut features, and he sat by Marion’s side, teacup
in hand, quiet and content, the very picture of the ideal curate of l
commonplace just dropped in to tea. ‘
Marion now saw him clearly, and was distressed at his wan and
worn appearance, and also at a certain look he never had before
the fatal winter she passed in the Mediterranean with her brother.
Since then she had met him face to face but once, on the day when
he came to ask forgiveness and renew the engagement, and then,
naturally, he did not look like his old self. Was it only toil which
had robbed Cyril of the bloom of his youth? she wondered; and
she sighed. “It was time you had a holiday,l think,” she said
softly. “You must not be such an ascetic any more; you do not
belong to a celibate priesthood, remember.”
“ This is not exactly the cell of an anchorite,” replied Cyril, with
the smile which won so many hearts, as he rested his head comfort-
ably on the back of his low chair, and gazed upon Marion’s slender
grace. “Mayn‘t I have another lump of sugar, Marion? Lilian
and I have expended much thought on the decoration of this
room.”
“ And taste,” said Marion, looking round upon the pictures and
bric-d-brac and various evidences of cultured taste, though it is not
to be supposed that the two lovers were there to discuss nothing
but the decoration of Lilian’s room.
Cyril had spoken hotly of his dislike to Marion’s Mediterranean
tour; and Marion’s pride had been touched till she reminded him
that she was entirely her own mistress, and might probably continue
so to the end of the chapter. Then ensued a quarrel, only half seri-
ous on either side, a quarrel that a word or a look would have
righted in a moment. But, unfortunately, Marion had to join her

THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND. 63
friends, the Wilmots, sooner than she anticipated, and thus hurried
off before she could say good-by to Cyril, and make things straight
with one little smile.
The game of quarreling, when carried on between two young,
ardent lovers, is a very pretty diversion, but can not possibly be
played at a distance, as these two found to their cost. Deprived of
the fairy artillery of glances, sighs, voices, and gestures, and con-
ﬁned to the heavy ordnance of letters, they could not bring things
to a happy conclusion. Letters were ﬁrst hot, then cold, then rare,
then non-existent, until one day Cyril wrote, after long silence, to
ask Marion how long she meant to play with his affections. Marion
replied that if Cyril considered their engagement as a mere pastime,
the sooner it was broken off the better. Cyril wrote back to
release her from an engagement which he said he perceived had
become distasteful to her.
This was in March. At Whitsuntide, Everard spent some time
at Melbourne, whence Cyril went to Btlminster for ordination at
Trinity. He thought Cyril unhappy, and after the ordination he
asked him, subsequently to some conversation with Lilian on the
subject, if he still cared for Marion, to which Cyril replied in the
afﬁrmative. Then Henry told him that Marion was pining and
showing tendencies to consumption. She was the kind of woman,
he said, whose health is perfect in happiness, but who breaks down
the moment that elixir of life is denied. He thought that she loved
Cyril still.
-. Thus emboldened, Cyril owned himself in the wrong, and sued
for a return to favor. He could, however, only afford one brief
interview with Marion, since he had with some difﬁculty freed him-
self from the curacy at Shotover, which had given him a title to
deacon’s orders, and got himself placed on a mission staff in the
East of London, where he led a semi-monastic life in a house with
his fellow-curates, and enjoyed to the full the hard labor for which
he had clamored so eagerly while at Shotover.
The situation was eminently unfavorable to courtship, while it
seemed to render marriage absolutely impracticable. Cyril, how-
ever, found a means of reconciling duty with inclination, and easily
convinced his rector that his labors would be equally valuable if he
had a home of his own within easy reach of the scene of his toils,
and thus they were to be married in the spring. The narrow
means which so frequently darken the horizon of curates’ love-

dreams had no place in this romance, since both Cyril and Marion
v had wherewithal to keep the wolf from the door.
But they are together at last, and the dark days which divided
them are to be forgotten.
“When I hear the word ‘misery,’ I think of last spring," said
Marion, laughing.
Cyril’s face clouded, and he turned away and gazed at the fire.
“Never think of it! " he exclaimed, suddenly turning a bright,
animated gaze upon Marion. “I shall drive it from your memory,
dear, by every act and thought of my life.”
Dinner, the hour so fondly welcomed by mortals in general,
came all too soon for these; and, indeed, it was not till the others
had taken their places at the table that Marion made her appear-
ance, ﬂushed and charming, and met her brother for the ﬁrst time
since his arrival in the house.
“This is an improvement,” he said; holding her at arm’s length
to look at her, “ on the mealy-faced girl I saw three months ago.
Pray, miss, where do you get your rouge? ”
“ Manufactured on the estate, Henry,” replied Mr. Maitland.
“Native Melbourne rouge. Let us hope Cyril may acquire some
of it.”
“It comes oﬁ' easily,” said Everard, gravely, while Cyril became
absorbed in Mark Antony, who sat on a stool at Lilian‘s side at the
head of the table, with his chin on a level with the clothfand who
was so enchanted to ﬁnd himself with a twin on each side of him,
that his deep melliﬂuous purrs threatened to drown the conversa-
tion. '
“ You will be glad to hear that Granfer is still alive and well,
and wiser than ever, Henry,” said Mrs. Maitland, who was sitting
on his right, having, as usual, resigned the head of the table to
Lilian.
“I congratulate Melbourne, Mrs. Maitland. It could never go
on without Granfer’s advice. And the discontented Baines has not
yet blown you all up? And friend Wax still wields the ferule in
deﬁance of Lilian? ” >
“ But not in church,” said Lilian.
“Because Lilian steals the cane if he brings it,” added Ms-
rion.
“And is anybody engaged, or born, or dead? ” continued
Everard, gayly. “By the way, what has happened to Ben Lee?

It struck me that he had been drinking this afternoon. And our,
friend Alma, how is she? ”
There was a dead silence for a second or two, and Everard’s
eager gaze of inquiry met no response from the eyes bent resolutely
on the plates. .
“Let me send you some more beef, Henry,” said Mr. Maitland,
looking up from his joint with sudden briskness. “ Come, where
is your boasted appetite ? Yes, bring Dr. Everard’s plate,
Eliza.”
“But Alma? Oh, I hope there is nothing wrong with her?”
continued Everard, looking round with a dismayed gaze, while
Mrs. Maitland laid her hand warningly on his sleeve. “Oh, Lilian,
Alma is not dead 2 ”
“ Worse,” replied Lilian, in a low voice—“far worse.”
7 There were tears, he saw, trembling upon her eyelashes; and if
ever tears resembled pearls, then, he thought, did those precious
drops, and if ever mortal woman was dear, then was Lilian. He
saw it all now on the instant, and he remembered how much Lilian
had done for Alma, and how at Whitsnntide she had spoken of her
and cared about her absence from the Sacrament, and so dismayed
was he by this catastrophe that, having none of the ready resources
and ﬁne tact which insure social success, he simply, like the honest,
clumsy fellow he was, dropped his knife and fork, and gazed horror-
struck before him. Fortunately, at that moment Lennie, who was
stretched on the hearth-rug, intent upon “Ivanhoe,” bethougbt him-
self of an important event, and took advantage of the silence to
proclaim it.
“I say, Henry,” he exclaimed, “ what do you think? Pm going
into trousers to-morrow.”
“Why, it was all over Oldport,” said Cyril. “Bills in every
window. ‘Oh yes! oh yes! oh yes! Know all by these presents
that Lennie Maitland goes into trousers to-morrow.’ ”
“Oh, won’t I smack you by-and-byl ” observed Lennie, tran-
quilly returning to the gests of Brian de Bois-Guilbert.
“I think, Cyril, you scarcely appreciate the honor ydur brother
intends you,” said Mr. Maitland. “He dons these virile garments
for the purpose of hearing your sermon. Ile evidently holds
trousers to be conducive to a pious frame of mind, or at least to a
certain mental receptivity; eh, Lennie, lad? ”
“The unfortunate tailor’s life has been a burden to him in the

fear that the suit would not be ready in time,” said Mrs. Mait-
land.
“In time to hear Cywil pweach,” added Marion, laugh-
mg.
“How many times have they been tried on, Lennie?” asked
Lilian.
“Never you mind their rubbish,” said Everard; “ask Miss
Mawion how often she calls me Henwy? ”
“And wail will line the pockets with silver for you,” added
Cyril, who was looking very happy, having, as Eliza observed
with satisfaction, his hand locked in Marion‘s under the table-
cloth. '
No sooner had the ladies withdrawn, than Everard burst out,
“And who is the scoundrel? ”
“Softly, softly, Henry! beware of rash judgments,” returned
Mr. Maitland, whose face took a grieved look. “Nothing is
known, which is hateful to me because of the great wave of
scandal and the dreadful scorching of tongues which arises about
the matter. Lee, I know not why, assumes that it is a gentleman;
and public opinion, and, I fear I must add, his reputation, point to
Ingram Swaynestone. Sir Lionel has spoken to him, but he abSo-
luter denies it; and, indeed—”
“In short,” broke in Oyril, who was extremely busy with some
walnuts on his plate, “the less said about these miserable scandals
the better.”
“ True, quite true,” said his father, with a heavy sigh.
“But Alina! the little girl we used to play with at the Temple,
with Lilian, and often Ingram, and the girl Swaynestones! ” cried
Henry. “I can not believe any wrong of her. She has been
wronged—of that I am sure.” ,
“Truly, I had never dreamed of such trouble for Alma, poor
child!” said Mr. Maitland. “Elsewhere in the parish, of course,
one dreads such things, knowing their temptations. It is a heavy
grief for me, Henry, as you may imagine.”
“ And for Lilian," added Everard. “ Yes, I know how you love
your spiritual children, sir, and can imagine your distress. And
poor Lee, he was so proud of her. He is sullen, I see; a sure sign
of grief. Oh, I hope he is not unkind to her I ”
“The step-mother is hard, and has a sharp tongue! She forgets
what poor Alma did for her child. Altogether, it is a. sad, sad his-

A
tory. The Temple, I suppose, holds more unhappiness than any
house in the country.”
“Oh, really, my dear father,” exclaimed Cyril, who seemed
pained beyond endurance, “you must not take it so to heart! She
is not the ﬁrst—"
“ By Jove, Maillandl ” interrupted Everard, “you are the last
man from whom I should expect an echo of Mephistopheles. He
never said anything more diabolical than that—"Sis ist die Erste
nicht.’ ”
Cyril colored so hotly that he exhibited the phenomenon of a
black blush, while Mr. Maitland hastened to say that Cyril was in a
different position from Faust, who had wrought the wrong " And
then,” he added, “Cyril is doubtless weary of sin and sorrow, of
which, in his parish, he must have far more than we in our simple
rustic home have any idea of, busy as Satan undoubtedly is every-
where.”
“Quite so,” returned Cyril, wearily. “My words sounded un-
fortunately, Everard; but, as my father suggests, when one has
brealdasted and lunched for weeks upon peccant parishioner, one
does not enjoy the same dish at dinner.”
Everard’s rejoinder was prevented by the intrusion of a sunny
head at the door, and the clear voice of Winnie was heard crying,
“Do make haste! Me and Lennie want to know what is in that
basket, and Lilian won’t let us.” Whereupon Cyril sprang up and
chased the delighted child through the ball and into the drawing-
room, where she took refuge, screaming, in Lilian’s dress.
_ The basket which so stimulated the children’s curiosity was well
known to contain the young men’s Christmas gifts to the family, and
'was forthwith uncovered amid a scene of joyous turbulence, and
had its contents distributed.
The task of collecting the parcels in the basket and conveying
them to the drawing-room had been performed by Eliza with thrills
of delicious agony, for it was almost beyond human nature not to
take at least one peep at a packet containing the very ribbon she
longed for. and at another revealing glimpses of a perfect love of a
shawl, which proved to be destined for cook. However, she ap-
peared with a perfectly demure countenance when fetched by Len-
nie, with the other maids, to receive her presents. By that time
Mr. Maitland had become lost to all earthly cares, in an arm-chair,
with an old battered volume Everard had picked up at a book-stall

in Paris for him; Winnie was wondering if some fairy had informed
Henry that a ﬁshing-rod of her very own had been her soul’s unat-
tainable star for months; and Lennie was dancing round the room
with an illustrated “ Don Quixote” clasped in his arms.
It was pleasant to see Cyril making his gifts. Each was offered
with a suitable word, tender or droll, according to the recipient,
and with the grace that an emperor might have envied, though a
carping observer would have detected that the gifts themselves had
been purchased as nearly as possible at the same shop. As for
Everard, he made his oﬁ’erings with a sneaking air, and seemed
glad to get them off his hands. He threw the “ Don Quixote " at
Lennie, with “ Here, you scamp! ” and placed the invalid reading-
stand by Mrs. Maitland, with an awkward, “I don’t know if this
thing will be any good to you.”
“ Why, Henry, who told you that father’s life has been a. burden
to him for months for want of that old edition? ” asked Lilian.
“He is a wizard; he should be burned,” laughed Cyril, reﬂect-
ing inwardly that while his gifts cost money, Everard’s cost time
and thought and inﬁnite trouble in hunting out.
“ But ain’t Lilian to have anything?” inquired the ingenuous
Lennie; for Lilian and Cyril never gave each other presents—they
had things so much in common, and Everard appeared to have for-
gotten her.
Lilian appealed, as usual, to Mark Antony for sympathy, and
Everard grew very hot, while Cyril absorbed himself in ﬁtting the
bracelet he had given Marion upon her slender arm. Then Lilian
looked up.
“It was horrid of you to forget me, Henry,” she said.‘
“ I didn’t forget you,” stammered Everard; “ but the thing was
so triﬂing I hadn’t the courage-~ It‘s only a photograph of the _
picture which inspired Browning’s ‘Guardian Angel.’ Here it is,
if you think it worth having. You said you would give anything
to see Guercino’s picture at Fano.”
“ 0 Henry, how very kind and thoughtful of you! ” exclaimed
Lilian, her face transﬁgured with pleasure. “ But I thought there
was no photograph?”
“Well, no; but young Stobart was doing Italy in the autumn,
and I got him to go to Fano with his camera. It wasn’t far out of
his way,” he replied, in a tone of apology.
Lennie’s solicitude being relieved, he and the others were air

sorbed each after his own fashion; no one observed these two.
Lilian looked up at Henry, who had thrown himself into a low
chair by her side, so that their faces were on a level. Her eyes
were dewy and bright; they gazed straight into his for a minute,
and then fell. “You had it done for me,” she murmured.
It was the crowning moment of Everard’s happy night. He
bent over the spirit-like hand resting on the cat, and unseen pressed
his lips to it. He knew that Lilian loved him, and knew that he
loved her. He said nothing more; it was enough bliss for one day.
CHAPTER VII.
Barons going to rest that night, Mr. Maitland led Everard to
his study, and there subjected him to a searching cross~examinati0n
on the subject of Cyril’s care-worn and unhealthy appearance,
which Everard referred to his overzeal in his labors, and the exces-
' sive austerities which be practiced. ‘
“It would be all very well for him to mortify his ﬂesh if he had
too much of it to balance his spirit,” Everard observed; “ but, as a
matter of fact, he has too little.”
“Cyril is sensitive,” his father replied; “his nerves are too
tensely strung, like those of all extremely reﬁned and poetic natures.
We thought, Lilian and I, that it was the estrangement from Marion
which was preying on him. It was that which caused him to leave
Shotover, and plunge into this terriﬁc London work—that and, of
course, higher motives.”
“ Cyril, though healthy. is delicate," replied Everard. “ He
ought never to fast; he can not bear it, especially when working.
His brain will give way under such discipline. Observe him to-
morrow when he preaches. There is too much nervous excite-
ment.”
The next morning Cyril did not appear till the end' of breakfast,
and then took nothing but a cup of codes.
“Really, Cyril, I did think Sunday at least was a feast-day! ”
cried Everard, pausing in his own manful assault on a well-piled
plate of beef.
“But Cyril is to celebrate to-day; he must fast,” Lilian explained;

and then Everard observed that Mr. Maitland‘s breakfast COHSld-Qd
of nothing, and groaned within himself, and asked his friends if
they considered it decorous .tor clergy-men to faint in the midst of
public worship.
“ When a man has to work, he should feed himself into proper
condition,” he said to unheeding ears.
After breakfast, the Maitland family repaired in a body to the
Sunday school, and Everard went out to smoke a pipe alone, and,
the frost being keen, he wore an overcoat, ﬁnding one of his own
in the hall. He had some difﬁculty in putting it on, and could not
by any means induce it to meet across the chest. This gave him
great satisfaction. “It can not be that my Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes take up so much room,” he mused. “ No; I am increasing
in girth round the chest. Who could imagine that one night’s hap-
piness and country air would produce such an eﬁ‘ect‘l A new sci-
entiﬁc fact.”
It was pleasant on the lawn in the frosty Sunday stillness. The
sunbeams danced on the evergreens and smiled on the Shotover
parklands; a robin sang its cheerfully pathetic song; and a ﬂock
of rooks uttered their breezy caws in the pale blue above his head.
Everard smoked with profound enjoyment ; he thought of last
night’s enchantment, and the promise he had just extracted from
Lilian to sit with him in the Rectory pew instead of with the school-
children. His hands were thrust for warmth into his coat-pockets,
and in one of them he felt the square outline of a letter, Which he
drew out, wondering—since his habits were neat and methodical, as
became a student of natural science—how he came to leave a letter
there. The letter, however, had no envelope and no address. He
opened it, and found, in the half-formed, clear writing of an un-
learned person, probably some patient in humble life, the follow-
mg:
“No, I will never, never marry you. What good could that do
me, new you do not love me no more—me that loved you better
than Heaven and her own poor soul? Would I like to see you mis-
erable, and spoil your prospex? To marry the likes of me would
ruin you, and how could that make me happy? Marry her; it is
better for you. I have done wrong for love of you, and God will
punish me. But you are sorry, and will be forgiven. Farewell for
ever. Your broken-hearted A.”

THE SILENCE OF DEAN ﬁfAITLAND. 71
The gracious light of the wintry morning seemed to fade out of
the pale pure sky; there was no more delight in the robin’s song;
the bright crystals of the hear-frost sparkled in vain for Everard.
“Why, why are there such things? ” he murmured. “Why was
Cyril’s echo of Mephistopheles so much more poignant in its cyni-
cism because of its truth? ” ‘
I The weak suffering, the strong going soot-free; Alcestis plung-
ing, love-radiant, into the darkness of Hades, while Admetus re-
joices in the light of heaven; women trusting, and men deceiving—
what a worldl All the confused misery of the painful insoluble
riddle of earth seemed to awake and trouble the clear happiness of
Everard’s soul at the story told in the poor little scrap of paper, the
more pathetic for its bad spelling and artless grammar. And how
came such an epistle in his pocket? Doubtless some friend had
borrowed his coat; some heedless rackcty medical student, per-
chance, and ﬂavored it with tobacco and correspondence. “ Sie ist
die Erste nicht,” the rocks seemed to say in their pleasant, fresh
morning caws.
But now the bells came chiming slowly on the clear air, those
dear, drowsy three strokes which awoke in his heart so many echoes
of home and boyhood/and sweet innocent life beneath the beloved
root Where Lilian dwelt; bells calling people to come and pray, to
think of God and heaven, and forsake all the sin and sorrow of the
troubled earth—calling people to hear how even such black things
as the letter told of might be made white again like snow; to hear
the kind fatherly counsels of such as Mr. Maitland or Cyril. And
his heart swelled when he thought that Cyril had devoted his stain-
less youth. his bright promise, and his splendid gifts to a calling
which, however vainly, tried to stem the tide of all this mad, sad
evil, and lift men out of the mire of earth’s misery. How beautiful '
to have Cyril’s faith, and the power of thus consecrating himself 1
How poor in comparison his own career, devoted merely to the heal-
ing of men’s bodies, to the satisfaction ofnoble desire for knowledge,
and the widening the horizon of men’s thoughtsl
Like all thinkers, and especially those whose thoughts dwell
much on the study of natural facts, Everard had many doubtspand
often feared that the Christianity so dear to him through instinct,
training, and association, might be, after all, but a fairy dream.
But the atmosphere of Melbourne, and more especially the inﬂuence
sf Mr. Maitland’s genuine and practical piety, together with Cyril’s

bright enthusiasm, quenched these doubts as nothing else could;
and now the village bells fell like balm on his troubled soul, and he
responded with cheery good temper to Lennie, who came bounding
over the lawn in the proud consciousness of trousers, crying,
“Come along, Henry, and look at Lilian’s donkey.”
He thrust the paper in his pocket, and, taking the little fellow’s
hand, trotted off with him toward Winnie, who was approaching
them at headlong pace, with curls streaming in the wind, and soon
seized his other hand, and led him to the meadow, where he beheld
one of the sorriest beasts he had ever set eyes on, cropping th
frosty grass, and winking lazily in the sun. '
“ What can Lilian do with such a creature? ” he asked.
“Oh, she makes it happy, like all her things,” replied Lennie.
“ Won’t you stare when you see her three-legged cat, and the fox
with the broken leg she has in the stable! ”
“She likes hurt things,” commented Winnie, while Lennie
related how Lilian met this donkey one day in the road leading
over the downs. It was harnessed to a cart laden with vegetables,
and had fallen between the shafts, where its owner, a brutal, bad
fellow, well known in Malbourne, was furiously belaboring it.
“Didn‘t he stare when Lilian caught him by the collar and
pulled him oﬂ the donkey! ” said Lennie. “ Then he fell all of a
tremble, and Lilian told him he would be sent to prison or ﬁned.
And he said he was too poor to buy another donkey, and couldn’t
help this one growing old and weak. So Lilian gave him ten shil-
lings for it."
“Dear Lilian!” Everard said to himself“, as he looked at the
wretched beast with its stiff limbs and body scarred by old sores
and stripes. “ Which do you love best, Winnie, Lilian, or Cyril? ”
“ Cyril,” replied both children, unhesitatingly, but could give no
reason for their preference until Lennie, after long cogitatiou, said,
“He does make a fellow laugh so.”
Everard smiled, and thought of Wordsworth’s boy with his
weathercock. The day was warmer now, and bidding Lennie run
indoors with his great coat, he set oﬁ to church with the children.
It was a matter of time for a person of any consideration to get
through Melbourne churchyard, for there, grouped upon either side
the porch, lounged a. little crowd of Malbourne worthies, solemnly
passing the churchgoers in review, and headed, of course, by Granfer
in a clean white smock-frock, and with his hale old many-colored

I
visage and veined hands looking purplish in the frosty air. Tom
Hale was there, making a bright center to the cool -toncd picture in
his red tunic and spotless, well-brushed clothes; while Jim, with
open breast and sailor garb, lent a bit of picturesque that not even
the Sunday coats of Baine’s manufacture could quite subdue.
Lennie held up his head, and felt that his trousers were making
a deep impression; while Everard stopped and wished a good morn-
ing to them all, smock-frocks, Sunday coats, and uniforms, and
received a little digniﬁed patronage from Granfer, who had always
regarded him with some disparagement as being neither a Swayne-
stone nor a Maitland, but a mere appendage to the latter family, a
circumstance which helped to render Granfer the delight of Ever-
ard's life.
The present moment did not ﬁnd Granfer conversational, his
mental powers being concentrated on observing the animated
scene before him. There was Farmer Long, with his wife and
daughters in their warm scar-lets and purples, to scrutinize as they
st/relled along the road and over the church-yard path; then the
more distant farmers who drove up to the lychgate in old-fashioned
gigs, and, having dropped their families, hastened to the Sun to put
up the strong, coarse-limbed horses; then came the Garretts from
Northover, new people, whom Malbourne regarded as mere mush-
room pretenders, with a mixture of scorn and envy. They came
on foot, their own gates being but a stone’s throw from the church,
a. handsome family of sons and daughters, coeval with the Maitlands.
To them Granfer’s salutation was almost inﬁnitesimal in its elabo-
rate graduation. Then, blending with the drowsy chime of the three
hells, arose the clatter of hoofs and the roll of wheels. and the
Swaynestone landau, with its splendid high-stepping horses, swept
easily up to the gate, the silver-mounted harness, the silken coats of
the steeds, the panels, and the revolving wheel-spokes ﬂashing in
the sun. Granfer did not know it, but perhaps he dimly felt that
the splendor of this apparition somehow enlarged and beautiﬁed the
dim, narrow horizon of his life.
Ben Lee’s very livery, not to speak of his skillful and effective
' driving, contributed vaguely to Granfer’s importance; as also did
the courteous elegance and ﬁnely built form of Sir Lionel. and the
manner in which, the footman having retired at a look, he handed
out 'Lady Swaynestone and his daughter Ethel, in their velvets and
furs. ButGranfer was distressed to see that Ben Lee no longer

drove up with his former dash, and turned his shining steeds in the
direction of the Sun with no more consequence than if he had been ‘
driving a mere brewer’s dray. “Ah, Ben ain’t the man he was] ”
he muttered, after having helped Sir Lionel and his family with the
sunshine of his approbation into church.
Then came the tripping, whispering procession of school‘chil- _
dren, led by the rector, followed by Wax, who was involved in the
double misery of new Sunday broadcloth and the absence of his
cane, without which emblem of authority he was ever a lost man;
and last of all came Cyril, who found time for a word and a smile
for each of the group, and left them all exhilaratcd by his passing
presence as if by a draught of wine. Then the bells ceased, the
loungers entered the church, and Granfer himself, the sunshine
warming his wintry white hair, walked slowly with the aid of his
stout oak staﬁ' up the center aisle to his allotted place.
He was already seated, and Cyril’s musical voice had given a
deeper pathos to the sentence, “Hide thy face from my sins,” when
Ingram Swaynestone and his sister Maude entered, rosy and fresh
from their long brisk walk in the frosty morning. Ingram Swayne-
stone was tall and fair and strongly built, the typical young English-
man, who belongs to no class and only one country, physically per- ‘
feet, good tempered, and well spoken, with a perfect digestion and
a nervous system undistraught by intellectual burdens and riddles of
the painful earth. His appearance with his pretty, fair-haired sister
caused a tiny stir almost imperceptible, like a summer breath _.
through ripe corn, among the fairer portion of the congregation,
with whom he was extremely popular, not only on account of his
good looks and known appreciation of feminine charms, but also
because of a faint delicious aroma of wickedness that hung about
his name. ,
The devotions of several undoubtedly pious young maidens were
more than once interrupted for the purpose of looking to see if he
was looking, which he certainly was at every one of them in turn,
when opportunity permitted ; while Cyril’s beautiful voice rang
through the church, and Everard and Lilian, who had always loved
and admired the simple majesty of the Liturgy, felt that they had
never before known its real beauty.
When he read of the Massacre of the Innocents, one or two
women cried. The tone in which he read that Rachel was weeping _
for her children and would not be comforted, poignantly reminded

them that they could never be comforted for their lost little ones
> buried outside in the sunny church-yard. Henry, and Lilian, and
Marion, and the children all gazed up with admiring aﬂection at the
eautiful young priest standing white-robed outside the chancel
at the eagle lectern, Henry thinking that the music of Cyril’s voice
alone surpassed any chanted cathedral service.
Often in after years did Henry and Lilian think of that sweet
Sunday morning with refreshment: the solemn beauty of the old
church, with its heavy Norman arches; the sunshine stealing in,
mellow and soft, through the south windows and tinging the snowy
frock of Greater, who sat just below the chance], and leaned for-
ward on his staﬁ in an attitude of rapt attention; the innocent looks
of the choir-boys, among whom was Dickey Stevens, fourth in
descent from Granfer, and whom Lilian had delivered from the tyr-
anny of the rod ; and Mr. Maitland’s reverend aspect, as he bent his
silvered head and listened to Cyril’s pure voice.
But the moment, which lingered in his heart’s memory till
his dying day, was that in which he knelt with Marion and
Lilian and the villagers at the altar, and received the holy sym-
bols from Cyril’s own consecrated hands. He never forgot
Cyril's pale, saint-like features and white-stoled form, the crim-
son from a martyr’s robe in the south chancel window staining
in a long bar the priest‘s breast and hands and the very chalice
he held.
“I was so glad,” Lilian said, when they were walking home
together, Marion having stopped to speak to some one, “ to see you
there, Ilenry, because Cyril is often troubled about your daring
speculations.”
"‘ Your father never fails to still my doubts, Lilian,” he replied.
“ There is that in his plain, unpretending sermons, which carries
conviction straight into one’s heart. Sermons, as a rule, simply
bore me: but Mr. Maitland‘s— Well, you know, he always was
my beau ideal of a parish priest.”
Lilian’s face kindled. “You are the only person who really
appreciates my father,” she replied. “Even Cyril does not quite
know what gifts he has buried in this tiny rustic place, and willingly
and consciously buried.”
“I honor his intellect, but still more his heart, which speaks not
only in his studiously plain sermons, but even more in his life.
'Cyril could take no better model.”

“True; yet we all think Cyril destined to something higher,”
replied Lilian.
“By the way, Henry,” said Cyril, at luncheon, “I took your
overcoat by mistake this morning. I hope it didn’t put you out
much; my things are all too small for you.”
“That fellow is always appropriating my property, and I am too
big to retaliate,” growled Everard, who had forgotten all about the
tight overcoat of the morning.
“ Oh, I say, Cywil," broke in Lennie, “wasn’t Ingwam Swayne-
stone in a wage with you for not pweaching this morning! He
came to church on purpose, and he does hate going to church in
the winter, he says, because the cold nips the girls’ noses and makes
them look so ugly.”
“He doesn’t mean that nonsense, Lennie,” said Mr. Maitland,
laughing gently. “ He pays his rector a ﬁne compliment, to say
the least of it,” he added.
Cyril, who was by no means making up for his morning fast,
looked as if he thought Ingram was more likely to be interested in
the color of girls’ noses than the quality of any sermons. Then he
learned how Ingram had called with offers of guns and horses to
Everard and himself, and had been at play with Winnie, who was
now in dire disgrace and condemned to go without pudding, in
consequence of having made lngram’s nose bleed.
“Oh, really, mother! ” he exclaimed, stroking the bright curls
brushing his arms, “ isn’t that rather hard? Winnie did not mean
it; it might have been her nose. Do you think Ingram will go
without pudding, Win? Let her off, mother. I never saw a little
girl behave better in church.”
Whereupon Winnie was respited, after many comments from
her elders on her rough ways and romping habits and constant
_breakages, which, it appeared, were a source of perennial disgrace
to the little girl.
Cyril had very tender ways with children, and was almost as
sorry for hurt things as Lilian. That very afternoon a child
stumbled and fell on the way to church, and Everard saw him slip
aside in his long cassock, and pick up the howling, dust-covered
urchin with some merry, tender observation, wipe away the tears
and blood with his own spotless handkerchief before Wax had time
to bring out a denunciation on the brat’s heedlessuess, and comfort
him ﬁnally with pence, though the parson’s bell had rung, and Mrs.

Wax had come to the end of her voluntary 0n the harmonium, and
begun over again in despair.
The morning congregation had received some additions, to wit,
those lazy Sabbatarians who kept their day of rest so literally as to
get up too late to go to church in the morning, those mothers too
fatigued by performing the family toilettes to perform their own,
and those who cooked the Sunday dinners and minded the babies,
the majority of which latter accompanied their parents to afternoon
service. It was pleasant, too, to 'observe that Ingram Swayne-
stone’s piety had conquered his pain at the eclipse of feminine
beauty, and that he helped to swell the little crowd. ,
When Cyril ascended the pulpit, he looked round the dim
church with an anxious, searching gaze, and Lilian observed that
his eye rested with apprehension on the Lees’ pew, and he ap-
peared relieved when he saw Mrs. Lee standing there alone. Then
he glanced in the direction of the Swaynestone servants’ pew,
where Ben Lee sat, glurn and downcast, and Judkins, with a
haggard look, held his hymn-book before his face. They were
singing “Hark, the herald angels,” Job Stubbs and Dickie Stevens
bringing out the treble with a will, and the bases bearing their
parts manfully.
Cyril distinguished all the voices—those of Lilian and Everard,
Marian and the children, Sir Lionel and his daughters, the Rectory I
maids, the smock-frocks, Tom and Jim Hale, Baines, the tailor, who
was only an occasional church-goer, and loved to air his bass occa-
sionally in orthodox ears—he heard even Granfer’s own tremulous
quaver, which had been a tenor of local celebrity, and a crowd of
young memories rushed over him. He clutched the edge of the
pulpit, regardless of the holly-wreath which encircled it and
pricked his ﬁngers, and, when the last notes of “ Herald angels ”
died away in the ﬁnal quaver of an old woman half a bar behind,
was silent for a few moments.
At last he recovered himself, and gave out his text—“Keep
innocency, and take heed to the thing that is right, for that shall
bring a man peace at the last.”
'He felt them all gazing up at him—Lennie and Winnie, with
their innocent eyes and mouths wide open to hear “Cywil
pweach”; his mother, who seldom ventured to church; Farmer
Long and his family; the well-known villagers; Granfer, with his
head on one side, like an old bird, the better to hear him; Ben

Lee—yes, Ben Lee was looking; his father in the chancel was look-
ing also.
Cyril turned pale; Marion caught her breath, but was soon
quieted by the clear. pure notes of the young preacher’s voice. He
could not but pause, he said, before that congregation, and question
himself deeply and sternly before be presumed to address them.
They had seen him grow up among them. Many were his elders,
had held him in their arms, chidden the faults of his boyhood,
taught him, cared for him; many had been his playmates and com-
panions, known his weaknesses, shared, perchance, in his escapades.
How should he speak to them?
Everard disapproved of these personal remarks; and yet, when
he heard the silver tones of Cyril’s voice, his easy ﬂowing sentences,
and the delicacy of his allusions, he could not but be charmed.
The fact was, as he reﬂected, that Cyril could do what no other
man might, and still charm. His very faults and weaknesses were,
in a manner, endearing.
He felt it, nevertheless, a great privilege, he continued, to be
placed there, and he asked of their patience to hear him, for‘the
sake of his ofﬁce. Then, referring to his manuscript, be brieﬂy
touched upon the story of the martyred innocents and its lessons;
and not till then did the profound snore of William Grove and
other accustomed sleepers arise. Every creature had kept awake
during the unaccustomed prologue, and, indeed, many of the habitual
sleepers were still awake, considering it only fair to Mr. Cyril.
Then the preacher spoke of the beauty of innocence, and his manner,
hitherto so quiet, changed, and became more and more impassioned,
till some of the sleepers woke and gazed about them with dazed
wonder, as the tones of that clarion voice besought them all to
keep innocency, that pearl beyond all price, that one costly treasure
without which there was no light in the summer sun, nor any joy
in youth and spring-time. Then he painted the tortures of a guilty
conscience, the agony beyond all agonies, with such power and pas-
sion, and such a richness of poetic diction and picturesque imagery, _
that many a man trembled, some women sobbed, and poor Ben Lee
uttered a stiﬂed groan.
Everard grew uncomfortable. He began to fear some unseemly
hysteric excitement in the little congregation, and was distressed to
ﬁnd Marion and Mrs. Maitland crying without reserve. ‘ Lilian’s
eyes were moist, but she did not cry; she was pale with a reﬂection


## p. 79 (#85) ##############################################

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAJTLAND. 79
of Cyril’s white passion. Mr. Maitland covered his face with his
surplice. He, too, was uneasy and more affected than he liked to
acknowledge to himself; yet he hoped that Alma’s betrayer might
be present and have his heart touched. The dusk was falling fast
in the dim, deep-shadowed building; two or three sparks of light
glowed among the white robes of the choir, and up among the dark
arches Cyril’s face showed haggard and agonized in the little isle of
light made by the two pale tapers on each side of him in the dark-
ness.
Long did the little congregation remember that scene: the hush
of attention, broken only by an occasional sob from some woman—
for most of the sleepers were awake now, and dimly conscious of
»the unaccustomed passion breaking the drowsy air around them—-
the great growing shadows in the fast-darkening church; the mass
of awe-struck faces pale in the gray gloom ; the rosy gleams of the
scattered tapers on the choristers’ surplices; and up above them,
from the heart of the mysterious darkness, the one beautiful, impas-
sioned face in the lonely radiance, and the mighty musical voice
peeling forth the unutterable anguish of sin; and the light which
subsequent events threw upon it only rendered it the more impress-
we.
“It is true, indeed,” said the preacher, suddenly easing the in-
tolerable tension of his passion, and speaking in calmer tones, “that
what a holy writer has called ‘ the princely heart of innocence,’ may
be regained after long anguish of penitence and prayer, but the con-
sequences of sin roll on in ever-growing echoes, terrible with the
thunder of everlasting doom: the contrite heart is utterly broken,
and the life for ever saddened and marred. Innocence once lost,
my brethren, the old careless joy of youth never returns. 0 thou,
whosoever thou be, man, woman, or even child; thou who hast
once stained thy soul with deadly sin, ‘not poppy, nor maudragora,
nor all the drowsy sirups of the world, shall ever medicine thee to
that sweet sleep which thou ow’dst yesterday.’
“Yet despair not, beloved brethren,” he added, with ﬂute-like
softness, for his voice had again risen in agonized intensity ; “there
is forgiveness and healing for all. But oh] keep innocency, keep
innocency; guard and treasure that inestimahle, irrecoverable pos-
session, that pure perennial source of joyous days and peaceful
nights, and take heed, take watchful heed, of the thing that is right.
Keep innocency, 0 little children, sitting here in the holy church

this evening, beneath the eyes of those who love and guard you—
you whose souls are yet fresh with the dew of baptism, keep, oh,
keep your innocencyl Keep it, youths and children, who wear the
.chorister’s white robe! Keep innocency, young men and maidens,
full of heart and hope: keep this one pearl, I pray you, for there is
no joy without it! And you, men and women of mature years,
strong to labor and bowed with cares and toils innumerable—you
who, in the hurry of life’s hot noon, have scarce time to think of
heaven, with its white robes and peace, yet see that you keep inno-
cency through all ! And you, standing amid the long golden lights
of life’s evening, aged men and women who wear the honored crown
of white hairs, watch still, and see that you guard your priceless
treasure even to the last. Keep innocency, I conjure you, for that
shall bring a man peace at the last! Peace, peace,” be repeated,
with a yearning intensity that culminated in a deep, hard sob,
“ peacel ”
He paused, and there was a dense silence for some seconds, and
Everard saw that the blue brilliance of his eyes was blurred with
tears; while Sir Lionel and Ingram experienced a sense of profound
relief in the hope that the too exciting sermon was at an end. The
congregation rose joyously to their feet, eased of a strain that was
becoming intolerable.
When Cyril had left the pulpit, his father pronounced the bene-
diction on the kneeling crowd in his calm, sweet tones, so restful
after the storm and passion of the young preacher’s richly com-
passed voice. But the blessing did not reach Cyril’s distracted soul.
Taking advantage of the shadows when he reached his place in the
chancel, he glided swiftly behind the pillars, like some hurt spirit
ﬂeeing from the benison that would heal it, till he reached the
vestry, where he threw himself in a chair behind a creen and cov-
ered his face. When Mr. Maitland in due time followed the choir
thither, he did not at ﬁrst observe the silent, ghostly ﬁgure in the
shadow; and then becoming aware of him, he left him to himself
till the choristers were gone, thinking that he was praying. But
on approaching nearer, he was startled to hear strong sebs issue
from the veiled ﬁgure.
“My dear boy,” he remonstrated, “this will never do. Too
much excitement is nnwholesome both for priest and people. Come,
master yourself, dear lad. You are unwell; this fasting is not wise.
Henry was right.”


## p. 81 (#87) ##############################################

“Oh, father,” sobbed Cyril, “it is not the fasting! Oh, shut
the door, and let us be alone, and let me tell you all—all! ”
“Come, come,” said the gentle old man; “calm yourself, and
tell me whatever you like later. At present we are both worn out,
and need change of thought. You have a great gift, dear fellow,
and I trust your words have struck home to at least one con-
science—” -
“ They have—oh, they have, indeed! " repeated Cyril, with in-
creasing agitation; “and that miserable conscience— Oh, father,
father! how can I tell you—i ”
“ Hush! hush! This is hysteria, as Everard predicted. Say no
more; I insist upon your silence. Remember where we are!
Drink this water. Stay! I will call Henry”; and Mr. Maitland
went quickly into the church, where Everard was yet lingering
with Lilian, who always had various errands connected with the
parish to transact in the porch, and beckoned him to the vestry.
Cyril did not resist his father’s will any more, but sank back
with a moan, half of anguish, half of relief, and listened weekly to
the rough kindliness of Everard and the gentle remonstrances of his
father.
“ This is a pretty scene, Mr. Maitland,’l observed Everard, on
entering the vestry. “Ill? Of course he is ill, after exciting him-
self on an empty stomach! The end of such goings-0n as these, my
friend, is Bedlam. Take this brandy, and then go quietly home and
get a good sleep, and let us have no more of this nonsense, for good-
ness’ sake."
So Cyril did as they bid him, and held his peace. Had be but
acted on his heart’s impulse, and spoken out then as he wished, he
would have produced sorrow and dismay indeed, but the long. lin-
gering tragedy which was to involve so many lives would have
been for ever averted.
Once, perhaps, in each crisis of our lives, our guardian angel
stands before us with his hands full of golden opportunity, which.
if we grasp, it is well with us ; but woe to us if we turn our backs
sullenly on our gentle visitor, and scorn his celestial gift! Never
again is the gracious treasure offered, and the favorable moment re-
turns no more.

“ Ar, you med all mark my words! ” said Granfer, looking so]-
emnly around from under the shadow of his bushy gray eye-
brows. “I’ve a zaid it, and I’ll zay it agen—ay, that I ’00], let
they go agen it as may! You med all mark my words, I zay.
Queen Victdree‘ll make he a bishop avore she’s done wi’ ’un.”
“Ay,” chorused the listening group, who were standing around
the village oracle in the church-yard, looking phantom-like in the
pale blending of sunset and moonrise; and then there was a
thoughtful pause, during which Granfer’s shrewd gray eyes scruti-
nized each face with an air of challenge. .'
“Terble vine praiching zure-ly,” observed Hale, the wheel-
wright.
“ Vine! you med well zay that,” rejoined Granfer, sternly. “ I
tell ’ee all, there never was praiching that vine in all Malbourne
lands avorel Ay, I’ve a zaid it, and I’ll zay it agenl ”
“Made me sweat, ’ee did,” observed Straun, the blacksmith,
whose Sunday appearance was a caricature on his burly working-
day presentment; for broadcloth of Baine’s rough fashioning now
hid the magniﬁcent, muscular arms and bare neck; a tall hat, too
small in the head, replaced the careless, smoke-browned cap of
every day; and the washing and shaving to which his face had
been subjected gave it an almost unnatural pallor.
“Ye med well sweat, Jarge Straun, when you thinkson yer
zlns,” reﬂected Granfer, piously.
“’Twas terble vine; but darned if I knows what ’twas all
about! ” said William Grove, scratching his curly head with some
perplexity.
“Ahl Mr. Cyril, he have a dale too much larning for the likes
0’ you, Willum,” returned Granfer, graciously condescending to
William’s weaker intellect: “let he alone for that. Why, Lard love
’ee, Willum, I couldn’t make out more’n a quarter on’t mezelf ; that
I couldn’t, I tell ’eel A vast o’ larning in that lad‘s head.”
“ Ay, and some on it was poetry; I yerd the jingle of it,” said
sailor Jim.
“ Master, now,” continued Granfer, settling himself more com-
fortably against a tombstone, and leaning forward on his stick-—
“Lard ’a massey, any vool med understand be! He spakes in his

discoorses jest as though he was a zitting in front of vire atop of a
cricket, and a zaying, ‘ Well, Granfer, and how be the taaties a-com-
ing up? ’ or, ‘Granfer, think 0’ yer zins avore you blames other
volk,’ Ay, that’s how he spakes, bless ’un! He don’t know no
better, he don’t. Can’t spake no grander than the Lard have give
’un grace to.”
“Master’s a good man,” said Straun, deﬁantly. “ Ile’ve a done
his duty by we this thirty year."
“ Ay, he‘s well enough, master is,” continued Granfer, in a tol- I
erant manner; “I never had no vault to vind wi’ he, bless unl A ,
vine vamily he’ve had, tool He’ve a done so well as he could; but
a never was no praicher to spake on, I tell ’ee.”
“ Terble pretty what Mr. Cyril said about preaching to them as
knowed him a boy," said Tom Hale. “Them esskypades, now,” he
added fondly, as he caressed his mustache and struck one of his
martial attitudes.
“ What’s a esskypade, Granfer? ” inquired a smock-frock.
“A esskypade,” returned Granfer, slowly and thoughtfully—“ a
esskypade, 20 to zay, is, in a way 0' spaking, what you med call a
zet-to—a zart of a scrimmage like "; and he ﬁxed his glittering eye
ﬁercely, yet half doubtfully, on Tom Hale’s face, as much as to chal-
lenge him to deny it. '
“Just so," responded Tom. “ I said to meself, I said, ‘Mr.
Oyril is thinking of the set-to we had together in father’s yard that
Saturday afternoon ; that’s what he means by his esskypades.’ ”
“Ay, and you licked him well,” added Jim, eagerly; “ that was
summat like a ﬁght, Tom.”
“Master Cyril had to be carried home, and kep’ his bed for a
week; and Tom, he couldn’t see out of his eyes next day,” com-
mented the elder Hale, with pride in his brother’s prowess.
“ Ay, you dreshed ’un, zure enough, Tom,” commented Granfer,
graciously.
“He took a deal of licking, and hit out like a man,” said the
modest warrior, who loved Cyril with the profound aﬁ'ection in—
spired only by a vanquished foe.
Tom had fought sterner battles since. He had been through the
Indian Mutiny campaign, and known the grim realities of Lucknow ;
but his heart still glowed, as he saw before him, in his mind’s eye,
the prostrate form of Cyril on the grass among the timber of the
Wheelwright's yard—poor, vanquished Cyril, slighter, though older,

than himself, with his little shirt torn and blood-stained—and heard
the applause of his comrades gathered to watch the fray.
“ Well, I minds ’n, a little lad, chivying Granfer’s wuld sow
round meadow,” struck in Stevens, who had now completed all his
duties in the church and locked the door, the great key of which he
carried in his hand.
“A vine, peart buoy as ever I zee,” reflected Granfer, “and
wanted zo much stick as any on ’em. I’ve a smacked ’un mezelf,”
added Graufer, with great dignity and importance; “ay, and I
smacked ’un well, I did! ” repeated Granfer, with a relish.
“You was allays a good ’un to smack, Granfer,” observed his
grandson, the clerk, with tender reminiscences of Granfer‘s opera-
tion on his own person.
“Whatever I done, I went through wi‘ ’t,” returned the old
man, complacently digesting this tribute to his prowess. “ Ay, I’ve
a smacked ’un mezelf, and I smacked ’un well, I did,” be repeated,
with ever-growing importance.
“ Come along home 1 ” said Stevens, who was waiting to lock the
lych-gate. “ You bain’t old enough to hide in church-yard for good,
Granfer.”
“Ah! I bain’t a-gwine underground this ten year yet,” returned
Granfer, shaking his head, and slowly rising from his tombstone in
the blue moonlight, his breath showing smokelike on the keen air,
and his wrinkled hands numbed doubly by age and the winter night.
“I bain’t a-gwine yet,” he mattered to himself; while the group
broke up in slow, rustic fashion, and they all trudged off, Tom lead-
ing the way, erect and martial, airily swinging his little cane, and
stepping with a ﬁrm, even stride; Jim rolling along with a wide,
swaying gait, as if there were an earthquake, and the church-yard
ground were heaving and surging around him; the rustics tramp~
ing heavily after, with a stolid, forceful step, as if the ground he-
neath them were a stubborn enemy, to be mastered only by con-
tinued blows; and soon the gray church stood silent and deserted
in the frosty moonlight, till the clock in the belfry pealed out ﬁve
mellow strokes above the quiet, unheeding dead.
At that hour Ben Lee was on the point of leaving his stables and
going home to tea. Judkins and he were kindling their pipes a
the harness-room ﬁre, each with a face of sullen gloom. -
“ It wasn’t so much what he said,” observed Judkins; “’twas '
how he said it made them all cry. He seemed kind of heart-broken

about it, as though somebody belonging to him, some friend like,
had done wrong.”
“ Do you think he was thinking of my poor girl?” asked Ben,
quickly; and J udkins nodded assent. ‘
“He' always had a kind heart, had Mr. Cyril, and he thought
a deal of Alma,” continued Lee; “lent her good books and
that.”
‘ “There was one in the church as wasn’t upset, and looked as
Quiet as a Whetstone all through—that damned doctor! ” said the
young man, ﬁercely. '
“ Dr. Everard? You don’t think, Charles—i ”
“ Haven’t I seen him walking in the wood with her? ” be inter-
rupted, with imprecations. “ Why did he come sneaking into your
house, doctoring your wife last spring, day after day without fail,
and always somethink to say to Alma afterward in another room?
Answer me that, Ben Leel ”
The man was half stunned. “ I'd break every bone in his cursed
body,” he burst out, purple with passion, “if I thought that! And
the good he done my wife, too, and I that blind! ”
“Blind you were, Ben Lee, and blind was everybody else. But
I watched. I’ve seen them shake hands at the gate, and she giving
of him ﬂowers, damn him! I’ve seen them in the wood there,
standing together, and he shomng of her things through that glass
of his that makes things bigger than they ought to be. Wait till I
catch him, Ben, that’s all! And be sitting through that sermon,
and everybody crying, and even Mr. Ingram blowing his nose; he
sitting as scornful and cold as any devil. There’s no conscience in
the likes of him! ”
“ Charles,” cried Ben, suddenly clutching the young man’s arm
with a grip that brought the blood to his face, “I’ll kill him! ”
Ben was purple, and quivering from head to foot, and J udkins’s
passionate anger sank within him at the sight.
“Hush, Ben, hush ” he said ; “ don’t you do nothing rash. Kill-
ing‘s murder, Ben. And that will do her no good. No, no; I’ll '
thrash him, and you shall thrash him, and he shall be brought to
book, sure enough ; that‘s only justice.”
Poor Ben dashed away his pipe, covered his face with his coat-
cuﬂ", and broke out crying.
‘ "Lord ha’ mercyl ” cried the young groom, crying himself.
“You do take on, Ben. Come, come, cheer up, man. Better days’ll

come, and you may see her married and happy yet. Come on home,
Ben, come.” -
And he drew him out into the solemn quiet of the winter moon-
light, and took him across the park and the meadow, and wished
him good night at the door of his sorrowful home. “And mind
you, Ben, don‘t you be hard on her," he said at parting.
“If Ben comes across him,” he muttered to himself, as he
strolled moodily up and down the high-road, whence he could see
the Temple white in the moonlight, with its one window faintly
aglow, “ he’ll do for him. Ben‘s hot, and he’ll do for him, as sure
as eggs is eggs.” Then he vowed to himself that he would wreak
his own revenge ﬁrst, and, if possible, save Ben from yielding to
his own passionate nature. “I’ll track him down like a hound! ”
he muttered, striking ﬁercely at the frosted hedgerow with thelight
whip he carried.
Everard, in the mean time, was serenely happy in the drawing-
room at Malbourne, unconscious that he had an enemy in the world,
much less that men were scheming against his honor and his life.
Nay, he did not even dream that he had so much as a detractor; he
loved his fellows, and was at peace with mankind.
The family were gathered in the drawing-room in pleasant Sun-
day idleness, save Mrrltlaitland, who was visiting a sick parishioner. /
Cyril and Marion were side by side on a remote sofa, dreamily
happy in each other‘s presence; Henry had mounted his microscope 7
within reach of Mrs. Maitland, and was displaying its wonders in
calm happiness for her and Lilian. Mark Antony, after careful and
minute inspection of every detail of the strange apparatus, had de-
cided that it was harmless, though frivolous, and expressed this
decision by deep contented pnrrs, and an adjournment to Cyril’s
knee, where he saw a prospect of long continuation and peace; and
Lennie and Winnie occupied the hearth-rug, and divided their atten-
tion between the dogs and the microscope.
When Lilian bent over the tube, with the strong light of the
lamp touching her animated face, and her dress rustling against
him. Henry thought he had never been so happy in his life. Now
and again some little unexpected incident, some glance or tone,
revealed to him the delicious truth that they loved each other. N 0
one else suspected that any change had come over the fraternal
relations of a lifetime; they possessed this young happiness us a
secret, sacred treasure, and feared the moment when it must be

\
revealed to the world. Everard was loath to part even with the
sweet anguish of doubt which crossed his heaven from time to time;
it was so delightful to watch and question every word and glance
and gesture of Lilian’s, and play upon them a perpetual daisy game
—-“ She loves me, she loves me not, she loves me.” Some deep
instinct told him that never in all his life would he again taste such
happiness as thin blessed dawn of love yielded him. As for Lilian,
her manner took a. little shyness occasionally in the strange fear
which is the shadow of unspeakable joy.
Soon the domestic quiet was broken, but not troubled, by the
irruption of Stanley and Lyster Garrett, the two sons of Northover,
who liked to lounge away a Sunday evening at the Rectory, and
there was much discussion of the entertainment to be given the next
night to‘the villagers; and then the girl Garretts were brought
across the park to assist in the little parliament, and kept to share
the informal supper which was a Sunday feature at Melbourne.
During supper a note arrived from Swaynestone, bidding Ever-
ard come to luncheon next day to meet the great Professor Hamlyn,
who had seen some paper of Everard’s in a scientiﬁc journal, and
expressed a wish to see the writer. This was a great pleasure to
Everard, and a. little responsive light in Lilian’s face told him that
she realized what making this man’s acquaintance meant to him.
“ The luncheon was a. great success,” Everard observed, on his
return to the Rectory in the afternoon of the next day. “The
great man was most gracious; he did me the honor of contradicting
me nine times. Sir Lionel, in his gentle way, was a little horriﬁed
at his lion’s roar, but saw that I was specially honored in being
selected for the royal beast’s refection.”
He went on to tell how the great writer, who lived in the neigh-
borhood, and was entertaining the professor, had been present, and
had been less overbearing in manner and milder in language than
usual. His hair had, however, evidently not been brushed. He
was questioning Sir Lionel about Cyril’s sermon, in which he was
interested, since he had a. slight acquaintance with the Maitlands,
and had already detected Cyril’s bright parts. He heard of the
sermon through his brother, who had been taking a country stroll
the previous afternoon, and had sauntered unnoticed into the church,
just at the beginning of the sermon, and returned home with the in-
telligence that a young genius had arisen in the neighborhood, with
a voice, manner, and power unequaled in his experience.

v
Ingram Swaynestone, who had accompanied Everard back to
Melbourne, wondered that Cyril should stare abstractedly at the ﬁre
during this recital, as if it had no interest for him, and made some
remark to him expressive of his own personal appreciation of the
sermon.
“ My good fellow,” returned Cyril, facing about, and speaking
in his easy, genial fashion, “do you suppose that I don’t know that
I have the ‘gift of the gab,’ as Everard calls it? I don’t know that
one need be proud of it, any more than of having one’s nose placed
in the middle of one’s face, instead of all askew, as befalls some
people; and yet the devil is quite active enough in persuading me
to be vain of it without my friend’s assistance.”
“It strikes me Cyril,” broke in Everard, “that you and the
devil are on very conﬁdential terms. I should have thought an
innocent young person like you the very last person the arch—
enemy would select to hob and nob with.” _
“ As if the premier were to hold conﬁdential chats with the late
Nana Sahib,” added Ingram, laughing. \
Cyril ﬂushed hotly, and then said, with a quietly digniﬁed air,
of which he was master when he wished to rebuke gently, “You
are light-hearted, Henry; your spirits run away with you.”
Upon which Everard could not resist retorting, with unabashed
gravity, “I trust that yours will not run away with you, Cyril,
since they are of such a questionable complexion.”
“Come, you idle people,” broke in Lilian; “it is time to go to
the school-room. Are you going to be a waiter, Ingram? There is
no compulsion, remember. Henry and the two Garretts are enlisted.
Keppel Everard is our Ganymede; Marion and I are Hebes. In
plain English, we serve the tea, and Keppel the beer.”
“Since all the posts are ﬁlled, I will engage myselfas general
slavey,” said the good-tempered Ingram, rising and following Lilian
to the schoolrooms, where a substantial meal was spread, and Mr.
Maitland, with his curate, Mr. Marvyn, was already receiving his
humble guests, who, unlike the guests of more fashionable enter-
tainments, liked to arrive before instead of after the appointed hour,
and in this case came long before all the candles were lighted, so
that they depended chieﬂy on ﬁrelight for illumination.
Soon, however, the tables were full, men, women, and children
sitting before a bounteous supply of roast beef and potatoes, while
the air became oppressive with the scent of crushed evergreens and

steaming food. Mr. Maitland and his curate had one table; Cyril
and the Rev. George Everard presided at another; and the children’s
special board rejoiced in Lennie and Winnie as host and hostess.
Profound gravity prevailed, broken only by an occasional femi-
nine titter or childish laugh, though it was evident, from the expres-
sion of Granfer’s face when he came to the end of his ﬁrst plate of
beef, that he contemplated making a remark, probably of a jocular
nature. All the mirth of the feast seemed to be concentrated in
the faces of the llebes and Ganymedes, who ﬂew about the room
with the greatest enjoyment, and took care that neither plate nor
cup was empty. The two most assiduous waiters were Ingram
Swaynestone and Everard, both of whom appeared to have the gift
of ubiquity, and carved with a recklessness and rapidity that aston-
ished all beholders. It was not until the pudding was ﬁnished, and
grace had been sung by the choir, that some symptoms of mirth
and enjoyment began to break out among the rustic revelers, and
Mr. Maitland laughed with his usual heartiness at Granfer’s an-
nual joke, a ﬁne antique one, with tho mellowness of ﬁfty years
upon it.
It was pleasant, while the tables were being cleared, and the
people were grouped about the room. to see Cyril move among his
old friends, saying to each exactly the right thing, in the manner
exactly ﬁtted to charm each; going up to Tom Hale, and laying his
hand aﬁ‘ectionately on his stalwart, red-coated shoulder, and calling
the pleased ﬂush into his face by the manner in which he alluded to
old times, especially the immortal battle.
“ I should be sorry to ﬁght you now, Torn,” he added ; “ or Jim
either. It is well that my calling makes me a man of peace, while
yours make you men of war.”
“Yes, Mr. Cyril, it is all very well to be strong," replied Tom;
“ but what’s that to a head-piece like yours? ”
“ They would rather have a smile from Cyril than a whole din-
ner from the rest of us,” Everard observed to Lilian, as he paused a
moment in his toilsome occupation of re-arranging the room. “Just
look at George,” he added, pointing to his reverend brother, who
was standing disconsolate and dejected in the quietest corner he
could ﬁnd; “he is afraid that people are enjoying themselves. He
would give his head to be allowed to improve the occasion.”
“He implored/ my father to substitute hymns and clerical ad-
dresses for our frivolous little entertainment,” replied Lilian. “He

asked him how he would answer for having let slip such a precious
opportunity of preaching the Gospel."
“ Such a gospel—
“ ‘ The dismal news I tell,
How our friends are all embarking
For the ﬁery port of hell.’
Poor old George! What a dreary phautasmagoria life must seem
to him! ”
“Happily, he doesn’t really believe his creed. He asked Granfer
just now if he knew that he was standing on the brink of the grave.
Granfer replied, ‘Ay, I’ve ben a-standing there this ninety year and
more, and l bain’t, 20 to my, tired on’t yet.’ ”
Everard went up to his brother, and accosted him. “I hope
there is nothing wrong, George,” he said; “you look as if some-
thing had disagreed with you.”
“Thank you, Henry,” he replied, “my health is, under Provi-
dence, excellent; but I grieve for the souls of these poor creatures.
I have ascertained for a fact that Maitland has caused beer and
tobacco to be placed in a class-room for the men. Why, oh, why
will he not lead them to the only true source of comfort? "
The diners were now joined by other; guests of a higher grade:
Farmer Long and his family; other farmers; a fresh contingent of
Garretts; and last, though not by any means least, Sir Lionel
Swaynestone and his two pretty daughters.
Thereupon the choir, assisted by amateurs, struck up, “My love‘s
like a red, red rose,” and the concert began. Wax executed a solo
on the clarionet, of such fearful difﬁculty that Everard trembled
lest he should break a blood-vessel; and everybody, including Mrs.
Wax, who coursed frantically after his rapid runs and ﬂourishes on
the piano, breathed an inward thanksgiving when he had ﬁnished.
A piano duet between Miss Swaynestone and Miss Garrett followed,
and was not the less tumultuoust applauded because the superior
swiftness of Miss Garrett’s ﬁngers landed her at the ﬁnish two bars
ahead of Miss Swaynestone, who played on to the end with un-
l'uﬁled composure. Nobody had taken the slightest notice of any
Of these performances, save Wax’s, which alarmed the nervous; but
now a change took place. Cyril led Lilian on to the platform, and
Marion’s piano prelude was drowned by the sound of heavy feet
plunging in from the smoking-room, and everybody listened atten-

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 91
tively for what was a really delicate entertainment for the ear—a
vocal duet between the twins. Even Sir Lionel left his stately calm
to encore the simple melody, while Granfer did serious damage to
the school ﬂoor with his stick. It was not that the brother and
sister sang with unusual skill, or that their voices were remarkably
good, taken apart; the charm lay in the peculiar sweetness of tone
resulting from the exact blending of the two.
Ingram Swaynestoue grumbled in a good-tempered way at hav-
ing to read after this performance, and though he read a bit of
Dickens with great spirit and humor, Everard observed that the
audience only listened and applauded as a matter of duty. Ethel
Swaynestone was an accomplished singer, but her voice failed to
please the rustic ear; while the choir glees and other amateur
music were received as a matter of conrse. But when Cyril once
more stood on the platform, and began in his rich, pure voice,
“ There was a sound of revelry by night," Everard was startled at
the sudden hush of attention that fell on the audience, and sur-
prised at the richness of harmony in the well-known stanzas.
When Cyril repeated the line, “But hush! hark! a deep sound
strikes like a rising knell! ” the rustics started and looked over their
shoulders in dismay, and one susceptible matron uttered a faint
shriek. “Did ye not hear it? ” continued the reciter, in such thrill-
ing tones that Mrs. Stevens, meeting the light of Cyril’s blue eyes,
took the question personally, and replied wildly in the negative, to
the general consternation. Having brought this to a conclusion in
such a manner that his unlettered audience actually saw, the ball-
room scene, “the cheeks all pale,” the “ tremblings of distress.” and
actually heard the sounds of approaching doom break in upon the
brilliant revelry, and witnessed the hurried departure of the troops
to the terrible ﬁeld destined to be fertilized with “red rain," Cyril
paused to let the tumultuous encores subside; and, at last, when
silence ensued, began with a plaintive sweetness, that was in strong
contrast to the dramatic force and ﬁre of the “Eve of Waterloo ”~
“ ‘I remember, I remember,
The house where I was born,
The little window where the sun
Came peeping in at morn.
He never came a wink too soon,
Or brought too long a day;
But now—' " I

92 THE'SILENOE 0F DEAN MAITLAND.
Here Cyril paused, with a deep sigh.
“ ‘ I often wish the night
Had borne my breath away.’ ”
To Everard’s intense surprise, he not only saw tears all round
him, but found a sensation of intense sorrow and longing for the
past stealing over himself, while the pathos of Cyril's voice seemed
to break his heart. He saw, as they all saw, Malbourne Rectory,
and Cyril, a boy once more—gentle, happy, and full of sweet, in-
nocent fancies; and when the latter went on, in his quiet voice, so
full of melodious heart-break— -
“ ‘ And where my brother set
The lnburnum on his birthday:
That tree is living yet,’ "
something rushed up into Everard’s throat and half choked him.
He knew that Cyril was thinking of a rose-tree he had planted on
a far-off birthday.
“ ‘ But now ’tis little joy,’ ”
said Cyril, with a voice full of tears—
“ ‘To know I'm farther oﬂ’ from heaven
Than when I was a boy.’ ”
There was no applause to this; complete and tearful silence
reigned when he ﬁnished and stepped quietly down among his
friends, where Sir Lionel gently rebuked him for playing so cruelly
on their feelings, and added, “ As I said to Ingram yesterday, such
a voice and manner would sway the House”; and every one was
relieved when the choir struck up, “All among the Barley.”
Lilian was among the few who did not give way to tears during
the recital of Hood’s pathetic little poem, though Everard, who
hovered near her all the evening, observed that her large, soft gray
eyes were dewy wet, as was their wont when she was moved, and
her face reﬂected all the changes on her brother’s. It was not easy
to get very close to Lilian, because she was fenced in, as it were, by
ailittle ring of children, who clung to her skirts, and laid their
cheeks against her beautiful, slender hands, and were perfectly
happy with the privilege of touching her.
“I do not think,” she said, while returning to the Rectory
through the frosty moonlight with Everard, “that Cyril is farther

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 93
off from heaven than when he was a boy. Indeed, it seems to me
that one must grow nearer to it with every day of life, unless one
deliberately turns from it.”
“ You are speaking from your own experience,” replied Henry.
“ Men are different. To go through early manhood is to be drawn
over a morass of temptation, into which, with the best intentions,
most men sink occasionally." .
“ Not men like Cyril, Henry. He is so slightly weighted with
ﬂesh that he would skim dry-footed over the most quaking quag-
mire. I know every thought in Cyril‘s heart.”
Everard was half inclined to indorse this opinion of Cyril. He
recognized in his friend’s character a certain feminine element, that
wig weibliche which Goethe pronounces the saving ingredient in
human nature. The protecting tenderness with which he loved
the bright, gentle boy, two years his junior and less robust than
himself, still lived in his deep affection for the pious and intellectual
young priest. Cyril’s feelings were sacred to him as a woman’s;
he feared to sully their delicate bloom by harsh allusions to the
bare facts of life. He was one of the twins, both of whom were
objects of his life-long tenderness. And Cyril had his moods, like a
woman—a peculiarity not without fascination for Everard’s more
thoroughly masculine mind.
A soft mood was on Cyril that night. He knocked at Everard’s
door after every one had retired for the night, and drew a chair to
his side by the ﬁre, before which the doctor was smoking, and,
investing himself in one of Everard’s coats, lighted a pipe of his
own.
“ The coolness with which the fellow takes my coats! ” growled
Everard.
“It is no matter if your coats smell of tobacco,” replied Cyril,
tranquilly; “I smoke so seldom that I have no smoking-coats. To-
night I am restless.”
“ Why so pale and wan, fond lover l ” laughed Everard. “Be-
cause Marion is gone back to Woodlands for two days, I suppose.”
“You may laugh, Henry, but I feel more than lost without her.
I am helpless, separated from the best inﬂuence of my life.”
“ You are a slave to your feelings ; learn to master them.”
“It is true," replied Cyril. “ You are the best and wisest friend
ever man had. I never regretted doing anything you advised. I
shall always be grateful to you for making me read up for mathe-

mat-ical honors. I needed that discipline to steady me. I have
never valued you as you deserve; only now and again it ﬂashes
upon me that what I take for granted is of superior ivorth. How
selﬁsh I was about letting Marion join you in the Mediterranean!
You little dream how I suffered for that. Well, without you,
Marion and I would have been parted for ever.”
“ Without Lilian.”
“You and Lilian together. How selﬁsh and weak I was! and
the harm that came from it! ”
“ Oh, come! It’s all right now; a forgotten story.”
“There are things that can never be forgotten,” sighed Cyril,
with the pathetic intonation that had broken people’s hearts in the
evening. “ To give way to a sin, only one sin, is like letting a little
water through a dike. A child may begin it, but, once begun, the,
terrible consequences sweep endlessly on, a very ﬂood of iniquity.
I suppose there is nothing which has the power of multiplying itself
like sin. One hideous consequence begets a hundred more hideous,”
continued Cyril, staring moodily at the ﬁre, while his pipe lay ex-
tinct and neglected by his side.
“I see no pulpit, your reverence,” said Everard, who was put?-
ing away with quiet enjoyment.
Cyril turned with one of his sudden changes, and ﬂashed a
mirthful glance of his strange blue eyes on his friend, and, replen-
ishing his pipe from the tobacco which Keppel had brought for
Everard on his return from his last voyage, broke into a strain of
gay aﬁectionate chat, full of a thousand reminiscences of the school-
days they passed together under Mr. Marvyn’s care in the quiet
village.
“What a fellow you were! ” exclaimed Cyril, with enthusiasm,
after recalling a certain story of a Sévres vase; and, though Ever-
ard only, granted, he looked at the graceful, animated ﬁgure before
him with an affectionate adoration that made him feel it would be a
pleasure to die for such a man. “ I was afraid when I smashed the
vase,” continued Cyril, “and but for you should have hidden it. I
never shall forget seeing you walk up to Lady Swaynestone and tell
her that we had run up against the vase and broken it. I felt such
a sneak; I had done it, and you took the blame on yourself, and got
the punishment. She said no word, but delivered you such a box
on the ear as made mine tingle, and sent you staggering across the
room. Then her anger found words, and you bore it all.”


## p. 95 (#101) #############################################

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 95
“I never knew a ruder or more ill-bred woman,” said Everard.
“ I suppose you got over the box on the ear in an hour or two,"
continued Oyril; “ but I did not. I was miserable for days, hating
myself, and yet too frightened to tell the truth.”
Everard here produced a yawn of cavernous intensity, and
dropped his pipe in sheer drowsiness; but Maitland seemed more
alert than ever, and rose in his restlessness and looked out of the,
window on the dark vault of shimmering stars.
“The night wanes,” he said; “one day more, and the weary
old year will be done—only one day.”
“Ungrateful fellow!” said Everard, stretching himself till he
seemed gigantic; "such a good old year. I shall be sorry to say
good-by to him, for my part.”
Cyril dropped the curtain and turned to the ﬁre, his features all
alight. “ Let us look forward,” he said, “ to the rosy future. Wel-
come to sixty-three, Harry ; it is full of promise for us both l \ Good
night, dear lad, and God bless you! ” \
And with a warm hand-clasp he took his leave, but turne
again, lingering, irresolute; and then, with another warm hand-
clasp and blessing, left his drowsy friend to his slumbers, just as the
church clock was striking three.
CHAPTER IX.
Tun last day of the year dawned bright and clondless, a very
prince and pearl of winter days, and Everard’s heart bounded with-
in him as he looked out on the ruddy morning, and felt it a joy
merely to live.
“I shall long remember sixty-two,” he thought; “it has been a
good year, and to-day will crown and complete the whole. To-day
I will make sure of my fate.”
The wine of life never before had the sparkle and eﬁervescenoe
of that morning; it was almost too much for a sober mind. Had
Everard been superstitious, or even introspective, he would have
presaged disaster at hand. Instead of which, he rejoiced in his
youth, and felt as if his body were turned to air, as he sprang down
the staircase and into the sunny breakfast-room.


## p. 96 (#102) #############################################

96 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MA ITLAND.
Mr. Maitland was late that morning, and Cyril read the simple
household prayers. Everard loved this sweet custom of family
prayer, remiss as he often was in assisting personally at it; it seemed
so ﬁt and harmonious for that holy incense to ascend from the altar
of the innocent country home, and to-day it acquired a sort of pathos
from the youth and grace of the reader. The scene lived long in
his mind, irradiated by a sweet light of peace and holiness: the
kneeling children and Lilian, the sunshine touching their hair; the
bowed heads of the maids; the digniﬁed bearing of the reader; the
music of his voice—a voice soft now, and soothing as the murmur of
the brook beneath the trees, with none of the tragic tones they knew
so well. Just as Cyril was about to pronounce the closing benedic-
tion, Mr. Maitland, thinking the prayers done, entered, and seeing
how they were employed, dropped on his knees in time to receive
the lad’s blessing. The sight of that gray head, bent thus before
the young priest‘s benison, touched Everard profoundly, and he
felt humbled to think of his own world-stained soul by the side of
these spotless creatures—priests and women and children.
“Lead us not into temptation,” said Cyril‘s pure rich voice,
chorused by the innocent trebles and Everard’s own faltering
bass.
What temptation could possibly befall those guileless beings that
day? What harsh dissonance could ever ,mar the music of those
tuneful lives? he wondered. And he was glad that his own faltering
petition had gone up to Heaven with those of hearts so pure, though
even he could scarcely fall into temptation in that sweet spot, he
thought.
Cyril announced his intention of walking into Oldport that
bright morning, and Lilian, of course, was to go part of the way
with him. Everard had been asked to shoot over some of the
Swaynestone covers, and rather surprised Cyril, who knew that his
friend liked sport, by saying that he had declined the shooting party,
and wanted to join the pedestrians.
“ You had far better shoot, Henry,” he said ; “ a mere walk is
a stupid thing for you. You have had no amusement whatever
since you have been here." -
“ To-morrow we plunge into a vortex of dissipation,” said
Everard. “ Will you give mo the ﬁrst dance, Lilian? By the way,
I suppose his reverence has given up these frivolities.”
“Oh, I shall dance at Woodlands to-morrow,” replied Cyril.‘


## p. 97 (#103) #############################################

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 97
“Just two square dances with Marion, and then, I suppose, fare-
well to such delights."
“ I can not say that I like to see a clergyman dancing,” observed
his father, “though I danced myself till I was forty, and should
enjoy a turn with the young people even now."
“Then, let us have a quiet carpet-dance while the boys are here,"
said Lilian; “just the Swaynestones and Garretts and Marion, and
father shall dance with each of us in turn.”-
“ Oh yesl ” cried Everard; and Cyril chimed in with great ani-
mation, “Just one more ﬂing for me”; and Mr. Maitland went off
laughing and saying he had nothing to do with it—they must ask
their mother, and Lennie and Winnie jumped for joy, and announced
that they should not go to bed before their elders, and the little
féte was regarded as a pleasant certainty.
Cyril kept them waiting some minutes after the appointed time
for starting. He had important letters to write, he said; and when
at last he appeared, his face was full of care and perplexity. In the
mean time, Lilian and Everard were very happy on the sunny lawn
together, visiting tha invalid donkey and other animals, and wan-
dering about their old playground, past the spot where the twins
used to play at Robinson Crusoe, and where Everard helped them
build a. hut, and recalling a thousand pleasant memories of their
childish labors and sports. There was hear-frost on the delicate
branches of the leaﬂess trees, and the sunshine was broken into a
thousand jewel-like rudiances by the little sharp facets of the ice-
crystals. There was an unwonted sparkle also in Lilian’s eyes,
and a deeper glow on her cheeks than usual. The air was like
wine.
The blacksmith was clinking merrily at his glowing forge as they
passed along the road, and his blithe music carried far in the still
air. Granfer was sunning himself outside, according to custom,
ready for a chat with anybody, and commanding from his position
a view of all the approaches to the village. Hale, the wheelwright,
was there, getting some ironwork done, and turned with Granfer
to look after the trio.
“Ay,” observed the latter, shaking his head wisely, “a viner
pair than they twins 0’ earn you never see, John Hale, so well
matched they be as Sir Lionel’s bays."
“A pretty pair,” replied the wheelwright; “but give me the
doctor. There’s muscle and build! "
7


## p. 98 (#104) #############################################

98 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND.
“ Ay," echoed Straun, between the rhythmic hammersstrokes;
“ a man like he’s a credit to his vittles.”
The young doctor‘s appearance certainly justiﬁed this observa-
tion, and his walk and bearing fully set off the robust manliness of
his athletic frame, which was further enhanced by contrast with
Cyril’s slender grace. The friends were of similar height, but
Henry’s shoulders were higher, and made him look taller; his chest
and back were far broader than Cyril’s, and his well-balanced limbs
were hard with muscle. The suit of gray which he wore gave him
breadth, and displayed his form more fully than did Cyril’s black
broadcloth of severe clerical cut, which had, moreover, the well-
known effect of lessening the outlines of the ﬁgure. The delicate
glow which the sparkling air had called into Cyril’s worn cheek
was very different from the ﬁrm hue of health in Henry’s honest
face; and the fearless, frank gaze of his bright brown eyes, and the
light brown mustache, looking golden in the sunshine, gave him
an older look than Cyril’s clean-shaven features were.
Hale observed to Granfer that whoever attacked the doctor on
a dark night would ﬁnd him an ugly customer, which Granfer ad-
mitted, adding that Cyril’s strength all went to brain power, in
which he was supreme. Lilian also observed Henry’s athletic ap-
pearance in contrast with her brother’s slight build, and then she
remembered how the friends but the day before had been playing
with the children in the hall, and the fragile-looking Cyril had
given his muscular friend a blow so clean and straight and well
planted that the doctor had gone down like a ninepin before it, to
the great amusement of the children and satisfaction of Everard.
Farmer Long was driving into Oldport in his gig, and there
beside him sat Mr. Marvyn, charmed to see his three pupils together.
“ I shall not see you again, Henry,” he said regretfully, “unless you
stay over Sunday. I only came back for the entertainment yester-
day. I have a parson’s week to ﬁnish. Cyril I shall see again.”
And so they parted with regret, since Everard was greatly attached
to his old tutor, who had encouraged and developed his taste for
natural science, and upheld him in his choice of a profession.
“And I wanted to tell old Marvyn about my germ theory,”
Everard said, as the gig disappeared. '
“You will be able to tell the whole world soon,” replied Lilian,
to whom the theory had been conﬁded and explained that very
morning.

“ Not yet,” said Everard; “it takes years of patient study and
experiment to verify a scientiﬁc theory.”
“Old Hal always was a patient fellow,” Cyril observed. “Do
you remember the rows about his dissections in his bedroom, Lill'l ”
Lilian replied that she remembered the odors, and they all
laughed over the old school-room jokes and catastrophes, and were
very happy as they climbed the hillside by a ﬁeld-path, leaving the
road below them. Afterward Everard remembered the rare and
affectionate expression, “Old Hal." And now in the bright sun-
shine he was pleased to see Cyril so like his old self, careless, cordial,
and light-hearted, all the asceticism and sadness put away; ambi-
tion, toil, and care completely forgotten. He knew that Cyril loved
Marion truly, and would be happy with her. and yet it struck him
that morning that his strong half-instinctive affection for his twin
sister touched a yet deeper chord in his nature. N ow that Marion
was away, there was a greater ease about the twins; each seemed
to develop the other’s thoughts in some mysterious manner. They
laughed to each other, and walked hand-in-hand like children, see-
ing everything through each other‘s eyes-the still, sunny winter
ﬁelds and brown woods stretching away to the sea, the ﬂocks of
weird white sea-gulls, the occasional rabbit or pheasant starting up
before them, the lurks, silent now, ﬂuttering over the grassy furrows,
the bright berries in copse and hedgerow, the sheep peacefully
munching the mangolds a solitary shepherd was cutting for them
in a lonely ﬁeld. They called each other Oyll and Lill, abbreviations
none else ever used; they contradicted each other as they never
dreamed of contradicting anybody else.
Everard walked along, sometimes by their side, sometimes behind
them, as the nature of the path obliged, and listened to them and
loved them. The twins were never so delicious to him as when
together in his familiar presence, of which they seemed to make no
account. So long as those two could meet together thus, an immor-
tal childhood would be theirs, he thought; age could never rob the
beautiful bond between them of its bloom. Presently they quarreled.
Lilian sat on a felled tree in the woods through which they were
passing; Oyril leant up against a tree; and Everard looked on with
amusement, and loved them all the more in their childishness.
“Oh, you babes in the wood! ” he cried at last; whereupon
Cyril ﬂashed upon him one of his droll glances, and laughed.
“Come, Lill,“ he said, “I forgive you this time.”


## p. 100 (#106) ############################################

100 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN JIAI T LAND.
Absolute harmony and utter unconsciousness of past anger was
established between them on the instant, and Everard was amused
to hear them plunge straightway into a grave discussion upon the
limits of free will.
They were now high on the crest of the hill, and could see the
lovely stretches of down sweeping away to the unseen sea on one
side, while on the other the Swaynestone lands sloped down with
wood and park and farmstead till they merged in the horizon, which
was broken here and there by tiny blue bays of inland sea on the
north.
There was no sound; all the song-birds, even the robin, were
hushed by the frost, and the whole landscape lay silent before them,
folded in the awful purity of winter sunshine. The shadows in the
hills and woods were blue, and distant objects looked immensely
far in the violet haze of the winter morning. Here they paused,
deep in their argument, and looked down over the tranquil woods
and saw the white front of Swaynestone House gleaming in the
sun.
Down in a low-lying fallow ﬁeld there were some black specks
motionless in the furrows; suddenly they rose in a black cloud of
wings, and there were a hundred silver ﬂashes against the belt -of
coppice bordering the field. Higher still the cloud rose, and swift
gleams of black and silver ﬂashed in rhythmic sequence against the
pure blue of the sky, and the weird wail of the plover was heard
faintly, as the ﬂock ﬂoated in a dazzle of white bodies and black
wings over the coppice till they reached another ﬁeld, into the
furrows of which they dropped motionless. While Everard and
Lilian were watching the plovers, they did not observe that Cyril
plunged into the wood behind them and put his hand into the hol-
low of a tree.
“I was looking for a squirrel’s nest,” he said, strolling back
again. “Listen; I will imitate a chaﬂinch.”
It was a trick they used to practice when parted from each
other in the woods, and they looked down over the roof of the
Temple, which lay among the trees below them, and thought of
their old rambles for nuts and blackberries, when little Alma would
often join them and tell them where to ﬁnd heavy-laden boughs
and brambles. Suddenly from among the trees rose the call of
another chaﬁiuch, exactly corresponding to Cyril’s.
“Some children at play," said Cyril carelessly; “ Lennie and

Winnie. perhaps. They were going to Swaynestone to slide. I
must get on, Everard; l have a lot to do in Oldport.”
“ ‘Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
And merrily hent the stile-a :
A merry heart goes all the day,
. Your sad tires in a mile-a,’ "
Everard sang out in his deep voice, as the trio continued their walk
at a mended pace. ‘
After another mile through hanging woods of beech and syca-
more, they descended a hill and climbed another crested with cop-
pice, through which they passed, brushing the heavy boar-frost
from the dead leaves and twigs as they went, and pausing for Lilian
to show them the haunt of a little wren in a bank. The tiny bird,
attracted by some crumbs sprinkled on her muﬁ’, came cautiously
out, climbed up her arm, peeked its dainty meal, and suifered itself
to be raised on the muff to the level of her face, in which it gazed
eonﬁdingly, even venturing to peek at a little stray Half of a curl
which stole over her neck. Everard and Maitland stood apart and
watched this pleasant comedy.
“You had the same power over animals as Lilian,” Everard
observed to Cyril. “ What is its secret, I wonder? "
“There are three moral factors,” replied Cyril: “perfect self-
control, that warm and intelligent affection which we call sympathy,
and innocence. Lilian is the most guileless human being on the
face of this earth. There must also be some physical attraction, I
suspect—some mesmeric or electric power, of which we know
little.”
“ But surely you possess the three moral factors; how is it you
have lost your power? Lilian was saying only last night that the
good draw nearer Heaven with increasing years, and you, whose
life has been not merely stainless, but austere—”
“Henry,” interrupted Cyril, in his most patheticmoice, “ I am a
man! ” ‘
Lilian had replaced her tiny friend at his house-door, and now
joined the young men, who went on their way, Everard struck and
startled by the heart-broken accent Cyril laid on the word man, and
wondering if the morbid tone he had of late detected in the young
priest’s mind did not almost verge on insanity.
At the end of the coppice through which they were passing was

a stile standing on a steep bank, which led by rough steps down
into the high-road, and here they parted, the twins once more fall-
ing into discord, each offering llenry as a companion to the other,
and declining to selﬁshly appropriate him, until he lnughingly sug-
gested that he was no mere chattel, but a being endowed with will;
also that his will decided to take the homeward path with Lilian-
a decision which evidently satisﬁed Cyril, who sprang down the
steep bank, and turned, on reaching the road, to the stile—over
which the other two leaned—with a laughing face, and lifted his
hat in his own graceful manner. They gazed after the light, well-
carried ﬁgure for a moment or two, little imagining how all the
light died out of the bright young face when it turned from them,
what a weight of trouble lined the clear brow and drew down the
corners of the delicate month, and added ten years, at least, to his
apparent age, and then they began to retrace their steps through
the wood. I
“ It is like old times,” Lilian observed. “ Cyril and I are grow-
ing old and wise, Henry; we are seldom like that now. We seem
to grow apart, which we must expect.”
“ ‘The old order changeth, giving place to new,’ " quoted Ever-
ard. “ The new may be better, but one does not like to part with
the old," he added falteringly, after a pause.
“The old—was good,” replied Lilian, rather absently; and
the perfect self-command of which her brother had spoken sud-
denly deserted her, with the consciousness that the story of her
life and love was approaching a crisis, and the two walked on in
silence.
Everard‘s bright spirits seemed to have ﬂown onward in the
wake of Cyril, his heart sank down like a thing of lead, and a dread-
ful vision of all his sins and shortcomings, his weaknesses and fail-
ings, rose ghastly and Oppressive before him. Henry Everard
appeared to him as the merest rag of a man—the most complete
failure that ever issued from the workshops of nature and education.
He stole a glance at Lilian, walking with her light step and airy
carriage by his side; a sweet picture of stainless womanhood, her
cheek ﬂushed with purest rose by exercise, her eyes cast down con-
trary to their wont, her hair touched into golden tints by the sun-
light, and the outline of her form traced clearly against a back-
ground of frosted hazel boughs, and his spirit died within him.
What had he to offer her? How could he ever dare? And yet—-

Lilian turned under the stress of his ardent gaze, and met his eyes
for one swift moment; then her looks resumed their commerce with
the mossy, frost-veined path, and a rich rush of crimson ﬂooded her
face.
“ Lilian,” began Henry, breathlessly, “we have been great friends
all our lives."
“ Yes,” replied Lilian, regaining her natural mental poise; “ Cyr-
il and I always appropriate each other’s goods.”
“ Supposing Cyril out of the question,” he added hastily, “ would
you not care for—value my friendship? In short, am I not your
own personal friend? Don’t you care a little for me for my own
sake, Lilian? ”
“Indeed I do, dear Henry,” she replied, a little tremulonsly.
“There is no friend for whom I—whom I value more highly. That
is—yes, we are real friends.”
“ You were always dear to me, very dear—as dear as Marion
herself," continued Henry; “but you have become the dearest of
of all since I scarcely know when—the very dearest human being
on earth. Oh, Lilian, the truth is that I love you with all my
heart! I have loved you long; I can not tell when I began."
“That is not the important question,” returned Lilian, with a
little smile dawning about her lips and eyes. “The question is,
how long do you mean to go on i ”
The same quaint, half-humorous, half-pathetic expression which
so often lighted Cyril’s pale blue eyes now gleamed from Lilian’s
gray orbs, moistened with the sweet dew which so frequently en-
- hanced their luster, and even in that passionate moment Henry
observed this, and thought how closely his love and his friendship
were bound together, and realized that Cyril was dearer than ever
to him now that Lilian was his.
The answer to Lilian’s playful earnest was the old immemorial
assertion of lovers, repeated with endless delightful iteration, long
drawn out with Heaven knows how much unnecessary sweetness.
The old unvarying song the birds sing every spring, with a fresh
charm that never cloys, though the whiteheaded man heard it in his
childhood, and in the days when he too swelled the many-voiced
marriage hymn which ascends perpetually from the youth and
strength of earth; the old eternal song which is yet the freshest
sound that ever falls on the ear of youth, and ﬁlls it with a sweet
bewildered surprise; the theme which changed Eden from a prison

to a home;—this delicious melody was sung over again in the win-
try woods that day, when all the birds were hushed by the frost,
and the earth lay still in its winter trance.
The singing of this pleasant duet took a long time, and the low
midwinter sun passed its meridian and traveled some distance on
its westward way, while they strolled slowly on with many pauses,
slowly enough to chill blood not warmed by the current of vital
ﬂame which young love sends through the veins, until they reached
the spot above the Temple, where they watched the plovers' ﬂight
in the morning. They paused there.
At that moment a delicate music ﬂoated up from the valley, the
well-known, cheery chiming of the wagon-bells. Nearer and nearer
the golden harmony swelled, stronger and stronger the fairy peals
waxed, as the team approached on its way along the high-road to
Oldport, till the soft chimes came tumbling in the full power of their
sweet turbulence upon the clear, still air.
“ Those are our wedding-bells,” said Everard, as they passed on
and let the melodious clashing die away behind them in the distance.
“ It is a good omen."
CHAPTER X.
Tna irony of fate will often have it so that'when life gains its
culminating point of happiness it is but one degree from the dark-
est hour of overthrow; just as the blossom has reached its sweetest
bloom, the blighting frost comes, and all is over. When Everard
and Lilian exchanged the promise whose sweetness was to live
through so many dark and lonely years, they little dreamed that
any peril was near them in the silent wood. They saw no crouch-
_ ing ﬁgure trembling behind the hazel bushes; they did not guess
that any eye, save those of the wild creatures of the wood, wit-
nessed their betrothal; and they went on their way rejoicing,
making plans for the happy future they were to spend side by
side.
When Ben Lee went home to dinner that day, the young groom,
Judkins, accompanied him, as he often did now, ﬁnding a strange
solace to his own grief in that of the troubled father, and pleased
that the old man turned to him for consolation. He usually left

Lee at the door, but on this occasion Mrs. Lee came out and beck-
oned him in. '
“ She‘s gone to meet him,” she said excitedly. “ She made he-
, lieve to go and gather a bit of brush wood in the garden, and she’s
oﬂ up the hill to the wood. He must have passed an hour ago, and
there was the whistle of a chaﬂinch for signal. I heard her whistle
back, the deceitful faggot, though she thought I was safe out of
the way, and she’s been watching for an opportunity ever since.
Straight up the hill she went, Lee, not twenty minutes gone.”
While Mrs. Lee was speaking, the two men had followed her
through the house, and now stood in the back garden, whence they
could see the whole slope of the hill, with its woody crest traced
clear against the blue midday sky. Beneath this crest the trees
had been cleared in a straight, broad strip about the breadth of the
little garden.
"‘Look here, Ben! ” cried J udkins, seizing the arm of Lee, who
was striding rapidly through the garden, and was about to ascend
the treeless slope; “don’t you do nothing rash, now.”
Lee‘s face was purple, and he shook the younger man off with a
muttered oath, when the latter once more caught him by the arm,
and pointed upward, with a. cry.
“I knew it; I always knew it. The damned scoundrell ”
Just within the shadow of the wood, which partly screened
them, were two ﬁgures, the inner and less seen that of a woman in
dark winter clothing; the outer, that of a man in- a suit of gray.
The light hazel twigs impinged but slightly on the latter ﬁgure, so
that its outline was distinctly seen, and the face itself was even
‘ visible sideways for a moment. The female ﬁgure, on the contrary,
with the face hidden in the other’s arm, and its dark outlines less
striking by their color, could only be guessed at. The vision lasted
but a moment; the ﬁgures moved on over the woodland path. The
hazels were denser there, and the path turned into the wood, so
that the pair were gradually hidden, and soon completely vanished
from sight.
“ I’m witness, mind," J udkins muttered, while Lee groaued
aloud. “You and me saw him go through the village this morning
in those gray clothes and that hat.”
So saying, the young man turned and went rapidly back, avoid-
ing the garden, and plunging into the shadow of the trees which
bordered it on either side, while Lee toiled up the bill. He had

not gone far before Alma appeared at the spot where the hazels
grew thin, and issued from the wood. She started slightly when
she saw her father, but soon regained her composure, and advanced
toward him. \
“ What were you doing in the wood 7 ” he asked harshly.
“I only went up for a little fresh air this ﬁne day,” she replied,
gently.
“ Went up to hear the birds sing, perhaps,” he continued, with
savage sarcasm.
“There are no birds singing now,” said Alma, sadly. “Even
the robin is silent in the frost."
“ Ay, and the chaﬁinch. Who were you speaking to a minute
ago? ”
“ N obody," she replied, looking surprised.
“ That's a damned lie, Alma! “
“I have spoken to no human being but you and mother this
week past,” said Alma, in a tone of weary apathy.
They had reached the garden now, and Alma went in, scarcely
hearing the imprecation that burst from her maddened father‘s lips.
Lee remained behind her; then re-ascended the hill and picked
up a little scrap of paper he had seen Alma tear in halves and drop
when she thought herself unobserved. IIe pieced it together, and
read, written in a disguised, backward-slanting hand, “At dusk
to-night. The old spot. Important.”
“0 Alma! ” he cried; “my pretty Alma! my only child!”
Then he turned back, his brow darkening as he went, till the mo-
mentary tenderness was quite eﬁ'aced, and he muttered ﬁercely
beneath his breath, “ I’ll kill him! I‘ll kill him! ”
It was late when the unconscious lovers reached home. The
bell was ringing for luncheon, and Mark Antony was sitting on the
doorstep, looking very cross at his mistress’s delay; for he was a
cat of regular habits, and particularly disliked waiting for meals.
He received Lilian rather distantly, accepted Henry’s caress with
haughty disdain, and then boxed Snip’s ears for barking inoppor-
tunely. ‘
“ Oh, I say, Henry! ” cried Lennie, who was bounding into the
dining-room with ﬂeshed-brushed hair and clean collar, “ain‘t you
in a mess?”
Henry had slipped on a damp bank by a stream, in trying to
gather some ivy colored crimson and gold for Lilian, and a great

brown-and-green stain showed strikingly on the knee of his gray .
suit. In two bounds he was in his room, and in three seconds out
of the stained suit and into another, consisting of a black coat and
lower garments of the same tone of gray as those discarded. The
gray suit was folded neatly and placed on a chair ; and he appeared
at the table in less than ﬁve minutes in that perfect neatness and
cleanliness which so especially distinguish the English gentleman.
No one observed his change of dress, though everybody had
noticed the morning’s gray suit. It was rather light in color for
the season, according to the fashion of that day, and had com-
mended itself to Everard from the sense of cleanliness that light
colors always afforded him. Lilian, indeed, observed that the gray
coat was replaced by a black one, and, in speculating afterward on
the subject, she came to the conclusion that the black had prob-
ably been assumed for indoor wear, as being cooler than the thick
frieze.
Marion appeared at luncheon, having dropped in on her way to
Oldport, where she had errands in connection with the New Year’s
ball at Woodlands. She made a charming little face of disappoint-
ment at the non-appearance of Cyril; but the disappointment by
no means spoiled her appetite, and she kept them all alive by her
sprightly conversation and playful, endearing ways. She petted
Mr. Maitland in a most enchanting manner; teased the children and
the cat; was impertinent to Lilian when gently rebuked for these
misdemenors; snubbed her brother, according to her usual custom;
and was very tender in the little cares she lavished on Mrs. Mait-
land. Her vivacity, and the'bright, warm-colored style of her
beauty, and the aerial lightness of her form, made a good foil to
Lilian’s repose and gentle dignity, the quieter tones of her coloring,
and the more majestic development of her ﬁgure.
Everard regarded his sister as a charming wayward child, loved
her little rebellious ways, and put up contentedly with all her
naughtlness. He was six years her senior, and had been the young-
est of the famin till her birth, which cost their mother her life;
and then the orphan baby became the object of his tenderest care,
and he soothed away his own sorrowful sense of orphanhood by
hovering over the tiny sister‘s slumbers, and amusing her waking
moments by all kinds of childish devices. lt was partly for the
baby’s sake that he was never sent to school; partly also in obedi-
ence to the request of his dead mother, who judged, from her expe-

rience of the elder boys, that the beneﬁts of public schools were
overbalanced by their contaminations and temptations. All his life
he had been Marion‘s devoted slave, and, like other despots, she
received his devotion with a satisfaction not unmingled with con-
tempt.
“What on earth is Cyril doing in Oldport all day?” Marion
asked. “ What business can be possibly have? ”
“ Upon my word, I can not imagine," replied Mr. Maitland, who
had not considered the subject before.
And Marion’s question set Everard thinking. Cyril was not
likely to make many purchases in the little country town; his
affairs were in the hands of London lawyers; he could not want
money; he had no friends there; in short, it was very odd that he
should spend the day in a little market town on business that could '
not be postponed, and so miss the partly expected visit of Marion.
Marion, however, carried Mr. Maitland off with her after
luncheon, on his remembering that he had certain commissions to
execute, and Lilian drove to Swaynestone to pay her long~promised
call on Lady Swaynestone, and advise her about her charities ac-
cording to her request. She had a thousand things to do, and was
much troubled that she could not visit a certain Widow Dove, who
lived in a lonely cottage on the down, that afternoon, and carry her
a. little present of money. 80 Henry, ﬁnding that he could not he
allowed to accompany Lilian to Lady Swaynestone’s since the ladies
wished to discuss business, oﬁered to be Lilian’s almoner, and was
eagerly accepted.
He saw Lilian and the children off in the pony-carriage, and
then betook himself to writing some letters in the room called
Lilian’s; and, having done this, he remembered that Lilian had
lamented having no time to frame and hang the photograph of
Guercino’s picture, and did this for her, the frame having been
already furnished by the village carpenter.
In the mean time, at about three o‘clock, Cyril appeared in the
drawing-room, where Mrs. Maitland was lying on her couch. He
had ﬁnished his business, got some luncheon at Oldport, and been
picked up just out of the town by Farmer Long, who drove him home
in his gig, he said. Then, after ten minutes’ chat with his mother,
he wont to his room, telling her that he wished to get a sermon
ready for the next Sunday, when he was to be at work again, and
requesting that he might not be disturbed till dinner.


## p. 109 (#115) ############################################

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 109
All this Mrs. Maitland told Everard, when he looked into the
drawing-room a few minutes later.
“ I begged him to put off his sermon-writing till another day,"
she said, “ for he looked woefully haggard and weary ; but I could
.not persuade him. He says he feels so burdened until he has got
his Sunday‘s sermons off his mind. Just like his father. He always
does his sermons on Monday, if he can, and feels a free man for the
rest of the week."
“It is rather odd,” Everard observed, “that Cyril should spend
so much time in writing his sermons; for he is supposed to be an
extempore preacher."
“Last Sunday‘s sermon was certainly extempore,” his mother
replied; “ he had some manuscript, but scarcely referred to it more
than once. I wonder if I am a very foolish old woman, Henry, for
thinking that Cyril has a really singular gift in preaching? His
voice appears to me to be something quite out of the common. And
I have heard John Bright’s oratory, and Gladstone’s, and D’Israeli‘s,
the best preachers in our own Church, and those brilliant Roman
Catholics who attracted such crowds to N otre Dame.”
“1 think,'Mrs. Maitland," replied Everard, who was rather dis-
traught in his manner, since he was nerving himself to introduce
the topic of his engagement, “that Cyril will be reckoned the great-
est preacher in the Church of England.”
Then some people called, and Everard made his escape as soon
as he decently could, and at about a quarter to four he started on
his walk to Widow Dove’s with a light heart. His road was, as far
as the wood above the Temple, the same as that he had pursued so
happily with Lilian an hour or two before, and it ﬁlled him with
unspeakable rapture to recall the delightful incidents in his morn-
ing walk as he went, so that he was dreamy and unobservant, and
scarcely spoke to the people he met on his solitary ramble, a thing
very unusual with him. -
The sun was declining redly and with great pomp of cloud
scenery in the west—a glorious ending, he thought, of the happiest
of happy years; and that was the only clew he had to the time of
his starting, when referring in memory to this fatal walk, since he
omitted, in his dreamy abstraction, to look at his watch, though he
was naturally so precise in his habits, and had such a keen sense of
the passage of time.
When he reached Widow Dove’s lonely dwelling, he found it

cold and dark, the door shut, and no smoke issuing from the chim-
ney; the widow and her daughter were evidently gone away for a
day or two. _ He felt a sort of eerie shiver at the darkness and gloom
of the solitary homestead, though be little dreamed that his fate or
the fate of those he loved could be inﬂuenced by a circumstance so
triﬂing as the emptiness of a secluded cottage.
T hen he turned his face homeward in the gathering dusk, choos-
ing another way from that by which he came, by that strange
fatality which pursues doomed men, and strode gayly and swiftly
along over the open down, every dimple and hollow of which were
familiar to him from boyhood. Some stars were out now, spark-
ling keenly in the clear, frosty sky, in which the moon had not yet
risen. Over hedge and ditch, and through copses, and round plan-
tations Everard sped blithely, until he approached the high-road
leading to Malbourne. Here his pace slackened, and he listened
carefully for the sound of Long’s wagon-bells, which he thought
would carry far in the frosty stillness.
But there was no repetition of the fairy pcals which rang so
blithely in the morning, and he got as far as the wheelwright’s corner
without having heard them. Grove, the wagoner, was to bring
him a parcel from Oldport, a little parcel that he feared might be
forgotten if he did not intercept it. Here he met Granfer, toiling
slowly along on his way to spend the evening at Hale’s, whose wife
was one of his numerous descendants. llad Granfer heard the team
go by? he asked.
“No, I ain’t a yeard ‘em since this marning, zo to my; not as I
knows on, Dr. Everard,” Granfer replied, with his usual circumlo-
cution. " I ’lows I yeared ’em’s marning, zure enough. They was
a-gwine into Oldport, as I hreckons, as you med zay zumwheres
about noon or thereabouts. No, I ’lows I ain’t a-yeared nor a bell
zince that there; not as I knows on, I ain’t.”
After some further conversation, Everard strolled slowly on in
the direction of Long’s farm, full of anxiety about his precious
packet, which he knew would fade. Near Long's he heard that the
team had returned some time before, and his packet had been sent
to the Rectory.
Striking across the ﬁelds, he returned in the deepening night,
without going through the village, and, meeting with a little delay
in consequence of an old gap having been recently stopped in a
fence—a good stiﬁ bullﬁnch—he gained the Rectory at about six

o’clock, thus missing, to his disgust, the charmed hour of tea.
There, when he entered, was the precious little box on the hall
table, and he caught it up, and was going to unfasten it in his room,
when Winnie waylaid him at the foot of the stairs, eager for a
romp, which romp resulted in Winnie, while being tossed high in
air, throwing back her head and striking him a tremendous blow in
the eye with it, so that he set her hastily down with an exclamation
of pain, and put his hand to his face.
"' You’ve done it now, Winnie; blinded me,” he said.
“Oh, Henry, I am so sorry! ” sobbed Winnie. “ And they
won’t let me go to Long’s tea-party to-morrow; it was only on
Sunday I made Ingram Swaynestone’s nose bleed.”
“Never mind, darling,” said Everard, kissing and soothing her;
“it was not your fault at all.”
Then he promised to let no one know of his black eye, and to
do his best to cure it; to which intent he procured raw meat from
the kitchen, and went to his room, taking Winnie with him to help
him unpack the parcel, which contained some choice white ﬂowers.
These be bid the child take to her sister at once, while he shut him-
self up, and tried to subdue the rising inﬂammation in the bruise-d
eye to the best of his ability.
He was anxious to avoid such an ornament as a black eye on his
own account, as well as the child’s, since a black eye does not im-
prove a man’s appearance at a ball, nor is it in keeping with popular
ideas of a newly accepted lover. So he doctored himself till it was
time to get ready for dinner, and then, seeing the gray suit lie on
the chair as he had placed it in the morning, he sponged the green
stain away from it. Searcer had he done this when he saw other
stains, some still wet, and, procuring some fresh water, sponged
these also. The water was red when he ﬁnished.
“ Blood," he thought, being well used to such stains. “Did I
out myself anywhere, I wonder? ”
‘ He did not, however, waste much thought on this trivial inci-
dent, but sponged the garments clean in his tidy way, and left the
crimsoned water in the basin, where it subsequently gave Martha,
the housemaid, what she described as a turn. Then he made his
appearance in the drawing-room, carefully avoiding the lights, and
gave rather a lame account of himself since his return from the
fruitless errand to the Widow Dove’s. He was rewarded for his
labor on Lilian"s behalf, by the sweetest smile in the world, and was

enchanted to observe at dinner that Lilian were one of the white
roses from his bouquet in her dress.
Cyril did not appear at dinner; he sent word that one of his bad
headaches had come on, and begged that he might be undisturbed
for the night.
“Poor dear Cyril!” said Lilian; “it is so hard for a man to
have headaches. His are like mine; nothing but quiet heals them.”
“Their very headaches are twins,” Mr. Maitland observed.
“ Why, Henry," he added, “ what have you done to your eye?
You appear to have been in the wars, man.” '
Winnie, who was standing by the tire, here threw an imploring
glance at Henry, and completely scattered what few talents he had
ever possessed for dissimulation.
“ I—I—I knocked my head against something in the dark," he
stammered; “ I—it was purely accidental.”
“ What a nasty blow? ” said Lilian, observing it; “you will
have a black eye. What a pity! Ah, sirl perhaps that accounts
for your rudeness to me this evening.”
" My rudeness, Lilian? What can you mean? ” asked Henry.
“ Yes, your incivility to me, and also to Mark Antony, who was
actually doing you the honor of running to meet you—the haughty
Mark himself. Think of that! ” '
"I can only apologize to both with the deepest humility,” he
replied, stroking the petted animal, who was dining with his usual
urbane condescension at Lilian’s side; “ but indeed I am quite inno-
cent, having seen neither you nor puss since you started for Swayne-
stone.” .
Then Lilian told how at tea~time, on passing from the back re-
gions toward the drawing-room, accompanied by her usual body-
guard, Mark Antony, she had seen Henry run across the back hall
toward the staircase; had called to him about Widow Dove’s com-
mission; while the cat, with a mew of delight, had bounded after
him. He had rushed on, however, in the dusk, a gray, ghostlike
ﬁgure, and ﬂitted up the stairs to his room, followed by Mark, whom
he expelled ignominiously, shutting the door after him.
“ You must be under some delusion,” replied Henry, utterly
confounded. “I saw no cat when I came in.”
“It was growing very dark,” Lilian said, “and Martha was late
in lighting the hall-lamp to-night, for which, indeed, I afterward
rebuked her.”

“The lamps were lighted—” Henry began, and then stopped at
the sight of Winnie, whd' was gesticulating in an agonized manner
behind her mother’s chair. “This sounds extremely ghost-like,” he
added ; “ I hope it bodes me no misfortune._ It must have been my
Wraith, Lilian.”
“ It sounds rather eerie, certainly,” interposed Mr. Maitland.
“Lilian dear, I hope you are not going to take to seeing people‘s
wraiths. It gives me the most fearful jumps to think of.”
“ I am creeping from head to foot,” added Mrs. Maitland, laugh-
ing; “and on the last night of the year, too. Dr. Everard, what
prescriptions have you for young ladies who take to ghost-seeing? ”
“I am going to ask you for another cutlet, sir. My appetite will
convince you that I, at least, am no illusion, but a substantial reali-
ty,” said Henry, instead of replying.
“There never was any deception about you, Harry lad,” returned
Mr. Maitland, cordially; “ you were always real.”
The evening which ensued ought to have been very happy, but
somehow it was not. A vague uneasiness was in the air; Cyril’s
absence created a void in the family party, and the children, who
were permitted to stay up for the New Year, grew tired, and con-
sequently tiresome. Mr. Maitland, when he recovered from his
after-dinner nap, which was unusually long, read them one of
Dickens’s Christmas tales, and although it was pleasant to Henry to
sit by Lilian and watch her beautiful white hands at their busy task
of embroidering some silken ﬂowers, he was not sorry when, the
servants having been assembled in the drawing-room, a pleasant
clinking of glasses was heard, and, the usual ceremonies of toasting
and hand-shaking gone through, the bells began drowsily chiming
the Old Year out from the beifry hard by.
They all went into the hall then, Mr. Maitland opened the door
wide to let the New Year in, and Lilian and Henry, hand-in-hand,
gazed trustfully out into the starry sky to meet it, their hearts full
of the sweetest hopes.
When Henry went to his room soon after, he could not refrain
from opening Cyril’s door, which adjoined his own, and just look-
ing in, thinking he might be asleep. He pushed the door very
softly, and introduced his head. Only a faint light was burning
from one candle, and by this dim ray he saw Cyril kneeling half-
dressed before a picture of the Cruciﬁxion. His face was hidden in
his hands, and he was sobbing in a low, suppressed way.

Henry shut the door softly, and stealthily withdrew, vexed at
his own intrusion. “ That is not the way to cure the headache,” he
mused, half awed at the manner in which the young priest received
the New Year. Yet who could venture to say that watching and
fasting and tearful contrition were not eminently ﬁtting, in one set
apart for holy functions, at such a season? “ I wonder,” Everard
continued to speculate, “what inﬁnitesimal peccadilloes the poor
lad is mourning with all that expenditure of nervous energy?”
Then he thought of his own weaknesses and shortcomings, and felt
pitchy black in contrast with a soul so white.
CHAPTER XI.
Tm: wheelwright’s house stood just on the crest of the steep
little hill which carries the pilgrim down into the village of Mal-
bourne with a rapid acceleration of pace, and which ends where the
{our roads meet. The Sun Inn stands at one corner, facing the
incoming pilgrim cheerfully on its left; and opposite this tidy
hostelry stands a sign-post apparently waving four gaunt arms dis~
tractedly, and seeming to bid the wayfarer pause beneath the
thatched roof of the little inn, whether his journey’s end he onward
over the high-road, or oblige him-to turn aside through the village
by church and Rectory.
On the traveler‘s right, facing him, is a cottage, and facing that
is the wheelwright’s yard, full of timber, and wagons halt“ built or
broken. The wheelwright’s dwelling, standing above the grassy
yard, commands a ﬁne view of the village nestled under the down,
and the sweeping parklands of Northover on one side, and on the
other looks over an undulating landscape to the sea. It is a cheery
little house, pleasantly shaded by a couple of shapely lindens in front,
and close to the high-road, upon which its front windows and deep-
timbered porch give.
On New Year’s Eve the wheelwright‘s windows were all lighted
up, and there was even a lantern at the little front wicket, which
gazed out like a friendly eye, as if to bid people enter and make
merry within, and threw a yellow fan-shaped radiance on the steep
road without. The porch door was open, and disclosed .a passage

lighted by a candle in a tin sconce adorned with holly. On one
side, an open door revealed the chill dignities of the best parlor,
which not even a blazing ﬁre and abundance of holly-berries could
quite warm.
On a hair-cloth sofa in this state apartment sat Mrs. Hale, of
Melbourne Mill, and Mrs. Wax, the schoolmaster’s wife, both ex-
ceedingly upright, and both holding a handkerchief of Gargantuan
dimensions over the hands they crossed in their laps. Opposite, in
a horse-hair arm-chair, sat an elderly lady in a plum‘colored silk
gown, gold chain, and a splendid cap, also very upright, and also
holding a Gargantuan handkerchief. This was Mrs. Oave, the wife
of a small farmer in the neighborhood.
Each lady‘s face wore a resigned expression, mingled with the
calm exultation natural to people who know themselves to be the
most aristocratic persons in a social gathering. Each realized that
Wards hat Bar-dc, and felt herself equai to the occasion; each
paused, before making or replying to an observation, to consider
the most genteel subjects of conversation, and the most genteel
language in which to clothe them.
“Remorkably ﬁne weather for the time of year, ladies,” ob-
served Mrs. Hale. soothing her soul by the pleasant rustle her shot-
silk govvn made when she smoothed it, and regretting that her gold
chain was not so new-fashioned as Mrs. Cave’s; while, on the other
hand, she experienced a delicious comfort in meditating on the
superiority of her brooch, which was a large ﬂat pebble in a gold
frame.
“Indeed, mem, it is most seasonable, though trying for delicate
chestes,” returned Mrs. Gave, with her ﬁnest company smile, after
which a pause of three minutes ensued. _
> “Some say the frost is on the breek,” continued Mrs. Hale
wondering if it would be genteel to ask Mrs. Gave how much her
cap cost. She had an agonized suspicion that it would not.
After ﬁve minutes, Mrs. Wax, whose comparative youth and
lower rank occasioned her some diﬁidcnce, took up her parable in
the following genteel manner: “Her ladyship was observing this
marning—”
But what her ladyship was observing was never revealed to man,
since at that moment Widow Hale, the host’s mother, came burst-
ing in, stout, healthy, and red-faced, her cap slightly awry, and
called out in her hearty, wholesome voice—

“ Well, now, my dears, and how are you getting on? I’m that
hurled up with so many about, I ain’t had a minute to set after ye
all. Mary Ann, my dear, give me a kiss do, and a hearty welcome
to you all, and a kiss all round, and do make yourselves at home.
Now, is the tea to your liking? This best tea-pot ain’t much at
drawing. I ain‘t much of a one for best things myself; well
enough for looking at, and just to say you’ve got them, but give me
work-a-day things for comfort. There ain‘t above half the com-
pany come yet, and Mary Ann upset about the pies for supper. Do
just as you would at home, and you will please me. If there ain’t
dear old Granfer coming in, bless his heart! Come in, Granfer,
and kindly welcome."
And so saying, the kind soul bustled out, and relieved Granfer
of his hat, while her daughter-in-law, theiactual hostess, came to do
the honors of the best parlor, bringing in three more female guests
of distinction, who were much awed by the appalling gentility of
the three already assembled, and a little inclined to regret their own
social importance.
Granfer and the widow, in the mean time, entered the great
kitchen, a long, low, whitewashed room with heavy beams across
the ceiling, a stone ﬂoor, and a wide hearth with a wood ﬁre burn-
ing between dogs upon it. The ceiling and walls were their every-
day decoration of hams, guns, 9. spit, various cooking utensils, a tiny
bookshelf, and a large dresser well garnished with crockery and
pewters, together with their festal Christmas adorning of holly, ﬁr,
and mistletoe, and a round dozen of tin sconces bearing tallew
candles. There was an oaken settle on one side the chimney cor-
ner, in the coziest nook of which Granfer deposited his bent form
with a sigh of content, and gazed round upon the assembled guests
with benevolence.
On a long table on trestles at one end of the room was spread a
solid meal, consisting of a huge ham, own brother to those depend-
ing in rich brown abundance from the ceiling; a south-country
skim-milk cheese, ﬁnely marbled with greenish blue veins, and re-
sembling Stilton in reduced circumstances; a great yellow and
brown mass of roast beef; a huge pie; several big brown'blocks of
plum-cake; and some vast loaves of white home-baked bread and
pats of fresh butter. The forks were of steel, and black-handled
like the knives; and the spoons, of which there was a dearth, were
pewter. A deﬁciency of tea-cups suggested to Corporal Tom Hale


## p. 117 (#123) ############################################

THE SILENUE OF DEAN MAITLAND. 117
the agreeable expedient of sharing one between a lady and a gen-
tleman, which was hailed with applause by his naval brother, and
immediately acted upon.
For those guests who looked upon tea as an enervating beverage,
there was ample provision in the shape of various brown and yellow
jugs ﬁlled with ale from the cask Tom and Jim had procured for
the occasion; and it was generally understood that liquor of a still
more comiorting nature was held in reserve to stimulate convivi-
ality at a later hour. The blacksmith, Straun, the clerk, Stevens,
with their wives and families, were there; also Baines, the discon-
tented tailor, and the husbands of the best-parlor ladies.
' The wheelwright‘s wife, a comely woman of thirty, and his sis-
ter, a blooming damsel some ten years younger, ran to and fro with
ﬂushed faces among the guests, while the widow made herself
ubiquitous.
The uniforms of Tom and Jim, with those of three or four artil-
lerymen from the neighboring forts, and the red coats of a couple
of linesmen, together with the bright ribbons of the women, lent
color and variety to the monotony of black coats and smock- frocks,
~ and upon the whole the wheelwright‘s kitchen presented as cheery
and animated a sight as one would wish to see on a New Year’s
Eve. Nor was a town element wanting in the rustic gathering; for
just as tea was in full swing, and little Dickie Stevens—whose tea
lay in the future, after the serving of his elders—was supplying the
place of a band by playing hymn-tunes on his coucertina, a taxed-
cart drove up and deposited two chilled mortals from Oldport, Mr.
and Mrs. Wells, green-grocers, and related, by some inextricable
family complications known only in that remote south-country dis-
trict, more or less to nearly all the company.
Tea being ﬁnished, pipes were produced, also ale, and there was
wild work in a dimly lighted quarter of the kitchen, where the Hale
brothers had cunniugly arranged unexpected mistletoe, and whence
smothered shrieks of laughter and sounds as of ears being vigorously
boxed issued every now and then.
The odd part about the mistletoe business was the extreme gulli-
bility of the ladies, who were by far too guileless to proﬁt by the ex-
perience of others in that dangerous region, and suﬁ‘ered themselves
to be decoyed thither on the ﬁimsiest pretexts, and betrayed the
utmost surprise and indignation at the kissing which invariably
ensued. As for Tom and Jim, they went to work with a business-

like determination to kiss every girl in the room, and several ro-
spectable matrons into the bargain. It was about this time that the
artillery sergeant and the wheelwright's pretty sister Patty vanished,
and were subsequently discovered at the front door, enjoyingrthe
soft December breeze and studying astronomy, a study which pro-
duced the happiest subsequent results, and set the Melbourne bells
chiming in the spring of the coming year.
So large and successful a party had not been held in Malbourne
for many a year, the predominance of the military element greatly
contributing to its success; for the sons of Mars excelled not only
in the art of pleasing the fairer sex, which has in all ages been con-
sidered their special function, but possessed many other accomplish-P
ments, of social value. A very pretty bit of fencing was exhibited
between a red and a blue coat, and Corporal Tom snuﬁ'ed candles
with a pistol, amid shrieks of terriﬁed delight from the women.
One soldier sang a comic, another a sentimental, song; and when
little Dick Stev'ens was perched on a table, and warbled out,
“Rosalie, the Prairie Flower,” and “ Wait for the Wagon,” to the
accompaniment of Wax”: clarionet and Buines’s violin, the kitchen
ceiling trembled and threatened to drop its quivering hams and
holiies at the powerful chorus furnished by these stalwart warriors,
and the gentility of the best parlor was ﬁnally melted by it to such
a deliquescence as to mingle freely with the vulgar currents circu-
lating in the kitchen.
Indeed, village talent was quite in the shade during the ﬁrst
part of the evening, and the discreet Corporal Tom observed such
depreciation on the faces of the village genuises that he resolved to
put off asking for the recitation with which he knew a certain war~
rior to be primed until a later hour, and ~ereated a diversion by pro~
posing a game of Turn the Trencher, which absorbed the children
and younger people at one end of the room, and left the circle of
elders round the chimney free to converse or visit the best, parlor,
where fruit and sherry wine were laid out, as they pleased.
“I seen young Mr. Maitland in Oldport to-day," observed the
town areen-grocer’s lady, one of the ﬁreside circle, by way of fur-
nishing the town news to her rustic friends.
‘* Now, did you, Mrs. Wells? ” returned her host. “Ah! so
you zeen he? "
“ Yes, Mr. Hale; I seen him go into the bank opposite, and stay
there—oh! I should think a good hour,” continued Mrs. Wells, ad~

justing her cap-ribbons with a complacent sense of their splendor.
“He‘s grown more personable than ever; but he do look ill, poor
young gentleman, to be sure—that white and thin! “
“ That’s living in Lunuun," said Hale; “ Lunnun takes it out of
a man. I never held with going to Lunnun myself. Never knowed
any good come of it.”
“Ah, you don’t know everythink, Jacob Hale! ” said Granfer,
benevolently. “ ’Tain’t, zo to zay, nateral to a man as gives hisself
entirely to wheels. You does your best, but more zense can't come
out of ye than the Almighty have a put in. Na-a. You don‘t know
everythink, Jacob Hale, I zays."
The profundity of this remark produced a deep impression, par-
ticularly upon the \vheelwright, who appeared to think he had re-
ceived a great compliment from Granfer, and rekindled his pipe at
the burning gorse on the hearth with a beatiﬁed air.
“Zeems as though zummat had been a-taking of it out of Mr.
Cyril,” observed the blacksmith, thoughtfully.
“ ’Tain’t, 20 to zay, Lunnon, J urge Straun,” replied Granfer,
solemnly. “No, Jarge Straun; ’tain’t Lunnon, as you med zay.
I zes to Bill Stevens ’s maruing, I zays, fBill,’ I zays, zays I, ‘ brains
is the matter wi’ Mr. Cyril,’ I zays, ‘that’s what’s the matter wi'
he’ ”; and Granfer‘s keen gray eyes took a survey of all the listen-
ing, stolid faces, and he experienced a keen sense of enjoyment, as
he leaut forward, his hands crossed on his staff, and felt that he
was getting into regular conversational swing. “ Ay, that’s what I
zed, zure enough,” he added.
“Brains!” repeated Straun, thoughtfully.

“ You ain’t a yeared everythink, J arge Strauu,” returned Gran-
fer, severely. “ Ay, you med mark my words, it all hruns to brains
wi’ Mr. Cyril; there ain’t, as you med zay, nothing left to hrun to

ain’t, 20 to zay, zo much leaf as you med swear by; then, ages, 1
tell ’ee, where it all runs to leaf, you can’t expect no vlower to
speak on. Look at brocoli! "
Here Granfer, being fairly launched, struck out from personal to
general observations, and thence, at the prompting of his grandson,
to the hoary regions of history.
" Ay, I minds Boney, to be zure-wwell I minds he "; and he re-
“I never yearcd of

lated the oft-told tale of the freQuent scares the inhabitants of those
coasts received, sometimes by authentic rumors of Bonaparte’s ap-
pearance at sea, sometimes by the accidental or mistaken kindling
of the beacons on every prominent headland and on the downs,
where a watch was kept day and night for the appearance of the
dreaded foe.
He told how the wealthy farmers sent their silver and other
valuables, sometimes including even their women and children
under the latter head, inland for safety—most of them, apparently,
having ﬁrst consulted Granfer on the subject—in consequence of
Bonaparte’s rumored descents on that fated coast; also of the rous~
ing of the volunteers at the dead of night on one of these occasions
—of their march to the sea-shore, and their all getting lost on the
way, and arriving next morning on a scene of profound peace.
Then came the great smuggler story, and the tragic history of the
loss of the ship Halifax, the crew and passengers of which lay
buried in the wind-swept churchyard near the fatal shore which
wrecked them. Five young women were among those washed
ashore and subsequently buried, and their appearance, as Granfer
saw them, lying pale and beautiful side by side awaiting burial, was
the climax of this story; after delivering it he usually paused and
looked round for some moments with working lips to enjoy the
silence of the interested listeners.
Having thus got his audience, which consisted mainly of village
seniors, well in hand, Granfer began, to the accompaniment of the
young people’s continuous laughter, somewhat softened by distance,
to play upon their love of the marvelous and the horrible, and pro~
duced some delightful creeps by his eerie tales; and ﬁnally landed
himself in his renowned narrative of his midnight adventure upon
Down End, a bleak, storm-stricken eminence where the last man
gibbeted in these parts, a truculeut villain, with a most romantic
history, then swung in chains.
Granfer had been belated on a moonless, cloudy night, had wan-
dered far in the cutting wind, and had begun to guess that he had
at last done with the downs, and reached the well-known Down
End—an unpleasant spot for a midnight stroll, since, besides the
unwelcome presence of the murderer on his gibbet, an extensive
chalk quarry there supplied an array of little precipices high enough
to cost one slipping over the edge his life.
Granfer had arrived at a vague mass looming through the dark-

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAI TLAN D. 12 1
ness, a dim something, which he conjectured to be the signpost, an
erection which shared the same eminence with the gibhet at many
yards distance from it, and was about to strike a light with the ﬂint
and steel in his pocket to a weird accompaniment of shrieks and
moans and unholy riot of clankings and hissings, which might be
only the voices of the midnight storm, but, on the other hand, might
be what Granfer wisely left to his hearers’ imaginations, when “all
on a zuddent there comes a girt hang on the shoulders of me,
vlint and steel vlies out of my hands, and down I goos, vlat as a
vlonnder on my vaace, wi’ zummat atop 0‘ me,” the old man was
saying, his wrinkled face and keen eyes lighted by the blazing gorse
ﬁre and his own imagination, while Straun and Hale, and the other
worthies, with open mouths, staring eyes, and dropped pipes, and
'the women, with various contortions of visage and extensive clasping
of shivering hands, gazed with tense, strained attention upon the
withered, eager countenance, when the door burst open, and Will-
iam Grove, supported by Corporal Tom, staggered into the kitchen,
white-faced and trembling, and fell into a chair placed for him
in the center of the room, clapping his hands convulsively upon
his knees, and exelaiming at intervals, “Oh, Lard! O Lard ’a
massey! ” and the sudden apparition, coming thus upon strained
nerves and excited imaginations, produced a most alarming
eﬂ‘ect.
The women screamed and clung to one another; the men uttered
ejaculations; the game of Turn the Trencher broke up in dismay,
and the players came clustering round the distracted Grove; while
the services of the military were called into re‘quisition to soothe
the terrors and agitations of the prettiest girls, the gallant sergeant
ﬁnding it necessary to place his arm round the blooming form of
Miss Patty Hale for the distressed damsel's support.
“Lard ’a masse'yl Willum Grove," exclaimed Granfer at last,
with impatience, “if you ain’t got nothink better to say than Lard
’a massey, you med 20 well bide quiet, I tell ’ee. Lard love ’ee,
Willum, you never had no zense to speak on, but you be clans
dunch now. Ay, Willum he clane dunch,” he added; while the
astute Tom, who said that William had come ﬂying in at the porch
door (where the gallant corporal had been helping pretty Miss Cave
to admire the moon), and could be prevailed upon to make no other
observation than that so scornfully censured by Granfer, assisted
the wagoner‘s faculties by a timely draught of ale. After disposing

of this and drying his mouth with the back of his hand, William
recovered slightly and found his tongue.
“ Lard ’a massey on usalll ” he cried; “they bin an’ done for
poor Ben Lee.” -
“Done for him! ” cried a chorus of voices in various tones of
horror and dismay.
“Done var en, zure enough! ” repeated William, rocking him-
self backward and forward, in a strange contrast to his usual sto-
lidity. “We bin an’ vound the body] "
It was even so. Ben Lee left his home at dinner-time and had
not returned. At tea-time, Mrs. Lee was returning in the dusk from
an errand to Malbourne, and met a hurrying ﬁgure clad in gray, as
she came through the ﬁelds beneath the wood, which was on the
crest of the hill above the Temple. She found only Alma in the
house, and, after waiting with more discontent than disquiet, she
concluded that work had delayed her husband, and ﬁnally took her
tea and seated herself at her needlework by the ﬁre. '
At half-past seven Sir Lionel and Lady Swaynestone, with their
daughter, were dressed for a dinner-party and awaiting the arrival
of the carriage, which had been ordered at that hour. But no car-
riage appeared, and a message to the stables elicited the news that
the coachman had not been there since the afternoon, when Ingram
Swaynestone chanced to have seen him near his home. A messen-
ger to the Temple returned with the tidings that he had not been
home; and then Judkins asked for an audience with Sir Lionel,
which resulted in a search-party being sent forth to ﬁnd the miss- -
ing man, whose habits were regular and punctual.
William Grove, who chanced to be on some errand to Swayne-
stone for his master before going to the wheelwright’s party,
assisted in the search, and was with Judkins when Lee was dis-
covered quite dead in the wood above his home. There were no
signs of any struggle on the hard frozen path, from whence his
body had evidently been dragged into the fern and brush, whither
it was traced by the marks on the rims-covered moss and the dis-
order of the ferns and brambles. A slight wound on the face,
which had bled, but could not have killed him, was the only sign of
violence at ﬁrst seen.
The lights were not extinguished at Swaynestone House till
nearly dawn. Sir Lionel, who was a magistrate, set to work at
once to investigate the fatal affair, the police were immediately

informed, and every member of the Swayuestone household was
closely questioned, as well as Mrs. Lee. Poor Alma could not
be subjected to much interrogation, and was not in a position to
throw any light upon the tragedy. Death was not the only visitor
at the Temple; a new life, scarcely less tragic than death, began
there on that fatal night, and the New Year rose upon sorrow and
dismay in hall and cottage.
It took long to extract what he knew of the affair from William
Grove, but this was at length accomplished, amid varied comment
and ejaculation. Granfer said no further word until the whole
truth had been elicited, and then upon the ﬁrst favorable pause he
looked round with an air of great solemuity, and took up his parable
thus: “You med all mark my words. Zomebody’ll hae to swing
for this yere. Ay, I’ve said it, and I’ll zay it agen: zomebody’ll
has to swing.”
CHAPTER XII.
Nnxr to the divine sweetness of youthful love, nothing so com-
pletely charms and enthralls us as the rapid development of new
ideas and the swift inrush of fresh knowledge in the spring-time of
life. How the world widens to the eager student, what vast and
endless horizons open out to his gaze, as he acquires fresh knowledge!
What a sense of power his thoughts give him as they draw together
from the vague of scattered speculations, and take deﬁnite shape
before him! Love unlocks the gate of a yet undiscovered world of
emotion, which has its higher and lower circles, its purgatory and
paradise, and its endless possibilities beyond; knowledge and ripen-
ing thought rend the obscuring veils from the illimitable universe.
The enthusiastic delight of fresh discovery is in both cases the very
elixir of life; nay, it is life itself.
On the last day of the year Everard discovered the new world
of love; and on New Year’s morning, under the stimulus of a fresh
happiness, a theory, after which he had long been groping with
many a vague surmise and hazardous hypothesis, interrupted by
hopeless gaps in evidence, suddenly revealed itself complete and
ﬂawless before him. It came like an electric shock, with such a
happy ﬂash of inspiration that he was obliged to pause in his dress-

ing to take in the results of the unconscious cerebration which his
studies and speculations had set up, while tears of joy rushed to his
eyes. Clear and distinct as it was to his own mind, he knew that
years of patient labor and minute scientiﬁc investigation must pass
before he could present it to other minds, but he knew also that,
once veriﬁed, it would make an epoch in the study of physiology.
Such a superahundance of happiness as Everard‘s might well
excite the malignity of envious gods, and would have prompted an
ancient Greek to throw away some precious thing in all haste. But,
being a Christian Englishman, Everard did not follow the example
of Polycrate; nay, had he been a Greek of old days, he would
never have imputed envy or malignity to the strong immortals.
Strength was to him a guarantee of goodness, because his own
strength made him noble and kind; it made him also pitiful to the
malice and spite of weak things.
Full of this new rapture. his eyes hazy with abstraction, as the
eyes of dreamers are hazy with dreams, Everard went forth to meet
the ‘New Year’s new joy like one borne upon clouds, and reached
the breakfast-room just at the end of prayers. Mr. Maitland, ac
cording to custom, was dismissing the maids with a kind good
morning and New Year‘s wish, when Eliza, whose face was stained
with tears, paused with a spasmodic, “Oh, please, sir! ”
“ You are diseomposed, Eliza,” said Mr. Maitland, gently, while
he looked round and observed similar perturbation on the faces of
the other maids. “ Nothing wrong, I hope i ”
“ Poor Ben Lee! ” sobbed Eliza, resorting to her handkerchief.
“He was found dead, sir,” added Martha, the housemaid, her
grief, which was sincere, tempered by a certain delight in the tragic-
ally impressive.
“ It was Stevens brought the new s,” added the cook, who was
also not impervious to the pleasure of communicating disastrous in-
tolligence.
“ Found dead! My good girls! In Heaven’s name, where?
when? Oh, surely not! Where is Stevens? ” cried Mr. Maitland,
as much agitated as the heart of woman could desire. “ Oh, those
poor Lees! What trouble! what trouble! ”
“ It was last night, sir," continued Eliza, much refreshed by her
master's perturbation, and by the copious tears with which she had
accompanied the broken narrative. “Sir Lionel had lanterns sent
out for him." '

“He did not die in his bed, then '1’ " the deep voice of Everard
broke in.
“ He was hid away in the wood,” replied Martha; “ and they do
say—i!
“I must go to the Temple at once,” interrupted Mr. Maitland,
starting off to get his hat, with an injunction to the women not to
talk over the tragedy, which he might as well have addressed to
the wind. ‘
Lilian with great difﬁculty succeeded in keeping him back until
she had made him drink some coffee and take a little food, when he
started oﬁ at railroad speed, bidding her tell the clerk there would
be no service that morning. Then Henry and Lilian and the two
children sat down to a melancholy breakfast, and the discussion of
the tragedy, of which they gathered from the servants as much as
William Grove had communicated on the previous night, together
with a ﬁne growth of conjecture and exaggeration.
“ Poor Alma! ” sighed Lilian, when her father was gone. “Oh,
Henry l what do you think of it? "
“I am afraid it looks rather dark,” returned Henry, not observ-
ing the entrance of Eliza with a hot dish. “ Lee’s behavior, when
last I saw him, was most unaccountable. His trouble evidently
preyed on his mind, p'oor fellow.”
“ Oh, Henry! what do you mean? Not—”
“ An unhinged mind quickly turns to suicide," replied Henry,
suddenly checking himself as he became aware of the wide gaze of
Winnie‘s eyes immediately opposite him.
Five minutes after, the whole of Melbourne knew that Dr. Ever-
ard had received the intelligence with little surprise, and at once
ascribed it to suicide.
Cyril had started for Woodlands before breakfast, leaving a
charming note of New Year’s wishes for everybody, and say-
ing that it was incumbent on him to go to Woodlands at once,-to
apologize for his incivility in not meeting Marion on the previous
dav.
“ What a devoted lover! ” Mr. Maitland had observed, on hear-
ing the note read. “Well, man has but one spring-time, though
the birds renew their youth every year.”
“I think, papa,” said Winnie, in one of those sudden visitations
of acuteness which befall little girls occasionally, “that Cyril is not
so-devoted to loving as to being loved.”

And Lilian knew that the child had hit on her brother's weak
point.
After breakfast, Everard accompanied Lilian and the children
on a visit to the invalid donkey and other dumb dependents. It
was pleasant to see Lilian in the poultry-yard. When she entered
the yard she gave a little coo, and a ﬂock of pigeons, preening
themselves aloft on gable and roof in the sunshine, came ﬂutter-
ing down, a. rustling cloud of white wings, and settled upon her till
she seemed a parody on Lot’s wife, a pillar of birds instead of salt,
while the more adventurous fowls sprang up and peeked the grain
from her basket and her hands, till she scattered pigeons, fowls,
and all, with alight “ I'lishl ” and wave of her arms.
Everard, the children, and the two dogs stood apart to watch
this little scene, Everard smoking tranquilly, and delighting in the
' picture of Lilian involved in her cloud of dove-like wings. During
this progress he told her eagerly of the theory which had been born
in his brain that morning, and they both discussed it, Lilian being
sufﬁciently grounded in science to comprehend something of the
importance of the subject, and having, moreover, the receptive in-
tellect which readily admits half-grasped notions. '
“ We shall have to work hard for this,” Everard said, knowing
that Lilian would willingly take her share of the toil.
“It will be well worth hard wor ,” she replied joyously; “ but
Ihave other work now, so I must go in. No; I have not told
mother,” she added, in reply to a whispered question from Henry;
“ I would rather it came from you.”
“And I have had no opportunity as yet," he said. “So I have
to skate with these scamps, have 1? Very well; but join us as
soon as you can, Lilian."
“And mind you bring some cake,” added Lennie, who was
nothing if not practical; and the children, hanging one on each
of Everard‘s hands, danced joyously oﬁ into Northover Park,
where they were to skate on a piece of water a quarter of a mile
off.
Just as they entered the gate by the lodge, Lyster Garrett was
leaving it. He looked at Henry with some surprise, and received
his greeting very stiﬁiy.
“Oh, do come and skate, Lysterl” cried Lennie; “then you
can help me, and Winnie can have Henry to herself.‘7
“I am going to Swaynestone," Garrett said. “This is a sad

business of Lee’s. Foul play, I fear; ” and he looked searchineg
at Everard. ‘
“Foul play?” returned Everard. “Nonsensei Why, I sup-
pose poor Lee never had an enemy in his life.”
" He had one,” said Garrett, with marked emphasis. “ I should
strongly recommend that person to make himself scarce.”
“Lee was not a. man to make enemies, poor fellow,” replied
Everard. “ It will all come out at the inquest, no doubt. Mr. Mait-
land is gone to the Temple to comfort the poor widow.”
And they passed on, Everard wondering what on earth was the
matter with young Garrett, who was studying for the Bar, and was
rather inclined to look upon human existence as raw material to be
worked up in courts of justice.
“The world doesn’t look much older than it did yesterday,
Henry/f observed Winnie, thoughtfully; “yet it’s sixty~three, and
yesterday it was only sixty-two.”
Henry did not reply, but looked reﬂectively at the frozen land-
scape and clouded sky, whence the sun had been shining half an
hour before. There was a vague misgiving within him; Garrett's
hints ﬂung a shroud of dark conjecture over the Lee tragedy, which
he had forgotten for the moment. The world did look older to
him, and it seemed a whole year since yesterday. But the ,pond
was soon reached, and the children’s skates and his own had to be
ﬁtted on at the expense of freezing ﬁngers and stagnant blood,
which a few turns in the biting air set right again. Then the Gar—
rett ladies appeared, and there was quite a little party on the ice,
and, the children having by this time learnt to go alone, Henry in-
dulged himself in some artistic skating, and the world grew young
again, and he did not observe that Miss Garrett and her sister de-
clined all his offers of assistance, and avoided him as much as the
small extent of the little lake would permit.
“I am not sure that I shall marry Ingram Swaynestoue, after
all,” Winnie observed to Lilian, when she arrived with the promised
cake in an hour’s time. “ I think pw’aps I shall have Henwy when
I gwow up.”
“ There was nobody in the world like Ingram yesterday," Lilian
laughed; “so I suppose your skating instructions have been more
successful than his, Henry.”
“This is rather a dismal New Year’s morning,” Lilian said to
Henry, who was busily engaged in ﬁtting on her skates. “Those

poor Lees haunt me, and the servants say there are such dreadful
surmises about Ben’s death. I wish Cyril were here. I wonder
what he is doing? ”
Cyril at that moment was in the library at Woodlands, comfort- ‘
ably seated in a deep arm-chair by a blazing ﬁre. The laity of the
male kind were shooting; Marion and her sister, Mrs. Whiteford,
were busily employed with the other ladies in decorations and ar-
rangements for the impending ball. Cyril had taken refuge in the
library with a book that he was utterly unable to read, and was
sorry to ﬁnd that George Everard had followed his example.
The Rev. George had assumed that attitude on the hearth-rug
which means conversation, and the disposition of his coat-tails was
such as forebodes a long discourse, as Cyril observed with inward
groans. Cyril’s face was strained and haggard; his mind was in p
the tense, over-wrought condition which craves solitude and repose;
and he racked his brains for some pretext to escape from- his
brother clergyman, who had the advantage of being his senior by
many years, and whose theology was of a kind to ﬁll Cyril with
despair, since George belonged to the straitest sect of the Evan-
gelicals. ‘
Mr. Everard began by commenting upon his young brother’s
worn appearance, and accusing him of fasting.
“I tasted,” replied Cyril, “because I was too unwell to eat.
And, if I received the New Year with watching and prayer, you
will surely allow that I might have done worse.”
“Truly. I could wish many to follow your example, Maitland;
but not to the injury of this ﬂeshly tabernacle, as I fear your have
done. Such misdirected zeal amounts to excess, and that will-wor-
ship against which we are cautioned. You played a very poor part
at breakfast, I observed.” '
Cyril smiled, for he had observed, on his part, George Everard’s
vigorous onslaught upon his father’s well-spread breakfast-table,
and he replied that his lack of appetite was due to his own folly in
taking a long walk fasting after a day of headache. “ Indeed, I am
thoroughly knocked up,” he added wearily.
“My dear young friend,” continued George, solemnly, “I have
become deeply interested in you. I perceive that you are a very
precious vessel."
In spite of his weariness, and the strange hunted look that made
him appear to start at every sound as if expecting evil tidings,

.THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 129
Cyril’s face kindled and gained an added charm at these words.
Appreciation was the very breath of life to him, and he felt that he
had hitherto thought too slightingly of George, who perhaps, after
all, could not help being evangelical, and consequently rather slangy
in his religious conversation. He made a graceful allusion to their
impending relationship, thanked George for his good opinion, and
expressed a hope that they might know more of each other before
long.
“I have wrestled in prayer for you,” continued the elder priest.
“ I shall continue to wrestle, that you may come to know the truth,
and that you may have strength to resist the seductions of the Scar-
let Woman. I observe great powers in you—singular powers;
powers that may elfect much in the vineyard, if you only devote
them to your Master’s service; powers which, unsanctiﬁed, will
I lead you into great temptations.”
“I am in for it,” thought Cyril, who disliked listening to other
people’s sermons as much as doctors object to taking their own
prescriptions; “he is wound up for at least six heads.” But his
face wore the most winning expression of interest and the deference
due to one so much older in the ministry than himself, while he
replied modestly that he was aware that some talents had been
vouchsafed him, and did not intend to hide them in a napkin, but
that he thought perhaps his dear brother rated him too highly in
the kindness of his heart.
At which Everard smiled paternally, and proceeded to speak of
_ Cyril’s gifts—his agreeable manner and power of winning hearts,
his eloquence, his intellectual polish, and his musical and ﬂexible
voice, and pointed out to him the peculiar power these would give
him in his ministerial capacity.
~ “ Not that these mere carnal gifts are anything in themselves,”
be continued; “ they are but nets to catch men. The nets are not
necessary, but it pleases the Lord to work by means, and those to
whom much is given will have much to answer for. In short, you
have very singular opportunities‘of doing good work in the vine-
yard. I am thankful that you have been moved to enter the minis-
try. You might have had a more brilliant career in a worldly call-
ing. But what you have undertaken is worth any sacriﬁce. And no
man, having once put his hand to the plow, may dare to look back."
George Everard was not destitute of the human weakness that
leads us to believe in the value of our own good advice, but he
9

would have been rather startled if he could have known the power-
tul effect his words had upon his susceptible and impulsive listener’s
mind.
“I have put my hands to the plow,” said Cyril, taking away the
hands in which he had buried his haggard face during this exordium,
and speaking in those deep, strong chest-notes which so stirred the
ﬁber of his listeners’ hearts; “I will never turn back. I call you
to witness, George Everard, in the face of high Heaven, that I will
never turn back, and that I will make any and every sacriﬁce for
the sake of this my high calling and vocation.”
Cyril rose from his seat as he spoke, and raised one hand with
an impressive gesture. All the languor and dejection vanished from
his face and form; a dazzle of pale blue ﬁre came from his eyes;
his every feature kindled; his whole being expressed an intensity
of feeling that almost frightened Everard, who felt something like
a child playing with matches and suddenly kindling a wood-pile.
He could only ejaculate faintly, “ My dear young friend! ” while
Cyril paced the room with ﬁrm strides and loftin erect head, a
thing of grace and spirit-like beauty, and at last paused in front of
George with such a glance of ﬁre as seemed to pierce through and
through the soul of the elder man, and offered him his hand, saying,
“ Do you hear me witness?”
“ I do indeed,” faltered the other, overcome by the sight of an
emotion beyond his conception, accustomed though he was to a
purely sentimental form of religion; and be pressed Cyril’s fevered
hand in his own cool one, uttering some words of prayer and bless-
ing, thinking that possibly one of the sudden conversions he so con-
stantly preached about, and so rarely discovered any traces of in
actual life, had taken place.
“Your words,” said Cyril, quietly, after a time, “ were like a
spark to a train of gunpowder. They came at a moment of internal
wrestling, and helped me to a decision."
George Everard replied that he was blest in being the unworthy
instrument of speaking a word in season, and proceeded to admon~
ish his convert at length ; while Cyril, with all the ﬁre quenched in
his look and bearing, sat drooping and haggard beneath the cold,
unimpassioned gaze of his counselor, busicd with his own thoughts,
and occasionally smiling a little inward smile as the well-worn
phrases and various allusions to the Scarlet Woman fell on his
wearied ear.

“In conclusion, dear Cyril," George said at length, “I must bid
you beware of women.” .
Cyril started and ﬂushed, but Everard smiled and continued—-
“Do not mistake me. You have hitherto had no temptation
from that source; the monastic discipline of your life at St. Chad‘s,
however mistaken, has at least that advantage. But; my dear
, brother, you will ﬁnd the weaker vessels 8 stumbling-block and a
constant thorn in the ﬂesh of the Christian pastor. Our sisters
have a fatal habit of mixing personal with religious feeling.”
Here he sighed deeply, and Cyril suddenly remembered a legend
to the eﬁect that the Rev. George, in his curate days, possessed a
large cupboard full of unworn slippers worked by the faithful sisters
of his ﬂock. “ Thinking that they love the manna furnished them
by the faithful shepherd, they too often, and perhaps unconsciously,
cherish a tenderness for the shepherd himself, and this leads to
much that does not conduce to edifying. Such feelings are indeed
harmless; but, though all things are lawful unto me, all things are
not expedient, especially,” he added, with unguarded conﬁdence,
“ when one’s wife is inclined to be jeal— Well, you know, a
young pastor should be prepared. And let no man be too sure of
himself. Our poor sisters constantly want spiritual advice; let
them seek it of an aged pastor. I would counsel you, whose man»
ners and appearance are so strikingly calculated to impress weaker
vessels with admiration, to conﬁne your personal ministrations to
men and elder sisters. You will be run after as a popular preacher,
and women will be a snare to you, as tending to bring discredit on
your calling, and giving occasion to the enemy to blaspheme. The
Christian pastor must not only abstain from all evil, but from all
appearance of evil—nay, the remotest suspicion of it. Our light
has to shine strongly before men.” '
“I feel that most keenly,” replied Cyril, roused to interest. “I
'feel that the lightest imputation upon us is absolutely fatal to our
inﬂuence; that we are bound to a far stricter life than others. By
the way, Everard, a very difﬁcult case of conscience was submitted
to our rector some years ago. There was a man doing good work
in a parish consisting mainly of cultured and wealthy people, a man
who had great personal inﬂuence. That man in early youth had
done a wrong, which he bitterly repented, to atone for which he
would have given years of his life—perhaps even life itself. A
girl ”-—Cyril paused, and a thick, sobbing sigh caught his breath

and impeded his utterance—“ a girl had been, alas! led astray. She
died by her own hand. Years after, when the penitent was in the
height of his usefulness, a man who had loved this girl found him
out, and attempted to avenge the unhappy girl’s death by killing
him. He attacked him in a lonely spot, on a ledge of narrow cliff."
Cyril paused again, and moistened his parched lips, passing his
handkerchief over his damp, chill forehead at the same time.
“There was a struggle for life—no violence on the priest‘s part;
only the instinctive struggle for self-preservation—nnd the would-be
assassin was hurled over the cliff to his death.” Cyril paused once
more, and caught his breath chokingly. “ No suspicion was
aroused; the verdict was accidental death. The clergyman gave no
evidence. He went on his usual way, and no one ever guessed that
his hand—the hand which gave the sacred elemental—had sent a
fellow-creature to his grave. The question which concerned our
rector was, whether the unintentional homicide ought to have vol-
unteered his evidence, and confessed his involuntary share in the
poor creature’s death. You see,” continued Cyril, suddenly lifting
his face to his listener, “he must have brought up the old scandal
it“ he had done so, and that, coupled with the mystery about the
death, would have utterly ruined his career as a Christian pas-
tor.”
“True,” replied George, thoughtfully studying the intricacies of
the Turkey carpet. “ How did your rector obtain possession of
these facts? "
“ The poor fellow conﬁded in him—came to him for advice in
his trouble."
“And what was the advice? ”
“It was never given. Agitation of mind brought on severe
illness, which proved fatal. The rector found it difﬁcult to arrive
at any decision. What do you think? ”
“ Truly, my dear young friend, the case is perplexing. Had the
question been referred to me, I should certainly have made it a mat-
ter of earnest prayer. As a mere abstract question, I feel inclined
to favor the erring pastor’s course of action. A revelation of the
truth would doubtless have given great occasion to the enemy to
blaspheme.”
Cyril heaved a sigh of relief. “Very true,” he replied, sinking
back into the depths of his easy-chair, whence he quickly started in
nervous tremor as the door suddenly opened, and glanced appre-

hensively round, to see nothing more terrible than the bright face
and light ﬁgure of Marion.
“Ohl here you are, you bad boys, looking as grave as two
owls,” she said, in her light, delicate treble. “George, your wife
wants you in the drawing-room at once.”
The obedient husband rose immediately, but paused lingerineg
at the door. “We will discuss the matter further,” he said.
“ Cyril and I have been having the most interesting conversation,
Marion. I have passed a refreshing morning with him. We have
more in common than I supposed.”
And with an indulgent tap of his young sister’s cheek, George
vanished, and left the lovers alone, Marion charmed to ﬁnd such
harmony established between the two ecclesiastics, who bid fair at
one time to differ as only those of the same creed under slightly
varying aspects can diﬁer. ,
“Isn’t it provoking, Cyril?” she cried. “Here is a telegram
from Leslie, to say he can not spare time to come to-night, and his
regiment does not embark till the third. If any one wants to wish
him good-by, they can run over to Portsmouth-to-morrow. I dare
say, indeed! The other oﬂicers are coming; but we shall be short
of men, I fear.”
‘ “ Is that all? " returned Cyril, with a sigh of relief; for
he had turned pale and shuddered at the sight of his telegram.
“Well, dearest, let us run over with your father and Keppel to-
morrow, and wish them all good- by at once. I rather envy
the admiral going on,tbe Mediterranean station at this murky
season.”
“You poor boy! ” exclaimed Marion, placing her hand upon his
Iburning brow ; “you look as if you needed some kind of a change.
I am afraid your head is still aching.”
“ It is maddening,” returned Cyril, detaining the caressing hand.
“ To tell the truth, I am very unwell. I ought not to have walked
this morning."
“Indeed you ought not. I saw that you were quite lame from
fatigue.”
.“And who is to blame for my walk?” returned Cyril, with
forced gaiety; “who but Miss Everard? I suppose I caught cold
in Long’s gig yesterday afternoon. I had no overcoat, meaning to
walk. I feel as if I had been beaten all over.”
“Poor dear! " said Marion, tenderly. “And you actually have

a little bruise ‘here over the temple,” she added, touching the place,
which was tender even to her velvet touch.
“ Oh, that’s nothing! ” Cyril replied hastily; but he rose and
approached a small mirror, into which he gazed apprehensively.
“Ah yes, I dressed in a hurry, and hit myself with a hair-brush.
And tliis,{’ he added, pointing to a strip of plaster on his chin, “I
did in shaving."
“What can we do for you?” asked Marion. “I was going to
ask you to carry some plants from the conservatory, but you must
not.” ‘
“Come and sit by me, dear,” Cyril replied, in his gracefully
autocratic manner; “there is no anodyne like your presence.”
So the lovers remained hand-in-haud by the library ﬁre a good
hour, Marion’s bright eyes and caressing tones worshiping Cyril,
who appreciated nothing so much as incense.
George Everard, in the mean time, was telling his wife what un-
expected graces' he had discovered in his future brother-in-law.
“A very precious soul,” he said. “He only needs Christian inﬂu-
ence.” "
Mrs. Everard knew well that, according to the usage of her hus-
band’s tribe, the word Christian was not applicable to either of the
Maitlands.
CHAPTER XIII. -
Wmm the little skating-party reached the Rectory, Mr. Mait-
land had not returned from his errand of charity, nor did he appear
when luncheon was served. The meal was delayed half an hour,'
and then took place without him. Mrs. Maitland was depressed at
the melancholy opening of the New Year, and Henry had devoted
himself to the task of cheering and amusing her.
He read to her for a good hour before luncheon, while Lilian
wrote notes, and the children, tired with the morning’s exercise,
buried themselves in books of their own. “The Prisoner of Chil-
lon,” for which Mrs. Maitland had an amiable weakness, formed
part of the reading, and Henry was rewarded for his rendering of
it by the following observation from Lennie, who had not appeared
to be listening :-“ You should hear Cywil read that, Henry I You

can’t hold a candle to him.” Whereupon Everard,‘in revenge, took
him up by the waistband with one hand, and carried him out into
the hall, where he tuck him up in a niche intended for a lamp, and
whence Lennie had an uninterrupted view through the hall window
and down the village street. .
“ Oh, I say,” he cried, “look at all those policemen! ” and
Henry, looking out, saw a couple of blue-coated constables standing
chattering with the villagers, one group just outside the Rectory
gate. >
“Don‘t say anything about it before your mother, Lennie,” he
said, lifting the boy down from his perch. “They are making in-
quiries about Ben Lee, that’s all.”
They were ﬁnishing their meal, when Mr. Maitland's step was ,
heard in the hall, and Lilian went out to meet him. To all her in-
quiries, he said that he wished to be alone for a little, and desired
that wine and food might be sent to the study for him.
“ He is a good deal upset, no doubt,” commented Mrs. Maitland.
“I sometimes think, Lilian, that your father is too sensitive for a
parish priest.”
“What would he be as a doctor, Mrs. Maitland? ” Everard
asked, laughing. ,
“ Oh, Henry, we all know that only exceptionally hard hearts can
endure that profession,” she replied, to the indignation of Winnie,
who maintained that the medical profession induced a particular
tenderness of heart, as was manifested by the specimen they had in
Henry,
They were about to leave the dining-room, when Eliza, in a
great state of ﬂutter, appeared to say that Mr. Maitland wished to
see Dr. Everard in his study, whither Everard repaired with a dim
sense of impending disaster. It was not an auspicious moment for
speaking of his engagement to Lilian, and yet he felt that the m0-
mentous question was about to be decided. Could it be that Mr.
Maitland had gathered some hints of his relations with her, and
wished to put an end to it at once? Or, was he merely giving him
an opportunity of declaring his intentions?
As Everard crossed the hall, Snip and Snap ran growling before
him, and barked at an unseen ﬁgure standing outside the door.
Mark Antony also ran out with a suspicious look and angry eyes;
but Everard was too full of his own reﬂections to observe the ani-
mals. He vvhistied slightly to put himself at ease, and was ashamed

to feel his heart beating like a girl’s as he paused. to open the study
door. He entered, closing it behind him.
Mr. Maitland was standing on the hearth-rug with his back to
him. Above the mantel-piece was a ﬁne engraving of De la Roche's
picture of the Agony of Gethsemane, a picture forever afterward
associated in Everard’s mind with that solemn moment in his life.
The kneeling ﬁgure, awful in suffering, trembling before an anguish
beyond human strength to endure, touched him with a new signiﬁ-
cance; the cup which human nature dared not grasp, but which
divine love resolved to drain to the lees, suddenly, he knew not how,
symbolized his life; the terrible struggle between spirit and ﬂesh
became his. All in one ﬂash these feelings passed through him, for,
as soon as the door closed behind him, Mr. Maitland turned and
looked at him.
“ What is it i ” cried Henry, in a low, choked tones.
Ten years had apparently been added to the gentle prit st‘s age,
and his haggard and careworn air emphasized his likeness to Cyril.
But it was the look in his eyes which sent all the blood rushing
thickly to Everard's heart, such a look of ﬁery anger and indigna-
tion as seemed utterly inconsistent with his kindly aﬁ‘ectionate na-
ture, a hurt look, a look of unendurable anguish. Once before, and
only once, Henry had seen that look, and now all the years rolled
back, and he saw the painful scene it recalled with vivid intensity.
It was the only time Mr. Maitland had ever thrashed Cyril, an epoch
in the children’s lives.
Some choice fruit had been set aside for a dying parishioner,
who chanced to have been Ben Lee’s ﬁrst wife, and Cyril, not
knowing it was intended for any special purpose, and being un-
luckily alone in the dining~room with it, had yielded to a tempta-
tion he never could resist, and had eaten ﬁrst one cool juicy fruit,
and then another, until the dish was empty. In a boy of ten it was
not a grave fault, and, remorse having seized the child just as the
last peach vanished, he made up his mind to go and confess, and
receive some light punishment or perhaps only a rebuke. But just
then inquiry was made for the missing fruit, its intended destina-
tion was announced in his hearing, and both father and mother
were much annoyed at its disappearance.
All the household was interrogated, and expressed ignorance of
the matter; and, a servant having called attention to Cyril’s prox-
imity to the temptation, he was specially quesiioned, but denied in

the calmest way having even seen such a thing as a nectarine.
Later, when the mysterious disappearance was being discussed, Oy- ‘
ril expressed virtuous indignation against the greedy thief, and at
the same moment taking out his handkerchief, he let fall a peach-
stone, and on being searched a whole handful of fruit-stones was
discovered in his pocket.
It was then that Everard saw that ﬁery look in Mr. Maitlaud’s
kindly eyes. He well remembered listening with tlre"Sobbing Lilian
in the hall, and hearing the rod in its unsparing descent on the cul-
prit’s back and the pale anguish of Cyril’s face when he left the
study, shamed and tearless, to throw himself into Lilian’s arms, and
tell her that he wished he had never been born. Later in the even-
ing, he found the children crouched together in each other’s arms,
crying; and then Oyril told them how he had lied from fear, not
so much of punishment as of the public disgrace of having robbed
the sick. He never could endure to be thought ill of. And now
Henry saw the same look of agony and anger in Mr. Maitland’s face,
and could only ask, “ What is it? ”
“ Henry," the old man replied, in those fuller tones which re—
sembled Cyril’s, and which nothing but intense feeling could pro-
duce in him, “I have loved you as a son.”
“Sir,” replied Henry, “you have always treated me as one.
This house has been my home.” _
“I have been proud of you, Henry; I have valued your intellect
and respected your moral worth.”
A terrible foreboding of what was coming shot through Ever-
ard‘s brain. He sank into a chair, and turned white to the lips.
Mr. Maitland remained standing, with the same dreadful gaze ﬁxed
upon Henry, and the sublime sorrow of Gethsemane pictured above
his head.
“You must know what I have to say to you,” he continued.
“ Do not, I beseech you, do not pain me by obliging me to tell you
in so many words.”
“ 1 do not know what you have to say to me,” replied Everard,
in a faint voice.
“ You lie! ” cried Mr. Maitland.
“ Sir! ” exclaimed Everard, starting to his feet.
“ That you should bring disgrace upon the roof which sheltered
you! ” continued Mr. Maitland, looking in his passion more and
more like Cyril.

“Sir,” said Henry, with cold, hurt pride, “ you presume upon
your privilege as an older man and a clergyman. You have no
right to insult me in this unwarrantable manner. I will try not to
forget that you have been a father to me, when my own father was
unable to see much of me, and that Mrs. Maitland— I had no
mother—”
“ Thank God for that! ” remarked Mr. Maitland. “ Oh, Henry,
what awful hypocrisy is yours! When I think of all you said about
that unhappy girl! When I remember the wrong we all, even his
own father, did to Ingram Swaynestone l ”
“ What can you mean? ” ejaculated Henry, turning red and then
white.
“ Your own conscience must supply the answer, Henry. You
know how you passed yesterday afternoon; you know that you re-
turned with red hands and a bruised face to my table, to my hearth.
You may yet, if you care to escape by the kitchen door, elude the
vigilance of the police. But I do not advise you to do so. I ad-
vise you to surrender as quietly as possible. and I ask you, for the
sake of ancient kindness between us, to bring as little scandal on
this roof as possible. I will go to your poor father myself, and
break the matter to him as soon as you are gone. In the mean
time, the police—"
Henry burst into a laugh—a loud, harsh, dreadful laugh, that
penetrated into the drawing-room, and startled Lilian and her
mother. “The police! " he cried; “ what have they to do with
me i "
“They bring a warrant to arrest you on the charge of willful
murder."
“This is nonsense! ” cried Henry. “Mr. Maitland, you can not
take the matter seriously; you must know that there is some absurd
mistake." '
“God help us all!" he replied, bursting into tears, “I wish I
did! But the evidence against you is too clear."
Henry sat down once more, and tried to collect his startled
thoughts, and resist the strange certainty which possessed him that
the knell of his life was already tolling. He lifted his eyes involun-
tarily, and once more they rested upon the agony which was beyond
even sinless human strength. In his own frame he felt the strong
shudder which convulses the kneeling ﬁgure before the terrible,
inevitable cup; 9. deep and solemn calm came upon him, and he

began to think more clearly, while the ﬁerce resentment that Mr.
Maitland‘s unjust suspicion kindled in him died away into pain.
“ You will break it gently to my father? ” he said quietly, after
a pause. “ Tell him it is a mistake, which a few words 'will prob-
ably set right."
“Your poor father! And Cyril, my poor Cyril; it will be a
cruel blow to him I ”
“I hope that—Lilian—and Mrs. Maitland—I trust they know
nothing of this? If they could in any way be prevented from
knowing the object of these meh’s presence,” continued Henry,
when he was interrupted by a knock at the door.
It was Eliza, with the inspector and two policemen behind her.
“ Come in,” said Everard; and they entered and formally ar-
rested him.
“ And the quieter you go the better, sir,” observed the inspector.
“The ﬂy is waiting just outside the gate in the road.”
“ Must I go through the hall? ” asked Everard.
“I fear there is no other course,” returned Mr. Maitland.
“I will just go and account for my sudden departure to the
ladies," said Everard; but the inspector, who had taken certain
steel implements from his pocket, while one of the men stood
before the door, here informed him that he could not go (without
his escort and those same glittering ornaments, which he proceeded
to adjust to Henry’s wrists with the dexterity of long practice.
‘Like one in a dream, Henry submitted to this ignominy, and
saw Mr. Maitland step across the hall and carefully close the draw-
ing-room door, while Eliza fetched his hat and coat; and thus,
without any farewell, he walked out of the familiar doors, observ-
ing as he went the three troubled pets, the dogs giving vent to
occasional reproachful growls, and the cat stalking uneasily about,
and uttering a plaintive mew as he passed him ; and he felt the unac-
customed touch of steel on his wrists, and half wondered at the
strange proximity of the policemen on either side of him. As he
stepped out on the graveled drive, he was startled to see a little
‘ ﬁgure with a white face spring forward and leap to his arms. It
was poor little Winnie. He bent down and kissed her.
“ Don‘t be frightened, darling; I shall soon be back. It is only
a mistake,” he said, touched by this incident, and Mark Antony’s
sympathetic mew; “ tell Lilian it is a mistake.”
He could see Lilian through the side of the bay-window of the

drawing-room. Her face was turned from him, and she was tran-
quilly reading the morning paper, which did not reach sequestered
Melbourne till that late hour; nevertheless, he was glad when he
was outside the gate, and safely hidden from her sight in the ﬂy.
The village was full of life; the whole population had apparently
turned out, open-mouthed and interjectional, to see and discuss the
extraordinary proceeding. On a little patch of green Everard saw
Lennie, with his jacket off, engaged in ﬁghting with Dickie Stevens,
who was apparently getting the worst of it, and was, indeed, ﬁnally
vanquished after a severe battle. The unlucky Dickie had alluded
in plain and unvarnished terms to the end which probably awaited
Dr. Everard in consequence of his imputed crime; hence the battle.
The forge was blazing away, but the clink of the hammer was
unheard. Strauu had left his iron half-shaped on the anvil, and
stood outside, bare-armed and grimy, ready to pull oﬂ" his brown-
paper cap when the ﬂy passed; and Granfer leaned against the sill
of the opened window, with a countenance expressive of the deep-
est wisdom, and shook his head ominously. It was not for a man
of his knowledge and sagacity to betray surprise; he had evidently
foreseen and predicted the event, and knew more about its probable
termination than it was prudent to reveal. The usual village parlia-
ment was grouped around him, with its hands chieﬂy in its pockets,
and its countenance distraught; but no cap was lifted when the ﬂy
passed save Straun's. That and a courtesy from a little girl, and a
slow and solemn salute from Tom Hale, who was drawn up at the
corner of the wheelwright’s yard with a stiffness and precision
which suggested the presence of the whole British army, alone
greeted the fallen man. ~
The news of Lee’s death did not reach Woodlands till the after-
noon, when it was bruited about among the servants, one of whom
had caught various strange rumors in Oldport. It ﬂoated up to the
drawing-room, where it aroused but a tepid interest, save in Marion.
Cyril agreed with her that it was very sad and shocking, but
expressed little surprise, or, indeed, interest.
He was very restless, and, as the afternoon wore on, left Marion,
and wandered aimlessly about, in spite of the fatigue and illness of
which he complained. Every sound startled him, and he kept look-
ing expectantly toward the gates, till about four o’clock, when
the, noise of wheels caught his tense hearing, and he saw his
father drive up to the door in the little pony-chaise. He made one

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 141
step forward to meet him, and then he went back, and passing
behind some laurels, which eli‘ectnally screened him, went toward
the back of the house, and paced up and down on a terrace, which
commanded a view of the gray sea, turning his head constantly
toward the house, whence he expected a summons.
Some ten minutes passed, and no one sought him. To Cyril it
was an eternity. His nervous agitation became unbearable; he
was consumed with inward fever. Nothing was heard in the chill
winter afternoon, save the heavy boom of the groundswell, which
ﬁlled all the air with a sullen, steady roar, a roar which confused
Cyril’s senses with its unceasing thunder, and seemed full of menace
to him. The sea, which was about half a mile from the grounds, .
was coldly gray, and looked, with its calm breadth of unruﬁled sur-
face, like a sheet of steel. The sky also was steely gray, save in
the west, where‘the departed sun had left some pearl and opal
gleam in the cloud-rifts; there was no wind, and the frost still held.
Cyril bared his hot forehead to the still winter air, and some broken
words of prayer escaped him.
“I would have atoned,” he murmured—“ I would have atoned
at any price, but it was not possible; the wrong is irreparable.
Take Thou the will and the broken heart of contrition.”
Then some sound smote upon his hearing above the august thun-
der of the unquiet sea, and be replaced his hat and turned toward
the house. But no one came forth, and the sea went on booming
heavily as before, only, to Cyril’s vexed spirit, it seemed that its
hoarse roar rose to a deafening intensity, likeithe trouble in his
breast.
“ If it were but over! ” he murmured. “I cannot endure this
suspense; ” and he turned half staggering and entered the conserve
story, where he was still alone. He felt very ill, and wondered
if some deadly sickness were about to fall on him. Body and mind
alike seemed failing under the heavy burden he bore. He leant his
elbows on the bench and supported his head on his hands, gazing
through some bright ﬂowers out on the pitiless sea, and sighed out
that he could not bear it, that he wished all were over, and himself
at rest from the dreadful stress of life.
A sharp pruning-knife lay near him; his eye rested longineg
upon it, and he thought how easily it would still the terrible tumult
within. No pain; only a pin-prick, as it were—he knew exactly
where to strike; Everard showed him one day when they Were dis-

cussing the subject—then, a bright, warm jet of blood; a growing
languor, deepening into an eternal sleep. lle put forth his hand
and touched the knife, even felt its edge, and then dropped it with
a shudder, and betook himself to prayer. And in his prayer he
vowed a passionate vow, were he once delivered from this impend-
ing terror, to consecrate his life anew to his great and sacred calling,
and to devote body, soul, and spirit with unsparing vigor to that
one supreme cause. Calm fell upon him then, and he heard the
footsteps of the approaching messenger with a serene face. It was
only a servant, with a quiet, everyday countenance.
“ The admiral wishes to see you in the library at once, sir," he
said.
The admiral! Cyril turned sick. Why not his own father?
Was it so bad as that? He walked, however, quietly through the
darkening house, and entered the well-known door of the library
with a calm face. A servant had just placed a lamp on a table be~
fore the ﬁre, the ruddy blaze of which danced over the room with
fantastic cheerfulness. George and Keppel were standing on the
hearth-rug, asking each other what had happened. Their presence
steadied Cyril, and conveyed a vague comfort to him.
“I say, Cyril,” observed Keppel, in his strong, cheery voice,
“ there’s a row of some kind ; all hands piped. What the deuce is
your governor up to? ”
The door of an inner room, the admiral’s special sanctuary,
opened, and he came forth, acompanied by Mr. Mnitland, who was
too troubled to exchange any greeting with the young men.
“Well, my lads,” said the admiral, standing with his back to
the ﬁreplace. and plunging at once into the subject, “here’s the
devil to pay. Maitland says that Swaynestone’s coachman was
murdered last night—” .
“Murdered!” cried Cyril, springing from the chair into which
he had dropped his weary, aching frame.
“ Murdered l ” echoed George and Koppel, in varying degrees of
horror.
“My dear Everard,” interposed Mr. Maitland, “you are so pre-
cipitate. Spare the young men ; break it gently.”
“ Gently! By George, Maitland, murder is murder, and a
damned ugly thing, however you break it!” retorted the honest
admiral, who had by no means enjoyed Mr. Maitland’s kind endeav—
ors to break it gently. “ The women will have to be told; some-

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAIVD. 143
body had better break it to them,” he added, passing his hand
thoughtfully over his fresh-colored, weather-beaten face, while Cyril
shuddered with a sick apprehension. “It’s no use beating about
the bush, lads,” he continued, in his impetuous manner; “the long
and the short of it is, Henry is arrested for murder.”
“Henry l ” cried the three. “By Jove! ” added Keppel; " My
dear father ! ” added George; while Cyril burst into a hysteric laugh.
‘“ Nonsense! the thing is impossible, absurd, ridiculous. What ass ,
arrested him?” he burst out.
“Stand by, Cyril. You side with your friend, of course. Hear
the rest. Tell them, Maitland,” expostulated the admiral.
“Do you mean to say, sir, that you think him guilty? ” asked
Keppel, ﬁercely.
“ My dear Keppel,” returned Mr. Maitland. “I would give the
remainder of my life not to believe it. I have passed the whole
morning with Sir Lionel, and I have heard such evidence as places
it beyond a doubt.”
Keppel swore steadily and intensely for some seconds, while
George quoted Scripture at the same rate. Mr. Maitland thought
that of the two he preferred Keppel’s observations. Cyril dropped
into an arm-chair, and his head sunk upon his breast.
“Steady, lad, steady! " exclaimed the admiral, approaching him.
“We must stand to our guns.”
“Brandy,” murmured Cyril, faintly.
“He has been ill,” said Mr. Maitlsnd, apologizing for his son’s
weakness; while the admiral plunged into his sanctuary, and issued
thence hearing some excellent rum in a little glass, and poured it
into Cyril’s white lips. '
“ What the deuce did you mean by swearing before the clergy,
Keppel?” he asked, while doing this kind ofﬁce.
“I am unwell; I have a heavy cold,” gasped Cyril, reviving.
“It is nonsense about Henry. Where is he? ”
“ We must bail him at once,” said Keppel, when he heard that
his brother was actually in custody at that moment; but Mr. Mait-
land reminded him that this course was impossible, while George
groaned and observed parenthetically that Henry needed a fall to
bring him to a serious state of mind.
“ Serious! ” echoed the admiral. “ You may depend upon it,
the poor beggar feels serious enough. Well, he was the only boy
I never ﬂogged of you all. He was such a little chap when his poor

mother— Damnation, George! if you spare the rod you spoil the
child! ” cried the poor man, turning aside to dash a couple of tears
from his eyes, ‘* The Bible tells you that.”
“ True, most true,” returned George, conscious of having received
a Benjamin’s portion of the paternal rod.
“The question is, what is to be done? ” said the practical Kep-
pel, who was pacing the library with a wide balance of limb, as if
the carpet were liable to rise in waves and upset him.
“Exactly,” returned the admiral, with an air of relief. “How
can we get him out of this hole, Maitlandi We must spend all
we’ve got to get him off and save the family honor. What’s the ‘
ﬁrst step? To London for a lawyer? And 1 Bail 011 the third, and
so does Keppel; and then Leslie is oﬁ‘ to India. By Jove! it‘s the
devil’s own luck; nobody but a person left to look after the family,
and I put George into the Church—meaning no disrespect, gentle-
men—because he was the fool of the family.”
“It is too ridiculous to take this seriously,” said Cyril. “The
inquest will, of course, set Henry free. He will prove an alibi, or
these thick-headed rustics will have suﬂicent sense to bring in a
verdict of accidental death. What more probable than that Lee—
in trouble, and probably a little tipsy—should slip in a wood on a
dark night and fall heavily? ”
“But,” replied Mr. Maitland, who did not remember that Cyril _
could have heard nothing about a wood, “ a man can not drag him-
self for yards into the underwood after receiving a mortal blow on
the head.”
“ Who says he was dragged?” asked Cyril, quickly.
“There are the marks on the frosted moss and grass. 1 saw
them myself,” said his father; and he went on to place further
evidence before them, while Cyril listened with a beating heart and
gathering dread.
“Good heavens! ” he cried at last, “ don’t you all see that it is
morally impossible for a man of Henry’s character to commit such
a crime? Even if Lee were killed, Henry had no hand in it.”
“ Henry is as honest a fellow as ever stepped, Cyril," said Kep-
pel; “but, you see, women are the very deuce. The best of men
may be led on to anything, once he gets hung up in an aﬁ'air of that
kind.”
“ An excuse as old as Adam’s iniquity,” sighed Mr. Mait-
land.

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN AIAITLAND. , 145
“ Henry had nothing to do with that miserable business,” cried
Cyril; “I would stake my life on it.”
“Stand up for your friend, my lad,” said the admiral. “He
would be a doctor; and I won’t deny that a surgeon is useful after
a general engagement; but then, he would not even enter the serv-
ice. Doctoring is bad for the morals; all this poking and prying
into dead bodies is an infernal business not ﬁt for a gentleman.
Those very clever doctors are a bad lot, most of them in league with
the devil. George said in his last sermon that the Almighty sends
sickness as a punishment for sin, and it is a clear ﬂying in the face
of Providence to make people healthy.”
“My dear father! " remonstrated' George, who was not pre-
pared for such an application of his sermon, ﬂattering though it
were.
“ Yes, yes, you said so in the pulpit, and you are not in the pul~
pit now,” proceeded the admiral, with a ﬁne distinction between
the preacher and the man. “Now for action, lads. When does
this damned thing take place, Maitland? ”
“The inquest will be held to-morrow, admiral; but the verdict
may not be given for some days. In the mean time, we must try to
get all the evidence in Henry‘s favor that we can. Lilian saw him ,
return, but refuses to swear to it. She actually disbelieves the evi-
dence of her senses.”
“Poor Lilian,” murmured Cyril, with a kind of sob.
“ Oh, the women! ” groaned the admiral. “ George, go and
break it; it is person’s work. Poor little Marion! you had better
tackle her, Cyril.”
“A solicitor must be procured to watch the case on Henry’s
behalf at the inquest,” said Mr. Mnitland. “I suppose Weston
would be the man; he is your man of business, I think.”
“Just so,” replied the admiral, instantly ringing the bell to order
a carriage. “ I’ll go at once. By George! I had forgotten the dance.
"Half the county will be here in a couple of hours.”
The consultation was at an end, and the meeting broke up, and
Cyril, with a strange feeling of relief, went to Marion and told her
what had occurred, while George did the same with the other
ladies, who somehow had the tidings conveyed to the people stay
ing in the house. i '
Breaking the news to Marion Was not all pain; in fact, it brought
a wonderful solace to Cyril’s troubled soul. He spent the evening

alone with her, and so exerted himself to convince her of he!
brother’s perfect innocence and probable speedy release, that he
went to bed with a lightened heart, and slept as no one else slept
that night beneath the admiral’s roof, the sleep of exhaustion,
dreamless and perfect as that of an infant.
CHAPTER XIV.
In those days of unutterable amazement, Everard began to doubt
his own identity. On the ﬁrst day of the inquest he received an
affectionate letter from Cyril, treating the aﬁ'air of his imprison-
ment as a mistake, which a brief investigation would speedily clear
up.
Then came the succession of surprises which the inquest brought,
as witness after witness came forward and swore to actions of his
which he had never so much as contemplated in imagination.
After the evidence of those who discovered poor Lee, and that
of the surgeon, Mrs. Lee was the ﬁrst witness. She last saw her
husband alive at dinner-time, after which he left her to return to
the stables, she said. She left the Temple for Melbourne soon after
three, and, on returning through the ﬁelds at about a quarter to ﬁve,
she saw Dr. Everard spring over a hurdle leading into the fatal
copse, and walk hurriedly along toward Melbourne. Although the
, moon was but just risen, she made him out distinctly by his gray suit.
He had no stick in his hand, and, though he passed within half adozen
yards, did not appear to see her, and took no notice of her saluta-
tion. Her husband was a steady and sober man, but had of late
\ been much depressed on account of family troubles; had been
especially vexed at dinner-time, and had eaten little. When asked
what had distressed Lee, she replied that he had some diﬁ'erence
with his daughter, whom he had discovered with Dr. Everard at
midday.
Sir Lionel Swaynestone stated that he had last seen Lee at
eleven in the forenoon; had known him all his life as a sober and
industrious man and good servant.
Judkins described the hour and manner of his ﬁnding Lee‘s
body. He had last seen him alive at three o‘clock, when Lee told

THE SILENCE OF DEAN JIA ITLAND. 147
him that Dr. Everard would be somewhere near the Temple that
afternoon, and that he intended, if possible, to meet him, and
threaten him with exposure unless he consented to repair the wrong
he had done his child. ‘
Everard’s solicitor here interposed to ask the nature of that
wrong, and Lee‘s grounds for suspecting Everard of it, when, to his
own deep amazement as well as Everard’s, he was told that Everard
and Alma had been seen together in the copse by both Lee and
Judkins on the very morning of Lee’s death; and, further, that he,
J udkins, had witnessed several clandestine meetings between them
during Mrs. Lee‘s illness in the spring. In the subsequent trial be-
fore the magistrates, Judkins further witnessed to meetings at speci- '
ﬁed times, and to gifts of ﬂowers exchanged between Everard and
Alma. A book of poems, found in Everard’s room at the Rectory,
was produced, inscribed, “For Alma Lee, with best New Year’s
wishes, from H. E.” J udkins also swore that letters had passed
between them.
The solicitor having asked Judkins if Lee had not threatened
violence toward Everard, he replied that he only threatened to as-
sault the prisoner in case he refused to do justice to his daughter.
J udkins further deposed that, on returning from the downs with
some horses he had been exercising at a little after four on the fatal
afternoon, he had seen the prisoner enter the copse. On being sub-
sequently asked by EVerard how he had missed Mr. Swnynestone,
who was riding toward the downs at the same time, he replied that
he had drawn up for some minutes behind a screen of hazels, while
Mr. Swaynestone was passing in the open. He did not until the
Assize trial add that he did this to watch the meeting of the gray
ﬁgure with Alma.
John N obbs, a stable help, deposed to parting with Lee on the
high-road outside the gate at three o’clock; the witness was start-
ing for ()ldport on foot. Lee walked up the meadow toward his
home. Lee carried no stick, and was quite sober.
Several Swaynestone servants witnessed having seen Lee about
the place before three o’clock; after which hour no one appeared
,to have seen him alive.
Ingram Swaynestone bore witness to Lee‘s character; he saw
him last alive at the stables at two o’clock. At twenty minutes
past four, or thereabouts, Ingram rode across the meadow in which
the Temple stood, at a center, on his way across the downs to Shot~

over, when he saw Everard walking quickly along a hedgerow in
the direction of Temple Oopse. He was dressed in gray, carried a
stick, and made no reply to Swaynestone’s shouted greeting, beyond
a wave of his hand. On returning through Malbourne, at ten min-
utes to ﬁve, Swaynestone again saw Everard walking in the moon'-
light across the ﬁeld, at the corner of which the Malbourne sign-
post stood. He reined in his horse, and called out to him; but
Everard went hurriedly on, not appearing to see or hear him. The
road was some ﬁfty yards from the path Everard was pursuing, and
the ﬁeld was higher than the road.
William Grove had seen Everard at the same place and time.
He expressed wonder to Jim, his mate, that Dr. Everard, at the
sound of the wagon-bells—since he was then returning from Oldport
with his team—and his own “ Good night, doctor,” did not come to
receive a parcel the wagoner was bringing him from Oldport, and
respecting the instant delivery of which he had been most solicitous.
All this Jim Downer corroborated.
Stevens, the sexton, said that about sunset, or later, he was in
the churchyard, and saw a ﬁgure in a gray suit, which he recog-
nized as Dr. Everard’s, leave the hack premises of the Rectory,
and ascend the hill in the direction of Swaynestone. He carried a
stick.
Straun, the blacksmith, on the other hand, swore that he saw
Everard pass through the village street by the forge at that hour,
or a little before. He was uncertain about his clothes, but swore to
the stick.
A Swaynestone keeper saw Everard a little later in a plantatlon
on the upland. He described his gray suit and stick; he was not
near enough to speak to him. A shepherd, cutting turnips in a ﬁeld
near, swore that Everard passed him at four o‘clock, and stopped
a moment to chat with him. He was not sure about his clothes;
thought they were gray. Everard had a stick, also some very good
tobacco, of which he gave him some. He told the shepherd that he
was going across the downs to Widow Dove’s. Dr. Everard won-
dered that two lone women should live up there in the solitary cot-
tage, he said.
Eliza, the parlor-maid, bore witness that Everard was at the
Rectory between three and four; he was in the drawing-room with
her mistress when she showed some visitors in. She saw no more
till about ﬁve, when he entered softly and hurriedly by the back

door, and ran across the back hall in the dusk. Miss Muitland was
leaving the kitchen at that time, and also saw Dr. Everard, whose
ﬁgure was clearly shown by the light issuing from the kitchen.
Miss Maitland called .to him, “Henry, was Mrs. Dove at home?"
but he made no answer, ran up stairs and locked himself in. The
cook also saw Dr. Everard at that hour, and heard Miss Maitland
speak to him. Miss Maitland was rebuking the witness for not
having lighted the hall lamp. Eliza next saw Everard an hour later.
He came into the kitchen with his hand to his face, and asked the
cook for some raw meat to save him from a black eye. Martha,
the house-maid, said, “ Oh, sir, what an eye you will have! ” He
replied, “I hope not; there is nothing like raw meat.” Cook
laughed, and said, “One would think you had been in the wars, sir.
Have you had afall?” He seemed confused, and said, “I don’t
know. At least, I ran up against a tree in the dark.” At dinner
he told Mr. Maitland that he knocked his face against a door, and
made signs to Miss Winnie not to tell. When he came into the
kitchen, Eliza heard him say something to Miss Winnie about not
telling. He seemed excited and confused at dinner. This evidence
of Eliza’s, given brieﬂy at the inquest, only came out in full at the
trial in Oldport Town Hall, when it was corroborated by the other
maids.
Granfer was produced on the second day of the inquiry, and,
with an irrepressible circumlocution which nearly drove the jury
beside themselves, witnessed meeting Henry at the wheelwright’s
corner at ﬁve o’clock; he was inclined to believe that he wore the
fatal gray suit, since he and Straun and several others had seen and
commented on it in the forenoon.
What bewildered Everard most was the e\idence of things
against him. The house-maid witnessed, with tears, to ﬁnding
bloody water in his hand-basin, and seeing the garments hanging to
dry. The suit was produced, and bore other stains, which Henry
had not observed by candle-light. He saw stains of earth, as well
as those darker marks; bits of moss and dead leaves caught in the
rough woolen material: the badly sponged spot he had seen at mid“
day; and, more surprising still, a slight rent at the armhole, as if the
sleeve had been torn in a struggle.
Buried among dead leaves and mess, the police found a hand-
kerchief of Everard’s, bearing the ominous crimson stains. F ar-
ther of, among thick holly-bushes, they found a stick, which the

doctor said might have dealt the fatal blow. Mr. Maitland identiﬁed
the stick—a thick bamboo, with a loaded top—as his property. It
remained usually in the hall, and was used by the family generally.
Everard had taken it in the forenoon on his walk with the twins, as
many people could witness. In Lee’s pocket they found the two
halves of the letter Alma had dropped in the forenoon. It was
written on good note-paper, from the top of which an embossed
heading had been hastily torn, so hastily that some of the end letters
remained thus: ,3? Similar paper was taken from a blotting-case
used chieﬂy by visitors with the full address, “ The Rectory,
Melbourne.” The handwriting, evidently feigned, was afterward
submitted to an expert, and compared with various specimens of
Everard’s writing.
Lee’s watch, purse, etc., were found upon him; and, what puzzled
Everard strangely, a leather bag containing ﬁfty pounds in gold,
which had been stamped upon by a heavy foot, was found on the
hard path some yards from the body. It was impossible to iden-
tify this, as it had no marks, and was one of those commonly used
by bunkers to serve their customers with gold; it Was evidently,
from its dull gray color, an old one. which had passed through many
hands. At the subsequent trial it was suggested that this money,
so carefully arranged to defy identiﬁcation, had been oﬁ'ered to Lee
as the price of his silence, and by him indignantly rejected, and
had been forgotten by the criminal in his agitation after the
deed.
Everard’s own statement was simple enough. He could merely say
that, wearing the clothes in which he then stood, a prisoner, he had
left the Rectory at about sundown—the exact hour he had not
observed—and, passing through the village, where he exchanged a
brief salutation with Straun, who was standing alone outside the
forge, which was closed for the night, had walked through the
ﬁelds as far as the fatal copse. There he had turned off and struck
across the down to the solitary cottage known far and near as Widow
Dove's. He remembered meeting no one save the shepherd, but
had seen a man exercising two horses in the distance when on the
Open down. He was not near enough to recognize the rider, but
concluded that he was a groom from Swuynestone or Northover.
He found the widow’s but empty, with no smoke issuing from
the chimney, and no light in either window, and returned by a dif-
ferent path, which he described, meeting no human being till he

descended into the high-road at Melbourne Cross, and spoke to
Granfer (whose legal designation was Isaac Hale, by the way); he
did not remember what he said at this interview, save that he asked
if Long‘s hell-team had passed. Going on in the dark to Long‘s
farm, which was approached by a by-road at right angles to the
highway, he found a little girl sitting on the doorstep of Grove’s
cottage, which was just outside the farm gate, and learnt from her
that Grove was gone to the Rectory with a parcel.
His return at six, his romp with Winnie, and its consequences,
he described; and, although cautioned that what he said would be
put in evidence against him, deposed to ﬁnding blood on his clothes,
’ and sponging it away, but expressed himself unable to account for
its presence. He had never quarreled with Lee, whom he had
known and respected all his life. He had last seen him alive on
Sunday in church, and had last spoken to him on the previous Sat-
urday. He was too indignant at the imputation respecting Alma
to deny it, but he denied having met her on the 31st, admitting that
he was in the copse at the alleged hour, but saying nothing about
Lilian being with him, since he could not endure the idea of drag-
ging her name into such associations. He heard of Lee’s death ﬁrst
on the morning of New Year’s Day.
He alrnost smiled when, at the close of the wearisome inquiry,
the jury returned a verdict of Willful Murder against him.
Admiral Everard and Keppel received the intelligence by tele-
gram just as the squadron was leaving Spithead. Leslie was already
on his way to India, and so heard nothing.
The trial before the magistrates seemed to Everard but a weary
repetition of the inquest nightmare.
The same witnesses appeared with the same evidence in fuller
detail. The surgeon, a Dr. Eastbrook, who had attended the
Swaynestone people ever since he began to practice, conﬁrmed the
evidence touching Lee’s good health and regular and abstemious
habits, and was borne out by a second surgeon, who had assisted
him in a post-mortem examination. Both surgeons witnessed to
contusions and other signs of struggle; they were unanimous in
ascribing the death to a blow not self-inﬂicted, and both were of
opinion that Lee’s assailant must have been a man of considerable
muscular power, Lee himself being a powerful man scarcely past
the prime of life. In cross-examination, they admitted that a
/ knowledge of anatomy would indicate the part behind the ear as

one for a fatal blow. Poor Mr. Maitland gave evidence to Henry’s
spotless character, and was much dismayed at ﬁnding himself led
into giving damaging statements of Everard’s extreme eagerness to
attend Mrs. Lee in the previous spring, and his frequent visits to the
Temple. He was equally dismayed at the damaging eﬁect of his
evidence touching Everard’s demeanor at dinner with regard to the
black eye. Granfer also contrived to eﬁ'ect a little more mischief in
the town hall.
Granfer was disgusted to observe that Sir Lionel, who was a
witness, was not on the bench, and that a mere lad of some forty
summers, a pompous man of commercial extraction, for whom the
old aristocrat had the heartiest contempt, played the leading part
on that august eminence. He therefore put on his most stolid look,
and acted as if extremely hard of hearing as well as comprehension,
and contrived to impress Mr. Browne-Stockham with the idea that
he was past giving evidence. The magistrate, moreover, was fully
impressed with a conviction of Everard’s guilt, which impression he
had derived from Sir Lionel, who was furious with indignation at
the guilt and hypocrisy which had brought about the tragedy, and
had made him accuse and suspect his own son amid all kinds of
domestic discord, and was disposed to believe anything of the man
who sat at his board one day and killed his beloved and trusted
servant the next. Mr. Browne-Stockham, therefore, after many
vain attempts, succeeded in getting Granfer, whose mental impene-
trability caused innumerable titters in the court, to reply to his
question if he understood the nature of an oath. '
“A oath,” returned Granfer at last, with an air of matchless
vacuity, “ a oath,” he repeated in his slow way, as he scratched his
head and slowly looked round the court—“ ay, I hreckon I under-
stand the nature of they. I’ve a yeerd more oaths in a hour than
you could swear in a day. Ay,” he continued after a pause, during
which an explosion of laughter from the court was angrily subdued,
and looking more helplessly vacant than ever, “my master was the
s“Weariest man you ever see. I’ve a yeerd more oaths than you’ve
got Zuvverins avore you was barncd—or thought on, for that mat-
ter,” he added, with a sudden gleam of inane self-complacency in
the eyes he directed upon the indignant magistrate, who muttered
that the old fool was in his dotage, while the court again exploded
with laughter, as courts so easily do.
“ Do you know,” Mr. Browne-Stockham asked, in his most pomp

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAI TLAND. 153
ous manner, when order was once more restored, “ in whose
presenceryou stand? "
Granfer once more looked round in his slow way, with an
expression half-way between an owl and an idiot, and replied,
without the faintest quiver of a facial muscle, “ I ain’t a zeen none
of ’em avore, as I knows on; athout,” he added, brightening up
suddenly, “athout it’s Sir Lionel. I knows he well enough.
Knowed his vather avore ’un. Vine vigure of a man he was.”
Here Granfer’s evidence was lost in such a roar that the magis-
trate was driven to the verge of frenzy, and threatened to clear the
court. Finally, Isaac Hale, aged ninety-six, was duly sworn, and
was rather severely handled while giving his evidence as to his
meeting Everard at ﬁve o’clock, the very 'hour at which the maids
swore to his return by the back way to the Rectory.
Everard had given him a shilling to drink his health with, he
said, and had further bestowed some tobacco upon him- For the
consideration of a shilling, it was suggested, an aged rustic might
well make a mistake as to the exact hour of meeting a friend on the
highway. Mr. Browne-Stockham, moreover, was convinced, from
Granfer’s Brutus-like aﬂ'ectation of imbecility later on, that the old
man was in collusion with the accused.
Mrs. Lee and J udkins both bore witness to the exchange of high
words between Everard and Lee at their chance meeting on the
Saturday, Lee having gone home in great excitement and told them
that he had forbidden Everard his house. Cyril was summoned to
conﬁrm these statements. There was no quarrel, Cyril said on his
oath, but Lee seemed annoyed, neither of them knew why, and
forbade Everard his house; they supposed him to be under the
inﬂuence of drink.
Here the counsel for the prosecution took Cyril up sharply, and
asked what grounds he had for such a supposition with regard to a
man whose sobriety was well known; and, altogether, Cyril’s evi-'
dence was severely tested and reduced to powder. ﬁe sat down
wsth the despairing conviction that he had done Everard as much
damage as possible. .
Lilian’s evidence, however, had a worse effect even than his. She
had tried to avoid admitting her glimpse of the gray ﬁgure at dusk,
but in vain. The maids swore that she had both seen and spoken to
the supposed Everard, and she was placed in the cruel position of
having to swear for or against an apparition, which she believed to

154 THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND.
be some trick of the senses and imagination and which she could in
honest truth neither aﬂirm nor deny. Placed in the witness-box,
she could only say that she thought she saw a gray ﬁgure ﬂit by in
the dusk, and that she spoke under the impression that it was Dr.
Everard, but believed herself to have been mistaken. Pressed for
a reason for doubting his identity, she could only give his silence
when spoken to, and his subsequent denial at dinner of having
come in at that hour, and it required no very keen intelligence to
discover that Lilian wished to disbelieve in the apparition. She vol-
unteered evidence as to the alleged meeting with Alma at midday,
stating that she was with Everard the whole time, and that they
had seen no human being besides themselves. '
It did not follow from this, as was observed, that Alma was not
there, as Mrs. Lee and J udkins had sworn, or that Everard had not
intended to meet her at that hour, had he been able to be alone.
Alma was not in a condition even to make a deposition on her bed
of sickness, since she continued more or less delirious for some
weeks after her father’s death: but her evidence was not deemed
of suﬂicient consequence to justify a postponement of the trial, which,
after a quantity of evidence which it would be tedious to detail,
ended in a repetition of the coroner’s verdict; and Henry, doubting
whether there were any longer a solid earth to stand on, or a just
Heaven to appeal to, found himself committed for trial at the next
assizes on the capital charge.
CHAPTER XV.
CYRIL’s direst anticipations had not reached acapital conviction,
though he had feared manslaughter, and even Sir Lionel Swayne-
stone had his doubts as to the justice of the graver charge. Oldport
public opinion, which was naturally stirred to its depths, was divided
between the two; of the accused‘s innocence it had not the slightest
suspicion. The little town was Liberal, not to say Radical, in its
politics, and disposed to think the worst of a gentleman in his deal-
ings with those beneath him.
Few people had a good word for a medical man of good birth,
who was said to have taken advantage of both rank and profession

THE SILENCE 011' DEAN MAITLAND. I 155
to work such cruel harm as that imputed to Everard. The medical
profession, strangely enough, has never been popular, skill in the
healing art being usually attributed by the unlearned to the favor
of the Evil One: a clever physician is prized and feared, but-rarely
loved. Even among the cultured there still lingers a faint repulsion,
for the man who is the only welcome guest in the day of sickness
and peril, and society is only just beginning to honor the cultivated '
intellect and recognize the social value of the doctor.
The case of William Palmer, the notorious poisoner, was then
fresh in people’s minds, and the ease and impunity with which a
skillful physician can become a murderer had awakened something
of the old superstitious horror of the doctor’s occult knowledge in
the public imagination. Browne-Stockham and his colleague, a
retired merchant of limited intellect and still more limited knowl-
edge, and whose birth and liberal politics prejudiced him against
Everard as a scion of a good old Tory family, were both strongly
prepussessed against the innocence of a doctor vvho had manifested
such unaccountable eagerness to get a footing in a humble family
under pretense of exercising his skill. Dr. Eastbrook had been
ready and willing to attend Mrs. Lee as usual in the preceding
spring, as his evidence stated; Dr. Everard had asked leave to
_ attend with him, because it was an unusual and very interesting
case, a thing neither magistrates nor coroner‘s jury could under-
stand.
Dr. Eastbrook, an older man, and too busy to be very eager
about unusual cases, was not sorry to have Everard’s help, since
the case required more frequent visits than he could conveniently
give, and ﬁnally he gave up the case to him altogether. This the
public mind could conceive; but Everard’s great eagerness and as-
siduous watching of the sick woman needed some motive to account
for it. What motive could there be save that sinister one of seeing
Alma constantly and alone? Thus many prejudices gathered together
to precipitate Everard’s doom, and although the prejudice of class
was not so strong against him before the judge and jury at the
~essizes, yet there his profession exposed him to as great dis-
favor. .
Everard once discussed with Cyril the subject of the doctor’s
small popularity as compared with the clergyman’s, and Cyril ac-
counted for it partly by the usefulness of the surgeon. “Clergy-
men,” he observed, in one of those bursts of ingenuous satire that

delighted Everard, “ are of no use save at two or three august mo- \
ments of life—when a man dies, gets married, or is born—therefore
they inspire popular reverence as belonging to the ornamental and
superﬂuous portion of existence—its fringes, so to speak. Doctors,
on the contrary, can not be dispensed with; their services are
needed and obtained on the most homely occasions, and men never
reverence the indispensable. Bread and cheese is taken as a matter
of course, but the champagne of festivals is thought much of.”
Cyril often aﬁected a cynicism which amused Everard the more
from its contrast with his supposed character.
It was difﬁcult to move through the dense crowd which gathered
round the Oldport Town Hall when Everard issued from it at the
conclusion of the magistrates’ inquiry, and public opinion expressed
.itself in hisses and groans as the vehicle in which he was being eon-
veyed moved slowly, and not without some effort on the part of the
guard of police, through the square.
Not every day was there such an exciting event as a trial for
murder in the town hall, nor was it often that a culprit of such high
social standing appeared in the well-known dock. The little town
were quite a festal air. Street-musicians and barrows laden with
nuts, oranges and ginger-beer drove a thriving trade; and there
was not a bar at public-house or hotel in the place which did not
receive an excess of custom during the inquiry. Nothing else was
talked of, and the experience of ages has shown that when man-
kind talk they must drink something more inspiriting than water;
also that when they drink that something they invariably talk in
proportion to its inspiriting qualities. Tea-tables are supposed to be
the great centers of gossip, and their female devotees its high priest-
esses. This is a popular fallacy. The ladies bear their part valiant-
1y, but they can not match the men. From the West End club
down to the humblest public-house,~male coteries are the great
sources of social information, which arrives in a. weakened second-
hand form at the female tea-board, where, indeed, it is frequently
1'0be for obvious reasons of its most racy characteristics.
On the evening after the termination of the great murder case,
the pleasant bow-windowed room behind the bar at Burton’s Hotel,
which, as everybody knows, is opposite the town hall, was occupied
not only by its nightly frequenters, but also by many less familiar
gUQSts, who dropped in ostensibly for a cigar and brandy or pale ale
for the good of the house, but really to hear the news, or rather to

enjoy the curious pleasure experienced by human bipeds in retelling
and rehearing from many different lips what they know perfectly
already—like the readers who enjoy the whole of “The Ring and
the Book." Among these grave citizens was Mr. Warner, the
owner of the large linen-draper’s shop, which makes the High
Street so resplendent with plate-glass and fashionable fabrics.
“If ever I saw guilty written on a man’s face,” he observed
thoughtfully, “it was stamped upon Everard’s.”
“ I never saw a fellow with such a brazen look,”. returned young
Cooper, of the great auctioneering ﬁrm. “Eastbrook says he is
awfully clever."
“Those fellows generally are," added Strutt, the principal tailor,
removing his cigar from his lips and looking lovingly at it. “ How
I pity those poor M ' lands! ” .
“Nice fellow/Zlfng Maitlandl I’ve known him from a boy,”
said Warner. “They always deal with us. He was in my shop on
the very day of the murder.” 7
“Ahl and he was in mine on that same day,” added Strutt.
“Taking manners he has. Till he went to Cambridge, every thread
he wore came from us. I know him well.”
“Looks ill; trouble, perhaps,” chimed in young Mr. West, cash-
ier at the county bank. “I hear that this Everard was bred up
with him.”
“ He was,” returned Warner; “ but this young Maitland's man-
ner is up to everything. The young scampl he came into our
establishment on New Year’s Eve. Marches up to me with his
hand held out, looking as if he’d come from London on purpose to
see me. ‘How are you, Warner? A happy New Year!’ and so
on. ‘How well you are looking! ’ Inquiries for every creature in
my house. Presently asks if I can cash a check for him—check
of Sir Lionel Swaynestone’s, ten guineas, as good paper as the Bank
of England’s, of course. He wanted all gold, which we couldn’t
quite do, and had to send a young man to Oave’s for some of it.
‘ This check is for charities in our East End parish, which is fright-
fully poor,’ said he, and so on, and so on. ‘And if you should hap~
pen by mistake to slip in an additional guinea, Warner,” says his
worship, ‘I’ll promise you to overlook it for once.’ Well, there was
something in the lad’s way that got the better of me, and I was
weak enough to slip in the extra coin, though we make a point of
keeping to local charities; and, upon my soul, I felt as if I had

received therfavor, not he. Those are the manners to make one’s
way in the world with.” '
“And those are the people who deserve to get on,” interposed
the auctioneer; “ not your surly, deﬁant fellows, like this Everard.
By George! to see him look at the witnesses. I fancy he’d like to
have the physickiug of some of theml ”
“That’s queer about the check,” said Strutt, the tailor. “Why,
he got us to cash him a check that same day, and would have it
gold, tool Our check was by the Vicar of Oldport—ﬁve guineas."
“ What! the same day?” asked another citizen, who had been
listening. “What did he want with ﬁfteen guineas in gold in his
pocket? "
“Well,” replied Strutt, “he said he couldn’t bear paper; it
never seemed real to him. And he got over me with his extra
coins just as he did over Warner. We showed him some new
patent braces. ‘Dear me, Struttl ’ says he, ‘is it possible that you
don’t know that the younger clergy expect to have these things
found them?’ looking as grave as a judge. ‘Found them, really,
Mr. Maitland'l’ says I. ‘To be sure! braces and smoking-caps,
worked by devout females.’ Not much to say, but the quaintuess
of the manner tickled me, and one of our young men laughed out.
Maitlsnd never smiled, but asked for some handkerchiefs. ‘The
faithful don’t supply handkerchiefs, unluckily,’ says he." .
“He didn’t look much like joking in the box, poor chap! ” said
Cooper reﬂectively. “ Wonder what he wanted with all that gold? ”
“People are fond of gold, particularly ladies and clergymen,”
observed young West, who was still more surprised than the trades-
men at Cyril’s passion for specie. He stroked his moustache
thoughtfully, and wished that professional etiquette did not forbid
him to relate his anecdote, which he thought might throw some
light on the bag of coin found in the wood.
Cyril had visited the bank on that same day, and drawn thirty
pounds on his own account. West asked him the usual question.
“Notes or gold?” expecting to be asked for, perhaps, ﬁve pounds
gold, and the rest paper, and looked a little surprised at the ready
answer, “ Gold."
Cyril laughed. “You think it odd to carry so much gold about,
Mr. West? ” he asked.
“It is unusual, certainly, Mr. Maitland, and, if it were known,
would be dangerous.”

\
“Oh, no one suspects a starveliug curate of being overburdened
with coinl A handful of sovereigns loose about me is a whim oi
mine.. it makes me fancy myself a. rich man; there is an Arabian
Nights’ ﬂavor about it. What a Dives you must feel when you‘
shovel up the sovereigns in that knowing little shovel of yours! ”
. Mr. West replied that he could more readily realize the sensa-
tions of Lazarus, and asked his customer if he did not frequently
lose money, when he saw him carelessly drop the three little piles
of gold into his waistcoat pockets.
“I might if I stood on my head,” returned Cyril, “ and that is
not probable. If you should hear of a mild curate being murdered
and robbed in the course of the next few days, you will be able to
bear witness against the assassin. Nice weather for the season,
isn’t it? Good morning.”
“ Fifteen and thirty make forty-ﬁve,” mused young Wes , “ and
two fellows would have at least ﬁve pounds gold more about them
in the common course of things. Yet, to hear Maitland talk, you
would think he never moved without his pockets full of specie. A
whim of his! Clergy can lie as well as others.
“I tell you what,” he added aloud, “I expect young Maitland
could open people’s eyes about this murder, if he cared to. Those
ﬁfteen sovereigns went into that bag, I’ll lay any money.”
“ N at it,” returned Cooper. “ A fellow wouldn’t ask a parson
to help him in such a scrape, chum or no chum.”
“He’d ask the devil himself,” interposed young Durant, who
was articled to his uncle, Everard‘s solicitor.
_ “In that case, he would turn to a lawyer,” retorted Cooper,
slily.
“Well,” pursued West, “did you ever see a fellow stutter over
his evidence like that? And Maitland so ready with his tengue.
He was afraid of incriminating his friend, poor chap! "
“I was sorry for Miss Maitland," said Warner. “ To see her
tremble! Somebody said she was engaged to Everard.”
“No engagement, my uncle says,“ replied Durant. “A pretty
girl, like her brother, but older, I suppose.”
“ Why, they are twins! Everybody knows the Melbourne
twins,” said Mr. Warner. “An escape for her, if she cared for this
doctor fellow. Nice girl; our people always like to serve her. Do
you think they’ll hang him, Strutt? ”
“I tell you what,” broke in Burton, the landlord; “it‘s no

hanging business. Ten to one, Lee attacked him. In any case,
there was a stiff struggle. Look at the torn coat, and the black eye.”
“If you try to murder me with a pint pot, Burton, and I round
upon you, and hit out straight till I’m down, it’s none the less
murder,” said another customer.
“This will be manslaughter at Belminster,” said the landlord,
oraeularly. “ Who'll bet upon it? I’ll take any odds.”
Even more surprised than Mr. West was Lilian, when, on her
parting with Cyril on his return to his duties, he asked her to lend
him a couple of sovereigns.
“Why, you extravagant boy! Have you spent all those we
gave you for your parish? " she asked.
Cyril shrugged his shoulders. “ You know the fellow of old,
Lill, and how he scatters his coins. Only three guineas, all told,
you know.”
“Oh, Gylll And Sir Lionel’s ten? ”
“On paper. You can’t pay your railway fare with a check.
Oh yes! scold away. I ought to have brought more money with
me, I dare say. I never carry coin about, dear; too sure to lose it.
But, wonder of wonders, I do chance to have a ﬁve pound note.
There! ”>
Cyril had repaired to the Rectory for the ﬁrst time since New
Year’s Eve to bid his mother good-by. He could not bear to be
there after what had occurred, he said, and be especially shrank,
though he did not say so, from meeting Lilian. '
“Poor dear fellow! sensitive as he is, no wonder he can not
bear to be here,” commented Mr. Maitland. “ It is a sore trial for
us all,” he sighed, as Lilian turned her head away.
For he knew now of Lilian‘s love; she had told him all in the
terrible quarter of an hour in his study on New Year’s Day, when
he broke the horror of Everard’s arrest to her, and she reproaclied
him passionately for his disbelief in the innocence of the accused.
But Cyril was obliged to conquer his repugnance, and bid his
invalid mother farewell, and the rush of emotion which overcame
him in stepping over the threshold, so lately desecrated by Everard’s
arrest, was thought only natural and creditable to him. Lilian met
him there, and drew him aside to her room, where Everard’s gift
of Guercino‘s Guardian Angel gazed with his rapt, earnest gaze far
away over the sorrowful earth to the distant heaven of joy and
purity.

“ Oh, Cyril! ” cried Lilian, \“ why did you not come before? I
have wanted you so. They are all against him. Every one believes
him guilty but me. Tell me, dear—oh, tell me that one at least
is true to him! You are his friend; you can not think him
guilty.” I
Cyril paused, his own emotion smothered, as it were, by this
outburst of Lilian’s, an outburst so foreign to her usual calm self-
control and restrained strength: then he opened his arms in a rush
of the 01d, lifelong aﬁ‘ection, and clasped Lilian to his heart.
“I do believe in him,” he said; “he is as innocent as an unborn
babe. I know it—I know it! ”
“ Dear Cyril, I knew you would be true,” replied Lilian.
“What shall we do, Cyril? Oh! what shall we do? ”
“What, indeed? ” returned Cyril, overcome by the unaccus-
tomed passion of Lilian, whose tears mingled with his own, as the
twins cried in each other’s arms, just as they had done in the old
days of childhood. _
“ Keep up your heart, Lill,” said Cyril, caressingly, when they
had recovered themselves a little. “After all, what is it? An
idiotic mistake, a foolish mare’s nest, invented by these stupid
rustics. A little inquiry will set all right.”
“But this verdict—oh, Cylll ” exclaimed Lilian, letting her
head droop once more on her brother’s shoulder and weeping
afresh.
“What 1's the verdict?” asked Cyril, rather tremulously, as he
stroked the rich waves of Lilian’s hair, and rejoiced that she could
not see his face. “Surely not—? ”
“Murder,” replied Lilian, in low, shuddering tones.
Cyril uttered an exclamation. Was it an oath? Lilian did not
even pause to commend it to the recording angel’s lenience. Blue
ﬁre shot from his eyes, and he ground his teeth.
“Asses! ” he exclaimed at last. “Never mind the coroner and
his stupid verdict, darling,” he added soothingly. “ Coroners hap-
pily do not administer justice. A very little evidence will set
things straight. Henry was not in the wood. They can not prove
him to have been in two places at once. Widow Dove being out
that night was unlucky.”
“ Everything seems unlucky,” sighed Lilian. “ The stars in their
courses ﬁght against him, Cyril.”
Lilian raised her head, and looked sorrowfully and appealingly,

as it seemed, into her brother’s eyes; and a rush of deep aﬁection,
springing from the purest sources in his nature, clouded the young
man’s glance, and he clasped her once more protectingly to his
breast, feeling, as in the days of his spotless boyhood, that no hu~
man being could ever be so close and dear to him as this twin sister,
whose being was so closely and mysteriously interwoven with his
own. All affections and ties that had since arisen seemed as noth-
ing in comparison with this one strong bond of primal instinctive
love; even the bond of marriage seemed but a secondary thing by
the side of it.
The twins had drifted apart of late years. They had thought
that the old childish union must naturally grow weaker with the
increasing complex claims of mature life; but now they realized
that it had only sunk out of sight for a time, like an underground
stream, to break forth again with renewed power. Lilian’s weak~
ness and momentary self-abandonment called out all that was man-
liest and best in Cyril. Hers, he knew, was the deeper, stronger
nature. He leant habitually on her, and now he was touched to ﬁnd
her leaning on him ; and the tears they shed together renewed and re-
conseerated the strong kinship between them, like some holy chrism.
He felt a happier and better man than he had been for many
weary months after that mingling of tears, and the thought ﬂashed
through him, with a mingling of pain and sweetness, that they
were too closely united not to stand or fall together; either he
must drag Lilian down, or she must raise him up. Lilian would
surely, be thought, as he gazed into her clear, deep, beautiful eyes,
he in some way his salvation. In the mean time, he soothed and
comforted her. _ _
“ You see, Lill,” he said, “ somebody killed poor Lee, probably
by accident. And, if things came to the worst with Everard, that
somebody would certainly come forward and clear him.”
This seemed curious reasoning, and yet it comforted Lilian
strangely. “ My great hope is in Alma,” she said. “ I am sure she
can throw light upon the affair.”
A hot ﬂame shot over Cyril’s face, and he turned his gaze
from his sister‘s and looked out of the window. “No doubt,” he
replied.
“And then,“ continued Lilian, lifting her head with a proud,
indignant ﬂush, “this hideous aspersion must vanish.”
“ Good heavens! Lilian, do you mean that they—”

“You have not followed the evidence, Cyril? ” asked Lilian.
“ Get the Advertiser, and you will see. Yes, they dare—they actu-
ally dare,” she continued, drawing herself up, and walking up and
down with gestures of indignant disdain, while her eyes shot forth
such a stream of light as Cyril’s were wont to do, “ to charge him
with Alma’s ruin! "
The twins had been looking more alike than ever during their
impassioned interview, till Lilian, in her ﬁery indignation, seemed
like an intensiﬁed Cyril; but now the softness and calm strength,
which seemed to have passed from the sister to the brother, sud-
denly left the latter, and his face changed and hardened, but he said
nothing.
“My hope is that Alma may not die,” continued Lilian, not
observing him in the intensity of her passion.
“Die! ” interrupted Cyril in a deep, strange voice, while his
breath came gaspingly. -‘ Is there danger? ”
“Yes; but God is good. He will not let her die an she has
proved Henry’s innocence."
Cyril was trembling with a terrible hope. and yet a dread of
what he dared not even in thought acknowledge. He could not
speak for some moments, but looked out into the chill garden,
smothering this fierce emotion, and striving to stiﬂe a wish that
formed itself in spite of his better nature. At last he turned to
Lilian, whose unexhaustcd passion continued to pour itself out in
the same strain, with the radiant smile whoee magnetism so few
could resist.
‘ “What idiots we are, Lill," he said, “wasting our fears upon
this phantom! Old Hal will be here laughing at the absurd mis-
take in a week. There needs no interposition of Providence to
arrange that simple matter. And, if it were not so,” he added, his
brow darkening, “he must be free—at any cost—at any cost,” he
repeated, below his breath.
“At any cost,” be repeated, as he drove his father into Oldport;
and be turned and looked upon the gray head by his side with a
strange mixture of tenderness and dismay. Mr. Maitland was con-
versing cheerin as they drove along, with a view to keeping up
Cyril‘s spirits, and carefully avoiding the subject which was upper-
most in everybody’s mind.
“ So Marion declines to come to us,” he said at last.
“ Yes,” replied Cyril, in the plaintive tone with which he usually

discussed small annoyances: “She says that her place is at Wood-
lands, under present circumstances."
“ Poor dear! she is a brave girl. Perhaps she is right. While
George and his wife are there she will be cared for. Yes, she is
right. Yet for Lilian’s sake—well— Why, Cyril lad,” he added,
as Cyril lifted his hat for a moment to cool his hot forehead, just as
they were passing the Temple and the fatal wood above it, “ that is
a nasty bruise on your head! How did you get it? ”
“That?” replied Cyril, replacing his hat with a smile, and
gently ﬂicking the pony into a better pace. “Oh, I did that ages
ago! I ran against a door in the dark. Here are the Swayne-
stones. How well Ethel sits her horse! Maude is inclined to be
heavy.”
“Those poor Maitlandsl ” Maude Swaynestone was saying to
her sister. “ How glad Cyril must be to get back to his parish! "
" How he must hate papa! ” returned Ethel, hotly, “ or despise
him for arresting an innocent man on such ﬂimsy grounds! ”
“ My dear Ethel, your weakness for Dr. Everard carries you over
the bounds of reason.” '
When Cyril reached the station, he obtained every local paper
published, and forgot to pay for them in his eagerness till gently
reminded.
“Just in time, sir,” the stall-keeper said, as he handed him his
change. “ We have no copies of the Advertiser left. All the pa-
pers printed double editions, too. The Everards and Maitlands are
so well known in these parts.”
“Are they?” replied Cyril, turning away with a ﬂash of blue
ﬁre from his eyes. ‘
“Well, I am blowedl” cried the stall-keeper’s boy-assistant.
doubled up with laughing. “ If that ain’t young Maitland hisselfl ”
Cyril‘s hands shock as he opened the sheets and ran his eye
down the columns till he saw, in large capitals, “The Swaynestone
Murder. Adjourned Inquest. Verdict.” He held the paper so as
to shield his face from the gaze of his fellow-travelers, and read
with growing horror, until cold drops stood on his forehead, and
his lips grew dry and hard.
“ I never dreamed of this," he muttered. “Heaven is my wit-
ness, I never dreamed of it! ”
Life seemed to him one hopeless tangle of error and misery,_
against which he was powerless to strive. Labyrinth after laby-

rinth seemed to draw him within their interminable folds, till his
brain was dazed and his heart sick. Nowhere could he catch the
claw to any straight course; by no means could he unwind the
deadly coil that Fate had wound so closely and thickly round him;
as he thought, forgetting his own share in the work. What was
the good, he wondered, of being born into a world so complex, so
bewildering, so full of complicated motive and bafﬂed purpose, so be—
set by the devil and all his works? He felt as weak as any weaned
child, as terriﬁed as a boy in the dark, in the presence of the gigantic
evils striding upon him; his will seemed to melt like wax within
him. Then he remembered Lilian in her unwonted passion, and
the memory was like the balm of morning breezes through the open
window of a sick-room, and he made a stand against the mental and
moral swoon which threatened him. Yes, in Lilian, his better self,
the saving clause of his being spoke, and he murmured to himself
once more, “ At any cost.”
Some fresh travelers got in at Belminster, and Cyril entered into
conversation with them, which became animated as they touched
upon congenial topics. \
“ What a brilliant lad! ” one of them observed to his companion,
as they drove away from Waterloo; “ one of the half-dozen who can
talk."
“It will be all right,” Cyril thought to himself, as he sped east-
ward in his hansom through the crowded streets; “something will
turn up—some happy chance.”
CHAPTER XVI.
EARLY on a bleak spring morning, cold with the bitter chill
which comes only at the moment just before the dawn of day or
the turn of winter, and strikes into the very marrow of the bones,
Cyril Maitland was entering Belminster by the steep road descend-
ing into the ancient city from the windy downs which partially
surround it.
'Early as it was, he had walked far, having risen from his sleep-
/ less couch in utter restlessness, and sought to still his inward fever
by bodily exercise. A cup of milk at a farmhouse, and a crust of

bread, which he tried in vain to swallow, formed his frugal break~
fast. He had in his hand a manual of Lenten devotion, which he
could not read. llis beautiful eyes were brilliant with fever, and
appeared all the larger from the dark circles beneath them. “I
can not bear this much longer,” he murmured to himself, as be de-
scended the steep chalky road, and gazed mechanically on the gray
old city, with its solemn towers and buttressed minster, lying in the
gray chill light beneath the leaden sky; “ my brain will give way.”
On the slope of the opposite hill were some large gloomy build-
ings, one of which, the county jail, struck upon his sense with
sickening horror. Everard was there, to undergo his trial; for
nothing had occurred, as Cyril so fondly hoped, to deliver him, and
he was beginning to wonder if it were possible that, in spite of all
the complicated machinery of English justice, an innocent man
could suffer the penalty of a great crime. To-day, Cyril thought,
it must be decided. If the wished-for something failed to turn up,
one terrible alternative remained, and Henry must be delivered, as
he had told Lilian, “at any cost.”
He walked hurriedly on, as those walk who are chased by ter-
rible cares—with something of the weary haste of wild animals
ever on the alert for lurking danger—between the old-fashioned,
timbered cottages, stuck at picturesque angles, as if dropped by
chance, on the hillside, and becoming more numerous till they fell
into continuous line, as he reached the bottom of the hill where the
river Bele wound its quiet course through level mead and round
about the old houses, which lay humbly, as it were, at the feet of
the lordly cathedral and the wealthy streets of the ancient city.
Here a bridge spanned the stream, and a little way back from the
road stood a quaint mill, built over an archway, to admit the pas-
sage of the swift~ﬂowing water, and overgrown on its gabled,
weather-stained stone front by a vine, on which a leaf or two yet
lingered, and about which pigeons clustered, hoping for sunshine,
and sheltered from the bleak east wind.
Cyril seated himself on the low stone wall of the bridge, and
looked down into the dark stream, on the banks of which the cot-
tages clustered thickly at a little distance from the road. His watch
told him that he had not yet consumed all the weary time, and the
running water had a strange attraction for him—the idea of sinking
beneath it, and being hurried on away and away for ever was so
restful, though he smiled bitterly at the thought that it was scarcely

deep enough to end a man‘s troubles. A child had been drowned
there from a cottage garden the day before, but he did not know
this.
The musical chimes of the city told the quarter in melodious
vibrations; bugles were ringing from the barracks on the heights;
the hum of busy city life was rising and deepening. When the hour
struck, he would have to join Lilian and his father in the court, to
watch the trial, and perhaps bear witness. He almost envied Ever—
ard his place in the prisoner’s dock. He at least was tortured by
no doubts, he had no wrestlings with a weak and divided will; his
course lay plain and straight before him. Many thoughts passed
through Cyril’s mind as he sat there, regardless of the bleak wind,
and watched the unresting water, and once more he lived through
the scene of the previous Sunday.
His rector, with cruel kindness, seeing that the young man was
overwrought by the labors which be discharged with such appar-
ently conscientious zeal, and tortured by anxiety for his friend, had
hidden him take a little holiday, and go home to prepare himself for
the ordeal of Everard’s trial. Thus on the Sunday Cyril found him-
self once more in the old familiar home, now so distasteful to him
through bitter associations. The Malbourne witnesses, including
most of the Maitland household, were subpoznaed for the following
day, and all were present at church, most of them with a lively
remembrance of Cyril’s sermon on Innocent’s Day, when the slayer
and the slain had been there also. To-day Cyril enjoyed the rare
luxury of forming one of the congregation; but his father, having
mentioned at luncheon, with a profound sigh, that it was christen-
ing Sunday, Cyril, knowing that neither he nor Mr. Marvyn enjoyed
the duty, offered to take it for him.
“They make me do nearly all the baptisms at St. Chad‘s,” he
said, smiling at the recollection of his fellow curates’ frequent
requests to relieve them of this duty, “because the babies seldom
cry with me. And they are not engaging babies,” he added; “utter
strangers to water, much less soap. We frequently have children
of six or seven, and they need management.”
So when the time came, Cyril rose from his place in the chancel,
and walked down the church to the font, round which three in-
fants were ranged with their sponsors. The congregation turned to
the west, and Lilian watched her brother with loving reverence, as
he poured the water into the font, and began the solemn service in

his perfect manner, giving each word its proper weight and purest
enunciation in his matchless voice, which was like an organ with
many stops. The bright afternoon sun of early spring fell upon him
and the pathetic little group of poor men’s babes brought for his
ministrations, and Lilian no longer wondered at his being chosen
for the duty at St. Chad‘s, when she saw him bend and take the
children with reverent tenderness in his arms, and, by some subtle
magnetism in his touch, hush incipient wailings into peaceful, wide-
eyed quiet.
The most impressive and touching of all the Church‘s ofﬁces,
this baptismal service seemed, under Cyril’s ministration, yet
more solemn and pathetic, and the most unimaginative and com-
monplace woman, whose child was restored to her-arms in that
careful and digniﬁed manner, could not but feel that something
august and wonderful had befallen the unconscious infant in the
interval. George Joseph, a lusty babe whose vigorous roars had
occasioned his being transported three times to the churchyard,
subsided into cherubic quiet after one or two rebellious efforts at
a scream, which the graceful young priest soothed with scarcely
perceptible gestures, and began his Christian course in a most
laudable manner; then came a tiny Elizabeth Jane, who conducted
herself with equal propriety. Then Cyril turned to the third infant,
which he did not recognize by its friends, as he had the others.
It was carried by a widow woman, who lived alone in the vi]-
lage, and was known far and wide as the friend of the friendless,
and the natural visitor of every house in which there was trouble
of any kind; she was also the invariable sponsor of infants who
conferred no credit on their friends. This child was better dressed
than the cottager’s children, all in white, with black ribbons at its
shoulders. It was a baby that no woman, from a queen downward,
could have looked upon without longing to kiss, and was uttering
various little dove-like murmurs, which occasionally rose to a crow
of joy, and which the magic touch, and perhaps the glance of the
priest, quieted into the softest sounds.
“ Name this child,” said Cyril, turning to the sponsors, and ex-
pecting to hear some feminine appellation, a female having already
by mistake taken precedence of it.
“Benjamin Lee,” replied the widow, in clear, high tones, which
seemed to ring through the silence of the church and pierce into the
very core of Cyril’s heart. He staggered, and his face for a mo-

ment'was whiter than the infant‘s dress or his own stainless robe.
Not the child which St. Christopher bore on his giant shoulders
pressed with a more overwhelming weight upon him than did this
cooing babe, looking up with the beautiful, far-oﬂt' gaze of baby in-
nocence into his white face, press upon the shuddering arm which
infolded him. i
For some seconds a dead silence, broken only by the child’s
happy murmurs, ﬁlled the church. The whole congregation saw
the terrible emotion with which Cyril was shaken—his father, Mr.
Marvyn, who was looking down pitifully from the reading-desk and
reproaching himself for not having prepared his pupil, and thus
saved him from the shock, the Swaynestones, the Garretts, his
mother and Lilian, all the old familiar faces; and there was a kind
of sympathetic stir through the congregation, and a feeling of ter-
ror lest the poor young fellow should give way utterly, and be un-
able to continue the ofﬁce.
But after those few seconds, which seemed an eternity to Cyril,
he mastered himself with a strong eﬂ'ort, under the stimulus of the
many-eyed sympathetic glances upon him, and, plunging his right
hand into the holy water, went quietly on, “Benjamin Lee, I bap-
tize thee,” etc., with his accustomed solemnity, nor did his voice
falter once till he returned the infant to its guardian‘s arms, adjust-
ingits robes with his usual care as he did so; only there was a
deeper meaning than ever in his voice as he spoke the pathetic
words of the ritual, especially these: “that he may not be ashamed
—to manfully ﬁght under Christ’s banner against sin, the world,
and the devil; ” and Lilian, who so seldom displayed any emotion,
cried unrestrainedly at this passage.
But more than once during the remainder of the baptismal ofﬁce,
Cyril, instead of reading “they ” and “them,” for the three infants,
read “he” and “him,” especially at the concluding exhortation,
when he looked abstractedly at the now sleeping Benjamin Lee,
and said, “ Ye are to take care that this child,” etc.
Then he returned with a slow and weary step to the chancel,
his gaze ﬁxed on the pavement, and the Nunc Dimittis ringing in
his ears, with a strange feeling of its inappropriateness—for how
different was his case from that of the aged Simeon with the Re-
deemer in his arms l—He felt the sympathetic gaze of the congrega-
tion, who were still watching his haggard, troubled face; and sat
during the sermon with that face, and all the passions which moved

it, covered by the sleeve of his surplice, like that of Ulysses at the
feast.
He had looked down fearfully upon the sweet baby face resting
so placidly against his snowy dress, the “priestly epbod,” as he
had fondly called it with Keble, and his bowels yearned over the
helpless creature so unconscious of its doom and of all the tragedy
caused by its innocent, unwelcome existence; be looked in search
of some likeness that might betray its unknown parent. Was it
fancy that he seemed to see, now a look of- the slain man, now a
look of his own father, but on the whole and with fearful distinct-
ness, the features and expression of Lilian? Would others see this,
and would they wonder at the accidental resemblance, or did it
exist only in his own overwrought, fevered fancy? He could only
pray that the child might grow up with other looks; yet dared he,
ought he, so to pray?
This was the scene re-enncted in his fancy, as he sat on the low
stone wall and watched the river's unceasing ﬂow, and felt no chill
in the biting wind. The little head seemed to rest still on his
throbbing breast; the sweet, deep eyes to gaze up into his; and the
tiny dimpled ﬁst to clutch vaguely at the folds of the priestly gar-
ment, stirring the wildly beating heart beneath it with an emotion
that was not wholly pain, while he still seemed to read those sol-
emn words of baptismal renunciation and manful ﬁghting under the
sacred banner—words that strike with such awful reproach on the
erring soldier of the cross.
Then he thought of Lilian, and his heart seemed to swoon with-
in him; and then of Marion, the center of all his hopes; and he
could look no longer on the ﬂowing water, but rose, suddenly con-
scious of the bleak wind in which he shuddered, and hurried on
like one driven by thought, his eyes on the dusty road. Better, far
better, it would have been to have taken the step he meditated at
such dreadful cost to himself at the very ﬁrst, before this fearful
coil wound itself round Everard; every moment's delay made it
worse, and now there was scarcely room for fate to alter things.
A beautiful music rose mellow and solemn upon his distracted
ear, and ﬂoated softly over the smoke-wreathed city—the cathedral
bells calling to morning prayer. Others sounded from the various
churches in differing cadence, but mostly in monotone, and blended
with the delicate chiming of the minster; none were silent, since
it was Lent, and the melodious confusion penetrated with sweet

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN JIAITLAND. 171
pain the very depths of Cyril’s heart. It recalled the pleasant
chiming of the wagon bells as he heard them on the fatal evening
which began all this trouble, and it reminded him, by its associa-
tion with the cathedral, whose light ﬂying buttresses were now
springing just over his head, of all the hopes to which he was about
to bid farewell for ever. Marion’s charming face hovered once
more smilingly before him, and a stiﬂed sob escaped him. Not many
men, he thought, had such high hopes to renounce, and he walked
on upthe steep street, past the quaint, arcaded houses and the deli-
cately carved and fretted Gothic cross, a man broken in his youth,
utterly wrecked at starting, with a. cup to drink that was beyond
his strength.
A ragged child approached him with tremulous voice and large
pleading eyes, olfering primroses to sell, and Cyril stopped even in
his misery—for he loved children, and they loved him—to stroke its
face and pity its chilled, bare limbs, and give it pence and kindly
words before he hurried on. The boy somehow recalled, by his
wide, clear gaze, the unacknowledged child he had baptized. Would
that child be thus barefoot? he wondered. Had this boy a father
who suffered him to shiver in the bitter blast? The sweet bell-
music went ﬂoating drowsin on. Cyril found his father and Lilian,
and ﬁnally reached the court.
The grand jury had found a true bill of murder against Everard,
and he now appeared in answer to that indictment.
Lilian, looked up, as Cyril dared not. when Everard entered, and
.walked with his usual ﬁrm step and erect hearing, but with an air
of unaccustomed hauteur, into the prisoner’s dock. A young em-
peror could not have ascended a throne with less humility or a gaze
more unfaltering than that with which the usually unassuming,
gentle-mannered Everard mounted the dreadful eminence of the
accused criminal. He looked steadily, some said deﬁantly, all
around the building, measuring judge and jury. counsel and all with
a comprehensive gaze; it was only when his eyes fell on the Mait-
lands, that a hot ﬂush sprang over his face and a quiver troubled it
for a moment.
His features were sharpened by anxiety and suffering. and there
were dark circles under his eyes; but the conﬁnement had not im-
paired his magniﬁcent strength, and the reporters described him
_ as a powerful and resolute man with a deﬁant air. When called
upon to plead, his “ Not guilty,” with an emphasis on the negative,

sounded like achallenge ﬂung in the teeth of the whole world,
which truly seemed to be arraigned against him.
The judge did not like his looks; he thought such a bearing un-
suitable to an accused person, whether innocent or guilty. He
looked in vain for any signs of quailing in the honest hazel eyes,
full of the pride of indignant innocence. The judge’s own gaze
plainly expressed to those who knew the man, “This fellow will
have to bite the dust.”
Mr. Justice Manby was well known as a hanging judge, and,
though he was as just and upright as perhaps only English judges
are, he was human, and thus liable to have his judgment biased by
prejudice, and he conceived a prejudice at ﬁrst glance against the
haughty prisoner arraigned before him. Yet he thought himself
prejudiced the other way. Because he was a strong Conservative,
a staunch upholder of hereditary right and class distinctions, he
feared lest he should unconsciously incline to lenience toward crim-
inals of gentle birth, and said within himself that he would not
spare any for his gentleness, but rather consider how far more
guilty such are than the uncultured herd, who scarcely know their
right hand from their left. The jury, whose minds were full of
Palmer and his diabolical strychnine poisonings, and who felt that
strong measures must be taken to cripple the fearful power the
doctor’s position of trust and unfettered responsibility in homes
gives him, were also prejudiced against him by this haughty bear-
ing, and esteemed him to be a villain eminently dangerous to socie—
' ty. Truly, as Lilian said, the stars in their courses seemed to ﬁght
against Everard.
Even his counsel did not believe his statement of the facts, and
advised him very earnestly to plead guilty to the minor charge.
“How can I plead guilty when I am innocent? ” thundered Ever-
ard. “I tell you I never even saw the the man after the Sunday,
and had quite as much motive for killing you as him; indeed,
more,” he added, for he felt inclined to personal violence on some
of those who so sorely misjudged him, particularly this barrister, who
was master of the peculiar facial expression that may be called the
barrister’s sneer, the expression of a man who has seen too much
0f the wrong side of human nature. The counsel understood the
ﬂash of his client’s eyes, and, when helooked at his poWerful frame,
was glad that he was not like the unfortunate Ben Lee, alone in a A
Wood with him. It was his business, however, to defend the prise

ouer, and not to judge him, and he did his best, fettered, as a man
with any conscience must be, by the belief that his cause was a bad
one.
The great thing, as Cyril had suggested, was to prove an alibi;
and to this end, Granfer, William Grove’s child, Winnie Maitland—
a feeble trio, truly—and Widow Dove were relied upon. The lat-
ter, to Mr. Hawkshaw’s dismay, had already been subpoenaed for the
prosecution, at which Everard smiled; he could not fear her.
Straun, the blacksmith, who deposed to having seen Everard leav-
ing the village in the direction of Swaynestone some time before
Stevens saw him leave the Rectory hy the back of the churchyard,
was further reckoned a strong ally, but, on being put to the test, he
was fatally positive about the gray suit and the stick, and broke
down utterly as to the time on cross-examination.
Then Alma was a strong tower of hope, though reckoned
among the witnesses for the other side ; she would at least dissipate
the calumny based upon the misconceptions of Judkins and her
step-mother, and would explain the nature of her meetings with
Everard in the spring, when they had been accustomed to have
long discussions upon Mrs. Lee‘s symptoms, and she would also en-
lighten people about those unfortunate lectures on botany which
Everard now saw with remorseful humiliation to have been so in-
judicious.
As the trial proceeded, and witness after witness repeated or en-
larged upon the former evidence, Everard realized the sensations of
the man in the story, the horror of which had fascinated his child-
hood—of the sleeper in the ghastly four-post bed, the top of which
slowly and remorselessly descended upon him till it threatened to
become too late to escape from the narrowed aperture, and he should
struggle in vain against his irresistible doom.
At ﬁrst, in spite of all the annoyance and vexatious notoriety of
his unjust committal and detention, Everard had believed that it
must end, after the weighing and sitting of evidence at the ﬁnal
trial, in his acquittal; the worst he feared was leaving the court
with the stains of unrefuted suspicion upon him: but, as the trial
proceeded, a terrible conviction that a miscarriage of justice might
occur was slowly burnt into his soul.
The appearance of Widow Dove in the witness-box gave him a
faint hope, though, having been absent from home, she could not
prove his presence at her cottage; she could merely show the credi-

bility of his tale. It was not possible, he thought, that a man, act-
ing as he was accused of doing, would set up such a feeble pretense
at alibi as to pretend to go to a house from which he averred the
inmates were absent; it would be so very simple to upset this de-
fense by the production of the inmates.
What was his amazement on hearing the witness quietly depose,
“On December 31, I was at home all day with my daughter, who
was in bed with a cold. A book-hawker called in the forenoon;
no one else came to the cottage till six in the evening, when Abra-
ham Wood looked in on his way home from work to get a light for
his pipe, and had some tea.” Questioned by Mr. Hawkshaw, she
said that she was in the house from twelve till six, not even going
into her garden all that time. Her cottage had only two rooms,
with a kind of shed 0r lean-to, which served as scullery. Asked at
what hour she lighted her candle, she replied that she did so about
dusk.
The counsel did not guess what really happened—that the widow,
busy in the sleeping-room with her daughter, let her gorse-ﬁre burn
out, and, being short of fuel, did not re-light it, bitter cold as it was,
till she wished to boil her tea-kettle after Everard had left the dark,
ﬁreless cottage, under the impression that it was untenanted; and
the poor woman’s pride rendered her by no means eager to volun~
teer this information. The daughter corroborated her mother’s
statement, knowing nothing of the extinguished ﬁre or her mother’s
occupation at the time of Everard’s visit, that of cutting gorse-stems
in the shed. Wood, the laborer, who, beguiled by the cheery glow
of the widow’s ﬁre on his evening walk home, got his pipe-light and
cup of tea at the cottage, gave evidence that the ﬁre was alight.
Mr. Hawkshaw thought his client a fool to invent so lame a story.
Everard believed that he was under the inﬂuence of some dreadful
nightmare, which must speedily end.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE Alma Lee who appeared in the witness-box was a very dif-
ferent being from the happy and innocent girl who rode home in

ing, unconscious of the complicated meshes of trouble which the
fates were weaving about the simple strand of her commonplace lot.
Her experience of the bitter realities of life had added a terrible
luster to her beauty, and developed her character in an unexpected
direction. It was a nature, as Lilian said, full of noble possibilities
and strong for good or for evil, and in its perversion it resembled
some mighty stream turned aside from its natural course, and over-
ﬂowing its banks in new and disastrous ways, bringing devastation
where it should have brought blessing. The shame which would
have crushed slender-er and sweeter natures kindled a seornful in-
dignation in Alma, and a sense of the cruel disproportion of her
\ punishment to her guilt—a guilt which looked angel-faced by the
side of a thousand deeper sins which daily pass not only nnavenged,
\ but almost as matters of course—kindled a ﬁerce resentment in her.
Suﬁ‘ering had hardened her; she was a moral ruin, and when she
stepped with a ﬁrm and not nngraeeful carriage into the witness-
box, and looked round the court with haughty deﬁance, every one
compared her bearing with that of the prisoner, and pronounced
them a pair of impenitent evil-doers.
Alma‘s features had lost their youthful softness and indecision
of outline; they were now like chiseled marble, ﬁrm and pure and
beautiful in curve. They had indeed been chiseled into shape by the
sharp strokes of passion and suffering and wrong—terrible sculp-
tors, to whom the human face is as wax ready for modeling. The
dark, almond-shaped, rather melancholy eyes now burned with the
ﬁre of intense resolution; the full, rich red lips were fuller, but ﬁrm-
er; they met in a curve of sharpest accuracy, their former pretty
wilfulness forgotten with girlhood and innocence. Her ﬁgure had
expanded into a statuesque nobility, and all rustic awkwardness in
her gestures was now swallowed up in the unconscious dignity of
her tragic fate.
lIer appearance created great surprise, and a murmer of invol-
untary admiration stirred the court as she entered the box, and cast
her deﬁant glance around. It was no gentle, penitent Magdalen, as
people expected, but a proud, self-reliant woman, magniﬁcent even
in ruin. The girl in the wagon said her prayers daily, hoped for
heaven, and would by no means have told a lie: so she thought, for
she had never endured temptation, and had never needed to prac-
tice self-restraint in her easy, simple life, though she knew self-
denial, but it was the self-denial of impulse, not principle. The

woman in the witness-box still prayed—she had prayed for the
death of her unborn child—but she no longer hoped for heaven.
She knew that it is not for such as love man more than God, and
renounce it at the bidding of another, and yet she did not repent;
she knew that her brief season of evil-doing was the sweetest in
her life, sweeter far than any hopes of heaven had ever been;
she regretted only that it was past for ever. She was now an out-
cast from heaven above and from the world below, and lies-were
of little consequence to her.
As she stood in the witness-box, one voice rang in her ears
and through her heart with these words of terror: “Oh, Alma,
save me, save me! You know I never meant it!” It was almost
the last voice she heard before the terrible darkness that came
upon her when she felt that her hour was come, and there was
no one to pity her. When at last the darkness cleared and her
reason returned, that voice rang piercineg through all the cham—
bers of her brain, awakening all the bitter misery of the past
months with the added tragedy of that fatal night, and making
her wish she had never been born.
But nature, so inexorably just in exacting debts, is equally just
in paying them, and had in reserve an unsuspected store of wealth
for the unfortunate girl. When she saw the beautiful child for
whose death she had prayed, a fresh spring opened within her,
and she rejoiced over him with the strong passion of her nature.
Once more she had something to love and live for, to devote her-
self to body and soul, something entirely her own, all the more
her own that he was scorned and rejected by others. Her joy in
this innocent creature restored her to health of mind and body,
and deepened her old, never-dying love for the man who had long
ceased to love her—the man whose imploring cry, “Oh, Alma,
save me, save me! ” always rang in her heart.
Mr. Braxton, the counsel for the prosecution, handled this his
favorite witness with the utmost delicacy of his art. To have her
sworn, and say, “I am Alma Lee, etc.; the deceased, Benjamin
Lee, was my father. I last saw him alive on the afternoon of De-
cember 81,” was simple enough, but the difﬁculty was to get any-
thing more from her. It was between four and ﬁve o’clock, she
said, under the dexterous handling of Mr. Braxton—a handling
ﬁercely criticised by Mr. Hawkshaw, and often provoking a battle
royal between the counsel, and obliging Mr. Justice Manby more

than once to cast his truncheon into the arena as a signal to cease
ﬁghting. She was in the wood known as Temple Copse with a
friend. That friend, she admitted reluctantly at length, was her
child‘s father; his name could in no wise be extracted from her.
“Were you in the wood by appointment?” from Mr. Brax-
ton.

“Did the torn letter produced refer to the appointment? "
H Yes."
“ Was it written by the prisoner? ”
Furious onslaught on the part of Mr. Hawkshaw, interposition
of Mr. Justice Manby, and repetition of the question in a diﬁ'erent
form.
“By whom was the letter produced written? ”
Silence on the part of witness. At last, after delicate manipula-
tion on the part of Mr. Braxton, “It was written by the person I
met in the wood.”
Sensation in court, which was crowded, and included a few
ladies of lovely feature and rich attire.
Almacontinued, amid a repetition of skirmishes between the
two counsel, and many rebellions against Mr. Braxton on her own
part, to give the following evidence. She had been standing on
the spot where her father subsequently fell for some minutes with
the mysterious friend, who was dressed in the fatal gray suit, and
carried the stick produced in court. He offered her money for her
child‘s support—a bag of gold. This she had refused many times,
when her father appeared suddenly.
He carried a stick—a rough and heavy staff fresh cut from the
hedge—was angry and excited, dashed the bag of gold to the
ground, stamped on it, and began upbraiding the young man. He
ordered his daughter to leave them, and she did so. She waited
outside the copse, listening, and fearful that something would hap-
pen. She heard voices indistinctly, and at last sounds, like men
struggling. She turned faint, and when she recovered a little there
was silence.
She was returning to the wood, 'when a ﬁgure rushed toward
her, bleeding in the face, the gray suit torn and stained, and
covered with brambles and dead leaves. He said—here the wit—
ness broke down, and wept so bitterly that she could not speak
for some time—he said that he had killed her father by an acci-

dental blow that he had given in defending himself; that Lee had
assaulted him with great violence, of which he bore the mark;
and at last he entreated her to save him. “I promised that I
would never betray him,” said Alma, with calm simplicity, as she
drew her black drapery round her, “and I never will.” , She re-
lated further that she bid him leave the spot quickly, before her
mother returned from Melbourne and met him, and that he did so,
and that she herself regained her home as quickly as possible, and
went to bed, being very ill, and knew and heard nothing of the
search for and discovery of her father’s body until her partial re-
covery weeks later.
The evidence of J udkins was fuller than that he gave at Oldport.
He deposed to seeing Alma enter the wood shortly before Everard
entered it from the opposite direction. Ingram Swaynestone also
witnessed to seeing her, or rather a female form which be supposed
to be hers, among the hazels which bordered the copse, as he rode
up the meadow before he met the gray-suited ﬁgure. Swayne-
stone had often seen the two together in the spring, knew that
Everard visited Mrs. Lee twice a day, and had seen Alma accom-
pany him on his homeward way some distance, in earnest conver-
sation with him. Judkins, in describing these meetings, said, in
the witness~box, “They walked slow and strolling, like people who
keep company.”
All this Alma admitted. Dr. Everard made her accompany him
through a ﬁeld or two sometimes, she said, that she might have fresh
air, which, he said, she needed. He used to give her directions
about her mother, and receive her account of her symptoms; he
used also to ask her about plants, explain them to her, and ask her
to procure him specimens. They could not say much respecting
the symptoms before the woman who helped to nurse Mrs. Lee,
because she was indiscreet, and told all to the patient. Dr. Ever-
ard had given her a hook or some triﬂe every Christmas since she
was six or seven years old.
Alma was told of the peril of concealing a felony, she was
threatened with committal for contempt, she was informed that
she became an accessory to her father’s death after the fact if she
continued to conceal the name of the murderer ; but she was stub-
born, trembling and turning pale at the words “accessory after the
fact.” She was further told that her oath required her not only to
say whether or no the prisoner was the man who dealt the fatal

blow, but to reveal the name of the actual murderer, supposing the
accused to be innocent.
Alma trembled more and more as her examination proceeded;
the heavy air made her giddy and faint, and the unaccustomed ex-
citement and agitation of her terrible position confused her facul-
ties. To the question, “ Had the prisoner, on leaving the wood,
the stickproduced in his hand? " she replied, “ N 0; he was wring-
ing his hands,” and she made similar slips; and, ﬁnally, to the
question, “Is the man who met you in the copse the prisoner in
the dock, or some other man? " she replied, with a sob and a shud-
der, in words that thrilled every ear in the building, “It is the
prisoner.”
When Everard heard these fatal words, he trembled so that he
seemed about to fall; the sweat of agony stood on his brow, and
dabbled the short, curly brown hair that he had pushed over it in
the growing agitation of Alma’s evidence; and the eyes with which
he gazed upon the pale and shuddering witness had a dazed and
ﬁlmy look. In one moment the real truth ﬂashed upon him, illumi-
nated by the lightning of Alma‘s passionate glances, and the whole
history arranged itself dramatically before him in its minutest details
with a vivid distinctness that never more left him.
Glimpses of truth more bitter than death to believe had come
upon him many a time before, only to be driven away by the scorn-
ful incredulity of a loyal and generous nature. As the evidence de-
veloped before him, these glimpses became more frequent and more
diﬂicult to combat, though the hateful suspicions were never dwelt
upon; but now, in that moment of vivid, heart-piercing revelation,
every little suspicious circumstance, unnoticed at the time, rose up
with magic swiftness, and ﬁtted into its natural place in one long
unbroken chain of perfectly sequent, convincing evidence. Words,
gestures, accents, once regarded in such different lights, now showed
clear in one lurid ﬂame; widely ﬂoating reminiscences, conjectures,
hypotheses rushed together in a coherent whole, and 'an awful sense
of the mystery of human iniquity caused Everard’s soul to swoon
within him. A faint groan escaped him, audible, low as it was, in
the startled, momentary silence of the court.
“There is no God,” he said within himself; “there is no good,
no help anywhere.”
After this the trial, which was virtually at an end, seemed to
have no further interest for him. He stood in his dreadful place

like one cruciﬁed, and listened abstractedly to the further proceed-
ings—Allan’s cross-examination, Mr. Braxton’s triumphant, “ That,
my lord, closes the evidence for the prosecution," Mr. Hawkshaw’s
labored and lame address, the few and feeble witnesses for the de-
fense, and the judge’s able and comprehensive summing-up—with a
listless face and a soul full of darkness.
Cyril was not in court when Alma’s examination was thus con-
eluded. He had listened to part of it on the previous day, and then
rushed away, unable to bear it. On this morning he had felt un-
equal to hearing more, and a friend, seeing his condition of mental
unrest, had recommended him to try a brisk walk, promising to tell
him what passed whenever he should return to the vicinity of the
court. Cyril wandered restlessly about, more haggard and feverish
than ever, trying to brace himself to the performance of his obvious
and long-neglected duty, and yet, ‘with the unreason of weak and
sanguine temperaments, hoping against hope that something might
still turn up to absolve him from the necessity before which every
ﬁber of his being shuddered in mortal anguish.
The old-fashioned streets seemed to him like the architecture of
dreams, and the ﬁgures hurrying to and fro had no more reality for
him than the ﬂitting phantoms of a nightmare. The blood throbbed
in his temples like the piston of a steam-engine; he wondered how
his brain had borne its dreadful pressure so long. He wandered
into the sweet, sunny stillness of the close, and strove to calm him-
self by the peaceful suggestions and hallowed associations of the
semi-monastic spot. The voices of children at play came harmoni-
ously over the wall of the canons’ gardens; some quietly dressed
ladies went by; the dean issued from beneath the lovely pointed
arches which formed aporch to the Deanery, and walkedwith a
digniﬁed quiet, free from loitering, across the sunshiny grass. Cyril
looked wistfully at his bland, wholesome, yet delicate face, and re-
marked to himself on the peculiarly English combination of piety
and aristocracy which is the special note of the higher ranks of
Anglican clergy, and wondered whether piety or aristocracy were
the larger ingredient in the mixture so pleasing to some minds.
Years afterward he recalled these idle reﬂections, as people recall
the triﬂes which belong to the critical moments of life and become
stamped upon the memory along with the crises themselves. The
rocks Were busy in the great leaﬂess elms, sailing across the blue
sky, or clustering about the boughs with a confused, reiterated caw-

ing, which recalled the downs of home and the white peace of boy-
hood.
The massive cathedral looked solemnly peaceful in the bright, cold
spring sunshine, which made the ﬂying buttresses and other salient
points cast sharply cut shadows on its gray surface. It seemed to
offer peace to Cyril’s distracted soul, and he left the sunshine and
entered the vast building, soothed for a moment by its shadowy
echoing stillness. Some idea of betaking himself to prayer pos-
sessed him, but he could not collect his thoughts, and he rose from
his knees and paced the echoing aisles, looking up, as if for help,
into the deep shadow of the arched roof. Some organ notes soon
soared thither—a brief prelude; then Mendelssohn’s air, “If with
all your hearts ye truly seek Me.” His fancy supplied the mellow
pathos of a tenor voice to the lovely melody, and he stood beneath
the solid arches of the great Norman transept, wistful and hushed
for a moment.
“Oh that I knew where I might ﬁnd him i ” he echoed.
The air died away, and after a brief pause, one of Bach’s mag-
niﬁcent fugues was thundered forth in complex, ever-increasing
majesty, till it seemed charged with the agony and passion and ex-
nltation of some great war of young and mighty nations, full of the
“confused noise and garments rolled in blood,” which belong to the
warrior’s battle. The tumult echoed through all the recesses of Cy-
ril’s being; it gave an outlet to the stormy agitation within him. He
surrendered himself to the full power of the mighty harmony, glad
to lose himself if but for a moment. But the conﬂict of the contra-
puntal parts harmonized too well with the conﬂict in his soul; it
was no longer a battle of the warrior, but a strife of powers, celes-
tial and infernal.
He covered his face with his hand, leaning against a pillar, and
seemed to see countless legions of warring angels ﬂash in glittering
cohorts over the universe, and then to hear the crash of the counter-
charge of the dusky armies of hell. Now the bright-armored squad-
rons are driven hack, and Cyril’s heart shakes within him. Is hell
stronger than heaven? Shall wrong conquer right? Michael, the
Prince himself, is driven back, and the ﬁend, with the face of marred
but never-forgotten glory, is triumphant. But no; the adamantine
swords ﬂash out again, the dazzling wings cleave the blue ether,
and the vast squadrons of dusky horror are driven back~back into
endless abysscs of chaotic night.

The angel trumpets peal out in heart-stirring triumph, the music
ceases, and Cyril is left alone, his cheek pressed against the chill,
rough stone, and hot tears rushing down his face. Was the angel
combat for a human soul? or was all that tumult of war only the
strife within one narrow human breast? In that case, he felt
he was undone—his will was too weak; evil was too strong for
him. He could ﬁnd no peace, even in that holy: place. He turned
and paced rapidly down the long nave, and offered to a stray sight-
scer, in his abstraction, the striking spectacle of an ascetic-looking
young clergyman wearing his hat in a cathedral.
“Young man,” said the stranger, solemnly accosting him, “ are
you aware that this building is consecrated? ”
Cyril ﬂushed, and tore off his hat, murmuring some words of ex-
planation. Then be rushed out into the sunshine, where he met
his friend. evidently big with tidings.
“ Well?” he asked, his lips growing dry with apprehension.
“ Well, Maitland, I am afraid it is all up with the poor fellow.
There is no doubt now; Alma Lee has confessed all.”
“All?” asked Cyril, steadying himself against the stone lintel
of the side door.
“Yes. She was outside the copse. She heard a struggle; Ev-
erard rushed out, covered with blood, and said he had accidentally
struck the fatal blow in self-defense, and implored her to save
him.”
“Everard? Did she swear that Everard did it?” asked Cyril,-
in a strained, unmusical voice. ‘
“Yes; she swore to him at last. Not that any one ever had
the slightest doubt. Poor fellow! he should have pleaded guilty.
After all, what is accidental homicide in self~defense? "
“What indeed! ” returned Cyril, in the same strange voice,
with an unusual look in his face.
He was silent for a while, and his friend said nothing, sympa-
thizing with his trouble. Then he pulled himself from the lintel
with an effort, and walked quickly away. “ I must go to the court
at once,” he said, with quiet determination.
“I would stay away if I were you,” said the friend, accompany-
ing him nevertheless. “ After all,” he added, with blundering at-
tempts at consolation, “the poor fellow has not been to blame.
As for that entanglement, Maitlaud, you must not judge it from a
clerical point of view. The world smiles on these youthful follies.

As a. medical man in practice, it would have gone against him; but
then, he is not yet in practice, and every one knows that young
blood is not iced. His blunder was in denying it. If he had but
pleaded guilty, Manby would have let him down easily enough.
Such a magniﬁcent girl, tool Few men but Braxton would have
dragged it out of her. She looked like death when she said it. ,
You see, she had sworn to shield him. Fancy letting that out in
the witness-box! ”
“ You see,” interrupted Cyril, suddenly—for this kind of talk
was more than he could bear—“ I am a clergyman, and must look
at these things from a clerical point of view.”
Cyril’s very slight evidence had not been of sufﬁcient importance
to be repeated at the trial; Lilian’s was, however, deemed impor-
tant from its very feebleness and the evident reluctance with which
she gave it. Mr. Braxton was so very sarcastic about her reasons
for disbelieving the evidence of her senses, that even Mr. Justice
Manby, who was human, and touched by Lilian’s gentle and sorrow-
ful dignity—not to speak of her youth and beauty—threw the aegis
of his ofﬁce over her, and pronounced Mr. Braxton’s observations
to be irrelevant.
The other witnesses merely repeated what has already been re-
corded, though with more detail, and all stood cross-examination
well. Mr. Hawkshaw’s endeavors to show that Judkins’s suspi-
cions of Everard were but the forgeries of jealousy, served only to
fasten the imputation more deeply upon the accused. The feigned
handwriting was pronounced by experts to be that of Everard;
they relied greatly upon the formation of a capital T, which was
made in the French manner, '3. Everard smiled mournfully when
he heard this. He thought of the far-off school-time, when he and
the twins had been ﬁrst puzzled and then enchanted by their French
teacher’s T’s; he thought of one wet afternoon, when they got a
gridiron and heated it red-hot, and had a mock-masonic initiation,
of which the house-dog Rover—swathed in a dressing-gown, and
occasionally uttering whines of remonstrance~was Grand Master;
and how they vowed absurd vows, one of which was to be ever
faithful to the persecuted French T. He recalled a solemn discus-
sion at the end of the initiation as to the amount of guilt which
would be incurred by either of the twins in breaking their vows.
Cyril argued that neither of them could singly commit more than
half a crime; and Henry replied that in that case neither ought

singly to eat more than half a dinner. All this happy and guileless
fooling enacted itself again in Everard’s memory while his fate was
being decided in the serious strife of the barristers, who pleaded for
and against his innocence, and made him feel, like Francesca da
Rimini in hell, that “there is no greater pain than remembering
happy times in misery.”
CHAPTER XVIII.
EVERY one felt the defense to be a mere farce, insuﬁicient to
kindle interest, much less hope, even in the prisoner. Little Roa-
lia Grove, the child who saw and spoke with Everard at Long’s
farm between ﬁve and six on the evening of the 31st, was but ﬁve
years old, and, on being produced in the town hall at Oldport, did
nothing but weep bitterly and cling to her father for comfort. His
caresses and remonstrances failed to extract anything from her. He
could only depose that she had shown him a penny just given her
by “a man,” when he came in to tea at six; that she said that the
man wanted Dr. Everard’s parcel, which she had seen her mother
take to the Rectory. »
The appearance of Winnie Maitland’s golden curls in the wit-
ness-box touched people and kindled deep indignation in the breasts
of both judge and jury, who thought the child had been practiced
upon. Her ﬁrst performance was to cry with fright, though she
stated her name and age distinctly, and took her oath properly.
She understood the nature of an oath, she said; her sister Lilian
had explained it to her, and enjoined her to be very careful in what
she said. On being asked what she supposed would be the conse-
quence of her swearing carelessly, she replied that “Henry would
be hanged," an idea she had imbibed from Lennie, during many
anxious consultations with him.
She did not know exactly at what time Everard returned to the
Rectory; it was “about tea-time.” She did not know what clothes
he wore; he was in a great hurry to go up-stairs, to get ready for
dinner. She told him there was no hurry, as it was long before
dinner-time; but he replied that he was not ﬁt to go into the draw-
ing-room. Cross-examined, she said he was “in a dreadful mess,”
words used by Everard. She pleaded for “just one toss,” and he

threw her up in the air and caught her several times. She did not
remember striking him, or coming in contact with him. The hall
in which the playing took place was not well lighted.
All of a sudden he set her down, and said, “ You have done it
now; blinded me." She cried, and made him promise not to tell;
she was always getting into trouble for rough play. He went into
the kitchen, and came out again with raw beef. She followed him
to his room, and he showed her some ﬂowers, and told her to take
them to her sister, and "not to come bothering him any more.”
She was trying so hard to play gently, and she did not know she
touched him. His eye was very bad, but he did all he could to hide
it, and said at dinner that he had knocked it against something.
Granfer, who entered the witness-box with a vague notion that
his conversational powers had at last a worthy sphere, repeated
what he said at Oldport with the same circumlocution and affecte-
tion of stupidity, and parried Mr. Braxton’s questions, and dealt
him cutting rejoinders, with an apparent absence of malice that
drove the Court into ecstasies of mirth. 1
Mr. Maitland and others here witness to Everard’s good reputa-
tion, and also to the frankness with which he spoke of his visits to
Mrs. Lee in the spring—a circumstance which the counsel for the
defense maintained to be incompatible with J udkins‘s suspicions as
to the purpose of those visits.
After listening to Mr. Hawkshaw’s labored, impassioned, but
totally illogical speech for the defense, no creature in the court had
the faintest hope for the prisoner; the only question now was the
sentence. Yet there was one who dared to rely upon the summing-
np, and hope that Mr. Justice Manby would discover some technical
ﬂaw, which might aﬂ'ord aloophole for escape. This person was
Cyril Maitland, who had set out from the cathedral with such in-
tense determination, but whose courage had failed him at ﬁrst sight
of the judge and that terrible array of human faces, which, to his
excited imagination, seemed eager, with a wolﬁsh hunger, for the
shame and misery. of a fellow-creature. There stood his friend,
pilloried before him, the prey of those hungry glances. Cyril‘s
heart bled for him, but he felt that he could never stand there in
his place. That Everard’s head was bowed, and his eyes cast down
beneath that tempest of shame, was only natural; who could stand
before it? .
The judge’s summing-up was brief, terse, and convincing. He

had merely to recapitulate the clear and undisputed evidence—the
plea of alibi was contradicted by Widow Dove’s evidence; the ar-
gument that the prisoner was not the man whom so many witnesses
had seen returning to the Rectory at ﬁve, but that he was at that
moment speaking to Granfer at the wheelwright’s corner, was quick-
ly set aside; the evidence of the aged, semi-imbecile creature was
scarcely to be relied on against that of so many competent witnesses,
including the one who had given evidence with such reluctance; the
attempt to turn the innocence of two young children to his own pur-
poses was spoken of in scathing terms; the prisoner’s nervous and
excited behavior on the evening of the occurrence, and his garbled
account of his injury and strenuous attempts to conceal it, were
pointed out; the jury were ﬁnally exhorted to concentrate their
minds upon the question whether the prisoner did or did not kill
Benjamin Lee, regardless of all other considerations, and to allow
no thoughts of his previous unblemished reputation or tenderness
for his rank and prospects to interfere with their judgment. They
were to consider, the judge said, that although the consequences of
such a crime were undoubtedly tenfold more terrible to one in the
prisoner’s station than to an uneducated man, yet the guilt of one
with such advantages was tenfold greater.
When Mr. Hawkshaw heard this, he knew that not only would
the jury return a verdict against his client, but that the judge would
give him a severe sentence. Yet Cyril hoped; he remembered that
there were twelve men in the jury.
But he did not wait long; a few seconds brought the unanimous
verdict. Guilty of manslaughter—a verdict hailed by a quickly
stiﬂed murmur of approval from the crowded court.
Like a man suddenly stabbed, Cyril sprang;t0 his feet, throwing
up his arms as men only do in uncontrollable agony, and addressed
some wild words to the judge. “Stop! "' he cried; “I have evi-
dence—important evidence. The prisoner is innocent! ”
Mr. Justice Manby, who heard merely a confused outcry, ordered
Cyril‘s removal; Mr. Maitland, thinking his son distracted, pulled
him down, and strove to quiet him; there was an attempt to re-
move him, which was met by promises of good behavior on the
part of thOse around him; and, quiet having been procured, the
judge proceeded to give sentence in the usual form, but with some
ampliﬁcation.
“ Henry Oswald Everard, you have been found guilty,” he said.

THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND. 187
“of a very cruel and pitiless crime ; whether it was a murder com-
mitted by deliberate and malicious intention, or merely a homicide
done in the heat of anger after considerable provocation, is known
only to yourself and your Maker. By the laws of your country you
have been convicted of the lesser crime, and it is my painful duty
to sentence you for that crime.” He went on to say how very pain~
ful he found that ’duty, and to expatiate upon the prisoner’s advan-
tages, the pious and reﬁned home in which he was brought up, his
liberal education, the power which his scientiﬁc knowledge gave
him, the advantages derived from his father’s honorable name and
social standing, the manner in which he was trusted and admitted,
a wolf in sheep’s clothing, to the poor man‘s home. He spoke of
the dead man’s integrity, the respect in which he was held by all
who knew him; of his only child’s fair fame and defenseless condi-
tion, and pointed out the great wickedness and cruel meanness of
the prisoner’s conduct with regard to her, and dwelt much upon
the father‘s grief and just anger. He spoke also of the prisoner‘s
physical advantages, his young manhood and muscular strength,
and contrasted these with Lee’s comparative age and stiffness; he
alluded to the murderous character of the stick which dealt the fa-
tal blow, and to the prisoner's anatomical knowledge which taught
him how to deal it. Those who knew Mr. Justice Manby had seen
him come down hard upon prisoners before, but they had never
known him so hard. He had once given a wife-killer, a man who
had put the climax to years of cruel torture by stamping a little too
hard on his slave and killing her, ﬁve years, and people had been
aghast; precisely similar cases in other parts of the country had
got six weeks or a twelvemonth, or even two years. But recently
the papers had been sarcastic upon the wife-beaters‘ short sentences,
and upon a prevailing tone of Victor-Hugo sentimentality toward
criminals, and Mr. Justice Manby had felt the righteousness of their
. strictures, and remembered them in dealing with Everard. “ I shall
therefore give you,” he concluded, “the severest sentence which
the law allows—twenty years penal servitude.”
The sentence fell upon Everard like a blow; he staggered under
it, swerved aside, and clutched at the woodwork of the dock to
steady himself, while hot drops sprang upon his brow. At the
7 same instant, as if under the same blow, a cry rang through the
court, and a man fell down senseless. It was Cyril Maitland.
Everard lifted his head at the cry, and saw what happened,

scarcely heeding it in his agony; he saw Lilian, marble pale but
quiet, catch her brother in her arms, and that touched him with an
ineﬂ‘able pity for her through his desperate anguish. He scarcely
heard the question if he had anything to say against his sentence,
but, on being roused, replied in a dazed way, “I am not guilty, my
lord.”
Then he was taken from his pedestal of shame, and led away
into the terrible darkness of twenty years’ ignominy and hopeless
suffering, bereft at one stroke of everything—name, fame, fortune
(for in those days a. felon’s property was forfeited), love, liberty,
and hope. 1
In a moment he saw his life as it was but yesterday, before Fate
wove its dreadful mesh round him, a life of honorable and useful
toil, full of noble ambition, beautiful enthusiasm, and honest striv-
ing; rich with the promise of love and domestic peace; happy with
friendship and family affection; adorned with culture and scientiﬁc
research; and rich, above all, with trust in human goodness and
divine mercy. He was now bereft of all, even of his faith. God,
if there were a God, had forsaken him; man had betrayed and de--
sorted him. The remembrance of Cyril’s almost feminine piety
sickened his soul. He saw him kneeling before the picture of the
Cruciﬁxion with deadly guilt upon him; heard him leading the
simple family worship on the day when he went forth in treachery
to take the life of a man he had wronged; heard his impassioned,
half-hysterical sermon on Innocents' Day; saw him dealing the
very Bread of Life to himself and Lilian ; remembered the message
he had sent him during his detention, “ He shall make thy right-
eousness clear as the light, and thine innocence as the noouday”;
and broke forth in curses on all canting hypocrites who make relig-
ion a cloak for evil deeds.
And he had loved this man so well, trusted and revered him,
fed his ‘soul on his moral beauty. That was the sharpest stab in
the confusion of pain that poured upon him. And Marion loved
him, and Lilian, and the guileless family at Melbourne; and if Cyril
should turn and repent even now at the eleventh hour, what would
come of it but shame and misery to those he loved so tenderly?
Should he denounce him himself—he, the convict? No; that
would only double the anguish of all those innocent hearts, and per-
haps avail nothing. If he had but suspected beforel but now it
was too late.

Soon he would stand in his jailer’s presence, stripped of his
very garments, no longer a man, but a thing; called no more by a
name, but a number; beggared in mind, body, and soul; and a
stony despair possessed him. Mr. Hawkshaw thought he might got
ﬁve years, he told him, and ﬁve years, or even ten, left some small
room for hope. After ﬁve years, youth would not be utterly gone;
he might still bridge over the gap in his life. He might go to some
new world and begin over again, wasted by imprisonment, with
ﬁve precious years lost, but still in the prime of his faculties. But
twenty years shut out all hope—twenty years of early manhood
and maturity, cut off from all sources of mental activity, from all
knowledge of the world and life, the echoes of whose onward r011-
ing wheels could never reach him; chained to manual toil; herded
with the scum and oE-scouring of vice and misery. Supposing
that he survived this awful fate, what could he expect to be at the
end i .
He was glad now that none of his friends save Mr. Maitland and
George Everard had seen him since his arrest. His fate was beyond
the reach of sympathy or help; the only thing now was to keep its
contamination to himself. He refused to take leave of any one.
George had irritated him by untimely exhortations, by gifts of tracts,
and a disbelief in his innocence, or rather, a stubborn assumption
that he was guilty on all counts, which astonished him beyond meas-
ure; Marion sent her love, and would see him “if he wished ”;
his father and two brothers were still abroad; and his married sis-
ters agreed with their husbands that Henry was dead to them.
But Mr. Maitland procured an interview after the conviction,
and was accompanied by Lilian. The meeting was brief and
agonized. Lilian’s marvelous self-control kept her outwardly calm,
while the calm of utter despair quieted Everard. He bid her forget
him, think of him as dead; reminded her that she had her life to
live in the outside world; and hoped she would open her heart to
newer and happier affections. Lilian replied that she never could
and never would forget the one love of her life; that the cruel fate
which separated them for twenty years could not cancel the bond
between them, which was eternal. “Besides,” she added, with a
sorrowful smile, “your innocence may yet be proved.” ’
“My poor Lilian,” he returned, thinking how bitter such a proof
would be for her, “ we must not venture to hope for that."
“I shall pray for it night and day,” replied Lilian; “ and, in the

mean time, do not forget me, Henry. Remember the morning in
the wood, and all that you promised me.”
He turned his face away, and could not speak for some time;
and Lilian continued in her quiet way to tell him how grieved Cyril
would be to have missed seeing him, and how terribly he had suf-
fered by his friend’s calamity. Lilian had only left his bedside for
the short time granted her to bid farewell to Everard, for Cyril was
at death’s door. He had not ceased raving since he recovered from
the fainting-ﬁt into which the passing of Everard’s sentence threw
him. All this Everard heard with the same stony calmness, which
was shaken only by the ineffable pity he felt for Lilian. It would
be better for her if Cyril should die, he thought, though for himself
it would cut off the last possibility of escape from dishonor. He
sent a tender message to Marion, thanked Mr. Maitland for all his
kindness, and then it was time for his friends to go.
“I shall never forget you, Henry,” Lilian said, as their hands
were clasped in a last farewell. “ I have but one life and one love.
Twenty years’ suﬁ'ering will not make me love you less. I can never
forget you—never."
Lilian’s ﬁrm lip quivered, as she spoke these words in a voice
the natural music of which was enhanced by the deepest mingling
of love and sorrow, and the quiver recalled to Henry’s mind the
pitiful trembling he had often seen in Cyril’s mouth, the sign of a
fatal inherent weakness of purpose. The sharpening of her features,
and the pallor consequent on mental suffering and intense emotion,
further increased Lilian’s likeness to her twin brother, and Everard
felt his heart rent in twain by a tumult of conﬂicting feelings as he
took his last long look at the sorrowful, beloved face.
He could reply only by a look which haunted Lilian ever after,
and by a closer pressure of the beautiful adored hand, and then he
heard the doors shut with a dreadful heart-crushing sound behind her.
In that moment of exquisite anguish his stony despair gave way,
for the farewell between true lovers can never be all pain, and a
holier though deeper agony shook his heart, mingled with a rush of
the old pity and affection for his friend, and a thousand thoughts
and feelings poignant with joy as well as sadness, and he dropped
his head upon his hands and cried as Englishmen, and even English
boys, rarely cry. He never shed such tears again, though the time
came when he would have given worlds for the power of such a
passionate outburst.

Lilian also broke down when the door closed upon the unfortu-
nate prisoner, and wept, regardless for once of her father‘s feelings,
unrestrained by the presence of the stolid and indiiferent prison
ofﬁcials, to all of whom a woman’s tears were a too-familiar sight,
until she regained her brother’s room, and took her part in placing
ice on his burning head, and listening to his incessant ravings of bat-
. tles and music and churches, and his frequent calls to Lilian to pro-
tect him from some shadowy and awful terror. Then Lilian would
lay her hands gently and ﬁrmly upon him, and tell him she was
there, and nothing should hurt him; and then sometimes a dim
glimmering of consciousness would return to his wild and vacant
gaze for a moment, and he would be quieter for a time; til] at last,
after a long and weary time, one day, when Lilian felt that her
strength was quite at an end, he looked up with a glance of recog-
nition and spoke her name.
Then they were told that he would live, but whether his reason
would ever return to him depended greatly upon his treatment dur-
ing convalescence.

PART II
“A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience.”
CHAPTER I.
Tm: full glory of late summer brooded in afternoon stillness owes
me golden harvest-ﬁelds, the gray dreamy downs, the deep-shad-
owed woods, and the soft azure glimpses of sea around Malbourne.
Everything seemed wrapped in rich, delicious luxury. lmprovident
boys reveled in blackberries, and stormed their friends’ heavy-laden
fruit-trees; while provident squirrels watched the swelling acorns
and hazel-nuts, and prepared little granaries for storing them when
ripe. The sun had drawn the richest tones of color from evbrything
—from the ruddying apple and purpling plum; from the brown-gold
corn and brilliant wayside ﬂowers; from the dark green woods and
purple clover patches; from the bronzed faces and limbs of the
laborers and children; from the cottage gardens, bright with scar-
let-runner, vegetable marrow, and rich fruit. Passing down the
village street, you could scarcely see the thatched cottages for the
ﬂowers about them, the gay hollyhocks standing like homely senti-
nels among the red snapdragons, geraniums, carnations, and gilly-
ﬂowers; while the Rectory grounds were gay with their fullest
bloom, and the redspur valerian climbed over the low church-yard
wall, and red poppies blazed through the corn, which stood ready
for the sickle on the other side.
The yellow lichens and stonecrop on the gray spire and tiled
roof of the church glowed intensely in the sleepy sunshine, into
which a warm haze had brought a ruddy tint, and the blue sky
gazed, softened and dreamy, through the same hazy veil. Down
from the belfry, standing there in the sweet blue, fell the slow,

drowsy chime of the three old mellow bells, and ﬂoated pleasantly
over the quiet, basking ﬁelds, where cows stood withdrawn beneath
the trees, chewing contentedly, with lazily winking eyes and whisk-
ing tails; and the horses fed serenely, not knowing that they would
have to drag all that rich harvest home before long; and the little
brook babbled faintly because of the great heat which consumed it.
Service was over, and people were straggling home through
ﬁelds, or lounging at garden gates in idleness and Sunday clothes,
though the full male toilet was subdued by a tendency to shirt-
sleeves., Granfer was holding forth to a select circle outside the
low wall of the church-yard, where he was wont to bask in the sun,
like some novel species of lizard, the summer long. Farmer Long
was wending his way slowly homeward with his family, full of
thought. He had decided to out his ﬁrst wheat-ﬁeld, half a mile oif,
on the morrow, and lol he saw that the corn through which they
were passing was over-ripe and crying out for the sickle.
Farmer Long was puzzled. Ile could not think why Providence
made the corn ripe all at once, when it was obvious that it could
not all be cut, much less carried, at the same time. “ You may
depend upon it,” his wife told him, “Providence have got plenty
to do without thinking 0’ your earn, Long. Cutting of it and carry-
ing is our lookout. All Providence have to do is to put it there
for us, and thankful we must be there’s any to cut.” Which Mr.
Long reﬂected upon over his pipe after tea, not without a remote
inward conviction that he would have made better arrangements
himself.
Sunday afternoon is the great time for sweethearting. Many a
shy couple detached itself from the straggling parties going home-
ward, and wandered off through wood and ﬁeld-paths and green
lanes, for the most part silent, but contented, if not happy, and full
of more unspoken poetry than the world dreams of.
It is a melancholy time for the forsaken or scorned swain, who
cocks his felt hat in vain, and whose bunch of carnation or holly-
hock, jauntily stuck in his hat-band, avails him nothing in the eyes
' of the cruel fair. It was the hour when Charles J udkins’s misplaced
passion gave him the most exquisite pangs; an hour which he usu-
ally spent in solitary brooding, chieﬂy by the brook-side, where he
was wont to lean on a certain stile, shaded appropriately by willows,
and “pore upon the brook that babbled by,” just like the unfortu-
nate youth in Gray‘s “Elegy.” And let no prosaic child of culture,

who has outlived the young days when there was nothing so sweet
as the misery of crossed love, think scorn of our friend, or laugh at
true love because it wears livery or top-boots. A garb more anti-
pathetic to romance than that of a spruce groom’s livery scarcely
exists, but it could not kill the romance in Charlie J udkins’s honest
breast. He was dreaming of what might have been but for the sin
of one bad man. i
A pretty cottage ﬁlled his mind’s eye, a cottage with a porch
and honeysuckle and roses, standing in a garden, not too far from
the Swaynestone stables, with bee-hives and ﬂowers, and fruit, and
vegetables, all grown by himself in leisure hours. Inside he dreamed
a neat parlor, with a clock, a sofa, and a carpet. In a low chair,
by the window or ﬁre according to season, he saw a beautiful
woman, with rich, dark eyes which brightened at his step, and
damask cheeks which took a deeper glow at his return. There
she would be with her needle, busy, happy, honored, loving, and
loved.
Charlie‘s eyes clouded so with tears that the vision vanished,
and only the brown brook, with its imprisoned sunbeams, met his
sorrowful gaze. But the Malbourne bells pealed drowsily on, as he
had so often dreamed they would peal for his wedding, when he
should issue from the familiar porch, the proudest and happiest of
men, with Alma—dear Alma—in all her rich beauty, on his arm.
He turned hastily away, dashing the foolish moisture from his
honest blue eyes, and struck aimlessly along the foot-path, thinking
how her life, sorely awry as it was, might yet be put straight. “If
I could only see her happy and respected again! " was his thought,
as he strode along, consumed by no selﬁsh grief. Presently he
stopped at a gate, half overgrown with briar and hawthorn, and
saw a sight which ﬁlled him with the tenderest emotion.
On the other side of the brook, in a grassy corner between a
coppiee and a ﬁeld of ripe wheat which rose upward from the banks
of the little stream, was Alma herself, sitting on a felled tree, and
watching the play of a child at her feet on the grass. Her shawl
and bonnet were thrown aside, and her plain, well-ﬁtting, black
dress showed her beautiful form to the best advantage. There was
now a statuesque majesty about her which matched well with the
tragedy never absent from her proud, deﬁant eyes. That habitual
expression which goes so far toward making up the identity of a
human being was so changed in Alma, and her features were so

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 195
sharpened by her terrible experience of life, that to any eye but
that of love she was no longer the same girl as she who had ridden
home in the gray winter gleaming, happy and innocent, to the rustic
music of the Wagon-bells.
The dark green of the coppice and the deep gold of the corn ris-
ing behind her gave her a picturesque background, while the beauti-
ful boy playing in the grass at her feet made such a foreground as
any artist must have loved. The child was dressed daintin in white,
with blue ribbons, and with wreaths of pink convolvolus wouud
about him. Alma had placed a bunch of scarlet poppies in her own
dress to attract his eye, and was looking at him with a mournful,
impassioned gaze, while he held up a tiny ﬁnger and bid her hark
to the music of the wedding-bells, which were ringing to honor
the return of Oyril Maitland and his young bride to England and to
Malbourne, where they arrived only the night before.
Two springs had scattered ﬂowers on Ben Lee’s untimely grave
in Malbourne church-yard, two summers had thrown their golden
glory upon it, and the months which softened the hard letters on
his headstone, and braided the turfy mound above him with mosses,
had strengthened and developed the round limbs and brought intel-
ligence to the bright eyes of the second Ben Lee, whose innocent
life began so dolorously where his grandfather’s had ended tragic-
ally.
It pleased Alma to fancy resemblances to her father in the in-
fant’s sWeet face, and the tenderest feeling in her life now was the
occasional fancy that the child’s beauty and pretty ways might have
soﬁened her father’s heart, and perhaps have induced him to pardon
the dishonor she had brought on his honest home. She dreamed of
their going away to some new. place, where they were not known,
and where she might pass as a widow, and do her best to atone for
the evil past. Or, at least, he might have loved the child, if he
could not have forgiven her.
But harder and more bitter thoughts were passing through
Alma’s mind, as she sat by the brook that sunny afternoon, and
smiled mournfully on the laughing child, and heard his soft prattle
mingled with the babbling brook‘s slow song and the lingering chime
of Cyril Maitland’s wedding-bells.
She was thinking how she would like to go away, far away to
some unfamiliar land, where her sin and sorrow were unknown,
and where she might begin life afresh, and earn a good name and

\
honorable up-bringing for her son. Ilcr step-mother had, as she
expressed it, washed her hands of her after her father’s death, and
she lived alone in a humble cottage lodging, trying to earn her
bread by her needle, or, indeed, by any industry that lay within
her power, and hoping in time to live down her reproach.
But it was not so easy to get work in Melbourne. All classes
shunned her; even the gentle Rector, who would otherwise have
given her a helping hand, could not overcome his horror of the
woman who had betrayed Henry Everard to so terrible a fate, and
wished her away from his parish, oﬁ'ering, indeed, to help her, if
she would but go.
Still Alma clung to the spot which held her parents’ graves, and
fought manfully against the wall of prejudice which rose around
her, eating the bread of tears and bitter humiliation in secret, though
she met the averted faces or contemptuous words of her former
friends with heroic calm in public, but got scarcely any work. Ben
Lee had put by a considerable sum of money for one in his station,
and this was divided by his will between his wife and his daughter.
Upon this little capital Alma had been living, till she woke to the
mournful conviction that there was no bread for her to win in Mal-
bourne, and also that a day would soon come when her patrimony
would be exhausted.
Money found its way mysteriously to her cottage—money from
a source well known to her—for the child’s support; but Alma
scorned to use it, and, being unable to return it without betraying
the giver, put it aside for the infant’s use in case of her death or
any emergency. Like most women of any force of character, who
are thrown on their own resources, after a. time she began to realize
how feeble a being one woman is against a world of strong men
and iron prejudices and cruel convictions. She could defy the world,
but she could not conquer it. She was too ignorant to quarrel with
the social arrangements which handicap the weakness of sex with
extra weights, and brand its errors as crimes, but a dim sense of
injustice struggled within her, and still further confused the moral
perceptions already confused by error and crime.
She knew she could not expect Heaven’s aid, with the crime\of
unrepenth perjury upon her soul; but, before the heavy hour when
she stood in the sight of God and man and swore away the honor
and liberty of an innocent man, she had had gleams of penitence,
when she had hoped to make her peace with Heaven, and lead a

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 197
holy life. After that further plunge into crime, she could hope for
no mercy unless she undid her dreadful deed.
But though Alma went to church and prayed for the helpless
child, who could not pray for himself, and hoped at least to place
his little feet on the heavenward road, she ‘thought daily less of
heaven, and was fast sinking into the dreadful practical atheism to
which sin leads—the atheism which, because it sins on unavenged,
cries,‘ “Tushl God doth not regard,” and ﬁnally blots the Maker
out of the universe altogether.
g Alas, poor Alma! she was made for a nobler destiny, and her
honest lover, seeing her there, with her mournful gaze and heroic
beauty, felt his heart thrill with a vague sense that, in spite of her
frailty, she was not unworthy of his passionate adoration. His
heart told him what his untutored mind never could, that hers was
no common frailty, but the lapse of an exceptionally noble nature
led astray, and all his hope was to set her up again on the pedestal
whence a villain’s art-s had hurled her.
So absorbed was she in melancholy musing that for a long time >
she did not observe him, and he enjoyed apensive rapture in the
mere sense of her presence and the sight of her tragic beauty, so
well set off by the glowing hues of the golden corn, with the pop-
pies blazing through it, by the dark wood, and by the bright appear-
ance of the pretty child in his ribbons and ﬂowers. He would have
liked some enchanter to ﬁx them there for ever, while the child
and the brook babbled, the bees bummed, the grasshopper uttered
his shrill note of joy, and the bells pealed on from the hidden tower.
He watched the changes of her face with compassionate yearning;
he saw the pain deepen in it. She was thinking of that morning’s
experience.
She had been on her way to church as usual, a solitary ﬁgure in
the straggling crowd of friends and neighbors, when those in front
of her pressed back from the lych- gate to let a group of gentlefolk
pass, and Alma found herself one of a little line of church-goers,
with whom they exchanged greetings. Mrs. Maitland and Lilian
came ﬁrst, then Cyril and Marion, lastly the children; Alma made
her curtsey with her usual proud humility, looking her superiors in
the face with haughty calm.
Cyril recognized hisold friends with the glances which he knew
so well how to distribute, missing Alma’s face with the ease and
naturalness of good breeding; but Marion’s eye lighted on the bean!

tiful face of the ruined girl, and Alma never forgot the hot-ﬂush of
shame and the start of shuddering aversion with which she turned
to her husband, pressing close to his side as if for protection, or
the exquisite tenderness of the look Cyril gave her, as he returned
the pressure on his arm, and quickened his pace to lead Marion
away from the sight which so distressed her. The burning blood
sprang to Alma’s face, her temples throbbed wildly, and, in the
tumult of mingled passion which convulsed her, the impulse of a
tigerish fury surged up, and bade her rush before Marion’s face, and
hurl her to the ground with one blast of truth shouted out in the
ears of the little public standing near.
In ﬁve words she could bring Marion’s pride for ever to the dust,
and blight all the happiness of her life. But the impulse sank amid
the roar of other passions, and Alma remained outwardly quiet,
passing sedater up the church-yard path among the others, into
the cool, hushed church, where the words of benediction and hope
sounded in vain for her.
The poignant memory of Marion’s look made her eyes ﬂash and
her bosom heave in the sunny stillness by the brook-side, and with a
deep sigh and a gesture of pain she looked up and met poor Charlie’s
adoring gaze.
In a moment the gate on which he leant was cleared, the bit of
meadow crossed, the brook leapt, and he stood before her, joyously
welcomed by the child, who had too few friends not to appreciate
this one, to whom he owed many a toy and cake and still more wel-
come game of piay.
“Alma,” J udkins cried, taking olf his hat that the child might
play with its gold band, “ dear, dear Alma, it cuts into my heart to
see you looking so sorrowful.” V
“ Never mind me, Charlie,” she replied, with a wan smile. “I
brought it all on myself, and no one can help me. Go away, please;
it will do neither of us any good to be seen together.”
“One minute, Alma,” he protested; “let me speak out once
more. I love you so true, Alma, so true; I can‘t give you up.
Let bygones be bygones, and do you try to care for me. It's what
your poor father always wished, my dear, and what might have
been if villains— It’s bygones, Alma, bygones, and can’t be helped
anyway now; but you med have taken me in time, if that hadn’t
come between us, and you med be happy yet. I’ll be a good hus-
band; I’ll be a father to that innocent child that is fond of me al_

ready. In another place nobody need know he isn’t mine, and I’ll
never bring up the past again you—never. There’s a many have
begun life similar, and no trouble between them.”
“ It would be wronging you, Charlie,” replied Alma; “you are
too good for the like of me. I could never care for you as a wife
ought. I loved too true once, and I can never love any more. We
'are only young once, and we can only love once,” she said, express-
ing Lilian’s thought in other words. “ N 0, Charles, I mustn’t take
advantage of you; you must go and forget me."
“Look here, Alma! that’s true about only loving once; and do
you think, if I couldn‘t forget you after what has come between us,
I ever could now? No, my dear. I love you true, and ever shall,
and all I want is to make you happy, that has been wronged.”
Alma burst into tears, and bid him not think too well of her, for
that she had grievously sinned.
“And if we are only young once, you are still young,” he con-
tinued; “ you have a deal of life yet to live, and no soul to look to
but me. And he is as good as dead, and that makes a difference.
Take me, Alma, and you’ll maybe get fender of me than you think.
Consider the child, too. You’ll never get work in Melbourne; and
how’ll you get it where you are not known?”
Alma was crying bitterly; he had never seen her in so accessible
a mood before.
“I mean to go away,” she sobbed.
Then J udkins unfolded his cherished project before her. “ Come
right away with me, my dear; come to America, where we can
begin over again fresh, and no soul to cast anything up against us;
and you may be happy and honored—ay, and more thought of than
people so humble as us can ever hope to be in the old country.
I’ve a sister there, out West, married and went out four years ago;
and they are rich people now, with more land of their own than
Sir Lionel ever had, and all their own doing. There’s land to be
got almost for the asking, and nothing wanting but a pair of stout
hands to make it covered with crops such as never grow in poor
old England. Think, my dear, if this corn-ﬁeld here and half a
dozen more was all ours, and we married, with a comfortable house
and horses and garden, and our own wood to burn, and cattle and
poultry, besides the wild game, to feed us, and nothing known agen
us, how happy we might be! My sister’s husband, he’s a great man

Benjy would thrive out in the woods, and grow up to have land 01
his own, and never know but I was his father. And he should
share equal with others as might be sent us, he should. I never do
nothing by halves, Alma; and if I said that boy was my son, my
son he should be, you may depend upon it. I’ve spoken to Sir
Lionel about it, and he has wrote to several that manage about
ships and expenses and all that; and I’ve a tidy bit of money put
by, and my sister, she writes every year, and recommends me to
come out West; and there’s no tie to keep me here, and you’ve
only to say the word, and we’d have the banns up next Sunday;
and I’d give warning to-morrow, for I’m tired of service, though
Sir Lionel’s is the best, and ready to leave the land where I’ve seen
so much trouble, and we'd be married, and maybe started from
Liverpool, this day ﬁve weeks. Alma dear, I can’t go and leave
you; and you wouldn’t blight my prospects and keep me back—ay,
and the child—from making my fortune, would you?”
“You are a good man, Charles Judkins,” replied Alma, dry-
ing her eyes; “you deserve better than to be hampered with
such as me. You might ﬁnd a good girl out there you cOuld
marry.” I
There was a wistful look in Alma’s eyes, that emboldened Jud-
kins to paint their future in still more glowing terms, and urge his
suit more ardently than ever; and the end was that, when they
strolled slowly back toward Alma’s cottage in the ruddying sunshine,
a bunch of white stephanotis and maidenhair from the Swaynestone
conservatories had strayed from Charlie’s coat to Alma’s black dress,
and Alma’s scarlet poppies drooped in glowing langnor on the
young fellow’s honest breast, while the boy’s bright head lay sleep-
ing on his arm.
The bellshad ceased now, and the swallows were sweeping
round the gray belfry, bathed in sunlight, and uttering their pecul-
iar twitter. Wider and wider grew the circles they made, now in
search of prey, now in chase of each other, now in mere delight in
airy motion, over the Rectory roof and across the lawn, where a
pleasant group was gathered, to one of whom their sunny breasts
and curving ﬂight brought sorrowful thoughts of a lonely prisoner,
for whom she had translated Grossi’s exquisite “Rondinella Pelle-
grina” long ago.
“Oh se anch ’io! ma lo contende
Quests bassa angusta volts,

' Dove ’1 sole non risplcnde,
Dove ’l aria ancor m’e tolta,
Donde a to la mia favclla
Giunge appena, oh, rondinellal”
she was murmuring inwardly, as her glance followed the birds of
happy liberty in their graceful gyrations against the lucid sky.
Lilian was making tea at a rustic table beneath the lindens on
the lawn ; Mrs. Maitland lay on a couch near her; Marion reclined
in slow-slung hammock, with one slender foot touching the turf
as she swayed to and fro; Cyril lounged in a low garden chair
close at hand, very much at his case, yet ready to hold her cup and
plate, and do her bidding; Mr. Maitland, placid and reveling in the
thought that he need preach no more for a week, had another gar-
den lounge, and asked for his third cup of tea; Lennie lay on his
back, staring at the sky, with one leg crossed over the other, and
pointing heavenward; while Winnie’s golden curls were straying
over the shoulder of Ingram Swaynestone, who sat near Lilian,
and held the child leaning against him encircled by one arm, while
he watched the graceful movements of the tea-maker, and delighted
in the slim beauty of her hands.
Some stone fruit and a cluster of purple and one of white grapes
on the tea-table made a splendid center of color beneath the golden
green of the sunlit lindens. It was a sweet and happy scene, peace-
ful, contented, and free, very different from the solitary prison-cell
which the swallows suggested to Lilian’s imagination. They had
been talking as people talk over tea-tables; Cyril had given some
droll accounts of things which had amused him in his recent travels.
There had been happy laughter and jesting, and now a pleasant
silence, which no one wished to break, had fallen on the little
party.
I Then it was that Winnie had one of her startling visitations of
thoughtfulness, and burst out as follows, in her clear, high treble:
“ Papa, I wonder how Alina Lee likes having to go to
hell? ” '
“ My dear little girl, what are you talking about? ” returned the
gentle rector, startled out of his peaceful day-dream.
“ Well, you see, she must go there,” protested Winnie, with deep
earnestness; “it can’t be helped now she has broken two command-
ments—the third and the ninth.”

“ Hush, dear! ” said Lilian; “ you must not talk of such things.
Besides, let us hope poor Alma. repents.”
“How can she repent with poor Henry still in prison?” de-
manded Winnie, ﬁercely lifting her head and tossing back her golden
mane.
" We must, at least, hope that poor Alma will repent before she
comes to die, dear,” said Mr. Maitland; “ but it is not for any one,
least of all one so young as you, to judge her. But you may pray
for her.”
“ Besides,” added Mrs. Maitland, “we do not know that Alma
has broken those commandments.”
“Oh, don’t we, though I ” cried Lennie, throwing himself round
to face his mother; “ when she told all those lies about Henry and
his gray suit. Why, Henry changed his clothes before lunch, be-
cause he got them dirty walking with Lilian.”
“ If Henry changed his clothes before luncheon, Lennie,” said
Cyril, quietly, “why did you not say so at the time? ”
“ Lennie’s memory is scarcely to be trusted after so great a lapse
of time,” said his father. “ He probably thought the circumstance
possible and desirable, and then came to accept it unconsciously as
a fact. Moreover, is it probable that such a circumstance would
escape every one’s notice but Lennie’s? "
“Dear father,” interposed Lilian, “can you recall what Henry
wore on that fatal day? I never could; there is so little variety 'in
gentlemen’s dress. Did Marion remember? ”
Marion was crying at the memory of those harrowing events.
“I remember perfectly,” she replied, “that Henry wore a black
coat at luncheon that day. He got some mustard on the cuff, and
I helped him take it off.”
“Why did you never say so?” cried'Lilian. “ Oh, Marion, you
and Lennie might have saved him! ”
“You are very cruel, Lilian, to say such a thing!” returned
Cyril, with an angry ﬂash in his blue eyes. “Henry’s dress at
luncheon would have proved nothing with regard to his subsequent
dress, although it is plain enough to us that he would not have
changed again. You should not put such harrowing thoughts into
Marion’s mind. I thought, too, that this painful theme was not to
be discussed.”
“Well, Alma will have to go to hell all the same,” returned
Lennie, with conviction. “I don’t care,” he added, on being re-

buked by Cyril for his sweeping judgment and strong language;
“it’s in the Bible about liars having their part in ﬁre and brim-
stone, and with all your preaching you can’t preach it out.”
Cyril pressed his hand to his side with the old gesture, and a
low moan escaped him. His face was gray with pain, and the drops
of anguish stood on his brow. “I can not bear this," he gasped.
“My poor boy! ” sighed Mr. Maitland; “ we have been too cruel
in re-opening this deadly wound. Come with me. Come, Marion,
dry your eyes. I want to show you my bees, real Ligurians; and
you must tell me, both of you, what you think of my hives.”
They strolled away accordingly, leaving the remainder of the
tea-party, and particularly the youthful preacher, Lennie, aghast.
“Mrs. Maitland,” asked Ingram Swaynestone, who had by no
means enjoyed this unexpected airing of the family skeleton, “ when
are you going to muzzle this brat? "
CHAPTER II.
Jusr then a lusty baritone voice was heard in the lane, which
was sunk out of sight between the Rectory and N orthover grounds,
singing joyously—
“ Maxwelton braes are bonnie,
'Where early his the dew,
And 'tis there that Annie Laurie
Gied me her promise true—
Gied me her promise true,
Which ne’er forgot will be;
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
I’ll lay me doon and dee."
“ Catch him deeing,” observed Ingram, sarcastically.
“A precious rum song for a Sunday,” added Lennie, whose vir-
tuous frame of mind was rather trying in its intensity.
“ I’d lay me doon and dee,” sang the unconscious minstrel at the
'7 very top of his compass.
“ No you wouldn’t,” Lennie shouted.
Then they walked across the lawn, peeped over the hedge, and
saw J udkins stepping gaily homeward, with Alma’s scarlet poppies

in his coat. Judkins looked up, startled, and stopped, blushing, in
the emission of his highest note.
“I beg your pardon, Mr. Swaynestone," he replied, respectfully ‘
saluting; “ but indeed I would.”
“ Well, I think you would, J udkins, you foolish fellow,” returned
Ingram, laughing. “ What is the meaning of this festive cheer, may
1 ask? Why rouse the echoes of Melbourne with the sounds of riot
and mirth? ”
“Sir,” replied J udkins, “ I’m engaged to be married. To-morrow
I give warning, and in ﬁve weeks’ time I hope to sail for America.”
“Let me recover, Lennie,” said Ingram, after having congratu-
lated the fortunate swain, and sent him on his way. “And look
here, young one, not a word of this to any one. ' And please to re-
member that tragedies are not discussed over tea-pots, and ladies
are not supposed to know anything unpleasant, and, above all, that
people never publicly allude to their relations when in gaol.”
“"l‘wasn’t me; ’twas Win began it," growled Lennie. “Be-
sides, you are nobody. You are always here at tea-time. You are
going in for Lilian, it‘s my belief. You do nothing but stare at her
like a great gowk.” ‘
“ You are a promising young party, upon my word,” observed
Ingram, picking him up by the jacket collar. “ Marvyn should whop
you more.”
So saying, he carried the struggling boy back to the tea-drinkers
and deposited him in the fork of a tree, where he bid him remain,
under pain of chastisement, while he and Winnie aimed handker-
chiefs and other missiles at him, unmindful for a moment of Alma
Lee’s aﬁ'airs.
Lilian was trying to get Mark Antony to accept a saucer of
cream, on which the haughty favorite perpetually turned his back,
or rather tail, with cool disdain; while Snip and Snap watched it
with eager eyes, knowing that Mark’s ﬁnal rejection of the dainty
would consign it to them.
“ There are moments,” said Ingram, who watched the scene
with a sort of impatient interest, “ when a man might envy a
cat.”
Lilian assured him that there was plenty of cream in the dairy,
if he would like some; and Mr. Maitland and Marion returned—the
latter still looking troubled—when it became painfully apparent to
Mr. Swaynestone that he had already lingered longer in the fam-

ily circle than he should have done, and he regretfully took his
leave.
Lilian looked after him with a half»pained gaze as he went to
the gate, accompanied by her father; then she returned to Marion.
“ Where is Cyril? ” she asked. '
“It is his hour for private devotion,” she replied, speaking in a
voice intended only for Mrs. Maitland and Lilian, the children hav-
ing set off down the drive to bid their playlellow another good-by.
“I sometimes wish,” she added, with a sigh, “that Cyril were not
quite so devout.” ‘ _
“ Dear child, that is a bad wish,” rebuked Mrs. Maitland.
“He will be upset for at least a day,” continued Marion, ab-
stractedly, “and will see none of us. He is still so sensitive; the
least reference to my poor brother invariably has this effect. I was
the last transgressor," continued Marion, with a sorrowful smile.
“ It was at Ohillon. When we were in that dreadful crypt by Bon-
nivnrd’s pillar, somebody began to quote Byron’s ‘ Prisoner ’—
some tiresome tourist. I could not help it, Lilian, but the thought
of being shut up all those years; the thought that Henry, who read
those very lines so unthinkingly on that fatal day, as you told me,
was actually suﬂering—. Oh, dear] " added Marion, checking a
sub. “ I turned and asked Cyril to take me away from that dread-
ful place. Heaven knows what I said. Something about my un-
fortunate brother, I suppose. Well, Cyril fainted. He told me
then that I must never speak of him.”
“He will grow less sensitive as his health improves and his hap-
piness becomes more habitual,” Mrs. Maitland said, trying to soothe
the agitated girl.
“It would be more manly in Cyril, and far better for him, if he
would but accept the fact, and make up his mind to meet it brave-
ly,” said Lilian. “He can not go on in this way; his long illness
has spoiled him. I must speak to him-”
“ O Lilian] ” interposed Marion, “pray don’t speak to him!
He can’t bear it, indeed. You will only make matters far worse,
indeed—indeedl You think you understand Cyril, but you are
mistaken. You are not his wife. I have been his wife only two
months, but I know more about him than I ever knew of any hu-
man being before.”
And the knowledge had taken the careless gayety from Marion’s
manner, and the youthful ring from her laughter. vlt was not with-

206 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN JIAITLAND.
out reason that she vaunted her fresh matronly dignity, and said,
with half-sad playfulness, “I am older than you now, Lilian—years,
years older.”
“ We must bear with dear Cyril,” said Mr. Maitland, who had
joined them. “Suffering of unusual severity has been laid upon
him, his whole life has received a shock, and we must remember
that We saved his reason only as by a miracle. Even now his mind
is not ﬁrmly balanced. Marion must heal that mind as only she
can. But Cyril will bear the scars of this furnace all his life, poor
lad. We must not marvel that he is changed.”
Every one recognized the ﬁerceness of the furnace through
which Cyril had passed, leaving his youth behind, and yet it never
struck people that the blow was naturally more severe to Lilian.
Even Mr. Maitland. with the memory of Lilian’s passionate outburst-
when she conﬁded the story of Everard’s love to him, did not re-
ﬂeet that it makes a greater shipwreck of life to lose a lover than a
friend. The tragedy of Cyril’s youth threw an additional glamour
over him for the remainder of his life ; his deep friendship, and the
sensitiveness which made him grieve to the point of losing his
reason and almost his life over a brother’s shame, invested him
with a romantic interest which never faded. It was whispered
about in after years, with various modiﬁcations and additions, but
always to Cyril’s credit, long after the trial and the catastrophe to
the Everards was forgotten.
The illness with which Cyril had been stricken on hearing Ever-
_ ard’s terrible doom, left its marks on him for life. No one could
say how he was changed, but it was certain that he was never the
same man again. During the slow process of recovery, he was for
months like a child in intellect, living only for triﬁes, laughing at a
more nothing, speaking only as a child speaks, reading nothing but
the lightest literature, and preferring that specially consecrated to
boys‘ amusement, and, above all, strictly forbidden to approach any
painful topic in thought or speech.
The day that saw him out of danger saw Lilian on a bed of sick-
ness, from which she arose almost as weak as Cyril. The twins
made their convalescence together, Lilian outstripping her brother
in their progress toward health, and their physical weakness-espe-
cially Cyril’s, which was excessive—made it easy for them to avoid
mental exertion. They were told to lead an animal life, and they
became boy and girl at holiday once more.


## p. 207 (#213) ############################################

THE SILENCE 0F- DEAN MAITLAND. 207
For months neither of them breathed Henry’s name, or alluded
to the events which had ended so tragically for him. Gradually
Cyril’s reason, the delicate chords of which had been so cruelly
strained, resumed its natural tone, and Lilian, who watched him
like a mother, supplied his intellect from day to day with stronger
food. First she had occupied his vacant moments with manual em-
ployments—wood-carving, painting, and even needlework, which
he executed in the early days, while she read to him. Then she
advanced him to gardening and the tending of pet animals, and
singing with her; thence to an interest in public affairs. As he
progressed, and began to talk calmly and seriously, she extended
his reading, took him back to old favorite classic authors, and got
him to translate these and modern poets into English verse, for
which he had a graceful knack; and one day, when he brought her
a fresh copy of original verses, she felt that her patient was healed,
and determined to send him away from her.
“You have saved his intellect,” his physician said, when she
showed him the verses, “ and I must confess that I had very little
hope of such a consummation. No one with a less intimate knowl-
edge of your brother’s character could have done what you have
done. You have in so doing saved aremarkably ﬁne, if delicate,
mental organization.”
Then Oyril traveled for some months in Greece, Egypt, and
Syria—countries particularly interesting to one of his temperament
and education. He reveled in the poetic and historic associations
of the ancient homes of letters and arts, and poured out his soul in
devotional ecstasy on the hallowed soil of Jerusalem and Nazareth.
He also wrote a poem, called “ The Knight of Expiation," in blank
verse.
The “knight,” it appeared, was visited by one of those unlucky
excesses of virtue which the vulgar call crimes, and for which pub-
lic opinion usually exacts the reparation of hanging in these prosaic
days. The nature of this virtuous excess was discreetly left to the
reader’s imagination, d la Byron, and was thus as horrible as the
most fastidious taste could desire. (Lennie inclined to the opinion
that the knight had boiled his grandmother, and played dice with
her bones, besides practicing the black art) '
The furies of conscience having seized upon this unlucky victim
of social prejudices, as M. Hugo et Oie call criminals, he put on a
hair shirt, and went to the Holy Land to do penance at its shrines,

and returned to his native shores to be canonized. This plot aﬁord-
ed ﬁne scope for Cyril’s descriptive and topographical powers, and
' admitted of a beautiful account of the knight’s feelings on ﬁrst see-
ing Jerusalem, which would have been more generally admired if it
had not reminded people so strongly of a similar passage in Tasso.
The character of the knight had unfortunately been anticipated by
Byron in Childe Harold. Nevertheless, the pretty volume, called
“The Knight’s Expiation, and other Poems,” was greatly admired,
if not purchased.
Marion had seen Cyril frequently during his convalescence,_ and
had only parted with him at the beginning of his tour; and, in the
second June after his illness, her father took her to Paris, where
Cyril met her, and was quietly married to her. The young couple
passed a brief paradise in Switzerland, and then went home to Mal-
bourne, whence, after a few days’ sojourn, they were to go to Cy-
ril's fresh curacy in the west of London. The twins had, however,
been parted since the time when Lilian ﬁnished her pious task of
rescuing her brother’s intellect from the shipwreck which threat-
ened it.
They had met again but four and twenty hours since, yet Lilian
knew their old close relationship was at an end for evér. An in-
surmountable barrier had risen up between them. This, she told
herself, was but in the natural course of things; the peculiar bond
of twinship, strengthened as it had accidentally been by the circumL
stances of Cyril’s terrible illness, could not be expected to outlive
early youth. Her brother had now found other ties; he was tasting .
the fullness of life. The old childish associations must fade in the
full stress of manhood, and they must now be only as brothers and
' sisters commonly are. It was only natural, and yet it grieved Lilian
with an unspeakable grief. In the sore trouble which had fallen on
her, she needed her brother’s close friendship as she never had done
before. . >
As Marion had predicted, they saw nothing more of Cyril that
night, but the next day he appeared among them with a cloudless
brow, and set them all laughing with his droll anecdotes and obser-
vations, the drollery of which was so greatly enhanced by his grave
face and almost pathetic voice. He never laughed, and only rarely
smiled, and, although his very smile was sad, it was as sweet as
only rare smiles are. One of those smiles was sufﬁcient to win a
friend for life, as he well knew. There had been a time when he

Was wont to laugh as happily and heartily as only young manhood
can.
There was a great croquet-tournament that afternoon at Mr. Mar-
vyn’s, and there the Maitlands, the younger Garretts and Swayne-
stones assembled, to measure their powers one against the other
with all the serious ardor which the pursuit of croquet in the
palmy days of its youth exacted.
Will no bard arise to pour forth lyric song in honor of that noble
but now extinct pastime? Can no historian be found to chronicle
the decline and fall of croquet? It descended, like other gifts of
Heaven, unexpectedly from some far celestial eminence and took
captive the hearts of the sons, and still more of the daughters, of
men, at one stroke. In those who were young at that golden pe-
riod, the peculiar sharp yet dull click of the balls still awakes a.
thrilling combination of delicious and romantic feelings, as it is
evoked by the hand of some careless child, who has rented out the
dusty mallets and balls from some _Iorgotten corner, and imagines
himself a new Columbus in consequence.
Mr. Marvyu, who, it will be remembered, was curate of Mal-
bourne and tutor to the young Maitlands in succession, had been
very severely bitten by the croquet mania. He had ruthlessly lev-
eled his wife’s ﬂower-beds to make a ﬁtting ground for the noble
pastime, and this he mowed and rolled and watered himself, and
upon this he permitted no unlicensed foot to stray.
When the players arrived, they found every hoop and stick ex-
actly placed, after careful and accurate measurement, on a lawn
newly shaven and tested by a spirit-level, and a host and hostess
too much burdened with the responsibility of reading the new club
rules to go through the conventional forms of welcome.
An interlude of tea was grudgingly acquiesced in; and Mr. Mar-
vyn, laying aside his own favorite mallet with a deep sigh, and care-
fully noting the position of each player in his pocket-book, followed
his guests to some tables in the shade of two ﬁne elms, and, taking
a. chair by Mrs. Cyril Maitland, began to scold her seriously for the
blunders she had made, and laughed at, which was worse, while
playing on his side. But there were some people, and among them
Ingram Swaynestone, who took his tea on the grass at Lilian’s feet,
who thought the tea interlude by no means the least agreeable part
of the tournament, and responded with little alacrity to Mr. Mar-
vyn’s summons to continue the combat.

Night fell all too soon upon the eager contest, and the light of
the mellow August moon was supplemented by that of two carriage-
lamps, which were carried from hoop to hoop, to the great distrac-
tion of nervous people; while the less ardent players, resigning their-
balls to others, joined the non-combatants in the drawing-room, and
yielded themselves to the frivolity of conversation and music.
“ Poets are made of precious queer stuff,” Ingram Swaynestone
observed to Lilian, as they stood on the lawn, waiting their turn to
play, and listened to a song which Miss Swaynestone was singing.
“Now, what could have put that notion into Cyril’s head? I’m
sure he never left oﬁ‘ loving anybody.”
The song which Cyril had written, and which had been daintin
set by an Austrian student he met in his travels, was as follows:
“ When I began to love you,
’Twas like the beginning of June,
Like the dewy birth of the morning
Or the swell of the ﬁrst lark’s tune.
“ All grew so bright, so gracious,
S0 full of mystery sweet,
Such a deep and dear enehantment
Had bound me, hands and feet.
“ But when I ﬁnished to love you,
’Twas like the closing of night, ‘
When November’s gleaming is sheeted
In rain-clouds falling light.
“Ah! when I ﬁnished to love you,
I ﬁnished with all things bright,
And I saw a dark grave yawning
To hide my heart in its night.”
Lilian knew that Cyril had written it at the time of his estrange-
ment from Marion, who was listening to it now with great enjoy-
ment, unconscious that she was the heroine of it; but she only said
that poets were supposed to feel all the emotions of which the
human breast is capable, and Ingram was about to make some re-
joinder, when the reiterated cry of “Blue to play! ” at last aroused
his attention, and he reluctantly obeyed the summons.
But when the game was at last ended, and they found themselves
going home in the moonlight across the few ﬁelds, and through the

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN JIAITLAND. 211
dewy lane which lay between the curate’s dwelling and the rector’s,
Ingram contriVed that Lilian should linger behind with him, so that
there was no chance of interruption. The words of Cyril’s song
echoed in his ears:
“Such a deep and dear enchantment
Had bound me, hands and feet."
“I can not break the spell, Lilian,” he said, “and I do not think
it well to try any more. My father sees it at last, and, though at
one time he wished me to look for rahk and fortune, he now thinks
I can not do better than follow my heart.”
"‘Dear Ingram,” replied Lilian, pausing at a gate, over which
they saw the village sleeping in the moonlight, “I would have
spared you this. I thought I had been explicit enough.”
“You were explicit enough; I quite understood that I was re-
fused. But, dearest Lilian, you can not imagine how earnestly and
truly I love you,” he continued, his face ﬂushing beneath its brown
with deep and serious feeling. “I know well how unworthy I am
of you. I have not been a good man; I was not like Cyril. I did
as others do. But, dearest Lilian, ever since the happy day, long
ago now, when I found that I loved you, ‘when I began to lOve \
you,’ as Cyril’s song says, it was indeed like the beginning of June
~everything was new. I woke up to loathe all those things in my
life that were unworthy of you; I set to work to sweep them all
away, and do better. I am not good for much even now, I know
well; but if there is any good in me at all, if I am not a mere un-
scrupulous man of pleasure, if I have any higher aspirations, if I try
to do my duty in my small way, it is all owing to you.”
“ N 0, Ingram,” returned Lilian, looking into the honest, manly
face, which was alight with unwonted fervor; “you are wrong, be-
lieve me. It is not due to me, but to your own good and true na-
ture, which only needed the touch of love—which you must give
one‘day, not to me, but to some better, more suitable woman—to
show you the real meaning of life. Believe me, Ingram, men are
not so dependent on women. Do not give in to the conventional
ﬁction of making your better self depend on anything so uncertain
as the will and liking of one weaker than yourself. The moral
nature of men is stronger than that of women. We all want some-
thing to lean upon. Do not make pillars of us. Do you think any
woman could love one she believed her inferior? "

z
“ I hope and trust so,” said Ingram, with a little smile. “With-
out that there would be little chance of happiness for me and many
another poor fellow. Dear Lilian, try to love me. How can I live
without you? ”
“I thought we were to be friends,” replied Lilian, with a sigh
and a regretful intonation of her beautiful voice.
It was like the most quuisite music to Ingram’s ear; it seemed
to take his soul captive and surround him with the purest delight.
Merely to hear her discoursing on every-day themes to others ﬁlled
him with a sense of delicious perfection which no cares could dis-
tract.
“ We must be something more than friends.” he said, “ when the
very sound of your voice stirs every ﬁber within me.”
“ We can never be more than friends; it is not in my power,”
she replied quickly and with agitation.
Ingram looked at her pale, pure face with a startled glance, and
saw that tears were fast gathering in her eyes. Was there some
hidden trouble in her serene and lovely life? He could not think
it. She had outlived the pain and annoyance of her old playmate’s
ruin; she had received her brother back from the very jaws of
death; all was fair and pleasant around her. Her step was light as
only that of health and young happiness can be; her laughter had
the most joyous ring of any he ever heard; she was always bright
and full of pleasant thoughts and airy suggestions. ' N o; it was not
possible that sorrow could have a home in her heart. He looked
silently and searchingly at the ﬁgure by his side.
She was of more ethereal mold than she had been in earlier
days; and her features, losing the soft, joyous curves of youth, had
- ﬁned into that perfect purity of outline which in her brother seemed
austerity, but in her suggested spirit-like sweetness. The twins’
faces had been cast in the very same mold, only the lips were
fuller and ﬁrmer in the sister, and she lacked the squareness visible
in her brother’s jaw. For the ﬁrst time, Ingram asked himself the
question people never asked when under the spell of Lilian’s glances
—-Had she beauty? And his answer was in the afﬁrmative.
“Dear Lilian,” he said, “it is in your power to try to love
me.” .
Lilian shook her head. “Do you remember the day of Ben
Lee's death? ” she asked. “ Henry Everard and I were in Temple
Copse at midday when Long‘s wagon was passing. It was then ”

Lilian faltered, and her lip trembled a little—“ that we became en-
gaget .”
Ingram was not wholly unprepared for this, and said so, gazing
quietly before him, without returning the gaze he knew she had
ﬁxed on him. "But that is long ago,” he added, “and you have
your life to live. Because you made one mistake, because one man
proved unworthy, will you spoil another’s happiness?”
“ Unworthyl ” cried Lilian, in a voice that startled him. “Henry
Everard was never unworthy; that is no word to apply to him. A
more spotless man never breathed.”
“Oh, Lilian,” returned Ingram, “you must indeed have loved
him if you believed him innocent after the evidence which con-
demned him.”
“I did indeed love him,” said Lilian, with quiet fervor.
He was silent for a time, half stunned by the calm force of
Lilian’s words; then at last he spoke.
" This old pain must be healed,” he said falteringly; “ the dead
past rnust bury its dead.”
“The past is alive and young,” replied Lilian.
“Dearest Lilian, this must not be,” said Ingram, with resolution.
“It is wrong and morbid to go on brooding over an old sorrow, and
refusing comfort. Innocent or not, he is dead to you; your love
can proﬁt him no more than if he were actually in the grave—”
“ You are mistaken,” interrupted Lilian; “ we correspond. Be-
sides, the imprisonment is not for life.”
“Lilian, this is too dreadful. A convicted felon with a twenty
years’ sentence! Supposing even the best, and he came out at the
end of ﬁfteen or sixteen years; you are six and twenty now; youth
would be gone—”
“But not love, Ingram. Do you know what love is? It is
stronger than time, stronger than prisons, stronger than sorrow,
stronger than shame; it is stronger, even, than death. Many waters
can not quench it, even waters of salt tears; and no ﬂoods of aﬂ'iie-
tion can drown it. Love is immortal, and knows nothing of age or
death.” .
Ingram gazed awe~stricken upon the inspired face, etherealized
by the dreamy moonlight and its own holy passion, and listened to
the beautiful voice as people listen to ﬁne strains of organ-music.
“Lilian,” he said at last, “this can not be. You must not throw
away your life like this. Time will soften these feelings.”

“Never,” she returned ﬁrmly. “Ingram, you must waste no
more time on me. You, are my very dear friend, and I have told
you the secret of my heart, and you see now how impossible any
such relations are to me. Let your past bury its dead, and ﬁx your
heart’s good affections elsewhere. Come, let us go.”
But he would not go on; he stopped, and, taking her hand, .
poured out a torrent of remonstrance and entreaty.
“Look, Ingram," she said at last, “look northward. If our
sight could reach so far, we should see a river, a dark river crowd-
ed with shipping, and beyond the river stands a black round mass
of buildings. ln that dark mass there is a. cell, in which, perhaps,
this very moon is shining now through the barred window. In
that cell is n. man, a gentleman, a man of unusual gifts and culture.
He is young, and everything has been taken from him—liberty, fort-
une, hope, ambition, honor, friends; but not love,” she added, her
features transﬁgured as she spoke; “love and innocence are still
his. Ingram, I am all that man has on this earth, and I love him.
Do you think any happiness life can oﬁ’er would make me desert
him i "
“He would never wish you to be bound to him, if he really
cared for you.”
“He does not wish it. But think of that solitary prisoner, and
remember he is the only man I ever loved or could love. That is
my last word."
They went. silently on their way with full hearts, Lilian’s tearful
glances always turned northward, and those of her companion bent
downward. , _
At that moment, within the gloomy building beyond the dark
and crowded river, a strongly built man, with a haggard face and
dark eyes full of intellect, was lying on a hard couch in his solitary
cell, on the bare white wall of which fell a square patch of bright
moonlight, crossed by the shadow of iron bars. He was glad that
the window looked southward, and turned to it even in his sleep.
But he was awake new, and thinking how the mellow glory
was falling on the Melbourne corn-ﬁelds and the beloved roof which
sheltered Lilian, and wondering if, perhaps, the same luster which
gilded his dim and dreary cell made a halo for the adored face.

CHAPTER III.
Sous few years since, the ﬁat went forth for the old familiar
walls and heavy gates of Portsmouth town to be leveled to the
ground, that the space which these now useless relics of the past
occupied might be covered with buildings connected with the de-
fenses and adapted to the requirements of the present. Down went -
many a ﬁne old elm beneath axe and rope, and bit by bit the ram-
parts disappeared, and the ditches were ﬁlled by the busy hands of
sunburnt men, armed with barrow, pick-axe, and spade.
One summer morning, while these works were in progress, the
sun shone brightly in the clear blue sky, and over the quiet sea and
still quieter harbor; on the troop-ships and mail- clad men-of-war, the
busy steamers and countless boats of every description, which ﬁlled
these peaceful waters; on the gay garrison town, and on the beach,
crowded with bathers. Now and again a bugle rang out, a gun was
ﬁred, snatches of military music were heard; on the breezy com-
mon the strong horses and heavy guns of mounted artillery were
careering through thick dust-clouds, whence the sparkle of arms
and accouterments gleam ed more eifeetively in the brilliant sunlight.
Portsmouth streets were full of life, and the melodious chimes of
the parish church ﬂoated sweetly over street, harbor, and bastion
at every quarter.
Not very far from the Queen’s Bastion a party of men were at
work upon the partly leveled fortiﬁcations. They toiled on in the
hot sunshine in a listless, unwilling manner, each man apparently
trying to accomplish as little as possible. They were an ugly set,
for the most part, with low brows, heavy jaws, and brutal looks,
and their close-cropped hair, small black oilskin caps, dingy yellow
clothes, and clumsy boots by no means softened their repulsive ap-
pearance. Many of them looked at the gay carriages and brightly
clad women and children passing and repassing, while some bent
their scowling brows stolidly over their spades. But the gazers did
not look up with a direct glance; they looked out of the corners
of their eyes, round their noses, with all kinds of crooked and tort-
uous glances, like the traitors Dante saw in his “ Inferno.” Few of
these men could give a level glance or a candid answer; still fewer
could think a clear and honest thought. '
At intervals, watching them, and occasionally giving a sharp,

stern order, stood armed men, stalwart and blue-clad, with faces
like rocks. Their guns were loaded with ball, and their side-arms,
gleaming in the sun, looked terribly practical. As the convicts
pursued their forced, unwelcome toil, with the sweat beading their
weather-stained brows, a slow, melancholy, long-drawn music peeled
from the distance, and grew more and more distinct, while the
passengers thickened, and a slowly moving mass of scarlet, inter-
spersed with ﬂashes of steel and gold, came into sight. The wail of
the trumpets rose into notes of shriller anguish, while the heavy
roll of the muﬁled drums beneath was like the despairing voice of
some irrevocable doom, and smote heavily upon the heart of one of
the convicts, who recognized in the wailing music, the reversed
arms, and slow rhythm of the soldier’s even march, the solemn pa-
geant of a military funeral. '
As the procession drew nearer, the road became more choked
with passengers and gazers, and people climbed on the unfenced
works, some to see the pageant better, others to be out of the way
till the crowd was past. They gradually pressed closer and closer
on the convicts, whose dangerous proximity they did not heed,
until the warders, ﬁnding it impossible to keep them away, formed
the convicts in line as far away as possible, and bid them stand at
attention while the funeral glided by in its slow majesty.
The convict in whose breast the sorrowful music had found
such a responsive echo was on the outside of the two-deep line
nearest the road, and was within a few paces of two ladies who had
drawn aside to avoid the crowd. At ﬁrst sight there was nothing
to distinguish No. 62 from his repulsive comrades, but a. closer gaze
revealed an intellectual face, gaunt and lined with suﬂ'ering; dark
hazel eyes, with a straight, thoughtful glance; and a genial mouth,
Which had lost its old habit of smiling. He was of slighter build
than most of the convicts, but strong and well-set. His name,
which he had not heard for a weary time, and which his nearest
and dearest friends had long ceased to pronounce, was Henry Ever-
ard. ‘
Many an old memory stirred within him, as he heard the muﬂied
roll of the drums and looked upon the scarlet mass of silent men
moving by; for many of the soldiers wore the number of his
brother’s regiment on their uniforms, and he thought of the sunny-
hearted Leslie, whom he had so admired and loved, and with
whom, when quite a lad, he had spent so many pleasant holidays,

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 217
all tuned to the bright music of trumpet and drum, and the quick
rattle of arms and rhythmic tread of armed men.
He remembered his pride the ﬁrst time he Was admitted as a
grown man to the mess-table, and his brother’s gallant presence
and light-hearted merriment, and the respect paid him by the raw
lads who had just joined. Of all his brothers, Leslie was nearest
him in age, though some years his senior, and dearest to him in
ati‘ection; but now—where was he? Lost to him with all that the
great storm of his life had carried away—lost, but not forgotten.
His eye sought him among the ofﬁcers, one or two of whom he
recognized, but Leslie was not there. He might have exchanged;
he was probably promoted. Who knew what might have happened
in those years?
“Yes,” one of the ladies said, “my husband knew him well.
They were stationed at Malta together. As you see, our regiment
is following as well as his own. A popular oﬁicer, as nice men
generally are.”
Everard had observed the second regiment, and at the same
moment it had struck him that, although the charger walking with
_ empty saddle behind the gun-carriage showed the rank of the de-
ceased ofﬁcer to be at least that of major, it was not impossible
that his brother might be lying beneath the Union Jack. Then he
caught sight of the occupants of the mourning-coaches. In one he
saw the gray head of his father, and his heart misgave him. But
he reﬂected that he was Admiral of the Port. Might be be there
in his ofﬁcial capacity? But George was there also, and his heart
,died within him.
“His coming home was so sad,” continued one of the ladies.
“If he could but have lived till he reached land! But he died just
as they were disembarking. His wound was not so very serious:
he got fever upon it.”
“ And his friends were just too late to see him alive,” added the
other lady. “Only one child, I think? And the poor wife was
here to receive him.” '
This, though in low tones such as ladies naturally use in a crowd,
the convict’s eager, strained ears caught, till at last he could bear it
no longer; and, forgetful of the strict prison discipline, he lifted
his cap, and, stepping quickly forward, addressed the lady nearest
him.
“Pardon me, madam, the ofﬁcer’s name? ” he asked.

218 THE SILE.\‘CE OF DEAN JIAITLAND. ‘
“ Major Everard," replied the lady, startled into a quick response,
and drawing back with some alarm.
No. 62 had neither eyes nor ears for the warder’s stern admoni-
tion. He drew back into line, while the heart-shaking roll of the
drums and the wail of the trumpets grew fainter and fainter, and
the crowd moved away. Then he resumed his barrow at the word
of command, and wheeled it along the plank under the hot sun;
but heavy tears fell upon the dry rubbish of the old fortiﬁcations,
and ever and anon he lifted his toil-stained hand to dash away the
quick-falling drops, while his comrades’ rude jeers and foul pleasant-
ries, stealthin muttered as they were, reached his ears unheeded.
“Emily,” said the lady who had replied to the convict’s ques-
tion, as they resumed their road when the crowd melted, " that man
was a gentleman. Did you notice his voice and the way in which
he lifted his cap? ”
“Poor fellowl ” returned the other. “ Why was he so curious?
He will be punished for speaking, you know. Perhaps he had friends
in the regiment.”
“Perhaps. By the way, I wonder how soon one ought to call
on Mrs. Everard? She really never joined the regiment, you see;
but our husbands were intimate friends.”
Leslie dead! the gay and gallant Leslie, the joyous, light-hearted
companion of his boyhood, his father’s favorite sonl Like the slow
strokes of a knell which heat into the agonized brain of a mourner,
these mournful words—Leslie dead—kept dinning into Everard’s
cars all that long day. He heard them in every stroke of pick and
hammer, while he toiled on with his barrow; in the boom of guns
at sea; in the measured tread of the convicts as they marched back
to dinner; in the few brief orders given by the warders, as the con-
victs stood with arms uplifted, while a rapid, skilled hand was passed
' over every inch of their bodies in search of anything that might have
been received and secreted from the outer world; in the clang of the
prison bell, which told that the hour of respite was past, and time
come to march out to work again.
“ And he will never know that I was innocent,” thought Everard,
as he ate his solitary meal in his cell, “Sein Brod mit Thrﬁnen 'ass.”
Next to the discovery of Cyril’s treachery, he had been most
out to the heart by receiving no message or communication from
Leslie after his conviction. The admiral’s stern though kindly na-
ture he knew, and he was not surprised that, after the long array of

THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND. 219
damning evidence against him, the plain, upright sailor should treat
him as one dead; nor was he surprised, though deeply pained, that
Keppel should do likewise.
His sisters and their husbands he knew too well to think they
would ever trouble themselves about a disgraced kinsman; but
Leslie, the generous, warm-hearted Leslie, whom he so loved and
admired, and Marion, the darling of his childhood and youth—that
they should think him guilty, that cut into the very core of his
heart. And now Leslie—unless, indeed, the dead see the things of
life with clearer vision than they who are still mingled in its tur-
moil—could never know that he was innocent. And he had taken
a wife—left forlorn now, poor soull—and there was an orphan
child of his own blood. And so the great stream of life rolled on
past the desolate rock-to which he was left chained, deaf to the
thunder of the on-rushiug waves, clean forgotten, like a dead man
out of mind. .
Like those sufferers whom Dante met in hell, and who thought
no more of their agonies in the bitter tidings he brought them of
their beloved on earth, No. 62 cared little for the punishment and
loss of good marks which his breach of discipline cost him. It was
many days before he was again employed on the fortiﬁcations, for
that work was eagerly coveted and only given to the best-behaved
men, both because it aﬁ'orded the unfortunate captives a welcome
glimpse of the outside world, and also because it offered greater fa-
cilities of escape than any other work, greater even than those
which the dock-yard laborers enjoyed.
Everard’s next week, therefore, was spent within the dreary
conﬁnes of the prison, partly at accounts and partly at hospital
duty, in which he was much more useful than other men on account
of his previous training, but duties which he particularly abhorred
for many reasons; among others, on account of the conﬁnement
and the leisure they gave the mind for brooding.
It is difﬁcult to realize the agony of despair which devoured
Ererard’s heart and confused his intellect in the ﬁrst months of his
imprisonment. The horror of Cyril‘s treachery and evil-doing, and
the shame of seeing all human virtue and honor in the dust. blunted
his perceptions of minor evils at ﬁrst, and the black despair of feel-
ing that there was no God, or only some cruel deity who laughed
at the misery of innocent men and promoted ovil-doers, made him
like a stone.

The thought that his life’s purpose was wrecked; that he could
now never pursue these grand scientiﬁc theories which‘ he was so
near bringing to perfection ; that the productions of centuries of hu-
man intellect were closed to him for ever; that the mental powers
he so delighted in exercising must rust, and perhaps be crushed be-
neath a daily load of brute-like drudgery and degrading hardship;
that his ﬁner susceptibilities would be blunted or eﬂ‘aced by the
daily contact with all that was coarsest and foul'est in human na-
ture; that he would be utterly cut 0!! from all that was calculated
to nourish and refresh the higher nature, did not come to him till
much later.
Like some captured wild beast, he submitted with dogged un-
willingness to the restraints of superior force; he did his prison
tasks with the mute protest of the blinded Sampson among his tor-
mentors, not caring whether he pulled down the pillars of his
prison-house or not in his savage strength. It was a relief to him
to exhaust himself in hard bodily toil, and he performed feats of
strength in his passion which surprised men born and trained to
physical labor.
The chaplain was a man for whom the human soul had no secret
sanctuary in which angels, much less foolish and sinful men, might
ﬁber to tread, and for whom the highest mysteries of the divine nu.-
ture were but scraps of glib commonplace; a man who expected
men steeped in years of vice and foulness to be converted at once
by the rude and sudden enunciation of his well-worn formula; a
sincere and well-meaning man withal, who looked upon earth as an
antechamber to an unspeakable hell, from which a very small and
numbered few might occasionally be snatched by a sort of chance-
medley jugglery, of which he and half a dozen more alone knew the
catch-word, or enchanted pass-word; the chaplain pronounced him
an utter reprobate.
“ But have you no care for your poor soul? ” he asked one day,
after wearisome exhortations and endless questioning, to which the
prisoner had given no reply. “ None whatever,” he replied at last.
He was no favorite with the warders, whom he despised in his
unjust resentment of their authority, or with his fellow-prisoners,
who hated him, ﬁrstly, because he was a gentleman; and, second-
ly, because all his looks and words su'ently rebuked the viciousness
of their own. Excessive labor and hopeless brooding brought him
to the hospital at last.

The prison doctor knew his history. and felt for him as for a
brother in trouble, and, accustomed as he was to suspect and dis-
cover malingering, saw at once that N 0. 62’s strange malady was no
feigned one, but arose from the mind rather than the body. One
day, after many rough but kindly efforts to reuse him, he said at
last:
“ If you go on like this, you will lose your reason before long."
“Reason 1 ” retorted the patient with bitter scorn. “And what
use is reason to me ? ”
“ It is of little use to you, perhaps,” rejoined the ofﬁcer, moving
away, “but the loss of it will make you a dangerous nuisance to
others."
This drastic observation had a wholesome eﬁect upon the pris-
oner’s stricken mind. The notion of sinking into' a dangerous
nuisance stung him into a sense of the unmanliness of giving him-
self up to his miseries; it awoke in him the bracing thought that
some faint remnants of duty remained even to one so out off from
his kind as himself.
He thought that he probably would become insane, hisgnedical
knowledge told him how much he had to fear on that score from
his terrible life; but he was resolved that at least he would do his
best to preserve his wits. He therefore took counsel with the
surgeon, and during his hospital leisure formed a scheme of intel-
lectual and moral discipline. He forced himself to an interest in
the repulsive human creatures and the dreary occupations of the
prison. He made a mental time-table, in which certain days or
hours were to be given to the recollection of particular ﬁelds of
knowledge, certain days to the mental speaking of Latin, Greek,
etc. Such poetry as he knew by heart he arranged for periodic
mental repetition. He did the same with the plots of (Eschylus
and others which he loved, and could not obtain from the prison
library. He told himself the story of Troy and the wanderings of
Ulysses on many a lonely night. He traced the minutest recesses
of his fellovv-prisoners’ anatomy beneath their outward semblance,
mentally depriving them of ﬂesh, muscle, and sinew, as easily as
Carlyle’s imagination dispossessed his fellows of their garments, and
lost no opportunity of observing whatever crossed his limited ﬁeld
of'vision. .
It was weary work. but it saved him. He fed his starving heart
with memories of hours passed with Lilian and others dear to

him—memories as full of pain as pleasure, particularly those which
recalled the few last vivid days at Melbourne before his arrest. Yet
his heart was still bitter with black despair.
Chapel-going was a dreary thing, and little calculated to edify
one less full of despairing doubt than Everard. It was diﬂicult to
preserve a devotional spirit amid that crowd of foul-mouthed male-
factors, who mingled ribaldry and blasphemy with the responses
they uttered and the hymns they sang for the sake of using theirv
voices.
One day Everard was aroused from a mental review of, the
symptoms in a complicated and interesting case he once conquered,
during the sleepy drone of the Litany, by a rush through the air
near him, followed by a crash. He looked up in time to see the
bent head of the governor struck by the shoe of the prisoner next
him, and the governor himself looked up in time to receive the sec-
ond shoe full in his face. This incident, typical of many similar
ones, seriously interfered with the morning’s devotion.
One drowsy, warm autumn morning, about six months after his
conviction, Everard was more than usually depressed, and had taken
refuge in sorrowful dreams of happier days. The prisoners were
quieter than usual, some dozing, some refreshed by the Te Deum
they had been loudly singing, some really touched by the awful pa-
thos of the gospel which was being read, when suddenly a phrase
seemed to detach itself from the rest of the narrative, and, as it
uttered by a trumpet voice, to trace itself deeply upon Everard’s
mind, waking him from his melancholy dream, and startling him
into a newer life. The phrase consisted of those heart-shaking
words, “ My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? ”
Every detail of the agony and cruciﬁxion ﬂashed clear upon his
mind, strangely mingled with the feeling of calm strength with
which the picture of Gethsemane in the study at Melbourne had
inspired him in the hour of his extremity. Tears rushed to his
eyes, and he trembled. All those weary months his heart had been
echoing that m0st bitter cry, without remembering that Christ had
been forced to utter it in the hour in which He accomplished man’s
redemption.
The darkness which had come upon him in the prisoner’s dock
at the discovery of his friend’s baseness rolled away, and he recog-
nized his own wrong-doing. What was Cyril, after all, that his faith
in divine and human goodness should depend on him? Had he'not

idolized the poor, weak, erring lad, whom his strength should rather
have pitied? And what was he that he should escape that darkness
which brooded over the very cross? How many men down the long
roll of the ages had suffered bonds and treachery, being innocent?
Cyril's cynical “ She is not the ﬁrst,” ﬂashed upon him, and he won-
dered that he should have cried out. so loud when he found himself
enrolled in the vast army of the world’s sufferers. What claim had
be for exemption from earth’s anguish?
“There is a God, and there is good, and the bitterest lot has
comfort,” he-said within himself, reversing his despairing utterance
in the dock when the'conviction of Cyril’s treachery ﬂashed upon
him, as he marched with his fellow-suﬁ'erers into the yard, where
an hour of sunlight and freedom within four walls was permitted
them on Sundays.
The midday sky was transparently blue and suffused with light,
so that it was ajoy to look upon; the sunny autumn air was sweet
to breathe; and the sheets of sunshine fell pleasantly upon him, in
spite of the garb of shame and bondage they lighted, and the prison
walls whose shadows limited them, and for the ﬁrst moment since
his imprisonment Everard felt that enjoyment was possible, even to
one so stricken as himself, since Heaven smiled still upon him, cap-
tive though he was.
Just then an oblong packet was put in his hand. He looked at
it with mute amazement for a moment, for he had forgotten how it
feels to receive a letter; and then he uttered a faint cry, for the
handwriting was Lilian’s. His ﬁrst instinct was to conceal it from
the vulgar crew around him, and he scarcely noticed that the sacred
cover, closed by the beloved hand, had been violated by some stran-
ger’s touoh, according to the stern prison rule.
He walked up and down the yard as one whose steps are on air.
his eyes full of soft ﬁre, happy merely to hold the treasure in his
hand. He did not open it till he was alone in his cell, that nar-
row witness of so much agony, which now became a palace of de-
light.
It was a letter such as only the tenderness of a good and loving
woman for one in deep aﬁiiction could inspire. It had touched
even’the oﬁicial reader, accustomed to moving letters full of ill-
spelled pathos from broken-hearted and often injured women to the
villains they loved, and it went into the very marrow of Everard’s
being, and steeped him in an atmosphere of pure thought and high-

sonled feeling, to which he had long been a stranger, and which
refreshed his parched spirit like waters in a desert of burning
sand.
Lilian brieﬂy mentioned Cyril’s terrible illness and her own, and
described his state, which was still one of doubtful sanity, requiring
the most watchful care; there were few tidings besides. Then she
spoke of Henry’s aﬁiiction, and bid him keep up his heart, and pray
constantly, as she did, that his innocence might be made clear. That
the truth must come out sooner or later, she was convinced, refer-
ring him to the great promises made to the just men in the Script-
ures. In the mean time, who could tell but that some wise and
heneﬁcent end was to be fulﬁlled by his sojourn in prison. The
purposes of the Almighty were deep and nnsearchable, far hidden
from the thoughts of men ; but whatever treachery and wickedness
had brought Everard to that pass of shame and misery, she bid
him remember that without the divine permission he could not be
there. ~ ’ i
What if some nobler and higher use than he could ever have
wrought outside in the free world were to be his in that dreary
place? Who could say what the inﬂuence of one solitary man of
stainless life might be in that crowd of degraded yet still human
creatures, or what sorrow might be there to comfort? Let him
only remember that the Almighty had placed him in that dreary
dungeon as surely as He had placed the sovereign on the throne,
the priest at the altar, and the bright blossom in the sunshine, and
take comfort.
These opportune words soothed and strengthened Everard‘s soul,
the more so as Lilian did not underrate the magnitude of the sacri-
ﬁce he had been called upon to make, but spoke feelineg of the
cruel denials and degradations of his‘lot, and of the frustration of
their common hopes, and of the separation, which she trusted might
soon be at an end.
She bid him remember also that, as a true lover, he must keep
up his courage for her sake, and hope in the future, which they
might still enjoy together. Nor was this noble letter wanting in
those assurances of love which are so cordial to parted lovers. Its
effect upon the lonely prisoner is difﬁcult to imagine, much less
describe.
But it was greatly due to the hope and faith which it inspired,
that from that day the prison became to Everard no longer a place

of darkness and despair, but a part of God’s own world, over which
divine wisdom and mercy still smiled, and in which a man’s soul
might still ﬁnd its necessary celestial food.
CHAPTER IV.
EVEBABD' found, to his unspeakable consolation, that he might
answer Lilian’s letter, though his answer would have to pass before
the cold eyes of the oﬂicials; and, further, that once in every few
months Lilian intended to write to him.
Thus from time to time his soul was braced and refreshed by the
dear delight of communicating with the being he loved most in the
world. How he counted the weeks and days till the day of days
arrived; how he treasured phrases and senteuces of those precious
letters (which he was, of course, not allowed to preserve) in his
memory; and how much thought he gave beforehand to the com-
position of repliesl
Many dark and terrible hours of bitter inward wrestling he still
had after that blessed autumn Sunday, but the general tenor of his
inward life was brave and hopeful. He found much to interest him
in his fellow-prisoners, and here and there ﬂowers of tenderness
and charity sprung up along the barren prison path, and he even
formed friendships—yes, warm and lasting friendships—with some
of the felons among whom his lot was cast, and enjoyed the pure
happiness of knowing that he had, as Lilian predicted, rescued more
than one fallen creature from despair, and set his face heaven~
ward. '
Among his ﬁrst friends was a young fellow whose character re-
minded him strongly of Cyril‘s, lovable, pious, well-disposed, re-
ﬁned, but weak and selﬁsh. He was of gentle birth, and had held
a position of trust under a large banking ﬁrm. He married young
on a small income; marriage brought cares, and did not diminish
the love of pleasure. He got into debt, gambled to extricate him-
self, and, of course, plunged further in. Ruin stared him in the face,
and he embezzled the sums trusted him, meaning, as such criminals
usually do, to pay all back in time. He left a young, wife and child
destitute in the hard world while undergoing his seven years im-

prisonment. He was heart-broken, and Everard saw him glide
swiftly into the clutches of consumption and fade before him.
Many a stroke of work he did for the poor weakling, and many
a thought of hope and manly cheerfulness he gave him. And by
the darkness in the prison the day the poor fellow was taken to the
inﬁrmary—never more, as Everard well knew, to come out again—
he knew how much brightness his friendship had made in that
dreary spot. Everard, as a special grace, besought them to give
him hospital duty, that he might himself tend his dying friend, and
thus he was able to soothe his latest moments; receive his piteous
message for his wife, whom Everard had little hope of ever meet-
ing; and close his eyes when he had no more need of the sun.
As the outer world so was the narrow prison sphere, Everard
found after awhile: men trusted and betrayed, loved and hated,
schemed and envied, derided misfortune or helped it, as in the
world, only there was a larger percentage of rascals inside the prison
than outside. His friends were chieﬂy gentlemen, though he sought
the friendship of the lowest; 9. man had but to be miserable to
found a claim upon his heart.
But never till he dwelt on equal terms with the scum of all
classes did he discover how hard and inﬂexible are the iron bars
which divide class from class. The gentlemen, from the fraudulent
director and forging ex-Guardsman, down to the smallest clerk or
shopman who could handle a pen, hailed him as a brother, while
those who belonged to what one may call the washing classes were
as his twin brothers; but the hand-laborers, the non-readers and
non-washers, and the criminal class proper, looked upon him as
their natural enemy, and, beyond mere brutal elementary necessi-
ties, discovered little on which they could exchange sympathy and
build friendship.
Everard sometimes longed for half a dozen villainous noblemen,
a misdoing minister or two, and one or two iniquitous emperors to
make the social world complete. In that case, in spite of the prison
equality, there would be no fear, be well knew, that the little
society would resolve itself into a republic; the rascal emperor
would have his rascal court, and the minor rascals would fall natu-
rally into their places.
In the process of the long years a sort of sleep had settled upon
Everard’s nature. He grew so inured to the prison routine, with its
numbing drudgery, that he had ceased to think of freedom or feel

active pain in his never-ceasing torment. But Leslie’s funeral was
like the stab of a sharp knife in a numbed limb; it woke him to full
consciousness of his misery and degradation. He had been at
Portsmouth only for some six months, having been suddenly trans-
ported thither, he knew not why, and he had but recently discov-
ered that his father was port-admiral.
Daily, as he worked on the dock-yard extension, he had passed
the admiral’s great house, with the green in front, and the sema-
phore, waving long arms to all the subject ships in harbor, upon its
roof, and had looked at it with a listless, incurious eye, little dream-
ing who was the chief ﬁgure in the court which gathers round the
port-admiral as a tiny social king, till one sunny noon, when going
home to dinner with his gang, he saw the admiral descending the
steps to welcome some guests, and felt the sting of his humiliation
as he had never done before, not even when one day, in the midst
of his muddy work at the extension, he had seen Keppel in full
uniform rowed ashore from his ship with all the pomp and circnm~
stance of a naval captain on blue waters. Some weeks before the
funeral, when he was going on to the dock-yard works at early
morning, the port-admiral‘s house was still lighted up, its windows
shone sickly in the gray daylight, a few carriages were still drawn
up in a lessening line before the principal door, and the last strains
. of a military band were dying away.
The admiral, assisted by his daughter-in-law, the Hon. Mrs.
Keppel Everard, had given a great ball that night, and in one of the
carriages, into which the admiral was leaning, talking, No. 62 saw
a black-coated man, whose features, dim in the shadow, suggested ‘
Cyril’s, and by his side, pale from the long night’s waking, and
talking to the old man, was surely, surely, his own sister Marion.
Did they know he was there? or had Lilian purposely withheld
the information to spare them paini He could not tell. But these
circumstances, together with the funeral, conspired to make his life
intolerable, and, when once more he found himself laboring on the
old fortiﬁcations, he stepped along in the gang with a subdued leap
in his gait, like a caged beast.
Long since he had renounced the hope of being freed by Cyril’s
conscience. He had never made any attempt to fasten the guilt on
the real criminal; he shrank from the complex misery it would
bring upon all dear to him; and, moreover, his evidence, though
absolutely convincing to himself, was purely conjecture].v He could

bring not one proof, no single witness, save the dumb cat, and that
evidence, be well knew, would suﬂice only to convince the one
person he most wished to be ignorant of the truth, Lilian herself.
The day on which he returned to the fortiﬁcations was hot and
ﬁercely bright. The town was full of life. Gay carriages were
bearing ladies in light summer bravery to garden-parties, afternoon
dances on board ships, and other revels; bands were playing on
piers; vessels of every kind, some gay with ﬂags, dotted the Solent
and the calm blue harbor; colors had been trooped on the common,
troops had marched past the convicts; the sweet chimes of St.
Thomas‘s had rung a wedding peal ; the great guns had thundered
out royal salutes to the royal yacht as she bore the sovereign over
to the green Wight; there was such a rush and stir of life as quite
bewildered Everard, and made the sharpest contrast to his gray and
dreary prison life. To see these freest of free creatures, the street
boys, sauntering or springing at will along the hot streets, or, cast-
ing off their dirty rags, ﬂinging themselves into the fresh salt sea,
and reveling there like young Tritons, or balanced on rails, criti-
cising the passing troops, was maddening. _
The day grew hotter, but pick and barrow had to be plied with-
out respite, though the sweat poured from hot brows, and one man
dropped. Everard saw that it was sunstroke, and not malingering,
as the warder was inclined to think, and by his earnest representa- .
tions got the poor creature proper treatment. The brassy sky grew
lurid purple, and heavy growls of thunder came rumbling from the
- distance; some large drops of rain fell scantily: and then suddenly
the sky opened from horizon to horizon and let down a sheet of
vivid ﬂame. Darkness followed, and a roar, as of all the artillery
at Portsmouth ﬁring and all its magazines exploding at once.
“Now or never,” thought Everard, and, dropping his barrow
at the end of his plank, he leapt straight ahead down into a waste
patch, over which he sprang to the road. He ran for life and liberty
with a speed he did not know himself capable of, straight on, blindly
aiming at the shore, tearing off his cap and jacket and ﬂinging them
widely in different directions, as he went through thedark curtain
of straight, rushing rain.
The warders, bewildered by the awful roar of the thunder,
blinded by the ﬁerce, quick dazzle of the lightning and the blackness
of the all-concealing rain, did not at ﬁrst miss him. It was only
when he leapt the palisade bounding the road, and showed through

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 229
the rain-curtain a bare-headed, fugitive ﬁgure, that the grim guard-
ian caught sight of him. Had he possessed the nerve to walk quietly
out through the gate, he might have got off unobserved under cover
of the storm.
Quick as thought, the warder, on seeing him, lifted his piece to
his shoulder and ﬁred. He was a good marksman, and his face
lighted up with satisfaction as he hit his ﬂying quarry, in spite of
the bad light and confusing storm.
Everard felt a sharp, hot sting in the thigh, but ran on, his course
marked with blood, which the friendly storm quickly washed away.
The darkness became intenser, the lightning more blinding, the
downrush of rain heavier, and the crashing of the thunder more
deafening. Nevertheless, the alarm was given, and the pnrsuers
were soon in full chase.
Down the now deserted high-road dashed the fugitive, every
faculty he possessed concentrated on ﬂight. With the blind instinct
of the hunted, be rushed at the ﬁrst turning, through a gate, up some
steps, along to the bastion, which rose behind the powder magazines.
He darted along some pleasant green walk under the massy elms,
till he reached the ﬁrst sentry-box, in which stood the sentry, a
stalwart Highlander, sheltering from the storm.
Instead of ﬁring on him, as the desperate fugitive expected, the
man stepped swiftly aside, and the panting runner, divining his
friendly purpose, ran into the box.
The soldier swiftly resumed his station, and stood looking out
with an immovable face as before, while the hunted convict, in the '
darkness in the narrow space at his side, stood face inward, close
pressed to the wooden wall, soaked to the skin, and panting in hard
gasps that were almost groans, yet sufﬁciently master of himself to
press a wad of folded trouser on the bleeding wound, which proved
to be only a ﬂesh graze, but which might ruin the friendly Soot by
its damning stains on the ﬂoor of the box.
“ Quiet’s the word,” said the hospitable sentry, and nothing
more.
Some minutes passed. Everard’s breathing became less labored,
and his reﬂections more agonized; the thunder-peals grew less tre-
mendous, while the rain became heavier. The pursuers had lost
sight of their prey in the road before he reached the gate, and had
been thrown off the scent, while still sending searchers in all direc-
tions. Two of these turned up through the gate, and one explored

all the nooks and crannies of the crescent-shaped space walled by
the bastion which sheltered the powder-magazines, while the other
examined the path itself, and interrogated the sentry.
“ Past the Garrison Chapel, toward High Street; out of my
range,” he said coolly; and the pursuer, calling his comrade, ﬂew
with him along the bastion, not stopping to inquire of the other
sentries. “ Gone away,” observed the Highlander to his quivering
guest, who had feared lest his light-colored dress might betray him
behind the sentry, whose plaid and kilt and feather bonnet ﬁlled
up all of the opening not darkened by his tall ﬁgure. “Off the
scent. What next, mate? ”
“ Heaven knows! I only hope I may not ruin you. If I get 011'
I will not forget you. My friends are well off, and I am—"
“Henry Everard. Seen you often with your gang—recognized
at once.” \
“Good heavens! ” cried Everard, not seeing his host’s handsome
I face, but feeling a vague stir of memory at his voice; “who are
you i ”
“Private Walker, 17 9th Highlanders. Was Balfour of Christ-
church.” .
“ Balfour? What! come to this? What did we not expect of
you? ”
“Wear a better coat than yours. Manby rough on you-hard
lines. Do anything for you.”
“You always were a good-hearted fellow. And I was innocent,
Balfour; I had not the faintest grudge against the poor fellow.
But how did you come to this? You took honors.”
“ Governor poor—large family—small allowance at Cambridge
—debts—Jews. Called to Bar—small allowance again—no briefs
-—more debts—more Jews. Governor suggests Australia—all up
here—didn’t see boiling tallow in Australia—if a day-laborer, why
not in England? Always liked the service—enlisted—Hussar regi-
ment—jolly life—saw service—full sergeant-time expired. Sent
into Reserve—not allowed to re-enlist—name of Smith. Tried civil
life—down on-my luck again—deserted from reserve—re-enlisted in
Highlanders—name of Walker—enlistment fraudulent—liable to
imprisonment—foreign service soon—all right. Now for you? ”
Everard had to confess that he did not in the least know what
to do next, unless he could hide til! the darkness rendered his dress
unobservable. The moment he was seen he would be recognized

anywhere as a convict. Various schemes were revolved between
them as rapidly as possible, for it was essential that Everard should
leave the sentry-box for a better hiding-place before the rapid
diminishing of the storm should once more open the bastion to ob-
servers. ‘
The massive foliage of the elms hard by might have hidden a
regiment, and Balfour had observed that the branches attracted no
suspicion on the part of the pursuers, and, as the forking of the
boughs did not begin till many feet of the ground, and the broad,
smooth trunk offered not the smallest foot-hold, it was impossible
for a man to climb into them unassisted.
But the sentry remembered that a stout rope had been ﬂung
aside there by some gunners busy cleaning the cannon on the has-
tion that day. If Everard could ﬁnd this, and ﬂing it over a bough,
he might hoist himself up. If he could not ﬁnd it, the soldier
offered to come and lend him his shoulder—an action that might
attract observation even in the darkness of the storm, since that
part of the bastion was commanded by many windows, and that
would, if discovered, bring certain ruin upon both men.
Everard darted swiftly from the box and groped about in the
wet grass till he‘ found the rope. This, in the still blinding rain, he
threw over the lowest stout branch, keeping one end, and fearful
lest the other would not descend within reach. After a couple of
casts, however, he succeeded in bringing the second end, in which
he had fastened a stone, within easy reach, and grasping both, and
planting his feet against the broad bole, slippery with wet, man-
aged to struggle up with moderate speed. He was half-way up,
and, pausing a moment to steady himself and look round, saw to
his inﬁnite horror that he was exactly opposite to, and in full view
and ﬁring range of, the sentry on the opposite end of the bastion,
which was roughly crescent-shaped.
Outlined as he was, and almost stationary against the tree-trunk,
he presented the easiest target for a moderate range shot. The man
was in no hurry for his easy prey, he lifted his musket slowly, while
Everard paused, transﬁxed with horror. The sentry seemed as if
waiting for him to rise into a still better position for a shot. Ever-
ard slipped down, expecting to hear a ball sing over his head, if not
into his body; but there was no report, and he stood irresolute a
moment, seeking where to ﬂy.
A signal of warning and haste from Balfour made him once

more grasp his rope in desperation, and climb through the peril of
the sentry’s aim. A ﬂash of lightning showed him his foe standing
as before, with his musket planted ﬁrmly in front of him; he was
supporting himself placidly with both hands clasped upon it, and
his head bent slightly down, almost as if he had fallen asleep at his
post.
But Everard knew that the most careless sentries do not fall
asleep in the process of aiming at fugitive prisoners, and pressed on
till he reached the ﬁrst fork, where he rested, wondering why no shot
had been ﬁred. The fact was, the rain was beating straight into the
man’s face, and he had much ado to see a yard before him, and had
raised his musket merely to see if the breech was properly shielded
from the wet. Everard, however, hoisting up his rope, climbed
higher into his green fortress, expecting nothing less than to have
it soon riddled in all directions by a fusillade from below. To his
surprise he heard Balfour’s signal of safety, and gladly responded to
it; for they had framed a little code of signals before parting.
It was comparative luxury to the weary, wounded man to sit
astride a branch, with his back against the trunk, and the foot of
the wounded limb supported upon a lower bough, and he gave a
sigh of deep relief, and reﬂected that he was at last, after all those
dreary years of bondage, free. Balfour could do nothing till he was
off guard, which would happen in another half hour. Nothing could
be done during the next sentry’s guard, because it would be impos-
sible to get at him and see how far he could be trusted; but if any
subsequent sentry proved manageable, and if Balfour could get
a pass for the night, he might bring him some sort of clothing,
and then, under favorable circumstances, he might get off. And
then ?
The storm abated, the last low muttering-s of thunder died away
in the distance, the rain ceased, and the evening sun shone out with
golden clearness. Some of the long slanting beams pierced the
green roof of his airy prison, and fell hopefully upon the fugitive’s
face. He heard the sentry’s measured tread below, and then the
change of guard; the hum of the town, and the noises from the
vessels at anchor, came, mingled with distant bugle calls, to his
lonely tower. The light faded, the sun went down in glory, the
gun on the bastion ﬁred the sunset, the parish church chimed half-
past eight, the sounds from sea and shore came more distinct on the
quieting night air, and he heard the band of a Highland regiment

begin its skirl of pipes on the Clarence pier. It was probably Bal-
four’s regiment. ' 1
Poor Balfour! He fell to thinking of his unfortunate lot, much
as he had to occupy his thoughts with regard to his own immediate
destiny. Only that week, Balfour’s father, General Sir Ronald Bal-
four, K. G. 13., as general commanding at Portsmouth, had reviewed
the troops, Balfour himself being more than once face to face with
his father. This he told Everard, adding that on a recent foreign
royal visit to Portsmouth the 179th had formed a guard of honorto
the royal guests, and that Admiral Everard had walked down the
lane of which he made a part, in the wake of the royal party,
chancing to come to a full stop just on his level.
Balfour, the star of the Debating Society, the man whom they
had hoped to see on the Woolsack; what a fall was here! “ Unlucky
beggar-l ” was the philosophic Highlander’s sole comment on his ill-
starred destiny. A good fellow, and a. man without a vice.
The air was chill after sunset. Everard, motionless on his airy
perch, bare-headed, and in his shirt—sleeves, was wet to the skin, and
shivered with a double chill after the heat of his hard labor in the
sultry afternoon. His wound ached till he began to fear it might
lame him, and his hunger waxed keener as the night deepened and
the cold increased. The stars came out and looked at him with
their friendly, quieting gaze. He could see the sparkle of lights in
the water and in the town; he could make out the lights of the
admiral’s signal-station on his housetop above the dock-yard.
Which man-of-war was Keppel’s? he wondered, knowing noth-
ing even of the outside world that was so near him. The chimes of
the parish church told him the hours, and he knew when the guard
would be relieved.
It was a weary night; its minutes lagged by leaden-paced. He
thought their long procession would never end; and yet there was
a strange, delicious enchantment in the feeling that he had at last
broken the bars of that iron prison, with its terrible bondage of un-
bending routine and drudgery. The thick foliage of the elm still
held the wet, which every passing breath of the night wind shook
on to the grass belowiin a miniature shower. The moon rose and
wandered in pale majesty across the sweet blue sky—such a free,
broad night sky as had not blessed his eyes for years and years; its
beams hung his green fortress roof with pearls and trembling dia-
monds, falling over and anon to the earth. Sentinel after sentinel

came on guard below, but there was no friendly signal from beneath.
He had descended to the lowest bough to catch the slightest sound.
The watch was passing; the early dawn would shine on the next
watch, and, if help did not come before the sunrise, he would have
to wait till the following night, wet, starved, suﬁ'ering as he was.
But no; there is the welcome signal at last.
Quickly he gave the answering signal; and, bending down in the
darkness, heard the following sentence above the sound of the sen-
tinel‘s backward and forward steps: “ Sentry blind and deaf—sneak
off to right. Catch.”
Something ﬂew up to him in the dark, and, after two misses, he
caught it; and then, rising to where a rift in the foliage let in a shaft
of rays from the waning moon, nnfastened his bundle, which was
roughly tied with string.
A battered but, very large so that it would hide the close-cropped
head; a boatman’s thick blue jersey; and apair of wide trousers,
worn and stained, with a belt to fasten them; also some second-
hand boots-such was the simple but suﬂicient wardrobe which
Balfour had purchased with his slender means, and brought him at
deadly risk.
Everard was able to discard every rag of the tell-tale prison
garb, stamped all over as it was with the broad arrow, and, securing
the dangerous garments to a branch of the tree, invested himself in
the contents of the bundle—an occupation that took so long, owing
to the inconvenience of hi lofty dressing-room, that the eastern
sky was brightening, and the friendly sentinel’s watch almost ex-
pired, by the time he was ready to descend from his perch, which
he did noiselessly and apparently unobserved by the sentry.
Then, slowly and painfully-for his limbs were cramped and
chilled, and his wound ached—he glided behind the dark boles till
he reached he steps, and, descending them, found to his dismay that
the gate was locked.
CHAPTER V.
THERE is almost always some small but vitally important hitch
in the best-laid human plans, and the bitch in Balfour’s arrangement
was that he forgot the nightly locking of the gate leading on to the

bastion. He had approached the tree from the other side, passing
the sentries, being challenged by them, and giving the word in
- reply.
Everard knew the bastion, and had had many a pleasant stroll
there in old days, when stopping with his father when in port, and.
he knew well that his only course was now to climb the gate, which
he could not do without noise, and which was in no case an easy
feat, the plain boards of which the gate was made being high, and
the top thickly studded with those dreadful crooked nails, which
look like alphabets gone wrong. and do dreadful damage both to
hands and clothing.
Fortunately, the moon had set, the sun was not yet risen, and
the darkness favored him—a darkness which every moment threat-
ened to dissipate. He struggled up with as little sound as possible,
with set teeth and a beating heart, lacerating his hands cruelly.
Then, having gained the top—not without some rents in his scanty
clothing—he grasped the nail-studded ridge and sprang down. Alasi
not to the ground, for one of the crooked nails caught in the back I
part of the wide trousers, and, with a rending of cloth and a knock-
ing 'of his feet against the boards, he found himself arrested midway,
and suspended by the waist against the gate, like a mole on a keep-
er’s paling.
Had he been caught in front. he might have raised himself and
somehow torn himself free; but, being hooked thus in the rear, he
was almost helpless, and his slightest effort to free himself brought
the heels of his boots knocking loudly against the gate as if to ob-
tain admittance, which was the last thing he wanted. Meantime,
the minutes ﬂew on, the darkness was breaking fast; before long
the sun would rise, and disclose him hung thus helplessly on his
nail to the earliest passer-by, who would probably be a policeman.
A beautiful faint ﬂush of rose-red suddenly shot up over the
eastern sky, and the brown shadows lessened around him. He
heard footsteps echoing through the dewy stillness, and struggled
with blind desperation. The rose-red turned deep glowing orange,
objects became more and more distinct before him, the street lamps
sickened, a soft orange ray shot straight from the sea across the
common, through the leaves of the tree shadowing the gate, on to
the fugitive's cheek. At the same instant he heard the boom of the
sunrise gun; it was day.
The footsteps approached nearer and nearer; ou the bastion he

heard the change of watch. He felt that all was lost, and yet, in
his mental tension, his chief consciousness was of the awful beauty
of the dawn, the dewy quiet and freshness brooding over the great
town, and—strange contrast !-—the grotesque absurdity of his situa-
tion. He heard the lively twitter of the birds waking in the trees,
and admired the soft radiance of the ruddy beams on the sleeping
town; and then something gave way, and he found himself full
length on the pavement.
The echoing footsteps had as yet brought no ﬁgure round the
corner, and Everard welcomed the hard salute of the paving-stones
as the ﬁrst greeting of freedom, and, quickly picking himself up, he
fell into the slow, slouching walk he had observed in tramps, and
moved on, adjusting his disordered garments as best he might. The
footsteps proved indeed to be those of a policeman, whose eyes were
dazzled with the level sunbeams which he faced, and who gave him
a dissatisﬁed but not suspicious glance, and passed on.
Everard drew a deep breath and limped on, trying to disguise
the lameness of the wounded limb, which he feared might betray
him, and thrust his torn hands into the pockets of the trousers
which had so nearly ruined him. His surprise and joy were great
on touching with his left hand a substance which proved to be
broad and cheese, which he instantly devoured, and with his right
a few pence, and, what moved him to tears of gratitude for Ba]-
four’s thoughtful kindness, a short brier-wood pipe, well-seasoned,
and doubtless the good fellow’s own, a screw of cheap tobacco,
and some matches. He had not touched tobacco for nine years.
A drinking-fountain supplied him with the draught of water
which his fevered throat and parched lips craved; it also enabled
him to wash off some of the blood and dirt from his torn hands.
And then, dragging his stiff and wounded limb slowly along, and
eating his stale bread and cheese in the sweet sunshine, he made his
morning orisons in the dewy quiet of the yet unwakened town, and
felt a glow of intense gratitude, which increased as the food and
water strengthened him, and exercise warmed his chill and stiffened
frame.
He was glad to see the houses open one by one, and the streets
begin to ﬁll; he thought he should attract less attention among
numbers. He passed groups of free laborers hurrying to the dock-
yard to work, and it gave him an eerie shudder to think that some
of them, whose faces he knew, might recognize him. His terror

increased when he saw a light on a workmau’s face—a face he
knew well, for the man had slipped over the side of the dock one
morning, and was in imminent danger of beingjammed by some ﬂoat-
ing timber, when Everard had promptly sprung after him, regardless
of prison discipline, and held him up, for he could not swim, till a
rope was brought, and the two men were hauled out, bruised but
otherwise uninjured.
The man stopped: Everard went straight on, not appearing to
see him, and, after a few seconds, to his dismay, heard footsteps
running after him. He dared not quicken his pace, lest he should
attract attention, but the food he was eating stuck in his throat, and
his face paled. His pursuer gained his side, and, seizing his hand,
pressed some pence into it, saying, in a low tone, “Mum’s the
word, mate! All the ready I’ve got. Simon Jones, 80, King
Street, for help. Better not stop."
Then he turned and resumed his road, telling his companions
something about a chum of his down on his luck, and Everard
slouched on with a lightened heart, and increased gratitude for the
pence. He had now nearly two shillings in his pockets, and when
he had lighted Balfour’s brier-wood, he felt like a king. The last
time he handled a coin was when he gave pence to a blind man.
sitting by the police station at Oldport, just before his arrest. He
bought needle and thread to repair the tremendous ﬁssure in the
unlucky garments which had played him so ill a trick, and in two
hours’ time found himself well clear of the town and suburbs. '
Presently he found a shed used for sheltering cattle, but now empty.
This he entered, and, having with some difﬁculty drawn the chief
tents in his clothes together, washed his wound in a trough placed
for some cattle to drink from, and bandaged that and the worst
hurts in his hand with the handkerchief in which the bread and
cheese was wrapped, lay down on some litter behind a turnip-cut-
ting machine, and in a moment was fast asleep, utterly oblivious of
prisons, wounds, and hunger.
When he awoke, with the vague consciousness of change which
heralds the ﬁrst waking after a decisive event in life, he felt a
strangely unprotected sensation on looking up at the blue sky.
which showed through the gaps in the slightly thatched roof, and
seeing a green pasture, with cattle grazing upon it, spread broad
and sunny before him on the unwalled side of the shed, instead of
the close white walls of his cell. His sleep had been so profound

and refreshing that it took him some seconds to recall the events
which preceded it. Hunger and the sun told him it was late after-
noon; prudence bid him rest the wounded leg, but hunger coun-
seled him to go out and buy food ﬁrst.
A short walk along the dusty high-road brought him to a little
general shop at the entrance to a village, where he bought a penny
leaf and a little cheese, and was confounded by the aﬁ‘ability of the
mistress of the shop, a tidy young woman, with a child in her
arms.
“ Warm walking,” she observed, as she weighed his cheese.
"It is warm,” he faltersd, with a strange embarrassment; for
he had been addressed by no woman since the bitter hour of his
parting from Lilian, nine years ago, and had a confused idea that
he must be very respectful to every one in virtue of his low posi-
tion. '
“Tramped far?” she added, wrapping the morsel of cheese in
paper.
“No, ma’am; only from Portsmouth," he replied; and, taking
his purchase with a “Thank you ” and a touch of his hat, he was
limping out, when the woman called him back. “Seems to me
you’ve been ill, and you’ve seen better days by the sound of your
tongue,” she said. “ What have you out today i ”
“ A good breakfast of bread and cheese.”
“ And you just out of hospital, as I can see! Poor chap! and
your hand bad, too. Come into my room here, do. Here‘s some
bacon and eggs my master left from dinner; I’ll warm it up in a
minute. We shan’t miss it, and it will do you a sight more good
than that poor bit you bought. Come on in, do, the children and
me is just getting our teas.”
Everard’s instinctive courtesy bade him accept this kind oﬂ’er,
and he got a cup of hot tea and a good meal of warm food, and,
what was better than all, the refreshing sense of human kindness,
and departed with gratitude, having won golden opinions from his
hostess by his quiet civility and wise observations upon the teething
of her infant.
He was grateful also for the hint about the hospital and the re-
ﬁnement of his speech, and resolved to adopt the broad Hampshire
drawl, familiar to him from babyhood.
He trudged on with a better heart, bent chieﬂy on ﬁnding a
refuge for the night. As he approached a pretty cottage, with a

lawn before it and a garden behind, a pony-carriage passed him and
drew up before the gate. It was driven by a lady in mourning,
who looked inquiringly round before alighting. Everard ran up,
touching his hat, and held the pony’s head, while she got out, eu-
tered the wicket gate, rang the bell, and was admited by a smart
maid.
Here was luck at the very beginning. The lady, whose face he
had not observed in the hurry, but whose dress and appearance as
she walked up to the door he had ample leisure to study, was good
for at least a shilling, and would ask him no questions; he might
soon hope to buy a shirt. He patted the pony’s sleek neck and
knocked off a ﬂy or two, and wished he knew of a high-road stud-
ded with ponies waiting to be held.
Then he looked at the two pretty children the lady had left in
her carriage, and their sweet faces ﬁlled him with a sense of old
familiar home-happiness, and his memory called up a pleasant sum-
mer scene on the lawn at Malbonrue—of the twins, with little Ma-
rion between them, pretending to chase the big boy, Harry. who
ﬂed backward as they advanced. He remembered the twins’ black
dresses, which they were for one of the brothers they lost in infancy,
and the scent of the lime-blossom overhead.
The children in the pony-carriage were prattling merrily to-
gether, and making comments on all they saw, himself not except-
ed. He had incautiously taken oﬁ_his hot felt hat for a moment to
cool himself as he stood by the pony, and this action greatly inter-
ested the younger child, a blue-eyed boy.
“Why is all ’00 hair cut off?” he asked, earnestly regarding
him. “ Has ’00 been to pizzen 7 "
“ I have been ill, sir, and my head was shaved," replied Everard,
coloring with dismay, and quickly jamming his hat well on, while
the little maiden rebuked her brother for his rudeness.
“He did not mean to be rude,” she explained; “but we are
staying with our! grandpapa in the dock-yard, and Ernest sees the
convicts go by every day, so we play at convicts, and he cut his
little brother’s hair off to make it seem more real. Wasn’t it
naughty ? ”
“Very naughty," replied Everard, charmed with the music of
the sweet little reﬁned voices, a music he had not heard so long.
The little girl reminded him of his old pet, Winnie.
“Why didn’t ’00 die?” continued the boy. “Mine uncle did

\
die. The soldiers put him on the big gun, and shooted him
when he was in the ground, and the music played, and mamma
kied.”
“Hush, Ernie! I am glad you got well, poor maul " said the
little maid, demurely.
“When I grow up,” proceeded the boy, “I sail be a admiral,
like grandpa, and have sips and guns and a sword."
Everard congratulated him on his choice; but his little sister said
he had better be a clergyman like their father, and make people good
and preach.
“I don’t want to peach,” said the little man, pathetically. “I
want to be a admiral, and have sips and guns and swords.”
Then the door opened, and the lady came out, accompanied by
another lady in a widow’s cap, who nodded to the children and
smiled, though she had just been weeping, and went in; and Everard,
with an intelligence sharpened, almost to agony by the children‘s
conversation, looked searchineg from under the hat he had slouched
over his brows at the dark-haired, dark-eyed lady, as she returned
to her carriage, replacing the veil, which she had raised during her
visit, evidently a sorrowful one, since she too had been shedding
tears.
Everard’s heart throbbed almost to bursting as he met the dark
eyes, once so full of mirth and life, and observed the familiar car-
riage of the still slender ﬁgure. It was Marion, beyond all doubt;
Marion, altered indeed, but still Marion, the favorite sister, the
darling of his youth—that t-raitor’o wife, as he muttered between
his ﬁercely ground teeth. Twice nine years might have passed over
her head, to judge by her looks. The joyous elasticity was gone
from her carriage; she was pale, and there were lines of settled
care on the once sparkling face.
She smiled on her children, a tender, sweet smile, but with no
happiness in it, and hoped they had been good, as she got into the
carriage and took the reins, not observing the man, who stood by
the pony with his breath coming gaspingly, and his heart torn by
a medley of passionate emotions. He stepped back when she had
taken the reins and whip, and touched his hat as she drove on, and
then stopped on catching sight of him, and drew out her purse,
whence she took a shilling, which she gave him. He touched his
hat once more, and was again stepping back, when she beckoned
him forward and addressed him.

“Are you out of work? " she asked; and he replied slowly in
the aﬂirmative.
“That is strange,” she continued, with a little severity. “A
man of your age and strength ought to have no diﬁiculty in get
ting work just now. The farmers wantmen, and the dock~yard is
taking in extra hands for the extension works. I hope it is not
drink? ”
“It is nine years since I touched any drink,” he replied, for the
second time moved to discover himself and ask for the money in-
dispensible to his safety, and for the second time restrained by the
thought that she was the wife of that traitor, whose money would
have been like ﬁre to his touch. ‘
“He was ill, and they did cut oﬁ him hair,” explained the boy.
“You think of nothing but cutting hair, darling,” said Marion,
smiling the tender, sad smile again; “I am sorry for that,” she
added, addressing Everard kindly. “ And you are looking for‘
work? Have you been long out of hospital? Where are your
friends? What! no friends? This is very sad. Try the dock-yard.
I will speak for you to the oﬂicials. My father is port-admiral.
But I am going home to-morrow; my husband preaches at home
on Sunday. 01' stay! they want a man at once to mow the lawn
at this cottage; their gardener is ill. Can you mow? ”
“ Yes, ma’am.”
“ Say Mrs. Maitland recommends you. I am sure I may recom-
mend you. You look honest and steady. I wish I could help you,
but I have so little time now. Can you read? Yes? Then I will
give you a little paper my husband wrote specially for working-
men. Out of that packet, Marion.”
The little girl’s sweet gold curls drooped over the bag, which
she opened, and she drew out a great bundle of tracts, whence she
took one and handed it to Everard with the Maitland grace and
smile. Her eyes were like Lilian’s, and, looking into their sweet
depths, Everard let the tract fall clumsily into his brown band,
where one of the lacerations was bleeding afresh, so that the paper
was quickly stained with his blood.
“ Oh, his poor hand, mother! " cried the child, pitifully. “ Mayn’t
I give him my handkerchief to tie it up? ”
Everard objected, saying any rag would serve the purpose; but
Marion bid him take it, saying that children should learn to give.
Then the boy took a box half-full of chocolate-comﬁts and pressed
16

it on him, “ To make ’00 hand well,” he said. Marion smiled, and
the tears clouded Everard’s eyes, and he remembered how the
twins used to give away their very garments to tramps unless closely
watched.
He stood long looking after the pony-carriage till the last gleam
of the two golden heads vanished, and the mist over his eyes fell in
two great drops on his face; then he remembered his chance of
work at the cottage, and walked up to the door in some trepida-
tion, and pulled the bell. He thought of Marion’s tears for Leslie,
and wondered if she would shed any if she heard of his death.
Would she be relieved, as the others doubtless would, and think it
best so? Did she ever tell the children of another uncle, their
father’s friend, lost before they were born? “ Mamma kied ” when
the soldier uncle was borne with honor to his grave; but she let
her children play at convicts, and watch their dolorous daily pro-
cession for pastime.
The door opened. “ We don’t want no trumps here! ” cried a
shrill voice; and a hand banged the door in his face again, and he
stood confounded in the porch. Then he stepped back and took a
survey of the house, and was much relieved to see the young widow
at a writing-table, just within an open window on the ground ﬂoor.
He went up when he caught her eye. “ If you please, ma’am,
I heard you wanted a gardener," he said, lifting his hat.
“And they banged the door in your face,” she replied gently.
“ But why did you not go to the back door? The girl was natu-
rally angry.” '
The back door vwas another custom to learn. He faltered out an
apology, and then proffered his request for work. “ I am not a
regular gardener, but I can mow and do odd jobs, and badly want
work, being just out of hospital,” he said.
“I am only a lodger,” replied the widow; “but I will ask.”\
And she rang the bell and summoned the landlady, and, to Everard’s
surprise, asked her as a favor to employ him. “ You see that photo-
graph, Mrs. Brown? ” she said, pointing to one of an ofﬁcer in regi-
mentals on the table before her. “ Now, don’t you see a likeness? "
“ To whom?” asked the bewildered woman; and Mrs. Everard
indicated Henry by a slight gesture.
“ You will think me foolish, but I can not mistrust one so like—”
Here she burst into tears, and Mrs. Brown lifted her hands in dis-
may.

“Poor dearl her wits are troubled by her loss,” she thought.
“ That ragged tramp like the poor gentlemen in his smart uniform,
indeed! ”
“ I certainly see no likeness, ma’am,” she replied, after a long
and depreciating glance at the tattered ﬁgure on the lawn, “ but I‘ll
do anything to pleasure you; and I do want the grass done, and
even if the man isn’t honest—”
“ I was to say that Mrs. Maitland recommended me. I held her
pony just now," interposed Everard.
This ended the discussion ; and in a minute or two Everard found
himself, scythe in hand, busily mowing the little lawn, to the great
discomfort of his torn hands, which he had to bind afresh as well as
he could. However, he got through his task in a couple of hours,
swept the turf clean, nailed up a creeper or two, and did one or
two odd jobs about the place for the damsel who had dismissed him
with such scorn, and did not leave the cottage till after dark.
Whenever he paused in his work and looked up, he saw Mrs.
Everard‘s eyes bent wistfully upon him, and knew that she was
comparing his features with Leslie‘s. Marion had not recognized
the playfellow and companion of her youth, but this woman's eyes
were made keen-sighted by love and sorrow, and traced out the
ordinary fraternal resemblance beneath the disguise of the weather-
browned, tattered vagrant. His heart warmed to her and to the
child, who ran about, prattling and getting in the way of his unsus~
pected kinsman. If Leslie had been alive, he felt that he could have
asked him for succor.
That night he passed on a half-made rick of hay, a fragrant.
warm, and luxurious couch, sheltered from the sky by a sheet or”
sailcloth spread tentwise to keep off showers.
He thought it better not to seek work so near the town, since
he had wherewith to get food for the day, so he set 01f northward,
and walked as far as his wounded leg would let him, revolving many
schemes for escape in his mind as he went along. He took out his
tract, “ Plain Words for Plain Men,” and read it with inward sar-
casm. It was beautifully written and lucidly expressed; by the
Rev. Canon Maitland, Rector of St. Swithun’s, at some country
town, Rural Dean; author of several religious works set down in
due order.
“So he is a canon, is he?” muttered Everard, ﬁercely, as he
limped along in the burning sunshine. “How long does it take

to grow into an archbishop, I wonder? And how much damned
hypocrisy and lying and treachery does it take to make one? ” and
he tore the paper into a hundred fragments and dashed it into the
road-dust, where he stamped savagely upon it. Then he thought of
Marion and the sweet children who were kind to the ragged va-
grant, and his heart contracted with a wild pain.
At noon he rested in a wood, where a thick undergrowth of
hazels made a shelter from eyes as well as from the sun. On the
mossed and tangled roots of an ash tree, he sat at the edge of the
hazel wall, just where the ground sloped down to a little stream,
which bickered over its mossy pebbles with a pleasant sound, and
caught in its tiny wave cool lights glancing through the wind-stirred
boughs above it.
This was better than prison, Everard thought, as he stretched
his weary, hot limbs at length on the dry, short grass, and gazed
up through the gently waving, sun-steeped leaves at glimpses of
blue sky, and listened to the brook’s low and soothing song and the
whispering of the laughing leaves, and smelt the vague, delicious
scent of the woodlands, and forgot the aching of his wounds, and
the cough which had shaken him since the chills of his night in the
wet elm tree.
For the moment he wanted nothing more. It would be sweet,
after those long years of toil and prison, to wander thus for ever in
the sweet summer weather quite alone, his whole being open to the
half-forgotten inﬂuences of free earth and sky, ﬁelds and streams
and woods, sunrises and sunsets and solemn nights marked by the
quiet marshaling of the stars, till he was healed of the grievous
hurts of his long agony. Even the hunted feeling, the necessity for
hiding and being ever on the alert, even the danger that dogged
every step, was refreshing and stimulating. This wild life was full
of adventure, and roused his faculties, which the iron hand of bond-
age had benumbed.
The simple meal he had purchased tasted deliciously, the brook’s
water was like sparkling wine in comparison with that of the prison.
For company his cell boasted at most an occasional spider; while
here in the wood were a thousand friendly guests, ﬂying, creeping,
swimming, humming, peeping at him with bright, shy eyes, chirp-
ing, and even singing a fragmentary song in the noonday heat.
A wren, beguiled by his long stillness and the tempting crumbs
he strewed, hopped up within an inch of his motionless hand, and

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 245
peeked pertly at the unusual dainty. Everard remembered the
wren he had seen on his last day of liberty, the wren which nestled
on Lilian’s muﬂ' and let her touch him, while he and Cyril looked
on, and Cyril said that it was Lilian‘s guilelessness which gave her
such power over dumb creatures. He remembered asking Cyril
how he, who was equally guileless, had lost this power, and Cyril‘s
agonized rejoinder, “Henry, I am a man.”
CHAPTER VI.
AFTER his simple meal, Everard spread his treasures on the grass
before him, and eyed them lovingly. It was so long since he had
possessed anything save his own soul, and that he could scarcely
keep from the devil’s clutch, that he enjoyed them more than those
who possess their own bodies and the labor of their hands, and per-
chanee much more, can imagine.
The ﬁrst treasure was the box of comﬁts, with the gay picture
_on the lid, which had doubtless charmed the innocent gaze of its
boy owner. It had contracted a slight stain, which vexed him, but
he ate one of the comﬁts slowly and luxuriously, and it made a
glorious dessert. By its side, carefully secured from ﬂying away
by a pebble, lay the little handkerchief with its initials, M. L. M.
-He had not used it for his hand, but had begged rags instead.
It seemed sacrilege to make use of this sole token of little Mar-
ion’s sweet nature, but it would be a capital bag for the money which
glittered on the grass before him, Marion‘s shilling among it; that
he resolved to change only in dire need. Balfour‘s pipe was the
next treasure, and into that he put the last of the screw of tobacco,
and smoked it with a happy heart, thinking gratefully of the woman
who gave him meat, and of Leslie's widow and her kindness to him.
She too had brought him out a cup of tea during his mowing, and
the little child had carried him a great hunch of seed-cake, and
though these had been welcome enough, the gentle words and looks
had far outweighed them. Musing on these things, he fell fast
asleep, with the unguarded treasures by his side, and did not wake
till late afternoon, startled, but reassured to ﬁnd his possessions in-
tact.

246 TIIE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND.
He had hitherto chosen ﬁeld-paths as much as possible, always
keeping a high-road in sight, and shaping his course by the sun;
but now it became necessary to take to the road, which was full of
dangers for him. He met a policeman or two, each of whom eyed
him curiously and doubtfully, and one of whom accosted him, and
put him through a series of questions as to whence he came, whither
he went, and what was his name and occupation; to which Ever-
ard, with inward tremors, answered calmly enough.
His name was Stone; he was just out of hospital; he was tramp-
ing to his friends, who lived on the other side of London, and was
glad to do odd jobs on the road, if the policeman could put him in
the way of such. The policeman, who was not a very brilliant fel-
low, was perfectly satisﬁed to let him pass, though he was actually,
like all the police around, on the lookout for a man of his height,
ﬁgure, and appearance.
As he drew near a little village, he saw a provision-wagon,
drawn by a pair of horses, standing outside a public-house; the
good fellow who drove it was absent, and doubtless refreshing him-
self in the cosy bar within. Everard passed on through the village,
and read the milestone at the other end, which recorded the num-
ber of miles to London. He had only lessened the record by twelve
that day, and made up his mind to tramp far into the night, if his
strength held out.
A great clatter suddenly arose behind him, and, turning, he saw
the provision-wagon pelting down the sloping village street with no
one on the box. He rushed back, putting up his arms and shouting;
one or two men followed his example, and at the top of the bill he
saw the driver, red‘faced and breathless, pursuing the horses, whip
in hand. The runaways centered on, and Everard threw himself
upon them, grasping the near horse’s head, but he was carried oﬁ
his feet and dropped; then he rose and caught them again, till he
succeeded in stopping them, after a very plucky struggle. The
driver offered him a lift, which he gratefully accepted, together
with some tobacco, and they jogged on till night, when they reached
a country town.
Passing the town, Everard walked on till after midnight, and
then slept under a hay-stack. Early next morning he went into a
farm-yard, where he saw a farmer sending his men oﬁ‘ to work, and
boldly asked for a job, and found himself, after a little hesitation
and questioning, among a haymaking gang, with whom he worked

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN, MAITLAND. 247
till evening, obtaining permission to sleep in a barn that night, and
the promise of work on the Monday, that being Saturday night.
He was glad enough to lie still that Sunday morning, and rest on
the bundles of straw which made his couch, listening to the drowsy
chime of the church bells, and enjoying the luxury of a roof which
was not a prison, until increasing hunger compelled him to rise soon
after noon. As he passed through the farmyard, he saw a red-armed
maid feeding the pigs with skim milk and cold potatoes, on which
be cast as wistful an eye as the prodigal did on the swine’s hnsks.
He was passing on, when the farmer’s wife, rustling in her Sun-
day silk, came in on her way from church; Henry touched his hat
and opened the gate for her, while she asked him rather sharply why
he was hanging about the place. He told her that, being very weary,
he had but just risen, and promised not to come again till night.
“We are obliged to be careful about harboring strangers,” she
said, softened by his reply. “ We never know who they may be;
escaped convicts from Portsmouth as often as not. One convict
got loose only the other day in the thunder-storm, and may be bid-
ing about here, for all we know. Where are you going to get din-
ner? At the public-house? A bad place. Maria, bring out the
_ pie that was left yesterday, and a mug of ale. And after you’ve
eaten it, you can be off. There‘s church this afternoon, if you’d only
got clothes to go in.”
Everard dined very happily on the low stone wall of the court-
yard, though a meat pasty with good gravy is not the most conven—
ient dish to eat with the ﬁngers. He effected a total clearance,
however, to the deep admiration of Maria, who watched to see that
he did not make away with the dish and mug, and went on his way
refreshed.
He got paper, pen, and ink at a public-house that afternoon, and
wrote along letter to Lilian, telling her of his escape, and asking
her to send a few pounds to him at the post-ofﬁce of that little vil-
lage.
He would have felt less pain in applying for money to Lilian
than to any of those on whom he had a more direct claim, but who ,
had so totally cast him off. As it chanced, however, she, had his
watch and chain, which he had lent to Mrs. Maitland 0n the very
morning of his arrest, and he only needed the value of that for his
immediate purpose, which was to get decent working garments, and,
as soon as his hair was grown, to try for a passage to America. If

Lilian cared to apply to his family, and they offered large aid,
well. He would not refuse help, save from Cyril; but he would
not ask it.
He worked on for three or four days, till the farmer had got all
his hay in; then he was obliged to try elsewhere, and, in trying,
lost several days. Every few days he returned to Hawkburne to
see if there were any answer to his letter, and every time he got a
negative from the postmistress a keener disappointment seized him.
He got a day’s work here and an hour’s job there during the next
fortnight, but no regular work.
When he got money, he dared not spend it on a good meal; he
knew that he must husband it for the days when there was no
work. What with poor food and open-air sleeping, and the cough
and rheumatism which he got that night in the damp tree, he fell
into poor condition, and, though his hands were almost healed, and
the gunshot-wound no longer caused him to limp, people did not
care to employ such a gaunt, starved, hollow-checked man.
He had passed three weeks in liberty, and had been several days
without any work; for it was an unfortunate time. Haymaking was
just ended, and harvest not yet begun; everybody was at leisure,
and no one wanted any odd jobs done. His only chance was to wait
till harvest. But waiting was the diﬂiculty. He looked at the richly
waving ﬁelds, mellowing day by day, and knew by their tints that
it must be a week or two before the ﬁrst was ready for the scythe.
How close at hand harvest seemed to the farmers and their busy
housewives! Visits must be paid and purchases made in the town
because harvest was so near; but how far off it seemed to Everard,
seen across a golf of starvation! The workhouse meant certain
detection and capture; he resolved to beg.
He had been two days without food, and dragged his faint limbs
back to Hawkburne late one Saturday afternoon, to inquire once
more for the letter and remittance, which surely could not fail to
have arrived now. In the event of being absent or ill, Lilian must
have got his letter by this time, and would certainly send a reply at
once, even if by another band. It was scarcely worth while to beg
on the road back to Hawkburne, help being so near. He pulled him-
self together, and entered the little post-ofﬁce with quite a jannty
air; but one glance at the postmistress was enough. She shook her
head before he had time to speak.
“Nothing for you, Stone.”

“Are you quite sure? Have you looked?” he asked, turning
many shades paler.
“Looked? yes. And nice trouble I’ve had with you worrying
day after day these three weeks, and much thanks I get for it,” she
replied snappishly; for it was Saturday, and she had just taken her
hands from the scrubbing-pail for the third time for nothing, and
had had nobody at hand to scold all the afternoon, and the baby
had just waked with a terriﬁc screech.
“ I am sorry to have troubled you,” he returned; “ but I cannot
understand it. The letter was so important. My friends know how
desperately hard up I am, and the remittance was my own money.”
“ I dare say. Why don’t you take and go to your friends? Keep-
ing me here all day, and this blessed child "—she had run and fetched
the infant, which was screaming and kicking with ﬁfty-baby power
in her arms—“ a precious dear! and its mother worried with tramps
then. There, there! ”
“I thought, perhaps,” he added, raising his voice above the mad-
dening din, “it might have been overlooked. Accidents do happen,
ma’am, however careful people are. If you would be so kind as to
search again.”
“I dare say, indeed! There! look yourself then, nnbelieving
Jew—there, there, mother’s precious!—and get along out of my
shop with you this minute! ”
“ If you would give me a sheet of paper for the love of Heaven,
and let me write again.”
“Go on out of the shop, I tell yel ” cried the angry woman,
deaf to all his entreaties.
He sat down in the hedge by the roadside in utter despair. What
if Lilian were dead? Even then others would read the letter. Had
she forgotten him? It entered his heart like a sharp knife. But
no; Lilian could not desert even an insect in its pain. His hands,
in which his face rested, were wet; he found he had been crying in
his disappointment, and he was not ashamed. He cried on, dimly
conscious of bodily exhaustion and illness, and after a time got up,
feeling that he must do something; he knew not what.
Now that there was no longer hope to buoy him up, he found a
difﬁculty in walking in his weakness and pain. He dragged himself
to the Rectory and begged. The rector, a rich man and a generous,
drove him from the d00r. He never encouraged tramps, Stone
should go to the workhouse, he said. He next tried a comfortable

house, in which some wealthy maiden ladies lived, with no better
success. The ladies and their maids were frightened to death at
the sight of him, and threatened to send one John—who, if he
were other than a phantom of the ladies‘ own conjuring, was truly
of a singular taciturnity, and possessed of the power of making him-
self invisible—for the police.
Everard wandered down the neat gravel path with a sick heart;
and, turning up a lane, he came upon a cottage, where a poorly
dressed woman stood nursing a child at the gate. He would not
beg of her; but she, who knew him by sight and name, as having
helped at haymaking with her husband, accosted him, and asked if
he had got work and the remittance he expected. He shook his
head in reply, and she asked when he had last eaten, when he
again shook his head, and smiled faintly. She looked at him with
a pitiful expression, and bid him walk in and rest, which he was
glad to do.
Then she warmed some cold tea and cold potatoes, and set them
before him, apologizing for the poor fare, and observing that her
husband, whom Everard knew to be a drinking man, had not yet
come home with the weekly wage. Wolﬁshly as he had eyed the
good creature’s simple cookery, Everard found that he could not
ﬁnish what was set before him; he was too far gone.
That night he passed in a half-ruined and disused cattle-shed,
not far from Hawkburne, and in the morning he rose and trudged
along the high-road to the next village, asking an occasional alms
when he fell in with the church-going, but getting none. The little
belfry of the village church, the name of which he never knew, had
a sweet pea] of bells. Their sweetness charmed him to tears, and
he thought how pleasant it would be to go to church once more, a
free man; so, aﬁer the congregation had entered the little fane, be
dragged his fast-failing limbs into the churchyard, and looked in
through the lower part of the lozenged-paned window, the top of
which was open.
The interior of the cool dark church, with its low, heavy stone
arches, sculptured tombs, and rustic worshipers, ranged in orderly
quiet, was a refreshing spectacle to the outcast’s eyes, and, leaning
on the broad stone window-ledge, he saw and heard all. The
Psalms were being read, and his heart bounded strangely as he
heard, “When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion, then were we
like unto them that dream; then was our mouth ﬁlled with laughter

and our tongue with joy.” Surely his captivity was to be turned
at last.
The organ pealed, and the simple chants fell pleasantly on his
ear; but his head swam so that he lost parts of the service, and
those verses rang on through his mind. He roused up during the
Second Lesson, and heard, with deep emotion, the following pas-
sages: “ I was a stranger, and ye took me in : naked, and ye clothed
me: sick and in prison, and ye visited me; "—nnd a sensation of
awe and horror fell upon him when he realized that a whole con-
gregation of Christian worshipers sat listening to those words of
terrible and tender meaning, while he was perishing within earshot,
unregarded. Of some of them he had begged in vain; the man
who was even then reading, “Lord, when saw we thee hungry and
fed thee ? " was the very man who drove him but yesterday from his
door sick and starving; of the others he felt he dared not beg.
Then he remembered that his brother George was, perhaps, then
reading those very words, “When saw we thee in prison?” and
Cyril, the traitor Cyril, in his large town church, was most proba-
bly reading them too, reading them in his voice of magniﬁcent
power and pathos to an awed multitude. In every church in the
landthose awful and beautiful words were being read, and yet
he knew that no help could come to him. “Depart from me ye
cursed,” burst forth the rector, with sudden sonorous energy, and
Everard shuddered and sent up an agonized prayer for Cyril.
The sun was hot, and he grew weary of his place by the win-
dow, and sat down among the green graves beneath a shady tree
till the congregation came out. Then he rose, when they were all
gone, and knocked at the ﬁrst cottage door he reached, having
learnt by this time that the poor are better almoners of hand-to-
hand charity than the rich, because they know better what it is to
go without a meal. Some bread was put in his hands, with words
he was too dazed to bear; but he found, on trying to eat the bread,
that he could not swallow it.
All that day he lay in a ﬁeld, and at evening rose with difﬁculty,
and asked for a night’s shelter; for the dews were chilly, and he
knew that he was now too ill to bear exposure. It was refused.
He wandered a little further on, and sank on the bare earth in a
sort of stupor, from which he was roused by the chilly dawning of
the next day. He was on a bank beneath a large lime tree, by the
side of a brook, which sang'in quiet undertones, like the brook in

the wood where he dined so happily when ﬁrst at liberty. He
could not move.
At ﬁrst it seemed terrible to face death thus, outcast and alone,
and all the scenes of his life ﬂashed past him, and the strange an-
guish which falls on us at the thought of dying in the midst of sor~
row, before any hope has been fulﬁlled, seized upon him with vult-
ure beak.
Did his mother hear him with bitter pains for this, to die in his
prime of want and hardship? All the high hopes and rich promise
of his youth smote upon him with keen anguish, and Cyril’s one
message to him in prison, “ He shall make thy righteousness clear
as the light, and thine innocence as the noonday," shot across his
brain in letters of ﬁre.
Some feeling of family pride revived within him, and he thought
how much harder it was for an Everard to perish by the way than
for one born by the wayside and nurtured in want. He thought of
Leslie. Did he lie alone thus face to face with death, when he got
the wound which in the end proved fatal? How diﬁerent that dy-
ing on the ﬁeld of honor must have been! And yet, how small,
how phantom-like everything earthly seemed in that hour of tre-
mendous reality 1 Did not one event happen to all.
The green ﬁelds, dewy bright in the rising sun, reeled before
him, and be summoned his failing forces and applied them to prayer
for all who had been dear to him.
He was now no more alone; the sweet and awful consciousness
of a Divine Presence came upon his calmed soul. Lilian’s beautiful
voice seemed to speak passages full of mighty hope from the Script-
ures; he heard the brook’s low murmur and the light whisper of
the leaves above his head. He seemed to be resting on some kind
arm, which was now Lilian’s, now an angel’s, and the rose-ﬂushed
morning sky at which he gazed opened and disclosed indistinct forms
moving in light. He saw his mother’s face, Leslie‘s, the baby Mait-
lands, so long dead; majestic presences, spiritual beings, souls of
the noble dead hovered near in august silence, through which a
mighty music of unutterable'joy swept in melodious thunders.
The vision vanished in a keen chill, and he woke to ﬁnd rain
pattering on his upturned face. The fresh shower renewed his
sinking energies, and cleared his brain; some animal instinct told
him day was declining. He knew that the bitterness of death was
past. It was sweet to feel the soft rushing of the cool rain on his

race; it seemed a pleasant thing to die thus, to cease from painful
being, and mingle with the kindly elements and dissolve into the
gracious components of the great universe.
The brook sang on, and the leaves rustled lovingly together, and
a little wren suddenly let its strong heart of song loose upon the air;
such a volume of melody from such a tiny breast! He remembered
what Cyril said one day of the wren‘s song—“ If the mere joy of ani-
mal existence evokes such a passion of rapture, what must be the
fullness of bliss called forth by the consciousness of pure spiritual
life, unfettered and unclogged by sin or sense? ”
It did not seem strange that Cyril was sitting there by his side,
discoursing in the old bright way, with the old familiar kindliness
and something more than the old radiance of youth in the blue
eyes, whose light was blended confusingly with that of the broad
heaven above, whence the clouds were rapidly sweeping. Cyril
spoke of the broken Sévres vase, laughing at the childish terrors of
that by-gone transgression. “You got the blame, 01d fellow, and
the punishment, but I got the suffering," he said. “ Yes,“ he
added, in the thoughtfulness that was wont to descend upon the
twins in their lightest moments; “ the sorrow of sorrows is sin.”
Then'Cyril seemed to fade, and only Lilian remained, unseen,
supporting him till he lost all consciousness.
“It is a case of want and exposure,” said the doctor, bending
over the lifeless form beneath the tree, and applying brandy to the
closed lips. “Stand back, if you please. I wonder that you pic-
nickers let the man lie alone here all these hours! ”
“ We thought he was drunk,” replied a young man, with an air
of compunction. “ We passed him at noon, and did not pass again
till ﬁve, when he seemed to be asleep. Tramps so often sleep half
the day.”
“ And Smith saw him at nine, and he was begging in the village
yesterday, and must have lain here all last night, and it is eight
o’clock now. What do you think of that, inspector? ”
“I think,” replied the police inspector, who had chanced to be
driving by in his dog-cart, with a couple of stout constables, just
after the village doctor’s arrival, “that this is the very chap we’ve
been wanting this three weeks. There will be a gunshot-wound in
the leg. A gentleman of your profession, doctor, if this is my man.
Not dead, is be? What, more brandy? and not a sign of life yet.”

“Nothing in the pockets but this,”said a constable, showing the
empty comﬁt-box, the handkerchief marked “M. L. 11.," and the
piece of bread given on the Sunday. “ Ah! and his name is Stone,
and he’s been after letters at Hawkburne this three weeks, has he,
sir? And begged at the Rectory, did he? ”
“ We had our eye on that post-ofﬁce, but never chanced to light
on the man,” added the inspector. “Quick with those blankets,
there! Here, doctor, isn’t this a gunshot-wound? He‘ll be all
right at the station-house. He can go in a cart,l suppose? Our
own surgeon will look to him there. If you don’t mind the trouble
of going with him, doctor, nobody will hinder you. Do you think
he’ll die on the way? ”
A week or two later, there was a cheerful family group in Can-
on Maitland‘s drawing-room, the windows of which stood wide to
a little lawn sloping down to a stream, beyond which lay the little
country town, half veiled in light smoke-mist. His twin sister was
there, with children playing on her knees, and his pretty wife sat at
a tea-table and talked to him on various homely themes.
“ And why do you think, Marion," asked Lilian, after a thought-
ful pause, during which she had not been listening to them, “that
the man who held your pony at Burnham was the escaped convict? ”
“Lilian,” interposed the canon, quickly, “how often have I
begged you to spare me these topics? You know I can not hear
that word without pain.”
“ Perhaps,” said Lilian, “I should hear the word with less pain
myself, if I did not know that Henry was at Portsmouth.”
Oyril’s face blanched, and he was about to reply, when the door
burst open, and Keppel Everard rushed in.
“By George, Marion! ” he cried, “that runaway convict whose
adventures we were reading yesterday, turns out to be that poor
devil Henry! ”
“I knew it! " cried Marion, passionately. “ Oh, Lilian, I might
have saved him, and I did not! He was so like him, but so worn
and old. Oh, Lilian, his eyes when he looked at the children! And
Amy saw the likeness to Leslie. How little she guessed! ”
“How do you know this, Keppel ? ” asked Cyril, in his deepest
tones, while Marion sobbed convulsively, and Lilian, marble pale,
clasped the child which was leaning upon her more tightly, and
listened.

v . “ The governor of the prison told my father. Henry was at
death’s door from exhaustion and hardship. He wanted instruc-
tions about burying him, but the poor fellow got better, unluckin
—for all parties.”
“ For heaven’s sake, calm yourself, Marion!” said Cyril, who
was himself trembling exceedingly. “ The children are frightened.
By the way, Lilian, I never gave you the letter Lennie brought
this morning. It got mislaid somehow among Winnie’s, and ought
to have been delivered weeks ago.”
Lilian took the letter with an abstracted air, and was about to
put it in her pocket, when the postmark, Hawkburne, caught her
eye, and a closer examination showed her that the handwriting,
distorted and irregular as a wounded hand had made it, yet faintly
resembled Henry’s. She tore it open, read it, and fainted for the
ﬁrst and last time in her life.

PART III.
“I charge thee, ﬂing away ambition:
By that sin fell the angels; how can man then,
The image of his Maker, hope to win by ’t'!
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee."
CHAPTER I.
ONE bright summer morning, in the year 1881, a man was travel-
ing through the heart of Devonshire to Exetcr in a ﬁrst-class car-
riage, the only other occupant of which was a comfortable-looking
clergyman, who was evidently able to digest the Thirty-nine Arti-
cles and a good daily dinner with equal facility, and whose parish,
no doubt, showed a happy sterility of evil-livers and dissenters, with
an equally happy fertility of tithes. This clergyman’s kindly, fresh-
. complexioned face assumed an expression of singular concern and
perplexity whenever he looked, as he did furtively from time to time
under cover of his newspaper, at his fellow-traveler. The latter
was a gaunt, haggard man, with a worn and wasted face, which was
partially covered by a beard, the even and sharply cut ends of which
showed that it had only recently been allowed to grow, and was
lighted by dark, deeply sunken eyes of a kindly but singularly wist-
ful expression; the heard as well as the hair was grizzled.
The man looked about ﬁfty or ﬁve and ﬁfty; his shoulders were
bent, and he walked with a stiff and labored gait. His manner was
shy and uneasy ; he wore gloves, which he never removed; and his
dress consisted of a badly made and ill-ﬁtting suit of gray. The
clergyman recognized this suit of gray as that which is supplied to
discharged prisoners and soldiers.
It was scarcely possible to recognize, in this bowed and broken
man in the ill-ﬁtting gray suit, the handsome, light-hearted young
c-‘s-Am
had

fellow who traveled down to Oldport with another clergyman only
eighteen years before, full of health and hope and intellect, and talk-
ing gaily of all things in heaven and earth. And yet, if you looked
carefully at him, there was the same direct and clear gaze in the
candid brown eyes, the same sweetness about the lips, the same
look of moral strength in the whole face.
But there was no longer the air of intellectual power or the con-
ﬁdent calm of a man whose fate is in his own hands, and who means
to mold it to noble purposes. Eighteen years of intense suﬁering,
heroically endured, had marked the face with an unspeakable no-
bility and gentleness—an expression which deeply impressed and
mystiﬁed the clergyman opposite him, who knew perfectly that the
owner of this sublime face must have left Dartmoor but an hour or
two before.
Yes, Everard was free at last. The day for which he had sighed
through all that furnace of long years had actually dawned. He
might come and go beneath the broad heaven above England as he
listed. The fever of this thought had kept him awake through the
long hours of the last night in prison; and yet, when he turned his
back on the grim buildings of Dartmoor, he could scarcely see them
for tears.
He left friends behind those stern walls—friends who would feel
his departure as an irreparable loss, friends for whom his heart bled.
In the wide world into which he was thrust alone, after a lifetime
spent in unlearning its ways, he had but one friend; one who had
seen him last in the ﬂower of youth and intellect, and who, in spite
of her long-tried and unswerving devotion, might shrink from the
wreck he now was, ruined in health, shattered in nerves, and with
blasted prospects.
These thoughts made him turn a. wistful gaze upon the purple
slopes of Dartmoor whenever a turn of the line brought it into sight.
The rapture he had felt in freedom on his temporary escape, nine
years before, could never more throb so strongly within him. Those
later years had wrought more cruel effect upon him; the privations
of that brief spell of freedom—which, nevertheless, was in his mem-
ory like the very breath of heaven—and the illness which followed
them, had more surely sapped his strength. His captivity had
been more rigorous after that; he had worn irons. The routine
had now more effectually numbed his faculties, so that at last it
had grown to be a necessity; and now that he found himself thrown

on his own resources, and dependent on no will but his own, he was
like a lost child, half frightened and bewildered by the pettiest re-
sponsibilities of life.
He dared not encourage the good clergyman’s kindly attempts
at general conversation, and the paper he lent him was as if written
in an unknown tongue. Who could understand the Times of to-day,
if the events of the last twenty years were a blank to him? Empires
had disappeared from Europe since Everard's incarceration; fresh-
empires had risen; English society and English public opinion had
undergone a total change; English politics had been radically al-
tered; more than one revolution had been accomplished; old land-
marks were swept away; the world had made mighty strides on-
ward, for better or for worse; and of all this he knew nothing.
At Exeter he felt more at ease. Leaving the station on foot,
he went into the streets of the ancient city, not heedi'ng the cries
of cabmen and hotel touts, not dreaming that he could be addressed
as “ Sir,” who had so long been only N o. 62, and pleasantly excited
to ﬁnd himself moving unhinderedamong crowds of free fellow-
creatures. The cathedral bells were pealing merrily for some festi-
val; soldiers were marching with bright music through the streets,
which were thronged with women and children in light summer
dresses. How beautiful they all looked, after the ghastly ﬁgures of
the convicts in their hideous garb of uniform shame! and how de-
licious was the free air and sense of motion at will!
He entered the ﬁrst tailor’s shop, and got a suit of ready-made
clothes, which he put on there and then, not nnmindful of a curious
smile on the shopman’s features at sight of the gray suit. Here
also he purchased a suitable outﬁt for a few weeks; then he got a
portmanteau, and, feeling a diﬁ‘erent being in a dark and well-made
suit, he got himself some boots at a fashionable bootmaker’s; and
then went to some dining-rooms and ate his ﬁrst free meal with
rising spirits, and was no longer startled when the waiter addressed
him respectfully, and waited on his behests with “Yes, sir ” and
“ N 0, sir."
When he returned to the station and took his seat in a third-
class carriage to London, he looked what he was, a gentleman,
save for his hands, which he kept carefully gloved. He had many
traveling companions now, having chosen to go ﬁrst-class in the
gray suit in the hope of being alone and unnoticed, and to the con—
versation of these he listened with a kind of awe; for none of

them were criminals—all were free, and they spoke of things and
moved in a life of which he had been long ignorant.
He had purchased some periodicals with a strange joy in the
novelty and freedom of the act, but he could not bring his attention
to bear upon them; his mind was too full. Ile could not even
listen to the con versation of his fellow-travelers, which had at ﬁrst
such a strange interest for him.
He gazed out upon the swift-rolling summer landscape, and re~
joiced in the roses which starred the passing gardens in June
luxury, and wondered if it were really he. His captivity was
turned, and he was indeed like unto them that dream. It was so
sweet, and yet so terribly sad. Not only were youth and strength
and hope gone, but the very world from which he had been so
suddenly turn was almost swept away. Leslie was dead, and
Marion and Mrs. Maitland and his father, the stout old admiral,
and they had never known that he was innocent. Did they know
now, lie wondered, and could they bear the thought of the other’s
guilt, or were all things earthly to them as if they had never been?
And of those who remained, how much of the old. selves he remem-
bered still lived? The long years had had no power to touch
Lilian‘s loyalty, but what had they done to herself?
The train rushed cluttering into a large station and stopped.
Some of his fellow-travelers got out, disinterring their buried
parcels and wraps with cheerful bustle. A young lady begged
his pardon for incommoding him—how strange the slight courtesy
seemed i—others wished him good morning, and he returned the
salutation with a dim feeling of transgression; he could not yet
realize that he might speak without leave.
A girl with a sad face offered roses at the windows, and bright-
ened when he bought some. He had touched no ﬂowers since he
gave those to Lilian on the fatal New Year’s Eve. Those were
virgin-white, which should have been red with blood; these were
warm crimson and gold.
It was dark night when they reached London. Everard scarce-
ly knew what to do in the tumult and din of a great metropolitan
station. At last he found himself and his brand new portmanteau
in a hansom, driving toward a hotel he mentioned, half afraid it
might have disappeared from the face of the earth.
At the time of his conviction the law which forfeited the prop-
erty of felons was still in force, so that he would have been penni-

less had not the admiral left him an equal share with his other chil~
dren at his death, which occurred some ﬁve years back. This little
property—which was, of course, in the hands of trustees—had
been accumulating during those years, and would now aﬁord him
a moderate income, which he still hoped to increase by the exercise
of his profession. He was to see the late admiral’s man of business
on the morrow, and when that was done he scarcely knew where
to turn.
He could not go to Lilian with the prison taint still upon him;
the thought of that was unendurable. She did not know the exact
date at which he was to be set at liberty, so he decided to spend
a week or two in getting accustomed to a free life, in ridding him-
self of some of his enormous ignorance of everyday affairs, and in
purging his memory of prison degradations. Then he had messages
to deliver to the friends of his fellow-prisoners, and set about that
at once. .
London oppressed him with its immensity and tumult and the
awful sense of loneliness which it produced; so after a few days he
went into the country, resolving to stop wherever fancy prompted.
During those few days he had looked into much new literature,
with an appalling sense of being left far behind his age. The medi~
cal and scientiﬁc journals gave him the keenest stab; science had
made such mighty strides without his aid, and the theory, the dar-
ling theory which was to effect a revolution in medical science, had
already been formed by another and accepted by the world.
Perhaps country air would restore his shattered nerves. There
is no nurse or healer like Nature; to her kind arms he would ﬂee
for refuge. But along that very line he had traveled down to
Melbourne with Cyril nearly twenty years ago, and the memory of
it tore his heart. “ An ascetic is a rake turned monk,” he had told
Cyril, little dreaming what a home-thrust he was giving. And
here was the massive cathedral, and here the towers of Belminster,
a place associated with scenes so agonizing. Yet he remembered
his jest to Cyril about the bishop.
He got out at Belminster, attracted by the strange fascination
which belongs to scenes of past suffering, and, leaving his things
at the station, strolled leisurely down the steep street, and looked
with inﬁnite compassion at the gaol in which he had endured such
agony. The place was not altered; people might have been stroll-
ing about just the same while his torture was going on.

THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND. 261
There was the lovely old Gothic cross, standing a solitary relic
of dead centuries, and wondering silently at the feverish present;
there were the old houses, jutting out upon pillars over the street
and hiding the dark shops; there, ﬁnally, was the hoary cathedral,
girdled about by its lofty trees and its green, quiet close, into which
he strolled with a feeling of sweet refreshment. His eyes rested
lovingly on the pleasant scene, so full of old-world associations, so
suggestive of all things soothing and sweet; a place in which one
must think of past things and of things eternal, and yet which is
linked so harmoniously with things passing and the little life of to-
dav.
He strolled into the gray, vast, echoing interior, and, sitting
down opposite the open door, lost himself in a pleasant dream. How
sweet it would be to live there under the great minster’s shadow,
within sound of the holy bell; to lead a gentle, holy, uneventful
life, pacing daily that rich green turf, looking on those great trees
and red-roofed houses, and on the pillared cloister yonder, and on
the light-springing arches of the Deanery, as one passed to and fro,
lowly, perhaps, but calm and happy! Something light ﬂuttered
between the slender black pillars of the Deanery entrance. It was
a young lady in a gay summer dress, who passed out and walked
along by the old cloister with an indescribable grace in the carriage
of her slim ﬁgure.
The sight of her youth and beauty called up pleasant visions of
sweet and tranquil home life—life rich with love and duty, and
adorned with culture and reﬁnement; and a little sigh escaped him
in spite of himself, when he thought of the possibilities of life, and
remembered what he had missed in his long agony. People began
to stream in slowly by twos and threes, and he observed that the
bells were chiming languidly; visitors with guide-books went out
or moved choirward; a dark, thin young clergyman, with a rapt
face and ascetic lips, ascended the choir-steps, and recalled the Cyril
of twenty years ago with strange vividness; the great organ began
to boom; the choristers paced slowly in, heavenly boy faces show-
ing above their white robes, or men with worn and rugged faces;
the bright silk hoods of the clergy gleamed as they passed; even-
song began.
Everard did not dream of entering the choir; the thought of
mingling with others on equal terms even in an act of worship was
as yet far from him. He felt himself a dweller on the outskirts of

humanity; it was as yet a great boon to be allowed merely to
look on without rebuke. So the solemn words and heavenly
music came echoing beneath the dim arches brokenly to his far-
oﬁ ears, and their peaceful spell drew him gradually nearer to the
choir.
At last the anthem began, and his soul melted within him he-
neath the passion of the full-voiced strain, and he stole silently up
the matted steps with bowed head, his consciousness merged in the
meaning which the mellow voices strove with conﬂicting endeavor
to make clear. The glorious tumult increased till it dissolved in a
triumph of harmony; and then above it, like a lonely sea-bird soar-
ing over a sea of stormy, foam-tipped billows, there rose a single
boy’s voice, so sweet and pure, so full of unconscious and unuttera-
ble pathos, that Everard trembled as he heard it, and stole on to
the very gates of the sanctuary to listen. Higher and higher the
solitary boy-voice rose, till it seemed as if it must be ﬁnally lost in
some clear heaven of ineﬁ'able sweetness; there it hovered and
paused, and then descended, rising and falling again upon the pin-
ions of strong melody, till it fell at length half wearied into the sea
of deep and mellow harmony.
The listener outside the sanctuary gate gazed in in a tumult of
unspeakable feeling, not knowing what memories and hopes and
longings the beautiful boy‘s voice awakened within him, but vaguely
conscious that he had stood thus before in some far-oﬁ forgotten
time, seeing all his lost youth ﬂash by him, and realizing the spell
of Lilian’s long-missed presence once more.
The anthem died away, and Everard came to himself, and
thought how unﬁtted he was for life with a nervous system so sen-
sitive, so liable to escape control, and he remembered the scorn
which once mingled with his pity for such weaklings. He scorned
no man now.
The chorister with the beautiful voice had a face of equal charm
—a face from which Everard could scarcely avert his eyes. The
other boys looked roguish enough, though they were very well be-
haved—pattern choristers, indeed ; but this lad’s face and demeanor
had a singular pathos; and his eyes, instead of being bent. as the
others were, on the desk, had a forward or upward gaze during his
singing. He evidently knew all his music by heart. ,
When the service was over, and the worshipers had left the
building, Everard strolled down the nave, looking at different monu-

ments, and spoke to the verger, whose oﬁer to guide him he had
refused.
“I know the cathedral well,” he said, “ but I have not seen it
for many years.”
“ You may have traveled and seen a sight of cathedrals since,
but you won‘t see many to beat Belminster,” said the verger,
proudly.
“Not many; and it is in better order than in former times.
And what a very well-behaved choir] I suppose your dean is a
good man.”
“ Yes, sir; the dean is very particular about the cathedral. He
takes an interest in every creature about it, too. We all have to
mind our p‘s and q's, I assure you, and we’d do anything for him.
He‘s that taking in his ways, to be sure.”
“And who is your (lean? ” Asked Everard, indifferently, as he
was turning away.
“ Bless my soul alive! ” exclaimed the verger; “ don’t you know
who the Dean of Belminster is? Excuse me, sir, but where have you
been not to have heard of Dean Maitland? ”
Everard was glad he had turned away, and he did not reply for
a moment.
“No doubt I appear very ignorant," he said at length, with a
little smile, “but I have not been near Belminster for this twenty
years.”
“ But not to know Dean Maitland! Why, all the world knows
the great dean. The books he has written, the things he’s done!
Nothing can be done without Dean Maitland. He’s the greatest
preacher in the Church of England. They’re going to make him
Bishop of Warham soon. Why, bless you, sir, when Dean Mait-
land preaches in Westminster Abbey, extra police have to be put
on, and people wait outside for hours. To think you never heard
of Dean Maitlandl” and the verger looked up and down Ever-
ard, scanning him as if he were some strange natural phenome-
non.
“The greatest preacher?” repeated Everard, his heart throb-
bing painfully. “ What is his Christian name? ”
“ The greatest, and the bishop, Bishop Oliver, the Bishop of
Belminster, is the next, and some think he runs the dean close,”
replied the verger, with satisfaction; “ Christian name, Cyril. You
should hear him preach, sir, you should indeed. People come down

to Belminster on purpose. He‘ preaches to-morrow in the nave. A
series of evening lectures to working-men, and the dean takes his
turn to-morrow.”
“I will come,” said Everard; and he moved away, and stood
gazing abstractedly at the ancient font, consumed with the strangest
excitement.
“It is very old, sir," said a sweet voice behind him; and, turn-
ing, he found himself face to face with the chorister who sang the
solo.
He was a slight, delicate lad, some ten years of age, with dark
hair waved over his pure white brow, and beautiful blue eyes gaz-
ing with a strange pathos from the well-featured face; and the sin-
gular beauty of his voice was enhanced by the purity of his accent,
which was that of a gentleman.
“Old indeed,” returned Everard. “Old Oliver couldn’t batter
that; it is too solid.”
“ You know, of course, that he smashed the west window,” said
the lad, pointing to the great window, with its singular pattern,
formed by piecing the broken fragments of richly colored glass
together.
Everard replied in the aﬁirmative, and moved on, the boy ac-
companying him, and discussing the different objects of interest
with singular intelligence.
“'You do not tire of the cathedral, though you sing in it daily? ”
asked Everard.
“No, I never tire of it,” he replied, gazing dreamily round;
“it is such a beautiful place. I love the vastness of it. I spend
hours here; it is my home.”
He had insensiny stolen his small hand into Everard’s, who was
thrilled deeply by the warm, soft grasp, and he now led him on to
show him an ancient tomb.
“ Have you been a chorister long? ” Everard asked.
“Only since we came to Belminster, three years ago; then I
was the smallest boy in the choir.” He did not go to school, he
said, in reply to a query; he had a tutor. “My name is Mait-
land," he added; “Everard Maitland.”
Everard’s hand tightened convulsiver over the child’s slight
ﬁngers, and he gazed searchingly in his face, which betrayed no
surprise at the intent gaze.
“ Ah! the dean’s son,” he said, after a long pause.


## p. 265 (#271) ############################################

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 265
“Yes,” he replied, with a proud little air; “the dean’s son.
Do you know my father? Have you heard him preach? ”
“Not of late.”
“He is a very good father,” said the boy; “ and I am his only
son. People think him great, but he is better than great; he is
good. We have no mother. What time is it?” he added, as
Everard drew out his watch to conceal the tumult that was stirring
within him.
Everard silently turned the dial toward him for answer.
“I can hear it tick,” said the child, regretfully; “but I can not
see it.”
“Not see it 1 ” exclaimed Everard, in surprise.
“No, sir; I am blind. You are surprised?” he added, after a
pause; “people always are. I was born blind, and I have been
trained to be as independent as possible. I show it more in a
strange place. I know every inch of the cathedral, I love it so.”
“ Blind! ” echoed Everard, at last; “ and you are his only son ? ”
“His only son. It is a terrible grief to him. It is little to me;
my life is very happy, and my father is so very kind. And they
let me sing in the choir and play the organ. Few boys have such
pleasures as I.”
“You hear your afﬂiction manfully,” said Everard, laying his
hand tenderly on the child’s head and gazing thoughtfully on him
for a space. “But how can you enjoy the cathedral if you can not
see its beauty?”
“I can feel it. I have heard its diﬁerent parts so often de-
scribed, and I know its history so well. Then I can hear by the
echoes how vast it is, and how lofty, and the way in which the
music rolls about it describes its shape. I could feel you standing
at the font just now, and I know when you are looking at me. I
knew that you were a good man the moment you spoke. Your
voice is familiar to me. You see, we blind people have other
senses to make up, sir.”
The child smiled as he said this, a smile that touched Everard
to his heart’s core. Cyril and Lilian smiled thus, but the child’s
smile had a sweetness beyond theirs, one which is only born of
suffering.
They had now reached the open door, through which entered
the reﬂected warmth of the sunshine, which the blind boy said he
could feel, and here they parted.

266 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND.
“Good-by, sir,” said the boy, pressing his hand, and directing
upon him the strange unaware gaze of the blind. “ We have had
a charming talk,” he added, in Cyril’s own fascinating manner.
“ Good-by, dear little fellow, and God bless you,“ replied
Everard, returning the pressure of the delicate hand. “Stay,”
he added, as the child stepped out into the sunshine. “ Had you
not a. brother named Ernest?”
“Oh yes,” he answered; “they say he was such a strong,
healthy boy. He died when I was a baby. My poor father has
lost many sons and daughters, and I can never be any thing but a
care to him. He has only my sister to comfort him. Good-by,
sir; I shall be late ; ” and, taking off his hat once more, he sprang-
down the steps and across the pavement, to an iron railing which
here fenced the turf. Everard watched him as he vaulted it easily,
and dashed, as seeing boys dash, headlong across the green, making
a slight turn to avoid a collision with a solemn clergyman, who lifted
his hat to him, and then ﬂying straight under the slender arches of
the Deanery entrance, where he vanished from sight.
“Poor young gentleman! ” said the verger, who was standing
behind Everard, chinking a shilling the child had given him. “ N oth-
ing pleases him so much as showing the cathedral to strangers, and
keeping his blindness from them. Many and many a one he’s took
in. But he always gives a verger a shilling after taking a party
round; he wouldn’t take a man‘s bread out of his mouth. It‘s a
sore trial to the dean, sir, you may depend upon it. It was trouble
to his mother caused it, they say. Just before he was born she
went through a deal in her mind, and was never the same again.
And that aﬂ‘ected the boy’s nerves, specially the optic nerves and
he was born blind. Pity, isn’t it? We shall miss Master Everard
when the dean is Bishop of Warham.”
“ No doubt,” said Everard, moving abstractedly away, his eyes
riveted on the Deanery; “no doubt.”
Lilian had gradually ceased to mention Cyril in her letters;
indeed, since Marion’s death she had not mentioned him at all, and
Everard had never during the whole of his imprisonment named the
name of the man he had so loved, and for whom he had suffered so
cruelly. And now he found him the great Dean Maitland, too great
to be merely the Dean of Belminster; he belonged apparently to
the higher order of deans, like Dean Swift and Dean Stanley, and
W118, moreQVer, Bishop-elect of Warham. And Warham was the

THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND. 267
greatest see in England; its bishops had ranked as princes in olden
days. There was but one greater dignity in the Church—that of
archbishop. Everard paused opposite the Deanery, and looked long
upon it, while a singular conﬂict of feelings raged within him.
On this very spot, eighteen years ago, Cyril himself had stood,
an obscure curate, while Everard was undergoing his terrible ordeal
before the judge, and had reﬂected, in spite of the tumult within
him, upon the advantages of being a dean.
He had looked with keen outward observation, as Everard was
looking now, on the majestic pile of the gray cathedral, rising above
the sedate red roofs and gables of the quiet and digniﬁed close; on
the same elms and limes, leaﬂess then in the March sunshine, and
had heard the rooks cawing in their lofty circles overhead, with the
same suggestions of boyhood and home and the breezy downs about
Melbourne; there he had stood, though Everard did not know it,
and fought an inward battle in which his soul’s best powers were
overthrown.
Some such battle raged within Everard now. He thought of
his long agony, and the crimes which caused it; he thought of his
heart’s best friendship, and the treachery which betrayed it; he
repeated to himself with various intonations of scorn and indigna~
tion, “Dean Maitland, Bishop of Warham; ” he thought of the guile-
less child with his angel voice and his life-long aﬁliction; he thought
of his own broken health and ruined life; he thought of Lilian
wasting her youth in loneliness, and asked himself how he could
forgive the traitor for whose crime he had suffered—the traitor who
dressed in ﬁne linen and dwelt in palaces among the greatest in the
land, while the betrayed wore his heart out in a prison, clothed in
the garb of shame, and herded with the scum and off-scouring of
vice. He could not hear these distracting thoughts; he turned with
a gesture of ﬁerce indignation, and, striding hurriedly along the
close, passed beneath the Gothic gateway, in whose angle was
niched a tiny church, passed along, amid a crowd of happy school-
boys, in front of the college, and did not breathe freely till he found
himself once more in the bustling High Street.

CHAPTER II.
an. Deanery drawing-room looked out upon a soft stretch of
lawn, partly shaded by some magniﬁcent trees, and bounded by a
delicious old garden with warm red walls, on which fruit was ripen-
ing in the July sun. The mullioned easements, with their diamond
panes. stood open to let in the sunny air laden with the scent of
carnations, roses, and mignonette. All that reﬁned taste, backed
by a long purse, could do toward making a room beautiful and sug-
gestive of art and culture, as well as perfectly comfortable, had
been done to this room, which, as everybody knew, had been ar-
ranged by the dean and his twin sister. Nor did the apartment
lack the crowning grace of a charming mistress; the dean’s only
daughter, a girl of ﬁfteen or sixteen, but apparently much older.
She sat, becomineg dressed in some light, fresh material, near
an open casement by a low table. on which a tea-service was placed,
and was talking in the liquid Maitland voice to several ladies and
three young and seemingly unmarried men, two of whom were
clergymen, while the third, the evident object of the black coats’
dislike, which he as evidently returned, had something about him
which proclaimed the dashing hussar. He answered to the name of
Lord Arthur.
“Benson,” said Miss Maitland, addressing a servant, “tell the
dean that I insist upon his coming in to tea. Say who are here.
It would serve him right, Lady Louisa,” she added, “ if I got you to
go and rout him out of his den.”
“My dear child, the mere suggestion terriﬁes me! ” returned
the lady. “Imagine the audacity of rushing in upon the dean,
when he might be making one of his lovely sermons or his clever
books! ”
“By the way,” interposed one of the curates, “what an appre-
ciative notice there is in this week’s Guardian of the dean’s ‘Epistle
to the Romans! ’ Did you see it, Miss Maitland i ”
“Oh, you don’t mean to say he is as clever as all that. to make
a new Epistle to the Romans! ” exclaimed a very young lady, whose
simplicity was greatly admired.
The door now opened, and the dean appeared among his guests,
making each feel that he or she was the special object of his welcom-
ing words and smiles. After this greeting, his glance ran anxiously

round the room and across the garden in search of something that
he missed. “ Where is Everard?” he then asked.
“Probably in the cathedral,” replied Marion. “ He has not re-
turned from even-song.”
“ You were not at even-song, Mr. Dean,” said a lady. “It is a
pity, for Everard excelled himself in the anthem.”
“ He did indeed,” chimed in the young curate with the rapt
face. “I never heard anything truer or sweeter than that high 0
of his.” . ,
“Poor dear child! his voice is a great consolation to him,”
sighed the dean, toying comfortably with his tea-spoon.
“I wonder if that voice will last?” asked Lord Arthur. “Of
course I mean, will it change into a good man’s voice? ”
“ Probably, with health and good management. So many good
boy-trebles are strained by overwork, and crack hopelessly at the
change,” replied the father.
“Now, Lady Louisa, begin your siege,” said the young hostess.
“If you- don’t do everything she asks you, papa, you will get no
more tea, remember.”
“ This is alarming,” smiled the dean. “Lady Louisa, I appeal to
your generosity not to exact too much from a helpless victim.”
“Pile on the agony, Aunt Louisa,” cried Lord Arthur. “ ‘Vse
victisl ’ remember."
“ Your nephew’s war-cry. The ruthless soldier ﬂings his sword
into the seals,” said the dean.
“Yes, and I’d ﬂing myself after it, if you would only come to
Dewhurst next week,” added the husssr. “ You’ve never seen the
old place, dean, and my father is dying to have you there, and so is
my mother.”
“And your aunt,” added Lady Louisa, laughing; “not to men-
tion yourself.” And she proffered her request, in the form of an
invitation from her sister-in-law to the dean and his daughter to
dine and sleep at the ancient, historic, ducal castle one day in the
following week.
“There, papa,” said Marion, with pretty imperiousness; “all
you have to do is to name the day.” '
“ Alas! ” sighed her father, “ next week is quite ﬁlled up.”
“ Oh, but you must come next week,” urged Lady Louisa. “ We
shall be alone then, and able to enjoy you. Indeed, the duchess
will never forgive you if you do not come.”

“To incur the duchess’s displeasure grieves me to the heart,”
replied the dean.
“Also mine,” added the lady, whom some people held to be
well disposed to wed the widowed ecclesxastic, she being about ﬁve
and thirty and of majestic presence, if not surprisingly well favored.
“That,” he returned, “would reduce me to absolute despair;
yet I am ﬁrm. I am tied to the stake.”
It was while the dean was being thus implored, coaxed, and
threatened, and while one or two people who would have been
ready to depart this life in peace after an invitation to the great
duke‘s show-place were listening with unspeakable envy, that a serv-
ant stole up to the dean and appeared anxious to attract his atten-
tion.
“ Well, Benson? ” he said at length, having disposed of the
question of the visit.
“A young gentleman, sir,” said the man, in a low tone—“re-
fuses to give his name; says it is private business of importance.”
“ Why did you not say I was engaged? ”
“I did, sir. He said his business was urgent.”
“Let him wait in the library.” ~
“I wonder how they make bishops, Mr. Dean?” asked Lady
Lousia, mischievously. “Do they send messengers post—haste to
offer miters upon their kneesjust when people are having tea com-
fortably? ”
The dean smiled a pleased smile, and observed that he had hither-
to had no experience of being made a bishop; and a lady present re- _
marked that a certain paper had mentioned his acceptance of the
see of Warham as a fact, and further ventured to ask if the journal
in question was right.
The dean smiled again. “A man who declines such an oﬂice
when duly chosen by the rightful authorities, incurs a tremendous
responsibility,” he said, with unusual gravity; and the rumor imme-
diately went forth that he had accepted.
He then withdrew with an apology. “Perhaps we had better
not keep the miter waiting too long, Lady Lousia,” he observed to
that lady with his peculiar smile, as he went out.
He reﬂected, as he left the room, that he might do worse than
marry Lady Louisa; also that Lord Arthur, who, though a younger
son, was rich enough to marry as he pleased, undoubtedly meant
business with regard to Marion. Lady Lousia was amiable, accom-

plished, not dowerless, pleasing, and of a suitable age. What could
a man want more? The Bishop of Warham and Lady Louisa Mait-
land sounded well. And yet the Bishpp of Warham, leading a life
of widowed loneliness because his conscience put the narrowest
meaning on the phrase “husband of one wife,” might have more
power .over men’s minds. But then, Dean Maitland belonged to
that class of men to whom single blessedness is a curse, and his six
years’ wifelessness had weighed sorely upon him, and he had but
two children, one hopelessly aﬂiieted.
Reaching his study, he rang the bell. “Where is Mr. Ober-
mann? ” he asked of the servant, meaning his son’s tutor.
'" Out, sir.”
“ And Miss Mackenzie? "—Marion’s governess and companion.
“ Out, sir. Her Girls’ Friendly Meeting day."
“Which that young rascal, Arthur, well knew,” thought the
dean. Then he ordered that a maid should search the cathedral
and close for the blind boy, keeping him in sight, but not accosting
him, unless he should break his bounds, which were the cathedral
precincts, so careful was the dean of his only son. “Show the
young man in here, Benson,” he said, in conclusion.
It never struck any visitor, much less this unsophisticated youth,
that the dean’s easy pose in his library chair by his writing-table,
which was so placed that the light from the lattice fell sideways
from behind him, leaving him in the complete shadow of the rather
dark wainscoted room, yet fully illuminating his books and papers
and the chair fronting him, in which he motioned his unknown
guest to take a seat, was a calculated one; but it certainly had un-
common advantages, since nota quiver of the penitent’s lip, not a
line of his face or a movement of his body, was lost, while the
priest’s countenance was but dimly seen in the shade.
Since the production of his popular devotional work, “ The
Secret Penitent,” Dean Maitland’s ghostly counsel had been sought
by men and women from far and near, chieﬂy from far, and chieﬂy,
though the gentle reader will probably doubt this assertion, by
men. These men were desirous of remaining unknown, and some-
times gave names which they said were assumed, sometimes none
at all.
Very strange tales had been told in that pleasant little study, in
the sight of that ﬁnely carved ebony and ivory cruciﬁx and those
beautiful proof engravings of celebrated religious pictures, holy

families, ascensions, conspicuously among them, a copy of the Geth-
semane which hung in the study at Melbourne. Cyril imagined
that the nameless youth was another of these penitents, and re-
ceived him with a certain tenderness in his stately manner, which
he knew was well calculated to unlock the sealed recesses ofthe
heart.
It was a tall, handsome, well-built youth, whose features and
expression kindled a vague disquiet in the dean’s breast, such an
irrational mental discomfort as imaginative people experience at
times, and instinctively fear to analyze.
He entered the room with a conﬁdent step and bearing, looking
boldly forward with an almost arrogant self-assertion in his gaze,
which was quickly subdued by the digniﬁed courtesy of Dean Mait~
land—a man with whom, despite his unvarying politeness, which
was almost courtliness, no man ever dare take a liberty. It seemed
as if the youth, entering with his bristles all on end, had expected
hostility or at least repression, and, receiving a suave cordiality
instead, was for the moment confounded. He felt himself envel-
oped in a blue radiance from the dean’s strangely beautiful and
powerful eyes, which searched him, measured him, explored him
to his remotest recesses, and reduced all his pretensions to nothing.
A man sitting at a table, with the implements of his daily occu-
pation before him, has a great advantage over one who sits unoc-
cupied in a chair in the full light, for the express purpose of talk-
ing. This the dean knew, and he never committed the error of
walking into aroom‘ to begin an interview with a person he in-
tended to inﬂuence, though no man knew better than he how to
walk into a room.
Sitting at ease in ‘his wooden chair, with the open lattice, pict-
uresquer tangled with invading roses and ivy, behind him; with
his melodious voice and reﬁned accent, new to his listener’s ears;
with his graceful limbs showing to advantage in his black dress
with shorts and gaiters; and with his well-formed hands in har-
mony with his severely cut features, which, however, were only
dimly seen, be cast a spell over his visitor; he suggested, further,
that harmonious blending of aristocratic piety, which is peculiar to
the English dean, and perhaps to the French abbé before the Revo-
lution, and which had so fascinated his own youthful gaze. He
made a picture in the oak \vainscoted room, with its latticed case-
ments, ecclesiastic adornments and suggestions of honored antiquity,

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 273
which quite overpowered the unaccustomed gaze of the younger
man, who never forgot it.
The dean’s practised eyc soon saw that his visitor was not a
gentleman, though near beingone. He was ill dressed in a light,
badly made suit, which hung loosely upon him, and yet became
him. A crimson scarf was fastened carelessly about his neck by a
ﬂashing pin, and that also well became his dark and handsome
features. His strong hands were brown and large, but well-formed.
He used his straw hat to emphasize what he said. He was full-
grown, but so young that his face was smooth, save for the slight
indication of a mustache. “ He is quite honest,” the dean thought.
“ I come from America,” he began abruptly, in a mellow and
powerful voice.
“You come from a country of which a man may be proud,”
replied the dean, in the tone which made men love him ; “and you
kindly honor me with“ a visit? ”
“In plain words, sir, what do I want? ” broke in the youth.
“1 want to be a gentleman.”
“ A most laudable ambition,” returned the other, smiling.
“ I want to go to Oxford or Cambridge. Cambridge I would
prefer, because you were there.”
He acknowledged this compliment with a slight bow.
“My father was a gentleman,” continued the lad, in his jerky
and headlong fashion; “ but my mother was not.”
“ A man’s mother,” returned the dean, in his plaintive voice,
“ is more usually a lady.”
“ Oh, you are laughing at me! But I am English-born, and was
brought up a British subject in the Dominion. My name,” be con-
tinued with some agitation, “is Benjamin Lee.”
He looked earnestly on the face in the shadowed corner, but he
did not see the sudden and quickly subdued quiver in the dean’s
lip. He was aware, however, that a change had taken place in his
face and demeanor.
“A very good name,” be returned, in the same dulcet tones;
“ A very usual English name.”
“I was born at Melbourne,” the young man went on, with an
increased sonorousness of voice and intensity of gaze. “My mother's
name was Alma Lee.”
“ Indeed. I remember your mother well. Is she living still ? “
“ She is, and I bring a letter from her. But that is not what 1

want to say. My mother was a deeply wronged woman, and she
never complained. The business, Dean Maitland, is just this: My
father has done nothing for me; all has fallen upon my mother.
b‘he has had me well educated for her means, and wanted me to go
into business. But I am ambitious; I wish to make a ﬁgure in the
world—4:0 be, as I said, a gentleman, for I feel the good blood in
my veins, and I am determined to have my right, and to claim from
my Iather what he is well able to give me—a university education
and a start in life.”
“ Indeed! ” said the dean, in an icy tone.
“And therefore,” proceeded the youth, springing to his feet the
more to emphasize his words, “I come to you, because 1 am your
son ./ ”
The word “son” he delivered as if dealing a blow, and he evi-
dently expected his heater to recoil beneath this tremendous asser-
tion ; but he was disappointed.
The dean’s ﬁne-cut features indeed grew pale in the dusk, and
there was a sudden deepening of tint in his eyes; his lips also met
with a stern compression. But of this the young man saw nothing,
and no other sign of emotion betrayed the tumult that raged so
madly within him at the sound of that deadly monosyllable.
“Calm yourself, my friend; pray be seated again,” he said, in
cool and silvery tones. “ Since when, may I ask, have you suffered
from this distressing delusion ? ”
It was now the younger man’s turn to be aghast. The coolness
with which this startling assertion was received utterly confounded
him, and he dropped, with a vacuous stare, into his seat, muttering
some queer Yankee objurgation.
“ Delusion] ” he ejaculated at length.
“ It is a very usual form of mental disease to imagine one’s self
the son of some eminent person,” observed the dean, in the indiffer-
ent tone of one uttering a mild platitude. “Are you at present
under medical treatment? ”
N o, sir,” returned the lad, regaining his mental poise; “ I am
as sound in mind and body as a man can possibly be; and “I know
myself to be your son, and I am here to claim my rights as such.”
“The facts of your birth are well known in Malbourne,” con-
tinued the dean, in the same indifferent tone. “ They are such as
reverence for parents——a virtue, I fear, not inculcated in your
adopted'country— should lead you to conceal, and, if possible, for-

get. I remember the circumstances fully. I baptized you myself—
that is, if you are the person you claim to be.”
" I am not surprised that you should disown me before the
world,” said the youth; “ and I own that it is impossible to speak
upon the subject without some irreverence unbecoming a son; but
I bid you ask your conscience, sir, whose fault it is that I can not
refer to my birth without imputing blame to my parents? I bid you
further ask your conscience how you are to answer at the bar of
Divine Justice, if you add to the' sin which brought me into the
world, a fatherless outcast, with the instincts of a higher rank war-
ring with the barren necessities of his life, the further sin of neg-
lecting the responsibilities you rashly incurred. Oh, I have no legal
rights—that I know well; but have I no natural rights—I who have
the blood of an ancient family in my veins, the instincts of a long
line of gentlemen? Have I no rights in the sight of Him whose
eternal laws were broken by the sin which gave rise to my being,
- and of which I was entirely innocent?”
It was a strange reversal of parts, the son admonishing the father,
the layman rebuking the priest, the supposed penitent accusing the
confessor; but the youth’s ﬁery words struck home, and the dean
, quivered visibly beneath them, and for the moment he could sum;
men no reply to his ashen lips.
“I am sorry to be obliged to distress you, sir," continued the
young man, with some compunction, “ but you will see on reﬂection
that I ask nothing unreasonable. I merely ask you to repair the
wrong of my birth—or rather to fulﬁll the obligations incumbent on
a parent. I have grown to manhood with no aid or recognition
from you. I am alone in the world; for my mother has a mortal
disease, and has come home only to die. I Only ask for this start
in life, which you must be well able to give; I ask no further recogl
nition. Believe me, sir, the time may come when you will be glad
to have some claim on the duty, if not the affection, of a son, and I
am not ungrateful.” '
The dean rose to his feet, quivering. “ Silencel ” he cried, in
deep tones of compelling intensity. “ I can not bear this,” he added,
in a voice of anguish, which escaped him against his will. “ This
is intolerable, to be insulted in one’s own house! Go, sir, and re-
member that in this country conduct so outrageous as yours is like-
ly to lead you to imprisonment in a. lunatic asylum.”
N ow that he was standing he seemed to ‘be gradually regaining

the mastery of himself, which for the moment he had lost. Young
Lee rose, but did not withdraw.
“I go,” he replied. “I have said enough for the present, but
you will hear of me again until I gain my will. In the mean time,
here is the letter my mother bid me deliver into your own hands,
and which needs an answer.”
The dean took the letter with an inward shudder at the sight of
it, and brought out some glasses, which he affected to wipe and ar-
range before reading it, though in reality he needed no glasses; he
only wanted to gain time and composure.
“By the way, Mr. Lee," he observed quietly, “your mother
married, I believe, some groom before leaving England. Is he liv-
ingi "
“She married Charles J udkins, who was a kind stepfather to
me. He died some years ago, leaving my mother and myself well
provided for.”
“Your mother, then, has no other children?”
“ None, sir.”
The dean had at last arranged the glasses and unfolded the let-
ter, giving one swift glance at his visitor, who had walked up to
one of the engravings, a sweet and guileless Madonna with a
thoughtful child, and was examining it with interest. Neverthe-
less, the dean shaded his face from the light as he read.
The room was very still, and pleasant sounds stole in through
the open lattice. A great bee was humming about the roses and
honeysuckle just outside; a blackbird woke up from his afternoon
drowse and began ﬂuting his liquid vespers; the cathedral clock
proclaimed the hour in deep booming notes, and all the bells in the
city echoed it with varying cadence; young voices came through
the sunny air of the garden, and the stranger saw a. party playing
at tennis below; a girl’s clear laugh rang out in true heart-music, '
and was followed by a man’s. It was Marion laughing at some ab-
surd mistake on the part of the love-blinded Lord Arthur, who
was ready to laugh with her. The dean meanwhile read on in si-
lence.
The young man grew impatient, and longed to soothe his soul by
a hearty whistle, to which his full red lips rounded themselves. He
got to the end of the engravings, and turned once more to the ﬁg-
ure at the table; but the dean was still reading, statue-like, with
his face accidentally shaded by his hand, though he never turned

a page of the brief letter of one sheet. The picture he made sitting
thus beneath the lattice, through which some long gold bars of sun-
shine were now stealing, remained upon the young man’s memory
for ever, though he did not hear the quick subdued breathing of
the reader, or see the chill drops upon his tortured brow.
Within a stone’s throw of that lattice one of the canons was
standing on a short ladder, tending a peach~tree on his garden wall,
thus seeking a pleasant distraction from the abstruse Hebrew stud-
ies in which he had been buried all the day. His wife stood in
the pathway by the sunny border, where the bees were humming
luxuriously over their luscious thieving, and looked on at his la-
bors.
“ I had it from the dean myself, Edmund,” she was saying, “this
very afternoon.”
“Well, my dear," he replied, rather indistinctly on account of
the strips of cloth he held in his mouth, “you will now have the
satisfaction of repeating it all over the close. Bishop of Warham,
eh? Maitland is a lucky fellow, and about as ignorant as that cat ”
--pointing to a ﬁne grimalkin, who was lazily watching his master.
“But scholarship goes for nothing in these radical days.”
“I am sure he will make a delightful bishop,” said the lady;
“ and who knows what old fogy we may get at the Deanery now?
Some old trump with his nose buried in a book all day, perhaps.”
“ When not perched on a ladder,” laughed the canon. “ Well,
who wouldn’t have the gift of the gab like Maitland? Lucky fel-
low, to be sure! ”
The letter which took so long to read ran as follows:
“ I am come home to die, and I wish to see you once more ﬁrst.
I promised never to betray you, and swore away an innoeent man-’s
character to shield you. and I have never had a happy hour since.
I can not undo all the wrong I have done for your sake, but I can
and must clear this man, who never did me harm. I can not die
in peace till I have righted him. Can I do it without hurting you?
Come to me for heaven’s sake; my days are numbered. My son
bears this. He knows his parentage, but nothing more. He is a
good lad. ALMA J unxms.”
At last the dean lifted his head and questioned the youth with
regard to his mother’s illness and present abode, and learned in

reply that she was suffering from some fatal internal malady, which
had become suddenly worse in consequence of a fall in the Belmin-
ster street, and that she had been admitted to the paying ward of
the local hospital, whence there was no probability of her issuing
alive.
“You take your mother’s extremity easily, young man,” said
the dean.
But the youth replied that he had been expecting the end for so
long that it no longer agitated him, yet his eyes ﬁlled with tears as
he spoke. The dean then took a pen and slowly indited a few sen-
tences, which he gave to the young man, who took the paper and
withdrew with a bow, which his host very frigidly returned.
~ No sooner had the door closed upon the young fellow‘s stalwart
form than Cyril dropped into his chair, and, burying his face in his
hands, groancd heavily, shuddering from head to feet. If he could
have dreamed this terrible moment twenty years ago, would that
handsome stripliug ever have seen the light? If any man could be
brought face to face with the embodied result of one sin, would he
ever sin more? Probably he would, else why has Eternal Wisdom
, reserved such knowledge for the most part to another world?
A light, swift step sounded along the corridor; the door opened,
and the blind boy came running in, with a joyous greeting on his
lips.
The dean lifted his head, and strove to calm himself as he wel-
comed the child in a gentle voice; but his heart was wrung by the
contrast between this lad and the ﬁne, healthy youth who had just
left him—wrung, too, by the thought that the latter’s look had
shown no gleam of affection; nothing but a challenging deﬁance.
“I made such a mistake, papa," said Everard; “I actually took
a stranger for you. Yet his voice was louder and his step stronger
than yours. Imet him in the hall now. Benson was letting him
out. Who was he? Benson says his face is rather like yours, so
perhaps I was not so very stupid.”
“ My poor Everard! " murmured the dean, folding the child
with unwonted tenderness in his arms; “ my blighted boy! ” v
“I am not poor,“ returned the child, brightly, while he laid his
round soft cheek on his father’s hollow face with a colt-like caress.
“Now, dada, I won’t be pitied. Benson said the fellow was like
you, so his eyes were little better than my cars. But who was he? ”
“ A stranger, an American. So you sang the solo, I hear? "

“ Yes; and it went so well. My voice was like a bird ﬂying up
to heaven’s gate. Father, it is nice to have such a voice; it goes as
if it couldn’t help it. And I showed such a nice fellow over the
cathedral, and took him in thoroughly.”
“Poor lad; poor dear lad! And what is going on now i "
“ Virgil with the Herr. And after dinner Marry has promised
to accompany our violins. And what do you think? The duke
has a Stradivarius, and Lord Arthur is to take me to Dewhurst to
hear it, and perhaps touch it. How hot and wet your forehead is!
Is your head bad? And I bothering? ”
The boy’s sightless gaze met his father’s glance of passionate
tenderness, all unconscious of the agony it looked upon; and the
dean turned away, for he could not bear it. Marion’s laugh came
ﬂoating in again with its masculine echo, and the child’s face bright-
ened.
“Marry and Arthur,” he said.
The dean pushed the dark hair from the boy’s brow, kissed and
blessed him, and dismissed him under the plea of a headache and
desire for quiet, watching him leave the room with a look of wist-
ful compassion. He loved his blind son better than anything on
earth, but he remembered how he had held the other lad in his
arms at the font, and how the infant’s touch had stirred the ﬁrst
keen thrill of fatherhood in his heart.
“ I dare not, oh, I dare not! It would be utter ruin! ” he
murmured to himself, in reply to some inward suggestion,
The young Canadian meantime left the Deanery, and, placing
his hat ﬁrmly on his head, turned to take one comprehensive look
at it before he went round by the cloisters and disappeared.
“J e-rusalem! " he exclaimed, “ if my sainted parent isn’t a ﬁrst-
rate actor and a cool hand! Now I know where I got my brains
from.”
The dean sat on, with his head buried in his hands, and his
heart torn, with the deadly missive before him, and utter ruin star-
ing him in the face, while the long gold bars of sunshine lengthened
and fell across him unheeded, and the pleasant chime-music told
quarter after quarter.
“Oh, my God! ” he groaned, “but one sin in a youth so spot-
less! And have I not repented? And are all these years of agony
nothing? And the work I have done and have still to do! And
the powers vouchsafed to me! Is there no mercy—none? "

An hour ago he had been so secure, so unsuspecting—the old
ghost laid for ever, he thought. And now? To go to that public
hospital, he, to whom no disguise was possible, whose very fame
would pursue him and point him out with a ﬁnger of ﬁre, to meet
the dying gaze of that hated woman, to hear her terrible reproach!
How could he? And that boy, with his strong self-will and his
ambition—Dean Maitland knew too well whence he got those quali-
ties—he would hunt him down without pity. Why not cut the knot
for ever? He had poison at hand.
The low mellow murmurs of a gong rose on his car (there were
no bells or any harsh sounds at the Deanery); he heard Marion‘s
voice calling to Everard, and the tap of her light foot as she ran
down-stairs, only just in time for dinner. He could not take his
life just then; he had to invent an excuse for not appearing at
dinner.
The perilous moment past, better thoughts came to him. He
leaned out of the window and breathed the cool dusk air. A
wakened bird twittered happily before taming again to its rest;
Everard’s pure voice ﬂoated out from an open window, with the
words of an anthem he was learning. The dean fell down before
the cruciﬁx, and tried to pray. He lay there in the darkness while
his children’s music sounded through the open windows, till the
moonlight stole in through the lattice upon him, and there was
silence in the house, save for the ticking of clocks and the deep
breathing of sleepers. Then he arose, haggard and exhausted, but
resolved to do his duty, whatever it might cost him.
Striking a light, he went to a. cabinet inlaid with delicate mosaic,
and touched a spring. A hidden compartment- was disclosed, whence
he took a bottle and a glass on which measures were engraved. Gare-
fully pouring out an exact quantity of dark brown liquid, he drank it
and replaced the spring.
The dean was a total abstainer; he knew the world too well to
hope for inﬂuence over the popular mind unless he bowed to the
idol of the hour, and frequently observed to friends that he ab-
stained from wine -“for the sake of example.” For the same rea-
son, probably, nobody knew anything about the little bottle of dark
liquid.

CHAPTER III.
WHEN Everard reached the High Street, his attention was
caught by an announcement in a bookseller’s window, “Dean Mait-
land’s new work,” and, on going up to the shop, he saw the vol-
umes fresh from the publisher’s, in their plain brown binding. It
was the third volume of the dean’s “Commentary on the Pauline
Epistles.” There also he saw, in every variety of binding suited to
luxurious devotion, his other works: his “Secret Penitent,” his
“Knight‘s Expiation, and other Poems,” his "Lyra Sacra,” his
“Individual Sanctity,” his “Verses for the Suffering,” “Parish
Sermons,” “Sermons preached in Westminster Abbey,” together
with endless tracts and pamphlets. Everard purchased the “Se-
cret Penitent” and the “Expiation,” after turning over the leaves
of the sermons, wondering at their commonplace character, and
listening to a long eulogy on the author from the bookseller. Then
he walked up the hill to the station, dipping into his new purchases
as he went.
Having claimed his modest possessions, he had them conveyed
to the George Inn, where he dined in a ﬁrst-ﬂoor room with a bow-
window looking out on the sunny, bustling High Street; and while
he dined he turned over the leaves of the dean’s book, recognizing
Cyril’s style and certain peculiar turns of thought and traits of
character as he read, and feeling more and more that neither the
poems nor the devotions were the work of a conscious hypocrite.
From an artistic point of view, they were not calculated to take the
world by storm; but there was an unmistakable ring of reality
throughout, which entitled them to respect, and accounted for the
inﬂuence Dean Maitland was said to exercise over men’s minds.
The “Secret Penitent” had passed through many editions. It
must have comforted the souls of thousands of human beings; it
could only have been written by a man of deep religious convic-
tions and high-toned morality.
Everard sat in the bow~window, listening to the hum of the
streets and the cadences of the bells, and pondering with a bewil—
dered mind over this enigma of human character; and again he
wondered, as he had so often wondered during the earlier days of
miserable brooding in his captivity, how it was possible that such
a man could have sinned so heavily? He recalled his sensitive

reﬁnement, his excessive exaltation of the spiritual above the ani-
mal, his scorn for the facile follies of youth, his piety, the purity of
his emotions, his almost womanly tenderness, and marveled with a
bewildered amazement. lle had himself not becn unacquainted
with the ﬁres of temptation, but his life had been unscathed, nev-
ertheless, because he had been strong enough to resist. But that
such ﬁres should have power over Cyril seemed incredible, especially
when he remembered his austere, almost ascetic life. .
Equally strange did it appear to Cyril himself, as he lay pros-
trate before the cruciﬁx, face to face with his sin, and wondering if
indeed he were the same man as he who went astray twenty years
ago.
Yet the ﬁrst sin was simple enough, giving the components of
Cyril’s character and Alma’s, the strange and inexplicable entangle-
ment of the animal and the spiritual in human nature, and the blind
madness in which passion, once kindled, involves the whole being.
Alma was then innocent of heart; but what is innocence before
the ﬁerce ﬂame of temptation, unless guarded by high principle and
severe self-mastery? Cyril could not live without adoration, and,
when Marion turned from him, he caught at that unconsciously
offered him elsewhere, telling himself that there could be no harm
to such as be, above temptation as he was, in watching the impas-
sioned-light of Alma’s beautiful eyes, and that pity required him to
pour some kindness into so stricken and guileless a heart.
So in those idle days of the Shotover curacy he trod the prim-
rose path of dalliance with a careless and unguarded heart, and did
not waken to a sense of danger until he found himself and another
precipitated downward into the very gulfs of hell. The shock of the
fall sobered him, and suddenly quenched the delirium of the senses
which had hitherto blinded him, and left a mingled loathing and
contempt in its place; and the abasement of his own fall, and the
terrible sense of having wrought the ruin of another, stirred the yet
unwakened depths of his nature, and kindled the ﬁrst faint begin-
nings of deeper moral and spiritual life. Had he but possessed the
courage and strength of will to accept the consequences, to confess
where confession was due, and to atone as far as atonement was
possible, both he and the more innocent partner of his guilt might
have recovered moral health, and even happiness, and he might
have led the noblest if not perhaps the happiest of lives, deriving
strength from his very weakness.

For his life had till then been untempted, and all his impulses
had been good and beautiful. But he was a coward, and loved the
praise of men. And more than all things and persons he loved
Cyril Maitland. He was also a self-doceiver; he drugged his con-
science, and was dragged into the tortuous windings of his own
inward deceit; and thus he fell from depth to depth, like Lucifer,
falling all the deeper because of the height from which he fell, until
he ﬁnished in the perversion of his moral being with the deed of a
Judas. Of that last iniquity he never dared think.
Everard read and pondered, and pondered and read, and was
ﬁlled with awe and pity. Then, laying the books aside with a sense
of joy in his newly gained freedom, he took his hat and sauntered
along the dusk, yet unlighted streets, letting his fancy dwell on
brighter themes.
He had not gone far before he met a man who looked curiously
at him, turned alter he had passed, and again studied him intently,
and ﬁnally, retracing his steps, accosted him.
“ it is Dr. Everard, surely ? ” he said.
“That is my name,” replied Everard, a little startled at the un- ~
familiar sound of the long unspoken name. “ But I have not the
pleasure of knowing yours,” he added, scanning the ﬁgure and face
of the respectable tradesman. .
“ Think of Dartmoor and No. 56,” replied the tradesman, in a
low tone.
A light of recognition broke over Everard’s face, and he clasped
the offered hand with a cordial greeting.
“ It is no wonder that you did not recognize me," the man said;
~‘f thanks to you, I make rather a different ﬁgure to what I did on
the moor. But yours is a face not to be forgotten."
“ You are doing well. apparently, Smithson."
“I have a linen-drapers shop, and I married a good girl, and we
have two little ones, and we pay our way,” he replied. “If you
are going my way—I was just strolling up the hill for a breath
of air—I will tell you all about it. You know, doctor, I could
never have had the courage to face the world again but for you.
Your words were always in my ears, ‘ The only atonement we can
make is to accept the consequences maufully and conquer them.’
It was uphill work, and I was often ready to throw up the sponge;
but I stuck to it, and got through. Everybody knows my story,
but they have mostly forgotten it. Many a time when I was ready

to give up, and take to lying ways and hiding and going to the deuce
again, I remembered how you, an honorable gentleman, who never
did wrong, trusted and respected me in spite of all, and I thought,
‘If he can respect me, others will,’ and I held on. You remember
the Putney Slogger? ”
“ Poor Slogger! he had a good heart, Jim.”
“He goes straight now, and says it was you that heartened him
to it. Has a green-grocer’s cart, and deals fair."
Smithson had been a clerk in a mercantile ofﬁce, and, falling
into dissipated ways and consequent debt, helped himself to petty
sums, which gradually grew larger, until the usual end of such a
course was reached—an appearance in the prisoner’s dock, and a
sentence of penal servitude. He was barely twenty when Everard
made his acquaintance at Dartmoor, and a more hopeless human
being than he did not exist. He had been brought up by an uncle,
who now washed his hands of him for ever. Everard pitied the
miserable lad, won his affections and conﬁdence, showed him how
he could shorten his term by good conduct, impressed upon him
that one fault need not blight a man’s life, and encouraged him to
achieve a new reputation. '
When he got his ticket-of-leave, he boldly oﬁ'ered his services in
shops and ofﬁces at a low price, in consideration of his antecedents,
and, after many rebuﬁ‘s and much privation during a time when he
kept himself alive by casual manual labor, by dint of persistence
and watching the time when employers were shorthanded, he got
himself taken on as assistant in a draper’s shop, for which he had
done errands and odd jobs.
Here he suffered much misery from the taunts and practical
jokes of his fellow-shopmen, who managed to get hold of his his-
tory, the truth of which he did not deny. Did any petty dishonesty
occur, suspicion turned at once to the gaol~bird ; nay, was anything
lost it was laid to his account. More than once he was on the point
of being taken into custody, when his innocence was proved; and
once the roasting and sending to Coventry he underwent at the
hands of his comrades had become so intolerable that, in his des-
peration, he offered to ﬁght each man separately, in order of senior-
ity, on the condition that the conquered were never again to allude
to his unfortunate past. His challenge was refused on the ground
that no man could sully his hands by ﬁghting him, but one or two
of the better disposed from that day dropped the cruel tyranny,-

others followed their example, and Smithson gradually earned a
character and received full salary.
Then he saved money, and, having gained the affection of a girl
in the millinery department of his house, felt that he had won the
battle of life. They put their savings together and started in a
humble way on their own account, and now they had a large estab-
lishment, and paid their way. They did not, of course, parade
Smithson’s antecedents; but they were determined to have no con-
cealments, and intended that their children, when of ﬁt age, should
know the whole story. Smithson now related to Everard how,
mindful of his own desperate struggles and misery on leaving prison,
he tried to lend others a helping hand, by giving them employment.
It was, however, found extremely diﬁioult to mix them with people
of good reputation. The end of it was that his entire staﬂ‘, both of
house and shop, consisted of criminals, all of whom were supposed
to ignore the antecedents of the others, and many of whom believed
the others to be spotless. Many, whom he was unable to employ
himself, Smithson had set going by offering security for their integ-
rity, and by this means had had the happiness of setting a number
of fallen creatures upon their feet again.
I“ But are you never deceived or robbed? ” asked Everard, who
was deeply interested in his friend’s narration.
Smithson smiled, and replied that his trust had more than once
been abused, but more frequently justiﬁed. That very week he had
paid a hundred pounds surety money.
" You will not make a fortune at this rate, Jim.”
“No, doctor; but we are content to pay our way, and we like
helping people better than getting money,” he replied. “My wife
is greatly set on that, especially on helping the women. Come and
see her; she has heard many a tale of you. It will be supper-time
by the time we are back.”
Everard gladly accepted this invitation, and found among Smith-
son’s staﬁ' another old prison friend, whose memory of him was as
grateful as his employer’s. Smithson showed him the photograph
of a reﬁned-locking woman, with a pleasing face. “ Our fore-
woman,” he said.
“ But surely there is nothing against her,” said Everard.
“She had ten years for killing her husband,” replied Smithson.
“ Capital woman of business, and the sweetest temper. The
dean got hold of her, and sent her to me. He stands surety for

those who have no character. Ah! no one knows the good that
man does! ”
“ Do you mean the Dean of Belminster? ” asked Everard, in a
hard voice. \
“ Of course; the dean—Dean Maitland.”
Everard again looked at the handsome millincr, whose face was
as gentle as it was reﬁned, and could not help asking what led this
amiable person to resort to the extreme measure of murdering her
husband. 'No doubt he deserved it, he thought; but then, so many ~
husbands do, that it would cause considerable social inconvenience
to condone such acts.
“She did it in a passion, poor girl. The fellow was a drunken
brute, years older than she, and he used to beat her and drag her
about by the hair night after night. She put up with it, as so many
poor things do, and went starved and barefoot, though they were
well-to-do people. But one night he came home drunk as usual,
and dashed the baby against the wall, and she took up a knife and
stabbed him to death.”
“And the baby? ” 1 -
A The baby is now in Earlswood, a hopeless idiot. She hopes
to have it home to tend some day. It was a clever little thing, just
beginning to talk. Nobody but the dean and we two guess there is
anything wrong in her past. She is only four and thirty now, and
much admired. My wife is very fond of her.”
“ Have you any more murderers? ” asked Everard.
“Not at present. We are mostly thieves and forgers just now,
and all ﬁrst convictions. Ah, doctor! the Almighty can bring good
out of evil, and it was a happy day for many besides me when ﬁrst
I saw your kind face in that awful place. Nobody but you ever
told me that good is stronger than evil. You said it in the exercise-
yard that cold, foggy Sunday, while all that vicious talk was going
on round us, and the Manler was making his ﬁlthy jokes.”
“That is all over now, Jim, thank God! ” said Everard.
Then the former comrades parted, Everard deeply moved by
what he had seen and heard, and half doubting if the pleasant, open
face of the philanthropic linen-draper, with its look of grave thought
and settled happiness, could indeed be the same as that/white, hag-
gar'd, abject face with the despairing eyes which had so moved his
pity years ago in the dreary prison, and thankful for his long agony
if it had been the salvation of but one fellow-creature.

The next evening found him in the nave of the cathedral some
time before the appointed hour for the lecture, for the verger had
warned him that the attendance would be very large. The sun was
still shining warmly on the lime-tree avenue outside, making the
fresh foliage glow like a jewel of unearthly radiance in its blended
gold and green translucence, throwing long powdery shafts of gold
through the windows up into the dim recesses of the groined roof,
and disclosing carved nooks only thus touched by the midsummer'
glory, and dark all the year long besides. But the body of the ca-
thedral was solemnly dusk, and great masses of shadow brooded in
the choirs, transepts, and chantries, and each brotherhood of massed
pillars in the nave was bound with a girdle of tiny ﬁre-points, which
were to grow larger with the gathering gloom.
Everard watched the great' stream of worshipers pour steadily
and quietly in and ﬁll the long lines of chairs, which made the pil-
lars look more lofty and the soaring roof farther oﬁ' than ever.
They were chieﬂy men, the lectures being specially given for work-
ing men; but women were not excluded, and in some cases accom-
panied a husband, a father, or a brother. Men with hard and
stained hands, with clothes still redolent of the putty, paint, or oil
of the day’s labors; men with rugged, eager faces and athletic
frames, for the most part; also the pallid, weak-kneed tailors, shoe-
makers, and other indoor-laborers. “
Clerks and shopmen were also there, with men of a higher stand-
ing still; but it was the hard-handed fellows in whom Everard found
himself most interested—those extremely human creatures in whom
the elementary instincts and passions are still so active and un-
checked, and whose intellects are so starved and yet so unspoiled.
How would the reﬁned and cultivated (lean touch these? he won-
dered. He had lived among them so long himself that he had ac-
quired a strong affection for the raw material of human nature; but
what link was there between the delicate-handed Cyril and these
untutored sons of impulse? A link there surely must be, or they
would not thus come pouring in to hear him.
Ear down among the hard visages of the artisans, Everard saw
some black-coated, clerical-looking men, whose peculiar half-ﬁnished
appearance proclaimed them to be dissenting ministers, and he re-
membered how the verger told him that the popular Spurgeon
himself did not disdain to try and catch the secret of the dean’s
golden mouthed eloquence.

285 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND.
Such an agitation pervaded his being, that even the quiet majesty
of the great dim cathedral could scarcely calm him. He could now
count the hours before his meeting with Lilian, and another second
might bring him face to face with Cyril, whom he had last seen in
the terrible moment of his sentence. It seemed as if the service
would never begin. The worshipers still poured in, the nave was
full; but where were the clergy? The organ had been sounding
for some time—soft, mellow music, as soothing as the wave-lullaby
of the summer sea, with no hint of slumbering tempests—and a sick
fancy took Everard’s shaken mind that something was wrong, and
Cyril would never come.
He seemed to have been looking at that dark sea of earnest faces,
and hearing that solemn, wave-like music, for ever in the beam-
hroken dusk of the vast building. But at last a melody rose slowly,
like an ocean spirit, out of the softly breaking waves of music, and
ﬂoated away over its surface; it was Mendelssohn’s, “It with all
your hearts ye truly seek me "—the same which Cyril had listened
to in the hour of his desperate inward conﬂict eighteen years ago,
and the small choir entered with two clergyman, one of whom were
the scarlet hood of a doctor over his snowy surplice, and whom he
heard it whispered was no other than the great dean.
He had so stationed himself, partly with a view to being unseen
by the preacher, that he only caught a brief glimpse of the pro-
cession, and lost sight of the dean entirely when the latter took the
place he occupied during the prayers, so that he could not recog-
nize him.
Cyril had risen that morning refreshed by sleep, and had looked
upon the disturbing events of the previous evening from quite an-
other point of view. In the evening, alone in the silence of his
study, he had been a sinful man, face to face with the awful con-
sequences of his guilt, prostrate before the God whose laws he had
broken, and whose priesthood he had dishonored. In the sunny
morning, at the breakfast-table, surrounded by an adoring family,
with servants attentive to his will, with a pile of correspondence
before him—correspondence in which the Dean of Belminster was
asked to do this and that, and implored to give advice or attendance
on the other; correspondence relating to the Bishopric of Warham,
which was now virtually his own—he was another man: he was
the Dean of Belminster, the Bishop Designate of Warham, the friend
of princes and ministers, the popular author, the chosen guide of

troubled consciences. This man naturally thought in other ways
than the conscience-stricken sinner alone with his guilt.
While breakfasting and chatting pleasantly with his children,
and with Miss Mackenzie and the German tutor, both of whom were
under the spell of his fascination, an under-current of thought
passed through his mind on the subject of last night’s unsuspected
agony. While rapidly running through his correspondence, and
answering letter after letter with the swift skill of a practiced pen;
while entering the cathedral behind the white'robed choir; while
listening to the chanted prayers and psalms; while sending his beau-
tiful voice pealing down the dim aisles on the wings of the ancient
Hebrew poems;—the same undercurrent of thought ﬂowed silent-
ly on.
Was it his fault that a series of blunders had condemned Ever-
ard to an excessive sentence for a crime that was never committed?
Was be responsible for the severity of the judge, the stupidity of the
jury, the unlucky blunderings of the witnesses—above all, for the
perjury of Alma. Lee? A man may love a woman who has sinned,
but few men love women who sin for their sake, even though that
sin be of their own compassing. Cyril had turned from Alma after
her ﬁrst fall; but when she stood and swore to the undoing of
Everard, he loathed her with an unspeakable loathing. He said to
himself that she was thoroughly bad, the cause of every trouble he
had ever known; as the sons of Adam always do when they sin, he
threw all the blame on the woman.
He argued within himself that it Was now too late for reparation;
by this time Everard must have nearly completed his term of im-
prisonment. His life had been hopelessly ruined; to stir the muddy
waters of that bitter past would be merely to bring irretrievahle
ruin on others. Alma could not, he thought, clear Everard without
betraying him.
And then he considered his position in the Church, his elevation
in men’s minds, the inﬂuence he had upon his generation—an inﬂu-
ence depending entirely on moral spotlessness, and asked what sin
could equal that of ruining his own career of exceptional usefulness?
To comfort the morbid terrors of a dying reprobate, was he to bring
disgrace upon the national Church, of which he was a chief orna-
ment; nay, upon the very Christianity of which he had been so
famous a teacher? Was he to blast the prospects of his innocent
children; to bring ruin on them, and disgrace upon his aged father

and upon the honored name that even his base-born son revered?
The thing was monstrous; the more he looked at it the more mon-
strous it appeared.
Then he remembered how cruel Fate had been to him, how good
his intentions ever were, how far he had been from dreaming one
of the consequences which wrapped him round now in a net of such
complicated meshing. As to Alma, it turned him sick to think of a
sin which his inmost soul loathed ; he must have been mad, possessed,
suffering from some supernatural assault of the powers of darkness
-and he had repented, Heaven alone knew how bitterly.
He thought of the fatal hour when he disguised himself in his
friend’s dress, with no thought but the desire of escaping recogni-
tion and dread of bringing scandal upon his cloth, never dreaming
that he would be mistaken for Everard, who was singularly unlike
him in face and manner. He thought of the heavy stick he had
taken, simply because a man likes to have something in his hand,
and which he had thrown away before the struggle; of Ben Lee’s
unexpected appearance; of his own wish to appease the anger of
the man he had so cruelly wronged; of Lee’s unbridled fury; of the
violence of his assault upon him; and of the fatal blow which had
been dealt with no ill intention, but was merely the rebound of
that which Lee was dealing him. .
In all this he felt that he had been the sport of a cruel destiny.
the fool of fortune. And bad he not suﬁ'ered enough to atone for
more than men could ever impute to him. He thought of the wife
of his youth, ﬁrst estranged, and then fading before him; of the
sweet faces of his children, and the graves which closed over them
in their loveliest bloom, just as each had twined itself round his
heart. He thought of his son and his hopeless afﬂiction, and his
heart bled. '
Yet he intended to go to the dying woman. But not immedi-
ately; he had pressing duties to perform ﬁrst, and who knew what
might turn up in the mean time? Besides, he needed time for
thought before meeting her.
In the afternoon there came a second message from the sick
woman, bidding him come that day, as she might not live to see
another. He could not come at the moment, having just then an
engagement that could not be postponed ; he promised, with a sick
heart, to come in an hour’s time.
The hour passed. He took his hat and yet lingered, going back

to give some message to Marion, then again to look into Everard’s
study and see how he was getting on; then at last he issued from
beneath the light oolonnade before his door, and set his face toward
the hospital. He had not left the close when a messenger from the
hospital met him, and gave the dean a note, which he opened with
trembling ﬁngers. It was to inform him that Alma was dead.
He turned swiftly hack, and did not stop till he reached home,
entered his study, and locked the door; then he threw himself into
a chair, laid his arms on the table, and, letting his face fall upon
them, burst into tears and sobbed heavily for some time. Some-
thing had turned up, after all, and he was spared the horror of
that dreaded interview, and could only hope that Ahna’s secret had
died with her.
He did not leave his study until it was time to go to the cathe-
dral, which he did with a sense of unspeakable relief. The reaction
after last night’s agony and to-(lay’s conﬂict made him see every-
thing in the brightest colors, and a delicious languor fell upon his
wearied brain, a languor so deep that he felt incapable of rousing
himself to the effort of preaching. His was, however, one of those
ﬁnely strung, nervous natures which respond to the will as a thor-
oughbred horse does to the whip, and do what is required of them
in spite of exhaustion up to the last gasp; and when the brief
prayers were ended, and the great volume of men’s voices rolled out
the hymn before the sermon, he pulled himself together and as-
cended the pulpit with his accustomed air of reverent dignity; and,
having turned up the gas-beads at the desk and placed his manu-
script conveniently, sent a piercing, comprehensive glance all round
the vast building and over the wide sea of rough and earnest faces
which ﬂooded it, as if taking the measure of the human material
spread out, plastic and receptive, before him.
The sight inspired him, and sent a thrill through every ﬁber of
his being; for his was one of those magnetic natures whose strong
’ attractive power over masses is in direct proportion to the stimulat-
ing power of masses upon themselves. He could not preach to empty
benches, but, when he found himself face to face with a multitude,
he threw his own personality into it in such a manner that he he-
came, as it were, a part of his audience, and made it a part of him-
self, so that his own emotions thrilled his hearers, and theirs reacted
upon him. This was one reason why the sermons Everard thought
so commonplace when printed had such a living force when spoken.

Everard, who was so placed by a cluster of pillars as to be half
shielded by them, advanced his head and gazed over his hymn-book;
so that he could see the preacher without much of his own face
being seen, and his ﬁrst glance at the face, islanded from the dusk
in the ruddy glow of gaslight, told him that he must have recog-
nized Cyril anywhere, and set his heart beating vehemently with a
mixture of love and hate.
At forty-three Dean Maitland was in his fullest prime; the years
had ripened instead of wasting and crushing him, as they had Ever-
ard. The dark brown hair waved as gracefully as in his youth
over his broad, clear brow, while the few silver threads in it were
unseen ; the ﬁnely cut, closely shaven features were but little sharp-
ened in outline; the light blue eyes were more sunken, and they
glowed with an intenser radiance. The old face was there, but the
expression was altered ; there was a hard austerity about the mouth
when in repose that verged upon cruelty, though no one who had
ever seen those ﬁne lips curve into their winning smile when speak- .
ing could accuse them of anything harsher than a severe purity
quite in character with the man‘s writings and his calling, and dur-
ing the most impassioned glances of the wonderfully expressive eyes
they had a certain gleam which suggested the quaint and quiet hu-
mor which made the dean so delightful in society.
Yet, over all the face and in the whole bearing, Everard saw an
expression he had never seen before, and which he could not ana-
lyze, but which struck him with keen pain, and called to his mind
Milton’s description of the fallen seraph on whose faded cheek sate
care. .
All that evening Everard‘s mind was haunted by the image of
the fallen angel, once the brightest of the sons of morning, weighted
with his uuutterable woe, and yearning for the lost glory that could
never more be his.
In the mean time, the closing notes of the hymn died away in
the long and lingering cadences of the organ, the great congregation
seated itself with a subdued rustle and murmur, and the dean, in
his magniﬁcent voice and pure enunciation, gave out his text.

THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND. 293.
CHAPTER IV.
Tm: voice which had been so full of music in Cyril Mnitland’s
youth had now become not only an instrument of great compass and
rich tone, but it was played by an artist who was a perfect master
of his craft. It was said of the Bishop of Belminster that he could
pronounce the mystic word “Mesopotamia "in such a manner as
to affect his auditors to tears; but of the dean it might be averred
that his pronunciation of “ Mesopotamia ” caused the listeners’
hearts to vibrate with every sorrow and every joy they had ever
known, all in the brief space of time occupied by the utterance of
that aﬁecting word. Everard had heard this saying in Belminster,
and knew well what Cyril’s voice was of old, but he was quite un-
prepared for the tremendous rush of emotion that overwhelmed him
when the dean opened his clear-cut lips and said, with the pathos
the words demanded, “ We took sweet counsel together, and walked
in the house of God as friends.”
He then paused, as his custom was, to let the words sink deeply
into his hearer’s minds before he began his discourse, and Everard’s
very life seemed to pause with him, while he felt himself shaken in
his innermost depths. Then he remembered that Cyril’s passionate
sermon upon innocence was the last he had heard from him. Since
that he had heard only the discourses of prison chaplains to an ac-
companiment of whispered blasphemy and ﬁlth. Once more he saw
the little church at Malbourne, the beautiful young priest oﬁering the
chalice to the kneeling people in the wintry sun-gleams; once more
he saw the shadowy ﬁgure in the afternoon dusk, uttering his ago—
nized appeals to the startled listeners below.
“ Yes, my brothers,” said the dean (he eschewed “ brethren,” as
both conventional and obsolete, and dwelt with a loving intonation
on the word “ brothers "), “Jesus Christ and J ndas took sweet coun-
sel together, and walked in the house of God as friends, strange as
it appears to us, difﬁcult as it is to realize a fact so startling, since
in all the whole range of the world’s tragic history there has never
been found a character so vile as the one or so spotless as the other.
“Yet they were not only friends, but they actually took sweet
counsel together. Picture that to yourselves, dear brothers: Christ
had pleasant conversations with Judas, asked his opinion on high
and holy subjects, listened to his words, as you and I listen to the

\
words of those dear and near to us. Was there ever a more strange-
ly assorted pair? And yet ”—-the dean paused, and sent the pene-
trating radiance of his gaze sweeping over the mass of upturned
faces before him—“it may be that even now, to-night, with these
eyes of mine, I see among you, my brothers, in this very house of
God, another pair strangely like that mentioned by David in his
prophecy—some loyal follower of Christ taking sweet counsel and
walking as a friend with such a one as Judas, money-loving, ambi-
tious, false; musing even now, with the echoes of psalms and holy
words in his ears, how he may betray the friend who trusts and
loves him. Alas, my brothers, how often is such a companionship
seen; and how often, bow sadly often, is the guileless friend whose
trust and love is betrayed a womanl ‘Nay,’ I hear you say, ‘we
have our faults, we don’t pretend to be saints, but we are not J u-
dases.’ Dare you say that you are no Judas? ” he added, in sharp,
incisive tones, while his glance seemed to single some individual
from the throng and to pierce to his very marrow—“ you, who sold
your wife’s happiness and your children’s bread for a pot of beer?
or you? ” and here the penetrating gaze seemed to single out
another, while the preacher launched at him another sharp denun-
ciation of some homely, everyday vice, using the most direct and
forcible words the language contains to give vigor to his censures,
till the cold sweat stood upon rugged brows, some women wept
furtively, and the dean‘s keen glance perceived the inward trem-
lings of many a self-convicted sinner.
The preacher then observed that the popular conception of Judas
as a truculent thief whose ruflianly character was ill concealed by
his thorough-paced hypocrisy was probably false, and pointed out
that Judas must have appeared to the world in which he lived a.
highly respectable and well-conducted person, if not a very saint.
Nay, it was his own opinion that Judas was actually a very superior
being, a man of lofty aspirations and pure life, a patriot—one who
looked ardeutly for the promised Messiah, and had sufﬁcient faith
to recognize him in the son of the Nazarene carpenter. Why, he
asked his auditors, if he had not been all this, should he have joined
that little band of obscure men, those peasants and ﬁshers, those
men of austere morality and lofty converse, who had left all to follow
the young peasant Prophet who had not even a roof to shelter Him 2

hood of disciples clustering about the Master, who seemed to have

inspired them up to the moment of the cruciﬁxion more with ten-
der and compassionate human devotion than with awe and worship,
and with whom they lived in such close and intimate communion,
taking sweet counsel together on the loftiest subjects, and yet shar-
ing the most trivial events of everyday life; and asked his hearers
if they thought a mere money-lover and traitor could have endured
such a fellowship, or been endured by it. But if Judas were indeed
worthy to be chosen as one of that small and select band (and it
was an undoubted fact that he was thought worthy, and tenderly
loved up to the last by his Divine Master), how was it that he fell
into so black 9. sin, and stamped his name upon all time as a symbol
of the utmost degradation of which man is capable?
“Ah! my brothers," said the dean, “he was a hypocrite, but so
consummate a hypocrite that be deceived himself. lle knew that
he loved God and his Master and Friend, but he did not know, or
would not know, that he loved mammon—the riches of this world
and its pomps and vanities, its ﬂeeting honors and transient foam-
ﬂake of fame—better. The bag naturally fell to him because it had
no attractions for the disciples whose hearts were set upon heavenly
treasure only. The renown of the miracles he witnessed spread so
that idlers ﬂocked as to a show to see them; and this and the hope
of the revival of the Jewish monarchy which ﬁlled the minds of all
the disciples till after Calvary stimulated the man’s ambition, which
he probably mistook for devout zeal till that terrible hour, when the
contempt and hatred which fell upon his Teacher and Friend made
him desert the falling King in his disappointed ambition, and ﬁnally
betray Him.
“ I charge you, my brothers,” continued the dean, with a passion
that shook his audience, “that you beware of self-deception. You
may deceive others—yea, those who love you most dearly and live
with you most intimately, who sit by your hearth and break bread
at your table, through long, long years you may deceive them; and
you may deceive yourselves—you may devote all to God, and yet
keep back one darling sin, one cherished iniquity, that is poisoning
the very springs of your being, like the young man who made the
great refusal, like Ananias and Sapphire; but remember, you can not
deceive God ! ”—here the preacher paused and choked back a rising
sob—“ all is open in his sight”—here the dean trembled, and his
voice took a tone of heart-broken anguish—“There, my brothers,
up there is no shufﬂing.”

296 THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND.
There was silence for some moments in the vast building, broken
only by the deep or quick breathing of the hushed, attentive multi-
tude, and the great secret of the dean’s power ﬂashed swiftly upon
Everard’s mind. It was the fact that the thoughts he was uttering
were not his own; that he was possessed and carried away by some
irresistible power, which forced him to speak what was perhaps
- pain and grief to him, what was utterly beyond his will. A strange
power, truly, which made Ezekiel pronounce his own dire mis-
chance, and predict the taking away the desire of his eyes for
which he dared not mourn; which made Balaam bless when he
tried to curse; and caused Isaiah to foretell in torrents of ﬁery elo-
quence things he desired in vain to look into-a great and awful
gift when given in even the smallest measure, a gift called in olden
times prophecy, in these genius.
A deep awe and compassion fell upon Everard as he looked upon
the agitated and inspired orator, whose soul was so deeply stained
with guilt, and he thought of the disobedient prophet and of other
sinful men, singled out, in spite of their frailty, for the supreme
honor of being the instruments of the Divine Will.
“ Watch against secret sin,” continued the preacher, in a. low
and earnest but distinct and audible voice. " Pray for broken hearts,
failure, misery, anything but the gratiﬁed ambition, the fulfilled
heart’s desire which makes it impossible for you to renounce all
and follow Christ.” Then he spoke of the remorse of Judas and
his miserable end; said that even he would have found instant for-
giveness had he sought or desired it. But he probably did not think
it would be given, since his own love was not large enough for such
a forgiveness, and he thus shrank from the only possible healing for
him. “My brothers,” he said, in a voice which touched the very
core of Everard’s heart, “the man we think most meanly of is the
man we have wronged.”
He pointed out the difference between repentance and remorse;
drew a vivid picture of the latter, which he said was the “ sorrow
of sorrows and the worst torture of hell.” He said that nothing
I earthly could soothe that pain—not all the riches of the world; not
i the esteem of men; not the highest earthly renown, or the enjoy-
ment of beauty, health, youth; not all the pleasures of sense or in-
tellect; not the sweetest and purest treasures of human affection;
and the voice in which he said this was so exquisitely, so despair-
ingly sad, that a wave of intensest pity rushed over Everard’s soul,

. and a great sob rose in his throat, and he knew that the long agony
of the prison life, which had bowed his frame, broken his health,
and shattered his nerves, if not his very intellect, was nothing in
comparison with the secret tortures of the successful man who
stood in purple and ﬁne linen before him.
“Repent,” continued the dean, in a voice of agonized supplica-
tion, “while repentance is possible. Put away the darling sin,
whatever it may be, before it is inextricably wound about your
heait-strings; remember that every moment’s delay makes the
heart harder and the task more difﬁcult. Cut off the right hand,
pluck out the right eye—”
He broke off abruptly, turned pale to the lips, and seemed for a
moment to ﬁght for breath. “ Oh, my God! ” he exclaimed at last,
in.low, agonized, shuddering tones, so diﬂ'erent from the full voice
of impassioned appeal he had been using that they sent an electric
shock through‘the hushed listeners, while the chill drops beaded his
brow, and he gazed ﬁxedly with horror-struck eyes before him, like
one compelled by some irresistible spell to gaze on what his soul
most abhors.
It was the most acute moment in Everard’s life, one to be re-
membered when all else had faded—the moment when betrayer
and betrayed met face to face, gazing into each other’s eyes under
a fascination that each strove vainly to resist. Under the spell of
the dean’s eloquence, Everard had gradually advanced his head
from the shelter of the pillars, the gas-beaded girdle of which, in
the deepening of the summer twilight, cast a strong illumination
upon his features, and thus attracted the preacher’s gaze. That
awful meeting of glances seemed to Everard to endure for an eter-
nity, during which the breathing of the hushed congregation and
the casual stirring of a limb here and there were distinctly audible
in the silence.
Who shall say what these two men, between whom was so much
love and such terrible wrong, saw in the eyes which had met so
often in friendship in the far-off days, when each trusted the other
so fully? Certain it is that there was neither rebuke nor reproach
in Everard’s gaze, and that the dominant feeling in his stirred heart
was a desire to comfort the terrible misery in the false friend’s eyes.
But though there was no reproach in the honest and trustful brown
eyes—sunken as they were in dark orbits caused by long suffering
—the bowed, gaunt form, the haggard, worn features, the sad

look of habitual hopeless pain, the untimely gray hairs and aged
appearance, struck into the betrayer‘s soul like so many burning
daggers tipped with poison. He remembered his friend as he had
last seen him in the beauty and vigor of early manhood, happy,»
hopeful, full of intellect and life, and glowing with generous feeling,
and the sharp contrast revealed to him, in one ﬂash, the wickedness
of his deed. There sat the friend who had loved and trusted him,
marred, crushed, and broken by his own iniquity.
He longed for the massive pillars to crumble to ruins, and the
high stone roof to crash in and hide him from that terrible gaze,
the more terrible because so gentle; he wished the solid pavement
to yawn and swallow him up. A burning pain was stabbing him
in the breast, the clusters of lights danced madly among the shad-
ows before him, the great white sea of human faces surged in heav-
ing billows in his sight, and his tongue clove to the roof of his
mouth when he tried to speak.
Long as it seemed to those two awestruck gazers, it was in
reality but a few seconds before the dean averted his gaze by a
strong effort and spoke.
“I am not well,” he said quietly; and, turning, he descended
the pulpit and vanished among the shadows, while a canon present
said a ﬁnal prayer and gave the blessing.
From the comments of the congregation as they streamed out
beneath the avenue of lindens, Everard gathered that it was not
the ﬁrst time the dean had been taken ill while preaching, the
excitement of which appeared to be too much for his physical
strength.
He lingered about the cathedral precincts in the pleasant sum-
mer dusk, through which a few pale stars were gleaming softly, and
listened to the conversation around him, gazing wistfully at the
Deanery, under a strong impulse to enter it. He contented himself, ,
however, with joining a little group of working men, who, after an
interval, went to the house and inquired for the health of the popu-
lar preacher, and who were told that the dean had recovered from
the spasmodic seizure to which he was subject, and was now resting.
A clergyman had passed out of the cathedral at Everard’s side,
with rather a strange smile on his face, and had observed to a lady
who was with him, “ How did you like the play? ”
“ What do you mean?” she returned, with an indignant accent.
“ Well, did you ever see a better actor than the Anglican Chry-

sostom? " he continued, with a sarcastic accent, which caused her
to accuse him of professional jealousy.
This man had heard the last dying words of Alma Judkins a few
hours before.
Everard was so shaken by what he experienced in the cathedral
that he could not return to his hotel, where his dinner was await-
ing him, but walked rapidly through the dim streets, and climbed
the hill to breathe the free, fresh air of the wide downs, whence he
saw the city, starred with ﬁre-points, lying like a dropped and
dimmed constellation in the valley beneath.
There he thought much, walking swiftly beneath the clear, quiet
sky, pale in the June twilight, and gleaming with languid stars,
until something of the holy calm of Nature had entered his breast,
and he returned, quieted, yet full of deeply-stirred feelings, to the
George Inn.
Then he took a pen, and wrote as follows:
“Dean CYRXL: I need not tell you that I was in the cathedral
to-night, since I saw with what pain you recognized me. You
possess the great secret of eloquence, earnestness and genuine feel-
ing, and your sermon revealed to me how terribly you have suf-
fered. You will not be surprised to hear that I know all. I did
not suspect it until that poor girl swore against me in the witness-
box, when the whole truth ﬂashed upon me, and every little inci-
dent connected with that sad affair became clear and comprehensi-
ble. That was the saddest moment in my life, far more bitter than
the moment of my conviction or that of my severe sentence. The
man never lived who was dearer to me than you, and I revered
you as a man reveres his own conscience. I thought then that
there could be no suffering to equal mine, but to-night I learned
from your own lips, my poor Cyril, that there is a deeper anguish
still, an anguish that you have borne secretly for eighteen mortal
years beneath a semblance of outward prosperity. How shall I
comfort you? If my forgiveness can avail anything, it is yours
fully and freely. Remorse, as you said to-night, is wholly poison-
ous; it is futile to lament the unreturning past. Dear Cyril, let
us manfnlly face the consequences, and cease bewailing what can
not be mended. Much peace and usefulness, yes, and much hap—
piness, may yet be yours. I have suﬂered not only the penalty, but
an exceeding penalty for that tragic moment in the wood—against

my wiil, it is true; but now I ask you, who believe in vicarious
sacriﬁce, to take those eighteen years as a free gift, and remember
that, as far as this life is concerned, that poor fellow’s death has
been amply stoned for. I see that you are struggling with your-
self to confess and make atonement before the world, but the time
has gone by for that, and it could avail nothing now. Lilian has
always been convinced of my innocence, and nearly all others to
whom my good name was dear are gone. I have lived through the
obloquy as far as the world is concerned; the revelation of the
truth could only bring sorrow unspeakable to many, and no help to
me. Besides, you have unusual gifts; you have acquired a position
and a character which give you singular power over men; you
ought not to triﬂe with these. If I am to be useful to my fellow-
creatures, it must be in quite other ways. But you, with your
remarkable gifts and the great position you have achieved, have
also incurred a great responsibility, and the very failings and faults
which have caused such pain have led you through such unusual
paths of spiritual experience as may give you unusual power in
dealing with the sickness of men’s souls. You have told men the
terrors of remorse; tell them now the peace of repentance, the joy
of forgiveness. If you need a penance, take that of silence on that
one sad subject. Let that lie between you and me as a bond of
friendship, and let it be heard in the ears of men no more; and let
us meet again on the old pleasant footing. I have seen and spoken
with your son, and heard his beautiful voice, and I am glad that
he hears our name. May Heaven’s blessing and peace be yours for
everl Your friend, HENRY EvnRARn.”
It was not until the following morning that the dean received
this letter, along with many others, at breakfast.
Physical pain had mercifully come to his relief in the moment
of extreme agony in the cathedral, and so benumbed and clouded
his mental faculties. It had further obliged him to use a prescrip-
tion of his physician’s intended for such seizures, and of an antes-
thetic nature, so that he had passed the night in artiﬁcial slumber,
if that could be called slumber which was animated by a continual
torturing consciousness of the dreaded face he had seen in the cathe-
dral, and an unspeakable terror of some impending descent into yet
greater misery.
Yet he awoke in the morning so permeated with this dread cone

Icieusness that he had not to face the shock of emerging from the
balm of oblivion to a new and unfamiliar grief, the shock that greets
us, on the threshold of a new day, with such a numbing power in
the beginning of a fresh sorrow. Of course, he had contemplated
the possibility of such a meeting as that of the previous evening,
but he had no idea it was so near, since Lilian had long ceased to
give him any intelligence of Everard, and also, with his characteris-
tic unreason, he hoped something might in the mean time turn up.
Everard’s death was one of these bright possibilities.
He did not recognize the handwriting, changed as it was by long
disuse and the stiffening of the joints resulting from habitual hard
labor, and ran rapidly through the pile of letters, taking the known
correspondents ﬁrst. It was only when he had opened the envel-
ope, and read the familiar commencement of “Dear Cyril,” that
the writing struck a chord in his memory, and he turned with a
sick dread to the signature.
Marion saw him turn livid, and then, when he glanced rapidly
over the contents, ﬂush a deep red. Then he laid the letter aside,
and went on quietly with his breakfast, joining, in his accustomed
manner, in the household chat; but he ate little, which Marion at-
tributed to his recent seizure and the anodyne he had taken.
Immediately after breakfast he went to his study, giving orders
to Benson, as he frequently did, that he was on no account to be
disturbed till luncheon, at which meal he appeared as usual.
Marion observed, and remembered afterward, that he was
extremely pale and very quiet, only addressing herself and her
brother occasionally, and then with unusual gentleness. He was
always gentle to them, for he was a most tender father, passionately
fond of his children, and having the art, by virtue of his winning
manner and personal charm, to keep them in absolute discipline,
while indulging them to the utmost, so that, without ever using a
harsh word to them, his will was their law, and they obeyed him
without knowing it; but to-day his gentleness amounted to ten-
derness, and his voice and glances, when he spoke to them, were
like a caress.
“ Well, Marry,” he said, breaking into a conversation between
the children and their tutor and governess, which he had evidently
not heard, “ what do you say to running down to Portsmouth to
your Uncle Keppel’s with Everard for a few days? ”
“Nothing, papa,” she replied, with her pretty spoilt air.

“ Would you not like to go, dear? ” he asked. “The sea is
charming just now, and all the naval gayeties are in full swing.
The new ironclad is waiting for you to inspect and help launch her,
and your cousins are all at home, and Everard would enjoy the mili'
tary bands and the bathing; eh, laddie'i‘ ”
“Well, I suppose it will be a fair time to go, but how can you
get away? ” said Marion, when her father replied that he did not
intend to accompany them.
“Then, we don’t want to go,” she returned; and Evermd in~
dorsed her words heartily. I
“ You don’t get tired of your old father 7 " he asked, his eyes
clouding and his voice quivering a little.
“ There never was such a daddy-sick pair,” laughed Miss Mac-
kenzie.
“ But you can not always be tied on to the old father,” said the
dean, pinching Marion‘s soft cheek. “ Come now, suppose you
pack up your smartest bonnets and frocks, and Everard’s violin,
and run down this afternoon. Your Aunt Keppel will be at the
station to meet you at six.”
“Today? Oh, papa! what can possess you i ” cried Marion.
“ Ob, not till Monday 1 “ pleaded Everard. “I am to take a solo
to-morrow afternoon.”
“ Never mind the solo, lad,” said his father, looking wistfully on
the boy’s sightless face. “Dr. Rydal will recover from the shock ;
a little adversity will do him good, autocrat that he is. You will
go, darlings, by the 4.30 train. And, if the bonnets and frocks are
not smart enough for fashionable Southsea, you can get what you
want there. Here is a check, Marry. And there, Everard, is a
sovereign for you to buy toffee with. Herr Obermaun is tired of
his unmanageable pupil, and will be glad of a holiday to rummage
over old parchments with Canon Drake; “ and the dean rose from
the table with a look that said that the business was concluded, and
strolled languidly into the garden, Everard's hand in his.
“ Miss Mackenzie,” said Marion, remaining behind a minute,
“there is something unusual about papa to-day. Do you think I
ought to leave him? He ate nothing; he looks ill.”
“He is always languid and weak after one of his attacks, Marry.
The great thing is not to worry him, and, of course, he has a great
deal on his mind now. Perhaps, until the bishopric business is quite
decided, he would rather have you out of the way."

Miss Mackenzie’s words were reasonable, and Marion felt that
she must abide by them, and yet she could not conquer the vague
disquiet she felt on her father’s account. She followed him into
the old-fashioned, red-walled garden with a solicitude hitherto un-
known in her spoilt-child existence, and watched him narrowly.
“ You are becoming a perfect ogre, daddy, hustling us off in this
despotic manner; now, isn’t he, Everard?” she said, joining them.
“ A regular tyrant," laughed the boy. “But, I say, why can’t
' you come with us, papa? It is on your way to Osborne.”
“ Of course it is; how delightful! ” added Marion.
“ I am not going to Osborne,” replied the dean.
“Not going to dine at Osborne to-nightl ” exclaimed the chil-
dren, who knew that a royal invitation is also a command. “ Why,
what will the Queen say? Will she send you to the Tower? ” asked
Everard, his mind ﬁlled with visions of scalfclds and axes.
“Never mind the Queen,” said the dean, sitting down on a gar-
den seat and placing the boy between his knees, and passing his arm
round the girl with a grave and preoccupied air, which surprised
his daughter, whom he was wont perpetually to tease and banter in
a way that she thought delightful. Neither of them spoke for a few
minutes, and then the dean asked the children if they were happy,
and they replied heartily in the afﬁrmative, adding that they were
always happy with him, and thought all pleasures dull without him.
“I have tried to make you happy,” he said, in his rich, pathetic
tones; “ I have wished so much to give you a happy youth to look
back upon. My own youth was very, very happy, and I have
always been so thankful for it; it is a possession for a whole lifetime,
in spite of the sorrow with which the world is ﬁlled, and which we
must all plunge into sooner or later. Your father is a. sinful man,
dear children, but he has tried to be good to you—that has been his
greatest earthly aim. And you have been dutiful and aﬁectionate.
I am a successful man, and have been able to give you a pleasant
home, but who can say if it may last? Trouble may come—we may
be parted. Well, dears, if that time comes, think gently of the
father who, whatever his faults were, earnestly sought his children’s
happiness.”
The children protested with half-frightened aﬁ‘ection; but he
scarcely heeded them, and, gently unwinding their clasping hands,
withdrew, unable to speak for tears, and, waving them off with a
gesture of command, went back to his study.

“Oh, Marry ! ” cried Everard, “something dreadful has hap-
pened. Perhaps the Queen is angry. What can it be? ”
Marion comforted him with all the wisdom of her sixteen years,
saying that there was probably some bitch about the bishopric, and
this had saddened their father.
He took them to the station and saw them off, arranging all he
could for their comfort and security, and embraced them on the
public platform with unusual tenderness, apparently oblivious of all
the hustle and noise going on around him. He put a basket of fruit
into their hands to refresh them on the road when they were in the
carriage, and then stood on the step and kissed and blessed them
solemnly once more, and, when the train ﬁnally moved oﬂ‘, stood
wistfully gazing until the last ﬂutter of Marion‘s handkerchief was
invisible in the distance.
All her life Marion remembered his yearning gaze and his pale,
sad face, as he stood without a trace of his usual playful animation
when in their presence, a solitary black ﬁgure, watching them with
his hand shading his eyes, until the distance had swallowed them
up.
“ Can you see him still 2 ” asked the blind boy.
“Not now; he is lost,” replied Marion; and she burst into tears
under the pressure of an indeﬁnable sadness.
CHAPTER V.
Evnmnn slept like an infant after writing his letter, and rose
full of eager hope and trembling anticipation on the morrow, re-
membering that the day had at last dawned when he was to meet
Lilian once more.
He might have seen her many times during his imprisonment,
but he could not endure that she should submit to the restraints
necessarily imposed on convicts‘ visitors, or that she should see him
in his humiliation, and had thus declined her offered visits. He
could not even hear to go to her straight from prison; he felt that
some days at least were necessary to carry off the prison air, and
take away the contamination of those hated walls. He looked in a
glass, and sighed deeply, thinking that he saw plainly written all

over him, “ticket-of-leave man." As for his hands, which he had
treated with unguents and cosmetics, and kept night and day in
gloves, he looked at them in despair. The ﬂattened ﬁnger-tips,
broken and discolored nails, distorted joints, and horn-hardened
palms were beyond redemption. It seemed to his sensitive fancy
that all the world must know as well as he that his peculiar gait
was the result of the irons he had worn after his brief escape, and
the sick thought came to him that his intellect must be as much
marred as his body. He felt utterly ruined.
He lingered about Belminster till the afternoon, secretly cherish-
ing a hope that Cyril might send some letter or message to the
George for him; but nothing came, and he took his seat in the train
with a disappointed heart.
A clergyman, in a round felt hat with a rosette, and the longest
of coats, was just stepping out of the down train as Everard was
stepping in. They came face to face, and Everard stepped back to
allow the other to pass, thus gaining a full and prolonged view of
his features, while the clergyman passed gravely on, carelessly
scanning Everard’s face without a gleam of recognition in his own.
But Everard knew him at once. It was his brother George.
Everard got in, the doors banged, the train moved off, and he
found that his carriage was shared by an elderly man with a clever,
keen face, which seemed strangely familiar to him, though he could
not identify it, search his memory as he would. The old gentleman
apparently had the same degree of memory for Everard, since, after
his ﬁrst searching glance at him when he entered the carriage, he
kept giving him furtive and puzzled looks over his papers. Presents
ly the papers of both gentlemen were laid aside, and the stranger
moved over to the corner seat opposite Everard, evidently prepared
for a friendly chat, and made some remark on the line over which
they were passing. His voice sent a strange tremor through Ever-
ard’s too-sensitive nerves, and, after a brief interchange of common-
place, he told his vie-d-ois that his face and voice were familiar to
him, but that he was unable to recall his name.
“You are associated in my mind with something of a distressing
nature,” he added.
“I was just about to observe the same with regard to you,”
replied his new-found acquaintance, “ save that you are associated
with nothing distressing to me. To tell the truth, my features are
associated with distressing circumstances in a great many people‘s

minds,” he added, laughing. “My name is Manby, Sir William
Manby,” he eXplained, with the air of one uttering a rich joke.
“I now remember you perfectly,” returned Everard, quietly,
“though I can not claim the honor of your acquaintance. My
name is Everard, Henry Oswald Everard, and when I last saw you
you sentenced me to twenty years penal servitude for a crime which
I never committed.” ~
“Good God! ” exclaimed the judge, starting back with moment-
ary dismay, but quickly recovering himself, and putting up his gold-
rimmed eye-glasses and closely scrutinizing him. “ Henry Everard,
to be sure! Yes, yes, I remember the case perfectly. The jury
were unanimous, the evidence clear; ” and the judge thought within
himself that to be alone in a railway carriage with a man one has
given twenty years for a manslaughter one believes to be murder
is an awkward thing.
“The evidence was indeed clear,” said Everard, “but it was
misleading, nevertheless, and there was a terrible miscarriage of
justice.”
The quiet air with which he spoke, and the look of his care-
worn face, impressed the judge. He could not help giving some
credence to his words. -
“ If you were indeed not guilty, Dr. Everard,” he said, after
looking thoughtfully at him for some moments,” “there must have
been some very hard swearing.”
“There was,” replied Everard. “There was perjury on the
part of one witness.” ~
“ Its motive?”
“ To shield the real culprit.”
“ The law gives you a remedy if you can but prove the perjury,”
said the judge.
“ I do not wish to prosecute,” replied Everard. “ Besides, what
court can give me back those years of imprisonment ? ”
“ How many did you serve? ”
“ Eighteen.”
“ Eighteen years,” returned the judge, his thoughts running back
through that period of time, and taking count of the things that
had occurred and the changes that had been wrought in it; “ eigh—
teen yearsl And you were then a young man.”
Everard smiled sadly at the contrast these words implied.
“ Then, you are only recently enlarged 2 ” Sir William added.

‘
“ Last Monday. I have a ticket-of-leave.”
The judge looked at the broken and prematurely aged man with
an inward shudder. He thought of the long line of malefaetors he
had sentenced, not only to imprisonment, but even to death, and
wondered if he could have pronounced those sentences if he had
been doomed to see them carried out.
“ I well remember the pain with which I passed your sentence,"
he said. “ Ajudge need have a heart of iron and nerves of steel.
But the evidence was so clear.”
“ You could do no otherwise. The jury found me guilty, and I
could not clear myself.”
“Eighteen years," continued the judge, in a voice which had a
quiver in it. “I am an old man, Dr. Everard, an old man, and it
can not be many years at the latest before I must stand at the bar
of a justice that can not miscarry, but if I thought that I had con-_
demned a fellow-creature unjustly to eighteen years imprisonment
with hard labor—” '
“Do not think it, dear sir,” interrupted Everard, trying to
sooth the rising agitation in the old man’s mind ; “the injustice
can not be laid to your charge. No human tribunal can be infal-
lible; but, as you say, there is a Judge who can not err, and, when
you and I are confronted at that bar, your verdict upon me will be
reversed without blame to yourself.”
“I'trust so, I trust so,” replied the old man; “and, in the mean
time, I hope that you hear me no ill-will.”
“ Heaven forbid, whose instrument you arel ” returned Everard,
taking and warmly pressing the hand the judge offered him.
“I shall desire your further acquaintance, sir,” said the old gen-
tleman, when the train steamed into the Oldport station; “it not
now, in a better world'than this.”
_ And they parted, Everard leaving the carriage, and standing
with a throbbing heart on the platform, while his portmanteau was
placed on a. ﬂy, and thinking how great was the contrast between
his manner of leaving that station and returning to it. He left it in
the keen .wintry fog, with handcuffed wrists, in charge of constables,
and returned shaking hands with his judge in the warm June sun-
shine.
It was strange to see the little well-known town basking in the
summer heat, and filled with the familiar, homely stir of the market-
day, just as it had done all those years ago, and he looked about at

the houses and shops, with their friendly air of recognition, to see
if there were any faces he knew. There stood the town hall, the
earliest scene of his terrible humiliation, with its familiar colon-
nade and balcony, its clock striking four in the old homelike tones,
and the gilt ﬁgures on its dial burning in the bright sunbeams. The
stolid policemen were standing in the square in front of it, as they
had done in the days of his trial. He recognized one, a gray-
headed man in the stripes and dress of a sergeant, as the middle-aged
and constable who had conducted him to the magisterial pres-
ence, wondered if the man remembered him.
The carriage seemed at the same time to crawl and to ﬂy in the
medley of feelings which urged him onward and backward. Would
they never get out of Oldport? The streets were cumbered with
carriers’ carts and wagons; droves of pigs and bewildered cattle;
dense-looking farmers, shabbin dressed, but concealing a fund of
shrewd sense beneath their stolid countenances, and having well-
lined pocket-books in their queer old coat-pockets; and denser-
looking laborers, whose heavy air of stupidity was half assumed and
half on the surface.
Smart new suburbs had put forth a pert growth in those eigh-
teen years, and joined the little town to its quiet village neighbor,
Chalkburne, the solid gray tower of which looked down as usual
from its centuries of gray calm on the ﬁtful stir and fret around it,
and the fevered hopes and fears that must end at last in the quiet
green mounds at its feet. And now at last the hill beyond Chalk-
burne was climbed; they were on the white chalk road that wound
along by the downs. There were the woods of Swaynestone in the
distance and beyond them the unseen tower of Malbourne Church,
and beneath that the Rectory, with its long-buried treasure of love
and hope and trust.
The little bays along the coast shone in azure calm, and showed
the silver gleam of a sail here and there: the woods spread their
fresh green domes toward the sea; the scent of mown grass ﬁlled
the air, and the brown-armed haymakers were busy in the meadows.
It was all so familiar, and yet so strange to his prison-worn eyes.
Now they passed Swaynestone, where Sir Lionel reigned no
more, having been gathered to his fathers; and there, on the left,
stood the sham Greek temple, its colonnade gleaming white in the
sunlight, and its architrave sharply outlined against the fatal green
coppice cresting the hill behind it. Everard could not see this spot,

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 309
the source of so much misery, without a shudder, nor could the
tenderer associations of his walk there with Lilian eﬁ'ace the horror
of it from his mind.
And now that too was left behind, and there were only a few
ﬁelds between him and Melbourne, and his pulses throbbed. All
these pleasant home scenes were the same as in the old times, only
the eyes which looked upon them were changed. Not a homestead
or cottage was removed; there were no new buildings. The werk-
shops of the wheelwright were now in sight. He could see a man
in a paper cap hammering in its dark interior; then the cottage,
with its wicket opening on to the road, and its two lime-trees arch-
ing over the path in front of the porch; then the yard, cumbered
with a litter of timber and broken-down wagons, the scene of end-
less games with Cyril and the wheelwright’s boys; and then the
corner was turned, and the well-known village street, with the
square, gray tower at the end, lay before him.
He stopped at the Sun, to leave his portmanteau. He felt that
he could not go on; a sudden horror Overwhelmed him at the sight
of the home he had left so different a being, and all the degradation
and suﬁering of those eighteen years seemed to rise up and stand
between him and the woman for whom he had dreamed so differ-
ent a destiny. He had pictured this moment so often in the soli-
tude of his cell, and dwelt with such rapture upon his reunion with
Lilian as the end of all that bitter misery, that he had not thought
of the terrible change time and suffering had wrought in him till ,
now, when it rushed in upon him like a ﬂood.
Love never grows old; the lover is always the same within, and
Everard’s mental pictures of Lilian and himself always portrayed
them both in the ﬂower of youth, and were ﬁlled with youth’s ten-
der glamour. Perhaps he even thought unconsciously that their
meeting would eﬁ'aee the ravages of those weary years from his life,
with all that was sorrowful and distressing.
And now he stood within sight of the roof that sheltered her,
face to face with the sorrowful fact that youth had vanished for ever,
and that the best part of the life they should have spent together _
was gone beyond recall. Only the fragments of life remained now
--only the wrecks and ﬂoating spars of his own ship of life and of
Lilian’s.
He now remembered that she too must have changed. Her
y0uth was also gone; incredible as it appeared, she too had suffered

310 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN JIAITLAND.
and borne the weight of sorrow-laden years. What if they should
not be able to recognize each other? What if each found a stranger
in the place of the beloved? Would not their meeting be too
severe a test for human constancy?
Shaken by these half-morbid thoughts, the broken man entered
the little hostelry, and, taking pen and ink, wrote to apprise Lilian
of his arrival, and to appoint an hour for calling at the Rectory;
for he felt that he could not go there unexpectedly, and drop in
like a chance visitor, with the possibility of seeing her for the ﬁrst
time in public. He wished also to warn her that she must not ex-
pect to see the Henry of old days again, but only the shattered
wreck of a man who had long left youth and hope behind.
Having dispatched the note, he sat down and waited in the little
parlor assigned him, in a state of tense excitement, which made the
slightest sound, the ticking of a clock, the sound of wheel or hoof
on the road, unbearable.
At last he sprang up and passed through the open French win-
dow into the old-fashioned cottage garden, where stood a rude sum-
mer-house, with a table and wooden settles, in which the village
parliament was often held on summer evenings. A side-window
of the bar gave upon the garden. and, pacing restlessly up and down
the ﬂagged path, Everard heard through the easement, which stood
open to the summer air, the familiar twang of the local dialect
borne by rustic voices upon his ear.
lie glanced in as he passed. and recognized a face or two through
all the mists and shadows of those years. George Straun, the burly
blacksmith. stood as sturdy as ever, though his hair was now well
powdered by the hand of Time. He recognized Stevens, the clerk,
the years having altered his outward man but little, though they
had made him more garrulous and opinionated than ever.
“Ay, Jarge Straun,” he was saying, “there’s a vine weight of
grass hereabouts, zure-ly. I don’t mind a heavier crop as I knows
on this twenty year. Athout ’twas the year Ben Lee come by’s
death.”
" I minds that there crop,” returned William Grove, whom Ever-
ard had not recognized—"well I minds ’un. That there spring

“ And a vine zummer as ever I zee.” added Stevens, “ and the
graves as easy to dig as easy; the sile entirely crumbed up wi’ the

for poor Ben Lee—ay, that ’twas." I
“Ah! ” growled the blacksmith, withdrawing his broad face
from the eclipse of his pewter pot and passing his hand slowly over
his mouth, “ he never done that, Dr. Everard didn’t.”
“Z0 you zays, J arge Straun. And zay it you med till you was
black i’ the vaace, but you wouldn’t vetch ’un onto’ jail,” retorted
Stevens, resuming a battle that had raged incessantly for the last
eighteen years between the village worthies, whom the question
had split into two unequal factions.
" I zeen ’un myself,” continued Straun, leader of the not-guilty
faction, “ a-gwine down street in the vull daylight. And he hadn’t
no gray clo‘es on. ’8 coat was so black as my hat. Well I minds

“He never done it,” reiterated the blacksmith, stolidly. -
“Not he didn’t,” added William Grove. “He zeen my little
maid and give her a penny, and .she’ve a got ’un now.”
“And he zeen Granfer at vive o’clack, when them maids swore

of having ﬁnally clinched his argument.
“Ay, William Hale,” returned Stevens, sarcastically, “you’ve

bring ’em out. But Zir Ingram, he zeen ’un a-runnin’ across that

well as any man I knows on, but ’s eddication was etfective; it
didn’t come up to Sir Ingram’s college scholarding, it didn’t. Naw,
naw.”
A pause ensued, the little company feeling crushed by the
weight ol'Stevens’s long words, a species of powerful artillery that
he only brought to bear on his adversary when hard pressed. Then
Tom Hale, who some time ere this had beaten his sword into a
wheelwright’s tools, took up his parable on this wise :
“ He never done it, Dr. Everard didn’t.”
“If he never done it, who did?” inquired the landlord, per-
tinently.
“Darn it alll ” said William Grove, driving his hand through
his bushy hair in dire perplexity, and repeating the phrase he had
used any time this eighteen years, “zomebody done it. Why, I

was Granfer’s words,” said the wheelwright, looking round with
great solemnity.
“Zomebody done it,” continued Stevens, with authority, “and
if ’twasn’t Dr. Everard, who was it as done it. Athout ’twas Mr.

Maitland hisself,” he added, with intense sarcasm, “or maybe Mr.
Oyril. Zomebody done it, that’s as plain as plums.”
“He never done it,” repeated the sturdy blacksmith, ﬁnishing
his ale and, stamping off homeward with a. sullen “Good night”
7 to all.
“ There was Alma Lee,” continued the landlord, who never liked
a good argument conducing to the dryness of the inner man to drop,
“ she knowed who done it. And she sweared dead agen the doctor,
she did.”
“ And she med swear,” commented William Grove; “she was a
bad ’un. Them there stuck-up gals isn’t never up to no good. Mr.
Maitland, and they up Rectory, they had the sp’ilin’ 0’ she.”
“ Ay l ” growled the wheelwright ; “poor Charlie Judkinsl
What he took out to ’Merriky wi’ ’un warn’t no account, no-
how.”
“ A baddish'cargo ’twas,” added Tom Hale; and the whole com-
pany joined in condemning the unfortunate girl, with the wholesale
condemnation dealt out by men to the woman who makes the small-
est slip on the slippery path of right.
Just then the dear old familiar voice of the church clock told the
hour, sending a quiver through Everard‘s frame with every stroke
of its mellow bell; and, passing through the garden gate into the
village street,_ he bent his steps toward the Rectory.
CHAPTER VI.
EVERY feature of the well-remembered scene was the same, only
the faces of the people were altered. Men were working in their
little gardens, women standing at wicket gates with babies in their
arms, children playing in the dusty road. The forge was all aglow,
its furnace showing lurid red in contrast with the evening sunbeams.
Straun’s eldest son, a stout fellow over thirty, was dealing his ring-
ing blows upon the anvil, in the cheery familiar rhythm of his
craft.
The little band of children who always cluster about a forge were
sporting round it, and turned to stare at the stranger. A tiny creat-
ure tottered away from its child nurse, and stood open-armed in Ever-

ard’s path, greeting him with a joyous gurgle. He patted the ﬂaxen
head, and passed on with a kind word. He was glad to see children
run to him with conﬁdence.
Every step on the familiar path made his heart beat more wildly.
Something was rising chokingly in his throat, so that he was afraid
to trust himself farther on, and paused, leaning against the church-
yard wall, behind which he could see the inscription on Granfer’s
tombstone, and imagined that he saw female ﬁgures emerging from
the Rectory gate or strolling under the trees, and asked himself,
“Is it she? ”
It was no fancy. A tangible, solid woman’s form was indeed
pacing, heavily pacing, the gravel drive; the form was stout, the
hair iron-gray, the gait clumsy. A sick fear took him, and he re-
membered that Lilian was ﬁve and twenty eighteen long years ago.
The lady opened the gate and issued forth, her features showing
distinctly in the rich sunlight. They were heavy, commonplace,
and quietly contented, and he did not recognize the once pretty
Miss Garrett of N orthover, now the mother of half a dozen stout
lads.
He recovered from this miserable, nervous weakness, and walked
stoutly on, growing paler as he approached the beloved house. It
was a delicious evening. The air was still and pure, and balmy
with the scent of ﬂowers and hay; the long sunbeams touched the
woods and downs with tender glory; the swallows were darting
round the tower, whose gray face was gilded by the western glow,
and glancing across the pure, pale sky, their bodies gleaming with
gold, like the doves of Scripture, “ whose feathers are like gold”;
down in the thickets the thrushes and blackbirds were pouring out
their evening lay; and a pair of lurks were maddening each other
with the rival raptures of their song overhead.
He passed the bit of green on which Lennie and Dickie Stevens
were ﬁghting on the winter afternoon when he left it, handcuffed
and amazed. He opened the gate and entered. There was the
laburnum planted on the birthday, a great tree now; down there
they used to play at Robinson Crusoe. The great pear~tree was
still standing from which Cyril fell that far-off autumn day; he
could even now see the boy lying white and still on the grass, hear
Lilian’s cry of terror, and recall the sick pang with which he thought
he might be killed.
He reached the door, and a mist came before his eyes, whirling

so that he could not see the bell-handle for a few seconds, and had
to grope for it. The bell echoed through a silent house; he heard
footsteps coming along the well-known corridor and through the
hall; the door opened, and disclosed the blooming face of a parlor-
maid, who regarded him without interest.
“ Is Miss Maitland at home? ” he asked, in a voice from which
every vestige of tone had vanished.
“ Yes, sir. What name, if you please? ”
‘“ Dr. Everard," he faltered huskily, and a terror came over him,
and made him think that he should have to turn back, unable to face
the moment.
The maid, however, whisked airily on to the drawing~room
door, which she opened, pronouncing his name with metallic clear-
ness. ~
In the well-known room all seemed dark after the bright external
sunshine. The Venetians were closed against the western glow,
and the deep gloom was emphasized here and there by a long rod
of golden light falling through the chinks. He stood irresolute just
within the door. A ﬁgure rose from the far end, and he heard, in
Lilian‘s pure and silvery tones, one cry of “ Henry I ” as she moved
toward him.
For a space he seemed both blind and deaf, and then all the pain-
ful agitation fell away from him, the sick yearning of the long years
was stilled. the nervous weakness gone. He was healed and calmed,
himself once more; for it was indeed Lilian who stood before him
—the same, same Lilian, with the sweetest soul that ever leaked
from clear eyes gazing up into his own, the Lilian of his young love,
the Lilian of his long, pining prison-dreams.
These ﬁrst few moments were too tense for memory; neither of
the re-united lovers was ever able to recall anything but a dream-
like sense of happiness from them; each spoke, but neither remem-
bered what was said.“ The ﬁrst moment of distinct daylight con-
sciousness was when they found themselves sitting hand-in-band on
the couch which had been Mrs. Maitland’s through .40 many years
of weakness, silent and happy and perfectly calm.
Everard was wholly pervaded by a sense of Lilian’s pure and
wholesome presence; he was soothed and blessed by it, as one is
by the beauty of some fresh and fair summer evening, when the
whole earth is bathed in the purity of soft and cloudless light, and
the stainless air is stilled as if to listen to the voices of the sea and

the forest and the bridal songs of many birds. Such had always
been the eﬁ'ect of her presence. It had ever brought him renewal
and fresh strength, together with the calm of perfect happiness; but
now, after the long abstinence, the eighteen years’ fast, the effect
was tenfold.
They sat a long time thus, forgetth of everything but the divine
rapture of that long~desired moment, forgetful of all the wrong and
misery, the sin and degradation and loss of the weary years that
had parted them, forgetful of every creature but each other; and
then Lilian began to speak of those he had loved, and at last rose
from the pleasant shadows and went to the bay window.
“It is dark,” she said, in the beloved remembered voice; “ we
will have light.”
And in a moment she had drawn up the rattling Venetian blind,
and the full blaze of evening sunshine poured in upon her. It
crowned her rich hair with new glory, it fell like a benediction
upon her calm brow and ﬁnely curved lips, it clothed her form with
a robe of radiance, as she stood erect and well poised in the perfec_
tion of grace that is only possible to a form of beautiful proportions,
her head slightly thrown back, her glance raised to the glowing sky,
and one arm, from which the lace fell backward, extended in the
act of drawing the cord. She stood in the magic glow transﬁgured,
exalted by the deep emotion of the moment, and wearing, in Ever-
ard‘s eyes, a brighter glory than that of youth.
There had ever been in Lilian an enduring charm over which
years could have no power—a something so superior to beauty that
it made people forget to ask if that divine gift were hers, and which
also made it impossible to think of age or youth in connection with
her. Though it was well known that the dean was her twin brother,
no one ever dreamed of attributing his three and forty years to her;
nor did any one commit the mistake of treating her as a girl. She
did not grow old or fade; she simply developed in so harmonious a
manner that each year of her life seemed the year of culminating
prime.
A minute and microscopic examination of her features might
have enabled a physiologist to assign her the true tale of her years;
there might have been gray hairs among the brown, soft waves, but
no one sought them, and no one saw them. Health and exercise
had preserved the fair proportions of her form; no evil thought had
stamped its impress on the pure outline of her features; no fretting,

no repressed and baﬂied faculties, had left their Wearing marks on
her beautiful face.
Good women age slowly, as great painters discovered when
painting bereaved Madonnas. Women whose lives are full and
whose faculties are fully employed also age slowly. Lilian’s life had
by no means been sterile. She had had her mother, whose life her
cares had prolonged, to nurse; her young brother and sister to
bring up; her father and her home to care for; the whole village,
and all the-invalids and ne’er-do-wells for miles round, to cherish
and advise and heal.
With an intellect less showy, but stronger and steadier than the
dean’s, she had given him all that was best and most enduring in
his writings; no work of his had ever been passed through the
press without the beneﬁt of her revision; there were few things he
had ever done without her advice, in spite of the estrangement that
had arisen between them since the date of their common sorrow.
She had been with him in his bereavements, and had tended the
death-beds of his children and his wife; and she had been a mother
to Marion and the blind Everard, who both loved her next to their
father.
I And, deep as was the sorrow which had made her youth a lone-
liness, and blighted Everard’s hopes and her own in this long and
terrible punishment, it was the kind of sorrow that puriﬁes and
elevates: it was not like the physical suffering, the degradation, and
the wearing sense of wrong which Everard endured; it could‘ not
crush her energies, blunt her faculties, or stiﬂe her intellect. She
had not been obliged to repress the love so cruelly blighted; she
had lived for Everard all those years, and had been able to keep
alive hope, and even some kind of joy, in his breast. The sorrow
had come so suddenly, and fallen so irrevocably, that there had been
no wearing agony of suspense, no struggle of hopes and fears; the
trouble had to be met and coped with once for all, and through the
dim vista of those long years there had always gleamed the hope
that was fulﬁlled in the present moment.
Everard gazed in rapt admiration on the gloriﬁed ﬁgure in the
’ sunshine, and upon the well-remembered adored hand that was so
like a spirit in its pure and slender beauty, and did not dream of
helping her, it was so long since he had known the courtesies of life.
She had only raised the center blind of the bay; she now turned to
the side blinds, and drew them up with the same light and strong

sweep of her well-molded arm, and Everard now observed that she
was in an evening dress of some light-hued and soft fabric, and wore
a bunch of fresh roses at her neck ; she was in festal array to receive
him. The golden glory changed even as she stood, it blushed a sud-
den crimson, and died away into purest rose; the sun set, and only
the faint and changing after-glow remained.
Lilian now turned and saw Everard clearly in the fading rose-
light, which vanished as she looked, and left only the hard, uncom-
promising light of a June evening behind. She saw the wistful
eyes deep-sunken in the wasted face, the gray hair, the bowed form,
and the worn and haggard features, with their sublime expression
of heroic suffering, and a sharp, plaintive cry broke from her.
“Henry! my poor, poor Henry! What have they done to
you? ” she cried, hastening to his side.
He rose to meet her, and clasped the beautiful slim hands in
his own gloved ones, and looked down into her tear-clouded eyes.
“I warned you what a wreck you would see,” he replied. “Ah,
Lilian! this is not the man you loved.”
“Dearest, you must be happy now; you must forget all the
trouble and pain,” continued Lilian, who was crying for very pity
over him. “Ah, Henry! if love could heal you, you would soon
be healed.”
Henry could only fold her silently to his heart, feeling that he
was indeed healed already.
Soon Mr. Maitlaud appeared, his silver hair now snow-white,
and his voice fainter than of old. He was much shocked at the
change in Henry at ﬁrst sight of him ; but he recovered quickly, and
welcomed him cordially in the exquisite Maitland manner. His ﬁrst
full conviction of Everard’s guilt had gradually disappeared, whether
under the inﬂuence of Lilian’s long unsWerving faith, or of the tone
of Henry’s letters, which had of late often been quoted to him, or
through the softening which old age brings, and which disposes to
increasing lenience of judgment, it is diﬁicult to say. He now asked
his forgiveness for his former want of faith in him.
“Dear fellow,” he said, “ I yield Lilian willingly to you, hard as
it is to lose her. But you have the better claim, and you have
waited long; my poor children, you have waited too long,” he
added, his eyes growing dim as they fell on Everard‘s gray
hairs.
He would not hear of Everard’s leaving the house that night,

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN M A I TLAND. 319
but sent at once for his portmanteau, and told him that his room
had been waiting for him for days.
“I should rather say your rooms,” he explained, “since Lilian
could not decide whether you would prefer your own old room, or
one less familiar, and thus had two arranged. But why do you
keep your gloves on? You were wont to despise gloves in the old
days.”
“Can you not guess?” asked Everard. “Did you ever see a
masou‘s hands? ”
“Shall it be the old room?” asked Lilian, while her father
turned away, more moved at the thought of the roughened hands
than he had thought it possible to be, and remembering Everard’s
intellectual gifts, and the rich promise of his early manhood.
Everard‘s had been the ideal surgeon’s hand—strong, supple,
smooth, and with sensitive ﬁnger-tips, and this skillful and scientiﬁc
instrument had been blunted and maimed by rough mechanic labor
through all the best years of his life, while many a suﬁerer had
lacked its healing touch, and writhed under the clumsier strength of
less delicate ﬁngers.
“Alas, Henry!” he exclaimed, after a pause; “I trust I may
never know the man who let you suﬁer in his stead. I could not
forgive him.”
A faint shudder passed over Lilian at these words, and she di-
rected Henry’s attention to a cushioned chair by the hearth, on
which lay a round, black something, which proved on inspection to
be Mark Antony, the cat, sleeping the sleep of the just,'and snoring
blissfully. -
“Dear old Mark! ” said Henry, stroking the velvet fur; “what,
alive still? ”
“He has retired from active service,” observed Mr. Mait-
land, “and devotes himself to a life of contemplation—lazy old
Mark! "
“He is the apple of our eyes,” laughed Lilian, lifting him up,
and letting him stretch his soft limbs and yawn blissfully. “I love
the creature as if he were human; he has been my companion and
comfort so long.”
Mr. Maitland observed that, like many other gentlemen, Mark
had taken to religion in his later years, and was now a regular
church-goer. Every Sunday morning he was in the habit of trot~
ting after his master to the vestry, where he had a cushion in a.

sunny window-sill, and was respectfully treated by the clerk and
the choristers.
These trivial anecdotes, which served to ﬁll an awkward silence,
presently included Cyril. .
“We are very proud of ‘my son the dean,’ Henry, you must
know; our Chrysostom, our golden-mouth. You must hear him
preach some day,” Mr. Maitland said ﬁnally.
“Poor Cyril! ” sighed Everard. “ I stopped at Belminster
on my way down, and heard him preach. A very ﬁne preacher,
with a singular gift. I do not wonder that you are proud of
him.”
“ You saw Cyril? ” asked Lilian, with a startled air.
“He does not often preach,” continued Mr. Maitland. “ The
fact is, his nerves can not stand the excitement; he throws himself
too unrestrainedly into it, and it makes him ill.”
“He was ill that night. Yes, I saw that he was completely
carried away. He is inspired; he is obliged to speak as he is
moved. He said what he never dreamed of saying before he be-
gen.”
“Our dear Chrysostom l ” murmured the proud father. “ Yes,
Henry, the ﬁre descends upon him; he has the true gift. Have you
heard that he is to be Bishop of Warham? ”
“Poor Cyril l ” said Henry and Lilian simultaneously; and
neither asked the other why he was to be pitied.
But Lilian seemed anxious to avoid the topic, and, saying that
the supper-hour was already past, led the way into the diningroom,
with the great cat.
“Puss gives me such a sense of home as I can not express,“ said
Henry, fondly stroking his unresponsive form.
“We think his purr acquires mellowness with years,” laughed
Lilian. “Henry, do you still like chicken and oysters and cherry-
tart? Because I have dreamed for years of giving them to you on
such an occasion as this.”
“And this pale port? ” added Mr. Maitland, pointing to a cob-
webbed bottle lying on a. rack. “ You and Cyril laid it down for
me. It was drunk at his ordination, his wedding, his eldest son’s
christening, and his installation as dean. This was kept for your
return, and there is still a bottle for the bishop‘s enthronement.”
“They did not give us very old port or young chicken at Dart —”
Henry began, and stopped seeing Lilian glance at the waiting-maid.

He ﬂushed, but was too serenely happy for any morbid regrets, and
listened happily to his host’s apology for the absence of dinner,
which was now only a midday repast, owing to the declining health
of his old age.
Lilian’s remembrance of his old liking touched him as only such
little things can touch, and the meal with the old port had almost a
sacramental character for him. The sparkle of the silver and glass,
the ordinary graces of a gentleman’s table, to which he had so long
been a stranger, were beyond measure delightful to him, and he
saw by many little indications that the fresh ﬂowers and the fruit
and the very service had received the graceful touch of Lilian’s own
hands to welcome him.
His last free meal had been at that board and in that beloved
presence. Since then, save for the few solitary repasts he had
taken in hotels, he had broken the bread of captivity moistened
with tears, and had learned almost to forget the simple courtesies
of life. It was a pleasure to drink from bright engraved glass, to
handle silver and fresh linen, to hear the kindly voice of his host, to
observe the quiet, gliding motions of the well-trained maid, to see
the soft glow of the lamp; much more to feel the beloved presence,
to meet the glance of Lilian’s olear eyes and hear the pure tones of
her voice. It was like heaven, he said, when they parted for the
night.
CHAPTER VII.
Tna next day was Sunday, and Everard, like one in a blissful
dream, went to the church so full of youthful associations, and saw
many of the faces familiar to his youth, yet unfamiliar now because
of the metamorphoses of time, and missed many, swept away, for
the most part, into the silence which awaits us all, and thought of
the winter Sunday eighteen years gone, when Cyril preached his
strange passionate sermon on innocence. He thought, too, of the
sermon in the cathedral, and the terrible anguish on the guilty
man's face, the canker that had been eating into his heart through
all those years. He was glad to think that Marion was at rest.
Upon the wall, opposite the Rectory pew, he saw a marble tab-
let, on which he read the following sorrowful inscription:

“0 spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence,
and be no more seen.”
A vision of the little band of children ﬂoated with pathetic grace
before Everard’s eyes, and he thought what pangs must have rent
their parents’ hearts when the earth closed over each bright little
face; nor did he greatly wonder that Marion’s fragile existence had
been crushed by such sorrow. The boy who had given him the bon- _
bans and played at convicts headed the mournful list, a pretty, sturdy
little fellow, whose name and features he remembered well. His
heart bled for Cyril, and yet he thought, and wondered, did Lilian
think too, as she sat by his side, of another little group of child- ,
faces—of other Cyrils and Liliane and Ernests, of the very same
blood as those dead babes, who might have clustered around their
hearth but for that stricken father’s sin? He thought also of yet
another child, outcast and disowned, who might be wandering now
in lonely manhood somewhere on the earth’s wide bosom.
Lilian had told him of the sad manner in which Cyril’s twins
were lost. They were at play on the steps of a bathing-machine,
drawn up by a rope on a sloping shore, when the line parted, and
the machine ran down into the sea, Oyril running after it with all
his speed, and suﬁ’ering the cruel anguish of seeing the children
spring toward him only to fall into the sea, where the rollers at
once swept them away from his sight for ever. Ilis wild effort to
save them had thus caused their death.

THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND. 323
Marion felt it less than Oyril, who was an unusually affectionate
father, Lilian said. Indeed, Marion had been strangely apathetic
of late years. ‘Her marriage was not a happy one. She could not
understand her husband, she confessed to Lilian in her last hours;
he was kind, and even tender, towards her, but she was afraid of
_ him, and grew more afraid as years went on. There was something
——she knew not what—between them, and Cyril’s strange and ter-
rible melancholy was enough to depress a stronger nature than
hers.
“ I have sometimes thought,” commented Lilian, “that Marion’s
continual bereavements and fragile health may have unhinged her
mind; there was certainly something morbid in the way in which
she thought of Cyril.” There was a wistful appeal in Lilian’s voice
as she said this, and an expression in the eyes which she lifted to
Everard’s that made him shiver inwardly.
“I think,” he replied gently, “ that their characters were un-
suited to each other. Oyril needed a wife of stronger intellect, and
Marion 3 man of less complex character, whom she could have
understood and appreciated. You know, I always said that her
health would give way under unhappiness: she needed the gentlest
cherishing. And she is at rest now, Lilian. and it is well with her,”
he added, with a faint tremble in his voice. “I urged the mar-
riage because I knew that the disappointment would kill her.”
They'were sitting in the bay of the drawing-room window
during this conversation, the bells were dropping their slow chime,
laden with memories, into Everard’s heart and ears, and people
were walking churchward in little groups through the lane at the
bottom of the garden. Then the drawing-room door opened sud-
denly, and, with a rustle of silk and a glOw of ﬁne raiment, a most
beautiful young lady entered unannounced, and embraced Everard
in a rapturous manner, calling him her dear Henry, and saying how
delighted she was to see him again, and how she should have known
him anywhere.
“This is very agreeable,” he replied, recovering himself, “but
rather embarrassing.”
“But don’t you know me, Henry? ” she cried.
“Have you forgotten Winnie? " asked Lilian.
“And here is my husband. Surely you remember him 'l’ ” said
Winnie, turning to Sir Ingram Swaynestone, who had followed her
in, with a fair-haired child in his hand, and who was a much more

portly and imposing personage than he had been eighteen years
ago.
Ingram thought that the homicide, by whomsoever committed,
had at least been unintentional. He could not refuse this meeting
without paining the sisters, which he was too good-natured to do.
He therefore tried to make the best of it.
“I am inclined to believe that there was some mistake in that
business of poor Lee’s,” he said, after greeting Henry, “though it
is hard to doubt the evidence of one’s senses. I hope, Dr. Everard,
we shall be able to forget the parts we had to play then.” '
“I hope so,” replied Everard, feeling that Swaynestone could
not meet him without some such concession, but seeing very plainly
that he did not doubt the evidence of his senses. ,
“ This is our daughter Lilian,” Sir Ingram added, thus ending a
rather embarrassing pause, bidding the child go and shake hands,
which she stoutly refused to do.
“Naughty little thingl Her father spoils her shamefully,” said
Winnie; “simply for the sake of her name, I believe. But little
girls who won’t shake hands with gentlemen will never be like
Aunt Lilian,” she added severely.
“And where is Lionel?” asked Lilian, taking the child on her
knee. “Is he not going to church ? ”
“Master Lionel was not in a devout frame of mind this morn-
ing,” replied his father. “ When requested to indue his go-to-
meeting clothes, he threw himself on the ground and roared with
the vigor of ten boys, so, of course, he had his way. Can you
imagine who spoils Lion, Aunt Lilian 2 ”
“Poor darling! ” said Lady Swaynestone; “I am sure he is not
well. His nervous system is so quickly upset.”
“Me don’t like him hands,” observed little Lilian at this junct-
ure, pointing to Henry’s hands; but, with the waywardness of her
age,’she was struck at the same moment by the expression of his '
face, and climbed on his knee with the utmost conﬁdence.
“ By the way, we had a letter from the Very Reverend yester-
day,” said Winnie. “He wrote very hurriedly in answer to a busi-
ness letter of Ingram’s, but he said that Lennie’s ship is coming
home with the squadron; also that the rumor of his engagement to
that girl at Malta is well founded, so we suppose there will be a
Mrs. Lennie before long."
“Father and I have long been prepared to receive the girl at

Malta,” Lilian said; and she opened an album, and showed Everard
the photograph of a ﬁne young naval oﬂicer, whom he recognized
as his old playfellow Lennie.
They were setting off for the church, when a lady, dressed in a
conventual garb, entered the gate and came to meet them.
, “I am quite disappointed,” she said, with a smile that brought
back old times to Everard; “I wanted to be the ﬁrst to meet Dr.
Everard, and welcome him. I see that you have forgotten Ethel
Swaynestone, Dr. Everard."
“I was not prepared for the dress,” replied Everard, wondering
at the bright ﬂush which overspread her thin, delicate face; for he
did not dream that the romance of her life owned him as her central
ﬁgure.
“Dr. Everard has not yet seen the hospital, Ethel,” said Lilian;
and then it was explained to him that Lilian had caused two cot--
tages to be built, one for convalescents and one for sick poor people,
and had placed them under the charge of Miss Swaynestone’s sister-
hood, a sister from which always lived there, and, with help from
Lilian, nursed the parish sick in their own homes or at the cot—
tages.
“The question is, what does Lilian not do?” commented Sir
Ingram. “She scolds all the drunkards and scamps; she arranges
all the matrimonial squabbles—Winnie and I dare not for the life
of us have a comfortable wrangle together; she exhorts the naughty
children; she makes up the quarrels of sweethearts; she makes
people’s wills for them; she keeps an asylum for aged and useless
beasts of every description; she engages servants that nobody else
can put up with, and turns them out marvels of perfection; she en-
tertains dipsomaniacs and other bad characters at the Rectory, and
sends them back candidates for canonization; she tames unruly ani-
mals for miles round. and heals sick ones; nobody ever dreams of

- body at large. And, to crown all, she insists on marrying a ticket-

It was delicious to Everard to go through the old Sunday rou-
tine again, and think that this simple, quiet, wholesome life had
been going on all through those weary prison years. There was
Mr. Marvyn, the curate, who had instructed his youth, preaching
the old familiar sermons, with their scraps of learning and diiiicult

theological and ethical problems, which ﬂew so far over the heads
of the slumbering congregation:k there was the harmonium, a little
touched with asthma, and played, as of yore, by Mrs. Wax, who,
with her husband, had survived all the changes, and gallantly faced
all the requirements of new education codes; there were the whole
clan of Hales and Straun, and the discontented tailor, whose dis-
content was now silvered by the dignity of hoar hairs, and William
Grove, and his mate J em.
Job Stubbs, the chorister whose levity had been publicly re-
buked by his pastor, now sat among the basses, and thundered out
deep chest-notes from beneath his white surplice, himself the
parent of light-hearted boys and girls; Dicky Stevens, also a hus-
band and father, sat near him as of old, but led the tenors instead
of the trebles, and sent his naughty boys to be tamed by the hand
which had redeemed his own youth from the tyranny of the stick.
In the afternoon Mr. Maitland preached in the sweet, paternal,
simple strain that had so impressed Everard’s youth, with the
beautiful Maitland voice and manner, and the pure diction he had
loved.
It was easy to see whence the dean’s great powers were de
rived; it was impossible not to think that talents as great, nay,
perhaps in some respects greater, than his were buried in this hum-
ble little village. llis son’s sudden ﬂights of inspiration were in-
deed wanting in the village priest’s quiet eloquence, but his ser-
mons had something that was lacking in the dean’s—namely, the V
steady glow of a fervid and unaffected piety, which only aimed at
making his hearers better men and women, and thought not of am
bition and self. Nuns Dimittis was the good old gentleman’s
theme, and it ﬁlled Everard’s heart with a beautiful peace. He did
not know how appropriate it was to the occasion, since he did not
dream that these were the last words the gentle priest was to say
to his ﬂock; nor did he dream that the sermon which he knew,
Cyril was then preaching before so different an audience in Bel-
minster Cathedral was to be the last of the brilliant and soul-
searching orations which had won him so lustrous a name.
“My children,” said Mr. Maitland, in conclusion, “I beseech
you to keep innocency; for that, and that alone, shall bring a man
peace at the last.” Strange echo of his son's ﬁrst sermon in that
church!
It had been whispered about that the broken, wistful-eyed man

sitting in the Rectory pew was no other than the too-notorious Dr.
Everard, whose trial and sentence were still so fresh in the village
memory. Searching glances were directed upon him during after-
noon sermon, and many eyes recognized the features of the hand-
some and hopeful young doctor under his wan and changed aspect,
so that, when Everard came forth into the afternoon sunshine, he
was surprised to see a little lane formed about the churchyard
path, and to ﬁnd himself accosted by name. There had from the
ﬁrst been a faction in the village convinced of Everard’s innocence.
It was the head of this faction who now spoke.
“Glad to see you back, sir,” blurted out Straun, with a perspir-
ing effort, as he took off his hat and held out his great hand. “ We
knowed you never done it.”
“ Ay, we knowed you never done it,” chimed in William Grove,
and some others, advancing also with outstretched hand. “Gran-
fer, he knowed you never done it; and this here is Granfer’s tomb-
stone,” added the shepherd who had seen Everard on his road to
Widow Dove’s on the fatal afternoon, bringing his hard hand down
on the stone as if its existence were a solid proof of Granfer’s
valuable opinion on the subject.
“And Widow Dove,” said Tom Hale, the old soldier, “as her
daughter married my wife’s brother, as set up in the hardware line
at Oldport, it lay on her conscience when she come to die, as she
never said nothing about her ﬁre being out that afternoon, and no
candle, and the door shut, when you came up and thought the
house empty. Many’s the time she’ve spoke of that to my wife on
her dying bed, as helped nurse her, and had it wrote in the family
Bible.”
“And my little gal, she minds now how you give her the penny
that night,” added William Grove, pushing forward a bashful,
buxom young woman, with a child in her arms, who curtseyed and
blushed. “ Growed up she is, and made a graufer of me, zure
enough,” her father added.
Everard could scarcely speak; he could only grasp each prof-
fered hand and murmur some vague words of thanks, but his heart
was deeply stirred as he passed along the lane of kindly, hearty
faces, and went out into the road, where he found Farmer Long
and his family, who were waiting to welcome him and express
their sorrow at the unmerited calamity which had befallen him.
This little outburst on the part of the stolid, undemonstrative

rustics was so unexpected, and so strong a proof of the feeling
with which his innocence was regarded by some of his old friends,
though not, as he well knew, by all, that it almost overpowered
him, and he was glad to take refuge within the Rectory gate. On
turning to shut it, he saw his friends still standing in the afternoon
sunlight, with their hats off till he should have vanished from their
sight, and he again removed his own.
He sat with Mr. Maitland and Lilian under the thick-leaved
lime-tree, silent and happy, watching the shadows turn soft and
slant, and the swallows dart across the sunny blue, while the father
and daughter told him many things that had come to pass in his
absence, and tea was brought out; and, ﬁnally, Mr. Maitland sank
into the peaceful slumber which usually followed his Sunday
labors. Then Lilian took the cat in her arms, and walked toward
the ﬁeld to visit her invalid animals.
“ Why do you carry that great creature? ” asked Everard. “ Let
me take him for you.” '
“As if Mark would suffer any one else to carry him i ” laughed
Lilian, as the cat; with an indignant look at Everard, clasped his
fore paws round her neck, and rubbed his head against her cheek.
“ You can not imagine how I love the thing, Henry; he is a link
with the past. Do you remember the day we found him, a stray,
half-starved kitten, up by Temple Copse? It was the Christmas
vacation, and you and I and Cyril were talking about his chance of
taking honors. How happy we were! ”
“It was a frosty day,” continued Everard, musingly, “and the
kitten was numb with cold till you warmed it in your furs. Its
bones were staring through its skin.”
“And it has loved me ever since—me and Cyril only. Mark
never forgets Cyril, but runs to him still,” said Lilian, stroking the
warm soft fur. “Only once did Mark make a mistake—on that
fatal evening when he ran after the gray ﬁgure in the dusk, else he
never ran after any human being but myself and Cyril. Was it not
strange, Henry '4’ ” she added, ﬁnding that he made no comment.
“The whole occurrence was strange, dearest, and better forgot-
ten,” he replied evasively. '
“Do you think it was an optical delusion? ” she persisted, after
some trivial and irrelevant remarks on the part of Everard, who
wished to change the subject.
“No doubt it was; perhaps a light was reﬂected from some

quarter by the opening of a door. Who knows? One is often
deceived in the twilight, when everything is more or less ghostly.
That old beech still stands. It will be down some stormy night.”
“ Cats are not deceived by the twilight,” continued Lilian, with
a tremor in her voice; “ they see better in the dusk. Oh, Henry,”
she added, with a stiﬂed cry, “there was but. one the cat ever fol-
lowed! ” _
She was trembling, and for the moment Everard paused with a
blanched cheek, unable to say anything.
“ You have brooded too long over this,” he said at last, with a
lame eﬂ'ort at lightness, “and your imagination creates bugbears
from it. The cat probably saw or smelt a mouse, and ran after
that. Or he may have been merely frisking about, as cats do, in
the dusk. Think no more of it, Lilian. Let us bury that troubled
past for ever.”
“It is not possible, Henry,” she replied, still trembling. “ Things
that are branded into one can never be forgotten. Dear Henry,
tell me one thing. Do you know who did that dreadful thing for
which you suffered? "
“How should I know? ” he returned, in a hard voice that he
could not control. “I do not think it will be known, Lilian, till
the day when all things are revealed. There is an impenetrable
mystery about it. Let it remain. Why lift the veil? ”
Lilian gazed earnestly upon his troubled and averted face, and
then said, in low, thrilling tones, “Henry, you know who killed
Benjamin Lee, and you know that the man who did it wore your
clothes and passed up the staircase in the dusk that night.”
Everard’s heart stood still, and his temples throbbed. “Dear,”
he replied, “I do know who killed that poor man, but I do not
wish to reveal it. I have known it for eighteen years, and have
seen no cause for revealing it. Such knowledge would beneﬁt no
human being; it would inﬂict terrible suffering on some. Do not
tempt me to break my silence, Lilian ; it is a point of honor.”
Lilian had dropped the cat on the grass, and was leaning against
the light iron fence of the paddock. She now turned, and, clasp-
ing Everard’s arm with convulsive force, looked imploringly in his
face.
“Tell me,” she cried, "‘tell me that it is not so—that I am mis-
taken; that it was a bad dream—an evil fancy! Say, oh, Henry, if
you love me, say it was not he! ”

She was sobbing now, and quivering all over in unspeakable
agitation-she who was so calm and self-controlled usually. Henry
drew her to him, and strove by caresses and words of love to soothe
her, but was himself far too much agitated to be able to deceive her.
“ Oh! ” she cried, “I can not, can not bear it! My Cyril!
my own brother! my poor, peer Cyril! I understand it all now.”
“You know, dearest,” said Everard at last, with grave, compas-
sionate tenderness, “that nothing can happen without the will of
God.”
Lilian’s sobs became quieter at these words, and after a time
they ceased, and she lifted her head and looked back at the lime-
tree, beneath the shade of which they could see the white head of
her sleeping father.
“There is one,” said Henry, pointing to him, “ who must never
suspect.”
“He never shall,” replied Lilian, striving to regain her habitual
self-command. “But oh, my poor, poor boy! Such awful hypoc-
risy. I would not suspect for a long time; it seemed like a tempta-
tion of the evil one. Not until Marion‘s death. I think she was
afraid to let herself think. But she told me so much when she was
dying. And Cyril—ah, Henry, he was always weak! But a traitor!
oh, it seems incredible! Ah, what a dark and terrible mystery our
nature is! And he let you suﬁer, you who loved him so! Oh, my
Henry! ” '
“ You know, Lilian,” repeated Everard, in unutterable love and
pity, “it was permitted by the Divine Will.” And the words again
had a quieting effect upon Lilian, who had now regained her serene
charm of face and manner, inwardly torn as she was.
“And you saw him i ” she asked. “ How could he meet you?
What could he say? Oh, how can he have lived this lie, and borne
this awful burden all these years? ”
“His burden was heavier than mine,” Everard said; and then
he described their meeting in the cathedral, Cyril’s passionate ser—
mon, his terrible agitation on recognizing him among the crowded
congregation, and his own letter of forgiveness to the unhappy man.
But they each wondered that he had not yet answered the letter.
“Doubtless there will be an answer to-morrow,” said Everard.
“And I must go to him and tell him that I know and pity all,”
said Lilian. “ Yes, there will be an answer to-morrow.”
But the answer never came.

CHAPTER VIII.
IT was said that the pope, on being asked once if he knew any-
thing of the Church of England, replied that he thought he remem-
bered having heard something about an eloquent dean in that com-
munion, named Maitland. Others told the story differently, and
averred that it was Bishop Oliver who had conferred such luster on
the national Church.
The bishop himself, on being asked whom he considered the ﬁrst
preacher in the Church, had replied that Dean Maitland was undoubt-
edly the second, his interrogator divining, from a shrewd twinkle
in the episcopal eye, that there would be a lack of delicacy in
pressing him to name the ﬁrst. The same querist, on putting a simi-
lar question to the dean, had been met by a genial smile, and the
candid but laughing avowal that he had never heard any one com-
pared to himself, unless it was the bishop; for the dean’s ingenu-
ous, almost'childlike, candor was not one of the least of his social
charms. V
The two ecclesiastics were rivals not only in the pulpit, but in
the world. Both were favorites at Court and in general society;
but the bishop lacked the personal beauty and grace of the dean,
and, though a good talker and clever raconteur, and possessed of a
fund of genuine humor, he had not the dean’s bright, swift wit or
his light and playful touch in conversation: his mirth, like his in-
tellect, was elephantine in comparison with the pard-like graceful-
ness of the dean’s. Nor did the bishop possess that rare and mag-
netic power of attracting and subjugating people’s hearts peculiar
to Cyril Maitland, and given to a few choice spirits destined to rule
men. ~
His features were square, massive, and expressive of solid intel-
lect, unvisited by the lightning ﬂashes of emotion and thought
which gave new beauty to the dean’s beautiful face. Bishop Oliver
was past middle age, and looked as if he had never been young,
while the dean looked as if he could never be old. He was a good
man, though human. In all the farthest recesses of his memory
there was nothing he feared to look at; there was no spiritual trag-
edy in his life; he was unacquainted with the depths of human
agony. Thus his sermons, though possessing a more level and sus-
tained excellence than the dean’s, though showing greater intellect

and learning, had inﬁnitely less power to touch men‘s heart’s; nor
was he ever carried away beyond the limits of his will, and thus
enabled to carry others away, as the dean was. People did not ﬂy
to him for spiritual help, as they did to the dean, for he did not
possess his absolute sympathy with the sinful; their lives and ex-
periences diﬁ‘ered so widely from his own spotless career that he
could not but regard them as aliens, strive as he would to call them
brothers.
But there was something in Dean Maitland’s way of regarding
sin and sinners which opened the darkest recesses of people’s hearts
to him, and *men had not feared to pour into his sympathizing ear
things which it froze the blood to hear. Very tender was the heal-
ing hand he laid upon sick souls—tender but ﬁrm. No one knew
better than he the remedies which alone can heal such deadly mala-
dies, although, like many physicians of the body, he had not the
strength of will to apply his prescriptions to his own case. Of this
he was sometimes conscious, as was seen in his last sermon to can-
didates for ordination, when he had taken for text, “Lest I myself,
when I have preached to others, should become a castaway.”
Never for amomeut let it be thought that sin is in any way
necessary or good or helpful, anything but vile and injurious in itself
or in its far-reaching consequences; yet it is an undoubted fact that
in some natures a heavy fall leads to a higher spiritual development.
Good is stronger than evil, and the eternal purpose which rules in
all things, and against which nothing human can prevail, often ap-
pears to bring the brightest light from the thickest darkness. Thus
this man’s black iniquity was made an instrument of healing to
others.
The bishop’s detractors accused him of worldliness and ambition,
and said that he misapplied St. Paul’s injunction, to be all things to
all men, and was too good a courtier to be a good Christian.
It must be confessed that the bishop, being human as well as
Christian, did greatly love the esteem of men, and particularly of
princes, and in his heart of hearts felt it hard that he and the dean
should have their lines cast in the same place, expressly, as it seemed
to him, that the luster of his own renown might be dimmed by the
greater brilliance of his rival’s. They were, however, the best of
friends—for even the bishop was subjugated by the irresistible
charm of his rival‘s manner whenever he came into personal contact
with him—and had been heard to observe, after one of these slight

THE SILEN E OF DEAN MAITLAND. 333
diﬁerences of opinion that must sometimes arise between the bishop
and the dean, that it was pleasanter to be at war with Dean Mait-
land than at peace with the majority of mankind. Yet it was said
of Bishop Oliver that he managed never to be at war with mortal
man, Jew or papist, churchman or dissenter, atheist or fanatic.
The dean’s preferment to the see of Warham was at once a rose
and a thorn to the bishop, a rose, because it would remove his rival
to such a distance that he would no longer daily overshadow him;
a thorn, because the see of Warham was of greater dignity and
emolument than that of Belminster. Thus he regarded it with
mixed feelings, and had been heard to say that frbm the deanery
of Belminster to the episcopal throne of Warham was a singularly
sudden leap.
Not that Bishop Oliver for a moment accused himself of so
mean a thing as jealousy; be imagined himself to be actuated solely
by deep solicitude for the weal of Church and State, which he
sincerely thought himself better calculated to serve than the dean.
But when, on the Sunday following the dean’s illness in the pulpit,
the bishop was sitting tranquilly at luncheon, he was greatly dis-
composed by an observation from one of his young people, to the
eﬁ‘ect that the premier was coming down to Belminster that very
afternoon for the express purpose, it was said, though this was not
the case, since the minister chanced to be passing a Sunday at Dew-
hurst Castle, of hearing the bishop designate preach.
“Nonsense, my dear Mabel! ” he said. “Ministers have some-
thing better to do than to be running about after popular preachers,
particularly while Parliament is in session.”
A young clergyman present passed his napkin before his face
to conceal an irrepressible smile, and remembered how differently
the bishop had spoken of people who came to hear him preach.
“Well, my dear father, I can only regret the levity of Mr. Chad-
well‘s disposition," returned Mabel, “for he certainly telegraphed
last night to know if the dean was to preach this afternoon.”
“I thought,” returned the bishop, “that his recovery was sin-
gularly rapid. He was very ill on Friday. It is a great pity that
he should excite himself so much; he will kill himself one of these
days. And that kind of sermon does no permanent good.”
“ By the way, sir,” said a son, “ there is a queer story about the
dean. Some woman who died at the hospital last week accused
him of all manner of goings on with her last breath, I hear.”

“Tittle-tattle, Herbert; nothing more. Local celebrities are
always the centers of scandalous report.”
“The ﬁerce light that beats upon a deanery,” laughed the
young fellow. “Well, these were strange doings for a dean, I
must say.”
The bishop adroitly started a fresh topic, but he could not help
reﬂecting in his heart of hearts that the doings attributed to the
dean by the half-uttered, half-suppressed rumors he knew to be
ﬂying about were indeed remarkably strange. For Alma‘s dying
statement had not been made .in private; the dean’s delay and her
own extremity had rendered her desperate, and her one desire was
that the injustice done Everard should be known. He could not
help reﬂecting, moreover, that there was probably some foundation
for the rumors, however slight, and he felt that he should not be
struck dumb with surprise if he learned that the brilliant and hand-
some ecclesiastic had sown a few wild oats in his hot youth, and
bitterly repented the harvest such sowing always entails. He had
often wondered at the power and passion with which he depicted
feelings of remorse; yet he was destined to be greatly surprised
that afternoon.
The cathedral was crowded. People sat on the choir steps and
ﬁlled the nave to the farthest limits of hearing; chairs were placed
north and south of the choir; the choir itself was as full as its
stately decorum permitted. The well-known face of the premier
was seen among the worshipers. This gentleman intended calling
at the Deanery after the service, and had sent an intimation to that
effect.
The dean smiled rather grimly when he heard who was to be
his guest that afternoon, and speedin quieted the agitation into
which Miss Mackenzie was always thrown at the prospect of visits
from people of distinction. “You need not get out the best china,”
he said, with his old playful way of alluding to stock jests; “I
promise you that the minister will not come.”
He was going to the cathedral, manuscript in hand, as he spoke.
He turned back again, and met Miss Mackenzie descending the
stairs, dressed ready for the cathedral, and she observed that he
was paler than ever, and grave as he had been since his seizure on
the Friday night.
“Dear Miss Mackenzie,” he said, in his sweetest way, “I have
a little favor to ask you.” ‘


## p. 335 (#341) ############################################

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 335
He paused, and Miss Mackenzie began, “ Oh, Mr. Dean, any-
thing I can do—” for she, like everybody else, felt that the dean
conferred a favor in asking one.
“You have been a good friend,” he continued, “ and I owe
much of the peace and comfort of my home to you.”
“ And what do I not owe to you t ” she replied, with enthusiasm.
“How happy I have been here! ”
“I hope, indeed, that you have been happy under my roof,” he
went on. “I should be grieved if it were otherwise, for I am not
all bad. I only want you, Miss Mackenzie, to do me the slight
favor of staying at home this afternoon.”
-Then he turned and went, leaving the gentlewoman rooted to
the ground with surprise until he reached the door, when he again
turned and wished her good-by in a voice that she never for-
get. Reﬂecting on this little incident afterward, she regarded it
as a strong proof of the solid friendship which existed between
them, and enjoyed many a comfortable cry over it in subsequent
years.
The organ was rolling great waves of sorrowful music about the
vaulted roof of the cathedral. Dr. Rydal, the organist, being
plunged in one of those ﬁts of profound melancholy to which the
artistic temperament is liable. Such a gloom had not brooded over
him for years, and all his efforts to shake it off and modulate his
mournful cadences into more joyous harmonies were vain; so at
last he gave rein to it, and passed out of one minor key into an-
other, until he glided ﬁnally into the passionate pleading of Men-
delssohn’s “O Lord, have mercy, and blot out my transgression,”
from the St. Paul, and the choir paced in with even step, a long
procession of white robes, closed by the dean’s scarlet hood and
the bishop’s lawn.
People noticed the dean’s worn face and his look of utter weari-
ness, particularly when he stood up to read the First Lesson, which
chanced to contain the pathetic story of the death of Absalom, and
never, they thought, was the pathos of that divine narrative, the
stumbling’block and the despair of most readers, more truly and
beautifully rendered. His magniﬁcent voice never for a. moment
escaped his control, but pealed steadily on, giving due weight and
meaning to every syllable, and throwing the full measure of the
stricken and penitent father’s anguish into the heart-rending words,
“0 my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had

336 THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND.
died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! "—words so nobly sim-
ple in their unutterable sorrow.
Many eyes were wet when the dean ended his reading, and most
of those who were listening remembered of how many Absaloms
he had been bereaved; but they did not dream how close the
parallel was between him and the crowned monrner of Israel,
who knewsthat his own sin had wrought him these terrible
woes.
He had not observed the immense concourse of people; his eyes
had been bent on the ground, his soul had been too conscious of
awful presences, too occupied by eternal realities, to be disturbed
by anything human when he entered the holy building. But, when
he ﬁnished reading and was turning from the lectern, the force of
old habit was so strong upon him that he lifted his head, and with
one lightning glance swept all the crowded spaces of the vast
building, and encountered the multitudinous gaze of the great sea
of faces.
He saw the premier, the familiar ﬁgures of the dwellers in the
close, and the people from the city and its environs, the fashion of
Belminster and its commerce, working people and idlers, the known ‘
and the unknown, the choir and the clergy, the bishop and the
quaintly clad almsmen; and, quite near him, Lady Louisa, with
Lord Arthur and the duke and duchess, who had driven through
the hot sun all the way from the castle with their distinguished
guest for the express purpose of hearing the famed eloquence of
the bishop-elect.
He thought that all that multitude must soon know his shame,
they who honored him and hung waiting upon his words, and the
thousand eyes bent upon him, more or less full of the deep
thoughts stirred by the divine narrative he had just read so per~
feetly, seemed like so many points of ﬂame darting into the most
secret recesses of his son]; he turned sick, and longed for the pave-
ment beneath his feet to yawn and swallow him. What mortal
could bear that crushing weight of scorn? he wondered. The
mere anticipation of it stopped his breath and made his heart shud-
der with a piercing pain; it must certainly kill him.
He returned to his stall, against the dark carved work of which
his face showed like some beautiful Greek marble, quite as white
and still, and the organ pealed, and the voices of the full choir
blended in magniﬁcent billows of song, and the words of the

Magniﬁcat fell upon his unheeding ear, till a bass voice separated
itself from the others and thundered out, “ He hath put down the
mighty from their seat,” in tones which seemed to convey a special
menace to his troubled soul.
The great congregation seemed to melt away, and before his
eyes arose the face that had never left him since the moment when
he ﬁrst saw it, two nights ago—the worn and wasted face of his
betrayed friend, with its loyal gaze of heroic sadness “looking
ancient kindness” upon his self-accusing misery. Never, he
thought, while he lived, would the look of that face cease to
haunt him—never, perhaps, even through all the endless ages of
eternity. And not that face alone; others less kindly arose to
hunt his tortured soul with their glances.
Alma Lee, in all the luster of her fresh, unsullied beauty, as he
had seen her in her father’s house on the night when he rescued
her from the wagoner’s rudeness; Alma, with the startled self-
betrayal in her guileless, passionate glance; Alma, a little child,
sporting with him over the meadow, wreathed with chains of
ﬂowers or crowned with berry crowns; and Alma, ruined, with a
new and sinister splendor in her beauty, as she stood and swore
away the honor of his friend. The child eyes hurt him most;
“Give me back my innocence,” they said, in their dumb, sweet
appeal.
Then Ben Lee rose, with the ﬁerce passion in his livid face, and
the dreadful stain upon it: “Give me back my life, and the honor
of my child!” cried his angry, accusing glance. He saw the
estranged, terriﬁed look in Marion’s dying eyes. Ilis dead babes
came with strange reproach in their appealing glances, and asked
why they were only born to fade; and Lilian looked upon him
with her sweet and loving gaze, and asked dumbly for the lover of
her youth, and the children who were never born. “And Lilian
must know all,” he thought, with agony. But the look in the eyes
of the betrayed was present through all, and that look was like an
anchor to stay his shuddering soul upon.
I The voices of the choir rose upon the mighty pinions of the
anthem, and eased his heart somewhat of its sore burden. “Hide
thy face from my sins, and blot out all my misdeeds,” they sang in
strains that seemed to issue from the depths of broken hearts. The
sweet and sorrowful music sank into his soul with healing balm; a
pure-toned soprano repeated the phrase in soul-subduing melody,

and a solemn peace fell upon him in spite of all those visionary
glances turned so accusingly toward him.
And now it was time for him to ascend the pulpit, and he rose
from his stall with his accustomed air of quiet reverence, and walked
up the choir. As he went, his eye fell upon that symbol of sol-
emn humbug—efor he did not believe in it; he had worn it and ab-
stained from wine only for the sake of inﬂuence—~thc scrap of blue
ribbon which was attached to his surplice, and he took it off and
cast it on the pavement beneath his feet. He had done with all
fripperies and unrealities now; his soul stood at last, stripped of all
pretense, in the awful presence of his Maker.
Save that his face-was very pale, and there were purple shadows
about his month, there was nothing unusual in his manner as he
ascended the steps to the pulpit amid the rolling harmonies of the
hymn, in which the vast congregation joined, and looked round upon
the familiar spectacle of the multitude of faces. There he stood.
one sinful man in the presence of many sinful men, erring and weak
and weary, and all unworthy of the garb he wore, yet the ambas-
sador of high heaven, and charged with a divine message—a solitary
ﬁgure on an awful eminence.
It was a beautiful, an inspiring, and to him a familiar scene,
which offered itself to his gaze. Immediately beneath and around
him, shut in by the dark, rich cavity of the choir, were the white
robes of the choristers, interspersed with the bright silk hoods of
the clergy, and the gay and rich summer dresses of ladies, just
relieved by a sprinkling of black coats. All down the nave spread
a dark, dimly seen mass of human beings, varied by the glow of a ‘
soldier’s coat, or the brightness of a woman’s dress catching the
broad afternoon light, which, streaming through the great west
window, and falling in broken rays of many—colored glory here and
there, or entering through the clear aisle windows, shed a diffused
whiteness over all.
On either side the choir, aisle and transept presented the same
aspect of massed humanity; some long, dusty rods of golden light
fell athwart the shadowy choir, and turned a black oak crocket or
fretted pinnacle to gold; and from all that vast mass of standing
worshipers rose the mighty surge of a penitential hymn, and rolled
in solemn, far-spreading billows around the sinful man who stood a
witness between earth and heaven upon the solitary height.
But the dean’s steadfast, forward gaze saw nothing of the spec-

tacle before him, a spectacle so wont to inspirit him to his loftiest
ﬂights; he was not even conscious of those haunting, accusing
glances from the past: was conscious, for those few brief moments
in which he strove to nerve himself to an eﬂort beyond his strength,
of nothing but the presence of the Maker against whom he had
sinned, and saw only the sorrowful glance which has gazed from
the Gross all down the ages upon the deeds of sinful men. His soul
stood, stripped and shuddering with the shame of its uncovered sin,
in the searching light of the awful glance from which the ﬁrst sin-
ner vainly tried to hide.
The vast surge of the hymn subsided, the plaintive murmurs of
the organ died away lingeringly among the echoing aisles, the wor-
shipers rustled to their seats, and every eye was turned expectantly
upon the preacher, who quailed slightly before the innumerable
gaze, and, coming to himself, thought with agony of the thing that
must soon lie bare and open before them. His lips blanched in the
strenuous anguish of his internal conﬂict, and the power of speech
deserted him for a second or two. His manuscript lay open and
ready on the desk; he looked upon and read the neatly written
text. Then he took from his pocket a piece of folded paper, which
he held in his left hand, as if it were some talisman, and found
strength to begin.
CHA PTE R IX.
As he opened his lips, a vision of the little church at Malbourne
rushed swiftly before his mental gaze. He saw the familiar faces
clustered about the heavy gray pillars, and the reverend ﬁgure of
his father in the ancient pulpit, and all the holy counsels uttered in
that father’s beloved voice came upon him in one moment; but he
did not know that this his father’s last sermon was the echo of his
own ﬁrst.
He gave out his text, “I will confess my wickedness, and be
sorry for my sin,” and began quietly reading from the manuscript
before him in a clear and harmonious but strikingly level tone,
which, though audible all over the building, did not correct the gen-
eral tendency to drowsiness on that hot and drowsy afternoon.
. The ‘premier and those who heard him for the ﬁrst time were

disappointed, the premier deciding within himself that he would not
confer much luster upon the oratory of the Upper House, and would
never endanger Bishop Oliver’s position as the best speaker on the
Bench.
It was a sermon such as dozens of clergymen turn out every day. '
The preacher exhorted ‘his hearers to repent and confess their sins.
He reminded them that repentance is the ﬁrst and last duty which
the Church enjoins on her children. He alluded to the differing
practice of the Church in different ages with regard to it, and its
exaggeration in the Roman Communion and in old American Puri-
tan days. He observed that some sins exacted public confession.
At this point he became a little paler, and his voice rose on its ac-
customed sonorous swell. He said that it was a right and whole-
some feeling which prostrated a crowned king before the tomb of
the murdered archbishop at Canterbury, kept an emperor barefoot
in the snow at Canossa, and humiliated Theodosius before the closed.
gates of Milan Cathedral. “Do you know, my brothers,” he con-
tiued, with a thrill of intense feeling in his voice, “ why I speak
to-day of the duty of public confession of public sin? I have a}
purpose.”
He paused. For some moments there reigned that dead silence
_which is so awfully impressive in a vast assembly of living and
breathing human beings. He paused so long that people grew un-
comfortable, thinking he must be ill, and the buzzing of a perplexed
humble-bee, which had somehow strayed into the choir, and was
tumbling aimlessly against people’s heads, sounded loud and profane,
and the man who could not repress a sneeze and the lady who let
her prayer-book fall felt each guilty of an unpardonable crime.
Meantime, the dean gazed quietly before him, and no one saw the V
chill drops of agony which beaded his brow, or suspected the an-
guish which literally rent his heart.
The bishop with diﬂiculty suppressed a grunt of disapproval.
“ He pauses for eﬁect,” he thought; “ now for the ﬁreworks! Di-
vine rage consumes the deanl Out with the handkerchiefs. If
people must rant, why on earth can’t they rant in barns? ” ’
“ My brothers,” continued the dean, at last breaking the thrill-
ing silence, and speaking in a low but perfectly clear and audible
voice, “ it is because I myself am the most grievous of sinners, and
have sinned publicly in the face of this great congregation, the
meanest among whom I am unworthy to address, because I wish to

Iconfess my wickedness, and tell you that I am sorry for my sin.
I have no right to be standing in this place to-day; to be the parish
priest, as it were, of this noble building; to ﬁll an ofﬁce hallowed
by the service of a long line of saintly men. My life has been one
black lie. The three darkest blots upon the soul of man—impurity,
bloodshed, treachery—have stained my soul.”
At these words there was a faint rustle of surprise through all
the congregation. The bishop frowned; “He drives his theatrical
exaggeration too far,” he thought. The duke and Lord Arthur re-
covered from the gentle slumber the sermon’s beginning had induced.
Every eye was ﬁxed in wonder, interest, or incredulity upon the
marble features of the preacher—that is, every eye within the choir;
while to those outside it, who heard the voice from an invisible
source, the eﬁect was doubled.
“My life,” he continued, “has been outwardly successful in no
small degree. I have, in spite of my sin, been permitted to minister
to sick souls; for the Almighty is pleased sometimes to use the
vilest instruments for noble ends. I have sat at good men’s feasts,
an honored guest; yes, and at the tables of the great, the very great-
est in the land. I have risen to a position of eminence in the minis<
try of our national Church—that" Church whose meanest ofﬁce better
men that I are unworthy to ﬁll. I have been offered still greater
honors, the ofﬁce of bishop and the dignity of a spiritual peerage, as
you all know; nor was it till now my intention to decline this pro-
motion. I have been much before the public in other ways, which
it were unbecoming to mention in this holy place. Such dignities
as have been mine, my brothers—for I may still, in spite of my sins,
call you brothers, since I am still God’s child, and only desire to
return to Him by the way of penitence—such dignities are based
upon the assumption not only of moral rectitude, but of decided
piety, and neither of these has ever been mine. My beloved brothers,
hear me, and take warning, and oh! pity me, for I am the most
miserable of men. Like those against whom Christ pronounced
such bitter woes, I have desired to wear long robes, to receive greet-
ings iu the market-place, to occupy the chief seats in synagogues;
these things have been the very breath of my nostrils, and for these
I have sinned heavily, heavily. The favor of men has been dear to
me, therefore I offer myself to their scorn. To no man, I think,
has man’s favor been dearer than to me. Ah, my brothers,
there is no more bitter poison to the soul than the sweetness l

loved with such idolatry! Well does our Saviour warn us against
it! ”
He spoke all this with quiet anguish, straight from his heart, his
manuscript being closed; while at this point tears came and dimmed
the blue luster of his large deep eyes, and coursed quietly and un-
heeded down his cheeks. The congregation still listened with wide-
eyed wonder, not knowing how to take these extraordinary utter-
ances, and half suspecting that they were the victims of some stage
effect. But the premier‘s face wore a startled gaze, and he looked
round uneasily. The idea suddenly entered his head that his recent
elevation and the strenuously toilsome life he led had been too much
for the dean, and driven him mad. Nor was he alone in his belief,
which was shared by the dean’s doctor among others.
The bishop was terribly moved, and half doubtful whether it
would not be well to persuade the preacher to leave the pulpit as
quietly as possible; he, too, thought the dean mad, and trembled
lest the gossip his own son had repeated might have driven his sensi-
tive organization off its balance. Tears sprang to his eyes, and he
loathed himself for the petty feelings he had suﬁ'ered to enter his
heart that very day.
“ What I confess now, in the presence of God and of this con-
gregation, against whom I have sinned,” continued the preacher,
“ I shall confess shortly before the civil tribunals of this land, the
laws of which I have broken. Nineteen years ago, when in den-
con’s orders, I led an innocent young woman astray." Here his
voice broke with a heavy sob. “I was the tempter—l, who fell
because I deemed myself above temptation. My brothers, since
then I have not had one happy hour. Mark that, you who per-
ehance stand on the verge of transgression. But that is not all.
With a heart still stained with that iniquity, which I vainly tried to
expiate by bodily penance, I took upon me, in this very cathedral,
the awful responsibilities of the priesthood, and fell into new tempta-
tion.
“ The father of this poor girl discovered my iniquity, and, justly
angered, fell upon me with violence. In the struggle, I know not
how, I killed him. Yes, my brothers, look upon me with the hon-
est scorn you must feel when you hear that these hands, which ’
have broken the bread of life and sprinkled the waters of healing,
are red with the blood of the man I wronged. But even that is not
the full measure of my iniquity. I had a friend; I loved him—I

loved him, I tell you,” he echoed passionately, “more than any mor-
tal man. He was a man of noble character and spotless life; he
had gifts which gave promise of a glorious and beneﬁcent career.
Suspicion fell upon him through my fault, but not my deliberate
fault. He was tried for my crime, found guilty, and sentenced to
twenty years’ penal servitude.”
Here the preacher trembled exceedingly, and was obliged to
pause, while people looked from one to another with horror-stricken
eyes and blanched faces, and the very air seemed to palpitate with
their agitation. “Two days ago,” continued the unhappy man,
“ he came, fresh from the prison, to worship in this holy place. I
was preaching—I, the traitor, the hypocrite; I who had lived in
palaces while the friend of my youth pined in the prison I had de-
served—I saw him; I recognized him through all the terrible
changes that awful misery had wrought upon him. I could not bear
the sight, and ﬂed from it like another Cain. But I did not even
then repent.
“My brothers, this man wrote to me and forgave me, and that
broke my stony heart. The Almighty had called me by heavy sor-
rows through many years to repentance, but I repented not until I
was forgiven. The All-Merciful did not leave me alone in my
wickedness. I saw the wife of my youth pine away before my
eyes, and my children fade one by one till my home became a deso-
lation, and yet I sinned on, deadening my conscience by continual
opiates of subtlest sophistry. It is not for me to detail these; to
say how I persuaded myself that my gifts were needed in the minis-
try of the Church; that I was bound to sacriﬁce all, even con-
science, to the sacred calling, and such like. Blind was I, blind
with pride and self-love. Nay, I refused even to look my sin in the
face. I stiﬂed memory; I never realized what I had done until
the awful moment of revelation, when I stood eye to eye with the
friend I betrayed. My dear brothers, have you ever thought what
years of penal servitude must mean to a gentleman, a man of
reﬁned feelings, of intellectual tastes, of unusual culture? To be
herded 'with the vicious, the depraved, the brutal, the defective or
degraded organizations which swell the mass of crime in our land;
to be cut oﬁ from all other human intercourse, all converse with
the world of intellect and culture; to pass weary, weary years in
fruitless’manual toil and pining captivity; to wear the garb of
shame; to be subject to rough and uneducated and not always kind

ly gaolers ”-—here something choked his utterance for awhile-—
“ to know no earthly hope; to see the long vista of twenty yearsJ
monotonous misery stretching remorselessly ahead, and all this in
the ﬂower of youth and the hlossom~time of life? From six and
twenty to six and forty! Can you grasp what that means? This,
and more than this, I inﬂicted on the friend who loved and trusted
me; and of this I declare before God and man I repent, and desire
as far as possible to amend.
“In a few days I shall be in a felon's cell. I shall be happier
there than I have ever been in the brightest moments of my pros-
perity. My brothers, I still hear a divine commission to warn and
teach; I beseech you to heed my story and take warning. Let me
be to you as the sunken vessel which marks the treacherous reef
- beneath the wave! Listen and heed well what I say, as it were,
with dying breath, for I shall be civilly dead, virtually dead, in
twelve hours’ time. I repent, and there is mercy for me as for the
vilest; but I can never undo the consequences of my sins—never,
though I strove through all the endless ages of eternity. I can not
restore honor and innocence to her whom I robbed of these price-
less jewels. I can not give back his life to him whose blood I shed. _
I can not recall the years of youth, and hope, and health, and power
of wide Usefulness which were blasted in the prison of. my friend.
It were rash to say that the Almighty can not do these things; it
is certain He can not without disordering the whole scheme of hu-
man life, certain that He will not. How far the human will can
frustrate the divine purposes has never been revealed to mortal
man—is probably unknown to the wisdom of seraphs; but this we
know, that nothing can happen without divine permission. It may
be that man’s will is absolutely free with regard to thought, and
only limited with regard to action, to its effects upon others. Oer~
tain it is that God can bring good out of evil, and that those who
trust in Him, however oppressed and afﬂicted by the wickedness of
their fellow-men, will nevertheless be delivered in all their afﬂic-
tions, and that to them ‘ all things work for good.’ These are my
last words, dear brothers. Ponder them, I beseech you, as men
ponder dying words, even of the vilest.”
The dean ceased, and, taming, as usual, to the east, repeated
the aseription with humble reverence. He then turned once more
to the congregation, and seated himself, with a sigh of exhaustion;
while the bishop, whose eyes were full of tears, stood with uplifted

hand and pronounced the benediction, in a moved and awe-stricken
voice, upon the agitated, half-terriﬁed multitude, and upon the un-
heeding ears of the dean.
As this strange discourse proceeded, the excitement of the con-
gregation had waxed higher and higher, and spread itself by the
irresistible contagion of sympathy which exists in a vast assembly.
The prevalent idea was that the dean was mad. Many people
present had heard the story of his youth, and knew how bitter had
been his sorrow for his friend’s disgrace, and it was not unnatural
to suppose that long brooding upon this early grief had, in a mo-
ment of mental aberration, Worked itself into the hallucination
that he was himself the deer of the crime which had wrought such
sorrow. '
In spite of the rumors circulated so swiftly within the last few
days, there were few who believed the dean’s accusations against
himself. All were, however, immensely relieved when the painful
scene was ended. Women had become hysterical, and some had
fainted and been carried out; the choristers were mostly pale with
aﬁright; the clergy were dismayed, and whispered together about
the expediency of putting an end to this painful exhibition. Among
the few who took the semen seriously was the clergyman who had
heard the death-bed statement of Alma J udkins. This man heard,
and trembled and wept.
The prayer after the blessing was ended, the congregation rose
from their knees, the organ broke forth in melodious thunders, and
the choir began their slow and orderly procession as usual. But
the dean did not descend from the pulpit and take his usual place in
the rear of the clergy, and the bishop, thinking he must be ill, di-
rected a verger to go and offer him help. The man, excited and
overstrained as he was by the strong feelings stirred up by that
strange discourse, ascended the stairs and spoke softly to the dean,
who had not moved from his marble composure. There was no an-
swer.
A cry burst from the man’s lips, and rang above the rolling organ
harmonies to the very ends of the long aisles. A scene of extraor-
dinary confusion ensued. The congregation, unnerved and excited
as they were, ran tumultuously hither and thither; the choir broke
from their ranks, and clustered about the pulpit steps like a ﬂock of
ﬂuttered doves; the music stopped abruptly, with a harsh discord,
for the pupil who was working the stops, looking down to discover

the cause of the strange tumult, cried, " The dean is dead," and the
organist sprang from his seat with a cry of sorrow.
They lowered the lifeless form from the pulpit, and laid it upon
the altar steps. Some surgeons—the dean’s own doctor among
them—sprang through the crowd, and pronounced the dean to be
beyond all human aid; and following them came a tall youth, dark
eyed, and dressed in black.
“Not dead! not dead! Oh, my father! " he sobbcd; “and I
helped to break his heart! ” Oh, my father! ”
Him they hurried away unobserved, and the bishop’s clarion
voice, a voice now without a rival, rang through the confused tu-
mult, full of indignation and sharp rebuke. He bid the people return
to their places, and consider the sanctity of the spot; and, when he
was silently obeyed, he told them that the dean’s soul had tied, and
asked them to kneel and repeat the Commendatory Prayer, while
the body was borne from the spot. He made a sign to the organist,
who, blinded with tears, resumed his seat, and thundered out the
heart-shaking anguish of the “Funeral March,” while at the same
moment the heavy sound of the deep-toned knell boomed slowly
over the startled sunshiny city.
For a brief moment the bishop knelt silently by the lifeless form,
which lay like a sacriﬁce upon the altar step, and, making the holy
sign, he closed the beautiful eyes that would never more ﬂash their
electric radiance of passion and intellect upon the listening multi-
tude; he folded the lifeless hands upon the heart which had just
broken in the stress of its awful anguish; and, taking a fold of the
surplice, he laid it over the marble face, and the eloquent lips which
would never more charm with their golden music. Just as Cyril
shielded the unsuspected passions which convulsed his face from the ‘
public gaze after his son’s baptism, the bishop shielded the passion-'
less quiet of his features now.
Then the choir paced out in their usual order, save that the dean
was borne by some of the choristers, all of whom loved him, and
were eager to render him this last service; and thus, to the wailing
music and heavy thunders of the great dirge, and the deep booming
of the cathedral knell, amid the unwonted tears of his brother
priests, and of nearly all who bore ofﬁce in the cathedral, from the
organist, whose tears dropped on the keys as he played, and asked,
“When shall we see such another? ” to the man who rang the knell
—Oyril Maitland was carried out into the same warm afternoon

sunshine that was gilding the Melbourne belt‘ry, and shining on the
honest faces of those who were bidding Everard welcome after his
long exile, and offering him the simple homage of their belief in his
innocence.
“ How are the mighty fallen] the beauty of Israel is slain upon
the high places! ” mourned the bishop, silently, in the words of
David over his fallen foe and friend—words which echoed through
the hearts of the other clergy, as they escorted their dean for the
last time from the sanctuary.
CHAPTER X.
STILL unconscious of the tragedy that was being enacted to its
close in Belminster Cathedral that sunny summer aftenoon, the
little family circle at Malbourne ﬁnished the quiet and holy day as
they had begun it, and, retiring early to rest, slept such calm and
refreshing slumbers as visit the gentle and the good.
Lilian’s last thought on sleeping and ﬁrst on waking was for
Cyril, and how she might help to heal his sorely stricken soul, while
the dreadful certainty which had followed on her long suspense and
doubt on the subject of his guilt, though it ﬁlled her with deep sor-
row, yet brought the calm which never fails to accompany certainty,
however terrible.
She was very quiet at breakfast next morning, and Mr. Mait-
land, observing this, attributed it to the reaction following on the
excitement of the last few days, and was more cheery and chatty
than usual to make up for her defection.
Mark Antony, like other invalids, was always very shaky of a
morning, and declined this day to rise for his breakfast; so a saucer
of milk was placed by his padded basket on the sunny window-sill,
but remained untouched. ’
The creature looked up in response to the caressing hand and
voice of his mistress, and pnrred faintly, but turned away his head
from the proffered milk; and, after coaxing him, and oﬁering him
everything she could think of, Lilian was about to leave her pet to
rest and recover strength in the sunshine, when her retreating ﬁgure

was stayed by a faint mew, and, turning, she saw the poor little
thing staggering from its bed and trying to follow her.
She ran back in time to catch the little body as it tottered and
fell, and, with a loving glance and one soft attempt at a purr, lay
limp and lifeless in her hands.
“ Oh, Henry!” she cried, the hot tears raining from her eyes,
“my pretty Mark! ”
“ I could have better spared a better cat! ” said Mr. Maitland.
“No cat ever had a pleasanter life, or an easier death,” said
Everard, stroking the inanimate fur. “I will bury him for you,
Lilian. Let us choose a pretty spot at once.”
And they went into the garden, Everard procuring a spade and
setting to work with a practised ease that reminded Lilian of his
long years of hard labor, on the ﬂower-border beneath the window,
on the sill of which the deceased had spent so many sunny hours
in peaceful meditation upon the follies of mankind and the wisdom
of the feline race. \
The grave had been properly dug, and Everard laid the cat in
it, and having covered him with a verdant shroud, reminded Lilian
that mourners always turned from the grave before the painful
ceremony of shoveling in the earth was performed; and Lilian was
obeying this suggestion, when she discovered the hitherto unnoticed
presence of a messenger, who handed her a telegram.
She took it without suspicion, and delayed opening it until she
had spoken a kindly word to the messenger, and directed the gar~
dener to take him to the kitchen for rest and refreshment.
“If he had not caused me such bitter pain,” she said, turning
to Henry, and referring to the cat, while she broke open the envel-
ope, “I should not have loved him half so much.”
“Dear old Mark! We shall not look upon his like again. He
did indeed give the world assurance of a cat.”
He was not looking at Lilian, but into the grave, and was startled
by a low cry of intense ‘agony, and, looking up, saw' her stagger
with blanched face against the mullion of the window, where the
roses bloomed round her head.
“My poor, poor boy ! ” she cried gaspingly.
Everard dropped the spade and came to her assistance, and she
gave the paper with the terrible tidings into his hand.
“The dean died yesterday afternoon in the cathedral,” was the
brief, stern announcement.


## p. 349 (#355) ############################################

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 349
“My father, oh, my father! how shall we shield him? ” cried
Lilian, recovering her feet, but trembling all over. “ I always open
his telegrams to spare him.”
Everard said nothing, but crushed the paper ﬁercely in his
pocket, while from the force of old habit he took his spade again
and completed his task, no longer careful to spare Lilian’s feelings,
but stamping the earth resolutely down, and planting the displaced
ﬂowers upon it. Then he threw the spade aside with a deep groan.
“If he could but have spoken to me once, only once! ” he said.
“He got your letter, dear,” said Lilian, in her usual tones,
though her white lips quivered, and she still shook all over; “there
is comfort in that.”
“Yes, he must have got it. He could not have been too ill to
read it. ‘In the cathedral.’ Oh, Lilian, he might have died that
night! There was probably some heart disease. What did he
think of his seizures? ”
“Mere nervous excitement. He did not consider himself ill.
He had advice. 0h, Henry, my father! ”
“It will be a blow.”
“It will kill him! He is feebler than you think. How can he
bear this? ”
“Dearest,” said Everard, with inﬁnite tenderness, .“ it is but
death, remember. He might have heard worse tidings.”
“ My poor Cyril !—yes. If we could only hear the consequences
of our misdeeds alone, each in his own person, how much less sor-
rowful life would be! " .
“And how much less joyous, Lilian! Ah, my dear, this must
be faced, and we must take what comfort we can! "
Then they took counsel together, and decided upon assuming
that the dean was very ill, and that they were summoned to him
at once. They could then accustom Mr. Maitland’s mind gradually
to the loss, and extinguish hope by degrees until they arrived at
Belminster, when it would no longer be possible to cherish any
doubt.
Everard took upon himself the piteous task of breaking the
news, while Lilian made hurried preparations for their departure.
He went with a beating heart to the study door, and knocked, and
then it came like lightning across him that he had so gone to that
room eighteen years ago, to receive, and not to give, ill tidings.
When the gentle priest lifted his white head with a pleasant

smile from the book over which he was bending, he could not but
think of the awful look with which he had greeted him on his last
entrance, nor could he quite forget the bitter injustice done to him
then for Cyril’s sake. It seemed a terrible retribution for the guile-
less man, whose only fault was too great a pride in his gifted son.
Everard felt as if his heart would break. He could not speak, but
sat down and burst into tears, the only tears shed for Cyril in his
home. The fact that he, and no other, had to deal the aged father
this cruel blow, on the very spot where so cruel a blow had been
dealt him through that dead man’s fault, seemed an awful coin-
oidence.
Mr. Maitland‘s face changed; he was in a mood to anticipate
calamity, but he took it very gently.
“ Is it Lilian? ” he asked, in a faint voice.
Everard shook his head.
“ Not, oh, not Cyril! ” faltered the old man, with a piteous ac-
cent, which showed where his heart was most vulnerable.
“ lie is ill, sir,” returned Everard; “ seriously ill.”
Then he told him of the arrangements they had made for going
at once to Belminstor, and offered what assistance was needed.
Mr. Maitland said nothing, but rose to do as he was bid, with a
touching acquiescence, but very feeble movements. He seemed to
age ten years at least before Everard’s pitying gaze, and was ap-
parently unequal to the task of doing anything in preparation for
his absence from his duties.
They drove into Oldport just in time to catch the train, and
Everard and Lilian trembled for the poor father as they passed the
ﬂaring posters which announced the contents of the daily papers, and
read in great capitals, “ Sudden Death of the Dean of Belminster.”
But Mr. Maitland did not appear to see them; he was bewildered
and preoccupied in his manner, and asked only one question, “Did
Cyril himself send for him? ” and, appearing crushed by the nega-
ti ve answer, made no further observation upon passing events. He
talked much in a wandering way of by-gone days, and related old for-
gotten events of Cyril’s childhood, surprising Lilian by vivid remi-
niscences that were dim or quite faded in her memory, and laughing
gently from time to time at the child‘s quaint sayings and little droll-
eries of long ago.
“They were twins,” he said, addressing Lilian, as if she were
a stranger, “ A boy and a girl—such a pretty pair, and so good and

clever! Exactly alike, and so fond of each other—so fond of each
other! Poor dearsl ” he added, shaking his white head sorrow-
fully, “ drowned before their father’s eyes—before his very eyes.”
“Oh, Henry! ” murmured Lilian, in a choked voice, “what shall
we do? He wanders; he confuses us with Cyril’s twins.”
“Do not excite him; it is only temporary," Henry whispered
back.
“ Always a good son—a good son l ” continued the stricken
father, not observing their comments; “my son, the Dean of Bel-
minster. Do you know,” he added, with a pleasant smile, “ he has
been offered the Bishopric of Warham? "
“ Yes, dear father,” replied Lilian, soothingly; “ but he is very,
very ill.” '
“Ill? ” he returned, with a troubled look: “ not Cyril? He did
everything well. A gifted youth. Little Lilian was so like him.”
“Dear father,” said Lilian, when the last station before Belmin-
ster was passed, “ Cyril can never recover.”
“Is that true, Henry? ” he asked, turning sharply to Everard.
“It is too true, sir,” he replied gently. “Try to be calm; we
shall be at Belminster in ﬁve minutes.”
The old man looked about him in a hopeless, bewildered manner,
and tried to speak, but his trembling lips refused utterance. Lilian
caressed him, and spoke soothingly to him, as if to some frightened
child. “Cyril is gone to his rest, dear,” she said at last, her voice
breaking as she spoke.
“Is lie—dead? ” he asked, with great difﬁculty; and Lilian re-
plied in the afﬁrmative, and he smiled a gentle smile that went to
their very hearts, and said nothing more.
They drove through the city and into the close, in the sunny,
slumbrous noon, past the red-brick houses, looking blank in the
sunshine, with their white blinds darkening the windows; beneath
the great leafy elms, over which some rooks were sailing; past the
hoary fragment of cloister, along which two clergymen were pacing,
and talking with bated breath of yesterday‘s tragedy; beneath the
cool shadow of the great gray minster, whose vaulted roof and long
aisles had scarcely ceased to thrill with the passionate anguish 01
Cyril’s breaking heart, and round whose lofty pinnacles swallows
were sweeping in the warm, blue air; and drew up before the
pointed arches of the silent Deanery, the door of which opened
noiselessly and discovered a weeping ﬁgure ready to receive them.

Before they could respond to Miss Mackenzie’s greeting, Everard
was obliged to call Lilian’s attention to her father, who had to be
lifted from the carriage and taken at once to bed, where he re-
mained for many days in a lethargic condition.
There would be no inquest, Miss Mackenzie informed them, the
death being perfectly natural and accounted for by the disease from
which his medical adviser, as well as the dean, had long known him
to be suffering—a disease which might still have permitted him years
of life and strength under favorable conditions. His children had not
been sent for, as, under the very painful circumstances, Miss Macken-
zie could not undertake the responsibility of summoning them.
“Painful circumstances? ” asked Lilian, whose marble-white
features showed scarcely more life than those of the brother over
whose corpse she had just been bending in tearlesss, speechless sor-
row, whose features indeed looked more like those of the dean than
ever.
Miss Mackenzie having turned the key in the door to insure un-
interrupted privacy, sat down in the darkened chamber, and, saying
that Dr. Everard was better calculated than any one else to judge
of the accuracy of what she was about to relate, told them that it
was the general opinion that the dean had been visited by tempo-
rary insanity while in the pulpit the day before—an opinion, how-
ever, which was not shared by the doctor. Then, beginning with
the dean’s unwonted demeanor on the Saturday, and the abrupt
manner in which he sent his children away, she related the whole
story of the last Sunday, and the substance of the extraordinary
sermon he had delivered with his dying breath.
Lilian listened quietly without any interrogation whatever; but,
when Miss Mackenzie came to the dying man’s terrible confession,
her marble stillness left her, and she burst into tears and wept
silently till the end of the story, murmuring, under her breath,
“Thank God! oh, thank God! ” She felt that her brother was in
some measure restored to her by his penitence.
The dean’s aﬁairs were in perfect order; he had made every
preparation for death. The bishop was co-executor with Lilian of
a will he had made some time previously, by which he left half his
property to Henry Everard, and the other half to his two children,
under the trusteeship of Lilian, till they should be of age, when the
boy, in consideration of his inﬁrmity, was to receive two-thirds of
the children’s moiety, and the girl one.

Certain legacies were to be deducted from the whole amount of
his property; and, by a codicil, added on the day before his death,
there was to be a further deduction of ﬁve hundred pounds, which
was bequeathed to “Benjamin Lee, only son of Alma Judkins,
widow, formerly of Swaynestone, and lately deceased in Belmin-
ster.” The said Benjamin Lee was further recommended to the
interest and protection of “my beloved twin sister, Lilian Mait-
land.”
The terms of this testament were as yet unknown to any one
except the solicitor and the bishop, who had that morning ac-
quainted himself with them. He had made this early inquisition
into the dean's temporal affairs in consequence of ﬁnding in the
study a sealed packet addressed to himself, as executor, “ In case of
my death before I have time to lay it before the magistrates my-
self,” dated on the day before his death, duly signed and witnessed,
and containing a full and detailed account of the death of Benjamin
Lee, “to be read immediately after my death, that justice may be
done as soon as possible to those I have wronged.”
The bishop, who had with natural reluctance undertaken the
management of the dean’s aﬁairs only upon his earnest solicitation,
and under the consideration that in the course of nature the dean
would outlive him, now wished most heartily that he had had suf-
ﬁcient strength of mind to resist his importunity on the subject.
He wished it doubly when, on that very morning, the clergyman
who had heard Alma’s confession, and taken it down at her request
in writing, to which she afﬁxed her signature, conﬁded the circum-
stances to him, and asked his advice upon the subject.
Both the bishop and Mr. Strickland had separately hesitated to
publish the dead man’s disgrace, though the latter had been solemn-
ly charged to do so by the dying Alma, and summoned to her
death-bed for the express purpose of clearing Everard. The bishop,
even after reading the written confession, still held to the theory
of insanity; but, after the coincidence of the two independent con-
fessions, there was no longer any room for doubt, and he felt it his
duty to communicate at once with the Everard family, and take
instant steps toward clearing Henry Everard’s character, which he ,
did accordingly. Nevertheless, Mr. Strickland was glad to share
the responsibility with him.
But of this Miss Mackenzie, of course, knew nothing, and with-
out had enough to tell her auditors. She ended by putting into

Lilian’s hands a report taken in shorthand of the dean’s last sermon,
which Henry and Lilian perused together.
Everard passed a long, long time alone in the presence of the
dead. When he entered the silent, shadowed chamber, from which
the summer airs were excluded, and across the gloom of which one
or two long golden rays of sunshine strayed through unguarded
chinks, and where the air was heavy with that indescribable some-
thing that we dare not name, and laden with the rich perfume of
ﬂowers, he stood still, with a spasm at his heart, and feared to raise
the handkerchief from the veiled face.
And when at last he found courage to gaze upon the beautiful
and placid features, pale with the awful pallor that only comes when
the spirit has ﬂown, he, who had looked upon death in the course
ofeveryday duty so often and under so many painful circumstances,
realized for the ﬁrst time the icy horror and irreconcilable enmity
of death. A sharp pain, like the contraction of iron wires, clutched
at his eyes, which ﬁlled with those scalding tears that do not fall
or give relief, and only spring once or twice in life from the very
deepest sources in our nature; and for a few moments he would
have given all that remained to him of life for one friendly glance
of the beautiful ever-darkened eyes, one clasp of the pale, cold
hands; to hear those mute lips open once more with the cordial
warmth of by-gone days. “ Old Hal! ” he fancied he heard him say,
as on the fatal day when last they met as friends.
The quiet features never moved from their marble calm, and yet
to the living friend’s fancy the lights of mirth, of intellect, of aﬂ'ec-
tion, seemed to play upon them as in their by-gone youth, and the
sacred ﬂame of high aspiration, holy and pure passion, seemed to
ﬁre them. Old jests, old sayings, things grave and gay, earnest and
light-hearted, rushed rapidly back upon his memory. He saw Cyril
a boy again—a child with a seraphic face, and a half-piteous look of
frailty and dependence, combined with intellectual power; he saw
him a youth full of high hopes and warm enthusiasms, brilliant, gen-
erous, fascinating, and above all, pure.
He saw him in his young manhood, a being so saintly that his
very presence seemed to banish the possibility of unholy thought;
a lover, the purity of whose ardent love seemed almost to rebuke
passion; a scholar, a priest; he thought of his many gifts and at—
tainments, and all the beautiful promise of his early manhood. In
such a nature, weaknesses and errors, the common heritage of hu~

manity, might be expected; but there was an incredible horror in
the thought that this man was stained with vice and crime. Surely,
Everard thought, as he had thought so many times in the loneliness
of his cell, such things were utterly alien to this pure and noble
nature, and utterly alien and incongruous they were. Surely, it
there were a soul ﬁtted to resist the importunity of man’s lower
nature, here was one; and here indeed was one.
Then he recalled the anguish of Cyril’s words—almost the last he
ever spoke to him—“ Henry, I am a man!” and reﬂected that to a
human being there is no moral descent impossible. Yet from what
a height had this man fallen! And what a career he might have
had, who now lay dead of a broken heart before him; and what
anguish unspeakable might have been spared to others, had this
gifted and noble nature had the courage to be true to itself 1 He
thought of the terriﬁc strength of those master-passions, ambi-
tion, pride, and self-love, in that otherwise weak soul, and shud-
dered.
They had thrown a rich Indian cloth Over the library table, and
upon this they had laid the dean, robed again as he had been at the
moment of his death. The still room, with its studious gloom and
its rows of learned tomes of divinity, was decked with ﬂowers, and
wreaths and bouquets covered the feet of the dead, and lay upon
the outer folds of the white robe. In the pale hands Lilian had
placed some blood-red roses, which she had brought from Mal-
bourue, plucked from two trees' they planted on their twenty-ﬁrst
birthday—an unacknowledged instinct made her shrink from the
white ﬂowers so usual in the death-chamber—and these and the
scarlet doctor’s hood gave a strange luster to the solemn scene, and
strongly emphasized the Parian whiteness of the face and hands.
Those who saw Cyril die had seen the agony pass from his face,
which was, as it were, transﬁgured at the close of his sermon by a
look of ineﬁ‘able serenity, a look that never left it. The dead face
was that of the young ideal Cyril of Henry’s youth, the man his
Maker intended him to be; the man he ever lived afterward in his
friend’s thoughts. Both features and expression now had the strong
likeness to Lilian’s which had been so marked in their childhood.
The door of the silent chamber was opened more than once that
afternoon, and softly closed again, unnoticed by Henry; and those
who thus forbore to intrude on his grief never forgot the scene—
the dead man lying in his awful quiet like some sculptured eﬂigy
\

356 THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLJND.
on a tomb, but not more statuesque than the living friend seated in
the chair by his side, facing him, with his gray head supported on
his hand, and his eyes riveted upon the unseeing face.
Pleasant summer sounds of bird and insect, and even the far-off
laughter of children, fell deadened upon the hushed silence of that
darkened room; the silvery cadences of the cathedral chimes en-
tered it. from time to time, and at the hour of even-song the distant
thunder of organ-music broke solemnly upon its calm.
The lines of straying sunshine stole slowly from point to point;
once the end of a broken shaft fell upon the pale hands and gilded
the edge of a paper clasped in the unconscious ﬁngers—Everard
knew that it was his own letter which had been so clasped at the
moment of death, and which those who found it in the nerveless
hand, on seeing, had again shut in the stiﬁening clasp—the waver-
ing shadows of leaves and boughs played in varying dance over the
closed blinds of the easements; hour after hour went by, and the
living man seemed to change into the semblance of the still form he
gazed upon.
He thought many, many thoughts, such as no words can express,
and experienced feelings such as no speech may render—thoughts
which arise only when the intellect is quickened by the stir of un-
wonted feeling: thoughts of life and its deep meaning, death and its
dark mystery; of the strangeness of man‘s destiny; of the purpose
of his being; of the limits of human will, and of the eternal conse-
quences of human action; of the 'glory and beauty of moral recti-
tude. and the nothingness of all human achievement besides.
Through all his thoughts there ran the deep, strong undercur-
rent of unutterable pity for the man who lay before him, slain in
his prime by the pain of his own misdoing, and, blended with that,
there was also a thankfulness that his agony was stilled at last, and
his soul at rest. He recognized the righteousness of the feeling
which prompted Cyril to his tardy confession, and knew that no
life save that imprisoned and degraded one from which he had but
just escaped would have been possible to him. He thought of the
iron strength of this man’s pride and self-love, and wondered at the
mystery of human iniquity.
He mused on his own passionate and life-long devotion to the
man who had so terribly injured him, a devotion that neither his
weakness nor even his crime could destroy, and he asked himself
what it was in Cyril that so enohained not only the best and deep'

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 357
est aﬁections of his friends, but also the love of all those with whom
he came in contact.
It seemed to him that there must be some deep and enduring
virtue in a man who wins such love and devotion ; it appeared
incredible that the affections of honest hearts should be wasted on
what is utterly worthless.
He reﬂected how he could best serve the dead. He saw that he
had been wrong in aiding him to conceal his past—that nothing but
truth can serve any human being; and it seemed to him that he
might fulﬁll those duties he had left undone, and carry on those that
death had interrupted. He thought especially of Alma’s neglected
child.
He could not rid himself of the strong feeling we have in the
presence of the dead, that the spirit is hovering about its forsaken
shrine, and is conscious of the thoughts we cherish, and it seemed
to him that the dead lips smiled approval of his resolution. He
mused upon the unﬁnished letter found upon Cyril’s writing-table,
and dated on the day of his death—“ Dear Henry, your noble letter
has broken my heart,” and he felt, as in his ardent youth, that he
could go through ﬁre and water for this man.
He thought of old that Cyril’s character contained the wig
weibl'iche element Goethe prized. He was wrong; that saving in-
gredient was in his own manlier nature, not in the weak Cyril’s.
Through all his long reverie he did not stir from his statue-like
calm; nothing in the still chamber marred the quiet which is the
homage we pay to that silent terror, death. His very breath seemed
stilled in the intensity of his abstraction ; he did not see the shift-
ing of the sunbeams, the gradual drooping of the ﬂowers, the fall
of petal after petal, nor did he hear the recurrent chime-music,
though years afterward these things recalled the solemn thoughts of
that long vigil.
The air was cool and refreshing, and the slanting sunbeams were
dyeing the minster towers a clear wine-like crimson, when his long
reverie was broken at last by the entrance of Oyril’s orphan chil-
dren.
Then he rose, greeted them affectionately, and, bidding them
look on him as their father now, he left them alone with their dead.

CHAPTER XI.
Evnnann closed the door softly behind him, and went into the
hall with a solemn radiance on his face, and was about to ascend
the staircase to inquire into Mr. Maitland’s condition, when he was
met by a gentleman with a benign and intellectual face and a digni-
ﬁed bearing.
“Dr. Everard," he said, in a rich, deep voice, “allow me the '
honor of shaking hands with a man whose noble conduct has per-
haps saved a human soul. I am the Bishop of Belminster,” he
added, “the late dean’s executor and friend, and am intrusted by
him with the duty of clearing your character from the imputations
which have lain so long upon it.”
And, leading him into the study, where the evidences of the
dean’s daily occupations and the empty chair by the table, on which
lay his unﬁnished tasks, spoke more pathetically of his death than
his quiet form itself, the bishop acquainted him brieﬂy with all that
the reader knows already concerning the will, the written confession,
and Alma’s death-bed depositions. Having done this, he led him to
the drawing-room, which was ﬂushed through its closed blinds with
the glory of the summer sunset, and introduced him to his brothers,
Keppel and George, and his sister Mrs. Whiteford, who were wait-
ing to receive him, Keppel having brought the children from Ports-
mouth. \
They greeted him with cordial affection, and many expressions
of regret and coutrition for their long injustice; and Keppel intro-
duced him to Lady Everard, to whom he had been married after
his brother’s disgrace.
Henry was glad, though he could not but feel the meeting ex-
tremely painful, especially under Cyril’s roof. The bishop had con-
siderater withdrawn on presenting him, and, after the ﬁrst confused
expressions of welcome, regret, and congratulation, the relatives
scarcelv knew what to say to each other until Henry at last ex-
pressed it hope that all knowledge of Cyril’s share in Benjamin Lee’s
death might be spared his children, which all agreed, if possible, to
do.
Admiral Sir Keppel and the Rev. George, though both some years
older than Henry, looked younger; neither had a gray hair, and
both were ﬁne, handsome, robust men. They were much distressed

THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND. 359
at the marks of hardship and suffering upon him, and Mrs. erite~
ford wept and blamed herself greatly for allowing her husband to
dissuade her from communicating with him in his trouble.
“ You must pay us a long visit, Hal,” said Keppel. “ We have
a nice place near Ryde, and the children will take you about in their
boat, and make you young again.”
“And you must certainly come to us," added George; “my
wife told me to bring you home this very night. Our place is very
healthily situated on the hill yonder, just outside Belminster."
“And to us,” added Mrs. Whiteford. “My husband wants you
to go for a cruise with us. That will recruit your health, if any-
thing will.”
“Ah, Henry, I can sympathize with you! ” said George, with
deep solemnity. “ I know what a prison is like. I had a twelve-
month, the effects of which I am still feeling,” he added, with a sigh
of intense enjoyment.
“ You had a twelvemonth? ” inquired Henry, scanning his sol-
emn clerical brother from head to foot with astonishment.
“You may well look surprised,” said Keppel, “ and wonder
what persons have to do with the inside of a gaol."
“l have experienced the honor of persecution, Henry,” ex-
plained George, with deep satisfaction. “ The rigors of my captiv-
ity were greatly softened by the sympathy of faithful people."
“ Rigors indeedl ” growled Keppel. “The beggar wasin clover,
and almost on his parole. But, as I tell George, he would have got
double the time, and been cashiered into the bargain, if I had been
in command.” '
“But, my dear George,” asked Henry, “what were you perse-
cuted for? and how could you be imprisoned? I thought the ﬁres
of Smithﬁeld, the memory of which you used to be so fond of re-
calling, were extinguished centuries ago.”
“You are mistaken, Henry,” returned George, in his gruffth
base. “In the seclusion of your dungeon you have been spared
even the knowledge of the awful evils we in the world have been
called upon to face. Never was the enemy of mankind more active
than in these latter evil days. The Catholic Church is beleaguered
by all the powers of darkness, and those of her priests who dare to
be faithful are hurled into dungeons.”
“The Catholic Church? Why, I thought you were one of the
strongest pillars of Protestantism, and renounced the‘scarlet woman

and all her works? I am glad to see that persecution and dun-
geons have not permanently damaged you.” _
Keppel remembered the solemn tenant of the near chamber in
time to stiﬂe a burst of laughter, while George looked embarrassed,
and stammered a good deal.
“Ah, Henry! ” he replied, “you are thinking of tWenty years
ago, when I wasin the depths; I have advanced greatly since then.”
“You don’t mean to say you are a Ritualist?” asked Henry,
eying his brother’s sacerdotal appearance with aﬁ‘ectionate amuse-
ment.
“ My dear Henry,” said Keppel, interrupting George’s disclaimer
of this term, “that fellow is the Ritualist, the ringleader of them all.
What the service would come to if mutineers were let down as
lightly as he is, Heaven only knows. Persecution indeed! ”
Henry smiled. “ How this would have amused Cyril! ” he said
involuntarily. “No, George; I am not mocking,” he added, in
response to a pained look on his brother’s face; for, as he learnt
subsequently, Cyril had been wont to tease his reverend brother a
good deal on the extreme to which he had veered from his ultra-
Protestnnt opinions. “If you think it your duty to differ from
your bishop, every one must honor you for going to prison about
it. But your tenets used to be so very extreme in the other direc-
tion. Tell me about your children.”
Every effort was made to keep Cyril’s funeral as private as pos-
sible, but in vain. Lilian, who was co-executor with the bishop,
had so much to occupy her in her father’s illness, and her great
anxiety to spare Marion and Everard the slightest suspicion of the
tragedy which killed their father, that she left the funeral arrange-
ments to the bishop, only stipulating for extreme privacy. By some
perverse destiny, the bishop misunderstood her wishes and those of
the family, which were that Cyril’s remains should be taken to Mal-
bourne, and at the last moment it was discovered that all was ar-
ranged for an interment in the cathedral burial-ground.
Thither, therefore, the dean’s remains were borne by the hands
of those who had loved him and volunteered for this service, and
the mourners, on following their dead into the cathedral, were dis-
mayed to ﬁnd it thronged from end to end by people, who wore
mourning, and many of whom bore wreaths for the dead. They
had feared a curious crowd, but the majority of this crowd were

animated by something better than curiosity. Those who accept-
ed the dean’s terrible revelations came to honor his penitence, and
respect his fallen estate; many clergy came in the spirit which
moved his brother seer to do honor to the remains of the disobe-
dient prophet. ‘
But the public at large utterly refused all credence to his guilt,
not only at the time of the funeral, but even after Alma’s confes-
sion had been made public. Not a woman in Belminster, and not
many men, held the golden-mouthed preacher and large-hearted
philanthropist to be guilty. The question was largely discussed in
the press, as well as in private circles; instances of similar self-
accusations of half-forgotten crimes by those whose minds had been
consumed by long-brooding grief and strained by overwork were
cited; and it was the popular opinion that the dean died in the ex-
citement of a terrible hallucination.
Flags were ﬂoated half-mast high, shops were shut, and knells
were tolled in the city churches and in some villages on the day of
the funeral. Clergymen came from rural parishes to pay the last
homage to their great brother; the Nonconformist ministers, with
whom he had always maintained such pleasant relations, ﬂocked to
the grave of the gifted and gracious Churchman; societies and
charitable bodies in which he had taken interest sent deputations.
Most of those who saw him die were there. In the midst of this
vast concourse, beneath the majestic arches of the lofty cathedral,
amid the dirge-like thunders of the organ and the mournful chant-
ing of the full choir, there was a pathetic simplicity in the plain
cofﬁn, followed by its half-dozen mourners, foremost among whom
showed the silvered head and bowed form of the friend so deeply
wronged by the dead. Cyril’s weeping daughter was on Everard’s
arm, and Lilian led his blind son by the hand; Ingram Swayne-
stone and George and Keppel Everard closed the list of kinsfolk.
But the uninvited mourners were innumerable, and the tears they
shed were many, and not the least imposing part of the grand and
solemn Burial Service was the immense volume of human voices,
whichrose like the sound of many waters upon the mournful strains
of the funeral hymn.
At the close of the ceremony, Henry’s attention was attracted
to a young man who had pressed gradually nearer and nearer to the
grave, into which be cast a wreath, and who manifested great emo-
tion, which he nevertheless tried hard to restrain. There was some-

thing in the handsome face of this ﬁne young fellow which sent a
quiver through Henry’s heart, and startled Lilian painfully—a some-
thing which moved Henry to accost the young man in the slight
confusion which ensued while the little procession was re-forming.
“ You appear to be moved, sir,” he said, in a low voice; “ may
I ask if you were an intimate friend of the late dean‘s? ”
The youth was about to make some reply, when his gaze was
arrested by the sorrowful glance of Marion, who was upon her
uncle’s arm. He stopped as if in deference to her, and, instead of
replying, took a card from his pocket and gave it to Everard, who
’ read upon it, “ Benjamin Lee."
“That will explain to Dr. Everard,” he said, observing the
change upon Everard‘s face.
Everard bid him call at the Deanery at a certain hour, and they
had a long interview in the very room which had witnessed Cyril’s
anguish upon seeing his son.
“ I would give half my life not to have spoken to him as I did,"
sobbed the young fellow. “I don’t want to be a gentleman now,
Dr. Everard; that is all knocked out of me. I see what ambition
did for my poor father. I heard his last words; I saw him} die.
I only want to do some good in the world now. I am all alone.
I buried my poor mother yesterday. She died at peace. She bid
me, if ever it lay in my power, to serve you and yours, remember
how much she injured you, and try to atone for it. It cost her
something to tell me what she had done to you. But she thought
I would make one more witness.”
“ You shall atone,” Everard replied. “Look upon me as a
friend. I, in my turn, will try to do for you what he would have
done had he lived. Who knows,” he added musingly, “how far
we may be permitted to make up for each other’s shortcomings.
If the one great vicarious sacriﬁce is so potent, others ought surely
to ﬂow from it and share its potency.”
He sent for Lilian, and from that moment Benjamin Lee was
no longer alone in the world. She consulted with Henry upon the
young man’s capacities and acquirements, and ﬁnally a situation
was found for him in an oﬂice in Belminister, Lee having agreat
desire to live in the city which had such solemn associations for
him. He also became subsequently, to his great joy, one of the
choir, and his beautiful voice was daily lifted in praise and prayer
beneath the solemn arches which had thrilled to his father’s peni-

tential anguish. Marion and Everard Maitland in time became
deeply attached to him, little dreaming of the tie that existed be-
tween them; they thought of him only as a friend and protégé of
their uncle Henry. -
The depositions of the dean, and those taken by the clergyman
at Alma’s request, having been forwarded to the proper quarters,
and corroborated by young Lee’s evidence and that of Everard him-
self, who was able, on his examination, to give a satisfactory ac-
count of the manner in which he spent the afternoon of Lee’s
death, it became evident to the authorities that a terrible miscar-
riage of justice had occurred. How to repair this miscarriage was
a difﬁcult question, and one which exercised the mind of the House
of Commons, before which it was laid, in no small degree. The
ticket-of-leave was annulled, and Everard was declared to be a free
man. The property he forfeited on his conviction was restored to
him with its interest. There was some question of oﬁering him
employment under Government, which was, however, not carried
out.
As soon as Everard was formally set free from the bondage of
his ticket-of-leave, Lilian and he were quietly married.
The drama is played out. The November afternoon closes in
upon the same wide and varied landscape that Alma Lee saw so
many years ago with innocent eyes and uuawakened heart, all un-
conscious of the destiny whose black shadow was even then darken-
ing her path; little dreaming of the temptation about to assail her,
and the tragedy in which one sin was to involve so many lives.
The ancient gray tower, dreaming in the soft afternoon haze,
gives a mellow voice to the passage of time with its solemn, sweet
chimes; the slender grace of the Victorian daughter-tower emu-
lates its hoary majesty, as it rises above the smoke-canopy of the
little town on the river; the tiny bays are visible on the wood-clad
horizon; the ﬂocks spread on stubble and down; the cornel is
purple in the ivied hedgerow; the solemn, half-conscious silence
of the chill gray afternoon seems laden with an unspoken mys-
tery it would fain reveal.
“-—-the silence grows
To that degree, you half believe '
It must get rid of what it knows,
Its bosom does so heave."

364 THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND.
The fairy music swells as of old upon the listening air; the
merry bell-peals blend and clash in a sweet dissonance, changing
into harmony, like the transient wrangling of happy lovers; the
heavy rumble and creek of the broad wheels and stamp of the iron
hoofs make a rough bass burden to the silver treble of the bells;
and the nodding crests of the gaily caparisoned wagon-horses rise
into view on the crest of the bill by the gate over which Alma Lee
gazed in her unawakened youth, and thought of harmless common-
place things in which nothing tragic had any part.
The sturdy steeds stop, as on that far-oﬁ' day, with a gradual
‘ dropping of the blithe bell-music; the great wagon is brought to
with a rumble and clatter, and cries of “Whup” and “Whoa;”
the drag is cast under the massive hind wheel; and Will Grove
rests, as of old, against the strong shaft, and gazes over the gate at
the still dreamy landscape, and recalls the day when Alma’s beauti-
ful young face and graceful form were outlined against such a chill
gray sky as this.
Will is stouter than on that day, and his limbs move more stiﬁiy
and heavily, and there are gray hairs in his thick beard. He wears
no ﬂower now in his felt hat, which has lost its rakish cock. He
apostrophizes a sweet, ﬂower-like face, which peeps roguishly over
the wagon ledge at him, with a rough but kindly, “Bide still, ye
bad maide;” and the bad maid prattles on with cries of “Gran-
fer,” and snatches at his hat; but he seems not to heed her, as he
thinks of Alma and her tragic story, which will be related for years "
to come in the snug bar of the Sun, and by many a cottage ﬁreside
round.
“ She were a bad ’un, she were! " he muses; and some vague
notions of witchcraft and half-formed shadowy ideas of love-phil-
ters steal down through many generations to his uncultured brain,
to account for Cyril Maitland’s strange infatuation.
And Alma hides her broken heart in her lonely far-off grave,
just when she should be living in an honored prime: and Cyril’s
crushed spirit has rest in his grave, within sound of the same cathe-
dral chimes. And how many gracious gifts and joyous possibilities
and noble opportunities are buried with these two tardily penitent
sinners! Some vague feeling of the pity of it all stirs Will Grove’s
heavily moving emotions, as he cracks his whip and strides 0n-
ward, waking the fairy music of the bells in its blithe and changing
cadences.

There are the Swaynestone woods; but the house presents a
blank face, with its shuttered windows and closed doors, and no
smoke rises from the chimneys, and no sound is heard about its
courts. The Swaynestones are gone abroad for a year or two, to
live down the memory of the dean’s disgrace. And here is Mal-
bourne; but the old faces are seen no more in the Rectory. A
stranger preaches from the village pulpit, and strangers walk in the
pleasant garden, and know nothing of the sweet and tender, if sad,
associations which hallow every tree and ﬂower. Will Grove and
his team go on their musical way, till the clashing cadences fade
and die in the distance, and the last gleam of brass-mounted trap~
pings is swallowed in the evening shadows.
Let us ﬂit on the airy wing of Fancy southward, over the dim
downs and the gray murmuring sea; over the orchards and farms
of Normandy; across the broad poplar-lined plains of France,
breathing warmer, clearer air with every breath; over the airy sum-
mits of the Vosges; over sunny Cete d’Or, where the vineyards
have just yielded up their latest spoil, and lie brown and bare in
their winter sleep; over the green and pine-clad slopes of the J ura,
warm now in the sun's western glow ; over blue lake and icy Alp,
till we rest on the northern shore of sweet Lake Leman, and see the
solid stone towers of Chillon reﬂected in the clear,jewel-like waters.

AFTERGLOW.
Nor far from Lake Leman’s shore at Montreux, a pretty chAlet,
girdled round with the two-storied veranda so usual to Swiss
houses, stands on a terrace among fruit-trees; and upon that terrace,
in the warm, still air of the clear November sunset, stood Lilian,
and gazed across the calm blue lake at the Savoyard Alps, which
were already streaked and veined with snow, and admired the
roseate glow which lighted the seven-peaked summit of the Dent dd
Midi as with celestial ﬁre, thinking over the same tragic tale which
was passing through the memory of the Melbourne wagoner to the
accompaniment of his blithe bell-music.


## p. 366 (#372) ############################################

366 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND.
v The ethereal Alpine glow suggested beautiful far-off thoughts to
Lilian—thoughts of paradise and the rest of the departed, of the par-
dun and sweet peace of the penitent. Cyril seemed near, very near,
to his twin sister at such quiet moments, nearer than he had
ever been since the sin which put apart their lives, so mysteriously
entwined by nature. The tragic scene in the cathedral had restored
him to her as in his stainless youth; not that she regarded the
anguish which killed him as any expiation or felt his death to be
anything but a mercy; he was restored because his falseness was
gone and he was penitent; and she felt that their spirits now held
mystic communion sweeter and purer than that of their guileless
childhood, and rejoiced.
She was leaning upon a wheeled chair, as she gazed upon the
exquisite scene before her, and breathed the soft breath of the part-
ing day. In the chair sat her white-haired father, with a happy
smile on his beautiful placid face.
“You must go in now, dear,” she said, in the soothing tones we
use toward little children; “the sun is gone.” And she pushed the
chair along the terrace to an open French window, and led the old
man, who was very feeble, under the veranda into a bright salon,
where a wood ﬁre had just been kindled on the hearth; and, plac-
ing him comfortably in an arm-chair by the leaping blaze, left
him with a tender caress to dream and doze in the gathering twi-
light.
She paused in the garden to pluck a sweet late rose and fasten it
in the black dress she were for Oyril, and then passed, with a light,
swift step, through the gateway into the dusty high-road, and set
her face toward the Jura, which lay dark against the incandescent
sky of sunset.
She had not gone very far along the pleasant road toward the
warm glory of the departing day, when her sweet, serene face,
clearly illumined as it was by the afterglow, suddenly took a new
radiance, and was, as it were, transﬁgured by such a look as no
words can express; such a look as one or two of the greatest masters
have succeeded in painting in a Madonna face; such a look as only
Christian art, and that at its very best, can portray. The source of
this beautiful expression was the dark ﬁgure of a man standing in a
wearied attitude, gazing over the lake, in strong relief against the
western brightness. He turned at the sound of Lilian’s light step,
and met her face with a corresponding radiance in his brown eyes,-

and came toward her with a momentary elasticity in his wearied
limbs.
“I was afraid I had missed you,” he said, suffering her to take
some of the numerous parcels with which he was laden, and thus
free one of his arms, in which she linked her hand with a loving
pressure. “It took so long to do all the commissions. Vevey was
full; the whole canton was shopping there. The children? Oh,
they are rowing home. Obermann took a boatman, and the lake is
like glass.”
“ And you are tired with the walk, Henry.”
“I was till I saw you. I can not get over this weakness yet,
Lilian. Of course, it must take time. But I am quite resigned to
the fact that I can never be strong again.”
“But you are stronger. Herr Obermann said this morning that
you looked ten years younger,” said Lilian, with a wistful appeal in
her voice.
“ Inﬁnitely stronger, dearest; and there is every prospect of my
living to~ a good old age yet, and a happy one. Shall I tell you
what I was thinking when I heard your step? i I was thinking,
‘Suppose she had done as I wished, as every reasonable creature
wished; suppose she had ceased to think of me, save as we think
of the dead, and given her heart and youth to one who could have
made her happy—’ ”
“But you know that was impossible, Henry, when I had given
my heart and my life to you.”
“ Ah, Lilian, it is not every honest and loyal love that can sur-
vive such a discipline, and waste its youth and hope as you did
yours on me! But suppose it had been so, and I had not succumbed
to despair and died in prison, though I do not thinkI could have
lived through those awful years without you.” '
“And yet you talk of my wasted youth.”
“And it was wasted for you, darling. But suppose it had been
so, and I had regained my freedom, and found you, as you must
ever have been, a kind, true friend, but the happy wife of another
-—of Swaynestone, for instance, as he told me you should have been
—with your heart occupied by a mother‘s love and cares ;—-ahl my
dear, how could I have faced life alone?” Henry paused, for his
heart was so full that he could not speak, and the tears were in his
eyes, and also in Lilian’s, which were raised to his, speaking the
language which no words can render. “What you have been to

368 THE SILENCE 0F DEAN MAITLAND.
me! what you have done for me through all those years of benuti~
ful sacriﬁce! ” he added, when his voice came back.
“Dearest, I have only loved you," replied Lilian.
“ You have only loved me," echoed Henry, pressing her hand
more closely to his heart; “that is all. Sometimes I think I should
not have been happier if we had been united in our youth, and lived .
all those years of fuller life together. Darling, there are compensa-
tions: it was worth going to prison all those years to ﬁnd you at
the end.” And he thought, but did not say, that Cyril’s treachery
was atoned by his twin sister’s loyalty.
Lilian always felt that she must make up to Henry all the sor~
row caused by Cyril; while Henry, remembering what Oyril’s sin
had cost her, felt that he could never do enough to make up for it.
“Of one thing I am quite sure,” he added, as they leached the
gate, and the evening sky, with its one white star, looked down
upon their happy faces, “the young couple in the pension over the
way have not half so sweet a honeymoon as ours.”
Just then light footsteps came bounding up frorn the lake-side
toward them, and Marion and the blind boy, Everard, their young
faces ﬂushed with pleasure and exercise, came running to them, fol-
lowed by Herr Obermann, who now acted as the tutor to both boy
and girl.
“I rowed the whole way, and Marry steered; and look! what
a sack of pine-cones I have for grandfather! ” cried Everard, gaily,
as Lilian received him with a caress, for they encouraged his caress-
ing ways in consideration of the blindness which debarred him from
the pleasure of realizing his friends‘ presence by touch. Then they
all entered the salon together, and grouped about the blazing hearth
for the idle evening hour they so delighted in, while Herr Obermann
left them to enjoy his pipe and his volume of Kant in his own espe-
cial den.
Little Everard sat by his grandfather, and handed him pine-
cones, which the latter threw on the ﬁre, with childlike pleasure in
the blaze and crackle they made, and in which the blind child also
took a strange delight, saying that he could feel the brightness.
These two were ﬁrm friends, never so happy as when one could
help the other. Everard delighted to wheel his grandfather’s chair,
or lend him his arm; while Mr. Maitland would read aloud for the
boy’s beneﬁt, indifferent to the book he read, since his memory had
left him on the day of Cyril’s death, and he could thus repeat the

same book over and over again, with a fresh sense of pleasure each
time, a power that was useful to the boy in enabling him to get pas-
sages, especially passages of poetry, by heart.
Mr. Maitland never realized Cyril‘s death; he remained under
the impremiion that they were always on a journey to Belminster
to visit the dean, and was perfectly patient, his lack of memory de-
stroying all sense of the passage of time. Every evening, when Lil-
ian visited him in his bed to bid him good-night, he asked if they
were going on to Belminster to-morrow, and when Lilian replied,
“Not to-morrow, dear father; perhaps the day after,” went to
sleep in perfect content, until one night, about three years after the
dean’s death, when, instead of putting his usual question, he said,
very quietly, “I shall be with him before morning,” and turned to
his rest with a happy smile, and in the morning they found him in
the same restful attitude, dead.
There was nothing distressing in the merciful inﬁrmity which
had spared his gray head such bitter sorrow. He was to the last
the same courtly, polished gentleman; the same genial companion,
delighting in all that was beautiful and elevating, and content to
look on at the life going on around him.
He could discourse of long past events, and of art and literature,
as well as ever, but his mind never received any fresh impressions
after the tremendous blow that crushed it. On meeting strangers,
he was sure to introduce the following phrase into the conversation:
—“ You may perhaps know my son, the Dean of Belminster. He
has just been presented to the See of Warham.” This was the only
painful circumstance connected with his inﬁrmity, save that he
never could grasp the fact that Henry and Lilian were married, and
occasionally embarrassed them considerably, by blandly asking them
what date was ﬁxed for the wedding, and always alluded to Lilian
as Miss Maitland, a circumstance that led strangers to suppose that
he referred to his grandaughter, Marion.
The children were carefully guarded from all knowledge of their
father’s transgressions. It was, of course, easy to keep the news-
papers from Everard; and, with a little care, Marion was also
shielded from them. The Times of the Monday following the dean’s
death published the telegram stating that he had died suddenly in
the cathedral at the close of an eloquent sermon the day before, and
also gave such a. sketch of his life up to its close as is its usual cus-
tom on the death of eminent men, and this paper Marion read,
24 l

greatly wondering that no account of dear papa’s funeral ever ap-
peared. Lilian took them away from Belminster as soon as Mr.
Maitland could be moved, to a quiet seaside village, where they re-
mained till her marriage. To guard them more effectually from any
chance knowledge of the truth, as well as to restore Henry's shat-
tercd health, it was decided that the little family should live abroad
for some years at least.
His physician had told Henry that he would never be ﬁt for
mental labor of any intensity or long duration, and he accepted the
prospect of a life of busy idleness, which in the end proved very
happy, however diﬁ'ereut to that he had anticipated in his youth.
He was thus obliged for ever to renounce his beloved profession,
though he never lost interest in it, or ceased to cultivate the mani-
fold studies connected with it. In his quiet leisure he found oppor-
tunity to set before the public much valuable information on prison
life, and particularly to indicate its hygienic aspects, mental as well
as physical.
In the serene happiness of his later years, it was sweet to Henry
to dwell on the brighter scenes of his life in the prison which had
at last become so dear to him, and contained so many friends, and
he often talked of it, the more so as little Everard manifested an in-
tense interest in everything connected with captivity. He had all
“The Prisoner of Chillon ” by heart, and loved to go into the
vaulted dungeon in the castle, and touch the “pillars of Gothic
mold,” and the ring to which Bonnivard was chained, and listen
to the lapping of the water on its massive walls, and hear people
speak of the dim light with its watery reﬂections. Both children
knew from their ﬁrst meeting with their uncle of his unmerited
punishment, and understood that his innocence had been proved be-
yond all doubt, but they never were told who was the real criminal.
Marion remembered the incident of giving the handkerchief to
the man whose shaven head roused her little brother’s innocent sus-
picions the day they waited in the pony chaise outside the house of
Leslie’s widow, and it was her great delight, as well as her brother's,
to get “ dear Uncle Henry ” in the mood to relate the moving inci-
dents of his escape and brief spell of freedom, and they invariably
wept with great enjoyment at the tragic close of the narrative,
when the fugitive sank into the death-like unconsciousness of ex-
haustion and starvation.
Henry and Lilian became the types of true lovers in the eyes of

the numerous young people growing up around them, and were
always appealed to against the decisions of ﬁinty-hearted parents
and guardians in the crises of their love-affairs; they also became a
second father and mother to the many Maitlands, Swaynestones,
Everards, and others of the rising generation, all of whom regarded
a visit to Uncle Henry and Aunt Lilian as the height of bliss. So
that, although their long-deferred marriage was childless, it was
blest with the love of many young creatures, besides the especial
children, Marion and Everard and Benjamin Lee.
The little family was already knit together on that November
evening in bonds of strong and deep affection. They made a pleas-
ant picture in the warm ﬁrelight, the white-haired man, with the
blind boy nestling to his side, feeding the bright hearth with resin-
ous ﬁr-apples; Henry and Lilian side by side opposite them; and
Marion sitting on the rug in the full blaze, with her head resting
against Lilian’s knee, while she read her letters in the ﬁrelight.
“The new dean,” she quoted from her girl-friend's letter, “is
the antipodes of your dear papa, whom we shall never cease to la-
ment. Mrs. Little’s baby could not be got to sleep on any condition
whatever, and naughty Canon Warue asked Mrs. L—— why she did
not try one of the dean’s sermons. He is dreadfully learned (the
dean, not the baby), and a regular frump; his wife and daughters
(ﬁve) are all frumps, with red noses and hands and big feet. We
called at the dear Deanery on Thursday, and oh! Marry, I thought
my heart would break when I saw all the dear old pretty things;
and, when tea was brought in and placed on the very same table,
Ethel and I burst out crying. Jim says it was the worst possible
form, and mother was ready to sink through the carpet with shame.
The dean is so absent that he stirs his tea with the sugar-tongs, and
never remembers who people are, unless it is desirable to forget.
Imagine the contrast to our dean. Your uncle George is driving
the bishop to distraction with his goings on at St. Chad’s. They
say the poor bishop has gone down on his knees and asked him as
a personal favor to travel for a year or so. The new tenor has the
most glorious voice. Dr. Rydal says it makes him ten years younger.
I think your uncle Henry knows him—a handsome fellow named
Lee. The Times says that Lady Swaynestone has twins.” (“Dear
me, Uncle Henry,” interrupted Marion, “how twins do run in our
family! ”) “ The last we heard of them, Lionel and Lilian were as
naughty as they could live, so it is a good thing. So Mr. Leonard

Maitland is to be married in the enring. Jim knows her people
well. How we miss Everard’s voioel etc. “And yet,” said Mari-
on, as she ﬁnished her letter, “I do not wish to go back to deer
Belminster. It would be too sad.”
And her brother echoed her words; and then, after their even-
ing meal of Swiss fare, Everard’s violin and his tutor’s came out,
and there were music and the singing of sweet old gleea, while Mr.
Maitland sat listening happily by the ﬁre, and Henry heard from
behind his paper or joined in, when required, until the hour came
for the blind boy to stand before his grandfather and repeat the
evening psalms, which he knew by heart from his chorister experi-
ence; and the young folk and their grandfather went to their rest,
and Herr Obermann to his pipe, and Henry and Lilian were left by
the bright hearth together. That was the happiest time in all the
happy day.
THE END.
