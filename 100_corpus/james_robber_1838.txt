CHAPTER I.
1T was in the olden time of merry England. Not at
that far-removed period when our native land first re-
ceived its jocund name from the bowmen of Sherwood,
and when the yeoman or the franklin, who had wan-
dered after some knightly banner to the plains of the
Holy Land, looked back upon the little island of his
birth with forgetfulness of all but its cheerful hearths
and happy days. Oh, no ! it was in a far later age,
when, notwithstanding wars and civil contentions not
long past by, our country still deserved the name of
merry England, and received it constantly among a class
peculiarly its own. That class was the “good old
country gentleman,” an antediluvian animal swallowed
up and exterminated by the deluge of modern improve-
ments, and whose very bones are now being ground to
dust by railroads and steamcarriages. Nevertheles ,
in that being there was much to wonder at and much to
admire; and the inimitable song which commemorates
its existence does not more than justice to the extinct
race. It was in the days of Walton and Cotton, then,
or somewhere thereabout (for it is unnecessary in a
tale purely domestic to fix the date to a year), that the
events which we are about to narrate took place, and
the scene is entirely in merry England.
The court and the country were at that period—with
the present we have nothing to do—two completely
distinct and separate climates; and while the wits and
the libertines, the fops and the soldiers, the poets and
the philosophers, of the reigns of Charles, James, Wil-
liam, and Anne, formed a world in which debauchery,
vice, strife, evil passion, rage, jealousy, and hatred
seemed the only occupations of genius, and the true

£ for talent; while Oxford and Cambridge had
eir contentions, and vied with the capital in nourish-
ing feuds and follies of their own, there was a calm
and quiet world apart, amid the shady brooks, and sunny
fields, and dancing streams of merry England; a world
which knew but little of the existence of the other, ex-
cept when the vices, or follies, or crimes of the world .
of the court called upon the world of the country to
resist the encroachments of its neighbour, and defend
its own quiet prosperity.
From the peasant who tilled the glebe, and whistled
to outsing the lark over his happy toil, up to the lord
of the manor, the knight whose many ancestors had all
been knights before him, the countrymen of England
mingled hardly, if at all, with the world of the metrop-
olis and of the court; except, indeed, when some as-
piring spirit, filled with good viands and a fair conceit,
raised his wishes to be knight of the shire, and sit in
parliament among the more courtly of the land; or else
when some borough sent its representative to the senate
to bring down strange tales of London life and fresh
fashions for the wives and daughters.
There was, indeed, a connecting link between the two
states of being we have described, afforded by the old
hereditary nobility of the land; many members of
which still lingered by the ancestral hall, as yet unal-
lured from the calm delights of rural life, and the digni-
fied satisfaction of dwelling among their own people, even
by all the amusements or luxuries of the capital. An
annual visit to London, an appearance in the court of
the sovereign and the House of Peers at certain times,
varied the existence of this class of men; and neither
liking, comprehending, nor esteeming the wits and fop-
lings of the metropolis, they returned well pleased to
hold their ancient state in the country, bearing renewed
importance among the county gentlemen around from
this fresh visit to the fountain of all honours and dis-
tinctions.
Great, indeed, was their importance among their neigh-
bours at all times; far greater than we in the present
day can well picture to ourselves; for, #: Of
the consequence acquired by spending large incomes
within a limited sphere, the feeling of feudal influence
was not extinct, though the fact had become a momen-
tity; and the tenantry on a great man's estate looked

up to him in those days with the greater veneration
and devotion because they were not compelled to do
so. Above the tenantry again, the squire and the ma-
gistrate, who not only owed a great part of their com-
fort in the county, their consideration with their neigh-
bours, and their estimation in their own eyes, to the
degree of favour in which they stood with the earl, the
marquis, or the duke, but who might at any time be ren-
dered uncomfortable and persecuted, if not oppressed
in case they forfeited his good graces, failed not to
show their reverence for him on every legitimate oc-
£" and sometimes, perhaps, went a little farther
SO. -
Thus, of the little hierarchy of the county, there was
generally some nobleman as the chief, and from him it
descended through baronets, lords of the manor, knights,
iustices, squires, and many an et catera down to the
owest class of all, who still looked up to that chief,
and would tell the passer-by, with much solemn truth,
that “the earl was quite a king in his own part of the
World.”
Among such classes, in such scenes, and at such a
period, took place the events about to be described.
At the door of a small, neat country inn stood gazing
forth a traveller one clear bright morning in the end of
the month of May. The hour was early: the matutinal
servants of the house were scarcely up; and Molly, with
mop and pail, was busily washing out the passage which
was soon to be thickly strewn with clean yellow sand.
The scene before the traveller's eyes was one on which
it is pleasant to dwell; the centre street of a small
country town, many miles from a great city. There
were a few light clouds in the sky, but they did not in-
terrupt the rays of the great orb of light, who was yet
low down in the heaven; and the shadows of the man-
- ifold white houses, with their peaked gables turned to.
wards the street, fell more than half across the road,
forming a fanciful pattern on the ground; the yellow
sunshine and the blue shade lying clear and distinct,
except where a little fountain burst forth half way down
the town, and mingled the two together.
It was, as I have said, a cool and pleasant scene for
the eye to rest upon; and even the casements of the
houses opposite, shaded by the close-drawn white cur-
tain, gave an idea of calm and happy repose. The

world within were all yet asleep; the toil, the anxiety,
the care, the strife of active life had not yet began.
The eye of the traveller rested upon the picture ap-
parently well pleased. It gazed contemplatively up the
street to where the road had been made to take a turn,
in order to avoid the brow of the gentle hill on which
the town was built; and which, crowned with houses
of pleasant irregularity, interrupted the farther view in
that direction; and then that eye turned downward to
the place where the highway opened out into the coun-
try beyond, after passing over a small bright stream by
a brick bridge of ancient date. Over the bridge was
slowly wending at the same moment a long line of cat-
tle, lowing as they went forth to pasture, with a herd
following in tuneful mood, and neither hurrying himself
nor them. The stranger's eye rested on them for a
single moment, but then roved on to the landscape
which was spread out beyond the bridge, and on it he
gazed as curiously as if he had been a painter.
On it, too, we must pause, for it has matter for our
consideration. The centre of the picture presented a
far view over a bright and smiling country, with large
masses of woodland, sloping up in blue lines to some tall
brown hills at the distance of ten or twelve miles. A
gleaming peep of the river was caught in the foreground,
with a sandy bank crowned with old trees; and above
the trees again appeared the high slated roofs of a man-
sion, whose strong walls, formed of large flints ce-
mented together, might also here and there be seen
looking forth, gray and heavy, through the green, light
foliage. Three or four casements, too, were apparent,
but not enough of the house was visible to afford any
sure indication of its extent, though the massiveness of
the walls, the width of the spaces between the win-
dows, the size of the roofs, and the multitude of the
chimneys, instantly made one mentally call it The Man-
or House.
This mansion seemed to be at the distance of about
a mile from the town; but upon a rising ground on the
opposite side of the picture, seen above bridge and trees,
and the first slopes of the offscape, appeared at the dis-
tance of seven or eight miles, or more, a large irregular
mass of building, apparently constructed of gray stone,
and in some places covered with ivy; at least, if one
might so interpret the dark stains apparent even at that

distance upon various parts of its face. There was a
deep wood behind it, from which it stood out conspicu-
ously, as the morning sun poured clear upon it; and in
front appeared what might either be a deer park filled
with stunted hawthorn and low chestnut trees, or a
wide common.
Such was the scene on which the traveller gazed, as,
standing in front of the deep double-seated porch of the
little inn, he looked down the road to the country be-
yond. There was no moving object before his eyes
but the herd passing over the bridge; there was no
sound but the lowing of the cattle, the whistling of their
driver, and a bright lark singing far up in the blue sky.
It is time, however, to turn to the traveller himself,
who may not be unworthy of some slight attention.
Certain it is that the good girl, who was now sprink-
ling the passage and porch behind him with fine sand,
thought that he was worthy of such; for though she
had seen him before, and knew his person well, yet
ever and anon she raised her eyes to gaze over his fig-
ure, and vowed, we believe, in her heart, that he was
as good-looking a youth as ever she had set eyes on.
His age might be five or six-and-twenty, and his
height, perhaps, five feet eleven inches. He was both
broad and deep-chested, that combination which ensures
the greatest portion of strength, with length and ease
of breath; and though his arms were not such as
would have called attention from their robustness, yet
they were evidently muscular and finely proportioned.
Thin in the flanks, and with the characteristic English
hollow of the back, his lower limbs were remarkably
powerful, ending, however, in a small, well-shaped foot
and ankle, set off to good advantage in the neat, close-
fitting shoe.
His countenance was as handsome as his figure, and
remarkably prepossessing; the features slightly aqui-
line; the colouring a rich brown, though the eyes were
found to be decidedly blue when fully seen through the
black lashes. His hair, waving round his face and curl-
ing upon his neck, was of a deep glossy brown, and the
fine-shaped lips, which, in their natural position, were
slightly open, showed beneath a row of even teeth as
white as snow. The brow was broad, straight, and
high, with the eyebrow, that most expressive of all the
*'''ng a wavy line of beauty, strongly marked

upon the clear skin, and growing somewhat thicker
and deeper above the inner canthus of the eye. Be-
tween the eyebrows, however, appeared the Lly thing
that the most fastidious critic of beauty could have ob-
jected to. It was a deep scar, evidently the mark of a
severe cut, whether received by accident in the jocund
days of boyhood, or in the manly sports of the country,
or in the field of battle, might be doubtful; but there it
rested for ever, a clear, long scar, beginning half way
up the forehead, and growing deeper as it descended,
till it formed a sort of indentation between the eye-
brows, similar to that produced in some countenances
by a heavy frown. Thus to look at the brow, one would
have said the face was stern; to look at the eyes, one
might have pronounced it thoughtful; but the bland,
good-humoured, cheerful smile upon the lips contra-
dicted both, and spoke of a heart which fain would have
been at ease, whose own qualities were all bright, and
warm, and gay, if the cares and strifes of the world
would but let them have way. -
We shall not pause long upon the stranger's dress.
It was principally composed of what was then called
brown kersey, a coarse sort of stuff used by the com-
mon people; but the buttons were of polished jet; the
linen remarkably fine; the hat, with its single straight
feather, set on with an air of smartness; while the fish-
ing-basket under the arm, and the rod in the hand, and
all the rest of an angler's paraphernalia conspicuous
upon the person, reconciled the homely dress with the
listinguished appearance. He was evidently boon for
the banks of the clear stream; and yet, though it was
the hour of all others which a fisherman should have
cultivated, he lingered for some minutes at the door of
the little inn, gazing, as we have depicted him, alter-
nately up and down the street, with a slow, meditative
look, as if enjoying the beauty of the morning and the
air scene around him. It is true that his eyes turned
most frequently and rested longest upon the bridge,
and stream, and old manor-house, with the wide country
beyond; but still he occasionally looked to the other
bend of the road, and once seemed to listen for some
sound.
He had at length taken one step forward, as if to pur-
sue his way, when the voice of the host of the Talbot,
good Gregory Myrtle, was heard coming down the

stairs, talking all the way for the benefit of any one
who might hear, with a fat, jovial, ale-burdened sound,
which, at other times and seasons, rejoiced the hearts
of many a “gay companion of the bowl.” The first in-
dication of his coming was a peal of laughter, a loud
“Haw, haw, haw !” at some conjugal joke uttered by
his dame as he left his chamber. -
“Well said, wife! well said:” he exclaimed, “it is
good to be fat; for, when I can no longer walk, I shall
easily be rolled; haw, haw, haw! Gads my life! I
must have these stairs propped, or else choose me a
chamber on the ground-floor. Sand the floor well,
Molly, sand the floor well! Think, were I to slip, what
a squelch would be there. Ha, Master Harry! hal” he
continued, seeing the stranger turn towards him; “how
was it I saw you not last night when you arrived?
You flinched the flagon, I fear me, Master Harry!
Nay, good faith, that was not right to old Gregory
Myrtle.”
“I was tired, good Gregory!” replied the stranger:
“I had ridden more than fifty miles to be here to-day,
and I wished to rise early, for the sake of my speckled
friends in the stream.”
“Ale keeps no man from rising,” cried the host.
“See how it has made me rise, like a pat of dough in
a baker's oven' haw, haw, haw !” and he patted his
own fat round paunch. “But whence come ye, Master
Harry 1 from the court, or the city, or the wars?” *
“From neither, Myrtle,” replied the stranger; “I
come from a great distance, to take my tithe of the
stream as usual. But how goes on the country since I
left it?”
“Well! mighty well!” answered the landlord, “all
just as it was, I think. No! poor old Milson, the sex-
ton, is dead; he had buried four generations of us, and
the fifth has buried him. He caught cold at the justice-
room, giving evidence about that robbery, you remem-
ber, out upon the moor, and took to his bed and died.”
“Which robbery do you mean?” demanded the other; .
“there were many going on about that time upon the
moor and over the hill. Have there been any lately?”
“Not one since you left the country, Master Harry,”
replied the landlord.
“I hope you do not mean to hint that I had any hand
in them,” rejoined his companion, with a smile.

“God forbid!” exclaimed good Gregory Myrtle,
“haw, haw, haw ! That was a funny slip of mine! No,
no, Master Harry, we know you too well; you are more
likely to give away all your own than take a bit of other
people's, God bless you.”
“I thinkindeed I am,” answered the young man, with
a sigh; “but, if I talk with you much longer, I shall be
too late to rob the stream of its trout. Don’t forget,
Myrtle, to send up to the manor for leave for me, as
usual. I suppose his worship is awake by this time, or
will be by the time my tackle is all ready;” and, so say-
ing, he sauntered on down the street, took the pathway
by the bridge, and, turning along the bank of the river,
was soon lost to the sight
CHAPTER II.
SoMETIMEs in bright sunny expanse over a broad shal-
low bed of glittering stones and sand; sometimes in
deep pools under high banks bending with shrubs and
trees; sometimes winding through a green meadow;
sometimes quick and fretful; sometimes slow and sul-
len, on flowed the little river on its course, like a
moody and capricious man amid all the various acci-
dents of life.
Beginning his preparations close to the bridge, upon
a low grassy bank which ran out from the buttress, and
afforded a passage round beneath the arches, the stran-
ger, whom the landlord had called Master Harry, had
not yet completed all the arrangement of his fishing-
tackle, when one of those servants who, in that day,
were as famous for a good-humoured idleness in the
great hall, as their successors are for an insolent idle-
ness in the present times, and were known by the fa-
miliar name of blue-bottles, made his appearance, carry-
ing his goodly personage with a quick step towards the
fisherman. The infinite truth generally to be found in
old sayings was never more happily displayed than in
the proverb, “Like master, like man!” and, if so, a
pleasant augury of the master's disposition was to be
derived from the demeanour of his messenger. As he
came near he raised his hand, touched his cap respect-

fully, though the fisherman was dressed in kersey;
and, with a grave complacent smile, wished him good-
morning. -
“Sir Walter gives you good-day, sir,” he said, “and
has told me to let you know that you are quite welcome
to fish the stream from Abbot's Mill to Harland, which,
God help us, is the whole length of the manor. He says
he has heard of your being here these two years, and
always asking leave and behaving consistent; and he
is but too happy to give such a gentleman a day or two’s
pleasure. Let me help you with the rod, sir; it is
somewhat Stiffish.”
The stranger expressed his thanks both to Sir Walter
Herbert for his permission and to the servant for his
assistance; and the blue-bottle, who had also a well-ex-
ercised taste for angling, stood and looked on and aided
till all was ready. By this time the day had somewhat
advanced, and the steps passing to and fro over the
bridge and along the road had become more frequent;
but they did not disturb the fisherman in his avocations;
and as he prepared to ascend the stream, whipping it as
he went with the light fly, the old servant turned to de-
part with one more “good-morning, sir;” adding, how-
ever, as he looked at a birding-piece which the stranger
carried across his shoulder, and then glanced his eye to
some red coots which were floating about upon the
stream, as familiarly as if they had been small farmers
of the water and held it under lease, “Perhaps, sir, you .
will be kind enough not to shoot the coots and divers;
Sir Walter likes to see them. On the river.”
“I would as soon think of shooting myself, my good
friend,” replied the other: “I have heard that poor
Lady Herbert was fond of them; and I would not repay
Sir Walter's permission so ill.”
The servant bowed and withdrew; and, as he passed
on, took off his hat reverentially to an old gentleman
and a young lady who were leaning over a low parapet-
wall flanking a terrace in the gardens just opposite the
bridge. The last words of the servant and the angler
had been overheard, and the result we may soon have
occasion to show.
We will not write a chapter upon angling It mat-
ters little to the reader whether the stranger caught few
or many fish, or whether the fish were large or small.
Suffice it to say that he "#" expert anglé, , that the

river was one of the best trout streams in England;
that the day was favourable; and, if the stranger did not
fill his basket with the speckled tenants of the stream,
it proceeded from an evil habit of occasionally forget-
ting what he was about, and spending many minutes
gazing alternately at the lordly mansion to be seen in
the distance, and the old manor-house beyond the bridge.
He came at length, however, to a spot where both were
shut out by the deep banks overhead, and there he soon
made up for lost time, though he still threw his line in
thoughtful mood, and seemed all too careless whether
the fish were caught or not.
It was their will, however, to be caught; but, at the
end of four or five hours' fishing, he was interrupted
again by the appearance of the same old servant, who
now approached, bearing on his arm a basket evidently
well laden.
“Sir Walter desired me to compliment you, sir,” he
said, “and to wish you good sport. He prays you, too,
to honour him by supping with him, for he will not in-
terrupt your fishing by asking you to dine. He has sent
you, however, wherewithal to keep off hunger and
thirst, and trusts you will find the viands good. Shall
I spread them out for you?”
There is no sport in the world better calculated to
promote the purposes of that pleasant enemy hunger,
than throwing the long light line over the clear brook;
and the angler, who, in the busy thoughts of other
things, had left chance to provide him with a dinner,
willingly availed himself of the good knight's hospitable
supply, and did ample justice to all that the basket con-
tained. But there was something more in his feelings
on this occasion than the mere gratification of an appe-
tite, though the satisfaction of our hunger has proved a
magnificent theme in the hands of our greatest epic
poets. *
There were other feelings; and there must always be
other feelings mingling with our animal impulses, in
order to dignify and elevate the needs that unite us with
the brute creation: there must be something which
links the earthly portion to the unearthly, something
that leads the thoughts from the mere act of the clay to
things less coarse, to brighter and purer affections. In
ancient days they wreathed the winecup with flowers,
and strewed the festal board with blossoms. Sweet

sounds and grateful odours have in all times accom-
panied the banquet; but few of those who drank and
feasted have known why; few have understood that the
immortal mind craved occupation of a higher kind,
while the body supplied its necessities. The brightest
and the tenderest friend of our earthly being is that
imagination which lends its splendid colouring to all we
do, and which, like the beneficent hand of nature itself,
clothes dust and ashes, and clouds and vapours, in
beauty and brightness not their own.
There were other feelings in the breast of the angler
as he sat down and partook of the viands provided for
him, which rendered those viands grateful to the mind
as well as to the body; and though the beauty of the
scene around, the freshness and splendour of the bright
spring day, the wooing of the soft air by the bank of the
river, the music of the waters as they glided by him,
and the carols of manifold birds in the neighbouring
woods, were all accessories which might well render a
meal tasted in the midst of them not only pleasant at
the time, but memorable in after days; yet there was
something more than all this which made the little
basket of provisions thrice agreeable to him; something
that made him believe he had been understood, as it
were intuitively, by the only persons he would have
stooped to seek in the neighbourhood, if he could have
stooped to seek any one; something, perhaps, beyond
that, which may or may not be rendered clear hereafter,
as the reader's eye is obscure or penetrating into the
secrets of the human heart and character. He re-
ceived, then, the gift with gladness, and sat down to
partake of it with something more than hunger. He
accepted willingly, also, the invitation he had received
to sup at the manor-house; and bestowing a piece of
money on the serving man, which amply repaid the pains
he had taken, he suffered him to depart, though not till
he had lured him down the stream to see several trout
brought out of the bright waters with as skilful a hand
as ever held a rod. * -
The fisherman was still going on after the old servant
had left him, when he was suddenly roused by a rust-
ling in the high-wooded bank above; and the moment
after he saw desceniing by a path, apparently not fre-
quently used, a personage upon whose appearance we
* - must dwell for a moment.

20 THE ROBBER.
The gentleman on whose person the fisherman's eyes
were immediately fixed was somewhere within the ill-
defined limits of that vaguë period of human life called
the middle age. None of his strength was gone, per-
haps none of his activity; but yet the traces of time's
wearing hand might be seen in the gray that was plen-
tifully mingled with his black hair, and in the furrows
which lay along his broad, strongly-marked brow. He
was well dressed, according to the fashion of that day;
and any one who has looked into the pictures of Sir
Peter Lely must have seen many such a dress as he
then wore without our taking the trouble of descri-
bing it.
That was a period of heavy swords and many weap-
ons; but the gentleman who now approached bore no-
thing offensive upon his person but a light blade, which
looked better calculated for show than use, and a small
valuable cane hanging at his wrist. There was a cer-
tain degree of foppery, indeed, about his whole appear-
ance, which accorded not very well with either his form
or his features. He was about the same height as the
angler whom we have before described, but much more
broadly made, with a chest like a mountain bull, and
long, sinewy arms and legs, whose swelling muscles
£ be discerned, clear and defined, through the white
stocking that appeared above his riding-boots. His
face was quite in harmony with his person, square cut,
with good, but somewhat stern features, large bright .
eyes flashing out from beneath a pair of heavy over-
hanging eyebrows, a well-shaped mouth, though some-
what too wide, and a straight nose, rather short, but not
remarkably so.
The complexion was of a deep tanned brown; and
there were many lines and furrows over the face, which
indicated that the countenance there presented was a
tableton which passion often wrote with a fierce and fiery
hand, leaving deep, uneffaceable traces behind: That
countenance, indeed, was one calculated to bear strong
expressions; and which, though changing rapidly un-
der the influence of varied feelings, still became worn
and channelled by each ; by the storm and the tempest,
the sunshine and the shower.
On the present occasion, the expression of his face
was gay, smiling, and good-humoured; and as he ap-
proached the angler, he exclaimed, with a laugh. “You

have dined well, Master Harry; and, methinks, had you
been generous, you might have saved me a nook of the
pie or a draught out of the bottle.”
“I did not know you were so near, Franklin,” an
swered the angler, somewhat gravely; “I thought you
would have met me at the Talbot this morning; and, not
finding you, I fancied that you had forgotten your prom-
ise.” -
* “I never forget a promise,” replied the other, sharply,
and with his brow beginning to lower: “I never forget
a promise, Master Harry, be it for good or evil. Had I
promised to blow your brains out, I would have done it;
and, having promised to meet you here this morning,
here I am.”
“Do not talk such nonsense to me, Franklin, about
blowing men's brains out,” replied the angler, calmly;
“such things do not do with me ! I know you better,
my good friend! But what prevented you from com
ing?” -
“You do not know me better!” replied the other,
sharply. “If I ever said I would blow your brains out
—the which God forbid—by the rood I would do it;
and as to what has kept me, I have been here since
yesterday morning seeing what is to be done. I tell
you, Master Harry, that the time is come; and that, i
we lay our plans well, we may strike our great stroke.
within the next three days. I had my reasons, too, for
not coming up to the Talbot; but you go back there,
and hang about the country as if you had no thought
but of fishing or fowling. Have your horses ready,
fresh and well fed for action at a moment's notice, and
I will find means to give you timely warning. You
know my boy Jocelyn ! ... When you see him about, be
sure that there is something to be done; find means to
give him a private hearing instantly, and have your arms
and horses, as I have said, all prepared.”
While the other was speaking, the angler had laid
down his rod on the bank, and, crossing his arms upon
his chest, had fixed his fine thoughtful eyes full calmly
and steadfastly upon his companion. “Franklin,” he
said at length, “I trust you to a certain point in the
conduct of this business, but no farther; . I trust you
because I believe you to be faithful, bold, active, and
shrewd. But remember, there is a point where we
must stop. What is it you propose to do? I am * -

one to be led blindfold even by you, Gray; and I re-
member but too well that, when in other lands fortune
cast our lots together, you were always bent upon some
wild and violent enterprise, where the risk of your own
life seemed to compensate in your eyes for the wrong
you at times did to others. Forgive me, Gray, but I
must speak plainly. You have promised, you have of-
fered to do me a great service; the greatest, perhaps,
that man could render me; but you have not told me
how it is to be done; and there must be no violence.”
“Not unless we are obliged to use it in our own de
fence,” replied the other, sharply. “As to the rest,
Master Harry, the enterprise is mine as well as yours:
so do not make me angry, or you may chance to fail
altogether, and find Franklin Gray as bad an enemy as
he can be a good friend.”
“No threats, Franklin,” replied the other; “you
should know that threats avail not with me. I thank
you deeply for all your kindness, Franklin, but neither
gratitude nor menaces can lead me blindfold. Years have
passed since in the same high and noble cause, and under
the same great, good man, we fought together on the
banks of the Rhine; and you seem to have forgotten
that even then, boy as I was, neither threats nor per-
suasions would move me to do anything I judged—
though, perhaps, falsely-to be really wrong. A change
has come over you, Gray, but no change has come
over me. I am the same, and will remain the same.”
“Did you not promise to leave the conduct of this to
me?” cried his companion. “Did you not promise to
submit to my guidance therein But never mind! I
give you back your promise. Break it all off! Let us
art. Go, and be a beggar. Lose all your hopes, and
eave me to follow my own course. I care not! But
I will not peril my neck for any dastard scruples of
yours.” -
“Dastard!” exclaimed the other, taking a step to-
wards him, and half drawing his sword out of the sheath
with the first impulse of indignation, while his brow
contracted so as to cover entirely the deep scar be-
tween his eyes. “Dastard! such a word to me!”
“Ay, to you, or any one,” replied Franklin Gray, lay-
ing his hand upon the hilt of his sword also, as if about
to draw it instantly, while his dark eye flashed and his
lip quivered under the effects of strong passion.

The next impulse, however, was to gaze for a moment
in the countenance of his young opponent; the expres-
sion of anger passed away; and, withdrawing his hand
from the hilt, he threw his arms round the other, ex-
claiming, “No, no, Harry! We must not quarrel! We
must not part! at least not till I have fulfilled all I prom-
ised. I have nursed you as a baby on my knee; I have
stood beside you when the bullets were flying round our
heads like hail; I have lain with you in the same prison;
and for your own sake, as well as for those that are
gone, I will serve you to the last; but you must not
forget your promise either. Leave the conduct of this
matter to me, and, on my soul, I will use no violence,
I will shed no blood, except in our own defence Even
then they shall drive me to the last before I pull a
trigger.”
“Well, well,” replied the other, “I will trust you,
Franklin, though I have had many a doubt and hesita-
tion lately.”
“Did you not promise your mother on her deathbed,”
demanded the other, straining both his companion's
hands in his; “did you not solemnly swear to her to
follow my suggestions, to put yourself under my gui-
dance till the enterprise was achieved!”
“I did, I did!” replied the angler. “I did; but then
you promised, freely and frankly, to accomplish the ob-
ject that was at that moment dearest to her heart; and
I had no doubt, I had no fear as to the means. I cer-
tainly did so promise my poor mother; but, when she
exacted that promise, you and I were both differently
situated; and I fear me, Franklin, I fear me that you
are overfond of strife; that you are following paths full
of danger to yourself; and that you will not be con-
tented till you have brought evil on your own head.”
“Pshaw,” replied his companion, turning away.
“That is my affair; I will leave the more maudlin part
of the business to you; let me have the strife, if there
should be any; but remember your promise, Harry,
and let this be the last time that we have such fruitless
words.” - k
The other made no reply; and Franklin, after gazing
on him moodily for a moment, cast himself down upon
the bank, and asked, “How do you bestow yourself to-
night?”

“I am invited to sup at the manor-house with Sir
Walter Herbert,” replied the angler; “and I shall go.”
“Go, to be sure !” exclaimed his companion; “it
may serve us more than anything. Have you ever seen
Sir Walter l’” -
“At a distance,” replied the other; “but I never spoke
to him. I know him well, however, by repute. They
tell me he has fallen into some difficulties.”
“From which, perhaps, you may help him,” said
Franklin, thoughtfully.
“Perhaps I may,” answered the angler, in the same
tone; “perhaps I may if I can discover how it may best
be done; but, at present, I only know that difficulties ex-
ist, without knowing why or how; for the estates are
princely. However, if within my reach, I will try to
aid him, whether fortune ever turns round a l smiles
upon me or not; for I hear he is as noble a gentleman
as ever lived.”
“Ay, and has a fair daughter,” answered his compan-
ion, with a smile. “You have seen her, I suppose?”
“Never,” replied the angler; “I saw her mother
once, who was still very lovely, though she was ill then,
and died ere the month was out.”
“Go! go!” cried his companion, after a moment's
thought; “go to-night, by all means; I feel as if good
would come of it.” *
“I do not know how that can be,” said the other, mu-
sing, “but still I will go; though you know that, in my
situation, I think not of men's fair daughters,”
“Why not?” asked Franklin Gray, quickly, “why
not? What is the situation in which woman and wo-
man's love may not be the jewel of our fate? What
is the state or condition that she may not beautify, or
soften, or inspirit ! Oh! Harry, if you did but know all,
you would see that my situation is, of all others, the
one in which woman can have the least share; and yet,
what were I; what would I become, were it not for the
one, the single star that shines for me on earth? When
the fierce excitement of some rash enterprise is over;
when the brow aches, and the heart is sick and weary,
you know not what it is to rest my head upon her bosom,
and hear the pulse within that beats for me alone. You
know not what it is, in the hours of temporary idleness,
to sit by her side, and see her eyes turn thoughtfully from
our child to me, and from me to him, and seem busy

with the strange mysterious link that unites us three
together. Why, I say, should you not think of woman's
love, when you, if not riches, have peace to offer; when,
if not splendour, you have an honest name? I tell you,
Henry Langford, that when she chose me I was an un-
known stranger in a foreign land; that there were
strange tales of how and why I sought those shores;
that I had naught to offer but poverty and a bold warm
heart. She asked no question; she sought no explana-
tion; she demanded not what was my trade, what were
my prospects, whither I would lead her, what should
be her after fate. She loved and was beloved; for
her, that was enough; and she left friends and kindred,
and her bright native land, comfort, soft tendance, lux-
ury, and splendour, to be the wife of a houseless wan-
derer with a doubtful name. He had one thing to give
her in return—his whole heart; and it is hers.”
His companion gazed earnestly in his face as he spoke,
and then suddenly grasped his hand. “Franklin,” he
said, “you make me sad; your words scarce leave me
a doubt of what I have long suspected.” -
“Ask me no questions,” exclaimed the other; “you
have promised to ask no questions.” -
“Neither do I,” rejoined his companion. “What
you have said scarcely renders a question needful.
Franklin, when several years ago we served with the
French army on the Rhine, and when first you showed
that interest in me, which was strange, till my poor
mother's sad history explained it in some degree, you
promised me solemnly that if ever you should need
money you would share my purse, which, however
scanty, has still been more than sufficient for my wants.”
“But I have never needed it!” interrupted the other.
“The time has not come! When it does, I will.”
“You trifle with me, Franklin,” rejoined his compan-
ion; “if you betake you to rash acts and dangerous en-
terprises, as your words admit—” -
“I may be moved,” said Franklin Gray, again inter-
- rupting him, “I may be moved by a thousand other
- causes than the need of money: the love of activity,
“. . the restlessness of my nature, habits of danger and en-
# *erprise-” -

all that may hurt or injure her. Think, Franklin, think,
if you were to fail in some of these attempts; if—if–
You are moved; think what would be her fate; think
what would be her feelings; nay, listen to me: share
what I have, Franklin. It is enough for us both if we
be but humble in our thoughts and—”
But the other broke away from him with a sudden
start, and something like a tear in his eye. “No, no!”
he cried, “no, no!” but then again he turned, ere he had
reached the top of the bank, and said, in a low but dis-
tinct voice, “Harry, if I succeed in this enterprise for
you and in your favour, you shall have your way.”
“But no violence?” replied the angler; “remember, I
will have no violence.”
“None,” rejoined Franklin Gray, “none; for I will
take means to overawe resistance; and we will, as we
well and justly may, enforce your rights and laugh them
to scorn who have so long opposed them; and all with-
out violence, if possible.” But the latter words were
uttered in a low tone, and were unheard by his com-
panion.

CHAPTER III.
PERHAPs the sweetest hour of a sweet season is that
which precedes the setting of the sun upon a May day.
All the world is taking holyday, from the lowing herd
that winds slowly o'er the lea, to the shardborn beetle
and the large white moth. The aspect of the sky and
earth too—clear, calm, and tranquil—are full of repose.
The mistiness of the midday sunshine is away; and
the very absence of a portion of the full daylight, and
the thin colourless transparency of the evening air, af.
ford that contemplative, but no way drowsy charm
which well precedes, by thought tending to adoration,
the hour when, in darkness and forgetfulness, we trust
ourselves unconscious to the hands of God. The heart
of man is but as an instrument from which the great
musician, Nature, produces grand harmonies; and the
most soothing anthem that rises within the breast is
surely elicited by the soft touch of that evening hour.

It had shone calm over the world in those scenes we
have lately described, and the last moments of the sun's
stay above the horizon were passing away, while, within
one of the rooms of the old manor-house of Moorhurst
Park, the father and the daughter were sitting tranquilly
in the seat of a deep window, gazing over the beautiful
view before their eyes, and marking all the wonderful
changes of colouring which the gradual descent of the
sun and the slow passing of a few light evening clouds
brought each moment over the scene. There is in al-
most every heart some one deep memory, some one
powerful feeling, which has its harmonious connexion
with a particular hour and with a particular scene; and,
as the father and the daughter gazed, and marked the
sun sinking slowly in the far west, one remembrance,
one image, one sensation, took possession of both their
bosoms. The daughter thought of the mother, the
father of the wife, that was lost to them for ever.
Neither spoke: both tried to suppress the feeling, or,
rather, to indulge the feeling while they suppressed its
expression. But such efforts are vain, at least with
hearts untutored by the cold policies of a superficial
world. A tear glistened in the daughter's eye, and she
dared not wipe it away lest it should be remarked.
The father's eye, indeed, was tearless, but his brow was
sad; and as he withdrew his gaze from the scene before
him, and turned his looks upon his daughter, it was with
a sigh. He marked, too, the bright drop that still hung
trembling on her eyelid, catching the last ray of the
setting sun; and, knowing the spring whence that drop
arose, he cast his arms around her, and pressed her in
silence to his breast.
At that very moment, however—for it is still at the
time when the deep shy feelings of the warmest hearts
peep forth to enjoy some cool secluded hour, that the
world is sure to burst upon them, like the cry of the
beagles upon the timid hare—at that very moment one
of the servants opened the door of the chamber, and
announced Captain Henry Langford. Sir Walter Her-
bert withdrew his arms from his daughter, and took a
step forward; and Alice Herbert, though she felt pre-
possessed in their visiter's favour, felt also almost vexed
that he had come so soon to interrupt the sweet but
melancholy feelings which were rising in her father's
heart and in her own. She gazed with some interest

towards the door, however; and the next instant the
angler, whose course through the day we have already
traced, entered the apartment. Rod, and line, and fish-
ing-basket had been by this time thrown aside, and he
stood before them well, but not gayly dressed, with
scrupulous neatness observable in every part of his ap-
parel, and with his wavy brown hair arranged with some
care and attention.
His air was distinguished, and not to be mistaken;
his person was, as we have before said, eminently hand-
some; so that, although a stranger to both the father
and daughter, he bore with him a letter of recommen-
dation of a very prepossessing kind.
As he entered, Sir Walter Herbert advanced to meet
him with the calm dignity of one who, in former years,
had mingled with courts and camps; and who felt within
his breast the easegiving consciousness of a noble and
an upright mind; and he was met by the stranger with
the same bearing.
Sir Walter, though not usually familiar, offered him
his hand, saying, “Captain Langford, I am very glad to
see you; and must explain how it is that I took the lib-
erty of sending you the invitation that has procured me
this pleasure. Without intending to act the part of
eavesdroppers, my daughter and myself overheard this
morning the conclusion of a conversation between you
and one of my servants regarding some birds that float
about upon the stream; and the few words that fell
from you on that occasion breathed a spirit which gave
me too strong a temptation to be resisted of seeking
your acquaintance, even at the risk of intruding upon
the calm and tranquil solitude which you, who are,
doubtless, a denizen of cities and courts, seek, in all
probability, when you venture into the country.”
“It could be no intrusion, sir,” replied his guest;
“and let me assure you that, in forbidding me to shoot
the wildfowl on the stream, your servant imposed upon
me no hard condition. Those birds have been a sort
of companions to me during my sport for these two or
three years past, and I should never have thought of
injuring them; but would still less have wished to do
so when I knew that you took a pleasure and an inter-
est in them.” -
“They are associated with past happiness,” said Sir
Walter; “and, though I believe it is foolish to cling to


## p. 29 (#31) ##############################################

THE ROBBER. 29
things which only awaken regret, yet I confess I do
take a pleasure, a sad pleasure, perhaps, in seeing
them.”
“I cannot but think,” replied his guest, ‘‘that there
are some regrets far sweeter than all our every-day en-
joyments. The only real pleasures that I myself now
possess are in memories, because my only attachments
are with the past.” -
“You are very young to say so, sir,” answered Sir
Walter; “you must, at an early age, have broken many
Sweet ties.”
“But one,” replied Langford; “for, through life, I
have had but one, that between mother and a son; but,
of course, it broke with the greater pain from being
the only one.”
“And your father?” demanded Sir Walter.
“I never knew him,” replied the stranger; and, see-
ing that the conversation might grow painful, Sir Walter
Herbert dropped it; and, turning to his daughter, pre-
sented the stranger to her, which he had neglected to
do before. -
It might be that, as the old knight did so, the remem-
brance of what had passed not long before, regarding
the beautiful girl to whom he was now introduced,
called the colour rather more brightly into Langford's
face; and, certainly, it produced a slight degree of em-
barrassment in his manner, which he had never felt on
such an occasion before. She was, certainly, very
beautiful, and that beauty of a very peculiar cast. It
was the bright and sunshiny, united with the deep and
touching. Her skin was clear and exquisitely fair;
her lips full, but beautifully formed; the brow broad
and white; and the eyes of that soft peculiar hazel,
which, when fringed with long black lashes, perhaps is
more expressive than any other colour. The hair,
which was very full and luxuriant, was of a brown-
several shades lighter than Langford's own—soft and
glossy as silk, and catching a golden gleam in all the
prominent lights. She was not tall, but her form was
perfectly well proportioned, and every full and rounded
limb was replete with grace and symmetry.
Langford's slight embarrassment wore off in a mo-
ment, and the conversation turned upon more general
themes than those with which it begun. Sir Walter
and his daughter, from the few words they had heard in

the morning, undoubtedly expected to find in their guest
high and kindly feelings, and that grace, too, which
such feelings always afford to the demeanour and con-
versation of those who possess them. But they found
much more than they had expected; a rich and culti-
wated mind, great powers of conversation, much spark-
ling variety of idea, and an inexhaustible fund of expe.
rience and information regarding many things whereof
they themselves, if not ignorant, had but a slight knowl-
edge, and which he had gained apparently by travel-
ling far and long in foreign countries, and by mingling
with many classes and descriptions of men. There
were few subjects on which he could not speak; and,
on whatever he did speak, there was something more
displayed than mere ordinary judgment. The heart
had its part as well as the understanding, and a bright
and playful imagination linked the two together.
Had Sir Walter Herbert and his daughter felt inclined
to be distant and reserved towards the stranger whom
they had invited, they could not have maintained such
* 3. demeanour long; for he was one of those who ap-
plí r admittance to every door of the human heart,
and sure to find some entrance; but when, on the
contrary, they were predisposed to like and esteem him,
even the first slight chilness of new acquaintance was
speedily done away; and, ere he had been an hour in
the house, the reciprocation of feeling and ideas had
made them far more intimate with him than with many
persons whom they had known for long and uninter-
rupted years.
Music was talked of, and painting, and sculpture; and
in each Langford, without affecting the tone of a con-
noisseur, displayed that knowledge which is gained
rather by a deep feeling for all that is fine and beautiful
than from an experimental acquaintance with the arts
themselves. He had heard Lulli, and had been present
when some of his most celebrated compositions had
been first performed; and, though he talked not of the
scientific accuracy of this piece of music or of that, he
spoke with enthusiasm of the effect which each pro-
duced upon the mind; of what feelings they called up,
whether they soothed, or inspired, or touched, or sad
dened, or elevated.
Then, again, when the conversation turned to the
sculpture or the painting of Florence or of Rome, he

did not, perhaps he could not, use the jargon of con-
noisseurs; he did not speak of breadth, and juice, and
contour, but he told of how he had been affected by the
sight, of what were the sensations produced in his bo-
som, and in the bosoms of others whom he had known,
by the Venus, or the Apollo, or the Laocoon, or the
works of Raphael, or Guido, or Titian, or Michael An
gelo. In short, he dwelt upon that part of the subject
which referred to the mind, the imagination, or the
heart; and in regard to which all those who heard him
could go along with him, feeling, comprehending, and
enjoying all he spoke of or described.
Alice Herbert, though she was not learned in such
things, yet had a natural taste which was not unculti-
vated. In the seclusion in which she dwelt, the ordi-
nary household duties of a young Englishwoman of that
period had not been enough for her; and her mind had
been occupied with much and various reading, with
music, as it was then known and taught, and with
drawing; though in the latter art she had received no
instruction but from her mother, who had acquired it
herself while in exile at the court of France. Her fa-
ther, also, had some taste in and much feeling for the
arts, and she joined eagerly in the conversation between
him and Langford, often leading it, with the sportive
eagerness of a young and enthusiastic mind, to a thou-
sand collateral subjects, which constantly elicited from
their new companion remarks full of freshness and of
genius. *
She listened, well pleased; something more than
well pleased, struck and surprised: and from that
night's interview she bore away matter for deep thought
and meditation; the most favourable effect that man
can produce when he wishes to make an impression on
the heart of woman.
Did Langford seek to produce such an effect? Per-
haps not; or, most likely, he would not have suc-
ceeded so well; but he was pleased himself; he, too,
was struck and surprised; and, carried away by his own
feelings, he took unconsciously the best means of inter-
esting hers.
But the interview ended not so soon; and they had
scarcely sat down to the evening meal when a fourth
person was added to the party. He came in unan-
nounced, and seemed to be a familiar and a favoured

guest Young, handsome, and prepossessing, with a
frank and noble countenance, an air full of ease and
grace, and an expression in some degree thoughtful
rather than sad, his coming, and the hour and manner
in which he came, seemed to Henry Langford a warm-
ing that, if there were a daydream dawning in his bo-
som in regard to the sweet girl by whom he sat, it
would be better to extinguish it at once. But feelings
such as he had never experienced before came across
his bosom ; an eager and irritable anxiety, an inclina-
tion to retire into himself, and to watch the conduct of
those around him; a tendency, whether he would or
not, to be ungracious, not alone towards the stranger,
but towards all; such were the strange and new sen-
sations which he experienced. There is no stronger
indication of a new passion having begun to take a hold
of our heart, than a change in our ordinary sensations
in regard to things apparently trifling. Langford was a
great inquisitor of his own bosom, and by that inquisi-
tion had, through life, saved himself from much pain.
The examination in the present instance was made in
a minute; and, before the stranger had come round, and
had been introduced to himself, he had asked his own
heart more than one keen question. He had demanded
why he felt displeased at any addition to their party at
all; why he felt disposed to deny to the stranger those
graces of person and manner which he certainly pos-
sessed, and which were at once discernible; why he
watched so eagerly the manner in which Sir Walter
received him; why he gazed so intently upon Alice
Herbert's cheek, to see if the telltale blood would rise
up in it, and betray any secret of the heart. He
asked himself all these questions in a moment, and sud-
denly felt that he had been dreaming; ay, dreaming
sweet dreams without knowing it. He banished them
in a moment.
Sir Walter received the stranger kindly and familiar-
ly, though with a slight degree of stateliness, which was
from time to time observable in his demeanour to all.
It was a stateliness evidently not natural to him, for
his character was frank and kindly; and this, perhaps,
was the only little piece of affectation that shaded—for
it did not stain—a mind all gentleness, and warmth,
and affection. He shook hands warmly with the young
man, called him Edward, and suffered him to go round

to shake hands with his daughter before he introduced
him to their guest. While he did speak with Alice
Herbert we have said that Langford's eye was fixed
upon her cheek. It betrayed nothing, however: the
colour varied not by a shade; and, though the lips smiled
and the eye sparkled as she welcomed him, there was
no agitation to be remarked. -
Langford was accustomed to read other hearts as
well as his own, and the translation he put upon the in-
dications he beheld was, not that there was no love be-
tween the stranger and Alice Herbert, but that the pe
riod of emotion was past. He was not usually an un
skilful reader of hearts; but in interpreting that book it
is necessary to take care that no passion in our own
breast puts a false gloze upon the text. Whether such
was the case in the present instance will be seen here-
after; but, at all events, the knowledge Langford speed-
ily obtained of what his own feelings might become
taught him to regulate and restrain them. He resolved
that the coming of the stranger should produce no
change in his demeanour; that he would not forget the
suavity of his manner, or let any one around remark an
alteration which to them would be unaccountable, and
which he never could have an opportunity of explain-
1ng. - -
After having given his visiter an opportunity of speak-
ing for a moment to his daughter, Sir Walter Herbert
introduced him to Captain Langford, saying, “Captain
Langford, Lord Harold, the son of our good neighbour
on the hill. Edward, Captain Langford, one whom I
know you will esteem.”
Langford gazed upon the new guest earnestly; but,
whatever were his first thoughts, his mind almost im-
mediately reverted to Lord Harold's situation in regard
to Alice Herbert. The words in which the young no-
bleman's introduction to himself was couched, even
more than what he had seen before, made him say in
his own heart, “The matter is settled. Idle dreams :
idle dreams! I thought I had held imagination with a
stronger rein.”
Lord Harold unslung his sword, and, giving it to one
of the servants to hang it up behind the door, he sat
down to supper with the party, and the conversation
was renewed. The new guest looked at Langford more
than once with a keen and scrutinizing expression

though his countenance was not of a cast with which
that expression suited, the natural one being of a frank
and open character, with somewhat of indecision about
the mouth, but an air of sternness, perhaps of fierce-
ness, upon the brow. There was nothing in it, how-
ever, either very shrewd or penetrating; but, neverthe-
less, such a look was not uncalled for; for, the moment
that Langford resumed his seat after bowing to Lord
Harold on their introduction, he turned deadly pale, and
remained so for several minutes.
It might be that there was a struggle going on within
to overcome himself, which none of those present knew
or understood; but the outward expression thereof was
quite sufficient to call the attention of the whole party;
and it was, as we have said, some time before he had
sufficiently mastered himself to resume the conversation
with spirit. Even when he did so, there was a tone of
sadness mingled with it, which rendered it quite differ-
ent from what it had been before. It was no longer
the gay, the sparkling, the playful. It was no longer
the mountain current, rushing over a clear and varied
bed, now eddying round every larger object in its course,
now rippling brightly over the pebbles, which it seemed
to gild as it flowed among them; but it had become a
deep stream, strong, powerful, and, though still clear
# rapid, yet calm, and shady, and dark, from its very
epth.
£a Harold took his part in the conversation well
and gracefully. A high education and an early ac-
quaintance with the court, which had polished but not
spoiled him, acting upon a heart originally good, feel-
ing, and generous, had improved what powers of mind
he possessed as far as possible. His talents were, how-
ever, evidently inferior to those of Langford; and
though he himself, apparently, was as much struck with
the charm of the other's conversation as either Sir
Walter or his daughter had been, yet he felt he was
far surpassed by the new guest at the Manor House;
and besides that sensation, which is in itself a heavy
burden to be borne by those who seek to please, there
was an indescribable something in Langford's presence
which put a restraint upon him, and even made him
bend down his glance before that of the stranger. It
was late before any one prepared to depart, and the
first who did so was Langford. He took leave of Sir

Walter with graceful thanks for his hospitality and kind-
ness, and the old knight expressed a hope that they
should see him several times again before he left the
country; adding, “Of course you do not mean to limit
your angling to one day.”
“I really do not know,” replied Langford, with a
somewhat melancholy smile; “I may be summoned to
the capital at a moment's notice; but, at all events, I
shall not fail to pay my respects here before I go. I
will take your hint, Sir Walter, as a permission to con-
tinue my depredations on the trout.”
“As often and as much as you please,” rejoined the
old knight. “The stream, as far as my manor extends,
shall always contribute to your sport.”
“I hope,” said Lord Harold, taking a step forward
with graceful courtesy, “that Captain Langford will not
make Sir Walter's manor the boundary. Our land's
march, and the stream which flows on beyond, my fa-
ther will make as much at his service as that in Sir
Walter's property is already.”
Langford thanked him, though somewhat coldly; but,
after he had taken leave of Miss Herbert, he turned to
Lord Harold, and advanced as if to shake hands with
him; then suddenly seemed to recollect himself, and,
wishing him good-night in a more distant manner, left
the apartment.
Lord Harold remained behind for nearly an hour, and
the conversation naturally rested on him who had just
left them. The young nobleman praised him with a
sort of forced praise, which evidently sprang more from
candour and the determination to do justice than from
really liking him. Sir Walter spoke of him warmly
and enthusiastically, declaring he had seldom met any
one at all equal to him. Alice Herbert said little, but
what she did say was very nearly an echo of her fa-
ther's opinion. After his character, his appearance,
his manners, and his talents had been discussed, his
state of fortune and history became the subjects of con-
jecture. Lord Harold was surprised when he heard that
the Knight of Moorhurst had invited an unknown angler
to his table, and had introduced him to his daughter;
and, though he said nöthing, yet Sir Walter marked the
expression of his countenance, and was somewhat net-
tled that the young man, even in thought, should com-
ment on his conduct.

Lord Harold, however, soon obliterated any evil Im.
pression from the mind of the kindhearted old knight,
and, turning the conversation to other things, his spirits
seemed to rise after Langford was gone, and he found
opportunity of whispering a word or two in Alice Her-
bert's ear. Whatever words those were, they seemed
to take her much by surprise, for she started, turned
pale, then coloured highly; and, after a few minutes
passed in what seemed uneasy silence, she rose and re-
tired to rest. Lord Harold gazed for a moment or two
upon the ground, then looked earnestly at Sir Walter,
as if there had been something in his mind that he
would fain have spoken; but, in the end, apparently ir-
resolute, he took down his sword, gave orders to a ser-
vant to have his horse brought round, and, taking leave
of the good knight, mounted and galloped away, followed
by two attendants.
The moon had just gone down, but the night was clear,
and the heavens sparkling with a thousand stars. Lord
Harold's way lay through some thick woods for about
two miles, and then descended suddenly to the bank of
the stream, where the trees fell away and left the bright
waters wandering on through a soft meadow. As the
young nobleman issued forth from among the planta-
tions, he saw a tall dark figure standing by the river,
with the arms crossed upon the chest, and the eyes ap-
parently bent upon the waters. The sound of the
horses’ feet caused the stranger to turn; and, although
the darkness of the night prevented Lord Harold from
distinguishing his features, the whole form and air at
once showed him that it was Langford. He wished
him good-evening as he passed in a courteous tone, .
and was pulling up his horse to add some common ob-
servation; but Langford did not seem to recognise
him; and, merely wishing him “Good-night.” in an-
swer to his salutation, turned away and walked down
the stream.

CHAPTER IV.
THERE has scarcely been a poet or a prose writer, in
any country or in any tongue, who has not first declared
that there is nothing like love, and then attempted to
liken it to something. The truth is, that fine essence
is compounded of so many sweet things, that, though
we may find some resemblance to this or that peculiar
quality, which forms a part, we shall find nothing which
can compare with the whole; nothing so bright, nothing
so sweet, nothing so entrancing, nothing so ennobling;
must we add, nothing so rare? Every fool and every
villain impudently fancies that he can love, without
knowing that his very nature renders it impossible to
him. Every libertine and every debauchee talks of
love, without knowing that he has destroyed, in his own
bosom, the power of comprehending what love is; that
he has shut down and battened the pure fountain that
can never be opened again. Every one who can feel a
part of love-and that, in general, the coarser part—be-
lieves that he has the high privilege of loving; as
though a man were to drink the mere lees, and call
it wine. Oh no ! How infinite are the qualities requi-
site, each giving strength, and vigour, and fire to the
other! There must be a pure and noble heart, capable
of every generous and every ardent feeling; there must
be a grand and comprehensive mind, able to form and
receive every elevated thought and fine idea; there
must be a warm and vivid imagination, to sport with,
and combine, and brighten every beautiful theme of
fancy; there must be a high and unearthly soul, giving
the spirit's intensity to the earthly passion. Even when
all this is done, it is but a sweet melody; the harmony
is incomplete, till there be another being tuned alike,
and breathing, not similar, but responsive tones. Then,
and not till then, there may be love. Man, lay thy hand
upon thy heart, and ask thyself, “Is it not so with me?”
If so, happy, thrice and filly happy art thou. If not,
strive that it may be so; for, rightly felt, the most en-
nobling of all earthly impulses is love.
The night that we have seen commence passed over
WoL. I.- -

not tranquilly to any of the party which had been as-
sembled at the Manor House. Alice Herbert laid her
sweet limbs down on the couch which had so often
brought her calm soft slumbers, but it was long ere she
closed her eyes; and, before she did so, there dropped
from them some tears. Sir Walter lay upon his bed-
and thought, and a single sentence will show the sub-
ject of his meditation. “Poor boy,” he said, in a low
tone, after thinking long, “he is doomed to disappoint-
ment.”
Lord Harold tossed in feverish anxiety; and for many
an hour Langford cooled his burning brow by the night
air on the banks of the stream. Day was fast dawning,
when he prepared to return to the inn; but, ere he had
crossed the bridge, a boy of ten years of age or there-
about, with fair curling hair and a sunny countenance
crossed his path, saying quickly, “My master waits to
speak with you.” -
“Where is he, Jocelyn?” demanded Langford.
“In the thick wood in the manor park,” replied the
boy, “just above the stream; but I will show you.”.
“Go on!” said Langford; and they were both soon
hidden by the trees.
The park of the old Manor House, in its laying out
and arrangement, resembled the period of our tale;
that is to say, it lay between two epochs. There was
still, in the neighbourhood of the house, the old trim
flower-garden, with its rows of sombre yew-trees;
there was also that more magnificent kind of billiard-
table in which our robust ancestors used to take delight,
the bowling-green; there were also several long alleys
of pine and beech, carried as far as the inequality of
the ground would permit; but then, beyond that again,
came the park scenery, in which we now delight; the
deep wood, the dewy lawns, the old unpruned trees,
with every here and there a winding walk, cut neatly
among the old roots and stems, and taking advantage of
all the most beautiful points of view. But we will
dwell on such matters no longer; it is with pictures of
the human heart that we have to do.
. The dew was still upon the turf in the bowling-green
and in the long grassy walks of the flower-garden
when Alice Herbert came forth to take her mornin
ramble alone. She was fond of tasting the fresh air #
the early day; and enjoyed, as much as ever poet or

painter did, the varied lights and shades cast by the
rising sun over the world; lights and shades like the
fitful visions of our boyhood, when the rising sun of life
renders all the shadows longer and deeper, and the
brightness doubly bright. In these morning expedi-
tions, when she went forth to enrich one hour of her
young life with treasures from the bosom of nature-
treasures which she stored up, hardly knowing that she
did so, to be employed, long after £e gained, in
decorating and embellishing all her being—there was
scarcely anything that met her eye, or any sound that
met her ear, that was not marked and thought of; ex-
amined and commented upon; played with, embellished,
and illustrated by her rich and poetical imagination.
The fluttering butterfly that passed before her was not
remarked for the beauty of its colouring alone; but
fancy found in it an image of a thousand other things;
the mind moralized upon it, and the heart took the les-
son home. The clouds even, the slow fanciful clouds,
as, writhing themselves into strange shapes, they floated
over the spring sky, sweeping lightly with their blue
shadows the soft bosom of the earth, gave equal food
for imagination, and induced manifold trains of thought;
and in the lark's clear melody the ear of Alice Herbert
heard something more than merely sweet sounds: her
heart joined in his anthem; her thoughts took the mu-
sical tone of his sweet song; and her spirit rose upon
his wings towards the gates of heaven.
It often happened that, in these walks, her father bore
her company, and it was always a joy and satisfaction
to her when he did so; for between father and daughter
there was that perfect reciprocity of feeling that made
it delightful to her to be able to pour forth in his ear all
the thoughts that sprang up from her heart; and to
hear, as she leaned clinging to his arm, all the sweet and
gentle, the simple, but strong-minded a oble ideas
which the face of nature suggested to her father's fancy.
To him she would listen well pleased, though many a
creature of the great world might have scoffed at the
simplicity of the words he uttered. To him she would
tell all she herself felt; for never, from her childhood
upward, had her father checked the confidence of his
child, even by a laugh at her young ignorance.
Thus, when she came down in the morning to go out,
sne would pause for a moment at her father's door to

hear if he were stirring. If there were sounds within,
she would knock gently for admission; if there were
no sounds, she would pass on her way. This morning
her father was still sleeping when she came forth, for
he had passed a somewhat restless night, and she went
on alone with perhaps a more grave and thoughtful air
than usual. She lingered for some moments in the
flower-garden; and then, with a slow step, took her way
up the gravel-walk which led into one of the park paths,
running along through the woods which crowned the
bank above the stream.
The path she followed was like a varied but a pleas-
ant life, now emerging into full sunshine as it ap-
proached the edge of the bank, now dipping down into
cool and contemplative shadow as it wound in again
among the trees, now softly rising, now gently descend-
ing, but never so rapidly as to hurry the breath or to
hasten the footsteps. It was broad, too, and even; airy
and free. Along this, then, she wandered, casting off,
as she went, the slight degree of melancholy that at
first shaded her, and turning her mind to its usual sub-
jects of contemplation. She thus proceeded for more
than a mile, and had turned to go back again to the
house, when, as she approached a spot where another
path joined that which she was following, she suddenly
heard quick footsteps coming towards her. -
The mind has often, in such cases, rapid powers of
combination, seeming almost to reach intuition; and
though Alice Herbert had no apparent means of ascer-
taining who was the person that approached, yet she
instantly turned pale, and became, for a moment, a good
deal agitated. With woman's habitual mastery over
her own emotions, however, she recovered herself al-
most immediately, and was walking on as calmly as
before, when Lord Harold, as she had expected, joined
her in her walk. -
“Good-morning, Alice,” he said; “I have just seen
your father, and have come out to meet you.”
“Good-morning, Edward,” was her answer. “You
must have been early up to be over here so soon. But,
as my father has risen, let us go in to breakfast.”
“Nay, stay with me, a moment, Alice,” said the
young man; “it is but seldom that I have a few minutes
alone with you!”

Alice made no reply, but continued on her way to-
wards the house, with her eyes cast down and her
cheek a little pale. Lord Harold at length took her
hand and detained her gently, saying, “Nay, Alice, you
must stay; I have your father's permission for keeping
you a little longer; though I fear, Alice, from what I
see, that I shall keep you here in vain. Alice,” he add-
ed, after making an attempt to command his feelings,
“dear Alice, did you mark the few words I said to you
last night?”
Alice Herbert paused for a moment, and one might
have heard her heart beating, so greatly was she agi-
tated; but at length, evidently exerting a strong effort
of resolution, she looked up and replied, “I did mark
them, Edward, and they gave me very great pain, and I
have been grieved about them ever since.”
“Why, why?” demanded Lord Harold, eagerly;
“why should they give you pain, when it is in your own
power to render them, for me at least, the happiest
words that ever were spoken; and to give me an op-
portunity of devoting my whole life to make you happy
in return ?”
“It is not in my own power, Edward,” replied Alice,
firmly but gently, not attempting to withdraw the hand
that Lord Harold still held, but leaving it in his, cold,
tranquil, ungiven, though unresisting; “it is not in my
own power.”
“Then am I so very distasteful to you,” he exclaimed,
sorrowfully, “that no attention, no pains, no affection,
mo time can make you regard me with complaisance?”
Alice was pained. “Indeed, indeed, Edward, you do
me wrong,” she said. “You are not distasteful to me.
I do regard you with complaisance. You know that
your society is anything but disagreeable to me; but
yet I cannot love you as you ought to be loved, as
you have a right to be loved; nor can any attention,
nor any kindness which you could show me, nor any
time, make a difference in this respect. We have
known each other from our chilhood. You have shown
me every degree of kindness, every sort of attention
that any one can show. You have gained my esteem
and my regard; I have always felt towards you almost
as a sister; and perhaps that very feeling may have
prevented me from feeling more.”
“Nay, but, Alice, still he' me!” replied Lord Harold,

earnestly; “hear me, hear me patiently; for remember,
I am pleading for something more than life; for the
whole happiness of life ! You say you have regarded
me as a brother, that you esteem me, that you do not
dislike my society; were I to become your husband,
might not these feelings grow warmer, stronger?”
“They might or they might not,” answered Alice;
“but, Edward, I must not, I cannot, I will not put them
to the test. There is but one thing will ever induce me to
marry any man; loving him deeply, strongly, and en-
tirely; loving him with my whole heart.”
“And is there such a man?” demanded Lord Harold,
suddenly, and at the same time fixing his eyes keenly
upon her.
Alice lifted hers in return, full, but somewhat re-
proachfully to his countenance. ... “Edward,” she said,
“that is a question you have no right to put ! However,”
she added, after a moment's pause, “because we have
been companions from our childhood, because I do real-
ly esteem you, I will answer your question. There is
no one who has such a hold on me; and, till I meet
with such, I will never marry any one.”
“Then, then, dear Alice, there is yet hope !” he ex-
claimed. -
“You construe what I have said very wrongly,” she
replied. “Do not! oh! do not, Lord Harold, by taking
words of kindness for words of encougagement, force
me to speak that harshly which I would soften as much
as may be.”
“Nay, Alice,” answered Lord Harold, “your lesson
comes rather late to produce any benefit to me. I fear
that I may have mistaken, before now, words and acts
of mere kindness for words and acts of encouragement.
I have—I acknowledge it—I have entertained hopes; I
have thought that Alice sometimes smiled upon me.”
“Now, Edward, for the first time since I have known
ou,” replied Alice, “you are ungenerous, you are un-
ind. Brought up together from childhood, seeing each
other constantly, looking upon you almost as a brother,
esteeming, as I acknowledge I esteem you, I could but
act as I have acted. Has there been any change in my
eonduct towards you from what that conduct was five,
six, or seven years ago? Ought there to have been
any change in my conduct towards you till I knew that
there was a change in your feelings towards me? Would

you not have been the first to accuse me of caprice, of
unkindness, of forgetfulness of old regard and early
friendship ! Oh! Edward, why should anything thus
come to interrupt such friendship ! to bring a coldness
over such regard?”
“Pardon me, pardon me, Alice,” said Lord Harold;
“I was wrong to refer to my hopes; but I meant not
to say that you had willingly given them encourage-
ment; I meant rather to excuse myself for entertaining
them than to blame you. Blame you I did not, I could
not. All that you have done has been gentle and right.
Do not, then, Alice, do not let anything which has
passed to-day interrupt our friendship, or bring, as you
say, a coldness over your regard for me. Let me still
see you as heretofore; let me still be to you as a friend,
as a brother. There is no knowing what change may
take place in the human heart, what sudden accidents
may plant in it feelings which were not there before.
Some good chance may thus befriend me; some happy
circumstance may awaken new feelings in your heart.”
“I cannot suffer you to deceive yourself,” she said.
“Such will never be the case. It would be cruel of me,
it would be wrong both to myself and you, could I suf-
fer you to think I should change. Oh no! This can-
not have taken so strong a hold of you as not to be
governable by your reason. I shall ever esteem you,
Edward, I shall ever be your friend, but I can be nothing
more; and let me beseech you to use your powers of
mind, which are great, to overcome feelings which can
only make you unhappy, and grieve me to hear that
you entertain them.” -
She spoke in a manner, in a tone that left no hope;
but, though he had become deadly pale, he seemed now
to have made up his mind to his fate. “Fear not,
Alice,” he said, “fear not! Whatever I suffer you shall
hear no more of it. Love you, Alice, I shall ever, to
the last day of my life; but trouble you with that love
will I no more. There is only one thing I have to re-
quest; and that I do from no idle motive of selfish van-
ity, from no fear of being pointed at and pitied by our
friends as Alice Herbert's rejected lover, but from mo-
tives of some importance to all. Do not let it be known
that such words have passed between us as have been
spoken this day.”

“You cannot suppose me capable of speaking such
a thing at all,” cried Alice, both mortified and surprised.
“Oh no!” he said; “I mean to ask that it may re
main a secret even from my father.”
“With your own father,” said Alice, “you must, of
course, deal as you please; but with mine—”
“Yours knows my object in coming to-day already,”
interrupted Lord Harold, “and must, of course, know
the result. Mine has given his fullest consent, upon my
honour, to my seeking your hand. All I ask is that he
may not know I have sought it, and it has been refused.
Let me visit here as usual; let me—”
“I had heard,” said Alice, “that you were going up
to London. Why not do so at once?”
“I will,” he answered; “I will. But that will only
be for a few days; and, at my return, there must be no
difference, Alice. Promise me that; promise, if but for
the sake of early friendship, for the sake of childish
companionship.”
“Well,” she said, after a moment's pause, “well; but
there must be no mistaking, Edward.”
He looked pained. “Do not suppose, Alice,” he re-
plied, “that I have any ungenerous object. When I ask
this favour, I ask it for your sake as well as my own."
You must not ask me how or why, but trust me.”
“I will,” she said, “I will ! I have always found you
honourable and generous; but, indeed, let me say, with-
out thinking me unkind, that for your own sake, with
such feelings as you possess towards me, it were better
to be here as little as may be till you have conquered
them.”
“That will never be, Alice,” he answered; “that will
never be. It is enough that you shall never hear more
of them. But here comes Silly John, as people call
him,” he added, bitterly. “It is fit that a fool should
break off a conversation begun with such mad and silly
hope as mine! Let us go back to the manor, Alice;
we shall never get rid of him.”
The person who thus interrupted the painful inter-
view between Lord Harold and Alice Herbert was one
of a class now much more rarely seen than in those
times. There were, it is true, even then, hospitals and
asylums for the insane, but they were few; and Silly
John, as he was called, was not one of those whom the
men of that day would ever have dreamed of putting in

confinement. He was perfectly harmless, though often
very annoying; and the malady of the brain under which
he suffered was rather an aberration of intellect than
the complete loss of judgment. It went a g-eat deal
farther, indeed, than in the case of the half saved, in
that most beautiful of biographies, that quintessence of
rare learning and excellent thought, The Doctor. He
was decidedly insane upon many points; and upon all,
the intellect, if not weak, was wandering and unsettled.
His real name was John Graves: he had been usher in
a small school, and, consequently, was not without a
portion of learning, such as it was; but his great pas-
sion was for music and poetry: the one would call him
into a state of sad though tranquil silence; the very
name of the other would excite him to an alarming
pitch of loquacity. Withal, he was not without a cer-
tain degree of shrewdness in some matters; and, what
was still more singular and apparently anomalous, his
memory of events and dates was peculiarly strong, and
his adherence to truth invariable.
He now approached Alice and her companion with a
quick step, dressed in an old wide coat of philomot
colour, with a steeple-c “ned hat, which had seen
the wars of the great re... ...on, rusty and battered, but
still whole, and decorated with two cock's feathers
which he had torn himself from the tail of some luck-
less chanticleer. His gray worsted hose were darned
with many a colour; and in his lean but muscular hand
he carried a strong cudgel, which steadied his steps,
being slightly lame in the right leg. When he had come
within a few feet of the lady and her suiter, he stopped
directly in the path, so that they could not pass without
going among the trees; and, for a moment or two, looked
intently in both their faces, with his small gray eyes
peering into theirs, and his large head leaning consider-
ably to the side, so as to bring the heavy ashy features
quite out of the natural line.
“Well, John, what do you want?” demanded Alice
who had been familiar with the sight of the poor man
from her childhood. “Is there anything I can do for
you?” - -
“No, Mistress Alice; no, my pretty maid!” replied
the man. “Only take care of your sweet self, lady. I
came up to be at the conference; wherever there is a
conference, there am I; and I heard you and Harold

talking when I was on the other side of the bushes;
and now, lo! the conference seems over.”
“It is so for to-day, at least, John,” replied Lord
Harold; “so now let us pass, my good man.”
“Call me not good, Harold,” he replied.
“‘There yet was good but one
That trod this cold earth's breast,
And now to heaven he's gone
For our eternal rest.”
But you see I was right, Harold. They call me silly,
but I am not silly in matters of love. I told you how it
would be this morning as you crossed the bridge.”
“My good man, I heard you say something,” replied
the young nobleman, “but what I did not know.” -
“You should have listened, then,” replied the mad-
man. “Always listen when any one speaks to you!
Did you not learn that at school? Always listen, espe-
cially to the masters. Now, if you had listened, you
would have heard: I told you she would not have you.”
Lord Harold turned red, and Alice felt for him ; but
he replied, good-humouredly, as they walked on with
the madman following them, “I rather imagine, John,
you have been listening to some purpose.”
“No, I have not been listening, but I heard,” replied
the madman; “and two other pairs of ears did the
same.”
“Indeed!” exclaimed Lord Harold; “and who might
they be?”
“Oh, the fox and the dog!” replied Silly John, in a
rambling way. “The fox and the dog, to be sure. The
dog wanted to go away when you came, but the fox
would not let him, saying, that if they stirred they
would be heard and seen, and then folks would wonder
what they came there for so early of a morning; was
not that a cunning fox 1 But I could have told him what
they both came there for, if I had liked; but that would
never do.”
“And, pray, what was the dog's name?” demanded
Lord Harold, in a quiet tone, well knowing that an ap-
pearance of curiosity would often set their half-witted
companion rambling to different subjects from that
which had before engaged him.
“Oh, every dog has a name,” replied the madman;
“but they change their names as well as men and wo-

inen, Harold. Now this dog's name was once Lion, and
it is now Trusty, and to-morrow it may be Lord. I
have known dogs have twenty names in their lives
God help us! we are queer creatures ! and, talking of
dogs, I had a dog when I was second master at Upping-
ton school,” and so he rambled on.
There was now flo stopping him or recalling him to
the subject; and he followed Alice and Lord Harold,
keeping close to the side of the latter, and talking in
cessantly, but now so deeply engaged in the wild and
disordered stream of his own thoughts, that, taking no
farther notice of the conversation which the young no-
bleman renewed with his fair companion, and continued
with a low voice till they reached the house, he went …
on volubly, touching upon a thousand subjects, and dart-
ing after every collateral idea that was suggested by a
thance word spoken even by himself.

CHAPTER W.
THE day which we have begun in the last chapter
passed over without any other event of importance
Lord Harold left Alice at the door of the house, mounted
his horse, and departed. Alice communicated to her
father all that had taken place, and found him more
grieved than she had expected, but not at all surprised.
The angler was again seen fishing in the stream as the
first shadows of evening began to fall; but his efforts
were not so successful as before, and he retired early to
rest.
The following morning was again a bright one; too
bright, indeed, for his sport; and in the course of the
forenoon Langford made his appearance at the Manor
House, and paid a lengthened visit. At first he found
only Sir Walter Herbert at home; but the visiter seemed
to enjoy his conversation much, and the good old knight
suffered it to be sufficiently evident that the society of
his new acquaintance was anything but disagreeable to
him. In the course of half an hour, however, Alice
Herbert herself appeared; and not only did Langford's
eye light up with pleasure, but the conversation, which

had before been of somewhat a grave, if not of a sad
cast, instantly, as if by magic, became bright and spark-
ling, like the dark woods in the fairy tale, which, by a
stroke of the enchanter's wand, are changed to crystal
palaces and illuminated gardens. Alice, without know-
ing what had passed before, felt that her presence had
produced a change. She felt, too, that her society had
an influence upon Langford; that it called forth and
brought into activity the treasures and capabilities of
his mind; and, if truth must be spoken, it was not un-
pleasant to her to feel that such was the case.
We may go further still, and look a little deeper into
her heart. Her acquaintance with Langford, short as it
had been, had proved most disadvantageous to the hopes
and wishes of Lord Harold; but, in saying this, we
mean no more than we do say. She was not—hers
was not a nature to become in so short a time—in love
with Henry Langford; nor, indeed, so rapidly to become
in love with any one on the face of the earth. She was
capable of deep, and intense, and ardent feeling, and
the depths of her heart were full of warm affections.
But the waves of profound waters are not easily stirred
up by light winds; a ripple may curl the surface, but the
bosom of the deep is still. She was not in love with
Langford; but had she not known him, it is possible,
barely possible, that, though she would not have ac-
cepted Lord Harold at once, she might, as many a wo-
man does, have suffered him to pursue his suit till she
felt herself bound in honour to give him her hand, with-
out feeling any ardent attachment towards him even at
last, and trusting for happiness to esteem and regard.
Her acquaintance with Langford, however, had given
her feelings a more decided character; had taught her
that she could not marry any one whom she did not
absolutely love. It went no farther; but, as far as that,
the sort of surprise and pleasure which his conversa-
tion had given her certainly did go ; and now, on their
second meeting, there might be a kind of thrilling satis-
faction at her heart in finding that her society had an
influence over him; that his eye sparkled with irre-
pressible light; that his thoughts, and his manner, and
his feelings seemed to take a deeper tone as soon as
she appeared.
So went on the conversation for some time; but feel-
ing, while it proceeded, that though they might be talk-
<:

ing of indifferent subjects, they were thinking a good
deal of each other; and thus they established between
themselves all unwittingly a secret sympathy, which
but too often throws wide the doors of the heart, to let
in a strange guest who soon takes possession of the
lace.
p The course of the conversation speedily brought Sir
Walter to remark, “You must have visited many for-
eign countries, Captain Langford, and apparently not as
our young men usually do, in a hurried and rapid expe-
dition, to see without seeing, and to hear without un-
derstanding. I must confess it was the case with my-
self in my young days; but the habit of travel was not
then so much upon the nation as at present, and it was
something for a country gentleman to have been abroad
at all.”
“I have been very differently situated, Sir Walter,”
replied his guest; “though not born upon the Conti-
nent, being, thank God! an Englishman, yet the greater
part of my early life was spent in other lands. My
mother was not of this country, and she loved it not,
nor, indeed, had occasion to love it. We resided much
in France and much in Italy; some short time, too, was
passed in Spain; but those visits were in early years,
and I have since seen more of various countries while
serving with our troops under Turenne. I was very
young, indeed a mere boy, when the British forces in
which I served were recalled from the service of
France; but I was one of those who judged, perhaps
wrongly, that England had no right to leave her allies
in the midst of a severe war, and who therefore re-
mained with the French forces till the peace was con-
cluded. I have since served for many years in several
other countries; and I have always been of opinion,
that while there is no life which affords more opportu-
nity for idleness than a soldier's, if his natural disposi-
tion so lead him, there is no life-which gives so much
opportunity of improvement, if he be but inclined to
improve,”
Alice had listened eagerly and attentively, for Lang-
ford had come near a subject which had become of in-
terest to her—his own fate and history. Sir Walter
listened, too, with excited expectation; but their guest
turned the conversation immediately to other things,
and shortly after took his leave and left them.
WOL. I.–E

When he was gone Sir Walter himself could not re.
frain from saying, “That is certainly an extraordinary
oung man. Poor fellow ! I much fear, Alice that he
is one of those whom the faults of their parents--the
weakness of a mother, and the vices of a father—have
sent abroad upon the world without the legitimate ties
of kindred.”
“Oh! no, indeed, my dear father,” cried Alice, “I
cannot believe that. He would never speak so boldly
and so tenderly of his mother if there were any stain
upon her name. He has twice mentioned her, and each
time I have seen a glow of mingled love and pride come
up in his countenance.”
“Well, I trust it is so,” replied Sir Walter, “for other-
wise no situation can be more lamentable; with no
legitimate relations of his own, with no hope of uniting
himself to any upright and ancient house, for that bar
sinister must always be an insuperable objection to
every family of pure and honourable blood.”
Perhaps Alice might not see why it should be so; but
she knew her father's prejudices upon that point well,
and she dropped the subject.
In the mean while the person who had thus afforded
them matter for speculation returned to the inn, sat,
read and wrote for some time in his own chamber, and
then sauntered forth with a book in his hand, and his rod
and line left behind, in order to meditate more at leisure
by the side of the stream, wherein, during the whole of
the preceding evening, he had lost his time in unsuc-
cessful angling. He was not at all inclined to renew
his sport; and, if truth were to be spoken, he took his
book more to cover his meditations than to prompt
them.
Let us draw back the curtain, however, for a moment,
and look through the window in his breast, in order to
see what were the motives and causes which rendered
even that sport, which has been called “The comtem-
plative man's recreation,” too importunate an occupa-
tion for the body to suffer the agitated mind to deliber
ate with ease. We have seen what had been the ef-
fect of Alice Herbert's society upon him during the first
evening of their acquaintance: he could not but admire
her beauty, for it was not of that cold and abstracted
kind which may be seen and commented on by the
mind, without producing any other emotion. It was of


## p. 51 (#53) ##############################################

THE ROBBER. 5]
what we may call the most taking sort of beauty; it
was of that sort which goes at once to the heart, and
thence appeals to the mind, which cannot but admit its
excellence. But still, even had he fallen in love that
night, it might have been called love at first sight, and
yet have implied a very false position. During each
of the preceding years, he had spent nearly six weeks
in the small country town we have described; and, in
the neighbourhood of Alice Herbert, he had heard
from every lip but one account of her character. He
had spoken of her with many, and every one with
whom he spoke loved her.
He might, therefore, be well pleased to love her too
when he found that to virtue and excellence were
joined beauty, talents, and sweetness, such as he had
never beheld united before. ...We have seen, also, what
was the conclusion he had come to when he beheld her
in the society of Lord Harold; and we may add that he
was more mortified, disappointed, and angry with him-
self than he was at all inclined to admit. When, how-
ever, on the following day—placed in a situation from
which he could not retreat unperceived—he had been
an unintentional, and even an unwilling witness to a
part of her conversation with Lord Harold, and when
from that part he learned undeniably that she rejected
that young nobleman's suit, he felt grateful to her for
reconciling him with himself, and for removing so speed-
ily the mortification of the preceding evening. That
which had been at first but a mere spark upon Hope's
altar, and had dwindled away till it seemed extinct,
blazed up into a far brighter flame than before ; and in
their second interview he felt as if an explanation had
taken place between them, and that she had told him,
“I am to be won, if you can find the right way and use
sufficient diligence.”
But still there was much to be thought of, there was
much to be considered, there were peculiar points in
his own situation which rendered the chance of gaining
her father's consent to his suit almost desperate. He
felt, he knew, that if he lingered long near her, he
should love her with all the intensity of a strong and
energetic mind, of a generous and feeling heart; he
felt, too, from indications which he did not pause to ex-
amine, but which were sufficient for him, that there was
a chance of his winning her love in return. But, then.

if the giving his heart and the gaining hers was but to
produce misery to both, ought he, ought he to pause
for a moment ere he decided on flying for ever from a
scene of such temptation? But then came in again the
voice of hope, representing prospects the most improb-
able as the most likely, changing the relative bearings
of all the circumstances around him, and whisper-
ing that, even for the bare chance of winning such
happiness, he might well stake the tranquillity of his
whole life. Such were the thoughts that agitated him,
with many another on which it is needless here to touch.
Such was the theme for meditation on which he pored
while wandering on beside the stream.
The afternoon had gone by, and the brightness of the
day had become obscured, not only by the sinking of
the sun, but by some large heavy clouds which had
rolled up, and seemed to portend a thunder-storm. Lang-
ford had looked up twice to the sky, not with any pur
pose of returning home, for the rain he feared not; and,
in beholding the grand contention of the elements, he
had always felt an excitement and elevation from his
boyhood. There had always seemed to him something
in the bright light of the flame of heaven, and in the
roaring voice of the thunder, which raised high thoughts,
and incited to noble efforts and great and mighty aspi-
rations. He looked up twice, however, to mark the
progress of the clouds, as, writhing themselves into
strange shapes, they took possession of the sky, borne
by the breath of a quiet sultry wind, which seemed
scarcely powerful enough to move their heavy masses
through the atmosphere.
When he looked up a third time Langford's eye was
attracted to the opposite bank by the form of the half-
witted man, Silly John, making eager signs to him with-
out speaking, although, from the point at which he
stood upon this slope, Langford could have heard every
word with ease.
As soon as he saw that he had caught the angler's
eye, however, the half-witted man called to him vehe-
mently to come over, pointing with his stick towards a
path through the trees, and shouting, “You are wanted
there !”
Langford paused, doubting whether he should cross
or not; for, though the stream was shallow and the
trouble but little, still the man that called him was, as

he well knew, insane, and might be urged merely by
some idle fancy.
While he hesitated, however, the other ran down the
bank, exclaiming, when he had come close to the mar-
gin, “Quick, quick, Master Harry, or ill may happen to
her you love best!” -
Langford stayed not to ask himself who that was,
but crossed the stream in a moment, demanding, “What
do you mean, John what ill is likely to happen to—”
He was about to add the name of her who had so re
cently and busily occupied his thoughts; but, suddenly
remembering himself, he stopped short, and the half-
witted man burst into a laugh, exclaiming, “What! you :
wo'n't say it, Master Harry? Well, come along with
me quick; you will find I am right. I settled it all for
you long ago, when I was an usher at Uppington school:
and I said you should marry her, whether the old lord
liked it or not. But come on 1 come on quick | There
are two of the foxes down there waiting by the dingle
just beyond the park gates. You know what foxes are,
Master Harry? Well, you never thought to go fox-
hunting this evening; but I call them foxes because the
law won’t let me call them by any other name; and
she has gone down to the old goody Hardy, the blind
woman, and to talk with her. Then she will have to
read a chapter in the Bible, I warrant; so that she will
just come back about this time, and then she will meet
with the foxes; though, after all, they are waiting for
Master Nicholas, the collector's clerk, I dare say; but
they will never let her pass without inquiry.”
While he spoke these wild and rambling words, he
walked on rapidly, followed by Langford, who was now
seriously alarmed; for, although what his companion
poured forth was vague and incoherent, yet there were
indications in it of something being really wrong, and
of some danger menacing Alice Herbert. He remarked,
too, that the half-witted man, as he walked along, fre-
quently grasped the cudgel that he carried, and lifted it
up slightly, as if to strike; but it was in vain that Lang-
ford tried to gain any clearer notion of what was amiss,
for his questions met with no direct reply, his com-
panion answering them constantly by some vague and
irrelevant matter, and only hurrying his pace. Thus
they proceeded through the wood that topped the bank
over the stream, across 'part of the manor park to a

spot where a belt of planting flanked the enclosed
ground on the side farthest from the house and the vil-
lage. It was separated by a high paling from a lane
which ran along to some cottages at the foot of an up-
land common, and which lane itself was every here
and there broken by a little irregular green, ornamented
by high trees.
The ground around, indeed, seemed to have cut off
from the park, and probably had been so in former times.
There was a small gate opened from the park into
the lane at the distance of about a quarter of a mile
from the spot at which Langford and his companion
approached the paling, and at that hour of the evening
they could discern the gate, with the path leading up
to it; for, though the sun was just down, it was yet
clear twilight. Towards that gate Silly John rapidly
bent his steps; but they had not yet reached it when
Langford suddenly heard a scream proceeding from the
lane on his right hand, and apparently close to them.
The memory of the ear is perhaps stronger and keener
than that of the eye; and, though he had never heard
that voice in any other pitch than that of calm and
peaceful conversation, the distinctive tone was as dis-
cernible to the quick sense in the scream he now heard
as it would have been had Alice Herbert simply called
him by his name. He paused for no other indication;
in a moment he was through the belt of planting; and,
vaulting at a bound over the paling, he stood in one of
the little greens we have mentioned, an unexpected in-
truder upon a party engaged in no very legitimate oc-
cupation.
On the sandy path which marked the passage of the
lane across the green stood Alice Herbert, with a tall
powerful man grasping her tightly by the right shoulder,
and keeping the muzzle of a pistol to her temple, in
order, apparently, to prevent her from screaming, while
another was busily engaged in rifling her person of
anything valuable she bore about her. So prompt and
rapid had been the approach of Langford, that the two
gentlemen of the road were quite taken unawares; and
the one who held her was in the very act of vowing
that he would blow her brains out if she uttered a word,
when the muzzle of the pistol he held to her head was
suddenly knocked up in the air by a blow from the un-
expected intruder. The first impulse of the robber was


## p. 55 (#57) ##############################################

THE ROBBER. 55
to pull the trigger, and the pistol went off, carrying the
ball a foot or a foot and a half above the head of Alice
Herbert.
Instantly letting go his grasp of the terrified girl, the
man who had held her threw down the pistol and drew
his sword upon his assailant. But Langford’s blade
was already in his hand, and his skill in the use of his
weapon was remarkable; so that, in less than three
passes, which took place with the speed of lightning,
the robber's sword was wrenched from his grasp and
flying among the boughs of the trees, while he himself,
brought upon his knee, received a severe wound in his
neck as he fell. At that moment, however, another
terrified scream from the lips of Alice Herbert called
1.er defender's attention; and, turning eagerly towards
her, Langford at once perceived that it was for him,
not for herself, that she was now alarmed. The robber
whom he had seen engaged in rifling her of any little
trinkets she bare about her had instantly abandoned
that occupation on the sudden and unexpected attack
upon his comrade, and was now advancing towards
Langford, better prepared than the other had been, with
his drawn sword in one hand and a pistol in the other.
The moment which Langford had lost in turning to-
wards Alice had been sufficient to enable the man whom
he had disarmed to start upon his feet again, and to
run to the spot where his sword fell; and the angler
found that, in another instant, he should be opposed
single-handed, and with nothing but his sword, to two
strong and well-armed men. He did not easily, how-
ever, lose his presence of mind; and, seizing Alice
Herbert's arm with his left hand, he gently drew her
behind him, saying, “Crouch down low that you may
# be hurt when they fire. I will defend you with my
ife.”
Scarcely had he spoken, when the second ruffian de..
liberately presented the pistol at him, and fired. Lang-
ford felt that he was wounded in the left shoulder, and
the blow of the bullet made him stagger; but, in the
course of a soldier's life, he had been wounded before
more than once, and, as far as he could judge, he was
not now severely hurt.
His two assailants, however, were rushing fiercely
upon him, and the odds seemed strong against him; but
at that moment another arm, and a strong one, came in

aid of his own. His half-witted guide had by this time
scrambled over the paling as well as his lameness would
permit; and, with the cunning of madness, had crept
quickly behind the two plunderers. As soon as he was
within arm's length, which was but a moment after the
shot was fired that wounded Langford in the shoulder,
he waved his cudgel in the air, and struck the man who
had discharged the pistol a blow on the back of the
head, which laid him prostrate and stunned upon the
ground.
Langford's quick eye instantly perceived the advan-
tage, and he rushed forward, sword in hand, upon the
other man. Finding, however, that the day was against
them, the ruffian fled amain after making an ineffectual
effort to raise his companion; and, in a moment after,
the sound of a horse's feet, as it galloped rapidly away,
was heard in the road above.
“It is right that every man should have his nag,” said
the half-witted man, turning over the prostrate robber
with his foot; “but thou wilt ride no more, Simpleton!
I wonder if these clerks of St. Nicholas have lightened
the burden of Master Nicholas, the clerk,” he continued,
turning as if to speak to him whom he had guided
thither; but by this time Langford had returned to the
spot where Alice Herbert stood; and, holding both her
hands in his, was congratulating her upon her escape,
with all those feelings sparkling forth from his eyes
which might well arise from the situation in which he
was placed, combined with all the thoughts and fancies.
which had lately been busy at his heart.
Alice looked up in his face with an expression that
could not be mistaken. It was full of deep gratitude.
Perhaps there might be something more in it, too; and,
without listening much to vanity, he might have read
it, “I would rather be thus protected by you than by
any one I ever knew.”
There are times and circumstances which draw two
hearts together in a moment, which might otherwise
have been long in finding each other out; and such were
the times and circumstances in which they stood. She
was very pale, however; and Langford was somewhat
apprehensive, also, that the worthy personage who had
galloped off might return with more of his fraternity;
so that, after a few words of congratulation and assu-
rance to Alice, he called to his half-witted companion,


## p. 57 (#59) ##############################################

THE ROBBER. 57
* Dome, John, come.! Leave the scoundrel where he
is ; we have not time to make sure of him; and we had
better get into the park and towards the manor as fast
as possible.”
Thus saying, he drew Alice's arm within his own, and
led her on to the gate of the park, speaking eagerly to
her of all that had occurred. The madman followed
more slowly; but they had scarcely gone a hundred
yards within the paling when Langford perceived that
his fair companion was turning more and more pale
every moment. Her eyelids, too, drooped heavily, and
she said at length, in a low voice, “I am very faint.”
Scarcely had she spoken the words when he felt her be-
ginning to sink, and, placing her upon a bank beneatn
one of the old trees of the park, he bade their crazy
companion hasten as fast as possible to the house, and
bring up some of the servants to assist in carrying their
fair mistress home. .
The man seemed to comprehend at once, and set off
to obey; but Langford did not wait for the return of his
messenger ere he endeavoured to recall Alice to her-
self. From a little brook which ran down towards the
stream, he brought up some water in his hands, in order
to sprinkle her face there with; but, as he did so, some-
thing struck his eye which he had not perceived before,
and which made his heart sink with sensations that he
had never felt before, even in scenes of carnage and
horror such as man seldom beholds. The sleeve of
Alice Herbert's white dress on the right arm was drip-
# with blood, and Langford, in agony lest she should
ave sustained some injury, after casting the water in
her face, tore her sleeve open to seek for the wound.
No hurt was to be found, however; no blood was flow-
ing down that fair smooth skin; the stains were less in
the inside of her garment than on the out, and the blood
which he now saw trickling down his own arm—the
arm on which she had been leaning—so as to dabble the
back of his hand, showed him whence that had pro-
ceeded which had stained her dress.
The cool air, the recumbent position, and the water
he had thrown in her face, had by this time begun to
recall Alice to consciousness; and the joy of seeing
her recover, of finding that she was unhurt, and of hav-
ing successfully defended her, threw Henry Langford
off his guard, so far, at least, that he pressed a long kiss

58 THE ROBBER.
on the fair hand he held fondly in his own. Alice's lan-
guid eyes met his as he raised his head, but there was
a slight smile upon her lip, and he saw that he had not
Offended.
Her first faint words, as soon as she had sufficiently
recovered herself to speak, were, “You are hurt! Oh,
Captain Langford, I am sure you are very much hurt;
and my being weak enough to faint when I found the
blood trickling down my arm has delayed you but the
longer in getting assistance. For Heaven's sake leave
me here, and seek some one to attend to your wound
as soon as you can. I shall be quite safe here. I have
no fear now, but am only afraid that I cannot walk very
fast; and, indeed, you should not be without help any
longer.”
Langford assured her that his wound was a trifle,
that it was a mere nothing; that the blood he had lost
could do him no injury. But Alice would not be satis-
fied; and, finding that Langford would not go without
her, she insisted upon proceeding immediately. She
trembled very much, and could walk but slowly; but
she persevered in her determination, and had half crossed
the park when they were met by Sir Walter himself
and four or five of the servants. The feelings of the
father at that moment may be conceived, but cannot be
described: he threw his arms round his daughter, ex-
claiming, “My child, my dear child! But are you not
hurt, my Alice? Yes, yes, you are ! You are covered
with blood!” and his own cheek grew deadly pale.
“It is his, my father,” replied Alice, leaning upon Sir
Walter's bosom, and holding out her hand to Langford:
“I am quite unhurt, but he is wounded, and, I am afraid,
seriously. He gave me his arm to help me home, and
in a minute my whole sleeve was wet with blood. I
was foolish enough to faint when I saw it, and that has
made us longer; so pray let somebody look to his wound
mmediately.” -
All eyes were now turned upon Langford, and while
Sir Walter hurried him and his daughter on to the Man-
or House, he loaded her deliverer with both thanks and
inquiries. Langford assured him the wound that he had
received was a mere trifle; that the ball had lodged in
the flesh, and that he could move his arm nearly as well
as ever; and then, to change the subject, he recounted
to Sir Walter and Alice, as they went, how he had been

ed to the spot where he had found her by the unfortu-
nate half-witted man, John Graves.
“He shall wander about the world no more if I can
provide him with a home,” exclaimed Sir Walter, turn-
ing to look for the person of whom they spoke; but he
was no longer with the party, and they could hear his
voice in the woods at some distance, singing one of the
old melodies of those times.
When they reached that door of the Manor House
which opened into the park, Langford was about to take
his leave, and go on to the village to seek for a sur-
geon. Alice cast down her eyes as he proposed to do
so; but Sir Walter grasped him by the hand, and led
him gently in, saying, “In no house but mine, Captain
Langford ' Do you think, after having received such
an injury in defending my daughter, that we would trust
you to the tendance of an inn?”
Langford made but slight opposition. If there had
been hesitation in his mind and doubt at his heart when
he had gone forth that afternoon to wander by the side
of the stream, doubt and hesitation were by this time
over; and, after a few commonplaces about giving
trouble. He occepted Sir Walter's invitation, and became
*"a ren's e ví one house with Alice Herbert.
CHAPTER VI.
WE must now return for a short space of time to the
spot beneath the park wall where we left one of the as-
sailants of Alice Herbert, stunned by a blow from the
cudgel of John Graves. He lay there for some minutes :
perfectly motionless and perfectly alone. At length,
however, the sound of a horse's feet was heard canter-
ing lightly along the road, and a goodly gentleman,
dressed in a fair suit of black, and mounted on a dun
fat-backed mare, made his appearance in the lane, and
approached rapidly towards the spot where the discom-
fited wayfarer lay.
The good round face of the new-comer was turned
up towards the sky, calculating whether there was light
enough left to let him get to Uppington in safety, or

whether he had not better pause and sleep at the little
neighbouring town; and the first thing that called his
attention to the object in his path was his dun mare,
who had never before shied at anything on earth, re-
coiling from the body of the robber so violently as to
throw forward the good round stomach of the rider
upon her neck and shoulders with a sonorous ejacula-
tion of the breath.
“Ugh! Gad's my life! whom have we here !” ex-
claimed Master Nicholas, the clerk of the collector at
Uppington, whose saddlebags were, in truth, the tempt-
ing object which had brought forth the gentlemen of the
road, when they had been unseasonably diverted from
their purpose by the appearance of Alice Herbert:
“Gad's my life! whom have we here!” and, dismounting
from his mare with charitable intent, he bent down over
the stranger.
There were two or three particulars in the sight that
now presented itself which made the heart of the col-
lector's clerk beat rather more rapidly than was ordi-
nary. In the first place, the stranger had in his hand a
drawn sword; in the next place, a discharged pistol
might be seen lying within a foot of his nose; the sand
was stained with blood hard by, and in the countenance
of the prostrate man, the collector's clerk, who was a
great physiognomist, discovered at once all the lines
and features of a robber. The feelings of the good Sa-
maritan vanished from his bosom as soon as he had
made this discovery, and, stealthily creeping away as if
afraid of waking a sleeping lion, the gentleman in black
regained his mare's back, made her take a circuit round
the little green, and riding on as hard as he could to the
country town we have described in the commencement
of this book, sent out a posse of people to apprehend
the body of the stunned or defunct robber.
Before this detachment reached the spot, however,
the personage it sought was gone. Shortly after the
clerk had passed he had begun to recover, and speedily
regained his legs, looking about him with some degree
of wonder and amazement at the situation in which he
found himself. While busy in recalling all that had
passed, the sound of some one singing met his ear;
and, in another minute, the head and shoulders of John
Graves appeared above the park paling. The half-
witted man saw that the robber was upon his feet again;

and, without any hesitation, he proceeded to clamber
over the fence and approach his former antagonist.
“I have come to apprehend thee!” cried the mad-
man, laying his hand boldly upon the collar of the rob-
ber's vest. Strange to say, the freebooter not only suf-
fered him so to take hold of him, but very probably
might have even gone with him, like a lamb to the
slaughter-so much was he overpowered by surprise,
and so little did he imagine that such an act would be
performed without some power to support it—had not
two or three horsemen at that moment come galloping
down the lane as hard as they could ride. A single
glance showed the captive of John Graves that there
was an infinite accession of strength on his side. He
accordingly twisted himself out of his mad antagonist's
grasp in a moment, and prepared to lay violent hands
upon him in return.
Silly John, however, seemed by this time entirely to
have forgotten his purpose of arresting the robber; and
looking round him as the others came up, with an air
of wonder indeed, but not of alarm, he muttered, “More
foxes more foxes !” -
The worthies by whom he was surrounded in the
mean time held a sharp consultation, of which he
seemed to be the object; but, at length, one of them
exclaimed, “Come along, come along ! Bring him with
you, and do what you like with him afterward. If you
stay disputing here, you will have the whole country
upon you.”
After a moment's hesitation, the plan proposed was
adopted, and two of the robbers, seizing upon John
Graves, dragged him along between them at a much
quicker rate of progression than was at all agreeable to
him. After the first ten or twelve steps he resisted
strenuously, and showed a disposition to be vociferous,
which instantly produced the application of a pistol to
his head, with a threat of death if he did not keep si-
lence. He was quite sufficiently sane to fear the fate
that menaced him; and the sight of the pistol had an
immediate effect both upon his tongue and his feet, which
now moved rapidly onward. The paths pursued by his
captors were as tortuous as might well be, and the lane
which had been the scene of their exploits was left al-
most immediately. For nearly an hour they hastened on
as fast as they could drag the half-witted man along

but, at length, much to his relief, the whole party stopped
before a small lonely house on the edge of a wide com-
mon. There was a tall pole, with a garland at the top,
planted before the door; and a bush hung above the
lintel, giving notice to all whom it might concern that
entertainment for man, at least, was to be found with-
in. The sound of the strangers’ coming in a moment
drew out the landlord of the place, who seemed not at
all surprised to see the company which visited his house
at that late hour; and his own pale brown countenance
bore, in its hawklike features, an expression very har-
monious with the calling of his guests.
“Quick! take the horses up to the pits,” he said,
speaking to the boy of all work who appeared round
the corner; and shading the candle which he carried
in his hand from the wind, “Why, Master Hardie, whom
have you got there? By my life, it is Silly John
What, in the devil's name, did you bring him here for ?”
“Why, Master Guilford,” replied one of the men, but
not him to whom he spoke, “here Hardie and Wiley
have got themselves into a pretty mess. They would
go out against the captain's orders to try a bit of busi-
ness on a private account, and they have got more than
they bargained for, I take it. Here is Hardie with a cut
in his neck, which has made him bleed like an old sow
pig; and Wiley was left for dead by a blow of this same
fellow's cudgel whom we have got here. Hardie came
up for us two upon the downs, or else it is likely Wiley
would have been in the pepper-pot at Uppington by this
£ for we caught his horse half a mile up the green
ane.”
This conversation had taken place while the party
was alighting; but, no sooner was that operation con-
cluded, than the landlord pressed them to come in
quickly, and Silly John was hurried by them into a large
room behind, with a long deal table, and several settles
and benches for its sole furniture, if we except a pol-
ished sconce over the chimney, from which a single
candle shed its dim and flickering rays. Underneath
the light, with his two arms leaning on the table, and
his head resting again upon them, the curls of the fair
hair falling over the sleeves of his coat, and his face
hidden entirely, sat the boy Jocelyn, whom we have be-
fore mentioned; and the gang of plunderers had been
in the room several minutes before he was aware of

their presence, so sound was the slumber in which he
was buried.
“Hark ye, Master Doveton!” said the landlord, as
soon as the door was shut, and addressing the man who
had given him an account of his companions' adven-
ture; “hark ye ! I think it a very silly thing of you to
bring this fellow up here.”
“Why, we did not know what else to do with him,
Guilford,” answered the other. “Wiley wanted to
shoot him as soon as he heard that it was his cudgel
which had beaten about his head so foully.”
“You shall do no harm to him in my house, Master
Doveton,” replied the other; “the man is a poor inno-
cent whom I have known this many a year, and I won’t
have him hurt.”
“Thank you, Master Guilford, thank you!” exclaimed
the poor fellow, as he heard this interposition in his fa-
vour. “These foxes have almost twisted my thumbs
off. Do not let them hurt me, Master Guilford, and I'll
give you the crooked sixpence out of my tobacco-box.”
“You see, Guilford,” replied Doveton, while one or
two others crowded round to hear the consultation,
“the thing is, we risk this fellow betraying us. He has
seen all our faces, and could, I dare say, swear to us
anywhere.”
“What signifies his swearing !” demanded the land-
lord; “he is mad as a March hare; nobody will believes
his swearing.” -
“Ay, but he may give such information as will lead
them to ferret us out,” replied another of the gang:
“now we do not want to hurt the man, but he must be
got out of the way somehow.”
“He sha’n’t be got out of the way by foul means, how-
soever, Master Doveton,” replied the landlord, whose
new character of protector was pleasant to him. “Come,
nonsense! make him sit down and drink with you, and
he'll forget all about it. He'll sing you as good a song
as any man in the country; and if he promises not to
tell anything he has seen, you may be quite sure of
him.”
“Truth, truth! Master Guilford,” cried the object of
their discourse. “If my godfathers and godmothers at
my baptism had known what they were about, they
would have called me Truth. Why not Truth as well
as Ruth ! I had a sister they called Ruth, though she

never found out a Boaz, poor girl! but died without
being a widow ; how could she, when she was never
married ? If I had been married to Margaret Johnson
myself, I should not have gone mad, you know : but I
always tell truth. Did anybody ever hear me tell a lie
in my life?”
So he rambled on, while the friendly landlord busied
himself in setting out, hastily, the table in the midst for
the coming entertainment of his worthy guests; and,
at the same time, lent a sharp ear to the consultation
which they held together concerning the madman.
That consultation was not of a nature to satisfy him en-
tirely; for, though it seemed that the party were will-
ing to follow his counsel so far as keeping poor Silly
John to drink with them, a word or two was spoken of
its being easy to do what they liked with him when
# was drunk, which did not at all please Master Guil-
ord.
As he went round and round the table, however, set-
ting down a cup here and a platter there, he gave the
boy Jocelyn a sharp knock on the elbow, which roused
him from his sleep; and, the next time he passed, the
landlord whispered a word in his ear. The boy took
no particular notice at the moment, but rubbed his eyes,
yawned, spoke for a moment to Doveton and the rest,
and then disappeared from the room.
Large joints of roast meat soon graced the board,
and the hall assumed very much the appearance of the
palace of Ulysses in the days of the suiters; except
that, in all probability, it was a little more cleanly, and
that the beef was not killed at the end of the table.
Silly John was made to sit down between the two men,
Hardcastle and Wiley, who were certainly not his great-
est friends; but they nevertheless loaded his platter
with food, which he devoured with a wonderful appe-
tite, and filled his cup with ale from a tankard called a
black jack, which circulated freely till supper was over.
The gentlemen into whose society he was thrown,
however, were not of a class to rest satisfied with even
the best old humming ale; and, while one body of them
demanded the implements and materials for making
punch, another called for a pitcher of Burgundy, which,
notwithstanding the size, character, and appearance of
the house, was produced as a matter of course. John
Graves had his ladleful from the bowl and his glassful

from the pitcher; and Doveton, who was beginning to
get merry, and eke good-humoured in his cups, insisted
upon having one of the songs the landlord had so much
vaunted. The madman required no pressing; the ver
name of music was enough for him; and with a full
sonorous voice, and memory which failed not in the
slightest particular, he began an old song, one of the
many in praise of punch.
“Now I will sing you a song in return, Master John,”
cried the rough-featured fellow called Hardcastle, who
had been one of the assailants of Alice Herbert.
“Why, Hardie, thou canst never sing to-night,” re-
plied Doveton. “Thou canst never sing to-night, with
the slit in the weasand thou hast got down there. It
will let all the wind out, and thy song will be like the
song of a broken bellows or bursten bagpipe.”
“Never you mind that, Doveton,” replied the other;
“my song shall be sung if the devil and you stand at the
door together; a pretty pair of you!” and he accord-
ingly proceeded to pour forth, in a voice of goodly pow-
er, but very inferior in melody to that of the madman.
a song well suited to the taste of his auditors:--
THE WATERY MOON.
The £ moon is in the sky,
Looking all dim and pale on high;
And the traveller gazes with anxious eye,
And thinks it will raise full soon :
And he draws his cloak around him tight,
But if I be not mistaken quite, *
He will open that cloak again to-night
Beneath the wat'ry moon.
The wat'ry moon is sinking low,
The traveller's beast is dull and slow,
And neither word, nor spur, nor blow
Will bring him sooner boon.
But the saddlebags are heavy and full,
And all too much for a beast so dull,
Up this steep shady hill to pull,
Beneath the wat'ry moon.
The wat'ry moon is gone to bed;
The traveller on his way has sped;
The horse seems lighter the road to tread,
And he'll be home very soon : -
But with a young man he met on the hill,
Who lighten’d his load with right good-will,
Hoping often to show the same kindness still,
Beneath the w"g mOOn,

Scarcely had Hardcastle done his song, amid great
applause on the part of his companions, when a step
was heard in the neighbouring passage which made the
whole party start and look in each other's faces. The
next moment, however, the door was opened, and the
personage of whom we have already spoken more than
once, under the title of Franklin Gray, stood among
them. It was very clear that he was an unexpected,
and not a very welcome guest at that moment; but, at
the same time, the whole of the fraternity who occu-
pied the hall immediately put on the most agreeable
look in the world, and strove to appear delighted with
his coming. His brow was somewhat cloudy, indeed,
but his bearing was frank and straightforward; and sit-
ting down in a chair which had been placed for him with
busy haste by the others, he fixed his eyes sternly upon
the man who had suffered from the cudgel of Silly
John, demanding, “What is all this I hear, Wiley !”
The personage he spoke to hesitated to reply, bit his
lip, tried to frown and to toss his head; and, before he
had made up his mind what to say upon the occasion,
the one who had been called Doveton answered for
him.
“I believe, captain,” he said, “the best way when
one has been in the wrong is to own it, and to tell the
truth. Now we have all, more or less, been wrong, I
believe. Wiley, there, heard that Master Nicholas, the
clerk of the collector at Uppington, was coming along
the green lane this evening with all the receipts; and he
thought it would be a good sweep for us all if we could
get the bags. He asked us all to go, but only Hard-
castle would have a hand in it, though the rest of us
promised to exercise our horses upon the hill above,
and come down if they were likely to be caught. Well,
they fell in with a young lady first, and they thought
they might as well have her purse too—”
Franklin Gray set his teeth hard, but said nothing;
and Doveton, who saw the expression on the other's
face, went on. “It was very wrong, I know, Captain
Gray; quite contrary to your orders to do anything of
the kind; and more especially to attack a woman,
which you spoke of the other day. But, however,
temptation, you know, captain; temptation will get the
better of us all at times. As I was saying, however,
some one came to help the lady with this poor silly fel.

low ; and Hardcastle got a cut in his neck that won’t be
well this ten days, and Wiley a broken head, which, I
hope, will teach him better manners for the rest of his
life.”
The brow of Franklin Gray never relaxed its heavy
frown except at the moment when Doveton announced
the corporeal evils which had befallen the two adven-
turers as a reward for their disobedience; and then a
grim smile for a moment curled his lip. It passed
away, however, instantly, and he demanded, looking at
Wiley, “Do you know who it was that came to the
lady's help?”
“Oh! I marked him well enough,” replied Wiley.
“I shall not forget him; and, if ever the time comes—”
The rest of the sentence was lost between his teeth;
but he went on in a louder tone immediately after, ad-
ding, “He is one of your good friends, Captain Gray.
I have seen you walking with him twice; and I think
he might have known better than interrupt a gentleman
in his occupations. We should not have hurt the young
woman | What business was it of his 1”
“The only pity is,” said Franklin Gray, coolly, “that
he did not send a bullet through your head.”
“He has got one in his own shoulder,” said Wiley.
doggedly; “for I saw the ball strike, and I hope it may
do for him.”
“If he chance to die of it,” said Gray, in the same
calm, stern tone, “I will blow your brains out! Re-
member what I say, Master Wiley: you know me !
Nay, a word more. When we joined together and came
down here, it was for a particular purpose, and you all
swore an oath to obey my directions, and submit to my
laws for the next three months. You and Hardcastle
have scarcely been a fortnight with me, but you break
our oath; and when I especially told you not to enter
into any petty enterprise, because we had a greater in
hand which you would ruin if you did, you go and dis-
grace yourself by attacking a girl. Now it seems that
you have received some punishment in the very act,
and, therefore, I shall inflict no other; but be warned,
both of you! I am not a man to be trifled with ; and if
once more either of you disobey, be sure that I will
then be as severe as I am now lenient. Can any one
tell,” he continued, “who the lady was that was attacked

by them 1 I can only suppose that it was old Sir Wal-
ter's daughter.”
“Just so I just so !” cried Silly John Graves from the
other end of the table; “it was pretty Mistress Alice
Herbert, and good Mrs. Alice Herbert too, which is bet-
ter than pretty: and you, too, seem to be good, which
is better than brave; very good, indeed, for a fox and a
leader of foxes. I vow and protest you have read them
a homily as fair as any in the book; and now, pray let
me go, for I have sung them a song such as they won't
hear again in a hurry.”
“Why have you brought him hither!” continued
Franklin Gray, in a sharp tone, without making any re-
ply to John Graves's observation. “Was it to end folly
by madness, and conclude your own disobedience by
ensuring its own punishment?”
It took some time to explain to the leader of the
band the motives which had induced them to bring the
half-witted fellow up thither, and how he had been found
busy in the laudable occupation of arresting Wiley
when the rest of the party came to the rescue.
“And therefore,” exclaimed Gray, interrupting the
speaker" because he was likely to recognise Wiley,
and bring him to the gallows, Master Wiley persuaded
you to drag him up here, that he may recognise us all,
and bring us to Tyburn along with him. It was worthy
of you, Master Wiley.”
“You are wrong for once, captain,” said Wiley; “if
I had had any of my wits, I would have taken care that
he should recognise no one. Dead men tell no tales, I
said then, and I say so still.”
“They tell tales that are heard long years after!” re-
plied Franklin Gray, with melancholy sternness. “Ay!
and often, when time has flown, and the hot blood has
become cool, and the black hair gray, and the strong
limbs feeble, and easy competence has soothed regret,
and either penitence or pleasure has stilled remorse; I
tell ye, my masters, that often then, in the hour of se-
curity, and tranquillity, and luxury, the avenger of blood
needlessly spilled—the avenger, who has slept so long—
will awaken, and the merest accident bring forth proof
fit to lead us to shame, and condemnation, and death.
No, no! I will deal with this man; but I must first go
forth and ascertain what are likely to be the conse-
quences of this act of folly. In the mean time, Harvev

1 leave him under your charge ' See that no evil befall
him, and keep as quiet as may be. No roaring, no
singing, mark me! and, if possible, abstain from drink.”
Thus saying, he left them, but returned much sooner
than they had expected; and, when he appeared, was
evidently much moved. His dark brow was gathered
into angry frowns, and his bright eye flashed in a man-
ner which made those who knew him best augur some
sudden violence. He sat down at the table, however,
and remained for a moment in silence, with his brow
leaning upon his hand.
“I am foolish enough,” he said, at length, “to follow
the weak custom of the world, and be more angry at
the bad consequences of an evil act than I was at the
act itself: but I will not yield to such folly. What
think ye, sirs? I find that the whole county is already
in a stir against us on this bad business. There have
been large parties of men from Uppington scouring the
lanes in every direction. Messengers have been sent
out from the manor to call a general meeting of the
magistrates for to-morrow. There is foolish Thomas
Waller, and silly Matthew Scrope, and all the men who
are likely to be most active and violent against us, called
to consult at the Talbot; and nothing is to be done but
for each one of us to take his own way out of the county
till the storm has blown over. Let us all meet this day
week at Ashby. That is seventy miles off; and we
can there see how to pass the time till we can return
here, and pursue our great enterprise in safety. But
one word more. We are all men of honour; and, if
any of us should chance to fall into the hands of the
enemy, we can die in silence: that is enough.”
“But what is to be done with him 1" demanded one
or two of the fraternity, pointing to the unhappy luna-
tic; while, at the same time, same of the others came
forward and whispered to their captain, apparently on
the same subject, with somewhat sinister looks. But
Gray replied, sternly, “No ! I say no! Leave him to
me: I know him well, and he may be trusted. I shall
remain a day, or perhaps two, behind you. Now to
horse and depart, but one by one.”
The tone in which he spoke courted no reply; and
the band left the room, every man according to his own
peculiar manner of doing such things: for there is as
much art in leaving a room as in entering one, though

the first is much more important as an evolution. How
ever, one walked straight out, without saying a word
to anybody; one spoke for a few minutes with a com-
panion, and then, suddenly turning, passed through the
door, one entered into a conspiracy with another, to
go out conversing with each other; one stayed a mo-
ment to empty the remains of the tankard into a large
cup, and drink it off at a draught; and another (Dove-
ton) went up to Gray, shook him by the hand, wished
him well, and told him he was very sorry that he had
even connived at Wiley's scheme. The last was the
only one who, in fact, suffered to appear the feelings
which affected all the others, and embarrassed them in
their exits. They all felt they had been wrong, with the
exception of him who emptied the tankard; they all felt
that Gray had just cause to be angry and indignant; but
one feeling or another-pride, vanity, shyness, and
many others—keep nine hundred and ninety-nine men
out of a thousand from opening their lips under such
circumstances. It is only the thousandth who candidly
and straightforwardly walks up to the truth, and says,
“I am sorry I have done wrong.”
At length the room was left untenanted by any but
Franklin Gray and his half-witted companion, who sat
twirling his thumbs at the table, apparently lost to the
recollection of what was passing around him. He was
roused, however, by the voice of Gray pronouncing his
name, and found the keen dark eye of the robber fixed
intently upon him.
“John Graves,” said Gray, “do you know what those
men pray me to do with you? They say that, if I let
you go, you will betray what you have seen this night,
lead people to the places where we meet, or give evidence
against us if ever we are in trouble; and they say that
the only way is to silence your tongue for ever.”
“No, no, no!” cried the poor man, fully awakened
to his situation by such words; “pray don't! pray don’t
I will never tell anything about it, as I hope for God's
mercy, and that he will restore my wits in another world.
Wits? I have not got wits enough to tell anything:
besides, I won’t, indeed I won't.” -
“If you will swear,” said Gray, “by all you hold dear,
never to tell any one what you have seen to-night; nev-
er to point any one of us out, by word, or look, or ges-

ture, as men you have seen do this or that; never to
lead any one to this place as our place of meeting-”
“I will! I do !” cried the madman, solemnly; “I will
betray you in no respect.”
“So far, so good,” answered Gray; “but that is not
all I give you your life when every voice among us
but my own was for taking it; and with it you must
promise, if ever I call upon you, to do me a piece of
Service.”
The other gazed earnestly in his face; seeming, by a
painful effort, to gather together all his remaining frag-
ments of mind, to cope with one who, he feared, was
trying to lead him astray by the bribe of life. “What
is it,” he demanded, “what is it I am to do? I will
break none of the commandments. I will neither rob
nor murder, nor help to rob or murder. Ah, man! re-
member, though perhaps I am crazy, as people say, I
have a soul to be saved as well as others. If it must
be, I will die sooner than do these things.”
“I require no such things at your hands,” replied
Gray, moved a good deal by his companion’s earnest-
ness. “I may only require you to guide me on my
way in a moment of difficulty; to lead me by the paths
which, I am told, no one knows so well as you do; and,
perhaps, to guide me into a house—”
“Not to take other men's goods !” cried Graves.
“No, never! Guide you I will in moments of diffi-
culty; lead you I will when you want it; but not to
commit a crime, for then I am a sharer.”
“What I shall ask you,” said Gray, solemnly, “is to
commit no crime. My purpose shall be to take no man's
goods from him, but rather to restore to him who is de.
prived of it that which is his own.”
“Swear to me that !” exclaimed the other, “ and 1
will lead you anywhere.”
“I swear it now !” answered Gray; “and remember
that, having sworn it, I shall never ask you to do any-
thing but that which you now agree to do, and in con-
sideration of which I give you your life. No questions,
therefore, hereafter, even were I to ask you to lead me
into the heart of Danemore Castle.”
The madman laughed loud. “There should be none."
he answered, “for I know why you go.”
“Indeed!” said Gray, with a smile: “but it is enough
that you are willing. I trust to your word in every.

thing, and doubt not that you will keep it to the letter
Hast thou any money, poor fellow?”
“Nothing but my crooked sixpence in my tobacco
box,” replied the man, looking ruefully in his interroga
tor's face. “Pray, do not take that from me: it and .
are old friends.”
“I would rather give than take from thee,” replied
his companion. “There is a guinea to keep thee
warm; and now thou art at liberty to go: so fare thee
Well.”
As he said this he turned away and left the room;
and poor Silly John continued gazing upon the gold
piece in his palm with evident delight, though he held
some curious consultations with himself regarding the
lawfulness of taking money from such hands as those
which had bestowed it. In those consultations much
shrewd casuistry was mingled with much simple folly.
but, in the end, the counsel for the defence, as usual,
got the better, and he slipped the gold piece into his
pouch, chuckling. He then crept quietly out of the
inn; and, although it may seem strange to attach our-
selves so particularly to a personage of the class and-
character of Silly John, yet must we, nevertheless, fol-
low him a little farther in his wanderings.
By the time that all this had passed, it was near mid
night; and, instead of taking his way back to the little
town of Moorhurst, the half-witted man walked on,
with his peculiar halting gait, towards the high dim
moors that might be seen rising dark and wild against
the moonlight sky, like the gloomy track of difficulties
and dangers which we too often find in life lying be-
tween us and the brighter region, lighted up by hope,
beyond. On the edge of the moor was a low shed and
a stack of fern, which the poor fellow must have re-
marked in some of his previous peregrinations; for to-
wards these he directed his steps at once, pulled down
a large quantity of the dry leaves, dragged them into
the shed, and, having piled them up in a corner, nestled
down therein, though not without having addressed a
prayer and a thanksgiving towards the God whom, in
all his madness, he never forgot. We will not inquire
whether the act of adoration was couched in wild and
wandering terms; whether it was connected or broken,
reasonable or distracted: it was from the heart, and we
are sure it was accepted.

By daylight he was upon his way, and an hour's walk
brought him into the deep woods that backed the splendid
dwelling of Lord Harold and his father, which was
known in the country by the name of The Castle, for
very few of the good folks round had ever seen any
other building of the kind, and it was therefore their
castle par excellence. It was by the back way that
Silly John now approached the mansion, seeming quite
familiar with all the roads and paths about the place;
but, before he reached the spot where the wood, cut
away, afforded an open space, in which were erected
the principal offices, he was met by a person, at the
sight of whom he bent down his head, and glanced fur-
tively up with his eye, like a dog who does not very
well know whether it will be kicked or caressed.
The figure that approached him in the long dim walk
was that of a tall thin woman, of perhaps fifty years of
age, dressed in dark-coloured garments, exceedingly
full and ample, with a sort of shawl of fine white lace
pinned across her shoulders; while over a broad white
coif, which she wore upon her head, was a black veil
drawn close, and crossing under the chin. Her features
were high and sharp; her eyes fine, and fringed with
long black eyelashes; her lips thin anid pale; her teeth
very white; and her complexion, which must have
been originally dark and troubled, now sallow, without
the slightest trace of red in any part of the cheek.
She did not frown; but there was a cold calmness about
her compressed lips and tight-set teeth, and a piercing
sharpness about her clear black eye, which rendered the
whole expression harsh and forbidding. Although past
the usual period of grace, yet she walked gracefully and
with dignity, and bore every trace of having been a
very handsome woman, though it was impossible to
conceive that she had ever been a very pleasing one.
From the moment she saw him, her eye remained
fixed upon Silly John steadfastly, but not sternly; and
he advanced towards her crouching, as we have said,
and sidling with a degree of awe which he would not
have shown to the highest monarch on the earth from
any reverence for mere external rank. But the sharp
and seemingly cold decision of her character was ex- ". .
actly that which most strongly affects people in his sit-
uation; and “Mistress Bertha, the housekeeper of Danek:
more Castle,” the servants used to declare, “could

always make silly John Graves in his senses when she
pleased.” Although no smile curled her lip, and her
countenance underwent no change, the tone of her voice,
while she spoke the first few words to him, at once
showed the half-witted man that he was not out of
favour.
“Why, how is it, John,” she asked, speaking with a
very slight foreign accent; “how is it it you have
not been up at the castle for these six weeks?”
“Because I got my fill at the town and the manor
Mistress Bertha,” replied the other.
“Ay, that is it!” she exclaimed; “that is it. If every
one would but say it. Men go for what they can get;
and when they can get their fill at one place, they seek
not another. The only difference b 1 madmen
and the world is, that madmen tell “lie .....h and the
world conceals it.”

caught by the sound of a word connected with one of
his rooted ideas; “I always tell the truth; do not I,
Mistress Bertha 7"
“Yes; but you are only half mad,” answered the
housekeeper; “for you can sometimes conceal it too.
But go in, John; go into the castle; and, if you go along
the long back corridor below, you will find my little
maid in the room at the end. Bid her give you the cold
meat that Lord Harold left after his breakfast.”
“After his breakfast !” cried the half-witted man.
“He has breakfasted mighty early 1. But now—oh, I
guess it; he has gone to London. I heard her tell him
to go.”
“Heard who tell him ?” demanded Mistress Bertha,
with an air of some surprise.
“Why, pretty Mistress Alice Herbert, to be sure,”
replied the other. “Did not I hear all they said as they
came down the walk and through the woods?”
“Nay, then,” said the houskeeper, smiling, as far as
she was ever known to smile, “I suppose he is gone to
buy the wedding ring, and have the marriage settlements
drawn up. Methinks he might have told me too.”
“Nay, Mistress Bertha,” replied the other, “no wed-
ding rings! no marriage settlements! Mistress Alice is
not for him ''”
A slight flush came over the pale cheek of her to

whom he spoke. “Not for him 1" she exclaimed; “not
for him : Does she refuse him, then 1’’
“Yes, to be sure,” replied John Graves; “every man
is refused once in his life. I was refused myself, for
that matter; but I was wise, and resolved that I would
never be refused again.”
“Art thou lying or art thou speaking truth?” demand-
ed Mistress Bertha, fixing her eyes sternly upon him.
“Did she refuse him ''”
“Truth!” replied the man: “I always speak truth!
She refused him as sure as I am alive: nothing he
could say would move her. I knew it very well, and I
told him so before; but he would not believe me.”
Bertha stood and gazed upon the ground for several
minutes. “I do believe,” she said, speaking to herself,
“I do believe that things possessed without right have a
doom upon them, which prevents them from bringing
happiness even to those who hold them, unconscious
of holding them wrongly. Now is this poor boy, not-
withstanding all his great wealth and high expectations,
destined to be crossed in this long-cherished love, which
was to make both himself and his father so happy!
Poor youth ! how long and deeply he has loved her !
How his heart must have ached when I talked about
her this morning ! and shall I help to take from him any-
thing he possesses?”
‘We ought always to do what is right, Mistress Ber-
tha,” exclaimed the half-witted man, whose presence
she had totally forgotten. “And both you and I know
that right has not always been done.”
“Out upon the fool!” exclaimed the housekeeper.
“Hold thy mad tongue!. How darest thou to prate of
right and wrong, not having wit to keep thee from run-
ning thy head against a post! Get thee in before me !
Thou shalt give the earl an account of this refusal !”
John Graves slunk away before her flashing eye and
angry words like a cowed dog, looking ever and anon
to the right and left as if for some means to escape,
but she kept him in view, following close upon his steps
till they both entered the large mansion before them.

CHAPTER VII.
The injury which Henry Langford had received was
more severe than he had at first imagined. The ex-
traction of the ball was very painful, and so much inflam-
mation succeeded that he was confined to his room for
several days. The delay and restraint in truth annoyed
him as much as the pain and restlessness which he suf-
fered, for at that time there were various important ob-
jects before him which he was prevented from pursu-
ing with the calm but rapid energy of his character.
He had one great consolation, however, that the in-
jury he had sustained was received in defence of Alice
Herbert; he had one great pleasure in the midst of his
sufferings, to feel sure that she was thinking of him,
and thinking of him with interest. Alice Herbert did
not attend him as a lady of romance; she did not dress
his wounds or sing to lull him to repose. She did not
even show him that care and attention, visiting his sick
chamber often in the day, making cooling drinks with
her own hand, and pressing him to take care of himself,
and to follow exactly the surgeon's directions, which
many a lady of that very age would have done. Nay,
more, strange as it may seem, she did not display half
so much interest towards him as she might have done
towards any person in whom she was not so deeply in-
terested. She took care, indeed, that everything should
be done for his comfort and convenience; but she did
so seeming to do it as little as possible. She did give
up every thought to him, and to how he might be best
brought back to health, especially during the first three
days, while the surgeon shook his grave and not very
Sapient head, and declared that the result was doubtful;
but she took great care that nobody should know that
her thoughts were so employed.
When at length he was permitted to leave his room,
she received him with a degree of timidity that was
not without its share of tenderness. It seemed as if
she felt that towards him she was placed in a different .
relationship from that in which she stood towards any
other human being, and the feeling was strange and

new to her, but it was not without its pleasure. Lang-
ford's manner, too, soon dispelled everything that was
in the least embarrassing in such feelings, and left them .
all their delight.
With fever and loss of blood he had been greatly
weakened, and there was a degree of languor in his
conversation during the first two or three days which
rendered it to Alice Herbert perhaps more interesting
even than it had been before. It was still bright and
sparkling; it was still rich and deep; but there was a
softness, a gentleness in it, which was the more win-
ning from the contrast between the power of the thought
and the mildness of the manner. The mind of Alice,
too, had undergone some change, from what reason she
scarcely knew. She was becoming fonder of grave
thoughts; she was more pensive; and once or twice,
even when she was alone, she blushed deeply at find-
ing herself guilty of some little act of absence of mind,
a thing she never had accused herself of before. She
blushed because she was conscious that on these occa-
sions she was thinking of Henry Langford; her medi-
tations, indeed, were such as she needed not to have
blushed for; they were all pure, and upright, and good;
but it was for their intensity that she blushed, not for
the matter of them.
There was in Langford’s manner towards her, how-
ever, a tenderness, a gentleness, an appealingness, if we
may use the term, which, without words, very soon
told her, that if she thought deeply of him, he thought
no less deeply of her. Her father was about this time
a good deal absent from home; for the attack upon his
daughter, at the very gates of his own park, had raised
his indignation to a high pitch; and he declared that he
would not rest, night or day, till he had rooted out of the
country the band of villains who deprived it of its an-
cient peace and security. Meetings of the justices in
the neighbourhood were accordingly held for the pur-
pose of causing the apprehension of the offenders; and
at all these Sir Walter, who was himself an active
though kindly magistrate, was present, taking a promi-
nent part; so that, as we have said, he was much ab-
sent from home, and Alice Herbert was left not alone,
but in company with Henry Langford.

long before reached by the heart of each. Langford,
however, was extremely careful: he could not, indeed,
so far govern his manner as to prevent it from betray-
ing the growing tenderness, the daily increasing love
that he felt towards Alice Herbert; but not a word
ever escaped his lips to confirm what his manner told
unwittingly. They spoke of all the various matters,
on all the multitude of themes which are to be found
In the treasury of rich and well-cultivated minds; there
was not one fine subject in all the mighty universe,
there was not an object in all the tide of bright and
beautiful things, which the God of Nature has poured
through every channel of the immense creation, that
might not become for them a topic of discourse, for in
all they could find sources for enjoyment and admira-
tion.
And thus they went on conversing upon indifferent
things, deriving amusement and instruction, and em-
ployment for imagination from all. Yes! conversing
of indifferent things, but conversing as people who were
not indifferent to each other; speaking of matters which
had no £, themselves, yet each learning as
they spoke but the more to admire, to esteem, to love
the other. -
There were looks, too-unintentional looks—that
betrayed the secrèts of the heart more than words.
When Alice Herbert's eyes were turned away, Lang-
"ford would gaze at her with long and tender earnest-
ness till she turned towards him, and then would imme-
diately withdraw his eyes. But still, more '' once,
she caught those eyes fixed upon her, and felt’sure that
they had been so gazing long. She, too, while work-
ing or drawing, and conversing at the same time on any
passing subject that was before them, would occasion-
ally, when his rich eloquence poured forth in a current
of more than ordinary brightness, raise her eyes to his
face with a look of deep eagerness which made his
very heart thrill.
Thus it went on, as might be naturally expected, and,
before three weeks were over, Alice Herbert found that
there was but one happiness for her on earth; and
Henry Langford knew that his fate was decided, as far
as intense, and true, and ardent love decides, for weal or
wo, the fate of every man capable of feeling it.
F%the last two or three days, however, Alice had

* remarked that he was more thoughtful, perhaps more
grave than usual. The magisterial labours of her father
were now nearly at an end. Though none of the of.
fenders had been taken, he had satisfied himself that
their bad neighbours had been driven from the vicinity;
and two or three daring robberies, which were com-
mitted about this time in the next county but one, con-
firmed him in the belief. He was, therefore, much more
at home with Alice and with him whom we may now
call her lover, and the delight which he took in Lang-
ford's society was every day more and more apparent, .
and every day more sweet and reassuring to his daugh-
ter's heart. The regard of the old man and the young
man was evidently reciprocal, for Langford was one of
those who could feel and estimate to the full the beautiful
and natural simplicity, the straightforward single-mind-
edness of the old knight of Moorhurst.
However, during the two or three days which we
have just mentioned as having displayed an unusual de-
gree of gravity in Langford's manner, his eyes would
often rest with a sort of doubtful and inquiring look
upon the face of Sir Walter; and Alice also fancied
that her father was pale, thoughtful, and uneasy. Lang-
ford, too, though scarcely fully recovered, had been out
several times alone, pleading urgent business; and, in
short, it was clear, that in the bosoms of many of the
party tenanting the Manor House there were busy
thoughts, which for some reason they concealed from
each other. -
Such was the state of things just three weeks after
the affray with the robbers; when one evening Alice
had walked out alone, in order to think over all that she
felt and all that she had remarked, without having her
thoughts interrupted even by the conversation of those
who were the objects of her meditation. She had now
learned not to go very far from the house when alone,
and she sat down for a moment in a seat at the end of
the bowling-green, which was a small oblong piece of
ground, hollowed out between high banks on every side,
which banks, like the flat little lawn that they surround.
ed, were covered with smooth green turf, and were sur-
mounted on three sides by a range of fine yew-trees,
cut with exact precision into the form of a high wall.
Her father, before she left the house, had seated him-
self in his armchair in the library to take the a"go"

nap in which he sometimes indulged; and Langford,
whom she had not seen for nearly an hour, she believed
to have gone to the village.
It was not so, however; and, ere she had remained
long in that spot, thinking over her situation, and some-
what schooling herself for feelings which she could not
suppress, she heard a rapid footfall coming from the di-
rection of the house; and the thrill that went through
her heart, the agitation that took possession of her
whole frame, showed the quick memory of love. Had
she yielded to her first impulse, though there was no
one upon earth in whose society she felt so happy as in
that of the person who now sought her, she would have
risen and made her escape through the trees behind
her. She restrained herself, however, and sat still,
with a beating heart indeed, and with her breath almost
suppressed, while Langford, with a quick step, crossed
the bowling-green and approached her. Although she
strove to do so, although she would have given worlds
to appear unconcerned, she could not raise her eyes to
welcome the visiter with her usual smile, and she suf-
fered him to traverse the whole open space as if she
had not seen him, only looking up with a glance of con-
sciousness and a deep blush when he came close to
her.
Langford was agitated too, but the agitation showed
1tself merely in a great degree of paleness. His step
was firm, his manner was calm and decided.
“I have sought you,” he said, as he came up; “I saw
you go away from the house, and thought you had gone
to the flower-garden.”
Alice strove hard to reply as usual, but all that she
could say was, “I thought it would be cooler here;”
and there it stopped: she could go no farther.
“We shall be less likely to be interrupted, too,” re-
plied Langford; “and that, with me, is a great object
at the present moment, for I wish much to speak with
you; to detain you for half an hour; nay, perhaps, for
a whole hour with me alone.”
Alice could now reply nothing indeed; but with her
eyes bent down, and the tears ready to rise up in them,
she suffered Langford to take her hand and to proceed.
He seldom did anything like other men, acting upon
principles which we may hereafter pause upon for a mo,
ment; and he did not now come at Once to the declaration
*



## p. 81 (#83) ##############################################

THE ROBBER. 81
which Alice felt was hanging upon his lips, but went on to
speak of things apparently of far less interest. “You
will give me this half hour or this hour, I know, sweet
lady; and afterward you shall give me more L1 not, as
you please. I had some idea of detaining you before
you went out; but I am glad I did not, because I think,
when one has anything of great importance to say—
anything, I mean, which deeply interests and moves us,
in which the whole feelings of our hearts are engaged—
I think that there is no place we can so well choose as
in the face of Nature, under the free canopy of heaven.
One's spirit feels confined and crushed in chambers
built by hands; one's heart has not room to expand;
one's soul has not space to breathe forth at liberty.”
He saw that by this time Alice's emotion had a little
subsided; she had even ventured at the last words to
look up in his face; and he now went on, coming nearer
to the matter of his thoughts. “Alice,” he said, “dear
Alice, I would beseech you not to agitate yourself, and
yet I must speak to you on subjects which will create
much emotion.”
Did Alice think, even for a moment, that he was too
confident, that he was too sure £ such great
influence over her mind? She did not; but, even if such
an idea had presented itself for a moment, it would have
been done away immediately, for he went on. “I know
that I must greatly agitate and move you; for if my
brightest and dearest hopes are true, that heart is too
deep and too intense in all its feelings not to be agitated
by the words you must hear and the words you must
speak; and if those hopes are not true; if, like so many
other of life's illusions, they have given me a moment
of brightness but to plunge me in the deeper night, that
heart is too gentle and too kind to tell me that the whole
of the rest of my life is misery without feeling wrung
and pained. Alice, I have sought you, not to tell you
that I love you, for that you must have known long-”
“Oh no!” she cried, suddenly looking up through a
flood of bright and happy tears, “oh no ! I might thin
so, but I could not be sure of it!”
Langford smiled and pressed her hand to his lips.
“Do not think me presumptaeus,” he answered; “do
not think me presumptuous w I say that those words
and that look have already gi a reply, and made mc
most happy. Oh no. I am not presumptuous, for f

82 ThE ROBBER,
know Alice Herbert too well not to feel that such words
and such a look may well spare my agitating her farther
on one subject at least. Yet tell me, Alice, am I as hap-
py as I dream myself to be 1”
For a moment she made him no answer, and he add-
ed, “Oh speak!”
“What can I say, Langford?” she murmured, in a low
voice; “you, who know the human heart so well, must
have read mine perhaps too deeply.”
He gave up a few moments to thanks and to expres-
sions of his joy; but after that a graver shade came
upon his countenance, and he said, “There is much,
much, my beloved, to be spoken of between us. With
that bright confidence which you shall never find mis-
placed, you have yielded your heart and your happiness
to one of whose rank and station, fortune and family,
you know nothing.”
“I know himself,” replied Alice, gazing up in her
lover's face, “and I know that he is everything that is
noble and good.” - -
“May I ever justify such feelings, Alice,” replied
Langford ; “but still, my beloved, it is necessary that
you should know something of me, especially as I may
have to draw still more deeply upon your confidence,
to call for trust and reliance such as is seldom justified.
During the last three or four days, Alice, my mind has
been in a state of hesitation and doubt as to what course
I should pursue. I felt that, under some points of view,
I ought, in propriety, to communicate my feelings to
your father in the very first place; and yet, Alice, as I
was sure that you knew that I loved you; as I had de-
termined to bind you by no promise till your father's
full consent was obtained; and as I had to confide in
you, to consult with you, to ask your advice even upon
a matter that must affect the whole course of my life,
my fortune, my station, and everything—a matter which
for many reasons I do not wish to communicate to your
father at present, I have judged it best and determined
to open my whole heart to you at once.”
Alice listened with a slight look of anxiety, for she
had entertained some hopes that Langford had com-
municated his purpose to her father before he came to
seek her; but still her apprehensions of opposition
from one who loved her so much and esteemed him so
highly were not great, and she only replied, “But, of



## p. 83 (#85) ##############################################

THE ROBBER 83
course, you do not wish our engagements to be con
cealed from my father.”
“Not our engagements, sweet Alice,” replied Lang-
ford; “for, while I hold myself bound for ever to you,
I ask you to make no engagement, I suffer you to make
none, till you have your father's full consent; and my
love for you shall be told to him immediately. But let
me first inform you how I am situated. The property
which I actually possess is but small ; sufficient, in-
deed, to maintain me in comfort and independence as a
gentleman, but no more. My name and reputation with
my companions in the field and with those under whom
I have served is, I have every cause to believe, fair—
may I say it without vanity?—high. This small for-
tune and this good reputation are all that I absolutely
have to offer; but, at the same time, I tell you that a
much larger fortune, one that would at once place me
on a level in those respects with yourself, is withheld
from me unjustly, and cannot, I fear, be recovered by
law.”
“What matters it,” demanded Alice. “What matters
it, Langford ' ... My father's consent once given, will not
his house, his fortune be our own? What need of more?”
“To you, perhaps not, Alice,” replied her lover. “But
to me it would be painful; it would be the only painful
part of my fate to know that a great disparity existed
between your fortune and mine ; to have any one insin-
uate that my Alice had married a mere adventurer. In
regard, too, to your father's fortune, Alice, I have much
hereafter to say to you; I have something even to say
to him. But of that we will not speak now. Suffice it
that I could bear no great disparity. But, besides,” he
added, seeing her about to speak, “I have made a sol-
emn promise, Alice, to pursue the recovery of this prop-
erty which I mention without pause or hesitation.”
“But you said,” exclaimed Alice, “that it could not
be secovered by law.” -
‘. It cannot,” replied Langford, “for the papers by
which it could be recovered are withheld from me by
one powerful and daring, and I cannot obtain them by
any act which the law would justify.”
“Then give it up altogether,” exclaimed Alice. “Do
not, do not, Langford, attempt anything that is not jus-
tified by law.” - -
“But sometimes,” replied her lover, “the law is in

itself unjust; or else, as in the present instance, is im-
potent to work redress, and would justify the act if it
proved successful. The papers are withheld from me
by one, as I have said, powerful and daring. What
mandate of the law can make him give them up ! while
I, by force, if I chose to exert it, might take them for
myself; and the possession of them would at once jus-
tify the deed by which they were acquired.”
“Oh, no, no! do not attempt it, Langford,” cried Al-
ice. “Suppose you were to fail in obtaining them, what
terrible consequences might ensue! He might resist
force by force, blood might be spilled, and the man I
love become a murderer.”
Langford paused for a moment upon the words “The
man I love,” and casting his eyes towards the ground,
he fell into a sweet but short revery. A moment after
however, he returned to the subject, saying, “But my
promise, Alice, my promise to the dead?”
“Langford,” said Alice, gravely, and somewhat sad-
ly, laying her right hand at the same time upon his, in
which he had continued to hold her left, and gazing up
in his face with a look of tenderness and regard;
“Langford, I am no great casuist in such matters; but
I have always heard that no promise to do what is un-
lawful can be binding upon any man. God forbid that
I should hold that it is right to do any evil, even to the
breaking of the slightest promise; but here, Langford,
you are between two evils: the breaking of a promise,
and the committing of an unlawful act. The breaking
of that promise can do wrong to no one; the keeping it
may bring misery on yourself, on me, on all who know
you; may be followed by bloodshed; ay! and the loss
of your good name.”
“You are eloquent, my Alice,” replied Langford,
“and I believe you are right; but still the temptation is
so strong, the matter involved is so great and so im-
portant, the means of obtaining those papers without
force so very doubtful—”
“Oh, if there be means,” exclaimed Alice, “if there
be any means, employ them. Speak with my father
upon it; take counsel with him.”
“Alice,” replied her lover, “it is impossible. I must
not speak with him, I ought not to speak with him upon
this subject For his sake, Alice, for yours, I ought not.
Alice, forgive me if I am obliged to use some mystery

* THE ROBBER. 85
for the present. That mystery shall soon pass away.
and you shall know all.”
“I seek not to know it, Langford !” she replied, gazing
up in his face; “I am quite satisfied, I am quite sure !
Now and for ever my trust is entirely in you. Tell me
what you like, conceal from me what you like. I know
that I shall never hear of your doing what is wrong,
and as for all the rest, I care not.”
Langford could not resist such words. He threw his
arms round her and pressed her to his heart. His lips
met hers in the first kiss of love, and he set her heart at
ease by promising to use none but lawful means to ob-
tain even his right. He still held her gently, with one
arm thrown lightly round her, and her left hand locked
in his, when the sound of a footstep met his ear, and he
looked up. Alice's eyes were raised too, and her cheek
turned very red and then very pale; for at the aperture
at the other end of the bowling-green appeared no other
than Lord Harold advancing rapidly towards them.
The reader may have remarked, that whenever we
are interrupted in those seasons when the shy heart
comes forth from the depths in which it lies concealed,
and suns itself for a moment in the open daylight, the
person who breaks in upon us is sure to be the one of
all the world before whom we should least like to dis-
play the inmost feelings of our bosom. Had it been
her father who now approached, Alice would have run
up to him, placed her hand in his, hid her face upon his
bosom, and told him all at once. But, both on her own
account and on his, Alice would rather have beheld any
other person on the earth than Lord Harold at that mo-
ment. He could not but have seen the half embrace in
which Langford had held her; he could not but know
and divine the whole; and Alice felt grieved that such
knowledge must come upon him in so painful a man-
ner; while, though not ashamed, she felt abashed and
confused that any one should have been a witness to
the first endearment of acknowledged love. Langford’.
proud nostril expanded, and his head rose high; :
drawing the arm of Alice through his own, he advance
with her direct towards Lord Harold, as if about to re-
turn to the house. The young nobleman's countenance
was deadly pale, and he was evidently much moved,
but he behaved well and calmly.

“Your father wishes to speak to you, Alice,” he said
“I left him but now, just awake.”
Langford saw that Alice could not reply, and he an-
swered, “We are even now about to seek Sir Walter,
my lord.”
“I rather imagine that he has business which may re-
quire Mistress Alice's private attention,” replied Lord
Harold, in the same cold tone which both had used; “I
have also to request a few moments’ conversation with
Captain Langford. I will not detain him long.”
Alice suddenly raised her eyes, and looked from one
to the other. “Langford,” she said, aloud, “before I
leave you, I have one word more to say.”
“I will rejoin you here in a moment, my lord,” said
Langford, calmly. Lord Harold bowed; and Langford,
"with Alice's arm still resting in his, walked on towards
the house. Alice spoke to him, as they went, eagerly,
and in a low voice. His reply, as he left her at the
door of the manor, was, “On my honour! Be quite at
ease ! Nothing shall induce me.”
As soon as he had left her he returned at once to
Lord Harold, whom he found standing, with his arms
crossed upon his breast, in an attitude of deep thought.
“Your commands, sir,” said Langford, as soon as
they met. &
“By your leave, Captain Langford,” replied Lord
Harold, “we will walk a little farther, where we are not
likely to be interrupted.”
Langford signified his assent, and they proceeded in
silence for some way till they reached a small glade in
the park, where Langford paused, saying, “This is
surely far enough, Lord Harold, to prevent our being
interrupted in anything you can have to say to me or I
to you.”
“Perhaps it may be,” replied Lord Harold. “I have
a question to ask you which may perhaps lead to other
questions; and I beg you to give me a sincere and open
answer, as it may prevent unpleasant consequences to
us both.” -
“If I think fit to give you any answer at all, Lord
Harold,” replied Langford, “I will give you a sincere
one; but I must know what your question is before I
even consider whether I shall answer it or not.”
“The question is simply this,” rejoined Lord Harold,
in a somewhat bitter tone: “Who and what the gen-

tleman is who visits this part of the country, introduces
himself into our families and calls himself Captain Lang-
ford **
Langford smiled: “Had I, my lord,” he said, “either
visited your property, even as a sportsman, in answer
to your lordship's own invitation, or had I introduced
myself into your family, I might have thought myself.
bound to give some answer to your question; but, as I.
have done neither the one nor the other, I will beg you
to excuse me from replying to it; and I will pardon you
for putting it.”
“This is all very good, sir,” said Lord Harold, “all
very good indeed; but you do not escape me by an af-
fectation of dignity. In the first place, sir, you cannot
suppose that I shall conceal from Sir Walter Herbert
what I remarked to-day between yourself and his daugh-
ter.”
Langford turned very red, but he still replied calmly:
“In regard to that, my lord, you may do as you please.
To be a spy upon other people's actions, or a talebearer
in regard to a matter accidentally discovered, and not
intended for his eye, is certainly a pleasant employment
for a gentleman. But all these things depend upon
taste; and if Lord Harold’s taste lead him in such a way,
Heaven forbid that I should stop him 1"
Lord Harold bit his lip : “I shall not be put out of
temper, sir,” he replied, “by your sarcasm; and were
Captain Langford known to me as a gentleman of hon-
our and character, I should—whatever might be my own
personal feelings in this matter—I should be far from
betraying a secret which came accidentally to my
knowledge; but when Captain Langford is totally un-
known in this part of the country; when I have reason
to believe that he is not always called by the same name
or seen in the same character; when, if short, Captain
Langford is a very doubtful personage, and I find him
introducing himself into the house of my oldest and best
friend, and, apparently unknown to that friend, engaging
the affections of his daughter, I feel myself bound in
honour to be no party to such a transaction, but to bring
the whole matter to light as soon as possible.”
Langford had remained standing, while the other
spoke, in an attitude of attention and with his eyes bent
down upon the ground. The moment that Lord Harold
had done he raised them, and, with a degree of tranquil-

lity which the young nobleman did not expect, replied,
“Perhaps, my lord, you are in the right. I rather be-
<lieve, in your situation, I should act in the same manner.”
Lord Harold looked both surprised and confused
“This is very extraordinary,” he said, “and I cannot
but believe that there is some design under it. I must
insist, sir, upon having an explanation on the spot as to
who and what you are; as to what is your title in the
society in which I find you, and what your claims to the
hand of one of the first heiresses in this country.”
“Your pardon, my lord,” replied Langford; “you are
now going too far. I shall give every explanation that
I think fitting to the father of the young lady in ques-
tion; to you I shall give none till you show me some
right which you may have to interfere in the affairs of
Mistress Alice Herbert; which, I rather suspect, you
cannot do.”
Lord Harold again bit his lip; but he replied almost
immediately, “The right I have, sir, is twofold: that of
one of her oldest friends, and that of an applicant for
her hand.”
For a moment Langford was about to demand, in re-
ply, whether Lord Harold meant an accepted or a re-
jected suiter; but he was generous, and refrained. “In
neither quality,” he said, “can I recognise in you any
right to interfere; and you will pardon me if I say that
I will not only give you no explanation whatever on
the subject, but will not condescend to hear you speak
any further on a matter with which you have no title to
meddle.”
“Then, sir,” replied Lord Harold, sharply, “nothing
remains but to bid you draw your sword. I do you
honour in taking it for granted that you are worthy of
mine;” and, as he spoke, he drew his weapon from the
sheath, and, with the point dropped, stood as if in ex-
pectation that Langford would follow his example.
Langford remained, however, with his arms crossed
upon his chest, and a somewhat melancholy smile upon
his countenance. “Once more,” he said, “you must
pardon me, Lord Harold: neither in this matter can I
gratify you; not alone because it is a stupid and con-
temptible habit, only worthy of cowards or of boys who
have no other way of showing their courage, but—”
“Well said, Master Harry,” cried a voice close behind
them: “well said, well said : I think, my little lord-

to bore a hole in his neighbour, like Smith, the house-
carpenter, with his long gimlet ! Let us look at your

John, the half-witted man of the village, whom we have ..
before described, advanced, extending his hand to take
hold of the blade of Lord Harold's sword.
The young nobleman pushed him sharply aside, how-
ever, bidding him begone with an angry frown.
“Well, I'll be gone,” replied the half-witted man,
“but I'll be back again in a minute, with more hands to
help me;” and away he ran in the direction of the stream
and the village.
“Now, sir! quick!” exclaimed Lord Harold. “If
you would not have me suppose you both a coward and
an impostor, draw your sword, and give me satisfac-
tion at once.”
“Your lordship may suppose anything that you
please,” replied Langford; “having done nothing that
can reasonably dissatisfy you, I shall certainly do no-
thing to give you any other sort of satisfaction.”
“Then, sir, I shall treat you as you deserve,” replied
Lord Harold, “and chastise you as a cowardly knave;”
and, putting up his sword, he advanced to strike his op-
ponent.
But Langford caught his hand in his own powerful
grasp, and stopped him, saying, “Hold, Lord Harold,
hold! I will give you one word of explanation ' If,
after having heard that, you choose to draw your sword
and seek my life, you shall do so; but remember, as
you are a man of honour, to none, no, not to the near-
est and dearest, must you reveal the import of these
words;” and, drawing him closer to him, he whispered
what seemed to be a single word in the young noble-
man's ear. Langford then let go his hold; and, pale
as ashes, with a quivering lip and a straining eye, Lord
Harold staggered back. His companion turned upon
his heel and walked away, either not hearing or not
choosing to attend to the young nobleman's entreaty
to speak with him one word more.
Langford took his way direct to the Manor House;
but, upon entering the door which stood open to the
park, he perceived a good deal of bustle and confusion
among the servants; and # asking if Sir Herbert were

in the library, the reply was, “Yes;” but it was added,
that he and Mistress Alice were both busy with a gen-
tleman on matters of deep importance. While he was
speaking with the servant. Langford, through a door
which stood open at the end of a long passage, and af-
forded a view into the court, perceived Lord Harold
come in with a quick step and a somewhat disordered
air; and mounting his horse, which was held by one of
Sir Walter's grooms, ride slowly away, without even
attempting to enter the house.
“I am about to walk to the village,” continued Lang-
ford, speaking to the servant. “Will you tell Sir Wal-
ter so when he is visible; for I expect a messenger from
London, and may not be back to supper if I find letters
which require an answer?”
He then proceeded through the house, gained the
road which led over the bridge, and was proceeding to-
wards the village in the twilight which was now begin-
ning to fall, when he thought he recognised a form that
was advancing towards him, though still at some dis-
tance. It proved to be that of the same fair-haired
boy, named Jocelyn, whom we have more than once
had occasion to mention. He spoke not a word when
he came near, but placed a letter in Langford’s hands,
which the other tore open and read, though with some
difficulty, from the obscurity of the hour.
“There is scarcely time,” he said, after he had made
out the contents of the epistle, which was very short.
“There is scarcely time. Nevertheless, tell him I will
be there; but say also, good Jocelyn, that my resolution
is the same as when we last met. I will not try it!”
“I will tell him,” was the boy's only reply; and, leav-
ing Langford, he ran down the road by the stream with a
rapid pace.
* CHAPTER VIII.
THE moon had not risen; the sun had gone down;
the sky, which for near a month had been as calm and
serene as a good mind, was covered over with long
ines of dark gray cloud, heavy, and near the earth:

when a solitary horseman took his station under a
broad old tree upon the wide waste called Uppington
Moor, and gazed forth as well as the growing darkness
would let him. It was a dim and sombre scene, unsat-
isfactory to the eye, but exciting to the imagination.
Everything was vague and undefined in the shadows of
that hour, and the long streaks of deeper and fainter
brown which varied the surface of the moor spoke
merely of undulations in the ground, marking the great
extent of the plain towards the horizon. A tall, soli-
tary, mournful tree might be seen here and there, add-
ing to the feeling of vastness and solitude; and about
the middle of the moor, as one looked towards the west,
was a small detached grove, or, rather, clump of large
beeches, presenting a black irregular mass, at the side
of which the lingering gleam of the northwestern sky
was reflected in some silvery lines upon what seemed
a considerable piece of water. That was the only light
which the landscape contained, and it would have cut
harsh with the gloomy and ominous view around, had
not a thin mist, rising over the whole, softened the fea-
tures of the scene, and left them still more indistinct
and melancholy. .
It was an hour and a place fit for sad thoughts and
dark forebodings; and the horseman sat upon his tall
powerful gelding in the attitude of one full of medita-
tion. He had suffered the bridle to drop, his head was
slightly bent forward, and his eye strained upon the
scene before him; while his mind seemed to drink in,
from its solemn and cheerless aspect, feelings as dark
and dismal as itself. He sat there about a quarter of an
hour, and not a sound had been heard upon the moor
but the deep sort of sobbing creaking of a neighbouring
marsh, or the shrill cry of some bird of night as it
skimmed by with downy and noiseless wings. There
was not a breath of air stirring; there was no change
took place in the aspect of the sky or the earth; it was
as if nature were dead, and the feeling seemed to be-
come oppressive, for the horseman at length gently
touched his beast with his heel, and made him move
slowly out from under the branches of the tree.
Scarcely had he done so, however, when the distant
sound of a horse's feet was heard, as if coming at a
very tardy and heavy pace from the west. The sound,
indeed, would not have been perceptible at that dis.

tance but for the excessive stillness of all around, and
the eagerness with which the traveller listened. His
eye was now bent anxiously, too, upon the western
gleam in the water, and in a few minutes the dark figure
of another man on horseback was seen against the
brighter background thus afforded, riding slowly on, as
the road he followed wound round the mere.
It was like a scene in a phantasmagoria, and in a mo-
ment after two more figures were added, and all three
suddenly stopped. None of the minute parts of their
proceedings were visible, and it was impossible, at that
distance, to discern how they were occupied; but a
moment after there seemed a sudden degree of agita-
tion in the group; then came a bright flash, followed at
a considerable interval by the report of a pistol, and im-
mediately after all three horsemen disappeared.
“What may this mean?” said the stranger, aloud.
“I fear there is mischief.” The sound of his voice
seemed strange in the midst of this solitude; but he
had scarcely spoken when the stillness was again broken
by the noise of a horse's feet; but this time it came
from another direction, not exactly opposite, but much
to the right hand of the spot whence the former sounds
had proceeded, and the beast was evidently galloping
as fast as he could over turf. It came nearer and nearer.
and the watcher went back under the tree.
At length another powerful cavalier became visible,
approaching at full speed; and, as he drew nigh, he
looked round more than once, and pulled up his horse
suddenly by the tree. “Are you there?” he said, in a
low voice; and the next moment the other came forth
and joined him. -
“Quick! quick | Master Harry,” continued the one
who had joined him; “put your horse into a gallop, .
and come on with all speed.”
“But I told you, Franklin,” replied the other, holding
back, “I told you that I would have nothing to do with
it! What I saw a month ago under the park wall was
quite sufficient; and I would have no hand in such a
business were it to put a crown upon my head.”
“Foolish boy! the business is done without you to
a certain point,” replied his companion. “I have served
you whether you would or not; and I suppose, of
course, you will be ungrateful. Come on with me, and
wou shall have the key of the chest, which I have ven

tured my neck to get for you. You have nothing to do
but to walk in and take what is your own. But come
on 1 come on quick! You would not have me taken, I
suppose; and I have reason to think I am followed.”
Thus saying, he put his horse again into a gallop, and
Langford followed at the same pace. Two or three
times, as they rode on, Franklin Gray looked back over
the moor; but no moving object of any kind was to be
seen, except one of those creeping phosphoric lights
which linger on the edges of an old marsh; no sound
of any kind was to be heard but the measured beating
of their horses’ feet upon the hollow-sounding turf.
At length, when they had gone about two miles
farther, Franklin Gray checked his horse's speed, say-
ing, “There is no one following now, yet they made
the signal from the hill ? Did you not hear a pistol
shot just before I came up !” -
“Yes,” replied Langford; “I heard it distinctly, and
saw the flash. Was that as a signal that some one was
following you!”
“It was,” answered Gray. “But how you could see
the flash I don't understand, for they were down below
the brow of the hill, where one can see both roads to
the castle.” |
“Oh no !” said Langford. “The men who fired that
shot were upon the moor close by Upwater Mere, and I
very much fear, Gray, that some of these accursed evil
companions of yours have been again committing an
act that you neither knew of nor desired.”
“If they have,” exclaimed Gray, with a horrid im-
precation, “I will shoot the first of them, were he my
own brother.”
“How many were there of them on the watch?” de
manded Langford.
“Two,” replied his companion.
“Then I will tell you what I saw,” answered Langford.
“As I sat on my horse and looked out over the mere
which just caught a gleam from the sky, the figure of a
horseman crossed the light as if he were going to the
castle. Just at that minute two more came out upon
him from among the beeches, it seemed to me; then
came the pistol shot; and a minute after they all disap-
peared.” -
Gray gave utterance to another terrible oath; and
then, after thinking a few minutes, he added, “But it

can’t be any of my people ! They dared not, after the
warning I gave them about that bad business under the
park fence.” -
“At all events,” cried Langford, reining up his horse
entirely, “had we not better go back and see ? I fear
very much, Franklin, that they have shot the man, who-
ever he is.”
“No, no,” replied Franklin; “if they have shot him,
he is shot, and there is no need of our meddling with the
matter.”
“But he may be merely wounded,” replied Langford;
“we had better go back.”
“No !” thundered Franklin Gray, “I tell you no ! It
is mere madness! We are but half a mile from the
house: when I have got there we shall learn who has
done this, and I will send out and see if there is any
one hurt. Come on, come on!” -
Langford followed his bidding, and, renewing their
quick pace, they rode on for about half a mile farther,
till, amid a clump of tall trees at the very edge of the
moor, where some poor, thin, unproductive fields con- .
nected it with the cultivated country, they perceived a
light shining from a small window in a tall building be-
fore them.
At that period there still remained scattered over the
face of England a number of those edifices which, for-
tified to a certain degree, combined the modern house
with the ancient feudal hold, and had been rendered
very serviceable to both parties in the progress of the
great rebellion. These fortified houses were of every
size, from that which really well merited the name of
castle, to that which was no more than a mere tower; and
many of them, either from being injured by the chances
of war, or from having lost a great part of their utility
when the scourge of civil contention was removed from
the country, had gone completely to decay, or had been
applied to the calmer and more homely uses of the barn,
the grange, or the farmhouse.
Such was the house which Langford and his compan-
ion now approached; and, as far as the darkness of the
hour suffered its outline to appear, it seemed to the
former to be a tall heavy tower of stonework, with four
small windows on the side next to them. Beneath its
rotection, and attached to it on one side, with the ga-
e end turned towards the road, was a lower building,


## p. 95 (#97) ##############################################

THE ROBBER. 95
with a high peaked roof of slates; and close by, another
mass of masonry, apparently the ruins of a church or
chapel. The light that the horseman had seen came
from one of the upper windows of the tower; but there
were lights, also, in the less elevated building by its
side. A low wall stood before the whole, enclosing a
little neglected garden; and through a gate which stood
open in this wall Franklin Gray led his companion in,
and up to the door of the tower. There, beside the
door, stood the ancient steps, which many a burly cav-
alier in the Hudibrastic days, and in days long before
that, had employed to mount his horse's back; and there,
too, on either side of the entrance, was many a ring, sta-
ple, and hook, for the purpose of fastening up the troop-
ers’ horses, while their masters rested or caroused in
the hall hard by.
Having attached their bridles to two of these hooks,
Franklin Gray and his companion proceeded to seek
admission into the tower. To gain this, Gray first
struck the door three or four times distinctly with his
heavy hand. The moment he had done so, a light step
was heard running along within; and after manifold
bolts and bars had been withdrawn, the boy Jocelyn
threw open the door, and Langford followed his com-
panion into a low, narrow entrance hall, on the right of
which was another door, and at the end a dim flight of
stone steps leading apparently to the upper apartments.
Scarcely, however, had the foot of Franklin Gray
fallen three times on that stone passage, when a light
came gleaming down the stairs; and the next instant
the flutter of a woman's garments was seen, as she de-
scended with a step of joy. She was as lovely a crea-
ture as the eye of man ever rested upon, though the first
years of youthful grace were passed, and though the sun
of a warmer land than this had died her skin with a rich
brown. Her eyes—her large, full, liquid eyes—were as
black as jet, and the long dark fringe that edged both
the upper and the under lid left but little of the white
visible. The glossy black hair, divided on the forehead,
was tied in a large massy knot behind, without any or-
nament whatsoever; but along the whole line might be
traced a strong undulation, which told that, if free, it
would have fallen in ringlets round her face; and, even
as it was, two or three thick curls escaped from the knot
behind, and hung in glossy masses on her neck. Her

age might be three or four-and-twenty, and her form had
the fulness of that age, but without having lost any of
the symmetry of youth. /
She carried a lamp in her hand, and the light of it
showed her dark eyes sparkling with joy as they rested
upon Franklin Gray. Setting down the light upon the
stairs, she darted forward at once, and cast herself upon
his bosom, exclaiming, with a strong foreign accent,
“You have come back! you have come back! Oh, I
have been so uneasy about you!”
“But why, my Mona?” demanded Franklin Gray,
with his whole tone and manner changed to one of the
utmost gentleness as soon as he addressed her. “Why
more to-night than at other times when I am obliged to
leave you?”
“Oh, I do not well know,” she replied; “but you
kissed me twice before you went and then you came
back to kiss me once more, and bid me remember you;
and I felt sure you were going on some dangerous ex-
pedition; I felt sad at heart myself, too, as if some evil
would come of this night.”
“Evil has come of it, I fear,” replied Franklin Gray;
but he then added quickly, seeing her turn pale at his
words, “Evil not upon me or of my doing, Mona. But
go up again, beloved! go up again! and I will come to
you directly. You see I have some one with me.”
She turned her eyes upon Langford, whom she had
not seemed to notice before; and then, bowing her head
gracefully and slowly, she raised the lamp again and
disappeared up the steps.
When she was gone Franklin Gray turned round and
gazed upon Langford for a moment with a proud yet
melancholy smile. There was a world of meaning in
his look, and Langford could only reply to it by ex-
claiming, with a glance still more sorrowful, “Oh, Gray,
this is very sad !”
“Come, come,” cried his companion, “it shall be
amended some day, Harry. Come, Jocelyn,” he con-
tinued, turning to the boy, “tell me, Master Page, who
are in the hall, and how many?”
The boy's brow became grave at the question. “There
are but three, sir,” he replied; “there is James of Cov-
entry, and there is Doveton and Little Harvey.”
“Indeed,” said Gray, shutting his teeth close, as if to
keep down angry feelings that were rising fast; “in-

deed;” and he threw open the door with his right
hand which led into a small dark room. That again
he strode across, giving Langford a sign to follow, and
then opened another door, which admitted them into
a much larger chamber, well lighted, in the midst of
which was a large table furnished with a flagon and
some drinking-cups. At the farther end sat two men
playing with dice, while a third, a short, smart-looking
personage, was standing behind observing their game.
They ceased when Franklin Gray and his companion
appeared; and the merriment which they evidently had
been enjoying was over in a moment.
“But you three left!” said Gray, as he entered; “but
you three left! Where are Hardcastle and Wiley?”
“They went out shortly after you, Captain Gray,”
replied one of the," who were playing; “I can’t teli
where they are.”
“Doveton,” replied Gray, in a calm, grave tone, “you
are a gentleman and a soldier; so are you, James; and
Master Harvey, too, though he did not serve with us
either in Germany or in the New World, has had the
honour of serving in Ireland, and is a man of honour.
Now I ask you all, straightforwardly, where are these
two men gone to 1 Marcham and Henry of the Hill I
took with me; all the others I know about also; but
where are Wiley and Hardcastle, and what are they
about !”
“Why, really, sir,” replied the man called Doveton,
“we can only tell by guess; for, since that business
down in the green lane, they have kept very much by
themselves, and don't seem to deal fairly with us, es-
pecially Wiley.”
“I’ll tell you what, captain,” said the man who was
standing behind, and whom they called among them-
selves Little Harvey, “I wish Wiley was out among
us; he will get us all into mischief some day. He does
not do things in agentleman-like way. I guess what he
is gone after; but he has not succeeded, I see.” And,
as he spoke, he gave a significant glance towards Lang-
ford, as if he were in some degree connected with the
matter in question. *
“Indeed!” said Gray; “I suspect your meaning, Har-
vey; but let us hear more plainly what you think.
Though I direct and guide, and am always willing to
ta' : greatest dangers on myself, still we are com-

rades, and should treat each other as such. What is it
you think, Harvey?”
“I won't say what I think,” replied the man, “but I'll
say what I saw. When you sent the boy Jocelyn down
to the manor, Wiley cross-questioned him both before
he went and when he came back; and when he heard
him give you a message about a gentleman meeting you
on the moor, he whispered a good deal to Hardcastle,
who came up and asked me if I would go along with
them upon an enterprise which must be quite secret,
and which must be done without your knowing it. I
refused; and told him I thought that, after the business
down in the lane, he had better not let Wiley lead him;
but to that he answered that this was a matter which
could not fail as the other had done, and that it would
be over in five minutes. I said I would not go, how-
ever; and they went without me.”
“Hark, they are coming!” said Gray, as the sound

“Let them in the back way, Jocelyn, and bring in sup-
per. Here! Come with me, Master Harry.” And he
led the way back into the hall by which they had at
first entered, and in which there still remained the lamp
that the boy Jocelyn had carried when he gave them
admittance. Gray carefully shut the doors behind
him; and when he stood alone in the passage with Lang-
ford, he unbuttoned his vest, and took from an inner
pocket a key of a very peculiar and extraordinary form.
“There is the key, Master Harry,” he said, speaking
quickly, and with strong passions of some kind evi-
dently struggling in his breast. “Your own fate is now
in your own power! Manage it as you will!”
“But tell me how this has been obtained,” said Lang.

“I have no time for long stories,” replied his com-

who knew the house well, walked through it this night
from one end to the other; and within six yards of the
old man himself, with nothing but a door between us,
took this key from the hiding-place where he thought
it so safe, and brought it away undiscovered. Now,
Harry, leave me! I am not in a humour to speak much.
I have matters before me that may well make me si-
lent. Mount your horse, and be gone with all speed.

Why do you linger! Oh! I will send out ere ten min-
utes be over; and, if there be a possibility of undoing
what has been done amiss, it shall be undone, on my .
honour. Take the back road,” he added, as he opened
the door for Langford; “take the back road; and, for
worlds, go no more upon the moor to-night! I ask
you for my own sake,” he added, seeing his companion
hesitate; “not for yours, but for mine !”
Langford made no reply, but, mounting his horse, rode
away with feelings of a nature the most mingled and
the most painful.
Those of the man he left behind were of a different
character, but still terrible. With Langford there were
feelings which he seldom experienced, doubt and hesi-
tation as to his own course of action, mingling with
vague apprehensions of evil, and deep regret to see a
man possessed of many noble qualities, who had been
his friend, his companion, and even his protector in the
early days of youth, now plunged into a current terri-
ble in itself and terrible in its consequences; following
a course which he had long suspected that Gray did
really follow, but without having conviction forced upon
him till that night.
With Franklin Gray it was very different; his whole
feelings, for the time, were swallowed up in one stern
and gloomy resolution.
There was anger, indeed, at the bottom of that reso-
lution; wrath of the most bitter and deadly kind; but
even that was almost lost in the effort to exclude from
his thoughts everything that might shake, even in the
least degree, the dark and terrible determination he had
formed.
As soon as Langford had gone he returned to the hali
in which he had left his comrades; and there, as he ex-
pected, he found the party increased by the presence
of the two men, Wiley and Hardcastle, whose names
we have mentioned more than once, and whom we have
seen busy in the attack upon Alice Herbert. -
It was evident that some conversation had passed
between them and the others regarding the indignation
which they had excited in their leader; and while, in
the rough countenance of Hardcastle, might be traced a
great deal of shame and apprehension, in the more cun-
ning face of Wiley appeared a degree of hesitating un-
certainty, mingling strangely with dogged defiance, and

making him look like an ill-tempered hound about to re-
ceive the lash, but not very sure whether to lie down
and howl, or fly at the throat of the huntsman. The
boy Jocelyn was busily bringing in some dishes and
setting them on the table; but he glanced at Franklin
Gray from time to time, seeming to know better than
any one present the character of the man with whom
they had to deal, and to divine what was likely to be
the issue.
Franklin Gray said not a word in regard to the mat-
ter which was in all their thoughts; but, sitting down
at the head of the table, he made some observations
upon the bread, which was not good; and then added,
speaking to the others, “Begin, begin ' Marcham and
Henry of the Hill won't be long.”
“I heard them coming over the hill but now,” said
the boy Jocelyn. -
Gray made no reply, and the rest began their meal in
silence; but he ate nothing, looking curiously at the
knife in his hand as if there was something very inter-
esting in the blade. He made the boy give him a silver
cup, indeed, full of wine from the tankard; and, as he
was drinking it, the two others whom he had mentioned
came in laughing, and seemed surprised to see the grave
and stern manner in which the supper was passing.
The matter was soon explained, however; for, no
sooner had they sat down in the places left for them,
than Franklin Gray fixed his eyes upon Wiley, and said,
“Now, my Masters Wiley and Hardcastle, we are all
present but two: be so good as to tell me where you
have been to-night?”
The time which had elapsed; the indifference, and
even carelessness which had hitherto appeared in Gray's
manner; and a cup or two of wine which he himself had
drunk, had removed the degree of apprehension which
at first mingled with the sullen determination of Wiley;
and he replied at once, with a look of effrontery, “I
don’t think that at all necessary, captain ' I rather be.
lieve that I have as much right to ride my horse over
any common in the kingdom as you have, without giv.
ing you any account of it either.”
“You hear,” said Franklin Gray, looking round calm.
ly to the rest, “you hear!” -
“Come, come, Master Wiley,” cried the man called
Doveton, “that won’t do after what we all swore when

we came down here. Come, Hardcastle, you are the
best of the two; come, you tell Captain Gray at once
what you have been about. We must know, if it be but
for our own safety.”
“Oh! I'll tell at once,” said Hardcastle. “Devilish
sorry am I that I ever went; and I certainly would not
have gone had I known how it would turn out. I'll
never go again with Wiley as long as I live: I told him
so as we came over the common.”
Wiley muttered something not very laudatory of his
companion; but it was drowned in the stern voice of
Franklin Gray, who exclaimed, “Go on, Hardcastle!”
“Why, we went out to the beeches by Upwater
Mere,” replied Hardcastle; “and we had not been there
long when up came some one on horseback, going along
slowly towards the castle. It was not the person we
were looking for, however—”
“Pray, who were you looking for ?” interrupted
Franklin Gray.
“Why, I think that is scarcely fair, captain,” said
Hardcastle.
“It matters not,” replied Gray; “I know without
your telling me. Go on!”
“Well, as the young man came up,” continued the
other, “Wiley said we might as well have what he had
upon him. So we rode up, and asked him to stop quite
civilly; but, instead of doing so, he drew his sword, and
spurred on his horse upon Wiley, and—”
“Well,” exclaimed Gray, impatiently, “what then :
I heard the pistol fired,” he said, seeing the man hesi-
tate, “so tell the truth.”
“Well,” said Hardcastle, “well;” and, as he spoke,
he turned somewhat pale: “well, then Wiley fired, you
know, and brought him down; and we pulled him under
the beeches, and took what we could get. We have
not divided it yet, but it seems a good sum.”
As his companion had been detailing the particulars
of their crime, the changes which had come over Wiley’s
countenance were strange and fearful. He had watched
with eager anxiety the countenance of Franklin Gray,
who sat nearly opposite to him at the other end of the
table; but, being able to gather nothing from those stern
dark features, he ran his eye rapidly round the faces of
the rest; and, after several changes of expression, re-
sumed, as well as he com' the look of cunning and

daring impudence which he had at first put on. The
entrance of the boy Jocelyn with some plates, just be-
hind him, however, made him give a sharp start and
look round. Franklin Gray fixed his eyes upon the
boy and waved his hand; and Jocelyn immediately went
round to the other side of the table. -
“Hardcastle,” said their leader, “I shall find some
means of punishing you. As for you, Wiley—”
“You shall not punish me, Captain Gray !” interrupt-
ed Wiley, knitting his brows and speaking through his
teeth; “you shall not punish me! for, by —, if you
don’t mind what you are about, I'll hang you all.”
Franklin Gray sat and heard him calmly, keeping his
eyes fixed upon him with stern unchanging gaze till he
had done speaking. He then looked round once more,
saying, “You hear !” and, at the same moment, he at
once drew a pistol from under his coat. Every face
around turned pale but his own, and Wiley started up
from the table. But, before he could take a single step,
...: and while yet, with agony of approaching fate upon him,
.*
he gazed irresolute in the face of his leader, the unerring
hand of Franklin Gray had levelled the pistol and fired.
The ball went right through his head; the unhappy
man bounded up two or three feet from the ground, and
then fell dead at the end of the table. Franklin Gray
sat perfectly still, gazing through the smoke for about
a minute, and through the whole hall reigned an awful
silence. He then laid the pistol calmly down on the
table before him, and drew forth a second.
Hardcastle crossed his arms upon his breast, and
looked him full in the face, saying, “Well, captain, I am
ready.”
“You mistake me,” said Gray, laying down the pis-
tol on the table with the muzzle turned towards him-
self. “My friends, if I have done wrong by the shot I
have fired, any of you that so pleases has but to take
up that pistol and use it as boldly as I have done its
fellow. What say you, am I right or wrong !”
“Right, right !” replied every voice.
“Well, then,” said Gray, putting up the weapons
again, “some of you take him down; and you, Dove-
ton and Marcham, hark ye;” and he spoke a few words
to them apart. “Take Hardcastle with you,” he added;
“that shall be his punishment!” So saying, he turned,
took up a lamp that stood near, and left the hall."

Franklin Gray mounted the steps in the tower that
- we have mentioned slowly and sadly, paused half way
up, and fell into deep thought. His revery lasted but a
minute: he then proceeded, and reached the room
where the fair being whom he called Mona was watch-
ing anxiously for his coming. Her eyes questioned
him, but he made no reply in words. He threw his
right arm round her, however, and rested his face upon |

CHAPTER IX.
FoR nearly three miles Langford rode rapidly on. His
mind was in that state of confusion and uncertainty which
admitted not of any slow movement of the body; but as
he thought again and again of all that had occurred, he
the more deeply regretted that he had ever gone to the e.
rendezvous with Franklin Gray, although his purpose .
in there going was to separate his own proceedings for -
ever from those of one whose present pursuits could be *
no longer doubtful. When Langford had known him in ..
former years, he was a wild and reckless soldier of for- *
tune, whose bold, rash spirit had prevented rather than
aided him in rising to those high grades in the service
which his talents might otherwise have obtained. His
heart had ever, as far as Langford had seen it, been
kind, noble, and generous; there were many circum-
stances which had connected them closely in our hero's
rly life; and in himself and his fate Franklin Gray
ad ever taken a deep and affectionate interest.
His hatred of inactivity, his love of enterprise, his
daring courage, his strong and determined resolution,
his rapid powers of combination, and that peculiar tal-
* for command which is a gift rather than an acquire-
* , ment, had made him loved and admired by the soldiery
under him, and might have gone far to constitute one
of the greatest generals of the age. But by his fellow-
officers he had never been loved, and by those above
him he had constantly been used, but had never been

trusted or liked. In truth, there was a fierce and over.
bearing spirit in his bosom, a contempt for other men's
opinions, and an abhorrence of the ordinary littleness
of human nature, which prevented him from seeking or
winning the regard of any one towards whom some
peculiar circumstance or some extraordinary powers
had not excited in his bosom feelings either of tender-
ness or of respect; and for this reason he had never
been loved. Why he had never been trusted was an-
other matter. He had set out in life depending more
upon feeling than upon principle as his guide; and
though, as he went on, he had framed for his own bo-
som a sort of code of laws by which he was strictly
bound, those laws did not always very well accord with
the ordinary code of mankind; and, if generally acted
upon, must have been disastrous to society. Those
who disliked him—very often for his superiority to
themselves—were glad to find in his failings a specious
excuse for undervaluing his better qualities, and thus he
had been always thwarted and bitterly disappointed in
his progress in life. •
Brought up as a soldier from his earliest years, he
had ever looked upon strife as his profession, life as one
great campaign, the world as a battle-field, mankind
either enemies or fellow-soldiers. The great law that
he had laid down for himself was, never to measure
himself against any but those who were equal to the
strife; and he would just as soon have thought of inju-
ring the weak, the innocent, or the defenceless, as he
would of murdering the wounded in an hospital. The
proud, the haughty, and the strong he took a pleasure
in humbling or overthrowing, even when bound to the
same cause with himself; and the constant single com-
bats in which he was engaged had raised him up a bad
name in the service. -
In other respects, though no one could ever accuse
Gray of injuring the peasant or taking away a part of
the honest earnings of the farmer, though, even under
the orders of his general, he would take no part in rais-
ing contributions from the hardworking and industrious
and it was in vain to send him upon such expeditions.
yet there had been many a tale current in the camp of
Gray and his troopers sacking and burning the castles -
in the Palatiñate, driving the cattle from under the very
guns of the enemy's fortresses, and sweeping the wealth

from the palace of the prince or the bishop. Thus he
nad established in some degree the character of a daring,
but somewhat marauding officer; and any soldier of
more than ordinary enterprise and rashness ever sought
to be enrolled in his troop. He had left the service of
France in disgust some time before Langford, and they
had not met again till Langford, called suddenly to the
deathbed of a parent, found Gray, who had known her
and hers in happier days, tending her with the care and
kindness of a son.
Of what had taken place in the interim Langford was
ignorant. From time to time, Gray talked of other.
lands which he had visited, and more burning climates
which he had known; but he did so in a vague and ob-
scure manner, which excited curiosity without inviting
inquiry. Langford had made none; and, though they
had met frequently since, and dark suspicions and ap-
prehensions—springing from a comparison of Gray's
former poverty and his known prodigality with the
wealth he seemed now to have at command—had from
time to time crossed his friend’s mind in regard to the
pursuits to which he had dedicated himself, it was only
on the occasion of the present visit to Moorhurst that
Langford had obtained a positive certainty of the pain-
ful truth. As soon as he had obtained that certainty,
he determined to warn, to exhort, to beseech his former
friend to leave the dangerous pursuits in which he was
"… engaged, to offer once more to share with him all his
little wealth, in gratitude for many an act of kindness
gone before, and for a service that Gray was even then
anxious to do him, at the risk of life itself; but on no
account whatsoever to participate in any scheme con-
ducted by the other, however great and important the
object to be gained for himself.
His £ and the temporary disappearance of
Gray and his companions from that part of the country,
had prevented Langford from notifying to him this in-
tention fully after the night of the attack upon Alice

* - before; and he had gone to the rendezvous appointed

followed, the enterprise proposed. All that he had
, seen had been terribly painful to him; and, in what had
occurred upon the moor, he had too good reason to be-

lieve that an act had been committed which he should
not be justified in concealing. Yet how was he to re-
veal it without the basest breach of confidence and the
grossest ingratitude towards a man who had been risk-
ing all to serve him? How was he to denounce the
crime that had been committed, and bring to justice the
perpetrators thereof, without involving Gray in the same
destruction ?
Such were the matters in his thoughts as he rode rap-
idly on towards the Manor House; but, by the time he
had gone about three miles, his mind had been naturally
led to inquire who was the unfortunate person that had
been attacked; and, for the first time, an apprehension
crossed his mind that it might be Lord Harold.
“And yet,” thought Langford, as he rode along, “he
would never go over the moor at that time of night, and
alone. He must have been home long before, too :
nevertheless, he set out very slowly; and he seemed
to turn to the right as if he were going by the moor.
He may have loitered by the way, or visited some cot-
tage, or called at some house. Good God! this uncer-
tainty is not to be borne. I must and will go back to
the moor.”
As he thus thought he turned his horse short round,
and galloped back as fast as possible, following the road
which led to the piece of water called Upwater Mere.
By the time he reached it the moon was just rising, and
spreading through the hazy sky, near the horizon, a red
and ominous glare. It served to cast some light upon
the road, however; and Langford, calculating with the
keen accuracy of a soldier, had fixed exactly upon the
spot, before he reached it, where he had seen the un-
fortunate traveller encountered by his two assailants.
When he did reach that spot, the deep gory stains in
the sandy road but too plainly showed him he was right;
and he traced the course of the murderers along by the
thick drops of gore, till the track was lost in the grass
beneath the beech trees. The darkness which reigned
under their branches rendered all farther search fruit
less; and, after having given up nearly half an hour to
the painful but unsuccessful task, he once more mount-
ed his horse, and, with feelings of deep gloom and de-
spondency, took his way back towards tho Manor
House.
It was nearly eleven o’clock at night ere Langford
%

reached the gates, and the family generally retired to
rest before that hour.
Certain doubts and apprehensions, however, in regard
to the affairs of Sir Walter Herbert—doubts and appre-
hensions springing from a thousand minute incidents,
which he had noticed while staying as a visiter in the
house—had induced him to inquire farther, from sources
whence he might derive certain information; and the in-
formation he had thus acquired made him now deter-
mine to return to the manor that night rather than go to
the inn, though the hour was somewhat unseasonable.
He found all the servants up; and there was a look
of anxiety and apprehension in the countenances of all,
which led him to believe that his fears were not un-
founded, and that the business in which Sir Walter had
been engaged during the evening was both painful in
itself, and such as could no longer be concealed from
his household.
In those days, when difficulties and embarrassments
overtook a country gentleman, the case was much more
painful than it is at present. Habits of luxury and dis-
sipation, ostentatious rivalry with one another, and many
of the other vices which, in the present times, have ren-
dered the transfer of property from the old gentry of the
land but too common, and burdens upon that which does
remain very general, had then scarcely reached the coun-
try; and though the dissipated inhabitants of towns, the
gay debauched peer, the fopling of the court, and the
speculating merchant, might know, from time to time,
every reverse of fortune, it seldom occurred in those
days that the old proprietor of lands in the country ex-
perienced any great and detrimental change, unless
tempted to leave the calm enjoyments of rural life for
the more dangerous pleasures of the town.
Civil wars, indeed, and political strife had brought
about or laid the foundation for the ruin of a great num-
ber of the country gentry; and such, in some degree,
had been the case with Sir Walter Herbert. His father
had served King Charles both with sword and purse,
and had never received either payment or recompense.
The matter had gone on slowly since, drop by drop, till
the cup was nearly full.
Sir Walter had shut his eyes to the fact, and had care-
fully concealed a situation, the whole extent of which
he did not himself know, and which he always hoped

to remedy, from the eyes of those around him. It
could not be, however, but that reports of embarrass-
ment should get abroad; and it was well known in the
country that, some five or six years before, he had be-
come security to the amount of ten thousand pounds
for a neighbouring gentleman, who failed to pay the
debt, fled, and left the country. But every one knew,
also, that the bond was in the hands of Lord Danemore,
Sir Walter's acquaintance and neighbour; and every
one, when the subject was mentioned, smiled, and de-
clared that Lord Harold, the son of the peer, and Mis-
tress Alice Herbert, would find means of cancelling the
debt.
We have already had occasion to show that such ex-
pectations were vain; and the reports of embarrassment
which had reached Langford's ears, from sources which
he could not doubt, had rendered his suit to Alice Her-
bert as disinterested as it could be, but had prepared his
mind for what he was about to hear.
“I am afraid something is the matter, Halliday,” he
said, addressing the servant who gave him admittance.
“What has happened, do you know !”
“I am afraid something has gone wrong too, captain,”
replied the servant, with a sorrowful expression of
countenance; “but Mistress Alice, I dare say, will tell
you all about it. She is sitting up in the library to see
you, and begged you would come to her whenever you
came in.”
Langford waited for no one to usher him to her pres-
ence; but, by two or three rapid steps, passed the ser-
vant, and opened the library door.
Alice was sitting at a table with a book before her
It were vain to say that she was reading; for though
her eyes had more than once fixed upon the pages, and
had scanned several sentences so as to make out the
words, of the meaning of those words her mind was
very little conscious. Her eyes were now tearless, but
It was clear to Langford that she had been weeping not
long before. The noise of his foot made her instantly
rise, and the colour became a good deal deeper in her
cheek; betraying a part, but a very small part, of the va-
ried emotions that were going on within.
The heart of her lover was throbbing at that moment
with many an anxiety, it is true; but, strange as it may
seem, love and noble pride, ay, and evenjoy, engrossed

by far the greater part. He guessed, no, he divined all
that she felt, however; the pain, the care, the appre-
hensiveness that burdened her breast, as she rose after
waiting there alone to receive him in order to tell him
the tale of her father's embarrassments; a tale which
he well knew she had never herself heard before that
night. -
Langford would not have paused a moment under
such circumstances for worlds; and, with a step as
quick as lightning, he was by her side. He took her
hand in his. He made her sit down again, and drew a
chair near her, gazing upon her with a look so full of
tenderness and affection, that—though sweet, most
sweet to all her feelings—it made the tears again rise
into her eyes. It matters not whether what we drop
into a full cup be earth or a jewel; the cup overflows
with either. Langford was anxious to speak first him-
self, and was not sorry that any emotion, not painful in
itself, should prevent her from commencing the conver-
sation.
“Alice,” he said, “dear Alice, something painful has
happened, I know, and I guess the nature of it; but do
not let it affect you too deeply. If you did but know
how common these events are in the gay world of the
metropolis, it would become lighter in your eyes than
it is now, breaking upon you suddenly, and ignorant of
all such transactions.”
“Then you have heard?” said Alice, gazing mourn-
fully in his face. -
“No, I have not,” replied Langford; “but I have di-
vined what is the matter; I divined long ago.”
“Then you were indeed generous,” she said, “to
wish to link your fate with mine; for it seems to be an
evil one.”
“Not so, dearest,” replied Langford; “not so ! I
would say, that all I ask is to share it, if I had not the
vain hope, my beloved, of doing more, and rendering it
a happy one.”
“Oh! but, Langford, I fear you do not know all,” re-
plied Alice; “and though I waited here on purpose to
tell you, I do not know whether I shall be able to do so
distinctly; for I am unacquainted with even the terms
of these things. But I will tell you what happened
when I came home. I found my poor father sitting
here in a terrible state of agitation, and Lord Dane

re's lawyer with him, looking cold and stiff, and
taking snuff, and a very different man indeed from what
I have seen him in former days, bowing down to the
ground, and scarcely venturing to sit down in the same
room with my father. He it was that told me, for my
father could not, that there was what he called a bond
and judgment for ten thousand pounds and interest,
which my father owed Lord Danemore; and that my
father had offered to give him a mortgage on his estate
for it; but that Lord Danemore would not take one,
both because he wanted the money, and because he
said that the estate was mortgaged already up to its
value.” -
“That must be a mistake, I think,” said Langford.
“You will forgive me, Alice, for having made some in-
quiries lately; and will not, I know, attribute my having
done so to any motive but the true one. I have, how-
ever, made such inquiries; and I feel sure that this law-
yer of Lord Danemore's has greatly exaggerated, and
has done so for the purpose of embarrassing your
father.”
“Oh! I cannot think he could be so cruel,” exclaimed
Alice, “when he saw the dreadful state of agitation in
which my father was. However, he made it out, in
short, that we had nothing on earth left but the pictures
and the plate, and my poor mother's jewels; and he
said that all he wanted to know was, first, whether I
would be willing to give up the little fortune that was left
me by my aunt, to pay one half of the debt; and, next,
when my father would pay the remainder. He said,
too, he had no objection to give my father a week to do
SO.”
“A week!” exclaimed Langford, “a week! The
pitiful scoundrel! Is that the way he treats his mas-
ter's friend! However, Alice, he shall find himself
mistaken! Listen to me, my beloved,” and, clasping
her hand in his, he glided his other arm round her
waist, and gazed fondly and tenderly in her face: “I
have some means of knowing, Alice, what is taking
place in this neighbourhood, which it is needless to ex-
plain; and certain circumstances induced me to believe
that this claim would be made by Lord Danemore on
your father immediately. Alice,” he added, with a
meaning look, “you know that there may be motives
sufficient to induce Lord Danemore to entertain some

slight angry feelings towards you and your father at
this moment.”
Alice blushed very deeply, and looked up with sur-
prise, saying, “What motives do you mean, Lang-
ford 1”
“I mean on account of his son,” replied Langford.
“I did not know,” replied Alice, ingenuously, “that
either you or anybody else but my father knew aught
of that business till to-night °
“Several persons knew it,” replied Langford; “and
though I do not mean to excuse Lord Danemore, yet
we must allow something for anger; and I think that
such was his motive.”
“Oh, that it certainly was,” replied Alice, “for the
attorney did not scruple to acknowledge it; but I did
'not think myself justified in mentioning it even to you,
Langford.”
“I do not mean to excuse Lord Danemore's conduct,”
said Langford. “It was unjust and unkind; but per
haps it was consistent with human nature, and cer-
tainly was consistent with all I know of his nature,
which is quick, vehement, and passionate, if we may
believe one half of what is said. But, after all, very
likely this lawyer has outdone his instructions. How-
ever, Alice, as I said, he shall be disappointed. Learn-
ing that something of the kind was in agitation, I wrote
several days ago to London, in order to be prepared to
meet this matter. By this time my messenger is at the
village, and brings with him a sufficient sum to dis-
charge your father's obligation to Lord Danemore. For
the last two or three days, Alice, I will acknowledge to
you that my mind has been in a great state of doubt
and agitation; the sum for which I have sent is more
than one half of what I actually possess; but it was no
fear in regard to that which made me at all hesitate.
I only doubted whether I should tell you all I feel to-
wards you before I offered this little assistance to you
father or not. I thought, that if hope had deceived me,
and Alice rejected my love, her father would then re-
fuse to receive any aid from me, however needful it
might be to him; and therefore, on the one hand, I
fancied it might be better to mention the subject of the
money first. But then, again, on the other hand, 1
thought, if I did so, it might place my Alice in embar-
rassing circumstances should she find herself obliged to

refuse a man who had come to her father's assistance
in a moment of difficulty I judged it would seem un-
generous of me even to ask her very soon after. In
short, Alice, I gave way to hope and impatience, trust-
ing that my Alice, by accepting me, would give me a
right both to protect her and to assist her father.” "
“In short, Langford,” replied Alice, placing her other
hand upon his, “in short, you thought of everything
that was generous, and kind, and noble, and acted ac-
cordingly.” -
“Nay, nay, not so, Alice,” replied Langford; “but, of
course, you have told your father what has passed be-
tween us.”
“Immediately that man was gone,” replied Alice, “I
felt myself bound to do so, Langford; the more bound
from all the distressing and agitating events which had
Occurred.”
“You did quite right, my beloved,” he answered.
“What did he say?” - -
“He said everything that was kind and affectionate,”
replied Alice. “He said everything that I should like
to hear said of one I love; but he said that he feared
you would be disappointed when you heard all this bad
news, and that I was bound in honour to set you free
from all promises as much as if no proposal had ever
been made. On his own part, he said that he should
never raise any objections in regard to fortune; that he
would never have, done so even in his most prosperous
days; but there was one question which he wished to
ask regarding birth.” Alice blushed, and cast down her
eyes as she spoke. Then, raising them suddenly and
frankly to Langford's face, she added, “It is one of his
prejudices, you know, Henry. But, even if there should
be any difficulty, his love for me and his esteem for you
will make it but the matter of a moment.”
Langford gazed in her face for an instant with a mel-
ancholy smile, which almost made her believe that her
father's suspicions with regard to his history were
correct. The next instant, however, whether he un-
derstood her meaning or not, he answered, “Set your
mind at rest, dear Alice; my birth is as good as your
own Is you father gone to bed!”
“He went up stairs about half an hour before you
came,” said Alice; “but he is not asleep yet, I am
sure. I sat up both to tell you all this and to put my

*
mind at ease about you and Lord Harold. You were
so long absent that I was uneasy. If you had not given
me your solemn promise not to quarrel with him, and
if my father's grief and agitation had not occupied so
much of my thoughts, I am afraid I should have been
very foolish, and both terrified and unhappy at your not
returning.”
“I have been very busy about other things,” replied
Langford, the chilly recollection of all that had passed
in the interval coming back upon him like a sudden
gust of cold wind. “But my conversation with Lord
Harold only lasted ten minutes. I do not mean to say
that he would not willingly have quarrelled with me,
but I would not quarrel with him; and I trust that my
reputation for courage does not require to be sustained
by any such silly contests. However, dear Alice,” he
continued, suddenly turning the conversation back again
to its former subject, “however, if your father be not
asleep, it may put his mind more at ease to hear that
means are provided for meeting Lord Danemore's claim
upon him; and you may also tell him, my Alice, in or-
der to remove every shade of doubt, that, although my
fortune be but scanty as it at present stands, yet there
is good hope of its being greatly increased, and that my
birth is certainly not inferior to that of her whose hand
is already too valuable a gift to need the enhancement
of superior station.” -
As he spoke he raised the hand he held tenderly but
reverentially to his lips; for he felt that he was bound to
double every outward token of respect at a moment
when Alice announced to him that her own expecta-
tions of high fortune were disappointed, and that the
rich heiress, who had thought a few hours before she had
great wealth and broad lands to give, was now dower-
less except in her beauty, her virtues, and her gentle-
neSS.
So he felt and so he acted; and Alice saw his feelings,
and appreciated them to the full.
She rose then to go, but hesitated a moment as she
wished him good-night, not knowing well how to ex-
press all the sensations that his conduct had produced.
“Langford,” she said, at length, “how shall I thank
you? I will not attempt to do it now, the time is too
short; but I shall find time, if endeavouring through
life to make you happy b'ough."

Langford could not resist it, and for a moment he
pressed her to his bosom; adding, “Good-night, my
Alice, good-night, my beloved. Hasten to your father
before he is asleep, and I will remain for a few minutes
here to write a note to the landlord of the Talbot, bid-
ding him send up to-morrow morning early the packet
which must have arrived to-night. I will tell him to
address it to you; so that, before your father is awake
to-morrow, you will have in your own hands the means
of freeing him from all apprehension regarding this
claim. I trust, too, dear Alice, the time will come when
he will so much regard me in the light of a son as to
permit me to examine into the matter of these mort-
gages; and I think I can show him, and others too, that
his estates are far from being as much involved as they
have been represented to be.”
They parted; and after Langford had written the
note he had spoken of, and had given it to a servant
to take to the little town early in the morning, he
retired to rest. He found in his chamber, busily en-
gaged in laying out his toilet for the night, the old
servant Halliday, who, during the whole time he had
been confined in consequence of his wound, had attend-
ed him with the utmost care and attention, springing
from a feeling that he was in some degree paying off a
debt of his young mistress, in whose service that wound
had been received. There was now in his countenance,
though his nature was too respectful to suffer him to
put any questions, an anxious sort of inquiringness
which Langford could not resist. “It is not so bad,
Halliday,” he said. “Your excellent master has alarmed
himself too much. All will go quite well, depend upon
it.”
The man made him a low bow with an air full of
gratitude. “I am very much obliged to you, captain,”
he said. “I was frightened, I confess; for the steward,
you see, told me at least three months ago. But, how-
ever, we servants have no right to be talking about such
matters; and though it is all out of love and regard to
Sir Walter and Mistress Alice, perhaps we had better
hold our tongues.”
“Perhaps so, Halliday,” replied Langford; “and now,
good-night; all will go well, depend upon it.”
The man again bowed low and respectfully, and left
the room, and Langford proceeded calmly to undress

himself; for—though his mind was oppressed, and the
moment his thoughts were turned from the immediate
subject of Sir Walter Herbert's affairs, they reverted
naturally to the more painful topics with which they
had before been engaged—he was not a man to suffer
his feelings to overpower him, or to interrupt him in
his ordinary habits and occupations. He felt deeply
and strongly; but he was too much accustomed to feel
deeply and strongly to suffer the emotions of his mind
greatly to affect his corporeal demeanour. It is those
who feel by fits and starts alone that give full way to
sudden emotions. Langford could feel as poignantly as
any one. He did feel as deeply and as poignantly as
any one could feel at that moment, and yet he pro-
ceeded with his ordinary preparations for repose as if
nothing had occurred to affect his feelings or to shake.
his heart. He ended by kneeling and commending him-
self and those he loved to the care of the Great Pro-
tector; and then lay down to rest, but not to sleep.
That he could not command; and for many an hour he
remained with his right arm bent under his head, his
eyes cast upward through the darkness, peopling va-
cancy with strange shapes, and suffering imagination to
suggest to him many a melancholy and many a painful
image, which, after all, were not so dark and gloomy
as the reality soon proved to be. The sky was begin-
ning to turn gray with the morning light when he first
closed his eyes. He started up again, however, in an-
other moment, and then lay awake till it was broad day-
light. Perceiving that such was the case, he was about
to rise, but then a degree of drowsiness came over him;
and, yielding to it for a moment, it took possession of
him quite, and he fell into a deep sleep.
CHAPTER X.
DAY had long dawned, as we have said, ere Langford
woke; and even then he awoke not of himself, nor till
the servant Halliday had twice called him by name,
standing close by his bedside, and looking upon him with
an expression of much interest indeed, but with a face
from which all colour was banished, apparently by feur
and agitation.

“Master Langford!” he said, “MasterLangford N
guilty man ever slept so sound as that. Poo, nor
sense! Captain Langford, I say!”
Langford woke and looked up, demanding what wa
the matter.
“Why, sir,” replied the servant, “here is good ol.
Gregory Myrtle, the landlord of the Talbot, wants to
speak with you immediately. I met him, as I was go
ing up to the village, coming down here as fast as he
could roll.”
“Then you have not got the packet I sent for ?” said
Langford, coolly.
“He has got it, sir, safe,” replied Halliday; “but he
would not give it up, for he was coming on to you him-
self.”
“He should have given it as he was directed,” said
Langford. “Tell him to wait; I will see him when I
am dressed.”
“But he says, sir, that he must see you directly; that
his business is of the greatest importance; that there is
not a moment to lose.”
“Oh, then, send him up,” said Langford, “if the mat-
ter be so pressing as that.”
Halliday instantly disappeared, as if he thought that
too much time had been wasted already; and, while
Langford proceeded to rise, good Gregory Myrtle was
heard creaking and panting up the stairs as fast as his
vast rotundity would let him. His face, too, was pale,
if pale it ever could be called; and he was evidently in
a great state of agitation, though the jolly habitual laugh
still remained, and was heard before he was well with-
in the door of Langford's room.
“Haw, haw, haw !” he cried, as he laid down the
expected packet before Langford. “Lord a mercy,
Master Harry, this is a terrible business!” he continued.
“Well, I never did think—however, it's all nonsense, I
know,” and he again burst into a loud laugh, ending
abruptly in the midst, and staring in Langford's face as
if for a reply.
“Well, good Gregory,” replied Langford, who in the
mean time had broken open the seals of the packet,
and seen that various bills of exchange which it con-
tained, together with other equivalents for money, were
all right; “well, good Master Myrtle, what is it that is
very terrible t What is it you did never think? What

is it that is all nonsense? I am in the dark, Master
Myrtle.” -
“Gad's my life, sir, they won't let you be in the dark
long,” cried the landlord of the Talbot; “and I came
down to enlighten you first, that you might not be taken
by surprise.” -
“As to what?” said Langford, somewhat impatiently.
“Lord, sir! I thought that Halliday must have told
you something, at least,” replied Gregory Myrtle, “or
that his face must, if not his tongue, for it's all black
and white, like the broadside of the “Hue and Cry;’
but the matter is this,” he added, after pausing to laugh
a moment at his own joke, “it seems that poor Lord
Harold, who was a good youth in his way, though he
was somewhat sharp upon poachers, and deerstealers,
and the like, was murdered last night upon the moor.”
“Good God!” exclaimed Langford, clasping his hands
* Good God!”
“It's but too true, sir,” continued Myrtle, throwing
as much solemnity as he could into his jocund counte-
nance. “It’s but too true; and there's poor Lord Dane-
more, his father, distracted; and, for the matter of that,
I think Sir Thomas Waller and Sir Matthew Scrope are
as much distracted too; for, after having been with my
lord since five o’clock this morning, they come down
to my house, and begin examining witnesses and taking
evidence, and sending here and there; and the end of
it all is—for I heard them consulting over it through a
chink in the door—they judge that you are the person
who murdered him, only because that mad fellow, silly
John Graves, came running down to the village last
night for help, swearing he had seen you and Lord
Harold with your swords drawn upon each other. So,
while they were busy swearing in constables and all
that, I thought it but friendly-like to come down here
and tell you, in case you might think it right to get
upon your horse's back, and gallop away till the busi-
ness is over.”
“Swearing in constables!” said Langford, without
seeming to take notice of the worthy host's suggestion.
“Why, they don’t suppose my name is ‘Legion, do
they? One constable, I should suppose, would be quite
as useful as twenty.”
“Ay, Master Harry,” replied Gregory Myrtle; “but
they vow that you are connected with the gentlemen

of the road who have been sporting round about here
lately, and they are afraid of a rescue.”
“Indeed,” said Langford, “the sapient men How-
ever, Master Myrtle, ring that little bell at the top of the
stairs.” -
The silver handbell to which he pointed was imme.
diately rung, and Halliday, who had remained half way
down the stairs, was in the room in a moment. No
sooner did he appear than Gregory Myrtle, who put his
own construction upon Langford's coolness, exclaimed,
“Quick, Master Halliday, quick! saddle the captain's
horse for him ''”
“No, no, Halliday,” said Langford. “You are making
a mistake, my good Master Myrtle. Take this packet,
Halliday, and give it into Mistress Alice's own hands as
soon as ever you can. I am going out with Master
Myrtle here upon this business, which I see you have
heard of. What may be the result of these foolish
people's foolish suspicions, I cannot tell; but do what
you can, Halliday, to keep the matter from the ears of
Sir Walter and Mistress Alice as long as you can.
Warn the other servants too; for there is no use of add-
ing fresh vexation to that which your master and mis-
tress are already suffering. You must all know very
well that I have nothing to do with this business, and
can make that clear very soon. Say, therefore, that I
have gone out for a few hours, but left that packet for
Mistress Alice, with my best wishes. Now, good Greg-
ory Myrtle, go back to your inn, and tell Sir Thomas
Waller and Sir Matthew Scrope that I will be with them
in five minutes, as soon as I have dressed myself,”
Our host of the Talbot pursued the directions he had
received, rolled down the stairs, and laboured along the
road towards the village, with his surprise and admira-
tion both excited by the extraordinary coolness and
self-possession displayed by Langford under such cir-
cumstances. By the time he had reached the middle
of the bridge, he perceived a great number of people
issuing from the door of his own house; and, ere he
was half way up. the street of the little town, he en-
countered ten or twelve constables and special con-
stables, headed by the two magistrates in person. No
sooner did he approach than the stentorian voice of Sir
Thomas Waller---all unlike the dulcet notes of Sacha-

rissa's lover—was heard to exclaim, “Take him into
custody, Jonathan Brown!”
“Where hast thou been, Gregory Myrtle, Gregory
Myrtle?” exclaimed, in softer tones, almost in the same
moment, the voice of Sir Matthew Scrope.
“You have been aiding and abetting felony' cried
Sir Thomas.
“You have been warning the guilty to escape !” said
Sir Matthew.
“You have been helping the lion to fly from his pur-
suers ''” said Sir Thomas.
“You have been proditoriously giving information of
Our secret councils!” said Sir Matthew.
“It is being an accessory after the fact !” said his
companion.
“It is misprision of treason!” said the other.
“It is levying war against the king!” shouted Sir
Thomas.
“It is a jail delivery !” cried the head constable, de-
termined not to be outdone by his betters.
“Haw, haw, haw!” exclaimed Gregory Myrtle, laying
his two hands upon his fat stomach, “what is the mat-
ter with your worships?”
“Hast thou not gone down on purpose,” said Sir
Matthew Scrope, “to warn Harry Langford, alias Cap-
tain Langford, alias Master Harry, to evade and escape
the pursuit of justice, by flying out of the back door
while we are approaching the front? Hast thou not
done this, Gregory Myrtle 1 and wo be unto thee if he
have so escaped! Take him into custody, I say !”
“Well, your worships,” said Myrtle, beginning to look
a little rueful under the hands of the constables, “I have
been down to Master Harry, I own it; but I went on other
business that I had to do with him. Does not every-
body know that I had a packet down for him by a special
messenger yesterday-night, with orders to deliver it into
his own hands? and if I did talk with him this morning
of what was going on, did he not send his compliments
to your worships, and bid me say that he would be up
with you in five minutes, as soon as he had got his
clothes on ''” * .
“Poo! nonsense, man" exclaimed Sir Thomas Wal-
ler, growing red in the face. “Do you think we are
fools, to be taken in with such a story as that? Are you
fool enough yourself to think that he will come!”

120 ThE ROBBER.
“I say, as sure as I am a living man, he will come t”
said Gregory Myrtle. “Ay, more, my masters,” he con-
tinued, after giving a glänce towards the Manor House,
“I say, there he is coming.”
All eyes were instantly turned in the direction in
which his own had been bent the moment before, and
the figure of a man, which seemed to have just issued
out of the gates of the park, was seen walking with a
slow calm step along the road towards the village. The
magistrates, the constables, and the multitudinous crowd
which followed them, all stood in silence and what we
may call thunderstruckness, so little credence had they
given to the assurances of Gregory Myrtle; for, let it
be remembered, that the first effect produced by an ac-
cusation against any one, upon vulgar minds, is to lead
them at once to condemn him. I am afraid there is
something in the human heart that loves the act of con-
demnation; an act which either gratifies malignity or
vanity.
However that may be, the party assembled in the
streets of the little town could not believe their eyes,
and, indeed, would not believe their eyes long after the
form of Henry Langford, a form with which many of
them were perfectly acquainted, had become distinctly
visible, approaching with slow calm steps towards the
spot where they were gathered together. The matter,
however, could no longer be doubted; and the magis-
trates stood still, not knowing very well how to act in
sueh unusual circumstances.
Henry Langford, in the mean time, approached with-
out the slightest appearance of hesitation or dismay at
the sight of the formidable phalanx which they pre-
sented. Walking up to the magistrates with the calm
and graceful dignity which characterized all his actions,
he bowed slightly, saying, “I am told, gentlemen, that
a most distressing occurrence has taken place, and that
you imagine there is some cause for supposing that I
am implicated in this matter. Now, with your leave,
gentlemen, we will go to the inn, as this is no place for
discussing such subjects, and we will there investigate
the matter accurately. Doubtless, you have had good
reason for attributing to me the commission of a crime;
but some person or another must have gone out of the
way to insinuate or to urge such a charge against me
and who it is that has been kind enough and liberal

THE ROBBER. 121
enough to do so, I shall make it my business to discover,
in order to punish him as he deserves.”
Langford concluded somewhat sternly; and the ma-
gistrates, entirely taken by surprise, looked rather fool-
ish, and began to imagine that they might have been
too hasty in their conclusions. There was a tone and
an air, too, in the person whom they had suspected,
which forbade all high words or violent measures. He
spoke to them as certainly their equal, if not their su-
perior; and there was so much of the consciousness of
innocence in his whole demeanour, that it was very
difficult to conceive that their suspicions were justified.
Not knowing well what to reply, they followed his
suggestion in silence, the one walking on one side of
him, and the other on the other. By the time they
reached the Talbot, however, they began to recover
from the effect of his presence; and Sir Thomas Waller,
with what he conceived to be wise foresight and pres-
ence of mind, gave the chief constable a hint in a
whisper to guard the doors well, and to take care that
the prisoner did not escape. They did not, however,
venture to treat him as a prisoner in any other respect;
and, walking up into the room where they had held their
investigation, he sat down with them at the table, and
begged in a grave but not sarcastic tone that they would
have the goodness to let him know on what grounds
they for a moment conceived that he had had any share
in the unfortunate death of Lord Harold.
The magistrates looked to their clerk, who had re-
mained behind, putting the evidence in order while they
had proceeded with the constables for the purpose of
arresting Langford. The clerk, who, upon the whole,
seemed a sensible little man, proceeded, as it was very
common in those days, to take the whole business into
his hands, and recapitulated coolly, but civilly, to Lang-
ford the heads of all the evidence that had been taken.
Langford now discovered that the charge against him
was much more serious than he had at first imagined,
He found that, in the first place, several persons had de-
posed that silly John Graves, whose adherence to truth
was well known, had come down to the town in great
agitation, begging for help to stop Lord Harold and Mas-
ter Harry Langford from killing each other. It was
proved, also, by the horseboys from the Manor House,
that Lord Harold, after having been in the park with
WoL. I.-L


## p. 122 (#124) ############################################

122 THE ROBBER.
Master Langford, had returned for his horse about the
same time that the other had returned; that the young
nobleman had ridden away very slowly, and that Lang-
ford, after proceeding part of the way towards the vil-
lage, had suddenly come back, mounted his horse, and
ridden away very rapidly; that he had been absent till
between ten and eleven o’clock at night, and that his
horse was evidently fatigued, and had been hard ridden.
Several people, too, had seen him pass at different times
and on several parts of the road leading to the moor;
and, in short, there was quite sufficient evidence to
prove that a quarrel had taken place between Lord Har-
old and himself; that they had both gone towards the
same spot at the same time, and that he had been ab-
sent a sufficient number of hours to commit the deed
with which he was charged, and to return.
As the evidence was recapitulated, the worthy ma-
gistrates gained greater and greater confidence every
moment; and at length Sir Matthew Scrope exclaimed.
“If this is not sufficient to justify us in committing the
prisoner, I do not know what is.”
“Not, perhaps, in committing him, your worship,”
said the clerk, whose philology was choice without be
ing very accurate; “but certainly in remanding him.”
“Why, I did not exactly mean to say committing,”
rejoined the subservient magistrate; “remanding was
the word I meant to use ; but where can we remand him
to ? If we remand him to the county jail, Justice Hold-
him will take the matter out of our hands, and we shall
lose all credit with the good earl for arresting the mur-
derer of his son.”
“Would it not be as well,” said the clerk, “to take
him up at once to the castle? It is not improbable that
the noble earl might like to examine him himself; and
you can keep him confined there till you have obtained
further evidence to justify his committal.”
“A very good thought, a very good thought,” cried
Sir Thomas Waller, rubbing his hands. “He shall be
placed in my carriage, with a constable on each side,
and we will follow in yours, Sir Matthew, with the other
constables on horseback.”
Langford had listened in silence to the conversation
between the magistrates and their clerk; and, though
he evidently began to perceive that the affair would be
more serious and disagreeable than he had anticipated,

he could not refrain from smiling at the arrangement of
the stately procession that was to carry him to Dane-
more Castle. He resolved, however, to make one effort
to prevent the execution of a purpose which would, of
course, on many accounts, be disagreeable to him; and
he therefore interposed, as the clerk was about to leave
the room, saying, “You are rather too hasty, gentlemen,
in your conclusions, and I think you had better be
warned before you commit an act which you may be
made to repent of—”
“Do you mean to threaten us, sir!” exclaimed Sir
Thomas Waller. “Take those words down, clerk.
Take those words down.”
“I mean to threaten you with nothing,” replied Lang-
ford, “but the legal punishment to which bad or igno-
rant magistrates may be subjected for the use, or rather
misuse, of their authority. You will remark—and I beg
that the clerk may take these words down—that one
half of the matter urged against me rests upon the re-
ported words of a madman, who has not been brought
forward even himself.”
“You would not have us take the deposition of an in-
nocent, a born natural ” demanded Sir Matthew Scrope.
“His evidence is either worth something or worth
nothing,” replied Langford. “You rest mainly upon his
testimony reported by others, which is, of course, worth
nothing; and yet you will not take his testimony from
his own mouth, when I inform you that, if it were so
taken, he would prove that, though Lord Harold chose
to quarrel with me, which I do not deny, that I posi-
tively refused to draw my sword upon him, even when
he drew his upon me.” -
“That might be,” said the clerk, “to take more sure
vengeance in a private way. Their worships have, on
the contrary, to remark, that you have not in any way
attempted to account for the space of time you were
absent from the Manor House last night. Neither have
you stated where you were, or what was your occu-
pation; and, without meaning to say anything uncivil,
sir, let me say that there have been a great many mights
while you remained at the inn which might require ac-
counting for also. Their worships have not judged
harshly of you, nor even given attention to suspicious
circumstances, till they found that the whole of your
conduct was suspicious.” This was spoken while stand-

ing beside the chair of Sir Matthew Scrope; and, after
whispering a few words in his ear, the clerk left the
room.
Langford remained, with his eyes gloomily bent upon
the table, without speaking to either of his companions,
busy with varied thoughts and feelings, which began to
come upon him thick and many, to weigh him down,
and to oppress him. During the early part of the disa-
greeable business in which he had been engaged, he had
thought solely of his own innocence, and of the absurd-
ity, as it seemed to him, of the charge against him; but.
as the matter went on, other considerations forced them-
selves upon his attention. He was conscious he could
give no account of where he had been on the preceding
night when the murder was committed; and yet he ient
that he was called upon strongly to do so, not for the
purpose of freeing himself from suspicion, but with a
view to bring the real murderer to justice. Yet how
could he reveal any part of what he knew without bring-
ing down destruction on the head of Franklin Gray, who
had no share in the deed; who, at the very time it was
committed, was engaged in serving him even at the risk
of life; to whom he was bound by so many ties of grat-
itude, and whose good qualities, though they did cer-
tainly not serve to counterbalance his crimes, yet ren-
dered him a very different object in the eyes of Langford
from such men as Wiley and Hardcastle! At all events,
he felt that it was not for him to bring a man to the
scaffold who had saved his life on more than one occa-
sion, and who had shown himself always willing to peril
his own in order to procure a comparatively trifling ben-
efit to him.
Mingled with all these feelings was deep and bitter
sorrow for Lord Harold; and thus many conflicting
emotions, all more or less painful, together with the
most painful of all, the knowledge that he could not do
his duty with that straightforward candour and decision
which, in all other situations of life, he had been accus-
tomed to show, kept him in stern and somewhat gloomy
silence. 4
The magistrates, in the mean while, conversed apart
in a low voice, Sir Thomas Waller delighted with the
plan they were about to pursue, and anticipating great
credit with Lord Damemore for the arrest of his son's
murderer; while Sir Matthew Scrope, who seemed to

stand in considerable awe of the old nobleman, declared
that he never half liked to come across the earl, who
was so fierce, and fiery, and imperious. In about a quar-
ter of an hour the clerk returned, and announced that
all was ready; and Langford, surrounded by a complete
mob of constables, suffered himself to be placed in the
rumbling carriage of Sir Thomas Waller, and was borne
away towards Danemore Castle.
The two magistrates followed in the carriage of Sir
Matthew ; and the train of constables, mounted on all
sorts of beasts, came after, swelling the procession;
while good Gregory Myrtle stood at his door, declaring
that he never saw such a piece of folly in his life; and
the poor chambermaid, dissolved in tears, wiped her
eyes and vowed it was impossible that so handsome a
young man could murder anybody.
CHAPTER XI.
AFTER a slow progress of between two and three
hours—along roads which in those days frequently
tossed the heavy carriage wheels high in the air over
some large unbroken stone, and still more frequently
suffered them to repose in deep beds of sand or mud,
till the efforts of four strong Flanders horses had drag-
ged them forth – the vehicle which contained Henry
Langford gained the brow of Danemore hill, and came
within sight of the building which, in that part of the
country, was known under the name of The Castle.
This view was obtained from the side of the park,
which lay in front, and which was separated from the
road merely by a low park paling, crowned with open
palisading at the top. A part of the park itself lay be-
tween the mansion and the road, which were at the dis-
tance of about three quarters of a mile from each other,
the ground sloping with a thousand fanciful undulations,
and covered with short turf of a rich bright green in all
he dells and hollows, though becoming slightly brown
upon the tops of the knolls, where the fierce summer
sun, like the withering glare of the great world, had al-
ready taken off the fresh: of the vegetation,

Scattered here and there were groups of old haw-
thorns, contorted into many a strange and rugged form,
while on either hand appeared clumps of fine old trees,
the chestnut, the beech, and the oak. The latter were
seen gradually deepening and clustering together to the
right and left of the house, till they joined a thick wood,
through which every here and there stood forth, dark
and defined amid the tender green of the other plants,
the sombre masses of the pine and fir; like some of
those stern memories of sorrow, of sin, or of privation,
which are to be found in almost every human heart, and
which still make themselves known in gloomy distinct-
: amid the freshest scenes and brightest occupations
of life.
In the midst, backed by that thick wood, stood the
house or castle, as it was called, and the name was not
ill deserved. It was an irregular pile of building, erect-
ed in different ages by its different lords, and showing
the taste of the various individuals who had possessed
it, as well as of the various ages in which it had been
constructed. On the left was an old unornamented
tower, in the simplest style of the old Norman archi-
tecture. It was like one of the plain towers of some
of the Kentish churches, with square cut windows, or
rather loopholes, under a semicircular arch, which de-
noted the original form. It was crowned by a plain
parapet with a high conical roof.
Then came a long range of buildings in a much later
style of architecture, with oriel windows, and a good
deal of rich stone carving and ornamental work; then
two massive towers projecting considerably before the
rest of the façade, and joined to it by two corridors,
through each of which was pierced a gateway, under a
pointed arch ; and then again, as the building sunk into
the wood, upon the right were more towers and masses
of heavy masonry, united in general by long lines of
building of a lighter and more graceful character. On
the older parts the ivy had been suffered to grow, though
not very luxuriantly. The space in front, too, was kept
clear of trees; and even as the carriage passed along,
at the distance of nearly a mile, the wide esplanade on
which the castle stood, with a part of the barbican,
which had been suffered to remain, were distinctly vis-
ible.
The constables who sat with Langford in the carriage

w
of Sir Thomas Waller gazed up towards an edifice
which the people of the country but seldom approached,
with feelings of awe and reverence. The eyes of Lang-
ford, too, were fixed upon it, but with sensations which
they little understood. All that they remarked was,
that he kept his eyes fixed upon the castle steadfastly
during the whole time that it was visible as they passed
along in front; that he looked at it calmly, though grave-
ly; and that, when he had done, he raised his head as
if waking from a revery, and then suddenly turned and
azed from the other window, where a wide and beauti-
ul view was seen spread out below, reaching to the old
Manor House, and the wooded banks and hills beyond.
The carriage then rolled on, and, winding round un-
der the park, entered by a castellated lodge, and drove
slowly up to the mansion, the vehicles passing under
the arches of the two large towers which projected
from the centre of the building. . A loud-tongued bell
gave notice of their coming, and three or four servants,
fat, pampered, and saucy, made their appearance to an-
swer its noisy summons.
Sir Thomas Waller was the first to speak, and, with
an air of importance, he demanded immediately to see
the earl. One servant looked at another, and he who
seemed to be the chief porter replied shortly that that
was impossible, for the earl had gone out.
“Gone out!” cried Sir Thomas, in surprise. “How t
where !”
“He is gone out on horseback,” replied the man;
“that is how, sir; and as to where, I fancy he is gone
to the moor where my young lord was killed.”
“But we must, at least we ought, to see my lord the
earl,” said Sir Matthew Scrope, “for we have brought
up a prisoner for him to examine.” -
“I can’t say anything about that,” replied the man,
with a sort of sullen incivility; “my lord is out, but I
will go and ask Mistress Bertha if you like.”
“I do not know what Mistress Bertha can do in the
matter,” said Sir Thomas Waller. -
“Oh! she can do anything she likes,” replied the
man, with a sneer, to which he did not dare to give full
expression.
“Well, ask her; ask her, then,” said Sir Matthew;
“you know who I am; you know I was with the earl

128 ThE ROBBER.
three or four hours this morning. You know I am a
justice of the peace, and one of the quorum.”
Sir Matthew did not seem by this announcement to
raise his dignity greatly in the eyes of the servant, who
walked away with slow and measured steps to make
the proposed application. He returned in about five
minutes, saying that Mistress Bertha had replied that,
as it might be a long time before the earl returned, the
magistrates had better leave the prisoner locked up
there, and come back in the evening about the hour of
his lordship's supper.
Sir Matthew Scrope and Sir Thomas Waller looked
at each other. There were some points in this sugges-
tion which they did not much like; but then, again, the
magical words, “His lordship's supper,” which were
coupled in their imagination with fine and exquisite
wines from foreign lands, fat haunches, rich sauces, and
many another delicacy and luxury which rumour de-
clared to be prevalent in Danemore Castle, rapidly re-
moved all objections from their minds; and, after a few
minutes' consultation between them, they determined
to obey to the letter.
The next object of consideration was how to secure
their prisoner, and in what room to place him; but their
conference on that point was soon cut short by the por-
ter, who interrupted them by saying, “You had better
leave all that to Mistress Bertha; for, depend upon it,
she will put him where she likes herself, and most likely
has settled it all already. The best way will be to bring
him in and go to her. She is in the long gallery.”
Although the two magistrates did not at all approve
of the whole business being taken out of their hands by
a woman, they nevertheless yielded with some symp-
toms of displeasure; and Langford, being made to de-
scend from the carriage, was escorted by the two con-
stables through a long dim entrance passage, which led
into a handsome vestibule beyond. He offered no re-
sistance to their will; he made no observation; he asked
no question; but with a calm and thoughtful dignity,
which had its effect even upon the pampered servants
of the castle, he walked on looking casually at the dif-
ferent objects he passed, as if almost indifferent to the
part he was himself acting in the scene.
From the vestibule a handsome flight of stone stairs,
lighted by a tall painted window, led up to a gallery ex-

tending on either side for about seventy yards; and up
these stairs Langford was led, following the two magis-
trates, who went on with slow steps, preparing to give
Mistress Bertha, the housekeeper, a just notion of their
dignity and importance. At the top of the stairs they
were met by that personage herself, dressed as we have
before described her, except that her broad white coif
was no longer surmounted by the black veil with which
she covered her head when she went abroad. Her thin
aquiline features might have gained an additional degree
of sharpness; her sallow skin was, if anything, more
sallow ; and the cold severe expression which always
reigned in her countenance was now increased to a de-
gree of stern bitterness, which somewhat humbled the
tone of the two magistrates.
They approached her, however, with a very tolerable
degree of pomposity; and Sir Thomas Waller intro-
duced himself, and then presented Sir Matthew Scrope,
announcing to her that they were magistrates of the
county, and two of the quorum. As he spoke the at-
tention of the housekeeper wandered beyond the two
worshipful gentlemen altogether, and was attracted to
the prisoner who followed them. There was something
in his good looks, his calm and dignified demeanour, his
apparel, or his expression of countenance, which made
the thin eyelids of Mistress Bertha's eyes expand from
the bright dark orbs they covered at the first moment
they lighted on him, and she demanded, “Is that the
prisoner?”
Sir Thomas Waller replied that it was; and then re-
capitulated what he had been saying in regard to the
dignity of himself and Sir Matthew Scrope.
“Yes, yes,” replied Mistress Bertha, with her slight
foreign accent, “I know who you are, both of you; and
now you have nothing to do but to leave the prisoner
here till the earl comes home. You can return at his
supper hour. I do not know that he will eat with you
himself; but, if he do not, meat shall be provided for
Wou.”
“There can be no reason, madam,” said Sir Matthew
Scrope, “why the earl should not sup with us; we
have supped with men of as high rank, I trow.”
“When a man has lost his only son,” said the house-
keeper, sharply, “is that no reason why he should not
sup with two fat country knights, to whom his sorrow

and his presence would only bring gloom and stiffness?
Better sup by yourselves, and eat, and drink, and make
merry as you are accustomed to do.”
“Gadzooks ''” said Sir Thomas Waller, in a low voice
to his companion, “I think the old lady is right; but,
madam,” he added, in a louder tone, “we must be made
sure of the safety of our prisoner.”
“Leave that to me, leave that to me,” replied the
housekeeper, shortly. “Follow me, Williams and Han-
bury, to guard the prisoner; and you, John Porter,
come on too; come with me, young gentleman,” she
added, speaking to Langford in a more benign tone.
“You do not look as if you would commit a murder;
but, God knows, looks are deceitful things. Come with
me.”
“But, madam, we have no authority,” interrupted Sir
Matthew Scrope.
“Authority l’ exclaimed the housekeeper, fiercely
raising up her tall thin person to its utmost height; “who
talks of authority in this house? You may well say you
have no authority, for you lost it all the moment you
crossed that threshold. No one has authority here but
the earl, and, when he is absent, myself, now that that
poor boy is gone,” she added, while a bright drop rose
into her eyes, sparkled upon the black lashes that fringed
them, and then fell upon the sallow skin beneath. “I
trust in God you did not kill him, young gentleman; for,
if you did, you committed a great crime.”
“Indeed I did not, madam,” replied Langford; “I
should sooner have thought of killing myself.”
“I believe you, I believe you,” replied the housekeep-
er; “but yet I must have you as safely guarded as if you
had. If you want to see where I put him,” she con-
tinued, speaking to the magistrates in a somewhat gen-
tler tone than she had hitherto used, “you may come
with me; there is a room which no one ever enters but
my lord and myself; it is high up in the oldest tower;
even if he could get through the windows, which he
cannot, there is a fall of sixty feet below, clear down.
But come and see it if you will, and you shall have some
refreshment after.”
Carrying a large key which she had held in her hand
from the beginning of the conversation, she led the way
to the end of the gallery in which they stood. Then,
passing through another handsome corridor, she as-

cended a staircase in the older part of the building,
which brought them to an anteroom opening into a large
bedchamber with windows on each side; and through
the western window, and close to it, might be seen pro-
jecting the heavy mass of the large square tower tha
we have mentioned in describing the building. A small
low door was exactly opposite to them as they entered,
and to the lock of this Mistress Bertha applied the key.
It turned heavily, and with difficulty, as if not often
used; and the door moving back, gave entrance into a
lofty and cheerful chamber, lighted by four small win-
dows.
The strength of the door and the height of the win-
dows showed at once that escape from that chamber
was impossible; and the magistrates, holding in remem-
brance the refreshments which their somewhat ungra-
cious companion had promised them, expressed them-
selves perfectly satisfied with the security of their pris-
oner. Langford was accordingly desired to enter the
place of his confinement, and did so at once, merely
turning to address the housekeeper as he passed. “Ma-
dam,” he said, “I am sure you will be good enough to.
give my compliments to Lord Danemore whenever he
returns, and to inform him, first, that I assert my per-
fect innocence of the charge which these two worthy
persons have somewhat too hastily brought against me;
and, secondly, that I beg he will take the most prompt
and immediate means for investigating the whole affair,
as it will be unpleasant for me to submit to this treat.
ment long; and there are plenty of persons in the
neighbourhood who will see that justice is done me.”
The housekeeper made no other reply than by bow-
ing her head; but when Langford had entered, and she
had shut and locked the door, she turned sharply and
contemptuously upon the magistrates, saying, “He did
not do it! he never did it! you will make yourselves a
laughing-stock in the country.”
Sir Thomas Waller was about to reply, but she si.
lenced him at once by ordering one of the servants who
followed her to have the cold meats laid out in the lit-
tle hall, and find the butler for a stoup of Burgundy. A
proposal made by Sir Matthew Scrope to leave two of
the constables behind in the anteroom she cut short
less pleasantly, telling him that she would have no coal.

stables in her master's house except such as were in.
tended to be thrown out of the window.
By this time both magistrates began to find out that
it was to no purpose to contest matters in Danemore
Castle with this imperious dame; and they accordingly
followed her in silence back to the head of the great
stairs. There she made them over to the care of one
of the menservants, who in turn led them to the less-
er hall, where a collation was set before them which
well repaid them for all their patient endurance.
In the mean while Langford had remained in the sol-
itary chamber which had been assigned to him. As
soon as the door was closed he took nine or ten turns
up and down the room in a state of much agitation;
then gazed out for a moment from each of the windows
by which it was lighted; and then sat down at the ta-
ble, and placed his hands for several minutes before his
eyes. It is not needful to enter into any detailed ac-
count of his feelings; his situation was particularly
painful in every respect; and though he was not one of
those who give way to each transient emotion, some-
thing might well be allowed for discomfort, anxiety,
and indignation. When he had thus paused for a few
minutes, thinking over his fate, he lifted his eyes and
gazed round the chamber which served as his place of
confinement, seeming to take accurate note of all it con-
tained.
The room itself was a cheerful and a pleasant room,
with a vaulted ceiling richly ornamented; while the
thick walls of the tower were lined with oak, very deep
in hue, and finely carved with Gothic tracery. The
form of the chamber was perfectly square, and its ex-
tent might be four-and-twenty feet each way. The fur-
niture, too, was good, though ancient, and of the same
carved oak as the panelling. It consisted in a large ta-
ble and a smaller one, eight or nine large high-backed
chairs, and several curious carved cabinets. But the
objects which most attracted the attention of Langford
were two small panels, distinct from the rest of the
wainscoting, and ornamented in such a way as to show
that they were not at all intended to be concealed, with
a small pointed ogee canopy above each, similar to that
which surmounted the door by which he had entered,
but only smaller in size. In each of these panels was
a keyhole surrounded by an intricate steel guard; and

It was evident that each covered the entrance of one of
those cupboards in the wall in which our remote ances-
tors took so much delight.
Besides the door by which he had entered, there was
a smaller one on the opposite side of the room, leading,
as Langford conceived, to a staircase in one of the large
buttresses; and as he had been a prisoner before, and
had found it useful to know all the outlets of his tempo-
rary abode, his first action, after gazing round the room,
was to approach that second door, and try whether it
was or was not locked. It was firmly closed, however;
and he took his way back towards his seat, pausing by
the way to examine the two small closets we have men-
tioned, and murmuring to himself, as he did so, “This
is very strange!” .
As he spoke he drew forth from his vest the key
which had been given him on the preceding night by
Franklin Gray, and put it in the lock, but did not turn
it, though it fitted exactly. He withdrew it again al-
most instantly, and replaced it in his bosom, then folded
his arms upon his chest, and took one or two turns up
and down the room, pausing at every second step, and
gazing thoughtfully upon the floor. |
By the time he had been half an hour in this state of
confinement he heard a key placed in the lock of the
door by which he had entered. In another moment it
opened, and the tall, stately figure of Mistress Bertha
appeared. In one hand she carried several books, and
in the other some writing paper, with a small inkhorn
suspended on her finger. She shut the door after her,
but did not attempt to lock it; and then laying down
the books and implements for writing on the table, she
turned round and gazed fixedly in Langford's face.
“Have we ever met before ?” she said at length.
“Your face is familiar to me. It comes back like some-
thing seen in a dream. Have we ever met before?”
“If we have,” replied Langford, “it must have been
many years ago, when the face of the child was very
different from the face of the man.”
She still gazed at him, and, after a considerable pause,
said, “I have brought you some books that you may
read, and where withal to write, if you like it. In return
for this, write me down your name.”
Langford smiled, and, taking up the pen, wrote down
his name in a bold, free hand. The woman gazed at

him as he did so; then carried her eye rapidly to the
writing. A bright and intelligent smile shone for a mo-
ment upon her thin pale lip, and she said, “Enough !
enough! that is quite enough. You have been taught
to believe that I have wronged you more than I have
wronged you; and although I have given you much
good counsel and much true information, you have
doubted me, and have not fully trusted me. I tell you
now, and I tell you truly, that I have not wronged you,
at least as far as my knowledge of right and wrong
goes, and therefore I am still willing to do all that I can
to serve you. The history of the past I may tell you
at some future time, and it will show you that I wronged
others less than they thought I did. But there is one
whom I will not name who has wronged you and yours
deeply; and I know his nature, I know human nature
too well, not to be sure that implacable hatred and con-
stant persecution is the offspring of such acts, rather
than sorrow, remorse, and atonement. It was on that
account that I bade you never come here. It was on
that account that I bade you fly his presence. Fate,
however, has brought you here at a moment when the
mortal agony of losing the only creature he really loved
may yet tame his fierce heart and bend his iron will. I
can do but little for you, for I am bound by an oath; an
oath which has bound me for many years; but fate,
which has brought you here, and has wrought an ex-
traordinary thing in your behalf, may yet do much. I
will leave it to its course. But with regard to your own
conduct, beware ! I warn you to beware. Choose well
your moment, and of all things be not hasty. But hark,
what is that I hear below ! There are his horse's feet,
and I must leave you. Thank God, those idiot justices
are gone.”
“Yet one moment,” said Langford, as she turned to
depart : “I may have thought that you wronged me
and mine, but I have not doubted, I have not suspected
you, as you suppose. On the contrary, in many things,
as you may have seen, I have followed your advice;
in others, the advice of one whom I was more strictly
bound to confide in.”
“Ay, and it was she who taught you to believe, it
was she who was weak enough to believe herself, that
I had been guilty of that which I would scorn.” -
“No !” exclaimed Langford, “no ! You mistake;


## p. 135 (#137) ############################################

THE ROBBER. 135
she never did believe you guilty. She owned that once,
in a moment of anger, she implied so; but she did you
justice in that respect through the whole of her life.
She told me more than once, too, that she had herself
seen you and assured you that she did not doubt you as
you imagined; that, anger having passed away, justice
und right judgment had returned.”
“But all her words were cold,” said Bertha, “ and all
her letters had something of restraint in them.”
“Consider her situation,” said Langford, in return;
“and remember that she had some cause to blame, as
yourself acknowledged; though, in regard to other
things, she might have done you injustice.”
“She did bitter injustice to herself,” replied the wo-
man, “and drove me to attach myself to others, though
I would fain have attached myself to her; and, having
done so, would have served her with my heart's blood;
but I must not linger; I will see you again ere long;
farewell!” and, thus saying, she left him, locking the
door behind her.
CHAPTER XII.
LANGFoRD had not been left five minutes alone Pre
the voices of persons rapidly approaching caught his
ear. At first he imagined that they proceeded from the
side by which he himself had entered; but the moment
after he became convinced that they came from the di-
rection of the other door, which, as he justly supposed,
communicated with a staircase in one of the large but-
tresses. At first, of course, the sounds were indistinct:
but, a moment after, a key was placed in the lock, and
a loud deep voice was heard exclaiming, “I will stop
for nothing till I have seen him face to face ! Where
is this murderer of my son?”
The door was thrown violently open before those
words were fully spoken, and the Earl of Danemore
himself stood before the prisoner.
He was a tall, handsome, powerful man, wide-chested,
broad-shouldered, and still very muscular, without being
at all corpulent. He might be sixty-three or sixty-four

years of age, and his hair was snowy white, . His eye-
brows, however, and his eyelashes, both of which were
long and full, were as black as night. There was many
a long deep furrow on his brow, and a sort of scornful
but habitual wrinkle between the nostril of the strong
aquiline nose and the corner of his mouth. On his right
cheek appeared a deep scar, round, and of about the size
of a pistol ball; and on the chin was a longer scar, cut-
ting nearly from the lip down into the throat and neck.
He was dressed in a suit of plain black velvet, with the
large riding boots and heavy sword which were com.
mon about fifteen or sixteen years before the period of
which we now speak, but which were beginning by this
time to go out of fashion.
On entering the room his teeth were hard set together.
his brow contracted till the large thick eyebrows almost
met, and his whole air fierce and agitated. His quick
eyes darted round the room in a moment, and alighted
upon Langford, who turned and faced him at once.
The moment, however, that their looks met, a strange
and sudden change came over the whole appearance of
Lord Danemore. He paused abruptly, and stood still
in the middle of the room, gazing in Langford's face,
while the frown departed from his brow, and he raised
his hand towards his head, passing it twice before his
eyes, as if he fancied that some delusion had affected
his sight. His lips opened as if he would have spoken
but for a moment or two no sounds issued forth; and
the calm, quiet, steady gaze with which Langford re-
garded him seemed to trouble and agitate him.
“What is your name ! what is your name?” he ex.
claimed, rapidly, when he could speak. “Who brought
you here?”
“My name is Henry Langford,” replied the prisoner.
“An ' in the service of his majesty; and, if you
seriously ask, my lord—for I suppose I have the honour
of speaking to the Earl of Danemore—if you seriously
ask who brought me hither, I have only to reply two
very silly persons calling themselves magistrates, who
have entertained, or rather manufactured, among them-
selves a charge against me for which there is not the
slightest foundation.”
“Henry Langford! Henry Langford!” repeated the
earl, cas: ng his eyes upon the ground and then raising
them again to Langford's face, every line and feature

THE in OBBER. 137
of which he seemed to scan with anxious care. “Pray,
of what family are you?”
“My father,” replied Langford, “was a gentleman of
some property in England, of which property, however,
I have been unjustly deprived;” and, as he spoke, he
fixed his eyes steadfastly upon the earl; but that noble-
man's countenance underwent no change, and he pro-
ceeded; “my mother was also a lady of some prop-
erty—”
“Where were you born?” demanded the earl, quickly.
“Though your questions are rather unceremonious,
my lord, for a perfect stranger,” Langford replied, “I
will not scruple to answer them. I was born in a small
town in this country.”
“Not in France!” demanded the earl, quickly. “I
do not ask without a motive; not in France? Are you
certain not in France 1”
“Perfectly certain,” replied Langford. “My mother's
family, however, were French; related to the illustrious
family of Beaulieu.”
“So !” said the earl, “so ! How nearly are you re-
lated to that family? are you sure not in France?”
“Quite certain,” repeated Langford. “I have lived
much in France, which may have given me some slight
foreign accent; and as to my relationship to the Beau-
lieus, I can really hardly tell how near. I have only
heard my mother say that she was nearly related to
them.”
“It cannot be It cannot be '" said the earl, closing
his eyes and looking down upon the ground. “Is your
mother living !”
A cloud came over Langford's brow: “She is not,”
he said.
The earl again seemed interested. “How long has
she been dead?” he asked.
“About two years,” Langford replied, and thereupon
the earl once more shook his head, saying, “It cannot
be: You are very like the late Marquis of Beaulieu,”
he added, “extremely like; and, though circumstances
have compelled me to discontinue my acquaintance
with that family, I knew the marquis once, and loved
him well. I could have almost fancied that you were
his son, and for his sake I cannot regard you with any
other eyes than those of kindness. But, yet, what do I

“They tell me you have murdered my son, my only
son. How strange, if the son of the man who had so
nearly killed the father, should, five-and-twenty years
after, have slain the son '"
“You forget, my lord, and you mistake altogether,”
replied Langford. “In the first place, I am not the son
of the Marquis of Beaulieu; and, in the next place, I
assure you most solemnly, by all I hold dear; I pledge
you my honour as a gentleman and a soldier, and my
oath as a Christian and a man, that I have had no more
share in this unfortunate event than you have.”
“I would willingly believe you,” answered the earl,
“most willingly, for yours is a countenance from which
I have been accustomed to expect nothing but truth and
honour. Yet why do these men accuse you! Why,
if there be not proof as strong as truth itself, why do
they dare to bring an accusation against one of your
high house? Oh, young man! young man! if you have
slain him by fraud or villany, I will take vengeance of
you by making you the public spectacle, and giving you
up to the rope and the scaffold; chains shall hang about
you even in your death, and your bones shall whiten in
the wind. But, if you have slain him foot to foot and
hand to hand, you shall meet a father's vengeance in
another way. Ay! old as I am, I will take your heart's
blood, and you shall find that this arm has lost nothing
of its skill and but little of its strength. You shall learn
what a father's arm can do when heavy with the sword
of the avenger!”
“Once more, my lord,” replied Langford, calmly, “I
assure you that I am perfectly innocent. I assure you
that, neither fairly and openly, nor covertly and treach-
erously, have I had aught to do with your son's death
The sole ground for suspicion against me has been what
I will not conceal from you, my lord, that, upon a slight
quarrel between us, he drew his sword upon me in the
park of Sir Walter Herbert.”
“Ay, Sir Walter Herbert!” exclaimed the peer, with
a bitter sneer; “the pitiful old fool! He and his fair
dainty daughter, Mistress Alice, they would none of my
son, would they not? He shall pay for it in prison, and
she shall see him rot before her eyes. Ay, now I guess
how it all is. She has found a lover in fair Master
Henry Langford, has she? and he has murdered a rival
who might have proved troublesome They shall an:

swer for it, they shall answer for it! Ho! below there!”
he continued, approaching the door. “Bring me up the
papers which those two knights left!”
Langford suffered him to proceed with the wild and
rapid starts to which the vehemence of his passions led
him; but when he paused, the prisoner took up the con-
versation, saying, “I was about to tell you, my lord, that
your son did seek a quarrel with me; did draw his
sword upon me; did try to induce me to follow his ex-
ample, but in vain.”
“What!” interrupted the peer, “did you refuse to
fight him 1 How was that? a soldier, and a man of
your race?”
“I did refuse to fight him, my lord,” replied Lang-
ford, “for particular reasons of my own. I have had
many opportunities of showing that fear forms no part
of my nature, and I am not at all apprehensive of ever
being mistaken for a coward.”
He spoke with a calm and easy dignity, slightly throw-
ing back his head, while the fine-formed nostril expanded
with a sense of honourable pride. The earl gazed upon
him attentively, the angry fire that had been in his eyes
gradually subsiding as he did so ; and he repeated more
than once, in a low voice, “So like: So strangely like '"
At that moment, with the rapidity of one accustomed
to obey the orders of a quick and imperious master, a
servant appeared bringing in the bundle of papers which
contained the evidence collected against Langford at
Moorhurst. The earl cast himself into a chair, spread
the papers out upon the table, and ran his eye rapidly
over them, one after another. Langford had also seated
himself, and watched the proceedings of the earl atten-
tively, though neither of the u spoke for some minutes.
When the earl had done, looked up in the prison
er's face, and, after pausing with a thoughtful air fo)
several moments, he said, “This is a case of suspicion
against you, but nothing more. I myself, the person
most interested, cannot make more of it; and from
what I see of you, from your face and from your family,
I will add that I do not believe you guilty.”
“My lord, you do me justice,” replied Langford, “and
it makes me right glad to see you so inclined. There
was an old custom which was not without its value,
for human nature cannot be wholly mastered even by
the most consummate art; and I am now willing to re-

cur to the old custom, to give you further proof that
you judge rightly of me. Let me be taken to the room
where your poor son lies. I will place my hand upon
his heart, and swear to my innocence. I do not suppose,
my lord, that the blood would flow again if I were cul-
pable; but I do believe that no man, conscious of such
a crime as murder, could perform that act without be-
traying by his countenance the guilty secret within him.
I am ready to perform it before any persons that you
choose to appoint.”
“Are you not aware,” demanded the earl, sternly,
“that the body has not been found?”
“Good God!” exclaimed Langford, his whole face
brightening in a moment, “then perhaps he is living yet.
This is the most extraordinary tale that ever yet was
told; a man arrested, accused, wellnigh condemned for
the murder of another who is probably alive. A thou-
sand to one he is still alive! Oh, my lord, be comfort-
ed, be comforted !”
“You deceive yourself, young man,” replied the earl,
with a melancholy shake of the head, “you deceive
yourself. His death is but too clearly proved. His
white horse returned last night alone, with his own neck
and the saddle all stained with blood. The road by Up-
water Mere was found drenched with gore; with my
child's gore ! and his cloak was found among the beeches
hard by, pierced on the left side with a pistol shot,
which must have been fired close to his bosom, for the
wadding had burnt the silk. It, too, was stiff with blood.
There were traces of several horses' feet about, but no
trace of where the body had been carried; though I my-
self—I, his father—have spent several hours in seeking
the slightest vestige that might direct me. Doubtless it
is thrown into the mere;” and as he spoke he covered .
his eyes with his hands, and remained for several min-
utes evidently overpowered with deep emotion, against
which he struggled strongly, but in vain.
Langford, too, was moved; and after having waited
in silence for several minutes, in the hope that the
agitation which his companion suffered would pass
away, he ventured to address some words of comfort
to Lord Danemore; saying, “I am deeply grieved, my
lord, that you have such cause for apprehension; but
still I cannot help hoping that all these causes for believ-
ing the worst may prove fallacious, and that your son.
may yet be restored to you.”

“No, no, sir! no !” replied the earl, “I will not de-
ceive myself, nor do I wish to be deceived. Such evi-
dence is too clear. I am not a child or a woman, that
I cannot bear any lot assigned to me. I can look my
fate in the face, however dark and frowning its brow may
be, and can to say to it, ‘Thou hast but power over me
to a certain degree; over my mind thou canst not tri-
umph; and even while thou wringest my heart and
leavest my old age desolate, I can defy thee still !’”
Langford bent down his eyes upon the ground, and
did not reply for several minutes. He did not approve
the spirit in which those words were spoken, but yet it
was not his task to rebuke or to admonish; and when
he did reply, he again sought to instil hope.
“Your lordship says,” he observed, at length, “that
the evidence is too clear. It is certainly clear enough
to justify great and serious apprehensions, but not to
take away hope or to impede exertion. I remember
having heard of an instance, which occurred in far dis-
tant climates, where the causes for supposing a person
dead were much more conclusive than in the present
instance. A sailor had left the ship to which he be-
longed, and wandered on shore in a place infested with
pirates. He did not return. Boats were sent after
him, and in tracing the course of one of the rivers up
which he was supposed to have taken his way, his
clothes were found bloody, torn, and cut with the blows
of a sword; a leathern purse, which he was known to
have carried full of money, was found farther on, de-
void of its contents; and farther still a mangled and
mutilated body, in which almost all his comrades de-
clared they recognised his corpse; and yet, three years
after that, he rejoined the ship to which he belonged,
having made his escape from the party of robbers by
whom he had been taken. The body which had been
found was that of another man, though the clothes and
the purse undoubtedly were his own.
While he spoke the earl turned deadly pale, gazed
upon him for a moment or two with a straining eye,
then suddenly started up, and without a word of reply
left the room. -
Langford at first seemed surprised, but smiled clightly
as he saw him go; then calmly sat down at the table,
took up the papers which the earl had left behind him,
read over the evidence against himself, and wrote in the

margin a number of observations, wherever any strained
or unjust conclusion seemed to have been drawn by the
magistrates. He had been occupied in this manner
about an hour when the earl again made his appear-
ance. His manner was very different from what it had
been on the previous occasion. There was a want of
that fierce energy which had before characterized it;
there was a doubtfulness, a hesitation, and a vagueness
quite opposed to the keen sharp decision of his former
demeanour. He trusted Langford more as an acquaint-
ance, more even as a friend than as a prisoner. Two
or three times he spoke of the chances of his son being
still alive, and referred vaguely to the story which
Langford had told him, but then darted off suddenly to
something else.
At length, however, he took up the papers on which
the other had commented, and, without noticing the ob-
servations that he had written, said it was unjust, upon
a case where there was nothing made out against him
but suspicion, that he should be detained as a close pris-
oner. “If, therefore,” he said, “you will give me your
word not to attempt to make your escape, the doors
shall be thrown open to you; this chamber and the next
shall be your abode for the time, though they should
have put you somewhere else, for this room is appropri-
ated to me. Here,” he continued, in a thoughtful and
abstracted tone, “when I wish to think over all the
crowded acts of a long, eventful, and constantly chan-
ging life, I come and sit, where no sound interrupts me
but the twittering of the swallow as it skims past my
windows. Here I can people the air with the things,
and beings, and deeds of the past, without the empty
crowd of the insignificant living breaking in upon my
solitude, and sweeping away the thinner but more thrill-
ing creations called up by memory. I know not how
it is, young gentleman, that there is scarcely any one
but you whom I could have borne patiently to see in
this chamber; but your countenance seems connected
with those days to which this room is dedicated. There
is a resemblance, a strong and touching resemblance
to several persons long dead; and that likeness calls
up again to my mind many a vision of my youthful
days; days between which and the dark present lies a
gulf of fiery passions, sorrows, and regrets. I know
not wherefore they put you here, or who dared to do it,

but it is strange that, being here, you seem to my eyes
the only fit tenant of this chamber except myself. Here
I sit and read the letters of dead friends; here I sit and
ponder over the affections and the hatreds, the hopes,
the fears, the wrath, the enjoyment, the sorrow, the re-
morse of the past; here often do I sit and gaze upon
the pictures of those I loved in former times, of the
dead, and the changed, and the alienated; of persons
who, when those pictures were painted, never thought
that there could come a change upon them or upon me,
either in the bodily or the mental frame; never dreamed
of the mattock, and the grave, and the coffin, and the
slow curling worm that has long since revelled in their
heart; no, nor of fierce and fiery contention, envy, jeal.
ousy, rivalry, hatred, the death of bright affection, and
the burial of every warm and once living hope. Here
am I, still wont to gaze upon their pictures, and I know
not how it is, but it seems to me as if your face were
among them.” .
“I fear me, my lord,” replied Langford, “that those
endowed with strong feelings and strong passions are
most frequently like children with a box of jewels,
squandering precious things without knowing their
value, and gaining in exchange but gauds and bawbles,
the paint and tinsel of which is soon brushed off, leav-
ing us nothing but regret. There is no time of life,
however, I believe, at which we may not recover some
of the jewels which we have cast away, if we but seek
for them rightly; and I know no means likely to be
more successful than that which you take in tracing
back your steps through the past.”
“It is a painful contemplation,” said Lord Danemore,
“ and I fear that, in the dim twilight of age, let me trace
back my steps as closely as I will, I am not likely to
find again many of the jewels that. I scattered from me
in the full daylight of youth.”
“Perhaps, my lord,” replied Langford, “you might
if you were to take a light. However,” he added, see-
ing a look of impatience coming upon the earl, “I am
much obliged to you for your offer of a partial kind of
freedom. I never loved to have a door locked between
me and the rest of the world; and I willingly promise
you to make no attempt to escape during the whole of
this day, for, of course, my promise must have a limit.
In the c jurse of that day you will most likely be able

to procure farther information in regard to this sad af.
fair; and I do trust and hope that it may be such as
may relieve your bosom from the apprehensions which
now oppress you.” -
“I must exact your promise for two days,” said the
earl, “for I have sent to tell those two foolish men who
brought you here that I cannot deal with them to-day,
and have bidden them, in consequence of what you have
said, though with but little hope, to cause search of ev-
ery kind to be made through the country round. There
are one or two questions, also, which I would fain ask
you, but I will not do it now; yet I know not why I
should not—but no, not now! Have I your promise ?”
“You have,” replied Langford; and the earl, after paus-
ing and hesitating a moment or two longer, left him by
the chief entrance, leaving the doors open behind him.
“There is but one thing I ask of you,” added the earl,
as he turned to depart; “should you leave these two
rooms, lock the door of the one in which you now are
till you return, for I do not suffer the feet of ordinary
servants to profane it.”
When Langford was alone, he paused for a moment
or two to think again over his situation; and then, with
a natural desire to use the freedom that had been given
him, opened the door of the chamber in which he had
been placed, and proceeded through the bedroom be-
yond to the head of the staircase. Remembering the
earl's request to lock the door, he turned back to do so,
and when he again approached the stairs the voice of
some one singing below rose to his ear. The tone in which
the singer poured forth his ditty was low, but, after lis-
tening for a moment, Langford recognised the voice of
the poor half-witted man, John Graves, and a sudden
hope of finding means of clearing himself by the aid of
that very person struck him. He descended the stairs
slowly, and, at the bottom of the first flight, found the
wanderer sitting on the lower step, with his head hang-
ing down in an attitude of dejection; and, laying his
hand upon his shoulder, Langford caused him to start
up suddenly and turn round.
“Ah, Master Harry!” cried the man, in one of his
saner moods, “is that you ! It is you I came to see.
I heard they had taken you up, and locked you up here,
and I came to see if I could help you, for you have al-
ways been kind and generous to me; and then, if I could

not help you, I could sing you a song, and that would
do you good, you know ; I always said you ought to
have your rights, you know; but I must not say so here,
or they will scold me as they did before.”
“Come up hither with me, John,” said Langford'; “I
believe that you can help me if you will; but how came
you here? Do they suffer you knowingly to wander
about the house in this manner '"
“Not as far as this,” replied the man, laughing, “not
as far as this. They would soon drive me down if they
saw me above the grand stairs. But about the passages
below they never mind me. Only I sometimes creep
up and find my way about all the rooms, and, if I hear
a step, hide behind a window-curtain. It is no later
than last night that I and another—but I must not speak
of that. Never you mind, Master Harry, you will have
your rights still.” -
“Perhaps so, John,” answered Langford, “though I
do not think you well know what my rights are. How-
ever, now follow me up here.” Thus saying, he led the
way to the apartments which had been assigned to him,
followed quickly by the madman, whose step was as
noiseless and stealthy as if he had been going to murder
the sleeping. When he saw Langford approach the
door of the inner room, he cast an anxious and furtive
glance towards the top of the stairs and listened, and,
as soon as the lock was turned and the entrance free,
he ran in and closed it after him, looking straight to-
wards one of the small cupboards in the wall, saying,
“There ! there ! Be quick for fear some one should
come !”
Langford gazed on him with some surprise, and then
replied, “You know more of these mattersthan I thought
you did. However, you mistake. I want you merely
to bear a letter and a message for me.”
“But the papers the papers !” exclaimed the other.
“Are you not going to take the papers?”
“No !” exclaimed Langford. “Certainly not by
stealth, John.”
“Then it is you that are mad,” replied his compan-
ion; “and they have mistaken me for you. I will go
and make affidavit of it.”
“I should not hold myself justified in taking them
stealthily,” replied Langford. “Perhaps, ere I leave
this house, I may claim them boldly; and some time or

another I must make you tell me how you know so
much of matters I thought secret; but time is wanting
now, and we may be interrupted. I have some reason
to think that, if you will, you can find out for me a per
son called Franklin Gray.”
“Can I find him out?” said the madman. “Ay, that
I can ; in two hours I can be with him.”
“Will you bear a message from me to him,” de
manded Langford, “without forgetting a word of it, and
without telling a word to any one else?”
“That I will, joyfully,” replied the other; “I never
forget; I wish I could. It is that turns me mad; I re-
member too well; and I will tell nothing, though they
should put me to the torture. I always tell truth if I
tell anything; but I can hold my tongue.” -
“Well, then,” said Langford, “tell Franklin Gray for
me, that I am here kept a prisoner on a charge of shoot-
ing poor Lord Harold. If he be shot, I entertain but
few doubts in regard to who it was that did it; and I
ask Franklin Gray, in honour and in memory of our old
companionship, to give me the means of clearing and
delivering myself.”
“Franklin Gray shot him not,” replied the madman;
“that I know full well. Franklin and I are friends;
don’t you know that, Master Harry? For a fox, he is
the best of foxes! But I’ll do as you tell me, however.”
“I know he did not shoot him,” answered Langford;
“I am as sure of that as you are. Nevertheless, carry
him my message. But hold,” he said, seeing the man
turning abruptly to depart, “I will write a few lines to
good Sir Walter Herbert, which I shall be glad if you
will give into his hands, or into the hands of his daugh-
ter.”
The half-witted man signified his willingness to do
anything that Langford told him; and, sitting down at
the table, that gentleman wrote a few lines to Sir Wal-
ter Herbert, briefly explaining to him his situation, and
begging him, in case of his being detained beyond the
close of the subsequent day, to take measures to ensure
that justice was done him. This epistle he had no means
of sealing; and, merely folding it up in the form of a
letter, he put it into the hands of his hairbrained, and
suffered him to depart.

CHAPTER XIII.
TIIE man who, as we have said, received in that part of
the country the name of Silly John, stole quietly down
the stairs, and, finding nobody to impede his proceedings,
had no sooner entered the corridor below than he was
seized with a determination of descending the great
staircase, thinking, as he expressed it in his commune
with himself, that it would make him feel like a lord for
once in his life.
We all see and know that every step which we take
in our onway path through existence, whether directed
by reason or prompted by caprice, whether apparently
of the most trifling nature or seemingly of the utmost
consequence, not only affects ourselves and the course
of our fate, but more or less influences the state, the
fortunes, and the future of others, even to the most
remote bounds of that vast space in which cause and
effect are constantly weaving the wide-spread web of
events. So philosophers teach us; and such was cer-
tainly the case in the present instance; for the whim
which led Silly John down the grand staircase of Dane-
more Castle was by no means without its effect upon
Henry Langford; and might, under many circumstances,
have produced consequences of very great importance.
The whole house was silent, for the servants of all
classes and denominations were busy at their afternoon
meal; and the half-witted man, after looking round to
see that no one was near, put on an air of mock dignity,
stuck the cock's feather more smartly in his hat, threw
out one leg and then the other with a wide stride, and
saying to himself in a low tone, “Now I’m a lord !”
began to descend the staircase. At that moment his
eye fell upon a sword, with its belt and sword-knot,
hanging up in the corridor, and, in order to make his
figure complete, he turned back and decorated his per-
son there with. -
When he had got to the bottom of the stairs, how-
ever, he looked at the sword with a somewhat wistful
eye, as if he would fain have retained it to ornament his
person; but then, muttering to himself, “No, no, I must

not steal : Remember the eighth commandment, John
Graves !” he unslung the sword, and looked it all over.
When he had done he burst into a laugh, exclaiming,
“It is Master Harry's sword, the very sword with which
he slit that fox's neck when they attacked Mistress
Alice. They have taken it away from him, but I'll take
it back again;” and, so saying, he ran hastily up to the
door of the chamber in which he had left Langford, and,
after tapping loudly with his knuckles, laid the weapon
down upon the threshold, and tripped rapidly away.
While Langford opened the door, and with some sur-
prise took up his own sword, of which he had been de-
prived by the magistrates when he had been brought to
the castle, Silly John made the best of his way down
the stairs, out of the front gates, across the esplanade
and into the park. The feat that he had performed
seemed to have given him a sort of impetus which he
could not resist; and he ran on across the park as fast
as his lameness would let him, scrambled over the park
paling, and never stopped till he had arrived at that point
of the road where it branched into two divisions. There,
however, he paused, and entered into one of those con-
sultations with himself which were not unfrequent with
him, and which formed a peculiar feature in his madness.
He suddenly remembered that he had two commis-
sions to perform, and that he had no directions as to
which was to be first executed. On all such occasions
of difficulty, Silly John argued with himself on both
sides of the question with the nicety of a special pleader;
weighing every motive on either part; starting difficul-
ties and solving them; seeing differences and shades of
difference where none existed; and, in fact, acting the
part of Hudibras and Ralpho both in one.
On the present occasion he stood discussing the
question of whether he should first deliver the letter to
Sir Walter Herbert or the message to Franklin Gray
for nearly an hour; and was seen by many persons who
passed, laying down to himself the reasons, pro and
con, with the forefinger of his right hand tapping the
forefinger of his left at every new argument on either
side. As he found it utterly impossible to settle the mat-
ter by dint of reasoning, he fell at length upon an expe-
dient which decided it as rationally as any other means
he could have brought to bear upon it. Fixing himself
firmly upon the heel of his uninjured foot, he extended

THE ROBBER. 149
the other leg and arm, and whirled himself violently
round as if on a pivot, determining to follow that road
to which his face was turned when he stopped.
It happened that the direction in which he at length
found his face was towards the Manor House, and he
accordingly bent his steps thither with all speed. The
quantity of time which he had lost in his consultation
with himself, however, and that occupied in going, ren-
dered it very late in the day before he arrived; so that,
although the servant to whom he delivered the note
asked him in a kindly tone to come in and take some
beer, he looked wistfully at the sky, from which the
sun had just gone down, and, shaking his head, walked
away, turning his steps towards the moor. The dis-
tance, as we have before shown, was considerable; and
as he went, the long twilight of a summer's evening
grew dimmer and more dim, faded away entirely, and
night succeeded. Still, however, the poor fellow toiled
on up the hill, followed the road that led across the
moor, and passed the very spot where Langford had
seen the pistol fired on the preceding night.
As he went by the beeches, he thought he heard a
rustling sound beneath them; and, though accustomed
to go at all hours through the wildest and least fre-
quented paths, either fatigue and want of food, or some
other cause, had unnerved him, and the sound made him
start. He ran on upon the road as fast as ne could, and
then turned to look behind him. There was no moon,
the night was sultry and dark, and it was difficult to dis-
tinguish any object distinctly; but he saw, or believed
he saw, two men come out from the beeches as if to
follow him; and he again ran on with all speed, taking
his way across the moor. After he had gone about half
a mile, he cast himself flat down among some fern and
heath, and lay there for ten minutes or a quarter of an
hour; after which he arose again, and hurried on to-
wards the dwelling of Franklin Gray. Twice he thought
he heard steps behind him; and his heart rejoiced when
he saw the gate in the wall that surrounded the court.
The gate was locked, however; the whole house looked
dark and untenanted; not a window in the tower, or in
the large building by the side, showed the slightest ray
of light; and as he stood and shook the gate, he dis-
tinctly heard quick steps coming on the very path he,
had pursued. - N 2

150 The ROBBER.
A degree of terror which he had seldom before feit
now took possession of him; and he ran round the wall
as fast as he could, seeking for some entrance at the back,
The first gate that he met with resisted like the other;
but a second, fifty or sixty yards farther on, opened at
once, and he hurried on towards the part of the building
before him. He still seemed to hear the steps behind
him; and with fear that amounted almost to agony, he felt
along the wall for a bell or some other means of making
himself heard. As he did so, his hand came against a
door, which gave way beneath his touch, and he had
almost fallen headlong down some steps. He caught,
however, by the lintel in time; and, glad of any entrance,
went down slowly, feeling his way with his foot and
hands till he reached a level pavement. The air was
cooler than it had been above; and a small square aper-
ture at a considerable distance before him, while it gave
admission to the wind, also showed the sort of faint
dim light which yet lingered in the sky. Towards it he
took his way after having listened for a moment with a
beating heart, to ascertain whether he was pursued,
and having made himself sure that he was not.
For a few paces nothing interrupted his progress,
but the next moment he stumbled over some object on
the ground; and, as he attempted to raise himself, his
hand came in contact with something that felt like cloth.
He instantly drew it back; but, after pausing a moment
and hesitating, he stretched it out slowly again, and .
it lighted upon the cold clammy features of a dead
man's face. Starting back, he again fell over the object
which had thrown him down before, and which he now
found to be a coffin.
Although all these circumstances were in themselves
horrible, they served, in some degree, to relieve the
mind of poor John Graves, who now remembered the
ruins of the old church, which stood near, and naturally
concluded that he had got into the vaults. The confu-
sion of his brain prevented him from remembering that
the place had been long unused for its original and le-
gitimate purposes, and he was not one of those who
feel any horror at the mere presence of the dead. On
the contrary, the sight of the clay after the spirit had
departed seerned to offer to his madness a curious matter
of speculation, and he was fond of visiting the chamber
of death among all the cottages in the neighbourhood.

After he had a little recovered himself, then, he mut-
tered, “It’s a corpse! I wonder if it is a man or a wo-
man;” and he put out his hand again towards the face,
and ran it over the jaw and lips to feel for the beard.
“It must be a gentleman to be put in the vault,” he
continued; “his hand will tell that! Poor men's hands
are hard; and the rich keep their palms soft. I wonder
if it is gold makes men's palms soft 1 Yes, it is a gen-
tleman,” he continued, as he slid his hand down the arm
to the cold palm of the dead man.
But at that moment a light began to stream through
the door by which he had entered, and his terror was
once more renewed. “If they catch me here,” he mut-
tered, “ they will think I am come to steal coffin-plates;”
and as the increasing light showed him some of the ob-
jects round, he perceived a broken part of the wall
which separated that vault from the next, and which lay
in ruin amid the remains of former generations; with
many a coffin stripped of all its idle finery by the hand
of time piled up against it, together with dust and rub-
bish, and the crumbling vestiges of mortality.
Behind the screen thus formed the half-witted man
crept, and lay trembling with a vague dread of he did not
well know what; while the light, which by this time had
approached close to the door, remained stationary for a
moment, and two or three voices were heard speaking
in a low tone. The next moment three men descended
into the vault, "one of whom bore a flambeau in his
han'; but, for the first two or three minutes after they
entered, Silly John could only hear without seeing, as
his terror prevented him from making the slightest
mOVement.
“You may as well wipe away the blood from off his
face before you put him into the box,” said one, as he
and his companions seemed to stand by the corpse and
gaze upon it with curious and speculating eyes.
“That was a deadly shot,” said the other. “Poor
devil! he never spoke a word after.”
“He well deserved it,” said a third voice, “that's my
opinion; and, when that's the case, the deadlier the
shot the better. But let us make haste, Master Hardie;
though I do not see why he should be buried with that
smart belt on. Come, let us toss up for it. Here is a
crown-piece. You toss, Hardie.”
While this conversation had been going on, the poor

half-witted man had remained ensconced behind the
coffins and broken wall, trembling in every limb. This
tremour assuredly proceeded from fear, and not from
cold; for the air, which had been sultry all day, had now
grown oppressively hot; and the heavy clouds, which
had been rolling up during the evening like a vast curtain
between earth and the free breath of heaven, had by
this time covered the whole sky; while a few large drops
of rain, pattering among the ruins of the church, and the
broken stones, and long grass without, formed no un-
musical prelude to the storm that was about soon to de-
scend.
Scarcely had Doveton spoken (for he it was who took
the lead upon the present occasion) when a faint blue
gleam suddenly lighted up the inside of the vault, pro-
ceeding from the small square window, and flashing
round upon all the grim and sombre features of the
place, coffins, and sculls, and bones, and broken and
disjointed stones, and high piles of mouldy earth, con-
sisting chiefly of the dust of the dead. It came like the
clear and searching glance of eternal truth, making dark
secrets bright, and bringing forth from their obscurity
all the dim hidden things of earth. That gleam flashed
upon the countenances of the three robbers as they
stood around the corpse, unmoved, unshaken by the sol-
emn aspect of death, by the awful picture of their own
mortality. The sudden glance of the lightning, how-
ever, made them each start involuntarily. He who held
the crown-piece in his hand let it drop. No thunder
followed the first flash, but another far more bright and
vivid succeeded, playing round the buckles and clasps
of the very swordbelt that one of them was in the act
of removing from the corpse. A crash, which could
not have been louder had the fragments of a mountain
been poured upon their heads, came instantly after, sha-
king the whole building as if it would have cast down
the last stone of the ruin.
“By —,” cried one of the robbers, uttering a horrid
imprecation, “what a peal !” -
“Ay, and what a flash !” said another; “but, come,
take off the belt, for fear he gets up off the trestles and
stops us!”
“Ay, if we let him,” said Doveton; “but may I never
Speak again if I did not think I saw his lips move :
There! there!” he continued, as another flash of light-

ning shone again upon the features of the dead man, re-
versing all the lights which the flambeau had cast upon it,
and making the whole features, without any real change,
assume an expression entirely different. “Ther
there ! I told you so ! Look, he is grinning at us.”
“Pooh, nonsense!” cried another; “the man's deat
he'll never grin again. Yet, by my life, there is th
blood running !” And so far he spoke truth; for th
jerk which had been given to the body in order to di
tach the swordbelt had caused a stream of dark gore t
well slowly down and drop upon the ground. -
“Let the belt be let the belt be !” cried Hardcastl
“Hold the torch to his face and see if he does move
No, no! he is still enough! but, after all, one does n
iike dragging him out in such a night as this, to bury
him upon the cold moor. It would not matter if he
were alive; but let us stay here till the storm is over,
and you, Harvey, run and get us some drink. It's nei-
ther a nice night, nor a nice place, nor a nice business;
so we may as well have something to cheer us.”
“I have no objection to the flagon,” said Doveton, as
Harvey left them to obtain the peculiar sort of liquid
cheerfulness to which men engaged in not the most le-
gitimate callings generally have recourse; “I have no
objection to the flagon, but you know we must have
done the job before the morning, Hardie, and the grave
is not dug yet.” -
“Oh, we'll soon dig the grave,” replied Hardcastle,
“the ground is soft upon the moor, and it need not be
very deep. Do you think, Doveton, that when folks
are dead they can see us? I have often thought that
very likely they can see and hear just as well as ever,
but can’t move or speak.” - * -
“I hope not ! I hope not!” cried his companion; and
at that moment came another flash of lightning, gleam-
ing round and round the vault, followed by the tremen-
dous roar of the thunder, and the rushing and the pat-
tering of the big rain.
The whole scene was so awful; the corpse, the rob
bers, the vault, the thunder-storm, their speculations
upon the dead, the mixture of superstition and impious
daring which they displayed, the revel that they were
preparing to hold by the side of a murdered body, and
the images of the flagon and the grave, formed alto-
gether a whole so terrible and so extraordinary, that

the poor man who lay concealed and beheld the strange
and dreadful proceeding could endure it no longer; but,
starting up in a fit of desperation, he darted forward,
overthrowing the pile of coffins before him, and rushing
with the countenance of a risen corpse towards the
stone steps which led into the vault. Surprised and
terrified, the two robbers started back, the flambeau fell
and nearly extinguished itself upon the ground, the body
of the dead man was overthrown at their feet; and,
rushing on without pause, John Graves had gained the
stairs and effected his exit before they knew who or
what it was that had so suddenly broken in upon their
conference.
Running as if a whole legion of fiends had been be-
hind him, heeding not the deluge of rain that was now
falling from the sky, but staggering and putting his hand
to his eyes when the bright gleam of the lightning
flashed across his path, the half-witted man hurried
back again with all speed towards the moor, nor ceased
for a moment the rapid steps which carried him forward
till he had reached the beeches by Upwater Mere.
There sitting down and clasping his hands over his
knees, he remained with his whole thoughts cast into
a state of greater confusion than ever, watching the
liquid fire as it glanced over the water. and talking to
himself whenever the thunder would let him hear his
own voice. -
It seemed, however, as if the same ghastly objects
were destined to pursue him through that night; for
scarcely had the storm in some degree abated, and
while a faint gray streak was just beginning to shine
through the clouds, marking where the dim moon lay
veiled behind them, when he heard coming steps; and,
as his only resource, he clambered into one of the beech
trees, and sat watching what took place below. The
only objects that he could distinguish were the forms
of three men carrying a burden between them. They
laid it down under the trees, and for the space of about
half an hour there was the busy sound of the pickaxe
and the spade, the shovelfuls of earth cast forth, and the
slow delving noise when the heavy foot pressed the
edge into the ground. At the end of that time the bur-
den was lifted up, deposited in the pit, and the earth
iled in again. It was done with haste, for the gray
wn was beginning to appear; and John Graves could

THE ROBBER. 155
clearly distinguish the forms of Doveton, Hardcastle,
and Harvey, as, each taking up a part of the tools they
had empioyed, they hurried away to escape the clear
eye of day.
When they were gone, the half-witted man came
down from the tree, and stood gazing upon the spot
where the fresh gray earth of the moor, mingling with
the thin green grass under the beech trees, showed the
place where they had concealed the body.
“And liest thou there, Harold?” he said, speaking
aloud, though there was nobody to hear, as was very
much his custom. “And liest thou there, poor boy, with
nothing around thee but the cold damp earth, and the
gray morning of a storm shining upon thy last bed?
And did they nurse thee so tenderly for this! did thy
father spend wealth, and care, and thought; did he wrong
others, and endanger his chance of heaven, and squan-
der hope, and fear, and passion, and cunning, all for this?
that thou shouldst lie here, without his knowing where
thou restest; that thou shouldst lie here, like the daisy
which his proud horse's feet cut off as he gallops along,
without his knowing that it is broken? Alack and a-
well-a-day! Alack and a-well-a-day! Poor boy, though
thou hadst something of thy father's fire and something
of thy mother's weakness, thou wert good and gener-
ous, and tender and compassionate. I know not how
it is, Harold, but I am more sorry for thee than for peo-
ple that I have loved better, and I cannot bear to think
that thou shouldst lie here on this gloomy moor. Nor
shalt thou, if I should dig thee out with my own hands!
But then they'll say I killed thee,” he added, after a
moment's thought, “as they have said already of one
who would as soon have killed himself. So I'll go and
tell thy father, my poor boy! but no, I forgot, I must
first go back to that man, for I promised; and I always
keep my promise. It could not be Gray that killed
thee. No, no, I do not think that. He's not fond of
blood. He spared my life, so why should he take thirie :
I do not half like to go to him, yet I must, because I
promised.” -
Poor Silly John lingered for some time beside the
grave after he had finished this soliloquy, and then
turned his steps back again, with some degree of confi-
dence gained from the open daylight, towards the abode
of Franklin Gray. He still hesitated, however, and ag,

prehensions of some kind made him wander at a distance
from the house for several hours before he could make
up his mind to approach it. He even went to a small
alehouse, and strengthened his resolution with beer and
bread and cheese; but that which, perhaps, afforded
him more courage than anything, was the act of paying
for his morning's meal with part of the money which
Franklin Gray himself had given him.
As we have before seen, the conclusions at which
the poor man arrived were very often just, and his mad-
ness consisted rather in a kind of wandering, an occa-
sional want of the power of seizing and holding any-
thing firmly, than in folly. In the present instance,
then, he inferred, from the sight of the money given him
by Franklin Gray, that a person who had treated him
so kindly would not ill-use him or suffer him to be ill-
used; and, accordingly, he gained courage from the
contemplation, and set out for the tower. Although he
had been twice there before since Franklin Gray had
been the tenant thereof, yet, on both those occasions,
his visits had been after dark; but, as he approached at
present the scenes of all the horrors of the preceding
night, he could scarcely believe his eyes, so different
was the whole when displayed in the broad sunshine
from that which it appeared under the shadow. In this
instance, however, the face that it wore in the open day
was the deceptive one, as is but too common through
the world, and in life, and in the human heart. The
tower, and the large building by its side, and the court
within its walls, were converted into a farmhouse, with
its barns, and its yard full of straw, and ploughshares, and
farming implements, while carts stood around bearing
the name of “Franklin Gray, farmer;” though the name
of the place which followed was that of a distant part
of the country, where probably he had exercised the
same kind of farming which he now carried on. There
were two or three stout men in farming habiliments
about the yard too, whose faces were not unfamilial
to the eye of John Graves, and an honest watchdog
stood chained near the stable door, as if the good farm-
er was in fear of nightly depredators. A flaxen-head-
ed ploughboy whistled gayly in the court; and, at the
moment that Silly John approached, a very lovely
creature, habited in plain white garments, and carrying
a beautiful child of little more than a year old in her

arms, was crossing on tiptoe the dirty yard, wet and
muddy with the storm of the preceding night.
“A dainty farmer's dame, indeed!” said the half-
witted man to himself; “but I'll speak to her rather
than to any of the foxes. Women are always kindest.”
His singular appearance had already attracted the
attention of the person who was the subject of his con-
templation, and she seemed at once to comprehend his
character and the nature of the affliction under which
he laboured. -
“He is one of the happy,” she said, speaking low,
and to herself. “What would you, poor man?” she
added, with her sweet-toned voice and foreign accent;
“do you seek money or food?” a
The half-witted man did not reply directly to her
question, but, caught by her appearance and by her ac-
cent, his mind seemed to wander far away to other
things, and he answered, “Ay, pretty lady, there have
been others such as you. Many a one leaves her own
land and marries a stranger, and is soon taught to re-
pent, as women always will repent when they have
trusted those they knew not, and forgotten their own
friends, and cast their country behind them.”
She whom he addressed answered first by a smile,
and then said, “Not always! My husband will never
make me repent; he never has made me repent, though
long ago I did all you said, trusted a stranger, forgot
my own friends, and cast my country behind me. But
what would you, poor man? Can I help you?”
“Only tell Franklin Gray,” replied the other, “that
Henry Langford has been taken up on the charge of kill-
ing Lord Harold, and that they keep him a prisoner in
Danemore Castle; so that now’s the time to help him.
I want nothing more, lady, but God’s blessing upon your
beautiful face;” and, so saying, he hurried away and
left her, while a slight degree of colour came up into
the cheek of Mona Gray, as much at the earnestness of
the look which he gave her as at the allusion to her
beauty.

CHAPTER XIV.
THE world we live in is full of beautiful sights and
sweet sounds; it is a treasure-house of loveliness and
of melody. Whether the eye ranges over the face of
nature at large, and marks all the varied, the magnifi-
cent, the sweet, the bright, the gentle, in wood, and
mountain, and valley, and stream; or rests, wondering
and admiring, on the bright delicate fabric of a flower,
the rich hues of the butterfly, or the lustrous plumage
of the birds, beauty and brightness is everywhere.
The air we breathe, too, is full of sweet sounds; wheth-
er in the singing of the birds, the murmuring music of
the stream, or the hum of all the insect world upon the
wing, everything is replete with harmony. But of all
the lovely sights, and of all the touching sounds where-
of nature is full, there is nothing so beautiful, there is
nothing so sweet, as the sight and the words of natural
affection.
Alice Herbert—for to her we must now turn—sat by
he bedside of her father on the morning of that day,
the eventful passing of which we have already com-
memorated in the last few chapters, as far as it affects
the greater part of the characters connected with this
tale. There was joy and brightness upon her counte-
nance; and in the small and beautiful hand that rested
on her lap she held open the packet of papers which had
been left for her by Langford. She gazed in the coun-
tenance of her father with a look of eager and gratified
affection, which gave to her lovely features a look of
additional loveliness, and added the crowning beauty to
the beauty of the whole. Her voice, too, sweet and
melodious as it always was, seemed at least to her fa-
..her's ears to have a more musical tone than ever, as she
told him, with a heart thrilling with joy and satisfaction
at having such news to tell, that she held in her hand
the means of freeing him from the painful situation into
which he had been plunged by the events of the night
before ; and that those means had been furnished to her
by him whom she so deeply loved.
The feelings of Sir Walter himself were also very

THE ROBBER. 159
sweet; they were sweet to receive such assistance from
a daughter's hand; they were sweet from perceiving
the happiness which to give that assistance afforded her;
they were sweet from the very act of appreciating all
her sensations; from the power of understanding and
estimating the ideas and feelings of her whom he loved
best on earth. They were sweet, but not wholly sweet.
There was a sensation mingled with them, as there
must almost always be with every enjoyment and de-
light of our mortal being, which tempered, if it did not
sadden; which took some little part off the brightness of
the joy. It may be that such slight deteriorations, that
such partial alloys thrown into the gold of happiness,
do, like the real alloys which render the precious metals
more fitted for the hand of the workmen, render our
pleasures more adapted to our state of being. At all
events, the slight shade of something less than happi-
ness which mingled with Sir Walter Herbert's feelings,
was not sufficient to do more than give them a deeper
interest. It was the thrill of a fine mind on receiving
a benefit. Pride had nothing to do with it; and yet,
when Alice Herbert showed him the various notes
and bills of exchange which she held in her hand, a
slight flush appeared upon his cheek, and a moment-
ary feeling of embarrassment came over him. He
would not, however, have let Alice perceive for the
world that he felt the least embarrassment; he struggled
against it, and conquered it in a moment.
“This is indeed generous and noble of Langford,” he
said. “This is like what I always supposed him; this
is like what I could desire and hope in him who is to
possess my Alice. But I must rise, Alice, my beloved.
I must rise and see him, and thank him £ I long
to tell him how I appreciate his good and noble charac-
ter, and to show him that I do so by seeking his advice,
assistance, and counsel in a situation to which some
carelessness and some want of wisdom, perhaps, have
brought my affairs, though I feel assured and am confi-
dent, Alice, as you tell me he himself said last night, that
matters are by no means so bad as the lawyer would
unkindly have us believe. Go down, my love, and have
the breakfast prepared; I will join you speedily.” . .
Alice did as he bade her, leaving the papers with him;
but, although her heart was very happy, she could have
much wished that Langford himself had not been absent.


## p. 160 (#162) ############################################

160 THE ROBBER,
She knew that a thousand causes of the simplest and
most natural kind might have taken him out at that early
hour of the morning; but yet there was a feeling of
apprehensiveness in her bosom which she did not at-
tempt to account for, but which, in reality, proceeded
from the agitation of the preceding evening; agitation
which had taken from her heart that feeling of security
in its own happiness which seldom, if ever, returns
when once scared away. The first great misfortune is
the breaking of a spell, the dissolving of that bright and
beautiful illusion in which our youth is enshrined, the
confidence of happiness; and there is no magic power
in after-life sufficient to give us back the charm again.
It may come in another world, but there it shall be a re-
ality, and not a dream.
Alice Herbert, then, felt apprehensive she knew not of
what; but in the silence of the old servants, and the
Solemn gloom that seemed to hang over them as they
laid out the morning meal, there was something which
increased her uneasiness. She asked herself why Wil-
son walked so slowly, why Halliday no longer bustled
about as usual, forgetting, for a moment, his reverence
for the ears of his master, in directing and scolding the
other servants if they went wrong : and though she ul-
timately concluded that they had all heard some report
of the difficulties into which her father had fallen, and
that such a report had rendered their affectionate hearts
sad, yet the conclusion did not altogether satisfy her;
and she longed both for Langford's return and for her
father's appearance at the breakfast-table.
Sir Walter did at length appear, but his first question
was for Langford, to which the servant Halliday an-
swered as he had been directed. The good knight
seemed perfectly satisfied, and, sitting down to table,
commenced his breakfast, talking to his daughter with
an air that showed that the slight embarrassment under
which he had first laboured was gone; that the despond-
ency which had been produced by the imperfect insight
into his affairs, given by the events of the preceding
'night, was passing away, and that hope and expectation
were beginning to brighten up and smile upon him once
In Ore.
Ere breakfast was over, however, the servant Halli-
day entered the room, and, approaching the end of the
table where his master sat, informed him that Gregorv

Myrtle, the landlord of the Talbot, desired instantly to
speak with him. .
“What does he want, Halliday !” demanded the
knight; “will not the good man’s business wait?”
“I believe not, your worship,” replied Halliday; “he
says it is a matter of much importance.”
“Well, then, send him in,” said Sir Walter; “he is
a good man and a merry one, and I will discuss the
matter with him while I finish my breakfast.”
Halliday looked at Alice, but he did not venture to
say anything, and, retiring from the room, he soon after
reappeared, ushering in the portly form of Gregory
Myrtle.
The worthy host of the Talbot, however, for once in
his life, had lost that radiant jocundity of expression
which his countenance usually bore; and the question
of Sir Walter was, “Why, how now, Master Gregory
Myrtle, what is the matter with thee, mine host? Thou
lookest as solemn and as much surprised as if thou
hadst seen a ghost on thy way hither. I hope nothing
has gone wrong with thee, good Gregory !”
“I have seen a sight, your worship,” replied the land-
lord, laying his hand upon the white apron which cov-
ered his stomach; “I have seen a sight which I never
thought to see, and which has made me as sad as any-
thing can make Gregory Myrtle. I have seen Master
Harry Langford taken away from mine house by two
magistrates on a charge of murder!” ...
Sir Walter gazed on him for a single instant with as-
tonishment, but then immediately turned towards his
daughter, forgetting all his own feelings in hers. Alice,
as pale as death, had sunk back in her chair, and was
covering her eyes with her hands, while she seemed to
gasp for breath under the agitation of the moment. Sir
Walter started up and approached her tenderly, while
Halliday ran from the other side of the room with wa-
ter. She put it away with her hand, however, saying,
“I shall be better in a moment! It was but the shock!
Go on, Master Myrtle !”
Sir Walter gazed tenderly on his child, but the colour
soon came into Alice's cheek, and she begged her father
not to attend to her, but to go on with the sad business
which had been so suddenly brought before him. Sir
Walter again sat down to the table, and, as his mind
turned from his daughter to the charge against one

whom she loved and whom he esteemed, surprise and
indignation superseded all other feelings, and the blood
mounted up into his cheek, while he demanded, “Of
#". pray, have they had the folly to accuse
im l”
“Folly, indeed, your worship,” replied Gregory Myr.
tle; “but they accuse him of having murdered Lord
Harold last night upon the moor.”
The blood again rushed rapidly through every vein
back to Alice Herbert's heart, and her fair hand clasped
almost convulsively the arm of the chair in which she
sat. Her father's heart had instantly directed his eye
towards her, and, rising from his seat, he went gently
up to her, and took her by the hand, saying, “Let me
help you to your room, dear child. I must make in-
quiries into this matter; but it is not a subject for your
ears, my Alice.”
“Yes, indeed,” she replied, making an effort for calm-
ness. “I have now heard the worst, my dear father,
and shall be anxious to know all the rest. If I were
away, I should be still more uneasy than I am here;
pray go on.”
“The charge is perfectly absurd" replied Sir Wal-
ter, returning to his chair. “No one that knows Lang-
ford can for a moment suspect him of committing any
crime. I will investigate the affair to the bottom, and,
of course, take care that he is not subject to the annoy-
ance of confinement any longer, my Alice. But go on,
Master Myrtle! What more?”
Alice listened eagerly to all the details which Gregory
Myrtle now gave, for her mind was not at all at ease in
regard to the real state of the case. Not that she ever
suspected Langford of having murdered the unhappy
Lord Harold; of course such an idea never entered her
mind; but she remembered that Langford had been ab-
sent the greater part of the preceding evening, and
even a portion of the night. She knew that he had
left her to see Lord Harold, whose feelings she doubt-
ed not were irritated and excited by what he had seen
take place between her and his rival; and she did fear
that Langford, notwithstanding the promise he had giv-
en her, might have been driven or tempted to draw
his sword under some strong provocation. She knew
that he had great powers of commanding himself; and
she believed that, even had such an occurrence taken

place, he would have been perfectly capable of conver-
sing with her over her father's affairs as he had done.
At the same time she recollected that—although ab-
sorbed by the situation of her father, and occupied by
her own feelings and sensations—she had remarked that
Langford was pale, thoughtful, and seemingly agitated
by emotions different from those which might be natu-
rally called forth by the subjects on which they spoke.
On the other hand, he had assured her that no en-
counter had taken place between him and Lord Harold,
and she did not think that, even to spare her feelings,
Langford would say anything that was not true; but
yet she thought that their meeting might have taken
place even after Langford had left her. She accounted
for his previous absence by supposing that he had gone
to seek some friend to act as his second upon the occa-
sion, and, in short, imagination found many a way of
justifying the apprehensions that love was prompt to
force. Under any ordinary circumstances, though she
might bitterly have regretted that one whom she loved
had stained his hand with the blood of a fellow-creature,
yet she would have entertained no apprehensions for his
safety in a mere affair of honour. But Alice had known
from her infancy the Earl of Danemore, and had formed,
almost without knowing it herself, an estimate of his
character, which was but too near the reality. There
was in it a remorselessness, a vehemence, a determina-
tion, an unscrupulous pursuit of his own purposes, which
had been apparent to her, even as a child. She knew
well, she felt perfectly convinced that he would halt
at no step, that he would hesitate at no means to be
avenged upon any one who had lifted a hand against his
son; and she was well aware, too, that Lord Danemore
united to his unscrupulous determination of character
talents and skill, which gave but too often the means
of accomplishing his purpose, however unjust.
Such knowledge and such feelings added deep appre-
hensions in regard to Langford's safety to the pain she
would at any time have felt at the idea of one she loved
taking the life of another human being; and the whole
was mingled with sincere grief to think that one who
had been her playmate in childhood, and who had loved
her truly in more mature years; one whom she esteemed
and felt for deeply, though she could not return his love,

nad been cut off in the spring of life, before many blos
soming virtues had yet borne fruit.
She listened eagerly, therefore, and anxiously to the
words of the good landlord of the Talbot, while he de-
tailed all those facts connected with the arrest of Lang-
ford which we have already dwelt upon. Her father,
indeed, felt and showed much more indignation and
surprise that the charge should be brought at all, than
apprehension lest it should prove just; and when from
some part of the conduct of the magistrates, as detailed
by the worthy landlord, it appeared that they accused
Langford of having slain Lord Harold in an unfair and
secret manner, Alice shared in the indignant feelings of
her father, and raised high her head at the very thought
of her noble, her generous, her gallant lover being sus-
pected of an unworthy act for a moment.
By the showing of Gregory Myrtle, it very speedily
appeared to Sir Walter and his daughter that the magis-
trates had not dealt quite impartially in taking or seek-
ing for evidence; and that they had shown a strong in-
clination to find out that Langford was really guilty.
From what Sir Walter knew of the character of one, if
not of both of those worthy gentlemen, he easily con-
ceived it to be possible that they should be somewhat
desirous of recommending themselves to Lord Dane-
more by an overstrained and excessive zeal in discov-
ering the murderer of his son. But when he heard that
the body of Lord Harold had not even been found, his
indignation grew still greater, and he sent back Gregory
Myrtle to the village, with directions to collect together
every one who could give any information on the sub-
ject, promising, as soon as his horses could be saddled,
to come over to the Talbot and investigate the matter
to the bottom.
“As soon as this is done, Alice,” he said, “I will ride
over to the castle, notwithstanding the painful event
that has occurred, discharge this long-standing debt to
my good Lord Danemore, who has thought fit to make
so unhandsome a use of it; and I will then insist upon
even justice being shown towards our noble friend Lang-
ford, who, I doubt not, can prove his innocence in five
minutes.”
The worthy knight hastened all his proceedings; for
when the cause of a friend was in his hands, none of
that easy and somewhat apathetic indifference displayed

itself with which he was but too apt to regard his own
affairs. His riding-boots were drawn on with speed,
and he twice asked for his horses before the grooms
could have had time to saddle them; nor had he for
many years before been known to ride so fast as he did
in going from the gates of his own park to the door of
the Talbot. Almost the whole population of the little
town was gathered about the inn, enjoying the satisfac-
tion of a legitimate subject of marvel and gossip; and
the glad and reverential smiles, the bows of unfeigned
respect, and the homely but affectionate greeting with
which they received the good knight as he rode up,
showed pleasingly how much beloved the virtues and
good qualities of all its members had rendered the fam
ily of the Manor.
Sir Walter, however, was detained at Moorhurst much
longer than he expected, for everybody was anxious to
give testimony before him, and many more crowded for-
ward than could afford any satisfactory information, or
throw the slightest light upon the case; and yet, as each
and all of them had something to say in favour of Lang-
ford, Sir Walter could not find it in his heart to refuse
to listen to any. The clerk of the parish was called
upon to take down their depositions; and certainly, if
having established a good character in a country town
could have besteaded any man in a similar case, it
might have done so with Langford in the present in-
Stance.
Sir Walter Herbert, however, did not lose sight of
the great object, though he suffered himself to be del-
aged by much irrelevant matter, and he soon found that
the only legitimate cause for supposing Langford at all
connected with the death or disappearance of Lord Har-
old was the fact of the half-witted man, John Graves,
having run down during the preceding evening and be-
sought several persons to come up and prevent Langford
and the young nobleman from killing each other. As
he was known to adhere invariably to the truth, two or
three of the townspeople had gone up with him into the
park in order to keep the peace; but, on finding all
quiet, and nobody there, had returned without further
search.
Sir Walter discovered also that the two magistrates
who had preceded him in the investigation had not even
demanded to see John Graves himself though his testi-

mony, taken second-hand, was that, in fact, on which the
whole case rested. This he determined immediately
to remedy; but the half-witted man was by that time
nowhere to be found; and though Sir Walter waited for
many hours while persons were despatched to seek for
him in all directions, the good knight was at length
obliged to give the matter up for the day, and return to
the Manor House.
During his absence Alice was left for several hours
with no companion but her own painful thoughts. She
felt, as she might well feel, quite sure that Langford was
innocent of any base, or cowardly, or treacherous ac-
tion; she felt sure of his honour, his integrity, his up-
rightness. But that certainty, that confidence, though it
gave her support, could not deliver her from apprehen-
sion. All her thoughts were gloomy. The bright joy
which Langford's acknowledgment of his love on the
preceding evening had afforded her, had been like one of
those sweet, warm, summer-like days in the unconfirm-
ed infancy of the year, which are succeeded immedi-
ately by storms and tempests. Her mind had rested for
a moment in a vision of perfect happiness; but now,
whichever way she turned her waking eyes, there was
something painful in the prospect. Although she was
very willing to believe that her father's pecuniary affairs
were not in near so bad a state as Lord Danemore's law-
yer had made them appear, yet there could be no doubt
that they were greatly embarrassed, and that his income
and resources were so much smaller than the rest of
his ancestors, that it would be a duty to curtail his ex-
penses, to diminish his establishment, and, in an age
when luxury and splendour were daily increasing, to fore-
go many of the conveniences and comforts which he
had hitherto enjoyed, and all that dignified but unosten-
tatious state which his family had kept up for many gen-
erations.
She knew, too, that to do so would be a bitter pang,
wellnigh to the breaking of the heart that felt it; and
Although, for her own part, there was scarcely a pretty
cottage in the neighbourhood in which she could not
have made her home with cheerfulness and happiness,
she looked forward with painful apprehension to the
time when her father might have to leave the Manor
House, and discharge the old servants who had served
him so long, and be no more what he had been among
the many who looked up to and reverenced him.

Such was one dark subject of contemplation: the
death of Lord Harold was another. She thought of
him as she had seen him the evening before, full of
youth, and health, and energy; she thought of him as
she had seen him in other days, full of joy and gayety,
and that bright exuberant life which it is difficult to
imagine can ever be extinguished when we gaze upon
it in all its activity and brightness; and yet a single
moment had put it out and ended it for ever.
Her mind then turned to the father of him who was
gone; and she pictured him sitting in his lonely halls,
childless, solitary, desolate, left without hope and with
out consolation to pass through the chill winter of his
age till he reached the dark and cheerless resting-place
of the tomb. She pitied him from her very heart; she
could have wept for him; but then her thoughts turned
to Langford, and she asked herself if it were possible
that a man, who had just suffered so severely as Lord
Danemore himself, could seek to bring misery and sor-
row upon others. Abstractedly she would have thought
such a thing impossible; but when she reflected upon
the character of the man, she felt but too deeply con-
vinced that his own misery would but make him seek
to render others as miserable; that his despair would
be bitter and turbulent, not calm and mild; and that to
- see the hearths of others desolate, the hearts of others
broken, would, in all probability, be the consolation he
would choose.
She was pondering sadly upon these gloomy subjects
of contemplation, as well as upon that chief and still
more absorbing one, the situation of him whom she so
dearly loved, when the servant Halliday appeared to
announce to her that Master Kinsight, Lord Danemore's
attorney, was at the gate, and would not go away. He
had told him, the servant said, that his worship was
out, and that she herself was busy, and not to be dis-
turbed; “but he still hangs there, Mistress Alice,” con-
tinued the man, “and he is no way civil; so much so,
indeed, that if I did not know his worship is averse to
having anybody cudgelled, I would drub him for his
pains.”
“Do no such thing, Halliday,” replied Alice, “but
bring him in here; I will speak to him myself.”
In a few minutes the lawyer entered the room, and
threw himself down into a chair with very little cere

mony. “So, Mistress Alice,” he said, in a tone, the
natural insolence of which was increased by the uncon-
cealed hatred of Sir Walter's servants, “I find your
father's out; gone out, I suppose, to avoid me, for he
knew I was coming about this time for his answer and
yours as to what we were speaking of last night.”
“My father has gone out, Master Kinsight,” replied
Alice, calmly, “upon business of importance; but I can
give you the answer that you require as well as if he
were present. He is going over to Danemore Castle
as soon as possible, to pay the money and interest which
you came to claim, having found the means of doing so
without any further delay.”
“Ay, indeed, madam !” exclaimed the lawyer, with
evident surprise, “indeed! Pray how !” -
“That, I should conceive, sir,” replied Alice, in the
same tone in which she had before spoken, “that, I
should conceive, is no business of yours.”
“Your pardon, madam, your pardon,” cried the law
yer, “it is business of mine. Your father must have
borrowed the money; and, to have borrowed the money,
he must have given security, and we hold mortgages over
his whole property to its full value, and therefore—”
As he paused and hesitated, Alice replied, “I do not
yet see, sir, how that would make it any business of
yours. However, to satisfy you, the money was lent
by my father's friend, Captain Langford, without any
security whatever.”
“Do you mean to say that the money was lent,” he
exclaimed, rudely, “actually lent, paid down? Come,
come, I shall not go out of the house till I hear more
of this matter, for I do not want to be trifled with, and
go and tell my lord that the money is ready when it is
not.” -
“Sir,” said Alice Herbert, raising her head with
a look of indignation, “you are insolent. The money
is, as I have told you, now in the house, ready to be
paid to your master—as I suppose I must call Lord
Danemore—whenever my father is at leisure to do so.
I expect him ere long, and, if you choose to remain till
he returns, you may wait in the servants' hall. At pres-
ent I myself am busy, and wish to be alone.”
The lawyer looked somewhat disconcerted; but he
paused thoughtfully for a moment, biting his lip, twirl-
ing his hat, and laying his finger on his brow, as if un-

:ertain what to do. At length he exclaimed, “No, no,
I’ll not wait; I'll go over to the earl directly, and take
instructions.”
So saying, he bade Alice a short and saucy adieu, and
left her presence and the house, not finding a servant
who would even show him the attention of holding his
horse while he mounted.

CHAPTER XV.
LIGHT and shade, the chief sources of all physical
beauty, may, and indeed must, have their effect in the
world of the mind; but though the eye may rest well
pleased upon deep shadows when relieved by bright
tights on the face of nature, the human heart, in the
picture of its own fate, unwillingly bears the darker por-
tion, more especially when it is contrasted closely with
the brighter. I fear that, like that famed English queen
who has obtained for herself so much good and so much
evil fame, we would always rather see the portrait
painted without shade.
For several weeks Henry Langford had enjoyed a de-
gree of happiness which he had never before known.
From the night in which he was wounded in defence of
Alice Herbert till the evening preceding the day on which
we last left him, had been a period full of sweet hopes
and new sensations, ending with the crowning joy of
all, the knowledge of loving and being beloved. That
period of bright light, however, had now been suddenly
contrasted with as deep a shadow as had ever fallen on
any part of his existence; and yet in the course of that
existence he had known some sorrows and some cares.
None, however, had touched him so deeply as this; for
"ow he was imprisoned, not in consequence of having
fallen into the power of a foreign enemy, taken in bat-
tle, and esteemed even while restrained, but accused of
a base and cowardly crime, separated from those he
loved best, placed in a situation from which it might be
difficult for him to extricate himself, and feeling more
deeply and painfully for the unhappy youth of whose
": #" accused than any one knew.

170 THE ROBBER.
Sitting in solitude and in silence, the remainder of
Henry Langford's day, after the half-witted man had
left him, passed over in gloom and anxious thought. It
was not that he yielded to despondency; it was not that
he suffered hope to extinguish her torch, or even to
shade its light for a moment. Knowing himself inno-
cent of the crime with which he was charged; knowing
that he possessed the love of Alice Herbert, and feeling
sure that that love would never alter, there was always
a balm for grief and anxiety. But still, even when he
thought of Alice Herbert herself; when he remembered
the situation of her father, and knew that any false
steps might plunge the worthy knight into irretrievable
ruin, he could not be without anxiety on that score
either; and, in fact, whichever way he turned his eyes,
there were clouds upon the horizon which threatened
to gather into a storm.
The treatment which he received from the Earl of
Danemore, indeed, was in all respects consolatory.
That nobleman, it was clear, hardly entertained any
suspicion of his having had a share in the murder of his
son. Several times in the course of the evening ser-
vants were sent to ascertain if he wanted anything.
The ordinary meals of the day were regularly set be-
fore him, and, when night fell, lights were brought, and
various kinds of fine wine were left in the room, suffi-
cient to satisfy him to the full if by chance he had ad-
dicted himself to the evil habit of deep drinking but too
common in those days.
Some short time after the lights had been brought
he heard a step approaching his room by the smaller
staircase, and the earl again appeared. The expression
of his countenance was agitated and anxious; but he
apologized courteously for intruding, and then added, “I
thought you might be pleased to learn that the whole
of Upwater Mere has been dragged with the utmost
care, without anything having been found to confirm my
apprehensions in regard to its having been made the re-
ceptacle of mv ooor son's bodv It is very foolish. un-
der sucn circumstances and w if such proofs of his
death that we nave, to give was a hope, but yet I can-
not help yielding a little to your reasoning of this morn-
ing.”
“I hope and trust, my lord,” replied Langford, “that
reasoning may not prove fallacious. Far be it from me

to wish to instil false hopes, but I would certainly, were
I you, not give myself up to despair till the truth of the
calamity is better ascertained.” *
“I know,” replied the earl, “that coincidences very
often happen, giving much unnecessary alarm. Indeed,
the story which you told this morning is an extraordi-
nary proof of the fact. I remember having heard it
before,” he added, in a careless tone, “though I forget
where it was. Pray where did the incident happen!”
Langford mused for a single moment, and then looked
up with something of a meaning smile. “It occurred,
my lord,” he replied, “in the Gulf of Florida, many.
years ago. I therefore do not know it from my own
personal knowledge; but I have heard it from one who
was present, and who told me the whole particulars of
that and many another adventure in those seas.”
It was now Lord Danemore's turn to muse, and he
did so with a cloudy brow, gnawing his nether lip as
if struggling with some powerful emotions. “Pray, do
you know the name of the captain of the ship !” he
asked at length, affecting the same careless tone with
which he had before spoken.
“Yes, my lord,” replied Langford, “I know his name
and his whole history from that time to the present
hour.”
Lord Danemore turned very pale, and then mused for
several minutes in silence. Nor was it unworthy of
remark that he did not demand the name of the captain
of the vessel, though the moment before he had seemed
so much interested in the subject. He remained gloomy
and silent, however, as we have said, knitting his brow
thoughtfully, and his first words were, though in so
low a tone that Langford did not hear them, “People
may know too much.”
Perceiving his lips move, and seeing that he was evi-
dently much affected by what had passed, Langford,
who had spoken with some degree of emphasis, added,
with apparent indifference, “Yes, oh yes; I know his
whole history well. He was an English gentleman of a
brave, daring, and enterprising disposition, who, having
been driven from his own country, and deprived for the
time of his own possessions, pursued a wild and fitful
course of life, now serving with gallant distinction in
the armies of foreign countries, now becoming a rover
on the high seas, and acquiring for himself a fearful and

redoubtable fame, till the restoration of the king sudden
ly recalled him to fortunes and honours in his own land."
Lord Danemore made no direct reply; but, putting him
hand to his head, he said, “It is very hot; I have sel-
dom known a more oppressive night.”
As he spoke the storm, which had long been coming
up, burst forth with a bright flash, which blazed with a
blue and ghastly light round the dark wainscoted cham
ber in which they sat, lighting up every cornice and
ornament in the carved oak, and seeming absolutely
to play amid the papers on the table. At that very un-
stant both Lord Danemore and Langford raised their
eyes each to the countenance of his companion, and
gazed upon each other with a firm and questivising
glance.
“That was a bright flash,” said the earl, with a lip
that curled slightly as he spoke; “I do not know that I
ever saw a brighter, except in the Gulf of Florida.”
He added nothing more, nor waited for any reply,
but rose as he spoke, and abruptly left the 10om. He
trod the stairs down to his own private apartments
with a heavy but irregular step, and paused at the bot-
ton: Ion several moments ere he opened the door which
gave entrance to his own dressing-room, thinking with
a gloomy brow and eyes bent steadfast, sightless, upon
the ground. At length he entered and cast himself into
a chair, clasping his strong bony hands firmly over each
ather; and oh! what a wild chaos of mingled feelings,
and strong passions, and memories, and regrets, and
dreads, and expectations, did his bosom at that moment
contain. He was one of those men in whom time, if
it have decayed some of the softer passions, has left
the more fierce and fiery ones as strong and wild as
ever; and it is certain that, where they dwell on in the
withering frame of age, they tear it more eagerly, they
rage with more unrestrained power.
All those passions were now called up in his bosom
and the struggle between them was the more tremen
dous, inasmuch as they were in many points arrayed
nearly equally against each other. Henry Langford
had in a few words laid before him the picture of his
life, and had shown a deep and intimate knowledge of
that darker part of his history which he had believed to
be buried in profound oblivion. For more than twenty
years he had heard no allusion to those days of wild and

THE ROBBER. 173
roving adventure when, driven forth, as he fancied, for
ever from his native land, stripped of his rank and his
possessions, he had given way to the impulses of a rash,
daring, and fierce spirit, had piled upon his own head
many a heavy remorse, and seared his own heart with
many a deed of evil. He had believed that all the com-
panions of those days were either gone or scattered far
from the high and lordly path in which he now trod;
he had imagined that he had removed every trace of that
bond of fate which united the proud, cold, wealthy Earl
of Danemore, the domineering spirit of the country
round, to the wild rover of the western seas, whose
deeds of daring and of blood were still remembered with
awe and fear in a land fertile of strong passions and
great crimes.
There were many who remembered him in exile, in-
deed, but in that part of his exile when his daring cour-
age and great powers had been employed in noble war-
fare and in an honourable cause; but he thought that
the very fact of being so remembered would be an ad-
ditional safeguard against all suspicion in regard to an-
other period. There was, indeed, a lapse of several
years in which his history was unknown to all such
companions of his brighter days; and he had more than
once been asked where he was when some great event
had happened on which the conversation at the moment
turned. But Lord Danemore was not a man to be in-
terrogated closely by any one; and, as we have said, he
firmly believed that all those who could have answered
such questions by pointing to the dark and evil events
which had been crowded into a few short years of his
life, were far removed, plunged beneath the rolling waves
of the ocean, buried upon the sandy beach of distant
lands, or with their bones whitening—a public specta-
cle—in the sun.
Now, however, suddenly, after a long and sunshiny
lapse of peaceful years, the memories of former acts
were recalled when he least expected them; recalled
by one who seemed to have a perfect knowledge of
every fact he could have desired to hide; and the dark
train of images conjured up from the past; the regret,
the remorse, the shame, which he had banished long
and carefully, were now linked hand in hand with ap-
prehensions for the future, with the fear of exposure,
if not the dread of punishment. His mind, however,

was in no unfit state for receiving gloomy impressions,
his heart was already excited for the entertainment of
fierce and angry passions. Through the whole of that
day, from a very early hour in the morning, he had been
torn with grief and anger, now mourning over the loss.
of his son with the deep anguish of wounded affection,
now vowing vengeance against that son's murderer,
while his heart felt scorched and seared by the burning
thirst for revenge.
Disappointment, too, deep and bitter disappointment
had had its share; the disappointment of a proud and
ambitious heart. On the son now lost he had fixed all
his hopes and all his aspirations; in him had he trusted
to see his life prolonged; through him had he expected
that future generations would carry on his name with
increasing wealth and greatness. Now all was over;
the son on whom he had relied was gone; he was child-
less, lonely, cut off from hope and expectations, to live
dark, solitary, through the chill autumnal twilight of his
age, and then to die, leaving all the vast possessions
which he had obtained to a distant kinsman whom he
hated and despised.
Such had been, in some degree, the state of his feel-
ings, so shaken, so agitated, when he suddenly found
that shame was likely to be added to the other burdens
cast upon him, and that the vice and crimes of other
years were rising up in judgment against him even at
the latest hour. The drop thus cast in was sufficient to
make the cup overflow. Never through life had he been
accustomed to put any restraint upon the fierce passions
of his heart, and now what was there that could act as
any check upon them?, what was there to prevent him
from seeking their gratification? what was there to op-
pose in any degree the desire which instantly sprang
up within his heart, of silencing for ever the voice which
might tell the dark secrets of other years? -
Nevertheless there was a check, nevertheless there
was something that opposed him in the fiery course he
might otherwise have pursued; ay, and opposed him
strongly, though it was but a feeling connected with
other years, though it was but one of those strange as-
sociations between the present and the past which often
have a firmer hold upon us than more immediate inter-
ests or affections. There was something in Langford's
face, there was something in his manner and whole ap-

THE ROBBER. 175
pearance, there was something in the very tone of his
voice, rich, and musical, and harmonious, which called
up as forcibly to his mind a period of sweet, and early,
and happy days, as the tale he had told brought over
the glass of memory the dark and awful features of an-
other epoch.
At the sound of that voice, at the glance of that eye,
the forms of many bright, and dear, and beloved, many
who had been known and esteemed in times of inno-
cence and of happiness, rose up as clear before him as
if some magic wand had waved over the dark past, and
brought out of the dim masses of things irrecoverably gone
the images of the dead clothed in all the semblance of
life and reality. The associations thus raised up were
all sweet; and, in regard to him who called them up,
there was a strange feeling of tenderness, of affection,
and of interest, which at the very first sight had made
him feel confident that that man could never have been
the murderer of his son; that he who seemed connected
with the brightest portion of his early life could never
be one to render the latter part of his existence all dark
and desolate.
Then, again, when he remembered that the same man
held in his possession the great terrible secret of his
former deeds, all his feelings and his thoughts were
changed, and sensations almost approaching to despair
came over him; a stern, dark, eager resolution, akin to
those fierce determinations and sensations which had
filled up that portion of his being to which his thoughts
were so suddenly directed.
He sat then and gazed upon the ground, with his hands
clasped over each other, and twice he murmured to
himself, “People may know too much.” He pondered
upon every word that had been spoken, and for nearly
half an hour his thoughts wandered with a vague un-
certain rambling over the various epochs of the gone,
connecting them with the present, and then turning
again and again towards the past, while anguish and
pleasure were still strangely mingled in the retrospect.
Still, however, when he remembered the words of Lang-
ford, and felt himself to a certain degree in his power,
the same dark but ill-defined purpose returned of re-
moving for ever from his path one who held so dan-
gerous a tie upon him. He felt, indeed, a reluctance, a
hesitation, a doubt, which he somewhat scorned himself

176 The ROBBER.
for feeling; and he nerved his mind more and more
every moment to execute his determination calmly and
deliberately. “I will never live in the fear of any mor-
tal man,” he thought. “Were he ten times as like,
he should not bear my fate about with him How,
shall he be my only consideration ? Surely I am not
become either a child or a woman, to waver in such a
case as this.” -
As he thus thought, he rose from his seat and strode
up and down the room with his arms folded on his chest.
Over the large and massy mantelpiece of many-col-
oured marbles hung a number of weapons of different
kinds; pistols, and swords, and firelocks, and daggers,
some of foreign and some of British manufacture.
There appeared the long Toledo blade, the broad Turk-
ish dagger, the Italian stiletto, the no-longer-used match-
lock, and many another weapon, arranged in fanciful
devices; and each time as the earl turned up and down
the room he paused and gazed upon them, then bit his
lips, and recommenced his course across the chamber.
When this had proceeded for about a quarter of an hour,
some one knocked at the door, and he started sharply
as if caught in some evil act. The next moment, how-
ever, he called to the person without to come in, speak-
ing in an angry tone; and a servant, who, from his dress
and appearance, seemed to be his own particular valet,
appeared, announcing that Mr. Kinsight the lawyer had
just arrived on important business.
“I am glad of it,” said the earl; “take him to the li-
brary; I will come directly.” And, as soon as the ser-
vant was gone, he added, “This man may be of some
use.”
He then carefully locked the door, which led from
his dressing-room to the room which had been assigned
to Langford, and descended to the library to confer with
an agent worthy of his purposes.

stons, when Langford was visited by the person who,
more than any one in that house or neighbourhood,
seemed to know his history and understand his situation.
Mistress Bertha, as she was called, came ostensibly in
her character of housekeeper to ask if there were any-
thing to be done for the promotion of his comfort; say-
ing that she had been so commanded in the morning by
the earl. She lingered, however, after she had re-
ceived his answer, though for some minutes she scarcely
spoke; and when she did she merely uttered a com-
ment on the storm that was raging without. Langford
seemed to understand her character well, and he too
kept silence, leaving her to say anything that she might
desire to say, in her own manner and at her own time.
“It is an awful night,” she said; “an awful night, in-
deed. It is such a night as the spirits of bad men should
depart in. I never pass such a night without thinking
there is a likeness between it and the dark stormy heart
of the wicked. But it matters not,” she added, after a
long thoughtful pause. “I have linked myself to his
fate, and I must not sever the bond. He is my master,
and has been good to me, though he may have wronged
others. I will remain by his side.”
She paused again, and Langford merely replied, “It
were too late now to think of it.”
“I understand your meaning,” she said, “and it is too
late. You would say that in former times I ought to
have adhered to the wronged and the oppressed, and so
I would, but I was driven from them. It is needless
now, however,” she continued; “it is needless to say
one word more on that score; let us talk of other things.
Has he been with you again?” -
“He has scarcely left me a moment,” replied Lang-
ford; “and I fear with less friendly feeling towards me
than when we met before. I showed him that I knew
much of his former life; for, in truth, good Bertha, the
blow must be struck now or never.”
“It must, it must !” she replied, “but not too rapidly.
Becautious, be careful. After he left you this morning
I was with him long, and his feelings were all such as
you could have hoped for. What had passed between
you I know not; but there was a softness, a tenderness
had come over him: a light as from other days seemed
to shine into his heart, and to flash upon affections and
feelings long buried in darkness." He spoke to me of

things he has not spoken of for many a year; he used
words and he named names that I never thought .o
hear him utter again. The sight of you seemed to form
an eddy in the current of time which carried him back
to a happier and brighter part of its course. Be care-
ful, however. Be careful how you deal with him. If
you act well and wisely, ere the drops are dried up
which are now falling from the clouds, you may tell him
all, you may ask him all. But I know him well; and
one rash word, one hasty act, may undo your fortunes
at the very moment they are wellnigh built up.”
“I will be careful,” replied Langford; “I will be care-
ful, because I am bound by every tie to use all gentle
means rather than harsh ones. But still it is hard com-
pletely to restrain one's self, and to seek with softness
and concession that which is wrongly withheld, and
which I have every right to demand with the loud voice
of justice.”
“To demand and not obtain,” replied Bertha; “for
there is no means by which you can gain your purpose
except by gentleness.”
Langford smiled. “Be not quite sure of that,” he
said. “I have at this moment my fate in my own
power.”
“Indeed!” she exclaimed; “indeed! how so?”
“It matters not,” Langford replied; “be assured I
have; but, as I have said, I am bound by every consid-
eration to use gentle means. If I find that they will
succeed, I will employ none other; but, should they fail,
I will boldly and openly assert my own rights, and both
claim and take that which is my own.”
Bertha's eye, while he spoke, fixed upon one of those
small doors in the wainscoting which we have more
than once mentioned, and she shook her head with an
incredulous smile. “Because,” she said, answering his
thoughts more than his words, “because I have placed
you here, and because there is between you and what
you desire but one small partition. That partition is of
iron, which, had you a thousandfold the strength you
possess, you could never break through.”
“I know it,” replied Langford, “I know it well; but
yet I tell you that in those respects my fate is in my
own power. However, I will use all gentle means,
# no subtlety; but in the end I will do myself
right.”

“Be it as you be.,,” she answered; “but of one thing
seware. It seems hat you have rekindled in his bosom
a hope of his son Edward being still living. Avoid
that: the boy is dead beyond all doubt; struck down,
poor fellow ! in his pride of life; broken off in his dear-
est dream of happiness and love. He would have lived
but to deeper grief; he would have remained but for
greater anguish. Give the father no hope ! For your
own sake, give him no hope that the boy is still alive!”
“But I entertained hope myself,” replied Langford;
“and it was not in my nature, Bertha, to see a father
grieving for the death of his son, and not try to afford
him what consolation I could.”
She shook her head mournfully, adding, “He is dead.
I feel that his fate is accomplished. He could not live.
He had no right to live. The date is out. He is taken
away. But I must stay with you no longer; yet, in
leaving you, remember my words: use none but gentle
means ! Urge him alone by the kinder feelings of his
nature; for if ever there was a man in whom there
dwelt at once two strong spirits, powerful for good and
powerful for evil, it is he.” -
“I will remember your advice,” replied Langford,
“and thank you for it. I will use gentle means; but,
by one means or another, right shall be done.”
She lingered for another moment or two, as if desi-
rous of saying more, but then turned and left him; and,
proceeding down the staircase into the hall, she en-
countered the lawyer just alighted from his horse.
The man of law bowed low and reverentially to one
whom he knew to possess great influence over his pa-
tron; and, more for something to say than on any other
account, added to the usual salutation of good-evening,
“It is a terrible night, Mistress Bertha; a good soaked
posset now were not amiss to warm one.”
She looked upon him, however, with cold and mo-
tionless features, merely replying in an under voice, as
she passed on, “The time will come, I rather think,
when you will be glad of something to cool instead of
to warm you.”
The lawyer must have caught the meaning of what
she said, as well as the servant who was conducting
him; for a well-satisfied smile came upon the face of
the latter, while the attorney shrugged his shoulders
and said aloud, “She is a rare virago.”

He was conducted by the servant into the library of
the castle, where, against the wide and lofty walls and
round the massive pillars that supported the roof, were
ranged in due order a vast number of dusty volumes,
containing the wisdom, and the learning, and the folly,
and the dulness of many preceding ages. Lights were
placed upon the table; and, after waiting for a few min-
utes, gazing upon the ponderous tomes around him,
without, however, venturing to disturb any of them by
taking them from their places of long repose, he was
joined by the earl, on whose strong-marked countenance
the keen and practised eye of the lawyer recognised at
once the traces of strong emotion.
Deep and reverential was the bow with which the
earl was greeted by the same man who had so lately
treated Alice Herbert and her father with contempt
and indignity. He remained standing, though the earl
had seated himself, and even then did not sit down till
he had been twice told to do so. The earl, at the same
time, would gladly have had the lawyer abate so much
of his respect as to commence the conversation him-
self; for the nobleman’s mind was full of dark purposes
and stormy passions, and he wished them to be led forth
by degrees, lest the fierce crowd, in rushing out too
hastily, should throw open the innermost secrets of his
heart to a stranger. The lawyer, however, did not ven-
ture to do so, being rather overawed than otherwise by
the state of agitation in which he beheld his noble cli-
ent; and the earl, putting a restraint upon his words to
prevent himself from hurrying forward to the subject of
his thoughts at once, began the conversation by saying,
“This is a stormy night, sir. What business, may I
ask, is it that has brought you hither at such an hour
and in this weather?”
The lawyer, though he had gained no small knowl-
edge of the world by long dealings with every different
class of men, and by seeing them under every different
circumstance and affection, was, nevertheless, embar-
rassed in regard to his demeanour towards Lord Dane-
more, situated as he knew him to be at that moment.
He had expected to find him, as he did find him, deeply
agitated; but the agitation which he had imagined he
should behold was bitter grief for the death of his son.
Now there was something in the aspect of the peer
which made him see at once that many other feelings

THE ROBBER. - 181
were mingled with his sorrow; and as he did not know
what those feelings were, and desired solely so to shape
his whole conduct as to make it agreeable to his pa
tron, he was excessively anxious to discover, by some
means, what was going on in the earl's breast, in order
to direct his course accordingly.
Finding, however, that he was not able to make such
discoveries, he judged it the best plan to throw before
the earl the subject farthest removed from the death of
his son; and to counterbalance grief by exciting anger
He replied, therefore, after a moment's thought, “No-
thing but important business, my lord, would have in-
duced me to intrude upon you at such a moment. Your
lordship, however, will recollect that you gave me your
commands to proceed in a certain manner in regard to
the old knight at Moorhurst, in which, I am sorry to
say, I have been frustrated by a most unexpected inci-
dent.”
“Frustrated, sir!” exclaimed the earl, the whole of
whose passions were in too excited a state not to take
fire at every new obstacle cast in his way. “Frus-
trated ! By all the powers of Heaven, I will not be
frustrated! What? do you mean to tell me that there
is any flaw in the bond, any error in the transaction,
which will debar me of my right? If so, look to your-
self, sir; for you drew up the whole. Or would you
have me believe that he has money to discharge the
debt? I tell you, sir, he is a beggar; he is ruined, un-
done, as you well know. What is the meaning of all
this? Frustrated shall he frustrate me?” and he end-
ed with a scoff of angry derision.
“It is for the purpose of preventing it, my lord,” re-
plied the lawyer, meekly, “that I came hither to-night.
I wished to lay the case before you, and take your
lordship's commands.”
“Well, sir, well,” rejoined the earl, recovering from
the first burst of passion, “tell me the facts that I may
judge.”
From not knowing the new matter which had been
cast into the fiery furnace of the earl's bosom, the law-
yer was more and more puzzled at his demeanour every
moment. He saw that there was an under-current of
feelings running more rapidly than the natural course
of those excited by the matter on which they spoke.
And, in order to fathom his mind and ascertain of why,
a

feelings that under-current was composed, he resolved
to throwin, even unnecessarily, the name of Lord Harold,
and he answered, “The facts are these, my lord: after
seeing you yesterday, and taking precise instructions
from you as to the course I was to pursue, I went over
to Moorhurst, where I found your lordship's lamented
Son.”
As he spoke a dark cloud came over the countenance
of the earl, but it was of a different kind and character
from that which had hung upon his brow before; and the
lawyer, at once perceiving that he had not found the
right road, instantly turned to the straightforward path,
finding that he must take his chance of going right or
wrong in a country where there was no fingerpost to
direct him. “I was in some apprehension,” he contin-
ued, “lest his generosity might step in to interfere with
your lordship's just views and purposes.”
“Speak not of my son, sir,” said the earl, sternly; .
“speak not of my son; for although, now that the first
anguish is past, I have conquered the quivering of my
wounded heart, and the flesh is still, yet I love not that
any one should lay his finger on the spot, unless it be a
surgeon to heal the injury. Go on with the matter in
hand. What said Sir Walter Herbert 1”
“Why he said, my lord, that he could not pay the
money,” replied the lawyer; “and he fell into a great
state of agitation, and would not believe that his affairs
were so bad till I showed him that they could hardly
be worse; and then Mistress Alice was sent for, and, I
must say, never were such airs as the young woman
gave herself.”
“The young lady, sir!” said the earl, sternly; “you
forget yourself. The person whom I considered meet
to be the bride of my son may well merit her proper
name from a low person like yourself.”
The attorney was not without the natural feelings of
humanity, and he did not fail to experience all those sen-
sations which, in other circumstances, induce one man
to knock down another. But the effect of our feelings,
when prevented from operating in their natural direc-
tion, is often, by their recoil, to drive us in a way direct-
ly contrary. Though the lawyer then would have given
a great deal to have repelled the insulting language of
Lord Danemore, yet he would not have given for that
purpose the hundredth part of the advantage which he

derived from his patronage and employment; and this
being the case, it always happened that the more rude
and overbearing the peer showed himself to be in his
demeanour towards the lawyer, the more servile and
humble became the lawyer towards the peer.
In the present instance he begged his lordship's par-
don a thousand times, but excused himself on the plea
that the conduct of Mistress Alice, her expressions re-
garding his lordship himself, had been so bold and
haughty, that his indignation got the better of his man-
nerS.
“However, my lord,” he continued, “she agreed at
once to give up the pittance that she possesses for the
relief of her father; but still the plate, and the jewels,
and all the rest would have to be sold to make up the sum
required. I doubt if even that would do, and he would
certainly be obliged to go out of the house, and be re-
duced nearly to a state of beggary.”
There was a degree of satisfaction apparent in the
countenance of the earl which made the lawyer stop to
let it work, and he watched every shade of expression
that passed over the face of Lord Danemore, as he gazed
with a curling lip upon the ground. With a sudden start,
however, the peer raised his eyes to the countenance of
the lawyer, and beheld there, reading it in a moment as
a familiar book, all that was passing in his agent's mind.
“You are right, sir,” he said, going boldly and at once
to the subject of the lawyer's thoughts; “I do hate that
man; and, if you think that you have made a discov-
ery, you deceive yourself, for there is nothing to con-
ceal. Other men hate their neighbours as well as I,
and I see not wherefore I should not have my own pri-
vate enmities and gratify them like others. He is one
of those good honest people whom the world delight to
praise, and the vulgar love and honour. He sets him-
self up for modest simplicity, and yet affects a state and
station which he has not the means to maintain. He
is one of your positive lovers of right, too, yielding but
formal respect to his superiors, but denying them all au-
thority in matters of importance. In times long gone,
when first I returned after the restoration, I met with
more difficulty and opposition in establishing my just
rights and influence over the tenantry and people in the
neighbourhood from that mild, justice-fancying, learn-
ing-loving Sir Walter Herbert, than from all the other

petty squires and magistrates in the county. If it had
not been for the love that my poor boy entertained for
him and for his daughter, I would have swept him from
my path long ago; but go on, go on with your tale.
What obstacle has since arisen!”
“Why, last night, my lord,” replied the lawyer, “I
left all matters in as fair a train as well might be. The
old man had become as pale as ashes, and the young
lady, notwithstanding all her pride, had more than once
wept bitterly. I gave them till this morning to make
up their minds as to how they would act; but, when I
went thither about two or three hours ago, I found the
old knight from home, and my young mistress with her
pride and haughtiness all in fresh bloom again. The
end of the matter is, my lord, that it seems a friend has
been found foolish enough to advance the money with-
out any security whatsoever. A Captain Langford,
whom I never before heard of.”
“Who who ' demanded the earl.
The lawyer repeated the name; and his noble com-
panion, starting up, struck the table a blow with his
clinched hand which made the lights dance and flicker
as they stood. “This is too much,” he said; “this is
too much: I know now where I must aim.”
The lawyer had risen at the same time as the peer,
and Lord Danemore, striding across towards him, grasp-
ed him firmly by the arm, saying, in a low voice, “That
very man, that very Langford, is now in this house, hav-
ing been brought hither by those two foolish justices,
Sir Thomas Waller and Sir Matthew Scrope, on charge
of being the murderer of my son.”
The lawyer, forgetting one half of the awful circum-
stances of the moment, rubbed his hands with a look of
satisfaction. “That will just do, my lord; that will just
do!” he exclaimed. “If we can get any proof whatso-
ever that the money is furnished by this Langford, we
will, when it is tendered, which will doubtless be the
case to-morrow, seize upon it as the property of a fel-
on, and then proceed against Sir Walter as if he had
never had it. Long ere this Langford comes to be tried,
by one means or another we can lay the old man by the
heels in jail, and then, what by one process or another,
mount him up such an expense at law as will leave him
scarcely a coat to his back.”
The earl smiled, partly with satisfaction at the ready
_-

means of gratification which had been found for him in
one instance, and partly with contemptuous insight into
the workings of the lawyer's mind, feeling that degree
of pleasant scorn with which the more powerful but
not less evil minds regard the minor operations of the
tools they work with in the accomplishment of evil pur-
poses. The lawyer remarked the expression, and fan-
cied that it was well-pleased admiration of his skill and
readiness; and again he rubbed his hands, and chuckle
with conceit and pleasure. -
The earl, however, waved his hand somewhat stern-
ly. “Cease, cease,” he said, “I can have no laughter
here ! This house is a house of mourning and of ven-
geance. We will have no laughter! Your idea is a
good one, and you shall be rewarded if the execution
answers to the conception. But there is more to be
done; there are still greater things to be accomplish-
ed; things that are painful to me, but which yet I must
do; things I shall remember and regret, but which yet
I will not shrink from.”
As he spoke there came over the strong stern fea-
tures of the old man's face a dark and awful expression,
which made even the lawyer shrink and draw back, ac-
customed as he was to see human passions in all their
direst forms. It was the expression, the irrepressible
expression of a powerful mind deliberately summoning
all its energies to the commission of a crime known, ap-
preciated, and abhorred. The evident effect produced
upon the lawyer seemed in some degree to affect his
patron, who, ere he spoke further, took two or three
gloomy turns up and down the room, and then again
drawing near him, said, “But this Langford; what is
to be done with Langford? He remains to be dealt
With.”
The lawyer gazed in the earl’s countenance, doubting
in his own mind what he meant; and imagining that
the very fact of having aided Sir Walter Herbert was
so great a crime in the eyes of the earl as to call down
his vengeance as remorselessly upon the one as upon
the other. It was a pitch of vindictiveness at which
- even his mind was staggered, and he said with some
embarrassment, “But, my lord, from what your lord-
ship said just now of those two justices, I fancied you
thought the gentleman not guilty.”
The earl gazed upon him£"y for so long that
2 -

the lawyer shrunk beneath his eyes. He answered de-
liberately, “I do not think him guilty, but yet I would
prove him so.” -
“But, my lord,” stammered the lawyer, “my lord, if
the man be innocent! I dare say he did not know he
would offend your lordship by helping Sir Walter, other-
wise—”
“Hush!” exclaimed the earl. “It is no such piti-
ful motive as that which moves me. I have other
reasons for my actions, other causes for my determi-
nation. Whether the man murdered my son or not is
of little import in this question. Hearken to me, my
good friend; he must be swept from my path. I have
strong and sufficient causes for wishing him hence. He
and I cannot live long in the same world together !”
“Good God! my lord,” replied the lawyer, “this is
very terrible. I really know not how to act or what
to think.” -
“Think,” said the peel “that if by your means 1
succeed in this business, if by your zeal for myself
and my family you convict this man of the murder of
my son, wealth and distinction shall be yours for the
rest of your life; but if you do not—” -
“But, my lord,” said the lawyer, presuming upon
the situation in which they were placed so far as to in-
terrupt the earl, “these are great and terrible things;
and if I undertake to accomplish that which your lord-
ship wishes, I must have my reward made sure to me.
We do not do such things without reward nor with any
uncertainty.”
Lord Danemore now felt, by the bold tone assumed
by his subservient tool, a part of the bitterness of wrong
action; but he was prepared for that also, and he re-
plied at once, “You are bold, sir, to speak to me in such
a manner; but I understand your meaning, and I have
a hold upon you yet. We are here alone with no one
to witness our conversation; you, therefore, judge that
I may promise and not perform. But that same exclu-
on of all witnesses is my security. if not yours; and H
now tell you, that if you do not accomplish that which I
command, I will withdraw from your hands all those
sources of emolument you now enjoy from me; and I
will keep this promise in the one case as surely as I
will keep the other in the other case. Make me no re-

ply now ; I give you half an hour to determine, and wi'
return to you at the end of that time.”
The earl turned and walked towards the door, but, be
fore he had reached it, the lawyer raised his voice, say-
ing, “My lord, my lord! Do not go! I have deter-
mined ! What you wish shall be done at all risks, and I
will trust to your lordship's promise fully. Only name
what is to be my reward!”
The earl smiled with a dark and bitter smile while
he replied deliberately, “The sum which shall be ten-
dered me to-morrow by Sir Walter Herbert.”
“Enough, enough, my lord,” said the lawyer, “it shall
be done.”
The earl turned and came back to the table. “You
understand,” he said, “the money shall be yours—when
he is dead.”
The lawyer was very pale as well as his patron, but
he answered distinctly, “I do understand, my lord!”
As he spoke, a sudden flash of the lightning glared upon
the countenance of each. That of the peer was stern,
calm, and determined; that of the lawyer was quivering
under a fearful degree of emotion; but what is singular,
though the storm had been proceeding during the whole
time they were together, so fierce had been the struggle
in the bosom of each, that neither had noticed the strife
of the elements without. The moment, however, that
the fearful words had passed, that the dark determina-
tion was taken, both remarked the flash and heard the
peal of thunder that followed. They were neither of
them men to shrink at portents; and though the thun-
der made the lawyer start, it seemed to both but a con-
firmation of their compact.
“It is a tremendous night,” said the earl; ‘you must
sleep here, my good friend.”
The lawyer muttered forth some few words of thanks
and withdrew, but sleep visited not that night the soft
pillow on which he laid his head.

188. THE ROBBER.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE storm of the preceding night had ceased, and
left the earth all glittering with golden drops, when the
sun rose up and poured the full tide of his glorious light
upon that world where, during his absence, so many
dark and fearful Scenes had been enacted. About nine
o'clock, and along a tortuous and unscientific road—
which seemed to have been cut solely with a view of
mingling the bright sunshine and the cool green shades
amid the pleasant woods through which it wandered—
rode along Alice Herbert and her father. Their thoughts
were full of matter of deep moment: cares, fears, anx-
ieties, were busy in their bosoms; but yet it were false
to say that the sweet scenes through which their way
was laid, the cheerful aspect of the summer world, the
voice of the blackbird and the lark, the soft calm air of
the bright morning, did not soften and sooth their feel-
ings. It is not alone that in the breast of almost every
one there goes on a sort of silent superstition, drawing
auguries almost unknown to ourselves from every vary-
ing feature of the scenes through which we are led,
finding the frowning look of boding fate upon the sky
when the dark clouds roll over it, or the bright smile of
hope when it spreads out clear and bright above us; but
it is that there are mysterious links of harmony between
all our feelings and the universal creations of our God;
and that the fine electric chain, along which so many
strange and thrilling vibrations run, is carried from the
heart of man to the uttermost verge of heaven.
The brightness of the morning sunk into Alice's soul,
and soothed the painful memories within her; the easy
motion, too, of her light jennet, as he cantered untiringly
forward through the fresh early air, had something in it
inspiring and gladsome. He went along with her as if
there were no such things as obstacles or barriers in 2\\
life's road, as if all things were smooth and easy as his
own soft pace. Sir Walter, too, felt the same; he was
peculiarly susceptible to the impressions of external na-
ture, and readily yielded his whole heart to the bright
influence of everything fine and beautiful throughout the

range of creation. Though in early life he had mingled
with many scenes of active strife and endeavour, his
heart was all unused and fresh, and retained all the ca-
pabilities of enjoyment which bless our ear": years.
He too, therefore, felt his heart lighter, and the fount-
ain of hope welling up anew within him from the glad-
some aspect of the morning; and as he rode on with
his daughter, followed by two or three servants on
horseback, he conversed cheerfully and happily over
coming events, and spoke of Langford being immediately
set free, of his own affairs restored to order and abun-
dance, and of the happiness of all parties being secured,
as if he had held in his hands the keys of fate, and could
open the storehouses of Fortune, to bring forth what
pleasure he pleased for after years.
He spoke, too, without any animosity of the Earl of
Danemore and of his proceedings towards him; and
Alice, on her part, was enchanted to hear him do so, for
she had feared, from the tone of her father's feelings on
the day before, that, either in regard to his own affairs or
to those of Henry Langford, some sharp collision would
take place between him and the earl on the first occa-
sion of their meeting. It was partly on that account
that, when Sir Walter had announced his intention of
going over in person to the castle, both to discharge
the debt to Lord Danemore, to lay before him the evi-
dence which he had procured concerning Langford, and
to request him to set the latter at liberty, she had be-
sought him, in terms which her father could not resist,
to take her with him.
“The proceeding will seem strange,” she said; “but
I do not think Lord Danemore is a man that will think
it so. He has shown me much kindness, and I should
wish to see him and condole with him under his pres-
ent grief, both because I do sincerely feel for him, and
because I wish him to know that any grief or disap-.
pointment I may have occasioned his poor son was not
mingled with any unkindness of feeling on my part, any
lightness of conduct, or any wish to inflict a wound.
He has no one near him to console him or to comfort
him; we are the only people he has at all associated
with, and I used to think that he was fond of my socie-
‘ty, and would hear things from me which he would lis-
ten to from no one else.”
His daughter's arguments were almost always good

to the mind of Sir Walter Herbert ; and even if he did
understand that she was afraid he might become some-
what over vehement with the proud and passionate man
he was about to see, his was one of those kindly na-
tures, free from that irritable vanity which is jealous of
all interference; and he suffered his daughter to have
her way, because he knew that her motive was good
and felt that he as well as another might fall into error.
Thus they rode on ; and, as they went, Sir Walter
himself found a thousand excuses for the conduct of
the earl; showed Alice how, in that nobleman's seem-
ing want of liberality towards himself, fatherly pride,
wounded by the rejection of his son, might have the
greatest share; and how, in the detention of Langford,
the magistrates who had arrested him were most to
blame, while it was natural that a father's heart, torn
and wrung as his must be, should make him regard
mere suspicion as direct proof, and suffer his eager de
sire for vengeance to blind his eyes to the real object.
Judging from such expressions, Alice now felt little
doubt that her father's first interview with the earl would
pass over tranquilly ; and having no longer the strong
motive which had, at first, induced her to cast off a cer-
tain feeling of timid shyness which she experienced in
regard to seeing Lord Danemore for the first time after
all that had taken place between herself and his son,
she proposed to remain for a time with Mistress Bertha,
the housekeeper, and not to see the earl till after the
business on which Sir Walter went was concluded.
“Perhaps it may be better, my love,” replied Sir Wal-
ter, “although I never liked that woman, who is as stern
and harsh a being, I think, as ever was created. Yet she
was always fond of you, Alice: and, in regard to my con-
versation with the earl, put your mind at rest: I am too
sorry for him at the present moment to let any degree
of anger rest in my bosom, or to suffer anything that he
can say, knowing as I do the violence of his nature, to
make me forget for one moment that he is a father
mourning for the unexpected loss of his only son.”
Their plans being thus arranged, Sir Walter announced
to the porter of Danemore Castle that his daughter
would remain with Mistress Bertha, while he craved
audience with the earl on important business.
There was something in the demeanour of Sir Walter
Herbert which even the insolent servants of Lord Dane-

more could not resist : there was the mingling of cour-
tesy and dignity, the conscious right to command, but
that right, waived for kindness' sake, which is sure to
win respect even from those the most unwilling to pay
it. The worthy knight and his daughter then were
shown, with some degree of ceremony, into one of the
large, cold, stately saloons of the castle, while the ser-
vant proceeded to announce their coming to his master.
He returned in a few minutes, saying that the earl would
join Sir Walter there ere long, and that, in the mean
time, he would conduct the young lady to Mistress Ber-
tha's room. -
She had not been long gone when Sir Walter was
joined by the earl, who was followed into the room by
the lawyer, hanging his head and bending his back, like
a sulky dog trudging at its master's heels. Lord Dane-
more received Sir Walter with stately coldness, begged
him to be seated, and, as if totally unconscious of any-
thing that had passed before, requested to know what
was the cause of his being honoured with Sir Walter
Herbert's presence. -
“I should not have intruded upon you, my lord, es-
pecially at such a moment,” said Sir Walter, “but that
I was desirous both of offering you any assistance and
co-operation in my power in the very painful inquiries
which must fall to your lot to make, of laying before
you a considerable mass of information which I have
already obtained, and, at the same time, of discharging
an obligation which I only deeply regret that it has not
been in my power to liquidate long ago.”
“Thanking you for your offers of assistance, sir,”
said the earl, “we will, if you please, turn to the latter
point you have mentioned first. Although I ordered my
views upon the subject to be notified to you before the
loss I have sustained, yet I shall not suffer that loss to
interfere with the progress of a business which it must
be as agreeable to Sir Walter Herbert as to myself to
bring to a conclusion.”
The earl spoke in a cold and cutting tone, which
brought the warm blood into Sir Walter's cheek. He
replied calmly, however, saying, “Of course, my lord,
it is as agreeable to me as to you to conclude a busi-
ness of this nature, which has produced, I am sorry to
say, between us feelings which I hoped would neves
have existed.”

192 THE ROBBER.
“It seems to me, sir,” said the earl, “that we are en
tering upon irrelevant matter. I can accuse myself
of having done nothing that I was not justified in doing,
nor do I perceive that any persons have a right to ac-
cuse me of being wanting in feelings of friendship when
they were themselves the first to reject advances by
which, considering all things, I believe they might think
themselves both honoured and favoured.”
“We might view that fact in a different light, my
lord,” replied Sir Walter, who was becoming somewhat
irritated; “however, not to touch any further upon sub-
jects of an unpleasant nature, I am here to tender you
payment of the bond which you hold of mine, although,
as you are well aware, my lord, the debt was in real-
ity none of mine, but incurred through the villany of
another.”
“With that, sir, I have nothing to do,” said the earl;
“but what are these papers that you offer me?”
“They are, my lord,” replied Sir Walter, “as you
may see, bills of exchange from houses of undoubted
respectability in the capital; of course it is hardly pos-
sible to carry in safety such a sum in gold. Should
your lordship, however, as by your countenance I am
led to suppose, object to receive the amount in this man-
ner, I will, of course, cause the bills to be immediately
turned into money.”
“I am far from objecting to receive the amount in
this manner,” replied the earl; “indeed, it might be, in
many respects, more convenient; but there is something
peculiar here; more than one of these bills is endorsed
with the name of Henry Langford.”
“Such is the case, my lord,” replied Sir Walter. “Of
that gentleman I shall have to speak to you in a few
moments; but it was your lordship's wish that we should
adhere in the first instance to this business, and, such
*eing the case, we will conclude it, if you please. Are
wou willing to receive those bills in payment 1 or shall
I cause them to be turned into money, as may be done
immediately?”
A dark and fiendlike smile of satisfaction had been
gradually coming over the countenance of the earl, and
there was a struggle in his mind between the natural quick-
ness and impatience of his disposition, and the desire
which he felt to protract the actual execution of his pur-
pose, in order to enjoy every step he took therein. Im-

THE ROBBER. 193
patience, however, at length predominated, and he re-
plied, taking the whole packet of bills of exchange from
the table,
“There will be no occasion, I am afraid, to cause
these bills to be turned into money, for some time at
least; although, Sir Walter Herbert, I cannot receive
them as payment of your debt. They are, as I am in-
formed—and the name upon the back of some of them
bears out that information—they are the property of a
person now under charge of felony; and I therefore find
myself called upon, in my capacity of magistrate, to take
possession of them till the accusation against him is
proved or disproved.”
Sir Walter, for a moment, sat before him thunder-
struck, without making any reply, while the earl con-
tinued to fix upon him the full gaze of his stern dark
eyes, enjoying the surprise and pain he had occasioned.
The instant after, however, Sir Walter recovered him-
self, and, replying to the look of the earl with one as
stern and resolute, he said, “I conclude that your lord-
ship is jesting, though the moment for so doing is
strangely chosen; but I cannot believe that the Earl of
Danemore wishes to prove himself a villain more de-
testable than the needy sharper who fleeces a confiding
dupe. Concluding that there was something in noble
blood which implied honour and integrity; trusting that
a long line of generous ancestors afforded some tie to
honesty and upright conduct, if nothing more; believing
the person who calls himself the Earl of Danemore not
to be the bastard of a noble house, but one who had
some cause to hold its honour high; thus thinking and
believing, I placed in his hands those papers, which he
is bound either to receive as payment of his debt, or to
restore to me in the same manner as he received them.”
The earl was too well satisfied to yield to anger, and
he replied with the same cold and bitter calmness which
he had displayed throughout, “You are right, sir, in all
your conclusions except the last. Noble birth should be
coupled with integrity; high ancestors are a tie to hon-
our; the Earl of Danemore has every reason to believe
himself the legitimate son of his father ; but neverthe- .
less, he may take a different view of his duty from Sir
Walter Herbert, in a matter where S.r Walter Herbert
is an interested party; too much so, indeed, to judge
wi: £ clearness. These papers, which it is now

my purpose to seal up and deliver into the hands of m
worthy friend here present, Master Kinsight, are evi-
dently the property of this same Henry Langford who
stands accused of the murder of my son.”
“My lord, my lord,” interrupted Sir Walter, “if you
have taken any pains to investigate this matter, you
must be well aware that the case made out against that
upright and honourable man, Captain Langford, is not
even a case of suspicion, far less one which justifies his
detention for a moment. It is not even proved that
your son is dead; and I pray to God that it may not be
SO—”
“Prove that, sir, prove that,” exclaimed the earl,
“ and none will be more glad than I shall be; but, even
then, I very much fear these papers would remain to be
dealt with according to law, as there can be no doubt
whatever that this same Henry Langford, if not a prin-
cipal, is an accessary to all those acts of pillage and
robbery which have lately disgraced this neighbourhood.
You are not aware, Sir Walter, of all the facts; you .
are not aware of all that has been discovered this very
morning, Master Kinsight here having, with all his own
shrewdness, obtained proof, almost incontestible, that
this same Henry Langford is one of a band of plunder-
ers who have established themselves in this county, and
whose acts speak for themselves.”
Again Sir Walter Herbert was struck dumb. “My
lord,” he said at length, after a considerable pause, “I
am a magistrate of the county, and, consequently, may
be permitted to demand the nature of the evidence
against Captain Langford, especially as I have both ta-
ken a very active part in putting down the system of
violence and outrage which has, as you observed, dis-
graced this neighbourhood, and have investigated the
matter thoroughly since the attack upon my daughter,
of which you most probably have heard, and from which
she was delivered by the courage of Captain Langford
alone. I, therefore, must beg to see the evidence
against him, as I have with me the depositions of vari-
ous witnesses, which clear him of all suspicion in re-
gard to the disappearance of your son.”
“I do not think myself called upon,” replied the earl,
“nor, indeed, do I think it would be right and just, to
make any one acquainted with the discoveries we have
already made, before the whole train of evidence is ma-

ture. There are two learned, wise, and most respecta-
ble magistrates, Sir Thomas Waller and Sir Matthew
Scrope, who are even now engaged in collecting infor-
mation on the subject, and it would be not only an insult
to them, but an ineffectual means of frustrating the ends
of justice, were any other person permitted to interfere,
especially when that person is avowedly a supporter of
the culprit.”
“All this is very specious, my lord,” replied Sir Wal-
ter; “but it may be doubted—and I am one of those
who doubt—whether personal motives on your lord-
ship's part may not mingle with the view you take of
the case, and whether your known power and influence
in this neighbourhood may not have more to do with
the decision of the magistrates you mention than the
considerations of right and justice.”
“Your language, Sir Walter Herbert, is growing in-
sulting,” replied the earl, “and, indeed, so has been your
whole conduct. I have passed it over, as yet, out of
consideration for the foolish fondness which my poor son
entertained for a member of your family. It must go
no further, however, or you shall find that I am not to
be insulted with impunity. The imputations, too, which
you cast upon two most respectable men are altogether
unworthy; and I beg to say that I shall hear no more
upon this or any other subject from you. My lawyer
shall have my directions to deal with you, in regard to
your debt to me, with moderate determination ; and any
evidence that you may have collected in reference to
the prisoner had better be communicated to the two
magistrates who have the case before them. I must beg
now to be excused any further conversation on the
subject.”
“Then I am to understand, my lord,” said Sir Walter,
“that you positively and distinctly refuse to return to
me the bills of exchange which I have, with foolish con-
fidence, placed in your hands.”
The earl bowed his head in token of assent, and Sir
Walter proceeded: “You will permit me, if you please,”
he said, “to call in one of my own servants to witness
my demand and your refusal.”
“That is unnecessary, sir,” replied the earl; “I will
give you an acknowledgment under my own hand that
I have taken possession of certain bills of exchange be-

longing to Henry Langford, accused of felony. Draw
it up, sir,” he continued, turning to the lawyer.
The lawyer did as he was directed, employing all the
most cautious expressions; and the earl, after having
read the paper over, signed it, and delivered it to Sir
Walter Herbert.
“Your lordship's conduct is certainly most extraordi.
nary,” replied Sir Walter; “but this business shall soon
be cleared up, for I have determined that I will not
rest one moment till the best legal assistance has been
procured for the noble gentleman you seem disposed to
persecute, and who has been deprived of his liberty upon
the accusation of having murdered a person who is by
no means proved to be really dead.” -
He was turning to leave the apartment, and the earl
was in the act of directing his lawyer in a low voice to
have him arrested at once for the debt, when two or
three hard blows upon the door, as if struck with a
heavy stick, called the attention of the whole party, and
caused the good knight to stop, expecting to see the door
open and some one enter. The door, indeed, did open,
but it was only pushed forward a small space, just giv-
ing room sufficient to admit the head of the half-witted
man John Graves.
As soon as he saw him, Sir Walter exclaimed, “Here
is one who probably can tell us more of the matter than
any one else; for, if I am rightly informed, it was upon
his testimony, received second-hand, that these magis-
trates acted.”
“That I can, indeed,” said the half-witted man, still
standing in the doorway; “I can tell you more about
it than any one else, for I saw him buried last night
with my own eyes under the beech trees.”
“Who? who 1” demanded several voices at once;
while the earl, with the feelings of a father, breaking
forth and overpowering all others, strode forward and
gazed in the man’s face. -
“Why, the boy,” replied the other; “the boy Harold;
and I came to tell you where he lies.”
The earl covered his eyes with his hands, and for a
few minutes an awful silence spread through the room.
Sir Walter Herbert could not have found in his heart to
break in upon the first moment of paréntal grief for any
consideration; and he suffered the bišer agony to have
its way, without attempting by one word of consolation

to sooth that deep wound which he himself believed to
be incurable, and only likely to be aggravated by any
earthly appliance. The lawyer, though feeling very
differently, was yet afraid to speak; and Silly John, as
he was called, stood gazing upon them, infected by the
feelings which he had seen expressed in the countenance
of the earl and Sir Walter when he announced the sad
confirmation of their worst fears.
It was the earl himself who first broke silence. “Sir,”
he said, turning abruptly to Sir Walter, “I desire to be
alone. This is no time for any other business than that
either of mourning for my son or punishing his murder-
ers; with regard to other matters, you shall hear from
me hereafter. Your fair scornful daughter, I under-
stand, accompanied you hither, and now waits for you.
Pray tell her that, though bound by courtesy to receive
the visits of a lady at all seasons, yet at present the
heart of the father is not very well attuned to hear con-
solatory speeches on the death of his only son from the
lips of one who first encouraged and then rejected that
son’s addresses, and who, it would appear, by such con-
duct brought about his death.”
“My lord,” replied Sir Walter, mildly, “so deeply
am I sorry for you, that I will concede to your sorrow
even the privilege of being unjust, and will not defend
my child, though she be altogether innocent of that with
which you charge her. She is now in Mistress Bertha's
room, waiting my coming; and, taking leave of you
with deep sympathy for your loss, I will seek her there,
and return with her to my own dwelling.”
“Seek where you may find, Sir Walter,” said Silly
John, turning with a lacklustre smile upon the knight;
“seek where you may find; for you will not find Mis-
tress Alice or Mistress Bertha either where you think
they are; for I saw them stepping quietly up stairs to-
wards the old north tower; and the lady and her lover
are by this time looking into each other's eyes.”
“This is somewhat too much !” exclaimed the earl,
with an angry frown; “this is somewhat too much! I
did not know that the young lady was so great a pro-
ficient in policy; but, by your leave, Sir Walter. I must
interrupt their conference;” and, striding towards the
door with flashing eyes, he threw it open and advanced
towards the great staircase.
Sir Walter followed quicklv. and at the foot of the

stairs touched the earl's arm slightly, with a meaning
look, saying, at the same time, “I trust, my lord, that
in your present excited state you will not forget who
Alice Herbert is, and that her father is present.”
The earl turned and gazed at him from head to foot
“I shall not forget myself, sir,” he replied; “the Earl
of Danemore is not accustomed to injure or insult a
woman!” and, thus saying, he strode up the stairs with
the same quick pace.
CHAPTER XVIII.
THERE was a thrill in the heart of Alice Herbert as
she followed the servant through the long passages of
Danemore Castle, which sprang neither from old asso-
ciations nor from the solemn and, as it were, expect-
ing silence which reigned through the whole building.
Since she had last trod those long corridors new feel-
ings had taken possession of her bosom; new thoughts,
new hopes, new happiness, had arisen in her heart ;
and every pulse that throbbed in that heart had some
reference to the earnest affection which now dwelt
within her. As she passed along, then, following the
servant, who, with slow and solemn steps, led the way,
she could not but remember that she was probably in
the same house with Henry Langford; and a vague fan-
cy that by some means she might see him, if it were
but for a moment, made her heart beat and her whole
frame tremble.
The room to which she was led was vacant, and she
sat down to meditate over the past and the future, both
of which had a world of absorbing thoughts and feel-
ings to engage her attention. But yet her eyes wan-
dered round the small chamber, which she had not visit-
ed for many years, and she remarked that to the cruci-
fix and missal which usually lay upon a table near the
window, marking the faith of the occupier of that apart-
ment, were now added the grinning scull and mouldy
bones, which may well serve as mementoes of our mor-
tality. -
She had not been there long, however, when the slow
stately step of Mistress Bertha was heard near the door,


## p. 199 (#201) ############################################

THE ROBBER. 199
and the next moment she entered the room, gazing
upon Alice with a calm, but somewhat sad expression
of countenance as she answered her salutation.
“Good-morrow, Mistress Bertha,” said the young
lady; “I hope you have been well since we last met.
which is now a long time ago.”
“Well, quite well, lady,” replied Mistress Bertha;
“it is a long time ago; and many things have happened
in the space between which should not have happened.
Fate, however, has had its way. We must all fulfil our
destiny; and you and I, as well as others, are but work-
ing out what is to come to pass.”
“If you mean, Mistress Bertha,” said Alice, “that I
have not been here of late so frequently as I used to
be, I think, when you remember all that has happened,
you will not judge that I acted wrongly in making my
visits scarce at Danemore, where my father's reception
has long been cold.”
“I blame you not, Mistress Alice; I blame you not,”
replied the housekeeper. “What right have I to blame
you? You liked him not, you loved him not. That
was not your fault, nor the poor boy's either. You were
fated for another, and that other fated to snatch from
him that which he held dearest. We cannot contro.
our likings and dislikings; they are the work of destiny
There have been those who loved me that I could never
love, those who have treated me well and kindly, who
through long years befriended me, and with tenderness
and affection did all to win regard; and yet, when they
had done all, they failed; and, seizing gladly upon some
rash word, some hasty burst of passion, I have cast
their benefits behind me, and left them because I could
not love them. What right, then, should I have to blame
others for feeling as I have felt, and doing even less
than I have done !” -
“I am sure, Mistress Bertha,” replied Alice, gently,
“I am quite sure, from what I know of you, that, though
you might act sharply, you would never act unjustly,
and never be guilty of any degree of ingratitude, though
you almost accuse yourself of being so.”
“You do not know, you do not know,” replied the
other: “I have been guilty of ingratitude. I know, and
acknowledge, and feel, that to her who was kind to me
from her youth, whose fathers had protected my fathers,
and whose generosity had raised me from low estate,

200 THE ROBBER.
I know and feel that I was ungrateful; that I could not,
that I did not, return her love for love, and that I left
her at the first rash and thoughtless word. So far I did
wrong and felt evil; but I did no more; my heart was
not made, as many another is made, to hate because I
knew that I had wronged. I went upon my way and
she upon hers, but I sought for no opportunity of doing
her ill. On the contrary, I would willingly have atoned
for what I had done by serving her in those matters
where she felt most deeply. I did serve her as far as I
could; but there are things which I must not do, no,
not even now.” -
“I know not to what your words allude,” replied
Alice, speaking to her gently and kindly, wishing to
sooth rather than in any degree to irritate one towards
whom she had always experienced feelings of great
kindness, and even respect; for, although Mistress Ber-
tha, on many occasions, had given way in her presence
to the sharp and unruly temper which evidently existed
within her heart, yet the occasions on which it had been
exercised, Alice had always remarked, were those
where there was either an open and apparent, or a con-
cealed but no loss certain cause for the contempt or
anger to which she yielded such unbridled sway. “I
know not to what your words allude; but I doubt not
that you judge of yourself harshly, too harshly, Mis-
tress Bertha, as I have often seen you do in regard to
yourself before.”
Bertha gave a melancholy smile, and shook her head
as she replied, “Young lady, clear your mind of that
great error; the greatest, the most permicious of the
poisonous dāinties with which human vanity feeds itself
in all this world of vain things! We never judge of
ourselves too harshly. The brightest and the best, the
noblest and the most generous, if they could but look
into their own bosoms with eyes as clear and righteous
as those that gaze upon them from the sky, would find
therein a thousand dark forms and hideous errors, of
which their hearts accuse them now but little. Ay;
and if, in the whole course of human actions, we could
see the current of our various motives separated from
each other, how much that is vile and impure should
we find mingling with all that we fancy bright and
clear ! No, no! man never judges himself too harshly,
let him judge as harshly as he will. God sees and

judges, not harshly, we hope, but in mercy; and yet,
what sins does not his eye discover, what punishments
will he not have to inflict 1” -
Alice was silent; but, after a momentary pause, Ber-
tha resumed the conversation nearly where she had first
begun it. “I blame not you,” she said, “young lady,
for not loving one who loved you. It was not destined
so to be, though there may have been a feeling of pride,
too, in your dealings with him. The poor boy who is
gone had not the eagle eye and ruling look of this one;
an eagle eye and ruling look gained from a noble race
in other lands; and well do I know how, with young
happy things like you, the eyes lead captive the imagi-
nation, ay, and fix chains of iron upon the heart. Yet
you judged well and nobly too, if I see aright. That
face and form are but an image of a mind as bright,
and he has every right to have such a mind now that all
that was dark, and fierce, and harsh in the proud streams
that mingle in his veins has been purified, and tempered,
and softened by long adversity.”
“Of whom do you speak, Mistress Bertha 1" demand-
ed Alice, with a conscious blush mantling in her cheek
as she asked the question. - - -
“Of whom do I speak '" echoed Bertha, gazing on
her; “would you have me think that you do not know
of whom I speak?” *
“No !” answered Alice, blushing still more deeply;
“no, Mistress Bertha, I do not wish to deceive you. I
know, at least I guess, you speak of Captain Langford;
but—but—”
Bertha gazed thoughtfully down upon the ground for
a few moments: “I had forgot " she said at length;
“yet he did wisely, he always does wisely. But I had
not believed that there was a man who, in the unchained
moments of the heart's openness, would act so wisely
and so well ! I understand you, sweet lady. You were
not aware that I knew rightly the story of your heart;
and I knew it only by having divined it. Yet to show
you how well I have divined it, I will tell you the mo-
tive that brought you hither with your father. You
came with the view of seeing him you love!”
The ingenuous colour once more rose warm in Al.
ice's cheek; but she replied, with that sparkling of truth
and sincerity in her pure eyes that there was no doubt-
ing one single word, “No, Mistress Bertha,” she said,

%92. THE ROBBER.
“you are wrong. I came hither with lio such motive,
with no such view. My father had business with the
earl, so painful, so irritating, that I sought to accom-
pany him solely with the wish to sooth and calm both ;
but I found, as we rode along, that Sir Walter's mind
was already prepared to treat all things gently and kind-
ly, in consideration of Lord Danemore’s sad loss; and,
therefore, I thought it better to come to this room than
to intrude upon the earl's grief till I was quite sure he
would be well pleased to see me. But, on my word,
the thought of seeing Captain Langford never entered
my mind till I was crossing the hall to come hither.
Then, indeed, remembering that he had been brought
hither, and having learned that he had been most
wrongly detained here, at least all yesterday, I thought .
he might still be here, and that, perhaps, I might see
him. Nor will I deny, Mistress Bertha,” she added,
“that I much wish to do so if it be possible.”
“I believe your whole tale, Alice Herbert,” replied
Bertha ; “I believe it all, and every word; for I have
seen and watched you from your childhood, and I know
that you are truth itself. You shall see your lover,
Alice. You shall taste those few bright moments of
stolen happiness which are dear, all too dear, to every
young heart like thine.”
“Nay, nay, Bertha,” said Alice, in reply, “though I
will not deny that his society is happiness to me, I have
a greater object in view; I have to learn how I—I, his
promised wife, may aid him at the present painful mo-
ment. Nor, Bertha,” she added, while at the very repe-
tition of the words her cheek again grew red, “nor
do I wish that the moments spent with him should be
stolen moments. I ask you openly if it be possible to
let me see him and speak with him. I wish no con-
cealment. I seek not to hide either my regard for him
or my interview with him. Sure I am that my father
would approve it, and I have none but him to consider
in framing my actions.”
Bertha gazed upon her glowing countenance and
sparkling eyes, as she raised them, full of timid eager-
ness, to her face, with a look of pleasure not unmixed
with surprise. “You are, indeed, a noble creature and
a lovely one,” she said; “yours may well be called gen-
erous blood. But it shall be as you wish; and yet be
under no fear for your lover. They cannot injure him "

... is not his destiny. He is born for a very different
fate, and the fools who took him were only tools in
Fortune's hands to cut a pathway for him to the point
where he is now arrived. Fear not, Alice, but come
with me, and you shall see and speak with him; alone,
if you will.”
“No, not alone !” said Alice, again colouring; “not
alone! That were needless, useless.”
“Come with me, then,” said Bertha ; “come with me,
then, though it is little needful that you should see him
to take counsel with him for his liberation. Ere to-
morrow morning he will be free. They cannot hold
him there long. To think of holding him there at all is
idle and empty; and there is one of them, at least, that
feels it to be so, though he knows not well why.”
As she spoke she led the way out of the room in
which they were, and along the corridor towards the
great hall. Alice made no reply; for her heart beat so
fast, and her limbs trembled so much, that she was glad
to take refuge in silence in order to hide her agitation,
She knew that she was going to do nothing but what
was right. She felt that every sensation of her heart,
every purpose of her mind, was pure, and noble, and
good; and yet—why or wherefore she could not tell—
there was something in the act of thus going privately
to see her lover in the house of another which made
her tremble like a guilty creature, though conscious of
innocence in thought and deed. She looked anxiously
at each door as she passed, lest it should be opened,
and some one issue forth to interrupt her. She hurried
her pace up the great staircase, gazing round with feel-
ings of apprehension she could not comprehend; and
when at length they reached the extremity of the build-
ing, and they stood before the last door upon that side,
she was obliged to lay her hand upon Bertha's arm and
beg her to stop for a moment, in order to recover breath
and gain some degree of command over herself.
At length she said, “Now, now I am ready;” and
Bertha opened the door of the outer chamber. It was
tenanted by a single servant, apparently busy in the or-
dinary occupations of the day, putting this article of fur-
niture in one place, and that article in another, with
that sort of tardy diligence remarkable in houses where
there are many servants and but little to do.
He started, however, and turned round when he heard

204 THE ROBBER
the door open; and then advancing towards Bertha, he
... said, “My lord ordered me, Mistress Bertha, not to give
any one admission here;” he then added, in a low sort
of confidential tone, “the orders came early this morn-
ing for me to hang about here, and, when I had done
with the rooms, to remain upon the staircase, so as to
make sure that the prisoner does not escape, without
locking the doors, however; though I don't see why
my lord should take such a roundabout way, when, by
doing nothing but just turning the key, he could keep the
young man in as long as he liked.”
“The earl has his reasons for all that he does,” re-
plied Bertha, walking on; “you will do very right to
stop every one; but, of course, your lord's orders do
not apply to me. Come with me, young lady; you
may be admitted, as I told you.”
The man looked surprised and bewildered; for Mis-
tress Bertha, as he well knew, was not a person to be
contradicted with impunity; and yet he feared that he
would be doing wrong in letting the two visiters pass.
Half the advantages, however, which are gained in
this world, either over our adversaries or rivals, are ob-
tained by taking advantage of their astonishment; and
before the man had time to make up his mind as to what
he ought rightly to do, Mistress Bertha and Alice had
passed him, and the door of the inner chamber was
open.
Langford was sitting at the table, writing, and the
sound of the opening door made him raise his eyes.
For a moment it seemed as if he could scarcely believe
that what he saw was real; but then a look of joy and
satisfaction, which would have repaid Alice well had
she had to encounter a thousand dangers and difficulties
in making her way to visit him, spread over his counte-
nance, while, rising up, he advanced to meet her.
Without doubt or hesitation he cast his arm around
her and pressed his lip upon her cheek. “Thank you,
dearest Alice, thank you,” he said; “this is, indeed, most
kind and most good; how can I ever show myself grate-
ful enough for such a token of affection?”
Alice burst into tears. To see him sitting there, him
that she loved, and honoured, and esteemed, a prisoner,
and accused of dark crimes, had wrung her heart almost
to agony; but his words, and his look, and the tone of
his voice, and the touch of his hand, and the pressure of

his lips seemed to sever the bonds which held the varied
emotions struggling together in her breast, and they #ll
burst forth together in that profuse flood of tears.
“It is we that must be grateful to you,” she said, as
soon as she could speak; “it is we that must be grate-
ful to you. I cannot help suspecting, nay, believing,
that you are suffering in some degree on our account ;
but, for fear we should not have time to speak fully, let
me tell you, Langford, the principal object of my com-
ing here. I was afraid that you might not have means
allowed you of communicating with any of your friends,
and therefore I was anxious to see you, to ask what can
be done for you, what lawyer can be sent for to you, or
what means can be taken to prove your innocence.”
“My Alice has never doubted my innocence, then,”
said Langford, gazing tenderly upon her; “I knew, I
felt sure she would not.”
“Of anything like crime, Langford,” she said, “I knew
you were innocent, perfectly innocent! I might ima-
gine, indeed—for we women can hardly judge or tell to
what lengths you men may think the point of honour
should carry them—I might imagine, indeed, that you
had taken this unhappy young man’s life in honourable
quarrel; but even that I did not believe.” -
“Oh, no!” replied Langford; “I should never dream
of such a thing. Nothing could have provoked me to
do so. Besides, Alice, did I not give you my word?
and, believe me, dear Alice, believe me, now and ever,
that I look upon my word given to a woman as binding
as my word given to a man. Nay, if it were possible,
I should say more binding, because she has fewer means
of enforcing its execution. No, no! dear Alice, I parted
with him in the park within ten minutes after I left you.
It is true, he did try to provoke me to a quarrel, but I
was not to be provoked.”
“I am ashamed of having doubted you, even in that,
and for a moment,” replied Alice; “but that doubt
sprang solely from a belief that men often thought it a
point of honour to conceal their intentions from women
in such matters as these, and believe themselves justi-
fied in using any means to do so. But now, Langford,
tell me, as quickly as possible, what can be done to prove
you innocent? what is there that my father or myself
ean do to free you from a situation so painful ?”
“I know little,” replied Langford, “that can be done

under present circumstances. It is their task to prove
that I am guilty, more than mine to show that I am in-
nocent; but I hear steps upon the stairs; who have we
here, I wonder?”
As he spoke he opened the door into the other room,
which Bertha had closed behind her; and nearly at the
same moment, as the reader may have anticipated, the
outer door at the top of the stairs was thrown open, and
the Earl of Danemore, with a countenance on which
hung the thunder-cloud of deep but suppressed wrath,
strode in, followed close by Sir Walter Herbert.
The colour came and went rapidly in Alice's cheek,
and her heart beat very quick. The servant in the outer
room looked tremblingly towards Mistress Bertha; but
Bertha herself remained totally unmoved, with her long
sinewy hands, clad in their white mittens, resting calmly
upon each other, and her dark eyes raised full upon the
earl, while not a quiver of the lip or a movement of the
eyelids betrayed that she was affected by any emotion
whatsoever. Langford drew a little closer to the side
of Alice, while the earl turned his first wrath upon the
Servant.
His words were few and low, but they were fully in-
dicative of what was passing in his heart. “I com
manded,” said he, “that no one should be admitted here!
You have disobeyed my commands. Answer me not a
word. You have disobeyed my commands, and you
shall have cause to remember it to the last day of your
life. Silence, I say! Get you gone, and send hither
Wilton and the other groom of the chambers. Madam,”
he continued, advancing towards Alice, with a bitter and
sarcastic sneer curling his lip, “madam, long as I have
had the honour of your acquaintance, I did not know that.
you were so skilful a tactitian till to-day. To engage me
with your serviceable and convenient father, while you
came hither to lay your plans with a personage accused
of the murder of my son, is a stroke, indeed, worthy of
a great politician—”
Alice had turned pale when first he approached her;
but at the words “your serviceable and convenient fa-
ther,” the blood rushed up into her cheek; and though,
while turning to look at Sir Walter, whose eyes were
beginning to flash with indignation, she suffered the earl
to finish his sentence, she stopped him at the word
“politician” by raising her hand suddenly, and then re-

plied at once, with her sweet musical voice sounding
strangely melodious after the harsh tone in which Lord
Danemore had been speaking,
“Forbear, my lord,” she said, “forbear! Let me
prevent you from using any more words that you will
be ashamed of and grieve for hereafter. My motive in
coming to this house to-day was anything but that which
you imply. I came, my lord, because I feared that my
father, justly irritated at some unworthy treatment,
might act towards Lord Danemore as Lord Danemore
is now acting towards me; that is to say, might speak
angry words which he would soon be sorry for. I found,
however, my lord, that the kind gentleness of that fa-
ther's heart was already sufficient to make him forget
the injuries which Lord Danemore sought to inflict, in
the sorrow which Lord Danemore now experienced;
and though there was a time, my lord, when I believed
that the voice of Alice Herbert had some power to
sooth, to tranquillize, and to console you, I did not
flatter myself that such was the case now; and I re-
mained, in consequence, without.”
The earl seemed somewhat moved. He had listened
in silence, and drew himself up to his full height with
an air of attention and thought. When she paused,
however, he demanded, in a softer tone, “And your
coming here, madam, here, into this room, was, doubt-
less, perfectly accidental; a singular coincidence brought
you into the apartments of this worthy gentleman.”
“No, my lord,” replied Alice, with a degree of calm
dignity that set his sneers at defiance, “quite on the
contrary; as soon as I found that Captain Langford was
still here, I asked Mistress Bertha to conduct me to see
him, which, your lordship will see, was very natural,”
she added, with the colour becoming deeper and deeper
in her cheek, “if you consider, first, that he was severely
injured in my defence; next, that I have promised him
my hand; and, lastly, that I knew him to be both un-
justly charged with a great crime, and in the power of
one who sometimes suffers a nature, originally most .
noble, to be influenced too much by strong passions, and
a judgment, originally clear and bright, to be darkened
and obscured by his own desires and prejudices. My
lord,” she added, “the tone which you are pleased to
assume towards me obliges me to speak candidly; I
thought it very possible that, circumstanced as he is,

and in your power, this gentleman might meet with ob.
stacles in establishing his innocence and in communi-
cating with those who would defend and advise him.
Under these circumstances I acted as I have acted, in
order to bear any communication from him either to
my father or to any other person with whom he might
think fit to take counsel.”
“Madam,” replied the earl, with far less acerbity of
manner than before, “I find that you can judge severe-
ly too. This gentleman shall have every opportunity
of proving his innocence.”
“That, my lord, I will take care of,” interrupted Sir
Walter Herbert; “for I certainly will not trust, in the
case of my friend, to the justice of those who, without
a shadow of reason, first charged him with a crime or
which he is innocent, and then acted towards him as
if they had nearly proved him guilty.”
“He shall have every opportunity of proving his in-
nocence,” reiterated the earl, sternly; “but Sir Walter
Herbert is the man who judges too hastily. But yes-
terday I said to this same gentleman, this Captain Lang-
ford, as he is pleased to call himself, that his bare word
not to leave these apartments was sufficient. To-day I
say that those bolts and bars, strong as they are, are
not too strong to guard him withal; for I have not only
received, as you well know, the confirmation of my
poor son's death, but I have it proved, beyond all doubt,
by the testimony of those who saw him, that the man
who stands before us, after separating from that son in
the park, was seen by four different people galloping up
towards the very moor and at the very time at which
the unhappy boy was murdered. He shall have the full
opportunity of explaining or disproving this hereafter;
at present he is a close prisoner here, till he can be re
moved to-morrow to the county jail.”
Alice's cheek grew very pale as the earl spoke; not
that she for one moment suffered her confidence in
Langford's innocence to be shaken; not that one doubt
or one suspicion ever crossed her mind, but that the
words used by the earl were such as to call up before
the eye of imagination every dark and painful object
which could by any chance connect itself with her lover's
situation. The image of Langford in the county jail,
immured in a close noisome cell as a common felon,
together with all that she knew and all that she had

heard of the prisons of England—which were then a
disgrace to the land—presented itself to her mind, and
made her heart sink within her.
The eyes of her lover, however, were upon her. He
saw the colour fade away in her cheek; he saw the
anxious quivering of that beautiful lip which had so
lately spoken boldly in his defence; but Langford knew
and understood the heart whose treasured affection he
had obtained; and, taking her hand in his, he pressed
it to his lips, saying, “Fear not, dear Alice | Let them
do their worst. So confident am I in my own innocence
and in the just laws of a free land, that not the slightest
apprehension crosses my mind, though I may see a dis-
position to deny me justice. Strange, too, as it may
seem to you, I am well contented to remain in this house
for some time longer; and perhaps,” he added, “I could,
even by a single word, change entirely the feelings and
views of its noble owner.”
“I may understand you better than you think, sir,”
replied the earl, gazing upon him with the same knitted
brow; “I may know you better than you believe; but
you would find it difficult to change my views and pur-
poses. At present I have but to say that I cannot suffer
Mistress Alice Herbert to remain here any longer.
Bertha,” he continued, turning to the housekeeper,
“you have done bitterly wrong in bringing her hither.
I am willing to believe that you knew not how wrong;
but I will deal with you hereafter upon this matter.”
“Earl of Danemore, I did right!” replied the woman,
“ and I tell you that it is you who know not that which
you are doing; but the time will come when you will
repent.”
The earl's brow grew very dark, but he made a great
effort to command his passions, and he only replied,
“You have served me too faithfully and too long for my
anger to have way. But provoke me no further; I am
not in a mood to bear with your bold temper. Now,
madam,” he continued, turning to Alice, “we wait your
pleasure.”
Langford pressed her hand in his, and grasped that
which Sir Walter extended towards him; “Farewell,”
he said, “farewell for the present. It is useless to stay
longer now. All that you can do for me is to engage
some person learned in the law to watch the proceedings
against me in case I should not be liberated before to

morrow evening. I fear nothing in the straightforward
course of justice; but there are circumstances in my
situation and in my fate”—and, as he spoke, he fixed his
eyes on the earl—“which may bring persecution upon
me, though they ought to have the most opposite effect.”
The earl returned his look steadfastly and sternly,
then turned upon his heel, and, waving his hand ceremo-
niously towards the door, followed Sir Walter and Alice
out of the room. He found the servants that he had
sent for at the head of the stairs, and gave them charge
to guard the prisoner better than he had been previously
guarded; to keep the door constantly locked; and to re-
main, the one at watch on the outside of the door, while
the other kept guard at the foot of the stairs. He then
walked slowly down into the vestibule, and, in cold si-
lence on all parts, saw Sir Walter and his daughter
mount their horses and depart.
CHAPTER XIX.
Could we but have the heart of the wicked laid open
before us; could we but see how it is torn and wrung
by the evil passions that harbour within it; could we
but mark how, even in the strongest and most deter-
mined breast, when bent upon evil purposes or engaged
in wicked acts, fear and apprehension go hand in hand
with every deed of evil, while repentance, remorse, and
unishment follow more slowly, though not less surely,
in the distance; what an instructive, what an awful les-
son it would be, and how fearfully we should shrink
back from the commission of the first crime, as the
brink of a precipice which, once overleapt, dashes us
down over a thousand pointed rocks, even into the gulf
of hell itself! -
When Sir Walter and Alice Herbert had left him, the
Earl of Danemore pressed his hand upon his burning
brow for a few moments, while wild and thrilling
thoughts—all painful, all angry, all evil—crossed and
recrossed each other through his brain. He then turned
with a rapid step, and entered the room where the law-
yer had lingered behind, fearing to follow to a scene.

THE ROBBER. 211
where the violent passions which he knew existed in his
patron's breast were likely to be excited into fury. The
earl closed the door, and, casting himself down into a
chair, covered his eyes with his hands.
He was roused, however, in a moment, by a voice
saying, “Do not grieve so, Danemore; do not grieve
so. It’s a sad thing, truly, to have one's fine boy killed,
and never see him again; but we must all die once, and
you’ll die too, and very likely not long first, for you are
an old man now. Then we shall be all comfortable
again when we get on the other side of the mole's habi-
tation. Let me speak to him, Master Kinsight; why
'' Inot I comfort him $ We should all comfort each
Other. -
“I have been trying, my lord,” said the lawyer, in an
apologetic tone, as the earl raised his eyes towards the
half-witted man, “I have been trying to get out of this
foolish fellow who were the people that he saw bury
your lordship's noble son. He acknowledges that he
knows them all, but declares that he will never mention
the names of any of them.”
The earl passed his hand once or twice before his eyes,
as if to clear away other images from before his mental
vision ere he returned to the subject which was again
suddenly presented to him.
“He shall be made to tell,” said he, at length, in a
stern tone, knitting his dark brows as he spoke; “he
shall be made to tell after he has pointed out the spot
where the poor boy lies.”
“Why, my lord,” answered the lawyer, “we do not
need his help for that, as he himself says that it was
under the beech trees by the mere; but I am sure I do
not know how your lordship will make him speak, for
I have been trying for this half hour, threatening him
with your lordship's displeasure, and to have him put
in the cage, and everything I could think of, but with-
out effect.”
“There are ways would make the dumb speak,” re-
plied the earl. “I have seen—” he continued; but
then, suddenly breaking off, he changed his form of
speech, and added, “I have heard, I mean to say, of old
Spaniards in the New World who loved their gold better
than their life, and would have died sooner than reveal
the spot where their treasures were hidden; and yet
there have been found ways to make them speak, there

have been found means to make them scream forth the
name of every treasure-cave they had.”
“But, my lord,” replied the lawyer, with a somewhat
apprehensive look, “but, my lord, you know, in this
country, we dare not make use of any such means.”
The earl gazed at him sternly, and yet somewhat
contemptuously. “We will do everything lawfully,
Master Lawyer,” he said; “we will do everything law.
fully. First, we are justified, I think, in keeping this
good man in strict confinement till he has declared the
names of the murderers or their accomplices. Next,
I believe there is no law which can compel us, till he
is fully committed, to give him either meat or drink;
neither are we told that light must be admitted to the
place where he is held. Dost thou hear, Sir Fool? If
thou tellest not immediately the names of all those who
were engaged in this hellish act, thou shalt be shut up
without a crust of bread, or a drop of water, or a ray of
light; and hunger, and thirst, and darkness shall be
your companions till you do tell.”
The unhappy man gazed in his face for a moment
with a wandering and a haggard look, as if he scarcely
understood or believed the menaces held out to him.
He replied at length, however, in a low sad tone, “I
have vowed a vow, and it can’t be broken. They call
me mad, but I never broke a promise or told a false-
hood in my life. Let the wise ones say as much if they
can. No! you may quench the light of these eyes for
ever; you may deny me food, or make me perish of
thirst, but you shall never make me tell one word more
than I have told.”
“We shall see,” replied the earl, “we shall see;” and
he added a few indistinct words to the lawyer, who with-
drew, and almost immediately returned again, accom-
panied by two or three of the lower grade of serving
men, who instantly laid hands upon the object of the
earl’s indignation, and dragged him out of the room, to
fulfil the orders which they previously received by the
mouth of the attorney.
After they were gone Lord Danemore paused for a
• moment thoughtfully, and the shadows of dark passions
might be seen traversing his high and haughty brow.
Ere he spoke he recovered his calmness, and there was
even a degree of melancholy in his tone as he said,
“Men drive me to things that I would not willingly do

It is not the fault of the lion that he is a beast of prey,
nor would he, except when pressed by need, destroy or
devour any being if th ers did not torment him by
pursuit. There is a we ss in my heart towards this
youth which must be conquered. I cannot view him as
the murderer of my son, although the tidings we have
this day received would in some degree prove this to
be the case. Nevertheless, I will conquer such feel-
ings. I will overcome such folly, for these very papers
prove more than ever that it is necessary he should be
removed from my path.”
As he spoke he laid his hand on the packet of bills of
exchange, which had been sealed up and remained upon
the table.
The lawyer gazed in his face with a look of some
wonder and inquiry; but the earl proceeded without ex-
planation. -
“You will act as we before determined,” he said;
“the evidence that we have got is now strong; you will
take means still further to strengthen it. There wants
but one link in the chain. Among all those that you
know in the country round, cannot some one be found,
think you, to supply that link! some poacher, some deer-
stealer, who may have seen the shot fired, or the blow
struck, while lurking about on his unlawful avocations?
Some one who might merit forgiveness for his other of-
fences by bearing testimony in this matter?”
The lawyer looked down and hesitated. Although
his nature was no ways scrupulous, yet the bold,
straightforward, uncompromising decision of his patron
rather than encouraged him.
“I will do my best, my lord,” he said, in a low tone;
“nothing shall be wanting that I can do; but at the
same time, if we can let the matter prove itself, it would
be much better than risking anything by manufacturing
alarmed testimony.”
“See that he escape me not,” said the earl, sternly;
“see that he escape me not. Wo be unto you should
he do so. Trifle not with petty means, sir. Timidity
in such matters is ruin. Boldly, fearlessly, but skilfully
and carefully, pursue your plan. You have already the
strongest of all foundations to build upon. See that
you build well, or you shall answer to me for it. And
now to other matters, though connected, as you will
see, with that of which we have spoken. This Sir

fairs that he shall have ime, nor wish, nor op-
portunity to meddle with: Fs, he will find means to

Besides, you know my feelings on the subject; with :
him the matter must be brought to a speedy conclu-
sion.”
“That may well be done, my lord,” replied the law-
yer; “now that he has tendered you, in payment of his
debt, that which you cannot accept, it is very natural
that you should immediately take measures against
him. I myself am not much skilled in such matters,
and might make some mistake ; I saw yesterday at
the town-house a person who is now down here upon
some special business, wh n well trust, and who
will, I know, so manage the er that, once having
fixed his hands upon this kni to turn, no shift, no
evasion, scarcely even the #ower'f''the law itself, will
make him let go his hold.” * * : .
“Indeed!” said the earl, “ indeed! Pray, who is this
tenacious personage 4”
“His name, my lord, is Bolland,” replied the lawyer:
“he is a man who in the good city of London has made
himself a reputation little inferior to that of a great
general. His origin, indeed, was somewhat low, hav-
ing been a butcher in the city, a bankrupt, with some
suspicion of fraud in his transactions, and, for a certain
period, we are told, a gambler in a small way of trade.”
“A goodly commencement for a future lawyer,” said
the earl, with a bitter steer curling his lip; “ of course
he has prospered in the world?” -
“Your lordship's pardon,” replied the other, some-
what sharply; “he is no lawyer, nor has aught to do
with the law but in following its mandates. He is now
a sheriff’s officer of the county of Middlesex, but he is
not one to scruple at where he exercises his calling. I
have heard that he is amassing great wealth by the skill
with which he deals with his poor patients; sometimes
suffering them to go at large on payment of a weekly
sum ; sometimes even furnishing them with money
when he thinks that, by putting them in this or that
calling, he can ensure to himself cent. per cent. repay-
ment; but never does he suffer any one to slip through
his fingers; and, if your lordship will permit me, I will

“Do, do,” said the ( \rhº < but yet,” he continued,
“I fear that all we can if hardly be in time to pre-
vent this meddling old? af-fool I will not call him, for
fool he is not—from taking such steps as may embar-
rass our proceedings.”
“I do not know, my lord,” replied the lawyer, “I do
not know; but one thing I can answer for, that if you
but trust the matter to mé and Bolland, and pay him
well for his trouble, Sir Walter Herbert shall be in the
county jail ere the sun goes down to-night.”
“Indeed!” exclaimed the earl, “that were quick in-
deed. Promise him this night-a hundred pounds if he
contrives to execute # writ as you mention. Now
go,” continued the earl: “no time must be lost.”
But, as he saw th yer rise to obey his directions
a look of doubt and *sitation came over his counte-
nance for a moment. “My poor boy loved the girl,” he
said, “and therein there is a tie between those Herberts
and myself which I feel to be a weakness, and yet it
comes upon me even now, when I think I am destroy-
ing the father of one for whom he felt so tenderly.
Stay, Master Attorney, stay! My poor boy loved the
girl!”
Accursed be all those, doubly accursed, who, when
better feelings are coming over our hearts; when the
well of sweet waters is gushing up, which is found
somewhere in almost every desert; when a touch of hu-
man affection is softening the harsh asperity of anger,
blunting the sting of hatred, or relaxing the iron grasp
of revenge accursed be all those, I say, who at such
moments come in, and rouse up again within us the evil
passions that have been lulled to sleep, and might, per-
chance, be strangled in their slumber, if some fiendish
voice from without did not waken them into fresh ac-
tivity. -
The lawyer saw the shade of unwonted gentleness
that passed over his patron's countenance with pain,
for his own mind was made up altogether of considera-
tions of petty interest, and he foresaw loss in any relax-
ation of the other's harsh determinations.
With the skill of a demon, he instantly perceived how
he might turn the rare drop of honey into gall and bit-
verness; and he replied, “Yes, my lord, he did love

4. & fisp, he did love her deally, but she did not love him
as he deserved to be loveda, the last most painful
feelings of all his life were ar t about by her conduct
to him.” ". -
“It is true,” said the earl, frowning; “it is true !
Go, and lose no time. I have a sad task before me in
the mean time, and I would fain have intrusted you with
it, Master Kinsight, but it cannot be. You would not
have time and opportunity to accomplish both.”
“Pray what may it be, my lord?” demanded the law-
yer, eagerly, fearful of losing some other lucrative oc-
cupation. “My business with Bolland will be over in
a minute. I give him but directions, and trust the rest
to him. Pray what may it be?” . -
“Can you not divine, man?” demanded the earl, fix-
ing his large stern eyes upon him; “can you not divine,
that it is to seek and bring home the dead body of my
unhappy son from the spot where this idiot says they
have laid him 1”
“Oh! my lord,” exclaimed the lawyer, with some
touch of human feeling breaking even through his sordid
nature, like a misty ray of sunshine streaming through
a dark cloud; “oh! my lord, such is no task for you.
It would wring your heart sadly to be present yourself.
Besides, the magistrates ought to be there. Now, after
I have spoken with Bolland, and left the business in his
hands, I shall have plenty of time to see Sir Matthew
Scrope and Sir Thomas Waller, and go with them to
the spot. Leave it to me, my lord, leave it to me; and
if I bring those two worthy justices over here with me,
we may, perhaps, find some means of making this half-
witted man give us further information regarding the
murderers.”
“Bring them not! bring them not!” replied the earl,
vehemently. “Mark me, my good friend ! In this mat-
ter I am moved by many very opposite feelings. You
know—you must feel, for you are a father yourself-how
I thirst to discover, and to drink the heart’s blood of my
son's murderer! and yet I doubt that this fool, if forced
to speak to any other ear but my own, might reveal
matter which might tend to exculpate him whom we
have there shut up above, and who must be swept from
my path if I would have any peace during my remain-
ing years. I am not a man to live in doubt or hesita.

him, the matter between us must be brought to an issue
at once, and he or I must fall! No,” he added, “not
bring not those men"Hither, I am sick of them We
must use them as tools, but not let them use us. Take
them, then, with you to search under the beech trees, but
bring them not hither! When all is done, return your-
self and let me know. I shall have occupation enough
in the mean time to busy my thoughts with things less
sad, though not less painful, perhaps, than the task which
I make over to you; and now go quickly.”
“Shall I take these papers with me?” demanded the
lawyer, laying his hand upon the packet of bills of ex-
change which had been sealed up before Sir Walter Her-
bert.
“No !” answered the earl, sternly ; “leave them
where they are.”
“I thought they were to be deposited with me,” re-
joined the agent, with a lingering affection for the money
which he could not restrain, even though he feared to
offend his patron.
“I say, sir, leave them where they are, and go upon
your errand,” rejoined the earl, in a tone that could not
be misunderstood; and, without uttering another word,
he pointed towards the door, and drove the lawyer out
of the room by the fierce sternness of his gaze.
As soon as he was gone and the door closed, the earl
took up the packet and deliberately broke the seals:
then examined each of the papers minutely, muttering,
as he did it, “I thought so, I thought so; they have
watched all that I have done; they have tracked me
from land to land, and they have gained that knowledge
of my past deeds which they think will give them power
over me, and force me to do that which they know I
would never do without. But they shall find themselves
mistaken. Yet when I think upon all the past, the
memory of friendship and of love is stronger even than
hatred and apprehension; and I find that the lines graven
on the soft heart of youth in early days may be crossed
and traversed by many others in after life, but can never
wholly be erased. Would to God that they had not
driven me to it! Would to God that they did not thrust
themselves in the path of one who is forced to go for-
ward on his way; who cannot, who must not go back;
who must trample on all that oppose him ! But I am
we: £i. I am weak to think of such things. He

“has sought his fate, and he must find it. Yet I will see
him once more; I will make myself sure of myself and
of him before I do that which can never be recalled; but
not now; not in the broad day. He is too like the dead;
and the dark glimmer of the lamp, or the blue gleam of
the lightning gives the only light by which we should
meet. I doubt that woman Bertha, too; I doubt her
much: but yet I love not to question her about such
things; for she will come harshly upon the bitter sub-
ject of the past, and will turn once more those memo-
ries, which time is softening and rendering more gentle,
into all that is dark, and bitter, and fearful.”
Such were some of the words that broke from the
bosom of a man torn by contending passions. They
were spoken also: they were words as well as thoughts;
for he was one with whom the struggles of the impatient
spirit within, especially in his solitary moments, often
mastered the guard set habitually upon the lips, and
gave voice to thoughts and feelings when alone which
he most anxiously concealed when the watchful and
oppressive world was round about him.
Again and again he looked over those papers, and again
and again some new comment sprang to his lips; but his
thoughts evidently became more and more painful as his
mind was drawn forcibly back to dwell upon the past;
and at length, covering his eyes with his hands, he gave
way to many a bitter and mingled feeling, and groaned
aloud in agony of heart as he recollected the deeds he
had done, the flowers he had trampled on, the treasures
he had scattered from his path, never to be found again.
CHAPTER XX.
A BouT four hours after the period at which we closed
the last chapter, a number of persons were to be seen
collected between the grove of beech-trees on the moor
and the long sheet of shallow water called Upwater
Mere. They were of a varied and motley character;
for there might be seen the worshipful and the honour-
able of the county on horseback; and thence downward,
going in progression through the ownership of many a

four-footed beast, appeared all classes of the communi-
ty, till you came to the poorest of poor labourers, who
had not even a cur to follow him.
At the head of the group, and leading its operations
with pompous dignity, appeared the portly persons of
Sir Matthew Scrope and Sir Thomas Waller; and be-
hind them again, prompting their motions, though ap-
pearing to submit to their will, were four other person-
ages on horseback; that is to say, their own joint
clerk as justices of the peace; Master Nicholas, clerk
of the receiver of the county, whose narrow escape
from the hands of the Philistines we have recorded in
another place; Master Kinsight, attorney-at-law, agent
and lawyer to the Earl of Danemore; and a certain
black-bearded, round-faced, keen-eyed gentleman, strong,
though not long, in limb, mounted upon a spirited blood
nag, with a certain knowing look both about master
and beast which betokened in each great acquaintance
with the ways of the world.
The lawyer Kinsight called him Master Bolland, and
often commented to him in a whisper upon the pro-
ceedings of the party they accompanied. Bolland rarely
made any verbal reply, but he looked volumes; and the
wink of his black eye was made, by its different char-
acters, to express almost as many things as Lord Bur-
leigh's shake of the head.
The greater part of the body had come thither in pro-
cession from the neighbouring county town. Some
had joined it in the way, and some had been found al-
ready waiting on the heath; but, as soon as the whole
party was assembled by the side of the beech trees, a
perquisition was commenced in order to discover any
ground which might seem to have been recently moved;
and, ere any long search had been made, a part of the
thin green turf showed, amid the rank blades of grass
which covered the ground beneath the trees, a quantity
of scattered mould, clearly indicating that there was the
spot they sought. -
As soon as this discovery was made, a new difficulty
presented itself. It was found that, with a degree of
foresight common to county magistrates in those days,
the worthy and worshipful knights who came to ex-
hume the body reported to be interred there had for-
gotten to order any spades, shovels, or pickaxes to be
brought with them; and there they were, in the midst

of a wide moor where no implement of the kind was to
be found within a mile or two. On the first mention of
this want, one of the more active of the lads who had
accompanied the party set off as hard as his legs would
carry him in the direction of the little town of Moor-
hurst; but, as that town was at several miles distance,
some of the other persons present suggested that it
would be better to send up to the farm which had lately
been taken by Farmer Gray, just upon the edge of the
moor; and, while this suggestion. was actually being
followed, a discussion naturally arose in regard to Farm-
er Gray, his character, habits, appearance, station, for-
tune, and farm. -
“Ay, he has got a bad bargain of it,” said a sturdy .
farmer, in a white smock frock, which concealed the
greater part of a strong short-backed pony that he be-
strode; “ay, he has got a bad bargain of it; and, if he
do not mind what he's about, he'll do for himself. I
might have had the farm for an old song if I had liked,
but I’d have nothing to do with such poor swampy stuff.
Why the place has been out of lease for two years.”
“He’ll do very well,” grunted another of the same
class. “I’m sorry I did not take the place myself.
He'll do very well; he comes from Lincolnshire, and
knows that sort of land. At least I saw “Franklin
Gray, Squash-lane, Lincolnshire, upon one of his carts.
He'll do very well. He has the finest horses in the
country, too.” - -
“I wonder you call those fine horses, Master Brown,”
said a respectable labourer, who overheard the conver-
sation; “they are no more fitted for hard work than
my sick wife Jane; and as for the matter of that, Farm-
er Gray will never be much liked hereabout, for he's
brought all his own labourers with him, and that’s a hard
case upon the people of the place. They say he has
been a soldier, too; and I’m sure he don't look like a
farmer, or anything half as honest. Why he goes about
in a laced jacket, like a gentleman; and I never saw
him at market, not I.”
“I’ll tell you what,” cried a sturdy drover, who had
joined the group, “he's as good a judge of cattle, for all
that, as any man in this country. He knows a beast
when he sees it, do'sn't he Why, he bought half a
score of me the other day, and paid me down, drink
money and all, without a word.” - -

THE ROBBER. 221
Such were comments that took place upon Franklin
Gray in one of the groups into which the party had di-
vided itself. Something similar, with a very slight varia-
tion from the different class and character of the speak-
ers, was taking place among the rest; and all the little
investigating spirit which is excited by the arrival of a
stranger in a country place, especially if that stranger
be somewhat reserved in his habits, was exercising it-
self in regard to Franklin Gray among the whole of the
assembly on the moor.
Lawyer Kinsight ventured to hint that he suspected
Farmer Gray had been a bankrupt in Lincolnshire before
he came into their county; but this was instantly con-
tradicted by several others who had had dealings with
him, and who represented him as possessing all those
excellent qualities which gold invariably bestows upon
its owner. Two or three of the young men talked of
Farmer Gray's beautiful wife, but declared she was as
coy and backward as if she had been old and ugly.
Some had only caught a sight of her; some had heard
her speak; and some had never even seen her, but were
in raptures with her beauty on the mere report of oth-
ers. What between the rumours of the wife's beauty,
the husband's wealth, and the report of his wearing a
laced jacket, like a gentleman, Sir Matthew Scrope and
Sir Thomas Waller found the two organs of curiosity
and reverence in their respective brains considerably
excited regarding Franklin Gray, and they entered into
slow and solemn discussion as to whether, under exist-
ing circumstances, they should or should not pay him a
formal visit.
At the end of about half an hour, however, some one
was seen coming slowly across the moor on horseback,
accompanied by two or three others; and in due time
appeared the person who had been sent for the spades
and shovels, accompanied by Franklin Gray himself,
with two or three men furnished with implements for
digging. Gray was mounted on a fine powerful horse,
full of fire and activity, which he sat in a very different
manner from that in which the personages around him
bestrode their beasts; and there was something, indeed,
in his whole appearance and demeanour which made the
greater part of the men assembled take off their hats as
he rode up. -
There was only one pe: present, with the excep-

tion of the drover, who showed the slightest sign of
recognition, and that was Master Bolland, who gave a
sudden start, and then turned pale, as the stern fierce
eye of Franklin Gray fixed for a moment full upon him,
with a meaning, perhaps a menacing look. He ven-
tured upon no other token of acquaintanceship, howev-
er; and Gray, riding up at once to the magistrates, bowed
to them somewhat haughtily, and said, “I am happy to
hear from this good man that your worships have dis
covered the place where this poor young nobleman's
body has been concealed; indeed, I expected no less
from your known wisdom, as soon as I heard that you
had taken the matter in hand. I have now come down
at once to offer you every assistance in my power, and
say that I hope some means will be immediately taken
for putting a stop to all these terrible things that are
daily occurring in the county. Indeed, no one is so
much interested as I am; for, having taken this lonely
farm here, I am obliged to cross the moor constantly,
often with large sums about me, and it is but fit that we
should have protection under such circumstances.”
“That it is, indeed, Master Gray,” said Master Nicho-
las, the clerk; “I am just in the same condition as your-
self; and I hope, at the very next meeting of the magis-
trates, something will be done.”
“Depend upon it, depend upon it!” said Sir Matthew
Scrope, “something shall be done, Master Nicholas;
something shall be done, Master Franklin Gray ! I
should be very glad to confer with you on the subject,
sir,” he added, addressing the latter, for whom his rev-
erence was getting very high; “and we will taste to-
gether my last year's cider, which is now just in its
prime. But now let us fall to work;” and he and the
rest accordingly dismounted from their horses, and di-
rected the labourers whom they had brought with them
to dig up that part of the ground which bore marks of
having been lately moved.
Shovelful after shovelful of earth was thrown out, and
the work had proceeded some way, when, cantering
quickly along the road, appeared two or three persons,
who proved to be Sir Walter Herbert and his servants.
The countenances of Sir Matthew Scrope and Sir Thom-
as Waller immediately fell, and the first impulse of the
former was to bid the workmen suspend their proceed-
ings; after which he turned to his comrade, beckoned

up the clerk and the Earl of Danemore's lawyer, and
held with them a quick whispering conference apart.
In the mean while Sir Walter came up and dismount-
ed from his horse, while every head was uncovered
around, and every face beamed with a smile of pleasure
and satisfaction to see him there.
“I have come,” he said, “gentlemen, to be a witness
of the execution of that painful task which you have
undertaken, and to see, perhaps for the last time, the
body of my poor young friend, Lord Harold, whose
death has unfortunately been made a pretext for accu-
sing another friend, not less noble and excellent, of a foul
and horrible crime.” -
“Pretext, sir, pretext,” exclaimed Sir Thomas Wal-
ler, “I do not know what you mean by pretext. Do
you mean to charge me, sir? Do you mean to insin-
uate, sir? Should such imputations as these go on, I
shall certainly order the work to be suspended, for we
are not going to proceed with this matter to be in-
sulted.”
“Sir Thomas,” replied the other, “I have no inten-
tion of insulting you; and the only effect of your order-
ing the work to be suspended will be, that I shall order
it to go on. You forget, sir, that I am not only a ma-
gistrate as well as yourself, but lord of the manor on
, which you stand. Go on, my good fellows, and make
good speed !”
The men required no other authority, but with re-
doubled activity plied their work, and in a few moments
a long deal case was discovered, rudely put together.
The labourers tried to take the top off at once, but they
could not accomplish it; and, after digging round it on all
sides, they lifted the heavy burden carefully out and
laid it upon the edge of the pit. The whole crowd
gathered round, pressing somewhat roughly upon the
principal personages, who occupied the front stations
about the grave. Sir Matthew Scrope put on his spec-
tacles, and rubbed his hands as if arriving near some
long-desired consummation. Sir Walter Herbert stood
near the foot of the coffin, if it could be so called, and
gazed upon it with a brow of sorrow and something
bright glistening in his eyes. Franklin Gray looked on
sternly, with his arms crossed upon his broad bull-like
chest, and his brow gathered into a heavy frown.
There was some difficulty in wrenching up the top.

224 THE ROBBER
But at length one of the labourers, forcing the spade
between it and the sides, tore it open, and exposed to
view the ghastly spectacle of death within.
Those who were without saw nothing but the form of
a dead man; but among those who immediately sur-
rounded the chest there were exclamations of surprise,
which made the rest press forward to get a nearer view,
and it was then perceived by all who had known Lord
Harold that the body was that of a stranger. In the
centre of the forehead was a small round wound,
spreading from which on every side was a dark dis-
coloured bruise, and a considerable quantity of blood had
run down and disfigured the face, on which it had been
suffered to remain. Still the features were sufficiently
distinct to show every one that this was not the corpse
that they expected to find; and though each counte-
nance around was pale with agitation and awe, yet on
the lip of Sir Walter Herbert and of many others there
appeared a smile of hope renewed.
That smile was almost immediately done away,
however, when they could look farther, for across the
breast of the dead man lay a paper on which was
written, in a large bold hand, “The punishment of him
who shot Edward Lord Harold.”
The first who read the paper was the magistrate's
clerk, and the words were circulated in a low murmur
from one to another around. But at the same time
Master Nicholas, the clerk to the receiver of the county,
pressed forward as if moved by some sudden impulse,
and, getting as near the head of the corpse as he could,
he gazed eagerly in its face, exclaiming, “It is; yes, I
declare it is. . It is the very same man that I saw lying
on the road that night when the robbers laid hold of
Mistress Alice Herbert; and he was one of them, too,
beyond all doubt!”
“Doubtless it must be the same,” said Franklin Gray,
gravely. “I think I never saw a more rascally coun-
tenance in my life, or one that seemed more likely to
deserve the fate that he has met with.”
“His clothes are very good, however,” said Sir
Matthew Scrope; “they don’t look like those of a
robber. Why, I declare there is as much lace as would
cost two or three marks any day.”
“It's the same man, however,” reiterated Master
Nicholas; “that I will swear to; and that he was a

robber, there can be little doubt, from what happened
to Mistress Alice Herbert. Is it not so, Sir Walter?”
“Undoubtedly,” replied Sir Walter. “There is no
doubt: there can be no doubt that robbery - as their
purpose. Nor is it improbable that this is one of them.
One man was wounded and disarmed by my excellent
friend, Captain Langford. The other was beaten down
and stunned by the poor innocent John Graves, and he
it was, Master Nicholas, whom you saw upon the road.
Let all these matters, be taken down,” he continued,
looking round him for some one who was capable of
the task.
“Where is the coroner?” Sir Walter demanded
abruptly, when he could not discover that officer amid
those around. “That officer should have been here.
Why was he not summoned? When a body supposed
to be murdered is discovered buried in a lonely common
like this, it is natural to ask, where is the coroner?
and to deprecate excessively his not being on the spot.
May I ask, Sir Matthew, whether, in all the informal
and somewhat extraordinary steps which you have
thought fit to take, you have remembered the simple
one of calling to your aid the coroner of the county?”
“Why, sir,” replied Sir Matthew Scrope, in some
confusion, “we were so hurried to decide, we were so
pressed onward for time, that I do not know how it
was the coroner was forgotten.”
“In short, sir,” replied Sir Walter Herbert, “you
forgot all except that which might serve your own
purpose; you forgot all except that which might con-
demn an innocent man; and the regular course of
justice in the land was in no degree attended to ! This
must be remedied. I, as a magistrate, must demand
that the coroner be instantly sent for. He should have
witnessed the exhumation. He should have been
present at every step through all this business; and
you, my good friends, the yeomen of this county, will
witness that, in taking cognizance of these transactions,
the proper officer of the crown has not been upon the
spot, has not received any summons to attend, and
that, from the very beginning to the close, two magis-
trates alone have conducted the whole investigation,
showing a great disinclination to any open inquiry into
their conduct or purposes.”
“That we will. That we will,” cried several voices;

226 THE ROBBER.
and one or two persons from the little town of Moor-
hurst gave point to Sir Walter's charge, by mentioning
the name of Langford, and declaring that he had won
the love of all around him instead of injuring anybody.
At the same time, however, the attorney was seen
whispering eagerly to Master Bolland, who, on his part,
seemed to show some slight degree of hesitation,
listening silently to the promptings of the lawyer, ey-
ing from time to time Sir Walter Herbert, and then
scanning the crowd around.
Sir Matthew Scrope by this time was at the end of
his eloquence; and though he swelled and coloured like
an offended turkey-cock, he made no reply to Sir
Walter Herbert. The other magistrate, however,
bristled up in his own defence, vowed that what they
had done in regard to Langford was perfectly justifiable,
and ended by striking his clinched fist upon his thigh,
and swearing, with not a very worshipful oath, that the
prisoner should be fully committed to the county jail
the very next day, in spite of all the Walter Herberts in
the land.
The old knight was about to reply, and probably, in
the heat of the moment, might have said things that he
would afterward have regretted; but, during Sir Thomas
Waller's angry declaration, Master Bolland had walked
round; and now, with a thin slip of parchment in his
hand, he laid his finger on Sir Walter Herbert's shoulder,
saying, “Sir Walter Herbert, Knight, I arrest you in
the name of the sheriff of the county of — at the suit
of the Earl of Danemore.”
The old man turned very pale, and put his hand to
his head, saying, “This is most strange and most un-
handsome !”
The people who stood around were all taken by sur-
prise, and felt more or less a sense of grief, compassion,
and indignation, so that there came a profound silence for
the space of about a minute over the whole multitude.
Even Sir Matthew Scrope and Sir Thomas Waller gazed
as well as the rest with painful emotions in the pale but
noble countenance of the old knight of Moorhurst, as,
standing by the side of the dead body which they had
so lately disinterred, he felt a momentary regret that
# himself was not cold, and silent, and feelingless,
ike it. -
The silence lasted for about a minute, but then it was

suddenly broken by an unexpected event. One of the
young farmers, who had been standing by Bolland and
the lawyer while they conversed, glanced from the
honoured countenance of Sir Walter Herbert to the
shrewd mean face of Master Kinsight. He seemed to
struggle during that temporary silence with strong emo-
tions; but then, giving way to a burst of unconquerable
indignation, he struck the lawyer a violent blow in the
face with his clinched fist, exclaiming, “D—n thee! it
is thou that hast done all this mischief!”
The lawyer was stretched with that one blow at his
feet, with the blood starting from his mouth and nostrils.
A general commotion took place among the people;
violent hands were laid instantly upon Bolland. They
declared that “Sir Walter, good Sir Walter, should not
be taken from among them.” The magistrates in vain
endeavoured to interpose; and the peasantry, trampling
the lawyer under their feet, dragged the sheriff's officer
forward to the side of the mere, declaring they would
half drown him for his pains, and do the same to Mat-
thew Scrope and Sir Thomas Waller if they did not get
upon their horses and ride away with all speed.
The warning was not lost upon them; but each.
scrambled upon his beast, and, followed by their clerk
and Master Nicholas, got out of the affray as fast as
they could, and made the best of their way back to the
county town, where they arrived as the evening was
just closing in.
In the mean while Bolland was saved from the fate
prepared for him by the voice of Sir Walter Herbert,
who with much difficulty made himself heard, and in-
duced the peasantry to release the bailiff.
“Master Officer,” he added, as soon as he saw that
the people had taken their unwilling hands off Bolland,
who, with his under jaw stuck out and his hat knocked
off his head, remained standing, with an air of dogged
determination, by the side of the water, “Master Officer,
having been appointed to see the law executed, I am
not one to resist it, and am ready to submit to your ar-
rest this moment !”
“Hang me if thou shalt!” cried one of the farmers
“If that man put a finger on thee again. I’ll beat the sou.
out of him; so look to it, bailiff! and with vour eave.
Sir Walter, we'll see you safe down to your own nouse:
for go with him you sha’n’t, whether you like it or not ”

Sir Walter looked with some degree of hesitation in
the face of the officer, who nodded as if to signify that
he understood him, and then replied aloud, “It's no use,
sir, it's no use ! The writ's gone to the devil amid these
mad people, so you had better do what they would have
ou.”
“So be it, then,” replied Sir Walter Herbert; “and
I doubt not, ere to-morrow, to be able to raise funds to
discharge this claim of Lord Danemore's. But now let
us look after that unworthy but unfortunate man Kin-
sight, whom I saw knocked down and trampled upon.
My good friends, you have been violent, much too vio-
lent in this business. No one has a right to interrupt
the course of the law, far less to injure those who,
however ungenerously they may demean themselves,
are not overstepping its authority.”
While Bolland slunk away, and, joining a group of
people from the county town who had held aloof from
the affray, mounted his horse, and made his way across
the moor, Sir Walter returned to the spot where the at-
torney had been knocked down, and beheld, with feel-
ings of great pain and anxiety, that, though he still
.breathed, he was quite insensible, and had evidently re-
ceived various severe injuries. It was in vain that he
endeavoured to impress upon the peasantry about him
that a great wrong and a great crime had been com-
mitted.
The only answer he could obtain was, “It serves him
right !” and with difficulty he prevailed upon some of
the labourers to place the hurt man upon the cover of
the large wooden case they had dug up, and to carry
him down to the small town of Moorhurst, in order to
obtain medical assistance. The body of the dead man
which they had disinterred—and which has been already
recognised by the reader as that of the robber Wiley-
was also carried down to Moorhurst; and, before he
even returned to the Manor House, Sir Walter de-
spatched a messenger to the coroner, briefly narrating
the events that had occurred.
While the rescue of Sir Walter Herbert was taking
-place, Franklin Gray had remained looking on, with his
arms folded on his chest, and an expression of no slight
satisfaction curling his lip. As soon as Bolland, how-
ever, was set free and rode away, Gray threw himself
upon his horse again, and galloped after him over the

moor. He overtook him at the distance of about four
miles from the county town, and called to him by his
name. It was evident, from the countenance of Bolland,
as he turned round to see who it was that followed him,
that he had no great taste for Franklin Gray's society.
The other, however, pushed on his horse till he came
upon a line with him; and then, just touching him with
the cane he carried in his hand, he said, “Stop a mo-
ment, Master Bolland, I want a word with you.”
“Do you mean really to say stop?” demanded Bol-
land, with a grim smile. “How am I to take you,
captain?”
“Why, not in the sense you're afraid of,” answered
Gray; “I only want to ask you a question. Are you
fully aware, Master Bolland, that I could hang you to-
morrow if I liked it?”
Bolland hesitated, but then replied, “Why, perhaps
I could do the same good turn for you, captain.”
“That would be difficult,” answered Gray. “I know
my own fate, Master Bolland; and though there is no
fear of my ever dying in my bed like a consumptive
schoolgirl, there is as little chance of my dying on a
scaffold. As to you, you are as sure of being hanged
as if the rope were now round your neck;" but I, for my
part, have no wish to put it there, and I want a plain an-
swer to my simple question. Are you fully aware that
I could hang you to-morrow if I liked it?”
“To be candid with you, Master Gray,” replied Bol-
land, “I believe you might if you have still got a certain
awkward piece of paper in your hands; but I think it
would be a dangerous matter for you to undertake, for
I might give the beaks a clew—”
“That has nothing to do with the question,” rejoined
Gray; “all I wanted to be sure of was that you knew
how we stood towards each other. I like to have some
hold upon gentlemen of your cloth, who think fit to look
as if they had seen me before.”
“Oh, I am a man of honour, captain,” replied Bolland;
* He was, indeed, tried some years afterward for forgery, and
made a very brilliant defence on his trial, which, however, availed
him nothing. He was hanged for the offence, which was one of the
least crimes he had committed; and at his death were disclosed a
thousand acts of infamy which had been perpetrated by him under
the mantle of our dreadful law of imprisonment for debt.

“you know I would not do an unhandsome thing by a
gentleman for the world.” -
“I am now quite sure that you would not do so by
me,” replied Gray; “so good-night, Master Bolland.”
And, thus speaking, he turned his horse and galloped off
over the moor, upon which the shades of night were
now rapidly descending.

T H E R O B B E R.
CHAPTER I.
WITH a sad heart Sir Walter Herbert turned towards
his own dwelling, after having taken all the proper steps
to secure medical assistance for the lawyer of the Earl
of Danemore, and to have a proper investigation insti-
tuted regarding the death of the man whose body had
been found buried in the moor. Every circumstance
combined to sadden and pain him; the imprisonment
of Langford, and the uncertainty of his fate, the strange
and somewhat fearful event attending the finding of the
dead body, the scene of violence and outrage which had
occurred on the attempt to arrest him, the dangerous
condition of the lawyer, and the severe punishment
likely to be inflicted, if he should die, upon the warm-
hearted people who had taken part in the affray, might
well have rendered the good knight melancholy and
desponding, even if care had not pressed heavily upon
him in regard to his own affairs.
He went home, however, under the full impression
that the writ against him would be renewed on the
morrow, and that twelve or fourteen hours was the
whole space of time which would be allowed him to
prepare for the payment of the debt. He had to tell his
sweet daughter all these painful facts; he had to require
of her to give up, for the sake of his liberty, the small
fortune which she called her own; he had himself to
take means, as rapidly as possible, to sell the old family
plate, which he had seen standing on his sideboard for
fifty years; and, bitterer than all, he had to sell those
jewels which had been worn by the wife he had always
truly loved—many a sweet token of early affection—the
gems that she had received on her wedding morning,
and many a trinket and ornament which marked, in the
calendar of past time, some bright days, some happy
hours, that could return no more.

Even then, perhaps, all would not be sufficient, and
he thought of what more could be sacrificed to satisfy
the claim against him. His horses, his carriages, they
could, indeed, be sold, but this would not go far; his li-
brary, if disposed of in haste, would not bring half its
value; his pictures, though chosen with much knowledge
and fine taste, would be thrown away in that remote
part of the country; and he pondered, and calculated,
and doubted till he reached his own doorway.
“Halliday,” he said to the servant whom he met, “I
wish you would mount Whitefoot as soon as possible,
and ride over to the county town. There tell honest
Master Antony Evelyn, attorney-at-law, to come over
here without a moment's delay, bringing his clerk with
him; and also, if you can find Brooks, the jeweller, make
him come too.”
The man bowed without reply, and Sir Walter went
into the room where his daughter sat expecting him.
Her arms were round his neck in a moment; and the
expression of her countenance, which had become very
pale under the grief and agitation of the last few days,
told him, without her speaking, how anxiously she had
watched for him, and how apprehensive she had been
of some new evil.
“I have been detained very long from you, my sweet
Alice,” he said, trying to look as cheerful as he could;
“but several extraordinary things have occurred to de-
tain me. Nay, look not alarmed, dear Alice; some of
those things are to a certain extent satisfactory. The
body of poor Lord Harold has not been found, but in the
place where it was supposed to be laid was discovered
another body, that of a man who had evidently met with
a violent death; and on the breast was placed a paper
intimating that it was the corpse of him who had mur- -
dered Lord Harold, or something to that effect. This
must tend, my dear girl,” he continued, taking his child's
hand between both of his, as he saw that the very men-
tion of such circumstances affected her very much;
“this must tend greatly to hasten our dear friend Lang-
ford's exculpation, as he could have no hand in the
burial of this unknown person, having been at that very
time in confinement on this false charge when poor silly
John Graves saw the corpse interred. It must, there-
fore, I say, greatly tend to hasten his exculpation.”
“Thank God for that, my dear father thank God for

THE ROBBER. 5
that!” replied Alice; not with the usual levity with
which such an exclamation is often uttered, but with
true thankfulness, deep and sincere. “If Langford
were but free, I think, at least I hope, that you and he,
by consulting together, might soon find means of remo-
ving all the other terrible things that now seem to be
hanging over us.”
“His liberation would at once remove one great dif.
ficulty,” replied Sir Walter; “for the earl would no
longer have a pretext for detaining the money which I
tendered him, as he most unhandsomely and ungener-
ously did this morning; but I see that it is the earl’s
object to pain and injure me.”
“But tell me what more has happened, my dear
father,” said Alice, seating herself beside him; “I see
by your face that the rest of your tidings are not so
agreeable as the first part. Indeed, I know that you
always tell me the pleasant news first, and then would
fain not let me hear the rest at all. But, indeed, dear
father, I am prepared, I am fully prepared; and where-
fore am I your child, if not to share and lighten your
cares and anxieties.”
“Thou dost lighten them, my Alice,” answered her
father; “thou dost lighten them by thy very looks; but
still, my dear child, I have much that is painful to tell,
and, if it were possible, would fain keep it to my own
breast. But it must be told, Alice, for your father must
at length come to his child for aid.”
“Oh that his child's powers to grant it were as great
as her will, my father. Do you know, I do not look
upon a little adversity, my dear father, with so evil an
eye as you do. I could almost wish for it, if it did not
go too far and make you unhappy, to show you how
easily I could bear it, and to have the means of paying
you back all the kindness, and tenderness, and care you
have shown me.”
She spoke with a smile, but there was nothing harsh
to the feelings of Sir Walter in her playfulness even at
that moment, for it was mixed with sadness, like the
gleam of the blue sky through a stormy cloud. He
pressed her to his bosom, and he told her all that had
occurred; and she felt more bitterly than even he had
the insult and the degradation which had been offered
to him. She thought of her father's years and of his
character; she thought of him, not only as her own

parent, but as the benevolent master, the kind friend,
fhe liberal landlord, the benefactor of all that came near
alm; and when she heard that an attempt had been made
unannounced to arrest him for debt, in the midst of the
tenantry that reverenced him, in the face of the country
where he had lived and done good through a long life,
indignation was strong in her heart; and, as she would
rot give it words, it broke through the silken lashes of
her eyes in tears.
“There are many painful points in this business, dear
Alice,” continued her father, “should this lawyer die,
which seems to me but too likely from his state; poor
young Rapson, who struck him the first blow, is likely
to fall under severe punishment.”
“Oh, Heaven forbid that he should die,” exclaimed
Alice, eagerly; “though he is a bad man, and an unkind
one, I trust that so severe a fate may not overtake him,
especially under such circumstances as these.”
“I trust not, also, my sweet Alice,” replied her father;
“the man doubtless acted but as he was told to act, and,
indeed, the whole demeanour of Lord Danemore this
morning shows that these ungenerous actions are his,
not those of the mere tools he employs. But I am
grieved for the dangerous situation in which this rash
young man has placed himself; for though the first
blow is all that is to be attributed to him, and the more
severe injuries the man has received proceeded from his
being trodden under foot by the people—”
Alice covered her eyes with her hands, and gave a
slight shudder at the image thus presented to her sight;
and her father, seeing the effect his words had produced,
turned to the more immediate matter of which he had
to speak. In fact, he had but dwelt upon the collateral
part of the business, from an unwillingness to approach
things that he thought would be more personally painful
to his daughter. Feeling that it must be done, however,
he now went On.
“Well, well, Alice,” he continued, “I will not speak
of these horrible things any more, though what I have
to say may be equally painful. I am afraid, my dear
child, that in the course of to-morrow" we shall have a
new visit from this sheriff’s Office . He knows from
all that has passed that I will not resist the law, and
that my doors will never be shut in order to avoid its
execution. Under these circumstances he is sure to

pursue his object, and, consequently, I must in some way
be prepared to meet him. The sacrifice of the small
fortune you possess independent of me, which that ras-
cally lawyer proposed to you some nights ago, your
father must now propose himself, however painful it may
be to him.”
“Thank you, thank you, my dear father,” exclaimed
Alice, throwing her arms around his neck, “you cannot
think how happy you make me.”
“But, alas, my dear child,” continued Sir Walter,
“this is not all. What you can supply will but be a
part; I must instantly be prepared with a much larger
sum ; the house must be stripped of its paintings, all our
old favourite horses must know other masters, the plate
must be sold; even the carriages and the furniture, ex-
cept merely that of those rooms which we inhabit, must
fetch what they may. The shelves of my library must
be emptied; ay, Alice, and even more, for even this will
not be enough. Your mother's jewels, my sweet girl,
those jewels which were always destined for yourself.
which are, indeed, yours by right, they too must go to
adorn strangers.” - -
Alice's heart was very full, and the tears would fain
have rushed up into her eyes; but the resolute deter-
mination of a woman's mind, when roused by noble mo-
tives to a great effort, will triumph over mental as well
as bodily pangs, and bear them as if they existed not.
By a sharp struggle Alice repressed the fountain of her
tears, for she knew that the slightest sign of reluctance
would add to the anguish of her father's heart; that to
give way to her own sorrow would more than double
his. Not a tear ther, stained her cheek, and she only
replied, “What better use could they be put to, my fa-
ther, than to avert such a painful event as that which
you expect? As jewels, of course, I care not for them,
and only think of them as my mother's; but I know how
willingly that dear mother would have sacrificed them
to buy you one moment's comfort, and I will only ask
for one ring as a remembrance, if it makes no difference;
the ring which she always wore.”
She spoke calmly, though not cheerfully; but Sir
Walter knew all that was passing in his daughter's
heart as well as if he could have seen its movements,
and the gentle restraint she put upon herself affected
him, perhaps, more than her tears would have done

He pressed her hands in his, and then turned to the win
dow to conceal his emotion.
The sun had just set, and the sky was still full of
light, though half way between the horizon—where the
deep blue distance cut upon the bright golden expanse
of the heavens—and the zenith—where the orange hues
melted into rich purple—there hung a dark heavy cloud.
Alice had followed her father to the window, and both,
as they gazed upon the expanse before them, suffered
imagination to find an image in the scene. Sir Walter
thought that the warm golden space below resembled
the past years of his existence; that the dark cloud
looked like his present fate; and that the purple sky
above was that far land beyond the grave to which his
footsteps were rapidly hastening. His daughter's was
a more hopeful vision; and, with her, fancy reversed
the objects. The calm purple sky over their heads was
the sweet tranquil past; the dark cloud was, indeed, the
present; but in the golden light beyond she saw a future
of warm happy days. There was an indistinct feeling,
however, in her mind, that her father read the sight less
cheerfully, and she told him what she thought it was
like.
Sir Walter sighed, but he would not check her by
giving the more melancholy picture; and, even as she
spoke, the wind moved the heavy cloud slightly to the
east, and in the midst of the bright and intense light be-
low burst forth a clear brilliant star, outshining all the
splendour that surrounded it. -
“There, there !” cried Alice, with all the enthusiasm
of a young and ardent heart, finding in that sight fresh
auguries of hope. “There, there!”
Her father turned and pressed her to his heart, only
replying, “May it be so, beloved; may it be so.”
The rest of the evening passed, till about ten o'clock
at night, in making various painful arrangements for ef-
fecting what Sir Walter had proposed. He had calcu
lated that, between ten and eleven o'clock, his servant
Halliday would return with the lawyer and the jeweller
whom he had sent for; and when, about half past ten,
the bell at the great gates was rung, he doubted not
that it gave notice of their arrival. One of the other
servants, however, appeared a few minutes afterward,
and with a grave face and a manner that seemed to
court interrogation, he announced that two strange men
demanded to see Sir Walter.

“I suppose Master Evelyn has not been able to come
himself,” said the knight, “and has sent some of his
clerks. Show them in.”
The man proceeded to obey, but, when the door
opened, with grief and astonishment Sir Walter beheld
the face of John Bolland, who was followed by another
person of the same stamp.
“How is this, sir,” exclaimed the knight, “how is
this ? You know very well that it is not legal to execute
an arrest for debt after sunset, and I am even now ma-
king preparations for paying this sum to-morrow morn-
ing.”
“Ay, you see, Sir Walter,” replied Bolland, with an
air of cool insolence, “that may suit your purpose very
well, but it won’t suit mine, for I’m to have a hundred
guineas, you see, if I arrest you before twelve o'clock
to-night.” -
Alice clung to her father with a pale cheek and a
heart through which the blood seemed to force itself
with pain; but Sir Walter pressed her hand, saying,
“Do not be alarmed, Alice; this act is illegal, and I
shall certainly resist it. You are, sir,” he continued,
turning to Bolland with a frowning brow, “you are en-
gaged at this moment, as you very well know, in an
illegal attempt, and you may consider it as more owing
to my respect for myself than to your situation that I
do not order the servants to throw you out of the win-
dow.”
“Not quite so illegal as you may think, Sir Walter,”
replied Bolland; “the caption was made this morning,
be so good as to recollect. I then had my right hand
upon your shoulder and the writ in my left. That was
at a legal hour, I take it, Sir Walter; and your being
rescued by a mob has nothing to do with the matter.
I am responsible for you to the sheriff; I came here
not to arrest you, but to claim my prisoner; and if you
resist, it is at your peril.”
Sir Walter pressed his daughter to his bosom and
bent down his head. “I am afraid, my child,” he said,
“that what this man alleges is but too true.”
Alice replied nothing for a moment or two; but then,
gently disengaging herself from her father's arms, she
took two or three steps towards the officer, and, gazing
earnestly in his face, she demanded, “You are not
‘surely going to take my father out of his own house at
this time of night"

“Why, I must do my duty, young mistress,” replied
the man; “and as I sha’n’t get paid unless I have him in
quod to-night, I'm afraid he must budge.”
“Oh! my dear father, my dear father,” exclaimed
Alice, turning to Sir Walter, “all that this man wants
is money. What is a hundred pounds to your comfort?
We have more than that in the house, a good deal more,
I know. Give him the hundred pounds he wants, and
he will come back to-morrow for the rest, when you
have settled everything and are ready to pay it.”
“No, Alice, never,” replied Sir Walter; “I will never
so countenance extortion and villany. I should be un-
worthy of the respect and esteem of any one were I to
do it; as unworthy as he who has already offered him
that sum for worse purposes. No, my child, no; I will
go, however hitter it may be. I will not sink myself in
my own esteem. All I ask, sir, is time to write a letter
to my lawyer in case he does not arrive to-night before
I go, and to put some papers of importance in order.”
“Well,” answered Bolland, “I’ve no objection to that.
I suppose you'd like to travel in your own coach; so,
while the horses are putting to, you can give me and
my friend here a bit of supper, and do what you like,
provided you give us your word of honour that you’ll
come back here within the hour. I always like to deal
gentlemanly with a gentleman, and am not so hard a
man as many would make me out.”
Sir Walter pledged himself as was required, and, ta-
king his daughter by the hand, he left the room, up and
down which Bolland continued to walk, whistling the
air of an indecent song, and commenting with some
taste upon the pictures, till two or three servants
brought in the supper he had demanded, eying him,
while they laid it out, as if they would much rather
have beaten him to a mummy than provided him with
food. He sat down, however, with perfect carelessness,
helped himself liberally to beef and ale, and encouraged
his companion to partake. Shortly after the sound of a
horse's feet was heard passing by, and the servant Hal-
liday &re long thrust his head into the room, gazing upon
the two officers with a very menacing countenance. He
said nothing, however, but retired and shut the door.
When about three quarters of an hour had passed,
and Bolland was beginning to get somewhat impatient,
he door again opened, and Alice glided in, clad in a

travelling dress. “You have, of course, no objection,
sir,” she said, approaching the Officer, “to my accom-
panying my father!”
“Why, I never object to anything in reason, my young
mistress,” replied the man; “you see, for all such things
we have a regulation, which is, that, when civility is
shown, civility money should be given.”
“Only tell me what you demand,” she said; “and, if
it be in my power, you shall have it.”
The man gazed in her face for a moment, as if calcu-
lating how much he should ask, and then replied, “Why,
five guineas is about the fee; but I should think a young
lady like you would find a prison a poor place to be in.”
“So will my father find it,” replied Alice, sadly; “and
I should find a palace a poor place if I were away from
him at such a moment of care and anxiety; but I intend
to take a woman-servant with me, of course.”
“Oh, that will be a guinea more, then,” answered
the hard-hearted man, with a shrewd wink to his fol
lower; “if you will do it like gentlefolks, you must
pay for it.”
Alice made no reply, for she well knew that she was
imposed upon, but was yet determined to submit to the
imposition; and, drawing forth her purse, she paid the
money demanded at once, to have it over before her fa-
ther entered the room. -
It was scarcely done when he appeared, but she had
already obtained his unwilling consent to her going, and
he only said, “I wish you could be dissuaded, my Al-
ice; you do not know what you undertake.”
Several of the servants had followed him into the
room, as well as the maid who was to accompany her
mistress; and Sir Walter placed a letter in the hand of
Halliday, saying calmly, “Let that go to Master Evelyn
by daybreak to-morrow. He might, perhaps, have saved.
me much pain if he had come over to-night. My good
friends,” he added, addressing the servants with that
calm fatherly suavity of manner which, though it had
deserted him two or three days before, when the prin-
cipal facts of his pecuniary situation were first brought
to his notice, was now completely restored. “My good
friends, keep all together in your master's absence, for
I trust. I shall soon return to you again. I think I need
not bid you, who have been such good and faithful ser-
Yants to me for many *: keep an orderly and eco-

nomical household till I return. I believe there is not
one of you who would feel at any time disposed to riot
or intemperance, but certainly not during your master's
absence, under such circumstances as those in which
you now see me.”
One or two of them murmured something in a low
voice, but there were tears in the eyes of all, and, amid
kind but ineffectual wishes, Sir Walter and his daughter
descended to the courtyard and entered the carriage,
which was already prepared. There was something in
the old knight's demeanour which did not suffer the im-
pudence even of Bolland to go too far; and when he,
and his daughter, and the maidservant had entered the
coach, the officer approached the side, saying, “I’ll tell
you what, Sir Walter, it's customary with us to go in
the carriage with our prisoners, if they have a carriage;
but, as I dare say you'd like better to go by yourself,
we'll mount our horses and return as we came.”
Sir Walter bowed his head without reply. The door
was shut, and with slow and solemn pace, as if unwil-
ling to perform their task, the four strong horses which
had been harnessed to the ponderous vehicle dragged it
forth from the courtyard, and, taking the lower road
through the park, bent their way towards the county
town. When they had gone about half a mile, the clock
of Moorhurst Church, which they were leaving behind
them, was heard, clear and distinctly, striking twelve.
“Bear witness, John,” cried Bolland to the man who
followed with him on horseback behind the carriage;
“bear witness that I had him out of his own house be-
fore twelve o'clock; so that I've fairly won the money.
Take care, Master Coachman, how you drive,” he
shouted, “for the night is as dark as pitch.”
“I drove this road before your father was hanged,”
growled the coachman, “and I trust to drive it after
you're hanged a foot higher than he was.”
In the mean while, of all the party in the carriage,
perhaps Sir Walter was the least sad. His spirits had
rallied wonderfully now that the worst was over; and,
sitting with his daughter's hand in his, he talked even
cheerfully of the means of extricating himself from his
present difficulties. All the little legal knowledge that
he possessed was called up, and he said that he doubted
not to be easily able to obtain good bail at the county
town, which would give him plenty of time to effect the

sale that he proposed, without the great loss attendant
upon more hurried proceedings, even if Langford should
not be set at liberty before that time, and the money
which the earl had detained restored.
Of Langford's situation, too, he spoke cheerfully, in
order to cheer his daughter; and, as her hand lay in his,
she also made a great effort to appear tranquil, though
more than once, under cover of the darkness, she suf
fered the silent tears to stream down her cheeks, and
found therein substantial relief.
Their journey was necessarily very slow; and thougl
the distance from Moorhurst to the town was not more
than fourteen miles, and a full hour had elapsed since
their departure, they had not proceeded one third of the
way, when a red light began to spread over the sk
above them, increasing every moment in intensity #
every part of the sandy lane, through which they were
dragged slowly along, became plainly visible to their
eyes.
In vain they wasted conjectures as to what this could
mean; they had no means of discovering; and the
strong light still continued for nearly an hour. It was
beginning slightly to abate when they traversed the far-
ther end of the moor, about two miles beyond the spot
where the affray had taken place in the morning. They
then entered a road between high banks, where the
blaze, though dimmed, suffered them to see their way
very plainly, when suddenly the horses heads were
seized, and a loud voice cried “Stop!”
Sir Walter smiled as he heard it, saying to two men
who had presented themselves, pistol in hand, at the
side of the vehicle, “You will get little here, my good
friends, for I am now, alas! a prisoner for debt.”
“We know that,” replied one of the men, much to
the knight's surprise, “and we don’t want your money,
but we want the carriage. You must get out as fast as
possible. Quick, Master Coachman, down from your
box! If you don’t get horses off faster, we shall
cut the traces! Take those two fellows behind,” added
the same voice, “and tie them where I told you.”
According to the peremptory orders they had re-
ceived, Sir Walter, his daughter, and the maid issued
forth, and found themselves surrounded by a number of
men all strongly armed, while some horses stood near,
wn a field on the top of the bank, with a group of other

persons beside them. The gentry who had stopped the
carriage seemed to take very little heed of those it had
contained, and to be in urgent haste. The only further
words that were addressed to the group from Moorhurst
were by the man who had first spoken, and who, like
the rest, had something drawn over his face so as com.
pletely to conceal its features. --
“Move farther off,” he said. “Take up your position
under that bank, and do not stir from it till we are gone.”
The same personage then aided with his own hands
in unharnessing the horses which had brought them;
and he then turned the beasts loose, much to the dis-
may of the coachman. Four others were immediately
attached to the carriage with the speed of lightning,
and the same voice then exclaimed, “Now come down.”
Two women, one of whom bore a child in her arms,
instantly descended by a path down the bank, and, with-
out speaking, entered the carriage. “Now two of you,”
said the voice again, “carry him down. Put your
hands under his arms to prevent hurting him.”
No sooner were these words spoken than another
part of the group at the top of the bank began to move
slowly down; but no sooner had it reached the bottom
of the bank, than a new voice said, in a weak but some-
what haughty tone, “I can walk very well now ; take
away your hands. I can walk quite well.” With a
sudden movement, Alice took two steps forward, and
saw a man advancing to the carriage between two
others, who seemed to wish to give him assistance and
support against his will. Without uttering a word, she
grasped the arm of the maid, and drew her a step for
ward, pointing with her finger.
“Good God!” exclaimed the woman. But a quick
gesture from her mistress stopped her from saying
more. Two or three other persons got into the carriage.
All the rest mounted their horses, except one, who
sprang upon the box. The vehicle drove rapidly off,
and Sir Walter, his daughter, and the two servants
were left alone in the road, for, on looking round for
Bolland and his follower, they could see them nowhere,

CHAPTER II.
IT was night again, nearly approaching to midnight,
and the Earl of Danemore sat alone in the small dark
wainscoted room immediately beneath the chamber
which had been assigned to the prisoner. More than
once he had called his attendants to ask impatiently if
the lawyer had returned; and as the clock in the great
hall struck eleven without his appearance, he ordered
several of the servants to go out in different ways to
seek him, forbidding them to return without bringing
word of where he was, and what had been the result of
his proceedings during the day.
Solitude, a quick imagination, violent passions, and
dangerous designs, all combined to produce a state of
anxiety and impatience bordering upon phrensy. Now
he sat with his head leaning on his hand, gazing expec-
tant at the door; now he strode up and down with his
arms crossed upon his chest, and his bosom full of deep
but rapid thoughts; now he paused and listened either
to the footsteps of the prisoner, as with a calmer
and less irregular stride Langford paced up and down
in the room above, or to the sighing of the strong wind
as it whistled round and round the high tower in which
both chambers were situated.
At length, after having listened to the steps for some
time, and then gazed intently on the ground in deep
meditation, he seemed to be seized by a sudden reso-
lution, and advanced at once to the door which opened
on the stairs leading to the apartments above.
“I will go up to him !” he said; “I will confront him
boldly ! I will speak over the whole theme ! I will
dare every painful subject ! He shall not says that I
feared to encounter anything, or to grapple with any
enemy among the living or the dead. He shall never
say that I was a coward in thought, or word, or deed,
or that I feared boldly to meet aught that could be -
urged against me. I will go, and, brow to brow, tell him a
what he has brought upon his head!”
His first steps up the stairs were rapid and vehement;
those that he took after were more slow; and at the

door of Langford's room he paused once more and
thought. As he did so pause, he could distinctly hear
the prisoner cast himself somewhat heavily into a chair,
hum a few words of an old ballad, and, as it were, se-
duced by the music, go on with the song in a louder
tone, and with a clear, mellow, and not uncultivated
voice. He sang one of the sweet and simple airs of
Lulli, which had a touch of melancholy, mingling, one
scarcely knew how or where, with the general cheer-
fulness of the strain; but the English words which were
adapted to it were even more gay than the music.
Strange to say, however, Langford thought not at all
of the words that he was singing, nay, nor of the
music itself. While he did sing his thoughts were busy,
deeply busy upon other things; and the music was but
a mechanical application of the animal part of his na-
ture to the sweetest of all arts, in order to obtain some
soothing and tranquillizing power to calm his spirit ere
he lay down to rest.

The dew is on each leaf and flow'r,
The sky is full of light;
Beauty and brightness mark the hour
That parts the day and night.

Raise up those beaming eyes,
To find an answering look above,
An image in the skies.
The lark! the lark: thine own sweet lark,
Pours forth his thrilling lay;
And all that's cold, and all that’s dark,
Fly from the porch of day.
Wake up! wake up! my own sweet love!
Raise up those beaming eyes,
To find an answering look above,
An image in the skies.
There's music ready for thine ear,
There's perfume on the breeze;
Wake up, and add to all that's dear,
What's dearer than all these. -
Wake up ! wake up ! my own sweet love
Raise up those beaming eyes,
To find an answering look above,
An image in the skies.

According to the differences of our different natures,
there is for each man's heart a key, as it were, to be
found in some one of the senses. With one man it is
the grosser sense of the palate, and the things that he
has tasted; the cup that he has drank in particular lands
and scenes will, when again met with, carry back the
mind to earlier days, and the feelings thereof, the affec-
tions, the hopes, the fears, will crowd upon him like
phantoms from the grave, conjured up by objects that
seem to have no apparent connexion with them.
To others, again, certain sweet odours, the perfume
of a flower, or the mingled sweetness of the morning's
breath, will have the same effect. While to others, the
sight of some peculiar effect of light and shade, and to
others a strain of music, a tone of voice, the carol of a
bird, or the living hum of morning, will call up scenes
long past, reawaken memories and affections that have
slumbered for years, and give us back the gentleness of
our youth.
But when the chord of association is thus struck, let
the sensations produced be joyful or be melancholy,
there is something in the first bursting forth of the past
upon the present, there is something in the rapid draw-
ing back of the dim curtain of years from between our
actual feelings and the feelings long lost, too thrilling
to be experienced without deep emotion; and our nat- *
ural impulse is to melt in tears.
The earl stood and listened while Langford sung; and
the deep mellow tone of his voice, the well-remembered
air of Lulli, the words which, though he heard them
not distinctly, he knew by heart, all served to unchain.
the long-fettered feelings of his better days; the stern
heart was bent, the proud, impetuous, revengeful spirit
was softened for the moment, and the old man's eyes
glistened with unwonted dew. It lasted but for a mo-
ment. Habit and circumstance reassumed their sway;
and, with a slight stamp of the foot, he drew up his
head, which had been bent down under the influence of
manifold emotions, and entered the room in which the
prisoner sat.
Langford turned in some surprise to discover who it
was that came to visit him at so late an hour, and his
astonishment was not diminished on perceiving the earl,
who advanced into the room with £ £
even more than usual by the angry effort he had made

to conquer what he believed to be the weakness of his
own heart. He paused for a moment on the side of the
table opposite to Langford, gazing at him sternly but si-
lently, as if scarcely prepared to begin the explanation
he had sought.
Langford returned his glance calmly and gently, flinch-
ing not the least beneath his eye, but gazing in return
with a look expressive rather of inquiry than of any other
feeling. At length, as the earl still continued silent, he
spoke, saying, “Your lordship, I conclude, has some-
thing to communicate to me, and I fear, from your coun.
tenance, that it is not of a pleasant nature. I am very
glad, however, that you have come, as there is one sub-
ject on which it is necessary that I should speak to you,
and I am led to believe that the moments in which I can
do so are drawing to a close.”
“You do well to believe so, sir,” replied the earl;
“the moments in which any communication can take
place between us are, as you say, drawing to a close;
they are few and short. You are right also in suppo-
sing that I have something to tell you, otherwise I
should not have sought you. What I have to tell, how-
ever, requires but few words; it is, that I know you.”
“I am glad to hear it, my lord,” replied Langford,
with perfect calmness; “as, if you really do know me,
you vill know, as I believe you do know, that the charge
nrought against me is false, if not absurd. But, in the
first instance, it will be better to show me that you real-
ly do know me.”
The earl gazed upon him with his keen large eyes
full of meaning, and then demanded, “Before you ever
entered these gates, have you not twice written to me?”
“I have,” replied Langford.
“Twice,” continued the earl, “you have demanded
that to which you have no right; and now the object
of your coming hither is not less clearly known to me
than all your former proceedings. But, in a word, I ask
you, is not your name of Langford a false one? Are
you not he whom men call the Chevalier de Beaulieu?”
“I am,” replied Langford; “but as your lordship has
accused me of demanding that to which I have no right,
let me reply at once that I have a right, the strongest
and the greatest! Has not every member of a noble
family a right to demand that any unjust stain cast
* thereon should be removed Have not I especially.

charged as I was by the dying breath of my noble rela-
tion the Marquis de Beaulieu never to cease my exer-
tions to recover the means of taking a stain from our
honour; have not I especially a right, I say, to demand
those papers at your hands, which afford the only possi-
ble method of doing so t”
“I say no!” replied the earl, sternly; “I say no!
even if the papers whereof you speak existed, I say—”
But Langford interrupted him more vehemently than
he had ever before spoken. “My lord,” he said, “those
papers do exist, or you have not only broken your most
solemn vow, but your plighted word of honour as a gen
tleman. Your vow, my lord, you perhaps might break,
for in one instance at least you did break it, and a noble
heart along with it; but I would not believe you to be
the being who would forfeit your plighted honour, no,
not to gain a kingdom ! Unsay those words which cast
so foul a doubt, if not an imputation upon you! and let
me know, that though in the current of your fiery pas-
sions you may have scrupled not to wring the hearts
and destroy the hopes of others, do not leave me to be-
lieve that you have deliberately pledged your word and
then have broken it. No, no ! my lord, I know that
those papers are not destroyed !”
The traces of contending passions came over the
countenance of Lord Danemore like the shadows of dark
clouds carried over the landscape by a rapid wind; and,
while Langford spoke, it seemed sometimes as if he felt
inclined to strike him to the earth; sometimes as if a
strange and unwilling admiration took possession of him
and restrained his anger. “You are a bold and daring
man,” he said, in reply; “but you have spoken the truth.
The papers are not destroyed, though I do not admit
their contents to be such as you may imagine.”
“Thank you, my lord, thank you,” replied Langford,
earnestly; “thank you for clearing yourself from the
painful doubt in which you involved your character.
Though you may have bitterly wronged my family, still
I take a deeper interest than you know in seeing your
honour pure in this respect at least. In regard to the
papers,” he continued, with a slight change of tone, “if
they were not such as I believe, you could have no rea-
sonable objection to give them to me. If they are such
as I believe, they are necessary to the honour of my
family; and deputed as I am by every member of that

family to claim them at your hands, I demand them,
not as a concession, but as a right. But, at the same
time, I offer now, as I offered before, to pledge myself,
in order to remove all evil and dangerous consequences
to yourself, that those papers shall never be made pub-
lic in England; shall only be so far recorded in France
as to clear the honour of our race, and shall then be ut-
terly destroyed.”
A scornful and bitter smile came upon the lip of the
earl as he whom we shall still call Langford uttered
these words. “You are mistaken,” he replied, sternly;
“you are altogether mistaken. I trust myself in the
power of no one; and even the very words that you ut-
tered yesterday have put between you and me a barrier
which can never be passed.” -
“I know not to what words your lordship alludes,”
replied Langford. “Nothing that I have said, nothing
that I have done, ought to put any such barrier between
us. Most careful have I been, in no respect, either in
conversation with yourself or others, to cast an imputa-
tion upon you.”
“It may be so,” replied the earl; “it may be so; but,
nevertheless, clearly and distinctly, I refuse you those
papers. Now, sir,” he continued, with the same bitter
smile, “now, sir, use your threats. Now, sir, let me
know what tale you will tell if I do not accede to your
demands. Now, sir, let me know whether you and
yours will travel to Florida to seek for matter against
me!”
“Your lordship is altogether wrong,” replied Lang-
ford. “That I know your history well in every partic-
ular and in every point is true, but that I will divulge
any part of it that might do you injury, except that part
which it is necessary to the honour of our race should
be divulged, is not only far from my intention, but nev-
er should take place, even if your lordship should con-
tinue your refusal to give up those papers and to do the
act of justice that is demanded at your hands.”
“Indeed!” exclaimed the earl, pondering; “indeed!
then why did you refer to matters which should be
buried in the deep silence of long-gone years?”
“Accident had some share in my so doing,” replied
Langford, “and a wish to lead your mind back to the
past had also a part therein. But at once to show you,
my lord, that I am inclined to take no advantage, and

to pursue my course as uprightly and honourably as
possible, let me now tell you that I not only know of
the existence of those papers, but know also well where
they are preserved, and could, while here, have made my-
self master of them at once had I been inclined to take
that by private means which I demand openly!”
As he spoke he pointed to the small carved door in
the oak panelling, and the earl's eyes followed the di-
rection of his hand, but with no expression of surprise.
His lip, at the same time, curled with a bitter sneer,
and he replied at once, “I am not inclined to believe in
the communication of miraculous knowledge to any of
us poor mortals nowadays, and therefore doubt not that
your information has been derived from some source
less than supernatural. There is in this house, sir, a
woman called Bertha, brought up by the family of Beau-
lieu from her youth, and retaining for them still a deep
veneration and regard, although a quarrel with one of
that race induced her to leave them and enter into my
service. The attachment that she showed to myself
and family through many years have taught me to trust
her deeply; but when I found that she placed, on the
idle pretext of greater security, a stranger accused of
dark crimes into a chamber reserved entirely for my-
self, I began to doubt her; when, added to that, I found
that she held frequent private conferences with him,
my doubts increased; and when I found that she brought
others to communicate with him, contrary to my ex-
pressed will, my doubts grew into certainties.”
“Under such circumstances,” replied Langford, fixing
his eyes inquiringly upon the earl’s countenance, “un-
der such circumstances you have, of course, discharged
that woman from your service.”
“Not so, sir,” replied the earl, “not so. It may be
my purpose to punish as well as to dismiss; but, ere I
do either, I shall take care to learn in what degree she
has betrayed me. But to turn, sir, from your idle affec-
tation of insight into my secrets to your equally empty
boast cf power, let me tell you, that, though you may
have been placed in a room reserved for years to my-
self, and though in that room all my most private pa.
pers may be preserved, you are as impotent to get pos-
session of them as a blind man to tell the hour by the
Sundial.” -
“My lord, you are mistaken,” replied Langford, calm-

ly; “I am not so powerless in that respect as you im:
agine. I have had them now for two days at my will
and pleasure to take or to leave. I have them now at
my disposal; but I had determined to use all gentle and
reasonable means first, to urge you by every persuasion
to do justice, and only in the end to do myself right in
your presence and before your face. You have come
now most opportunely, and I will not suffer the occa-
sion to pass; but, in the first instance, let me once more
entreat you to do a tardy act of justice ere you force
me to things most unpleasant to me.”
The earl had gazed upon him as he spoke with an
expression of some surprise and doubt, so tranquilly
confident was the tone and manner of one whom he had
believed to be entirely in his power. At the last words,
however, his brow gathered again into a frown, and he
replied, “I am not to be menaced, sir; I tell you you
shall never have them; and such menace puts them
farther from your reach than ever.”
“My lord, I use no menaces,” replied Langford; “my
wish, my only wish, is to persuade you. Oh consider,
sir! Here you now stand at the verge of age, touching
upon that cold season when the only consolation for
declining years, the wintry sunshine of our being's
close, is a clear conscience and the memory of good
deeds. If, alas! you are deprived of the power of look-
ing back upon many such actions—nay, hear me out-
if there be in the past much that is painful, much that
you would feign forget, much that can never be repair-
ed, remember, oh remember ! that what cannot be re-
paired may often be atoned. Thus, in one instance at
least, the means of atonement are in your own power,
and to seize upon them in every instance is the only
means to bring back even a portion of that calm seren-
ity of heart which once you knew in days of innocence
but which I feel too sure has long departed from you,
bosom.”
“Sir, I never knew it,” burst forth the earl; “my
life has been made up of passions and regrets, and, as it
began, so shall it close!” -
“Oh no, my lord! oh no!” cried Langford; “let it
not be so! I must wring your heart, but I trust it may
be in some degree to heal it. You lately had a son
whom you loved deeply; for his sake, I believe, you
have persisted for years in a course of injustice which

the nobler part of your nature, I am sure, disavowed.
My lord, he has been taken from you. The inducement
to remain in wrong has been removed by the will of
God, who therein has at once punished and opened the
way to atonement. Let me beseech you, let me en-
treat of you, not to suffer this opportunity to pass un-
noticed. Do tardy justice, and, instead of hardening
yourself to crush and to injure one who could love
you well, and against whom you can never succeed,
think of what a satisfaction it will be to you when, from
your own deathbed, you look back and see that you
have done all to repair a great wrong that you com-
mitted.” *
“And do you make the assassination of my son,” de-
manded the earl, “a plea for my gratifying one who is
accused of murdering him?”
“My lord, I have taken it for granted throughout,”
replied Langford, “that you know me to be perfectly
innocent of that deed. What I demand of you also I
have a right to demand. I ask you not to gratify me,
but to do an act of justice; I ask of you to do honour
to yourself, by taking away a stain from an honourable
house that you have wronged.”
“Right?” exclaimed the earl, with one of his dark
sneers, as if the recollection of something he had before
intended to say came suddenly back upon him; “In
what consists your right? and how have you any con-
nexion with the honour of the family of Beaulieu? Do
you suppose that I am blind or stupid? Answer me !
If you are so near and honourably akin to the dead Mar-
quis of Beaulieu, how are you not the heir of his title
and estates? What right has his bastard to prate of
the honour of his family?”
The blood rushed rapidly into Langford's cheek; his
eye flashed and his brow contracted; but it was only
for a moment. With what was evidently a great effort,
he mastered his own passions immediately, and replied, .
“The coarse term you have used is inapplicable to me,
Lord Danemore. Your other question, as to why I
have not succeeded, I could answer by a single word if
I so pleased; and, did I feel as much assured of your
son's death as you do, I would so answer it.”
“Doubtless, doubtless!” exclaimed the earl, impa-
tiently; “everything can doubtless be explained if cer-
tain ifs and buts be removed. But I tell you, sir, till

they are removed I shall listen to you no farther; nor
shall I detain you long, for I came to tell you what may
be told in a few words. Mark me, young man! There
are certain memories called up by your looks and by
your voice which might have moved me to the weak-
ness of sparing you, had you not been foolish enough
to show me that, like a winged insect which we are
forced to crush, you can sting as well as buzz. You
have yet to learn that I live in the fear of no man; and
that, when once any one has shown me that he may be
dangerous to me, the struggle commences between us
which ends but with the life of one or the other. There
is already sufficient proof against you to bring you to
the gibbet; more will not be wanting, or I am mistaken;
but I would have you know that your fate is of your
own seeking, and that, when you and yours spied out
and investigated the actions of my early life, you raised
up the scaffold for yourself. To-morrow you will be
taken hence; a jail will then receive you. A public
trial and public execution will be the end which you
have obtained by measuring yourself against one who
never yet failed in the accomplishment of that for which
he strove.”
As the earl spoke he turned as if to leave the apart.
ment; but Langford, who had listened calmly and atten-
tively, exclaimed, ere he laid his hand upon the door,
“Stay yet one moment, my lord; our conference is not
finished yet. With regard to your urging against me
an accusation which you know to be false, either from
motives of hatred, revenge, or fear, you will reconcile
that to your own conscience as you can. You will fail
in your attempt; but if you did succeed, you would pile
upon your head coals of fire which would consume your
very heart to ashes! The matter on which I now de-
tain you is these papers. I am not accustomed to say I
will do what I cannot do; therefore, when I told you
that, if you did not do justice, I would with my own
hand right myself and my family, I made no vain
boast.”
The earl turned and gazed upon him both in surprise
and anger; but his rage and his astonishment were
doubled when the prisoner took from his pocket the
key, the easily-recognised key, which had been given
to him by Franklin Gray upon the moor. Prompt,
however, and decided in all his determinations, the earl

instantly raised his voice, and shouted in a tone of thun-
der to the servants whom he had that morning ordered
to remain without.
“My lord,” said Langford, “you raise your voice in
vain. I have every reason to believe that the persons
you placed there have been gone for more than an
hour; and, even if they were there still, those bolts and
that lock would prevent them from entering. Of that I
have taken care.”
Even while he spoke the earl had strode across the
room towards the outer door, muttering, “They shall
soon return;” but the key of the door between the two
rooms, which had been left in the inside, was now gone;
and, after gazing upon lock and bolt with impotent rage
for a moment, he turned fiercely towards the other
door, which led by the stairs in the turret down to his
apartments below. Langford, however, had seized the
moment, and, casting himself in the way, was in the
act of locking that door also when the earl turned to-
wards it.
Lord Danemore instantly drew his sword; but Lang-
ford was not unarmed, as he had supposed. His own
blade, which had been restored to him by the half-witted
man, John Graves, was in his hand in a moment; but
it was only to show himself prepared that he used it,
for, waving the earl back with his hand, he exclaimed,
“My lord, do nothing rashly . Remember you have
to deal with a younger, stronger, more active man than
yourself, and with one long accustomed to perils and
dangers. Stand back and answer me. Will you or
will you not give up those papers by fair means, or
must I take them myself!”
“I will never give them,” replied the earl; “I will
never give them, though that vile and treacherous wo-
man has not only betrayed my trust, but stolen from
my private cabinet the key that you now hold; I will
never give them; and, if you take them, you shall take
my blood first, and die for spilling it.”
As he spoke he placed himself, with his drawn sword
still in his hand, between Langford and the small door
in the wainscot which we have mentioned several times
before.
Langford advanced upon him, but with the same de
gree of calm determination which, except during one
brief moment, he had displayed throughout their whole
VoI. II.–C

conference: “My lord,” he said, “you do the woman
Bertha wrong. This key was not obtained from her. I
beseech you to give way, for I am determined to use it.”
“Not while you and I both live!” replied the earl;
and, as he spoke, he made a sharp quick lunge at Lang-
ford's bosom. The other was prepared, however; his
sword met that of the earl in a moment, and parrying
the lunge, he grappled with his adversary, and at the
same moment wrenched the weapon from his grasp,
and, by an exertion of his great strength, removed him
from between himself and the door.
He had cast the sword he had mastered to the other
side of the room, and the earl seemed to hesitate for an
instant as to whether he should spring forward to re-
cover his weapon, or struggle with the prisoner to pre-
vent him from obtaining the papers. He felt while he
hesitated that the very hesitation was undignified. He
felt too, perhaps, that either attempt would be vain;
that he was in the presence of one superior to himself
in bodily power, in activity, in energy; one equal to
himself in courage, determination, promptitude; one
that was what he had been when a youth, but with the
grand superiority of mental dignity and conscious rec-
titude. He felt himself reproved and degraded, but not
humbled; and the natural movement proceeding from
such sensations was to cross his arms on his broad
chest, and stand with a look of dark defiance gleaming
from beneath his long gray eyebrows; while Langford,
taking the key in his right hand, and changing the
sword into his left, stood about to open the door which
covered all those mysterious points of his history which
he had so long concealed.
But even then his young companion paused. “Oh!
my lord,” he said, “I would fain have these papers with
your own will and consent. Again, again I ask you,
now that you see I have the power to take them, will
you give them to me? will you grant me that which is
my right to demand! Oh! Lord Danemore, if you ever
loved the race from which I spring; if ever human af-
fection and natural tenderness affected your bosom ; if
ever you had sympathy with others; if ever the strong-
est passion of our nature touched your heart, I adjure
you now, by the memory of the past, by the dark and
awful circumstances of the present, by the frowning fu-
ture, by the inevitable, interminable hereafter of wea)

or wo, to do that which you know to be right! at this
last, this fatal moment between you and me, to render
justice to those that you have wronged; to cast from
your soul the burden of old guilt, and to make atone-
ment for one out of the dark deeds of the past !”
He gazed upon him sternly, fixedly, earnestly; and
strong passion called up in the face of each a strange
likeness of expression; but the whirlwind of their emo-
tions was too strong for either to mark the clouds and
shadows, the light or the lightning that passed over the
countenance of the other. Urged into fury, thwarted,
disappointed, foiled, the earl had no longer any com-
mand over himself, and the only dignity he could as-
sume was that of disappointed scorn.
“Never, bastard!” he replied; “never! Take that
which you can ; secure that which is in your power!
Fly, if you can fly! Use your advantage to the utmost
if it can be used; but I swear by Heaven and by hell,
by all that is sacred and by all that is accursed, to fol-
low you henceforth and for ever unto the gates of
death; to devote life, and soul, and being, mind, and
thought, and energy, corporeal power, and worldly
wealth, and temporal influence, to your destruction;
and never, never to cease, till the dark, dread, intermi-
nable gulf have swallowed up one or both !”
Langford gazed at him with deep and intense earnest-
ness; and, while he did so, a thousand varied emotions,
each painful but each different, flitted in expression
across his countenance, and caused wavering irresolu-
tion to take the place of high and strong determination.
As the earl ended, however, the other looked at him
for a moment fixedly, while the peer stood with his
arms still crossed upon his chest, and a look of reso-
lute, unchangeable purpose marked in every line of that
dark but splendid countenance.
Emotions strong, but new and strange, overpowered
his youthful adversary; and casting from him the sword
which had successfully opposed him, and the key of all
the treasured secrets of his opponent's eventful life, he
sprang forward, as if with a sudden impulse which he
could not resist, cast himself at the earl's feet, and,
looking up in his face, embraced his knees. The stern
determination of the old man was shaken. Feelings
equally new, and strange, and unaccountable took pos-
session of his bosom also, and he strained his eyes upor

the noble form of him who knelt before him with sensa-
tions different from any that he had ever known in life.
At that moment, however, strange and unusual sounds
made themselves heard from without. There were cries
and screams, and the noise of many feet. Still kneel-
ing, Langford gazed upon the earl, and the earl upon
him; but, ere one could ask the other what this meant,
there was a violent rush against the outer door, as if by
people propelled by terror. The bolts, the bars, the
fastenings gave way, and, half torn from the hinges, it
burst into the room.
CHAPTER III.
WE must go back for a few hours. The sky was
without a star, and a dull heavy darkness brooded over
the face of the earth, as a strong party of horsemen-
whose numbers and appearance might well banish all
fears, and laugh to scorn all the tales of highwaymen
and footpads with which the county of then
rang—took its way down towards Danemore Castle,
and thence, passing under the walls of the park, pro
ceeded to the little borough of Moorhurst.
The part of the road on which they were at the mo-
ment when we must first speak of them passed between
two high banks of sand rock, overtopped with trees and
shrubs, so that, if there had been any light in the sky,
it would have been shut out from that spot; and the
person who rode at their head, and seemed to act as their
leader, chose the gloomiest point for the purpose of
causing the line to halt, and speaking a few words in a
low tone to each of his companions. They answered
in a whisper, as if the deep darkness and silence around
had its usual effect in producing awe; and, when each
had listened and replied, their leader once more ad-
vanced to the front, and they recommenced their jour-
ney two and two. Descending slowly from the moors,
they emerged into a more open country, and any one who
had been by the side of the road might have counted
their number as eleven, notwithstanding the darkness
of the night, and might also have observed that, gen-

erally speaking, they were tall and powerful men, and
sat their horses with a degree of ease and composure
only to be acquired by long acquaintance with the
saddle.
We have remarked before that the country in that
district is famous for little greens of an acre or two in
extent, generally shaded by some tall elms, and often
adorned by a bright gleaming pond. To one of these
the party that we speak of had advanced; and though
there was a cottage at the farther side of the green, all
was silent and still when the word to halt was suddenly
given, and the voice of the leader was heard in a low
tone, saying, “Spread out to the right and left under
the trees. I hear a horse's feet !”
The evörtition that he commanded was executed in a
moment with the most profound silence, each horseman
separating from his neighbour, and taking ground some
yards to the right and left, without any of that pawing
and prancing which gives pomp and circumstance to
many a military manoeuvre. The proceedings of the
leader himself, however, were even more remarkable;
for, advancing perhaps twenty yards before the rest, he
also left the road for the green turf, and then his dim
figure was seen to dismount. The next moment horse
and man seemed to sink slowly down into the earth,
and nothing but what appeared to be a small rise in the
ground was seen through the darkness, marking the
spot where they had stood.
While all this was taking place, the sound of a horse's
feet beating the road with a quick trot was heard ad-
vancing from that side towards which the party had
been going; and, after a pause of about two minutes, a
white horse, bearing his rider at a rapid rate, could be
discerned entering upon the green. The horseman ad-
vanced some way unconscious of the neighbourhood of
so many others, but apparently not quite insensible to
fear; for from time to time his head was turned round
on either side, and at length it would seem that he
caught a glance of something unusual beneath the elm
trees, for he suddenly pulled up his horse and gazed
anxiously on before him.
His eyes were keen, and had been for some time
habituated to the darkness; and, becoming convinced
that there was a considerable party assembled on either
side of the road, he was turning his bridle to gallop off
C 2

on the same road by which he came, when suddenly
what he had passed as a mere mound of earth and
bushes started up into life, and his retreat was cut off
by a man springing upon a horse, which rose as if ma-
gically from the ground, and darting into the road be-
fore him.
“Stop!” cried a stern voice, while the gleam of
something like a pistol in the hand of his opponent
made the rider of the white horse recoil. He looked
round, however, to see if there were no means of eva-
ding obedience to the command he had received; but by
this time he found that he was surrounded on all sides,
and that the way even to the low cottage by the side
of the common was cut off. At the same time the
command was repeated: “Stop, and give an account
of yourself!” *
The additional injunction, however, of “Give an ac-
count of yourself!” was rather satisfactory to the rider,
who perceived therein a sort of police tone rather than
that generally employed by the worthies whom he most
apprehended, and who, to the word “stop!” usually
added “deliver!”
He replied, then, with a greater degree of confidence,
saying, “I am a servant of the noble Earl of Dane-
more, and I am riding to the town of by his or-
ders on particular business.”
“Show me the badge upon your arm!” said the per-
son who had first spoken; but the servant was obliged
to acknowledge that he had come away in haste, and
had not his livery coat on.
“You have some cords,” said the same voice, address
ing one of the other horsemen. “Tie him, and bring
him along.”
In a moment the unfortunate groom found himself
seized and his arms pinioned behind his back, while a
still more disagreeable operation, that of tying his feet
and legs tight to the stirrups, was performed by another
of his captors, who dismounted for the purpose.
Not a word was spoken by any one but the leader of
the party; and when he saw that the commands he had
given were obeyed, he added, “Bring him up abreast
with me;” and then riding on at the same slow pace in
which they had been proceeding previous to the little
episode which had taken place, he asked several ques-
tions of his captive in a low voice.

“We shall soon see,” said he, “whether your account
of yourself is true or not, for we are going to the castle.
Now tell me, how long do you say you have left it !”
“About half an hour, sir,” replied the man, resuming
a certain degree of courage on finding that he was not
injured; “about half an hour, sir; and I can tell you
that my lord will be mighty angry when he finds you
have stopped me and brought me back. He will make
the house too hot to hold you, and the county too, that
I’ll warrant. You don’t know whom you have got to
deal with. He suffers no one to do anything but what
he likes.”
“Is the Earl of Danemore still up !” demanded the
stranger, calmly, taking not the slightest heed of the
other's intimation.
“Yes, that he is, and will not be in bed for these two
hours, as you will find to your cost, perhaps, when he
hears you have stopped me,” answered the groom, firm-
ly believing that what was awful to him was equally so
to every one else.
“Does he not usually go to rest sooner!” asked the
stranger again : “I understood that the whole house-
hold were required to be in bed by eleven, and I was
afraid that we might have to rouse the porter to give us
admittance.”
“Ay, he generally does go to bed at eleven,” answer-
ed the groom, “but he has not done so to-night. You
will have to rouse the porter, however, and most of the
other servants too; for old John came out, growling
and damning me, in his shirt when I made him open the
ates.”
ga: He must not damn us, though,” replied the other,
quietly, but in a tone which moved the groom's aston-
ishment even more than anything which had passed
before, so little reverence did his captors show either
for the awful name of the Earl of Danemore or any of
his dependants. As the other ceased, however, and did
not resume the conversation, he had no choice but to
accompany him in silence; and, followed by the whole
of the rest of the party, they proceeded slowly on the
road, which was evidently well known to the leader,
now winding in and out among the high banks and woods,
now crossing scattered pieces of the heath and moor-
land, till at length they arrived at that spot under the
walls of the park where, as we have mentioned in de-

scribing the forced journey of Langford, Danemore Cas
tle, with its wide extent of park and woods, became
first visible to the eye of any one travelling on the road
from Moorhust to the county town.
There the leader of the party halted, and, suffering
his hands to drop thoughtfully upon the saddle-bow,
he gazed up towards the spot where the castle stood.
At that dark hour, however, nothing was to be perceived
but the masses of tall trees with which the building it-
self was confounded in undistinguished shade, except,
indeed, where a single spot of light was seen gleaming
high up like a beacon, and marking that there was the
habitation of some human beings among the dark and
awful-looking blackness which the scene otherwise pre-
sented.
After thus gazing for a few minutes, the leader of the
party turned towards the groom, and, while he reined
back his horse to the other side of the road, said, with
something of a sneer, “We will save old John the por-
ter the trouble of opening the gate for us.” At the same
moment, the well-trained horse which he rode, feeling
a touch of the spur, started forward towards the wall,
cleared it with ease, and horse and rider stood within
the boundaries of the park.
“I can't leap with my hands and legs tied,” cried the
groom, whose first feelings were those of an equestri-
an; “that's impossible. I shall break my own neck
and the horse's knees.”
“You sha’n’t be required to leap,” was the reply of the
leader from the other side of the wall; and then, turning
towards one of his companions, he added, “You must
manage to pull it down, Harvey.”
“I will leap it first, however,” replied his companion,
and away went a second horse and man over the wall.
No sooner was this done than several of the other horse-
men dismounted, and with short bars of iron, which
each of them appeared to have slung at their saddle-bow,
they set to work upon the wall of the park, and in less
than a quarter of an hour the space of three yards was
laid level between the road and the park.
The whole of the troop then passed in, taking the
groom along with them; and, riding slowly up to a
clump of old chestnuts at the distance of about three
hundred yards from the terrace on which the mansion
stood, they gathered themselves together in a group

under the boughs, and their leader, advancing a few
paces, again gazed steadfastly upon the castle, whose
towers and pinnacles were now to be more clearly dis-
£ here and there above the trees, and
marking, with the straight lines of the older architec-
ture, or the light tracery of the more modern and orna-
mental parts, the sky beyond, over which a pale gleam
cast by the rising moon was just beginning to spread it-
Self.
Gradually, as he sat there on horseback, the beautiful
orb of night rose up from behind the trees, and with her
peculiar power of dispersing the clouds and shadows
that obstruct her way, she was seen struggling with and
overcoming the vapours of the night; sometimes, like a
veiled but still lovely countenance, beaming through a
thin film of white mist which grew radiant with her radi-
ance; sometimes hidden for a single instant behind a
dark mass which swept over her with gilded edges;
sometimes bursting forth from a black cloud with pure
effulgence, like sudden joy succeeding despair.
As he sat there, with the varying light of the moon
falling upon him, now casting his long shadow upon the
soft green turf of the park, now leaving him distinct,
and, as it were, magnified by the dim misty light, the
powerful form of that horseman was scanned eagerly
and apprehensively by the groom, on whose mind but
little doubt remained in regard to the character and pro-
pensities of the party whose unwilling companion he
had become. He thought he had never seen a more
powerful frame, and in so thinking he was right; but
the imagination of terror had a great deal to do with the
business when he called him in his heart “the most
ruffian-like fellow that his eyes had ever rested on.”
After about ten minutes contemplation, during which
not a word was spoken by any one, and not a sound
was heard but the low sighing of the wind through the
neighbouring trees, and the scream of the screechowls
which nested themselves in the old ivy of the castle,
the leader returned to his party, saying, “I would fain
have that light put out first; but, however, we cannot
stay wasting all our time here. Now, my good fellow,”
he continued, turning to the groom, “I want one or two
pieces of information from you; but, before you answer,
you had better take into consideration that you are
speaking to a person not willing to be trifled with; that,

If you do not answer straightforwardly and at once,
your life is not worth five minutes’ purchase; and that,
if you give me false information, you will be as surely
a dead man within two hours as you are now a living
one. In the first place, then, inform me in what part
of the house the servants sleep.”
“Why, up at the top to the westward,” replied the
man; “that is where the servingmen sleep; but there
are others, such as the sewers, and the grooms of the
chambers, who sleep at the top of Hubert's Tower.
Then there's my lord's own man sleeps in his ante-
room; but to-night there are two or three who were or-
dered to stay in the outer room where the prisoner is,
in the old tower; that is to say, in what they used to
call the haunted rooms, for they were always shut up,
and nobody went in but my lord and Mistress Bertha,
so that folks said that the ghost of the countess used to
walk there.”
“So there are three men appointed to sleep there,
are there !” demanded the other; “you are sure of the
fact l”
“Why, no,” replied the groom; “if you mean wheth-
er I am sure they were ordered to sleep there, I’m sure
enough of that; but I am quite as sure that not one of
them will do it, for I heard Will Hudson say that the
earl might skin him alive first. No, no; they’ll none of
them stay there after twelve o'clock at night, I'll answer
for it.”
“That is sufficient on that score,” said the interroga-
tor; “now tell me farther, how many men in all may
there be in the castle !”
The groom paused for a moment as if in thought, but
then answered, “Some fifteen or sixteen that sleep
within doors; but then there are all the grooms and
horseboys, and my lord's three coachmen, and the run-
ning footmen, who sleep at the stables, which, you know,
lie out by—”
“I know, I know,” interrupted the other. “Not more
than fifteen or sixteen; fifteen or sixteen lackeys !” he
continued, turning with a sort of contemptuous laugh to
his companions; “it is scarcely worth while priming
our pistols. Do none of them sleep below !”
“Why, no, not by rights,” replied the man, “except
the porter and his boy; but to-night there will be Willy
Hudson and the rest, who I dare say, will come down

into the corridor and sleep in the armchairs; and then,
too, there is fat Frank, who has got Silly John in charge,
shut up in the dark room at the bottom of Hubert's
Tower.”
“Silly John.” exclaimed the other; “what does he
do there !”
“Why, he would not tell, I hear,” answered the
groom, “who were the people whom he had seen bury
my young lord under the beech-trees by Upwater Mere,
so my lord ordered him to be shut up in the dark room,
without either meat or drink, till he did; and, if he don’t
tell, hang me if he don’t starve to death, for my lord's
not one to go back from what he has once said.”
As the man spoke, the person who had been thus
questioning him moved his hand with a rapid and impa-
tient gesture to the holster of his saddle-bow, plunged
it in, and, pulling out a pistol, thrust it into his belt
He muttered also a few words in a hurried tone, which
could only be heard by himself; but then again, appear-
ing to recover from some impatient feelings, he contin-
ued, “One word more, my good fellow. Is not the
small wicket door at the back of the western wing very
often, if not always, left open all night !”
The man hesitated, and showed evident signs of a
disinclination to reply.
“It is sometimes,” he said, at length, “but not al-
ways.”
“I ask you,” continued the other, “did you ever know
it shut !”
“Yes, I think so. I don't know. I can’t tell,” replied
the groom, with manifest hesitation at what he felt to
be betraying the way into his lord's mansion.
“He prevaricates,” said one of the men behind; “he
prevaricates; shall I blow his brains out, captain 1”
“Not yet,” replied their leader, calmly. “Do youin-
tend to answer or not? Did you ever in your life know
that door shut !”
“No, I didn’t; no, I didn’t,” answered the groom.
“It’s always open; that's the truth.”
“Very well, then,” continued the other. “If I remem-
ber right, when one goes straightforward from that door,
and then turns along the first passage to the left, it leads
to the little hall, out of which a passage takes to the
foot of the great stairs. Now there are two other doors,
one of which leads to the * staircase going to the

earl’s apartments. Which of those two doors is it—the
right or the left-for I forget ! Your life is at stake,”
he added, in a warning tone.
There was a sound like the clicking of a pistol-lock
behind him, and the man replied with but the loss of a
single moment, “It is the door to the left. I tell you
true, upon my word.”
“I dare say you do,” replied the other; “if you don't,
so much the worse for you. You will remain here till
I come back; and you know what will happen to you if
you have made any mistake in this business. Harvey,
learn from him exactly the way to the room where the
poor silly man has been put. You and Hardcastle must
undertake to set him free. Then join me with all speed
at the point you know. You, Williams and Erith, stay
with this good man and the horses; and if you should
have such reason to believe that he has told me a false-
hood as to induce you to leave the spot, give him a
couple of ounces of lead in his head before you go. You
understand me. I know a word is sufficient with you.”
“But, captain,” exclaimed the man whom he called
Erith, “why should I not go with you? Curse me if I
like to be left here holding the horses like a groom.
Why must not I go?” -
“Because I appoint you to a post of trust and dan-
ger,” answered his leader; “there is more to be appre-
hended from without than from within; judgment of
what intelligence it may be necessary to give me, too,
is wanted, and, therefore, I choose you. But to end all
in one word, Erith,” he added, seeing the other about to
reply, “you must stay here, because I direct you to do
so; I, who never yet found you unwilling to obey at
once in moments of action and perill"
“That's the way you always come over me, captain,”
replied his companion; “however, I suppose I must do
as you bid me, having stood by your side in many amo-
ment of life and death work.” -
“And always acted like a lion where it was needful,”
answered his leader, holding out to him his hand, which
the other grasped eagerly. “God bless you, Erith !”
he added; “there is something at my heart tells me we
shall not be long together. If we part for the last time
to-night, remember that I love you, and that I think
even now of the watchfire of Kaiserlautern, when,

wounded yourself, you brought cup after cup of cold
water to your wounded captain's lips.”
Thus saying, he dismounted from his horse, and eight
of his comrades followed his example. The well-trained
beasts were then ranged in a line, and a single rope run
through the bridles seemed all that was necessary to
keep them together till their riders' return. One end of
the rope was tied to a tree, the other to the last horse's
bit; and after gazing for one moment more at the light
in the window of the tower, across which a dark figure
was seen to pass twice, the leader gave a signal with
his hand. The whole party then began silently to de-
scend the hill, with the exception of the two who had
been appointed to remain with the horses, and the unhap-
py groom, whose terror had now grown to such a pitch
that, had it not been for the lashings with which he was
attached to his horse, he could not have sat the animal
that bore him, although it remained as quiet and passive
as if it had never known any other stable than that of a
farmer's mule.
With eager eyes and a beating heart the man marked
the party descend the hill, emerge from the shadow of
the trees, cross the dewy grass, which glistened like
frostwork in the full beams of the moon, ascend the op-
posite rise, and then take their way through the trees
behind towards the back of the building where they pro-
posed to effect their entrance. It was certain that the
property of his lordly master, that perhaps the lives of
several of his comrades, were at stake at that moment,
but yet the worthy domestic felt little or no agitation
upon that score.
All that affected him, all that he thought of, as would
too naturally be the case with most of the human worms
that crawl about in this state of being, was his own sit-
uation, his own danger. He knew, he felt that any mis-
understanding of the directions he had given, or that
anything going wrong in the arrangements of those who
had compelled him to afford them intelligence, might be
attributed to intentional falsehood or misstatement on
his part, and that a life which he valued just in propor-
tion to its worthlessness, its inactivity, and its want of
fine perceptions, might be taken from him on the slight
est notice.
He regarded the party of nine, then, as they descend-
edW. '. w: feelings most strangely mingled and ap-
oil. 1 i.-,

parently contradictory; there was a hope for their suc
cess, which he trusted would free him from the painful
situation in which they had placed him; there were sen-
sations of dislike and enmity towards those who had
stopped and made him a prisoner; there were feelings
of anger in regard to the degradation of the Earl of
Danemore, who had so long ruled paramount through-
out the country round; and there was that longing de-
sire, which brutes as well as men feel, to behold every-
thing of importance that is passing around them, espe-
cially when they are prevented by any cause from so
doing. -
# feelings, I say, were so mingled, that his whôle
capability of wishing was concentrated in one earnest
desire to know the result, and to have, if we may use
such a colloquial expression, “the matter out at once.”
There are times and seasons, indeed, when ten minutes
of the past, ten minutes of anything that is absolutely
certain, are worth whole ages of doubt, even though
that doubt may not be mingled with any degree of ap-
prehension; but in the present instance personal terror
added immensely to all that the unhappy man felt; and
his thoughts of every dear relation of life which might
be sacrificed had ample room to torture his heart, while
silent and inactive he remained upon the hill watching
the progress of those on whom depended his whole after
fate.
When they approached the side of the wood that
swept round the esplanade, the straining eye of the cap-
tive could no longer distinguish them; and he waited
eagerly, with his eyes fixed upon the building, as if he
could gather from the dull unmeaning face of the stone
that which was passing within those walls. For some
time, however, neither sight nor sound gave him the
slightest indications of that which he longed to learn.
It was like the cold outside, which we too frequently
see in the world, covering a heart all agitation, anxiety,
bitterness, and pain.
At length his feelings became insurmountable. There
are degrees of terror which give courage; he felt that
it would be a thousand times preferable to be among
his comrades at the castle, sharing their fate and min-
gling in their danger, than sitting there in perfect inac-
tivity, waiting a result which he had no power to change;
and he writhed with the bonds that confined him. As

he did so he felt that the knot upon the cords which
tied his arms gave in a degree; that he could loosen it
still further by a great but silent exertion of his
strength; and, as he made that exertion, it slipped
down to his wrists, over which it was easily passed.
- The two men who guarded him were gazing as
eagerly upon the castle as he had been ; and their
minds were too full of the progress of their comrades
to allow them to take any note of the slight movement
he had made, so that, before they were at all aware of
what he was doing, his arms were free. As silently as
he could, he slipped one hand into his pocket for a
knife to cut the cords which tied his legs, and he had
accomplished that purpose also, in some degree, while
they still continued gazing at the castle, along the win-
dows of which more than one light was now gleaming.
He felt that he could do no more without calling atten-
tion; but he perceived that what remained to do would
be speedily done if he could get away, and would not
impede his progress as he went ; and he gazed round
upon the two who remained beside him with a beating
heart, longing to gallop down to the castle as fast as he
could, yet terrified at the idea of making the attempt.
His hesitation was soon brought to an end, however;
for, giving way to the impulse of habit, he put forward
his hand without thinking of what he was doing, and
patted his horse's neck. The gesture instantly drew
the attention of those beside him.
“What are you about there?” cried Erith. “He has
got his hands free '"
The groom stayed to hear no more, but, snatching up
the bridle, he struck his horse hard and galloped down
the hill. The report of a pistol rang in his ear the next
moment, and at the same time a feeling, as if some one
had run a hot iron along his right cheek, followed b
the trickling down of blood, showed him that the rob-
ber's aim had not been far amiss. The slight wound
only added wings to his flight, however, and the sound
of a horse's feet following urged him on still faster. It
was, and he knew it, a ride for life or death; but, fortu-
nately for him, his beast felt that it was speeding to its
longed-for stable, and, though the hoofs of the pursuer
sounded close behind, the groom rather gained than lost
ground in that headlong race

CHAPTER IV.
FRANKLIN GRAY uttered scarcely a word as he led his
men down the hill, through the deep plantations to the
left of the castle, and to the small door which he was
aware stood generally unlocked throughout the whole
night. Not a human being seemed to be stirring in the
mansion or its proximity; darkness, silence, and soli-
tude reigned in all the offices and courts; and the rob-
ber laid his hand upon the heavy iron latch which was
to give him admission into the interior of the building
without his approach having been perceived by any one.
He paused there for a moment, however, and spoke
in a low tone to his band, saying, “Remember ! to free
this young gentleman is the first object. After that,
take what may fall in the way, money and jewels; no-
thing heavy, nothing cumbersome. All the rest that
is light in weight and valuable in quality sweep off at
once. What right has he to such wealth more than we
have 1” he added, in the tone of one who sought to jus-
tify to himself and others, acts, the justice of which he
doubted. “He took many a thing from others with a
strong hand, and he shall now feel the strong hand in
turn. Your weapons, I know, are never unready, but
use them not unless we are compelled. As little blood-
shed as possible ! Remember, Harvey, the silly man,
poor fellow ! then by the earl's dressing-room up to the
old tower! You may clear the dressing-room as you
come, if you like. There are many jewels there.”
Those he spoke to heard his directions without reply,
though swords were loosened in their sheaths, and the
priming of some of the pistols examined or increased.
Harvey, and one or two others, indeed, of the more
experienced, seemed too sure of their preparations to
need any investigation thereof, and, without touching
their weapons, prepared to accompany their leader with
as much easy nonchalance as if he had been leading
them to a ballroom.
Franklin Gray himself neither touched sword nor pis-
tol, but there was no affected carelessness in his air. It
was grave and stern, and full of thought, as it well might
be when bent upon an errand in the course of which hu-

man blood might be spilled like water, without any of
the exciting and animating spirit of martial enterprise
which, under other circumstances, might have led him
to tread gayly the path to tenfold dangers. He looked
round his companions, however, while the short and
fluttered preparation was made; then laid his hand upon
the latch, and the door opened easily to his hand.
All was dark within, and the hollow echo of Franklin
Gray's foot, as he crossed the threshold and strode on
into the vaulted passage, was the only sound to be heard
in the mansion. One by one the others followed, and,
leading them on through the dark corridors, without
either hesitation or mistake, the robber proceeded
straight towards what was called the Little Hall, and
pushed open a swinging door which lay between it and
the passages communicating with the offices. As he
did so, a bright light burst upon him and dazzled his
eyes, so long habituated to the darkness. He strode on,
however, into the midst of the hall with a pistol in his
hand; but the place was tenantless; and he found that
me light proceeded from a large sconce over the chim-
aey and from a lamp standing on the table.
“This will light us on our way,” he said, taking up
..he lamp. “That is the door, Harvey, which leads to the
earl's rooms above; when you have set the poor man
Tree, come that way at once. In the end room of the
suite you will find a door opposite to you leading to a
staircase between that room and the top rooms of the
tower above. Follow the stairs and join me; but, re-
member, do not hurt the old man. Tie him if he resists,
but do not take his life unless he tries to take yours.”
Thus saying, he turned and took his way through the
passage that led towards the foot of the great stairs,
which he found dark and solitary. There Harvey and
his companions left him; and with the rest of his follow-
ers, now reduced to six in number, Franklin Gray as-
cended the steps and entered the long corridor.
“Hark!” he whispered, after pausing for a moment;
“hark! There are voices speaking beyond, and I think
I see a light through the door. That chamber fies close
at the foot of the stairs which we have to go up, and we
must see what it contains ere we proceed farther. Fol-
low me,” he continued; and, advancing with a noiseless
step, he pushed open the door, which was only ajar and
strode at once into the ":

42 THE ROBBER.
There, seated round a table furnished with a large
black jack full of strong ale, were not only the three
men who had been ordered to keep guard over Langford,
but two or three of the women servants of the house,
whom their male companions had prevailed upon to come
and cheer the solitary hours of night with their presence,
and to banish all fears of the ghost by numbers and mer-
riment.
The sudden apparition of Franklin Gray and his fol-
lowers, however, at once put an end to all glee. The
men sat for a moment as if turned into marble with ter-
ror and astonishment; but the women, without waiting
to see whether the object of their apprehensions was
corporeal or incorporeal, fled with loud and piercing
screams by the opposite door; and, as their retreat to-
wards the great staircase was cut off, they had no re-
source but to rush up towards the chamber inhabited
by Langford. No sooner was the example of flight set
them than the men hastened to follow it with loud and
terrified vociferations; and though Franklin Gray, irri-
tated by the noise, vowed he would fire upon them if
they were not silent, they continued their outcry as
they rushed on before him up the stairs and through the
Outer chamber.
Without calculation or concert, it struck each of the
terrified servants that they might make their way
through the prisoner's room down into Lord Danemore's
apartments, where they hoped to find new courage, or,
at least, protection from one to whom they had been ac-
customed to see all things yield in his vicinity. Each,
then, rushed towards the door, and, when they found it
locked, pushed against it with frantic vehemence. It
shook, it yielded; the steps of the pursuers were heard
at the top of the stairs; another great effort was made;
and so sudden and violent was the rush against the door,
that it gave way at once, and, darting in, the terrified
servants found themselves in the presence not only of
Langford, but of the earl himself.
“What is the meaning of all this?” exclaimed the earl.
But scarcely had the words issued from his lips, and
before he could receive any reply, when the figures
of several strange men, armed, and for the most part
disguised, appeared at the doorway, and gave him
Some intimation of the truth. No sooner did he be-
hold this sight than he sprang towards the door whick

THE ROBBER. 43
led to his apartments below, unlocked it, and calling to
his servants, “Follow me !” he darted down the stairs,
leaving Langford to act £ he thought fit.
Franklin Gray paused but for a single instant for the
purpose of speaking a few hurried words to the prison-
er, or rather spoke them as he passed. “Quick!” he
eried; “take possession of the papers if you have not
got them, and fly across the park down to Moorhurst,
and thence to London, where use your advantage, and
hire the most knavish, which means the best, of that
great herd of knaves called lawyers. I must after yon-
der old man, or he will get to the alarum bell, and have
the whole county up upon us.”
“Stop, Gray, stop !” exclaimed Langford, “rement-
ber—”
“I cannot stop! I cannot remember!” shouted Gray,
sharply, in return; and, darting towards the door, he
rushed after the earl, followed by his band.
Langford, left alone, paused for a moment, as if to
consider, and then took the same path that the rest had
done. The stairs were all in darkness, but the lights
from the rooms below, the noise of many voices, of
trampling feet, and of evident contention, guided him;
and, rushing on through the dressing-room, he came to
the earl’s bedroom, where the old man, having snatched
up what weapons he could find, with the terrified wo-
men clinging to his knees, and the three men armed in
haste around him, now stood like an ancient lion brought
to bay. With his white hair floating back from his face,
and the fire of unquenchable courage flashing from his
eyes, with a pistol presented towards Gray in one hand
and a drawn sword in the other, he leaned forward,
ready and eager for the unequal strife; while the rob-
ber, with his band behind him, and his arms crossed
upon his broad chest, stood gazing upon the old peer
with a look, stern indeed, but not devoid of admiration.
At the same time, in a detached group to the right,
were Harvey and Hardcastle, the first of whom had his
foot planted firmly on the chest of the earl's Italian val-
et, who lay prostrate before him, while with his right
hand the robber pointed a pistol at the servant's head.
Hardcastle from behind, with a short carbine raised to
his shoulder, took aim at the earl, exclaiming, as he
looked towards Franklin Gray, “Shall I fire?”
Like lightning Langford sprang forward, grappled

with Hardcastle, and threw up the muzzle of the car-
bine, which, instantly going off, struck the fine gilded
ceiling, and brought down a considerable part upon their
heads.
“Hold. hold!” shouted Gray. “If any one stirs he
shall die!”
“I know you, mutinous traitor! I know you,” ex-
claimed the earl, gazing fiercely upon the robber; “I
have not forgotten you!”
“Nor I you, bucanier !” replied the robber. “But
this is no time to call such memories to mind. Make
no resistance, and you are safe.”
But, even as he spoke, there came the rushing sound
of many feet from the direction of the little hall below.
The door to the left of the earl was thrown open, and
in poured a crowd of men, grooms, horseboys, running
footmen, all armed in haste with whatever weapons
they could snatch up, and led on by the very groom
who had been left upon the hill.
Many of them were pale with terror, but the deter-
mination and courage of a few among them served to
inspire the whole, and they poured on into the room to
the number of twelve or thirteen men, jostling each
other through the door, and gazing wildly round a cham-
ber in which few, if any of them, had ever been before,
and which now presented so strange and fearful a scene.
The eyes of Franklin Gray flashed as he beheld them,
and Hardcastle, suddenly bursting from the grasp of
Langford—for all this had passed in a single moment—
sprang to the side of his leader, while Harvey, coolly
firing the pistol at the Italian's head, followed his com-
panion, and ranged himself with the rest. The unhappy
valet started partly up from the ground; but, ere he
could gain his feet, fell back again, and writhed for an
instant in convulsive agony, while the spirit left its frail
tenement. Then all was still.
But matters of deeper interest to Henry Langford
were going on at the other side of the room. Fury
had evidently taken place of calmness in the breast
of Franklin Gray, and the earl's eyes were blazing with
triumph and wrath as he found # unexpectedly
supported by so large a body of men.
“Now, villain! will you surrender and meet your
fate?” the old man exclaimed. “Now surrender, or
die where you stand, like a man Out of the way,

woman why cling you there!” he continued, spurning
one of the woman servants with his foot, and striding
over her to approach nearer to the robber. But at that
moment Franklin Gray’s arms were unfolded from his
breast; the pistol in his right hand was raised in an in-
stant; there was a flash, a report, and the earl fell back.
Consternation for a moment seized upon his attend-
ants; and Langford’s voice was heard aloud, exclaim-
ing, “If you have killed him you shall answer for it
with your life!”
But the earl sprang up again instantly, crying, “’Tis
nothing ! 'tis nothing but a slight hurt! Take that,
villain!” and, in the very act of rising, he fired the pis-
tol, which he had never let fall, into the midst of the
group of robbers. He probably intended the shot for
Franklin Gray, and there had been a time when no aim
of his would have failed in reaching its object; but he
was wounded and old; and the ball hit the man Hard-
castle a few inches below the collar-bone, and brought
him to the ground with a loud unnatural scream.
All was now confusion; a number of shots were fired
on both sides, till the pistols and carbines which had
been loaded were discharged, and, betaking themselves
to other weapons, the two parties mingled, and blood-
shed, slaughter, and determined strife spread throughout
the whole apartments. Some were driven back into
the rooms beyond, and prolonged the struggle there;
some died where they stood; and some were seen to
steal away wounded, or to fly as fast as they could with
terror. -
Skill, however, and discipline were on the part of the
robbers; and though they were inferior in number, the
advantage was evidently on their side. Franklin Gray,
with all the worst parts of his nature roused and fierce
within him, commanded, directed, and fought, as if he
had been in the field. His eye was on every part of
the chamber in turn, and his voice was heard shouting
orders to his different men, which, promptly obeyed,
almost always brought success along with them.
Two of the earl's grooms, who thrust themselves be-
tween him and their master, fell by his hand, either
killed or wounded, even while he was directing others.
But while he still strode on towards the old peer, who
struggled fiercely forward to meet him, he was encoun
tered by one at least equal to himself.


## p. 46 (#278) #############################################

46 THE ROBBER.
With difficulty Langford had forced himself forward
through the scene of strife and confusion that was going
on. He spoke to no one, he assailed no one, though he
parried more than one blow aimed at random at his
head; for, though the lamp above their heads gave
abundant light, the struggle and the obscurity caused by
the smoke had got to that pitch that men scarcely knew
who were adversaries or who were friends; but, with
his drawn sword in his hand, he hurried on to the part
of the room where he had seen the earl, and now
seemed to devote himself to his defence.
At the very moment when Franklin Gray was within
another stride of the old peer, Langford thrust himself
between them. But the robber's blood was all on fire.
“Out of my way !” he cried; “out of my way, or take
the consequences !”
“Stand back!” cried Langford, in return, while his
eyes too flashed with living lightning; “stand back, or
I forget all, and you die!”
“Out of my way!” again repeated Franklin Gray,
and their swords crossed.
At that moment, however, the loud long peal of the
alarum bell made itself heard throughout the whole
castle, rung with such violence and determination as
speedily to rouse all the villages and hamlets in the
neighbourhood. Franklin Gray heard the sound; and
never, in the moment of the strongest passion, forgetting
the judgment and the skill which had distinguished him
in the army, even in the most unjustifiable enterprises,
he glared for a moment upon Langford, unwilling to
yield his victim or to give up the strife; but then, as
the knell sounded louder and more loud upon his ear, he
turned to his nearest companion, saying, in a low voice,
“Wilson, we must make our retreat. Tell Harvey to
get the men together. We go by the same way that we
came. Get hold of yonder casket, and see what is in
that cabinet, while I and these good fellows screen you;
and be quick! for we shall have the whole peasantry
upon us! There is a tremendous smell of fire ! Be
quick, be quick!”
He spoke rapidly but calmly, glancing with his eye
from time to time towards his antagonist. Although he
felt very sure that Langford would not attempt to injure
him unless he pressed him, still he kept his blade play-
ing round that of his opponent; and when he had done,

he made a lunge or two to fill up the time, but evidently
without any intention of wounding his adversary.
Langford parried them with ease; and, as rapid in his
conclusions as Franklin Gray, he perceived at once that
the ringing of the alarum bell, which struck his ear also,
had rendered the robbers apprehensive of their retreat
being cut off, and now made them prepare to retire.
The earl, however, fierce and implacable, rushed for-
ward, but the more eagerly from the sounds he heard,
and from the hope of taking or destroying those who
had dared to assail him. With word and gesture he
cheered on the men that still stood around him, and
pressed forward upon the robbers, who were now ran-
ging themselves in regular line, and slowly retreating to
the doorway behind them. His men, however, were in
general of the opinion that it is wise to make a bridge
for a flying enemy, and they seconded his efforts but
feebly, notwithstanding his reiterated commands and
the fearful execrations which he poured forth upon
their cowardice.
Two or three, indeed, rushed forward with him, but
- they were driven back in a moment by the line of their
adversaries, bearing with them some severe wounds to
teach them more caution for the future.
They dragged back in their flight their more impetu-
ous lord, and under cover of the smoke, which was now
so dense as to render every object in the room indis-
tinct, the robber and his men reached the door by which
they had entered, and began to pass it two at a time.
As they did so, the eye of Franklin Gray ran over their
numbers, and he suddenly exclaimed, “Halt ! Hard-
castle is down and dead; but where are Harvey and
Doveton ?”
“I am here,” cried a faint voice, which proceeded
from a man who was seen staggering towards them
through the clouds of smoke. “Go on, captain; never
mind me. I will come after.”
“We must leave none in the hands of the enemy,”
cried the robber, starting forward, and taking the wound-
ed man by the arm. At that moment, however, one of
the grooms darted upon Doveton, and seized him by
the collar, but as instantly fell back on the floor, cleft
nearly to the jaws by the heavy blade of Franklin Gray,
who, while he was thus remorselessly sending the spirit
of an adversary to its eternal account, was shouting out

with anxious care for his companions. “Where is
Harvey ! I don’t see Harvey !”
Such is human nature !
“I am here, I am here, captain,” cried Harvey, burst-
ing into the room from the opposite door, and throwing
down a man who stood in his way.
“Come quick, then, come quick!” cried his leader;
“we shall scarce have time to retreat !” "
“No, by ——, we shall not,” replied Harvey, rushing
up to Franklin Gray, and speaking in a low tone; “we
shall not, for the house is on fire in every part. I ran
through there to see if we could get out by that stair-
case and the little hall, but the fire seems to have be-
gun there ; some of the men must have knocked over
the sconce. Our only way will be up these stairs, down
the others from the tower, and through the great gal-
lery. But we must be quick, for the fire is running that
way rapidly.”
He spoke quickly, but by this time there was no
chance of his being interrupted, for the same tidings had
just been communicated to the earl and those who sur-
rounded him, but not with the same clearness; and,
horrified at the thought of the new kind of death pre-
sented to their eyes, the whole body of grooms and at-
tendants had made a rush towards the antechamber
and vestibule, hoping to escape by the same way that
Harvey had attempted but found impracticable.
The earl followed them more slowly, and he might
be seen once or twice to raise his hand towards his
head, as if either faint from loss of blood or giddy with
the smoke and the fatigue. -
Langford gazed after him eagerly, and when he saw
him reach the door, and take hold of the lintel as if for
support, he darted forward to aid him; but he was sud-
denly detained by a strong and powerful hand which
grasped his arm, and turning, he beheld Franklin Gray
and two of his men by his side.
“This way! this way!” cried the robber, eagerly;
“this way, if you would save your life and regain your
liberty ! This way, if you would recover the papers
you have so long eagerly sought ! The house is on fire,
and everything will quickly be consumed !”
Langford hesitated; but when he turned again to.
wards the earl, the old peer had passed through the
door, and was no longer visible.

“Quick, quick!” cried Franklin Gray. “Come you
must and shall ! Drag him along, whether he will or
not ;” and, seized by both arms, he was hurried to the
foot of the staircase leading to the tower. Some sud-
den emotion, however, seemed there to take possession
of him, and make him throw aside all hesitation at once.
“My duty first,” he cried, “and God's will for the
rest!” and, shaking off the hold of those who were hur-
rying him forward, he exclaimed, “Go on, Gray, and,
if I perish, forget that we have drawn our swords upon
each other; go on.”
As he spoke he turned with a rapid step, and retrod
his way into the earl's bedroom.
Gray gazed after him for a moment with a look of
stern sorrow, and then said, “On, my men . He must
perish if he will.”
A number of voices assailed Langford as he entered
the earl’s bedroom, exclaiming, “Not that way, not
that way! the vestibule is all on fire! the stairs are
down ''” and men and women, rushing rapidly towards
the other staircase by which the robbers had fled, passed
him as he advanced, while the heat was becoming more
and more intense, and the smoke almost suffocating.
“Where is the earl 1" he demanded of one of the
grooms as he darted by him.
“I don’t know,” replied the man, with all the bitter
selfishness of terror. “Gone to the devil, I dare say,”
and on he rushed.
But Langford, undismayed, strode forward, passed
through the bedroom, and entered the anteroom be-
yond. It was now clear of all the crowd of attendants
who had supported the earl in his struggle with the rob-
bers, but had fled in different directions from the still
more appalling fate that now menaced every one within
those walls. The fire was running round the cornices;
the smoke was tremendously thick; the heat and smell
of burning wood intolerable; and the rushing and roar-
ing sound of the flames, as they seemed to revel with
demoniac triumph in the passages beyond, was almost
deafening to the ear.
Immediately under the lamp that hung from the ceil-
ing, however, and leaning on a table of splendid mosaic
work, which was soon destined to crumble into nothing
under the jaws of the devouring element, stood the Earl
of Danemore, with the blood dropping rapidly from a

wound in his shoulder and from another in the arm.
There was a solt of fixed, stern, cold determination in
his countenance, which had something awful in it, as in
that scene of terror and coming destruction he remained
there, without making one effort to save himself.
“Fly, my lord, fly l’exclaimed Langford, hurrying
towards him; “this way is still clear.”
“Sir,” replied the earl, calmly and coldly, “I cannot
fly; I am old, and weak, and wounded, and I cannot
fly. I have exerted myself somewhat too much in this
little affray; my strength is expended, and I cannot fly.
I may as well die here as in the next room or the room
beyond.” -
“God forbid that it should be so !” replied Langford,
eagerly. “My lord, I can bear you forth; I am young
and strong, unhurt and unfatigued. Let me, let me save
ou !”
y “Touch me not, sir!” exclaimed the earl; “touch me
not You have brought this thing upon my head.
From the sight of that man’s face I know where you
gained your information of my former life. He came
to set you free. Touch me not! but go to join your
fellows while you may. Here, with death hanging
over me, and perhaps over you, I tell you I hate and
abhor you, and will not have your support, even to save
my life!”
“Say not so, my lord; say not so,” replied Langford,
casting himself on his knee before him; “let me entreat
you, let me adjure you to accept my aid! Did you not
see my sword drawn against him in your defence?
Hate me, my lord, you may; injure me, my lord, you
have; but you know not yet that I love you with a love
that may change your hate into affection; and, to show
you what I feel, I swear that, if you come not to safety
with me, I will remain and die with you!”
The old man was moved. “This is strange, this is
very strangel" he said; “but no !” he added, “save
yourself, Monsieur de Beaulieu, save yourself; and, in
gratitude for what you say, let us mutually forgive one
another. For me, my hour is come; I know it, I feel
it. My plans are frustrated and thwarted; the secrets
of my early life displayed; the mansion of my fathers
burned to the ground; my son, my only son, dead by
the hand of a murderer! I am old, houseless, hopeless;
why should I linger? I am companionless, childless:
why should I live?” <


## p. 51 (#283) #############################################

THE ROBBER. 51
“Not childless, my lord,” replied Langford; “not
companionless, if you will have it so. Your son Lord
Danemore is dead, but not your only son. Your son is
lost, but your eldest son is at your feet!”
“God of heaven!” exclaimed the earl; “what do you
mean? You are so like: yes, you are so like—”
“Yes, my lord, yes,” exclaimed Langford, “I know
I am. I am like Eugenie de Beaulieu, your first, your
only wife. I am her son! I am your child! But now
let me save my father;” and he threw his vigorous
arms around him.
The old man bent down his head upon his shoulder
and wept; but he resisted him no longer; and Langford,
with a great effort, raising that still powerful form in his
arms, bore him strongly onward through the bedroom,
and the dressing-room behind it, to the stairs. It is true
he felt that he carried a great and unusual weight; but
there were those feelings within his bosom which made
every muscle as strong as a band of iron, and he bore
the old peer up the stairs into the chamber where he
had been so long confined.
Until that moment the earl uttered not a word, and
the tears rained heavy from his eyes; but then he
raised his head, exclaiming, “Stop! stop ! The papers,
my boy! The papers!”
“Not for a world!” exclaimed Langford; “if we
have time, it is all that we shall have ;” and on he hur-
ried through the antechamber and down the stairs to
the long gallery.
There was an awful sight before him. The rich
carved oak wainscoting was all in flames. The inval-
uable pictures which covered the walls shrivelling and
cracking with the fire. The armour and weapons,
either of the chase or war, which had been piled up in
the form of trophies between the panels, fallen from the
brackets that supported them, cumbered the floor in
many places. The ceiling from above was dropping
down with the heat, and in two places the flame might
be seen forcing its way through the flooring from below,
and curling up the wooden pillars which supported the
roof. It was evident that the whole of the corridors
underneath were on fire; and as Henry, bearing his
heavy burden, strode on along the gallery, he knew not
but that each step might precipitate both himself and
his father into the gulf of death.

* His heart, however, was proud of its doing, and fear-
less; and if there was one feeling in his breast which
was painful, it arose there only when the thought of
Alice Herbert crossed his mind; when deep love and
the memory of her affection came tender and unnerving
upon him. For a single instant all the painful particu-
lars of her situation, if he were lost to her, flashed
across his mind, but he banished them in a moment, and
summoned high resolution to his aid, knowing that he
was acting as she would have him act; knowing that
she would be proud and satisfied if she could see him al
that moment.
Onward he went, then, rapidly but carefully. Twice
he felt the flooring giving way beneath him, and twice,
by a longer stride, he reached a spot where the beams
were firm and unconsumed. The vast size of the gal-
lery enabled him to breathe with greater freedom, but
still he could not see clearly to the top of the great
staircase, not only on account of the smoke, but on
account of a shower of sparks which came down from
a spot where the ceiling had fallen in.
The dust and mortar, even when he reached that
place, prevented him from discovering what was the
state of the flooring below; only two steps, however,
lay between him and the head of the great staircase.
If he reached it he knew that he was safe, for it was of
stone, and he strode on. The flooring gave way, how-
ever, at the first step; but he perceived it yielding
before it was too late, and, with a violent exertion,
sprang across the chasm. The effort was so great as
nearly to have cast him headlong down the steps; but
he caught the iron balustrade, and with a beating heart
felt that he and his father both were saved.
“Thank God!” he exclaimed.
“Thank God!” rejoined the earl; “I can walk now !
I can walk well!”
But Langford still bore him on till they had reached
the doorway, and passed out under the arch which pro-
jected beyond the building. There, relaxing his hold,
he suffered the earl to regain his feet; but, still sup-
porting him by the arm, led him onward after giving a
moment to recover breath, towards a spot on the ter-
race where all those who had escaped from the fire
were assembled, and, as too usual on such occasions

were standing with inactive wonder and selfish thank-
fulness for their own deliverance.
Farther on, indeed, there were two or three people
engaged in raising with difficulty a long ladder towards
the high tower where Langford had been confined.
But a cry of “The earl ! the earl !” which burst from
the nearest group as the two approached, caused them
to pause, and the woman Bertha, who had been direct-
ing their movements, ran up in haste.
The earl, leaning on the arm of him who had saved
him, gazed up for an instant upon the splendid mansion
of his ancestors, while in some parts wide black vacui-
ties fringed with fire, and in others a mass of flame and
a blaze of light, crowned by a pyramid of red sparks
and smoke, showed him the state of that building from
the midst of which he had been borne.
The sight thus presented to his eyes; the memory of
all that night's events; the sudden wakening up of old,
and dear, but painful associations; the renewal of feel-
ings that had been extinct; and the struggle of wonder
and uncertainty with joy and conviction, were over-
powering to a frame weakened as his had been. He
turned from the burning mansion to his recovered son;
he gazed for a moment earnestly, intensely on his coun-
tenance, and then, casting his arms round his neck, he
exclaimed, “It is, it is my son my child! my deliv-
erer! But my eyes grow dizzy, my heart feels sick.”
And, as he spoke, he fainted with the loss of blood and
the manifold emotions which thronged into his heart
CHAPTER W.
“HE acknowledges him ! he acknowledges him as his
own child!” exclaimed the voice of Bertha, who had
run up in haste from the other group. “Bear witness
all, bear witness every one ! You, Henry, you, Jones,
you, Moreton; he acknowledges him as his son even at
the moment of his death !”
“Hush ! hush! he is not dead,” exclaimed the deep
full voice of Langford; “he is but fainting from loss of
blood. Some one seek a surgeon speedily. Give me

something to bind up his wounds. Cannot some one
fetch a cup of water ?”
“He acknowledged him,” repeated the woman Ber-
tha, whose whole mind seemed taken up with one idea;
“he has acknowledged him; let every one bear witness.
I knew it would be so, I knew it must be so. I knew
that fate and inscrutable justice would work out their
own way, though it were in darkness and in shadow.
I knew that it wanted no mortal skill to direct, no mor-
tal hand to help. Oh! thou,” she continued, turning
towards Langford, “thou who hast undergone the severe
trial in thine infancy of evil fortune and adversity; thou
who hast drank the bitter cup in youth, now, now that
the sweeter cup is presented to thee, forget not the
lessons thou hast learned; and show that thy heart has
been softened, not hardened, by struggles early endured,
and sorrows tasted in the brightest days of life; now
show that thy bosom is as free, even when loaded with
riches, as when lowliest fortune oppressed thee.”
“I trust it may be so,” replied Langford, quickly;
“I trust it may be so; but, nevertheless, you mark not
the earl's condition. Quick, Mistress Bertha, quick!
Surely some simples can be found to recall him from
this state of insensibility. Seek them, I beseech you;
seek them quickly, for it is terrible to think of losing a
parent when one has so lately regained one.”
“Fear not ! fear not !” answered the woman, gazing
upon the earl; “he only faints. There is many a year's
life yet within those old limbs. He was not saved from
destruction to die at the moment when his dearest tie
to the world was restored to him. But look not impa-
tient, Master Henry; I will speed quickly to the rooms
which are not yet on fire, although my keys have been
stolen from me, and I know not where to find anything
that I seek. Nevertheless, so be it; I go but to obey.”
She turned as if to leave them; but Henry and one
or two of thqse who stood near exclaimed, “Hold!
hold! he is better; he opens his eyes. Bring us some
water; that will restore him fully.”
As they spoke the earl did indeed open his eyes, and
looked round him feebly. A few long strips of linen
were procured, and made into bandages for his wounds.
Langford, as we shall still call him, applied them skil.
fully and well; and some water was obtained, of which
the earl drank eagerly, for he was parched and thirsty

with exertion and loss of blood. The deep draught
seemed to refresh him much, and he raised himself up
on his arm from the turf whereon they had laid him,
making a sign for Langford and others to help him to
rise entirely. -
“You are better now,” said Langford, eagerly; “you
are better now. Let us bear you to some cottage in the
neighbourhood, where the aid of a surgeon may be pro-
cured.”
“I am better,” replied the earl, in a voice wonderfully
firm; “I am better, my son, but there is much yet to
be done. Raise me up ! Stay! Give me your hand;
I can rise myself. How goes the fire? is the building
all down ''”
“Oh, mind not the building, my lord,” replied his son;
“mind not the building. Let us attend to your safety
first. There will not be wanting means to raise Dane-
more Castle from its ashes again. No, my lord, no,”
he continued, seeing the earl make an impatient sign
with his hand; “the building is not all down; the whole
of the right wing is free, and the people are bringing
but everything valuable that it contains.” -
“But the tower! the tower!” exclaimed the earl.
“Those papers, my boy! they must be £ at all
risks, otherwise your destiny will still be clouded. Lift
me up! lift me up, I say!”
With very little assistance he raised himself from the
ground and gazed over the building, fixing his eyes ea-
gerly on the old tower in which Langford had been
confined. The fire, running along the corridors, had
reached the first and second stories, and round the
frameworks of the lower windows might be seen the
long lambent flames curling like fiery serpents. But
up above appeared the windows of the two chambers
which contained matter of such interest to both the earl
and his son, through which shone forth nothing but the
calm steady light of the lamps that had been left burn-
ing there, pouring forth a mild and tranquil lustre, high
above all the fierce and eager flames below, like a gen-
tie and virtuous spirit shining on in peaceful brightness
amid the fire, and flame, and smoke of the angry pas.
sions, and consuming strifes, and foul ambitions of the
world in which we live.
“There is yet time,” exclaimed the earl; “there is
yet time! Raise up that ladder,” he continued, turning

to those who had been placing it against the tower as a
means for his own escape, but had now let it sink back
again to the ground; “raise up that ladder! Why have
you let it drop! There! Be quick! Place it against
the farthest window to the east. Why do you not aid
them!” he continued, turning to some of the servants
who stood inactive. “By Heaven, I will have your ears
slit if you stand idle there!”
The men, reminded by the tone of the fiery rule un-
der which they had so long lived, sprang to obey; but,
notwithstanding all the eager haste with which he urged
them on, to raise that tall ladder was a work requiring
some labour and time; and, while they did it, the anx-
ious eye of the earl marked with apprehension the flames
appearing, one after another, at the small loophole win-
dows which lighted the staircase that led from the great
gallery to the chambers above.
“Now ! now !” he said, in the loudest voice he could
command, as soon as the ladder was fixed; “a thousand
guineas to the man who will mount into that room, and
with a pickaxe break open the cabinet-door in the wall
on the left hand, and bring me down safely the small
iron Case that is contained therein. A thousand guineas
to that man, I say!”
“I will do it, my lord,” cried a stout peasant, starting
forth; “I’d go through fire or water either for a thou-
sand guineas, for then I could marry Jenny Barker, and
take old Hudson's farm. There's no pickaxe here, but
here’s a crowbar, which will do as well.”
“Up, up, then "cried the earl; “a thousand guineas
If you bring it down l’”
The young man sprang up the ladder at once; but,
ere he had reached the top, the flames were seen burst-
ing through the windows of the adjoining room, and
every eye below watched his ascent with fearful inter-
est. He went on boldly, however, and, reaching the top,
contrived to open the window.
He was seen kneeling for a moment upon the sill, and
then sprang into the room. -
A moment of anxious suspense followed, but then the .
small flickering point of the flame was seen curling
round the woodwork of the casement through which
he had just passed, and in another instant it burst forth
in a volume. As it did so, a wild scream burst from the
crowd behind the earl and n nrettv country girl ran

forward wringing her hands. But at that moment the
form of him she loved was seen emerging from the very
midst of the fire. He planted his foot firmly on the
ladder, and descended rapidly, holding a small case in
his arms.
“He has got them!” cried the earl; “he has got
them, !” and he turned towards Langford with a smile
full of joy.
“He is safe,” murmured the girl; “he is safe l’” and
she burst into tears.
With haste so great as almost to be dangerous, the
young man descended the ladder; but it soon became
apparent why he did so, for the flames were seen curling
about the upper rounds thereof; and, just as he reached
the bottom, the upper part, consumed by the intense
heat, gave way, and the ladder fell, first against another
point of the tower, and then with a crash to the ground.
The young man, however, was safe; and, giving one
pressure of the hand to the girl, who ran forward to
meet him as he passed, he advanced directly to the
earl, and placed the small iron case that he carried in
his hands. -
It opened with a spring lock, and the earl pressed it
back eagerly. -
Langford gazed not without much agitation, for there
before him, he thought, lay all that he had so long desired
and striven to possess; the proofs of his mother's honour
and purity, his title to great wealth, a noble name, and
high rank (not only in his own country, but in that which
had in some degree adopted him), and the means of
showing, of proving to Alice Herbert that he had loved
her, and sought her with the high, pure, disinterested
love of which she was worthy.
He gazed anxiously, then, while the earl pressed back
the lock; but the old man's hands were still feeble, and
it was with difficulty that he accomplished that object.
He did so at length; the lock gave way, and the top
flew open; but, to the surprise and consternation of
both, the casket was void. Not a paper, not a trace of
anything of the kind did it contain.
The earl let it drop from his hands, and turned a glance
of fierce inquiry upon the young peasant, exclaiming,
“Have you opened it?”
“As I hope for salvation, my lord,” exclaimed the

58 THE ROBBER,
young man, “I neither tried nor knew how to open it,
but brought it to you just as I found it.”
His anxious and terrified look; the sudden rush of
blood to his countenance; his frank and ingenuous
bearing, all confirmed his words, and left no doubt that
he spoke the truth.
The earl then turned to his son, and gazed in his face
with a look of deep and painful interest. Langford's
brow was grave but calm; and, taking both the earl's
hands in his, he said, “Never mind, my lord, it cannot
be helped; let us be satisfied with the good which has
befallen us. This day I have gained a father and you
a son ' It is enough ! Let us not mind the rest.”
The earl cast himself upon his bosom. “You are my
son, you are my son!” he said; “I know and feel it,
though there is much that I do not comprehend, though
there is much still to be explained. You are like your
mother! Oh! too like your mother! Hating myself
for having wronged her, I hated her because she was
wronged; and yet—though it seem madness and folly
to say it—I loved her still. But I knew not that she
had had a son, or I would never have acted as I did
act; I would never have wronged her as I did wrong
her. A vague suspicion of the truth, a wild whirling
phantom of the imagination, did cross my mind once in
years long gone; and once, too, within these few days,
when first I saw you in that tower. But why, why did
she conceal it!”
“Because, my lord,” replied Langford, “you had left
her; you had taken from her the proofs of your marriage
with her; you were upon the eve of marriage with an-
other, a proud and princely dame of another land; and
because her brother, my uncle, once your friend and
companion, though he doubted not the tale that his sister
told of her private marriage with yourself, and of your
having obtained from her all the proofs of that marriage,
upon the most solemn vow never to destroy them;
though he doubted it not, I say, no, not a word of the
whole tale, yet he insisted upon her concealing her sit-
uation and the birth of her child, for the sake of the
honour of his family, at least till he could obtain from
you the proofs of his sister's virtue. Nay, more; when
he found that, notwithstanding all his precautions, Scan-
dal had got abroad and was busy with her name, he forced
her to leave her own land, to dwell in other countries,

to assume another name, and to counterance the report
of her own death. In every matter o. fortune he treated
her with noble and princely generosity ; and in all points
he was kind, except in one, where he was stern and in-
flexible. But I agitate you. You are not able to hear
this tale now.”
“Go on! go on!” exclaimed the earl; “let me hear
it all at once. Keep me not a moment in suspense.”
“Well,” continued Langford, “he educated me as if I
had been his own child; but, as I was born in England
—born within but a few miles of this very spot—he
caused me to be placed in the English regiments serving
at that time with the troops of France. When of an age
to judge for myself, he told me, with her consent, the
sad story of my mother, which she had never told me—”
“What! then she lived !” exclaimed the earl; “she
did not die when I was told she died?”
“Oh no, my lord,” replied Langford; “she bore deep
grief for many a long and bitter year. Hers was a heart
of much endurance; and though the disappointment of
her first affection, the destruction of all confidence in—”
“Hush! hush!” exclaimed the earl, covering his eyes
with his hands. “Hush, hush; I did her bitter wrong!”
There was a silent pause of several minutes, and then
the old man asked again, “How long has she been dead?”
“Scarcely two years, my lord,” replied his son; “and
tet me say, that even to the last there was within her
heart a lingering spark of affection towards him whom
she had loved in early youth, whom she had loved alone.”
“Bless her !” exclaimed the earl; “bless her! Oh,
could she but know that I weep for her even now;” and
he did weep. -
“But that, too,” he added, sadly, “is among the dark
things of the irrevocable past. Oh, could but man re-
member that, though each act that he performs, each
fiery passion gratified, each rash word spoken, each self-
ish wrong committed, may be blotted from his memory
the next hour, like words written by the finger of a
child upon the seashore sand; that though his remem-
brance thereof may be but as a waxen tablet, on which
each new impression effaces the last; could he but re-
member, I say, that there is a stern and adamantine
record kept by fate, on which the lightest line, once
traced, can never be effaced, which whole oceans of
tears can never clear of #" spot, nor the fiery long- *

ings of the repentant heart ever purify of one dark acı
done, human things would surely never give themselves
cause to feel what I feel now, longing to pour out my
blood like water, so that it could but recall the past.”
There was another pause, and then the earl con-
tinued, “Tell me more, my son, tell me more. You
spoke of your uncle. He was a noble man, and gener-
ous. Though there have been harsh words and fierce
acts pass between us, I loved him well: I love him
even now.”
“I was about to say, my lord,” continued Langford,
“that, when I was of an age to hear and judge, he told
me my mother's history and my own condition. He
told me that you had wedded another, and had a son on
whom you doted fondly, and he showed me that there
was no chance of your ever doing myself or my moth-
er justice, if by so doing you were to wring your earl-
dom and your rich estates from him, the child of your
affection. He then proposed to me to make a sacri-
fice, and once more to apply to you for the proofs of
my mother's marriage, entering into a solemn compact
with you never to produce those proofs in England.
Possessing them in France would not only have at
once restored the honour of my mother, but would have
rendered me heir to the Marquisate of Beaulieu, and
to all the estates thereunto attached. But there arose
a question as to whether my birth should be made
known to you. My mother longed for it eagerly; for,
with a mother's fond affection, she thought that there
was something in your breast which would prevent you
from utterly wronging your child.”
The earl stretched forth his hand and turned away his
head, exclaiming, “She did me more than justice. My
heart might have been torn with agony and shame, but
I should have found no means to escape but in fresh
crime, and might not have had the courage even to do
partial right.”
“So my uncle judged,” replied Langford, “and he re-
fused his consent to your being made acquainted either
with my birth or with my mother's existence. He of
fered you his solemn pledge, however, never to make
use of the proofs, if you once yielded them, for any
other purpose than to establish the fact of his sister's
marriage in France.”
“And I refused him,” said the earl; “I refused him

what he had every right to claim. But it is vain re-
gretting; and he, too, is dead, bearing with him to the
cold tomb a load of injuries from him whom he once
called his friend; from him whom he succoured in ad-
versity, nursed in sickness. He, too, is dead! and with
him likewise the past is beyond recall. But with thee,
my boy, with thee it is not too late; and yet,” he added,
sadly, “those papers are lost which I promised never
to destroy; which I guarded so carefully; the only
proofs of that marriage; they are lost at the very mo-
ment that I find my son. Does it not seem as if fate
were resolved to punish all my past deeds by stamping
them with its irrevocable signet at the moment I first
longed to recall them? What shall we do? How shall
we act to prove the facts Bertha, you were present;
you are the only one now left.”
“Is it not enough that you acknowledge him?” de-
manded the woman; “are your laws in this land so
hard that a man cannot do tardy justice when he longs
to do it?”
“What is justice to one might be injustice to
another,” replied Langford; “and, if I am rightly in-
formed, the title and estates must pass away to some
far relative.”
“A man I hate,” exclaimed the earl, with a touch of
his old fierceness.
But Langford interposed. “Oh, hate no one now !”
he said; “but let us talk no more of these things; at
least not now. You are faint, my lord, and, I fear, much
hurt; lean on my arm, and take this good youth's too,
who, though he brought us but the empty casket, with
the treasure gone, must not be unrewarded.”
“The stables are not touched, my lord,” said one of
the grooms, advancing and bowing low; “we can bring
a carriage in a moment.”
“Do so! do so speedily" replied Langford, and he
endeavoured to lead the peer to some place of repose.
"But the old man seemed still inclined to linger and to
inquire into the past, in the presence of the awful
scene which was yet proceeding before his eyes. All
that had been said, both by father and son, had been
witnessed by a crowd of persons; but at first the over-
powering feelings of their hearts had withdrawn all at-
tention from external objects, and neither had remarked

but themselves. Henry had awakened to their situa-
tion first, and he mow strove to prevent the earl from
entering further into the history of his past life, grieved
and angry with himself for not having stopped him
earlier, ere any ears had heard him charge himself with
so many dark offences.
“We are surrounded by listeners, my lord,” he said
in a low tone, seeing that the earl was proceeding with
the theme then paramount in his thoughts; “we had
better pause till we are in private. There is many a
keen ear around us.”
“I mind them not!” replied the earl, aloud, drawing
himself up to his full height, but still leaning upon his
son’s arm ; “I mind them not I would have them
know it! Who can say that I shall ever see to-morrow's
sun 1 Hear every one, and bear witness, that I ac-
knowledge this gentleman as my son; that I was fully
and lawfully married to his mother, before his birth, in
the church of Uppington; that by my hand the leaf was
torn from the register which recorded that marriage;
that the certificate thereof was taken by me from his
mother; and that it, with the torn leaf and other papers,
was kept by me, from that time to this, in the case
which now lies empty there. Some one has stolen
them in the horrors of this night; but for their recovery
I will double the reward I offered for the casket itself.
Let every one remember the words that I have spoken.
This is my legitimate son!”
The people around answered by a shout; but the
heavy pressure of the earl's hand upon his son's arm
showed Henry that the exertion of speaking in so loud
a tone had been too much for his exhausted powers;
and he eagerly led him away towards a spot where he
could sit down till the vehicle came to carry him to
the neighbouring village. The old man seemed satis-
fied, however, with what he had accomplished; and,
gazing in his son's face with a smile, he said, “I have
done my best towards one act of reparation. Oh, my
boy, would that I could repair all!”
Langford said little in reply, but what he did say was
kind and tender; and, as soon as the carriage appeared,
the earl was placed in it, and conveyed to the house of
the clergyman of the village, who gladly received his
noble patron. Messengers were instantly sent off for
surgeons; but, ere they arrived, Langford, who sat by

his father's bedside, saw with pain a bright red spot
deepening every moment in the earl’s cheek, announ-
cing, as well as his burning thirst, that strong fever was
taking possession of him.
CHAPTER VI.
1T is an awful thing to sit by the bed of sickness at
any time; to see that strange and inexplicable thing,
animal life, oppressed and beaten down like a crushed
butterfly, waving its faint wings with the energy of suf-
fering, but not the freedom of health; to mark the quick
breathing, to gaze upon the anxious eye, to see the
cheek, once florid, grown pale and ashy, the lip parched
and dry, the thin nostril expanding for the insufficient
breath, the hand suddenly blanched and grown meager,
the uneasy frame tossing with the dire combination of
lassitude and restlessness; and to know that all these
are signs of a spirit approaching that dread portal which,
if once passed, can never be passed again till the gates
of life are thrown open for eternity!
It is an awful thing at any time ! but when the being
that we see so situated is dear to our heart by the ties
of kindred or of love, it is still more awful; and awful,
trebly awful is the scene, when the creature that lies
weighed down by sickness before our eyes is both close-
ly linked to our deepest feelings and tenderest natural
affections, and yet loaded, even more than by the weight
of malady, with faults and errors, and sins and crimes,
which may render the dark passing of that fearful porch
of death the eternal separation from all who loved him
on the earth. -
The fire in Danemore Castle had burned itself out.
Part of the building had been saved and remained unin-
jured. The servants had taken possession of it, and
were using all means to prevent the fire from breaking
out again. The greater part of the peasantry had re
turned to their homes, and few persons were seen in
the park or on the terraces; but here and there a strag-
gling group of idlers gathered together from the neigh-
bouring country to gaze upon the scene of ruin and de-
struction

64 THE ROBBER.
He whom we have called throughout this book Henry
Langford had twice gone forth, at his father's desire,
to see what was taking place without, and he now sat
in the cool gray of the dawn beside the couch of the
earl, as he lay obtaining snatches of brief and troubled
slumber. As Langford so sat and gazed upon him, the
natural feelings of a son's heart towards a father would
have way. The blood of kindred stirred within him,
and he felt that he was his son. But still, as he gazed,
the image of his dead mother rose up before his sight,
and all the bitter wrongs that she had suffered made his
heart sad, and brought the tears into his eyes.
He thought of her as he had known her in his youth,
still exquisitely lovely, though touched by the wither-
ing hand of sorrow. He thought of her as he had known
her in later days, fading rapidly away like a flower bro-
ken and trampled under foot by some heedless passer-
He thought of her as he had seen her on the bed
of death, with every worldly hope at an end, and with
no thought or care but of the heaven to which her steps
were bent, and of his own future fate and happiness on
earth. Her words, almost the last which she ever
spoke, still rang in his ears; the promise she had ex-
acted from him never to give up the endeavour to es-
tablish her honour and purity; and the injunction which
she had likewise lain upon him, if his father ever did
him injustice, to forgive him, and love him for her sake.
Henry felt that he did forgive him; but he felt, too,
that there was another and a greater Judge whose for-
giveness was needed; a judge not less merciful, indeed,
but one not moved by human passions and affections;
and as he thought of all that had been done by him to
whom he owed his being—of all the dark deeds of other
years—the fierce unruly passions which had remained
unextinguished even to that very night, the scene of his
father's suffering, the prospect of his death, became
awful, trebly awful to the eyes of his son.
. The surgeon from the county town had been with
Lord Danemore, had examined his wounds, and had
pronounced that there was no immediate danger; but
he had not in any degree assured the earl's son that
there was a prospect of his illness terminating favoura-
bly. He spoke, as men are too apt to speak, with cau-
tious consideration of his own reputation more than
with any regard for the feelings and anxieties of him

!,
to whom he spoke. Langford had gathered, however,
that he judged unfavourably of his father's state. He
dwelt upon the facts of the earl being an old man; of
his constitution, though strong, having been apparently
severely tried in former years; of the event of all such
wounds being uncertain; and of a great deal of fever
having rapidly come on. He said nothing to mitigate
these unfavourable circumstances, and Langford judged
the worst. His feelings, then, when, after the surgeon
had left the earl for a short time, and he sat beside him
watching his fitful slumbers, were most painful; but they
were destined to be more so ere long.
Scarcely had the sky grown yellow with the bright
coming on of morning, when the trampling of many
horses’ feet below, and then the sound of persons as-
cending the stairs, called his attention. It had been the
surgeon's express injunction that the earl should be
kept perfectly quiet; and as the sounds approached the
chamber in which he lay, Langford started up and moved
towards the door, in order to caution the new com-
ers to make less noise. Before he reached it, however,
that door opened, and five or six persons unceremoni-
ously entered the chamber. The noise at once awoke
the earl, and, starting up on his arm, he exclaimed,
* Who is there !”
“It is I, my lord, your lordship's very humble ser-
vant, Sir Thomas Waller,” replied the first person who
entered; “no sooner did I hear that your lordship's
house had been attacked and set on fire, than I got on
horseback, with as many constables as I could gather
together, to come to your aid; and as my learned and
worshipful friend and cousin, Justice Whistler, from
London, the chief magistrate of police, happened to be
lodging in my poor house at the time, I besought him to
come over with me too.”
“Whether in regard to the fire or in regard to the
robbery,” replied the earl, cynically, “your coming is
somewhat late ; and as I am both wounded and in pain,
and have the express orders of my surgeon to remain
in perfect quiet, you will perhaps favour me by leaving
me to repose; and another time, before you bring
strangers into my room, do me the honour to inquire
whether it is my pleasure to receive you;” so saying, .
he laid himself down again, and turned his back upon
his unwished-for guests.

“This is a very extraordinary reception indeed,” said
a portly, keen-faced personage, who had followed Sir
Thomas into the room; “but, at all events, Sir Thomas,
we must do our duty. My lord, I am sorry to trouble
your repose.”
“You must trouble it no longer, sir,” said Langford,
advancing towards him, “but have the goodness at once
to leave the room.”
The worshipful Justice Whistler—for he it was who
had been speaking—calmly took a pair of spectacles
out of his pocket, placed them on his nose, and gazed
at Langford from head to foot.
“This is the young man, I take it, Sir Thomas,” he
said, turning to his companion: and, on a significant
nod from Sir Thomas Waller, he proceeded, “You are
the personage calling yourself Henry Langford, and
stand charged, I find, with the wilful murder of Edward
Lord Harold. On consulting with my good friend here
on the subject last night, aided by the wisdom of Sir
Matthew Scrope, I gave it as my decided opinion that
you should be immediately committed to the county jail,
having been left too long already in circumstances which
rendered it probable that the ends of justice might be
defeated.”
“What is this ? what is this?” exclaimed the earl,
starting up,
“Nothing, my lord,” replied the magistrate, “but that
this young man stands committed, upon a due warrant
to that effect, placed in the hands of these officers be-
hind me for execution.”
“Do you know, sir,” demanded the earl, sternly, “do
you know that he is my son?”
“We have heard something to that effect this night,”
rejoined the justice, in a sharp, dry tone; he evidently
having taken offence at the earl's first salutation, and
not having that reverence for his wealth and power which
was felt by his neighbours in the country; “we have
heard something to that effect this night; but, as I ob-
served to my good friend here, that only renders the
matter more probable. That your lordship's illegitimate
Son—” . >
“He is not my illegitimate son, sir,” replied the earl
“he is my legitimate child by my first wife.”
“It is very awkward, certainly,” answered the imper.
turbable Justice Whistler; “but, nevertheless, my lord,

we cannot help it. The law must have its course; and,
as I said before, the charge is but rendered the more
probable by the fact of his being your unacknowledged
son. To get an obtrusive heir out of the way is no
slight inducement; but, besides all that, there is quite
proof sufficient to justify his committal long ago. Here
they are seen to draw their swords upon each other.
The one rides away slowly up to the moor; the other
gets his horse and follows him at full speed, just as night
is closing in. The one is killed upon the moor, and his
horse returns all bloody! The other does not get back
till late upon that night, and then is in an evident state
of agitation. A pistol-shot is heard in that direction at
the very time he is there, and at the very spot to which
he is seen riding. My lord, my lord, the matter is quite
conclusive; and, though it is doubtless unpleasant, the
young gentleman must to prison '"
The earl gazed wildly but earnestly in the face of his
son, with feelings which those-who have read the steps
he had taken to bring about the very result that now
fell upon him like a thunderbolt may well conceive.
“I have done this!” he exclaimed; “I have done
this ! Oh, my son, I am your murderer !” and he turn-
ed away his head with an aguish shudder passing all
over his frame.
Langford, however, hastened to console him. “Oh
no,” he said, grasping the old man's hand; “oh no !
While you thought me guilty, you justly used all means
to punish the supposed murderer of your son, but—”
“You do not know,” replied the earl, with that with-
ering expression of heartfelt anguish that nothing but
remorse can give. “You do not know. I have pur-
sued you like a fiend! Your blood will be upon my
head; my own child's blood"
“Not so, my lord; not so,” replied Langford again.
“The worst will be but a few days’ imprisonment.
You know my innocence; I know it too, and know
that it can be proved with ease. That which gives me
the greatest pain at this moment is to be deprived of
the opportunity of watching by and attending you till
you shall have recovered from your wounds. It grieves
me, it is dreadful to me, to leave you to the hands of
menials. My lord, there will be one comfort to me,
one consolation in prison, which, as the first favour I
have ever asked you, you must grant me. There is a

lady in this vicinity, kind, and gentle, and tender; your
son's promised bride, Mistress Alice Herbert, I mean.
Will you let me sit down and write her a few lines, be-
seeching her, during my enforced absence from my fa-
ther's sickbed, to attend him as if she were his daugh-
ter. I know that it will be an office which she will love
to fulfil, not more for my sake than for yours. Pray let
me do so?”
The earl’s eyes had been cast down, and the thick
eyebrows had gathered heavily over them; but he did
not speak, for the knowledge of all he had done lay
weighty on his heart, and took away all utterance.
Sir Thomas Waller, however, took upon himself to
reply. “Your writing, young gentleman, would be use-
less,” he said; “for I am sorry to tell you that Sir Wal-
ter—who, though a hasty and passionate man, and
sometimes very disrespectful to persons fully equal to
himself, is a very good man, and much liked in the
country—was arrested yesterday evening at the suit of
the noble earl here. Indeed, he would have been ar-
rested in the earlier part of the day, but the country
people rose and rescued him.”
“This, too,” exclaimed the earl, setting his teeth, “I
have done this ! I have done this!”
“Your worthy lawyer, my lord,” continued Sir
Thomas, whose mind was one of those shallow ones
that cannot comprehend any deep and powerful emo-
tion, even when they see its workings before their eyes,
“your worthy lawyer, my lord, Master Kinsight, was
#, roughly handled by the people, and is likely to
e.
“Curse him !” said the earl, in a low, deep voice;
“curse him He is one of the vile instruments, the
ready tools of wrong.”
“May I ask you, sir," interposed Langford, with no
slight anxiety now thrilling in his bosom, “may I ask
you, who seem to know the particulars of the whole
affair, what has become of Mistress Alice Herbert under
these distressing circumstances!”
“She chose to go with her father, I was informed,”
replied the knight; “I dare say Master Bolland made
her pay dear for permission to do so. He is not a man
to grant anything without a consideration.”
“And has worthy, kind-hearted, noble Sir Walter
Herbert,” exclaimed Langford, with the anguish of his

heart making itself apparent in every feature, “has he
fallen into the hands of that well-known, that infamous .
knave and peculator, whose very existence as an officer
of the law, even though in the lowest grade of degraded
offices, is a disgrace to this free country; whose acts
make the capital of England notorious for monstrous
injustice, and for the daily infraction of every social
law, of every moral feeling, and of every sacred right!
Has he—has he—simple, unguarded, plain, and true !
fallen into the hands of one whose whole soul is fraud,
corruption, perjury, and baseness? Yet how can this
be 3’ he continued, after a moment's pause; “I myself
furnished the money to pay this debt. I do not com-
prehend it.” * *
“I have done this, too. I have done this, too,” re-
plied the earl, in a tone of profound despondency. “I
refused to receive the money; I seized upon it as
the property of a felon. Bitterly, bitterly do these
things fall upon my head; bitterly, oh, how bitterly, is
the punishment of all coming upon me!”
There was a deep silence, for Langford’s heart was
wrung, and he could give him no consolation. After a
moment or two, however, the earl started up in bed, ex-
claiming, “This, this at least can be amended. This,
this at least can be repaired. Give me the pen and ink;
quick!”
He was obeyed immediately, and with a trembling
hand he wrote a full acquittal of all debt from Sir Wal-
ter Herbert to himself, principal and interest, costs and
charges; nothing was omitted.
“There,” he said, putting it in Langford's hands,
“there is the first act of atonement which I have been
able to accomplish. Take it, my son, take it. The
writing those lines has given me the first happy mo-
ment I have known for years. Oh, misery of violent
passions indulged ! thou fiery curse that makest even
gratification a torment ! Had I but known, had I but
known what it is to refrain : Stay,” he continued, as
Langford was taking the paper, “stay. These wounds
and this weakness have made my hand shake, and such
men as now stand by us, cunning lawyers and wise
justices as they are, may hereafter swear that the wri-
ting is not mine. Here, Sir Thomas Waller, here,
worthy Justice Whistler, favour me by placing to this
act the testimony of your hands.”

“But, my lord,” exclaimed Mr. Justice Whistler.
“But me no buts, sir,” replied the earl, fixing his keen
feverish eyes upon him; “I know what you would say;
I know what your lawyer-like seeking for a flaw would
suggest, that no consideration has been given, and that,
therefore, the deed will not be legal. But I tell you,
sir, that a consideration has been given; that the money
in full was paid into my hand this morning, and will be
found in my library, if that library have escaped the
flames. Sign, sir, sign' that is all you have to do.
Witness that this is my act and deed!”
The two justices put their hands to the paper; and,
to render Sir Thomas Waller but simple justice, he did
so freely and willingly enough; not so exactly worthy
Mr. Justice Whistler, who showed no slight disinclina-
tion and hesitation in even witnessing an act which
might take a fellow-creature from out of the clutches
of the law. ...Twice, when he had got his hand to the
paper, he withdrew it, and paused for a moment in
thought, longing apparently to find some excuse or some
motive for refusal. At length, however, he signed it;
and the earl gave it to Langford, saying, “There, my
son, take it, and use it for your friend's deliverance.”
“I beg your pardon, my lord,” said the justice, again
interposing; “but this gentleman will have no oppor-
tunity of acting in the matter. You had better trust it
to me.” -
“Wonderful impudence 1" cried the earl. “What!
give meat to the harpies! Out upon it, man! do you
think I would trust you with any feasible means of
hurting your fellow-creatures 1”
“My lord,” answered the justice, sharply, “if I am to
judge by your own words lately used, your sarcasm is
as much applicable to your lordship as myself.”
“You say true, man; you say true,” replied the earl.
“But, though I be a wolf, I will not trust a wolf; I know
-ou all too well. My son,” he continued, turning to
angford, “are they really going to take thee from me
at this painful hour?”
“I fear, my lord, that such is really their purpose,”
replied Langford. “I will not insult these gentlemen .
by saying that they know me to be innocent, though I
must say that they seem very willingly blind to inno-
cence. But they are resolved, my lord, to carry the
taatter through to the last, and therefore it may be as

well to bring this scene, painful and terrible as it must
be to you, to an end as soon as possible.”
“Stay yet a while, stay yet a while,” cried the earl,
grasping the hand that he held out to him ; “I feel that
it is terrible to see you go, for perhaps, my son, we
may never meet again. We may never meet in this
world. We may never meet in the world to come;
that dark and awful world towards which I am speeding,
quickly, quickly!”
“Oh, say not so,” replied Langford; “I trust, nay, I
hope, I am sure, that my innocence will so speedily be
made manifest by one means or another, that in a very
few days, perhaps a few hours, I shall again sit beside
you; and I trust then to find you better.”
The earl shook his head. “Too late found,” he said,
“too early lost. I now feel how I could love you. I
see your mother's spirit shining out of your eyes. I see
that spirit which pardoned and gave way but too much,
looking mildly upon me; upon me, who wronged both
her and you so deeply; but it is all in vain.” And, as
he spoke, he pressed his hands over his eyes; and Lang-
ford, willing to spare him any further agitation, took
that moment to make a sign to Justice Whistler, signi-
fying that he was ready, and turned towards the door.
The earl heard his step, however, and exclaimed,
“Oh, not yet, not yet!” but Langford opened the door,
and called Bertha with a loud voice.
The French woman came immediately, for she was
sitting watching in the neighbouring chamber.
“Look to my father,” said Langford; “you, who were
a witness of my mother's marriage; you, who owe my
race so much; you—”
“You,” she interrupted, “you would say, you who
have repaid their kindness so ill—”
“No,” answered Langford, “such was not my thought.
You, who have had a share in all the turns of my
wayward fate, look to my father, now on his couch
of illness; look to him, tend him well, and, if you feel
that you have injured me or mine, make up for it now
by keeping his mind as free from all anxiety as may be,
by shutting out all that can agitate or alarm him, by
speaking cheerfully and hopefully of my fate, and by
teaching him that there is much yet to be done on earth,
much yet to be gained from heaven. Take this paper :
also. You will see its value at once. Find somebody

—if there be such a being on earth-in whom you can
place implicit trust. Send him to seek out Sir Walter
Herbert, who is in the hands of the notorious, infamous
John Bolland. Let him give the paper to Sir Walter
himself, requesting him, from me, to send for some law-
yer of high repute in London, and not to act himself in
the matter. Tell him, tell Alice, not to fear for me, for,
being innocent, my innocence must appear. They may
aid me if they find means; but, at all events, I am safe
in my integrity. But, above all things, be careful to
whom you trust the paper.”
“I will,” she answered, “I will; but you will soon bo
able to follow out these things-yourself. I know it, 1
feel sure of it.” -
“So do I,” replied Langford; “but Alice and Sir Wal
ter must not languish till then. Now, gentlemen, there
but remains to crave a father's blessing, and then I am
ready. I mean to use no threat towards you, Mr. Jus-
tice Whistler; but the time may come when the share
you have had in this matter will be fully inquired into,
and the legality of your proceedings investigated and
ascertained.”
“I will look to that, sir,” replied the justice, with a
calm and sneering nod of the head; “I have taken care
of myself in more difficult circumstances than these,
and, doubtless, shall be able to do so still.”
Langford made no reply, but re-entered the room
where the earl sat gazing upon the door and listening
to the sound of his voice.
The young gentleman advanced direct towards him,
and knelt by the side of his bed. “My father,” he said,
“give me your blessing !” - -
The earl turned away his head. “What, oh! what is
my blessing worth !” he said; “but be it so. My bless-
ing, the blessing of a father's fondest affection, be upon
you. I have none now but you!”
“If you would render that blessing of effect,” replied
Langford, “remember that on your life and health my
fate may greatly depend. Be careful, then; cast away
from you every thought and every feeling that may in-
jure or agitate you, and strive for life and health, if not
for your own sake, for your son's. Now, gentlemen, I
am ready.”
The two justices and the constables accompanied him
out of the room. “What think you of it !” asked Sir

Thomas Waller, addressing his companion in a whisper
as they went.
The London magistrate replied by a peculiar contor-
tion of countenance; and then added, “We must make
as good a case of it as we can, if it be but to bear our.
selves harmless.” -

CHAPTER VII.
WE must now leave that part of the country to which
we have so constantly adhered during the former part
of this true history, and lead the gentle reader with us
along a road which perhaps he may never have travelled
before, but which, if he ever have, he will doubtless re-
member at once from the description we are about to
give.
Setting off in a line lying northwest from the little vil-
lage of Moorhurst, and proceeding over the wild heath
to which we have so often turned our steps, one road
leads, as the reader already knows, to the county town,
after various turnings and meanderings, of which our
ancestors were undoubtedly more fond than ourselves.
But in one of these turnings the road effects an object
very different from the usual one of merely going out
of its way, and branches off into a country road taking
the direction of various small and remote towns.
Now, from the want of care and neatness with which
this branch road was kept at that time, it would, in all
probability, have presented a very much larger propor-
tion of ruts and sand than the larger road from which it
was derived, and would have required double the time
to travel each individual mile along its course which
was required upon its parent road, had it not been for
one circumstance. That circumstance was an extraor-
dinary development of a stratum of very hard stone in
that part of the country, which, taking the place of the
sand just a quarter of a mile from the spot where the
two roads separated, afforded, or, rather, might have af-
forded, equal pleasure and admiration to Mr. M'Adam,
the geologists, and all the members of the stonoclastic
race, if the period we speak of had not been before ge

ologists were discovered, and when Mr. M‘Adam was
yet unborn.
On it, if horses had been in the habit of going as fast
as they do now, a carriage might have been drawn at
* * any given rate of velocity, till, after the road had pass-
ed through two or three small villages and towns, and
* a space of about twenty miles, when it again got into
., the sand, and then plunged like an eel—which it very
'much resembled in some other respects—into a deep
‘" mud. -
• * This state, however, lasted not long; but, issuing like
a bittern from the morass, the road took its flight over
the hills, which were low, wooded, and well cultivated
for about twenty miles farther, and then began to as-
sume a wilder and more barren aspect, till at length,
when their summits were crossed, and at the distance
of about sixty miles from Moorhurst, they presented on
their northern side a wide range of rough, chill, rocky
country, covered alone by short brown turf, from which
the sheep had much ado to nibble a scanty subsistence,
and decorated alone by fine hawthorns and hanging
birches, except where, in the deeper dells, the oak and
elm had sought and found a friendly shelter.
Forges, and founderies, and manufactories of various
kinds have since blackened and enlivened that part of
the country; but, at the period which I speak of, the
great demon of civilization had not gone forth, with a
smoky chimney in one hand and a steaming kettle in
the other, equalizing and vulgarizing the whole earth;
and a track of about forty miles in length and from ten
to fifteen in breadth was left upon the side of those
hills, if not without any sign of man's habitation, at
least without any sign of his arts, except, indeed, the *
patriarchal one of sheep-feeding. -
Here and there, in the nooks and dells, indeed, an old
farmhouse, which perhaps might boast a few acres of
cornland around it, showed the dwelling-place of the
great sheep-farmer, who, riding over the hills adjacent,
might generally say, “I am monarch of all I survey.”
But these had never been many; and the loneliness of
the situation, an increasing taste for towns and luxuries,
and various changes in the state of society, on which it
is not worth while to dwell, had diminished the amount
of inhabitants to even a more scanty number than it
had once contained. Two farms had often been joined

in one; some of them were untenanted, and encroached
upon by their neighbours; some of the few houses that
did exist were vacant, and some were tumbling down.
It is to a house in this district, about five miles from
‘he spot where the road we have mentioned crossed it,
that we must now bring the reader, begging him diligently
to mark the outside of it, in the first place, seated as it
is in a deep gap in the hills, sheltered on three sides by
a grove of fine old elms, in the topmost branches of *
which innumerable rooks make the air musical with
their sweet country sounds; the house itself placed upon
a high bank, with its small windows overlooking a little
stream below, and the other side turning towards its
farmyard, with a cartroad, indeed, leading up to it, but
requiring both very strong horses and very strong carts
to undertake the rough and perilous ascent.
This house was not one among the uninhabited ones
which we have mentioned, for, at the period whereof
we speak—namely, but a few days after the events
had taken place which we recorded in our last chapter
—the farmyard might be heard ringing with several
voices, and more than one horse stamped in the stables.
Leaving the house, however, let us speak of one of its
inhabitants. About midday a solitary personage issued
forth from the gates, took his way into the deepest part
of the grove, and, with his arms crossed upon his broad
chest, walked slowly up and down, bending the bitter
brow and gnawing the dissatisfied lip, while his eyes
were bent on the dry leaves of the past year, and his
feet left deep marks in them as he strode along. After
thus wandering in the shade for some time, as if the
gloomy shadow was congenial to his feelings, he raised
his brow and looked up, seeming to seek higher associ-
tions in the sky above. Whether the feelings within
his breast did become more free and clear or not, he
then turned his steps to the hillside, and climbed high
up, gazing over the wild, waste prospect below, and
pausing every two or three minutes, as if endeavouring
to fix more distinctly some particular spot. Yet his
thoughts were neither of the scene on which his eyes
rested, nor of the cultivated country beyond, nor of the
towns and villages, the haunts and resting-places of
busy man, but, on the contrary, they were fixed upon the
deep, dark recesses of an erring human heart; on the
troubled world of his own bosom; where, as in the

workd covered by the deluge, the dove of peace found
no resting-place, so overwhelmed was the whole by the
waves of sin, and sorrow, and remorse. Upon that tur-
bulent ocean, too, floated the wrecks of many bright
things past; high feelings, noble aspirations, manly gen-
erosity, steady friendship, warm affections; and over it
spread at that moment dark clouds of doubt, and suspi
cion, and morose discontent, springing from self-dissat-
*isfaction, and disappointment, and internal reproach.
Such was the state of mind of Franklin Gray as he
strode along the hillside, pondering the events of the
last few weeks, and finding in all matter of bitterness
and regret. His feelings suffered some alteration when
he got upon the hill, turning to more material objects.
They did not exactly make themselves audible, but nev-
ertheless, to his own mind, they clothed themselves in
words, and the tenour of those words was somewhat
to the following effect.
“This is wild enough and solitary enough, but, nev-
ertheless, they will doubtless try to hunt me out here.
So great an enterprise as this cannot, in this pitiful and
servile land, pass without stirring up all the great tyrants
of the soil to put down him who has dared to strip them
of their ill-gotten wealth. Doubtless they will hunt me
out even here; and, by the Lord, I nave a thousand
minds to stay and dare them, and defend my mountains
till the last. But then these fellows,” he added, after
some thought, “though brave and true in the moment
of danger, now that we have divided the money, are all
anxious to leave me and hasten up to the great city, to
spend it in rioting and luxury. Well, I must not blame
them! I felt so once myself. But this land, then, must
be no more for me; I must leave it, and take myself
back again to those more ardent and free countries
where I can roam at large, and where, with a strong
hand and a stout heart, I can make the miser, and the
extortioner, and the slavemaster pay for his pitiful life
at the price of gold. Yet this, indeed,” he continued,
“has been a glorious booty; what between gold and
jewels we have swept off a mighty sum, and my own
share might well content me for the rest of my days.
Why should I not cross the seas, and, in some of those
sweet valleys by the higher Rhine, pass through the
calm close of a busy life in bright tranquillity?”
And, as he thus thought, a vision of sweet and peace- .

ful things, such as his heart had sometimes longed for
but had never known, rose up before his eyes; and he
pictured to himself sweet wanderings through fair
scenes, with his beautiful Mona by his side, and his
lovely boy growing up into proud manhood under his
eye. But, as he thought of Mona, a sudden shadow
came across him; it was a mood he struggled with and
would fain have conquered, but it was one unconquera-
ble; for it was a part of his dark fierce nature; and
after pausing gloomily for several minutes, and casting
his eyes down upon the ground, with his whole feelings
changed in a moment by one gloomy thought, he burst
forth aloud, “I love it not ! She would not wrong me,
I know she would not wrong me; but still she is too
tender of him. If she give her heart's affections to an-
other, if she even take from me the smallest portion of
those feelings that once were mine alone, she leaves a
gap, a vacancy, a break in that deep intense love which
is enough, but not too much for love like mine. Shall
I speak to her thereon? shall I tell her what I feel?
Ay, and make her think me jealous,” he answered, with
a bitter sneer even at himself. “I jealous! jealous,
too, of such a weak, pitiful, effeminate thing as that :
No; she shall go on in her own way. She must have
seen that I loved it not; she must have felt that it dis-
pleased me; and see it and feel it she shall still, but
speak of it I will never. Doubtless she is there now,
soothing him, tending his wounds, speaking to him sweet
kindly words, and listening to his soft gratitude. I will
go back and mar the sunshine;” and, as he spoke, with
a cloudy, moody air, he strode back again towards the
house, passed through the farmyard, and entered the
door, which stood open.
Proceeding up a tall narrow stone staircase, he passed
one of his men seated on one of the landing-places at
the last story but one, so as to prevent any one from
ascending or descending without being seen. Franklin
Gray was not one, even when the dark and debasing
passions of jealousy and suspicion were roused within
him, to commit a mean or a pitiful act; and he spoke
loud to the man upon the stairs, and trod heavily up, so
that his voice and his footsteps might give notice of his
coming to those above.
When he reached the upper story he opened a door
before him, and entered a room. poorly and scantily fur

nished, where were two persons with whom the reader
is already acquainted. The first—who sat near the door,
with her small beautiful foot resting upon a rude stool,
and her knee supporting an instrument of music in shape
much resembling a guitar-was that lovely being whom
we have twice before had occasion to mention under
the name of Mona, the wife of Franklin Gray. She was
finishing a song when he entered, a sweet, plaintive
song, in the tongue of some distant land; and, as he
came into the room, her dark lustrous eyes grew still
brighter, and were raised to his with a smiling and a
happy look, as if she thought she was doing what would
please him best, and that the well-known music would
awaken some sweet thoughts in her husband's bosom.
The stern, unmoved gloom of his countenance pained,
but did not surprise her, for she was accustomed to his
moody temper; and, loving him still at all times and in
all states, attributed his ill-humour to things which had
gone wrong in matters with which she had no concern.
The other person who tenanted that room was one
whom we have lost sight of for some time. It was Ed-
ward, called Lord Harold, who now, very pale, and evi-
dently but just recovering from severe sickness, leaned
back upon his chair with his head resting on his arm,
and the right side of the loose west which he wore cut
open and tied, so as to give greater ease and space to
some wounded part beneath. So intently had he been
listening to the music, that he scarcely heard the en-
trance of Franklin Gray, and a faint but expressive smile
hung upon his pale lip, while the vacant gazing of his
eye upon the floor told that the melody had borne ima-
gination on its wings afar, and that he was enjoying
sweet fancies removed from all that surrounded him.
“I see,” said Franklin Gray, looking earnestly at
Mona, “that you have turned his musician as well as
nurse.”
Mona started and gazed inquiringly in her husband's
face. “Did you not wish me to do so?” she said, with
her sweet-toned voice and foreign accent; “did you not
tell me to do everything I could to sooth him and restore
him to health ?”
“I did so,” replied her husband; “and I see you do
it willingly.”
Mona gazed in his face with a bewildered look, as if
she did not comprehend his meaning; for, though his

words were not ungentle, they were spoken in that tone
which showed the feelings that prompted to be bitterer
than the expression. There succeeded a pause for one
or two minutes; and Franklin Gray, moving across the
room, cast himself into a chair near the window, and
gazed out gloomily over the wide prospect that stretched
afar beneath his eyes, diversified only by the slopes of
the hills, without town, or village, or hedgerow to mark
man's habitation or his cultivating hand. As he sat
there he spoke not to any one, and the silence grew
painful, till at length it was broken by Lord Harold, as
we shall continue to call him, who said, “I am glad of
an opportunity of speaking with you, for I want to know
more precisely how I am situated. I have to thank you,
I find—”
“For mothing, sir!” replied Franklin Gray; “I have
done what I have done for my own pleasure and conve-
nience, and you have to thank me for nothing.”
“Such is, perhaps, the case, sir,” replied Lord Harold,
coolly; “at all events, you saved my life when I should
otherwise undoubtedly have bled to death upon the
moor. You have since treated me kindly and skilfully;
have nearly cured a wound which might have proved
fatal, and have tended me with much attention. At the
same time, from various events which have occurred;
from my being brought forth across the downs and
placed in a coach which carried me hither, as well as
from having seen at all times an ill-looking fellow with
a pistol in his hand sitting at the foot of the next flight
of steps when I crossed from one room to the other, I
am inclined to believe that you view me in some sort as
a prisoner.”
“Doubtless the ill-looking fellow, as you call him,”
replied Franklin Gray, with a bitter smile, “may find
many of the fair and the gay, in his own rank of life,
who would think him fully as good-looking as Edward
Lord Harold. However, sir, I gather from your dis-
course that you wish to learn whether you are to con-
sider yourself as a prisoner or not. Now, as you ac-
knowledge that you owe me your life, I do not think
you have any right to consider it a hard case, even
should I, for my own convenience, keep you a prisoner
for a certain time.”
“Yes, I have, sir,” replied Lord Harold; “for I sup-

pose there is scarcely any Englishman who does not
feel that liberty is preferable to life.”
“Then perhaps the best way of settling it,” answered
Franklin Gray, sternly, “would be to shoot you through
the head, and thus leave the account between you and
me as it stood before.”
But, as he spoke, Mona had advanced gently to his
side, and laid her hand upon his arm: “Oh, set him
free!” she said, “set him free as soon as he is able to
depart.”
“What is it to you, Mona?” demanded Franklin Gray,
turning sharply upon her: “what is it to you? why
should you wish him to depart 1"
“It is much to me, Franklin,” she answered, “very
much to me; and I do wish him to depart, for you have
twice looked cold upon me since he has been here,
which you never in your life did before, and anything
which makes such a change I wish instantly away; for
you know, Franklin, that your kind looks are to me like
the sunshine of my own happy land; sunshine that I
have left far behind ”
Franklin Gray was somewhat moved, and, seeing that
he was so, she went on, saying, “Oh, set him free, my
husband! and, if it be needful, make him swear that he
will never betray your abode. I will be answerable for
it, he will keep his word ”
Franklin Gray had been moved for a moment, and he
had also thought of setting Lord Harold free, or of only
detaining him till all was prepared for executing his own
purpose, of crossing the sea and seeking other lands;
but the last few words which his wife uttered hardened
his heart in a moment. * ,
“You will be answerable !” he exclaimed. “What
have you to do with being answerable for him? No. I
will not set him free ! If you choose to betray your
husband, woman, and open the doors to him whom it
is needful to detain, you can do it when you like. I
shall neither watch nor stop you; but the consequence
be upon your own head.”
Thus saying, he turned upon his heel with a frowning
brow, and hastily left the room, after which his steps
might be heard slowly descending the stairs. Mona
sunk down into the chair beside her, clasping her hands
together, and fixing her eyes upon the ground with a
look of despair; for they were the first harsh words.
-

the first unkind and ungenerous expressions, which had
ever dropped from the lips of him she loved, from the
day on which she had sacrificed kindred, and home, and
fortune, and her native land, to follow his uncertain foot-
steps through the world. As she sat there, with that
look of deep despondency, Lord Harold could not but
feel admiration of her exquisite beauty mingling even
with the compassion which he felt; and there was
something of that admiration apparent in his look and
manner as he slowly rose from his chair, and, crossing
the room, took her hand in his, saying, “He treats you
harshly, lady.”
But Mona, suddenly recalled to recollection by that
action and those words, started up, and drew her hand
quickly from him, gazing upon him with a look of anger
and indignation. “Treats me harshly 1” she said; “it
is false! He is kindness itself; and he is right, too !
What had I to do meddling with his purposes or his
will? I have been sorry for you, young gentleman,
and compassion has led me to do a foolish thing, but I
will take care so to offend no more;” and, thus speak-
ing, she left him, and hurriedly sought her husband
below.
She found him in a lower room, gazing forth as he
had done above, but the expression of his countenance
was more sad and less fierce than before. Mona ad-
vanced towards him, but he heeded her not; she laid
her hand upon his arm, but he did not turn his head.
She was a creature of noble impulses, however, and,
where her heart prompted, she would not be repelled.
The tears, indeed, sprang to her eyes and ran over her
cheeks, but still she cast herself on her husband's bo-
som, saying, “I have done wrong, Franklin; I should
not have interfered where you thought fit to act. I was
sorry for the young man, and I thought that he might
have friends and relations, and perhaps a wife, that
loved him as I love you, and I wished you to send him
back to his happy home on that account. But I was
wrong to speak of it at all, and still more wrong to speak
of it before him. Forgive me, Franklin, I will not of-
fend again.”
Franklin Gray pressed her to his heart and kissed the
tears off her cheek; and—although the seed of suspicion
and doubt, once sown in a soil so congenial to it as his
mind, can never, perhaps, be wholly eradicated, take

what pains we will—yet he was anxious to feel as he
had felt, somewhat ashamed of having given way to
such bitterness towards her who was associated with
all the better spirits of his heart's dark tabernacle, and
grieved to see the grief of one who had brought the
only real sweet sunshine on his path that he had known
through life.
He pressed her, then, to his bosom; he treated her
gently and kindly; and once more, to her powerful gen
tleness, the fierce and lionlike spirit of her husband was
softened and bowed down.
She had not said one word of the dark shade of jeal.
ousy which had shown itself in Franklin Gray's first
words to her. She was far too wise to comment on it,
or to attempt to do it away by any eloquence but those
of acts. She saw it plainly, however; she felt that

stood by her husband; and, from a certain vague ex-
ression on Lord Harold's face when last he spoke to
er, she feared that, with him, man's vanity had once
more misjudged woman's best feelings.
She blamed herself, however, more than either: “I
should have known,” she thought, “that man cannot
see into the heart;” and from that hour she went near
the prisoner no more. She gave no cause for so ab-
staining, and she took care that the woman who accom-
panied her should provide for his comfort as far as might
be. It is the meed of such conduct, however, almost
always to pass unremarked; the recompense, the suc-
cess, is in our own hearts.
Franklin Gray saw that she was less with the pris-
oner than before, but he did not see that she was never
with him at all. *
CHAPTER VIII.
HAviNG now exposed to view the state of mind o,
Franklin Gray, we must turn once more to Lord Harold,
and display, in some degree at least, the feelings by which
he was affected. His heart was one naturally kind; his
impulses were, in general, noble and generous; but he

had derived from his mother a strong degree of that
quality which, more than any other of the human heart,
lays our hearts open to evil passions, unless it be very
early enlisted on the side of the good ones; I mean
pride.
From his father, too, had descended to him various
faults and peculiarities, which, if everything had gone
smooth with him through life, might have lain dormant,
or, under particular circumstances, might have assumed
the aspect of virtues, when, in fact, they were much
more nearly allied to vices. There was, when roused
by anger or stimulated by hatred, a degree of remorse-
less determination about his character very much re-
sembling that of Lord Danemore. This had shown it-
self in a degree in his conduct towards Langford; but,
since that period, all the bad points in his nature, which
had been originally brought forth by his disappointment
in regard to Alice, had been called into still greater ac-
tivity by the wounds he had received, by the irritation
of sickness, and by pondering in solitude and in a state
of confinement, not only over the disappointment of his
first and early love, but over the mortification which his
vanity had received, and over the annoyance of having
to remain at a distance from the scene of action, where
he knew, from the few words which Langford had
spoken to him, that great and important events were
likely to be transacted.
Under these circumstances a degree of angry irrita-
tion had taken possession of his mind; and, even on the
day when he was removed from the neighbourhood of
Moorhurst, he would have resisted had his strength been
sufficient to render opposition at all effectual. Besides
his own weakness, however, there was about Franklin
Gray a tone of command and authority, a decision, a
breaking forth of powerful intellect, which had the ef.
fect of producing, as the first impulse, an inclination to
obey in all that surrounded him; and Lord Harold felt
that power, and was angry with himself for feeling it.
He had determined, then, even before the period of
the interview which we have just described, to seek his
liberty by any means; and had the robber at once grant-
ed him what he sought, had he either soothed or rea-
soned with him, the whole current of the young noble-
man's feelings might have been changed, and he might
have learned to admire ": very qualities which now,

arrayed as they were in opposition to his wishes and
obnoxious to his pride, not only excited hatred, but cre-
ated a stern and bitter determination, both of taking
vengeance, which he called “inflicting punishment,”
and of triumphing over the pride of one whose mental
powers overawed him, which he called, again, “doing
justice.”
As he sat and listened to the brief discussion between
Franklin Gray and the beautiful creature that pleaded
for his liberty, his determination became more strong,
his purpose more decided; and though, to do him but
justice, vanity did not speak, and he entertained no def-
inite thought of striving to raise into warmer feelings
the compassion which he had excited in Mona's breast,
and of thus striking the robber in the most vulnerable
point, he could not, as we have before said, help feeling
a sensation of admiration mingling with his gratitude,
and sentiments rising up in his bosom which might easily
have become dangerous and evil.
The degree of scorn, also, which mingled in Franklin
Gray's tone in speaking of and to himself had neither
escaped his attention nor passed without producing its
natural effect; nor did the sudden coldness which came
over Mona diminish at all the strength of his determina-
tion to seek for vengeance in the shape of justice.
His first purpose, then, was to obtain his liberty as
soon as possible. The wound he had received was no
otherwise dangerous than from the great loss of blood
it had occasioned; and he felt that he was every day
and every hour recovering strength, which would soon
enable him to use any means he thought fit for regaining
his freedom. In order to do so, however, it would be
necessary, he saw, to engage the co-operation of some
one; and as the compassion of Mona Gray was already
enlisted on his side, he determined, in the first place,
to induce her, if possible, to aid him in escaping. Nor
did the consideration that by so doing he would render
her a party to the execution of his second purpose at
all deter him, though that second purpose was instantly
to take measures for apprehending her husband and
bringing him to the scaffold, having seen enough during
his confinement to remove all doubts from his mind as
to the real occupation and pursuits of him into whose
hands he had fallen.
During the whole of that day and the next, the ab-

sence of Mona Gray rendered his design abortive. He
looked for her coming in vain, though he often heard
the sounds of her voice speaking to her husband or
singing to her child. She never approached the rooms
to which he was confined; and though the woman who
attended on her came frequently to see that every-
thing was done which could ensure his comfort, Lord
Harold feared to trust a menial, and, consequently, still
remained in expectation of the other at length appear-
ing. When, towards the close of the second day, how-
ever, he found that his anticipations were not fulfilled,
he ventured to ask of the woman, “Why does not your
mistress ever come to see me now? Will her husband
not let her ?”
“Oh no,” replied the servant, “for he is out the
greater part of the day; but she is going out with him
just now herself, and will be out all night, I hear.”
Lord Harold took two or three turns up and down the
room with a sufficient degree of agitation to attract the
attention of the woman, who asked, in a peculiar tone,
if she could do anything to serve him.
“If you could go down,” said Lord Harold, “and
ask your mistress to speak with me for a few moments
before she goes, you would very greatly serve me. Do
it privately " he added.
The woman nodded her head and left him. She re-
turned in a few minutes, however, alone, seeming to
have met with a different reception from her mistress
to that which she expected. “She says she cannot
come,” replied she, to Lord Harold’s eager questions.
“If you want anything, she bade me tell you to speak
with Captain Gray himself, who will do anything rea-
sonable that you may desire.”
“Pray go down to her again,” said Lord Harold.
“tell her it is her I must speak with. That I beg, that
I entreat of her, by all the kindness that she has shown
me, to come and speak to me, if it be but for one min-
ute.”
“I don't like to go any more,” replied the woman;
“she answered me quite crossly, and the captain him.
self is there, sitting at the farther end of the room,
reading, with his brow as dark as that great black hill,
which looks as if it never saw the sun. ” .
Lord Harold pulled a ring from his finger, which was
the only thing of value on his person that had escaped
WoL. 11 -H

the hands of Wiley and Hardcastle, and held it out to-
wards the woman. “Will you do what I ask you,”
he said, “and have this for your reward 4” She was
not proof against the temptation; and murmuring, “He
cannot eat me if I do whisper again to his wife,” she
left the room and descended the staircase.
In a shorter time than before, she returned, however,
and with a still less satisfied countenance, saying, “She
says she will not come. She bids me tell you she will
not come; and, for my part, I’m to bring her no more
such messages, which I’m sure I would not do for
twenty rings; for there he sat while I whispered to her,
and, though he was so far off that he could not hear a
word, he looked up from his book and stared at me as
if his eyes had been words to run me through.”
Lord Harold turned away mortified. “It may be the
worse for all of us,” he said to himself; “it may be the
worse for all of us. There, woman, there is the ring I
promised you; take it.”
With a brightening countenance she received the gift,
which was, perhaps, more than she expected, as she
had failed in her errand; and then, descending the
stairs, Lord Harold heard her stop a moment, and appa-
rently speak with the man who kept watch on the story
below. -
“That must be my next resource,” he said to him-
self; “that must be my next resource. Perhaps I shall.
succeed better there.”
He then gazed for some time from the window, lay-
ing out his plans in his own mind, and feeling that,
though still somewhat weaker than he had hoped and
expected to have been, he must take advantage of the
temporary absence of Franklin Gray, lest such another
opportunity should not occur again speedily. The win-
dows of the room in which he was looked out over the
high bank which we have mentioned in describing the
house, so that, in addition to the three stories below
him in the building itself, there was at least a descent
of forty feet perpendicular between him and the road.
To let himself down from the windows, therefore, was
utterly hopeless; and nothing remained but to bribe the
man who guarded him, if such a thing were possible.
. How that object was to be effected was the great
difficulty, for he had been stripped of everything upon
him when he was stopped upon the moor except the

ring which he had given to the woman; and a man in
the situation of him who kept watch below was not
likely to take promises for payment.
While he still gazed and revolved all these matters
in his mind, he saw Franklin Gray and his wife, habited
like two of the higher class of peasantry, and mounted
on two strong horses, ride slowly down the road, and
take their way across a track which lay between the
upper hills and the flatter country below. He watched
them for some time as they rode along, and shortly
after he saw two other persons issue forth and take a
different direction. . During a few moments their de-
parture was succeeded by some loud talking and laugh-
ing in the house itself, which soon ceased, however;
and, shortly after, the voice of the man at the foot of
the stairs was heard calling aloud, as if to the female
servant, “Come up here, Harriet, come up here and
chat to us a bit. Curse me if I'm not lonely. Bring
the child with you if you don’t like to leave it.”
“Now is my time,” thought Lord Harold; “doubt-
less they are all out but these two, and I may deal with
them without interruption.” He accordingly advanced
to the door, and, opening it, walked out to the head of
the stairs. The sound of his step, however, instantly
attracted the attention of the man below, and he started
up with the pistol in his hand, exclaiming, “What do
you want?”
“I want to speak with you, my good sir,” replied
Lord Harold.
“Well, what is it?” rejoined the man, in a surly tone;
“speak! I can hear!” - -
“That will scarcely do,” said the young man; “it
you like to come up here, I can speak to you at my ease,
for I have a good deal to say, and much that may be to
your advantage.”
The man hesitated, but then replied, “I can't come
now, for I’ve called to Harriet to come and talk to me;
but I will come by-and-by.”
“Come now,” replied Lord Harold, “and bring the
woman with you.” -
“Oh, oh! is that it?” said the man; “well, go in; I
will come.” -
Lord Harold felt that he was treated with scanty
ceremony; that he, the eldest son of a proud and
haughty peer, in the midst of a free land, where the

very thought of anything less than iiberty was in ab.
horrence, without any imputed guilt or any liability in
the eye of the law, was held there as a prisoner, and
treated with degrading familiarity by a low and probably
guilty being. Nevertheless, he had an important ob-
ject before him, and a moment's reflection taught him
to master all feelings of irritation, and, according to the
somewhat sordid view of our great philosopher, submit
to indignities that he might rise above them.
He strode up and down the room once or twice, and
then listened for the steps that he hoped to hear coming.
For some time, however, nothing struck his ear except
a low murmur of voices from the story below, in which
he could distinguish the treble tones of the woman
and the deeper ones of the man; and he judged, and
judged rightly, that they were in earnest consultation
in regard to himself. Nearly a quarter of an hour
elapsed before the discussion ended, and they then en-
tered together; the woman with a bolder and freer air,
as one who had already taken two or three steps in the
course which they both saw was about to be laid before
them; the man with a look half sullen, half shy, as if
he doubted and hesitated still at a leap which he felt
morally convinced he should ultimately take. •.
Lord Harold paused, and gazed upon them both for a
moment, calculating what should be the tone and man-
ner which he ought to employ towards the persons
before him; and, after a moment's consideration, he
determined to act that part which was most congenial
to his own nature, not alone because he felt that he . .
should act it better than any other, but also because he
gathered from the man's countenance in an instant that
he was one of those low and grovelling animals who
would take advantage of the least condescension; who
might be overawed, who might be bribed, by those he
felt to be above himself, but who would harden himself
in opposition or raise the price of his services extrava-
gantly to any one who descended to his own level, or
who seemed to need his assistance so much as to court.
it at the expense of degradation.
Lord Harold accordingly threw himself into a chair,
and gazed full in the man's countenance with that look
of haughty consciousness which was in some degree
natural to him; and when he saw that he had beaten
down his gaze, he demanded, in a very different tone
*

from that which he had used before, “I suppose, sir
you know who I am?”
“Why, yes,” replied the man; “I have heard that
you are the son of that old Lord—”
“That is enough!” interrupted Lord Harold; “know-
ing, then, who I am, you must at once see that being
kept here in this state is disagreeable to me. Besides
which, important business requires my presence at
home.”
“Ay, that it does, if you knew all,” muttered the man
between his teeth.
Lord Harold continued, without taking any notice of
what he said, “You must very well know, also, that
anything which I promise I will execute fully.”
“Ay, that's what I don’t know,” replied the man.
“that's just what I was talking to Harriet here about,
for I know nothing of you; and it's just as likely as
not that, if I were to let you out this very night, instead
of doing anything that you said you would, you might
take and hang me for my pains. No, no; a bird in the
hand is worth two in the bush.” -
Lord Harold again felt angry and indignant; but he
would not give way to feelings which might in £ way
interfere with his plans; and, though his nostrils ex-
panded and his lips quivered, he mastered himself in a
moment, replying, “So you and Harriet have been set-
tling the whole business for me, and have, doubtless,
saved me a world of trouble, for you have most likely
made up your minds as to whether you will do what I
require or not.”
“Why, I think not,” replied the man, somewhat
staggered by the cool and decided tone in which the
prisoner treated the question; “I think not; but that de-
pends upon circumstances.” -
“On what circumstances?” demanded Lord Harold,
shortly.
“Why, you see, the matter is this,” answered the
man; “as far as I can judge, we shall all separate in
ten days or a fortnight, for every one is wanting to go
his own way. Now, you see, if the captain—that is,
Captain Gray—were going to remain in England, I
would as soon try to let you go as I would to jump out
of that window, being as sure of getting an ounce of
lead in my brains before the month was out if I did the
one thing as I should be of #ing my neck if I did the

other. But, then, I've a pretty rare inkling that the
captain and his lady are going across the seas; so that,
if you can make it worth my while in ready money to
hide myself away for a fortnight till they are off we
may very likely come to terms.” . -
“Ready money I have none,” replied Lord Harold.
“Ay, that's what I was saying,” interrupted the man;
“I knew very well that Hardy and Wiley left no more
money in your purse than there is in a dog's side-
pocket. So I don’t see—”
“But I do,” replied Lord Harold. “As far as I can
judge, from the direction which the carriage took that
brought me hither, from the time occupied in the jour-
ney, and from the aspect of the scenery round, we are
now somewhere in the Chalden hills, and the town of
––– cannot be far distant.”
“Some fifteen miles,” replied the man; “at least so
Harvey told me the other day; I have not been there
myself.”
“It cannot be much more,” said Lord Harold; “for I
have hunted over all these wastes many a time, and I
know the town well; for therein, as it is a seaport, lives
a rich merchant and banker of the name of Drury,
whom I have often employed in buying fine objects of
the arts; pictures, and statues, and such things from
Italy. He has even now in his hand a sum of near
three hundred pounds belonging to me, sent him to make
such purchases; and, if you will engage this night to
set me free, I, putting full confidence in your word, will
write an order upon him for the money. You can send
it by a messenger on horseback, who may easily be
back before nightfall; and then, dividing the amount
between you and your friend here, you can open the
doors for my escape.” -
“It's a pretty sum,” replied the man; “it’s a pretty
sum ; but let us have a little talk together, Harriet;”
and, drawing her to the farther corner of the room, he
consulted with the woman in a low voice for several
minutes.
Lord Harold watched them eagerly, and, as they con
versed, he could see the deep colours and shadows of
strange and bad passions rise in the countenance of
each, but especially of the female servant. At length
however, they grew calmer; their course seemed de

termined, and they returned, the man taking upon him
to speak, as before.
“What you offer, my lord,” he said, “does not ex-
actly suit us. We could not send to the town, as you
mention, without being discovered; for it is a small
place, and Captain Gray has gone there himself to-day,
to see about a ship, I fancy. His wife, too, pretty
Mistress Mona, would go with him; and, altogether, he
is in a fine humour, and, when that is the case, he has
more eyes and hands than other people. However, as
you showed you would trust us, we will trust you. Of
course you have got some banker in London town, and,
if you have a mind to double the sum you mentioned,
and give us an order upon London, Harriet and I will be
off together, and let you out, too, this very night. But
you must swear to us that the money shall be paid, and
that, when we go to get it, we shall not be dogged, and
that you will never appear against us in any way; and
that, if ever we are in trouble, you'll lend us a helping
hand, bearing witness that we let you out.”
“I pledge you my honour,” replied Lord Harold,
“most solemnly and most distinctly, not only never to in-
jure you in any way, but to bear witness, should need
be, that you have both served me faithfully in my need.
The sum you demand you shall have ; and now nothing
remains but to get me pen, ink, and paper, that I may
write my order upon the banker in London.”
“That will soon be done,” replied the man, “for there
is nobody in the house but ourselves, and we can do
what we like. Come along, Harriet; I hear the child
crying. I will be back again in a minute.”
“Now,” thought Lord Harold, when they had both
left the room, “this man will betray the master that
trusted him, disobey his commands, and, by letting me
out of his hands, put his life at my disposal, without
cven binding me by any promise not to bring him to jus-
tice; and this woman, trusted by a kind and gentle mis-
tress with the care of her sweet child, will leave that
child helpless while she schemes things that may de-
stroy the happiness of father, mother, and child for
ever. Such is fidelity in this world! Whom shall we
trust 1” -
As he thus thought, he might feel a momentary touch
of shame at using such tools and yet so critically ex-
amining their actions; but he felt no shame in owing

his life to Franklin Gray, and then, because the robber
detained him a few days longer than it suited his pleas-
ure, deliberately resolving to bring him to the scaffold,
veiling the darker features of such an-act under the
shining guise of justice. So human passions contrive
ever to conceal their real naturè from the eyes of those
that entertain them.
In a few minutes the man returned with pen, and ink,
and paper; but, before Lord Harold’s hand could draw
the order, the woman followed into the room, carrying
the child in her arms, and saying, “Be pleased to make
it half for him and half for me; for, though he prom-
ises to marry me, I like to have something in my own
hands.”
The woman was young and pretty, and the man only
laughed, replying, “You’re right, Harriet, you're right.
If every woman was as careful as you are, there would
be fewer faithless lovers in the world.”
The matter was arranged as she proposed; and, as
soon as it was concluded, Lord Harold demanded, “What
is to preventus executing our scheme now? Why should
we not set off at once 1”
“Only because we should be caught and brought
back again in five minutes,” replied the man; “and
while you might risk a bullet or two, I should certainly
get my brains blown out. Why, there is Harvey, and
little Bill, and all the rest of them, gone out with their
carbines turned into birding-pieces, for the purpose of
seeing what game they can get upon the hills. They
are scattered about all over the place, and we could
not go half a mile without risking to meet with some
of them. Besides, there's that young devil, Jocelyn,
lurking about in some of the dells, trapping wheatears
and such things, and we must take care to blind him,
for he's all eyes and ears together. No, no; one of
them has promised to come back to take my place in a
Bouple of hours; then I'll go out as if to sport, and mark
out our way across the country. I shall come on again
to watch about ten o’clock at night, and then, depend
upon it, they'll all be drinking as hard as they can drink
till they go to bed. Most of them will be drunk; and,
when they are all fast asleep, we can do what we will,
for Franklin Gray won’t be back till noon to-morrow;
£ you, and I, and Harriet here can take horses and be
Oli.

“And what will you do with the infant?” demanded
Lord Harold, looking to the woman.
“Oh, it sleeps all night,” she replied, “when once it's
put off, and they'll find it in the morning, and feed it till
its mother comes back.” •.
Lord Harold shut his teeth tight, but there was no
remedy for it, and he made no comment. He could not
help doubting, however, whether the order he had given
upon a London banker would be very safe in the hands
of this faithful couple, who might or might not make
use of the paper, and yet leave him as much a prisoner
as before. As he had given them the draughts, however,
he felt that it would be impolitic to demand them back
again; and, consequently, after arranging all the minor
particulars of their plan, he suffered them to depart,
carrying with them the unconscious child whom they
had brought to behold the betrayal of its parents’ trust.
The rest of the day passed over to Lord Harold with
no slight impatience and anxiety. In somewhat more
than the two hours which the man had mentioned, sev-
eral of the gang were heard to return and relieve the
guard, who was found sitting at his post below. The
voice of the woman, too, could be distinguished, carol-
ling at her work as gayly and lightly as if there had
been neither vice, nor guilt, nor folly at her heart ; and
from time to time the young nobleman could hear her
talking to the child as tenderly as if she had been its
mother. -
“Strange and contradictory human nature,” he
thought, “which can reconcile all these most opposite
things;” and, as do most people who comment upon
the actions of others, he forgot to look into the contra-
dictions of his own bosom.
Seldom had Lord Harold seen the sun go down with
such anxious feelings as he then experienced. The
voice of the boy Jocelyn was heard below, but the few
sounds to be distinguished in the house showed that
the greater part of the gang were still absent. Speedily,
however, other tongues were heard, and then came
several more, laughing, talking, and singing; and the
woman, when she brought him in lights, said, “They
are all come back, and are soon going to supper.”
The noise, after a short interval, increased rapidly,
and it was evident that wine began to do its work.
The rattling of dice was heard; then many a merry

song; some appropriate enough to the calling of those
who poured them forth, some as opposite as it was pos-
sible to imagine. Hour after hour passed by, and Lord
Harold fancied that the revel would never end; but
gradually the sounds became fewer as one after another
of the party fell asleep under the influence of wine, or
retired to rest from weariness. At length, after one
more general burst of merriment, the whole of the band
seemed to betake themselves to repose. Steps were
heard in different directions; a voice here and there
speaking to a companion; the dull end of some drowsy
ditty, hummed amid hiccoughs, as the half drunken rev-
eller stripped off his clothing; and then all was silent
throughout the mansion.
“Now,” thought Lord Harold, “I shall soon see
whether they will keep their word with me;” for he
could not shake off from his mind an impression that
they would prove as faithless to him as they had done
to Franklin Gray; and, as nearly an hour elapsed after
all was quiet without his seeing anything of any one,
he became more and more convinced that it was as he
had suspected. -
He was mistaken, however; for at length the door
of his room slowly opened, and the man, putting in his
head, beckoned to him to come out.
Lord Harold had been long prepared, and he instantly
followed the footsteps of his guide, who led him silently
down stairs into a wide, deep porch doorway, where the
woman Harriet was in waiting. Not a word was spo-
ken by any of the party, and the man then took his way
across the courtyard towards a long range of stabling
and outhouses which in former times had sheltered
many an honest and modest farmer's gelding, but which
now contained not a few of those animals which have
established for themselves an impudent reputation under
the title of “a highwayman's horse.” The man raised
the latch and pushed the door, but it resisted his efforts,
and, with a face full of dismay and bewilderment, he
exclaimed, “Hang me if Harvey hasn't locked the sta-
bles?” -
Lord Harold made no reply, but waited to see what
expedient he would propose, and very soon found that
it was one to which he was not at all inclined to submit,
namely, that of returning to the house and taking their
chance of another day.

“No,” he said, in a low tone; “no, my good friend!
I have determined to make my escape to-night or not
at all. I am out here with you and this good lady, and
nothing shall make me go in again. If there are no
horses to be found, we must go on foot.”
“But suppose I say you shall go in again,” replied
the man; “what then?” -
“Why, then,” replied Lord Harold, “I shall take care
to make my refusal in so loud a tone that some of the
good people who are asleep there shall hear it, and
come dwn to find you and this fair lady so far upon your
way, w śh an order upon my banker in your pockets.”
The man stood and glared at him for a moment, as
if he would have shot him where he stood; but at
length he said, with a slight stamp upon the ground,
“Wei, it's no use; I suppose we had best take our
way off on our own feet if we cannot get four legs to
carry us. One must risk something in this world; and
perhaps, after all, the clatter of those horses' feet might
have roused some of the fellows above. Come, Har-
riet my lass, you must try what you can do for a forced
marsh.”
Thus saying, he led the way out of the courtyard,
and bent his steps straight against the side of the hill.
He eemed to bear no malice towards Lord Harold for
having forced him to the decided step he had taken;
and when they were at a sufficient distance from the
house to permit of his speaking aloud without risking
anything, he said, “I found out this morning while I
was exploring, that if we take this way over the hill
between those two high knolls, we shall get into a littie
lane on the other side which leads down to a village
some ten miles off. Now we shall get there, I dare
say, before daylight, though it is tough work walking
up this hill, and there, I don't doubt, may get us horses
to take us on. If so, we part there, my young lord;
for it won’t suit me to travel with your lordship any
longer. I and Harriet will go on to London as fast as
we can, and I dare say you will be able to make your
way without us.”
“That I shall, easily,” replied Lord Harold, “even if
I go as far as that with you; but, most likely, I shall
stop before that.”
The truth was, that Lord Harold began now to feel
that he was much feebler than he had supposed; and

although they had not gone at this time above half a
mile since they first set out, it was with difficulty that
he kept up with his two companions. They showed
him some degree of kindness and consideration, how-
ever, slackening their pace for his convenience when
they found, on looking back towards the house they
had left, that no light nor any other sign whatever
announced that their flight had been discovered. A
strong effort of his determined nature enabled the
young nobleman to do more than many persons would
have effected in his situation, and he succeeded in
crossing the summit of the hill, and descending so far
on the other side as to arrive at the end of the wooded
lane of which his guide had spoken. There, however,
he was obliged to declare that he could go no farther;
and the reply of the man was, “Well, then, we must
leave you; for, of course, we can’t stop here; for, to
say the truth, I would rather meet the devil himself
than Franklin Gray after what has happened.”
“Go on, go on,” replied. Lord Harold; “go on, and
take care of yourselves. I will rest here for an hour
or two by these trees, and then, doubtless, shall be able
to go forward very well by myself.”
“Mayhap you would like a pistol, however,” said the
man, putting one into Lord Harold's hand; “I always
find them convenient;” and, without farther adieu, he
turned and left the young nobleman, who seated him-
self under one of the trees, with the darkness of the
night all around him. The other two went on ; and in
a moment after the woman's voice was heard in a loud
laugh, which Lord Harold doubted not was in some
way at his expense.
CHAPTER IX.
“LET us do everything formally. Let us do every-
thing formally,” said Sir Matthew Scrope to Sir Thomas
Waller, when the latter returned from the expedition
which we have already recorded to Danemore Castle,
at about eleven o'clock in the day. “Pray let us do
everything formally, or we may get into a scrape. In-

deed, what you tell me about this young man being the
earl's son makes me afraid we have got into a scrape
already. Ha! Mister Justice Whistler; is it not so?
ha!”
“What is life, my dear sir,” said Justice Whistler,
who was somewhat of a wag, and generally displayed
his talent for raillery upon any one he saw in mortal
terror or great anguish of mind, such as young prison-
ers brought before him for capital offences, and their
friends or relations; “what is life, my dear sir, but a
succession of scrapes? We get into a terrible scrape
when we enter it, surely, and an awful scrape in going
out of it. Then, between, there is love and matrimony,
two other sad scrapes; besides all the other scrapes,
such as the present, which we fall into between infancy
and dotage. The great art of life is to get out of our
scrapes cleverly. Now let us see how you will man-
age to get out of this; ha! ha! ha!” and he laughed
most uncomfortably close to the ear of his two fellow-
justices.
Sir Matthew Scrope was evidently in great anxiety
respecting the result, and bitterly regretted that a
rooted disinclination to rise by candlelight had pre-
vented him from going over to Danemore with his col-
league Sir Thomas Waller, whom he looked upon as a
rash young man, though he was at least fifty-eight
years of age. He had been in very great apprehension
before lest it should ultimately prove that the person-
age whom he had at first determined to be undoubtedly
guilty should prove entirely innocent; and the extra-
ordinary consequences of hearing that the earl ac-
knowledged him, not only as his son, but his legitimate
son, were, that he speedily not only began to doubt
whether the prisoner was guilty or not, but whether he,
Sir Matthew Scrope, had ever thought him guilty; and
he might very soon have worked himself up into the
belief that he had always maintained his innocence,
but had been overruled by Sir Thomas Waller.
The latter worthy knight was a man of courage of a
certain kind, that is to say, a sort of chameleon cour-
age, which took its colour from whatever was next to
it. As long as he had remained by Mr. Justice Whis-
tler, the cool, self-possessed resolution of the London
justice, who knew better than any man living how to
earry through what is called an unpleasant piece of

business, had kept him up, and bold measures were all
that he thought of; but the timid apprehensions of Sir
Matthew Scrope damped his fire most amazingly; and
when he found the London justice admit calmly that
they were in a scrape, the fire went out altogether
Both the country justices, being men of vivid imagi-
nations, instantly set to work to picture to themselves
all the evil consequences which might ensue from the
faux pas they had committed; and a sort of nervous
twitching came over Sir Matthew Scrope's whole per-
son, which afforded Mr. Justice Whistler much internal
satisfaction.
“Nay, nay, my good friend,” exclaimed Sir Matthew,
“these are no joking matters; and the only thing that it
seems needful to do now is to see how we may best
retreat from this business quietly.”
“Retreat from it!” exclaimed the London magistrate;
“nonsense! Face it out boldly! The man is just as
innocent of the murder as you or I; but what matters
that? Do your best to prove that he is guilty; then
there will be always so fair a case against him that you
will be justified in all you have done; and the more
vigorously you act against the earl’s own son, the
more credit you will get for the impartial administra-
tion of justice.”
But such bold counsels were not for Sir Matthew
Scrope; and Sir Thomas Waller, whose courage was
just now lukewarm, was more inclined to bold timidity
than anything else. “Let us discharge him at once,”
he exclaimed; “let us discharge him at once, and be
civil to him.”
“Nonsense, I say again,” replied Mr. Justice Whistler.
“What! discharge him without cause, after having
dragged him away from his dying father's bedside this
very morning? Would you make fools of us all!”
“No, no, that will never do,” said Sir Matthew
Scrope; “but, nevertheless, let us do things formally.
Let us have the young gentleman up for examination;
let us be civil to him, as Sir Thomas says. Perhaps
something may come out in his re-examination which
may show his innocence.”
“If it do not come out, you will squeeze it out, that
is clear,” rejoined Justice Whistler; “but the man
stands committed, the warrant is made out, and there
is nothing to be done but to send him to the jail. I am

sorry I did not send the constables on with him at
once.”
“I am very glad you did not,” said Sir Matthew.
“As to the warrant, it is but a bit of parchment, which
will shrivel up in my kitchen fire in a minute; and so
we will have him up into the justice-room to re-examine
him before we send him—”
“Back to his father,” said Justice Whistler, supply-
ing the words and shrugging his shoulders. “Well, if
you will act in such a way, I suppose I must help you
to do it gracefully. Let us go to the justice-room.
Call the clerk. Leave the whole business to me, and
do not be afraid. Whatever you may hear or see, I
will get you out of the business, and in your own way,”
he added, seeing his fellow-justices hesitate.
“Well, well,” replied Sir Matthew Scrope; “if in our
own way, that will do; but let me beg you, Mr. Justice
Whistler, not to plunge us farther in the mire than we
are at present.” -
“A capital simile,” muttered the London justice be-
tween his teeth, as he led the way to the justice-room,
which communicated by a long passage with the man-
sion of Sir Matthew Scrope.
The clerk was then called, the magistrates took their
stations in formal array, the table was diligently strewed
with papers, and an order was given to bring in the
prisoner.
“Ahem!” cried Sir Matthew Scrope, as Langford ap-
peared between two constables. “Ahem! ahem "said
his fellow-justices; and Sir Thomas Waller, who now,
like a tennis-ball, which, having been struck in one
way by the hand of a strong player, is met by his op-
ponent's racket, and is driven farther back in the op-
posite direction, was inclined to go farther than any of
his colleagues, according to the new impulse which he
had received, added, with a simpering smile, “Pray be
seated, sir; pray be seated. Ahem ! You rascal, why
don’t you give the gentleman a chair?” and he bent his
brows as frowningly on the constable as if he had com-
mitted petty larceny at least.
Langford was pale, and his features somewhat worn
and haggard, with all the anxiety, agitation, and dis-
tress of mind which he had gone through within the
last week; neither was his heart well at ease when he
regarded either his father's situation or his own at that

moment, and felt that his recovered parent might re-
main in sickness and in anguish, and even pass the
gates of death, without the consolation of his son's
presence; while he, perhaps, manacled and treated like
a common felon, was detained in the solitary wretched-
ness of a prison upon the charge of murdering his own
brother. Nevertheless, a faint smile came over his lip
at the somewhat burlesque exhibition of Sir Thomas
Waller, and it instantly flashed across his mind that
something must have occasioned a change in the wor-
thy justice's feelings towards him, both from the sudden
alteration and great embarrassment of his manner. He
threw himself into the chair, however, that was placed
for him, and, leaning his elbow on the table, gazed upon
the magistrates, thinking, “What next!”
“You stand before us, sir,” said Mr. Justice Whistler,
in a pompous tone, “accused of the murder of Edward
Lord Harold. Ahem ‘’” -
There, was something in the man's whole manner
that roused Langford's indignation and contempt at the
same time; and he replied, with his lip curling and his
nostril expanding, “I sit before you, sir, committed on
that charge; at least if I am to believe what you told
me not above three hours ago.”
“Circumstances may have occurred since, sir,” said
the justice, with a mysterious look, “to make us take a
more favourable view of the case, and we have conse-
quently determined to re-examine you.”
“Sir, I am tired of re-examinations,” replied Lang-
ford. “You informed me that I was committed. Under
such circumstances, I am not disposed to answer any
farther questions, or to be re-examined at all.”
Mr. Justice Whistler looked at his two companions,
and both the knights looked at Mr. Justice Whistler, for
Langford's renitency threatened to keep them exactly
in the disagreeable position in which they had placed
themselves; but, after a moment's pause, he added a
few words, which, like the sound of parley, gave hope
of entering into some capitulation. “Pray, sir,” said
the prisoner, “what are the circumstances which in-
duce you to take a more favourable view of the case?”
“Nay, young gentleman,” said Mr. Justice Whistler,
with a benign and yet dignified look, “you cannot ex-
pect us to give you such information. That would be
defeating the ends of justice; but if you think fit to

answer the interrogatories which shall be addressed to
you, and your replies coincide with the information
which we have received, the result may be very much
in your favour.”
Langford paused for a moment ere he replied. He
was naturally extremely anxious to free himself as soon
as possible, but yet he felt a degree of indignation at
the conduct that was pursued towards him which over-
came every other feeling; and at the same time he be-
gan to perceive that the worthy justices were very
doubtful as to their own proceedings, so that he was
not without some expectation of their setting him free
at once if he avoided any farther reference to that jour-
ney to the moor, which he could neither explain nor.
account for without inconvenience and danger to him-
self and others; he therefore once more refused to sub-
mit to any interrogation.
“All I shall say,” he continued, “is, that I am, as you
well know, perfectly innocent; that I never saw the
unfortunate young gentleman, of whose death I am ac-
cused, after I parted with him in the manor park at
Moorhurst; and that there is not the slightest evidence
to show that, though he drew his sword upon me, I
ever drew mine upon him. I shall reply to nothing
more.”
Mr. Justice Whistler whispered eagerly to Sir Mat-
thew Scrope. “There is nothing for it, I tell you,”
he said, “but to send him to prison, and make out the
best case against him you can. You see he will give
us no opportunity of letting him go. Your risk will be
much greater in the one case than in the other.”
Sir Matthew Scrope turned very pale, for the alter-
native was certainly somewhat disagreeable; and his
eye wandered with an anxious vacancy from the coun-
tenance of the London justice to that of the prisoner,
and then again stole round to the face of Sir Thomas
Waller, without finding any resource in the expression
of either of the three. Sir Thomas Waller, on his part,
being of a more irritable and less lamblike disposition
than his worthy colleague, was getting somewhat ex-
cited, or rather into a state of irritable despair, which in-
clined him to side with Mr. Justice Whistler, and take
the leap before him even at the risk of breaking his
neck.
At that moment, howev: while the justices were in

this state of anxiety and embarrassment, a constable
made his appearance at the doorway, closed the door
gently behind him, and, walking slowly up the room,
communicated something to Sir Matthew Scrope, which
was instantly transmitted to the other two magistrates
in the same low tone in which he had received it.
“Oh, send him away, send him away,” said Mr. Jus-
tice Whistler. “Bid him come another time.”
“He’s a most respectable man,” said Sir Thomas
Waller; “perhaps he might help us in this business.”
“Why, your worship,” said the constable, in a low
tone, “I understood him to say that it was something
about this very business he wanted to tell you.”
“Show him in, then, show him in 1" said the large
round voice of Mr. Justice Whistler; and in a few min-
utes was ushered into the presence of the three magis-
trates a small, neat dapper man, dressed in a plain suit
of black silk, who was greeted by the two country ma-
gistrates as Master Evelyn.
With a quick, short step he advanced to Sir Matthew
Scrope, took him by the button, led him into the recess
of a window at some distance behind the other magis-
trates, and spoke to him for a few moments with rapid
utterance, but in a low voice. Most men have seen the
sun come from behind a cloud; but the glorious visage
even of the great orb of day, when it bursts forth from
that vapoury veil, is scarcely more radiant than became
the countenance of Sir Matthew Scrope while listening
to the words of Mr. Evelyn the attorney.
“Hist! hist ! Sir Thomas !” he exclaimed; “Sir
Thomas ! Your worship, Master Whistler!” and, with
dignified grace, he beckoned them up to the place of
conference. Mr. Justice Whistler, as he listened, laid
his finger solemnly upon the side of his nose, and then,
making a sign to his colleagues to be silent, returned
to his seat, and said, in a full round voice, “Mr. Evelyn,
be so good as to introduce the witnesses.”
“What is coming now !” thought Langford, as he
heard this direction given, and he turned to look to-
wards the door, while the London justice, with an air
of perfect self-composure, took up some of the papers
from the table, and seemed to study them attentively,
as if perfectly indifferent to the next act of the drama.
Langford still kept his eyes upon the door, however,
not a little anxious to see who were to be the witnesses

for or against him; and certainly his surprise was not
slight when he saw Sir Walter Herbert enter the room,
with Alice, pale and evidently much agitated, leaning
on his arm; and a woman servant, whom he had often
seen at the Manor House, following close behind.
He started up with an impulse that he could not re-
sist, and sprang forward to meet her. Had he kept his
seat, Alice might have gone through the scene very
well; for, though agitated in a very great degree, she
had taken much pains to nerve her mind in order calm-
ly to perform the part assigned to her; but the sudden
start, the joyful smile, the radiant look of happiness
with which Langford sprang for v. to meet her, quite
overthrew her equanimity, carried her away altogether,
and she suffered herself to sink forward in the arms he
held out to her, bursting into a violent flood of tears.
Sir Matthew Scrope, who was naturally not without
a feeling heart, was affected at what he saw, and Mr.
Justice Whistler amused. “No private communica-
tions between the witness and the prisoner,” said the
latter, with a broad grin ; and though Langford turned
round towards him with a heavy frown gathering on his
high forehead, he went on in the same strain. “Pray
separate them, Mr. Evelyn. Pray separate them, Sir
Walter Herbert, else we shall have evident collusion,
and be obliged to refuse the evidence l’”
Langford removed the arms which he had at first
clasped warmly round the beautiful form of his promised
bride ; and Alice, while she wiped away the tears with
one hand, placed the other in that of her father, and ad-
vanced towards the table.
“Well, madam,” continued the justice, “what is it
that you have to say upon this subject? I understand
it is something of great importance.”
“I trust it may prove so,” replied Alice; “and, in-
deed, I should think it would prove of the greatest im-
portance. What I have to say is this, that in the course
of last night I myself distinctly saw Edward Lord Harold
alive.”
“And are you ready to swear to this, madam?” ask
ed the justice. *
“Quite ready,” replied Alice.
“Then be so good, madam,” he said, “as to detail all
the circumstances.”
Alice immediately complied; and with distinctness

and precision, which called a compliment from the lips
of Mr. Justice Whistler, she narrated every event of the
preceding night which related to the matter in question.
She told, glancing timidly at the cause of their journey
at that late hour, how the carriage which contained
herself and her father had been stopped, they them-
selves obliged to alight, their own horses turned loose,
and others put on; and she went on to say, that when
the party which dispossessed them took possession of
the carriage, she had distinctly seen Lord Harold, whom
she had known from her childhood, assisted to the car-
riage by two men, and placed therein, together with
other persons. She farther said that she had called
her maid to witness what was going on, and she had
consequently seen the whole, of which she would give
her own account. -
The maid was then called forward, and corroborated
in every respect her mistress's statement. She knew
Lord Harold perfectly well by sight, she said; had
known him from the time he was a boy, and could not
be mistaken. She had seen him distinctly by the bright
light which was then in the sky, and which she had
since heard proceeded from the burning of Danemore
Castle. She had also heard his voice, and recognised
it, as well as his person, so that there remained no
earthly doubt upon her mind that he was still alive.
“Well, then,” exclaimed Mr. Justice Whistler, “such
being the case, of course, where nobody has been killed,
nobody can be the murderer. We have therefore no-
thing farther to do but to discharge the warrant against
this gentleman and set him at liberty. We have heard
in romances and such trash of gentlemen being libera-
ted by fair ladies, but I must confess I never saw it be-
fore till this day. However, we must, as I said, dis-
charge the warrant; though, if I am rightly informed,”
he added, with what he intended to be a pleasant and
meaning smile to Langford, “though, if I am rightly in-
formed, almost as many aliases should have been put
into the description of this honourable gentleman as
into that of any person brought to the Old Bailey.”
Langford looked, grave, for his feelings were very
much mingled. He was rejoiced, undoubtedly, at his
liberation; he was rejoiced to hear that the man of
whose safety he had himself given up all hope was still
living ; he was rejoiced that Alice Herbert should have

been the means of restoring him to freedom; but still he
saw many a difficulty and many a pang before him;
and with a generous heart and mind, he grieved for
the sake of his younger brother as well as for himself,
that he had not known of Edward's safety before, when
he might have taken means to soften everything that
was now likely to be harsh and painful both to the earl
and to himself, as well as to him who had so long look-
ed forward with a feeling of perfect certainty to the en-
ioyment of high rank, commanding station, and one of
the most splendid fortunes in the country.
He could now do nothing; the earl had so loudly
proclaimed the secret of his birth, had acknowledged
him before so many persons, that no means of breaking
or softening the matter to him who had hitherto been
called Lord Harold now remained ; and, even with re-
gard to the earl himself, all that Langford could hope
for was to have the opportunity of communicating #.
facts to him in the first instance, and of concerting
some means with him for taking the sting out of his of.
fence.
Such were the feelings which were busily crossing
his bosom while the magistrate spoke, and for the
moment they produced a look of serious thought, almost
of sadness, which surprised even Alice Herbert. The
next moment, however, his countenance was all clear:
and, taking her hand in his, he thanked her a thousand
times, feeling, with true love's sweet deception, as if
his liberation were entirely owing to her exertions.
“Oh, dear Langford!” she said, “indeed you owe me
nothing. I wish it had been in my power to do any-
thing to free you sooner, not only from imprisonment,
but from a horrid accusation, which was even worse.
But this has been all accident; and, though it has made
me very happy, I have had no merit therein.”
Langford thanked her still, however, and thanked
her eagerly; and then turning to good Sir Walter Her-
bert, he shook him warmly by the hand, thanking him
too, and asking him if he had yet received the paper
which the Earl of Danemore had sent that very morn-
ing. He found, however, that such was not the case;
and that Sir Walter Herbert was then waiting with
Alice to tender bail for his appearance, Bolland and his
follower never yet having reached the county town to

which the good knight and his daughter had bent their
steps after having been left without their carriage.
The tale of their adventures instantly roused the pe-
culiar genius of Mr. Justice Whistler, who had that very
morning, on his way back with Langford, investigated
accurately the whole history of the attack upon Dane-
more Castle, and who now, furnished with a clew by
the account of Sir Walter Herbert, resolved to remain
in the county, though he vowed that his presence was
daily needed in London, and to pursue the robbers till
he had brought them to justice. On this sage deter-
mination he proceeded to act; and, as soon as Bolland
appeared—which he did in somewhat rueful plight about
the middle of the day, having remained tied to a tree
during the whole night—Mr. Justice Whistler sought
to engage him in the scheme, well knowing that never
ferret traced the windings of a warren with more supple
ingenuity than the sheriff's officer would trace the track
of a fugitive.
It was with difficulty, however, that Bolland was per-
suaded to undertake the task, for the warning voice of
Franklin Gray rang in his ears; and though he longed
to be revenged for the cold night he had passed upon
the moor, yet he had a great reverence for the robber's
threats, having remarked that they seldom went unex-
ecuted. He was at length, however, persuaded; and
as soon as Sir Walter and his daughter, accompanied
by Langford, now at liberty, had taken their way back,
with hearts greatly relieved, towards the scenes where
first they appeared before the reader's eyes, the Lon-
don magistrate and his new ally, with the two country
justices as slow hounds behind them, proceeded to hunt
out tidings of Franklin Gray and his party.
They were soon at fault, however; for though the
marks of wheels and horses' hoofs could be traced from
the spot where the carriage had been taken from Sir
Walter Herbert as far as the road continued sandy, the
nature of the soil soon changed; hard rock succeeded,
and all such marks were lost.
At the same time, it was found in vain to question
the cottagers and townspeople, for all declared that, if
such a party had passed at all, they had passed in the
night, when heavy sleep had closed each ear and shut
up every eye

CHAPTER X.
It is probable that very few persons in the world,
were the choice left to them, would prefer that any
mixture whatsoever of pain should checker the happi-
ness which they covet. But yet have we not all felt,
have we not all at some time owned, that the mingling
of a slight drop of acid in the sweet cup of enjoyment
gave it a zest which prevented it from palling on the
taSte. -
Seated beside Alice Herbert, in a vehicle which had
been hired at the county town to convey them back to
their own dwelling—a vehicle the external appearance
of which none of those it contained even saw—Lang-
ford gave way to joy, not unmixed, indeed, but only so
far touched with care and anxiety as to bring out the
brighter points in the more striking relief. As far as
he could, he cast from his mind every memory of evil:
he thought df that which was pleasant and gladdening
in his fate alone, and suffered the memory of past dis-
comforts and pangs, or the apprehension of difficulties
and dangers in the future, but to come across his mind
as vague shadows, like distant clouds upon the edge of
the horizon, which the wind might or might not bear
away, but which, at all events, did not serve to obscure
the sun that shone in the Zenith.
He had, indeed, infinite cause for satisfaction. He
had, indeed, a thousand motives for joy and even for
triumph. That which had been for many years the first,
the great object of his existence, was now accomplished,
and was accomplished, though not without pain, though
not without difficulty, though not without danger, still
without one action which he could look upon with pain
or with regret. He felt that, though he had been
tempted to do things which he would afterward have
repented, he had resisted the temptation, and had strug-
gled nobly as well against himself as against the injus-
vice of others."
Whatever might result from the circumstances in
which he was placed, he had succeeded in that great
object of clearing his mo: memory from a stain,

108 THE ROBBER.
The earl, in the presence of many witnesses, had more
than once acknowledged the marriage which for eight-
and-twenty years he had concealed and denied; and
Langford doubted not that the same good Providence
which had led him through such tortuous paths to suc-
cess so far, would accomplish the rest in good time,
nor leave the work begun unfinished. It was a blessing,
too, when he gazed on Alice Herbert, the beautiful and
the beloved ! to feel that the only stigma upon his name
which even the eye of prejudice could have seen was
removed, and that her father's views in regard to ille-
gitimate birth would not, in his case, mingle any degree
of pain with that approbation which in other respects
he had given so joyfully.
• He sat beside hor, then, giving way to the extreme of
happiness; and, strange to say, the love which in their
last meeting had been new and timid in the hearts of both,
had now, by the events of deep interest; by the dangers,
by the sorrows, by the anxieties which they had passed
through together; by all the various circumstances,
thoughts, and feelings in which the fate of each had been
associated with that of the other, had now been taught
to feel like old and tried affection; had lo uch of the
shyness of novelty; and Alice let the hand which he
had taken rest in his, while on their onward journey he
told as much of the strange tale of his past life as he
could do without embarrassing the story with the names
of others whose fate was yet uncertain, but might be
affected by the very share they had taken in all that
had passed regarding him.
He mentioned not the name of Franklin Gray, but he
took his own history far back, and told her and her
father that long ago, in the days of the civil wars,
many an Englishman, driven forth from his native land,
had sought refuge in France; that many of them, bro-
ken in fortunes and bankrupt even of hope, had become
mere adventurers, and had established for their coun-
trymen the reputation of bad and reckless men.
He went on to tell her that one of these exiles from
their native land had been kindly received and nobly
entertained by a family which had long been more or
less connected with England and English people. He
was of a daring and adventurous nature, and had sought
his fortune, before he came to France, in still more
distant countries; but there was something in his whole

demeanour, in the high education which he displayed,
in the noble feelings which often burst from him, even
in the very faults and untamed wildness of a nature
spoiled by indulgence, which confirmed the account he
£ of his own high rank, and the large possessions of
is dead father in the island of his birth.
That man, he said, was now the Earl of Danemore;
and then, in the graces of youth, he found no great diffi-
culty in winning the heart of Eugenie de Beaulieu,
whose feelings in his favour were first excited by com-
assion, to end in admiration and in love. They parted,
ut it was soon to meet again. Her brother had been
forced to join the army then warring in the Low Coun-
tries. Her uncle had been sent to England on one of
the brief embassies which from time to time marked
the broken intercourse between the great usurper Crom-
well and the legitimate monarch of France. The aunt
of Eugenie de Beaulieu, having accompanied her hus-
band, had sent over people in whom she could confide
to bring her niece, who had been left almost unprotected
in France during her brother's absence, to the British
capital; but the death of Cromwell, and the uncertain
policy of his weak successor, had thrown the whole
country into confusion ere she arrived. Eugenie was
followed by her lover, and never reached the dwelling
of her uncle in London. Ere she arrived at that city
she had consented to become a wife; and her husband,
having been discovered as an adherent of the house of
Stuart, was soon after obliged to fly and leave her. * *
What he meditated, what he purposed by such an act,
his son now touched upon but slightly; but he was
obliged to tell how, by threats as well as by entreaties,
the earl had forced her who had been his bride but a
few weeks to give into his hands all the proofs of their
private marriage, promising by everything he held sa-
cred never to destroy them. -
The next part of the story was a painful one, and was
also passed over lightly: how his mother returned to
France, and did not find her husband where she expect-
ed to meet him; how she was forced to communicate
her situation to her brother; how her brother doubted -
and feared, but at length believed her tale; how he cast ...
all thoughts aside but that of doing justice to his sister;
how he traeed out her husband, and eagerly, perhaps
fiercely, demanded that he should do her right. How,

in short, two high-tempers. went'on to words which
could not be forgiven; how they fought, and how both
had nearly died where they stood. So went the tale.
The husband, carried from the field, was not heard
of more for nearly two years, when he suddenly
reappeared in England, claimed and received his hon-
ours, titles, and estates, and wedded into a rich and
noble house. His first and deserted wife, forced by her
brother to countenance a report of her own death,
brought forth a son in Secret; and the rest of the tale,
as it was told to Alice Herbert, the reader must have
already gathered. There was a part of it, however,
which was not told then, and which will be noticed,
perhaps, hereafter; but it was a part which involved the
whole history of those steps which had been taken for
Several £ regain from the earl the proofs of his
first marriage; and it touched upon so much that was
painful, and so much which might be imprudent to
speak, that Langford was not sorry when he found that
the many questions of Alice and Sir Walter, their
many exclamations of pity for his mother's sorrows and
interest in her fate, the long explanations and minute
details which he had to give, and the various episodes
and collateral anecdotes which were required in such
a history told to such listeners, had occupied the time
till they had nearly reached the spot where he had left
his father, compelling him to leave his tale for the time
incomplete. -
Anxious in every respect to return to the side of his
sick parent, Langford gazed up at the windows of the
house where he lay as the carriage rolled heavily into
the court before the old parsonage. All was still, how-
ever; and a careless horseboy whistled in the yard
while he thrust the straw on one side. Langford ques-
tioned him regarding his father's health; but the lad
knew nothing on the subject but that “there had been
a rare coming and going, and seeking for the doctor,
who had gone forth to see Betty Hinton, who had been
scorched while seeking to pilfer something from the fire
at the castle.”
Sir Walter Herbert and the earl’s son, however, both
felt that the boy’s account gave a bad augury; and the
knight and his daughter remained in a vacant room be-
low, while Langford ascended the stairs. He found
some of the earl's attendants in the outer room, and

from them he learned a confirmation of his fears. His
lordship, they said, was much worse, and had become
so about an hour before. The doctor, they added, was
then with him, as well as Mistress Bertha and the rec-
tor; but they could no farther tell his condition.
Langford hurried on with a sweet hope that his pres-
ence might sooth and cheer. He opened the door cau-
tiously; but the face of the old peer was towards it,
and the too bright, fevered eye was fixed upon him in-
stantly. With much pain, however, Langford saw that
his appearance seemed to agitate rather than to calm;
the lip quivered, the brow knit, and, tossing round upon
his other side, he turned his face to the wall. His son,
however, divined at once what had happened to produce
this change, and shaped his course accordingly. Mo-
ving gently forward, he advanced to the bedside of his
hurt father, and sat down, while Bertha gave place, and
the rector bowed low to his patron’s son. .
“How fare you now, sir!” demanded the young gen-
tleman; “I hope better, for I bring you good news.”
The earl, however, occupied with his own thoughts,
did not seem to attend to his words. “No !”.he cried,
casting himself round again in bed, and grasping Lang-
ford's hands; “no, I will not disown thee, my gallant,
my noble boy! No, I will not recall my words, be the
consequences what they may ! Your voice sounds in
my ear like your poor mother's, when first I heard it
in youth and generous-hearted innocence; it sounds
soothing, and not reproachful; and I say it again, you
are my son! she was my wife! Let them do what
they will, let them say what they will, so it is, and shall
be denied no longer; and yet, poor Edward! Think of
poor Edward! He is living—you have heard—he is liv-
ing. The joy of those sudden tidings had wellnigh killed
me, but the pangs that came after have gone farther
still. Think of poor Edward "
“I have thought of him, my dear sir; I have thought
of him much and deeply,” replied Langford; “but, in-
deed, there is no cause for your present agitation—”
“No cause !” exclaimed the earl, with his old vehe-
mence breaking forth even then; “no cause, do you
say. Why, do I net, by the very act of acknowledging
fou, bastardize the boy that has lain in my bosom, that .
as dwelt with me through years which would other-
wise have been solitary? Do I not take the wrong

from your mother to put it upon his? Do I not deprive
him, by a word, of station, rank, a noble name ! Do I
not proclaim myself false, a breaker of all vows? Oh!
young man, young man, you know not how this proud
hard heart is wrung and torn at this moment ! Say not
a word, say not a word! I know that it is by my own
follies; my own crimes, if you will. I know what you
can say; I know all that you can say; that your mother,
as noble and as virtuous as his, bore her sorrows through
a long life, raised no loud murmur against him who had
injured her, and died forgiving him who had imbittered
her existence; that hers is the just right; that hers was
the first claim; that the real wife lived in sorrow and
under reproach, and died in misery and despair; that
the false wife lived in honour and in high esteem, and
died in the arms of her son and of him she thought her
husband; that it is time now, even now, to make the
atonement! I know it all, and the atonement shall be
made ; but neither tell me that there is no cause for
agitation, nor utter one reproach in the voice of her who
never reproached me.”
“Far from it, my lord,” replied Langford, as soon as
the earl would let him speak; “far from it! I seek not
in the slightest degree to utter a word that comes near
a reproach; and though I know you must be pained and
grieved by much that has occurred, there is still, I trust,
cause for nothing but joy in the tidings we have heard
of my poor brother's safety. In the first place, my lord,
the papers which are necessary to establish my claim
as heir to your estates and title in England have not yet
been found, and may never be so; nor do I at all seek
to deprive my brother of that to which he has through
life looked forward. Were they found to-morrow, as
long as he lived I should conceive myself bound by the
engagement which I and my uncle both entered into
formerly, never to make use of those papers in England,
but to employ them solely for the establishment of my
legitimacy in France. No one in this country but my-
self knows, or should ever obtain proof from me, of the
period of my mother's death; and, consequently, as that
event might have taken place before your marriage with
another, that second marriage will remain valid in Eng-
land to all intents and purposes. I say that such shal;
be the case even should the papers be found. Should
they not be found, your own solemn declaration, upon

oath, together with the testimony of Bertha here, a born
subject of France, will be sufficient fully to establish my
legitimacy in that country, and to restore to me my un-
cle's title and estates, which have passed away to others.
Such being the case, I say again, there is no cause for
anything but joy in the tidings of my brother's safety.
If you desire it should be so, he even need never know
that you were united to his mother while mine was still
living. I pledge myself, upon my honour, never to tell
him, and in no respect to seek to wrest from him the
estates or honours he would have derived from you.
Shall it be so 1"
The earl gazed at him for several moments with a
countenance over which the shades of many passions
came flitting like figures across a glass. He hesitated,
he doubted, he admired. But his was not a nature to
remain long in any state of uncertainty. Keen, eager,
fiery in all his determinations, he strode at once to his
object, and, when his resolution was once taken, he
could trample upon his own heart when it lay in the
way as well as upon the hearts of others.
“No !” he exclaimed at length, in answer to Lang-
ford's question, “no; it shall not be so! I will do justice
even at the last hour. I will do justice, let it cost me
what it may. No! noble and generous, kind-hearted
and true as you have shown yourself; worthy child of
her that I wronged; true descendant of a noble race,
upon whose fame and honour I brought the first impu-
tation, I will not take advantage of your too generous
kindness; I will not screen myself from the conse-
quences of what I have done, by withholding from him
who saved his father's life, at the very moment that
father was doing him the grossest injustice, the rank
that he will honour nobly, the wealth that he will rightly
employ. No ; though I break my own heart by what
I inflict upon his, Edward, when he returns, shall know .
all; shall know how well and nobly you have acted;
how ill I have acted towards both; and then if, while
you forgive and sooth, he in the bitterness of his heart
should curse the father that has wronged him, let him
do it; I say, let him do it.”
Langford was about to reply, but the surgeon inter-
posed, saying, “Indeed, sir, though it may be very
necessary that such important matters as those on
which you have been *:ng should be settled in

some manner, it is absolutely necessary to make all
discussion upon the subject as short as possible; for,
if prolonged, the consequences must necessarily be of
the worst and most serious nature.”
“Far be it from me to prolong them,” replied Lang
ford; “let the matter rest as it is, my dear father. Let
us take no steps whatsoever, nor discuss the matter in
any shape till your health is returned, and then—”
“Do not deceive yourself,” said the earl; “do not
deceive yourself, my son. From this bed I shall never
rise again! The day is past, the night is coming. The
fire is burnt out, and there lingers. but a spark behind.
The oil in the lamp is exhausted, and, though the flame
may flicker up yet once or twice, it soon must pass
away and be extinguished. Henry, I feel that I am
dying ! It is not these wounds that have killed me, but
the long intense struggles of a fiery and uncontrollable
spirit have at length beaten down the bars of the fleshly
prison that once strongly confined it, and it is now ready
to take wing and fly to other lands. We will discuss the
matter, as you say, no more; but my hours are num-
bered, and, ere I die, I must act. Where is that man
Kinsight, the lawyer? Why did he not return to me
last night? Let him be sent for instantly, for I must
take those measures, both to place your birth beyond
all doubt as far as yet lies in my power, and to provide
amply and nobly for the son I have wronged. But
alas! alas! have I not wronged you both you first,
and him last, but both deeply, terribly, equally. Where,
I wonder, is that lawyer? I wonder why he came not
last night?”
“I fear, my lord,” replied the surgeon, “that he will
not be able to attend you, for I find that he was very
severely handled by the people yesterday evening in an
attempt to execute a writ upon Sir Walter Herbert, so
that he has lain insensible from yesterday about five
o'clock till this morning, and is not likely, it would
seem, to recover.”
“Retribution l’” said the earl; “retribution | Though
it sometimes comes slowly, it is sure to come at last,
and, then comes altogether. This was my doing too,
though by his prompting. However, be it as it may,
retribution has fallen upon us both. But somebody told
me that, after all, Sir Walter was arrested last night,
and I sent a release that he might be set free.”

“I have found no one,” said Bertha, who had remained
standing behind, “I have found no one to whom I would
trust so important a thing. You told me,” she contin-
ued, turning to Langford, “to give it to nobody but one
on whom I could implicitly rely, and I have thought
over all the persons I know on earth, over all the per-
sons I have ever known, and cannot remember one who
deserves such a name.”
“You are bitter,” said Langford, “but not just, Bertha.
However, set your mind at ease, my dear father; Sir
Walter Herbert is at liberty and in this house, waiting
anxiously to hear tidings of your health. His daughter
is with him, too; and she thinks that, if you would per-
mit her, she could, by that care, and kindness, and ten-
derness which are parts of her nature, greatly sooth and
comfort you.”
The earl shook his head; and a smile, faint indeed, but
still the first that had crossed his countenance for a long
time, hung upon his lip during a single instant. “You
are a lover,” he said; “but nothing can sooth or com-
fort me more in life, Henry. Yet I would fain see Sir
Walter Herbert. I am in the course of atonement, and
I must atone to him, too, in words as well as deeds.”
“Indeed, my lord,” said the surgeon, “the fewer that
you see—” -
“Sir, I will have it so !” exclaimed the earl, turning
upon him with a frowning brow. “Let me not be tor-
mented by opposition even at my last hour!” and, with
a firm and imperious voice, he directed Bertha to invite
Sir Walter and his daughter to the chamber where he lay.
They came speedily, and no trace of any feeling but
that of kind and generous compassion was to be seen
upon the countenance of Sir Walter Herbert when he
entered the presence of the man who had inflicted so
much pain and anxiety upon him.
The earl gazed for a moment in his face as if to see
what expression it bore, in order to form his own de-
meanour by it, and then held out his hand to him frankly.
“Sir Walter,” he said, as the old knight advanced and
took it, “I have done you wrong; I have acted ungen-
erously towards you, as well as towards many others.
Do you forgive me?”
“From my heart,” replied Sir Walter Herbert; “but
iet us not think of anything that is painful, my good
lord I trust that you have not been seriously injured

in the course of this sad business, the details of which
I know, but imperfectly.”
The earl shook his head at the expression of such a
hope, but he made no reply thereunto, and merely de-
manded, turning to Bertha, “Where is the paper?”
When it was put into his hand, he continued, “I in-
tended this to have reached you early in the morning.
Sir Walter. Take it now. It is but an act of justice;
and anything that may be considered wanting by your
lawyer to put it into due form had better be mentioned
to me soon, for I am going a long journey, Sir Walter,
and would fain leave nothing incomplete that I can set
to rights. Mistress Alice,” he continued, turning to the
fair creature that stood timidly a step behind, in a scene
so painful and so unusual, “Mistress Alice, sweet lady,
come hither, and speak to an old man ere he dies.”
Alice approached quickly to his bedside, and, taking
her hand, he gazed up in her face, saying, “Lady, to you
I have acted doubly ill, for in my demeanour towards
you lately I not only forgot what was just and right, but
what was courteous also; and yet I am going to ask a
great and extraordinary favour of you. When you are
the wife of this my son—which God grant you may be,
and may be soon—try, if it be possible, by kindness and
affection during the whole of the rest of his life, to make
up to him for the want of a father's love and a father's
care during the adverse period of his youth.”
Alice blushed deeply, but she replied, “Indeed, my
lord, I will; and I also have a favour to ask of you. I
see that you are ill. I know that you must be suffer-
ing. My father, thank God, needs not my care or help.
Let me stay with you, I beseech you, and be to you as
a daughter until you are better, which I hope and trust
will be sooner than you expect.”
“Hope nothing, young lady,” replied the old noble-
man; “I do not deceive myself. Nevertheless, you
shall stay if you so will, because I know that it may be
a satisfaction to you hereafter, and to him, my son,
even now. Yet it is cruel to inflict upon you, so young,
so tender, and so well assorted to sights of hope, and
joy, and life, and expectation, scenes of sickness, and
suffering, and of death. Yet, if you will, it shall be so.”
Alice turned a little pale, but still she firmly pressed
her request; while her father and her promised husband
gazed upon her with looks of love, and tenderness, and

approbation. “Mistress Bertha,” she said, after again
repeating her wish to remain, “you will let me share
your cares, and, with a little instruction from you, I
doubt not to prove skilful in my new employment.”
“More skilful than I am, lady,” repliet. Bertha, “for
I was never made for soothing and for tenderness. I
seek it not myself when sickness or when pain seizes
on me, and I am not fitted to give it to others. Never-
theless,” she added, in a lower voice, “you may, per-
haps, find a moment to teach that dying man to prepare
for the world to which he is speeding. I have lived long
enough in this land, which I once thought given over to
perdition, to believe that salvation may be found by
even those who do not believe all that the Church of
Rome would have them. Seek a moment to speak to
him, young lady; seek: a moment to point out to him
that all the earthly compensation he can now make is
nothing when compared with the faults he has commit-
ted. Tell him he must find an atonement; that he must
seek for an intercessor; and show him that that inter-
cessor cannot be gained but by full faith and trust in
Him.”
“I will,” replied Alice. “Indeed I will lose no op-
portunity;” and she kept her word. At the reiterated
request of the surgeon, the chamber was soon after
cleared, while a lawyer was sent for from the county
town to supply the place of the earl’s own attorney.
No person was left in it but one; and the task of sitting
by the sick man's side was fulfilled by Alice at her own
choice.
Sir Walter went on to the Manor House, promising
to return ere night; and Langford sat in a chamber be-
low, consulting with the rector and others concerning
the best means of tracing out his lost brother. But, in
the mean while, Alice, watching by the earl while he
strove ineffectually to gain even a brief interval of sleep,
pondered in her own mind how she might accomplish
the great object she had promised to attempt; how she
might even touch upon a subject from which, but a few
moments before, when mentioned by the rector, she
had seen the sick man start away with impetuous vehe-
mence, apparently judging that all appeal to Heaven's
mercy was too late, and determined not only to brave
fearlessly once more death which he had so often tempt-
ed, but to encounter unshrinkingly the “something after

death” which he believed his own acts to have loaded
with all the wrath of Omnipotence.
After tossing for a long time, however, with great
restlessness and apparent pain, sleep fell for a few min-
utes upon the earl's eyes; and, when it was over, though
it had lasted so short a time, he turned to Alice with a
smile, saying, “Oh how blessed a thing is sleep! Could
heaven itself be sweeter than slumber after restlessness
and agony ?”
“Oh yes,” replied Alice, “I should think so; for
here, rest requires labour, or fatigue, or pain to make it
sweet; there the enjoyment must be pure and self-exist-
ing, requiring no contrast. However, we know little
of such subjects. God grant that we may all know
such a state hereafter.”
The earl gazed thoughtfully in her face for a few
minutes, and then said, “Alice, do you think that those
who meet in the same place hereafter will each know
the other ?”
“Oh, doubt it not!” cried Alice, eagerly; “doubt it
not ! It were sin to doubt it. Heaven could not be
heaven without those we love.”
“Then, Alice,” cried the earl, with his brow darken-
ing and his eye straining upon her, “then, Alice, what
would it be to meet—with all one's crimes laid bare—a
long, long train of those we have injured or oppressed;
the slighted, the broken-hearted, the wronged, the in-
sulted, the slain! Could hell itself be worse than that?”
“But,” said Alice, eagerly, “but to those whom God
has pardoned, who shall impute wrong?”
The earl started up, and, leaning on his elbow, grasped
her hand. “Is there, Alice,” he cried, “is there pardon
for such as me!”
“There is pardon,” she replied, “for every sinner
that repents and puts his trust in Him who alone can
save. Such were his own words; and oh, let me be-
seech you,” she cried, and she cast herself upon her
knees beside his bed, “let me entreat you to hear them.
I am young, unlearned, inexperienced, but yet his words
need no learning to expound; his doctrine is clear'; his
£ are addressed to the spirits of every one. Oh,
ear them, my lord; hear them, for my sake, for Hen-
ry’s sake, hear them !” *
“I will,” answered the earl, sinking back upon the
pillows. “From your lips, Alice, I will, but not fram

his who gives them forth by rote. Speak, Alice; speak,
my child, and I will listen. There is one thing that I
now know, and to know that much, I feel, is something
already done. It is, that never man yet lived who had
greater need of intercession than myself. Speak to
me, then; read to me, then; and, though I promise
nothing farther, thqugh I say not that I will have faith,
though I say not that I will hope, yet I will listen to
every word.”
He did listen to her when he would have listened to
no one else, while she, with a beating heart and timid
earnestness, went on in her new task. How she ful-
filled it we need not dwell upon. What was the effect
cannot be told, for the earl made neither comment nor
reply; but when the door opened, and they announced
that the Lawyer Evelyn had arrived, he pressed Alice's
hand affectionately in his, and said, “I thank you, Al-
ice; from my heart and soul, I thank you.”
CHAPTER XI.
“Godd news, Master Justice! good news!” said John
Bolland, entering the room of the small inn where Mr.
Justice Whistler sat sipping a bowl of fragrant punch
with his two brother magistrates, about two days after
we last left him; “I have found out our man, and no-
thing is wanting but good courage and plenty of people
to take him and the greater part of his gang.”
“Sit down, Master Bolland, sit down, and take a la-
dleful,” replied Justice Whistler. “By your leave, Sir
Matthew, by your leave. Now, Master Bolland, now
tell us all the facts. To speak truth, I am in no con-
dition exactly to move far to-night, though I have cour-
age enough to take the great prince of thieves himself,
were it needful; but there is a certain feeling about my
knees which speaks a too great pliancy. This punch is
potent, Sir Matthew, very potent; but the upper story
is quite clear. So pray, Master Bolland, sip and recite.”
“Why, I have but little to say, worshipful,” said Bol-
land, who saw that the punch evidently had produced a
not unfrequent effect upon all three. “The only mat-

ter is, I have found out where this worthy Captain Gray
and his band have housed themselves; that is all.”
“And where may that be?” demanded Mr. Whistler.
“Pray where may that be, my dear Bolland 1”
“Why over the hills, beyond Badeley,” replied the of.
ficer; “but the further particulars I will keep till to-
morrow, as you cannot set out to-night; though, to say
the truth, every moment lost is likely to lose us our
man. He'll not stay there long, depend on it. They'll
be just like a covey of partridges at sunset, flitting
about from place to place before any one can come
near them.”
“But tell me all the particulars,” cried Justice Whis-
tler; “for, if need be, I will go this minute.”
“And so will I,” shouted Sir Matthew Scrope, who
in his cups grew mighty valiant. “And so will I, I
Swear !”
Sir Thomas Waller had proceeded a step beyond the
other two, and he could only stare. But even the pro-
posal of Sir Matthew was more than suited to the pur-
poses of John Bolland and his friend Mr. Justice Whis-
tler, who had agreed long before to share the profits of
the matter, which were likely to be considerable, be-
tween them. Each hoped, also, to gain a certain share
of honour and credit by the joint management of the af.
fair, which honour and credit were somewhat necessary
to both to lacker over certain flaws in their reputation
which were becoming rather too apparent.
It may seem a strange paradox, perhaps, to say that
Mr. Justice Whistler was as sober when he was tipsy
as when he was not ; but such was the case with all the
upper man; the drunkenness began at the knees with
him, and went downward, leaving the brain quite as clear
and shrewd as usual, with the only difference that the
manner was a little more jocular, the pomposity some-
what higher flavoured. On the present occasion, one
glance from the eye of Bolland towards Sir Matthew
Scrope reminded the London justice of their arrange-
ments, and he instantly changed his tone.
“No, no, Sir Matthew; we cannot go to-night,” he
said. “We will hear what Bolland has to say; we will
ponder on it on our pillows, and act to-morrow. Let
me help you, Sir Matthew. Generous punch never yet
did any man harm but a flincher. Sir Thomas, your
glass is empty. Master Bolland, join us. You see I do

not spare myself;” and he filled himself out a ladleful,
nodding to Sir Matthew Scrope, and drinking to the
health of his fair niece.
The additional burden thus poured upon the menta,
faculties of Sir Thomas Waller was quite sufficient to
send him quietly under the table; and Sir Matthew
Scrope, who likewise did justice to his glass, was re-
duced to that state at which eloquence, however unruly,
finds utterance difficult. Mr. Justice Whistler, perceiv-
ing in a few minutes the effect which the last cup had
produced, nodded to Bolland, and said, in a half whisper,
“Now for his nightcap ! Perhaps, Sir Matthew,” he
added, looking at the knight with a compassionating air,
“perhaps we had better not drink any more, though the
bowl is not yet empty. I am not at all drunk myself,
though I fear for your head to-morrow, Sir Matthew.
I thought you had been stronger men in these parts.
Why, with the help of Master Bolland, we have not fin-
ished the—”
“Sir, sir,” hiccoughed Sir Matthew Scrope, “I am no
more drunk than you are. I can take another glass
very well. Ay, two. We will never leave the bowl
unfinished.” -
Mr. Justice Whistler might perhaps, upon another oc-
casion, have found some degree of pleasure in prolong-
ing the yearnings of Sir Matthew Scrope for the liquor
of his heart, for all the minor sorts of tormenting were
generally sweet pastime to him; but, at present, he was
too deeply interested to pursue anything but the straight-
forward course; and when he saw that opposition had
sufficiently roused the drunken energies of his fellow-
magistrate, he suffered him to drink his punch in peace,
and fall back into his chair in the soft embraces of the
son of Lethe. -
No sooner was this accomplished than he looked upon
Bolland with a triumphant smile. He had himself, in-
deed, in no degree flinched from the potations he had
inflicted upon his two fellow-magistrates, but he was
very well aware of his own calibre, foresaw the result,
and knew the remedy. A slight additional weakness
of the knees was all that he had to anticipate; and
though he felt morally certain that, if he rose from the
table and attempted to make his exit by the door, it
would cost him five or six efforts before he could shoot
the arch, he knew at the same time that there were re-
WoL. II.-L

storative means to give back vigour to the sinews of his
lower man, and to enable his whole body to recover
that just equilibrium of which the potent punch had de-
prived it.
“Bolland,” he said, “Bolland, I’m in no condition
for riding just yet, but half an hour will set the whole
matter to rights. Have these two clods carried home,
and make pretty Sally, the blackeyed barmaid, bring
me a large basin and a ewer of water. Then quietly
steal into the kitchen, and tell the cook to do me a good
rump steak, and bring it in piping hot, with some sliced
onions. I dar'n't move from the table myself; for, un-
less I were cautious, cautious-cautious, Master Bol-
land, I should be at my full length on the floor in a min-
ute.”
Bolland did as he was bid; and as in those days there
were attached, as indispensable appendages to the inn
of every county town—especially if a club of magistrates
held its meetings thereat—certain sturdy fellows both
ready and willing to carry away the bodies of such as
fell in their contest with good liquor, three or four per-
sonages were soon found to bear off Sir Matthew Scrope
and Sir Thomas Waller to their respective homes.
Betty also soon appeared with the basin and ewer, as
the magistrate had directed; and Mr. Justice Whistler,
taking off his wig, caused a deluge"of the pure cold ele-
ment to be poured over his naked head, which bent
humbly before the hand of the practised barmaid.
When his face was well dried and the wig replaced,
he looked up in the face of Bolland, who had just re-
turned from his errand, with a smile of satisfaction, say-
ing, “I think I could do it now, Bolland. I think I could
do it now ! But I won't try till I have put the beefsteak
upon the top of the punch. In the mean time, give me
the whole particulars of this grand discovery you have
made. Where is this man to be found, and how have
you found him out? for we must be sure of what we
are about before we stir an inch.”
“Oh, for that matter, I am quite sure,” answered Bol-
land; “for I had it this very morning from a sheepdrover
whom I met just under the hills on this side, and who
gave me a long account of this strange gentleman com-
ing with half a dozen or more men, and taking the
sheepfarm that he described, without inquiring into any-
thing, as another man would have done. I asked him

The ROBBER. 123
if he had seen this strange gentleman. He said, ‘Oh
dear, yes; twice, walking about the hills in a melan-
choly kind of way, with his arms crossed upon his chest.
And then the fellow went on, and painted him like a
picture. I got the whole account of the place exactly
too, so that, when we get to the little town of Badeley,
I can lead you at once to the spot.”
“How far is it, Bolland?” demanded Mr. Justice
Whistler. -
“Some fifty-five miles, I hear,” replied the officer;
and thereupon the justice shook his head, exclaiming,
*Too far for one night's ride. Too far, too far. It
would make my old bones ache.” *
“I did not know your worship had any bones,” was
the quaint reply. “However, it is too far for me either,
for I have ridden nearly forty miles myself this morning,
and I am neither a post nor a postboy.”
While they were yet discussing the matter, a savoury
odour was smelt even through the double doors of the
clubroom, and Mr. Justice Whistler interrupted Bolland's
eloquence by exclaiming, “Ha! Here comes the rump
steak. It will set all things to rights presently; and, in
the mean while, you go and get two strong horses ready.
Find out what constables you can rely upon for a long
journey, and have everything prepared for our depar-
ture.” -
To the few questions which Bolland now asked, he gave
the clearest and most precise answers; and when the
worthy officer returned after fulfilling his mission, he
found the dish which had contained the beefsteaks void
of its contents, and Mr. Justice Whistler walking up
and down the room as steadily as ever.
“I have only got two constables,” he said, “who were
willing to go; all the rest were either drunk, or in bed,
or did not like the job, and would have run away and
left us at the bounds of the county.”
“Two are quite enough,” replied Mr. Justice Whis-
tler. “We can get plenty more at the nearest town.
These people here are all in a fit of fright at the strange
doings that have been taking place near them. Better
have some folks that are ignorant of the whole business.
Now I'm your man, Master Bolland. Are the horses
ready?”
Bolland answered in the affirmative; but, before he
followed the justice into the courtyard of the inn, he

124 THE ROBBER.
swallowed what remained of the bowl of punch, think-
ing that such encouragement was well adapted to a long
cold ride and a dangerous enterprise.
Mr. Justice Whistler now consulted gravely with Bol-
land in regard to the road; and, taking one of the con-
stables for their guide, they determined to proceed
about thirty miles that night, and accomplish the rest
upon the following day. They were, however, deceived
in regard to the distance. At the end of thirty miles
they found no town nor place of repose of any kind, and
they were consequently obliged to ride on till they got
on the first soft slopes of those wild hills which we have
elsewhere described.
Mr. Justice Whistler began to grumble seriously at
the length of way; Bolland declared that he was near-
ly knocked up; and one of the constables avowed that
he saw the gray streaks of the morning resting on the
tops of the hills, which would serve at least to show
them their way; for they were at this time immured in
the darkness of high hedges and narrow wooded lanes.
At that moment, however, a loud voice before them
called “Stop!” and Bolland, at once recognising the
voice of Franklin Gray, turned his horse's head and
galloped off as hard as he could go.
The rest would most likely have followed his exam-
ple had not the same voice vociferated, “Stop them
there, Harvey! Do not let them go!” and four or five
men, leaping their horses over the hèdge, cut off the re-
treat of Mr. Justice Whistler and the constables, while
one of the number fired a pistol down the lane after the
retreating figure of Bolland, which was followed by a
sharp sudden cry. But the horse's steps were still heard
galloping onward.
The flash of the pistol had afforded sufficient light,
however, to show Mr. Justice Whistler that resistance
was vain, though, to say sooth, he was a courageous
and determined man, and would have made it gallantly
if there had been even a hope of success. Such not be-
ing the case, however, he determined rapidly what to
do, but determined, unfortunately for himself, upon wrong
grounds. -
Remembering nothing but the awe with which his
name and presence inspired the petty plunderers of the
metropolis, he resolved to announce himself and all his
terrors in good set form, and to endeavour to frighten

THE ROBBER. 125
those who stopped him from their purpose. In the mean
while, however, the leader of the party threw back the
shade of a dark lantern, and poured the light thereof
full upon the justice and his followers, and he demand-
ed, “What are you doing here at this hour? What is
your name and errand?”
“Let me pass in the king's name, I command you,”
said the justice. “My name is Whistler, and I am one
of his majesty's justices of the peace for—”
“Oh, you are Mr. Justice Whistler, are you?” replied
the other; “worthy Mr. Justice, who are those two
men behind you? They seern not of your own con-
dition ?”
“We are only two poor constables from the town of
-,” replied the men, choosing to speak for themselves,
and in a humbler tone than that which the justice had
thought fit to use. “We are two hard-working men,
with small families, and are forced to do our duty.”
“These are not any of those we sought,” said Frank-
lin Gray to one of his followers. “Let these two poor
fellows go; but strip me this justice here to his skin.
Take every scus he has in his pocket, and then tie him
to a tree, and give him a hundred lashes with the stir-
rup-leather as hard as you can lay it on. I will not
take his life, though I should like to give him only one
lash for every false and villanous act he has committed;
for every innocent man he has sent to prison, to the
stocks, the pillory, or the parish beadle. One lash for
each, however, would cut him to pieces; so give him a
hundred, and let him go.”
The commands thus issued were punctually obeyed;
and while the justice shouted loudly under the infliction,
which was administered in the neighbouring field, Frank-
lin Gray went on addressing the man Harvey, some-
times commenting upon what was going on near, some-
times speaking of other subjects.
“They know we are on the look-out,” he said, “and
they will not stir so long as that is the case. How the
beast roars! Yet you say they must be in this neigh-
bourhood, for you traced their footsteps clearly. Those
fellows love flaying a justice to their heart. I can hear
the lashes they give him even here. But we had better
ride home now, and change our quarters soon. There,
there, that will do. There, my men, stop. You will
kill him if you don't min' Put his vest upon his fat

back, turn his face to the horse's tail, and send him can.
tering down the lane.”
Every tittle of Franklin Gray's commands were exe-
cuted to the letter; and Mr. Justice Whistler, still
writhing with the pain of the stripes he had received,
was partly clothed once more, and set upon his beast
again. His face, however, was turned in the contrary
direction to that which it usually assumed in relation
to the animal that bore him; and his feet being thrust
through the stirrups, a few smart blows were added to
send the charger off. Happily for the preservation of the
Justice's equilibrium, the horse was weary, and, even in
its most frisky moods, was a quiet, good sort of beast, so
that, after having jolted him in a hard trot for about
three hundred yards, it began to slacken its pace, grad-
ually dropped into a walk, and finally stopped to crop a
scanty breakfast from the herbage by the side of the
road.
Mr. Justice Whistler did not neglect such an oppor-
tunity, and, carefully descending, for in his bruised con-
dition every step was painful, he remounted according
to the usual mode, and, with a somewhat splenetic jerk
of the bridle, made his beast abandon its poor meal and
proceed on the road before it. That road, indeed, was
as unpromising to a man in his condition as any road
could be ; for his first necessity was now repose and
food, and as it was the very way by which he had come,
no one could be more certain than himself that there
was no house, village, or anything in its course for at
least ten miles. When he had gone about one, how-
ever, the aperture of a small country road was seen
upon the left, leading away over a low hill; and Mr.
Justice Whistler paused, and gazed, and pondered.
The darkness of the night had now fled, and the dull
streaks over the eastern hills had changed into gold and
crimson, and the clear, cool, fresh light of morning was
spreading over the whole prospect. The hills rose up
and shone in the coming beams; but a faint gray mist
lay over the lower grounds, marking out each wooded
slope, each wave in the fields, and each hedgerow in
long-defined lines across the view. The hill over which
the country road that now attracted the errant justice's
attention ran was, as he sagely judged, fully high
enough to conceal a farm, a village, a town, nay, a city
itself, should need be, on the other side; and along the

ThE ROBBER. 127
sandy road itself were to be traced various marks of
cart-wheels of no very remote date, and the prints of
horses’ hoofs more recent still.
Such a sight was wonderfully cheering to the justice,
who instantly turned his horse's head up the lane, and
pursued it perseveringly, though the high and manifold
trees in which it imbowered itself soon cut off all far-
ther prospect. A quarter of an hour's riding had not
yet brought him to anything like a house; but the joyful
sound of some one whistling broken snatches of a fa-
vourite village song set his heart at rest. The crack of a
whip, too, and the rattle and clatter of harness were soon
heard; when lo! the road suddenly turned to the left
round a steep bank, and a little village green, with its
pond affording much matutinal enjoyment to a party of
ducks, and its clump of tall elms, ready to give shade
when the sun rose high, presented itself to the eyes of
Mr. Justice Whistler as one of the pleasantest sights
he had ever seen.
To the right was a small farmhouse, from which proh-
ably proceeded the sounds of early labour which had
given the scourged magistrate encouragement on his
way; but exactly before him, on the other side of the
green, appeared the gray village church, with its yews
and its little enclosure, where rested the dead of many
a gone year; and, what was more to the purpose of the
justice, a neat and rather large white house, in a pretty
garden enclosed by low walls, which were checkered
with flints, and guarded by broken bottles from the pre-
datory feet of apple-loving boys.
The justice at first thought it was too good a house
for the parsonage; but, seeing no other abode of the
kind near the church, and looking at the air of comfort
and wealth about the village itself, he judged that it
must indeed be the dwelling of some rector well to do,
and therefore straightway he rode up to the gate to
"' his piteous case known. Those were hospitable
ays, and such circumstances as his, he well knew,
would find instant compassion and relief; but, as the
occasion was urgent, it was no slight satisfaction to him
to see the gates in the stableyard already open, horses
in the court bearing signs of having come from far, and
Sne regular domestic, with one personage, half groom
'' ploughboy, busily engaged in the duties of the
stable.

128 THE ROBBER.
“Why, here's another, Bill!” cried the rustic, as the
justice approached. “I think it rains strays just now.”
To the inquiries of Mr. Justice Whistler, the servant
replied that the house was the rectory of the Reverend
Mr. Sandon; that the rector was up, and talking in the
parlour with two gentlemen just arrived. A second
glance at the horses confirmed Mr. Justice Whistler in
the opinion which he had at first entertained, that they
had been his companions on the road during the greater
part of the night; and, on being ushered into the pres-
ence of the rector, he found him listening to the two
constables' tale of wo. - *.
The rector was a quick, sharp-nosed, reddish-faced
gentleman, extremely well to do in the world, yet ac-
tive, vigilant, shrewd, inquiring, the good things of life
having had no effect in producing sloth or indulgence.
He was a worthy man in the main, more charitable both
in thought and deed than he suffered himself to appear
and not by many degrees so avaricious as some of his
refractory parishioners wished to prove. He was up
early, to bed late; took great care of his farm and of
his flock; spared no one's vices or follies in the pulpit,
and required that his dues should be paid, if not rig-
orously, at least exactly, dispensing that money for the
benefit of one deserving part of his flock which he de-
rived from another.
On seeing the apparition of Mr. Justice Whistler clad
simply in his vest, and that not very well buttoned over
his protuberant stomach, the rector stared a single *
instant in silence; but the next moment, though he could * >
not repress a slight smile which came upon his lip at ** -
such a strange apparition, he resumed his courtesy, and, *
advancing towards the stranger, said, “I presume I have
the honour of seeing Justice Whistler; at least so the £
account of these good men leads me to imagine; and -
most happy am I to see him alive and well, for, knowing <>
the desperate character of the men into whose #
he had fallen, I was apprehensive of the result.” ".
“Alive, sir, alive,” said the magistrate, :
“but not well; by no means well: half flayed, scarified,
basted with stirrup-leathers till there is not an inch of
the skin on my back without a wound, nor a bone in my
body that does not ache. I have come, sir, to claim
your hospitality; to seek a few hours repose; to obtain
some refreshment, and to get some soft appliances to

my back; after which, God willing, I will raise the hue
and cry through the country, and tuck that fellow up as
high as Haman, or my name's not Whistler.”
“You shall have all that my poor house affords to
make you comfortable,” replied the rector; “and, after
you are refreshed, perhaps I may be able and ready,
more than you expect, to aid in your very laudable de-
sign of ridding the country of the band of ruffians
which has lately taken up its quarters upon the verge
of these two counties.”
“I am pleased to hear it, I am pleased to hear it,”
exclaimed Mr. Justice Whistler; “but, just now, my
back aches so portentously, I am so wearied and so
hungry, that I can think of little but a flagon of mulled
ale and a toast, a soft bed, and four or five handbreadths
of old linen to my back.”
“All that you shall have, sir,” replied the rector; and,
though there was just that degree of pain in his coun-
tenance and the whole movements of the justice which
excites one almost as much to merriment as to com-
passion, the worthy clergyman kept his countenance
very well, and with kindness and alacrity ordered.
everything that was necessary for making the suffering
man more comfortable. The mulled ale and the toast
were brought, and a small cup of metheglin was super-
added to give the whole consistency, as the magistrate
observed. After that the broad magisterial back was
dressed by a staid but not unskilful housekeeper; and,
tucked up in a comfortable bed, Mr. Justice Whistler
soon forgot in the arms of slumber the woes and the
adventures of the preceding night.
CHAPTER XII.
WHILE Mr. Justice Whistler and his colleagues had
ween proceeding in their examinations, and the events
we have just narrated had been taking place in a distant
part of the country, the days and nights in the little vil-
lage of Danemore had been spent in the slow and wear-
ing anxieties of watching the progress of sickness to-
wards death. Alice Herbert remained almost constantly
with the earl at his own earnest wish, and Sir Walter -

in all those various occupations of which the circum
stances in which they both stood furnished an abun
dance to fill up the time. -
It will be needless for us, however, to dwell upon
those occupations; for the examination into the ruined
part of Danemore Castle, the burial of the remains of
those who had perished on the night of the fire, the pre-
cautions taken by the law to ascertain the causes of the
death of each, and the foolish verdict, given by ignorant
jurymen as the result of their investigations, would af-
ford but little pleasure or instruction either. There are
other scenes before us; scenes equally painful and
striking, if the pen could but do justice to the finer and
more minute as it can to the deeper and more striking
traits of human character. -
The Earl of Danemore lay upon his bed of sickness,
and hour by hour showed as it went by that it would be
the bed of death also. It was not, indeed, that his
wounds were mortal, for no vital part in all his frame
had been touched; but he received those wounds, not
only as an old man in whom the loss even of a portion
of that strange red current that flows within our veins,
dispensing life and vigour, is not easily restored; he re-
ceived them also as one on whom strong and ungoverna-
ble passions had already wrought most powerfully, and
on whom also the same intensity of feeling was still des-
timed to work, though excited by better causes and a
better purpose. Weakened by great loss of blood, ex-
hausted by fatigue and excitement, but little was want-
ing to bring fever in the train of corporeal injury; and
the energetic eagerness with which he applied his mind
to everything connected with Henry Langford only
served to increase his irritability rather than to lead his
mind to calmer and more tranquillizing subjects. He
felt that his days on earth were numbered; and that
feeling begat in him an anxiety and a thirst to make up
for the evils he had inflicted, which tended to shorten
those few hours that remained to him.
. . The difficult and painful situation in which he was
placed also; the necessity of sacrificing one child to
another; the struggle to do justice to one for whom he
felt deep gratitude and esteem, when opposed by the
glaims of old affection and long-nourished tenderness

the knowledge that disgrace would fall upon his name,
and, like the yellow lichen on a tombstone, would live
and flourish, and render indistinct every record of his
life, when all below had mouldered away into dust; all
joined together to make him feel most poignantly and
bitterly that the last dark hour of life, when the bright
sun that has lighted us through the morning of our youth
and the midday of our manhood, and even shone warm-
ly on the evening of our decline, has gone down behind
the horizon, leaving but a few faint rays in the sky be-
hind, is not the time to seek our way back into the right
path which we have abandoned in the splendid noon of
our existence; and that, even if we do regain it at last,
it must be by plunging into the thorns and briers of
grief, regret, and remorse, without hesitation, though
with difficulty and agony itself.
It was not that even in those last hours of his life the
Earl of Danemore looked upon death with any feeling
of terror. Such sensations were not within the grasp
of his nature; he knew not what fear meant. He might
see and know that there was danger in this thing or in
that; he might fix his eyes even upon death itself, and the
retributive future after death; but still, while gazing on
the frowning brow of fate, and comprehending all which
that dark inevitable countenance menaced, he strode on
undaunted, and said, even to Omnipotence, “Strike!”
No! it was not that anything like fear affected him;
but it was that, weakened in body and wearied in mind
with a long struggle against many internal adversaries,
he listened to the voice of conscience and of equity,
making itself heard through the medium of a judgment
naturally strong and acute; making itself heard not the
less distinctly in the silence of exhausted passions, be-
cause in former times the small still voice had been
drowned amid their contending fury.
He felt what it was right to do, and he strove now to
do it, however difficult, however painful his own acts
might have rendered the task, however fatal to his cor-
poreal frame might be the efforts that he made and the
anxieties he suffered. For the greater part of one whole
night he remained eagerly dictating his will to the Law-
yer Evelyn; providing for his younger son, but endeav-
ouring to strengthen in every way the claim of the elder
to his title and estates. He made a solemn declaration
of his marriage too; ": the day, the spot, the cler-

gyman who had performed it, with serupulous accuracy;
pointed to the woman Bertha as the only surviving wit-
ness, and related how the leaf on which the marriage
had been inscribed had been cut from the register, and
how he had forced his young and unhappy wife to give
up to him the certificates she had received of their union.
He spared himself, in short, in nothing; and again and
again he asked eagerly if that declaration and the wo-
man Bertha's testimony would not be sufficient.
The lawyer shook his head doubtingly. The mar-
riage, he said, had been denied for so many years; the
woman, too, was an alien and a Roman Catholic, against
whom prejudices then ran high. The question involved
an ancient peerage and immense property; and, in short,
there was every reason to doubt whether the young gen-
tleman's title could be sustained unless the papers were :
recovered. If the register itself were not in existence,
and the marriage had never been denied, the case might
easily have been made good; but, with no trace of such
an act in the existing register, and no absolute publica-
tion of the marriage, he had many doubts.
“But there is a trace l’” exclaimed the earl, vehement-
ly; “there is a trace; there is the leaf cut out. Send
for the register! Let it be brought here immediately!”
“We can do that to-morrow, my lord,” replied the
lawyer.
But the earl would not be satisfied till a servant was
despatched for the record on which so much depended.
It was brought to him by the clerk of the parish of Up-
pington during the gray daylight of the next morning,
for the very vehemence of his nature had taught every
one through the country round to yield instant, and now
habitual deference to his wishes. On examining the
book, however, he found nothing but disappointment.
When by large bribes he had induced the low-minded
but cunning priest who then held the living to cut out
the leaf, he had enjoined him strictly to leave no trace
whatever of the transaction; and so nicely had the re-
moval been accomplished, that no eye could detect the
place where the vacancy existed.
Again his own acts fell upon his own head; and the
earl felt as if it were ordained by retributive justice that
he should go down to the grave leaving the fate of both
his children still entirely in doubt. The idea took pos-
session of him, and it weighed him down. Often he

asked if any news had been heard of his son. Edward;
and when the reply was made that none had been re-
ceived, he exclaimed, “Of course, of course! Nothing
will be known of him till I am dead.”
As the third and fourth days went by, his mind began
to wander, and that most painful of all states to see,
delirium, came rapidly upon him. He raved of his first
wife, his Eugenie, the only one whom he had ever loved,
and yet the one whom he had most deeply wronged.
He called upon her to return to him, to bring her boy
to his father's arms; and then again he went over some
bitter quarrels, where it was evident that her firm
sweetness had but served to aggravate his fiery wrath.
It was a scene most painful to behold, and yet Alice
Herbert, tending him as if she had been his own child,
beheld it all, and with sweet and thoughtful tenderness
did much to soften and tranquillize the mind of him who
suffered, as well as the feelings of him who stood by
with a wrung heart, beholding a father's agony and a
father's remorse.
To the eyes of Langford, never did Alice Herbert, in
all the bright flush of health and happiness, as he had
at first beheld her, look so lovely; never did she seem
to his heart—even when she acknowledged the love
that made him happy-so dear as now ; while, some-
what pale with cares and anxieties lately suffered and
fatigues daily undergone, she stood, by the pale light of
the shaded lamp, with calm sorrow and apprehension
in every line of that fair face, watching the deathbed of
his father, and soothing the last hours of him who had
caused her so much pain. He felt from his heart that
a common exaggeration of affection was, to her at least,
well applied, though he would not himself apply it; and
he listened well pleased when Bertha, after watching
Alice long with the usual dark and stern expression,
burst forth at length, “Thou art certainly an angel.”
Towards the evening of the fifth day there seemed a
slight improvement in the condition of the earl. He
slept for an hour or two in the course of the evening.
His mind was more collected; he recognised his son, and
Alice Herbert, and her father at all times; and although
his words occasionally wandered and his eyes looked
wild, yet there were evident promises of returning judg-
ment and returning strength; and both Alice and Lang-
ford hoped—and in a degree trusted because they hoped

—that the earl might yet regain his corporeal healtn,
and that his mind, like the air purified by a thunder-
storm, might rise freed from all the vehement passions
which had worked up the tempest that had hung around
the last few days. -
Nevertheless, the vital powers were evidently dimin
1shed in a terrible degree; and the eye of the surgeon
at once perceived that the sleep he enjoyed was the
sleep of exhaustion; that feebleness, and not returning
health, brought repose; and that, although that repose
might perhaps produce the only favourable change which
his situation admitted, there were a thousand chances
to one against its restoring him to health.
It was on that very night that a messenger arrived
from a village at a considerable distance, eagerly asking
to speak with the Earl of Danemore; and, on being
questioned by Langford, he at once informed him that
he came to bear the earl tidings of his son Lord Harold's
safety, as well as a note under the young nobleman's
own hand, with which he had been intrusted. Some
discussions ensued between the rector, Sir Walter, and
Langford, as to whether it would be expedient, in the
earl's state at that moment, to communicate to him the
intelligence which had just been received.
Sir Walter, who had seen less of the world than his
young friend, and had examined much less deeply that
which he had seen, eagerly entreated Langford to com-
municate the tidings to the earl directly, declaring that
the news of his son's safety must necessarily act as the
best remedy which could be applied to his case. The
good knight spoke from the impulse of a fine and gener-
ous mind, practically unacquainted with evil, and with
all the complicated and even opposite impulses which
the existence of evil in the human mind must necessa-
rily produce. The rector urged the same course through
mere ignorance; for he was a man of no strong sensa-
tions himself, and those sensations which he did possess
were merely the animal ones. To hear of a son's wel-
fare, he felt in himself, must-separate from all other
things—be a joyful event; and he was incapable of
weighing, or judging, or even comprehending the vari-
ous circumstances which might render that which was
in itself joyful, most painful and agitating.
Langford, however, knew better. He had discovered
before this time many of the deep, peculiar points in

-The ROBBER, 135
the earl's character, and he knew all the particular de-
tails of his situation which might make the certainty of
his brother's life and speedy return a matter of appre-
hension, care, and emotion. Both his companions,
however, so strongly urged him to communicate at
once the tidings to his father, that he felt he could not
and he ought not to withhold them.
He cared not, it is true, what others would think of
his conduct; but it might, perhaps, be a weakness in
Langford, that—knowing well, by early experience of
the world and all the world's baseness, the many turns,
the subtle disguises, the strange, masquerading tricks
which selfishness will take to deceive, not only the
natural and habitual egotist, but the kindest and the
most liberal of men, where any dear interest, or preju-
dice, or affection is at stake—he was as much upon his
guard against himself as if he had known himself to be
ungenerous; and was always more willing to take the
opinion of others in a matter where his own interest
might be risked than on subjects where self was totally
out of the question.
In the present instance, it was clear that the life or
death of his brother might make the greatest difference
in the earl's views and feelings; and although he knew
himself too well not to be sure that the consideration of
such a difference would influence him not in the slight-
est degree in regard to withholding or communicating
the news he had received, yet he yielded to the opinion
of others against his own better judgment, when he
would not have done so had his own interests been in
no degree implicated. He only demanded that Sir
Walter himself should communicate the tidings; and
he warned him, when he agreed to do so, that the effect
might be more powerful than he expected.
Sir Walter, though he totally misunderstood the view
that Langford took and the fears which he entertained,
acted from natural goodness of heart and sensibility of
feeling, exactly as his young friend could have desired,
only apprehending that the joy would be so great as to
perform the part of grief itself.
Although he had resolved at first not to do so—lest
his very presence might excite in the mind of his dying
father those painful combinations on which his thoughts
had evidently been wandering during his delirium—
Langford followed Sir Walter into the room, and stood

at a little distance behind, listening, with a heart whoga
accelerated beatings told even to himself how deeply
he was interested by the words in which the worthy
knight clothed his communication.
“I have got what I trust may be pleasant news for
you, my good lord,” said Sir Walter, as he seated him-
self deliberately in the chair by the earl’s bedside, af-
fecting the greatest possible degree of composure and
tranquillity as he did so, and banishing every appear-
ance of haste or excitement from his manner.
“What is it?” demanded the earl, turning round to-
wards him as quickly as he could; for he no longer
started up with that vehemence which he had displayed
but a few days before. “What is it? Are the papers
found ! For ever since Eugenie—but I wander, I wan-
der. I feel that I wander, that I have been wandering
for many days. But go on, go on. I am more collect
ed now. What of the papers? It was about them you
were talking, was it not?”
“No, my lord,” replied Sir Walter: “we were not
talking about the papers, but of something which, if I
judge rightly, may prove of as great interest as even
their recovery; I mean that of your son. We have
heard some tidings of him, my lord.”
“What are they, sir!” demanded the earl. “Speak!
What are they?”
“They are all as favourable as you could desire,” re-
plied Sir Walter, in the same calm manner. “We have
heard that he is rapidly recovering, and has escaped from
the hands of the people who detained him.” And, see-
ing that the earl listened without reply, he added, “We
may, I trust, soon expect him here.”
Lord Danemore pressed his thin white hand—through
the blanched and shrivelled skin of which might be seen
protruding the large bones and joints which had once
marked his extraordinary strength—upon his eyes, and
remained for several minutes in deep thought. He then
withdrew his hand, and, turning to Sir Walter Herbert,
he said, in a low voice, “It is a terrible thing not to be
able to thank God for the recovery of a son that we
love; not to know whether we desire to see him before
we die or not.”
“It is, indeed, a terrible thing, my lord,” replied Sir
Walter; “but I trust that such is not your case, and
that your son's coming will give you unmixed pleasure.”

THE ROBBER. - 137
“Far from it,” replied the earl, gloomily. “He will
nave to hear sad truths; to undergo mortifications the
most bitter to a proud nature like his. He will have to
hear of his father's faults and crimes; he will have to
learn that, instead of vast wealth, a noble name, and a
high rank, he has no inheritance but that of an illegiti-
mate son; that he has no name; that he has no station;
that he has no rank; and all as the consequence of his
father's faults. I know him, Sir Walter Herbert; I
know him; and there is too much of my own blood in
his veins for me to expect that he should do anything,
in the bitter disappointment of a proud spirit, but curse
him who, for his own gratification, and in the indulgence
of mad and headlong passions, brought shame, and sor-
row, and disgrace upon him. My own blood, I say, will
cry out against me in his heart. He will curse me, as
I would have cursed my father had he so acted. He
will look down upon me as I lie here like a writhing
worm, and he will think that it is only because my cor-
poreal vigour is at an end, and my strong heart weak-
ened by abasing sickness, that I do those acts of justice
which I had determined on longere I knew these wounds
to be fatal; which I had determined on as soon as I found
that he whom I had wronged, that he who had borne
with me so patiently, that he who had defended me,
and rescued me from death, was my own child, the son
of her I early loved. He will misconceive, he will mis-
understand it all. I know his heart from my own; and
I know that, in my meeting with him under these cir-
cumstances, all will be dark, and stormy, and terrible.
I feel not even sure that it will be better for him to live
rather than to die, as we supposed he had. I feel not
sure that death would not be preferable to the feelings
he will have to endure. He will not bear the crossing
of his high fortune meekly. He will strive against it;
he will strive to prove the words false that take from
him his high station, even though they are spoken by
his father. He will contend for the rank, and fortune,
and place which he has so long expected, even with his
brother. Through life he will go on in bitterness and
disappointment. His heart will henceforth be full of
gall, and his lip breathing curses. It would have been
so with me, and why should it not be so with him He
is my own child, the inheritor of mv nature, if not of my
name.”

It was evident that he was exciting himself by the
exaggerated picture which his imagination drew to 2
fearful and a dangerous degree; and Langford could not
restrain from advancing and trying to sooth him.
“My dear father,” he said, “if such be really Edward's
character—though I think you judge of him and of your
self too harshly—how much better it will be to take she
middle course that I have proposed; to conceal from
him the period of my mother's death; and never to let
him know that the marriage to which he owes his birth
was an unlawful one. Willingly I offered, and willing-
ly I repeat the offer to do more, and abandon to him al-
together the rank and station which he has held in Eng-
land, the estates which are attached to the title of our
ancestors, and content myself with justifying my moth-
er's fair fame to her kindred in another land, and with
claiming there the fortune to which I have a right through
my noble uncle.” -
“You are all your mother!” exclaimed the earl, ga-
zing upon him. But then other feelings seemed to rush
across his mind; the expression of his countenance
changed, and he exclaimed, “What! would you have
me afraid of my own son? Would you have me das-
tardly conceal the truth from him for fear of his anger?
No, no, he must hear it. It may be bitter, but he must
hear it. Bitter things are good for us sometimes. But
from whose lips shall he hear it?” he added, after a mo-
ment's pause. “Not from mine, Henry, not from mine,
for I feel that the hour is drawing nigh! I shall never
see him more in life. I feel that there is a chill hand
upon me: surely it must be the hand of death !”
It was so, for from that moment the earl rapidly sunk.
His senses did not leave him again, however, and from
time to time he spoke to those around him. He ex-
pressed neither hope nor fear in regard to the future.
The only words, in fact, which he uttered at all refer-
ring to the awful consideration of a future life, were
spoken about an hour after the conversation had taken
place which we have just detailed. He then beckoned
Alice to draw nearer, took her hand affectionately in
his, and, as she bent down to listen, he said, “I owe
you much, sweet lady; much for all that you have done
for me; but more than all for the endeavour to give me
such hopes and expectations as may best sooth and
cheer this last dark hour. Whether such hopes are to

be realized I shall soon see, and as far as bitterly re-
penting everything I have done amiss, I have followed
the injunction to the letter. But alas! Alice, if it be
necessary to the repentance you speak of to bow down
in terror as well as in remorse, that, struggle for it as
I may, I cannot accomplish. I can repent, but I cannot
fear. I am ready to meet my doom, whatever it may
be, and to endure it to the utmost. Nevertheless, to
you I owe deep thanks, and you have them. Now leave
me, sweet lady. Farewell for the last time ! I would
not have you see me die.” -
His words had turned Alice deadly pale, and Langford,
taking her hand, led her from the room. She found re-
lief, however, in tears. She then strove to read, but
she could not; and she sat waiting in the rector's par-
lour with a heavy heart till she heard footsteps moving
down the stairs. Her father and Langford then entered
the room. The latter was pale and grave, but calm
and firm; and, sitting down by Alice's side, he laid his
hand upon hers, saying, “Thank you, my beloved Al-
ice, for all that you have done to sooth the deathbed of
my father.”
It was enough, and Alice again burst into tears; but
the next moment a servant entered the room, asking
the two gentlemen if they knew where was the rector.
“He is up stairs, in the chamber of death,” said Sir
Walter; “but you had better not disturb him at pres--
ent.”
“Why, sir, I must disturb him,” said the man, “for
there is a gentleman waiting who came down two or
three days ago, in a coach with only two horses, and
who has been hanging about here and up at the castle
ever since, though nobody knows who he is. He de-
sires to speak with my master immediately. He has
inquired every day if the earl were still living, but would
not give his name or tell his business. So I must dis-
turb my master.”
“Do so, then,” replied Sir Walter, and the man left
the room.

CHAPTER XIII.
THE words which the servant had spoken, in an-
nouncing to Sir Walter Herbert the arrival of a stranger,
had made but little impression either upon the worthy
knight or on the son of the deceased nobleman; and,
after a broken conversation, in which pauses of deep
and solemn thought constantly interrupted their dis-
course, Langford was begging Sir Walter to convey
his daughter from that melancholy house to her own
happy home, when the rector entered the room, bring-
ing with him a person unknown to any one present.
“I am forced to intrude upon you, sir,” said the
clergyman, addressing Langford, “as this gentleman
who has just presented himself has come on business
in which you are deeply interested.”
“It is an unpleasant moment, sir,” replied Langford,
“for me to enter upon any business at all. I am oc-
cupied with very gloomy thoughts and very painful
feelings, and I could wish that the business, whatever
it is, might be postponed till to-morrow.”
“I am very sorry, sir, both for your sake and my own,
that that cannot be,” replied the stranger, advancing.
He was a man about the middle age; tall and well
made, though meager; courtly in his personal appear-
ance, and bearing in his whole demeanour the stamp
of gentleman. Nevertheless, there was something re-
pulsive in his aspect; something cold and cynical and
dry, which was smoothed down, indeed, by courtesy
of manner and personal grace, but which, nevertheless,
tended to make Langford the less inclined to enter into
any conversation with him at that moment. The
stranger, however, went on, and the next few words
he uttered were sufficient to show him to whom they
were addressed that he must meet the subject at once.
“It will, perhaps, sir,” the stranger said, “be satis-
factory to you to know, in the first instance, who it is
that is forced to intrude upon you, which our worthy
and reverend friend here has forgotten to mention.
My name is Sir Henry Heywood; I have the honour
of being second cousin to the late Earl of Danemore,

ThE ROBBER. - 141
and in default of his son Lord Harold, who there is
good reason to believe, I find, is dead, am heir to the
title and estates of the late peer.”
There was something in the manner of his announ.
cing himself—the tone, the demeanour, the look—that
galled Langford not a little, and made him assume like-
wise a cold dryness of manner which was not natural
to him. To the stranger's announcement, then, he
only replied by drawing up his head, and demanding,
“Well, sir, what then 1” -
The shortness of this reply seemed to puzzle Sir
Henry Heywood a good deal, for he paused a moment
or two before he answered, and then begun with some
degree of hesitation: “Why, sir, under these circum-
stances,” he said at length, “during the absence and
probable death of Lord Harold, I am the only fit person
to take possession of the late earl's papers and effects.”
“I do not feel quite sure of that,” replied Langford,
in the same tone.
“Pray then, sir,” demanded Sir Henry, “if you con-
sider yourself a fitter person than I am, and the ques-
tion be not an impertinent one, will you inform me who
it is I have the honour of addressing, for this excellent
divine has given me but vague information upon the
subject?”
The question somewhat embarrassed Langford, for he
had determined to wait for his brother’s return ere he
took any step whatsoever in regard to asserting his
rights as the eldest son of the late earl, and to be
guided entirely by the frame of mind in which he found
that brother at the time. He determined, therefore, to
evade it as far as possible for the moment, and conse-
quently replied, “The character in which, sir, I should
oppose your taking possession of the papers of the late
earl, is that of one of his lordship's executors; and, in
order to satisfy yourself that I am justified in assuming
that character, as well as my friend here, Sir Walter
Herbert, and the worthy rector himself, who are the
only persons named, you have nothing to do but to
consult with Mr. Evelyn the lawyer, who drew up the
earl's will four or five days ago, and will inform you
that such is the case. He is now, I think, in the next
room, writing. Let him be called in.”
“That is unnecessary, that is unnecessary,” said Sil
Henry Heywood. “Of his lordship's will at the pres-

ent moment we are supposed to know nothing; and I
must contend that I, as the next heir, in default of Ed-
ward Lord Harold, am entitled to take possession of
the papers, especially as there is every reason to be-
lieve that I am at this moment Earl of Danemore.”
“There is every reason to believe the contrary,” re-
plied Langford, growing provoked; “and great reason
to believe also that you never will be so. If you are
at all acquainted with the handwriting of the gentleman
you call Lord Harold, you will recognise it in that
note, which was received from him not three hours
ago, informing his father that he was not only alive,
but at liberty, and rapidly recovering from the injuries
he had received.”
Thus saying, he threw down the note on the table
before him, and, after eying it with a cursory glance,
the countenance of Sir Henry Heywood fell amazingly;
nevertheless, he replied, in the same bold tone, “I am
extremely happy, sir, that such is the case; but this
does not in the least prevent me from insisting on my
right till Lord Harold appears.”
Langford was about to reply, perhaps angrily, but
Sir Walter Herbert interposed, saying, “It seems to
me, sir, that you are pressing forward a very painful
discussion at a very painful moment, and I really do
not understand what is your object in so doing.”
“Why, I will explain my object in a few words, sir,”
replied the other. “There is a gentleman, I under-
stand, who has of late set up some chimerical claim
as eldest son of the late Earl of Danemore, in which it
seems that he has persuaded the earl on his deathbed
to concur —”
Langford's cheek grew very red, and his lip quivered;
but Alice, who was sitting by him, laid her hand upon
his arm, and looked imploringly up in his face.
Langford bowed down his head with a smile, saying, .
in a low tone, “Do not be afraid, sweetest; these
matters are not decided by the sword.” - -
In the mean while Sir Henry went on, saying,
“Under these circumstances, sir, I think it absolutely
necessary that the papers of the earl should be placed
in safe keeping, for we have seen too much lately, in

It was Sir Walter Herbert's cheek that now turned
red, and he replied somewhat sharply, “Sir, your im-
putations are of a character— But it matters not,” he
added, interrupting himself. “I will not be provoked
to forget my age or my station. The late Earl of Dane-
more has appointed three respectable persons, of whom
I, perhaps, myself am the least worthy, to act as his
executors, and to take possession of all his papers after
his death. The testimony of Mr. Evelyn to that effect
will be sufficient till we have an opportunity of reading
the will, which was given by the late earl into that
gentleman's keeping. Do not interrupt me, sir! But,
in order to satisfy you completely till the will is read,
I am perfectly willing, and, doubtless, the two other
executors are so also, to permit of your putting your
seal in conjunction with ours upon all the effects of the
late earl. Does this satisfy you?”
“Why, I suppose it must,” replied Sir Henry; “al-
though,” he added, giving a bitter and angry glance
towards Langford, “I am sorry that I cannot get this
gentleman to put forth his claims and acknowledge his
purposes boldly and straightforwardly.”
“My not doing so, sir,” replied Langford, “proceeds,
I beg to inform you, from sources and considerations
which have no reference to you whatsoever. If there
were not such a worshipful person as Sir Henry Hey-
wood in existence, I should behave exactly as I do now.
The matter remains to be settled, not between me and
you, but between myself and another.”
“It may do so,” replied Sir Henry Heywood, “or it
may not.”
“But I say, sir, it does,” replied Langford, frowning.
“You misunderstand me, sir,” replied the other, with
the same dry courtesy. “I do not mean to impugn
your word in the least. I have no doubt that you are
perfectly a man of honour and integrity. All I meant
to say was, that, after all, Lord Harold may never ap-
pear. However, I am bound to take care of my own
rights, and from those rights neither frowns nor high
words will move me. In the mean time I accept the
terms proposed. We will both put our seals upon all
the cabinets and private receptacles of the earl's papers,
either till his son Edward appears, or till the will is
opened, and persons lawfully in power take possession
thereof. I seek nothing but what is straightforward

*
and right, but I am firm in pursuing that which I do
seek.”
“After all, the man is right,” thougnt Langford to
himself, for he was one of those marvels that can ac-
knowledge an adversary right; “he does it in a disa-
greeable and harsh way, it is true, when a few sweet
words would have honeyed the thing over, and made it
palatable instead of bitter. Nevertheless, he is right,
and we must not quarrel with the manner.” -
“Well, sir,” he continued, aloud, “I am ready to pro-
ceed with you in the matter you propose. We will, if
you please, take the lawyer with us, and my worthy
and reverend co-executor will probably do me the fa-
vour to accompany us. Sir Walter, I think, will trust
to my accuracy; for, if I am right, he ordered his coach
to convey himself and daughter home, and we need no.
detain him.”
“Alice will go home with her maid,” said Sir Walter
“I have much to speak to you about to-night, Henry
and many things to settle here; therefore, if the good
doctor will give me lodging for one night more, I will
remain.”
The rector expressed his satisfaction; but Langford
looked out of the window upon the sky to mark how
far the sun had declined; for, after all that had happened
during the last few weeks, he could not part with the
only being that he loved deeply upon earth, even upon
a short but unprotected journey like that before Alice
Herbert, without feeling something like the apprehen-
siveness of strong affection steal over his heart. . The
plan proposed by Sir Walter, however, was followed.
Alice took her departure, and, to save the reader any
unnecessary doubt, we may say, arrived in safety.
The four gentlemen then called in Mr. Evelyn, the
attorney, upon whom Sir Henry Heywood thought fit
to be very condescending; but he found Mr. Evelyn as
short and dry as even he himself could have desired in
one of his own shortest and dryest moods. The lawyer
said, when he was informed of their object, that there
was not the slightest necessity for any one to seal up
the papers except the executors, as he had the will in
his pocket, and their names were endorsed upon it, so
that the persons appointed could be ascertained at once,
without the indecency of opening the paper within an
hour of the testator's death. -

Langford, however, to save any farther discussion,
anformed him that it had been so arranged; and, in the
first place, notwithstanding all the many painful feelings
that were busy at his heart, he accompanied the others
with a firm step into the room where his father's body lay.
Sir Walter Herbert cast down his eyes, and would
not look upon him as he entered. The rector, on the
contrary, took a quick glance to see how he bore it;
but all was firm and calm; sad, but self-possessed; and
while the others proceeded to their task of sealing up
several cabinets which had been brought from Dane-
more Castle after the fire, Langford advanced to the
side of the bed of death, by which, as was then custom-
ary, stood a light on either side, and gazed in upon the
countenance of him who had just departed.
All was calm and still on that face, where so many
fierce and violent passions had displayed themselves
through life. All was peaceful, tranquil, even happy
in the expression. The muscles which had habitually
contracted the brow were now relaxed, and the deep
wrinkle between the thick eyebrows was obliterated.
The closed eyelids veiled the quick, keen, flashing eyes
which had now lost not only the blaze of passion, but
the lustre of life; and the lip which had quivered with
a thousand emotions in a moment; which had now
curled with bitter scorn; had now been raised with
hasty indignation; had now been shut with suppressed
passion, and now been drawn down with stern deter-
mination, was motionless, meaningless. The only ex-
pression that it bore, if it bore any, was that of gent}e
and quiet repose; an expression which is so consonant
to the features of a child, that, in infants, we trace it
alike in sleeping, in waking, and in death; but which is
seldom, if ever, seen in sleep upon the countenance of
the aged, though it is sometimes assumed by them in
waking life, when a natural placidity of disposition
overcomes cares, infirmities, anxieties, regrets, and all
the heavy burden of years; and is often, very often
seen when the hand of the eternal tranquillizer, death,
has stilled the fiery passions into his deep unbroken re-
OSe. -
p Langford gazed long and wistfully, and at length the
finger of Sir Walter Herbert, laid gently on his sleeve,
made him start ; and, turning round, he left the apart-
ment with a deep sigh that thus should have ended a
W6 L. II.—N

life full of mighty energies and noble capabilities, which
might have been devoted to the accomplishment of a
thousand great and magnificent things. The whole
party thence proceeded to Danemore Castle, and went
through the same process of sealing up all the private
cabinets and chests which could be found. Few, in-
deed, were there still in existence, for the greater por-
tion had been kept in that part of the building which
was burned; and though Sir Henry Heywood showed
an inclination at first to make himself sure that all had
been consumed beyond the line marked out as that of
the fire, he was very soon satisfied by nearly breaking
his neck down a flight of stairs that seemed tolerably
steadfast till he set his unlucky foot upon them.
This being done, and Sir Henry quite assured that the
other parts of the castle were not practicable for human
feet, a low and formal bow separated the two parties,
and the expectant heir of the earldom retired to the
small village public house, where he had put up on his
arrival, and immediately sent off for shrewd lawyers to
advise with him in the circumstances in which he stood.
As the others returned on foot towards the rectory,
Sir Walter took the arm of Langford in one hand, while
he gently grasped that of the lawyer, Master Evelyn,
with the other, saying in a low and kindly tone, “We
must lose no time!”
“Certainly not, Sir Walter,” said the lawyer; “we
must lose no time, indeed, for opponents, you see, are
in the field quick.”
“But,” said Langford, “perhaps—”
“There is no “perhaps, my lord,” replied Master Ev-
elyn, interrupting him, but with a civil and courteous
tone, and a deprecatory bow; “I know quite well what
you would say, that perhaps your mind is not made up
how to act; but all which I mean to urge is, that it is
necessary to be fully prepared to act in any way that
you may think fit at a moment's notice. Here is your
father's declaration in regard to his marriage, drawn up
and sworn to. It is now expedient to take the declara-
tion of the good lady, Mistress Bertha, and swear her
thereunto before one if not two magistrates, as well as
to employ every means of obtaining farther proof and
information upon the subject. You may act afterward
as you think fit.”
Langford readily agreed that the lawyer was in the

right, although he felt a repugnance at that moment to
follow with even apparent eagerness his claim to the
heritage of him who was just dead. He returned, how-
ever, to the rectory, where Bertha had still remained,
and she soon appeared in answer to his summons.
There were traces of tears upon her cheeks; and
when Langford, speaking some soothing and consoling
word, explained to her his object in sending for her,
she replied, “You have done well, sir. You have done
well, for I feel that I shall not live long; and what I
have to say had better be rightly taken down. I feel
that I shall not live long, I say, because, for the first
time for thirty years, I have shed tears. It is a weak-
ness that I did not expect to fall upon me again; but
now that the last of those who have been connected
with my fate is gone into the tomb, I feel that the time
is come for me to take my departure also ; and these
tears, I suppose, are a few drops of rain ere the dark
night sets in.” -
“I trust not, Bertha,” said Langford, in a kindly tone.
“I trust not, indeed. The last being connected with
your fate has not departed; for surely my fate has been
strongly and strangely connected with yours, and I have
so much to thank you for that I would fain show my
gratitude, and make the last days of your life pass hap-
pily away.”
“You have, perhaps, something to thank me for,” re-
plied Bertha, “but more to blame and hate me for.
But you know I am not a person of many words; and
if I am to tell all that I know of you and yours, let me
do it now, and as shortly as may be.”
“In the first place,” said Mr. Evelyn, “we had better
send for another magistrate; the lady can make her dec-
laration in the mean while, and swear to it afterward.”
“Do not call me the lady, Master Lawyer,” said
Bertha, with her usual cold sharpness; “I am no lady.
I am Bertha the housekeeper. But send for what ma-
gistrate you like. I will say nothing that I will not
swear to.”
A messenger was accordingly sent off for Sir Matthew
£pe, and in the mean while Bertha went on with her
tale. -
“I was born on the beautiful coast of Brittany,” she
said: “my father was a small holder under the Lords
of Beaulieu, his mother's ancestors,” and she pointed

to Langford. “The chateau stood upon a high rock
crowned with thick woods above the sea; for on those
sweet shores the green leaves dip themselves in the
green waters. At fifteen years of age I went to attend
upon the Lady Eugenie, his mother, who was some
two years older than myself. The Lords of Beaulieu
were fathers to all beneath them, and she was as a sis-
ter to me. She found out that even at that early age 1
loved, and that there was little hope of him I loved ever
being able to win my father's consent, for my father
was wealthy for a peasant. She told her father and
her brother, and prayed their help; they gave it; and
so well did they do for my happiness, that, ere two
summers were over, Henri Kerouet was the prosperous
owner of a small trading-ship. My father's consent
was given, the day was appointed, and, two days before,
I saw from the windows of the castle my father, my
two brothers, and my lover put out to sea in a fine boat,
to buy things at Quimperlé for the wedding. I watched
them from the windows of my young mistress's room
with the eyes of love, and saw them skim for half a
mile over the water as if it had been a thing of their
own; but then, I know not how or why, the sail flapped
upon the water, the boat upset, and all that were in it
disappeared. One of them rose again for a moment,
and clung to the side of the boat. I think it was Henri;
but, ere my screams called attention, and other boats
could put off, his weary hold had given way, and he too
was beneath the waters.
“There is in every woman's breast a history; and
this is mine. I had but one brother left; every other
relation was gone, and him I loved also. My heart
was shut up from that hour never to open again. My
young mistress was all kindness, and tenderness, and
benevolence; she kept me with her; she strove to
sooth and to console; but she had soon need of conso-
lation and soothing herself, for her father died suddenly
as he sat at breakfast beside her, and she remained an
orphan in the castle of her aucestors for several weeks,
till her brother, who was with the army, could obtain
permission to return to his estates. When he did come
he brought with him one whom I remember well, as he
then crossed the threshold in all the graces, the powers
and the fiery passions of youth; one whom you have all
seen bent and worn by age and by care, and by the

punishment of those passions indulged; one who lies
within a few steps of us even now, in the cold and
marble stiffness of death, with all the stormy impulses
of his nature passed away. He was then like a fiery
warhorse, full of beauty, and strength, and danger; for
there was nothing on earth that he dared not to do;
there were but too few things, also, which, with such a
mind and such a body, he could not accomplish. He
loved my mistress, and my mistress loved him, ere
many weeks of his sojourn with us had passed away.
“He brought with him a boy of some twelve or four
teen years old; a gay, wild, fearless creature like him.
self; the son, as I understood, of a poor but noble gen-
tleman, who had placed him as a page, to learn from
infancy the art of war with the young lord. This boy
would often sit and tell me of wild scenes which had
taken place in the civil strifes of England, and some-
times would glance at stranger and more terrible things
still in western lands, where they both had sojourned
long. This Franklin Gray it was who first called my
notice to the love that was growing up between the two;
and I saw how strong it was, though there was nothing
avowed as yet between them.
“The time came for the young marquis to return to
the wars. The English lord was to return with him,
and still nothing was spoken of their love, at least so
far as I could learn; but, on the day when they were
about to depart, the young foreigner turned to my mis-
tress, in her brother's presence, and said, ‘Lady, I have
a parting present to make you. You have applauded
and admired my gay young page. In the present beg-
gary of my fortunes, I can do but little for him; I pray
you take him to your service, and, when he is old
enough, let your noble brother do what he can to pro
mote him in the career of arms. Till then, as he is of
gentle blood, he may well serve a gentle lady. He
spoke gayly, and, as it seemed, freely; but I could ob
serve a peculiar expression on his face which gave the
words more meaning; and there came at the same time
the blood, like a rising rebel, into my mistress's cheek,
telling that she comprehended him well.
“It had been arranged that, while the marquis was
absent, she should proceed to England to join her uncle,
then on a political mission in London, rather than re-
main in solitude in France. A vessel was engaged, and

in a few days after she had parted with her brother and
her lover, she embarked, with myself, the boy Franklin
Gray as servant, and the priest. We met with foul
weather, and the ship with difficulty reached a port upon
the coast of Cornwall, where we landed; but there,
upon the pretext of fatigue and illness, she determined
to remain some days; and, on the first night of our ar.
rival, she despatched the boy Franklin Gray to London,
both to announce her safety to her uncle, and, as it
proved, to communicate with one who, in disguise, had
returned to his native land, at the risk of life, for the
purpose of meeting her.
“As soon as the boy was gone she told me all; how
they loved, and how their love had been told; and of the
impossibility of his asking her hand at that time, while
in exile and in poverty, having nothing but his sword to
depend upon. When the boy returned she seemed a
good deal agitated; and, as when once she had given
her confidence it was extreme, she told me that she had
received messages from the earl begging her to follow
a particular course in her journey, in order that he
might see her, if but for a moment, by the way. She
shaped her course accordingly, and passed through the
very scenes where now we are; and at the little town
of Uppington, not ten miles hence, she was met by the
earl. He had obtained—Heaven knows how ! for I do
not—a considerable sum of money, which raised high
his hopes and expectations. He pressed her to be.
united to him immediately in private. Love was strong
and eloquent in her breast, and she consented. She
exacted, however, that their marriage should be solemn-
ized according to the rites of his faith and the laws of
his country, as well as according to her own.
“The good weak priest who accompanied her was
easily induced to perform the ceremony of our church,
and the earl had now wealth sufficient fully to bribe the
priest of that village; but as it was determined that in
a very few days she should go on to join her uncle, and
double the quickness of her journey to make up for the
lost time, I only and one of the servants were admitted
to be present as witnesses to a marriage which was to
be held strictly secret. I saw them married by the
rites of both churches; and my mistress, for her hon
our's sake, demanded and received from both priests
certificates of the marriage. The day before that on

which she was to have set out, news arrived of the
death of Cromwell, and a rumour that all was in
confusion through the country across which we had
to pass. The tidings did not make them very sad,
for they were in their first happiness; but the boy
Franklin Gray was again sent to London, in company
with our good weak priest, to see her uncle, and ask
whether she should come on. At the end of a week the
boy returned alone. Her uncle had left London in
haste, and the poor priest had been involved in a tumult
in the streets; had been recognised as belonging to the
Catholic Church, and had been murdered by the brutal
populace. For him she grieved sincerely; but it seen-
ed to me that she was not very sorry that a fair excuse
was given her for remaining with her husband, and
sharing his fate, whatever that fate might be.
“She soon experienced, however, the sad lot of those
who cast themselves upon the mercy of man. He was
violent, rash, hasty. There were matters grieved him
deeply. The sum that he possessed was drawing near
to a close, and he wished much, it was evident, ere two
months were over—I do not say to annul his marriage,
for I believe, nay, I am sure, he loved her still—but to
have it concealed for the time. He urged her, then, to
return to her brother, showing her that it would be with
difficulty he could support her, even if he were not him-
self by chance discovered by lingering longer in Eng-
land; and he framed for her a plausible story to account
for the period of her absence, which, in times of such
danger and confusion, might easily be done.
“She refused, however, firmly, though mildly. She
said that though, so long as it merely referred to con-
cealing her marriage, she was willing to do all he
wished, but that, as soon as it could no longer be con-
cealed but by a falsehood, she could yield no farther;
that nothing should ever induce her to tell her noble
brother a lie. Anger and fury on his part succeeded.
I and the boy Franklin were in the room; and the earl,
when he found that passion could effect nothing, turned
to me, thinking that I might persuade my mistress to
consent. She had that morning given me some of.
fence; for I had ever been idle and vain, and the terrible
fate which had befallen me had not cured my follies,
though it had imbittered my heart. I did not try to per-
suade her, but I said maliciously and falsely, for I knew

better, that I thought she was very wrong not to do as
her husband told her.
“She gazed upon me with surprise and indignation ;
but the boy Franklin burst forth, exclaiming, “She does
very right not to tell a lie for any one; and the earl,
in his passion, struck him down to the ground.
“The boy instantly drew his dagger and sprang upon
the earl, but he wrenched it from his hand in a moment,
and, putting him forth from the door, returned laughing,
moved to merriment, even in the midst of his anger, by
the youth's daring. With him the storm for a time
passed away; but from that moment my mistress
seemed to look upon me with contempt. I felt that I
merited it, and hated her the more. All her good deeds,
all her kindness towards me, were forgotten; and two
or three hasty words which she spoke the next morning,
in her indignation of my conduct, became like poison,
and rankled in my heart. Thus passed two or three
- more days; and I laid a scheme which succeeded but
too well. I looked at the earl often as I passed him,
seeking to draw his attention, and make him speak to
me upon the matter of his dispute with my lady. A"
length, one day he did so, and I hurriedly and basely ad-
vised him to obtain from her by any means the proof of
her marriage, and then let her refuse to go back to her
brother for a time if she dared. My mistress came in
as we were speaking, and looked surprised, but said
nothing; and the earl followed my advice. He tried
many methods to arrive at his purpose; but it was in a
moment of love and affection that he induced her to
give him up the certificates, the attestations of myself
and the other servant, and all the proofs of her mar-
riage, upon the pretence that he would keep them more
securely. A doubt, however, seemed to cross her
mind, even when she was placing them in his hands,
for she asked him to swear most solemnly that he
would never destroy them; and I remèmber particular
ly, that when he said he would swear by everything he
held sacred, she insisted upon his adding that he swore
upon his honour as an English gentleman.
“When he had got the papers, however, and he knew
that he could compel her to do whatsoever he liked, his
love and his tenderness seemed to return in full force,
and the idea of parting with her at all was evidently
hateful to him. At length, howeve"y com- .

pelled him to propose it again, and once more high
words and angry discussion ensued; and then it was
that all the smothered feelings which she had been long
nourishing towards myself burst forth. She accused
me of alienating her husband's affection. She called
me base, ungrateful, criminal. She told me to leave
her presence, and never reappear in it again; and I did
leave her, determined to return to France, and obey her
to the letter.
“How the matter would have ended between herself
and her husband, I know not, had not other circum-
stances intervened; for, with all his violent passions, he
certainly loved her still, deeply, tenderly, devotedly.
But news was suddenly brought him that his real name
and character, which he had concealed, had been dis-
covered, and that warrants were out for his apprehen-
sion as what they called a Malignant. He returned to
the house for a few minutes after receiving these
tidings, informed his wife what had taken place, took,
as I am told, a tender and affectionate leave of her, and
besought her to hasten to France with all speed, where
he would join her ere ten days were over. The spot
was named, the time fixed, and I saw him press her
warmly to his heart as they parted.
“He then spoke to me for a moment, and, bidding me
forget all that had passed, enjoined me to remain with
and console my mistress. I refused at once sternly
and bitterly to do so; and, as he had no time to lose,
and found my determination fixed, he only further asked
me to let him know without fail wherever I established
my abode, that he might show his gratitude for my ser-
vices in brighter days, and do away the evil feelings
between my mistress and myself. I told him that he
would always hear of me at the house of my brother, and
he departed. He was scarcely gone when I too left the
house, and found my way back to France alone, but
took care not to revisit the place of my birth, believing
that a bad name had gone there before me. What hap-
pened to my mistress then I do not know; but I heard
that, keeping only the boy Franklin Gray to attend upon
her, she had sold all her jewels—”
“We had better not admit anything into the declara-
tion,” said Mr. Evelyn, “except what you personally
saw or knew, my good lady. Indeed, as it is, only parts
* the declaration can be made use of.”

“I am neither good nor a lady, Master Lawyer,” re.
plied Bertha. “But, to go on with what I personally
know ; about a year and a half after, or perhaps two
years, a letter reached me by a circuitous route from
the Earl of Danemore, telling me that the restoration
of the Stuart family to the throne of England had re-
stored him to his native land and all his honours, and
that, if I chose to come to England, and occupy that
post in his household which I lately filled, I should
spend the rest of my days in comfort, and peace, and
honour. I agreed to do so, for where I then was I was
very miserable; and I set out for England. When I
came into his presence, however, he scarcely knew me;
for when he had last seen me I had been a blooming,
perhaps a handsöme girl; and in that short space, grief,
anxiety, and self-reproach had made me, with very little
difference, what I now am. To my surprise, however,
I found that his house was occupied by a noble and
beautiful bride; and, when he told me, I gazed in his
face with wonder and apprehension. He understood
my looks, and with that stern, determined air which
was so natural to his countenance, he told me, in a few
short words, that when he had returned to France, being
hopeless and nearly destitute, he had not sought out his
wife as he had promised, trusting that she would go back
to her brother and conceal her marriage, as he from the
first had wished. The Marquis de Beaulieu had sought
him out, however, and covered him with reproaches;
they had fought, and both had been severely wounded.
‘I then, he added, ‘went into other lands, but suddenly
found that the king had been restored. I returned to
my native country, but speedily perceived that, though
I had sacrificed everything for my sovereign, I could
regain my honours, but could not regain one half of my
estates without using the influence of another peer, all
powerful with the king. To him I applied, and he pro-
posed to me a marriage with his daughter. I might
have resisted the temptation if I had never seen her;
but she is young, beautiful, fascinating. I married her,
and regained all.’”
“‘And the Lady Eugenie, I cried; “the Lady Eu-
genie?’”
“‘She is dead, replied the earl; ‘I have now ob-
tained certain information that she is dead; but I cannot
sav, he added, and he grasped my arm tightly while he

spoke, ‘I cannot say I am sure that she was dead be-
fore this second marriage was contracted; and now,
Bertha, he continued, “now swear to me, by every-
thing you hold sacred, never, till I permit you, to re-
veal to any one the fact of my former marriage; and,
if you do swear, you bind me to you for ever! I did
swear, for we both thought that she was dead; and I kept
that promise inviolably. But I asked him, before I took
any vow, if he had kept his, and preserved the proofs
of his first marriage; for, at first, I thought he wished
to entangle me by an oath, when his real wife was still
living; and I had repented enough already what I had
done against her. He told me that he had, and showed
them to me in the chamber where they were preserved;
and again he swore never to destroy them, though her
death, he said, might well free him from that promise.
But I saw then, and I have seen through his life, that he
felt, as well as I did, that there was a fate attached to
those papers which would one day change everything.
“He then brought me to the presence of his lady, to
whom he had announced my coming. When the door
opened for me to enter, and she knew who it was, she
turned towards me, as I thought, coldly and somewhat
sullenly; but the moment after she looked surprised.
She had expected to see a young and handsome girl;
but she saw a lean and sallow woman, and all doubts of
me and of her husband, if she had entertained such,
vanished. She became as kind to me as the first day
of spring, though she was often haughty and cold to
others. She trusted me in everything, and I learned to
love her well. I loved her better, far better than the
mistress I had at first served; but there was still some-
thing wanting in that latter attachment. I believe it
was the freshness of early feelings, the freshness that
never comes again. However, after I had been in Eng-
land for some ten years, and one son of the earl and
his countess had been born and died, and the second
supplied his place, being then but a sickly child himself,
I remained behind for a short time in London after they
had left the court to come down into the country. In
about ten days I followed, and, travelling slowly, stopped
one night at a little inn in the town of Stockbridge.
“It was night; and, after having supped, I went along
the passage towards my bedroom, when, as I passed a
door that was open, I he: a voice that almost made

me sink into the earth. It was that of the Lady Eugenie;
and, as I passed by the door, I looked in without wish-
ing to look, and I saw her there, sitting speaking to a
servant, pale and worn, but scarcely less beautiful than
ever. I was fool enough to faint; and, when I revived,
I found myself in her chamber, with herself and her
woman bending over me. At first I thought she did not
know me, so terribly was I changed, and so little did
she seem moved by the sight of one who had injured
her; but, when I was quite well, and thanked her in
the English tongue, and was about to leave her, she
said, ‘No, stay a moment. Leave us, Margueritte;”
and I trembled so that I could not move. The girl
went away; and then she said, ‘You are terribly al-
tered, Bertha; but I have kept you to say, that if sor-
row for anything you ever did against me be the cause-
of that sad change, console yourself. I have long ago
forgiven you. Nay, more, I have often thought I did
you some injustice.’”
“Then you positively saw the same lady with your
own eyes,” said Mr. Evelyn, “whom you had seen uni-
ted to the late earl before the death of Cromwell, ten
years after he had married another person?”
“I did,” replied Bertha. “But it is useless now to
detail all that passed between us. I found that her
brother had compelled her to assume another name, and
to spread a report of her own death. That, after her
return to France, she had borne a son; this gentleman
present, the true Earl of Danemore—”
“You mistake,” said Langford; “I was born in Eng-
land, in the very town where my father's marriage was
celebrated with my mother; for she was resolved, she
has often told me, that I should lose none of the privi-
leges of an Englishman by being born in a foreign coun-
try, and she crossed the seas to England a month before
my birth, in order that her child might first see light in
the native land of his father. I have the certificate of
my birth duly attested.”
“All that she told me,” answered Bertha; “and I meant
but to say that the child was born some months after
her husband had left her. The boy was with her then,
and I saw him; and I am ready to swear, though changed
now from a youth to a man, that this is the same per-
son. She strove eagerly to persuade me to give her
an attestation of her marriage under my hand; but I

would not do it, for I had vowed not. She asked anx-
iously after the papers, too, and if I knew whether they
had been destroyed; but I assured her that her husband
had kept his word. I told her even where they were
placed; and I assured her that, if ever fate so willed it
that the obstacles which then existed to the open estab-
lishment of her marriage should be removed—and I
felt that they would be—I assured her, I say, that I
would then aid her to the very best of my power in ob-
taining the result she wished. I promised her even
then to do all that I could, withoutbreaking my oath, to
console and comfort her; and I told her, without, how-
ever, telling her the whole truth, that her husband fully
believed her to be dead.
“We women derive comfort from strange sources
- often; and that thought, that her husband believed her
to be dead, and had acted as he had acted under that
belief, seemed to console her more than anything that
I had said. She wept bitterly, but the tears were evi-
dently sweet ones; and when we parted she made me
promise to write to her frequently, and give her news
of him whom she still dearly loved. I did write to her
frequently, and she to me; and I told her everything
that passed which could give her any pleasure to hear.
After her death her son wrote to me; and though for
some time past he has not told me his movements, yet
when I heard from accidental report that for two or
three summers a gentleman had been wandering about
the neighbourhood, attracting the attention of many by
his gracious manners and his kindly heart, I felt sure
that it was the son of Eugenie de Beaulieu, led on by the
hand of fate towards the destiny that awaited him.”
Thus Bertha ended her history, which had occupied
some time in the narration; and, when it was done, both
Langford and Sir Walter pondered for several minutes
over the tale just told. The first who broke silence was
Mr. Evelyn, who, though but a country attorney of
those days, was superior both in knowledge and in mind
to the generality of his class.
“Though undoubtedly,” he said, “there is sufficient
matter to bear us out in making a vigorous struggle to
recover your rights, my lord, yet I very much fear that,
without the documents which afford the only real legal
evidence of the marriage, we should be defeated. The
eaf has been taken so nicely out of the register that we

can draw no conclusive inference from that fact. And
yet,” he continued, as if a sudden thought struck him,
“ and yet there may be means of proving that a leaf is
really wanting. Of that, however, more hereafter; for
we cannot be at all secure without the papers.”
“Should I make up my mind,” said Langford, “to enter
into the struggle at all, I think that I shall be able ulti-
mately to obtain them; but in the mean time—”
He was interrupted, however, by the entrance of the
rector's servant, who announced that a gentleman had
just arrived demanding to speak with the Earl of Dane-
more; and, on being told that he was dead, had appear-
ed in what the man called a great taking.
“Is he gone?” demanded the rector.
“No, sir,” replied the servant. “When I told him
the earl was dead, but that there was a good many gen-
tlemen in the parlour talking the matter over, he said
that he should like to speak with them, as he had news
of great importance to communicate from Lord Harold.”
“Pray let us see him,” said Langford; and the rector,
bowing his head, told the servant to give the stranger
admittance.
CHAPTER XIV.
BEFoRE we follow any farther the proceedings, how-
ever important they might be, which were taking place
at the village of Danemore, we must return to several
of the personages concerned in this history, whom we
have now left for somewhat too long a period. In the
first place, we must give due consideration to Mr Jus-
tice Whistler, whom we last left fast asleep Whether
he dreamed at all or not, is difficult to say, but, if he
did, it is certain that his dreams must have been of
prisons and gallowses, for such were the very first
thoughts that presented themselves to his mind when he
awoke after a nap of between five and six hours.
It is pfobable, indeed, that he would not have roused
himself near so soon but for an extraordinary trampling
of horses and the sound of manifold voices, which, as-
cending from the courtyard below, caused Morpheus

quickly to flap away upon his soft wings, and leave the
worthy magistrate with his eyes and ears wide open,
wondering what could be the matter. He started from
his bed instantly, and advanced to the window, the cur-
tains of which had been drawn to keep out the sun;
and, putting forth his head above the courtyard, he per-
ceived a number of persons collected together, habited
principally like sturdy yeomen and farmers. Each had
his horse with him, and all seemed to be well armed ;
while the two constables who had followed the worthy
magistrate in his nocturnal expedition were seen in the
midst of the crowd, bustling about with a look of impor-
tance. Now Justice Whistler was a man of rapid com-
binations, and he instantly divined what was the occa-
sion of the meeting; but he was a cautious man too,
and loved to have his own conclusions confirmed by the
testimony of others. He consequently protruded his
head still farther from the window, and, catching the
attention of one of the constables, demanded, in some-
what of an impatient tone, “What is all this about,
sirrah! What are you going to do?”
“We are going to catch the thief, your worship,” re-
plied the constable; “and all these good gentlemen are
going to help us.”
“On no account, on no account,” exclaimed the Jus-
tice from the window. “What without me? I tell
you, if that fellow were hanged without my help, I would
hang myself.”
“Why we thought as how,” replied the man, “that
your worship had been so well basted already, that you
might likely not wish for any more of it.”
“Out upon you, fellow !” said the justice; “I’ll baste
you if you do not mind. Go and beg Mr. Rector, di-
rectly, to stop but for ten minutes, and I'll be ready to
go with him. If any man were to lay a hand upon that
fellow Gray before me, I should hold myself but half a
man and no gentleman. Go and tell him so, sirrah!
£o and tell him so!”
While the man proceeded to obey the commands he
had received, Mr. Justice Whistler hurried on his gar-
ments, wincing desperately every now and then, as ev.
ery sudden turn made him aware of the deficiency of
skin on some part or another of his back. At length,
however, his toilet was accomplished as far as it could
be; that is to say, his vest was put on, for neither coat

nor cloak had been left to him; and, with a rueful face,
he was obliged to descend with his sturdy arms only
decorated by the wide white sleeves of his shirt.
Guided by the sound of voices, he found his way to
the rector's parlour, and, opening the door, presented
himself to the eyes of the more select party therein as-
sembled. It consisted of three or four of the principal
farmers or small landed proprietors in the neighbour-
hood, together with the rector himself, and a young
gentleman, who instantly, by the entire difference of his
mien and demeanour from those of the persons by whom
he was surrounded, attracted the attention of the wor-
thy magistrate. He was tall and well proportioned,
though somewhat slightly made; but he was extreme-
ly pale, so much so, indeed, as to have the appearance
of ill health. He was only armed with an ordinary
sword, which might, perhaps, have befitted a country
gentleman in those days, but did not harmonize with
the striking and distinguished appearance of the person-
age who bore it. But while there was something about
the corners of the mouth which implied a certain de-
gree of indecision of character, there was a quick flash
in the eye, and lines and furrows upon the brow, that
seemed to contradict the other expression, and gave a
look of stern determination even approaching to fierce-
IneSS.
The appearance of the justice in his shirt sleeves,
joined with the account which had been previously given
of his adventures of the night before, for a moment re-
laxed the countenance of the young gentleman we have
mentioned; and, sitting by a table on which various re-
freshments were laid out, he gazed upon Justice Whis-
tler with a smile.
“My dear sir,” exclaimed the magistrate, addressing
his host, “my dear sir, how could you think of going
against this scoundrel without me? I would not have
had it done for a thousand pounds.”
“Why,” replied the rector, “we judged that your
worship was so tired and injured that it would have been
cruel to disturb your repose; and as I had yesterday
morning gone round the country, and appointed all these
worthy people to meet here, for the purpose of taking
as many as we can of this gang of villains, I could not
very well delay.”
“What! then you had determined to go against them

before I came !” cried the justice, hewing himself off a
large slice from a cold sirloin that graced the table.
“How was that, how was that? I understood they had
only been in this country some few days, and they can-
not have committed many depredations.”
“Yes; but my noble young guest here, the Lord Har-
old,” replied the rector, “only escaped from their hands
the night before last, and arrived at my house yester-
day morning. We consulted together what was to be
done, and determined on the steps we have taken.” .
“My Lord Harold !” cried the justice, “my Lord
Harold, I give your lordship good-morning, and very
happy I am to see you alive, for I can assure you we
have had many doubts on the subject; and I have had
more to do with your concerns of late than perhaps you
are aware of.”
“I am afraid my father must have suffered much
anxiety on my account,” said Lord Harold, with a some-
what cold and stately air; “but I sent off a letter yes-
terday morning, the very first moment that I had the
means of doing so, to inform him of my safety. Had
the messenger not arrived when you left that part of the
country?”
“Not that I heard of, not that I heard of, my lord,”
replied the justice. “My good lord your father, indeed,
had much anxiety; and, for the matter of that, other
people too, for there was a certain young gentleman
taken up, and accused of having murdered you. He re-
mained for several days in confinement, which seemed
to chafe his proud spirit very much.”
“Pray who was that, sir!” demanded Lord Harold.
“Why, he calls himself Captain Henry Langford,”
replied the justice; “but you may doubtless know more
of him by some other name.”
Lord Harold's brow grew as dark as night, and bright
red spots came into his cheek as he replied, “I have
heard of him, and seen him, and have also been informed
that he takes the name of the Chevalier de Beaulieu.
But perhaps you have had an opportunity of investiga-
ting more fully who he really is?”
The justice, however, saw that Lord Harold was ut-
terly unacquainted with all that had taken place during
his absence; and, as there was a great deal that he
himself could not explain clearly, while everything that
he could explain was any's but agreeable, he deter-

-
mined to leave the task to others, and was meditating
how to evade giving any reply, when the rector came
unexpectedly to his aid, by saying, “I beg pardon for
interrupting you, gentlemen; but allow me to remind
you that time wears. It is now near one o'clock. We
have fully fifteen miles or more to go, and it may be
necessary not to fatigue our horses before we arrive at
the point of our destination. By your leave, therefore,
I think we had better postpone all explanations.”
“One more cup of this excellent ale,” exclaimed the
justice, “and then I am ready. I hope the rascals have
got my horse saddled. Pray, your reverence, make in-
quiry.”
“But, my dear sir,” said the rector, “how can you
manage to go without a coat! I am afraid, too, that
none of mine would fit you, not even one of my loose
riding coats, for I am a spare man, and you are—”
“Fat! you would say,” replied the justice. “Yes, I
am fat, sir; that is to say, fattish; and how to do with-
out a coat I know not; but go I will. Is there not a
fat person in the neighbourhood that would lend me a
jerkin?”
“Why, your reverence,” said one of the farmers, who
- had hitherto stood aloof, but who now advanced towards
the rector, “there's Farmer Balls down at the Pondgate;
his coat would just do. He weighs one-and-twenty
stone at least. His coat would surely just fit his wor-
ship.”
“I could get into it at least,” said the magistrate,
“for I only weigh nineteen, so there's two stone to spare,
whish makes more difference in a coat than in a load
of hay. So run, my good sir, or send some one, and
oeg Farmer Balls to lend Justice Whistler a coat for a
few hours. Hark ye! hark ye! not his Sunday's best,
for we have dirty work to do, and there is no use of
spoiling it.”
The coat was soon procured; and Mr. Justice Whis-
tler, having mounted with the rest, set out at the head
of the procession, which consisted of nearly thirty per
sons, having Lord Harold on one side of him and the
very reverend rector on the other. The justice took
the place of leader as a sort of right, which was tacitly
conceded to him by all the rest, more out of reverence
for his portly person than from anything that they knew
of his character or abilities.

Lord Harold, however, soon began to appreciate his
ready shrewdness; for, as they moved onward at a
slow trot, he put several questions to him with regard
to their future proceedings, resolved, if he found any
occasion to be dissatisfied with the other's arrangements,
to take the matter into his own hands; for the stern
and harsh determination which he had formed in regard
to Franklin Gray had not at all given way since the
period of his escape.
The plans which the justice proposed, however; the
shrewdness with which he put all his questions regard-
ing the exact situation of the house, and the rapidity
with which he received and comprehended every ex-
planation given, soon convinced his young companion
that they could not be in better hands. It was accord-
ingly determined, that, as soon as they reached the top
of the hills at the point where they could first see the
house, the party should divide, and one body, under the
direction of the rector, should sweep round through a
hollow in the hills, while the other pursued the road by
which Lord Harold had made his escape, so as to ap-
proach the abode of Franklin Gray on both sides at once.
By this means no one could leave the house without
being seen by one or other of the parties, and the pos-
sibility of the robbers making their escape by one side
of the building, while the assailants forced their way on
the other, was guarded against. In making these ar-
rangements, and in giving directions to all the various
personages of which the troop was composed, the time
was passed till they emerged from the woods, lanes,
and cultivated grounds on the first slopes of the upland,
and began to take their way over the soft short turf,
which was only varied by the innumerable scattered
stones that covered the higher ground on that side.
Lord Harold—though it must be acknowledged that
he thought, and with bitter pleasure, more of the cap-
ture of Franklin Gray than of any other thing on earth
—had determined to pass the rest of their march, after
every arrangement had been fully made, in learning
from Mr. Justice Whistler all that had taken place du-
ring his absence from Danemore Castle, some vague
reports of extraordinary events having reached him even
there, though the news which now travels by a steam-
carriage then went by the wagon.
On putting his very first question, however, he per-

ceived that the keen, hawklike eye of the justice was
fixed upon a particular spot on the hills, over whose
soft green bosoms the sunshine and the shade were
chasing each other quickly as the wind blew the light
clouds over the sky. The effect was beautiful, but daz-
zling; yet still the justice kept his eye fixed on that
particular spot at the distance of about two miles before
them, and made no reply whatsoever to the young lord's
interrogation.
Lord Harold, who was in no very placable frame of
mind, repeated his question in a sharper tone; but the ma-
gistrate instantly exclaimed, without taking any notice
of him, “Yes, yes, I see it move : Do not you, parson?
Look ye there, up in that hollow which the shadow is
just leaving. I have been for this ten minutes trying to
determine whether that is a man on horseback or a haw-
thorn-tree. It is a man, I'm sure ! I saw it move this
minute a bit to the left, so as to get a better sight of us.”
“There is a hawthorn-tree there,” said the rector;
“I know it of old. But you are right, you are right!
There is something moving from behind it. It is a
horseman indeed, evidently watching us. See, he is
cantering up the hill. I am afraid this bodes disappoint-
ment.”
“There is another on the top of the highest mound,”
cried Justice Whistler; “they have a terrible start of
us, but never mind. We must not fear breaking our
horses’ wind. We must gallop as hard as we can go ;
and now there must be no thought of going round by
the hollow, as we proposed. The only plan is to make
#: house as fast as possible. Don't you say so, my
ord.”
“Most assuredly,” replied Lord Harold; “there are
women and children also to be moved, which must take
them some time. It cost them nearly an hour and a
half to get ready when they came hither, for I was
with them, and saw all their proceedings.”
“Set spurs to your horses, then, gentlemen!” cried
the magistrate, aloud. “Master Constable, ask some of
these good yeomen to lend me a pistol. They can
muster a brace for me among them, I dare say. Some
of them seem to have three or four.”
But, leaving the constable to bring him the weapons
afterward, he himself spurred on without any delay,
while Lord Harold and the rector accompanied him at

full speed, and the officers and farmers followed quickly,
gaining, by the rapidity of motion and the excitement
of the sort of race they ran with each other, a good
deal more courage and enthusiasm than they had prob-
ably set out with. At this eager pace they reached the
top of the hill, but were obliged to ride some little way
to the right before they could get a sight of the house.
When they did so, however, though nothing was seen of
it but the chimneys towering up above the tall trees,
every one instinctively pulled in his bridle rein with
somewhat of an awful feeling at his heart.
The house lay at the distance of about two miles and
a half; but the air was clear and pure, and every curl of
the thin blue smoke, as it rose peacefully over the trees,
might be traced by the eye till it mingled with the at-
mosphere around. After a moment's silence, the con-
stable rode up and put the pistols into Justice Whistler's
hands; but at that very instant a body of horsemen was
seen passing over the slope beyond the house, and then,
giving rein to their horses, galloped away as hard as
ever they could over the open downs beyond.
Man is certainly a beast of prey. There is an instinct
about him which prompts to run after everything that
runs away. It may be partly the dastardly tyranny of
cowardice, which gains courage to pursue and worry by
the sight of an adversary's flight; but it is chiefly, in
all probability, upon the same principle whereon a fierce
dog chases and slaughters a sheep, which is solely be-
eause the sheep runs away, and the dog, imagining that
the sheep knows its own business and his better than
himself, judges that it is both right and pleasant to run
after and verify to the utmost the victim's estimation of
his powers and his purposes.
Thus it is nine times out of ten in the world. Yield
even where you know yourself in the wrong, and your
enemies will pursue you over all fences, and destroy
you where you are on the ground of right. God forbid
that we should say, “Defend that which is wrong;” but
we do say, “Retreat so as to be able to defend yourself
whenever the dastardly hounds, who are encouraged by
your retiring, pass the bounds which they themselves
neither know nor care for, and enter the space where
you are justified in tearing them to pieces.” .
Man is undoubtedly a beast of prey; and in the pres:
ent instance, no sooner did the posse who followed the

justice, the rector, and the young nobleman, see a body
in flight before them, than those who had been most
timid and fearful of leading the way were all setting off
at full gallop in pursuit of fugitives whom there was lit-
tle or no chance of overtaking. It was with the utmost
difficulty that the fat but powerful voice of Mr. Justice
Whistler, the shriller tones of the rector, and the deep-
er but feebler sounds of Lord Harold’s voice, each ex-
erted with the utmost force, could induce these hot pur-
suers to halt and receive orders ere they departed. -
When they were at length brought to pull up their
horses, however, a few words between their three lead
ers seemed to settle their arrangements, and Mr. Jus-
tice Whistler raised his voice, exclaiming, “Constable
Jones!” -
But no one came forward, he having pronounced the
name at random, and there being no Constable Jones
among them. “The youngest constable,” he cried
again; but thereat his own two followers, with three or
four others, spurred forward from the crowd, and, fixing
upon the one who appeared the most intelligent of those
who had come with him, he said, “Take that man, and
that man, and that man, and that, and gallop after those
fellows as hard as ever you can go! Remember your
business is not to come up with them till you have got a
sufficiept force, but to raise the whole country as you
go along by the hue and cry; commanding all men, in
the king's name, to follow and assist you! Keep them
in sight as far as possible; but, at all events, keep above
them on the hills, and drive them into the populous.
country. There you may follow them by the tongue ass
well as here by the eye. Now off with ye, quick!'s We
will come soon after, when we have run through the.
house.” &
The men obeyed, though the worthy leader twice
showed an inclination to doubt whether this person or
that was the man whom the judge had appointed to fol-
low him. But Mr. Justice Whistler cut him short sharp-
ly, and, having seen him depart, turned to Lord Harold,
saying, “Now, my lord, I think with you that we had
a great deal better go down to the house, and examine
what it contains before we pursue these men, having set
our hounds upon the track. But, as this reverend gen-
tleman says nothing, and seems to think otherwise,
pray satisfy him in regard to vour reasons, to which I
will add mine."

THE ROBBER. 167
“Why,” added Lord Harold, hesitating, “why I think
—that is to say, I saw nothing but men in the party that
went away. Now there is a woman and a child, and, if
you take them, depend upon it, the chief bird of the mew
will hover near and be caught at last.”
As he spoke there was a deep and burning spot came
up into his cheek, which showed that there were feel-
ings of shame and remorse, glowing like coals of fire
at his heart, even at the moment that the baser spirit tri-
umphed, and bowed his words and actions to its will.
Mr. Justice Whistler, however, did all that he could
to make the matter smooth to him. “Spoken like a
true falconer,” he cried. “My lord, you take my trade
out of my hands. We are fully justified in bringing our
bird back to the lure. However, there is no time to
spare. Let us ride on as fast as possible;” and, so say-
ing, he put his horse into a quick pace, and, followed
by the others, dashed down the hill at a rate which
scared many of the younger and more active of the
party.
We must now, however, leave all the busy actors
we have brought upon the scene, and, leaving hounds
and huntsmen, and the gay and merry chase, turn to the
dark and solitary lair where the quarry lay, fully con-
scious of pursuit, in order to explain the motives of that
sudden flight which had been observed by the pursuera
from the hills above. .*

- THE escape of Lord Harold, and the flight of one of
their companions with the woman servant, had thrown
the little band of Franklin Gray into consernation an , ,
terror when it was discovered on the following morn-
ing. Harvey, however, who assumed the command du :
ring the absence of their leader, instantly took measures
for tracking the fugitives, and, by no other guide that,
the footmarks upon the sandy parts of the road, traced
the course of all three exactly to the spot where Lord
Harold had been left sitting under a tree by his two
companions. -

I68 THE ROBBER.
From that point all trace of those two were lost; but
a shepherd, who had seen the young nobleman, weary
and exhausted, in the morning, and had conducted him
to a small village, hidden among the beeches to the left
of the spot, gave still farther information; and leaving
men to keep a strict watch upon the place to which the
fugitive had been brought by the peasant, Harvey re-
turned, with very unpleasant sensations, to meet Frank-
lin Gray, and give him an account of the evasion of the
prisoner. He doubted not, indeed, that, having thus
tracked him to his place of repose, they might be able
to lay hands on him again; for he never calculated upon
the young nobleman doing what, in fact, he already had
done, taking a single hour's repose, and then speeding
on as fast as possible to the house of the nearest ma-
gistrate, which was that of the gentleman with whom
he was found by Justice Whistler.
As Harvey returned, he perceived Franklin Gray and
Mona riding leisurely up the hill towards the house,
and, spurring forward at once, he told the whole of his
disagreeable tidings without any concealment. The
robber instantly turned his eyes upon his wife, and bit
his lip hard; while she, innocent of all share in what
had occurred, but feeling herself for the first time an ob-
ject of suspicion and jealousy, turned very red, and then
very pale, and trembled violently.
“So I am betrayed !” said Franklin Gray, “betrayed
by those I trusted! Harvey, I think you are faithful to
me!”
“Indeed I am, captain,” replied the other; “and so
are all the rest, except that fellow who is gone, and
whom I always thought was a low scoundrel, unfit for
the company of gentlemen. They are all faithful to
you, captain, depend upon it.”
“On what can we depend?” asked Franklin Gray,
bitterly; “on what can we depend in life? Friendship
turns to hate; love betrays us always, gratitude was
never anything but a name; and honour is now a
shadow ! On what can we depend? Let us come in,
however, and consult what may be done., Action has
been through life the principle of my being; and I will
not yield to circumstances even now.”
So saying, he led the way to the house; but he said
not one word to his wife, either as they went or when
they arrived." The boy Jocelyn, however, was in the

courtyard, holding the infant in his arms, who seemed
well pleased with his new nurse. But Mona, the mo-
ment she had set her foot to the ground, sprang for-
ward and caught the baby to her heart, exclaiming,
“And did she leave you, my sweet babe? Cruel, cruel
woman She never had one, or she could not have
left you;” and, dewing its smiling face with tears, she
ran away with it into the house to hide the emotions
she could not restrain.
Had Franklin Gray seen that meeting between moth-
er and child, the dark suspicions that had fully taken
possession of his mind might have been banished at
once; but he was talking with Harvey at the moment,
and remembered nothing but the many whispered mes-
sages which he had seen brought by the maid from the
prisoner above on the preceding day; and keen and bit-
ter were the feelings at his heart. He went on speak-
ing with Harvey, however, as if occupied with ordinary
business.
“If he have not left the village before this time,” he
said, “he will most likely not leave it till night, know-
ing that we shall be waiting for him. But, at all events,
the horses must have some rest and food. I rather think
that, as far as ensuring our own safety goes, Harvey,
we might as well let him journey on his way, for, de-
pend upon it, by this time he has given full information
of everything concerning us to the people where he
has stopped. However, I am determined, if possible,
to have him in my hands again. In the first place, in
order to punish him for what he has done; in the next
place, to find out the truth of some matters in regard to
which I am not at ease.”
He spoke calmly; there was no heat, nor haste, nor
agitation in his tone. On the contrary, it was unusu-
ally slow and distinct; but there was a knitting of the
dark heavy brow, a setting together of the white teeth
between every two or three words, which made Har-
vey, bold man and daring as he was, shrink, as it were,
within himself, at signs of deep and terrible passions,
the effects of which he knew too well.
“Perhaps,” continued Franklin Gray, in an easier
tone, “the possession of this young lord's person might
be made, too, a sort of surety for the safety of the band.
There is a ship, I find, sails for the port of St. Malo in
four days; and I have made such arrangements that I

can have what space in her I like. I should wish our
brave fellows to keep around me till that time; then
those that like to go with me can ; those that love this
cold land can remain. But, if we get hold of this pitiful
boy, I shall deal with him as a hostage, and make his
life the price of no step whatsoever being taken against
me and mine.” * -
With such objects in view, and believing that Lord
Harold still remained at the village to which Harvey
had traced him, the arrangements of Franklin Gray
were soon made for proceeding in a few hours to the
spot in person. In the mean while he entered the house,
and held his infant child for several minutes in his arms,
gazing on its face in silence. He gazed, too, for an in-
stant upon his beautiful wife, with a cold, meditative
look, and without proffering a word; then gave her
back the child and walked out across the hill, marking
with a soldier's eye every peculiarity of the country
when he did look upon it, but, in general, bending his
eyes down upon the ground, and communing with his
own sad heart, and muttering to himself as he strode
along.
When the appointed hour came, he was in the court-
yard and his foot in the stirrup; but his after proceed-
ings on that night require no long detail. Some infor-
mation which he gathered, both from the men whom
Harvey had left to observe all the movements in the
village, and from some persons who passed, led him not
only to believe that Lord Harold was undoubtedly there,
but that the young nobleman had gained tidings of the
close watch that was kept upon the place. The night
was spent in watching, and in vague councils held with
Harvey and others, in the course of which Franklin
Gray did not display that firm decision which had ever
previously characterized his actions. He now thought
of taking the rashest and the boldest steps; of attack-
ing the village itself, and carrying off Lord Harold by
force; then, again, he seemed inclined still to watch,
though the night had so far waned that it was improba-
ble any movement would take place; and then again he
was for giving up the pursuit altogether.
In such infirm purposes passed the night, till the sound . .
of horses’ feet revived expectation; and the appearance
and flagellation of Mr. Justice Whistler afforded a pleas-
ant episode for the robbers to break the tedium of their ,
*

THE ROBBER. 171
dull night's work. As soon as that was over, Franklin
Gray turned his steps homeward again; but feeling a
conviction that the peasantry of the neighbouring dis-
tricts would soon be moved against him, he took the
precaution of placing two of his band, whose horses
were in the freshest condition, on two points, where
they could communicate by signs with each other, and
see over the whole country below.
He then returned straight to his dwelling; but there
had come a recklessness over him, a sort of moody and
splenetic demeanour, which was remarked by Harvey
and all his companions. He who usually laughed so
seldom now recalled the affair of Justice Whistler more
than once with somewhat wild and fitful merriment;
but then, the moment after, he would fall into deep,
stern thought, answer any question that was put to him
in an absent if not in an incoherent manner, and would
frequently break forth at once upon topics totally dis-
tinct from those which might naturally have occupied
his mind.
When he arrived at home—at least at that tempo-
rary kind of home which was all that his wandering life
ever allowed him to know—he was met at the door by
his fair wife Mona, who gazed timidly up in his face to
see whether his feelings were softer or happier than
they had been. It was an agreeable surprise to her to
find that he took her by the hand, and gazed on her
with a look of admiration and love. The only words
he spoke, however, were, “You are fair, my Mona;
fairer, I think, than ever to look upon. Where is the
babe?” -
She led him to see the child sleeping; and as Frank-
lin Gray bent over it, and gazed upon the calm and
placid face of infant slumber, a bright drop fell from his
eyes on the cheek of the child, and woke it from its
rest. It held out its little arms to him at Once, how-
ever; and taking it up, and pressing it to his bosom, he
carried it to the window, and gazed forth upon the wide
world beyond. Mona had seen the drops which fell from
her husband's eyes, and she saw, too, his action towards
the child, but she would not interrupt the course of such
feelings for the world; and only saying in her heart,
“He is softened,” she hastened to seek some apparent
occupation, while her soul was busy with the joy of re-
newed hopes.

172 THE ROBBER.
That joy was soon clouded, for again over Franklin
Gray came that same fitful mood, which tenderness for
his child had for a moment interrupted. He said no-
thing harsh, indeed; he showed no sign of unkindness;
and no word announced that the dark suspicions and
jealousies which he had before entertained still remained
as tenants of his bosom. Often, indeed, he fell into
deep, stern fits of thought, and would rest for more than
half an hour in the same position, with his head bent
forward, and his eyes fixed on one particular spot of
the ground. Then, again, he would start up, and es-
pecially, if he found Mona's eye resting upon him, would
break forth in gayety and merriment, tell some wild
tale of laughable adventure, or sing a broken part of
some cheerful song.
Mona, however, was not to be deceived by such signs,
and they were all painful to her. That he whom she
had never known to be merry, even in his brightest
days, should so suddenly, after deep gloom, break forth
into gayety, was quite enough to show her that all was
not well within; and, watching him with the anxious
eye of deep affection, she strove to do and say all that
could sooth and calm, and console and cheer him.
Sometimes her efforts would seem successful, some-
times not. Sometimes he would gaze upon her with
looks of deep and earnest love, sometimes would start
away when her hand touched his as if it had been a
serpent. All and everything she saw was matter of
deep pain and anxious thought to Mona Gray.
When the hour of dinner came she strove to tempt
him to his food, but he would scarce taste anything ex-
cept wine, and of that drank more than usual. It
seemed not to excite, however, but rather to calm him.
His manner grew more consistent; sadder, but more
tranquil; and, leaving his companions still at the table,
he led his wife away to the chambers they usually in-
habited, and sat down and spoke with her rationally on
many things. There was an occasional abruptness in-
deed in his speech, and a rapid transition from one
thing to another, which still alarmed her, but she con-
soled herself with the hope that the fit was passing
away, and that all would be better soon. ... .
At length he said, “Come, Mona, come! While I
take the child upon my knee, you sing me a song. Who
knows if I shall ever hear another?” *

THE ROBBER 173
Though her heart was sad, she made no reply, but
hastened to obey; and she chose such words and such
an air as she thought most likely to sooth him. Both
were sad, but through both there ran the bright glim-
mering of hope, a cheerful note every now and then
mingled with the more melancholy ones, and promises
of future happiness blended with the sadder words of
the lay.
The music still trembled in the air when Harvey sud-
denly entered the room, and, approaching his captain,
whispered a word or two in his ear. Franklin Gray
tnstantly started up, with the dark cloud upon his brow
which usually gathered there in moments of determined
action.
“The time is come,” he exclaimed; “the time is
come! Harvey, I will come and speak with you and
the rest. Mona, take the child. I will be back with
you in a few minutes.”
He then followed Harvey out of the room; and from
that moment his whole demeanour was calm, collected,
and firm. “Have all the horses saddled, quick,” he
said; “each man collect everything valuable that he
has. Each man, too, have his arms all ready for action
at a moment's notice | Did you say, Harvey, that they
had both come over the hill?”
“No, only one,” replied Harvey; “but he came at
such speed that there can be no doubt the other will
soon follow. We shall doubtless have to stand to our
arms soon, captain, I suppose?” And, as he spoke, his
cheek was a little paler than ordinary; but there is such
a thing as the emotion of strong resolution, and it may
blanch the cheek, though in a slighter degree than fear.
“Perhaps so, Harvey,” answered Franklin Gray;
“but we shall hear;” and, as he spoke, he advanced to
the window which looked up the hill; and having satis-
fied himself by one glance, he turned back to Harvey,
saying, “The other is coming too. We shall know
more anon.”
. The first of his watchers, who had been left on the
other side of the hills, had by this time nearly reached
the house, and in a minute or two after he entered the
room where Franklin Gray and Harvey, with the rest
of the band who were not occupied in preparations,
waited his report. “Well,” said the captain, as he en-
tered, “what news, Miles?” -

“Why, I am afraid they are coming up in great force,
captain,” he answered; “I could only see them draw
out from the end of the lane upon the hillside, but there
seemed a good many of them. I did not move a step,
however, till I saw Doveton begin to canter away, then
I thought it right to come on and give you the first ti-
dings. He will be here soon, and render you a clearer
account.”
“You did quite right,” replied his leader. “If we
had all to deal with such as you, my man, we should
do very well.” The man looked gratified; but Frank-
lin Gray went on, “Come, Harvey, we will go out into
the court. We shall be nearer the scene of action,”
and he walked deliberately out into the courtyard,
where the horses were now all brought out and ranged
in line.
“Mount, my men!” he cried, “mount! We shall soon
have Doveton here. Miles, that pistol will fall out of
your holster. Don’t you see the lock has caught on
the leather? You hold my horse, Jocelyn ! Harvey,”
he continued, speaking to the man apart, and pointing
to the boy, “do you think, if we were obliged to make
the best of our way off, and this youth were left behind
—this mere child, as you see he is—they would injure

“Oh, no,” replied Harvey, “certainly not. They
might take him away, but we could soon find means to
get him out of their hands again.”

he can come;” and, in a minute or two more, the mar:
he spoke of rode into the courtyard, with his horse al!
foaming from the speed at which he had come.
“I am glad to see you are ready, captain,” he ex-
claimed; “for, depend upon it, we shall have sharp work
of it. There must be at the lowest count forty of them
coming up the hill, and all seemingly well mounted and
armed, for I looked at them through the spyglass you
gave me, and I could see them all as plainly as if they
were at the other end of the table.” " .
Franklin Gray mused for a moment, and then de-
manded, “Could you see who it was that led them on t”
“Why there were three rode abreast,” said the man,
“ and I could see them all plainly enough. The one
on the left was a man in a black cassock; but I don’t

hink I ever saw him before. The middle one was a
at, heavy man, who, I rather think, is the justice that
we flogged last night; only in the darkness then I didn’t
well remark his face. But the third one, on the right
hand, is certainly that lord you had up here for so long,
that Lord Harold.”
The cloud grew doubly dark upon Franklin Gray's
brow, and, putting his hand to his throat, he loosened the
laced collar of his shirt. “Fully forty men, you say?”
he demanded, thoughtfully. But then added, without
waiting for reply, “Harvey, you are not mounted !
Quick, quick, into the saddle ! Miles and Doveton, put
yourselves upon the left. Now, Harvey, mark well
-what I have to tell you! Lead those men out, and take
at full gallop across the hill to the right. If you keep
Elsland Peak always a little to the left, you will come
to a hollow ; and if you ride up it as fast as you can go,
long before any one can overtake you, for their horses
are not used to this work like ours, you will have
reached a spot where the slope divides the hollow into
four, and all four lead away to the beech wood, where
you may disperse and set chase at defiance. Arrange
your plans among yourselves as you go; and now lose
not a moment, for they must be over the hills by this
time.”
“But yourself, captain,” asked Harvey, anxiously;
“yourself, and the lady, and the little child. I will
never go and leave you here alone.”
“Do not be afraid, Harvey,” replied Franklin Gray,
with a stern smile : “I will take care of them and my-
self, depend upon it!”
“But I do not like this plan at all,” cried the man.
“What ' to run away and leave my captain behind me,
at the mercy of these fellows that are coming up ! I
do not like it at all, Captain Gray. This will never do.”
“You surely would not disobey me in a moment of
danger and difficulty like this!” said Franklin Gray.
“No, no, Harvey, you are too good a soldier for that!
But, to satisfy you, you shall see that I provide in some
degree for my own safety. Jocelyn, take my horse
down into the narrow part between those two sheds,
and hold him there, whatever you see or hear, till I
come to you. In the first place, however, open those
two other gates at the bottom of the court, and, when
you are holding the horse, keep as far back as possible,

that nobody may see you! Now, Harvey,” he added,
“you see and are satisfied. Lead the men out as I
have commanded. I trust their safety to you!”
Harvey looked down and bit his lip, hesitating evi
dently for a moment as to whether he should obey or
not. At length he looked steadfastly in Franklin Gray's
face, and held out his hand to him, with a melancholy
shake of the head.
“God bless you, Captain Gray,” he said; “I obey
you even in this; but I am very much afraid that you
are not quite right in your plans. I am afraid, I say,
that you are acting under a wrong view; and I wish to
God you would think of it before it is too late. Well,
well, I will go. God bless you, I say. Come, my men,
let us march;" and, so saying, he led them all out of
the courtyard.
Franklin Gray saw them depart with stern, unmoved
composure; then advanced to the gate himself, and,
while their horses were heard at the full gallop pro-
ceeding in the direction which he had pointed out, he
himself gazed up towards the other part of the hills, and
saw a strong party of horsemen crowning some of the
summits. He then spoke another word or two to the
boy Jocelyn, returned into the room where he had con-
ferred with Harvey, and paused, with his arms folded
on his chest, pondering gloomily for about a minute.
His next act was to cast himself into a chair, and
cover his eyes with his hands, while his lip might be
seen quivering with intense and agonizing emotion. It
lasted scarcely a minute more, however, and, rising up,
he struck his hand upon the table, saying, “Yes, yes, it
shall be so !”
He then took a brace of pistols from the shelf, loaded
them carefully, and placed them in his belt; after which
he proceeded to a closet wherein were deposited several
other weapons of the same kind; chose out two with
much deliberation, looked at them closely with a bitter
and ghastly smile; and, having done so, and loaded
them also, he locked the door of the house, and returned
to the room where he had left his wife.
The same dark smile was upon his countenance still;
but he said as he entered, “I have been away from you
long, fair lady, but it was business of importance called
me. Now we will have another song, but it shall be a
gayer one than the last.” .

THE ROBBER. 177
Mona sang, but it was still a sad strain that she chose ;
and Franklin Gray, with his head bent down and his ear
inclined towards her, listened attentively to every note.
When it was done he caught her to his breast, and
kissed her repeatedly, saying, “They are very sweet.
Is there no poison in them, Mona 4”
“None! None! Franklin,” she replied. “If any
poison have reached your heart, it has not been from
Mona's lips.”
Franklin Gray turned away and muttered something
to himself, but Mona did not hear that the words were
“Would that it were so !”
“Play upon the lute,” he continued, sharply; “let us
have the sound of that too;” and again she did as he
bade her, though by this time there was a sound of
heavy blows, as if given by a hammer below, together
with the trampling of horses’ feet, and voices speaking.
“Those men are making so much noise I can scarcely
play,” at length she said, “and the poor baby is fright-
ened by it. See, he is going to cry.”
“Play, play,” said Franklin Gray, soothing the child
with his hand as it sat close to his feet; and Mona
tgain, though with a trembling hand and anxious heart,
struck the chords of the instrument. At that moment,
mowever, there was the rush of many feet along the pas-
sage; and the next, the door of the chamber flew open,
end seven or eight persons rushed in.
Though Mona had not remarked it, Franklin had
drawn some of the benches and tables across the room
when he first entered in such a manner as to form a
sort of barricade; and the moment the door burst open
he started upon his feet, and levelled a pistol towards
it, exclaiming, “Stand!” in a voice that shook the room.
The first face that presented itself was that of Lord
Harold; and, though his nerves were not easily shaken,
yet the tone and gesture of Franklin Gray caused him
to pause for an instant, of which the robber at once
took advantage.
“Lord Harold,” he exclaimed, “you have come to
see your handiwork and to receive its punishment. I
saved your life. You taught my wife to betray me.”
“Never, never!” shfieked Mona, falling on her knees
before him. t
“Never?” exclaimed Franklin Gray. “False wo-
tman! did you think I could not see! Lo! pitiful boy,

I78 * THE RoBBER.
here it: 'cur handiwork, and here your punishment!”
and, turning the pistol at once towards her, he discharged
the contents into her bosom. She fell back with a loud
shriek, and Lord Harold in an instant sprang across the
barrier; but, ere he could take a step beyond it, a sec-
ond pistol was aimed at his head, and fired by that un-
erring hand, which seemed only to gain additional
steadiness in moments of agitation or of agony. Bound-
ing up like a deer from the ground, the young nobleman
was cast back by the force of the shot at once upon the
table over which he had leaped. He never moved again;
there was an aguish quivering of the limbs, and a con-
vulsive contraction of the hand, indeed; but, as in the
case of Wiley, the shot had gone straight into the brain,
and consciousness, and thought, and sensation were in-
stantly at an end for ever.
The rest of the robber's assailants shrunk back with
terror; and Franklin Gray, with a fierce, triumphant
smile, gazed at them for an instant. While casting
down the weapons he had used to such fatal purpose
on the ground, he drew a third from his belt, and ex
claimed aloud, “Who will be the next?”
Borne back by the fears and pressure of his compan-
ions, with great difficulty Justice Whistler struggled
through the doorway into the room again, but he did so
with a bold and undismayed countenance, and, pistol
in hand, advanced towards the robber. But an object
had attracted the attention of Franklin Gray, and he
was bending down towards the floor. -
The infant, the poor infant, had crawled towards its
mother, and the fair small hands were dabbled in her
blood. The robber snatched the child up to his bosom,
and giving one fierce glance towards the only one who
remained to assail him, he exclaimed, “Fool, you are
not worth the shot;” and, thrusting the pistol into his
belt again, he sprang towards the window, which was
wide open.
Though embarrassed with the child, he had passed
through in a moment, but not before Justice Whistler,
shouting loudly, “He will escape! He will escape 1"
had pulled the trigger of his pistol at him with a steady
aim. Loaded, however, by hands unused to such occu-
pations, it merely flashed in the pan; and though he in-
stantly drew forth the second and fired, it was too late;

THE RoBBER. * 179
Franklin Gray had passed, and was dropping down to
the ground below. -
“Stop him! Stop him "exclaimed the justice, spring-
ing to the window, and overturning chairs and tables in
his way. “He will escape! He will escape! Stop
him below there ! Run down, you cowardly rascals'
Run down, and pursue him in every direction | By —,
the fellow will escape after all!” And, after gazing for
a single instant from the window, he rushed out of the
TOOI11.
On the side where Franklin Gray sprang to the ground
there was not one of the party who had come to take
him, all, except those who had entered the house and
Hearned the contrary, believing that he had fled with the
rest whom they had seen traversing the hills, and all
being busy in examining the robber's abode, the courts,
the stabling, the harness that had been left behind, with
open-mouthed curiosity.
The voice of the justice, indeed, called one stout
farmer round, and he instantly attempted to seize the
stranger, whom he saw hurrying forward towards some
sheds at the other end of the building; but, though a
burly and a powerful yeoman, one quick blow from the
robber's hand laid him prostrate on the earth, and,
springing past him, Franklin Gray reached the spot
where his horse was held.
The boy Jocelyn had managed skilfully, constantly
avoiding the side from which a sound of voices came.
But now the quick and well-known step called him forth
in a moment; the fiery horse was held tight with one
hand, the stirrup with the other; and by the time Jus-
tice Whistler, with the troop that followed him, came
rushing forth from the door, Franklin Gray was in the
saddle; and, still bearing the child in his arms, he stuck”
his spurs into the horse's sides, and galloped through
the gates. -
Two of the farmers, who had remained on horseback
without, had seen him mount, but, not knowing who he
was, had not attempted to interrupt him. The appear-
ance of their companions in pursuit, however, instantly
undeceived them, and they spurred after at full speed.
On went the gallant charger of Franklin Gray, however,
faster than they could follow ; and when they had kept
up the race, at about ":y yards behind him, for
R.

nearly a quarter of a mile, the one nearest exclaimed
aloud, “I will shoot his horse.”
The words must have reached the robber's ear; for
instantly his charger slackened its pace, and the pursuer
gained upon him a little; but then Franklin Gray turned
in the saddle, and, with the bridle in his teeth, stretched
out his right hand towards him. Next came a flash, a
report, and the farmer tumbled headlong from the sad-
dle severely wounded, while Franklin Gray pursued his
course with redoubled speed.
Almost all the rest of the party who had come to take
him were now mounted and in full pursuit; but his great-
est danger was not from them. A little above him on
the hill, and nearly at the same distance from the house
where he had dwelt as himself, were seen, when he had
gone about a mile, several of the party who had been
sent to follow his band. The sight of a horseman in
full flight, and many others pursuing, as well as the
gestures and shouts of those below, made them in-
stantly turn and endeavour to cut him off. On that
side, as he was obliged to turn to avoid both the par-
ties, the pursuers gained upon him, and, as if by mutual
consent, they now strained every nerve to hem him in.
There was, about half a mile farther on, a chasm
caused by a deep narrow lane, between banks of twenty
or thirty feet deep, descending from the top of the hills;
and those above him on the slope having already passed
it once that morning, strove to drive him towards it,
their only fear being lest those below should not act on
the same plan. Franklin Gray himself, however, took
exactly the course they wished, and as, bearing down
from above, they came nearer and nearer to him, they
aughed to see him approach at full speed a barrier
which must inevitably stop him. They urged their
horses rapidly on, however, lest he should find some
path down the bank into the lane; and nearer and nearer
they came to him as he bore somewhat up towards
them. They were within fifty yards of him when he
reached the bank, and so furious was his speed that all
expected to see him go over headlong.
But no ! The bridle was thrown loose, the spur
touched the horse's flank, and with one eager bound the
|aliant beast cleared the space between; and though
is hind feet, in reaching the other side, broke down
the top of the bank, and cast the sand and gravel furi-

ously into the lane below, he stumbled not, he paused
not, but bounded on, while the rashest horseman of the
party pulled in his rein, and gazed with fear at the aw-
ful leap that had just been taken. A part is still pointed
out on those hills where the top of the bank above the
lane exhibits a large gap, the spot is still called the Rob-
ber's Leap to the present day.
Every one, as we have said, drew in their horses, and
some rode up and down, seeking for a passage down into
the lane; but, in the mean while, Franklin Gray was
every moment getting farther and farther out of reach
of pursuit.
When Justice Whistler, who came up as fast as his
horse would bear him, arrived upon the spot, he saw at
once it was too late to pursue the fugitive any farther,
and he exclaimed, “Give it up, my masters, give it up;
he has escaped us for the present, but we shall get hold
of him by-and-by. A man who gets into a scrape like this
never gets out of it without a rope round his neck. Let
us return to the house, and conclude our examinations
there; though a terrible day's work it has been, for, if
my eyes served me right in the hurry, there is that poor
young gentleman as dead as a stone, and the woman,
who seemed a beautiful creature, too, no better.”
Thus saying, he turned round and rode back towards
the house; while those who followed, and who had not
been present at the events which had taken place within
the building, eagerly questioned such as had beheld the
fearful scene. While they listened to the details, mag-
nified as they might be, perhaps, by fear and the love of
the marvellous, a gloomy feeling of awe fell over the
whole party; and they gazed up towards the house as .
they approached it with ~sensations which made the
blood creep slowly through their hearts.
Such feelings were not diminished by the sight of
their wounded companion, who had received Franklin
Gray's fire in the pursuit, and who was still lying on the
ground, supported by one of his friends who had re-
mained behind, and bleeding profusely from the right
breast Several alighted and aided to carry him towards
the house; while Justice Whistler and one or two others
rode on, and proceeded at once to the room where they
had first found the robber.
There were sounds of many voices within, for six or
seven of the party had remained behind, together with

182 THE ROBBER.
the good village rector, Dr. Sandon; and, when the jus-
tice entered the room, he found it occupied by three
groups, the nearest of which consisted of two or three
farmers, gathered round the head of the table, and ga-
zing curiously at the object which it supported. A lit-
tle farther on was one of the constables, holding firmly
by the collar the fair curly-headed boy called Jocelyn;
while still farther on was the rector, kneeling on the
ground, and surrounded by the rest of the farmers and .
yeomen.
The magistrate advanced direct to the table, and saw
that the object of the farmers’ contemplation was the
dead body of the unhappy Lord Harold, which was now
stretched out, with the limbs composed and stiffening into
the rigidity of death. Too much accustomed to such
sights to be strongly affected by them, the justice passed
on, shaking his finger at the boy Jocelyn, and saying,
“Ah, you little varlet, I shall deal with you by-and-by.”
“He’s a funny little rascal, your worship,” said the
constable. “He ran up the hill so fast that nobody
could catch him till he got to a place where he could
see the whole chase, and there he stood, and let him-
self be taken as quietly as a lamb, though I told him he
would be hanged to a certainty.”
The justice looked in the boy's face, and saw the
tears streaming down from his eyes. One of the re-
deeming qualities of Mr. Justice Whistler was his love
for children; and the boy's affliction toughed him.
“Poh! poh! you foolish lad,” he cried, “they'll not
hang such a child as you. Whip the devil out of you,
perhaps; but don't cry for that.”
“I’m crying for my poor mistress,” said the boy; and
the justice then advanced in the direction towards which
Jocelyn's eyes were turned, pushing two of the farmers
out of his way who obstructed his view of what was
taking place. He found that Mr. Sandon was kneeling
by the side of Mona Gray, and supporting her lovely
head upon his arm. Her face was deadly pale, her lips
blanched, her eyes closed, and the long black lashes
resting upon that fair cheek; while the dark hair, bro-
ken from the bands that had confined it, hung in glossy
confusion to the ground. The blood which had been
flowing from a wound in her bosom was now stanched;
and the clergyman, sprinkling cold water in her face,
was at that moment endeavouring to bring her back to

life; but the countenance was so like that of a corpse
that the magistrate immediately demanded, “Is she not
dead 12”
“No, no,” said the clergyman, in a low voice. “Don’t
you see she breathes, and she has twice opened her
eyes.”
In a moment or two after she unclosed them again;
but those bright and lustrous eyes were dimmed with
the gray shadows of approaching dissolution. She
feebly lifted her hand, and, putting it to her bosom, drew
forth a small crucifix of gold, which she pressed earn-
estly to her lips. New strength seemed to be acquired
by the very effort; and, gazing wildly round her on the
strange faces that filled the room, she made an effort to
speak. At first no sóund was heard; but the next mo-
ment she distinctly uttered the words, “Is he safe? Has
he escaped?”
The boy Jocelyn caught the sounds; burst away from
the constables that held him; broke through those that
stood around, and cast himself down on his knees be-
side her. “Yes, Mona, yes,” he cried, “he is safe ! He
has escaped! I saw him leap the gap myself, and none
was brave enough to follow him. He is safe, and the
baby too !”.
Mona Gray raised her eyes, as if seeking the heaven
to pour out her thankfulness; but the next moment, by
another great effort, she said, “Jocelyn, if ever you see
him again, tell him that Mona did not betray him in deed,
or word, or thought. Tell him it was her last assever-
ation.”
As she spoke she pressed the crucifix again to her
lips, and then murmured forth some sounds in a lan-
guage that was not understood by any one present. She
then closed her eyes, but still, from time to time, ut-
tered a few words in the same tongue and in a low tone.
At length they ceased. The hand that held the cru-
cifix to her lips sunk a little lower on her bosom; the
other dropped motionless by her side; there was a slight
gasp, and a shudder, but neither groan nor cry, and the
breath stopped for ever.
Several moments elapsed before any voice broke the
deep silence which that sight had produced; and the
first words that were spoken were by the clergyman,
who said, “God have mercy upon her.”
She was then carried into the room beyond, and laid

upon her own bed; and Justice Whistler, returning
despatched messengers to the next town to summon the
coroner with all speed. -
His design, however, of apprehending Franklin Gray
was by no means abandoned; and he endeavoured, skil-
fully enough, to make use of the simplicity of the boy
Jocelyn for that purpose. After talking with him for
some time in rather a kindly tone, yet asking him a
great many questions in regard to his connexion with
the robbers, and attempting apparently to ascertain
whether the boy had taken any share in their exploits,
he said at length, “Well, my good boy, since such is
the case, and you had nothing to do with them but merely
minding your master's horse and the commands of the
lady, you are pretty clear of the business; and, indeed,
I do not know what to do with you, so you had better
go home to your friends, if you've got any.”
“I would rather go with you, sir,” said the boy, “if
you would take me with you. You seem good-natured,
and I should like to serve such a gentleman as you; and,
if you did not choose to keep me on, I could serve you
along the road.”
The suspicions of the justice were excited, and he
asked, “Why, which way do you suppose I am going,
my man?” And then added, keeping his eyes fixed
upon the boy's face, “I am not going back over the
hills; I am going on to the town of —— to seek out
this master of yours.”
The boy's countenance appeared to fall; and Mr.
Justice Whistler, convinced by what he saw that Frank-
lin Gray had most likely taken his way back over the
hills, and that the boy knew it, left him in the hands of
the farmers, and took the constable aside.
“Keep an eye upon the youth,” he said. “Don’t
seem to restrain him at all; and if he says he will go
back to his friends, let him go, but watch every step
that he takes. If he says, however, that he will go
with me, look to him well every step of the way; for I
judge by his manner that he knows his master has gone
over the hills, and wishes to be carried back with us for
the purpose of rejoining him.”
The man promised to obey punctually; and the jus-
tice, returning to the boy, spoke to him once more, as
if in passing, saying, “Well, my good boy, you shall
do just as you like Upon second thoughts, I am going
*

THE ROBBER. 185
back to Moorhurst and Uppington, and you can either
go away by yourself and find out your friends, or you
can come with me, and I'll feed you well by the way.
Think about it, and let Master Constable know.”
The boy's face brightened in a moment, and he said
at once, “Oh, I will go with you.”
There was much to be done, however, before the jus-
tice could set out, and it was nearly dark ere, leaving
the scene of so many sad and horrible events in the
hands of the officers of the county, he took his way
back over the hills with the reverend gentleman, who
once more invited him kindly to his house.
All the farmers accompanied them, no one choosing
to separate from the rest at that hour, with the knowl-
edge that Franklin Gray and his band were free, and
in the vicinity. The boy Jocelyn, mounted behind the
constable, was carefully watched, but he showed not
the slightest inclination to escape, and, when he arrived
at the parsonage, ate a hearty supper in the kitchen, and
fell asleep by the fireside.
He was roused about eleven o'clock to accompany
the constable to a garret chamber which had been pre-
pared for them, and in five minutes he was asleep again:
but when his companion woke, an hour or two after
daylight on the following morning, no Jocelyn was to
be found, though the door was still locked, and the
room was in the third story. There were found, in-
deed, the window partly open; the traces of small feet
along a leaden gutter; the branch of a tall elm, which
rested against one corner of the house, cracked through,
but not completely broken; and the fragments of glass
at the top of the wall neatly and carefully pounded into
powder with a large stone.
These were the only traces of the boy's flight that
could be discovered; but these were quite sufficient for
Mr. Justice Whistler; and, after chiding the constable
severely for sleeping so soundly, he turned to the cler-
gyman, saying, “It is very evident that this man is still
in the neighbourhood, and is on this side of the hills.
Let me beg you, my good sir, to keep a good watch in
every direction till I come back, which will be to-morrow
evening. I think it better, now, to go on myself, in
order to see old Lord Damemore, who lies dangerously
ill, and to break to him the news of his son's death,
which, if I judge rightly, may, at the present moment,

be a matter of the greatest importance to him and many
others.”
The justice breakfasted, and then proceeded on his
journey.
CHAPTER XVI.
WE must now return to the conversation which was
going on at the Rectory of Danemore between Mr.
Evelyn, Sir Walter Herbert, and him whom we shall still
call Henry Langford, in the fear that he should never
establish his claim to any higher title; and the reader
need scarcely be told that the interruption which took
place therein was occasioned by the arrival of Mr. Jus-
tice Whistler, bearing with him the sad account of all
that had occurred in consequence of the expedition
which he himself led against Franklin Gray.
Putting down his hat upon the table, the feather-band
of which was dripping with some rain which had now
begun to fall, he declared that he believed such events
had never happened before in any civilized country;
and he related, with no inconsiderable degree of real
feeling, the death of poor Mona Gray. For a time sen-
sations of awe, and grief, and astonishment suspended
every other feeling in the bosoms of his hearers; but
he himself, who had cast off the first impression under
the influence of a good night's rest and a long heavy
ride, recalled the rest of the party to other thoughts by
making Langford a low bow, and saying, “Under ex-
isting circumstances, I suppose I may congratulate you,
sir, upon your undisputed succession to the title of the
Earl of Danemore.”
Langford replied that he certainly intended at once
to assume that title, though he believed it would not be
undisputed; and Mr. Evelyn, who had a great inclina-
tion for doing business under all circumstances, imme-
diately proceeded to take into consideration the change
which the news that they had just received might pro-
duce in Langford's position. Judging that it might be
as well to engage the acuteness of Mr. Justice Whistler
in their service, at least as far as seeking for the lost

THE ROBBER. 187
papers was concerned, he opened the matter to that
respectable magistrate, and held out to him such cogent
inducements for exerting himself to the utmost in the
business in hand, that the justice, though he represented
the importance and necessity of his presence in London,
agreed to leave all business there to his colleagues, and
devote himself to the object in view.
Langford heard this arrangement without saying any-
thing, and without giving any encouragement to Mr.
Justice Whistler to remain; for, in truth, he had his
own views upon the subject, and had already deter-
mined what course to pursue, feeling perfectly sure that
the lost papers were in the possession of Franklin Gray,
and that any efforts of Mr. Justice Whistler for the re-
covery of those papers would retard, if not utterly pre-
vent, the attainment of their object.
He took care, therefore, to give no hint, either of his
own purposes or his suspicions as to the hands into
which the papers had fallen, but at once turned to
another part of the subject, saying, “In the first place,
Mr. Evelyn, as it is my full intention to deal openly and
straightforwardly in this business altogether, I think it
may be necessary immediately to send a note to Sir
Henry Heywood, informing him of the terrible fate
which has befallen my unhappy brother, and begging to
meet him here, to confer more fully on the subject to- -
morrow morning.”
The note was accordingly written and sent; and Sir
Henry, who fancied himself considerably nearer to his
object in consequence of the death of Lord Harold, re-
turned a gracious answer, and appointed ten o’clock on
the following day for the conference. Sir Walter Her-
bert then proceeded to Moorhurst; but, although Lang-
ford felt a longing desire to pass one more evening of
tranquillity with her he loved best in the library of the
calm old Manor House, he would not leave the sad
dwelling where the body of his father lay, but remained
there during the night. -
By ten o’clock the next morning Sir Walter had re-
turned, and the arrival of Sir Henry Heywood soon fol-
lowed. He was now, however, accompanied by a law-
yer, and, on his entering the room, Langford imme-
diately, in plain and courteous language and few words,
announced to him the situation in which he stood, as

son of the late Earl of Danemore, by his plivate mar-
riage with Eugenie de Beaulieu.
Sir Henry Heywood had not lost his time since his
arrival in the neighbourhood of Damemore Castle, and,
by one means or another, had collected a very accurate
knowledge of Langford's situation, and the points in
which his claim was strong or defective. .
“Sir,” he said, in reply, “what you have just asserted
may be, and, indeed, very probably is correct. You are
a likely young gentleman; bear a strong resemblance
to the late earl, and so forth. I have nothing to say
against the fact of the earl being your father, or of your
mother being a very virtuous lady; but all I have to say
is, that such assertions are good for nothing in law with-
out proofs of the fact. If you will do me the honour
to show me the registry of your father's and mother's
marriage, a certificate to that effect from the hands of
the clergyman who married them, the attestation of the
proper witnesses, or, in short, satisfactory legal proofs,
I shall make you a very low bow, and congratulate you
on your accession to the title of Earl of Danemore.
Till then, however, by your leave, I shall assume that
title myself, and, acting as heir to the late peer, take
possession of everything to which the law gives me a
claim.”
“In regard to taking possession of anything, sir,” re-
plied Langford, “be my claim what it will, I think you
will find yourself barred by my father's will.”
“Then let it be produced, sir, let it be produced,” said
Sir Henry Heywood, with some degree of irritable
sharpness; “we have heard a great deal about this will;
1et it be produced.”
“Certainly, sir,” replied Mr. Evelyn; “here it is.
But, before it is opened, we will call in, if you please,
the witnesses who heard every word of it read over to
the earl, and who saw him sign it. I think also that
his principal servants had better be present.”
What he suggested was agreed to. The small room
of the rectory was nearly filled; and while Langford,
with feelings of deep grief, perhaps we might even say
despondency, sat at the table shading his eyes with his
hand, and Sir Henry Heywood, seated on the other side,
shut his lips close, and looked full in Mr. Evelyn's face,
the lawyer, after all due formalities, proceeded to read
the will aloud.

THE ROBBER. 189
In the first place, it ordained as private and speedy a
burial of his body as possible. In the next, it provided
liberally for all the servants. It then went on to leave
to his son Edward, heretofore erroneously called Lord
Harold, a large independent fortune, which was to re-
vert, in case of his death without issue, to the person
whom next he named; that person was his eldest son,
Henry, by his first wife, Eugenie de Beaulieu, whom he
had married privately the year before the Restoration.
Under the skilful management of Mr. Evelyn, nothing
had been left undone to show that Langford was the
person to whom he alluded, and to render the wording
of the earl's will the most solemn acknowledgment of
his marriage and declaration of his son's legitimacy.
With all these precautions, the earl went on to leave to
him every part of his vast fortune not otherwise dis-
osed of; noticing the estates attached to the title of
£ of Danemore only as coming to him of necessity.
The three executors were then appointed, as had been
before announced, and the will terminated with the sig-
nature.
The reading of this document called forth a burst of
angry vehemence from Sir Henry Heywood, which
might have proceeded farther had it not been repressed
instantly by a murmur of indignation which ran through
all present. -
Langford, however, himself, was the coolest of the
party; and, as soon as the reading of the will was con-
cluded, he said, “Sir Henry Heywood, in the present
state of feeling experienced by all parties, the less dis-
cussion that takes place, of course, the better. You
are now satisfied as to who are the executors; but I
think it will be better, till after the funeral is over, to
remove none of the seals which have been placed; and
I doubt not that this reverend gentleman and Sir Walter
Herbert will agree with me in that view. You will, of
course, be present at the funeral; and I doubt not that,
on that sad occasion, we shall all meet more calmly.
For the present, I wish you good-morning;” and, so say-
ing, he bowed to the party and left the room.
Sir Henry Heywood remained, and would fain have
entered into the discussion of many points, both with
Sir Walter and Mr. Evelyn, but neither were at all in-
clined to gratify him in that respect; and he retired, de-
claring that he would certainly attend the funeral; but

that, before that tims, he would have such legal author.
ity Irom London as would enable him to maintain his
just rights against any conspiracy which might be
formed to oppose them. Sir Walter Herbert coloured
and raised his head at the word conspiracy with signs
of ill-represséd indignation; but Mr. Evelyn laid his
hand upon his arm, saying, “He is a disappointed man,
Sir Walter, and has privilege of angry words.”
On the measures that were taken by Sir Henry Hey-
wood we will not dwell, nor will we pause even for a
moment on the melancholy ceremony of committing to
dust the bodies of the Earl of Danemore and his younger
son. Langford, although between him and the dead
there existed none of those endearing ties which gather
round the heart in the tender intercourse of early years
—though his affection towards them was not, like the
rich shells which we find imbedded in the coral rock,
joined to the things it clung to by the accumulated love
and associations of years—still could not help feeling
deeply and painfully as he laid the father and the brother
in the grave, and took the dark .farewell of his last .
earthly kindred.
Sir Henry Heywood had by this time learned so far
to restrain himself that nothing disagreeable occurred;
and from the vault the whole party turned their steps,
not to the rectory, but to one of the large saloons which
had remained unconsumed in Danemore Castle. There
two noted lawyers were found waiting for the baronet,
who immediately addressed himself to Langford, de-
manding if he distinctly understood him to lay claim to
the earldom of Danemore.
“Distinctly, sir,” replied Langford.
“Very well, sir. Then—” interrupted Sir Henry.
But the other waved his hand and went on, “I do
most distinctly lay claim to that earldom, sir; but, as I
wish to do nothing whatsoever that can be considered
unfair towards you, and shall, in a few days, be able to.
produce the only papers which seem necessary to con-
vince you of my right—having at this moment a certain
knowledge of the person who has taken them—I shall
leave the executorial duties under my father's will en-
tirely to my excellent friends, who, well advised, will
deal with you in all justice and all kindness, I am sure.
I myself am bound upon important business, and, there-
fore, you will excuse my presence any farther. I trust

in two honourable men, all whose actions I know will
bear the closest inspection; and I shall feel satisfied
with and ratify everything that they shall do.”
A word whispered in the ear of Sir Henry Heywood
by one of his lawyers made him start a step forward
ere Langford departed, and say, “Doubtless, sir, we are
to expect on your return the production of the papers
you mention; and, of course, you will be quite willing
to submit them, as you do the conduct of your friends,
to the closest inspection.”
“Quite,” replied Langford, with a calm smile, so
slightly coloured by contempt that none but an eager
and well-qualified appetite could have detected the ad-
mixture. “Whether I bring back the papers or not,
Sir Henry, depends upon fortune; or rather, I should
say, upon God’s will. But certain it is that you judge
rightly when you think I go to seek them; and that I go
to seek them where they are to be found, I am quite
certain. My chance may be to find them or not. I give
you good-day.”
Leaving Sir Henry Heywood to follow what course
he thought fit, and Sir Walter Herbert, with the rector,
guided by Mr. Evelyn, and an old, calm, thoughtful, ex-
perienced, little-speaking lawyer from London, to deal
with him as they judged advisable, we shall trace the
course of Henry Langford, who now, followed by two
servants, one attached to Sir Walter Herbert, and the
other an old and faithful domestic of his father the late
earl, took his way abruptly from Damemore Castle, but
not in the direction which the reader may imagine.
He rode at once across the country to the little village
of Moorhust; and, passing over the bridge—because the
shortest way, through the park, under lately existing
circumstances, had been closed—he approached the
Manor House; and leaving his horse, with orders not
to unsaddle him, in the courtyard, he hurried through
the house in search of Alice Herbert.
He found her without much difficulty; and sweet and
tender were her feelings on that first meeting, alone,
and altogether to each other, after a long period of dis-
tress and anxiety, and the obtrusiveness of a thousand
anxious and busy cares. He told her that he could not
go away upon a journey of some distance and of much
importance without seeing her, without bidding her
farewell for the time. He told her again and again how

deeply and how passionately he loved her. He pressed
her again and again to his heart in gratitude for past
kindness, in the ardour of present affection, in the long-
ing apprehension of parting. He took, and she granted,
all that a noble heart could wish or a pure heart could
yield; and then, springing upon his horse, he once more
pursued his way towards the spot which the tale of Jus-
tice Whistler had pointed out as that where Franklin
Gray was likely to be met with.
He left the village, with the rectory of Mr. Santon
far to the left, about an hour before sunset; and then
inquiring his way to the nearest farmhouse—for there
were neither railroads over deserts nor hotels upon
mountains in those days—he prepared to repose for the
night ere he pursued his inquiries on the following
morning. The people of the farm were kind and civil;
and, though it put them somewhat out of their way to
receive a guest with two servants and three horses
when they expected no such thing, the matter was read-
ily arranged, and Langford soon found himself sitting at
a pleasant country table, whereat ten or twelve people
were enjoying themselves after the fatigues of the day.
Langford made himself friends wherever he came by
the urbanity of his manners, generally ruling as much
as he wished in all circumstances, by appearing, like the
ancient Greek, to yield and to respect. In the present
instance he was received with great gladness, and was
enabled to gain information of everything that was pass-
ing throughout the country round by the very fact of
his making himself at once at home among the people,
as we have said he did, and by seeming to share their
feelings, which soon proved the means of his sharing
their thoughts. The whole tittle-tattle of the neigh-
bourhood was now detailed to him, and he heard every
particular of the death of his brother. The stopping of
Mr. Justice Whistler, and his scourging with the saddle-
girths and stirrup-leathers, were also told him, with
many other interesting details, which seemed to have
made a deep impression upon the laughter-loving hearts
of the honest villagers.
Langford himself was, in comparison with his ordinary
moods, sad and gloomy, as he well might be, not so
much from anticipation of the future as in reflecting
upon the past, and upon all the deeds, wrongs, and sor
rows whereon that inevitable past had set its seal f:

ever; and as he approached the spot where his brother
had fallen, the despondency that he felt was, of course,
not diminished. Without asking any direct questions
concerning Franklin Gray, Langford obtained tidings
which made him hesitate in regard to his farther con-
duct; for, in answer to his inquiries as to whether any
of the robbers had been captured, the honest farmer–
who had been one of those that went out against them,
and, therefore, took a personal interest in the whole af-
fair—informed him that the band had certainly dispersed,
each man, it was supposed, taking his separate way
back to London. Such was the opinion pronounced by
Mr. Justice Whistler, the farmer said; and Langford
now learned for the first time that the worthy justice
had returned to the scene of his former adventures, and
was eagerly aiding the local magistrates in the pursuit
of the robbers.
He feared, then, that Franklin Gray might thus have
been driven from the neighbourhood; but, after some
reflection, an impression took hold of his mind—proba-
bly springing from the traits of the robber's character
which he had seen and marked in better days—that
Gray would linger, for a time at least, round the spot
where his unhappy wife was interred; and Langford
consequently proceeded at once to the little solitary
burial-ground in which she lay. To it was attached a
small church, situated at a great distance from any
other building, high upon the side of the hill, and offer-
ing once in the week some means of religious instruc-
tion to the inhabitants of that wild track. He easily
found the grave of poor Mona Gray, for no one had
been buried there for many months but herself, and
every other grave was green.
The sight of that grave, however, confirmed him in
the hope of soon finding Franklin Gray; for at the head
were strewed, here and there, some wild flowers, evi.
dently lately gathered. Justice Whistler, with a heart
hardened by intercourse with evil things, did not com-
prehend the character of the robber as Langford did,
and never dreamed that he would linger near the spot
where the wife, whom he had himself slain with such
determined premeditation, slept her last sleep.
Leaving his two servants to watch in the churchyard,
Henry Langford rode up to the top of the hills, and con-

ere he had gone half a mile, he saw something move
in one of the deep, shadowy indentations of the ground,
and, riding quickly down, he pursued the object as it
fled before him, taking advantage of everything which
could conceal it in its flight, doubling round every tree
and bush, and plunging into each deep dell. But Lang-
ford caught sight of it sufficiently often to feel sure that
it was a human being, and he gained upon it also as it
led him back in its flight towards the churchyard.
There, however, he lost sight of it again; but, the
moment after, a faint cry met his ear, and a shout; and,
riding on fast, he found the boy Jocelyn in the hands
of his two servants. The boy was evidently in great
terror; and the sound of another voice behind him,
when Langford spoke as he came up, made him start
almost out of the hands of the men who held him.
The sight of Langford's well-known face, however, in-
stantly made his countenance brighten; and when that
gentleman spoke kindly to him, and bade the men let
him go, the boy came up towards him, bending his head
and looking gladly in his face, as a favourite dog that
has been lost for several days runs up, fawning, but yet
half frightened, towards his master when it returns.
“Well, Jocelyn,” said Langford, gazing at him, and
marking his soiled clothes and somewhat pale and hag-
gard appearance, “you seem not to have fared very
richly, my poor boy, since you got away from Justice
Whistler. Did you find out your master?”
The boy looked timidly at the two men who stood
near, then hung down his head, and made no reply.
Langford bent over him, and said in a low voice, “Do
not be frightened, Jocelyn. I am seeking no ill, either
to yourself or your master. Come with me on the hill-
side, and tell me more. We will leave the men here.”
“You must leave your horse behind, then, also,” said
the boy, in the same low tone, “if you want to see the
captain, as you used to do; for he will never let us find
him if he sees any one coming on horseback.”
“That I will do willingly,” replied Langford; and,
throwing the bridle to one of the men, he bade them re-
main there till he returned. -
Holding the boy Jocelyn by the hand, he then went
out upon the hillside, questioning him as they walked
along in regard to Franklin Gray; but, before he would
answer anything, the boy made him again and again

promise that he would not betray his master. When he
was satisfied on that point, he gazed up in Langford's face
with a look of deep and anxious sadness, saying, “Oh, you
don't know all, Captain Langford. You don’t know all!”
“Yes, my good boy, I do,” replied Langford; “I have
heard all the sad story of the people going to attack
your master in his house, and his fancying that his wife
had betrayed him, and shooting the person he loved best
on earth.”
“Ay, poor thing, she is happy,” said the boy; “I am
sure she is in heaven, for every day since they laid her
in the churchyard I have strewed what flowers I could
get upon her grave, and they do not wither there half
so soon as they do anywhere else. But I am sure it is
better for her to be there than to see her husband in
such a state as he is now.”
“What do you mean, Jocelyn?” demanded Langford.
“Grief and remorse for what he has done must, I dare
say, have had a terrible effect upon your master; but
you seem to imply something more. What is it that you
mean?”
“Alas,” replied the boy, “he is mad, quite mad. It
is that that made Harvey and the rest leave him, for
they found him out after he got away, and joined him
again; but, both for his sake and their own, they were
obliged to separate when they found what state he was
in. But I am sure he had been mad some time before;
for, the day after that wicked man made his escape who
brought all the people upon us, I saw him on the hill
fire one of his pistols in the air, as if he had been shoot-
ing at something, though there was nothing to be seen;
and, when he had done, he looked at the pistol, and said,
‘You are not so dangerous now. But now he is quite
wild, and you must take care how you go near him, for
it is a thousand to one that he fires at you, and you
know he never misses his mark.”
“Whereabout is he?” demanded Langford. “I won-
der he has not been discovered.”
“Oh, he is two or three miles off, at least,” replied
the boy; “in the rocky part of the hills near the sea.
He never comes about here but at night, when he goes
to the grave in the churchyard, and moans over it; but
then, before daylight, he is away again.”
Langford and the boy walked on, but the two or three
miles he spoke of proved to be fully five, and, during

the last mile, the scenery became wild and rugged in
the extreme. The turf, which had covered the hills
farther inland with a smooth though undulating surface,
was here constantly broken by immense masses of rock,
sometimes taking the form of high banks and promon-
tories, with the tops still soft and grassy; sometimes
starting abruptly up in fantastic groups out of the ground,
like the rugged and misshapen columns of some druid-
ical temple. Here and there a few scattered birch-trees
varied the scene, and near a spot where a spring of
clear water broke from the ground, and wandered down
in a stream into a valley, three or four fine oaks had
planted themselves, shelted by a higher ridge of hill
from the sharp winds of the sea.
As they came near this spot the boy Jocelyn gave
a long low whistle, more like the cry of some wild bird
than any sound from human lips, saying, after he had
done so, “He is often about here at this hour.”
No answer was returned, however, and they went on
for nearly another mile, which brought them to the
high rocks that encircled a bay of the sea. “I should
not wonder if he were here,” said the boy; “for I some-
times catch fish for him in this bay, and there are more
berries and things of that kind about upon the shrubs
that grow half way down than anywhere else.”
“Good God! Is that the only food that he obtainst”
demanded Langford.
“He has had nothing else,” said the boy, sadly,
“since Harvey and the rest went away. Look there!
There he is ! just below us, a little to the left. Hush !
Do not let us go quick!”
Langford laid his hand upon the boy's arm, and de-
tained him while he gazed down for two or three mo-
ments on the unhappy man who had once been his com-
panion and friend in the stirring days of military adven
ture.
It was a terrible sight! The sun was shining bright,
though over the deep blue sky some large detached
Thasses of cloud were borne by a soft and equable
*ut rapid wind, throwing upon the green bosom of the
water below, and the rocks and hills round about, deep
jear shadows, which, as thcy floated on, left the objects
:hat they touched brighter than ever in the sunshine,
like the shadows which doubt, or suspicion, or gloom,
or the waywardness of the human heart, will cast upon

things in themselves beautiful, and which, when the
mood is gone or the doubt removed, resume at once all
their splendour. Part of the steep close by Franklin
Gray was covered with bushes, mingled with some taller
trees, and over these the shadow of a cloud was flying,
while he himself sat in the full light upon a small pro-
jecting piece of the rock.
Tenderly folded to his bosom, he held his infant with
both his arms; and, swaying backward and forward,
while his eyes wandered wildly over the waters, he
seemed endeavouring to rock it to sleep. A little far-
ther up, his horse, his beautiful gray, of which he had
been so fond, cropped the scanty herbage, with the
bridle cast upon his neck; and hearing the approach of
strangers even before his master, he raised high his
proud head, and gazed eagerly around.
“How does he feed the child!” demanded Langford,
in a whisper.
“With berries, and anything he can get,” replied the
boy; “he never lets it be out of his arms but to crawl
round him for a few moments on the turf.”
~
“This is very terrible, indeed,” said Langford; “but -
he sits there on such a fearful point of the rock, that
you had better go forward yourself in the first instance,
and tell him that I am here. The least thing might
make him plunge over.”
“It would not : me at all,” replied the boy;
“for where he goes I am sure I would not go, and yet I
can climb as well as any one.”
Langford then withdrew for a few yards, and the boy
again uttered his low whistle, which was immediately
answered. After pausing for a moment or two to give
him time to reach his master, Langford again advanced,
and saw the boy i. eager conversation with Franklin
Gray, whose eyes
he stood. Satisfied that he was prepared for his coming,
Langford descended, \though with difficulty, the pre-
cipitous path which led to the shelf of rock on which
he stood; and Franklin Gray himself took a step or two
back from the edge, and came forward to meet him.
Holding the child still to his bosom with one arm, he
at first held out his other hand to his old companion,"
but the next moment, as they came near, he drew it
suddenly back, gazing upon him with his bright flashing
eyes, and exclaiming, “No, no! This hand killed your

father and your brother, and you must pursue me to
the death !”
“No, Franklin,” replied Langford, in a calm and quiet
tone, “I pursue you not with any evil intent towards
you. What you say is true; that hand did slay my
brother, and aided, perhaps, in taking my father's life;
but that hand, too, aided and supported my mother; and
my father, not many days before his death, made me
promise that I would in no degree seek for vengeance
upon you. He said that he had somehow wronged you
in early years, and that it was fitting your own hand
should punish him.”
“He did, he did wrong me,” cried Franklin Gray.
“To him I owe all that is evil in my nature. He had
me kidnapped when I was a boy, and would have fain
followed the sweet lady he had deserted. He had kid-
napped and carried me away into the south, and made
me familiar with blood; and, when I fled from him, he
pursued me as if I had been his slave, but I escaped
from him. And now you—you, Henry, tell me what
you seek with me ! If you come not for vengeance.
what is it you come for?”
“I came,” replied Langford, “from a personal motive;
but I did not expect, Franklin, to find you in this state,
and the thoughts of myself are swallowed up in pain to
find you thus.”
“What! you mean I am mad!” burst forth Franklin
Gray. “It is true I am mad, madder than any that we
used to see nursed by the Brothers of Charity at Char-
enton. But what matters that? Every one else is as
mad as myself. Was not she mad to let me think that
she had betrayed me? Was she not madder still to
send me word when she was dying that she had not
betrayed me, and to pile coals of fire upon my head?
Was she not mad to die at all and leave me with this
infant?” and, sitting down upon the ground, he looked
earnestly upon the face of the child, which his vehe-
mence had wakened up from its sleep.
After pausing for a few minutes, and pressing his
hand tight upon his brow, he turned to Langford more
collectedly, saying, “You told me you came here from
a personal motive. What was it? Speak quickly,
while my mind will go straight, for my brain is like a
horse that has just gone blind, and wavers from one
side of the road to the other,” and he laughed wildly at
his own simile.

THE ROBBER. 199
“The motive that brought me, Franklin,” replied
Langford, “was to obtain from you the papers which
you know I have been so long seeking to possess. My
mother's marriage, it seems, cannot be proved without
them.”
Franklin Gray started upon his feet, and gazed with
wild surprise in Langford's face. “I have them not,”
he exclaimed; “I never touched them. Did you not
take them . It was your own fault, then, and they were
burnt with the house. We rushed out as fast as we
could go. I know nothing farther.”
That he spoke truth was so evident, that Langford
1nstantly determined to say nothing more on the sub-
ject, though the disappointment caused him a bitter
pang. But it was useless to enter into any explanations
with the unhappy man before him; and, with the usual
calm decision of his character, he determined at once
to apply himself, as far as possible, to see what might
be done to relieve and comfort him. If he remained in
England, his life would inevitably be sacrificed to the
law, notwithstanding his manifest insanity. He him-
self, under such circumstances, could not even intercede
in his favour, and the only hope of saving him from pub-
lic execution was to induce him to fly to France, and,
by giving notice of his condition to some persons of in-
fluence there, to obtain admission for him into the in-
stitution which he himself had mentioned, the Brothers
of Charity at Charenton, who devoted themselves to
the care of persons in his unhappy situation. All this
passed through his mind in a moment, and he replied to
Franklin Gray at once, “Well, if it be so, it cannot be
helped; but now, Gray, to speak of yourself. You
must be aware that you are here in a very dangerous
situation, surrounded by people who are pursuing you
for the express purpose of bringing you to the scaffold.
Would it not be much better for you to fly to France?”
Franklin Gray gazed in his face for a moment or two,
then looked up to the sky with a sort of half smile.
“It would be better,” he answered, at length; “it
would be better, and my passage is even taken in a ship,
which is to sail, I think, in two days. But what am I
to do with the child !” -
“Oh, I will provide means for its joining you,” replied
Langford; “it shall be well taken care of.”
“I have got a little boat, too, down there,” said Gray,

in a rambling manner, “which would carry me to the
ship in no time.”
Langford looked at the boy Jocelyn with an inquiring
glance; but the youth shook his head, murmuring in a
scarcely audible tone, “There is no boat.”
Franklin Gray did not hear him, and was evidently
occupied with other thoughts. He put his hand again te
his head, and then turning to Henry Langford, he said
“Henry, we are old companions, and I will take you at
your word. Promise me, as a man and a soldier, that this
babe shall be well taken care of till he joins me. It is
a sweet creature, and seldom, if ever, cries. You will
use it as your own, Henry, in every respect as your
own.”
“I will, indeed,” replied Langford; “I will, indeed;
but let us think now how you can best be got off to the
Vessel.”
But Franklin Gray went on in the same strain: “And
poor Jocelyn, too,” he said, laying his hand upon the
boy's head; “you will be kind to him, and breed him
as a soldier.” -
“He had better go with you, Franklin,” replied Lang-
ford.
“No,” answered Franklin Gray. “No, I shall be
better alone;” and, at the same time, the boy whispered
to Langford, “Humour him, humour him. I will find
means to follow him close.”
“Will you promise that too !” demanded Franklin
Gray, but instantly went on without waiting a reply.
“Then the baby, too, Henry,” he continued; “you will
be very kind to it, and tender, and love it very much "
See, it smiles at you. Take it in your arms.”
Langford took the child as he held it out to him.
Franklin Gray bent down his head and kissed it; then
laid his two muscular hands upon Langford's shoulders,
and gazed gravely and solemnly into his eyes.
“Henry,” he said, “your vow is registered in Heaven!”
and, before Langford could answer him, he burst forth,
as if with a shout of exultation, “Now I am free ' Now
I am free Now I am free l’”
With a sudden spring forward he reached the ledge
on which he had lately stood, and, without pause, or
thought, or hesitation, plunged at once over into empty
alr.
The depth below might be near two hundred feet, and

the water of the sea washed the base of the rock. It
was in vain that Langford himself sought, and, with
the aid of his servants and some people that they
brought to his assistance, spent the whole of that even
ing in endeavouring to find the body of Franklin Gray.
It was not till nearly ten days after that some fishermen
found a corpse, with marks of much violence about it,
showing that it must have struck upon the rocks at the
bottom of the water, lying on a sandy Spit that ran out
from one of the points of the bay. The clothes proved
it to be that of Franklin Gray, but nobody took any
pains to identify it as such. A verdict of found drowned
was returned by the coroner's jury; and it was buried,
at Langford’s expense, close to the side of Mona Gray,
in the churchyard on the hills.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE road which Langford pursued on his way back
was that which passed over the moor, as we have be-
fore mentioned, near the spot called Upwater Mere, and
thence, descending the hill, separated into two branches
at a point where, on the one hand, the remains of Dane-
more Castle, with its wide park and deep woods, were
to be seen at the distance of about four miles, and on
the other appeared the graceful little spire of Moorhurst
Church, with the manifold roofs and chimneys of the
Manor House, peeping out of the "rees some way in
advance.
Langford, when he reached that spot, which was at
that period of the evening when the shadows begin to
grow long, but before the sun has lost any of its power,
paused, and gazed for several minutes upon the mansion
of his ancestors, saying to it in his own heart, “Fare-
well for ever. The things which were to have given
you back to me, with al the honours and pride of high
birth and long ancestry, are lost beyond reach. But
never mind. It may be better as it is. I shall escape
the haughty temptations of high estate. Alice will not
love me less; and though it may cost good Sir Walter's
heart a pang when he thinks that the legitimacy of my

birth is not clear to the eyes of all men, he himself will
not doubt it. It may cause mine a pang too, that even
a shade should rest upon my mother's name; but 1 have
dOne all that could be done.”
Such were his thoughts, though not perhaps his words,
as, after gazing for some time upon the castle, he turned
and directed his horse's head towards Moorhurst. On
arriving at the old Manor House, he looked up with
pleasure to see the smoke curling up above the trees,
the lattice windows wide open to give admission to the
sweet fresh air, and all bearing that air of old comfort
and calm cheerfulness which it used to do.
There were several persons, not servants, lingering
about in the courtyard, however. There was a look of
some vexation in honest Halliday's face as he gave Lang-
ford admission, and two or three strangers were stand-
ing in the hall. The events of the last few weeks had
brought a sort of apprehensiveness upon Langford's
heart which sorrow can do even to those who are steel-
ed against danger; and he asked at once if anything
were the matter.
“Oh no. His worship and Mistress Alice are both
quite well, sir,” replied Halliday, divining Langford's
feelings at once. “It is only that they have brought a
poor fellow up before Sir Walter charged with stealing,
who I am sure never stole; and that Sir Henry Hey-
wood, or Lord Danemore, as he calls himself—I hope
he’ll have to uncall himself soon—is pressing to have
him sent to prison at once. Mistress Alice is up in the
village. I am glad she is away, poor thing.”
Langford went on into the library, and passing with-
out much notice a group of persons around the prisoner
at the end of the long table, he advanced to Sir Walter,
who was sitting with Sir Henry Heywood at some dis
tance, with a smaller table before them, and some books
The knight and the baronet both rose on seeing Lang-
ford; the one to grasp his hand eagerly, the other to
make him a low and much more cordial bow than he
had ever hitherto done.
“Pray, sir, may I ask,” he said, immediately, with a
certain anxious quivering of the lip, but with perfect ci-
vility, “if you have been successful in your search?”
“I have not, sir,” replied Langford, straightforwardly;
“I have not found what I sought.” -
“Then I presume, sir, that you are not disposed to

pursue farther your claims in this matter,” rejoined the
other, in a hesitating manner. ins
“You are quite wrong, sir,” replied Langford; “I
shall pursue it without delay upon such proofs as are in
my possession. If it were but for the purpose of clear-
ing my mother's fame, I would do so, even if there ex-
..isted no chance of my recovering my right.”
“It is a noble feeling, sir,” said Sir Henry, with an
urbane smile; “but perhaps there may be a method of
compromising this affair. Allow me one word with
you;” and, so saying, he drew Langford aside into the
recess of one of the windows. “For my own part,”
he continued, “I am not ambitious. I am a widower,
and shall certainly never marry again. I have but two
daughters; you are a single man—”
“But one engaged to be married very shortly,” re-
plied his auditor, making him a low bow; and Sir Hen-
ry, turning on his heel sharply, went back at once to
Sir Walter Herbert, saying, in a fierce and impatient
tone, “Let us proceed with the business before us at
once, Sir Walter. I say the man must be committed,
and I call upon you as a magistrate to do so.”
“I do not see the case as you do,” answered the good
Knight of Moorhurst; and, as he spoke, Langford ap-
proached the table also, and, raising his eyes to the pris-
oner, at once recognised the poor half-witted man, silly
John Graves. Though surprised and grieved, he said
nothing, having learned in a hard and difficult school to
govern his first emotions. Standing beside Sir Walter
Herbert, however, and feeling that internal conviction
of the man's honesty and truth which is gained not
alone from great and significant actions, but from small
signs and casual traits, which betray rather than display
the heart, he determined to interpose as far as possible
in the poor man's defence, and not to suffer the over-
bearing vehemence of Sir Henry Heywood to crush the
calm simplicity of truth, as overbearing vehemence so
generally does in this world.
“Why, Sir Walter Herbert,” exclaimed Sir Henry
Heywood, in the same sharp tone, “has not the man
been found carrying out of the ruins of Damemore Cas-
tle a valuable cup and silver cover? Has he not been
taken in the very act?” -
“I took nothing but what was my own,” said Silly
John, gazing upon Sir He'; Heywood with a shy look,
F

which mingled, in strange harmony, terror, and con-
tempt, and hatred; “I took nothing but what was my
own, or what ought never to have been there, or what
no one there had a right to.”.
“What, then,” exclaimed Sir Henry Heywood, “you”
took more besides the cup, did you?”
“Ay, that I did,” replied Silly John; “I took the cup
because Mistress Bertha brought it to me full of wine
on the night I was shut up there, in the dark hole under
the tower; and she gave me the cup and all, and said I
might keep it; and then the fire came, and I lost the
cup; and so, whenever I was well enough of the burns
and the bruises, I went back again to seek it and to
take my own.”
“Send for Mistress Bertha,” said Sir Walter, in a
loud voice, speaking to one of the attendants at the
lower side of the room. “She is now in the house,
which is fortunate.”
Sir Henry Heywood gnawed his lip, but, as if to fill
up the time, he asked the prisoner, looking keenly at
him, “You acknowledge you took other things out of
the castle before you were caught. What were they,
and what right had you to them? You will see, Sir
Walter,” he continued, “that whether Danemore Cas-
tle belongs to me, or to this gentleman who claims it,
it is absolutely necessary that we who dispute the prop-
erty, and you who are executor to the will, should in-
vestigate accurately and prosecute vigorously every
one who abstracts anything from that building. I ask
you again,” he added, addressing the half-witted man,
“what it was you admit taking, and what claim you had
thereunto ?” -
“More claim than you can show,” answered Silly
John, “for I had some right, and you have none. And
worse than a fox you are, for a fox only seeks a young
bird out of the nest, you seek nest and all. Every one
knows I speak truth. Every one knows I never told a
lie in my life!”
“Ay, that we do, that we do,” cried one or two voices
at the lower part of the library; but at that instant the
voice of Sir Henry Heywood was raised, exclaiming,
“Silence, there; how dare you disturb the court?”
“By your leave, Sir Henry,” said Sir Walter Herbert.
But at that moment the woman Bertha entered the
room, with the same cold, calm, and dignified air which

had become second nature with her, and, gazing round
with a look of inquiry, but not astonishment, she de-
manded, “What is wanted with me? Who sent for
me?”
The next moment, however, her eyes fell upon the
half-witted man as he stood at the bottom of the table;
and clasping her hands together with emotion, such as
no one present had ever seen her display on any pre-
vious occasion, she exclaimed, “Good God! is it possi-
ble! Art thou living? or art thou risen from the dead?
I thought thou hadst been burnt to ashes in Hubert's
Tower, which fell among the first that went down. I
dared not even mention thy name, for thy confinement
there, and the dreadful fate that I thought had befallen
thee, were too terrible, were too awful for thought even
to rest upon : . But now thou art come to life again to
bear witness of the truth; and yet,” she added, sorrow-
fully, “they will not hear his testimony, for they will
say he is mad; that he has been mad for years.”
“Never you fear that, Mistress Bertha,” said the half-
witted man. “The foxes let me out before they set
fire to the house; and I never forget anything; so, while
they were fighting and tearing each other to pieces, I
went and fingered—what do you think?”
“The papers! the papers!” exclaimed Bertha, almost
screaming with joy.
“Ay, even so,” said the half-witted man, thrusting
his hand into his breast. “I found the key upon the
floor of the room, and I opened the hole in the wall and
took them out.” * -
“What right had you with them?” thundered Sir
Henry Heywood, who had sat by, no unconcerned spec-
tator of the scene. “What right had you with anything
in that place? You confess robbery!”
“What right had I with them!” exclaimed Silly John,
with a wild laugh. “Why, you are as foolish as if you
had been born before Noah's flood | Wasn’t there the
leaf of the register which they cut out of my own re-
gister-book just about the time I first went mad, when I
was usher of Uppington Grammar-school, and clerk of
the parish? and did not that make me madder than be-
fore? Who had any right to the leaf but I? and there
it is 1” and he spread out upon the table an old yellow
leaf of paper, written over both sides with pale ancient
ink, and £g the traces of many foldings.

“It is a falsehood! a forgery!” exclaimed Sir Henry
Heywood. “It is got up for the occasion! It is a con-
spiracy! Let me see the sheet!” and he started for-
ward to snatch it from the table; but at that moment
Mr. Evelyn the lawyer stepped in before him, and laid
his hand firmly upon it. - * .
“By your leave, sir,” he said, “this valuable docu-
ment is fingered by nobody. Do not bend your brows
on me, sir. I am firm ! Clerk, take up the document,
and be you responsible for it! If Sir Henry chooses to
bring this business into court, he may; but, if he will
take my advice, he will listen to a few quiet words.
While thinking that my noble client and patron, the
young Earl of Danemore, here present,” and he pointed
to Langford, “would certainly obtain this same docu-
ment from another source, I busied myself eagerly to
obtain every collateral testimony which could prove the
identity of the leaf that had been so nicely extracted
from the register; and I have here, under my hand, the
certificates of five marriages which took place in that
same year in the parish of Uppington which are not now
to be found in the volume of the register, but which
will be found, I will answer for it, in the leaf that is now
produced. This will be confirmation beyond all doubt
if it be so. Clerk, compare the papers!”
“Oh, but that is all nonsense, Master Turny,” cried
Silly John; “there’s no need of comparing anything.
Was not I clerk of the parish myself, and witness of
the marriage? And, besides, here's the certificate of
the marriage in the Rev. Jonathan Whattle's own hand.
Anybody in the place will swear to the drunken par-
son's handwriting. The only difference was that it was
more crooked and shaky when he was sober than when
he was drunk; and here's my own handwriting to it, as
I used to write in those days. God help me! I’ve
nearly forgotten how to write now. And then there's
Mistress Bertha's there; her hand is to it too, and a
Frenchman's hand that was with them at the time. I
remember very well. And here's another paper be
sides, written in a tongue I don’t understand, which is
all the more likely to prove a matter of moment. God .
help us all! we’re as blind as kittens of three days old,
and can tell nothing of what will happen to us at the
end of the nine.” -
“Sir,” said the clerk, who had been busily looking

over the papers, “I find all these extracts placed at in-
tervals in the leaf of the register before me. There
are nine or ten others too, which could doubtless easily
be traced. Shall I send for the register of Uppington
to compare the book and the leaf,” •
“It is unnecessary, sir, it is unnecessary,” said Sir
Henry Heywood, making a virtue of necessity. “My
lord the Earl of Danemore, I congratulate you on your
unexpected accession to such honours and so much
wealth. That you have cast me out from them, I for-
give you. Disappointed I must feel; but that disap-
pointment, believe me, proceeds more from affection for
my two poor girls, whose inheritance will be but their
father's sword, useless in their hands, and their moth-
er's virtues, which God grant may adorn them always,
than from the loss of rank and wealth to myself. Sir,
I give you good-morning, and leave you.”
“Stop a moment, Sir Henry Heywood,” said Lang-
ford; “a word in your ear before you go.” That word
was spoken in a moment, but Sir Henry Heywood's
face was in that moment lighted up with joy, and, grasp-
ing Langford's hand in both his own, he exclaimed,
“Indeed, indeed, my lord, you are too generous!”
“Not so, Sir Henry,” replied Langford; “for the pres-
ent, adieu. We will meet to-morrow at Danemore Cas-
tle, and all shall be settled entirely. Mr. Evelyn, pray
arrange the rest of the matters that are to be settled
here. Sir Walter,” he added, in a lower tone, “there
is some one whom I would fain see, in this moment of
joy and agitation, before I say a word more to any
one.”
“She must have returned by this time,” said Sir Wal-
ter. “Let us go!”
They went out, and proceeded to the ladies’ with-
drawing-room, where they found Alice, with her beau-
tiful eyes raised anxiously towards the door. As soon
as she saw Langford she sprang up to meet him, with
the whole pure, unrestrained joy of her heart beaming
forth upon that lovely face.
“Alice,” said Sir Walter, with a touch of his kindly
stateliness, “this is the Earl of Damemore !”
“Your own Henry, ever dearest Alice,” said Lang-
ford, casting his arms, round her; and then, while he
held her to his bosom with one hand, he extended the
other to Sir Walter, “Most excellent and generous

friend, I have never yet asked your consent with m
own lips. Do you give her to me? Will you part wit
this great, this inestimable treasure?”
“I will give her to you, Henry,” replied Sir Walter,
“with all my heart and soul. I will give her to you,
but I will not part with her. I must have a garrst in
the castle, my dear boy! There, there, I give her to
ou. She is yours. God’s blessing and her father's
e upon your heads!”
So saying, he clasped their hands in each ther, anc
