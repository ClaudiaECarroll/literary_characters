 CHAPTER I. 
 
 The shades of a cold and bleak autumnal 
 night were gathering fast around the 
 ancient turrets of De Dunstanville Abbey, 
 and dark and heavy moved the rolling 
 clouds, amid the sickly gleams of a waning 
 moon, involving the fabric and wide 
 domains in an awful and indistinguishable 
 gloom ; but darker, and heavier still, fell 
 the deepening shadows of death on the 
 closing eyes of the illustrious possessor, Sir 
 Geoffry De Dunstanville. He had settled

 every account between himself and the 
 world ; his conscience and heaven ; he 
 felt that hallowed calm w T ithin, which 
 mortal approbation could not give ; he 
 felt that which mortal censure could not 
 take away ; he felt that the last sigh of 
 attenuated nature would prove the prelude 
 to immortal felicity, and introduce him to 
 a society of the just made perfect ; — yet, 
 even in these moments so near the fulness 
 of all perfect peace^ one darling hope, one 
 darling wish, remained unsatisfied, and 
 clinging to his inmost soul, gave anxiety 
 to the separating moments of life, retard- 
 ed the willing spirit in its progress to bliss, 
 and deprived his mind of that serene and 
 holy resignation which should distinguish 
 the dying hours of a true christian. His 
 head rested on pillows of down, his body 
 reposed under gilded canopies of state,

 attending physicians watched the slightest 
 variation in his ebbing pulse, and his 
 favourite domestics, with anxious respect 
 and grateful attachment, waited to catch 
 the faintest murmur, and, if possible, antici- 
 pate thought before it dawned ; — but their 
 attentions and unwearied solicitudes were 
 little regarded. Mr. Worthington, his 
 chaplain, who had for a series of years 
 lived with him in habits of confidence and 
 pleasing intimacy, was seated on one side 
 of the bed ; and behind his pillows appear- 
 ed a poor fragile form, who with tearless 
 eyes fixed on his beloved face, continued to 
 wipe the cold dews of approaching death, 
 as they effused from the aching, sunken 
 brows of a grandfather. Each moment 
 his breath was waxing fainter and fainter ; 
 his pulse weaker, and his voice less articu- 
 late ; yet were the words " is he not come r 
 b 2

 will he, will he not come ?" distinguishable 
 between each convulsive sigh. 
 
 " My father, my father, he will come, 
 indeed he will come !" said a soft, mild, 
 tremulous voice, whose sweet influence 
 the dying parent had ever felt, and ever 
 allowed ; " he will indeed come, beloved 
 father ; he knows you are sick, he knows 
 that I suffer, oh he will come, and soon !" 
 
 She ceased to speak, for the noise of 
 carriage wheels was heard rolling round 
 the inner courts of the abbey ; the sound 
 struck on the watchful ear, and vibrated 
 to the very heart of her dying grand- 
 father ; he gaoped, and starting from his 
 pillow, as if with renovated powers, and 
 wringing the cold arm which had support- 
 him, he uttered an emphatic " now /" a 
 quick step ascended the stair ; it was 
 heard \ it crossed the outer chambers, and

 in the next moment a young man, with 
 every indication of haste in his appear- 
 ance, and with a kind of wild impatient 
 agitation diffused through every feature 
 of his fine countenance, stood before 
 them. A momentary glow of innate 
 pleasure tinged the ashy cheek of the 
 dying Sir GeofFry, and while a faint ray of 
 satisfied delight gleamed in his almost 
 sightless eye, he motioned for the young 
 stranger to draw near. The youth ap- 
 proached the bed, and sinking on his knees 
 with an apprehensive, yet tender expres- 
 sion of duty, he grasped the hand, now 
 scarcely sensible of the pressure, and in a f 
 voice almost inarticulate from complicated 
 emotions, exclaimed, cc My benefactor ! — 
 my — my — " " Father !" feebly added the 
 dying man \ "Yes! your father ;" and while 
 he spoke, a sensation as pure, holy, and

 sweet as it was new, pervaded his cold 
 bosom. 
 
 A look from Mr. Worth ingt on had 
 dismissed the attendants, and only those 
 interested in the deeply impressive scene 
 impending remained in the dying cham- 
 ber. 
 
 The pause that ensued was solemn and 
 affecting ; Sir Geoffry seemed to collect 
 every expiring energy to perform one last, 
 dear hallowed act \ a serene and chastened 
 rapture irradiated every pale feature of his 
 benign countenance, as he raised the cold 
 and passive hand of his darling, his belov- 
 ed Jane, and placed it within that of the 
 youth kneeling before him. 
 
 Jane had not moved from her reclining 
 posture behind her grandfather, but with 
 an agitated start she now looked up and 
 encountered the full dark eye of him who

 unconsciously grasped her hand ; her look 
 was soft, tender, and timid, it seemed 
 almost beseeching ; the expression of his 
 was strange and wild, dubious and uncer- 
 tain ; he seemed to shiver from some 
 inward passing thought, and a con- 
 fusion of ideas rushing tumultously 
 through his brain, communicated some- 
 thing of a terrible and inexplicable mean- 
 ing to his countenance ; he felt immovable, 
 suffocating for breath, but could not 
 speak ; fearfully he cast one look on Jane, 
 but the conscious eye recoiled, he ventured 
 not another. 
 
 Poor Jane, distressed, confused, and 
 suffering from many a sad and varied 
 feeling before, now shook in the tremors 
 of nameless anticipation •, but Sir GeofFry 
 spoke •, respiration grew very difficult, his

 spirit was lingering on his lip to declare its 
 last dear purpose. 
 
 " My hour — the hour is come/' said 
 he y " it is awful, yet to the good, it is 
 good. Your mother sinned, — deeply sinned, 
 young man ;" the youth shuddered, " but 
 with you, I seal her pardon, and yet a few 
 moments, and I will tell her you are my 
 child ; the husband of my child - 9 this 
 faultless angel," turning his dying gaze on 
 Jane ; " her virtues have done all, — you 
 are my child, I die your father/' 
 
 The youth felt shivering in the horror 
 of conflicting thought, he started from his 
 knees, and probably would have rushed 
 frcm the maddening scene, but that the 
 hard dying grasp of his grandfather 
 restrained the wild impulse of a tortured 
 soul ; meantime the parent's breath was 
 wasting fast, each became lower and

 lower, and with much difficulty Mr. 
 Worthington distinguished the faint 
 sounds — " join them/' 
 
 A chill like the chill of death rushed 
 through the veins of Jane, and seemed to 
 reach the recesses of her heart. 
 
 The burnings of a proud indignant 
 nature enfrenzied the brain of her cousin, 
 and imparted to a face pale as death, the 
 stern determination of a spirit' nearly 
 superhuman in its purposes ; yet both con- 
 tinued speechless, both stood immovable ; 
 and during this suspensive pause of agony, 
 the chaplain, well understanding the looks 
 and wishes of his dying friend, took a. 
 book of prayer from the bed, and began 
 the nuptial ceremony. 
 
 A faint shriek escaped the pale lips of 
 Jane* " Stop !" was half respired, but the 
 word sunk in a sigh of anguish. A slight

 convulsion crossed the features of Sir 
 Geoffry, yet every sense was perfect ; a 
 moment intervened — and in the next, the 
 holy man to give the righteous spirit in 
 its departure, all that earth could give it, 
 pronounced, 
 
 " You are one j whom God hath joined 
 together, let no one put asunder." The last 
 dim beam of separating nature shone in 
 the uplifted eye of Sir Geoffry \ a smile of 
 ineffable rapture diffused itself through 
 every quiet feature, and extending his 
 feeble arms as if to resign his ever con- 
 scious part to waiting angels, he uttered 
 " Amen !" A groan was heard ; and Sir 
 Geoffry De Dunstanville never groaned 
 again.

 CHAPTER II. 
 
 Absorbed inaconfusion of painful thought 
 as had been the mental faculties of poor 
 Jane, her grandfather's last groan struck 
 on her ear with boding horror, and roused 
 every dormant power to all the bitterness 
 of feeling ; she threw a melancholy look 
 around, but no eye beamed sympathy; 
 she staggered for support j no arm now 
 offered its kindly aid ; — Jane was feeble 
 from recent illness, she felt her feebleness, 
 and the change of circumstance altogether 
 rushing on imagination, overcame her 
 fortitude, and she sunk lifeless on the 
 dead body of him who, from lisping in- 
 fancy, had lived to make her smile, and 
 who only lived in her smile. 
 
 During the suspensive pause of invo-

 luntary inactivity that immediately fol- 
 lowed Sir Geoffry's decease, Hildebrande 
 Fitz Ormond, no longer claiming any 
 attention, staggered unheeded from the 
 chamber of death, and in the solitary 
 gloom of a remote apartment, distressed 
 and absorbed in the dark labyrinth of com- 
 plicated reflections, passed several un- 
 interrupted hours. A combination of sad 
 circumstances before he saw the light were 
 in these moments blending and co-ope- 
 rating with the anguished, outraged, and 
 disappointed feelings of a nature strong, 
 ardent, resolute, and unbending. The 
 youth had never beheld his grandfather, 
 till most unexpectedly summoned to attend 
 the solemnities of his dying bed ; yet he 
 had bestowed on him the most liberal and 
 finished education, allowed him a very 
 splendid establishment, and took care to 
 have him presented at the different courts

 of Europe with a consequence becoming 
 the heir of Sir Geoffry De Dunstanville ; 
 his young cousin Jane, and a lady, who 
 had acted a mother's part to her youth, 
 had been his constant correspondents, and 
 while her letters breathed the pure inno- 
 cent tenderness of a fond sister, anxious 
 to secure his attachment, she guilelessly dis- 
 covered her own. Jane's maternal friend, 
 Mrs. Fortrose, in every repeated letter en- 
 deavoured to impress on his mind the 
 very large claims his generous grandfather 
 had on his duty, gratitude, and unlimited 
 obedience ; and assuredly the young Hil- 
 debrande reverenced his grandfather, of- 
 fered tire most unqualified deference to 
 his opinions and counsels, and was affec- 
 tionately grateful for his beneficence ; but 
 there was a high and haughty spirit of in- 
 dependence seated within his bosom> 
 which had descended to him with the blood

 of De Dunstanville, which he felt would 
 assert itself, and that would proudly 
 give a limit to obedience j but his 
 mind dwelt not on the ungracious 
 theme ; fearlessly he enjoyed every felicity 
 in possession, and with that buoyancy of 
 hope peculiar to the young and ardent, he 
 had raised a fairy fabrick of surpassing 
 bliss for the future, when the mandate 
 arrived, which in its consequences proved 
 distressive to many a dear and long in- 
 dulged expectation, and reduced a struc- 
 ture, which generous attachment had 
 erected, to the very grave of disappoint- 
 ment itself. His inherent pride could not 
 brook control, and his indignant spirit 
 would have defied compulsion in any 
 form ; but to strike at once altogether to 
 the very root of a beloved purpose, every 
 honest, and dearer right of the human 
 heart revolted from the tyranny, and the

 proud Hildebrande Fitz Ormond could 
 have died, but never would have yielded 
 to the oppressive violation of native free- 
 dom. 
 
 Unsanctioned and unknown to every- 
 one except the fair being herself, Hilde- 
 brande had plighted, solemnly plighted, 
 his faith, and given that heart entirely 
 away, the every movement of which his 
 grandfather conceived his voluntary fa- 
 vours invested him with power to exclu- 
 sively guide. 
 
 On his arrival at De Dunstanville Abbey 
 for the first time, when he approached 
 his dying parent, and encountered the 
 only look he had ever vouchsafed to be^ 
 stow on the child of his child, what must 
 have been his sensations to behold a ring, 
 that pledge of bliss or misery, a license, and 
 the sacred volume which only ought to

 bind soul to soul, all displayed for the im- 
 mediate celebration of that solemn and mo- 
 mentous compact never to be broken but 
 with the rending chord of life, or shame, 
 and obloquy. All his kindlier feelings had 
 been in a glow as he drew near, and but 
 for the premeditated act which his proud 
 tenacity deemed outrage, and of which 
 his dying grandfather's words left no du- 
 bious construction, duty and tenderness 
 would have occupied every thought, and 
 displayed themselves in every action ; he 
 had been allowed no time to consider or 
 remonstrate, to modify circumstances, to 
 concede or recede, he could neither pene- 
 trate his motives, views, aims, nor pur- 
 poses ; he only knew the cup of fate was 
 at his lips, and that in the moment he 
 first beheld a parent, he also felt a, tyrant $ 
 yet, he had apparently, and without the

 least reluctance, yielded implicit acquies- 
 cence ; — true, the whole ceremony had not 
 been pronounced, but the last awful adju- 
 ration still sounded on his appalled sense, 
 and vibrated on every chord of feeling ; 
 he threw a sad retrospective glance on the 
 poor fragile suffering frame of his con- 
 fused, abashed, and shrinking cousin, and 
 then memory reverted to the glowing 
 energies, and blooming beauties of the 
 matchless creature whose soft enchant- 
 ments had captivated his reason, and en- 
 slaved his understanding. Horror was in 
 the contrast ; he shrunk from the warring 
 conflict of agonized reflection, and while 
 burning tears were rushing down cheeks 
 flushed with strong indignant passions, the 
 house steward, with looks of affectionate 
 humility, which seemed to deprecate his 
 resentment for apparent neglect, requested

 to know if he would join Mr. Worthing- 
 ton in the saloon, or have refreshments 
 served up in his apartment ? 
 
 The old man's eyes were suffused in tears 
 before he entered, they now ran over to 
 behold the painful emotion visible in the 
 countenance of him, whose mother in 
 lisping infancy he had borne in his arms, 
 and whose cherry lips had kissed him a 
 thousand and a thousand times \ her 
 child, her only child, all that remained of 
 her on earth now stood before him, and 
 while contemplating a figure blooming in 
 youthful graces, and dignified with all the 
 improved advantages of manhood, the 
 good man struck with an involuntary re- 
 verence, sunk on his knees, and with a 
 fervor becoming a patriarch, exclaimed, 
 " God be gracious unto thee, my son ! 
 and may thy children, and the children of

 my young lady, heir the lands of De Dun- 
 stanville to the latest posterity ; then will 
 the withering virtues of the ancient stock 
 revive, then will good days come again 
 among us, then will good people be given 
 to the earth, and angels to the heavens !" 
 " To half your prayer my good and 
 pious father," replied the youth, softened 
 by his honest attachment, " my soul re- 
 sponds Amen ! the other, bearing reference 
 to myself, is too dubious in its import ; 
 the interests and affections of Jane De 
 Dunstanville must ever be distinct from 
 mine ; our names and nature are distinct, 
 they cannot blend ; yet, be you faithful 
 to your mistress, and take my thanks for 
 your kind prayers ; they are my own," 
 he added proudly, " I have nothing else I 
 can presume to give, I would be alone 
 —but stay, your chaplain must be admitted,

 he may have communications to make de- 
 manding notice, say, therefore, if you 
 please, I am ready to receive him." 
 
 The old man with looks of sorrow and 
 surprise now left the room, and as he 
 slowly closed the door, he repeated, " sad 
 times ! sad times ! I fear me sad times are 
 coming again ; well, well, heaven will be 
 a fine place, I get nearer and nearer." He 
 met the chaplain ascending the stairs, 
 and simply saying, the young gentleman 
 expected him, he passed into the servants' 
 hall, gave some necessary orders, and with 
 his usual benediction of the night to the 
 melancholy group assembled there, with 
 a heavy and predictive heart he retired 
 to bed, though not to sleep.

 CHAPTER III. 
 
 " I lament, my dear Sir, obtruding on 
 your retirement at so unseasonable an 
 hour," said the chaplain, addressing Fitz 
 Ormond with looks of kindness, and in a 
 voice of friendship ; " I do lament it, as 
 it may be supposed you would wish to 
 devote these first moments to the sacred 
 claims of sorrow, for the best of parents, 
 and of men ; but the pressing exigency, 
 the imperious necessity of one asserting 
 the right to act as heir, and co-operate 
 with me in the duties of executorship, 
 must supersede all ceremony, and even the 
 feelings of the friend and relative."

 " Mr. Worthington," interrupted the 
 youth in some agitation — " I am all atten- 
 tion, and have much to learn, and if I 
 judge aright, you are the oracle I must 
 consult, with you it rests to develope the 
 painful mystery of my present situation." 
 
 Mr. Worthington felt uneasy, and he 
 looked embarrassed. 
 
 " I trust," said he, at length, " you do 
 not affect an entire ignorance of your late 
 grandfather's wishes; only a few hours 
 since you stood beside his death-bed, his 
 dying words communicated much — you 
 heard, and for the first time, his blessing ; 
 you could not misunderstand the implied 
 conditions of that blessing, and it is fit 
 you should clearly understand the duties 
 annexed, and the consequences of their 
 failure." 
 
 " Memory shrinks disgusted from all

 except the blessing," interrupted Mr. Fitz 
 Ormond j " therefore, to you, Sir, I would 
 owe a perfect understanding of that only 
 which you consider indispensably necessary 
 for me to hear and reply to." 
 
 " The conditions, Sir, are happy, the 
 obligations easy," rejoined the chaplain ; 
 yet he could perceive they were antici- 
 pated with something of a pre-disposition 
 to reject them, happy and easy as he him- 
 self considered them. 
 
 " This parchment," he continued, il was 
 delivered open for the present purpose ; 
 briefly and simply, then, you, Hildebrande 
 Fitz Ormond, are required to drop the 
 said name, and take and bear the name 
 and arms of your maternal ancestors, that 
 of De Dunstanville, and that it may be 
 supported with its ancient splendour, an 
 interest has been secured to invest you

 with the title, now extinct by your grand- 
 father's decease." 
 
 " If you are rightly understood, Sir,'* 
 said Fitz Ormond, with haughty impa- 
 tience, " it is expected I should resign the 
 name my father gave to my mother, and 
 assume that of him who pursued that 
 father with unrelenting vengeance, and 
 who allowed that mother to sink heart- 
 broken to an early and obscure grave.'* 
 
 " Some retrospects are painful and im- 
 proper," said Mr. Worthington, mildly, 
 " often ill-timed, frequently aggravate the 
 present, and cannot meliorate the past, 
 though they may much embitter, and 
 materially interfere with the future wel- 
 fare of our lives : — but to proceed, it was 
 further the will of the deceased, that the 
 whole of the De Dunstanville estates, to- 
 gether with the immense funded property

 on your marriage with your cousin Jane, 
 reserving only for her sole, separate, and 
 exclusive use, five thousand pounds per 
 annum, with her favourite cottage and 
 grounds, called Sans Souci, adjoining the 
 forest of De Dunstanville \ and should 
 any circumstance arise to impede these 
 nuptials, or either party refuse to ratify 
 them, the said party is to be excluded, and 
 the lands, property, &c. &c. to be solely, 
 and entirely possessed by him, or her, wil- 
 ling and ready to accede to all the con- 
 ditions of Sir GeofFry's will ; should the 
 demur arise with Hiidebrande Fitz Or- 
 mond, he only to be entitled to five hun-

 per annum. I have only now to add, Mr. 
 Fitz Ormond, that your cousin, with 
 modest pleasure, accepts your vows — to 
 her gentle hand, you will owe fortunes 
 that are princely.; to her gentle heart, a 
 felic'ty rarely experienced, for she loves 
 you, has long, and ever loved you, dearer 
 than self, has loved you." 
 
 " Loves me !" repeated the youth, with 
 consternation bordering on agony, " the 
 highly-intelligent, the distinguished, the 
 noble-minded, the refined Miss De Bun- 
 stanviile, affect to love a man she had 
 never seen ?" 
 
 " Be not too confident that you have 
 never been seen," said the chaplain, — the 
 remark was unheeded. 
 
 " A delicate mind," Fitz Ormond con- 
 tinued, " would not own the degrading 
 weakness, a generous mind would disdain

 the affectation of it, even to attain the 
 dearest purposes." 
 
 " Young man, you speak of her, whose 
 worth I fear, your nature cannot appre- 
 ciate," cried the chaplain, generously vin- 
 dicating the pure feelings of a heart he 
 had assisted to form, and whose disin- 
 terested beneficence towards her cousin he 
 well knew ; " her soul is the seat of 
 honour, her mind, the residence of virtue, 
 and in her pure uncontaminated bosom, 
 blend all the gentle affections, and gene- 
 rous charities, that elevate and endear 
 superior natures ; — for you^Sir, what has 
 she not attempted, what has she not ob- 
 tained? Recollect your abject, forsaken 
 state, your misery, your ignorance, — re- 
 collect all, and when you have compared 
 it with your present condition, learn you

 owe it all to the persuasive pleading of 
 that angel." 
 
 The good man's fervid solicitude had 
 hurried him beyond the limits of his 
 usual discretion and forbearance ; at any- 
 other time, reason would have held her 
 empire, and reflection told him, "reproach 
 but corrodes the proud mind, and retards 
 the purpose it would advance." Fitz 
 Ormond's nature was high, impetuous, 
 and incontroulable, and recollection only 
 fortified him in his premeditated rejection, 
 and irritated him to super-add a cold con- 
 temptuous scorn to that rejection, which, 
 in calm reflective moments, would have 
 made his heart mourn but to think of. 
 
 " Good Sir," said he, with difficulty 
 repressing the indignant emotions as they 
 rose to his lips, " I have to thank you 
 much for your very candid enumertion of

 my incalculable, vast, and unreturnable 
 obligations, to the chanty of my mur- 
 dered mother's father ; I had long, Sir, 
 been willing to impute many of his trans- 
 gressions against that mother to misrepre- 
 sentation and malignity ; and for his boun- 
 ties to myself, did him reverence j but you 
 teach me, that to him my debt is cancelled ; 
 —to me, ever alike unkind and unjust ; in 
 his favourite, he indulged an eccentric 
 wild caprice; and at her bidding, I was per- 
 mitted to grow beneath the influence of 
 his imagined beneficence, therefore, to her 
 I must transfer the vast sum of obligation; 
 to her, whom you denominate an angel. 
 I would most willingly offer my obeisance 
 to such transcendant charms, (he added 
 with cold sarcasm) but would first inquire 
 what new sphere of beauty your investi- 
 gating eye has discovered, for too surely

 your angel is of a peculiar order, and as 
 yet but little known, and, I should think, 
 less acknowledged." 
 
 " Unmannered, and unmanly ! know, 
 to your everlasting confusion — " 
 
 Fitz Ormond calmly stopped him. 
 
 " We waste the moments, Mr. Wor- 
 thingtdn, both have purposes which claim 
 attention, take charge then of my grati- 
 tude to Miss De Dunstanville, for kind- 
 nesses and intentions which from her I 
 never did deserve, and from her I never 
 can deserve ; the consciousness of my 
 own demerits, and estranged heart, tell 
 me I can have no pretensions to her future 
 notice, nor can she have any hope of my 
 acquiescence ; I proudly determine to pre- 
 serve a father's name, to proudly justify a 
 destroyed mother j I will proudly labour 
 for rny daily bread ; I will proudly assert,

 and I will proudly cherish, my soul's dear- 
 est affection ; — I may perish, but will 
 never forsake her to whom I have plighted 
 my faith and my honour, and to whose 
 matchless virtues, my heart offers a ho- 
 mage chaste, pure, fervid, and holy ; to Sir 
 Geoffry's possessions — I disclaim all pre- 
 tension — my rejection of his heiress, se- 
 cures all her own. I disclaim every par- 
 ticipation of his fortune ; it would impose 
 on me the horrors of the worst of per- 
 juriesj and the miseries of constrained 
 duties; under the specious names of 
 affluence and felicity, it would bind every 
 heaven-born irm affection — it would bind 
 every generous feeling with the galling 
 fetters of parental tyranny; my spirit 
 shrinks indignant from such hard demands 
 on duty, spurns such slavish conditions, 
 and every better principle will assert itself.

 I can return to my native poverty and 
 rags, but will never dim the honour of 
 an upright mind, never barter the pure 
 homage of the heart, for the tinsel trap- 
 pings of wealth. 
 
 " Yes !" continued he, a glow of dig- 
 nified pride irradiating every fine feature 
 of his youthful face, and imparting a bright 
 superiority to his whole figure, " I will

 CHAPTER IV. 
 
 The orphan heiress was calm and col- 
 lected in her manner ; a modest grace 
 and softened dignity uniting with the 
 enfeebling effects of a recent and severe 
 illness, which had nearly deprived her of 
 life, gave to her tall fragile form, an air 
 scarcely mortal ; she could not be said to 
 captivate, but her mild and melancholy 
 manner inspired an inttrest bordering 
 almost en anguish, and a feeling of reve- 
 rence, as if an impassive being had appear- 
 ed before them ; her accents when she 
 spoke, were low and tremulous, yet they 
 sunk upon the heart impressive, and those 
 unhappy features which had excited such 
 risings of disgust in the bosom of her

 cousin, and drawn forth such bitter sar- 
 casm, were now undistinguishable ; for, 
 added to the pale gleam of a single taper, 
 which faintly lighted up the chamber, she 
 had thrown a thick black veil over her 
 head, that shrouded her face in almost an 
 impenetrable gloom. 
 
 " Dear Miss De Dunstanville ! how 
 came you here ?" exclaimed Mr. Wor- 
 thington,in alarm, as she approached, while 
 her cousin's humanity, prevailing over pre- 
 judice, with even a lover's haste, supported 
 her to a sofa ; indeed, a timid graceful- 
 ness, an indefinable charm, a nameless 
 something about her, strangely affected 
 him, and every soft, every better feeling 
 of his nature rose in array against him, 
 as he thought on the ungracious words he 
 had uttered of one whose gentleness seem- 
 ed to woo a sustaining hand to help it,

 instead of being crushed by the rude tongue 
 of undeserved and severe reproach. 
 
 She bowed to both as she extended her 
 hand to the chaplain, saying, " Fear 
 nothing for me, my friend, I have a pur- 
 pose that will support me through these 
 moments, fearful as they seem ; acquit 
 me, gentlemen, of the meanness of pre- 
 meditated listening, though I own having 
 been an auditress of your conference." 
 
 Young Fitz Ormond shrunk within 
 himself, confused and abashed, as she spoke; 
 she had heard his cruel, scornful remarks 
 on tibs deformity of her features — to apo- 
 logise, to even speak, he felt impossible, 
 without increasing his own confusion. 
 
 She went on — " A desire no way unna- 
 tural, and therefore unnecessary to ex- 
 plain, induced me to remain when I heard 
 myself and my concerns the subject of

 to perform more than common duties, but 
 with this difference, I cannot rise super-

 I can only be just to myself and to you. 
 I would have you banish the uneasy re- 
 membrance that I know your opinions ; it 
 may interfere with our arrangements for

 you, that my frightful deformity of fea- 
 tures extends not to the mind ; you can- 
 not be happy wkh me, but I can make 
 you happy without me 5 you may then for-

 held him mute and immoveable ; but rapid 
 was the succession of unutterable thought ; 
 .sorrow, shame, pride, gratitude, regret, 
 all blending assailed his bosom at once,

 too much for human endurance ; he gazed

 covered with tears, in her robe ; she al- 
 lowed some moments for his emotion to 
 subside, when with her own voice weak-

 " I have none of these to give you," 
 she cried, her voice scarcely audible from 
 inward sobs, " Oh ! go, while I have power 
 to bid you, go ; temper your feelings, 
 moderate your passions, be happy/' 
 
 " Tremendous powers ! whose words, 
 whose tones, were these I heard ?" he ex- 
 claimed, wringing her hands, " mildest,

 brain to madness, and fill me with imagin-

 " True/' said Jane, rising, " and here

 detaining her with a look of wild and 
 strange anguish, " what, beloved cousin \ 
 should we ever meet again !" " You will 
 know me," she replied, withdrawing her 
 hand from his impassioned grasp, and 
 with a groan of irrepressible anguish, she 
 rushed from the apartment. 
 
 The chaplain now bade him a cold and 
 formal good-night ; but lost in gloomy 
 and wild abstracted thoughts, motionless 
 as the statue he stood, and neither heard 
 his salute, nor observed his departure 5 
 the soft echo of the enchanting tones he 
 had last heard still vibrated on his ear, and 
 sense was inaccessible to any ruder sound*

 CHAPTER V. 
 
 Sir GeofFry De Dunstanville was born 
 with the high and impetuous passions of 
 a great and uncomman mind ; honour, 
 truth, the strictest integrity, and the truest 
 benevolence, governed all his actions ; his 
 every principle was implanted by the hand 
 of Heaven, and ennobled human nature j 
 but his pride and prejudices were the 
 cultivation of the world ; superior birth, 
 immense possessions, and uncontrolled 
 power, are bad correctives of human 
 infirmities ; Sir Geoffry's birth cherished 
 his native pride, his wealth strengthened 
 and supported his hereditary prejudices, 
 and his power enabled him, too much for 
 his own tranquillity, to encourage and

 JANE DE DUNSTANVILLE. 45 
 
 gratify resentments, which created woes 
 that only terminated in the grave. His 
 liberalities were unbounded, and his 
 beneficence diffusive ; he was the orphan's 
 father, and the widow's friend ; the support 
 of the neglected, and the solace of the 
 afflicted ; he prevented application, and 
 retreated from acknowledgement ; " / 
 want" he would say " are too humiliating 
 from one mortal to another ; bitter to 
 speak ; painful to hear ; our mighty dis- 
 tinctions, what are they ? the soundings of 
 of a name, perishable dross, and a few 
 acres of that earth which must one day 
 cover the proudest. Half the calamities of 
 human life," he would add, " may be 
 attributed to our never feeling Jbr others 
 what a beneficent God has shielded us 
 from feeling in ourselves" Such was Sir 
 GeofTry's system of charity. His mind

 was highly intelligent, and his understand- 
 ing brilliant y his figure graceful and manly, 
 and his countenance open and finely 
 expressive ; his ancestors had been among 
 the first baronets, and glorying in the 
 ancient distinction, he preferred the honour- 
 able bad?"e of the bloody hand, which had 
 been gained in a bloody field, to the higher 
 sounding peerage purchased by gold, or 
 patronage. His ancestors had distinguish- 
 ed themselves both in the cabinet and the 
 field; his grandfather, after having 
 signalized himself at the battle of the 
 Boyne, and received the thanks and 
 embrace of the victorious William, fell 
 dead at the feet of his monarch by a pistol 
 ball from the hand of an Irish officer in 
 the service of the abdicated James ; Sir 
 Anthony De Dunstanville had twice dis- 
 armed this dastard, and the last time, as

 victory was sounding, gave him his life \ 
 instead of having inspired gratitude, the 
 mortifying remembrance rankled in a 
 malignant heart, which burned with the 
 savage desire of revenge ; and he resolved 
 to take the life of him who had so gene- 
 rously spared his own ; his aim was too 
 well directed, and the hero, while glowing 
 \*iith victory, dropped a corpse. That this 
 atrocious deed was perpetrated by an 
 Irishman, falsely and fatally established an 
 indignant and implacable hatred in the 
 De Dunstanville family against the whole 
 nation, and by having been cherished, it 
 became in time a hereditary principle ; and 
 circumstances, in Sir GeofTry's life, blew 
 the latent spark into a fierce and destroy- 
 ing flame. 
 
 Early in life he married Lady Eglentine, 
 only daughter of the Earl of Clancarroii ;

 who, in the first year of their union, made 
 him the father of a blooming boy, that 
 gave early promise of being their pride 
 and blessing ; to increase their felicity, 
 again his beautiful wife drew near her 
 time, and gave a new throb of anticipated 
 delight. 
 
 " Ah ! thoughtless mortals, ever blind to fate, 
 Too soon dejected, and too soon elate. " -« 
 
 The event proved the pious divine right 
 who says, " our comforts become Jailing." 
 Lady Eglentine gave him a daughter ; 
 blessed her boy, blessed her innocent 
 murdress, and casting a nameless look 
 upon her husband, expired. 
 
 The life which had rendered Sir 
 Geoffry's life delightful, was now no 
 more ; but the lisping voice of his boy, and 
 the soft beseeching eye of little Eglen- 
 tine, which beamed with a mother's 
 sweetness, reminded him he was a father.

 The brother and sister were reared 
 beneath their father's indulgent eye, in 
 the solitary grandeur of De Dunstanville 
 Abbey j they had all the advantages of a 
 superior education, but little acquainted 
 with the usages of society ; no controul 
 over their actions, and accustomed to the 
 voluntary homage of the household and 
 tenantry, no wonder that feeling, in their 
 ardent and guileless bosoms, reached a 
 degree of enthusiasm that bordered on 
 romance *, Sir Geoffry perceived the error 
 of his system in the innocent flights of 
 their vivid imagination, and, to counteract 
 the growing evil, he sent his son to Eton, 
 and engaged a lady of finished education 
 and manners to attend his daughter in the 
 polished circles of life. Miss De Dunstan- 
 ville was more interesting than attractive,

 but once loved, she was loved for ever ; 
 her gentleness and goodness made her her 
 father's pleasure, but his son was his pride 
 and delight ; he thought him superior of 
 his kind, and, with paternal exultation, in 
 idea, beheld him the bright representative 
 of an illustrious and virtuous ancestry;

 father, " my son will be myself \ he will

 worlds, tell my Eglentine he is her son" 
 
 Sir Geoffry's expectations of his son 
 were well founded ; his talents, morals, 
 dispositions, and figure, were all superior, 
 and the father believed he could not be 
 happier till this darling son, after a visit to 
 his mother's relations, presented as his 
 bride his cousin Lady Jane Clancarron ;

 for mild, modest, and retiring as the pale 
 primrose of the spring, though she had

 ungenial soil of a rough Hebridean shore,

 altogether devoted to her youthful 
 husband, who in return loved her with 
 the chastest fervour. She had no dower, 
 and the reduced fortunes of the house of 
 Clancarron, had obliged the widowed 
 countess, with her son and daughter, to 
 seclude themselves in their old solitary 
 castle ; for the pride of birth was strong, 
 and she could not descend from the 
 elevated sphere in which she had moved

 every maternal feeling, and as the young 
 earl was amiable and handsome, her 
 expectations for him were unbounded, his 
 conquests were extending, and very few 
 of the wealthiest Caledonian lassies would 
 have refused the poor peer of Clancarron ; 
 one in particular breathed many a sigh 
 behind her coronet, and would have given 
 it altogether for his blue bonnet, and 
 goud in goupins to have been rowed in 
 his tartan plaid ; but it was reserved for a 
 fair maiden of the borders ; he had accom- 
 panied his sister to De Dunstanville, and 
 no sooner did he behold Eglentine, than 
 he felt her the arbitress of his future 
 destiny; but he had little to hope, for 
 though she would dance, walk, and jest 
 with him ; sing, play, and listen to him, 
 and often call him her own dear, dear, 
 Highland laddie, it was all done with that

 ease and singleness of thought, that spoke 
 a heart uninterested. The idea of such an 
 union was to Sir Geoffry most gratifying ; 
 but Eglentine's heart, as she said, was her 
 very own ; and when urged on the subject, 
 v/ith candour she replied, that indeed she 
 loved her cousin dearly, but then it was 
 her cousin that she did love, but as Earl 
 Archy Clancarron, Eglentine said, she must 
 declare, that if his wife, and obliged to love 
 him, why she should not be able to love

 De Dunstanville left the abbey for the gay 
 metropolis, and the full gantlet of pleasure 
 was run through all its novelties, when 
 Lady Jane's pregnancy obliged her to

 beneath the turrets of De Dunstanville, 
 orders "were given to prepare for their 
 departure. It was thought Eglentine grew 
 rather pale at the intimation, but it was 
 a thought to which none gave utterance. 
 
 During their residence in London, Sir 
 Geoffry had paid the visit of a month to 
 an old friend. in Norfolk, and while he was 
 absent, his son was in the habit of frequent- 
 ing a library celebrated for its early publica-

 or political ; and there he had contracted 
 an intimacy, which was fast ripening into 
 friendship, with a young Irishman of the 
 ancient house of Fitz Ormond ; the innate 
 virtues of this youth glowed in his fine 
 open countenance ; for he possessed one of 
 those faces which tell the character at a 
 look ; and the graces of his manner invited 
 every observant eye to a near contempla"

 tion of that worth, which distinguished 
 his nature. The soul of Mr. De Dunstan- 
 ville was unfettered by the narrowing 
 prejudices which gave a shade to his 
 father's character, and for this youth lis 
 felt the sentiment which unites mind to 
 mind. He had visited at the house with 
 easy freedom, and before the brother was 
 aware, the hapless Eglentine's innocent 
 speaking looks> plainly said, " my heart is 
 in Fitz Ormond's keeping." They both 
 loved ; their love was madness, yet they 
 loved ; youth, beauty, innocence, honour, 
 and a brother, sanctioned the passion ; but 
 the deep-rooted hatred and prejudices of 
 Sir Geoffry filled them with boding horror ; 
 and when too late, the affectionate brother 
 regretted the error he had committed. 
 All he could do, was to promise his interest 
 and persuasions, when happy circumstances

 might offer opportunity. The lovers 
 often met in public ; difficulty only threw 
 a charm over their attachment, and hope, 
 with her fairy colours, was dressing the 
 future in felicity, when fate, as if determin- 
 ed to raise adamantine barriers between 
 them, blighted their prospect, and buried 
 all in the grave of disappointment. 
 
 Sir Geoffry had one morning accom- 
 panied his son to the library, when having 
 perused a newspaper with marks of strong 
 indignation, he threw it down, saying, 
 while long dormant, yet unsubdued 
 prejudice burst forth, " The assassinations 
 of these savage Irishmen really disgrace 
 humanity ; they are lost to humanity now 
 as when buried in their native barbarity 
 centuries ago."

 officer, seated opposite, the fire of venge^

 through his face, "And what may you

 all his palaver of humanity, can brand a

 ders the body, and arrah by my soul, you 
 do worse, for you murder the whole cha- 
 racter y who then is the worst assassin ?" 
 
 Mr. De Dunstanville was sensible that 
 his father's unqualified invective was re- 
 prehensible, and had excited the vengeance 
 of an implacable spirit. 
 
 " The expression was inadvertent," 
 said he, rising and addressing the Hiber- 
 nian with respect, " it certainly, Sir, was 
 inadvertent, for this gentleman's opinion 
 is confined to an injury done his family

 ance ; yet the spirit of vengeance glared 
 in his dark rolling eye-balls, his jaws were 
 distended wide, but no sound issued, and 
 as some gentlemen present forcibly held 
 him from venting his rage on the youth, 
 the foam dropped from his blue lips, his 
 teeth gnashed, and he fell exhausted among 
 them.

 rushed through his veins ; a tumult of 
 glowing hopes sprung up in his heart, and 
 enraptured by Sir Geoffry's praise, he had

 He durst not encounter her eye, durst 
 not trust his voice to answer her, and his 
 son, feeling his embarassment, added, " we 
 must own, my Jenny, our purpose is not 
 very charitable either, for we are engaged 
 to go a shooting," 
 
 " Shooting ! " she repeated inconsci- 
 ously, " how barbarous ! you will then 
 widow the wife, orphan the nestling, and

 Her voice spoke deadly omen on the 
 father's ear ; when to change the subject, 
 Mr. De Dunstanville begged Eglentine to 
 take her harp, while he gallantly took the 
 hands of his wife ; saying, 
 
 " And I loved her the more when I heard, , 
 Such tenderness flow from her tongue." 
 
 " One of your blithest lilts, Eglentine,'* 
 said her brother.

 " But I am not in a blithe humour," 
 she replied, drawing her fingers over the 
 strings carelessly ; " however, Lord Clan- 
 car ron, with your help we can try ' the 
 flower of love lies bleeding.' " 
 
 " c The flower of love lies bleeding ?'" 
 repeated her brother, the gloom of thought 
 stealing over his features, " O Conor's 
 child, I think, is that your blithest air, 
 Eglentine ?" 
 
 " Very fit for a dirge," cried her father, 
 " Eglentine is rather unfortunate in her 
 selection of blithe airs." 
 
 " Dear Sir," said she, vexed almost to 
 tears, which gave involuntary meaning to 
 "her tones, ■" though it be Irish, I thought 
 it might please in a Highland dress." 
 
 The father arose to conceal a boding 
 agitation, when his daughter, apprehensive 
 she had said too much, played several

 Scotch airs, and soothed all to apparent 
 harmony. 
 
 Next morning Sir Geoffry and his son 
 arose very early -, their alleged shooting 
 party prevented suspicion. " Within one 
 hour," said Sir Geoffry, and he was on 
 his knees, I may have* precipitated a fellow 
 being into an unchangeable state, with 
 heavy imperfections on his head, aad in 
 the awful day of reckonings what charac- 
 ter will be on the surviving spirit, alas ! 
 the hero on earth may be a demon there ; 
 .but I cannot recede — Father, be merciful 
 to thine erring creatures !'* 
 
 And he was merciful. 
 
 Sir Geoffry and his son found Major 
 MacDermot, his second, and a surgeon, 
 waiting on the appointed spot. Sir Geoffry 
 bowed, " Major Mac Dermot as this ren- 
 contre may prove fatally decisive to one,

 or both, allow me the hope that the 
 youth whose interposition did his nature 
 honour, though it offended you, is for- 
 given." 
 
 Mac Dermot smiled malignly ; remem- 
 brance rankled in his embittered heart, 
 and gnawing his lips with a look of spite, 
 he repeated, t( forgiven him ! no, nor for- 
 gotten him neither ; and that he may not 
 forget me, I have left him a shilling good 
 Irish money, to drink a good journey to 
 me this morning, or to buy a rope to 
 help him on his own to-morrOw." 
 
 Sir Geoffry retreated indignant, poor 
 Fitz Ormond ! and he looked towards hi& 
 son — he was understood j and operations 
 commenced. 
 
 The ground was measured, the pistols

 word, fire — when three men were seen 
 hastening toward them ; for a moment 
 intention was supendcd, and the next 
 they were in the hands of justice. Mr. 
 De Dunstanville secretly exulted ; the 
 father surrendered with calmness and dig- 
 nity, but the Hibernian's fury knew no 
 bounds, but submission. The magistrate, 
 before whom they were taken, bound each 
 party over to keep the peace for three 
 years \ themselves in five thousand pounds 
 each, and their sureties in two thousand ; 
 Sir GeofFry calmly submitted ; but the 
 disappointed vengeance of his ruthless 
 opponent gave some idea of a demon, and 
 though for a time no sound issued from 
 his whitened lips, he looked some mean- 
 ing, dark, hidden, deep, and terrific y at

 sion lurked in his glaring eye, than what 
 the ear heard. 
 
 " Aye," he said, " you shall have secu- 
 rity ; Sir Geoffry now is safe, quite safe/* 
 he repeated, and then sunk into the gloom 
 of unuttered thought. 
 
 The ladies had been altogether strangers 
 to this transaction, and that the voice of 
 rumour with its many tongues might not 
 reach them, their departure from town 
 was instantly resolved on. 
 
 The evening before, Mr. De Dunstan- 
 ville had an interview with young Fitz 
 Ormond, and they exchanged assurances 
 of lasting friendship ; and Mr. De Dun- 
 stanville promised to promote his wishes 
 with Eglentine to the utmost ; and though 
 he could not desire him to hope, he beg- 
 ged he would not despair'; and thus the

 generous friends parted never to meet 
 again. 
 
 Once Mr, De Dunstanville ventured to 
 mention the subject ; but alas ! it is diffi- 
 cult to drag from the firm bosom of age, 
 the prejudices imbibed and cherished in 
 youth ; Sir Geoffry coldly replied to his 
 praises of Fitz Ormond, that he had but 
 two wishes on that subject \ one that the 
 young man might reconcile himself to 
 his boisterous kinsman, and the other, that 
 he might never more hear of the name of 
 either. 
 
 Poor Eglentine still breathed the secret- 
 sigh, but said nothing ; Lord Clancarton, 
 he too sighed, but his wishes advanced 
 nothing; and only that Sir Geoffry 's whole 
 attention was now occupied by the inte- 
 resting situation of Lady Jane, it is likely 
 his authority would have interposed to

 complete an engagement which had no 
 secondary place among his wishes. 
 
 It was drawing towards the close of a 
 very sultry day, when the sun, sinking 
 beyond the distant hills, diffused a sof- 
 tened radiance over the face of nature j 
 its last brightenings were glittering through 
 the trees, and the evening breezes, rising 
 soft and cool, exhaled unnumbered odours 
 from the variegated shrubs and flowers 
 which grew in wild profusion ; there was 
 a hallowed stillness in the calm declining 
 day, that inspired a pleasing melancholy in 
 the meditative mind, and invited Sir 
 Geoffry and his beloved daughter-in-law 
 to wander forth ; he was soothing her spi- 
 rits, now rather depressed, with the sweet- 
 est hopes of coming joy, and in ail the 
 pride of a parental heart, pointed out 
 many an intended improvement that would

 enrich the expected darling : and if Lady 
 Jane did not feel animated, her gentle 
 nature assumed its appearance, and with 
 an attempt at gaiety she cried, " Dear Sir, 
 let us now seek out our virtuoso 5 he 
 does deserve to share our ramble, yet lest 
 some chrysalis or fossil should become my 
 rival, let us explore his secret haunts." 
 
 Mr. De Dunstanville was a great ad- 
 mirer of nature's works, and in a small 
 conservatory among the ruins of an old 
 convent, he passed many a satisfied hour. 
 The path way lay through a winding ave- 
 nue of ancient oaks, which sublime in their 
 awful gloom, almost precluded the setting 
 sun-beam. 
 
 Nature was now sinking into solemn, 
 and serene repose; the evening breeze 
 blew softly over the long grass of the 
 valley, and the murmur of distant waters

 sounded mournfully sweet upon the pen- 
 sive ear ; the moon was rising from her 
 bed of silvery clouds, and her pale diffusive 
 beam shed modest lustre over the deep- 
 ending shadows of coming night ; they 
 had emerged from the forest, and found 
 themselves at the entrance of the wide ex- 
 tending ruin. 
 
 " How sweetly solemn .is this quiet 
 hour, my dear father," said Lady Jane, 
 " it inspires the apprehensive mind with 
 that holy calm that gives anticipation of 
 superior worlds ; my loved companion I" 
 she cried, a sweet rapture kindling in 
 her pure bosom, " my soul's companion, 
 why art thou not here to share this hak 
 lowed moment ?' 
 
 A sudden breeze springing up, the 
 anxious father grew apprehensive of her 
 taking cold, and proposed returning

 to the conservatory, and Mr. De Dunstan- 
 ville would return with them." 
 
 They quickened their steps, and reach- 
 ing the building, ascended the flight of 
 steps, and called, and called again. All 
 was silent — all was still ; it was uncusto- 
 mary, but the key was left in the door ; 
 they entered — something of confusion was 
 visible ; shells, fossils, pieces of mecha- 
 nism, and telescopes, were all scattered in 
 disorder. 
 
 A strange indescribable fear suspended 
 speech — when, horror to the senses, a pistol 
 laying on the floor met her eye ; she 
 claspt her hands in agony, and dreading 
 she knew not what, rapid as the lightning's 
 flash she descended the steps, then, with 
 her hands pressed on temples bursting

 with unutterable thought, she flew wildly 
 through the ruins. 
 
 Sir Geoffry, in equal alarm, but more 
 collected, supported her in his arms, and 
 would have gently forced her from the 
 place, but she resisted his effort. 
 
 " I will seek him," she cried, breathing 
 short, " these shrinkings — these forebod- 
 ings, oh— my father ! my father ! where 
 is my husband ?" 
 
 An indistinct noise struck faintly on the 
 ear, 
 
 " What was that V*

 The sound was heard again. 
 
 " That is a dreadful something, father, 
 hark !" 
 
 " Beloved Jane, calm these terrors,

 gone."

 f Aye, it flits ; boder of horror, what

 A lengthened groan now mingled with 
 the rising breeze, and with it sunk in sad- 
 dened murmur. A cold horror, resembling 
 the chill of death, ran through the veins 
 of Sir Geoffry ; but in pity to her he held, 
 he repressed the agony of thought ; she 
 st opt, and rested her shaking frame against 
 an old_pillar } the melancholy wind stole 
 through the trees, and a moaning sounded 
 near ; every aching sense felt maddened, 
 when a favourite and faithful pointer was 
 seen leaping above the long lank grass 
 which skirted the tomb-stones, and, on 
 reaching a broken arch, he stopt, and set 
 up a fearful yell. 
 
 Sir Geoffry darted forward, the wife 
 staggered after, and beheld Mr. De Dun- 
 stanville, pale, wounded, and expiring.

 Aghast with speechless horror, stood the 
 wretched father ; the wife, in the deaden- 
 ing calm of an unutterable despair, knelt 
 beside her worshipped, dying husband. 
 She pressed her quivering lips to his chilly 
 cheek — the pale anguish of approaching 
 death convulsed every feature, and the 
 drops of departing life hung on his sunk- 
 en brow ; his white lip was still, his half- 
 closed eye beamless,and the crimson stream, 
 in which he lay weltering, no longer gush- 
 ed from the gaping wound in his bosom ; 
 life was receding fast, and the latest pul- 
 sation was about to throb, when the wife's 
 groan of " My husband! oh ! — " struck 
 the fleeting spirit ; for one moment, the 
 fainting powers revived, the darkened eye 
 was raised, the clammy lip unclosed, one 
 weak pressure of the nerveless hand was

 scious clay rested in the widow's arms, and 
 the spirit, guided by angels, ascended to the 
 everlasting beatitudes. 
 
 The widow felt that feeling which can 
 never be felt long ; no shriek, no groan, 
 no tear, was heard or seen ; she felt alter- 
 nate burnings and deadly chills ; sudden 
 pangs, a mother's pangs, with rending 
 throbs, assailed her poor frame 5 she clasped 
 her murdered husband in her arms, and, 
 in a voice that demons might have pitied, 
 she cried, " Dead ! my husband dead ! 
 I shared his sinless life, his sinless love ; his 
 sinless death, and his heaven I will share,

 GeofFry from the fatal ruins.

 by the glaring malignity of still unsated 
 vengeance, and discovered Mac Dermot.

 bosom to a hell ; he turned the bold,

 torture; the barbed arrow of remorse, 
 of eternal gnawing remorse, struck his 
 heart, and the raging fires grew pale ; he 
 had thirsted for revenge, and now in 
 burning blasts it recoiled upon himself; 
 to fight had been his glory, but to murder 
 was disgrace ; pangs seized his vitals ; 
 frenzy seized his brain, and as the attend-

 CHAPTER VII. 
 
 The riches of Major Mac Dermot had made 
 many candidates to his favour, and busy 
 tongues were ready to inform him of the 
 intimacy which had subsisted between Fits 
 Ormond and Mr. De Dunstanville ; and 
 the satisfaction visible in his intelligent 
 countenance on his return from the blood- 
 less encounter, he attributed to some secret 
 collusion between them, and he loaded the 
 youth with the most bitter reproaches, 
 and imprecated horrific wishes on his own 
 head, if he ever more would hear of his 
 name; a deed which left him heir to his 
 vast fortune, he had destroyed, so that 
 poor Fitz Ormond had only to remember 
 what he might have been.

 He was now further than ever removed

 dignity of innocence and a nobie pride 
 supported him, and, during a pause for 
 breath in the fury of his raving kinsman,

 the hours he was absent, alone, and in 
 prayer ; and added, that it was young Mr: 
 De Dunstanville who had given informa-

 The poor valet's intention was good j

 monstration not to be doubted, that a gen- 
 tleman had left Sir Geoffry's house the 
 evening before, and been traced to Bow 
 Street, he thought it must be the son as 
 the one most interested in Sir Geoffry's 
 safety.

 of Mac Dermot, and kindling a hell in his

 at De Dunstanville ; to avoid human inter- 
 position and prevention, he resolved to<

 and an unending day.

 prove a blank not worth preservation, he 
 resolved on entering the army ; the fatal 
 circumstances that had occured at the 
 Abbey of De Dunstanville, had not reach*

 fatigue, he was seized with a fever, which 
 confined him many days to bed ; and it was

 calamitous circumstances which had hap-

 broken hearted Fitz Ormond, he will soon, 
 very soon, be forgotten ; I feel my heart 
 giving way, and my head will soon be low ; 
 no tear will fall now from Eglentine for 
 me, she is lost." 
 
 Fitz Ormond felt a gloomy resolution 
 nerve his heart, and next morning, being 
 still too weak to walk, he ordered a post 
 chaise for De Dunstanville. 
 
 " Once more I will see the angel, and 
 then—." 
 
 On his arrival at a little country inn on 
 the borders of the forest, he was obliged 
 from weakness to rest a few hours, when 
 ordering the chaise to be ready at a certain 
 hour, he wandered forth, and entered the 
 village 5 his eye was attracted by an old

 white-headed man, in the De Dunstanville 
 livery, seated on a rustic bench with a 
 flowing can, to which he invited Fitz Or- 
 mond, from pity as well as pleasure, for he 
 looked pale and exhausted. " Drink, Sir/' 
 said he, " you be right sure of welcome to 
 my toast ; the De Dunstanville family ; we 
 have had a sad dark night, but the Lord 
 be blessed, the day dawns cheerly again ; Sir 
 GeofFry is getting well, our late master's 
 young lady will have the lands, and to 
 crown all, our own pretty flower, as we 
 call Miss Eglentine, will now keep the 
 commandments, and honour her father,

 crept through his veins.

 cried the old man, " belike you have heard 
 though, how we all feared, and it made 
 Sir Geoffry mad, that our young Miss had 
 a hankering after one Fitz Ormond, the 
 bastard of the murderer of our dear young 
 master." 
 
 Fitz Ormond started from his seat. 
 
 " Aye you may well start, Sir, the father

 that ; and he prayed her to take his bless-

 midnight, to see the grand to-do, the 
 chapel lighted with lamps of essence, the 
 Thelamium sung, an ox roasted to-morrow, 
 ale in buckets, wine in bowls, and all gay 
 and glad again." 
 
 " Glad and gay again !" repeated Fitz 
 Ormond abstractedly — " Yes, Sir, — so take 
 the cup to Miss Eglentine's health ; and 
 here,'* he added, tossing off a glass himself, 
 " happiness to the bride ! when the clock 
 strikes twelve Eglentine will be Lady 
 Clancarron." 
 
 The cup fell, and in a tempest of 
 agonized feeling, Fitz Ormond darted from 
 their sight. 
 
 " Only one step," cried the poor 
 wretch ; his reason was gone, and he stood 
 on the brink of a foaming river, — " only

 and he had been the next moment— where 
 —Oh ! God, where ! 
 
 " Your honour, you have forgotten 
 me sure," and Fitz Ormond felt his arm 
 grasped ; he started, yet the voice was 
 neither deep nor sepulchral ; the figure 
 neither tall nor spectral ; old Adam had 
 fears for a fellow being's wits, and the 
 postilion had fears for his money, and so 
 Fitz Ormond had been pursued ; he turned 
 to his preserver j " I thank you, you may 
 leave me." 
 
 " May I! But I came, your honour 
 for—" 
 
 " Do not name it, no do not friend, I

 u Pay it, my good lad ? what can pay 
 you for a human being's soul ?" 
 
 " I can't exactly tell that, your honour, 
 I only wants to be paid for my horses

 A moments reflection told Fitz Ormond, 
 each had misunderstood the other ; he felt 
 confused, abashed, and ashamed that he 
 had betrayed his purpose ; but recovering, 
 he paid the demand, gave the fellow a 
 crown for himself, and ordered him to 
 have the chaise two hours hence at the 
 turn-pike gate, 
 
 Fitz Ormond's intentions were now 
 indefinite as indefineable, yet one was 
 strong and uncontrollable ; to behold 
 Eglentine — and there intention ceased, it 
 could go no farther j but where, or how, 
 or when ?

 seen a big dog? The Lord at the abbey 
 offers five guineas for un, for the bride 
 likes un so mainly ; I seed her go to yon 
 mauslum her ownself, for she never 
 fears the goblins nor the ghostesses there, 
 not she." 
 
 " Is, is the bride there now ?" asked 
 
 Fitz Ormond, his heart palpitating with the 
 wildest throbs. 
 
 " Belike no," replied the boy, " as she 
 must be married to-night." 
 
 To tread on the earth trodden by Eglen- 
 tine, was something, and Fitz Ormond 
 hastened on his way to the monument 
 erected to the memory of De Dunstanville 
 and his Jane. 
 
 He drew near the hallowed spot, where

 involved all around, and a low chilly 
 wind was sighing through the trees \ a 
 widowed ring-dove from its solitary nest 
 in pitious cooings blended with the even- 
 ing's breeze, and the melancholy sound of 
 distant waters, all mingling, formed a 
 concert well suited to Fitz Ormond's 
 feelings. 
 
 The streaming splendour of the full 
 moon, guided his aching eye to the low 
 unhonoured stone, which marked a greatly 
 sinning mortal's grave; it was Mac Dermot's ; 
 it was without the verge of holy ground ; 
 his dust was refused a resting place within 
 the holy pale, for it was the drear abode of 
 one who had been a murderer, and a self- 
 murderer. 
 
 Fitz Ormond stood aghast, his heart 
 swelled, and with frantic effort he twined 
 his arms round the recording stone ; and,

 if in human strength, would have torn it 
 from its earthy bed. The tumult of 
 feeling was almost too much for his 
 enfeebled frame, and he burst into tears. 
 " Yes," he cried, pressing the unconscious 
 stone ; " low and dishonoured as is thy 
 dust, deformed with crimes, and perished, 
 yet shall one tear of gratitude bedew thy 
 re!ics,farewell,lost being — for ever farewell." 
 
 He turned towards the grove of cypress 
 which embosomed the monument of De 
 Dunstanviiie ; with awe he entered the 
 hallowed sanctuary; a low br v eath reached 
 his ear ; it might be the night wind ; but 
 he listened, and heard a deepened sigh, 
 yet he feared nothing ; he heard his own 
 name ; " Fitz Ormond ! Oh ! Fit z Ormond !" 
 
 He started. 
 
 " Farewell ! — a long, a last farewell, too 
 dearly loved Fitz Ormond ! Spirit of De

 brother, open thy cold arms, open and 
 save thy sister from a father's curse, and 
 from Clancarron's bridal bed, thy stiffening 
 arms were Heaven." 
 
 The bells from De Dunstanville church 
 struck up a merry peal — " That sound is 
 the doom, of peace ; Oh ! Clancarron, any 
 refuge for a wretch, any but thy honest 
 bosom ! — " 
 
 " Find it here for ever, then!" and Eglen- 
 tine De Dunstanville was folded in the 
 arms of Fitz Ormond. 
 
 " Here, thou blessed one, in the fond 
 sanctuary of a heart so pure, so warm, so 
 holy in its passion for thee, that angels 
 may feel, and angels own it."

 ardent wishes of Clancarron, to pay a last

 despairing visit to her brother's tomb, 
 and she had yielded so much, that no 
 one yentured to oppose her melancholy 
 purpose. She now reclined within her 
 lover's arms ; she raised her head, and fixed 
 her eyes upon his face, and shuddering, 
 would have struggled to be gone; but he 
 held her with tender force. 
 
 " Oh ! Eglentine," he cried, in strong 
 impassioned agony -, " I know all, I have 
 heard all, when the clock strikes twelve— " 
 
 Eglentine groaned, and wrung her cold 
 hands in the anguish of thought, she fixed 
 her burning eyes upon him. 
 
 " Fitz Ormond, tempt not my shrinking 
 soul." 
 
 " Life of my life," he cried, "be merciful, 
 spare me ! Bethink thee, my blessed one,

 spare me, blessed one, spare thy beloved

 She cast upon him an unutterable look, 
 her hands were clasped, her lips closed, and 
 her poor heart felt bursting with conflict- 
 ing agony. 
 
 A father's love and blessing ; a father's 
 'bitter hate, and utter reprobation, rushed 
 rapidly through her burning brain ; and 
 she shivered in the pangs of irresolution ; 
 thought reverted to a scene of horror, her 
 feet pressed the sod, which murder had 
 wetted with a brother's blood, shed by the 
 reputed father of him who was now 
 tempting her shuddering soul, from its first 
 duties ; fearful images rushed over her 
 shrinking mind, ,and a father's blessing 
 would have conquered, again she would

 caught a glimpse of the lights as they 
 gleamed in the chapel windows. 
 
 " Oh ! Eglentine, these lights, these 
 lights ! they shine for your nuptials, they 
 shine for my death, your bridal hour, is 
 the signal for — Oh ! Eglentine !** 
 
 Eglentine groaned ; she shook, her 
 knees smote each other, cold dews of 
 bitter conflict were dripping from her 
 brows, and every aching sense grew dull. 
 In that moment Lord Clancarron was 
 seen at the entrance of the grove, a few 
 steps would reach her, she would be no 
 longer her own, she would be his, he came 
 to seek his bride, to lead her to the altar, 
 * to tear her from Fitz Ormond, to make her 
 a wretch for ever*

 " Eglentine ! my soul, my bride, my

 the fearful throbs of her heart were only 
 heard \ her senses receded, she staggered, 
 and gasped, sunk into the opening arms of 
 Fitz Ormond and — poor Eglentine \ 
 
 Little more has tobe added; the daughter 
 of Sir Geoffry De Dunstanville left his 
 arms, even on her bridal night, and wedded 
 with the adopted son of a murderer ; but 
 she loved, and was a woman, and when 
 she raised her head from the bosom of her 
 lover, she was in a post-chaise, and many 
 miles from De Dunstanville Abbey.

 CHAPTER VIII. 
 
 Slow and doubtful had been Sir Geoffry's 
 recovery after the fatal death of his son 
 and daughter - in - law ; but he was a 
 Christian,, and confidence in the Deity 
 tranquillized his mind, and fortified his 
 soul to wait the developement of that 
 great plan, which will prove that, from the 
 fall of a sparrow to the wreck of a world, 
 all is for ultimate good, and leading to an 
 eternal perfection. In the smiles of the 
 promising infant, Jane, he found the 
 sweetest solace, and looked forward with 
 serene delight when she would assert her 
 parents' rights, and become the bright 
 representative of their virtues. 
 
 The heavy gloom, which for a long time

 bordered on derangement, was gradually- 
 cheered by another hope , ardently he desir- 
 ed to behold his Eglentine the wife of Lord 
 Clancarron ; but cheerless and unendearing 
 was the sentiment she felt for him ; yet 
 considering Fitz Ormond lost, and to please 
 her father, the melancholy, half heart- 
 broken being, yielded a passive consent j 
 his lordship received her acquiescence with 
 a rapture, which, though delicacy to her 
 feelings repressed, shone forth in his 
 intelligent eye, and, kneeling before her, he 
 vowed to watch her wishes with a love so 
 pure and holy, that it should deserve some 
 soft return; "Iwill deserve you, worshipped 
 Eglentine," he cried ; " and when did your 
 soft nature refuse a smile of approbation ta 
 desert ?" 
 
 " Oh ! my cousin — my — ** she drew a 
 lengthened sigh, " Oh ! that I could attune

 my soul to yours, that I could regulate my 
 heart, and be what you deserve ! Alas ! 
 the sentiment is cold which duty offers, 
 which gratitude feels \ yet, dear Clancarron 
 I will be all I can, and in time may deserve 
 your love." 
 
 She was candid, mild, and generous, and 
 pleased in the idea that if she could not 
 feel the wild tumults of joy, neither could 
 she experience the acute pangs of misery ; 
 and on the day she was to resign her 
 future fate to Lord Clancarron's care, the 
 idea of being his wife, so far from partak- 
 ing of former agony, was accompanied by 
 a feeling, pure, calm, dignified, and holy. 
 
 It had been Sir Geoffry's wish, thinking 
 the ceremony would be more solemn and 
 impressive, to have it celebrated at mid- 
 night, and the poor unanticipating bride, 
 taking advantage of his Lordship, and

 lawyers, went forth to weep one more 
 sister's tear upon her brother's hallowed 
 
 grave. 
 
 Eglentine's absence was soon known, and 
 caused strange and wild alarms ; she was 
 sought, but never found j but the particu- 
 lars of her elopement and with whom, 
 were soon discovered ; poor Clancarron, 
 nearly distracted with boding fears, yet 
 unapprehensive of what really had occured, 
 flew himself towards the ruins ; when he 
 encountered the young peasant whom he 
 had employed to seek the lost dog ; his 
 words transfixed him to the spot - } K Your

 herself — to her father, and to that fair 
 report which maiden honour treasures \ — 
 that was a pang beyond the rest. 
 
 On his return to the abbey, he found 
 Sir Geoffry pacing the hall with the 
 infant Jane clasped in his arms, as if fearful 
 of losing her too, and crying, with wild 
 anticipating dread, as his still weak mind 
 reverted to former scenes, " Is the fiend 
 come again among us ? Did you see him ? 
 I feel him here" and Sir Geoffry looked 
 fearfully around as he pressed his own 
 agonised bosom, " aye, I feel it here." 
 
 " My uncle ! my father ! I feel." 
 
 " You feel !— what 2"

 Sir Geoffry's look was terrible, bolts of

 fire felt darting at his heart ; his brain, it 
 was bursting, and while internal convul- 
 sions empurpled his lips — a name detested 
 and interdicted fell from them. 
 Clancarron was mute. 
 It was reiterated as a question. 
 « Fitz Ormond ?" 
 
 " I would not name the name that you 
 have spoken ; yet be calm," and the fond 
 forsaken Clancarron clasped his hands, 
 while burning tears stole down his ashy 
 cheeks, " be calm !" 
 
 Sir GeofFry was calm, quite calm ; it 
 was that awful predictive calm which pre- 
 cedes the rising tempest ere it bursts ; he 
 felt a daughter's fall from duty, honour, 
 happiness ; and his wrath was deep, deter- 
 mined, and most deadly \ he resigned the 
 baby " Angel of an angel leave these arms,

 breath ; be thou ever blessed, and bles-

 He took Clancarron's arm. 
 
 "Lead on." 
 
 « My gracious uncle," said the youth, 
 shrinking from he knew not what, 
 " whither would you go ? Where lead

 " Do you fear ? Only to my son's, 
 to your sister's grave — are you reluctant ?" 
 
 " Dearest Sir, take rest, what would 
 you do there ?" 
 
 " Pray !" 
 
 " Not. now, what ever purpose," — he 
 interrupted him repeating, 
 
 a Purpose — yes, I have a purpose, a 
 father's heart has sent it to heaven ; a 
 father's lips shall register it on earth." 
 
 They went forth, and took the winding

 path leading to the hallowed sanctuary. 
 The look, the step, the manner, all were 
 calm, and imposed obedience ; his eyes 
 were cast on the earth, and rage seemed 
 extinguished in the darkened gloom of 
 impenetrable thought. 
 
 The morning was breaking ; the clouds 
 were rolling dark and solemn ; and a pale 
 watery sun-oeam gleamed on the shadowy 
 scenery of the woods ; but soon it sunk 
 again, extinguished in the darkness of a 
 thundery sky ; a melancholy wind was 
 rustling through the trees, and resounded 
 through the gloomy aisles of the desolated 
 fabric they were entering. 
 
 They had reached the mansions of the 
 dead ; in the remote corner the low stone 
 which marked Mac Dermot's grave caught 
 the father's eye ; he approached it, his 
 blood curdled with horror - y Clancarron'a

 congealed with apprehension ; one step 
 more, they reached it, and Sir Geoffry, 
 grasping his hand, cried, " Behold the 
 home, behold the father of Eglentine De 
 Dunstanville ; of her who left the sacred 
 shelter of my bosom, the holy pillow of 
 honourable love, for the vile offspring of 
 a brother's murderer ! my child, my child, 
 oh my child !" Tears gushed forth v , and 
 ran down his venerable face, and falling 
 on the earth, he continued for a time lost 
 in a tender, a relenting agony, ; had the 
 lost Eglentine heard him it had riven her 
 heart ; had she heard him it would have 
 done more, riven the image of Fitz 
 Ormond from that heart ; but the hour of 
 grace had closed ; she had been the child 
 of disobedience, the daughter of reproba- 
 tion, and the voice of peace was never 
 more to reach her ear.

 Sir Geoffry was now kneeling, he raised 
 his eyes, his spirit was in heaven, " Great 
 and all governing God ! who promises to 
 the parent's prayer a power strong, binding, 
 and blessing, as thine own immutable 
 decrees, enter the hidden recesses of my 
 soul, a forsaken father's soul, and mark 
 the vengeance, mark my vengeance ! 
 record it in thine everlasting annals ! and 
 let the ministering beings who perform 
 thy mighty will, speed it to this daugh- 
 ter's heart ! let it follow her through every 
 lane of life, in her rising up, and laying 
 / down, and be it about all her ways. 
 
 " When she kneels in prayer, may she 
 feel it strike upon her ear ! when sick and 
 when in sorrow, may she feel it ! — may it 
 be with her shrinking spirit on the bed of 
 death! and when the dark and narrow 
 house receives her poor remains, may it

 follow her even into thy great presence ! 
 then let her fully feel it, through eternal 
 ages, in eternal worlds, feel a father's for- 
 giveness !" 
 
 A seraphic fire had shone in his eyes, and 
 every aching sense felt the softening influ- 
 ence of the mercy he had awarded to a 
 sinning child. 
 
 The gracious sounds entranced the ge- 
 nerous soul of Clancarron, and deserted 
 and forsaken as he was, so pure was his 
 passion, that enraptured, he cried, " My 
 blessed uncle ! the wanderer shall return ! 
 she " 
 
 Clancarron was interrupted. 
 
 " Never." 
 
 And Sir GeofFry's look was decisive, 
 was final, " The christian," he added, 
 " has performed the christian's duty ; the 
 father will support the father's dignity ;

 has a right to her dower, I hope he will 
 give her happiness ; I see her no more, 
 hear of her no more, she is a stranger to 
 my blood, and with me is, as if she had 
 never been." 
 
 Eglentine had her fortune, and she also 
 had her father's forgiveness 5 but that 
 father was firm, he never did see her, 
 never would hear of her : she felt — what 
 was it Eglentine did not feel ! — the father 
 had forgiven, but heaven had not for- 
 gotten ; in the annals of mercy a parent's 
 pardon may be enrolled, and when in the 
 realms of mercy it may be felt, but a wi- 
 thering influence follows violated duty, 
 and prayer from the lips of disobedience 
 is unacceptable, and unapproachable to 
 God.

 sioned by the opinion, Sir Geoffry had 
 believed, (as he was informed,) that Fitz 
 Ormond was the natural son of Mac er- 
 mot, else poor Eglentine might have been 
 welcomed to his arms as a daughter ; she 
 and peace, alas ! had parted for ever ; sor- 
 row was quick in following her steps, and 
 only in an early, and obscure grave, did 
 the ill-destined daughter of Sir Geoffry 
 find refuge from the evils of life.

 CHAPTER IX. 
 
 Jane De Dunstanville's education had 
 been directed by Mrs. Fortrose, a lady 
 possessing the gentlest manners, the most 
 undeviating principles, a superior and cul- 
 tivated understading, and mistress of the 
 accomplishments, which give a brilliant 
 lustre to the virtue? ; for this lady, Jane 
 felt a filial reverence and affection, and 
 under her maternal care, her pupil grew 
 a little wonder. 
 
 To change the air, and vary the plea- 
 sures for his darling, though Sir Geoffry 
 himself had never quitted the abbey since 
 his son's death, every season Jane and her 
 friend were sent to some of the fashionable 
 resorts, where her talents had the advan-

 tag e of the first masters; but the summer 
 that Jane attained her thirteenth year, 
 Mrs. Fortrose had been invited by an opu- 
 lent relative, to pass some months in Sus- 
 sex, and as she could not be separated 
 from hereto; Jane, delighted with the 
 excursion,' accompanied her. 
 
 Among the guests assembled at the hos- 
 pitable table of Mr. Ponsonby, appeared a ' 
 youth of high fashion, named Sir Henry 
 Egerton ; he fluttered round the little 
 heiress continually, in the hope of having 
 an invitation to the abbey, when he hoped 
 his irresistible graces would plead his cause, 
 andby progressively pleasing her, at length 
 secure her his own; girl hke, the young 
 Jane was gratified with his attentions, and 
 she really would have requested Mrs. Fort- 
 rose to give the invitation he so ardently 
 desired, wfea » occurrence happened,

 which closed every avenue to her little 
 beating heart against him, and made it 
 feel all it could feel for a poor helpless 
 soal, whom nobody knew, and nobody 
 cared for. 
 
 Accompanied by Mrs. Fortrose, Sir 
 Henry, and her little darling pug, Wous- 
 ki, in the evening of an oppressive and 
 sultry day, she went out to enjoy the cool 
 and reviving breezes wafted from a beau- 
 tiful river, which, meandering through 
 the pleasure grounds, lost itself in a large 
 sheet of water at the base of a lofty rock 
 that sublimely enriched the perspective 
 from Mr. Ponsonby's mansion. 
 
 While Jane busied herself making a gar- 
 land of the wild roses, which grew in pro- 
 fusion around her, for her favourite Wous- 
 ki's neck, Sir Henry, seated on the grass 
 at her feet, gallantly swore " he should cer-

 steal her place." 
 
 " You need not/' cried the lively girl, 
 sportively ; " for I often take Wouski in 
 my arms, and you know you can never 
 come there." 
 
 There was something in this answer, 
 though spoken en badinage^ that made the 
 baronet uneasy, and with a smile, that

 parish boys, and beggarly reptiles, even 
 crossing our path !" 
 
 Jane raised her eyes as he spoke, and 
 they fell on a pale emaciated, ragged figure, 
 who stood gazing on the water a few paces 
 from them.

 " And how good Mr. Ponsonby is, 5 ' 
 replied Jane ; still looking on the pitiable 
 being with increasing interest ; u how 
 very, very good, to give the poor and hum- 
 ble such a pleasure. Who is that dejected 
 creature?" said she, whispering a parish 
 lad, as she pointed to the object attracting 
 her notice. 
 
 " Only beggar boy." 
 
 The appellation was felt ; he turned 
 round, and his full, dark, heavy eye fixed 
 on Jane; but again it fell. 
 
 " Beggar boy is not his name ;" and 
 Jane insensibly drew nearer to him. 
 
 " No, no, Miss, Hildy Wildy, we call 
 him, but since he fell sick, and could not 
 work, we call him beggar boy." 
 
 Jane's hand was in her little bag, a tear 
 in her eye, and her heart on her lip, when 
 her favourite Wouski, going too near the

 the branching trees which grew among the 
 craggs. ; 
 
 Jane screamed; her dog looked up in her 
 face and howled : — boy after boy sneaked 
 off; and every instant the poor animal was 
 falling lower and lower. 
 
 " My dog ! my dog ! now Sir Henry, 
 dear % good Sir Henry ! now, as you love 
 me, go down and save my Wouski — save 
 my Wouski !'* and Jane took his hand and 
 pressed it within her own : — " You will

 " Quick ! you beggar boy there ! here 
 is a shilling, a crown for you !" cried the 
 brave Sir Henry ; " Bring the dog — here 
 is a crown !" 
 
 The beggar looked up ; something of a 
 aged his pallid cheek; but he moved 
 no;

 "You rascal!" reiterated Sir Henry, 
 " Go for the dog ! I'll have you flogged 
 — flayed if you don't !" 
 
 Jane darted forward herself. 
 
 " Hildy ! beggar !" she gasped, and her 
 pretty hands were folded in supplication : 
 " Dear— dear Hildy !" 
 
 The next moment, Hildy was seen scram- 
 bling over the precipice ; — he reached the 
 dog, and grasped it, but the branch giving 
 way, he and the favourite fell together? 
 and sunk into the deep ; he was seen to 
 rise — he sunk, — but he could swim a little, 
 and again he appeared above the water, 
 holding the drenched Wouski over his 
 head. 
 
 Jane rent the air with her cries — her 
 dog, her Wouski was forgotten, and " The 
 boy ! the boy ! the poor boy !" was all 
 her lips could utter •> at last, the beggar

 was perceived to rise at another point of 
 the rock, where the water was shallow ; 
 he made one last effort, clung to some 
 impending branches, and in the next in- 
 stant, he lay extended with Wouski clasped 
 to his cold bosom. 
 
 Breathless with suspensive agony, Jane 
 flew through the winding path which led 
 to the spot where the poor boy lay ;— 
 Wouski struggled in vain for freedom, 
 the arm that held her was convulsed — he 
 seemed himself in the arms of death ; a 
 crowd gathered round them, and restora- 
 tives were applied. 
 
 " Dear, dear beggar ! noble, good Hildy! 
 look up, look up !" she cried, her own 
 beautiful hands wringing the water from 
 his matted hair, and rubbing his temples. 
 
 He opened his eyes, and they fixed on her 
 pale lovely face ; in ecstacy she pressed his

 head with innocent joy to her bosom; and 
 in the next moment, conscious of some- 
 thing nameless, she started up, and burst- 
 ing into tears, threw herself into the arms 
 of Mrs. Fortrose, and hid her blushing face 
 in her neck. 
 
 " Wouski ! Wouski !" she cried, sob- 
 bing ; a tumult of strange sensations 
 swelled her heart, and she could add no 
 more. 
 
 Sir Henry approached her with tender 
 enquiries. 
 
 She received him with contempt- : — 
 tl What you love best, Sir, I see very well !" 
 said she, coldly ; kC Now, dear mamma, 
 let us attend to this noble boy ; he did lis- 
 ten to my begging, and he shall never beg 
 again himself, I long to assure him of — ■

 recovered ; but shivering in his wet rags, 
 and, as if anxions to conceal them, he bent 
 to Wouski, saying, " Poor little thing !" 
 
 " Mamma and I wish to see you home ;" 
 said Jane, in the sweetest voice of com- 
 passion ; " and never to let you beg again, 
 or be called names by bad unfeeling boys ; 
 are you able to walk home, good Hildy r" 
 
 Hildy covered his face with his hands, 
 and burst into tears, for the voice of kind- 
 ness was a stranger to his ear ; — he shook 
 his head. 
 
 " Where do you live, good boy V 9 
 
 He threw his eves around — he could 
 not speak.

 He drew a deep sigh.

 " Yes, by my mother, on her grave;

 " Oh mamma ! mamma !" cried Jane. 
 
 Mrs. Fortrose was affected, interested. 
 
 u What is your name, poor youth ; to 
 whom do you belong ?" 
 
 " Nobody owns me, I belong to no one." 
 
 " But your name ?" 
 
 A burning red flushed his cheek-r-his 
 bosom seemed to swell, and his tongue 
 faultered as he replied, " Hildebrande Fitz 
 Ormond !" 
 
 Mrs. Fortrose started ; she turned pale, 
 and sunk into a reverie. Jane's heart beat

 and pressed it between her own, as she 
 looked at Mrs. Fortrose; but, " Oh mam-

 Mrs. Fortrose knew the family history,

 yet had never heard of the ill-fated Eglen- 
 tine's return to England, nor that she had 
 a son ; indeed, it had been reported, and 
 was generally believed, that she and her 
 husband had died at sea in their passage to 
 America, soon after their marriage. 
 
 Who Hildebrande's mother was, _had 
 never been known in the village ; she be- 
 queathed somepapers to her son, with much 
 solemnity, before she died ; her few effects 
 had been seized by a relentless landlord, 
 for the rent of her cottage, and with them 
 these papers, but not before her son had 
 perused them ; his grandfather, therefore, 
 he had learned to fear, to almost hate, and 
 since his mother's death, he had worked 
 for his daily bread. 
 
 Mrs. Fortrose had him clothed, and 
 placed him in a farm house until she re-

 ceived Sir Geoffry's directions respecting 
 him. 
 
 The indignant sentiment he testified 
 towards his grandfather, and indeed for 
 his cousin Jane too, when he heard such a 
 being existed, induced them not to farther 
 wound a spirit which seemed proud even in 
 rags, but as he believed Jane to be the daugh- 
 ter of Mrs. Fortrose, and a great favourite 
 with his grandfather, he was suffered to 
 remain in that idea, and as Mary Fort- 
 rose, Hildedrande looked up to Jane De 
 Dunstanville as to a guardian, and pre- 
 serving angel. 
 
 Mrs. Fortrose immediately wrote a full 
 and circumstantial account of the disco- 
 very she had made, to Sir Geoffry ; de- 
 scribed his daughter's sufferings, how she 
 had lived, how she had died, and in what 
 condition her son had been discovered. His

 darling also addressed him on the subject, 
 and, with all the glowing energy of an artless 
 nature, gei erously described the dawnings 
 of superior character he evinced, and gave 
 his every virtue, as it rose on her own poe- 
 tical imagination j the most vivid colouring; 
 u he is so "brave, so gentle, so grateful, so 
 feeling, and so good, (she wrote) and has 
 so much of the pride you approve, dear, 
 dear, grand papa ; for he disdained taking 
 money though hungry and naked, yet 
 hazarded his dear life to save a little dog, 
 my little dog, your Jane's little dog ; and 
 he has such beautiful features, such fin* 
 curling hair, — it curls, dear, dear, grand- 
 papa, it curls like your's — but I have so 
 much to say, that I long to be with you,

 CHAPTER X. 
 
 The reprobated Eglentine's name had never 
 been mentioned after her elopement, within 
 the walls of De Dunstanville ; it became as 
 if forgotten by all, except him, who in the 
 hour of blissful expectation had been for- 
 saken ; in that bosom, the remembrance 
 of her gentle virtues never died, she 
 was there embalmed among the holiest 
 thoughts, and even, when to gratify a 
 noble,yet broken-hearted declining mother, 
 Lord Clancarron married a city heiress, 
 her fair image shone, and sat unrivalled ; 
 his mother was a high-born Caledonian — 
 his union preserved the ancient lands of 
 Clancarron from swelling the pride of 
 upstart ignorance, with no pretension but

 JANE BE DUNSTANVILLE. 137 
 
 to gold, and he became husband to one 
 who sighed for a coronet. 
 
 Lord Clancarron possessed a mind capa- 
 ble of giving and receiving happiness ; in 
 Eglentine De Dunstanville, he had found 
 congenial virtues ; but alas ! the re lined 
 energies of her mild spirit were not for 
 him ; "she had abandoned him ; and he felt 
 he was abandoned ; he knew the ruin im- 
 pending over his fallen fortune ; he knew 
 his mother's despair ; he knew the chilling 
 indifference of his own heart towards his 
 bride ; he contrasted the fair form, the 
 gentle manner, the softened look, the ele- 
 gant mind, and the chastened gaiety of 
 the lost Eglentine, with the forward man- 
 ners and affected dignity of her destined 
 to his arms, and shrunk from the compa- 
 rison ; his peace was every way wrecked^

 138 JANE DE DUNSTANVILLE. 
 
 yet he performed his duty as a husband, 
 a son, and a father. 
 
 His first enquiries, on his arrival in Lon- 
 don, were for his fugitive cousin ; he was 
 resolved to see her, to assure her of un- 
 ending attachment, and in friendship to 
 her husband, prove the disinterested sen- 
 timent she had inspired. 
 
 Alas! Lord Clancarron's fond and gene- 
 rous intentions were frustrated ; poor 
 Eglentine was doomed never more to hear 
 the Soothing accent of friendship. 
 
 Oh ! children of disobedience, learn, and 
 be warned, that when implanting the 
 thorn of regret in a parent's bosom, you 
 place a scorpion in your own, that will 
 sting through every fibre of the heart, the 
 venom will circulate through every throb- 
 bing vein, and even dart its forked tongue 
 to after generations, and from the lips of

 children's children, speak thef malediction 
 that has issued from a father's and a 
 mother's heavy heart. 
 
 Eglentine's fortune was placed in the 
 hands of a banker, who failing, reduced 
 them to beggary. With the miserable rem- 
 nant her husband procured a commission, 
 and the regiment being ordered on foreign 
 service, the fond and faithful wife would 
 listen to no dissuasives, lie was her whole 
 world, she would accompany him ; and 
 they embarked on board a transport, 
 which was attacked by a privateer a few 
 days after they had left the Channel. The 
 contest was fierce and sanguinary ; young 
 Fitz Ormond fell, and the extended arms 
 of his distracted wife, who had rushed in 
 horror on the deck, received the bleeding 
 bodv.

 He looked in her face, " Oh ! my Eglen- 
 tine !" 
 
 " We are together," said she, laying 
 her cheek on the gushing wound, and 
 clasping him close, " and now we shall 
 both die j" a wild smile appeared on her 
 ashy cheek, as she added, " yes, and toge- 
 ther." Her innocent spirit was departing ; 
 she felt on the verge of peace, on the verge 
 of glory, every object receded from her 
 sight, and she had died ; but there came a 
 savage hand and dragged her husband's 
 body from her enfeebled grasp, a hoarse 
 voice was heard roaring, " Clear the 
 decks 1" Her eyes fell again, and she beheld 
 the form she so adored cast overboard. 
 
 Eglentine saw no more ; " Eather ! fell 
 from her cold white lips ; the foaming 
 waves were now rolling high, shrieks of 
 fear, and shrieks of death, were heard to

 mingle with the winds, groan answered 
 groan, the thundering cannon was still, its 
 muttering grew faint, and the bloody 
 business of the fateful hour was passing 
 away. 
 
 By rude and roughening hands the 
 form of Eglentine was raised ; her cheeks 
 were deathly ; a bluey paleness shaded 
 every wrung feature, and the soft lustre 
 of an angel eye was quenched in the dim- 
 ming tears of wrecking despair. — — 
 — — — — The ship was retaken 
 and towed back to an English port, and 
 poor Eglentine yet survived to taste the 
 cup of human suffering ; she had no hus- 
 band, she had no father, but her father in 
 heaven ; and when she was landed, but 
 for a poor Highland soldier, she had 
 expired unnoticed and unknown \ he 
 wrapped her lovely form in his plaid, it

 was almost her only covering, and honest 
 Donald Cameron watched her with a pa- 
 rent's care \ many a tear he shed upon her 
 burning hands, and many a prayer he of- 
 fered up for her recovery ; and when her 
 fever abated, and he learned she was related 
 to the house of Ciancarron, Donald swore 
 he would perish or preserve her ; and 
 Donald kept his word. He had obtained 
 a furlough, and was attending her to 
 London, where it was her intention to 
 solicit Lord Clancarron's mediation with 
 her father ; for though Eglentine's love and 
 holiest wishes were all in heaven with 
 her husband, a throbbing something 
 within strongly urged her to preserve ex- 
 istence till it should behold the light. 
 When she hoped to give it to her father, 
 and then resign the weary load of being.

 neck had escaped the plunderers, and the 
 sale of it was the poor wanderer's support ; 
 overcome with excessive fatigue, again a 
 nervous fever seized the frame of Eglen- 
 tine, and reduced her to the verge of 
 death ; who could have forsaken her in 
 such a moment ? Not poor untutored 
 Donald : again he watched her night and 
 day, and when the last shilling was ex- 
 pended, he could only fight for himself,— 
 but beg for her. 
 
 A poor curate, who on sixty pounds a 
 year, supported an infirm wife and eight 
 children, listened to his tale instead of 
 prudence, and received the sick wanderer 
 into his own humble home ; and Donald, 
 whose leave had long expired, was pre- 
 paring to depart and rejoin his regiment, 
 when a party seized him as a deserter ; 
 and, notwithstanding, his defence which

 truth made, and humanity should have 
 accepted, a young officer, more proud of 
 his cockade than his character, and more 
 vain of wearing a sword, than performing 
 its duty, had the honest souled Donald 
 tried by a court martial, and he was sen- 
 tenced to receive two hundred lashes. 
 
 A short digression to conclude the sol- 
 dier's tale, will be pardoned by the gentle 
 heart ; the poor fellow, proud and uncom- 
 plaining, sustained the degrading punish- 
 ment, and when the commanding officer, 
 under whom Donald had long served, 
 enquired why, and how so brave a fellow 
 as he had often proved himself, after hav- 
 ing escaped his enemies could desert his 
 friends ? Donald bowed low, and told his 
 simple tale ; it wrung a tear from the eye of 
 his superior, he shook the honest being by 
 the hand, and next morning, in the face of

 the regiment, gave him a halbert as a re- 
 compence for his humanity \ the appro- 
 bation of his colonel was a cordial to his 
 broken spirit \ the stripes on his back 
 were forgotten ; but alas ! they had entered 
 poor Donald's hearty there remembrance 
 had tarried till it mortified every manly 
 fibre ; he looked up in the face of his 
 colonel, grasped his halbert, staggered, fell, 
 and expired; Donald had had his blow 
 — he survived it, but he could not survive 
 the remembrance. 
 
 The pang of knowing his fate was 
 spared to poor Eglentine ; she never was 
 told how fatal his humanity had proved 
 to her humble benefactor ; and under the 
 roof of the poor curate, and in the humane 
 arms of his wife, she gave existence to a 
 son.

 mother's heart as she gazed on the cherub 
 image of her husband ; and to preserve 
 him, became a dear consideration, her 
 child inspired exertion ; and during the 
 declining health of the curate's wife, she 
 superintended his little household, and be- 
 came the instructress of his children, she 
 was their only consolation, and in their 
 simple benevolence she found encourage- 
 ment, comfort, and composure. From this 
 habitation she addressed Lord Clancarron, 
 and inclosed a supplication to her father, 
 dictated by the heart of contrition ; she 
 detailed all she had endured, how she had 
 been preserved, her husband's fate, her 
 child's birth, and her present dependent 
 condition. This pacquet- never reached her 
 cousin ; the fate of the vessel in which she 
 had embarked, with her own and hus- 
 band's death afFectingly described, had been

 In the papers, and proved the doomsday of 
 Clancarron's peace. He recovered from 
 the first shock ; but the fine fibres which 
 attach the soul to life were broken, and 
 shunning all society, and indifferent to 
 every one, and every thing, Lord Clan- 
 car ron was hastening fast to the grave. 
 The heart of Lady Clancarron was mean, 
 jealous, and vindictive ; she knew her hus- 
 band's attachment to his cousin ; beheld 
 the effects her reported death had on 
 his health and reason, yet concealed that 
 she was in existence \ the letters fell into 
 her hands, and she inhumanly suppressed 
 them, while the hapless writer, attributing 
 his silence to her father's obduracy, and 
 his own contempt, sunk again into des- 
 pondency, when the calamities of the cu- 
 rate's family recalled her to exertion. 
 In one week the scarlet fever carried

 off the curate's wife and five children, and 
 reduced himself to such a state of debi- 
 lity, that, unable to perform his duty, 
 the delicate fingers, of Eglentine were 
 obliged to labour for the poor survivors. 
 Famine was now fast encompassing the 
 whole wretched group, and the pleading 
 looks of the perishing creatures imploring 
 her for bread, inspired a courage, or rather 
 desperation, which determined her to per- 
 sonally entreat Lord Clancarron's mercy. 
 
 On her arrival in London, one solitary 
 shilling was her whple worldly possession ; 
 and frantic with strong and nameless fore- 
 bodings, the poor forlorn fugitive hurried 
 from the inn where the stage had set her 
 down, and with her baby in her arms, near 
 two years old, she bent her feeble steps to 
 the house Lord Clancarron did inhabit in 
 her happier days.

 She knocked at the door, and on it 
 being opened by an old woman, in tremu- 
 lous accents, she enquired if Lord Clan- 
 carron still lived there, and was within ? 
 
 " No," was the reply j M all the gentle- 
 folks were in the country ; that Lord Clan- 
 carron did not visit there himself, but his 
 Lady sometimes did." 
 
 "His Lady!" repeated Eglentine, put- 
 ting her hand to her head, " It is so ; 
 then in his felicity my miseries were un- 
 heeded." 
 
 She enquired no more; but turning from 
 the door, and insensible where she wan- 
 dered, she reached St. James's Park. She 
 gave her child some milk and cake, and 
 allayed her own thirst with the whole- 
 some beverage ; and thus was her last shil- 
 ling expended.

 drew in, the darkness of a chilling night 
 was fast approaching, and she had not 
 where to lay her head ; the sweet baby 
 smiled innocently in her face ; yet he felt 
 cold, but she nestled him in her bosom, 
 and he dropped asleep, till the rude mirth of 
 some passing soldiers .awoke him ; he 
 stretched out his little hands, and again 
 would have sunk into quiet slumber; 
 but she started up, and wrapping him in 
 her robe, ran rather than walked, till she 
 gained the street, when leaning against a 
 wall she burst into tears of incontrqllable 
 agony. 
 
 " My child, my child, you will die !" she 
 cried, pressing the innocent to her cold 
 bosom ; " without food, without a shelter, 
 you will die. — My father ! My father ! Oh 
 Fitz Ormond ! your child will die, and for 
 want — will die for want !"

 She now staggered onwards, till a burial 
 ground appeared befor her. She laughed. 
 cc This is right, child we are at home 5 
 your father will meet us— my father — no- 
 no — no, he will not." 
 
 She looked up, the antique spires were 
 lost in the darkening mist. She was near 
 Westminster abbey ; the w T ind was passing 
 cold over the huge stones which paved 
 the path of Eglentine ; all was silent 
 within the sacred pile, and its inhabitants 
 still as if they had never known a troubled 
 world. 
 
 A door was open leading to the inner 
 cloisters, and seemed to offer a shelter for 
 the night ; she entered, and had sunk into 
 a nook, when a heavy toll echoed through 
 the fabric and made her start ; involunta- 
 rily she shrieked, and the next moment in 
 tones too rude for the hallowed fane, a

 man holding a lantern to her face, bade 
 her " troop with her bundle, or he would 
 give her to the watch." 
 
 His menace was unintelligible to the 
 poor sufferer, yet she knew it was a com- 
 mand to be gone ; she crossed hei arms 
 ever her baby as he clung to her breast, 
 and looking in the man's face, with a look 
 that might have softened savage nature, 
 she faintly said, * This night, only this 
 one ? My child — he will perish in the 
 damp air, — only this night." 
 
 In accents coarser than before, the 
 fellow repeated, " Out trumpery with gib- 
 berish on your tongue, and not a penny 
 in your pocket, — out I say." 
 
 Resignedin spirit she now obeyed: "The

 want, every horror sunk to nothingness 
 in the voice that next assailed her. 
 
 She heard her infant's lips move as if 
 parched, and in his lisping way ask bread. 
 
 She hurried through the streets again j 
 her demeanour was wild, her gestures fran- 
 tic, her sobs convulsive, and though her 
 brain burned, her poor frame shivered in 
 the blast ; she laughed, and oh her laugh 
 was fearful ; but she could not weep ; 
 often she begged, but no one heeded her ; 
 at last nature felt giving way, a giddiness 
 seized her, her knees shook, and her 
 hands feeling nearly nerveless she had 
 with her infant fallen, when a poor child 
 of beggary held her up, and assisted her 
 to the steps of a house, and there she left 
 her to pursue her own sad occupations. 
 
 The chills of despair were shaking her 
 to nothing, yet for her baby she held

 All hurried on, no one heeded her cry ;

 The little feeble hands of her child were

 lip was pressed to her famished sunken

 torture into every fibre of the mother's

 thee — " but in the instant of her last 
 dreadful thought a carriage drew up to 
 the door, and a gentleman alighted. 
 
 She was impeded for a moment in her 
 purpose, for he ascended the steps ; and as 
 she sunk again, her trembling lingers 
 grasped his knees. She -raised her eyes, 
 her dim and burning eyes, and fixed them 
 on his face ; the glare of a blazing lamp 
 fell full upon it, and she knew him. She 
 drew a convulsive gasp. 
 
 " See !" said she, shivering in all a mo- 
 ther's agonies, in all a mother's despair. 
 " See my baby, see his looks, he wants — 
 he hungers— Eglentine's baby hungers 1" 
 
 She held up the babe in her wasted 
 hands, as she repeated, " he hungers, he - 
 hungers." 
 
 Eglentine had no common form, it now 
 appeared uncommon indeed, and touched

 with something not earthly 5 her tones pe- 
 netrated the stranger's soul ; it awakened 
 strange feelings, and he gave her his 
 purse ; but in the act of giving it, he had 
 to bend towards the poor suppliant, and in 
 that moment he encountered the glare of 
 her wild speaking eye. She wrung his 
 hand ; she was known, Lord Clancarron 
 beheld Eglentine ; beheld her living, be- 
 held her he had long believed dead, and 
 whom he was hastening after to the 
 grave ; he beheld the beauteous ruin of 
 her he had so loved, a beggar — Eglen- 
 tine De Dunstanville a beggar ! 
 
 He sunk down on the stones beside 
 her; he leaned his head on her cold 
 bosom, pressed his burning lips to her 
 colder cheek, and faintly uttering — " God! 
 — Eglentine !" 
 
 Clancarron never spoke again ; he ex-

 pired on that bosom on which he only 
 wished to live y for one moment his long 
 abstracted soul swelled with the intensity 
 of sudden feeling, it rushed in burning 
 tumults through his wasted frame, and all 
 concentrating in the object who broke on 
 his appalled senses, the fine attenuated 
 thread of worn out life gave way, and 
 Clancarron ceased to suffer.

 Eglentine, through the humanity of the 
 servants, was taken care of that night ; to 
 describe her feelings, is beyond human 
 power. Lord Clancarron had gone out on 
 a charitable visit, but finding his friend 
 from home, he returned with the money

 in his purse, which supplied the wants of 
 Eglentine, and she returned to the only- 
 door that would open to give her entrance, 
 and through a severe winter, it supplied 
 their humble wants, and also supported 
 the humane curate on the bed of death. 
 
 After he had left this world for a bet- 
 ter, poor Eglentine, to support her own 
 child, and the three orphans of him who 
 had been her benefactor, took in fine 
 work, and taught the children of the vil- 
 lage to read and write, and in this hum- 
 ble obscurity, the once-admired Eglentine 
 lived till her son had completed his ele- 
 venth year ; his feelings, his principles, 
 were all his mother's, the only inheritance 
 she had to bequeath, and with these, the 
 mind of Hildebrande was rich, proud, and 
 dignified. 
 
 She had employed every hour of ease,

 during the last days of her painful life, in 
 writing the circumstances, which from feli- 
 city and honour had reduced her to pe- 
 nury and contempt, remorse, and unend- 
 ing sorrow. 
 
 " When I am gone, when I am laid low 
 under the turf that will cover my grave, 
 do you, my child, my comfort, my last 
 and only blessing, do you, I say, send these 
 papers to Sir Geoffry De Dunstanville ; 
 I was disowned and reprobated, but I de- 
 served reprobation ; I sinned, and I have 
 suffered. My child ! my child ! should 
 my father ever vouchsafe to own you — 
 and oh ! the thought breaks on my soul 
 like a ray from heaven, — never disobey 
 him! — remember me, never disobey him !" 
 
 Her weeping child held her wasted hand 
 while she spoke ; his young heart swelled 
 —he kneeled, and his innocent soul paid

 his mother worship ; her cheek was now 
 whitened and sunk — 'her eyes were glaz- 
 ed, and all the hues of animation were 
 gone. 
 
 " Beloved of my heart !" she resumed, 
 u beloved of your mother's heart I" and 
 her voice was weakening, and her breath 
 failing while she spoke, " I must leave 
 you, — mine is a fearful way, and dark, 
 very dark, my child, but angels are about 
 
 me ; — I feel — I feel — mercy — father — 
 father — father !" 
 
 The lips of her son were pressing her 
 cold, cold brows ; his lips pressed a corpse ; 
 she was gone ! was no more ! every sor- 
 row had been sanctified, every passion 
 purified, every thought resigned. 
 
 " She went in hope, and hope and fear 
 in that dread hour, from ominous conscience 
 spring, and err not in their boding."

 CHAPTER XI. 
 
 What Sir Geoffry's reflections were on 
 this unexpected and interesting discovery, 
 as they were never disclosed, neither can 
 they be described ; he could not banish from 
 his thoughts, that the extraordinary boy in 
 whose favour he was importuned, was the 
 son of Fitz Ormond, who had wrecked 
 many of his fondest and proudest hopes ; 
 neither could he forget he was the child, 
 the orphan child, of a daughter once 
 adored, who had been the pride of proud 
 hours, and the hope of happy hours. See 
 him as yet, he could not, but he empowered 
 Mrs. Fortrose, most amply, to have him- 
 educated, supplied, and attended in every 
 way as became a descendant of Sir Geoffry 
 De Dunstanville,

 We need not follow the youth through 
 his rapid improvements; at the age of 
 sixteen, a prince might have gloried in such 
 a representative, his dispositions were na- 
 turally noble, and his mind richly intel- 
 ligent, and in the acquirement of intellec- 
 tual knowledge, the cultivation of the 
 graces had not been forgotten ; there was 
 something majestic and imposing in his 
 figure, and his manners were dignified, 
 yet tempered with gentleness, and every 
 fine feature of his face bore the impres- 
 sion of a superior nature ; yet we present 
 not this our hero as faultless ; his passions 
 were high and impetuous ; and he had a 
 proud and unbending spirit, which the 
 deeper he felt obligation, the more disin- 
 clined he became to wear its fetters. His 
 mother's sufferings and death were ever 
 present to his memory, and the dislike in

 which a father who had adored that mother 
 was held, swelled his* tenacious bosom 
 with many an indignant throb. He ve- 
 nerated his grandfather's character, and 
 for his bounties, he was grateful ; but not 
 being admitted to his presence, while his 
 cousin Jane was worshipped as an angel, 
 inspired a sentiment very remote from 
 affection for either, and to secure his con- 
 fidence and interest his feelings, engage 
 his tenderness and esteem, and to relieve 
 a soul so proud, from the mortifying re- 
 flections restraint and dependence must 
 feel in the presence of a benefactor, it 
 was agreed that Jane should continue to 
 pass as the daughter of Mrs. Fortrose, 
 whose influence with his grandfather, 
 had procured him the advantages he en- 
 joyed from his liberality and kindness.

 His vacations while at school and col- 
 lege, were generally spent either in Lon- 
 don or Bath with them, where Jane's inno- 
 cent and artless graces, her beauty and 
 fine understanding, endearing manners, 
 and delicate expressions of attachment, 
 encouraged and sanctioned the ardent 
 sentiment which she had inspired, and 
 blended her image with every hope of 
 bliss, and she shone on enraptured imagi- 
 nation as the angel of his future felicity. 
 
 It was Sir Geoffry's desire that he should 
 make a tour of Europe, and Jane, accom- 
 panied by her friend, gave him the meet- 
 ing in London, to take leave previous to 
 his departure. 
 
 The cousins had maintained a regular 
 correspondence, and had any thing like 
 the truth glanced over the mind of Hilde- 
 brande Fitz Ormond, the conscious smile,

 and strange laugh of Jane when he would 
 read her own letters to herself, might have 
 disclosed the secret. 
 
 He often told her she and his cousin 
 seemed to have but one soul, and that he 
 esteemed in the generous Jane, what he 
 adored in his superior Mary. 
 
 Mrs. Fortrose, every way deserving the 
 confidence reposed in her, had not con- 
 cealed the mutual attachment from Sir 
 GeofFry, and as he expressed no dissatisfac- 
 tion, she was a pleased spectatress of the 
 vows they plighted to each other before 
 their separation, and anticipated much 
 delight in beholding the developement of 
 their romantic mystery ; but the amiable 
 woman was never more to behold her 
 favourite Fitz Ormond j a very few months 
 after his departure she bade farewell to

 arms of Jane, and it was the first sorrow 
 the gentle girl ever knew. 
 
 " How much Hildebrande will feel,'* 
 said Jane, hanging on her grand-father's 
 neck, " when he hears of my dear 
 Mamma's death ; and when he returns'* — 
 tears fell on the hand which fondly 
 encircled her. 
 
 "What would my child add? What 
 would she wish when he returns ?" 
 
 " Poor Hildebrande — !" 
 
 " Poor ! — Can he be poor with my 
 Jane's regard ?" 
 
 ft Oh ! if my regard might — !" 
 
 She stopped. 
 
 " Might — what, my darling?" 
 
 " Make him," she cried clasping her 
 hands, and looking innocently in her 
 grandfather's face, " make him happy !" 
 
 " Is he then not happy, Jane ?"

 JANE DE DUNSTANVILLE. 167 
 
 She shook her head ; " He could be 
 happier." 
 
 " Indeed ! How could he be happier ?" 
 
 " He would be your son, live with 
 you." 
 
 Sir GeofFry smiled ; " My artless child ! 
 He would be my son, live with me ?" 
 
 She hid her blushing face in his bosom. 
 
 " Is that all wanting to make him happy, 
 quite happy, Jane ?" 
 
 Hildebrande had a powerful pleader in 
 her bosom ; she had a powerful pleader in 
 her grandfather's ; and Jane, before she 
 left the arms so fondly encircling her, was 
 commissioned to think, and then to write, 
 what would make Hildebrande quite happy. 
 
 The throbbings of Jane's heart now 
 became sweetly calm ; and in anticipation, 
 Jane was the happiest of the happy.

 near" and as the lulling calm precedes the 
 driving tempest, so fared it with our 
 heroine. 
 
 Sir GeofFry was subject to the gout, and 
 in a severe attack which confined him to 
 bed, Jane had been his tender nurse, and 
 never left him but when his solicitude 
 forced her to take the air ; and one morn- 
 ing returning in haste lest her soft hand 
 should be wanted, she heard shrieks issue 
 from a cottage ; it was a scene of accumu- 
 lated horror and wretchedness ; the 
 mother of a family had just expired with 
 the small pox ; the father lay ill at the 
 time unable to move, and his wife's death 
 causing his bitter cries, so terrified a little 
 child fastened in his chair, that during the 
 attendant's absence, he had fallen chair and 
 all into the fire ; Jane's charity was active, 
 as it was diffusive \ with a presence of mind

 uncommon for her age, she snatched up 
 the blazing infant and wraped it in her own 
 mantle \ it extinguished the fire, and having 
 left pecuniary relief for the father and 
 children, she hastened to the Abbey ; and 
 finding Her grandfather up and better, she 
 related the melancholy adventure. 
 
 Paler grew' the pale features of Sir 
 Geohry as she spoke ; terror gleamed in 
 his sunken eyes, and, " The small pox V 9 
 fell from his faultering ashy lips ; Jane had 
 never had that loathsome disease, and her 
 grandfather's forebodings proved too 
 true ; she fevered, and on the tenth day 
 all hope was over ; her parent never left 
 her pillow, despair sat on his brow, and 
 distraction was in his looks \ the angel eye 
 which had beamed with comfort on him, 
 was now closed, and corruption covered 
 every beauty. She lingered and suffered

 long ; but she recovered, and was to 
 the parent's heart more precious than 
 ever ; her beauty seemed to have fallen a 
 victim to the disease ; for her fine eyes 
 were sunk in languor, every lovely feature 
 4vas swoln, and the lily and the rose which 
 had so beautifully blended in her animated 
 face, were now lost in a coarse disgusting 
 red ; her fine hair had been cut off, and she 
 wore a close cap, which, with wasted arms 
 and enfeebled form, altogether presented a 
 woeful figure, for the late blooming and 
 graceful heiress. 
 
 Jane recovered ; but fearful apprehension 
 operating on an enfeebled frame had been 
 too powerful for the doting grandfather ; 
 he felt the approaches of death, and having 
 given Jane leave to dispatch an express for 
 her cousin, he summoned his lawyers, and, 
 as we have related, by his will made Jane

 sole arbitress of her own and cousin's 
 destiny ; and it was to behold their mutual 
 felicity, to behold the child of his son, and 
 the child of his daughter united, that he 
 wished the lamp of life to glimmer a 
 little longer ; objects had become almost 
 imperfect before Hildebrande's arrival ; but 
 he heard his assent ; heard a sacred voice 
 pronounce " Whom God hath joined 
 together, let no man put asunder," and he 
 died satisfied.

 to deposit them with her ancestors, and 
 over these relics, rendered more dear and

 Hildebrande ; she ordered a plain black 
 marble slab, inscribed, with the smple in-

 she left the mausoleum, and returned to

 Jane had always visited the families of 
 merit and distinction in the vicinity of 
 the Abbey, and on this occasion they had 
 paid her every attention and kindness; and 
 vet still Jane found her hours heavy, list- 
 less, and uninteresting; in her heart was 
 the vacuum, her active benificence wanted 
 objects to engage and employ its warm 
 affections. 
 
 She was one morning seated in pensive 
 mood, contemplating the vanity of human 
 expectations, and the insufficiency of wealth 
 and human distinctions to insure felicity, 
 or even her humble sister, content, when 
 the old house steward entered with his 
 weekly accounts.

 Barnaby, after his own business was set- 
 tled ; " is but dullish as one may say, and

 Barnaby hesitated before he added,

 some time, but now wants to rent your 
 cottage on the forest border." 
 
 " You appeared to hesitate, Barnaby, as 
 to her being a lady ; have you any doubts 
 about her ?" 
 
 " Not about her being a lady," he re- 
 plied, " for she is mild, and mannered, 
 and I have learned at the Abbey, that is to 
 be a lady ; but then she does not dress 
 fine, nor yet live on the fat of the land, 
 as folks say, who are always busy about 
 others business, and idle about their own ; 
 and, moreover, she is very good, for when

 hours j she resolved to see her, and a few

 hours after this, the ladies were seated 
 together. 
 
 Mrs. Moreland had that pleasing exte- 
 rior which recommends itself, and being 
 one of those characters, that through a 
 life of vicissitude, had nothing to conceal, 
 Miss De Dunstanville soon learned that her 
 new acquaintance was an officer's widow, 
 who, after every honourable female exer- 
 tion that a gentlewoman could make, was 
 enduring the pressure of indigence, with 
 five children ; her sons, indeed, were not 
 altogether unpatronized, nor unprovided, 
 for the eldest was private secretary to a 
 great man, and the youngest studying for 
 the bar, and during this period, the mother, 
 on a plan of economy, had retired with 
 her daughters, resolving, if opportunity 
 offered, to make their talents contributary

 to their support, for they excelled in music, 
 painting, and fashionable needle works. 
 
 The widow's mind was cultivated and 
 intelligent ; her understanding good > and 
 her manners pleasing and interesting* — 
 Such a personage, through the gloom of a 
 long and dreary winter, and under Jane's 
 circumstances, was con idered a valuable 
 acquisition, and though the border cottage 
 was the widow's nominal home, the Abbey 
 became her chief residence, and she her- 
 self the fiiend and confidante of the v 
 heiress. 
 
 Both the ladies possessed that tempera- 
 ment of soul which acquaintance soon 
 
 ripens into intimacy and esteem, and they 
 
 i 
 found, where sentiment and sympathy of 
 
 thought prepare the way, it does not re- 
 quire long time to establish strict and last- 
 ing friendship.

 affectionate seriousness \ " I should advise

 mystery, and by conferring felicity ^receive

 lady, human life is too productive of evil 
 for creatures of an hour to sport with hap-

 we must not carry romance into real life,

 with perfect conviction ; as the poor Mary 
 Fortrose, she had attached and secured Fitz

 De Hunsfanville, she had been rejected, 
 and the long cherished desire of proving 
 the supremacy of love over gratitude,

 have excited a passion without interesting

 called forth bitter sarcasm and chilling 
 scorn ; she declared she " could neither 
 marry a man who only loved her for a 
 pretty face, or who would not prefer her 
 in herself with competency, to one with

 desire to visit the interior of the family

 excursion 3 and notwithstanding that the 
 ground was damp, neither being delicate 
 enough to be afraid of a wet foot ; they 
 left the carriage, and with sentiments of 
 reverence, entered the hallowed sanctuary 
 of death, 
 
 Jane had given the tribute of a fond 
 and grateful tear at her beloved grand- 
 father 's tomb, and Mrs. Moreland was 
 softly repeating Boetius* reflection — 
 
 " Blush to think that glory's plan,

 When Jane exclaiming, " Oh God !

 trembling, with an astonishment, not un- 
 blended with terror.

 They raised a cold damp hand, it fell

 ;; contains the ancestors of De Dunstan- 
 ville for many generations." 
 
 Jane hoped these explanations had satis- 
 fied him, and that he would rationally 
 account for his appearance and curiosity, 
 she therefore added, cl But how should 
 any thing here interest a stranger ?" 
 
 He repeated, trembling violently, — 
 cc How, indeed, should any thing here 
 interest a stranger ? but I am an obtruder 
 also, and with thanks, young lady, for your 
 humanity, as I now feel recovered, I will 
 take my leave." 
 
 He was meanly attired, and his appear- 
 ance indicated poverty ; Jane thought it 
 sanctioned the offer of assistance ; " You 
 may be distant from home, Sir ?" said 
 she, in soft and respectful accents ; " and 
 far from your friends, and as you seem 
 infirm, allow me, without offence, to offer

 what will indeed be a pleasure if you 
 accept." 
 
 The stranger was now on his feet, and 
 though his habit was mean, a conscious 
 superiority seemed to dignify his figure, 
 and a proud energy to shine in his eyes." 
 
 u I do think/' said he, thoughtfully, 
 and bowing low, " that you would not 
 offend ?" 
 
 (i Indeed, Sir, I would not," replied she, 
 penetrated by his manner, and affected 
 almost to tears ; " pray, then, take this 
 purse, and should your necessities ever 
 want relief, do not forget that the heiress 
 of De Dunstanville considers herself the 
 responsible almoner of heaven, enabled by 
 its bounty, to distribute comfort among 
 the less affluent and happy sons and daugh- 
 of humanity." 
 
 He took the purse in silence, looked at

 it a moment, and then put it in his 
 bosom. 
 
 Jane bade him farewell, and motioned to 
 retire. 
 
 " One moment stay," said he detaining 
 " her, in early life I knew Sir GeofTry De 
 Dunstanville $" he paused—" in condition 
 I was inferior ; divided interest, separate 
 wishes— but the destroying storm is at 
 peace ; the grave subdues resentments,

 more — no — no — no — no more l ,f 
 
 Anguish was seated on his pale cheek, 
 his eye gleamed sadly, and irrepressible 
 agony shook his enfeebled frame. Again 
 he grew calm, dejectedly calm, and in a 
 voice tremulous from emotion, he cried, 
 " Leave me, and allow me yet some 
 moments here, 9 *

 " The place is cold and damp/' said Jane 
 more interested from his having known 
 her grandfather, " and the scene melan- 
 choly, it may affect your health and spirits ; 
 be persuaded then, come to the abbey and 
 take refreshment." 
 
 He looked in her face — the look was 
 fearful ; he took her hand, his own shook 
 as if in deathly tremors. 
 
 " No child, no," and his voice was 
 scarcely audible, "only tell me,- I remem- 
 ber — I forget — was not- -is not — " he 
 could articulate no more, but wringing 
 Jane's hand, and starting from her as if 
 maddened by the horror of some sudden 
 thought, he staggered from among the. 
 tombs, and was seen through the leafless 
 trees, with quick and unequal steps, pursu- 
 ing the path-way leading to the great 
 road.

 Jane and her friend returned to the 
 abbey, meditating on the extraordinary- 
 appearance, and wild incoherent manner 
 of the stranger. " Early circumstances 
 seem to oppress and agonize his memory," 
 said Mrs. Moreland, " it almost borders on 
 mental derangement." 
 
 " Surely I have seen him some where," 
 added Jane, " nay I have heard his voice ; 
 it vibrates on memory like my grand- 
 father^ ; some mystery is certainly con- 
 nected with his history, and appearance 
 here, and his acceptance of -the purse 
 bespeaks him poor," 
 
 " I am not of that opinion," said Mrs. 
 Moreland, . " he did not receive it with 
 either the manner or humility of a mendi- 
 cant j the eye of want would have sparkled 
 at such a donation, I cannot help thinking 
 also, that he looked for some name among

 the dead which he could not find, or found 
 one he did not expect ; but our conjectures 
 are vain, time may develope what we can- 
 not penetrate." 
 
 These observations brought the ladies to 
 the abbey, where the cheering comfort of 
 a blazing fire, was most acceptable to their 
 aching feet, and benumbed fingers.

 Surprise rather than pleasure filled Jane's 
 artless bosom, on perusing such affectionate 
 effusions from a stranger ; her understand- 
 ing was too good to be pleased with the 
 adulation, though the professions of regard, 
 and the ardent wish for her acquaintance, 
 could not but gratify her gentle nature, and 
 excite in a heart warm, generous, and 
 candid, emotions of gratitude ; added to 
 these considerations, Jane had no disincli- 
 nation to pleasure, and above all, Hilde- 
 brande Fitz Ormond was in London ; they 
 might often meet, and the denouement 
 of their tale could be more easily accom- 
 plished, and more pleasantly managed 
 than at the abbey. 
 
 On some points she was, however, 
 predetermined, among which were not to 
 separate from Mrs. Moreland, on wl ose 
 judgment and friendship she could Confide,

 and to have her own establishment. Jane 
 needed no accommodation ; her fortune 
 was immense, she had never been accus- 
 tomed to controul or restriction from her 
 grandfather, and could anticipate the pain 
 if any were attempted by relatives ; she, 
 therefore, resolved to decline making 
 Lady" Clancarron's residence her home; 
 but to be her own mistress, with Mrs, 
 Moreland for her chaperon till under the 
 happy and legal protection of her adored, 
 and adoring Fitz Ormond.

 dent," said she, smiling •, " encountered a 
 stranger, his wits bewildered ; returned

 invitations to London ; journey proposed ;

 " You delight me with your gaiety," 
 said her friend, " what an interesting cor-

 her vein of humour, " we shall assuredly 
 publish the heiress and her country friend

 Jane suddenly looked grave, " Friend /"

 inexperienced young woman, under very 
 peculiar circumstances, with feelings to

 you, indeed, forsake me, desert me, when 
 I need you most ?"

 you speak to one your friendship has

 ed ?" 
 
 " Oh poor me ! at what a distance I am 
 tossed !" cried Jane, penetrating her mo- 
 tives, " why I am thrown as far as De Dun- 
 stanville from London j and as for poor 
 friendship,it freezes like a Lapland night." 
 
 " The distance between us is, indeed, 
 immense," resumed Mrs. Moreland, " Miss 
 De Dunstanville ought to. have an intro- 
 ductress to life, of rank and consequence, 
 one known, and approved , one graced 
 with the distinctions of the world, and 
 who could give distinction in the world.

 scure and unknown ; and though born 
 and bred in superior life, its helplessness 
 and a painful retrospection make the 
 whole of my possessions ; is this an intro- 
 duction to scenes of fashion for the heiress

 of De Dunstanville ? No, I will be the 
 faithful guardian of your interests and 
 wishes here, pray for your felicity, and 
 endeavour to promote it." 
 
 " All this sounds admirably well," re- 
 plied Jane, playfully, " but sound it only is, 
 for if Mrs. Moreland do not leave all her 
 soberness, and humbleness, and little- 
 ness, and accompany the great heiress to 
 the great wicked town of London, and 
 take all the trouble in her household, tell 
 her what to do, and not to do, what to 
 say, and not to say, what to think, and 
 not to think, and be her own friend, her 
 Olson mamma, her own every thing, why

 and — and — and — do every thing that is 
 wrong, except ceasing to love her own 
 beloved Mrs. Moreland ;" and with these 
 words her snowy arms encompassed the 
 neck of a grateful friend, and great and 
 happy is that fortune which can secure 
 such a treasure ; more precious than the 
 brightest gems that deck the glittering 
 coronet ; it is the cordial drop thrown 
 into the bitter cup of life by a bounteous 
 Deity ; when it enters the sorrowing heart, 
 sorrow is softened ; when it enters the 
 happy heart, happiness is safe. 
 
 " Friendship, mysterious cement of the soul, 
 Man owes thee more than man can ever pay."

 to Lady Clancarron's letter 5 assured her, 
 she was grateful for her invitation, would 
 be happy to deserve her friendship, consi-

 dered her patronage a distinction, and the 
 esteem of her family a high gratification \ 
 declined a residence en famille^ as she had 
 a maternal friend who honoured her 
 with a parent's care and tenderness; but 
 if her ladyship would engage a house, 
 and condescend to give necessary orders, 
 as to furniture, carriages, servants, &c. it 
 would add an obligation to the many her 
 kindness had already conferred. 
 
 Jane made every judicious arrangement 
 for the comfort of her household at De 
 Dunstanville, and accompanied by Mrs. 
 Moreland and her daughters in a fine 
 frosty morning towards the end of January, 
 she quitted the lofty turrets of her ances- 
 tors, and set out for the metropolis. 
 While they are pursuing their journey, we 
 will more particularly introduce the 
 Countess of Clancarron and her family.

 The reader may not have forgotten that 
 her ladyship previous to her marriage was 
 a rich city heiress, who had sighed to 
 exchange her father's bags for a coronet \ 
 the future pages of this history will be the 
 best and most candid description of her 
 nature and character, at present it will 
 suffice to say, she was mother to a son and 
 daughter ; the son now inherited his 
 father's dignities, and the daughter an 
 independent fortune when of age. 
 ' The countess herself might have been 
 said hitherto to keep tolerably fair with 
 the fashionable world ; that is, she always 
 paid her bills when she could no longer 
 help doing it ; it was declared a terrible 
 bore ; but as it would have been a worse 
 bore to have had all the golden tripods, 
 antique vases, classic draperies, &c. tum- 
 bled into barbarous confusion by the rude

 knock-down blows of a vile broker's 
 hammer, why Lady Clancarron's trades- 
 people were sometimes paid ; then her 
 ladyship^ had very accommodating man- 
 ners, and convenient ways and means of 
 obliging friends ; cards, rouge et noir, and 
 faro tables, were always ready ; they were 
 very fascinating to her friends, and bril- 
 liantly productive to her friends' friend. 
 
 Satire and censure be still ! — Do not 
 other countesses the same ? 
 
 Then if young pigeons with golden plu- 
 mage, soft turtles with doting mates, did 
 par hazard, fall in among the vultures, 
 hawks, falcons, and other birds of prey, 
 which infest the hemisphere of fashion, 
 could the countess of Clancarron, or any 
 other countess help, if the plumage of a 
 pigeon glittered on the wing of a hawk, 
 or the down of a turtle lined the pocket

 of a falcon ? No ! No ! Do not other 
 countesses the same ? Too surely yes - P 
 therefore, Lady Clancarron stood very 
 well with the fashionable world, and as 
 for any other world it never entered into 
 the geography of her conscience. 
 
 Her son, her accomplished son, her 
 house's hope, her family's pride, what was 
 he not ? He aimed at every thing, and 
 was every thing — but what he ought to 
 be ; a buck, a blood, a boxer, and a 
 whip ; a petit maitre, a Listless, a fop, and 
 a fool, all he alternately assumed j he 
 could game, drink, and intrigue ; kept 
 running horses, sporting dogs, and 
 dashing mistresses ; he was a good whip, 
 for he drove four in hand ; a knowing 
 one, for he always took the odds against 
 Falcon ; he was a sweet fellow, and a 
 happy fellow with the ladies, for Miss

 tV would nod to him in the ring ; 
 
 Lady B slap him with her whip in 
 
 rotten row, and even the notorious Mrs. 
 ■ has been known to thinks when 
 
 guineas were, that Clancarron's guineas 
 shone as brightly as even a DukeY gui- 
 neas ; but to reach the grand climax of 
 tonish notoriety, his gallant Lordship had 
 once to pay damages; but, to descend from 
 these heights of celebrity, the Earl was 
 rather vicious from example than the 
 impulse of passion, and preferred being 
 conspicuously wicked and ridiculous, than 
 rational and consistent ; his understanding 
 was weak, and altogether under his mo- 
 ther's dominion ; his figure was indif- 
 ferent, and his countenance gave little 
 promise of intellect. Ills courage was 
 never doubted, because never tried ; and 
 to those silly weaknesses, which the silly

 ones of the earth term virtues, he was 
 never known to yield \ and we have now 
 only further to observe, that, notwithstand- 
 ing our peer's long minority, so dexterous- 
 ly had he and his boon companions played 
 the game of dissipation, that again the old 
 turrets of Clancarron tottered, and 
 threatened to leave the earl without aa 
 acre. 
 
 The court, the city, and all Mamma's 
 stratagems had failed in procuring him an 
 heiress, and a convenient nervous disorder 
 having much debilitated the countess, by 
 the advice of the faculty, the family set 
 out for Lisbon, with an intention of pass- 
 ing two years there. 
 
 In this fine climate, fine news reached 
 them ; the countess read in the English 
 papers : " Lately died, universally regretted, 
 the beneficent and equally beloved Sir

 GeofTry De Dunstanville, Baronet ; be- 
 queathing to his grand-daughter Jane, the 
 immense fortune of twenty thousand 
 pounds a year, besides a large accumula- 
 tion of funded property.'' 
 
 The voice of fame added, " that the 
 heiress being as rich in virtues and beauty 
 as in possessions, she gave pleasing promise 
 of supporting the honours of her ancient 
 house with dignity, and rendering her 
 wealth a general blessing." 
 
 And now probably the secret foldings of 
 her ladyship's heart may be penetrated ; 
 and without the gift of divination her 
 purposes developed in hastening to 
 England, and writing so kind an invitation 
 to the heiress to visit London. 
 
 Lady Clancarron predetermined that 
 her son should fall violently in love with 
 his cousin at the first glance, and in

 sincerity, and to do the young peer's passion 
 strict justice, the first coup d'ceil he men- 
 tally took of lands, hereditaments, leases, 
 and all appurtenances to boot, sent a thrill- 
 ing sensation through every fibre of his 
 frame ; and while horses, dogs, cards, 
 carriages, and mistresses, crowded tumultu- 
 ously over his enraptured imagination, he 
 exclaimed, u Paralyze me, Madam, but I 
 see acres in her every look; hear her 
 guineas in every word ; and feel the 
 ecstatic touch of her bank notes in every 
 pressure of her lily hand." 
 
 While introducing this family of ton 
 Lady Florence must not be forgotten, 
 because she will make a considerable figure 
 in these pages ; her appearance was fashion- 
 able, and her face would have been fine, 
 but the pride, envy, and malign passions of 
 a little mind, gave dark expression to

 every feature ; her feelings began where 
 they ended, in self; to natural affections 
 she was a stranger, and the gentle charities 
 of life she never knew -> her nature was 
 composed of the darkest materials ; mean- 
 ness and cunning, malice and hypocrisy ; 
 the fiercer passions lurked in her heart 
 ready to blaze forth on the slightest pro- 
 vocation ; withering envy was in her 
 breath, and detractive rancour sat upon her 
 tongue ; and never did this member of 
 fashion feel so gratified as when put in 
 possession of some slanderous tale, or 
 calumniating fabrication, which her own 
 malign invention could improve and 
 
 enlarge, till the fair name and character

 were blasted by the destroying influence.

 title, and so great was her extravagance 
 and attachment to gaming, that she was

 Jane's commission to the countess to 
 engage her a house, and provide a proper 
 establishment for her reception, was a 
 most agreeable and most opportune office, 
 as it not only gave her ladyship credit with 
 Miss De Dunstanville's banker, but 
 enabled her to make conditions, and certain 
 arrangements with trades-people, who, on 
 her return to the metropolis, would have 
 been particularly troublesome and impati- 
 ent j few could manoeuvre more judicious- 
 ly than Lady Clancarron ; consequently it 
 was no great wonder that the noble family 
 had never appeared in the sphere of fashion 
 with such brilliancy and eclat as it did 
 this auspicious season ; and as her ladyship

 had a deep and delicate game to play, the 
 first sporter she threw out, was,— but in 
 profound secrecy to some dear, dear 
 friends, who were to communicate it, she 
 knew, to their dear friends, who would 
 just hint it again to their's, and so on till it 
 took its circuit, gathering additions and 
 improvements, and at length became the 
 reigning topic of the day — it was, that the 
 late worthy Sir Geoffry DeDunstan ville, ever 
 warmly attached to the Clancarron family, 
 had expressed a dying wish for the closest 
 and dearest alliance to unite the names and 
 interests of the illustrious parties ; but it 
 was "wonderful to Lady Clancarron — Yes, 
 reader, her ladyship looked wonderstruck, 
 how such secret and domestic arrange- 
 ments could transpire ; though one of her 
 own emissaries had taken directions a few 
 mornings before from herself for para-

 graphs to be inserted in various fashion-

 than supposed the domestic sphere of a 
 certain northern countess would soon be 
 illumined by a star, which, in conjunction 
 with the lord ascendant of the house, would 
 become a constellation, whose radiant fire, 
 would set the whole system of the fashion- 
 able world in a blaze." 
 
 " The implication and application," said 
 the countess, attempting to look dissatisfied 
 as she spoke to a supposed dear friend, "they 
 are both, my dear Lady Denham, too 
 plain ; and though in confidence to you, I 
 acknowledge a possibility, and, indeed, 
 as my young relation invests me with 
 power, unrestricted power, to direct every 
 thing, I might add probability, yet you can

 very dear to me, the thing, therefore, is 
 desirable, and though I may wish for the i 
 young people being united, they shall act 
 unbiassed by me, shall act as they please. 
 Alas ! I knew the bliss of mutual love, of 
 mutual confidence with my ever-lamented 
 lord, and never will I interfere in the 
 wishes of his beloved representative. Miss 
 De Dunstanville is very amiable, and her 
 ready acquiescence,with Sir GeofFry's desire 
 certainly endears her ; but Clancarron has 
 a heart, a proud heart, tenacious of its 
 privileges and prerogatives, and entre nous, 
 already frowns at the officious intermeddl- 
 ing paragraphist, who so presumptuously 
 anticipate what a lady never thought of, 
 and what he himself never may think of?' 
 " Assuredly, my dear countess," cried 
 Lady Denham, well penetrating the 
 character she had to deal with, " you

 must feel how presumptuous and prema-

 his lordship justly observes, the young 
 lady never thought of." 
 
 " But I did not tell you, she never 
 thought of it ;" interrupted Lady Clancar- 
 ron, provoked at the retort courteous from 
 her dear friend. 
 
 " It would be superfluous, countess, quite 
 superfluous to me j for to let you into the 
 secret committee of my confidantes, I can 
 justify his lordship's assertion, that Miss 
 De Dunstanviile never, indeed, did think, 
 and what is more positive and explicit, 
 never will think of such an alliance ; and 
 Lady Clancarron should glory in a son 
 whose magnanimous soul can greatly 
 determine to resign the pursuit of an 
 heiress, whose bright appendages, it must

 accommodating to peers, who have a 
 whimsical mania for horses and dogs ; cards 
 and curricles ; wine and women ; with a 
 long etcetera in the account current of a 
 modern man of fashion." 
 
 " Really, Lady Denham's humour is so 
 infinitely agreeable this morning, and so 
 full of point,*' cried the fair Lady Florence, 
 " that it is almost barbarous to remind 
 your ladyship, that West waits the final 
 decision of your taste, whether Clancar- 
 ron's picture for our Jane is to represent 
 him mounting his horse, or, like Hamlet, 
 leaning on the earth at her feet." 
 
 " Not on the earth, for pity's sake," 
 cried Lady Denham with a laugh provok- 
 ingly satirical, " not on earth, my dear 
 friends, do not let him lean there, ' it is a

 with its gayest pennants flying, were 
 dashing along the stream. Each heart 
 was beating with tumultuous hopes and 
 improbable expectations, which the 
 innocent, unconscious Jane was either to 
 realize, or annihilate for ever. At length 
 she arrived at the splendid residence pre- 
 pared for her reception in Portman Square ; 
 and while she and Mrs. Moreland are 
 occupied in making domestic arrange- 
 ments, it may not prove uninteresting to 
 look after Hildebrande Fitz Ormond. 
 
 It may be remembered there was an 
 inexplicable charm in the manners of Jane, 
 that had irresistibly operated on his feelings 
 and senses, and attracted his heart ; and 
 though the most extravagant flights of 
 imagination could never have approached 
 the reality, he quitted her presence in that 
 whirl of thought, and confusion of wild

 ideas, that it bore some similitude to a 
 disordered brain, and by the time he reached 
 London, he was in a delirious fever, which 
 confined him for several weeks. At length 
 youth, with a fine constitution, unimpair- 
 ed by dissipated pleasure, triumphed over 
 disease, and he recovered. His fevered 
 imagination had become calm, the stormy 
 emotions had subsided, and that reflection, 
 which generally accompanies the languor 
 of slow recovery, enabled him to compose 
 the fluctuations of conflicting passions, 
 while it in some degree tranquillized his 
 mind to prepare for the future, and those 
 vexations, which in one way or other are 
 inseparable from the condition of human 
 life. His mind now began to regain its 
 accustomed energy ; his understanding 
 resumed its active powers, and he could 
 calmly recollect *, could separate and

 arrange his ideas. ; and his first rational 
 resolve was, to seek out Mary Fortrose, 
 and allow his interview with her to decide 
 his future fate. He believed her finances ' 
 very confined, and as Mrs. Fortrose had 
 always proudly acknowledged herself 
 dependent on Sir Geoffry's bounty, he 
 judged the daughter's expectations must 
 be very moderate indeed ; yet this nothing 
 moved his firm devotion to her ; he felt 
 he could be happier with her in the 
 narrowest circle of human comfort, even 
 if- exertion and labour made up the 
 deficiencies of fortune, than in the posses- 
 sion of De Dunstanville, without her 
 participation in its felicities and luxuries \ 
 added to these considerations, which he 
 determined to point out to this sovereign, 
 disposer of his future destiny, with all the 
 glowing energies of youthful passion, he

 had, from the princely allowance of his 
 late grandfather, and the munificent 
 presents of his cousin, realized a sum 
 which in the bosom of retirement, with 
 frugality and economy, would not only 
 supply the necessaries and comforts of 
 domestic life, but many of its elegancies. 
 
 Hope now raised her fairy wand, and a 
 brilliant perspective arose, with a long 
 succession of gay hopes, and high unceas- 
 ing delight rushed over his enraptured 
 imagination, and in idea he beheld some 
 sequestered spot imparadised by her angel 
 presence and participation ; but poor Fitz 
 Ormond found his gay airy fabric unsub- 
 stantial as the evanescent sun-beam in an 
 April sky. All that followed was marked 
 with disappointment, increasing per- 
 plexity, and a long train of evils, which 
 his buoyant spirits had never calculated for

 being in his catalogue of possibilities. Full, 
 however, of his ideal plans, which ,strength- 
 ened by encouragement, were almost 
 brightening into reality the moment he 
 was able to walk, he set out for Park Lane, 
 where the late Mrs. Fortrose had resided 
 when in town. 
 
 With a trepidation equally, experienced 
 by the gay, as well as the gloomy anticipa- 
 tion of the future, he knocked at the well- 
 remembered door - 7 it was answered by a 
 footman, not in mourning, and in a strange 
 livery. 
 
 " Mrs. Fortrose," stammered Fitz 
 Ormond, and would have added 1 know is 
 dead ; — " but Miss Fortrose, is Miss 
 Fortrose at home ?' 
 
 The fellow's sneer, and abrupt interrup- 
 tion of " Yes, the old one is dead, and the

 young one, no body here knows where 
 she is." 
 
 " Fellow !" cried Fitz Ormond, the 
 anguish of unexpected disappointment 
 adding irritation to impatience, "attend 
 me to your master, to your mistress, to 
 any one within." 
 
 His insolence now shrunk before Fitz 
 Ormond's look, and with a fawning bow, 
 he believed the butler, or house-keeper, 
 might have received directions ; he would 
 enquire ; and glad to escape himself, 
 another, rather more civil, conducted him 
 into a room where in a very few minutes 
 the housekeeper made her appearance. 
 
 Bowing to the good dame, he intreated 
 to know where he might find Miss For- 
 trose ? when she left the house? with- 
 whom she went ? how she looked ? and, 
 indeed, he made so many enquiries in such

 quick succession, that poor dame notable 
 was at a loss which she should answer 
 first, to give the most satisfaction ; and 
 with less prolixity than impatience 
 generally meets on these occasions, she 
 replied, " that her master had hired the 
 house from the late Sir Geoffry De 
 Dunstanvilie's solicitor; that Miss Fortrose 
 was very well, but took on sadly for 
 Madam's death, and that after the funeral 
 she set off, she believed, for De Dunstan- 
 ville abbey/' 
 
 " De Dunstanville Abbey!" he repeated, 
 starting with astonishment ; " impossible." 
 
 " Is it ?" said his informer, and the 
 uncertainty rendered him half mad. 
 
 " Can — can you give me no farther 
 information ? did she leave no message, 
 no letter, no direction if any one enquired 
 for her ? — if — if" — he hesitated, and some

 feeling like mortified pride, blended with 
 the bitterness of disappointed expectation, 
 held him silent, while the housekeeper, 
 as if recollecting herself, added, " Now, 
 I remember, Sir, she did call before she 
 left London, and bade me take care of all 
 letters, particularly foreign letters ; so if 
 you like to leave one, I will give it when 
 she sends." 
 
 The housekeeper had reason to say she 
 was to take care of all letters, particularly 
 foreign letters ; for when Sir Geoffry's 
 solicitor let the house, these directions 
 were not only given in writing by Jane, 
 who knew Fitz Ormond could only address 
 her there, but to insure the performance 
 of them, she added a piece of paper, which 
 is found to have wonderful efficacy on 
 these occasions ; yet this very prudent 
 superintendent of the stores, with the

 littleness of little minds, in order to 
 enhance the value of her own services, 
 affected indifference ; but no sooner had 
 her stratagem succeeded, and Fitz Ormond 
 presented his douceur also, than she 
 perfectly recollected the lady had been 
 most particular in her orders, and promised 
 to send regularly every week, which she 
 had done. So if he pleased to write, she 
 would take care of the letter, and send it 
 the very first time her messsenger called." 
 This intelligence rendered Fitz Ormond 
 comparatively easy ; he trod again on air -> 
 visions of bliss re-appeared, and as hope 
 revived, it illumined the path of futurity, 
 and discovered his Mary breaking through 
 the mist of disappointment and absence, 
 and meeting him with tenderness unalter- 
 able and unaltered as his own.

 Never had the hours of absence seemed 
 so lingering and long to Fitz Ormond as 
 the suspensive moments he now endured ; 
 and spite of every effort, and every fondly 
 recollected proof of his Mary's attachment, 
 a nameless apprehension pervaded his 
 mind, and gave a sorrowful hue to the 
 most vivid colourings in which hope ar- 
 rayed his future perspective ; still he would 
 picture himself her husband ; sinless, se- 
 rene, and untroubled with the tumults of

 to dispose of his carriage, curricle, and

 fortune and fashion, which, though per-

 Sir Geohry De Dunstanviile's heir, was 
 by no means appropriate to the circum-

 Ormond, while at college, and for some 
 time on the continent, had been acquaint- 
 ed, though dissimilarity of tastes, habits, 
 and pursuits, had precluded intimacy ; 
 still they were visiting acquaintances, and 
 Fitz Ormond being a young man of figure, 
 with equipage, and always an ample com- 
 mand of money, which his generosity had 
 often made very convenient to his less 
 opulent and more extravagant associates. 
 His Lordship, on meeting him in London, 
 thought on consideration, and after a se- 
 cret council with his mother, that the un- 
 suspicious youth would not prove an un- 
 productive visitor at her Ladyship's card 
 tables. Fitz Ormond was not, therefore, 
 formally invited, but most cordially in- 
 treated to consider himself a relation, and 
 be en familk at Clancarron-house when 
 he pleased.

 not only a morning lounger at Lady Clan-

 her evening parties, and there he learnt 
 Jane had arrived in town, with all the par- 
 ticulars of the families re-union. And 
 this intelligence not only guarded him 
 from expressing surprise, but also enabled 
 him to avoid unexpected, and mal-d-pro- 
 pos encounters. 
 
 He heard, with indignation and (ion- 
 tempt, of their base designs upon her 
 hand and fortune ; but he knew her 
 mind too noble, her sentiments too digni- 
 fied, her taste too refined, and her morals 
 and understanding too good and pure, to 
 feel any alarm on her account ; and though 
 he determined to avoid her sight, as h£

 friendships and by the attention of a bro- 
 ther, testify his reverence and esteem for 
 her virtues and character. 
 
 On his return in the evening to Fla- 
 dong's Hotel, where he lived, a letter, 
 which the loud palpitations of his heart 
 anticipated to be the mandate of destiny 
 from the hand of Mary, was laid before 
 him. 
 
 A cold boding chill crept through his 
 veins as he took it up ; his blood felt 
 icicles, yet his eyes flushed with burning 
 heat, a dizziness seized his head, while 
 his brain seemed on fire, a conflict of tu- 
 multuous feelings overwhelmed his senses, 
 and for some moments his very intellects 
 were confused.

 and raise a barrier, which only infamy 
 would dissolve.

 sentiment pure, warm, dignified, and

 nage, affluence, and distinctions ; brings 
 you the luxurious power of doing good ;

 heir of De Dunstanville must be great ; 
 he must be active, useful, beneficent ; he 
 must not be the slave of enervating feel- 
 ings, nor the favourite playmate of a 
 fond woman.

 u The family of Mrs. Fortrose, for a suc-

 factor in Sir Geoffry De Dunstanville ; 
 Jane De Dunstanville closed her dying 
 eyes, and smoothed her pillow of death. 
 Mary was not more precious to her soul, 
 nor her peace more sacred. In these solemn

 thoughts, and in the awful pause of sepa- 
 rating nature, when the spirit shivering 
 on the brink of untried being, it was then 
 that this mother left her blessing for Fitz

 Jane De Dunstanville; no promise was 
 claimed, no promise was given ; but the 
 nice implication was well understood, and 
 the decision was sanctified by a dying 
 blessing.

 tion so pure, so chaste, so elevated and en- 
 dearing, that only the consciousness of 
 duty could sustain the soul in resigning it 
 for ever ; but virtue alone can constitute 
 human happiness, and would virtue tear the 
 rose of felicity from the bosom of friendship, 
 rend the fine fibre which binds affection to 
 gratitude ? No ! no ! Fitz Ormond could 
 not wish it ; Mary could not do it. Oh ! 
 listen then to the voice of Mary, and take 
 her solemn fervid assurance, that the hour 
 your faith is plighted to Jane, will be the 
 dawn of Mary's felicity. Oh ! more, to 
 Mary will be the sweet bright dawn of 
 your own ; then we shall meet, Fitz Or- 
 mond ; but till then never ! No ! I might

 guish yields to resignation ; and torture 
 finds refuge in insensibility ; therefore, 
 when the violence of Fkz Ormond's pas- 
 sion had exhausted itself, and reason once 
 more asserted her dominion, the strong 
 energies of his superior mind shone forth,

 but the wayward Fitz Ormond cannot 
 even command himself." 
 
 When the first tumult of agitation had 
 subsided, and when he could regulate his 
 feelings, and reduce them to a rational 
 system of action, he persevered in the 
 intention of purchasing the cottage, and 
 there he determined to seclude himself 
 from the world, and devote his hours to 
 literary pursuits. 
 
 His grandfather's last remittance, when 
 he was summoned to attend his dying 
 bed, had made him master of five thou- 
 sand pounds, besides his horses, curricle,

 comparatively rich, and determined, though 
 he scarcely could assign a reason even to

 dissipated enjoyments, still he determined 
 to pass the winter in London. He might 
 meet with the mysterious Mary, the date 
 of her letter, and the shortness of time in 
 which it had reached him, were convic- 
 tions she was in or near town ; he would 
 also be acquainted with Jane's manoeuvres, 
 and though he pre-resolved to studiously 
 avoid her sight, for he really shrunk from 
 that thought, as if her presence had a 
 deadly magic to enslave his very faculties, 
 he felt it would gratify some nameless 
 sentiment to learn her character, and 
 secretly watch her conduct and safety : 
 and almost insensibly to himself a latent 
 hope lay at his heart, that among the 
 crowd of admirers, her brilliant distinc- 
 tions would assemble, she might be 
 tempted to select one who would allow 
 virtues and riches, to veil a most unprc-

 possessing set of features ; then he would 
 be left at liberty, and unnoticed sink 
 into obscurity with competence and 
 Mary. 
 
 Having put matters in train for the pur- 
 chase of his cottage, composed and self- 
 satisfied with his arrangements, he was 
 one morning preparing to leave the hotel 
 for private lodgings, as being more accor- 
 dant with his future plans, when his ser- 
 vant announced Lord Clancarron. 
 
 The peer had that morning passed 
 some important moments with his mo- 
 ther; to thee, Fitz Ormond, they were 
 most inauspicious \ the secret conference 
 concluded with, " Every thing depends 
 on her senses being astonished, dazzled ; 
 she must be carried at once, by a coup de 
 main, or all is lost \ money must be had ;

 debts are high, credit low, something must 
 be done, and quickly.' 9 
 
 " Aye," rejoined his lordship, " it must 
 
 be a dash, and a deep dash too, d n 
 
 me, else all is undone, Pam bang-up al- 
 ready." 
 
 " The tame Fkz Ormond, has he no 
 money ? He used to be convenient to 
 you ; had he no legacy 1" 
 
 " Doubtless !" replied the peer, musing 
 more than was his ordinary custom for a 
 moment, " for he makes a figure ; curricle 
 and horses cost money, he keeps them — 
 and strike me ! here goes it, I have it," 
 putting his fingers to his forehead, " it is 
 here; I'll bang-up ; pull him down, and 
 that will be prime, d n me !" 
 
 And now reader, behold this bang-up 
 peer in the apartment of the unsuspecting 
 Fitz Ormond, prime for a deed, which

 though brilliant in a whip, and becoming 
 a brigand, honour would start at aghast, 
 and justice would deem reward for from 
 the hand of an executioner.

 ec Ah Fitz, how dost i" cries the peer, en- 
 tering the apartment with the ease of a fami- 
 liar; "glad we have met, strike me ! In 
 good condition eh ? Canst help me ? Bank- 
 ers book full? Mothers whims; cursed 
 bore ! Must buy land ; six foot do at last ! 
 Zounds! Fitz, there's a thought — banged-up 
 to Falcon last week ; no cash for a month ! 
 Lend me two thousand, here's a check on 
 Drum monds— cash then plenty !" 
 
 Pen and ink stood most opportune for 
 the purpose; the peer wrote, " One month 
 after date, pay the bearer two thousand 
 pounds," when he knew he neither had, 
 nor would have, credit for two thousand 
 pence.

 Fitz OrmoncTs heart was the honest 
 mansion of truth ; honour its bright inhabi- 
 tant, and generosity the guide of his 
 actions, and his mind being uncontami- 
 nated by one suspicious thought, he put the 
 peer's order in his desk, and, with a smile, 
 returned him his own check, saying, cc He 
 was happy in the power to oblige him. 
 I too," he continued, " am about to pur- 
 chase a nook for my diminished head, and 
 a month hence will equally answer my pur- 
 pose, as now." 
 
 " A month hence," repeated his Lord- 
 ship, " whew ?" whistling, " have the 
 heiress before a month, coming on dash ; 
 a done thing,— in old GeofPs will ;-— must 
 take her — strike me !" 
 
 Fitz Ormond Was struck ; he started ; 
 
 "What was in his will ?" 
 
 The peer liked not the question ; but

 he was seldom at a loss ; deception with 
 its thousand hints stood ever ready. ' 
 " Tell no tales ; — mum's the word." 
 And the purpose of his visit being 
 accomplished, with a sangfroid in charac- 
 ter with his character, he took his leave, 
 and— 
 
 His mother could give her masquerade, 
 at which momentous matters were to be 
 achieved ; and he could purchase Falcon's 
 bays ; bang-up in style to the Dog, and ex- 
 ulting! in his finesse, without one feeling 
 of remorse, when he quitted the presence 
 of hisinjured friend, whose incautious confi- 
 dence had exposed him to his treachery, he 
 hastened to Tattersal's. 
 
 Fitz Ormond looked after him with 
 something of contempt ; " Jane de Duns- 
 tanville descend to such a thing as this !" 
 cried he ruminating, " Resign her gentle- 
 ness, her graces, and" her happiness, to the

 manage a whip, and whose proudest merit 
 a coachman can rival ! forbid it, every 
 better being that guards the good and 
 innocent ! 
 
 u Oh ! may her sense and softness, her 
 graces and generous feelings, find a home 
 in the sacred bosom of honour; meet 
 one with judgment to appreciate worth, 
 and with sentiment to reward attach- 
 ment \" 
 
 And with this prayer Fitz Ormond set 
 out to seek lodgings. 
 
 Jane had with her friend devoted a day 
 or two to domestic arrangements, and 
 then formally announced her arrival to 
 the Clancarron family. 
 
 The countess, with deep design in her 
 heart, and the smile of affection on her 
 lip, accompanied by her son and daughter,

 -it an early hour made their appearance 
 in Jane's morning drawing-room. 
 
 Her ladyship had prepared a long cor- 
 don of adulative compliments, meant to 
 surprise the heiress ; endearments, if she 
 should find them necessary ; and even a 
 few glistening tears to heighten the effect 
 ®f the whole scene. 
 
 Lady Florence was documented to be 
 very tender and full of admiration ; while 
 his lordship was to shine forth in all the 
 glory of the beau monde ; strike her 
 speechless with the elegancies of ton ; 
 stupify her poor country senses by the 
 brilliant flashes of fashionable wit, and 
 the overwhelming display of a sudden and 
 violent passion. 
 
 Only that such characters are not easily 
 abashed, this finished trio must have 
 shrunk beneath the consciousness of their

 own insignificance and base designs, and 
 have ceased from dark operations, when 
 they beheld a demeanour which inspired 
 reverence, and looks which invited esteem. 
 
 Candour and pleasure blended on her 
 beauteous brow, and she gave them all a 
 dignified and graceful welcome, rendered 
 irresistably endearing, by the sweetness of 
 her manners ; but her beauty gnawed the 
 heart of the daughter, while the bright 
 Intelligence beaming in every fine feature, 
 awed the mother to hopelessness. 
 
 His lordship, with his mind's eye full on 
 her acres and guineas, cared not a marvedi 
 either for beauty or graces ; but address- 
 ing her in his best bang-up style, some 
 times excited her laughter, and at others, 
 struck her silent. 
 
 " I protest," said Jane, in a pause of 
 nonsense, " the pleasure of this meeting,

 The countess turned her head with a 
 supercilious smile.

 "y — on — r" had reached its end, a fashion-

 richer glow, " my dearest friend, Mrs.

 could not receive, distinctioneither from

 " A finished eulogium," said her lady- 
 ship, " and a perfect passport to my family 
 and friendship ; Mrs. Moreland I court 
 your acquaintance ; Miss De Dunstanville's 
 friends have every claim on my attention ;

 Jane's hand, " as I am impatient to intro- 
 duce my charming relation, will you join 
 a small select party this evening?" 
 
 " Most willingly, dear madam," said 
 Jane, " but I almost fear my wardrobe too

 " Who may that queer, tame thing, Mrs.

 pet with the heiress?" demanded Lady 
 Florence, white seated at a, hasty diaaer t$

 " A queer thing !" cried his lordship,'*

 Felix Fribble, a constant guest at Clan-

 keeper, purse keeper, and conscience- 
 keeper to the heiress of De Dunstanvilie ; 
 you know my intelligence always correct." 
 
 " Well, I really conceived she was no- 
 body," added, Lady Florence, sipping her 
 Madeira. 
 
 " Nobody !" repeated the countess, 
 asserting all her lord's Highland pride 
 Without one spark of his Highland dig- 
 nity, " Nobody ! we had not then been 
 degraded with such an associate, but being 
 a poor pitiful somebody, the creature, 
 no doubt, will presume to know us in 
 other circles ; for that ridiculous country 
 girl, I am pretty sure, means to introduce 
 her favourite calf every where,"

 sive that Mrs. Moreland's insignificance 
 would attach something degrading to her

 dignity, she could soon have tranquillized 
 her apprehensions ; but there was a pene- 
 tration in Mrs. Moreland's speaking eye, 
 a discriminating judgment, an intelli- 
 gence about her, which, with the power 
 she evidently had over Jane, she feared 
 would penetrate farther into her designs 
 and contrivances, than would suit her 
 purposes to be discovered : her hatred, 
 therefore, bore proportion to her terror, 
 and in the expedition of her plans rested 
 her hope of success, 
 
 " You mentioned, my dear Fribble," 
 said Lady Florence, " Now pray, mamma, 
 leave the odious creature to mortify ; or 
 petrify, or any thing, while I hear from 
 Fribble what I so wish to know ; you 
 mentioned her being secret-keeper to 
 Lady Benvolia." 
 
 A malign curiosity throbbed at her

 heart while she spoke, for it ached for a 
 tale of slander, and she continued, 
 
 " Is it thought Lady Benvolia ever had 
 any secrets worth knowing ? You under- 
 stand me, Fribble; for she is considered 
 a pattern L»r charity and morality, and all 
 the pretty words of which good folks 
 compose the character of christian.'* 
 
 " Had she any secrets !" repeated Sir 
 Fribble, " Aye though not exactly her own, 
 secrets worth knowing ; and I could a tale 
 unfold would harrrow up thy delicate 
 organs." 
 
 " 1 shall positively expire, die, perish, 
 you dear, dear, torturing wretch ! I have

 death of ennui .''

 These half and unconnected sentences 
 composed a fabrication meant to send a 
 barbed arrow, an envenomed sting,intbthe 
 sinking bosom of sorrow, and it was 
 hoped resentment would do its part ; but 
 it is a dark nature that can forget ninety- 
 nine kindnesses, because misapprehension 
 produced one wzkindness. •

 Lady Florence was gratified by the in- 
 formation, her malignant propensity to 
 detraction would not let it sleep; but 
 before she could express the delight she 
 felt, the loud reverberations of the knock- 
 er announced early visitors, and she flew 
 to her toilet. 
 
 Fitz Ormond was now settled in his 
 lodgings, and spending his time most ra- 
 tionally and agreeably ; he was collecting 
 a library and laying up a store of informa- 
 tion and amusement for the days of retire- 
 ment. 
 
 The circumstances of Fitz Ormond's life 
 had given his feelings a tincture of enthu- 
 siasm ; he felt proudly satisfied with him- 
 self; that he could resign all the distinctions 
 and luxuries which a marriage with his cou- 
 sin would secure, and with a humble compe* 
 tence retire to a cottage with the unpor*

 tioned Mary ; " Jane must reverence the 
 sentiment that rejects her; and Mary must 
 appreciate the affection that selects her," 
 said he to himself; " I shall be dear to one, 
 I shall be loved by the other." Indulging 
 the enchantments of hope, he would then 
 raise an imaginary fabrick of felicity, that 
 imparadised his senses, when the recollec- 
 tion of Mary's romantic rejection would 
 dissolve his visionary bliss, and again poor 
 Fitz Ormond suffered the pangs of appre- 
 hension and suspense. 
 
 To beguile the tedium of his solitary

 lowing lines.

 And kissed the stream whose rippling tide, 
 With deeper, softer blush was dyed. 
 Where nature smiling, sportive maid, 
 Along its flowery margin strayed, 
 In dalliance with the breeze that blew, 
 And filled her vest to feast his view. 
 While as the verdure brushed her feet, 
 Earth's choicest stores, with life replete, 
 Burst into light and Zephyr lent, 
 Each rising flower the grateful scent. 
 Himself had slol'n — with inward glee,

 That now no more her heart was sad, 
 As pensive when she sought the glade j 
 And marvell'd she could thus feel less 
 Fatigued with pleasure in excess. 
 But love who heard, would smiling, say, 
 'Twas he that blessed life's happiest day, 
 On pleasure : pleasure still must cloy, 
 With none to share congenial joy. 
 Then stealing near again would sip, 
 Ambrosial fragrance from her lip. 
 And when she closed her eyes in rest, 
 Would slumb'ring nestle to her breast.

 Fitz Ormond had a large and fashion- 
 able acquaintance; but his understanding 
 could not approve their habits and prin- 
 ciples, consequently, they neither could 
 interest his feelings nor attach his heart ; 
 he allowed Lord Clancarron claims as a 
 relation, but his character had too much 
 insignificance as a man, to be chosen as an 
 intimate \ he had reprehensible weaknesses, 
 and was altogether too much a creature of 
 the world to interest one sentiment of his 
 heart ; to his vicious nature and unprin- 
 cipled mind, Fitz Ormond was altogether a 
 stranger, and his knowledge came too 
 late to save him from his deceptions. 
 
 That he had borrowed the two thou- 
 sand pounds for any other purposes than 
 to make a purchase of lands, and that it 
 would not be punctually repaid at the 
 period promised, had never glanced across

 his open generous mind, until a few days 
 after his opinions were rather staggered by 
 intelligence, not the most agreeable, from 
 one whose truth and integrity admitted of 
 no doubt. 
 
 He was seated in a bookseller's shop one 
 morning, surrounded by huge folios and 
 classical authors, when a voice, his heart 
 acknowledged, saluted him with, "What ! 
 my old Chum Fitz Orrncnd ! my dear 
 fellow, not tired of alma mater yet'? 
 Prithee leave thy old musty friends, and 
 come a little among the moderns." 
 
 Fitz Ormond instantly arose, and highly 
 gratified with the rencontre, accompanied 
 his equally pleased friend to a neighbour- 
 ing coffee house ; but as this young 
 gentleman deserves an introduction, and 
 to know him being a distinction, while 
 the friends take their chocolate, the author

 begs leave to introduce the character of 
 Mr. Murray. 
 
 During the time Fitz Ormond had been 
 at college, he had contracted an intimacy 
 with this young gentleman, which, if it 
 did not reach the height of friendship, 
 was rather from want of time to mature 
 the sentiment, than from any dissimilarity 
 of taste or principle. 
 
 Mr. Murray was maternally descended 
 from the noblest blood in Scptland ; and 
 his father sustained that most honourable 
 character, a British merchant j this son, 
 the inheritor of his wealth and virtues, to 
 si fine prepossessing figure, added a culti- 
 vated understanding and a superior mind; 
 but one . simple descriptive trait will 
 better delineate his heart, than if a pane- 
 gyrist's pen offered him the tribute of a 
 volume.

 He was one morning in his house of 
 business, passing through a throng of 
 clerks, when the words, " My relations 
 know nothing of shops, nor shopkeepers 1" 
 attracted his notice ; there might have 
 been something haughty in the tone and 
 manner of the words, for they sprung 
 from the swelling bosom of a proud boy, 
 the orphan son of an officer. Pride be- 
 comes either good or bad as we apply it ; 
 it is only wrong when we establish it on 
 wrong principles ; but in a mind properly 
 regulated, it becomes a stimulus to virtue, 
 and the sacred fence between poverty and 
 meanness. 
 
 Mr. Murray took an early opportunity 
 to question this youth, and in a voice of 
 kindness, requested an explanation of 
 words, he could not understand from one 
 in trade.

 Though the highest and proudest blood 
 of Caledonia circulated in this little lad's 
 veins, he had greatly dared to step beyond 
 the limit society prescribes to gentleman, 
 he repressed the rising thought of a proud 
 lineage, and smiled at the pity of the 
 little mind that could not appreciate his 
 motives, and entered business. Such a spirit 
 might confer, it could not receive, honour 
 from any rank ; for, added to the effort, 
 unshrinkingly and uncomplaining he en- 
 countered — mighty God ! What re- 
 proach ! What humiliation ! What suf- 
 fering did he not encounter ! In thy 
 book, great judge of the human heart, let 
 these things be noted. 
 
 The generous Murray had, indeed, a 
 mind ; he took the little trader by the 
 hand, presented him to his noble mother

 and lovely sisters, and introduced him to 
 characters that dignify human nature. 
 
 It is to be hoped the youth's condition 
 will improve, and Providence place him 
 in one more adapted to his talents, birth, 
 and education, and it will give a quicker 
 throb to his glowing bosom, when he can 
 exclaim, " I rise something nearer the 
 liberal-minded Murray ! he knows who I 
 am, he can then say "what I am.

 sidered very eccentric," said Mr. Murray,

 years ago, he did not see you." 
 
 " The circumstance was singular, I 
 allow," replied Fitz Ormond; " yet I 
 owed him much ; owe his memory much, 
 however wayward fancy, by taking retro- 
 grade motions, may disappoint his views."

 him, and too candid to conceal his own, 
 as he supposed for another ; he, therefore, 
 frankly rejoined, " The honour would be 
 undeserved, and unaccepted ; for my 
 heart has been devoted to another since I 
 knew that I had a heart.*' 
 
 " I hear your cousin is a perfect Helen ; 
 and what with her gold, and what with 
 her graces, she sets the world of fashion 
 in a blaze ; you must positively introduce 
 me ; gold I do not want, graces — sense — 
 and the senses bow submissive thei*." 
 
 <c I never saw Miss De Dunstanville but 
 once,'* said Fitz Ormond, " and then her 
 beauty did not particularly strike or in- 
 terest me ; but if you really desire an 
 introduction to this Helen, the Clancarron 
 family will be gratified in your acquain- 
 tance, and there she is almost enfamille"

 " You shall hear ; the other morning I 
 strolled into Tatter sal's, merely pour passer

 Fitz Ormond eould not at that instant

 the deception practised on his guileless

 his innately honourable principles, that

 The morning after Mrs. Moreland's arrival 
 in Portman Square^ she had dispatched 
 letters to both her sons with the hu-

 the youthful Alfred, glowing in manly 
 loveliness, attended Jane's breakfast table ; 
 the rose of health bloomed brightly on 
 his cheek, and the rich sparkle of a heart 
 at ease shone in his fine eyes ; he was 
 grown taller and finely proportioned, and 
 never had his figure looked so gracefully 
 interesting, as when, in a transport of filial 
 love, he folded his doting mother in his 
 arms.

 herself,

 Jane, who had stood gazing with new and 
 indefinable pleasure on the animated 
 youth before her ; " were I not all Fitz

 to charm ; " take me, accepi me for your 
 sister ; will you, Mr. Alfred ?" 
 
 " You are very cruel, madam, to Lily 
 and Belle,"' he replied. 
 
 " Cruel, my young friend 1" 
 
 " Cruel," he repeated, bowing respect- 
 fully over the prettiest little hand he had 
 ever touched, " for I should then soon 
 forget them, and indeed, myself too, I 
 fear." 
 
 " Do you think, then, that I have Lethe- 
 an properties about me, and that they will 
 extend their influence to you ?" 
 
 " Not much of that," said he, smiling 
 archly ; " still, you will be a dangerous 
 sister. I feel the consequence of such an 
 alliance already, for I came here with 
 simple respect for my mother's friend, and 
 I shall go away with admiring love for 
 Miss De Dunstanville herself."

 Dillon Moreland, with a most prepos- 
 sessing and fashionable figure, had a fine 
 animated countenance ; his understanding 
 was good, and far from uncultivated ; but 
 not having been intended for any of the 
 learned professions, his education was 
 simply genteel, and his knowledge gene- 
 ral, without being deep ; his heart was 
 kind, generous, compassionate, and sin- 
 cere ; attempered to the love of virtue, 
 but too much inclined to pleasure, to give 
 to that love the solidity of sacred princi- 
 ple ; his temper open and grateful, ar- 
 dent and impatient ; in principle he was 
 correct ; in intention upright ; but the

 JANE DE DUNSTANVILLE. 59 
 
 impetuosities of a warm aspiring mind, 
 uncontrolled by judgment, , unregulated 
 by experience, were apt to precipitate his 
 unpractised youth to the very verge of 
 error ; born with a high spirit deeply 
 tinctured with native pride, he forgot that 
 the distinctions of birth, and what is 
 more valuable, the pretensions of honest 
 worth, " having no lackey but pale 
 poverty, 19 are unnoticed, while obtrusive 
 ignorance and upstart wealth usurp their 
 privileges in an indiscriminating world. 
 
 Dillon Moreiand doted on style ; was de- 
 voted to fashion, and considered the glitter- 
 ins: meteors of the beau monde as the sum- 
 mumbonum of human felicity ; therefore, 
 though possessed of the properties and 
 capacities for 4 a most estimable character, 
 for want of perseverance and stability to 
 give it importance and decision, they who

 most loved him, feared false notions of life, 
 and what constituted happiness, with the 
 desire of enervating pleasures, would per- 
 vert his judgment, and obscure the bright^ 
 ness of his moral character, and plunge 
 him with all his warm, generous, kind, and 
 virtuous feelings, into a vortex of error 
 and disappointment. 
 
 Through the interest of a powerful 
 patron he had been, after some few mean- 
 derings in the paths of fortune and mis- 
 fortune, appointed private secretary to a 
 nobleman in one of the publick depart- 
 ments. Dillon now declared himself satis- 
 fied - 3 and his application to business, with 
 a quickness of apprehension, at once se- 
 cured him the confidence and regard of 
 his Lordship, and some deference for his 
 opinions ; meanwhile, his amiable man.

 for the female character, warmly recom- 
 mended him to the ladies of the family, 
 and Dillon at length moved in that bril- 
 liant sphere, so congenial to his feelings, 
 and to which his ambition had so ardently 
 aspired. 
 
 Dillon, as yet, had never been deficient 
 either in his relative or moral duties ; he 
 was a tender son, an affectionate brother, 
 and a kind friend ; still with his friends he 
 was very tenacious, with his sisters proudly 
 particular, and his mother he considered 
 abounding with superlatives ; as too good ; 
 too rigid; too forgiving. Dillon never 
 descended to know any one east of Tem- 
 ple-bar -, no, not even with his opera glass 
 could he recognise a single feature.

 him one day, in an accent of tender

 reproach, " you passed Mr. Forbes yester- 
 day without speaking." 
 
 " Positively, my dear mother," he re- 
 plied with the true Listless yawn, <c it is 
 quite fatiguing to speak to every body 
 one meets ; but I never pass a gentleman 
 if I know it." 
 
 " I thought one trait of a gentleman 
 was never to do what he need deny ; now 
 you would be ashamed to own you were 
 ungrateful, you would deny it." 
 
 "I would," said Dillon. 
 
 " Your father," calmly rejoined Mrs. 
 Moreland, " in a nocturnal frolic, once vio- 
 lated the peace \ and, being unknown, the 
 magistrate was committing him to prison, 
 for he was ashamed to own either his 
 name or rank ; this good man being pre- 
 sent, felt for his youth, and painful situa- 
 tion ; he paid, his damages, became his bail,

 attended him home in safety, and on many- 
 occasions after that period, was his friend, 
 always giving him a kind welcome to his 
 
 table; when General and Sir 
 
 horn his father had patron- 
 ised and supported, passed him, as you did 
 Mr. Forbes yesterday. Now tell me, my 
 dear boy, which deserved the distinction 
 of gentleman? God formed the heart 
 of the one ; the world formed that of the 
 other." 
 
 Now it was these kind of obsolete opi- 
 nions, and antediluvian sentiments, that 
 induced the prejudiced Dillon to call his 
 mother too good, too condescending, in 
 short, made up of too many superlatives. 
 
 " Your brother," said Mrs. Moreland, 
 when alone v/ith Alfred, " you seemed 
 mysterious about him ; where is he ?" 
 
 " Indeed, my dear mother, I know no

 more than that he is out of town. Lord 
 Danglecour is certainly not pleased ; but 
 then I hear his lady is, for he attended 
 her and her daughters to Bath. 
 
 " You terrify me," cried the mother* 
 " he will lose his patron, his friend ; he 
 will lose himself." 
 
 "Do not be so apprehensive, my dear- 
 est mother/'said Alfred, smiling," cut your 
 apron-strings, and let him take flight ; you 
 will always be sure to find him under a 
 female leader, and you know, time imme-* 
 morial, petticoat influence is powerful." 
 
 Mrs. Moreland was constrained to ap- 
 pear satisfied j but an indefined sigh arose 
 with the wish that her first-born darling 
 had been more moderate in the pursuit of 
 pleasure, and not the associate of charac- 
 ters in so elevated a condition, justly 
 fearing he would lose all taste for the.

 simple and innocent delights of a family- 
 fire side. 
 
 Lady Danglecour, the dashing wife of 
 the nobleman who employed him, always 
 called Dillon her " fair young knight," and 
 declared, half in jest, and half in earnest, 
 that he might love ; but she would take 
 care he should neither ride nor run away ; 
 and to say the truth, her ladyship was 
 better calculated for introducing youth to 
 the whole arcana of haut ton^ than in- 
 spiring a love for the calm, still scenes of 
 domestic life ; she delighted in notoriety, 
 yet had always cautiously kept within the 
 pale of decorum ; and though crim. con. 
 had received sanction by being declared 
 venial, so many of the plebeian herd had 
 figured in Doctors' Commons, that flirtation 
 was- almost beneath a woman of fashion j

 therefore did Lady Danglecour determine 
 to be chastely, nay, cruelly correct. 
 
 His Lordship's two daughters by a for- 
 mer marriage, were the perfect reverse of 
 each other ; Lady Matilda, the eldest, was 
 cold, haughty, imperious, and malignant ; 
 formed under her father, and a French 
 governess, she acknowledged no law but 
 her own will, nor knew a greater pleasure 
 than giving another pain ; her accomplish- 
 ments and manners were garish without 
 either the refinement or polish of fashion ; 
 and as for the natural affections, Lady Ma- 
 tilda had heard of them without ever 
 having been troubled with feeling them. 
 
 Lady Ellen had been reared in the warm 
 bosom of a maternal aunt, who be- 
 queathed her a genteel fortune ; -she had 
 a pretty pleasing figure, and a countenance 
 beaming with intelligence, sense, and can-

 dour ; and her manners, elegant and un- 
 affected, had that resistless sweetness which, 
 while it charmed the heart of man, never 
 excited one angry or malicious sensation in 
 woman ; her mind was strong, active, and 
 energetic ; her judgment correct, and her 
 temper calm and consistent j the feminine 
 virtues had chosen her bosom for their 
 residence, and the approbation of Lady- 
 Ellen Sterling was considered the criterion 
 of character. 
 
 To her father she was dutiful, and to 
 Lady Danglecour she paid the deference 
 due to her father's wife ; her heart glow- 
 ed with affection towards her sister, and 
 she mildly endeavoured to soften the 
 * asperity of her temper, and moderate 
 her stormy feelings, by the fair example of 
 her own conduct. Her Ladyship had dis- 
 carded several pretenders to her hand on

 most unfashionable principles ; indeed, the 
 bean raonde thought her opinions gothic 
 in the extreme ; she refused a peer, from 
 an apprehension, that some evening or 
 other she might mistake her coachman- 
 for him ; ridiculed a rich commoner, be- 
 cause he wore stays, false whiskers, and 
 calf-stuffed boots ; replied to a Lord List- 
 less of high ton, with a provokingly sin- 
 cere face, who told her he thought it a 
 
 d d bore to court, that she thought it 
 
 had been a bore courting, and to fill up the 
 measure of her tramontane eccentricities, 
 she actually dismissed a marquis, only be- 
 cause he preferred his neighbour's wife to 
 his own, and with a gaiete de cceur, quite 
 venial, while a broken-hearted father es- 
 corted her to the grave, he escorted the 
 other to the Lakes.

 Dillon Moreland had not been proof 
 against her blooming attractions ; but her 
 high rank and fortune operating on that 
 timidity, inseparable from genuine and 
 refined attachment, held him mute and 
 coldly reserved, while her ladyship, con- 
 scious of the cause, felt every pulse of her 
 innocent heart throb at his approach ; his 
 praise, his voice,~sounded like music on her 
 ear,and still her sensations were indefinable, 
 till his attendance on them at Bath had 
 subjected him to her father's reprehension ; 
 which was soon followed by a peremptory 
 command to return to the duties of his 
 office, or seek another protector. 
 
 It was then while poor Lady Ellen's 
 heart shrunk from the anguish of separa- 
 tion, that she felt that heart was no longer 
 in her own keeping, but had flown to the

 future hopes and felicity. 
 
 Lady Danglecour and Lady Matilda 
 
 had gone to the rooms ; a head-ache had 
 
 detained Lady Ellen at home, and Cupid, 
 
 who will sometimes administer balm for 
 
 the wounds he has made, so ordered it, 
 
 that an ache of some kind sent Dillon 
 
 Moreland home also ; therefore, they were 
 
 not only tete-d-tete, but that tete-a-tete was 
 
 rendered so interesting, th'atbefore mamma- 
 
 in-law returned, Lady Ellen and Dillon 
 
 could perfectly define their uncommon 
 
 heart-beatings, cheek-blushings, eye-glan- 
 
 cings, &c. but her ladyship still 
 
 wanted a year of being one and twenty, 
 
 and Dillon was younger still ; therefore, 
 
 with the impetuous fervor of a young 
 
 adoring heart, he would have implored 
 
 greater condescensions, /and hinted an

 elopement ; but she stopped him, and re- 
 pressing the' fondness of her own heart, 
 stood firm in rectitude and duty. 
 
 " I have a father,' * said her ladyship, 
 " and a greater father still gives him a

 Lady Danglecour returned in extreme 
 ill-humour, the wife of a Welch Baronet 
 had carried off her last hundred, and still 
 she was minus fifty guineas." 
 
 " Dillon, are you in cash ?" she cried, 
 throwing herself on the sofa, and extend- 
 ing a beautiful hand to the youth ; " if 
 you are, be my banker till my surly crab 
 can be made to open his claws." 
 
 " My regret is extreme," replied poor 
 Dillon, colouring " but my purse will barely 
 take me to London." 
 
 " London !-" repeated the countess,

 commands to return instantly."

 was now superadded a cold embittered 
 smile, he replied to the artless effusions of 
 her guileless heart, " that he must be ex-

 Dillon Moreland, it must be confessed, 
 experenced some degree of trepidation, 
 as Lord Danglecour's knocker vibrated in 
 his hand ; and there was an air of some- 
 hing blended with the look of welcome 
 the porter gave, which he could not un- 
 derstand. 
 
 On entering the range of offices, he 
 beheld a stranger seated at his table ; he 
 arose on his entrance, and with rather a 
 supercilious civility begged him to be 
 seated. 
 
 " Is his Lordship not yet visible ?" said 
 Dillon.

 domestic in the family ; they now crowded 
 around him with respectful wishes, and 
 while he was bestowing a remembrance 
 of their many attentions, his brother 
 Alfred was admitted. 
 
 He took his arm, and silently quitted 
 the hall. " I rejoice, my dear brother, to

 the fire. 
 
 Again too busy thoughts obtruded, and 
 reflection held a mirror in which his men- 
 tal eye contrasted the last time he had 
 been there with the present ; he had then 
 been high in favour with his patron ; 
 basking in the illusive beam of shining 
 promise : Lady Danglecour had his arm, 
 and was distinguishing her fair knight 
 with those familiar whispers, which denote 
 being well with the great ; and still more 
 ecstatic, he caught the love inspiring, the 
 love-bestowing glance of the adored Ellen j 
 he was then courted by rank, followed 
 by fashion, known in the world of ton ; 
 in short, poor Dillon had then been what 
 he wished to be.

 cast off by him, whose favour he hoped 
 would have raised him a fabric of great- 
 ness; abandoned by her, who with the 
 voice of pleasure had first lured him from 
 the duties of his condition ; and feeling 
 himself sunk beneath the fair excellence, 
 whose preference he had considered the 
 guiding star of his existence, Dillon 
 Moreland thought he could endure no 
 more. 
 
 His melancholy reverie was disturbed by 
 the approach of a group, among whom 
 were Lord Clancarron and Sir Felix Frib- 
 ble, they had often surveyed Dillon's fine 
 graceful figure with malicious envy ; often 
 viewed the smiling welcome he received 
 from the soft eye of Lady Ellen with jealous 
 malignity, and as Lord Danglecour had 
 certainly lost immense sums to the ho- 
 nourable baronet, even he declared her

 ladyship's hand should be an unqualified 
 quittance for the whole ; therefore, the 
 first preliminary step towards the accom- 
 plishment of the treaty, was young More- 
 land's dismission and disgrace. 
 
 A stranger to these secret complottings, 
 and ignorant that his degradation was 
 known, as they drew near, lie started 
 up, and pride repressing the anguish of 
 feeling, with his usual ease he addressed 
 them. 
 
 " How are you, Clan ? Fribble, how 
 does Booth look ? I am so jaded tra- 
 velling, — ca'nt go in positively ; — up all

 down, yet still Dillon Moreland was unre- 
 cognized

 faint, were any but fellows of fashion about

 " Perdition strike you speechless, you 
 vile, vaunting, pitiful degradation to the

 Dillon grasped the feeble Fribble by the 
 collar, " dare again to profane that name 
 with your pestiferous breath, and I will 
 shiver you, you poor, quaking, aguish, 
 hump of deformity, to atoms !" 
 
 Sir Felix lay gasping with terror on the 
 sofa, and Dillon turning to Lord Clancar- 
 ron, with a look he thought it wise to 
 understand; repeated, 
 
 " Does your lordship please to remember 
 me?"

 did retreat, " Aye that I do, and curse 
 me if ever I shall forget you either." 
 
 " There we differ/' said Dillon, haugh- 
 tily, " for I shall forget I ever knew 
 you." 
 
 " Tant mieux pour moi" said the peer's 
 heart, but his tongue uttered nothing.

 friend, " Come, bang-up, who's afraid ?

 His lordship ceased, started aside, nay, 
 as historians ought to be correct, it was 
 said he turned pale, for Dillon Moreland 
 had returned, and as the witty peer was 
 proceeding with his gigantic comparison, 
 the youth's eye, calmly severe, fell full on 
 him.

 Dillon now walked proudly away, leav- 
 ing the spectators of the scene in bursts of 
 laughter ; some pitying, and some de- 
 spising the cowardice of the baronet and 
 his noble friend ; while all felt a sentiment 
 of respect for the courage of Dillon. 
 
 In full expectation of hearing from Sir 
 Felix, he remained the whole of next clay 
 in the hotel he had written on his card ; 
 but he need not have wasted the time ; 
 his courage was in no danger of a trial ; 
 for as the honourable baronet had but a 
 very moderate quantity of brains, he con- 
 sidered it would be very improvident to 
 hazard their diminution by a pistol bullet, 
 therefore, prudently determined to follow 
 the wise counsel offered by an old Scottish 
 motto,—" Dinna Wftken sleepings doags"

 refined art, aided by an apparent indiffe- 
 rence, said that she understood hehadan at-

 was believed would forget he was poor, 
 and invest him with her whole fortune. 
 
 Jane on these occasions certainly felt a 
 pang, and sometimes even the remem-

 she had received of his contempt for 
 wealth were insufficient to quiet her appre- 
 hensions of the possibility that he might 
 change. " Eut if he can change, better

 now resolutely declared she would take 
 no steps to develope her mystery, till 
 ascertained of his continued love and fide- 
 lity. Her attachment for Mrs. Moreland 
 increased daily ; nor did she ever experi- 
 ence the languor of a moment in her 
 endearing society ; this preference filled 
 the bpsoms of the whole Clancarron family 
 with disgust, abhorrence, and a malignity 
 not unblended with a secret desire of 
 revenge, for her having obtained an influ- 
 ence, which if their's, would have contri- 
 buted so largely to their interested pur- 
 poses. 
 
 Alfred devoted every hour he could 
 spare from his duties and studies to his 
 mother, and beautiful sister Jane, as he 
 was allowed to call her, and could Mrs.

 excursion to Windsor, wljen the carriage

 spectability which application to business 
 would secure ; he does not act so much 
 from bad principles, as from having no 
 principle at all, therefore, he errs more 
 from affecting the vices, of his superiors, 
 than from having any vicious impulse of 
 his own. He has been known to restore 
 a worthy husband to his suffering wife 
 and children, deserve gratitude, and have 
 a blessing ; and yet when that wife was a „ 
 widow, and her child about to be esta- 
 blished, he could unprovokedly abuse an 
 influence he boasted with Lord Falcon, to 
 counteract his intentions and impede 
 his bounty \ to finish with him, he can

 " Undauntedly he pursued his brilliant 
 path through the great waters, and rose 
 triumphant over the foes of Britain; in 
 time the conquerors badge glittered on 
 his breast, he was created a peer, and sat 
 super-eminent in that court, appointed 
 to direct the wooden walls of England in 
 their devious track. 
 
 " Of family, we need only mention two 
 sons ; his eldest was upright, honourable, 
 just, and judiciously beneficent ; the other 
 with every generous virtue glowing in 
 his breast, was yet rash, inconsiderate, 
 and impetuous, and in a nocturnal frolic 
 with some other young men of condition, 
 unfortunately a person lost his life.

 to abscond, and destiny directed the 
 younger Falcon to the shores of the Car- 
 natic ; there, friendless and unknown, 
 without introduction or money, he had 
 to endure the bitter and galling indigni- 
 ties atted ant on want and imprisonment ; 
 an officer, a general officer, whose name 
 and character will be dear and sacred to 
 the soldier so long as honour inspires 
 the soldier's breast, heard by accident, 
 that the son of a British nobleman, who had 
 greatly served his country, was imprisoned. 
 His intentions needed no introduction ; 
 and there was a frankness in his manner, 
 superior to ceremony ; he appeared be- 
 fore the dejected youth, and with every 
 generous feeling stirring within him, he 
 took his passive hand,

 gentleman/ said the colonel, c and I

 " What followed, imagination may sup*

 and the colonel has often been heard to 
 say, he felt a prouder, richer, enjoyment 
 in that one deed, than when his arms 
 had carried conquest ' at the head of 
 armies. 
 
 " At length, all was happily arranged,, 
 and young Falcon was to return to his 
 father and his country, and take a last 
 leave of his generous friend and pre- 
 server. 
 
 " * My benefactor ! my friend!' said the 
 grateful youth, ' what can I ever do ;

 " The colonel paused, and his eye fell on 
 a little sun-burnt fondling rolling at his 
 feet.

 mother; take him with you, draw for 
 his expences, and when you look at him, 
 think his father loved you.' 
 
 " The boy was educated liberally for the 
 profession of arms ; he was the delight 
 of the old lord, he was the pride and 
 pleasure of his son; but both went tc* 
 their everlasting recompense, and the 
 young Indian became the noble represen- 
 tative's care. The upright excellent being, 
 the very son of his father,, was exemplary 
 in all the social and moral duties ; and, 
 through a series of unhappy fortunes, to 
 this youth was patron, friend, and pa-

 rent ; but too devoted to pleasure, he met 
 the man of pleasure's doom; his own fa- 
 ther had fallen a victim to one of Tippoo's 
 emissaries. Lord Falcon was his only- 
 friend, but he died, a foreign grave re- 
 ceived him ; and he left a young wife too 
 highly born and bred for the common 
 exertions of life, and a family of helpless 
 infants. 
 
 " The widow flew to his lordship, * he is 
 dead!' she wildly cried, ' my children 
 they will perish.' 
 
 " c No ! no !' said the generous feeling 
 being, ' No, I will never forsake you, 
 the annuity is your's, your own ; depend 
 on me, and this boy ; taking up the young-

 " That was the widow's last interview 
 with his lordship ; not long after it he 
 himself died, leaving to posterity the 
 bright example of a husband, father, and 
 friend, all united in the upright man, 
 
 " How the widow mourned him, per- 
 haps he himself now knows ; but it is 
 known and registered by him who witness-

 not why ; for Lord Falcon had often de- 
 scribed his son as scarcely to be equalled, 
 as almost exempt from the infirmities of 
 his kind; he believed him moderate, tem- 
 perate, just, generous, good. Alas! alas]

 limbs, and faultering lips, she met him. 
 
 " The old man gazed on her — he could 
 not speak —ryet his silence told enough.

 he at length, ' my late lord has not left

 succeeded to evil, and the wound has 
 never closed ; uncomplaining she suffered, 
 and never obtruded on lord Falcon's joy-

 despair, when fate seemed pouring its vial 
 of wrath on her devoted head ; the young-

 mised to protect, wished to be established,

 Could his brave and honourable fathers

 ble spirits start ? They left him rich in 
 every human distinction; rich in the 
 power of doing good ; but he has hushed 
 the voice of glowing gratitude ; sealed

 aged mother's cheek ; the blush of shame 
 rises in the face of an innocent offspring ;

 CHAPTER X. 
 
 The gay world had really allowed Jane to 
 be one whole morning rational, and she 
 was still with her friend in the library 
 among books and crayons, when a foot- 
 man's rap, with resounding violence, 
 made the mansion feel a somebody ap- 
 proached. 
 
 It was Lady Florence Clancarron ; an 
 early visit from her always boded ill to 
 some character or feeling, for to the gentle 
 charities of human nature her soul was 
 a stranger. — The purity and candour of 
 Jane's own mind denied her any suffrage \ 
 but the ties of kindred giving her some 
 claim to attention, the usages of polite

 society granted her tolerance, and she 
 was apparently on intimate terms with her 
 cousin. 
 
 The impatient sparkle of her ladyship's 
 eye indicated something ; she had just 
 left Sir Felix Fribble, and felt absolutely suf- 
 focating with her intelligence : 
 
 " I have heard," said she, " indeed now 
 I know such a thing, that it will make 
 your hair stand on end." 
 
 " Do not let me hear it then," said 
 Jane, smiling, " for as I have just been 
 made a crop, I shall look like the fretful 
 porcupine." 
 
 " Oh! you tame, still, incurious thing ; 
 but you must hear this, because what I 
 do not know about it I think you can tell 
 me." 
 
 Jane was silent. 
 
 " Positively then," continued she, with

 malign volubility, " I have found out the 
 mother of the little child Lady Benvolia 
 is so fond of!" 
 
 " Wonderful !" said Jane, yet she felt 
 rather disconcerted. c • Was it confided to 
 you in secrecy ?" added she, after a pause. 
 
 " As a very great secret,'* repeated her 
 ladyship, " and I tell it you only because 
 I know you can tell me a great deal 
 more." 
 
 Jane felt recovering. 
 
 U Poor Lady Florence !* laughing — " so 
 your tale tells me, you can tell nothing, 
 and therefore expect I should tell you 
 something; a proper gossip's embassy, upon 
 my honour !"

 her ladyship, provoked by her calmness ;

 Benvolia says of your friend now, that

 softly on her lips, " whatever that lady says 5

 prejudice, anger, or misapprehension, have 
 led her to say what / do not deserve, as 
 you heard it, and your professed regard rec- 
 tified it, and, consequently, it will be no 
 more repeated." 
 
 Lady Florence felt the keenness of the 
 rebuke, and for a moment shrunk abashed; 
 but the pride of imagined superiority, 
 and the fever of resentful passion gained 
 the ascendant over momentary confusion, 
 and she returned to the charge. 
 
 " Well, well/' she cried, looking proudly 
 down on her gentle reprover, " you are

 turn the other to be smitten too ; such 1 
 humility may certainly become- the in- 
 ferior conditions j but thank my kind 
 stars, they elevate me above such pitiful 
 tameness ; I ha\^ been offended, and will

 Mrs. Moreland ever shrunk from the 
 rudeness of altercation, and her spirits 
 being now unequal to the retort of un- 
 kindness, she took advantage of her 
 daughter's bell ringing, and rising politely, 
 wished her ladyship good morning. 
 
 Her forbearing meekness, her dignified 
 repulse of scandal, and her calm retreat, 
 were neither calculated to quiet the angry 
 passions, nor satisfy the craving curiosity of 
 this detractive demon ; for she was among 
 those wha consider detracting from the 
 merits of others, in some measure supplied

 the deficiences in herself, and as has been 
 observed, she was never so gratified as 
 when depreciating those virtuous charac- 
 ters, whose excellence she would neither 
 emulate nor imitate. 
 
 " Mrs. Moreland's affected ignorance 
 springs from her great meekness of tem- 
 per, and goodness of heart - 9 " said her 
 ladyship, as the door closed, " for well 
 I know there is something that shuns the 
 light, something very mysterious too > 
 and strange ; and you know it, cousin." 
 
 " No doubt there is, Lady Florence," 
 said Jane quietly. 
 
 " You will not understand me ; but * 
 mean about Lady Berivolia, and Antigrina, 
 and the child." 
 
 " I mean the same, Lady Florence."

 her ladyship, malice giving its darkening

 Mrs. Moreland had informed you all about

 " I cannot deny it," replied Jane, " but — '* 
 lc Oh, no ! but in mercy !" interrupted 
 she eagerly, "I am dying to hear it mi- 
 nutely, and swear to be silent as— as — " 
 
 She wanted a simile, " As I have been," 
 added Jane, " when I tell you." 
 
 " Yes, as you ' yourself," repeated she, 
 unobservant of her pointed meaning, in 
 her anxiety to hear — " Oh ! I shall dote on 
 it, devour it, for I so hate that Lady Ben- 
 volia." 
 
 " I do not know," resumed Jane, with 
 perfect composure, " how far I am justified 
 in a disclosure ; it reveals what Lady Ben- 
 volia has always wished to hide, and here- 
 after may distress the sweet child herself."

 a look of calm contempt to her disappoint-

 as to suppose, because her motives had been 
 ill understood, her feelings unappreciated, 
 and the glowing affections of her grateful 
 heart unreturned, that she would betray 
 confidence, or give sanction to scandal 
 uttered by lips that should only open to 
 bless the countess's beneficence ? And you, 
 Lady Florence, accept a counsel the candour 
 of friendship offers ; repress your propen- 
 sity of detraction ; a good heart will 
 neither justify, nor adopt the errors of 
 others, but it will feel a secret delight 
 in concealing them ; why should w r e be 
 anxious to drag all imperfection from its 
 dark abode? the amount of their mis- 
 deeds will not swell the catalogue of our 
 virtues, nor will their being sinners make 
 us saints ; believe me, the noble mind is ne- 
 ver severe; human infirmities have its 
 commiseration, but never exposure, for real

 virtue, needs no borrowed glare to display 
 her beauty." 
 
 The voice of Jane was tempered by 
 kindness, and sweetened by innate benevo- 
 lence as she spoke -> yet with difficulty 
 could her ladyship repress her violence 
 from breaking forth, and only the timely 
 recollection, how necessary Jane's purse 
 was to many of her gratifications, could 
 have restrained her ; but she arose with 
 rancour and disappointment boiling within, 
 execrating the superiority of her cousin, 
 and also the virtue that had prevented 
 her going direct to Lady Benvolia with 
 a sting in every insinuated hint of her 
 intelligence. 
 
 Jane's gentle spirits were rather irritated 
 by the occurrence; but the entrance of Mrs. 
 Moreland and Alfred, who came loaded 
 with new music, soon harmonised her, and

 in the sweet variations of the Irish melo- 
 dies, Lady Florence's malevolence was for- 
 gotten.

 Alfred, " < The Botie Rows'— it will suit

 " You flatterer ! you shall be deafened

 " Are you as perfect an adept in the 
 art as your brother ?' enquired Lady Flo- 
 rence, a malignant smile curling her lip ; 
 " but I hear, indeed, you are tolerably pro- 
 digal in dealing out your praises." 
 
 " Miss De Dunstanville," replied the 
 youth, with a glance that might have fro- 
 zen her, " can only hear truth, when she 
 hears praises ; she only is unconscious of 
 her own excellence.'' 
 
 " Positively, Lord Clancarron must 
 take some lessons," cried her ladyship.

 " Dillon Moreland, Oh ! yes, I did

 " Did fcnoxv him ?" repeated Jane, and 
 her cheek flushed. 
 
 " That is, I sometimes saw him while 
 he was with Lord Danglecour.'' 
 
 Lady Florence had- now darted lier 
 sting, and beheld its withering effect ; but 
 with apparent ignorance of the mischief, 
 and affected good humour, she cried,

 farther, except that he sent now and 
 then, supposing, what was very improba-

 might accept his proud defiance. This 
 circumstance, as it gave evidence of the 
 fiery particles which composed Dillon's 
 nature, Alfred cautiously suppressed, and 
 poor Mrs. Moreland might have exclaimed, 
 
 " Flow pitiable is that condition where 
 ignorance is bliss f 
 
 But maternal love and solicitude could' 
 not be longer restrained; apprehensions 
 the most fearful shook her reason and 
 tortured lier heart ; and to obtain all the

 she resolved to wait on Lord Danglecour; 
 and next morning Miss De Dunstanville's 
 carriage put her down at his lordship's 
 mansion.

 gained her immediate admission, and 
 though much disappointed at finding both 
 Lord and Lady Danglecour were gone 
 out, on hearing one of the young ladies 
 was at home and visible, she was intro- 
 duced to Lady Matilda Sterling. 
 
 There was a modest dignity in Mrs. 
 Moreland's manner, which inspired invo- 
 luntary respect in every bosom capable of 
 feeling ; but the heart of the haughty 
 one in whose presence she now stood, 
 never knew the softening influence of one 
 generous or gentle impression. 
 
 A most repeliant bending of the head, 
 and a cold motion to a distant sofa, made 
 up her reception. 
 
 " I obtrude, madam," said Mrs. More- 
 and, and her tremulous tones betrayed 
 internal agitation : " Dillon Moreland's 
 mother ventures to obtrude on your lady-

 ship, in the hope you may commisserate 
 maternal anxiety, and say all you know 
 of the young man, who has been so un- 
 fortune as to offend Lord Danglecour." 
 
 Lady Matilda now experienced a malig- 
 nant delight ; she could take revenge for 
 Dillon's preference of her sister ; she could 
 assert a bold superiority over the trembling 
 being before her; and she could wring the 
 detested sister's heart, by traducing a repu- 
 tation she would liave perished to pre- 
 serve. 
 
 " The truths I am importuned to utter, 
 will sound ungracious to a mother's ear." 
 
 " Speak, madam, I can bear, I am pre- 
 pared ; and will bear " and the mo- 
 ther grasped the sofa as if it could have 
 strengthened her weakness. " Yes, I will 
 bear every thing my child inflicts."

 gance," resumed her ladyship, coldly com- 
 posed in her cruelty, " Lord Danglecour, 
 in compassion to his youth and helpless 
 circumstances, often forgave ; but when 
 he basely attempted to seduce the daugh- 
 ter from her duty, who, forgetful of her 
 own dignity, listened to one so much 
 beneath her, when he made a ruffian 
 attack on the life of him, a father had 
 selected for her protector, it converted his 
 lenity into the sternest resentment and 
 contempt, and he dismissed him.'* 
 
 " Dillon Moreland a seducer ! a ruf- 
 fian ! merciful God !" exclaimed the mo- 
 ther, all the early virtues and generosities 
 of her child's nature rushing over me- 
 mory, and sustaining her shrinking spi- 
 rit. " Where, where is he, madam ? Say,

 The very worm when trodden on will" 
 turn ; the pride of insulted dignity ele- 
 vated Mrs. Moreland above a merciless 
 being's efforts to crush her, and as remem- 
 brance brought the noble blood of many 
 a generation into her faded cheek, she 
 replied, rising, " Dillon Moreland, madam 9 
 is descended from a race of ancestors, 
 whose ennobling virtues raised a sphere of 
 honour around them, which extends to 
 the latest, and remotest line of their pos- 
 terity ; and though the inconsiderateness

 blighting malevolence can extinguish the 
 original spark derived from heaven, and a 
 family of honour which burns in my

 Abashed by the calm severity of so 
 unexpected a retort, and awed into insig- 
 nificance by a superiority no rank could 
 confer, she felt, to 'use the jargon of the 
 day, struck speechless ; and during that 
 moment, proudlycurtseying, without deign- 
 ing one word, the insulted ' mother 
 quitted the imperious presence of one, 
 who had betrayed too much rancour to 
 carry an air of truth in her accusations. 
 
 The sudden flash of spirit which had 
 sustained the mother, was fast yielding to 
 maternal apprehension, and anxious to 
 reach the carriage without betraying her 
 emotion, she was hastening through the 
 hall, with her eyes fixed on the ground,

 when a female encountered her. She 
 looked up, and bowing, would have 
 passedon, but the lady stopped, and gazing 
 in her face she spoke. 
 
 " Surely, Mr, Moreland's mother;" said 
 she, taking her hand with that charming 
 frankness which ever distinguished Lady 
 Ellen Sterling, " I see his every fea- 
 ture ;" and a glow of pleasure enriched 
 her cheek : " I have much to ask." 
 
 " I am his mother," answered Mrs. 
 Moreland, pensively, while irresistibly im- 
 pelled, she pressed the hand that held her 
 own, and followed her lovely conductress 
 into a saloon, where, when seated, all the

 so f said the generous girl, a soft energy 
 giving n^v charms to every glowing fea- 
 ture, " consider, dear Mrs. Moreland, con-

 allow me to justify the heart whose feel-

 gave me preference, I accepted the pre- 
 ference, and that is his offence in the eyes 
 of my family."

 A confidential and explicit explanation 
 followed, and the generous Ellen's affec- 
 tionate assurances proved a softening 
 balm to the wounds an envious sister's 
 envenomed tongue had inflicted on mater- 
 nal feelings ; and such is the power of rec- 
 titude in a well-regulated mind, that 
 though still ignorant how, or where the 
 beloved Dillon was, the mother, from 
 having heard his character justified, felt 
 comparatively easy. 
 
 On her arrival at home, she was nearly 
 transported by having a letter put into 
 her hands from Dillon himself, dated from 
 Glamorganshire ; it was penned with 
 the fervor of filial affection and duty, 
 and contained a candid detail of his con- 
 duct, and. dismission from Lord Dangle- 
 cour's, and also confessed his attachment 
 to the elegant Ellen, whom, with the

 glowing pencil of a lover's vivid imagina- 
 tion, he described what she really was, 
 the first, the gentlest, and most unerring 
 of her kind ; he assured his mother he 
 was proud and happy in her approbation, 
 and on his return to town, hoped to be- 
 hold the two beings dearest to him on 
 earth appreciated by each other, As to 
 his circumstances and condition he was 
 entirely silent, but as he wrote in high 
 spirits the mother was calm, and with the 
 piety of her resigned nature, confided 
 him and his fate to the care of a regula- 
 ting God. 
 
 More satisfied than she had been since 
 her arrival in town, without any hesita- 
 tion she had consented to accompany Miss 
 De Dunstanville to a very brilliant dinner 
 party at Clancarron-house; but, on re-con- 
 sideration, she begged her to take apolo*

 gies, promising to join her at the concert, 
 which was to follow in the evening, as 
 she wished to have some private conver- 
 sation with Alfred, and answer Dillon's 
 letter by return of post ; an early repast 
 was, therefore, ordered, and the interme- 
 diate hours between it and dressing were 
 devoted to the pen. 
 
 Jane De Dunstanville possessed a benig- 
 nancy of soul which ever led her to re- 
 joice with the happy, and to mourn with 
 the miserable ; she could taste of every 
 one's cup, still enriching her own nature 
 by that pity, which droppeth as the gentle 
 dew from heaven on human misery, 
 and brightening by participating the plea- 
 sure which angels take in human felicity. 
 Her attachment fo Mrs, Moreland was 
 ardent and sincere ; and her mind, capable 
 of all the nicer touches of refined senti-

 ment, rejoiced in her joy; and with every 
 gentle feeling attuned to harmony, she 
 dressed for Lady Clancarron's splendid 
 dinner party. 
 
 Jane's beauty now shone in fulf resplen- 
 dency, and her ssjour, short as it had been 
 in the circles of fashion, had comniuni- 
 nicated to the elegant simplicity of her 
 manners all the polish of high life, with- 
 out having imbibed its caprices and fol- 
 lies* 
 
 Attired for this splendid fete, and glit- 
 tering in diamonds, whose brilliancy could 
 only be surpassed by the sweet lustre of 
 an eye beaming with the graces of an 
 intelligent and beneficent mind, with a 
 light foot she was descending the grand 
 stair-case to her waiting carnage, when a

 visitor, who said he could not wait, but 
 must be admitted, desired to see Miss 
 De Dunstanville instantly ; " he has almost 
 forced himself into one of the waiting 
 rooms," added he, " and looks both strange 
 and resolute. 5 ' 
 
 A refusal of whatever nature never 
 passed Jane's lips without giving pain to 
 her heart ; denial at the gates of De Dun- 
 stanville was never known ? and fashion, 
 potent as it was had not taught her the 
 ungracious habit; still she paused here, 
 and discretion interposing, induced her to 
 demand the visitor's name. A footman 
 flew to enquire.

 the matter, and in less than a minute,

 As he has presented himself unannounc-

 The stranger had been a man of many 
 sorrows, and early acquainted with grief, 
 his morning of life had arose '~;vh the 
 fairest promises of a brilliant day^ but 
 long ere it reached the meridian, it had 
 set in the depths of a dreary and dreadful 
 night. He was born with passions high* 
 strong, and uncontrollable ; but one had 
 supereminency :n his soul, and that one 
 warmed every nerve to more than com- 
 mon rapture, heightened every impulse, 
 and imparted a more than human energy 
 to every exertion. 
 
 He had loved ; and he might have said

 ** The course of true love never did run 
 smooth,'' 9 
 
 The sentiment which this loved crea- 
 ture had inspired, became the governing 
 principle of his existence ; for the empire 
 of her power extended beyond the senses \ 
 it mingled with the elements of his beinsr, 
 and incorporated with the innatest feelings 
 of his soul ; but he lost her ; she was 
 lost ; and when he did lose her the at- 
 tractive chord of being cracked, and all 
 his afb& life became a gloomy chaos •> 
 the mental fires which brighten into ac- 
 tion were nearly extinguished, energy was 
 deadened, and exertion over. 
 
 This stranger had felt the maniac's 
 pangs, he had felt the prisoner's woes, he 
 had felt the beggar's bitter wants ; he had 
 felt, he had sustained them all ; yet all, 
 except one, were despised and forgotten.

 Slow lingering years had elapsed, of 
 which poor mangled memory retained but 
 faint and imperfect traces, for he had re- 
 covered from the ragings of fevered de- 
 lirium, from the wasting gloom of men- 
 tal melancholy, and also from the ener- 
 vating pillow of lingering sickness ; it 
 was then that he looked around, and 
 found all to him a dreary vacuity ; he was 
 a darkened blank, a cold clod, in the 
 great book of animated nature ; he was a 
 stranger, unknown, unconnected, unen- 
 deared, unacknowledged, in the peo- 
 pled world ; he interested no heart, no 
 one interested his ; yet still as reason 
 strengthened, as the intellectual spark 
 emerged from the gloomy impression of 
 a mental night, the imperishable princi- 
 ple of life with a strong, though still voice,

 pleaded for preservation, and called for 
 effort. 
 
 The fevered, and long- perturbed pulses 
 of high impetuous hope were now com- 
 posed ; the stormy wishes that had raged 
 to agony were sunk, and those tumultu- 
 ous conflicts which had caused such bat- 
 tles of the brain were now no more, or 
 as if they had never been ; the powers and 
 properties of the human mind, when 
 free and unobscured, are of great ex- 
 tent, and it is only the vacant, or the vi- 
 cious, soul that can remain inactive, and a 
 burden to itself; and no sooner was 
 this stranger unapprehensive of worldly 
 fluctuations in his own particular fate, than 
 collecting himself within himself, he be- 
 came a wandering observer of a world, 
 in which he lived unendearing, and unen« 
 deared.

 m life he had slightly known Sir 
 De Dunstanville, and when those 
 Imp ircuir. stances which had go- 
 
 verned his destiny allowed freedom of 
 action, he travelled on foot to the abbey. 
 Sir Geoffry's death left the motives of his 
 visit unexplained and undisclosed ^ he was 
 of the order of poverty, cold biting and 
 severe poverty, and, in rumination sad, 
 he had wandered to Sir GeofFry's tomb; and, 
 if the draimstance be not forgotten, the 
 reader will recollect, that one morning 
 Jane and her friend encountered a poor 
 benumbed being in the mansions of her 
 departed ancestors, and it may also be re- 
 membered* she gave a promise of future 
 assistance, should it ever be needed or re- 
 quired, and it was this very stranger, who 
 now boldly and mysteriously demanded 
 an immediate interview.

 In his form he was tall and command- 
 ing, his manner dignified, and his counte- 
 nance, though pale, penetrating and im- 
 pressive ; his eye, full, large, and dark, 
 seemed to have lost much of its former 
 fire, yet at times it emitted a spark, which 
 with electric power entered the heart, and 
 struck on every sense. 
 
 Jane gazed upon him with a sensation 
 new and indescribable ; she felt awed, 
 and wished herself away, yet, as if spell- 
 bound, could not move. 
 
 " Your business, Sir," said she ; " I am 
 rather confined as to time, indeed, indis- 
 pensably engaged." 
 
 "Go, then !" cried he with abruptness, 
 "go." 
 
 She started ; " Do not be offended, but 
 allow me first to know if I have power 
 in any way to oblige you,"

 deep and solemn. cc Have you no recol-

 mise given, of a promise accepted ; think 
 well 5 ' I claim that promise now, -even

 Jane shrunk appalled from the gleam of 
 his piercing eye. " I think — indeed, Sir, 
 
 I think. 1 " She shook, and her 
 
 voice grew tremulous. 
 
 " Be not affrighted," resumed he, his 
 own voice attempered to the softest feel- 
 ings ; " my violence has alarmed your 
 gentleness, yet I would not harm you, oh ! 
 not for the felicities of Paradise." 
 
 Jane felt easier ! his milder manner re- 
 assured her, and she could speak.

 look," said she, some indistinct feeling

 throbbing at her heart, as she encoun- 
 tered his ardent gaze ; " I think we met 
 not long ago among the tombs of my 
 ancestors ; you were then unwell, Sir, let 
 me hope you are better, and say what 
 you wish ; your appearance is my secu- 
 rity that it will not be improper/'

 which made the circling blood rush in 
 burning tides to her heart. 
 
 " Have you considered ? have you de- 
 cided ?" 
 
 "Be more explicit, I intreat/' replied 
 Jane, feeling an increasing emotion 'which 
 almost could deny nothing. 
 
 " If you comply," cried he, clasping 
 his hands with fervour, while a smile, 
 powerful as the lightning's blaze, irrad'a.ed 
 his pale features ; "if you do comply, what 
 
 may it not accomplish for — for me ! 
 
 If you hesitate, and this hour makes con- 
 sequences irreversible and eternal, if you 
 do not comply ! Aye ! Miss De Dunstan- 
 ville, if you do not, even you will one 
 day rue it, in bitterness of spirit rue it."

 she spoke.

 Jane had not calculated the exact value 
 of money, she knew not its mighty 
 mischief, its mighty powers, but if it had 
 been her idol, she had given it in that 
 moment, for Hildebrande Fitz Ormond's 
 image, and all the circumstances connected 
 with their mutual fate, so blended in her 
 mind while the stranger spoke, that she 
 could not separate his idea from the mys- 
 tery of the stranger's - appearance. But 
 when abjured by what was most sacred 
 and dear, and precious, in a confused whirl 
 of complicated feeling, while every sus- 
 picion slumbered, every fear shut out, 
 and only love was waking in her guileless 
 bosom, the stranger's ready-prepared pa- 
 per received her signature.

 ville," but the moment was lost j the 
 deed done, and she could not retract, 
 even had she wished it. 
 
 The paper still shook in the stranger's 
 unsteady hand ; he fixed a stern and still 
 look on her face* and paused — 
 
 " The pure spirit shining through that 
 eye could not do it ;" said he, replying to 
 some imagining of his own — "no* could 
 not!" His manner was now benignly calm; 
 no sudden start of exulting thought ap- 
 peared, and yet a smile of corrected plea- 
 sure, of ineffable and serene delight, gave 
 a momentary glow to his faded cheek, 
 and a mild saint- like radiance to his eye. 
 He kneeled and took her hand ; she 
 attempted to withdraw it, but he per- 
 severed, and gently pressed it within his 
 own.

 promised to descend from the altitude of 
 his barouche box, leave whipism in the 
 rear, and 5 if possible, for one whole fash-

 communicated a richer colouring to her 
 cheek, and a brighter sparkle to her eye,

 of whom had never seen her before.

 nry and taste vied for pre-eminence, and 
 as it was avowedly given in honour of 
 Jane^ her heart willingly accorded the tri- 
 bute of gratitude, and in the smiling sa-

 Clancarron drew near, saying, " Mrs. Har- 
 mony, Colonel and Lieutenant-governor 
 Harmony's widow, would be happy in 
 the honor of her acquaintance." 
 
 Jane received her with much politeness, 
 and entered into conversation, when a 
 crowd of company entering, both ladies 
 threw their eyes towards them ; but Jane's 
 attention was soon recalled to Mrs. Harmo- 
 ny, who grew suddenly pale, and appeared 
 ready to faint. 
 
 " You are ill, madam," said Jane, " I will 
 ring." 
 
 " It will soon go off, my dear Miss De- 
 Dunstanville," replied she, and her voice 
 had a peculiar something in it that pleas- 
 ed, while it interested a stranger; " you are 
 so kind, so attentive, you put me in mind 
 of the great Miss Barrendon of Bath."

 " Who !" interrupted Jane's former ap- 
 prover, with an ironical look. 
 
 " The great banker's daughter, Sir ; she 
 had ninety thousand pounds to her fortune* 
 and married the great Mr. Pownal. 
 
 " Humph !" said he, loud enough to 
 be heard ; " Mrs. Harmony," he added, " I 
 protest your old friend Mrs. Moreland is 
 just come in, and speaking to Lady Clan- 
 carron ; look, do you see her ?" 
 
 Mrs. Harmony had a quick eye, and had 
 seen her ; and it was her entrance that had 
 given the deathly paleness to her cheek, 
 which Jane attributed to sudden indispo- 
 sition. Every thing that concerned Mrs. 
 Moreland, however remotely, interested 
 the heart of Jane, and her looks, in which 
 her heart ever shone, betraying a wish for 
 an explanation. Lady Denham was ready 
 to give it ; and as Mrs. Harmony, feeling

 her seat rather uneasy, made an opportu- 
 nity to join another party, but took care 
 to be in hearing of what might pass on 
 this terrifying subject. 
 
 Lady Denham and Mrs. Harmony had 
 been, till very lately , friends ; that is, they 
 visited at the same houses, played at the 
 same whist tables, and circulated the same 
 scandal; it had always been my dear 
 Lady Denham, and my dear Mrs. Harmony, 
 till one most unpropitious evening that a 
 naughty card interfered ; eighteen shil- 
 lings were in hazard, and Mrs Har- 
 mony telling her ladyship, in the soft 
 tones of apoissarde, that she had practised 
 a ruse dejeu, Hoyle never taught ; the one 
 all fire, and the other all oil, such a con- 
 conflagration among the passions ensued, 
 that the downfal of that pile, which mo- 
 derns call friendship, became inevitable ;

 it sunk, but from its base there sprung a 
 
 branch, whose fruit is bitterness of spirit,, 
 
 and that bitterness now quivered on a 
 
 lip impatient to disclose Mrs. Harmony's 
 
 history as connected with Mrs. Moreland's. 
 
 An introduction to the great heiress of De 
 
 Dunstanville, for Mrs. Harmony delighted 
 
 in great things and great folks, was a 
 
 circumstance much to be wished by the 
 
 lieutenant-governor's widow. 
 
 But " Oh ! thoughtless mortals, ever blind to' fate, 
 Too soon dejected, and too soon elate !" 
 
 How little we know what we desire ; 
 Pandemonium in its dreariest recesses 
 would have been more supported than a 
 society in which Mrs. Moreland found 
 love and confidence. 
 
 Lady Denham now began — ^ Mrs. Har- 
 mony might well grow pale when the in- 
 jured Mrs. Moreland appeared ; it was ra-

 widow ; Oh ! Miss De Dunstanville, did 
 you but know how your amiable friend 
 has been treated by her." 
 
 " I have heard she has a daughter" said 
 Jane, " whose virtues will cover many of 
 her mother's failings," 
 
 "Yes, Miss De Dunstanville, that daugh- 
 ter, when young, uneducated, and almost 
 without a home, your friend received, and 
 cherished in her bosom for five years ; she 
 shared her affection, her comforts, and her 
 confidence, and was unto her as a mother ; 
 under her care every rising grace was im- 
 proved, and every talent and virtue ripened 
 to perfection ; she was in herself amiable, 
 grateful, and endearing ; her mother, 
 her sisters, her family, all were beloved, 
 and all found a hospitable welcome, giving 
 and receiving pleasure.

 ic At length death and desolation broke in 
 on the happy dwelling, treachery betrayed, 
 and poor Mrs. Moreland became a widows 
 her spirits broken, her health wasted, and 
 her reason nearly gone, she was, with 
 her infant family, cast upon the tumults of 
 life without even a home, and left to 
 struggle with difficulty, debt, and want." 
 
 Tears glittered in the fine eyes of Jane, 
 and Lady Denham went on. 
 
 " Mrs. Moreland was sinking beneath 
 the pressure of varied calamity ; she be- 
 lieved herself dying, and, as a last kindness, 
 the society of her fondly-beloved Charlotte, 
 her affection would have softened the harsh- 
 ness of fate ; her voice would have soothed 
 her melancholy, and almost charmed her to 
 peace ; but that balm was denied, and 
 cold contempt gave a new bruise to the 
 wounded spirit ; former kindnesses were

 all forgotten, the endearing hours and 
 tender confidence, all were forgotten j 
 Mrs. Moreland's warm heart could offer 
 no more, it had no more to offer ; she was 
 forsaken, scorned, and traduced, by the 
 very lips which, in happier days, had so 
 often blessed her. No one enquired 
 if she even lived ; she shed the secret tear, 
 breathed the lonely sig\ and suffered her 
 agonies unheeded and unremembered. 
 Yet the innocent mind can sustain much, 
 and only proudly resists the imputation of 
 dishonour ; she never descended to say 
 she had been wronged, till it met her in 
 every corner, that Mrs. Harmony's family 
 deserted her, for the intention of taking 
 legal steps for Miss Harmony's five years 
 abode with her. It was not believed ; Mrs. 
 Moreland could not believe it till it came

 with a dagger's sharpness from one she 
 had reverenced as a father" 
 
 The pale astonishment in Jane's coun- 
 tenance, and the quickened sparkle of h£r 
 eye, convinced Lady Denham that her in- 
 telligence had taken effect \ when, seeing 
 Mrs. Harmony, with her visage in a flame, 
 drawing nearer, with the malignant plea- 
 sure of revenge in her smile, she walked 
 away, and took a seat at a card table. 
 
 " My dear Miss De Dunstanviile" cried 
 Mrs. Harmony, anxious to recover the 
 great heiresses good opinion, which she 
 knew Lady Denham had shaken to the cen- 
 tre, and she assumed her most winning 
 smile ; " Lady Denham cannot enter into 
 my feelings, she is a stranger to the ob- 
 ligations I conferred on Mrs. Moreland ; I 
 was, indeed, her friend ; I will not tell the 
 proofs I gave of friendship ; I placed go-

 proud — " her advantages were great in 
 having Miss Harmony, she in treated her stay, 
 and my reward was threats of being prose- 
 cuted for various expences, when in fact she 
 ought to have been grateful for the patron- 
 age." 
 
 Jane's bosom beat with generous indig- 
 nation, her cheeks were flushed, and her 
 eyes sparkled with anger, while, in a voice 
 proudly impressive, she replied, " Mrs. 
 Moreland needs no patronage, her superior 
 virtue gives, it cannot receive consequence

 accustomed bluntness,

 Harmony's eye caught a spark from his so 
 expressive and penetrative that it entered 
 her heart — " Why they had a law, that 
 whoever was three times convicted of 
 speaking falsely ', was condemned, under 
 pain of death, never to speak again, but

 life."

 His look and manner while he spoke, 
 rendered the implication too apparent, it 
 admitted not of evasion, and its severity 
 was felt. 
 
 Mrs. Harmony's colour rose, her eyes 
 flashed, and with difficulty, a few vindic- 
 tive syllables fell from lips, pale with impres- 
 sible rage. 
 
 " I protest, madam," said he, insult- 
 ingly calm, " your resentment would 
 almost sanction an application, very de-

 would have found him a man of honour." 
 Pride and shame, anger and confusion, 
 even a feeling of momentary remorse, all 
 the painful passions that could assail the 
 mind, unattempered to the love of genu- 
 ine rectitude, now struggled together in 
 Mrs. Harmony's bosom, when, feeling no 
 refuge, no retreat in an unupbraiding con- 
 science, they all blended with the remem- 
 brance of her dead husband, and the 
 tumult rushed through her brain, render- 
 ing her condition at once pitiable and 
 pitied ; it was too much, the irrepressible 
 tears of embittered and humiliated pride 
 burst forth, and had only one of these 
 burning drops been witnessed by the 
 wronged, deserted friend of former years, 
 with soft assuasive hand it would have 
 been wiped from her pale cheek, and she

 bosom, soothed her to peace, and for- 
 gotten that she herself had ever been for-

 standard in every bosom ! then no eye

 refuge from every mortal evil.

 The busy world had returned to its 
 varied occupations several hours before 
 Jane's wearied form and aching head felt 
 the repose of her downy pillow, and then 
 the languor which crowded companies 
 generally produce, the recollected extra- 
 ordinary occurrence of the preceding day, 
 and Lady Denham's detail of what Mrs, 
 Moreland had suffered from ingratitude, 
 returned on memory, and usurped the 
 drowsy God's dominion ; it was, there- 
 fore, late next evening, before she and

 Mrs, Moreland had received a distant

 courtesy from her ci-devant friend, not 
 unaccompanied with a look of astonish- 
 ment at her appearance and familiarity 
 in such a circle; the interview had raised 
 the ghost of many a departed hour and 
 joy to Mrs. Moreland's mental view, she 
 could not but remember such things were, 
 and were most precious to her, and these 
 remembrances left her now as languid and 
 spiritless, as the pleasures of the dissi- 
 pated scene in which she had been en- 
 gaged. 
 
 " When, my dear child/' said she to 
 Jane, " do the votaries of ton allow their 
 winter to end , ? " 
 
 " You look as if you almost wished it 
 had never commenced; oh, my Mrs. 
 Moreland, I shall never forget yesterday,

 which succeed it, I feel an accusing pang

 at my heart for a waste of money, when so 
 many want. You, my beloved monitress ;" 
 and Jane's fine eyes were full of gems 
 which restored the lustre wasting vigils 
 had dimmed, " You have known want, 
 and I shudder — early habits make me 
 shudder, to think many deserving beings 
 pine for, but a little of what I so thought- 
 lessly presume to lavish ; my friend, be 
 as a mother, and direct me. Yesterday — 
 and yet I do not, cannot repent that" and 
 Jane looked, and felt so abstractedly, that 
 Mrs. Moreland took alarm. 
 
 " What of yesterday, my dearest Miss 
 De Dunstanville, what of yesterday ? The 
 more artless and innocent the mind, the 
 more open to design and deception ;

 " Amen !" said Jane, with pious fer- 
 vor, " but before I tell you the all of yes- 
 terday; and be Tiot alarmed, for all the 
 evil that can arise is over. You will con- 
 fide, and tell me how much of Lady 
 Denham's story respecting Mrs. Harmony 
 is true, for she spoke with acrimony ;— 
 what a life your's must have been !" 
 
 " It has certainly been one of painful 
 vicissitudes, made up of most sad, yet 
 unimportant events ; I have tasted of feli- 
 city, but drank of sorrow's bitter cup ; 
 the star of prosperity has more than once 
 glimmered on my life, but often has the 
 stormy night of adversity sunk me deep 
 in its heavy ^loom ; Lady Denham's tale,

 generally have; for my heart throbs even 
 now, but to think how Mrs. Harmony 
 forsook me, I made a sad miscalculation 
 of her sentiment, for though I loved 
 many, I loved her more, and she has 
 made me feel most. Her daughter, with 
 the virtues of a superior nature, and 
 many an endearing grace, had one defect, 
 from which I have suffered ; she ever 
 wanted resolution to judge for herself; 
 she would always comply, but the next 
 moment, were that compliance opposed, 
 she could not refuse, and thus for want 
 of a little energy and decision, she gave 
 to a character most estimable, the appear- 
 ance of imbecility, yet bless lier ! bless 
 her, heaven ! And should the angry spirits 
 of the earth still keep us asunder, one 
 barrier broke down, even the frail tene- 
 ment which only a weak breath upholds,

 and our kindred minds shall meet where 
 no harsh interposing relatives can divide 
 us ; there, with ev T ery feeling refined, every 
 suffering sanctified, every virtue improved ; 
 there, where neither bitterness nor pride, 
 envy nor resentment, forgetfulness nor 
 death, can obtrude ; there, beloved Char- 
 lotte, we shall meet, in innocence of soul 
 meet, and never feel the pang of sepa- 
 ration more. 
 
 " And when thy last days upon earth are declining, 
 When life's busy dream fails its powers to beguile 3 
 
 Be it your's on the bosom of mercy reclining, 
 To think on that future, and die with a smile." 
 
 " When the roses of comfort which had 
 bloomed so brightly in my happy dwelling 
 began to wither, and when the bitter weeds 
 of want and affliction reared their hydra 
 heads about me, then I was taught to cal- 
 culate the value of that fleeting shadow,

 called by the world, friendship ; I found 
 adversity like Penelope's night, undoing all 
 that the day of prosperity had done \ many I 
 could name, betrayed the instinct of a cat ; 
 much attached to the house, very little to the 
 one who kept it. To find friends when we 
 need them not, and not to find them when 
 we do, is too general to be deeply felt. 
 Of the multitude who were my visitors 
 I judged wrong ; their compact was with 
 the comforts of my condition, and when 
 they fled, I was taught my own individual 
 value.

 becomes the chief ingredient in the com-

 and death, they forgot to ask if I lived. But

 these characters were composed of nega- 
 tives without one positive virtue, and they 
 acted not so much from corrupt princi- 
 ples, as from having no principle at all. 
 One I so loved, did offer me her heart and 
 home. I wept in her bosom, and thought 
 my aching head might repose awhile on so 
 sacred a pillow ; but, alas ! the offer was 
 the sickly, momentary gleam of a weak, 
 wavering mind, not the permanent senti- 
 ment of a superior nature. She offered 
 to shelter my child, my innocent Lily,from 
 the tempest that was bending her mother 
 to the dust. I loved, confided, con- 
 sented, and almost adored ; my gratitude ! 
 earth could not confine it, it went to 
 God for blessings ; yet oh, oblivion, drop 
 thy darkening curtain and obliterate the 
 rest from bleeding memory. Still in this 
 beating storm of fate I was not quite for-

 saken ; but they were strangers, and my 
 gratitude will survive the wreck of being ; 
 gratitude, sacred gratitude ! ever blessing, 
 and ever blessed ; it subsisted in the age 
 of innocence, when there was no evil to 
 deplore, and it will be perpetuated in 
 heaven, when felicity has reached its 
 summit of perfection in the realms of 
 glory. 
 
 " I must have wearied you, my dear 
 Miss De Bunstanv:'•^3, , ' said Mrs. Moreland, 
 wiping the tears of remembrance from her 
 cheeks, " but as the recital has whiled away 
 a languid hour of this dull evening, I hope 
 you will excuse the pain my uncontrollable 
 feelings have excited ; and now let me 
 hear the all of yesterday."

 tered him at my grandfather's tomb; I then 
 gave him a promise of assistance, should 
 he ever want and desire it ; — yesterday he 
 claimed that promise ; he came, his very 
 look had irresistible power over my heart; 
 I felt impelled, controlled, he looked so 
 like my grandfather ; and when he spoke, 
 it seemed as if some one inexpressibly 
 dear and long lost had been restored ; and 
 had he then asked, — dear Mrs. Moreland 
 I was very weak, I could deny him no- 
 thing, and gave him five thousand 
 pounds !" 
 
 Mrs. Moreland started, " Good God, 
 Miss De Dunstanville, how could you trust

 " You will wonder still more at his te- 
 merity," said Jane, " in trusting me, for an 
 hour ago he had not presented the draft.'*

 " Oh !" and Jane felt the old enchant- 
 ment of his look at her heart, " not for 
 kingdoms would I have stopped it ; but this 
 delay proves he confides in me^ and deserves 
 my confidence \ I only sent from some 
 nameless wish I had to hear of him." 
 
 Mrs. Moreiand yielded to a train of 
 wild and strange imaginings, to which 
 reason could give no expression, and sen. 
 sible she had no right to reprove, and as 
 candor did not allow her to approve ; she 
 sat silent, while the fair and generous na- 
 rator minutely detailed every cirsumstance 
 of the mysterious and inexplicable stranger's 
 visit ; the golden locket was examined, but 
 excepting three letters, almost defaced by 
 time, there was nothing to be traced.

 Dillon Mor eland, in the seclusion in which 
 he had buried himself, heard that Lord 
 Danglecour's family was returned to town, 
 and, through the kind medium of Dinah, 
 Lady Ellen's maid, he not only learned 
 when she was at home and alone, but also 
 gained admission to her presence. Lady 
 Eilen was no friend to clandestine meet- 
 ings ; yet it must be confessed, whatever 
 her tongue murmured of impropriety and 
 freedom, her softened eye gave him a 
 smiling welcome. The respectful ardour of 
 his manner, the undeserved treatment from 
 her father, his preference, with his many

 recollected generosities, all crowded at once, 
 and with tears, which gave heightened 
 beauty to her charms, she confessed how 
 fervidly she loved, and that when of age,

 vehemence must be controlled." 
 
 " Ellen, beloved Ellen, I cannot, will 
 not leave you ; to night, this moment — 
 all favours," — and he had forced her from 
 the sofa. 
 
 She withdrew herself from his arms, and 
 was re-seated. " Do not," said she, " make 
 me fear our minds are uncongenial ; 
 virtue must attemper our wishes, pro- 
 priety regulate our actions, if we expect to 
 be rationally happy." 
 
 " Dearest Lady Ellen you sublime your 
 pleasures almost to air ; you live in sen- 
 timent, my heart has wishes, I have feel-

 reflective, nor perfectly reasonable; yet I

 firmness. " I accept no vows f 9 said she, 
 " no oath can bind your love so strongly 
 to me, as a sense of right should bind you 
 to your duties." 
 
 Dillon's pride made him feel indignant 
 under repulse, and while the fire of 
 blended feelings deepened the red upon 
 his cheeks, he replied, " Alas ! Lady 
 Ellen, do not let us waste the most pre- 
 cious hours of existence in the vain expec- 
 tation of my becoming € that faultless 
 monster which the world never saw;' but 
 deign to take me yourself, and make me 
 what you please ; I will be a puppet in

 about proudly and offended — " rejected

 fate becomes indifferent: the sword and 
 a foreign grave may settle all."

 Lady Ellen, calmly, " as your dernier

 to intimidate me to your purpose, Mr.

 " Madam!" 
 
 " Sir, I have been told your virtuous 
 mother says, the army has been the grave

 prosperity ; every sigh she breathes wafts 
 you farther from my heart: the man 
 who could so far forget his moral duties, 
 as disregard the wishes of a fond mother, 
 could offer no security to a wife that I 
 would venture to accept. Go, then, with

 Dillon retired, and by the private stairs 
 escaped unseen, when in gloomy dissatis- 
 faction he reached his cheerless apartment ; 
 his haughtiness of spirit, which would 
 neither stoop to a confession of error, 
 nor submit to reprehension, iiad impelled 
 him to descend to deception ; he knew 
 his mother's solicitude, and wished to

 tous friend his mother had found, and 
 sensible of her inability to aid him, he 
 proudly resolved to conceal his residence 
 from every one, till fortune should grow 
 weary of persecuting him, and produce 
 some change. 
 
 He loved his brother, he revered his 
 mother, he worshipped Lady Ellen ; but 
 so unbending was his spirit, so impatient 
 was he of controul, and so ill could he 
 regulate his feelings, that the very con- 
 sciousness of having been wrong, strength- 
 ened- the determination to persevere. 
 
 Poor children of error, little do you 
 think what evils the proud spirit engenders ! 
 even when the cup of sorrow may have 
 quenched the fire and bitter dregs, the 
 baleful fruit, remorse, still lives, gnawing 
 the bosom, and extending envenomed 
 influence to life's latest hour.

 Dillon Moreland had never quitted the 
 metropolis, and to hush the voice of 
 enquiry, and avoid all interview and 
 communication with his family, by his 
 valet, whom he had discharged, ard who 
 was going into Glamorganshire, he gave 
 a. letter, addressed to his mother. That 
 letter as has been seen, proved a temporary 
 solace to the unsuspecting mother ; yet 
 such is the effect of a first deviation from 
 rectitude on a mindat tempered to the love 
 of virtue, that Dillon endured that hu- 
 miliating anguish in this lapse from truth, 
 that would have been his mother's portion 
 had she known it. 
 
 Dillon Moreland never gamed, never 
 drank beyond the convivial glas c , but 
 he had spirits in his blood which mounted 
 high at the sight of beauty ; and though

 heart, were unalienably devoted to Lady- 
 Ellen, still Dillon could admire the sparkle 
 of beauty, and feel the influence of charms 
 even when possessed by the impure, and 
 degraded innocence ; but temptation now 
 assailed his senses in the shivering form 
 of a poor deserted being, driven by strong 
 calamity, and deceptive man, to seek for 
 bread from the hand of charity or prosti- 
 tution. 
 
 Her woe-worn frame lay extended on 
 the steps, as Dillon was returning one 
 evening to his solitary chamber. His heart 
 was the seat of feeling, his soul the throne 
 of sensibility ; nor could the infirmities 
 which darkened his mind obscure the 
 sentiment of pity which ever glowed for 
 human suffering. 
 
 He raised the poor pale thing from the 
 stones ; she was famishing and nearly

 speechless ; he threw some lavender in 
 her face, and in a few minutes she revived 
 sufficiently to tell him, she perished; 
 peribhed for want, . was a wretched thing, 
 and no one would pity her. 
 
 " I will," said Dillon, " I will pity you !" 
 Something felt in his throat choaking 
 him, and he was glad that no one could 
 witness the silly tears streaming down his 
 cheeks for human suffering, for human 
 sin. 
 
 " God, I thank thee," said he, " that I 
 laid her not here : — God, I thank thee, that 
 I can raise her from here 1" 
 
 And had Dillon stopped there, he had 
 conquered himself, — he had been a hero. 
 
 Patty was the youngest of three pretty 
 sisters; her father had been left by his fa- 
 ther, to labour or to perish, because beauty 
 beguiled him of his affections, and he had

 married a fair creature who hoped to 
 reach heaven, though she wore not the 
 sober attire, nor venerated the silence of 
 the quaker's severe society ; but they were 
 both gone to that land where it will r.ever 
 be enquired of the innocent soul in what 
 garb the way there was found. 
 
 The three orphan young women had 
 all been upper servants in great families, 
 and it was poor Patty's pitiable mishap to 
 attract the eye of her master. 
 
 In the first step of the down-hill path 
 of perdition lies the chief difficulty ; 
 Patty was more weak than wicked, and 
 believed ; more vain than vicious, and 
 capitulated ; her surrender soon fol- 
 lowed, and during the delirium of her 
 seducer's senses, could she have forgotten 
 " the quiet day and blameless night of in- 
 nocence, she might have *been thought

 happy ; but the winter of . illicit love 
 soon comes on, and most pitiless blows 
 the cold wind of sated passion on the 
 desolated bosom of the betrayed; indif- 
 ference, neglect, desertion, had all fol- 
 lowed in sad and quick succession ; the 
 gradations of vice are rapid, and poor 
 Patty's lowest step — to the street — was 
 precipitated by an unprincipled peer, who 
 then dignified her with his protection ; 
 he persuaded her to go to the theatre, and 
 she did go ; there, on some pretext, he 
 left her ; and on her return, she found a 
 legion of evil spirits had, indeed, been 
 there ; her lodgings had been visited by 
 her protector, and by his command, even 
 in the poor undone creature's absence, he 
 had stript the apartments, and left her 
 naked, and exposed to the mercy of a 
 world his vices had rendered merciless.

 But this was a chef d 9 ceuvre of whipism ; 
 this was bang-up to the mark ; prime to

 With this fair and frail creature, whose 
 gentleness, humility, and obedience, in- 
 spired a feeling, though untinctured with 
 respect, yet was far removed from con- 
 tempt, lived Dillon Moreland. Thus in 
 oblivion and gloomy inactivity he wasted 
 the listless day and lingering night, and 
 was fast sinking into those deepening shades 
 which end in sad despondency. Poverty 
 also approached, and rearing her haggard

 head diffused a sad variety of horror 
 throughout the wretched dwelling. v 
 
 His forlorn companion, lost to honest 
 exertion, lost to the fortitude of virtue, 
 without energy, and without effort, could 
 only wring her hands, and weep, look in 
 his face for his wishes, and obey him. 
 
 "My mother suffered," said Dillon, 
 pressing his burning hands to his proud 
 heart, " what did she not suffer ? ah! she 
 never suffered the accusing sting of con- 
 science, and that only is unbearable." 
 
 When adversity is received as a re- 
 proving monitor from heaven, every an- 
 gry passion sinks to rest, and every feel- 
 ing becomes composed - 9 but when con- 
 sidered the infliction of man, it corrodes 
 the heart, and embitters sufferings

 clearing complacency so pleased while 
 pleasing, which had attuned all around 
 to harmony, were now no more to be 
 found in Dillon ; sour, severe unkindness, 
 and a harsh immutability of spirit, em- 
 bitteied ins own feelings, and extended 
 their .saddening influece to the poor thing, 
 his dependant companion ; and, in every 
 cold and averted look, she read her sin, 
 and felt its punishment. 
 
 In this eclipse of poor Dillon's pro- 
 mising morning, he had that, without 
 which the master of a world would be 
 poor ; he had a friend who had been his 
 school-fellow ; the companion of his mind, 
 and the sharer of his innocent secrets in 
 more blameless and happy days. 
 
 This youth had received only a common 
 education ; but then he possessed no com- 
 mon mind; he had genius, sense, and un-

 derstanding; and to these natural properties 
 he had given the richest cultivation, by 
 an ardent and persevering love of litera- 
 ture. 
 
 His spirit was bold and energetic ; his 
 virtues were proud, and firm almost to 
 
 sternness ; and his heart warm, candid and 
 generous, yet tenacious and unbending ; 
 he was not gieatly born, but he had spirits 
 in h*s blood that would mount, and in- 
 spire him to attempt all that man ought to 
 attempt ; his every passion was high ; his 
 every fe< ling fervid; and his nature evinced 
 a bright intelligence cf thought, not the 
 communicated gift of mortals, but derived 
 from the great Immortal himself, 
 
 In his friendship, Rupert Butler acknow- 
 ledged no cold prudential limit, and love 
 in his bosom would be the comet's blaze, 
 with the sun's duration ; with the gene-

 rosities of a beneficent mind he had the 
 untutored courtesies of a feeling one, 
 and his character only wanted the soften- 
 ing touches of refined society to form the 
 perfect gentleman. Still he had one defect, 
 it was a fault ; and that fault lodged itself 
 in the only unimproved, unenlightened 
 nook of a superior soul ; human power 
 coula not reach the dark speck ;— the point 
 will be settled by a great Being and him- 
 self hereafter. 
 
 All Rupert Butler's leisure hours were 
 devoted to his friend, and he endeavoured, 
 by every kind and judicious argument in 
 his power to reawaken the slumbering 
 energies of a mind he knew to possess the 
 capabilities of giving and receiving happi- 
 ness ; yet his remonstrances were mild, and of- 
 fered in moments when he knew they would 
 be impressive. Poor Rupert's purse was

 and method gave and added value to every 
 sous. High, therefore, as was Dillon's spirit, 
 it felt soothed by his friend's considerate 
 attentions ; and srch was his influence, 
 he had almost persuaded him to address 
 his mother and return to society, when 
 distress reached its gloomiest point — Dil-

 CHAPTER XIII. 
 
 Lady Ellen Sterling had been hitro- 
 duced to Miss De Dunstanville by Mrs. 
 Moreland. and frequently met in the cir- 
 cles of fashion ; there was a similarity of 
 sentiment, and a consistency of man- 
 ners, founded on principle, in both, which 
 rendered them mutually pleased with each 
 other, and would have produced a lasting- 
 friendship ; but for various reasons their 
 intercourse never exceeded casual inter- 
 views in public, and in general parties. 
 Miss De Dunstanville was rather surprised,, 
 though not disagreeably so, at a visit 
 from her ladyship one morning, and at a 
 much earlier hour than modern belles 
 generally pay their devoirs. Jane by no

 for Dillon Moreland, and her mind deeply- 
 interested in all that concerned his mother, 
 instantly took alarm lest some evil con- 
 nected with his affairs had procured her 
 the visit ; but lady Ellen in a moment dis- 
 persed her apprehensions, assuring her, 
 with a blushing face, " that she was not 
 so happy as to know any thing of him, 
 but had waited on her to solicit a fa- 
 vour. 
 
 "It is concerning a young woman," 
 said her ladyship, " most deserving of 
 notice, who has been for some time my 
 own maid 5 and if not very inconvenient 
 I wish her to become a part of your esta- .

 and a few hours added lady Ellen's fa- 
 vourite Dinah to Jane's establishment. 
 
 The girl was certainly nnild, modest, arfd 
 pretty ; but her face expressed more feel- 
 ing than beauty ; and it was to reduce the 
 only pride Dinah ever knew — the pride of 
 innocence, and humble the only dignity she 
 ever felt, that lord Durwestorfs depraved 
 nature so ardently panted to destroy her ; 
 nay, that she presumed to repulse his free- 
 doms, and complained to his sister, ^dded 
 resentment to the debire, and he would 
 have gone any lengths to accomplish his 
 purpose ; but she was now beyond his 
 reach, because out of his knowledge ; and 
 with humility, attention, and apparent 
 contentment, she was performing all the 
 duties of her condition, when one morn- 
 ing Miss De Dunstanville surprised her in 
 an agony of tears, which she vainly en-

 deavcured to hide as her -lady approached 
 her ; but Jane's compassion was quick eyed ; 
 she condescendingly took her hand, and 
 would be informed of her distress. 
 
 Dinah had an elder sister, who had mar- 
 ried a young working jeweller, who, little 
 known, and less employed, had with clif- 
 fknlty supported his wife and three chil- 
 dren, wheftj as they fatally supposed, to 
 make their fortune, a valet recommended 
 him to Sir Felix Fribble, who ordered 
 some fashionable bagatelles, and also a 
 silver dressing box of considerable value, 
 for which ready money was to be paid. 
 
 On credit, and in high spirits with his 
 
 good fortune, he had executed this order, 
 
 but after the delivery of the articles, could 
 
 neither see, nor hear of the baronet ;— 
 
 threatened for payment himself, his family 
 
 perishing, and desperate with distress, he 
 
 resolved to wait at the door till he should

 the unfortunate man was pursuing his 
 way through Holborn, lost in the sad 
 contemplation of his accumulated wretch- 
 edness, when an over-driven bullock, fol- 
 lowed by a crowd of tormentors, rushed 
 on the pavement, threw him down, tramp- 
 led on him, and nearly crushed him to 
 death. In this pitiable condition some 
 humane being attended him home to his 
 wretched wife, whose cup of sorrow was 
 now running over. 
 
 Desperate, indeed distracted, she flew

 this most honourable personage. 
 
 The poor woman had related her sim- 
 ple and sad tale, and implored a little, 
 only a little for charity's sweet sake to 
 sustain her dying husband. With tor- 
 turing anxiety she repeated her prayer,

 None are so dull as those who will not

 holy warmth in his blood ; his heart was 
 chilled, iced by the very means which 
 should have opened every kindly spring 
 for the help of human wretchedness. 
 Sir Felix flew to the bell, and rung it 
 with violence ; his French valet, ILaroux 
 attended. 
 
 The poor creature's sunken eye as it 
 wandered round, fell on the very indivi- 
 dual dressing box as it lay open, with all 
 its cosmetics and perfumes. " This then, 
 Sir," she cried, her voice nearly convulsed 
 with rising agony, " this, 9 ' and her shak-

 that heart had often considered with 
 what sheltering kindness Britain cherished 
 and protected his forlorn countrymen, 
 and he now resolved to return one kind-

 allowed, to soften this poor injured being's 
 calamities, so putting his purse in his 
 pocket, he desired a footman to oblige 
 him, and order a coach, and attended 
 the poor sufferer to her wretched home. 
 
 On her arrival she found her poor hus- 
 band sunk into that heavy slumber, or 
 rather stupor; which sometimes precedes 
 dissolution ; but of that symptom she was 
 ignorant, and employed her momentary 
 calm in perusing some answers to suppli- 
 cations made for a little time, till her hus- 
 band's returning health should please God 
 to enable him to labour, when double di- 
 ligence should do every one justice.

 might consider her as a benefactress in

 apply with confidence ; I shall not forget 
 his humanity to oppressed helplessness." • 
 It was by these deeds of kindness and 
 mercy that Jane De Dunstanville in the 
 morning of life enriched the page of re- 
 membrance ; they gladden maturer years, 
 sweeten on reflection, and brighten the 
 dark path leading down to the chambers

 had desired her son, as a preliminary step

 a tacit consent, for to receive it either as 
 a request or desire, even her most san-

 " Miss De Dunstanville," cried her 
 Ladyship, maternal pride usurping even

 abandoned home. If I have tried to alie-

 stanville must look up with reverence, 
 it would break her heart to look down 
 with pity on the man she had sworn to 
 honor and obey." 
 
 Lady Clancarron remained silent ; her

 perception of things would have accepted,

 Don Diego D'Almeyda, was reputed to be 
 a nobleman of vast power, and immense 
 possessions, in his own country ; but as he 
 had become the avowed and accepted 
 lover of Lady Florence Clancarron, on 
 their nuptials he had promised and enga- 
 ged to dispose of all his alienable property 
 and settle in England. 
 
 This personage was of majestic stature, 
 with strong, dark, expressive features; 
 his eye large, penetrating, and full of subtle 
 fire ; his look altogether severe, and his 
 manners haughty, sullen, reserved and for- 
 bidding ; he seemed to possess a depth of

 art, and sternness of resolution, in any 
 conceived design, which very few would 
 be able to counteract or subdue. 
 
 The kindly and candid soul of our he- 
 roine recoiled from his approach, and he 
 never addressed her, but a chilling sensa- 
 tion seemed to freeze her blood, as if a 
 warning to retreat from such ungenial 
 influence. 
 
 Often she surprised his fixed eye upo^ 
 her face, with a meaning wild, dark and 
 strange ; and when the ambiguous stare 
 was detected, he would cautiously with- 
 draw it, wrap its import in mysterious 
 gloom, and sink into dumb abstraction ; 
 but innocenqe is ever fearless, the upright 
 mind unapprehensive, and Jane, removed 
 from hfs repellant presence, never thought 
 more of him, his gloomy looks or dark 
 meanings.

 Jane had never passed a more inno- 
 cently festive evening than at this school 
 ball, and some days after, when speaking 
 of the pleasure she had enjoyed, sportively 
 declared, only it would distress some hearts, 
 she should be tempted to steal away the 
 enchanting Marian, whose naive manners, 
 and intelligent mind, quite captivated her. 
 
 " A truce to school girls, and school 
 balls," cried Lady Clancarron, " a wider 
 field for your depredations is opening. 
 Lord Berkhamstead's grand masquerade 
 is next week, and if some bold being do 
 not confine your mischief-making powers, 
 by securing you as an exclusive possession, 
 you will steal wits as well as hearts. 
 
 " Do you go in character. Miss De Dun- 
 stanville ?" asked Don Diego, recovering 
 from one of his reveries, and thinking it

 necessary to say something by way of 
 joining in the conversation. 
 
 " Not in my own, Don Diego," she re- 
 plied, " for charity's sweet sake ; as a dis- 
 play of such fascinating properties would 
 be dangerous, it seems, to the poor crea- 
 tures who would peep." 
 
 Mrs. Moreland's aversion was strong 
 and decided to this species of entertain- 
 ment ; and though she knew her influence 
 would deter Jane from partaking it, she 
 did not conceive she had any right to 
 controul her, except what affection might 
 offer against it ; seeing, therefore, that 
 her young friend was more than usually 
 anxious for this festivity, she resolved to 
 attend her there ; she had never been at 
 a masquerade herself, but alv/ays heard 
 them described as scenes contaminating 
 to female delicacy, where unlicensed plea-

 sure reared its destructive banner to the 
 subversion of innocence and feminine 
 propriety. 
 
 When Mrs. Moreland did remonstrate 
 on any subject with Miss De Dunstanville, 
 she never relinquished her point till con- 
 viction effected her purpose; but on this 
 occasion, much as her heart recoiled, she 
 offered neither argument nor opposition, 
 but with perfect quietness began preparing 
 the sober attire of a quaker for her own 
 appearance. 
 
 Miss De Dunstanville, as she did not 
 wish to appear conspicuous, chose a nun's 
 dress of the order of black sisters ; and, 
 notwithstanding all the serious looks of 
 IVIrs. Moreland, Jane's heart palpitated 
 with delight as she anticipated this mas- 
 querade,

 it must be confessed, she had entered with 
 spirit into all the gaieties of the heau mo?ide; 
 and as she moved in the very first circles 
 of fashion, it could not be expected but 
 that her amusements Vv'ould sometimes, 
 verge towards dissipation ; — she glittered 
 a star of the first magnitude ; led the 
 ton, had her box at the opera ; nay, we 
 are sorry, but she could even bet her cool 
 hundred, and lose it too with a non-chalence 
 becoming an heiress. She had always 
 betn an expert and elegant horse-woman, 
 and without having taken one lesson, or 
 borrowed one grace from the modern 
 whips, she could drive her curricle 
 in a very spirited style, and, but for 
 the attem,pering judgment, and gentle 
 remonstrances of Mrs. Moreland, to whose 
 opinions she ever gave unqualified defe-

 Jane, might, by the prevalence of pernicious 
 example, and in the indulgence of haut 
 ton, have sometimes forgotten the practice 
 of the virtues which had so distinguished 
 her early years, and rendered her the 
 delight of an adoring parent. 
 
 The unaffected graces of her lovely 
 figure, with her splendid fortune, attracted 
 a numerous train of admirers ; but so well 
 timed, and artfully applied were Lady 
 Clancarron's hints, and so judiciously 
 did she insinuate that the solemn engage- 
 ments subsisting between her and Lord 
 Clancarron were reciprocal, that the mer- 
 cenary crowd was awed to silence, while 
 those possessing real honour and feeling, 
 shrunk from addressing the affianced bride 
 of another, and did voluntary homage 
 to her beauty and worth in respectful 
 silence.

 Lady Clancarron had derived many 
 solid advantages from her intimacy vi^ith 
 Jane. '* The improvements of dear old 
 Clancarron Castle were very expensive, 
 but it certainly would be a paradise, though 
 so very far north;" on ^Ae^^ occasions Jaqe's

 Then there were delicate hints that 
 " really both mamma and brother were par- 
 simonious even of her own fortune ;" these 
 often decorated the artful Florence v/ith 
 many a glittering gew-gaw, to the diminu- 
 tion of her cousin's purse. 
 
 Still Lady Clancarron was dissatisfied ; 
 she could not feel so assured of her son's 
 success with Jane, as she wished the world 
 to believe ; his progress in her good 
 opinion was not slow, it was on the con- 
 trary retrogressive, and her Ladyship

 sions inflamed her features, and deformed 
 her bosom, that while he was manoeuvring 
 his whip, and driving his servants, some 
 one with more wit, and dexterity too, 
 ■would drive Jane to church. 
 
 Lord Clancarron's education had never 
 accustomed him to control ; and the voice 
 of counsel or remonstrance was sure to 
 strengthen what it was intended to rectify 
 or subdue ; and it was on these occasions 
 only, that candour graced the lip of this 
 most ungracious peer.

 "The long and faithful attachment which 
 has ever cemented the families of De Dun-

 " Abs ! alas !" and Lady Clancarron 
 claspt her hands in seeming anguish as she 
 rejoined, " I know v/hat you have made 
 him, I knov/ what you can make him." 
 
 "I made him!" repeated Jane, really 
 astonished, *^ what, madam, have I made 
 him?" 
 
 " A lover, an adoring lover !" 
 
 Jane started. 
 
 ''Do not start, Miss De Dunstanville, 
 you cannot affect amazeriient." 
 
 Our heiress possessing a clear perception, 
 and correct judgment, had for some time 
 formed her estimate of Lady Clancarron's 
 character ; and now, in one reflective 
 glance, could develope her motives and in- 
 tentions respecting herself. 
 
 " No, my dearest child, you must not

 affect ignorance of Clancarron's passion ; 
 your union completed, I have no more to 
 do on earth ;" and a tear was pressed 
 into the service — " no more, but I can 
 then descend to the grave in peace." 
 
 '' I should be much concerned, Lady 
 Clancarron," replied Jane, with perfect 
 calmness, yet resolved in her manner, 
 " did your Ladyship cdlow your peace in 
 any way to depend on su h fallacious 
 ideas; hopes, my obvious indifference never 
 could have made them." 
 
 " Indifference ! good God ! and do you 
 allow him no hope — give him no en- 
 ccurajement to hope ?*^ 
 
 Jane was very generous, and very good 
 at giving, as her Ladyship had often ex- 
 perienced, but with all her generosities 
 and givings, this she neither would, nor

 " Who — what ?" exclaimed her Lady-

 deed unaffected — '' Miss De Dunstanville I 
 Mrs. Moreland," — She paused, and a tu- 
 mult of thought rushed over her perturbed 
 mind, which burst forth with irrepressible 
 violence. 
 
 " Yes, it is, it must be so. — You have 
 sons, Mrs. Moreland," and her eyes flashed 
 indignant iire — " your Alfred — he — " 
 
 The impulse was irresistible ; Mrs.

 Moreland burst into a loud laugh — " My

 " Oh, the dear Alfred," echoed Jane, 
 laughing louder than her friend, " the 
 saucy boy! he has given me a willow 
 wreathe already, and mounted the colours 
 of the bonniest lassie in the world. No^

 opportune entrance of the harp-master 
 prevented further discussion, when Lady 
 Clancarron, bursting with all the passions 
 which assail a violent and vindictive heart, 
 defeated and disappointed in its purposes, 
 took her leave, yet secretly vowing if she 
 had either invention, art, or stratagem, 
 she would find a way to humble the heir- 
 ess and secure her fortune.

 Lord Berkhamstead had but one son, 
 and as that son c Id only be twent -one 
 once in his whole life, the father deter- 
 mined an era so auspicious to the illus- 
 trious race, should be celebrated with as 
 much splendour, taste, and magnificence, 
 as possible. The scene of e t ve gaiety- 
 was at a villa, belonging to that nobleman, 
 on the banks of the Thames, and had the 
 preference to town, as the gardens and 
 pleasure grounds would allow of a larger 
 company, and more unconfined conveni- 
 encies and decorations.

 generally kn'own, and so frequently de- 
 scribed by more able delineators, that I 
 v/ill leave the glowing imagination of the 
 reader to conceive all that was gay, bril- 
 liant, festive, and luxurious ; every art 
 that could rempt or aLure, captivate or 
 enchant ; every thing that could hush the 
 voice of reason and awaken sense, deaden 
 propriety, and excite intemperance, heigh- 
 ten the throbbing feelings, and kindle 
 the fire of passion, all were here displayed 
 to a height that might have gratified 
 the voluptuous, and almost palled upon 
 the sickly vitiated taste of sensuality it- 
 self. 
 
 To Jane's pure soul it appeared the 
 region of enchantment ; she felt as if in 
 fairy land, and never dreaming of beings 
 less innocent than herself, she indulged 
 the sweet delirium into v/hich pleasure

 liad lulled her sense^ and unapprehensive 
 of evil as of dani^er, gave freedom to the 
 brilliant glow of a gay and sportive imagi- 
 nation* 
 
 She, with Mrs. Moreland and Alfred, 
 joined Lady Clancarron's party, but were 
 soon unavoidably separated, yet by pri- 
 vate signals, more than by the dresses, 
 which many frequently changed, they 
 knew how to recognize each other. 
 
 The novelty of some grostesque cha- 
 racter had attracted Jane's notice, and she 
 was about to make some remark to 
 Alfred, when he Vv^as almost forcibly 
 dragged from her by a bolstero^is sailor, 
 who was palling along with him a flower 
 girl. Alfred was dressed as a tar, and the 
 brother of the sea mistaking him for some 
 other, vociferated —

 *' Halo ! messmate, how lays the land ?

 Alfred, humom'ing him. 
 
 " To her again, Jack, that's my tight 
 one !" and here, we'll strew your way 
 over with flowers, my brave boy," and as 
 he sung his ditty, he scattered the con- 
 tents of his damsel's basket. 
 
 During this, Jane had found herself sepa 
 * 
 rated from her party, and though unpro* 
 
 tected, was entirely unalarmed ; in another 
 
 instant, fancying she saw Mrs. Moreland at 
 
 a little distance with a group of gypseys, 
 
 she was tripping nimbly towards her, 
 
 when a tall figure, in magician's robes, 
 
 grasped her arm, saying, in a voice not 
 
 altogether strange to her ear, though at 
 
 the moment lost to recollection* 
 
 " I know you."

 and she felt his trembling hand grasp her's 
 as he repeated, " I know yoUy know

 by virtue of my character — my character 
 of mystery I speak." 
 
 " Indulge your humour, Sir," replied 
 Jane, affecting a fearless air, though her 
 heart palpitated to be near some one she 
 knew, " indulg it; lam no stranger to 
 the mystic jargon of these motley 
 scenes*"

 Moved along by the pressing, throng- 
 ing crowd, they had reached an alcove, 
 where seats of green velvet, raised like 
 irregular hillocks, invited the weary to 
 take momentary rest from the tumult of 
 varied delights. 
 
 Janes ideas felt rather confused, by the 
 rapid succession of passing objects, and in 
 the hope of seeing some one pass she 
 really did know, she seated herself at the 
 opening of the recess. 
 
 *' Iknoipyou !" again reiterated the ma- 
 gician, and his voice grew deepened \ and 
 as he stood beside her, she caught the fiery 
 beam of a heavy eye, and its glare was 
 blasting as it shot through the mask ; he 
 spoke, and his tones were appalling ; the 
 words dark, inexplicable, and mysterious. 
 
 " Bright being 1" he cried, *' brightest 
 being that often breaks upon my black-

 Jane's blood felt curdling ; speech was 
 choked in the horror of thought, and 
 she gaspt^ but scarcely respired. 
 
 " Hildebrande Fitz OrmondJ' She 
 shrieked in convulsive terror ; he went on, 
 *^ Hildebrande Fitz Ormond is lost ; to thee 
 is lost for ever. This night decides thiji 
 fate, fixes thy destiny. I know thee ; know 
 all ; know what thou wilt be ; what thou

 Bewildered in thought, and harrowed 
 in apprehension, she arose from her seat ; 
 his voice grew softened. 
 
 *^ We will seek your Mrs. Moreland, Miss 
 De Dunstanville ; nay, start not, I said I 
 knew you, and when in her presence, a few 
 words will break on your appalled ear, 
 firm in their purport as yon fixed star 
 blazing in its orb above us, and irreversible 
 and immutable as the word of him that 
 fixed it there." 
 
 Enveloped in terror, confusion, and 
 amazement, and led, or rather dragged 
 by the mysterious being, Jane continued 
 to rush through crowds of masks, while 
 her wandering eye in vain sought to dis- 
 cover some one she could speak to, and

 who would extricate her from her terrif)'- 
 ing companion. 
 
 " Where am I dragged?" she cried at 
 length, " where am I going ?'* " To Mrs. 
 Moreland ; we seek Mrs. Mor eland," said 
 the magician. 
 
 Poor incautious Jane ! thy feeble feet 
 were bearing thee far from the mild and 
 sacred shelter of protecting friendship ; 
 thou wert in the hands of a Demon. A 
 suspicious dread of something glanced 
 over her mind.

 denly snatching her hand fwjin his grasp, 
 as he was hurrying her do.vn a narrow 
 avenue, whose light was shadowy and 
 obscure, from the green Lv:^ps hung on 
 the lower branches of the trees. 
 
 "I will go no farther, I will return." 
 At that instant her other arm was violently

 seized, and swift as the whirlv/ind, she 
 was borne between the magician and ano- 
 ther, till they reached the ruins of a Go- 
 thic temple, very remote from the scene 
 of festivity. 
 
 The building had no roof, they were 
 exposed to the open air ; the moon was 
 rolling, in silent majesty, thiou[;h her 
 realms of ether, and the stars we.:e glit- 
 tering among the silvery clouds ; the 
 voice of revelry could be no longer heard, 
 and the sounds of distant music, as iney 
 blended v/ith the early gale of mornmg, 
 now broke faindy on the surrounding 
 stillness. 
 
 Jane's sensations grew maddening ; to 
 her fears she could give no name, yet as 
 she felt the approach of dangers uninia- 
 gined, she felt a proud fcrtiiude rise in

 proportion, to resist indignity, in whatever, 
 form it might threaten. 
 
 " Enter T' said the magician. A pause en- 
 sued, and in that pause the beating throbsof 
 Jane's heart could be heard j the magician 
 spoke. 
 
 " Here are no sacred shrines, nor awful 
 altars, with mystic mummery to bind a 
 compact ; they swell, indeed, the pomp of 
 proud ceremony, and may operate on the 
 weak and superstitions', but neither streng- 
 then human institutions, nor sanctify the 
 marriage vow above/' 
 
 Jane stood stiffened in thought, her 
 blood congealed. 
 
 A dark lantern was produced, and emit- 
 ted its feeble gleam over the ruin, the ma- 
 gician took a paper from under his robe, 
 and in a language Jane understood not, 
 spoke a few words to his companion , the

 paper was unfolded, but of its form Jane 
 was ignorant ; it was a marriage license, 
 and as the words it contained were uttered 
 by the magician's kind-hearted accomplice, 
 they fell like burning bolts upon her inno- 
 cent soul ; — yet the powers of that soul 
 strengthened ; new spirits were kindling 
 in her blood, and a proud energy swelled 
 her heart ; while a fortitude, not her own, 
 upheld the weakness of feminine appre- 
 hension, it gave a dignified defiance to her 
 form, and she felt almost super-human; 
 a haughty lightning darted from her eyes, 
 and in the superiority of a virtuous mind,

 ing innocence to ruin, subverting the gra- 
 cious ordinances of God, and turning a 
 hallowed contract to a demon's plot, he^iov 
 a moment, felt " how awful virtue is,'* and 
 did stop. •

 cian, in tones that broke terrific and un- 
 common on the aching sense, " hope nei-

 " Be mine ; in this instant, irrevocably

 despair, will hunt thee to nature's verge, 
 nor leave thee in the grave, so fell, so dire, 
 so deadly is my vengeance, when awoke by 
 passions which mortals shudder but to

 Jane's pulse beat with fevered agony 
 yet every fibre of her heart felt firm, and in 
 a proud determination to perish, but never 
 to submit to a ruffian violation of every law, 
 human and divine, she raised her fine eyes 
 to him whoseeth in secret ; — her hands were 
 held, but her spirit, her pure spirit felt rising 
 above the enfeebling '^ wrappings of morta- 
 lity ;"she held a moment's communing with 
 lier God, and caught a ray from the ce- 
 lestial presence which cheered, irradiated, 
 and sustained her innocent bosom ; a 
 holy energy pervaded every nerve, ever} 
 aching sense, and in the calm triumph

 of supreme aid, as the figure attired in 
 canonicals demanded, 
 
 ^^ Wilt thou have this man — " and she 
 interrupted him in a firm voice, 
 
 ''1 will not:' 
 
 Her firmness for an instant awed them, 
 and she continued, " what dark assassin 
 presumes to violate the sanctity of mar- 
 riage rites by such a bold defiance of 
 our laws ? think me in your power ; I 
 dare its sternest vengeance; and learn, the 
 soul that fears not death, can smile at 
 every ghastly terror ; the soul that trusts 
 in God, can fear no danger." 
 
 The grandeur of her manner, with the 
 deep and impressive energy of her tones, 
 inspired a momentary dread* They felt 
 appalled, and for a moment irresolution 
 suspended their design ; but the magician

 soon recovered boldness enough to be 
 active. 
 
 " Perdition on this war of words !" he 
 shrieked — '' my deeds are damning, and 
 shall be daring ;" and he seized her vio- 
 lently round the waist, and bore her 
 forcibly from the ruin. 
 
 She uttered one wild and dismal shriek; 
 it was full of helplessness, terror, agony, 
 and despair ; and in a few moments Jane 
 would have been a wretch, and lost for 
 ever, but a poor honest peasant, with his 
 faithful mastiiF, happening to pass at the 
 critical moment, and without knowing 
 more than that a woman was in disu'ess, 
 and, as he conjectured, about to be mur- 
 dered by robbers, he gave the word to 
 his shaggy companion, '' who, nothing 
 loth," calmly seized the magician by the 
 arm ; when, compelled from excruciating

 pain, he let his prisoner fall to the 
 earth. 
 
 She instantly started from the ground, 
 and, without staying for the ceremony of 
 thanking her deliverer, with the rapidity 
 of lightning she flew through the grounds, 
 and guided by the brilliancy of the moon, 
 and the dying ^ sounds of the music, 
 stopped not till once more among a few 
 stragglers, who, tempted by the fineness 
 of the morning, had quitted the scene 
 of tumult for a momentary calm. Her 
 brain felt burning, her spirits were in a 
 ferment, and the throbs of her heart 
 were audible between the pauses of each 
 convulsive gasp she had strength to re- 
 spire. She was unconscious of her safety, 
 every thought was in the wildest confu- 
 sion, and altogether unable to support 
 herself any longer, she fell at the feet of

 a gentleman, whose figure was wrap- 
 ped in a black domino, as if for conceal- 
 ment. 
 
 The word " mercy 1" in a tre- 
 mulous voice, was all she could utter^ and 
 then the torture of feeling was lost in deep 
 insensibility. 
 
 The ear on which the plaintive cry for 
 mercy had now vibrated, was attuned to 
 mercy, and his heart ever admitted the 
 soft appeal of feminine sorrow ; he raised 
 the fainting angel in his arms, and bore 
 her to a rustic temple, which at the mo- 
 ment happened to be vacant, and while 
 gently supporting her on his bosom, he re- 
 moved her mask to sprinkle her face with 
 lavender, when a stream of light,, from a 
 pendant lamp, falling full on her pale fea- 
 tures, she was recognized.

 The black domino gave a convulsive 
 start ; " Angel of mercy !" he cried, '* sweet 
 image of the purest beings, and was thi/ 
 prayer, thy own prayer for mercy, and 
 to me! Blessed creature, whom didst 
 thou fear ? who could alarm thy gentle- 
 ness ?'' 
 
 Jane*s eyes unclosed, and their soft 
 beam fell on the stranger.

 cried, and a serene and indefinable delight 
 diffused itself through her perturbed bo- 
 som. " Oh yes, quite safe with you ;

 with emotions new and complicated ; long 
 forgotten feelings beat wildly, and were 
 swelling his heart ; and as a deepened 
 groan burst forth, with a burning hand 
 he clasped Fitz Ormond's, and pressing it 
 to his lips, cold in qnivering agony, the 
 words, " God, I thank thee !" were faintly 
 heard, when, shrouding his head in the 
 folds of his domino, he started up, and

 mixing among the crowd disappeared, and 
 was no more seen. 
 
 " Blessed girl, my matchless Mary, we 
 will part no more !" cried Fitz Ormond, 
 the fire of a pure and hallowed passion 
 brightening his cheek, while chastened 
 rapture was shining in his eyes — " we will 
 never part." 
 
 " We will, only to meet again," said 
 Jane, attempting to be calm ; her soft 
 tremulous accents, while they penetrated 
 every sense, repressed an ardour which 
 reached to agony. " Yes dear, dear Hilde- 
 brande, indeed, we will meet again, Jane 
 De Dunstanville, this night, this very 
 night : '* 
 
 " Speak not of Jane De Dunstanville 
 now,'' he interrupted, " be this moment,

 love and virtue, and to the sanctified 
 wishes of our own souls." 
 
 " You must love her,*' resumed Jane^ 
 *' she is the arbitress of our fate ; our feli- 
 city is dear to her as her own, and cir-

 Mary will be your's, for ever your's, and 
 your wife, in your cottage, will never 
 envy the proud turrets of De Dunstan- 
 ville, nor sigh for scenes of greatness." 
 
 Fitz Ormond felt imparadisedj the rich, 
 soft, satisfied feeling of that one mament, 
 was worth a millinium of rapture to 
 common minds. Extreme emotion al- 
 most suspended the effort to respire, and 
 his breath grew low and quick ; he held 
 her hands, " speak not T/e*/," he again said, 
 not yet, for this dear enchantment might 
 dissolve. Blessed assurance! it mingles

 " Be more calm, Hildebrande, and lis-

 smiling, " you can. give orders about the

 The innocent magic of her v^oice at any 
 time could charm his senses ; the tumult 
 of joy subsided, and. he grew composed ; 
 and altogether heedless, nay, almost insen- 
 sible to the motley group passing and re-

 out Jane having once recollected that hec 
 disappearance and long absence must have, 
 caused alarm. 
 
 " Dear Hildebrande./' she resumed, " I 
 must positively seek my party, and when 
 I have joined them, leave me ; I wish no 
 interrogatories nor observation till our 
 fate be beyond the power of malign inter- 
 position ; I must not be interrogated dear^

 about to speak ; " you are my subject till

 " Angel of sweetness ! but one word,

 not harm me — ^no — ^not in the least, his

 Hildebrande thought the rapid manner 
 in which she described the cause of her 
 alarm rather extraordinary ; but he wa3 
 too happy to make any comment, " and 
 the person who was so friendly, supporting 
 my Mary, when her dulcet tones blessed

 night, though the sun had for some time 
 proclaimed the day, he retired to his 
 apartments, in all the luxury of delighted 
 expectation ; and antideluvian, and gothic, 
 and unfashionable as it may be considered, 
 by our modern beaux and belles in this 
 age of reason and refinement, Hilde- 
 brande Fitz Ormond, in the full glow of 
 youth, elevated spirits, and anticipated 
 felicity, sunk on his knees, and offered up 
 a prayer of thanksgiving to Him who 
 benignly watches over all our ways. 
 
 Neither vanity nor variety had marked 
 the days and nights of Fitz Ormond since 
 we left him rationally devoting his time 
 to literary pursuits ; he had, however, 
 occasionally mixed with the beau monde^ 
 but so cautious was he at encountering the 
 captivating and admired heiress, that he 
 often refused pressing invitations to the

 superior parties in which she was said to 
 move a goddess ; and, as he never could 
 dream of meeting his own lowly, lovely, 
 unadorned Mary, in these splendid cir- 
 cles, he preferred the contemplation of 
 her inoffensive beauties and graces as they 
 irradiated the recesses of his own ador- 
 ing heart to the pretensions of her high- 
 born, high-fortuned, supposed rival. 
 
 He had received a ticket for Lord Berk- 
 hamstead's masquerade, from his friend 
 Mr. Murray, and, wearied at being always 
 wise and never fastidious, he joined the 
 fascinating scene, little, indeed, anticipa- 
 ting the fascination which there greeted 
 him. 
 
 His supposed Mary's soft encouragement 
 and tender confessions, her permission to 
 prepare for her reception, with her ecsta- 
 tic assurance of becoming immediately

 his wife, had thrown every sense into a 
 commotion which aim ost reached delirium, 
 and it was not till many hours profound 
 repose had restored him to quiet reflec- 
 tion, that he could sufficiently arrange* 
 his scattered ideas so as to become active 
 even in his own ardent wishes. 
 
 The note for two thousand pounds, 
 with which he had so generously accom- 
 modated Lord Clancarron, had been some 
 days due ; the recollected conversation 
 with Mr. Murray, gave him some passing 
 uneasy thoughts, but they did pass, for 
 the honourable mind suspects no dishonour, 
 which renders the unexpected blow more 
 heavy and severe on the guileless heart.

 rade his Lords hip/or^'O^ to attend, and as 
 a gentle souvenir became now indispensable,

 Lordship was gone out on particular busi- 
 ness, but would write, it would suit him 
 to write next day ; so said the Countess j 
 and by her manner of saying it, proved 
 she was no stranger to the business ; which 
 in some degree quieted certain apprehen- 
 sions that Fitz Ormond, malgre all his 
 confidence, could not entirely subdue.

 Fitz Ormond had absolutely started from 
 his chair, and the blood rushed in deep

 Her Ladyship surveyed him with asto-

 " And that once must have been a mo-

 Florence,with ill- repressed malignness, " else 
 burning cheeks give very false evidence." 
 
 " So sacred, so dear is that lady's remem-

 "Some mystery lurks, some mischief

 of," cried Lady Clancarron,in secret coun- 
 cil with her son and daughter, after his 
 departure, for his Lordship had gone no 
 farther than into his mother's boudoir, his 
 business to avoid the man he had wronged, 
 and now he was wronged, that he hated, 
 and whom he had neither abiUty, honor, 
 nor inclination to redress.

 she continued, mats en atle?idant, listen,

 The evening came, and brought a fash- 
 ionable assemblage to the Countess Clan- 
 carron's drawing rooms ; music, dancing, 
 and cards, filled up the jocund hours; 
 yet Fitz Ormond could not be gay ; at 
 times a coldness crept through his blood, 
 burning pains darted through his head, 
 and wild imaginings were confusing his 
 brain ; he wished to retire, but was de- 
 tained ; and, feeling an aching weakness 
 pervade his limbs, which. left him almost 
 passive, under the pretext of amusement, 
 he was seated at table with a chosen party, 
 where they were playing high.

## p. 75 (#85) ##############################################


 
 JANE DE DUNSTANVILLE. 75 
 
 Fitz Ormond disdained the vice of 
 gambling, yet, if his character had a dark 
 trait, it was an inclination for play, but, 
 he had never indulged it ; but now en- 
 treated as he was, rendered almost uncon- 
 scious, and, little aware of any premedi- 
 tated treachery he complied ; was fortu- 
 nate, and won some hundreds ; fatal 
 lure ! 
 
 They played deep, and bets ran high ; 
 luck turned, but then he could not recede ; 
 he lost considerably, grew desperate, and, 
 would double his bets. 
 
 In that moment, the friend in female 
 guise approached his ear. 
 
 *' Do not be surprised — Jane De Dun- 
 stanville is coming." 
 
 Something flashed before his eyes, his 
 brain burned, his pulses throbbed 5 yet,

 Still he held his cards as if impatient to be 
 done. 
 
 They went on ; insensibly he joined, 
 
 " A cool hundred."

 " Two hundred ; — who's afraid !" 
 
 " Four hundred, my buck."

 And Fitz Ormoad xvas undone. 
 
 The name of Miss De Dunstanville was 
 buzzing around ; the cards, the candles, 
 the company, all swam in horrid tumult 
 before his tortured sight. 
 
 Jane would behold him, and Jioxv ! She 
 would repeat what she beheld, and to 
 whom ? 
 
 The creature reared, existing by her 
 bounty and care, the betrothed of Mary 
 a gamester i a detected, ruined ^gamester ; 
 his noble nature could not bear the fear- 
 ful retrospect ; the burning pang of re- 
 morse seized his confused senses ; he gaspt, 
 *' Mary ! — Jane! — * undone! he would 
 have added, but the word died unut- 
 tered on his whitened lip, and, sinking 
 from his chair, he was carried motionless 
 from the room.

 chinations succeeded ; the destroyer, aided 
 by a kincjred fiend, had drugged the 
 wine which lulled his senses in stupor ; 
 the table and party were pre-arranged for 
 their base purpose ; no Miss De Dunstan- 
 viile came ; no Miss De Dunstanville was 
 coming. 
 
 " The colouring is too deep," cries 
 the guileless one, unknowing in the sub- 
 tilities of fashion. Alas ! no ; it is the

 Notwithstanding that fatigue and 
 alarms, and the agitation such fearful 
 alarms might be allowed to produce, Jane 
 could not retire to her pillow, till she had 
 reposed the strange occurrences of the 
 evening in the faithful bosom of her 
 truly maternal friend Mrs, Moreland ; she 
 detailed the whole, with as much accuracy 
 as possible, but memory retained very 
 indistinct and imperfect traces of the ma- 
 gician's figure and voice, though she felt 
 convinced that neither was altogether 
 unfamiliar.

 munerate, in proportion to tha service he 
 had rendered her in such an hour of 
 peril; and even the poor trusty mastiff, in 
 having been the more active agent of her 
 preservation, she also resolved to purchase 
 and reward by a life of ease and plenty. 
 But among all her generous and grateful re- 
 solutions, none so entirely gratified Mrs. 
 Moreland as her avowed determination to 
 drop all her fanciful my stery : mystery which 
 might have been productive of such mis- 
 chief and misery, and in the sanctified 
 abode of a husband's sheltering bosom^

 Fitz Ormond, secure a refuge from future 
 dangers, and the plottings and machina- 
 tions of the envious and m.alignant, 
 which, it v/as too evident, would never 
 cease till her marriage extinguished every 
 hope of ensnaring her guileless nature.

 ^' You may not admit the surmise, my 
 dear young friend," said Mrs. Moi eland, 
 " yet I think it possible the stranger and 
 magician may be confederates ; beware of 
 any future encounter, my child; be on 
 your guard, and let nothing tempt you to 
 receive strange visitors till your arrange- 
 ments are made, and publicly announced 
 virith Mr. Fitz Ormond." 
 
 '* To that I most willingly accede,'* 
 replied Jane, convinced of her friend's 
 judicious solicitude, " but banish the inju- 
 rious thought of the stranger being any 
 way connected with the magician; his 
 speaking eye tells truth ; some inexplicable 
 sensation makes him dear, and my heart 
 feels safety in his presence. Oh, my dear 
 friend ! could I but know his name, learn 
 his history ? He is so like some thing my 
 
 very soul loves, that he must be good."

 Jane's fine face was irradiated by the 
 glow of goodness which warmed her own 
 bosom, as she justified and defended him 
 from suspicion, and Mrs. Moreland kissing 
 the generous enthusiast's cheek, they each 
 took a cup of coffee and retired to their 
 respective chambers. 
 
 The intermediate days till the expected 
 visit of Fitz Ormond, she was denied to 
 all company, and devoted the time to 
 writing, and arranging matters with her late 
 grandfather's solicitor ; for it was still the 
 resolution of her generotis heart, to marry 
 him as the heir, instead of humbling him 
 with the idea, that he married the heiress. 
 
 At length, the morning of appointment 
 dawned; the hour of expectation came, 
 and Jane's impatient eye watched every 
 passing movement of the time-piece. At 
 last the hour sounded ; it was the sweetest

 tone that ever struck on the ear of Jane, 
 it might be followed by Fitz Ormondes 
 step. 
 
 Mrs. Moreland, from motives of deli- 
 cacv, advised that their first interview 
 should be unwitnessed, " it will be too 
 interesting for any eye — must be sacred 
 to your own hearts ;" and, attended by Al- 
 fred, she went to pay a morning visit to 
 Lady Ellen Sterling. 
 
 Jane was now alone, the modest colour- 
 ing of chastened feeling brightened her 
 . beautiful cheek ; her eyes beaming with 
 the radiancy of virtuous sensibihty, and 
 the innocent pride of surprising him she 
 loved, with such pure and holy fervour^ 
 v/ith the wealth and distinctions of De 
 Dunstanvilie's heiress, when he only ex- 
 pected the lowly, unknown, portionless

 Mary, heightened every charm, and gave 
 a finishing to every softened grace. 
 
 Jane was in her boudoir, a full length 
 picture of her revered grandfather v^as 
 before her ; the eye seemed to look with 
 delighted complacency, and it gave an 
 exquisite richness to thought; she ex- 
 claimed, in mild rapture, " This moment, 
 revered being, you look even from your 
 heaven, on this dear moment, when your 
 children will be one !" 
 
 The sweetest anticipations fluttered at 
 her heart, and every idea as it arose, was 
 attempered to innocent delight. 
 
 But an hour had elapsed, and still no 
 Fitz Ormond appeared ; " he comes not 
 with a lover's haste,'* occurred to her mind, 
 but she repressed the thought — it never 
 stained her lip. 
 
 Another hour passed on, and still he

 came not ; tender apprehension began to 
 be busy ; it shook her gentle bosom, when 
 a loud knocking announced a visitor, and 
 made the circling current revulse around 
 her heart ; she started from her chair, 
 but unable to move a step, she staggered 
 and sunk down again ; — she heard a foot 
 ascend the stairs— her composure gave 
 way, her spirits receded, and she felt very 
 faint; the room door slowly opened, her 
 heart throbbed, her very soul hung on her 
 
 ashy lip 
 
 " Fitz Ormond ! my Fitz Ormond !'* 
 Two gentlemen were introduced ;' un- 
 announced, they were introduced. 
 
 The figure of one was clumsy and un- 
 couth ; and his features, coarse and rudely 
 harsh, seemed darkened by the low cun- 
 ning of a m.ean and malign spirit ; a bushy 
 brow added heaviness to an eye whose very

 gleam seemed withering to the peace of 
 mortals ; but there were two. 
 
 The other— he was Don Diego d'Al- 
 meyda. 
 
 When rapture swells the innocent bosom 
 with expectation of a coming joy, what 
 bitter name has torture for the disappoint- 
 ment ? it has been felt, but never was 
 described ; it was Jane De Dunstanvilie's 
 feeling in that moment, but she never gave 
 it a description. 
 
 A delicate sense of propriety, which ever 
 regulated her actions, now prevailed ; and, 
 repressing the painful emotion wringing 
 her heart, she arose, and, with her usual 
 modest dignity of manner, requested they 
 would be seated. 
 
 ** We thank your courtesy. Miss De 
 Dunstanville," said Don Diego, bowing

 of little compliment, we can dispense with

 His abruptness rather surprised, and in 
 another, would have disgusted her ; but 
 the dark and sullen reserve of this fo- 
 reigner had inspired but one sentiment, 
 and, in her open and guileless soul it was 
 unalterably the same ; she therefore simply 
 returned his bow, and silently waited to 
 hear what his business could be with her. 
 
 '^ You consider yourself," said he, tak- 
 king a long stride towards her ; " Do you 
 not consider yourself the legal, undisputed 
 heiress of De Dunstanville ?" 
 
 Jane raised her eyes, and fixed them on 
 his severe dark visage. 
 
 " It has never, Sir, been the subject of 
 my consideration." 
 
 '* Do you inherit by descent, or by an 
 exclusive bequest ?'*

 said she, rather proudly, " on such a sub-

 Jane smiled ; in the proud and conscious 
 security of her rights she smiled. 
 
 ^^ Till you can invalidate them, Don 
 Diego, you will permit me to plead an 
 engagement and retire." 
 
 " Stay 1" he cried, impeding her pur- 
 pose, his stern eye glaring malignly on 
 her ; " stay, and hearken to an offer that 
 means you well ; rejection sinks you to 
 beggary. Lord Clancarron loves you, he 
 would marry you ; accept him, and for 
 the love I bear his sister, Lady Florence, 
 I will dower you with five thousand

 fearlessly listen ; but, dark man, I tremble 
 not J no, I disdain your menaces, as I defy 
 your power, and, unappalled, wait for your 
 prophetic voice to disclose this threatened 
 doom; but ere you speak, hear me ; rather

 Jane arose with dignity ; her eye emit-

 A small miniature of Sir GeofFry hap-

 felt the hallowed influence, and it sus- 
 tained her trembling spirit ; she pressed 
 the unconscious image to her lips, to her 
 bosom, 
 
 " My grandfather ! I am your Jane De 
 Dunstanville !" — she said no more. 
 
 Don Diego gnawed his nether lip ; his 
 looks darted rage, and an envenomed ran-

 of. his repellent face.

 Jane vouchsafed no notice of his me- 
 nace, but in calm and dignified silence, 
 quitted a presence baleful to every feeling 
 of her upright soul. 
 
 Who he might be, or what his claims, 
 she had not considered ; but on leaving 
 the room, she involuntarily threw her 
 eyes down the well stair-case, and beheld 
 several mean, ill-looking fellows in the hall, 
 as if taking inventories. 
 
 She flew to Mrs. Moreland's apart- 
 ments ; she had not retun^ed, but there 
 stood poor Dinah, pale and weeping. 
 
 " Oh 1 madam, what ! — what !" re- 
 spect suspended the rest ; but a kind interest 
 in all that concerned her benefactress, had 
 forced from her grateful heart, the ago- 
 nized *' what !-^what !"

 " What!— what! indeed," replied Jane, 
 '^ alas ! Dinah, I know not what ; but all in 
 this late happy and innocent mansion is such 
 horror and confusion, that I must quit it, 
 and I have no De Dunstanville, no beloved

 Here she burst into a violent passion of 
 salutary tears, which, in some degree, 
 composed the swelling anguish of her 
 heart, for with the sheltering heaven, 
 the dear idea of Fit z Ormond's cottage 
 blended, and she felt that in that retreat, 
 his bosom would be paradise, and his 
 guardian tenderness a defence from wrongs 
 and persecutions. 
 
 She flew to the writing-table, and in 
 
 trepidation uncontrollable, she wrote 
 
 To Hildehrande Fitz OrmoncJ.

 A mild and holy hope now diffused 
 itself through her mind, and its balmy 
 influence quieted the tumult of agonized 
 thoughts ; she felt more collected, self 
 collected, and ringing the bell for a ser- 
 vant to take Fitz Ormondes note, she 
 occupied the moments till Mrs. Moreland's 
 return, with giving orders to Dinah to 
 pack up her clothes, for neither jewels, 
 plate, nor valuables, would the people in

 Calm and resigned, she was removing 
 her papers from her writing table, the 
 interior appurtenances of which being of 
 f solid gold, constituted it a valuable ; and, 
 consequently, a prohibited article, when 
 Mrs. Moreland made her appearsmce. 
 
 She had found Lady Ellen anxious and 
 dispirited, not having heard either of, or 
 from Dillon for some time, and in that 
 gloom of reflection, too deep for the rays 
 of hope to penetrate, she alighted at the 
 gates of the heiress.

 The sad vicissitudes of Mrs. Moreland's 
 life had made her no stranger to the 
 unfeeling and merciless procedure of what 
 is falsely denominated justice, in the 
 abodes of distress and want ; instantly, 
 therefore, she understood the business 
 that was going on when she entered the 
 hall, though that it should be acting there 
 was an enigma her reasoning faculties 
 could in no way solve ; with her heart 
 therefore, throbbing with the blended 
 emGiions of horror and consternation, she 
 asked the meaning of what she beheld.

 But the attached Caledonian, who had 
 grown grey in the family, could add no 
 more ; he ran off as fast as age, infirmi- 
 ties, and anguish, would allow him. 
 
 The females were running about in 
 tears, and wringing their hands ; the men, 
 some in stupified confusion, and others 
 yielding to violence, abuse, and invective ; 
 the expression of the whole group varied, 
 yet all increased the distracting commotion, 
 till the lower regions, so late the portrait 
 of regularity and hospitable economy, 
 were converted into a rude and undistin- 
 guishable chaos. 
 
 Self and self interested objects were in- 
 stantly forgotten by the sympathizing 
 heart of Mrs. Moreland, she threw one 
 wild and melancholy glance over, the 
 scene, and with trembling limbs staggered, 
 rather than walked to Jane's boudoir,

 when, commanding her feelings, and affect- 
 ing composure, she took the pale, yet 
 calm Jane in her arms, crying, " My angel 
 friend, what means this strange and hur- 
 ried confusion ?'* 
 
 Jane tried to smile through her tears. 
 
 *' No|:hing, dear, dear Mrs. Moreland, 
 Mary has .still her Fitz Ormond, still has 
 
 his love, and his cottage, and 
 
 but Jane has nothing for him, nothing 
 now to offer /iim." 
 
 Her voice was low and plaintive, but 
 she continued, wiping her tears, " An heir 
 1 as risen from the grave j from the shades 
 of oblivion has risen and claims every 
 thing ; the son of Sir Geofiry's elder 
 brother claims all ; Don Diego is that son, 
 is that heir, and -I am a beggar, Jane De

 while a strange terror gleamed in her 
 eye — " you almost blight my senses; whom

 able claim." But as matter of fact can 
 better elucidate character, than even com- 
 ment from the wrung heart, while Jane 
 and Mrs. Morcland are preparing to take 
 their farewell of Portman Square, the 
 finger of truth shall nought set down in 
 malice, but simply a sad, sad tale, deliver 
 and delineate, the striking traits that 
 mostly distinguish Don Diego's upright 
 solicitor, both in private and professional 
 life. 
 
 Mr. Flarehomme was of mean birth, 
 and low obscure breeding ; education he 
 had very little, and of talent still less ; his 
 nature was dark, subtle, cruel, and betray- 
 ino; ; and if there wanted another vice to 
 fill up the measure of human depravity, it 
 was ingratitude, and that he possessed in 30

 super-eminent a degree, that all the 
 others compared with it seemed virtues in 
 him. 
 
 Early in life, by means which honesty 
 would shrink from, and honor disdain, 
 he gathered up some perishable dross, and 
 with this he erected a fabrick of profes- 
 sional reputation, which encouraged the 
 unwary and desperate to employ him, and 
 the needy to associate with him. 
 
 His wife was alternately the victim of 
 his tyranny, his meanness, and his caprice ;. 
 the ill-fated being has been known to bor- 
 row money for household expenses, nay 
 necessaries, because the proud Attorney 
 must be able to boast, he always keeps five 
 hundred pounds at his bankers ; in his 
 care she lost her health, her happiness, and 
 at one time nearly her reason ; she was ge-

 nerally considered mild and inoffensive, 
 but of her head she could never boast 
 much, and her heart had been so long in 
 her husband's keeping, that she could not 
 boast much of that either. 
 
 According to the annals of a strong, 
 building, fatal to the culprit, he once 
 evinced such superiority of skill, in the 
 manufacture of a last testament, that he 
 had very nearly reached a point of eleva- 
 tion which gives an uneasy sensation to 
 the neck ; but the old arch one, who sel- 
 dom forsakes his' adherents till quite fitted 
 for his own gloomy territories, helped him 
 to creep out at one of the many loop- 
 holes which the honest and honourable 
 never sought, and therefore never found 
 in the devious windings of the profes* 
 sion.

 guile, who had been a friend to the friend- 
 less, and a father to the orphan, a stranger 
 to Mr. Flarehomme's rtal character, and 
 real principles, became his friend and in- 
 timate; under a rude and coarse exterior,, 
 he believed there were virtues, because he 
 himself was a stranger to vice ; and under 
 the holy guise of friendship, he betrayed 
 this man's family to want, and himself to 
 ruin and to death. 
 
 This lawyer had guaranteed payments 
 for a certain mercantile house, whose law 
 business produced him considerable annual 
 profits; he knew its credit expiring, he 
 knew it sinking to bankruptcy ; yet, with 
 Satanic and remorseless heart, he exerted 
 every influence with tliis guileless man, 
 and induced him to place his whole pro- 
 perty in this falling firm, assuring him.

 it would recover its consequence, and 
 produce him ample independence. 
 
 The sums he had guaranteed for the 
 house were paid ; all were paid, but the 
 friend, the father, the husband sunk the 
 unupbraiding victim ; persecuted, poor, 
 sick, and forsaken, torn, tortured, and 
 undone ; meekly he bowed his head, for- 
 gave his murderer, and expired.

 CHAPTER VII. 
 
 To know and to feel what was right, and 
 to put it in practice, was one and the 
 same thing with Jane De Dunstanville ; 
 and considering Lady Clancarron's family, 
 as relatives, had some claim to her de- 
 ference, though little pretension to her 
 regard, she dispatched a note to the 
 Countess, requesting the favour of. an im- 
 mediate interview, to consult on a subject 
 not more unpleasant than unexpected and 
 extraordinary ; Jane, also, hoped to learn 
 from her Ladyship on what grounds Don 
 Diego's claims were founded ; therefore, she 
 awaited her answer with some degree of 
 impatience.

 Lady Clancarron's answer. 
 
 ^' The Countess Clancarron's compli- 
 ments to Miss De. Dunstanville ; she has been 
 apprized of the occurrence to which she 
 alludes, but, being occupied in attending 
 to important family arrangements, is pre- 
 vented waiting on her.'* 
 
 Jane was unacquainted with the dark 
 side of human nature, and her pure heart 
 was a stranger to that species, of friend- 
 ship, '' which follows wealth and fame, 
 but leaves the wretch to weep." 
 
 It was, therefore, with a sensation 
 bordering on pain, that she handed the 
 card to Mrs. Moreland, asking her in a 
 voice tremulous from dejection of spirit, 
 " what it could mean r" 
 
 " It means, my dear simple child, that

 with twenty thousand pound: a year, and

 Jane De Dunstanville, the oppressed and 
 depressed child of misfortune, are two 
 distinct personages in Lady Clancarron's 
 ' estimation ; added to that, remember, 
 Don Diego is the lover of Lady Florence, 
 which unites them in one interest.'* 
 
 Very providentially our poor heroine 
 had a fifty pound note by her, which would 
 answer for present expenses, and that with 
 her wardrobe, her grandfather^s miniature, 
 the stranger's locket, and a likeness of 
 Fitz Ormond, included her whole worldly 
 possessions, and with these relics of great- 
 ness and felicity, behold her with' sweet- 
 ness in her looks, and quietness in her 
 manner, the occupant of furnished apart- 
 ments in the house of Dinah's widowed 
 sister ; she had parted from her domestics 
 with tears on her side, and blessings on 
 theirs, with execrations mingling with

 JANE DE DUNSTANV1LI*E. 117 
 
 those blessings on her oppressors. Old 
 Malcolm Campbell would not quit her ; 
 he had nursed her in a cradle/ and only 
 the coffin should separate them. Sir Geof- 
 fry's servants always had en6ugh to live 
 on when they were grey-headed ; and, 
 therefore, he wanted nothing but to be 
 near his young Lady. 
 
 Dinah, the gratefully attached Dinah was 
 now her only attendant, and always dis- 
 puted with her sister in watcking her looks 
 and anticipating her wishes. 
 
 In the very bloom of youth, beauty, and 
 hope, she w^snow deprived of weaith,rank, 
 power, and patronage, with all the dis- 
 tinctions so gratifying to the young and 
 glowing heart ; yet Jane felt one pang 
 severer than them all, one sting had sharper 
 venom, it reached her heart's core, and

 there it rankled till the aching senses nearly 
 maddened. 
 
 Her letter to Fitz Ormond, and such a 
 letter, was unanswered, unnoticed ; it had 
 been left with his valet ; he had received 
 it, he had read it, the people said, and 
 immediately discharging his lodgings and 
 valet, in an agitation of ^spirits, and irri- 
 tation of temper they had never witnessed 
 before, without having left one order or 
 direction as to letters or messages, he has- 
 tily quitted the house. 
 
 This strange mysterious conduct gave 
 a cruel disappointment to her every softer 
 hope; her warm and vivid imagination 
 had pourtrayed the pure and peaceful 
 feUcity of an earthly paradise in Fitz Or- 
 mond's humble secluded cottage ; she 
 anticipated it as that dear possession of the 
 innocent heart which passeth shew, and

 when she quitted her splendid mansion, 
 the s^veet idea arose on imagination, and 
 diffused a brightening ray over the heavy 
 gloom which involved her perspective of 
 felicity. 
 
 " Oh ! Mrs. Moreland, Mrs, Moreland !'* 
 she cried, when the account of Fitz Or- 
 mond's sudden disappearance was related j 
 *' the suspensive dread I feel ; this igno- 
 rance of his fate, this uncertainty of his 
 meaning, added to all the rest, will destroy 
 me ; it shakes my reason already^ and my 
 brain is bursting ; miy fate is now indeed 
 insupportable, my anguish intense." 
 
 Tears streamed from her aching eyes, 
 while cold shudderings of foreboding evil 
 deadened her heart, and gave an ashy hue 
 to her cheek ; " This desolates my bosom 
 more than all; his heart was my wealth,

 his worth my world, my own fatal follies 
 have lost him, and I am now lost myself." 
 
 Too true it was, that poor Jane suffered 
 more real anguish, and gnawing regret in 
 Fitz Ormond's strange disappearance and 
 silence, than from all her other depriva- 
 tions ; and it was under this depression, 
 and a total abandonment of hope, which 
 almost extended to despondency, that she 
 experienced the balm of consolation and 
 support from the sense and regulated sen- 
 sibility of Mrs. Moreland ; she at once 
 soothed and sustained her, and by rational 
 and tender arguments, moderated the 
 impetuous feelings of a nature which had 
 only known the enervating luxuries of 
 unlimited indulgence. 
 
 Mrs. Moreland was well calculated for 
 the gentle offices and tender endearing 
 intimacies, and in her nature was the

 happy art of blending instruction with the 
 soothings of hope, and she was at once the 
 active friend and gentle monitress. " Yield 
 not, my beneficent child, yield not," said she, 
 " to such impetuous feelings; repress them, 
 my superior Jane, and rise above a dejec- 
 tion unworthy of your sense and, charac- 
 ter ; if indulged, they will eiitinguish

 but bright and unexpected, a happy de-

 restore you to each other."

 gether convinced by her friend's reason- 
 ing, felt her wilder passions more com-

 posed, and sinking meekly on her knees 
 before Mrs. Moreland, with her beautiful 
 eyes glittering mildly in their humid orbs, 
 raised to her face, their spirits mingled, 
 she felt her friend's ideas transfused into 
 her own heart, and after some few mo- 
 ments passed in the soft luxury of mutual 
 endearment, nature felt giving way, they 
 yielded to the heavy influence of sleep, 
 and lost the recollection of sorrow in a 
 transient slumber. 
 
 Jane and Mrs. Moreland had been some 
 days the inhabitants of their humble resi- 
 dence, and had so apportioned their time, 
 that each hour had its occupation, and not 
 only excluded languor, but also the bitter- 
 ness of reflection ; their mornings now 
 were really mornings. And they had one 
 day retired (r m their frugal dinner at the 
 hour of four, when Dinah, with looks of

 astonishment, and a disgust which respect 
 could not conceal, announced a most unex* 
 pected, and not a most welcom^e visitor to 
 Miss De Dunstanviile. 
 
 It was the Countess of Clancarron ; her 
 ladyship entered with more than her usual 
 boldness of demeanour, and threw a well- 
 understood glance around an apartment 
 she knew very ill-suited, and very differ- 
 ent to Jane's condition, then vv^ith a bend- 
 ing which spoke the warm heart at a dis- 
 tance, she seated herself. She threw a 
 rude examining look over the figure of 
 Jane; it was the look of a little soul 
 anxious to appear great, that meekness 
 might feel mortified by inferiority; but 
 the mind of Jane De Dunstanviile was 
 innately great, and a modest dignity im- 
 parted graces to her figure, while inno- 
 cence sat beaming on her open brow.

 Of Mrs. Moreland the Countess did 
 not deign the slightest notice ; but saying 
 with an imperious hauteur^ she desired a 
 private audience without interruption 
 from any uninterested, Mrs. Moreland 
 arose, and with the quiet scorn her ladyship 
 had inspired, was quitting the room, but 
 Jane stopped her, " My dear Mrs. More- 
 ^^,^A stay; Lady Clancarron's exception

 more warmly L'3terested in my fate than

 Lady Clancarron's eyes darted malignant 
 fire; the glare passed over Mrs. Moreland's 
 face, but it reached not one feeling ; pres- 
 sing, therefore, Jane's hand tenderly, she

 dain, shall not interfere with the purpose 
 of my visit." 
 
 Jane bowed and waited in silence, and 
 her Ladyship resumed. 
 
 " Had you acted with the consistency of 
 character expected from, and becoming the 
 heiress of De Dunstanville, many of your 
 present distresses, and much of your hu- 
 miliation would have been spared you." 
 
 Jane looked up, but was calm. " You 
 had now been the Countess of Clancarron, 
 with rank, distinction, and happiness." 
 
 *•' For the distresses, madam, which pro- 
 vidence permits," replied Jane, " his mercy 
 will sustain ; humiliation I feel not, for 
 fate cannot reduce the greatness of a vir- 
 tuous mind, nor humble the pride of in- 
 tegrity."

 " I feel it. madam, appropriate to a vir-

 " Well, Miss, you may carry your ro- 
 mance as far as suits you ; my commis- 
 sion is from Don Diego, or I ought rather 
 to say, Sir Diego De Dunstanville, for such 
 he really is, and from Lord Clancarron, 
 and your answer will be awfully decisive 
 of your future destiny ; it will either re- 
 store you to the sphere in which you 
 have moved, or degrade you to a state so 
 abject, that your mind cannot imagine 
 it." 
 
 Jane assured her of perfect attention. 
 
 Lord Clancarron loves you still ; so

 Lord Clancarron, Don Diego will drop 
 proceedings ; indeed, the Ungering delays 
 of law, suit not his impatient and ardent 
 passions ; he will, I say,withdraw his claims, 
 and allow an equal division of property, 
 landed and personal ; if you reject this 
 proof of love and friendship, you know 
 your fate, abide its horrors if you can." 
 
 " Your Ladyship has been so perfectly 
 explicit, and circumstantial," replied Jane, 
 that you demand a reply, equally unre- 
 served and explanatory ; once before you

 yet thus importuned, I feel constrained to 
 make a repetition ; you, madam, may deem 
 my decisions ill-timed pride, I consider 
 them well-timed propriety ; the hand I re- 
 jected in prosperity, I reject still ; the heart 
 I valued in prosperity, I value still ; and it 
 will value me in rags." A soft sigh of re- 
 membrance passed the lips of Jane, but 
 she continued^ 
 
 *^ The rank which titles confer is worth- 
 less, in my estimation ; the superior soul, 
 and upright mind, that can suffer, but 
 never stoop to meanness, that can perish,

 which have my reverence, and in their 
 unfading glory, in the midst of poverty, I 
 can be great. My heart decidedly and

 can level my mind to his ; no suffering 
 compel, no terror could intimidate me to 
 become his wife ; a love, pure and holy as 
 that of angels, from infancy, has warmed 
 my bosom ; a dying grandfather's sacred 
 voice sanctioned that love, and my heart 
 will cherish the beloved being till death

 fears rushing through her brain, " Fitz 
 Ormond ! you love Fitz Ormond?'' 
 
 " I live but in the thought of him ,- I 
 am his ailianced wife, and more proud and 
 blessed in that dear title, than if empires 
 called me sovereign. Such be my answer

 accept so large a portion of his property ;

 offer ; knowing my own claims, I sit

 " It is well," said Lady Clancarron, 
 rising, and affecting composure with an 
 ill-dissembled smile, " it is well ;" yet she 
 felt it not well, for fears to which she 
 durst not give expression were gnawing 
 at her heart; yet she added, "hereafter 
 you will rue the proud repulse a false secu- 
 rity emboldens you to make." 
 
 '' Never, madam, can I rue a perse-

 calmly arose, and to her ladyship's haughty

 even more dissatisfied than she came. 
 
 No sooner was the door closed on the 
 countess, than the fortitude and spirit 
 which had supported Jane in her insulting 
 presence gave way, and she yielded to the 
 most violent and uncontrollable feelings ; 
 Mrs. Moreland was alarmed for her senses, 
 and knowing that soothing rather streng- 
 thened, than repressed hysterical affec- 
 tions, she spoke with a severity which, as 
 it surprised, moderated the storm among 
 her passions, yet she spoke, and with anger. 
 " I am persecuted by all," she cried in .bit- 
 terness of soul, " I am forsaken, betrayed, 
 censured, even by those I have loved and 
 served. I am poor and degraded, what 
 ,have I to do with life ?"

 Jane ceased, for theunuttered thought

 and agitated fea urcs ; he.- h^art tenderly 
 pitied her, and secretly mourned that the 
 early blights of sorrow had so chilled and 
 embittered a nature so full of sweetness 
 and beneficence ; the zephyrs of prospe- 
 rity no longer attempered her feelings ; 
 but a brooding canker generated in the

 ungenial influence, and Jane felt its venom 
 gnawing her heart. Mrs. Moreland's looks, 
 and a tear which fell from her eye, reached 
 that cankering worm, melted the frozen 
 drop, and Jane's asperity of temper gave 
 way ; she threw herself on the bosom of 
 her friend, crying, *' You — you, ever so 
 gentle and kind — you I have reproached.'* 
 " To me, my dearest girl, you were ever 
 kind and beneficent," said Mrs* Moreland, 
 " and that you made me so happy, should

 CHAPTER VIII. 
 
 On the eventful evening in which iniquity 
 accomplished poor Fitz Ormond's ruin, 
 his valet had been waiting in the hall to 
 attend him home, as was his usual custom; 
 and when he beheld the master he loved 
 brought down stairs pale and motionless, 
 astonishment and terror had nearly ren- 
 dered the honest fellow as insensible as 
 himself; he stood as if transfixed, when 
 one of the numerous footmen, who were 
 looking on, commisserating both masterand 
 man, ordered a hackney coach, and assisted 
 both into it ; air and motion restored the 
 senses of the valet, and by the time they

 Fitz Ormond, who one moiTjent world

 baleful juice, which premeditated trea- 
 chery, for the vilest purposes, had infused 
 into his wine. 
 
 During an intellectual ray, while he had 
 the power of collecting ideas, and i-ecol- 
 lecting past circumstances, he desired 
 Tomkins to bring him materials for writ- 
 ing, when in the. following letter he de- 
 manded the two thousand pounds for 
 which Lord Clancarron was his debtor—

 His gloomy fits of abstraction were 
 becoming shorter and less frequent ; and 
 during the absence of his valet, who was 
 his messenger to Lord Clancarron, he occu- 
 pied himself in perusing some letters, left 
 for him during the days of his extreme 
 indisposition.

 The first two were from his TaHor and 
 Coachmaker, who, according to his orders^ 
 had inclosed their respective accounts. 
 
 He next broke the seal of one, whose 
 characters and name were unrecognized. 
 
 " Major De Lamaine, has the honor to 
 remind Mr. Fitz Ormond of la petite ba- 
 gatelle, (one thousand pounds) which he 
 lost to the Doldrum^ at Clancarron House. 
 The major can easily accept illness for 
 Mr. Fitz Ormond's silence on the subject,

 Fitz Ormond had not forgotten, he open- 
 ed another.

 Clancarron House, why a word is enough, 
 and Sir Dennis has two pretty creatures 
 very quick in their errands, and that al- 
 ways do their business properly ; they are 
 rather noisy to be sure, but then the same 
 person is seldom disturbed a second time. 
 An answer will oblige Mr. Fitz Ormondes 
 servant to command. Sir Dennis is no 
 ilincher." 
 
 Fitz Orm.ond almost smiled, but he 
 laid it quietly aside, and took up another; 
 memory was now quickened to torture, 
 dreadful recollections rushed through his 
 brain, and they lodged in his heart ; the 
 latter shook in liis weakened hand, and

 his brain, a thrill of ecstacy pervaded every 
 vein, and his beating bosom swelled to 
 sudden rapture. It was from Mary ; it

 contained her tender, yet agitated request 
 to hasten to her ; it contained the accep-

 of his cottage ; it was the offer of her- 
 self. 
 
 What then were poor Fitz Ormondes 
 sensations ! what he did feel, he could feel 
 no longer, no more, for the iatenseness of 
 agony had reach a point where reason's 
 guiding ray was lost ; and when his valet 
 returned, he found him with distended 
 mouth, and a fixed glazed eye, cold, stif- 
 fened and insensible, grasping the fatal 
 letter. 
 
 The transient suspension of Fitz Or- 
 mond's mental faculties, probably saved 
 his reason ; it was gracious, for after a 
 fev/ hours incoherent wandering, recollec-

 the energies of a noble mind, and, had

 him to deeds of bold exertion ; but she 
 had claimed his protection, claimed his

 robbed, and ruined ; he now felt himself

 said too much. He had, indeed, for the 
 dreadful recollection that the cottage and 
 Mary too were lost, his happiness and his

 he shrieked, "distraction! it should have

 The storm of feverish feeling was again 
 kindling, yet the fibres of his heart felt 
 cold and hardening ; his blood curdled, 
 his /pulses throbbed, and only the fiery 
 brain felt burning.

 Again his senses were hanging on the 
 whirl of horror ; again the wildness of 
 delirium was seizing him ; but he sud-

 feebleness of inanity returned, and lest 
 recollection should again leave him, he in-

 The knocks Fitz Ormond gave were low

 the scene which met his petrified sight j

 oth< rs covered with filth ; the porter's 
 comfortable chair was in tatters ; and a 
 rose wood table stood in the midst, on 
 which were scattered egg-shells, pieces of 
 fried bacon, porter pots, shattered glasses^

 bottles, tobacco pipes, and several packs 
 of dirty cards ; all seemed to commingle 
 in disgusting confusion, pourtraying a 
 scene more appropriate to a cellar in St. 
 Giles's than the hall of a splendid resi- 
 dence in Portman Square. 
 
 On two chairs lay extended in drowsi- 
 ness and filth, a fellow of coarse and 
 severe aspect ; while another with dark 
 austere visage and folded arms, w^alked 
 about the hall, as bearing authority ; his 
 unmoved hat nearly hid his scowling 
 brows, and as the horror-struck Fitz Or-

 Such was the letter Rupert Butler had 
 conveyed to Portman-square, but, as it un- 
 fortunately happened to be sent a very 
 few days after Miss De Dunstanville was 
 driven from her home, it yet remains to 
 be known whether it was lost amidst the 
 sad confusion which prevailed in that 
 mansion, or like many others, was sup- 
 pressed for dark and secret purposes, by 
 the emissaries v/ho were ordered to be 
 perpetually on the watch, to intercept all 
 letters and messages, and carefully to 
 enquire the business of any strangers who 
 might call ; and by these precautionary

 orders, the letter never reached a mother 
 whose hours were wasting in aching ap-, 
 prehensions for the uncertain fate of a 
 beloved son. 
 
 Poor Rupert's last hope had now proved 
 abortive, and he viewed the fevered cheek 
 and languid eye of his friend with a sigh 
 of bitterness ; he beheld him in the bloom 
 of youth, withering beneath the blights 
 of poverty and self-neglect. Every en- 
 quiry for Mrs. Moreland, proved ineffec- 
 tual, and he felt that it was only a mother 
 that could alleviate Dillon's condition. 
 
 Strange arraigning thoughts rushed 
 through the mind of Rupert, and his lip 
 offered comfort which he himself could not 
 taste ; his brain engendered notions, dark, 
 confused, distracted, and linconsoling; yet,

 It was during one of Dillon's chilling fits 
 when his eye looked reproach, which his 
 tongue did not utter, and when the wither-

 strength, communicated to affrighted con-

 in deepening penitence, formed a resolu-

 Dillon had been rather better that morn-

 When she quitted the prison, it was her 
 resolution to seek the commiserating bosom

 Dinah was with Miss De Dunstanville. 
 She had always been her favourite, and 
 her she first sought ; the savages of the 
 hall had turned her from the door with 
 gross and vulgar abuse, and her trembling 
 steps were taking another direction, when 
 Providence kindly sent her sister's arms 
 for her refuge.

 death, and it was her prayer to have both

 " Whom did you name ?" hastily, and

 " Oh, fearful ! fearful !" cried Patty, a

 agitated ; " Where is she ? where am I? 
 Am I so near her ? Is she so near me ? So 
 near ! so near '*

 one entering, " and — but do not, do not

 abstraction ; the sisters assisted her to lay 
 down on the bed, and she was left alone. 
 
 Patty thought not now of repose ; her 
 brain was beating, every throbbing pulse 
 was aching, and all within was wild com- 
 motion ; she started from the bed, and 
 fell on her knees, respired some prayer, 
 but uttered nothing ; she held a book she 
 had been reading ; it was *' Addison's Evi- 
 dence of Christianity/' " I will not part 
 with this ;" — but Patty, while the fashion, 
 had been fashionable; no pocket was ready; 
 pressing it, therefore, to her lips, as a 
 sudden hope gave momentary^ wartnth to 
 her heart, with uplifted eyes, she spread 
 it open on her bosom, and covered it 
 with her shawl.

 opportune for the wild purpose, Patty's 
 weakness was forgotten ; apprehension 
 supplied ihe place of strength, and, with a 
 step light and swift as the nimble foot of 
 health, she darted down stairs, quietly un- 
 closed the door, and rushed with wildness 
 through the streets. 
 
 Dillon Moreland had been so interested 
 with the beautiful simpHcity of the poem 
 he had been reading, that the gloom of 
 evening set in around him, before he began 
 to think of his poor companion's unusual 
 .absence ; but, when he did think, horrors 
 came with the thought. Alarm for her 
 safety, and torture, lest his distresses, 
 wants, and unkindnesses, should have 
 hurried her into deeper and darker enor- 
 mity, struck his bosom with a new pang ; 
 she had been the unrepining companion of 
 rhis wretched hours j the meek, obedient

 servant of his wishes, and she had inspired 
 a sentiment, which, though neither par- 
 taking of the hallowed purity of love, nor 
 the dignity of esteem, the vicious never 
 felt it, and the virtuous need not to have 
 disclaimed it. Sorrow had rendered it a 
 chastened feeling, and in Dillon's milder 
 reflective moments, it was a wish to reward 
 Patty, by enabling her to retire from the 
 scorning looks of the severe and untried 
 virtuous, and pass a life of innocence in 
 some society that could appreciate the 
 virtues of her nature, and drop an obli- 
 viating veil over her early errors. 
 
 She had now become so necessary to 
 Dillon's convenience, and even to his sight, 
 that when the evening altogether closed, 
 and the doors for the night were shut, 
 and when he heard the wind blow in 
 gusts, and the rain falling in torrents, his

 mind became a chaos of maddening ideas. 
 The tempest, if exposed to its beating 
 fury, would shiver her poor wasted frame 
 to nothing ; and yet, terrible as was that 
 thought, it was exceeded by a complicated 
 fear, that she might have taken refuge in 
 haunts of deeper impurit)^. 
 
 The doors were closed, she could not 
 gain admission even if she came, and" 
 Dillon, in agony, threw himself on the 
 bare ground, and when his natural impe- 
 tuosity had exhausted itself, without tak- 
 ing the refreshment which even his hum- 
 ble pallet would have afforded, in starting 
 and uneasy slumbers, he wore away the 
 feverish night, and rising with the break 
 of day, a cold, solitary, cheerless apart- 
 ment did not contribute to elevate his de- 
 pressed spirits, or compose his agitated 
 feelings.

 The hearts which have throbbed with 
 the anguish of uncertainty, which have en» 
 dured ihe suspensive pang, may judge how 
 Dillon passed the day ; apprehension almost 
 heightened to frenzy ; and perhaps in the 
 hours of hilarity and happiness, he never 
 experienced a more exquisite start of plea- 
 sure, than when the poor trembling worn- 
 out creature, broke upon his sight. 
 
 A sensation of delight to which he had 
 long been a stranger, darted through his 
 frame, and shone in his languid eyes, and as 
 she appeared, he flew to meet her. 
 
 " My poor trembling truant," he 
 cried, taking the shivering penitent in his 
 arms — '' where have you been wandering ? 
 
 why so agitated ? you have not " and 
 
 the honourable soul of Dillon shuddered 
 from the horrid thought that crossed his 
 brain. " Patty where have you been ? yoii

 would not drive me down perdition's most 
 
 d d. precipice girl girl- 
 
 where have you been ?" 
 
 And Dillon looked fearful, in his fear 
 '' want is bitter, but abject pollution, Patty 
 do you understand ?" 
 
 Full well did Patty understand the im- 
 plication ; it was torture, yet she smiled, 
 and the smile would have looked lovely, 
 even on the lip of purity, for it arose from 
 the thought of her last innocent night, 
 and the innocent beings who watched her 
 during that night. 
 
 The hectic flush rekindled in her ashy 
 cheek, and in the moment she felt superior 
 to guilt as she replied — " I deserve such 
 fears ; I am a sinner, but Dillon, my last 
 night was pure and peaceful !" — She took

 his trembling hand, and pressed it to her 
 own burning brow, then to her beating 
 bosom. 
 
 " No sin, Dillon, no sin could come 
 where I was j your mother reposed be- 
 neath the same roof; for one whole night, 
 even. I found refuge within the holy sphere 
 of her virtue." 
 
 " My mother — my mother!" he re- 
 peated, and involuntarily he dropt the hand 
 he had held, " I remember my mother." 
 Dillon did remember her, and remorse, 
 and grief, and shame, all blended with the 
 remembrance, and his proud heart felt 
 bursting, 
 
 " Did you hear her speak, did you see 
 
 her, Patty ?" And as he spoke he spread his 
 
 hand over his face to hide the gushing tears.

 you will be happy yet — happy if Dillon 
 can make you so." 
 
 Patty did look pale indeed, every fea- 
 ture was more wan than before ; she grew 
 very sick ; a misty darkness seemed dim- 
 ming her sight, and a faintness was at 
 her heart. 
 
 The affrighted Dillon supported her in 
 his arms ; he laid his hand upon her 
 bosom ; her heart beat low and languid ; 
 she leaned her sinking head back on his 
 neck, one weak convulsive groan was 
 heard ; he clasped her still closer, he felt 
 the cold pressure of her fingers giving 
 way ; she raised one ashy wasted hand to 
 pray, to pray for Dillon, but the voice 
 was hushed, the last commotion over, 
 and Patty's penitent soul was among 
 angels.

 Dillon continued to ck ,o the poor in- 
 conscious thing in his i^ms ; every cold 
 or unkind word he had ever dealt her, 
 rose on memory with torture, and gave 
 the dark stab of remorse/ the unavailing 
 pang of what, could never be recalled. 
 The angry feelings, the stormy passions, 
 they all sunk to rest, only the achin^s of 
 memory remained feeding the spark of 
 inextinguishable regret. 
 
 The door of Dillon's chamber was sud- 
 denly burst open ; he started, looked up, 
 and by the gleamin.^ embers of the fire, 
 which threw a shadowy light over the 
 room, Dillon beheld his mother. 
 
 A confusion of thought, a tumult of 
 feehngs, all wild and tender, overwhelmed 
 him ; his poor burden dropped froai his 
 nerveless arms, he sunk on his knees, 
 and received from his mother's softened

 Fatty had prayed, and from her lips that 
 pardoning blessing, which she herself had 
 gone to God to obtain. 
 
 Dinah had made terrible confusion at 
 Miss De Dunstanviile's tea table ; the ladies 
 were both readin a:, and ordered her to make 
 the tea ; but her thoughts were absent ; 
 her heart with the dying Patty ; she 
 poured the cream into the sugar, and the 
 water over the toast j and to complete her 
 blunders, in handing a cup of coffee to 
 Mrs. Moreland, she let it fall into her 
 lap. 
 
 Jane started up, " What bewilders you, 
 Dinah ? Are you asleep ?'' 
 
 Dinah's emotion had reached its climax, 
 she burst into tears, and falling on her 
 knees, cried, '' Forgive me! forgive me! 
 my sister — my sister Patty ! oh, madam,"

 " Oh God, speak! What of Dillon

 Dinah was still on her knees, she spread

 to hide the burning blush of shame which 
 the vice of another raised in the pure cheek 
 of virtue, as she cried, " my poor dying 
 sister has lived with Mr. Dillon More-

 The rest m?y be imagined ; Mrs. More-, 
 land flew as fast as Patty had done ; they 
 v/ho met her in the street retreated, they 
 thought her some poor maniac escaped 
 from her keepers, and in less than an hour 
 the almost frantic mother beheld her first- 
 born darling. 
 
 His hair was neglected, his dress in 
 disorder, and his cheeks and lips like ashes ; 
 his eyes once so serenely bright in hap- 
 piness, were gloomy and sunken ; he look- 
 ed the wan image of wasting despair; he was 
 still clasping the body of the poor dead 
 Patty, and as his mother's pale figure 
 broke on his tortured sight, his burden 
 dropt from his arms, he dropt on his knees, 
 and the mother, and the son, were biess^

 had, indeed, reclined, but where it rested 
 not, for it was the sinner's bed, and rest- 
 less. 
 
 Dillon, with slow and fearful steps 
 drew near the body ; he even bent a knee, 
 and raised the ashy stiffened hand to his 
 lips. 
 
 Ah ! what thoughts were then his ! he 
 laid his own hand on her cold and throb- 
 less heart ; " thy latest, warmest pulses 
 beat for me, thou poor destroyed one ; 
 they beat for me."

 He pressed the book to Patty's lips, 
 then to his own, and then placed it within 
 his bosom, bent himself over the body, 
 as if taking leave, a long and lasting leave, 
 and then turned to his mother j he looked 
 no more.

 was removed, an^d the rites of sepulture

 knowing she died penitent, and that the 
 world could inflict no more.

 career, he had allowed his expenses to 
 much exceed his income, he had ever 
 acted from momentary impulse — from the 
 feverish feeling as it arose 5 his deeds,

 therefore, never improved on reflection, 
 but he had to lament as much what he 
 had done^ as that which he had left un- 
 done. 
 
 Dillon's mother was now poor and dis- 
 tressed ; she could not liberate, she could 
 not relieve her darling ; and the generous 
 Jane, Vv^hile weeping on her friend's bo- 
 som, would cry, "

 Still much was effected for Billon's 
 comfort ; to change the scene, his mother

 to that in which he had seen ' poor Patty

 mother had a powerful balm for the

 his moments of suffering with every deli-

 Dillon did not feel miserable. The mis- 
 anthropy with which distress had been 
 encrusting his heart was wearing ofF, and 
 the more kindly feelings shed their genial 
 warmth through his bosom j his mind 
 became more tranquil, his temper more 
 moderate, and his passions more control- 
 lable ; he could listen to counsel, and was 
 calm even under restraint ; and Jane De 
 Dunstanville, who had an elegant taste for 
 poetry, often made him forget he was in 
 prison, by the interesting sweetness of her 
 muse. And one morning that a heavy 
 rain ir-sde all appear g]o:)my5 Jane, Al- 
 fred, and Dillon, produced the following 
 poetry ; Mrs. Moreland promising to be 
 an unbiassed and impartial umpire, as to 
 its separate claims for the mxeed of praise. 
 In the warm and grateful bosom of Dillon 
 Moreland, there still lingered a sentiment.

 which, though humanity would have 
 blushed not to feel^ the spirit of rectitude 
 would have blushed deeper to avow in the 
 chaste presence of modesty. Dillon's soul 
 often gave a sigh to poor Patty's memory, 
 yet never did that sigh pass his lips with- 
 out feeling it a tacit reproach to tha re- 
 membrance of the noble Ellen, and her 
 nobler virtues. And these divided thoughts 
 were full in his mind, when Jane, to be

 being busy, and Dillon produced the fol- 
 lowing lines :

 Ai>FRED had discovered that several of 
 the actions on which Dillon was confined, 
 were usurious j and not doubting, from 
 opinions he had received, that they might 
 be set aside, Dillon began to welcome 
 the hope of returning liberty ; and, could 
 he have forgotten one dead, and could he 
 have hoped he w^as remembered by one 
 living, Dillon would have admitted the 
 anticipations of happiness. 
 
 One day, that the weather pr'oved very 
 bleak and stormy, and that the evening 
 closed with a very heavy rain, Mrs. 
 Moreland dispatched Dinah with a note 
 to Dillon j pleading; the v/etness of the 
 nighi for not ^eelng him ; yet, promising 
 that she and Miss De "Dunstanville, would

 pass the following day with him, when 
 she hoped the result of his brother's en- 
 quiries and exertions, would throw a ray 
 of cheerfulness over their frugal fare^ 
 and give earnest of happier hours. 
 
 The ladies then unfashionably seated 
 themselves with the little girls at the tea- 
 table, and, strange and gothic as it may 
 sound on the modern ear of a fine lady, 
 enjoyed the simple repast without one 
 breath either of scandal or ill-nature, giv- 
 ing a zest to the beverage. 
 
 At the plebeian hour of eight, the little 
 circle read prayers, and Mrs. Moreland, 
 in the absence of Dinah, having put Lily 
 and Belle to bed, quietly seated herself to 
 work ; while Jane, whose taste in music 
 was exquisite, amused herself in melo- 
 dizing some beautifully plaintive lines, 
 written by the late Burns.

 Jane had very early imbibed a taste for 
 the Scottish music ; her grandfather had 
 been an enthusiast in his passion for it, 
 and she had caught a spark which brigh* 
 tened in her bosom as she grew, and 
 though she excelled in all, both on the 
 forte piano and harp, when her soft clear 
 tones warbled the old airs of Caledonia,, 
 every ear was enraptured. 
 
 Burns w^as Jane's favourite among the 
 Scottish bards ; the hnes before her had 
 never been in print, for they were ad- 
 dressed to his wife a few hours before he 
 died, and found among his papers long 
 after his decease. 
 
 She had ^arranged it for the piano, and 
 its soft harmony reaching the heart of 
 Mrs. Moreland, she intreated her to 
 soothe the sweet melancholy she had in- 
 spired, and sing the whole as she had set 
 it^ in its original impressive words.

 " Your Scottish ear, like mine, can

 communicate its simple beauties to t?ie

 Scottish harmony.'^

 Jane's muse offered its tribute to the 
 lines in the following verse.

 'Twas the expiring ray to genius given 3 
 
 The tuneful nine could not a wreathe refuse.

 At Mrs. Mor eland's request she repeat- 
 ed her song, and the last soft cadence of 
 her sweet voice was lingering on her lip, 
 when Mrs. Norman very unceremoniously 
 announced a gentleman. 
 
 Strangers were most irksome to Jane, 
 and she had of late been so beset, and 
 annoyed by so many men of the law, 
 that she almost shrunk from the human 
 form in masculine attire; but this gentle- 
 man would not be refused admission to 
 ' her presence, and he stood before her. 
 
 Mrs. Moreland had neither knowledge 
 nor recollection of him ; Jane dropt the 
 music from her hand, and uttered an 
 involuntary shriek — staggered and sunk 
 into a chair.




 
 CHAPTER L 
 
 The watchmen were loudly calling, " past 
 eleven o'clock and a rainy night," as a 
 travelling chariot drove furiously up to 
 Fladdong's Hotel, when a gentleman alight- 
 ing, impatiently ordered a messenger might 
 instantly attend to carry a letter to Port- 
 man Square. 
 
 The carriage had travelled post from 
 Holyhead j the gentleman appeared fatigued 
 and agitated, and a trepidation of nerves 
 shook his fingers while writing. Once or

 twice he paused, as if irresolute, but again 
 he went on. 
 
 " Who waits ?" he cried, sealing a 
 hastily- written letter. 
 
 The waiter advanced a step, and 
 bowed. 
 
 " You will take this instantly to Miss 
 De Dunstanville, in Portman Square ; be 
 quick as possible, and wait an answer." 
 
 * c The Lady is not there now, Sir, 
 the more's the pity ;" said the poor 
 fellow, hanging his head. 
 
 " Not there !" repeated the gentleman, 
 u what do you mean ? Is the lady gone to 
 the Abbey ?" 
 
 " No, Sir, the Abbey is gone from her, 
 and every thing else."

 *' And I, Sir, mean Miss De Dunstan- 
 ville ; I was her under butler," 
 
 The stranger arose from his seat, and 
 gazed in the man's face, as if to penetrate 
 his meaning — only an expression of artless 
 sorrow appeared there. 
 
 u Good fellow explain yourself better ; 
 what mystery lurks beneath your words ? 
 where is Miss DeDunstanville?" 
 
 " Sir, she was the sweetest, and most 
 generous, and easiest Lady a servant ever 
 had ; and there was not a dry eye in the 
 hall, nor in the house, when Lawyer 
 Flarehomme and the bum-bail'uTs seized 
 every thing, like sharks as they are; and 
 turned the dear lady and all of us out, and 
 would not let her take, no not her own 
 grandfather's picture, and then she did 
 cry, and we all cried for her, though we 
 had enough to cry for our ownseives."

 " Flarehomme, Flarehomme 1" repeated 
 the gentleman, bewildered in a painful con- 
 fusion of strange conjectures, " who is 
 Flarehomme ?" 
 
 " One of the blackest and biggest of 
 the deviFs whole nursery, Sir, begging 
 your honor's pardon for swearing, but a 
 nephew of the late Sir Geoffry's, an own 
 nephew, he is the main spring that sets the 
 wheels of mischief going," 
 
 " Nephew !" cried the traveller starting 
 aghast, and wringing the waiter s hands in 
 agony, " Nephew I" 
 
 His lips looked bloodless, his cheeks 
 white as. the sheeted spectre, and his dark 
 eye rolled with the tumult of burning 
 thought. " Father !"he respired — his tones 
 were deep, — " father, if thy cup of boiling 
 wrath have yet this dreg to pour upon me, 
 spare my heart, and hurl the bolt of death

 will bear a weaned spirit to thyself, but to 
 know — Oh, perdition, that were thy gulph, 
 thy deepest gulph." 
 
 The affrighted waiter retreated ; he 
 pitied him, but thinking him seized with 
 sudden frenzy, would have hastened from 
 the room, when in a voice more sad than 
 violent, he bade him " stay." 
 
 u Do not leave me," said he, " kind 
 fellow," and his look grew beseeching, as 
 he spoke, " do not leave me, do not fear 
 me, I will not harm a single hair, only 
 say that a nephew has not wronged your 
 mistress, and my soul will bless you/' 
 
 The poor fellow had some soft particles 
 about his heart, that would have led him 
 to unsay all he had said, rather than inflict 
 what he had seen him suffer, he, therefore, 
 eagerly replied,

 strong emotion of a busy spirit was mov- 
 ing his lips, yet nothing was heard. 
 
 The waiter gazed upon his kneeling 
 figure, with reverence and awe ; the sensa- 
 tion was no longer blended with fear, for 
 a pleased innate serenity diffused itself 
 through the whole benign countenance, 
 and when the eye again returned to mortal 
 objects, its beam was kind and encourag- 
 ing ; he took the fellow's hand. 
 
 " I am your friend, young man," said 
 he, and his looks gave a stronger assurance 
 even than his lips — " have no fears, my 
 senses are my own ; you have served me, 
 pleased me, and for pleasure I will give 
 pleasure, for service render service, it is 
 my way, and if you think beizig about my

 accepted. Philip, the butler, knew his 
 own interest, and this stroke of fortune 
 being a preferment as unexpected as he 
 considered it undeserved, in the grati- 
 tude of an honest heart, he vowed fide- 
 lity and attachment to his new master ; 
 who, after a night not altogether unper- 
 turbed, but which still had its anticipa- 
 tions of knowing and contributing to 
 happier hours, he was sent forth with 
 orders to spare neither exertion nor ex- 
 pense in discovering the residence of 
 Miss De Dunstanville. 
 
 Philip was indefatigable in his enqui- 
 ries, and at length recollecting an old 
 boon companion among the footmen at 
 Lady Clancarron's ; who, as he told his 
 present master, had let him into a rig or 
 two, thither he hastened, and pretending

 James. 
 
 Fortunately the fellow was at home, 
 and as fortunately, he happened to be 
 one of the footmen in attendance the day 
 her ladyship had paid her last condescend- 
 ing visit to the heiress in her humble 
 residence at Mrs. Norman's. From him, 
 therefore, Philip received every informa- 
 tion he desired ; and, well satisfied with 
 his success, returned to his anxious and 
 expecting master, whose impatience brook- 
 ing no delay, he hastened instantly to 
 Mrs. Norman's, when, perceiving there 
 was some difficulty of admission, without 
 ceremony he rushed past the poor 
 alarmed landlady, saying, " Announce

 Jane's sensation on the entrance of the 
 unintroduced travellerwas complicated, yet 
 delightful, for she knew him, she beheld

 manner assured him, she was, indeed 
 pleased to see him again. 
 
 He held her in his trembling arms, and 
 while the bio; tears roiled down his vener-

 " Where, "where do I find thee, thou

 thou wronged angel ! and my wants, my 
 miseries, they too, added to the heap of 
 thy calamities, helped to impoverish thee ; 
 and, perhaps, the retrospect gave an ach- 
 ing pang to thy innocent thoughts." 
 
 " Oh, no !" she interrupted, her soul's 
 feelings on her lip ; " no indeed ! when I 
 thought of you, my venerable friend, and the 
 little I did for you, I felt it like an expiat- 
 ing deed, redeeming my many follies j

 know not why, warmed my heart, when 
 fearful apprehensions have been chilling it ; 
 and when lonely bitter tears were wasting 
 me away, the thought of that dear mo- 
 ment passed between us, with a sacred 
 and assuasive charm, restrained them, and 
 my cheeks would flush with a momentary

 glow of some innate and indefineable plea- 
 sure, and now that my feverish dream 
 of greatness is over, your remembrance 
 of that one deed of feeling will give me a 
 friend for my reward ; and that explains 
 the anticipated feeling." 
 
 " Your friend !" my child, he cried gaz- 
 ing on her with tender emotion — "call me 
 father ! a fair angel like thee, once blessed 
 
 me but,— " he covered his eyes with 
 
 his hands, — " no more — no more of that, 
 she is gone — and thou, sweet cherub, shall 
 have her place." 
 
 He paused a few moments and then re- 
 sumed. 
 
 " I am rich, my child, very rich, and 
 to you I owe these riches ; your genero- 
 sity, your confidence, enabled me to take 
 steps which intimidated guilt, and led to 
 the recovery of my rights, from those

 "for one Hildebrandc Fi:z Ormond; I know 
 your history, open your heart, your soul,

 "Fitz Ormond!" she repeated in com- 
 plicated emotion, and bursting into an 
 agony of tears, " Fitz Ormond, oh ! where 
 art thou, why hide from me, from Jane, 
 from her, who would perish with thee, 
 or perish for thee !" 
 
 Mrs. Moreland drew near, and to inter- 
 rupt her grief, requested an introduction

 to her friend. Jane's look asked the stran- 
 ger's name. 
 
 " Call me Alvanley," said he ; " but think 
 me your friend, feel me your father." 
 
 The rest of the evening was passed in 
 mutual and endearing communications, 
 and explanations, which rendered the par- 
 ties as perfectly acquainted with each other 3 
 as if the inmates of many years. 
 
 Mr. Alvanley confessed, that when he 
 demanded so large a sum as five thousand 
 pounds, from Jane, that his sole hope at 
 success had rested on the character he had 
 heard of her candour, artlessness, and ge- 
 nerosity ; and that when he perceived her 
 discretion began to operate, and she seem- 
 ed to waver, he had thrown out ambigu- 
 ous hints of Fitz Ormond being some 
 way interested or connected, to fix her to 
 his point.

 efforts to recover my rights failed, none 
 would ever more have heard that I existed, 
 that predetermination shrouded me in such 
 mystery; now I live but to make you hap- 
 py, and to make all you love happy." 
 
 Jane in perspective, could now again 
 behold herself great and wealthy ; in a 
 high condition she had never been haugh- 
 ty, in a depressed condition she had al- 
 ways been dignified ; and her pious soul 
 now adored the wonder-working hand of 
 Heaven, which had so graciously raised 
 her a friend in the day of dark affliction, 
 that with energy and inclination, had the 
 support of ample wealth to see her re-insta- 
 ted in her rights, or if not legally her's, 
 could still enrich her with all the luxuries 
 and blessings of a splendid fortune.

 Late in the evening Alfred called j he 
 was d ispirited about his brother j some 
 were out of town, money was wanted to 
 prosecute the actions, which were usuri-

 devilism, as his brother would have called

 her brilliant intelligence, and being intro-

 ed her with another thousand, saying, 
 " Jane's friend had part of his heart, and 
 that pride, punctilio, and reserve were 
 deadly sins in his system of friendship." 
 
 It has always been allowed that London 
 was the best place for those who had a 
 great deal of money, for those who 
 wished to make a great deal of money, 
 and likewise for those who have little or 
 no money at all; the first position was 
 amply demonstrated, for before the next 
 evening closed ; Jane once more presided 
 in a splendid establishment in Upper 
 Grosvenor Street. All had been so rapid, 
 that it appeared to her like enchantment, 
 and as Mr. Alvanley never seemed* nor 
 indeed felt so happy as when promoting 
 her comfort, or contributing to her in- 
 dulgences, all had moved like magic, 
 till again she appeared the lady of the* 
 mansion.

 Alfred had been no niggard of his 
 happy intelligence, for in a note to his 
 brother he communicated the whole, de- 
 scribing with a glowing pencil, the agree- 
 able alteration in Miss De Dunstanville's 
 condition, and, consequently, their mo- 
 ther's, and concluded by desiring him to 
 be ready to quit his residence in the even- 
 ing, when it was designed the whole party 
 should come to escort him from the abodes 
 of penury, to those of peace and pleasure. 
 
 As Dillon perused his brother's happy, 
 incoherent note, his heart ever attuned 
 to pleasure, now vibrated to the magic 
 touch of sudden hope. The past, the 
 present, the future, all arose on memory, 
 and in a delightful hurry of thought, and 
 the happiest harmony of expectation, 
 Ellen, the chaste, lovely Ellen, broke upon 
 imagination like a star bursting from a 
 stormy and gloomy sky.

 His mother, and his friends, they came 
 not, why did they tarry ? Dillon knew 
 not, feared not, and in the sweet suspen- 
 sive interval between him and a beautiful 
 moment 5 he pencilled the following lines, 
 which his heart dedicated to Ellen Stir* 
 ling.

 And each remembered p2ng endear d

 And yet some evil may portend, 
 
 But ere it comes why fear it ? 
 The less io sorrow's load we bend, 
 
 The better we shall bear it." 
 
 The evening was far advanced when 
 Mr. Alvanley, accompanied by Mrs. More- 
 land and Miss De Dunstanville, v, ho was 
 ever forward on errands of beneficence, 
 arrived at the wretched apartment of 
 Dillon ; they found him ready dressed, 
 and every feature animated with the glow 
 of anticipated freedom. 
 
 With his usual elegant complacency' of 
 manner, lie offered appropriate compli- 
 ments to Mr. Alvanley, on his condes- 
 cension and benevolence. 
 
 Mr. Alvanley whispered to Jane, he 
 had never beheld a more prepossessing 
 young man, adding, with a faint smile, 
 " Fitz Ormomi must soon burst from his' 
 cloud, else Lady Ellen might wear a willow,

 low/ " 
 
 All were now becoming impatient to 
 leave the place, but still no Alfred appear- 
 ed, who, during his leisure hours, had 
 been running from lawyer to lawyer for 
 their different discharges ; it was now 
 near ten o'clock, the doors would close, and 
 Dillon another night might be a prisoner ; 
 some strange apprehensive thought swelled 
 the mother's anxious bosom, it gave pale 
 omen to her cheek, and though her heart 
 palpitated, she sat silent and calm. 
 
 Mr. Alvanley perceived the sombre shade 
 stealing over the whole party, and to dis- 
 perse the gloom, jestingly declared, if 
 Alfred did not soon appear, it should be a 
 merry making to the whole inhabitants 
 in Durance vile ; it had been his intention,

 and he now ordered a substantial supper 
 to the poorer of the unfortunates. 
 
 A person instantly appeared and receiv- 
 ed his commands, and he gave the upper 
 turn -key fifty pounds for bread, meat, 
 and beer, for those who would accept the 
 fare, and extending his liberality, he de- 
 sired a list of the most distressed among 
 the superior prisoners, whom it was his 
 intention to liberate. The turn-key then 
 departed to communicate the glad tidings, 
 and Dillon coming forward, said he had 
 reason to believe, from the report of a 
 woman who attended the rooms, that a 
 poor aged being was dying, and literally 
 for want, in the adjoining apartment. 
 
 " I have listened," said Dillon, at dif- 
 ferent times, " to his moan ; I could not 
 distinguish his words, but his sounds are 
 sad and full of sorrow, and the old

 me he never looks up, and has taken 
 nothing these two days but water/* 
 
 " God of heaven !" exclaimed Mr. 
 Alvanley, " the pangs of hunger to be 
 endured in a land of plenty, in a land of 
 Christians ! Poor man ! Live but a little 
 longer, and all your wants shall be re- 
 lieved -, your age shall be supported, and 
 you shall have cause to bless our visit to a 
 prison." 
 
 " Hark !" interrupted Dillon, " I now 
 -hear the murmur of his voice." 
 
 Some laths fastened together formed a 
 partition ; it was all that divided the room 
 from the sufferer. 
 
 Determined to save him, Mr. Alvanley 
 listened ; Mrs. Moreland dropped a tear, 
 a pitying tear to human calamity, while 
 Jane's gentle heart throbbing with a sensa-

 tlon far remote from rude curiosity, 
 looked through a small aperture made by 
 a broken lath. 
 
 All was still ; hushed as the dumb lip 
 of death, all was fearfully still ; the lowest 
 breath could have broken on the watchful

 CHAPTER III. 
 
 Enfeebled by pernicious drugs, and debi- 
 litated by lingering delirium, Fitz Or- 
 mond's spirits had easily yielded to the rude 
 attack made on him in the hall of Miss 
 De Dunstanville. The myrmidons of jus- 
 tice had seized him, and, inconscious of 
 offence, the poor victim struggled, resist- 
 ed, and was knocked down. His feelings 
 had approached to frenzy, and he was now 
 a prisoner. 
 
 " A rescue! a rescue!" resounded 
 through the hall, and mingling with the 
 groans of anguish, and the cry of despair 
 gathered a crowd about the door, when the

 bailiffs, well knowing the detestation and 
 dread their characters inspire in every bo- 
 som, to secure their captive, and prevent 
 the indignation of the mob, a coach was 
 called, when , totally insensible to all that was 
 passing, poor Fitz Ormond was conveyed 
 to one of those receptacles of human 
 .misery, denominated a spunging house, 
 and on the writ being returnable, in the 
 stillness of a deep and calm despair, lost 
 to hope, to himself, and to the world, he 
 was removed to the gloomy confines of an 
 upper chamber in a prison, at the suit "of 
 his coachmaker, and at the instigation of 
 his generous friends and relations, Lord 
 and Lady Clancarron, whose plans and 
 purposes it suited that he should be out 
 of the way, and if out of the world, tani

 to do in a sphere of fashion, where the

 voice of one was never heard, and the pale 
 front of the other never seen. 
 
 Fitz Ormond's feelings were alive to all 
 the horrors of his condition ; he was 
 undone himself, the worshipped Mary, and 
 all her chaste innocent hopes, all were un- 
 done ; to all the nobler purposes of human 
 existence, he was lost ; even the generous 
 Jane, to whom he owed all the early bles- 
 sings of an honourable mind and culti- 
 vated understanding ; she who would have 
 secured his felicity by blending it with her 
 own, in her moments of oppression and 
 sorrow, what must be her reflections, her 
 opinions, that he did not appear, and take 
 an active part — assist in procuring her 
 justice, and endeavour to restore her to 
 her rights. 
 
 This idea seemed to communicate new 
 energy to Fitz Ormond's mind, quickened

 which self could not have effected, and in 
 revolving various ways to accomplish a pur- 
 pose, which he felt as his last and only incite- 
 ment to live, his generous friend, Murray, 
 occurred to his memory ; and, proud and 
 independent as was Fitz Ormond's soul, 
 it felt neither humbled nor degraded in 
 delineating to this estimable being, the 
 deception which had been practised on him, 
 nor yet his own progressive follies, which 
 had reduced him to penury and a prison ; 
 he also hinted Lord Clancarron's conduct 
 respecting the two thousand pounds, re- 
 quested his advice on the subject, and the 
 loan of three hundred pounds, which 
 would liquidate the debt for which he 
 was confined, and supply his necessities 
 till something offered for the reputable 
 support of his existence.

 He had dispatched his letter by a mes- 
 senger, one of the prisoners had procured, 
 and to wear away the lingering hours till 
 his return, Fitz Ormond's wild and gloomy 
 muse produced the irregular lines here 
 presented for the reader's perusal.

 Of happiness.

 Or can it sigh that days are gone,

 That rays which never brightly shone, 
 
 All all have disappeared ? 
 But ah ! for youthful heart to know, 
 The stream of time shall vainly flow, 
 And not adown its ceaseless tide, 
 One joy through life, to glad its course shall glide;

 So reft of every cheering ray.

 Fitz Ormond had written and even 
 read till weary and exhausted, and still 
 his messenger had not returned ; and he 
 was resigning to pass a suspensive night ; 
 when with much apparent fatigue, the 
 man entered his chamber. 
 
 Alas ! poor Fitz Ormond, thy darker 
 star in this hour reigned lord of the 
 ascendant ; his last dollar had been given 
 to this messenger for going to Clapham, 
 for previous payment was demanded. Fitz 
 Ormond's nature was a stranger to the 
 meannesses and petty pilferings which 
 the miseries of a gaol generate in low 
 minds ; else he would have better known 
 his messenger ; and positively refused pay- 
 ment, until he either had brought an 
 answer, or produced some proof that an 
 answer was refused. 
 
 The letter most assuredly did go out of

 the prison, as surely as it did go into 
 the fire of the nearest pot house ; and there 
 the dollar was exchanged for that lethean. 
 beverage which obliviates conscience, feel- 
 ing, and honesty. 
 
 The messenger solemnly declared that 
 he had waited several hours for the gen- 
 tleman coming home ; and then he sent 
 down word there was no answer. 
 
 " Could I have seen him, your honor, 
 I am main lucky, and a christian.- — " 
 
 Fitz Ormond stopt the christian's 
 tongue from further dishonouring the 
 christian's name. 
 
 " Enough," said he, " the tempest of 
 despairing thoughts gathering fast around 
 him ; go — you have done." The room 
 door closed, and Fitz Ormond had done- 
 with the human kind.

 flushings of indignant pride burned in his 
 cheeks, and angry fire glared in his aching 
 eyes, " yes, he thinks me a degraded object, 
 beneath- my former self, -beneath a very 
 worm, for it can crawl forth for food, and 
 never begs it from a brother reptile ; but 
 it is finished," said he, relapsing into 
 gloomy horror, " quite finished." 
 
 An unregarded day, and an unreposing 
 night, passed over his wretched head ; an 
 old woman lighted his fire, and timidly 
 asked him, what she could do for him ? 
 
 "Nothing!" was the answer ; her eye- 
 gleamed pityingly over an empty shelf. 
 
 " Bread, Sir, you want bread/ 9 
 
 Some aching chord of Fitz Ormonde 
 bursting heart was touched ;— he started 
 up — and his look ! — it was a look !

 famishing lips, she Josed the door, and he 
 was left alone. 
 
 The day drew towards its darkening 
 close -, he had neither spoken nor moved, 
 but he remained absorbed in that indescri- 
 bable calm which evinces some sad de- 
 terminate thought. 
 
 He took the picture of Mary Fortrose 
 from his bosom, and pressed it to his cold 
 quivering lips, restored it to its shelter, 
 and again would have taken it t)ut — yet 
 he did not, but burst into a strange and 
 fearful laugh. 
 
 The night had closed ; all was dark in 
 his chamber; Fitz Ormond had still some- 
 thing to do ; with a match from the dying 
 embers of his fire he lighted a candle, and

 he arranged that something, and then his 
 work was nearly finished. 
 
 Immersed in the depth of still, yet 
 dreadful meditation, he paced the room ; 
 inconscious, he knew not why, he looked 
 through the dull casement, a wild con- 
 fusion seemed to reign below, sounds of 
 distant merriment struck on his ear, but 
 all was uninteresting and unheeded ; 
 he looked up, the air was very dark, and 
 ts sullen chill was deadening every aching 
 sense ; the rain had fallen in torrents dur- 
 ing the day, but now had ceased, and only 
 some heavy lingering drops, fell from the 
 prison roof, and with sad and boding sound, 
 struck upon the wakeful ear ; the voice 
 of mourning and of murmur was still, 
 and it was the hour in which the eye of 
 common griefs ceased for awhile to weep. 
 The embers of his wasted fire were now

 was nearly sunk in its socket. 
 
 " It will soon be dark,'* said the poor 
 meditating suicide, "quite dark, and oh 1 
 the darkness no mortal hand can e'er re-

 An old tattered couch stood in a remote 
 corner of the desolate apartment ; it was, 
 covered with shreds of many colours, and 
 indeed betrayed a sad variety of wretch-

 Desperation strengthened his every 
 burning fibre ; it strung every swelling 
 nerve, and graspt with iron fangs his 
 very soul. 
 
 One deep groan escaped his ashy lip, 
 only one ; he took the pistol ; with an 
 unshaken hand he took it, and raised it 
 to his head. 
 
 He had cast up his heavy, beamless, sight-

 to shake it.

 CHAPTER IV, 
 
 The kind reader, if interested with our 
 tale, will, without much reluctance, re- 
 trace some of the earlier scenes in which 
 the existing characters are materially in- 
 volved. 
 
 In many of the vicissitudes which com- 
 pose the tissue of human life, we fre- 
 quently find a combination of circumstan- 
 ces all corroborating to justify the belief 
 of a person's death ; the consequences 
 have been various and multiplied ; some- 
 times ludicrous, sometimes melancholy,but 
 always productive of something rather 
 extraordinary.

 The life of Fitz OrmoncTs father, who, 
 during such a lapse of years, was believed 
 dead, shall now be rationally explained. 
 
 It may be remembered, by the reader, 
 that when the wounded Fitz Ormond was 
 dragged by savage hands from the feeble 
 support of poor Eglentine's arms, that she 
 beheld the body thrown over the ship's 
 side, as she supposed, into the ocean; but, 
 with the other wounded captives, he was 
 received into a waiting boat, and, with 
 them, conducted to a dreary prison in 
 France ; there he lingered for several 
 years ; alternately did the ragings of deli- 
 rium, and the wastings of pining melan- 
 choly, ravage his brain and heart ; his 
 wounds had not been mortal ; though dan- 
 gerous, they were cured, for mental ago- 
 nies rendered them unfelt.

 the notice, and engage the attention of a 
 nobleman, in the same prison, who had 
 been preserved under the cruel and bloody 
 reign of Robespierre, by personating a 
 domestic who nobly perished in his mas- 
 ter's preservation ; with this ci-devant no- 
 bleman he escaped from the fortress, and 
 embarking in a little open boat, was taken 
 up by a trading vessel bound to Pondi- 
 cherry, there poor Fitz Ormond fought in 
 the ranks — undistinguished and unknown 
 he fought ; his friend had fallen a victim to 
 the climate, without having discovered 
 who, or what he was, and again Fitz 
 Ormond was, or rather felt alone, on the 
 peopled earth. Illness again nearly reduced 
 him to the grave, but he was born to 
 suffer, and survived ; he was poor and 
 friendless — had no hand to raise him, no 
 heart to pity him ; his whole wealth con-

 sisted in a brilliant ring, which inclosed 
 his lost Eglantine's hair, and that had 
 been so curiously concealed in his gar- 
 ments, that it had escaped the notice of 
 liis merciless captors. 
 
 During his residence in that distant re- 
 gion, he became accidentally acquainted 
 with an English soldier, born on the do- 
 mains of De Dunstanville, and from him 
 he learnt, after minute enquiries, that his 
 Eglentine was no more, and that the amia- 
 ble Clancarron had married a wealthy 
 city heiress. 
 
 Britain had now no charm to attract 
 him ; he resolved to waste the remnant 
 •of his unjoyous days abroad, and let his 
 unhallowed dust rest in an obscure grave ; 
 and, probably, such would have been his 
 destiny, but that, in his intercourse with 
 men of various climates and characters, he

 became in some degree intimate with, and 
 rather attached to, a facetious and honest- 
 hearted Irishman, who, with the natural 
 love of relating marvellous stories of days 
 long gone by, detailed his and Eglentine's 
 history, as connected with Major M'Der- 
 mot and Sir Geoffry De Dunstanville's 
 family. 
 
 His wonderful relation had really very 
 little embellishment, and less addition than 
 wonderful relations generally have ; yet 
 it concluded with a wonder, that, with all 
 his indifference to sublunary enjoyments, 
 gave a new turn to his future intentions. 
 
 Young Fitz Ormond's father had been 
 the neglected descendant of a noble family, 
 and in early life he had served as an officer 
 under the command of Major M c Dermott ; 
 always overbearing in his temper, and 
 tyrannic in his manners, while in the West.

 Indies, his violence had one day provoked 
 him beyond human patience, and in the 
 indignation of the moment, regardless of 
 consequences; he drew his sword ; Major 
 M'Dermott was his superior, he left him no 
 alternative but a duel, or a court martial, 
 and by the high-spirited young man the 
 former was preferred. 
 
 The mother of Fitz Orrnond had fallen 
 an early victim to the climate j and Major 
 M'Dermott's rencontre with his father 
 made him altogether an orphan. 
 
 The victor was opulent and powerful ; 
 a military tribunal acquitted him, and his 
 victim continued unavenged, and unre- 
 membered, though not unlamented. His 
 poor unconscious smiling boy was in arms ; 
 he belonged to nobody, and nobody- 
 claimed him ; and whether from a sudden 
 impulse of generosity, or from some

 sensation like remorse, or to compromise 
 the matter with an uneasy conscience, was 
 never decided ; but he adopted the 
 orphan, spared neither care nor expense 
 on his education, and either from habit or 
 affection, he became necessary to his happi- 
 ness, and even his existence ; and it was 
 not till after the Major's tragical death, 
 that Fitz Ormond, on the examination of 
 some private papers, discovered who he 
 really was; for he had actually believed 
 himself the offspring of some illicit con- 
 nexion, and his patron, apprehensive of 
 weakening his own power, or shaking a 
 duty and obedience which he found so 
 delightful, had never once ventured to 
 speak of circumstances which had depriv- 
 ed him of a father, and most certainly, 
 but for the fatal events which have been 
 detailed, he would have been heir to the

 whole of Major M'Dermott's immense 
 property ; and, repugnant as the Irish were 
 to Sir Geoffry's feelings, far happier would 
 have been the meed of the gentle Eglentine, 
 had not her father erroneously believed 
 she had plighted her faith to the son of 
 her brother's murderer. 
 
 Honest Patrick O'Dvvyer continued to 
 tell his attentive auditor, " that when he 
 came from the beautiful county of Cork, 
 it was loud and far spoken of, as a burning 
 shame, that the living, or the dead, either 
 did not come and take his own, for now 
 that old Lord Fitz Ormond and his two 
 sons were both gone, why there was the.

 him when nobody wanted to keep him,

 for enough before the two that came after 
 him, of another and a younger brother 
 too." 
 
 Fitz Ormond had listened with wild 
 and strange, yet mute emotion ; and the 
 result was, he determined to revisit his 
 native land, seek the grave of his Eglen- 
 tine, and learn if she herself had become 
 the tomb of their infant, or how it died ; 
 for the soldier had assured him she left no 
 child ; yet it might live ; all was dubious 
 and uncertain. Fitz Ormond had now an 
 object and he would pursue it. 
 
 A considerable time elapsed before he 
 could accomplish his purposes ; his dis* 
 charge was difficult to obtain, he was as 
 before observed, destitute of money, and 
 without friends ; yet he persevered, and 
 at length having confided his history and 
 name to be one and the same that Patrick

 proud and pleased with his part in the 
 drama, assisted him with money, clothes, 
 and every necessary requisite for his 
 voyage *,. nay, so gratified was he with his 
 friend's perspective that he vowed to 
 scrape his all together and follow him to

 All was now prepared, Fitz Ormond 
 embarked with two hundred guineas in 
 his pocket, and an honest fellow his friend 
 had recommended to attend him, 
 
 Alas ! disaster was not yet weary of 
 pursuing poor Fitz Ormond ; he was pre- 
 doomed in every lane of life to meet with 
 disappointment. A violent tempest arose, 
 and drove the vessel nearly a wreck into 
 Madeira, and while she was repairing, he 
 was seized with a violent fever, attended 
 with delirium, which confined himsevera

 weeks, and during that season of distress 
 he was robbed. 
 
 An Italian who lodged in the same 
 hotel, and who represented himself as 
 being a merchant, taking advantage of the 
 indiscreet communications of Fitz Or- 
 mond's servant, who to procure his mas- 
 ter that respect and attention, he knew 
 money never failed to purchase, had told 
 the people in this Italian's hearing, that his 
 master (Mr. Alvanley, the name Mr. Fitz 
 Ormond had assumed,) had a great deal 
 of money and valuables, and one day that 
 tills poor simple fellow had gone up to 
 the mountains for some peculiarly fine 
 oranges, Signor Vallini found an oppor- 
 tunity to enter the chamber unobserved, 
 broke open the locks of Fitz Ormond's 
 writing desk, and not only robbed him 
 of the two hundred guineas, but a very

 superb watch, presented by the friendly 
 O'Dwyer, " as a keep sake" till they met 
 again in dear Cork ; but what was mere 
 precious still, to Fit z Ormond, and gave 
 an anguish surpassing the idea of all, who 
 have not hearts to treasure a long-loved 
 pledge of dear and early affection, he stole 
 the beloved ring, inclosing the hair of his

 Our i-ick traveller was not the only 
 victim of his dishonest practices, for under 
 various and specious pretexts in the cha- 
 racter of a merchant, he had imposed on 
 the credulity of several, and without 
 leaving a single clue for pursuit, or the 
 faintest hope of discovery, he had em- 
 barked unsuspected in a ship bound to 
 some foreign port, and when he achieved 
 his last exploit on poor Fitz Ormond's 
 property, the ship was actually under 
 weigh. 
 
 There was a dark expression of cun- 
 ning, a something that shunned the light 
 in himself, while he betrayed an obtrusive 
 desire to pry into the affairs of others, 
 which had guarded our assumed Mr. 
 Alvanley, from accepting the many over-

 him, to that predictive instinctive feeling 
 often sent to the heart, as a warning from 
 the approach of evil — but be that as it may, 
 the money was gone, and he reduced 
 to the lowest ebb of distress ; but he was

 determined to wait on the Commander 
 in Chief, whose character was humane 
 and benevolent, and communicate suffi- 
 cient of his history to answer his pur- 
 poses, when his intention was prevented 
 by the voluntary offer of assistance from 
 an officer, who had heard the story of the 
 robbery, and his consequent distress;

 was supplied, and again he embarked for 
 the shores of Britain. 
 
 Hardships, wants, long imprisonment, 
 and varied sufferings, with years exposure 
 to the fierce blaze of a torrid sun, had 
 effectually screened the countenance of 
 Fitz Ormond, from the recognition of any 
 eye that had ever seen him in the brilliant 
 glow, and towering grandeur of his 
 youth ; yet his figure retained a graceful 
 ease and dignity of manner, which the 
 storms of fortune could not alter ; and 
 his features a fine expression, which at 
 once struck the eye, and penetrated the 
 heart. 
 
 On his arrival in England, he travelled 
 on foot to -De Dunstanviile j and, as an 
 itinerant painter, taking views of the

 He discovered that a vague report of 
 his existence had reached the country y

 suborned to swear he was not the Hilde-

 adopted by Major Mc Dermott ; among 
 these were his foster father, and hb

 regiment to Ireland ; and from secret 
 motives of the Major's, had always lived 
 under his patronage.

 and no sooner did his cousin, the would-

 know he had a command of money, and, 
 that he had secured several principal wit-

 in England.

 The night, or rather the morning, he 
 assisted in rescuing Jane at Lord Berk-

 that Mr. Fitz Ormond was to be there ; the 
 father prevailed ; and to indulge the fond 
 emotions of aparent's pleading heart, he 
 hazarded the discovery his feelings might 
 have made, to steal one look of the be- 
 loved object ; for, through the means of 
 an Irish chairman at the hotel where he 
 put up, he was not only assured he was 
 to be there, but was directed to the shop 
 where his dress was hired.

 Alfred, as he entered the prison with his

 Intenseness of feeling continued to hold 
 Mrs. Moreland as if in the dark stupor of 
 death ; and Dillon in some measure par- 
 took of his mother's stupefaction ; it 
 alike deprived him of speech and action, 
 yet did not exclude the sensibility of pain. 
 
 Alfred approached, for part of the 
 partition that had divided the rooms was 
 thrown down ; he threw a look of anguish 
 on the whole ; the dreadful whole burst 
 on his soul at once \ all around was still, all- 
 appeared locked in the icy arms of death.. 
 
 The eyes of Jane were closed, her 
 cheeks and lips were white, yet there 
 remained a soft shade of melancholy 
 beauty blending with the wanness of her 
 features, that charmed while it maddened 
 the aching sense.

 stood open 3 but had lost all expression, and.

 from every livid lineament of his face, all 
 intelligence was gone. 
 
 " Dead ! — Dead ! — are they dead !" 
 shrieked Lord Fitz Ormond, starting up 
 in wild and glaring delirium with both 
 in his arms- — " No, not dead,— -I came home 
 to his wedding ! — I am a Lord — he shall 
 be a lord too — dead !■ — Proud ! — No !—

 Here his voice sunk low — it congealed 
 the circling blood, for it had a plaintive 
 horror which tore the heart.

 despair, Alfred drew hear $ he bent over

 them ; something he discerned, yet he 
 spoke not, but like the lightning's rapid 
 flash he flew down stairs, and in hurried 
 accents asked, " if any medical man were 
 within the walls, as the doors were closed, 
 and instant aid wanting ?" 
 
 A poor navy surgeon, who slept on the 
 tap-room bench, for want of better 
 quarters, offered his services, and with 
 Alfred flew to the scene of horror. 
 
 " Air, and water, and bandages !!* he- 
 cried. 
 
 Alfred took a shawl from his mother's 
 shoulders and tore it into long pieces, 
 while the surgeon, with a tenderness 
 seldom experienced from the boisterous 
 sons of Neptune, removed Jane whom he 
 perceived had only fainted ; he then laid 
 his hand on Hildebrande Fitz Ormond's 
 breast, pressed it a moment, and then with.

 a smile of feeling, which imparted beauty 
 to a roughened, sun-burnt set of features,

 all our moments watched. He deals us 
 mercies with an unsparing hand, and from 
 despair's dark chamber can raise a chosen 
 creature to shew forth his glory. 
 
 When Jane gazed through the aperture 
 of the partition, that bright beam which a 
 candle on the point of extinction emits, 
 fell full on ghastly features ; the soul 
 of Jane knew those features, and acknow- 
 ledged the adored Fitz Qrmond. She saw

 heaven gave her energy not her own ; it

 He had seen her fragile form ; he had felt 
 his pistol strongly graspt — what his 
 thoughts then were none ever knew.

 than the fine attenuated hajr, Omnipotence

 fearful eye, glided silently past them, the fa-

 her to the poor suicide's room Too soon 
 the awful scene was understood ; too soon 
 * the unhappy father recognised in the pros- 
 trate bleeding youth, the son of his heart, 
 the son of his adored, dead Eglentine. 
 
 Horrors crowded through his mind ; his 
 blood congealed, his brain grew numbed, 
 his heart deadened, and an icy heaviness 
 was chilling every faculty ; he fell, while 
 the wretched Jane, in a death-like insen- 
 sibility, ceased to feel, and ceased to suffer. 
 
 A great loss of blood . had almost re- 
 duced the enfeebled frame of Hildebrande 
 Fitz Ormond to infantine weakness ; but, 
 it also abated the fever of feeling, and

 mind, he was struck with pious awe, and 
 deeply deprecated the presumptuous deed 
 de pair had urged him to perpetrate; and 
 as horror and adoration commirgled in 
 his bosom, he reflected, and the reflection 
 raised in his soul a gratitude bordering on 
 a sentiment divine, that in the very mo- 
 ment human passions had nerved a sacri- 
 ligious hand to destroy the sacred gift of 
 being, and annihilate every earthly, every 
 heavenly hope, a beneficent providence had 
 sent a noble father, and the most wor- 
 shipped of her kind, to woo him back to 
 comfort, honor, and felicity. 
 
 Among the first days of Fitz Ormond's 
 sitting, Jane became his nurse ; and her 
 endearing smiles and attentions proved 
 most healing and reviving cordials ; their 
 thoughts were pure as the first happy pair

 days of innocence and peace revived within 
 their bosoms, and with their feelings they 
 were imparadised. 
 
 She was reclining one morning on the 
 sofa by him, her soft arm was round his 
 neck, and her other hand claspt his with 
 modest fervour ; for some moments they 
 were silent, yet every passing thought gave 
 expression to Fitz Ormond's features ; a 
 shade of sadness was seen, and a repressed 
 sigh was heard — -the watchful ear of love 
 heard it. 
 
 " Blessed Mary !" he cried, looking in 
 her fine, yet anxious face, w'uh love inef- 
 fable, and while he spoke, feelings superior 
 to self, gave speaking colours to his pale 
 cheek, bright as the tints of opening roses ;

 circle of these tender and beloved arms #

 " Dear Mary ! can we be happy, so

 Fitz Ormond could not go on. 
 
 Jane now felt the acme of human bliss ; 
 she was' worshipped as Mary, she was 
 esteemed as Jane; her character and herself 
 had produced the sentiment her soul, 
 in its proudest, richest, most enthusiastic 
 moments had desired ; that moment re- 
 munerated an age of suffering, it was 
 worth a millenium of vulgar joy.

 Speechless they sunk into each others 
 arms ; intensity of feeling, intensity of 
 bliss had reached its utmost point, and 
 every sense was lulled in soft delirium ; 
 yet holy virtue chastened the mutual rap- 
 ture, and their rapture was seraphic, 
 
 Fitz Ormond was still weak \ the mo- 
 ment was too much for attenuated feel- 
 ing, and the mind's wasting energy, w h

 It would have been tedious and unin- 
 teresting, and so similar to every detail of

 excused, and that simply saying all had re- 
 moved to Grosvenor Street, and the first 
 medical people were called in, will suffice j

 pression of Jane's grateful eye, and in the 
 fervid pressure of the doting father's hand, 
 the long indigent and neglected Neville, 
 anticipated future patronage and inde- 
 pendence. 
 
 Fitz Ormond's wound had only been 
 dangerous, from the vast effusion of blood, 
 and with his father for a nurse, and Jane 
 for his gentle physician, with the watch- 
 ful attention which now awaited his every 
 look, it will not be doubted but his reco«

 dying bed of Sir GeofFry became the topic ; 
 and Jane, half affecting a pretty anger, 
 said she had often reflected on the disgust 
 lie had expressed for her features, when 
 deformed by the small pox, with some 
 regret, " for oh, Hildebrande," she added, 
 " what dependance should be placed on an 
 attachment which gave such consequence

 replied, " I must think a pretty face, a 
 very pretty thing." 
 
 " It is pleasing, certainly," said Jane, 
 very seriously, " but I should sink in my

 fall in value, could I believe a possession 
 so evanescent, and held in common by 
 the most degraded of my sex, were con-

 daughters, followed by a harp and new 
 music, suspended further conversation,

 with infinite satisfaction, she beheld Lady-

 glasses were down, 
 
 " Dear Lady Ellen !" and " dear Miss De

 when Jane surveyed her friend's figure ; 
 she was in deep mourning.

 gloomy fire of an appalled soul gleamed

 terrors of detection and exposure, and

 she was often eloquent in silence, and 
 now kissing the dear hand she held, she 
 arose, and to hide her emotion ran out 
 of the room, saying, "she must dress 
 for dinner." 
 
 It was an enlivening morning, early in 
 May, when Lord Fitz Ormond on horse- 
 back, attended by a single servant out of 
 livery, reached a romantic village on the 
 banks of the Thames, at the end of which 
 were the spacious pleasure grounds be. 
 longing to the Earl of Berkhamstead. 
 
 His Lordship had alighted, and giving 
 his horse to the servant, resolved to 
 make enquiries on foot ; and he had en* 
 tered a narrow path leading to the com- 
 mon lane, when a coffin, borne by a few 
 villagers, and followed by an aged woman, 
 carrying a baby, came suddenly on his view. 
 It was not here a sight, seen every day

 as in the great city, and the humble fol- 
 lowers were weeping. Lord Fitz Or- 
 mond asked who was going to the grave ? 
 " It was a village maiden,'* they said j 
 "she had been lovely,lowly, and simple, had 
 borne an eighteen months' strange sickness, 
 pined away with such slow wasting, as 
 had made the hour of death most wel- 
 come. The knell was sounding sadly 
 through the vale, and it caused a pause 
 for sobs. Annie had borne unhusbanded 
 a mother's name, and he who should 
 have cherished the bosom which never 
 had more than innocence to cheer it, left her 
 a wretched one ; the scorn of every sister 
 maiden, the pity of many a village swain ; 
 evil tongues grew very busy, and Annie 
 was marked for being — what she had not 
 made herself. She had one ill heavier 
 than all the rest — forgetfulness from him

 she had loved so dearly. Once he wrote, 
 but only once, and that drop of comfort 
 came to mingle with her cup of wretch- 
 edness. 
 
 Annie never more had tidings ; Mary 
 heard from Henry, but no mention was 
 ever made of Annie, so she pined, and 
 pined away, and for herself and baby toiled, 
 and toiled till she sunk with weakness. 
 
 Her old mother omitted no kind office, 
 and she worked very hard, and even with 
 hard working, barely earned enough to 
 make life struggle ; thus she lay on the 
 sick bed of poverty, so worn and wasted, 
 that she could make no effort to express 
 affection for her infant ; and the child, 
 whose lisping love perhaps had solaced her, 
 with strangest infant ingratitude, shunned 
 her as one indifferent ; but Annie was past 
 $hat anguish, for she felt her hour draw

 on, and it was her only comfort now to 
 think on the grave* 
 
 " Poor, poor, Annie ! ,f her mother said, 
 c< thou hast suffered much !" 
 
 " Aye, mother ! there is none can tell 
 what I have suffered !" she faintly replied j 
 <* but I shall soon be where they rest — and 
 never suffer." 
 
 And Annie did rest her soon, for it has 
 pleased God to take her now to be among 
 his own.

 wJien and where least expected, to crush 
 a father. 
 
 Lord Fitz Ormond had almost made 
 the circuit of the village, when two rosy- 
 cheeked children, at their innocent gam- 
 bols before a cottage door, attracted his 
 notice ; he was pleased with their looks 
 of innocence, and gave them some silver, 
 of which, young as they were, they seemed 
 to know the value, for, flying into the 
 hut, they exultingly cried, " Look, mam- 
 my, look!" 
 
 The astonished mother hastened out, 
 and, thanking the generous donor, dropt 
 many of her lowliest courtsies, and wished 
 she knew how to make amends. 
 
 " You can, possibly, do more than make 
 amends," replied his lordship, "and insure 
 to yourself a larger bounty." 
 
 The woman assured him of her good

 before, begged to learn his honor's plea-

 " As sure as eggs is eggs, your honour

 " Where can I find this Tim Welby and 
 his Siezem ?" asked his Lordship. 
 
 " An, please you, Sir, Tim works along 
 with my husband in the turnip field, for 
 since these sore hard times, they are glad 
 to get a hand's turn any where ; I expects 
 them main soon to what they can catch,

 the dog, and here is a something to make 
 your next Monday better than the last." 
 
 The poor woman felt transported, it 
 was a note, but she could not give her 
 transport expression, for at the moment 
 her husband, Tim Welby, and a rough 
 shaggy mastiff made their appearance. 
 
 " Tim Welby," she halloo'd as they 
 approached, " I say, Tim Welby, here be

 " And was the flesh entirely torn from

 " Yes, your honour, Siezem never 
 leaves his bit behind un ; it was in his 
 clinched teeth, sleeve and altogether, I ha 
 kept it, your honour, wi a glittering thing,

 served ?" 
 
 " That a wool, your honour, ring and

 lane to an adjoining cottage, while Lord

 Fitz Ormond secretly indulged some pre- 
 sentiment, that the sleeve might lead 
 to a discovery of the unprincipled ruffian, 
 who had so daringly premeditated the 
 outrage against Jane. 
 
 Tim presented the pieces ; one was a 
 piece of apparently dark-coloured cloth, 
 but so distained with blood that the hue 
 was undistinguishable ; the other shred 
 was of thick black silk, and though nothing 
 extraordinary appeared in them, his lord- 
 ship asked what could purchase these tro- 
 phies of Siezem's valour ? 
 
 Poor Tim said " his honour had paid 
 enough money," looking with a wishful 
 eye at his neighbour's treasure, which the 
 good housewife still held in her hand ; 
 " but if he could get enough for new 
 shoes — " 
 
 " Here is a five pound note, Tim," said

 his lordship, " and be in the way to- 
 morrow, or next day, about this hour, 
 and— " 
 
 Tim fell on his knees in rapture, " Five 
 pound !" he cried, " five pound ! dear, dear, 
 your honor, your generous noble honor, 
 take ring and all, take it, take it j" and as 
 he spoke, the grateful being forced it into 
 his lordship's hand ; but no sooner had 
 it met his eye, than, staggering a few paces 
 backward, he leaned against the cottage 
 wall for support, trembled violently, and 
 in accents weak and tremulous, with claspt 
 hands and uplifted eyes, he cried, " Eglen- 
 tine ! Eglentine ! once again," 
 
 The poor simple beings around him 
 were terrified at his sudden and strange 
 emotion, and were flying in every direc- 
 tion, bawling for help, and the potecary,

 reaching the ear of the servant, he rode 
 up to the scene of confusion. 
 
 His lordship, however, had somewhat 
 recovered composure; he mounted his 
 horse, and promising to see Tim soon 
 again, absorbed in a profound reverie, he 
 slowly returned to town, and did not 
 appear till the bell sounded for dinner, 
 when, unmindful of appearance, he de- 
 scended without having even thrown off 
 his boots.

 The dinner past in sombre silence fit had 
 be n gloomy and unsocial ; Lord Fitz 
 Ormond appeared sunk in the depths of 
 rumination, and every bosom felt cheer- 
 less, without being able to assign any rea- 
 son for tke depression. 
 
 At length, however, his lordship ad- 
 dressed Jane ; " I have, fortunately," said 
 he, " discovered your champion and his 
 dog, my dear Jane, and some day soon 
 we must pay them a visit ; it is a strange 
 ugly cur, but mighty, trustworthy in his 
 embassies to the flesh, (added he, attempt- 
 ing to smile gaily) for he never leaves it

 without substantial proofs of his having 
 been there : therefore, the ruffian must 
 cut off his arm, else Siezem's marks will 
 betray him. ,, 
 
 Some appropriate observations followed, 
 but his lordship saying " he had to go out 
 on private business, which might detain 
 him till late in the evening, the ladies 
 proposed going to the Theatre to see 
 a pretty little actress, who gave promise 
 of celebrity ; the young lady had been 
 well educated, and was well connected, 
 but, at an early age, falling in love with 
 independence^ the pride it inspired, led her 
 to the exertion of very pleasing talents, 
 and it was generally allowed she had but 
 one fault, and that fault in the actress

 feminine graces — diffidence.

 as Lord Fitz Ormond was retiring for 
 the night ; he pleaded a slight head ache 
 as an apology for his unusual retreat, and 
 requesting breakfast might be ordered at 
 an early hour, he left his family to com- 
 ment on a reserve which, though it creat- 
 ed little or no alarm, being very uncustom- 
 ary, occasioned considerable and varied 
 conjecture. 
 
 His Lordship was the first at the break- 
 fast-table next morning, and betrayed 
 something of a calm impatience to have 
 the repast over, and the equipage was 
 removing, when Hildebrande affectionately 
 enquired if any circumstance had occurred 
 
 to disturb him ?

 way ; a diversity of opinions would only

 pretty lips might be pleading for pity, 
 where I determine justice alone shall hold 
 lier even steady balance." 
 
 Further question and rejoinder were 
 suspended by the entrance of a servant, 
 informing his Lordship two gentlemen in 
 a hackney coach enquired for him, and 
 that his own chariot was in waiting. 
 
 He instantly went out, and seating 
 himself in the carriage, desired the two 
 gentlemen who had come in the hack to 
 follow him, when saying to the attending 
 footman, "Lady Clancarron's," the carriage 
 drove off. 
 
 The Countess's door being opened, his 
 Lordship and friends entered the hall, and 
 demanded to see Lord and Lady Clan- 
 carron. 
 
 " They are at breakfast and not yet 
 visible — but your name. Sir ?'*

 " The breakfast-room, Sir," cried his 
 Lord hip, and sans ceremonie, followed by 
 his friends, he ascended the stairs after the 
 servant, who, surprised at such abrupt 
 Visitors, and to precede them at all being 
 obliged to run, he had scarcely time to 
 say, i( Company," when the unexpected 
 trio stood in the presence of the Countess 
 Glancarron. 
 
 The Earl, Lady Florence, Don Diego, 
 and her Ladyship, were seated at the morn- 
 ing repast, but on their entrance, as if 
 actuated by one impulse all arose. 
 
 " A most unprecedented obtrusion," 
 said her Ladyship with haughtiness, while 
 gathering indignation swelled her robust 
 frame ; " what want you, good people, 
 here ? Who are you 5"

 children, I am their parent, their legal 
 protector, and will be the powerful 
 defender of their mutual rights." 
 
 The recollection of accumulated mis- 
 deeds, and dark transgressions, rushed to 
 the brain of the Countess, and threw a 
 guilty paleness over every agitated feature. 
 The Earl, he shrunk, he shivered in 
 thought, and would have retreated within 
 the foldings of hypocrisy, which had so 
 Jong;, but that, he feared, would no longer

 A vindictive wrath sat on the scowling 
 brows of Lady Florence, and her lips were 
 while with the irrepressible rancor burst- 
 ing from an envenomed heart. All for an 
 instant v/ere still, as if the dumbness of 
 death had suspended the power of speech. 
 
 Lord Fitz Crmond, with stead/ and 
 commanding step approached Don Diego ; 
 a stern expression of unuttered thought 
 had thrown a dreadful darkness over his 
 strong lined features, and a gloomy fire 
 gleamed in eyes, which spoke the wild 
 perturbations of a bold adventurous spirit. 
 
 Lord Fitz Ormond spoke. 
 
 " Don Diego D'Almeyda, is that your 
 name ?" 
 
 The Don paused, — " My name!"

 The Don's countenance, however, wore 
 a doubtful expression as he spoke.

 ing eye turned to a gloomy white.

 what can Alvanley have to do with Don

 The strong workings of stern despair 
 were visible ; pride, vengeance, rage, and 
 desperate defiance mingled their fires in 
 his dark bosom, and he looked all over 
 fiend ; they who beheld him shuddered, 
 and in dreadful anticipation, looked a3 
 if something strange and horrid was com- 
 ing. With a fierce and haughty stride, he ; 
 paced the room, theij who had accompa- 
 nied Lord Fitz Ormond stepped between 
 him and the door. 
 
 " Am I beset ?■' he cried, his gigantic 
 form proudly, sternly looking down. 
 
 " You pass not, Sir."

 " Not pass !" his tones they sounded not

 but perdition to the puny powers of baby- 
 man! a wretched mastiffs jaws, baffled 
 my determined arm, and the soul that 
 never yielded to a man, was conquered by 
 a dog !" 
 
 His words struck Lady Clancarron 
 speechless, her blood felt curdling with new 
 and strange terrors, yet she could only 
 gaze wildly, first on one, and then on ano- 
 ther * 7 till at length her heavy eye fixed on

 with tearing tortures never felt before. 
 
 Horrible fears shook all of man in the 
 nature of Lord Clancarron, and his coun- 
 tenance betrayed the dark alarms of 
 hidden guiltiness.

 He seemed to shrink within himself, 
 and for a moment : mused in secret 
 thought, again he was erect and bold. 
 
 He approached Lady Clancarron ; she

 with her hands, cried in agony, " Leave us ! 
 leave us, Don Dieg- , leave us 1" 
 
 ic Fear not that," said he ; " yet one 
 moment more, yet some few words, and 
 I will leave you." 
 
 He moved a step, the officers followed, 
 
 " I meditate not escape, good keepers,

 " Newgate is the county gaol, but — "

 his parched and whitened lip, and bending

 The last ray of lingering feeling, of a 
 human feeling within his bosom, accom-

 it gave a softened tint to his dark cheek,

 never looked again. 
 
 While bending over his distracted wife, 
 he had buried a poniard deep, even up to 
 the hilt within his own heart ; the blood 
 gushed forth, he staggered, and fell.

 death's last cold pang gathered fast over 
 his wrung features — the word — " Par- 
 don 1" with short and thickening breath, 
 was half respired, and in one heavy, 
 writhing groan, the dark soul left its con- 
 vulsed mansion, for the society of kin- 
 dred spirits in the regions of untried 
 being. 
 
 Lady Clancarron's horror and multi- 
 plied agonies found refuge for a time in 
 utter insensibility. 
 
 The wretched widowed Florence, feeling 
 neither the fortitude of innocence, nor a 
 claim to the commiseration of the good, 
 yielded to all the indecent violence of 
 irremediable despair. She tore her hair 
 and bosom ; curses and imprecations too 
 horrible for repetition, or to be heard by 
 the gentle and good, were shrieked through 
 gnashing teeth, and lips foaming with 
 ungoverned fury, till at length nature, to«

 feeble to sustain the varied tumult of 
 such rending torture any longer, she fell 
 into those inconscious convulsions, the 
 agony of which has never been described, 
 because indescribable. 
 
 Lord Clancarron, with the imbecility of 
 conscious guilt, and trembling apprehen- 
 sion, stood as if transfixed, gazing va- 
 cantly on the scene of complicated horror 
 which surrounded him, and involved his 
 family, their comforts, and their charac- 
 ter. 
 
 Lord Fitz Ormond, whose generous arid 
 humane nature was severely shocked at the 
 tragical end of a man, whose daring enor- 
 mities had not only left a stain on huma- 
 nity, but deeply implicated a branch of 
 the family revered by his heart, and en- 
 deared by many a soft remembrance, 
 acted with cairn and dignified propriety on 
 the distressing occasion. Cool and collected

 he supplied the want of others exertion, 
 and gave necessary orders that the corpse 
 might be removed for the Coroner's in- 
 quest, which done, he recommended the 
 Countess and her widowed daughter to 
 the care and attention of their domestics, 
 and returning to Grosvenor Street, in the 
 bosom of domestic endearment, and inno- 
 cent peace 3 found calmness and compo- 
 sure.

 CHAPTER IX. 
 
 Diego Vallini was born of Italian parents, 
 respectable in their character, but obscure 
 in their condition ; his appetites were 
 strong and his passions violent, and his 
 early habits so irregular and depraved, 
 that the sorrow-stricken parents were 
 meditating an application to the police, in 
 order to restrain his enormities, and by- 
 monastic discipline awaken him to a sense 
 of error ; when taking advantage of their 
 temporary absence from home, he robbed 
 them of their whole store, and fled from 
 the paternal roof for ever. 
 In various climates, and under various

 characters, he practised on the unsuspicious 
 nature, and that guileless confidence, which 
 thinking no ill itself, believes no ill of 
 another, familiar with deception, and a 
 perfect adept in dissimulation, he some- 
 times almost worked himself up to believe 
 himself the person he represented. 
 
 His mind was comprehensive, and he 
 possessed a depth of thought and subtlety 
 of invention, which enabled him to cir- 
 cumvent those with better sense, and 
 superior abilities, and for several yean?, 
 under the specious mark of a grave sedate 
 exterior, and a profouud veneration for 
 the sciences, he had enriched his coffers 
 by the arts of a Chevalier D'lndustrie. 
 
 " Every character," he had been heard 
 
 to say, " had its dark shade, and the 
 
 strongest mind some vulnerable part, at 
 
 which folly could gain admission—it was

 a weakness, but he was partial to games of 
 chance, and after a day of study the gam- 
 ing table had his nights." 
 
 He never remained long in one place, 
 changed his name with his abode, and 
 would frequently throw away small sums 
 to lure the unguarded, to venture a stake 
 worth his dexterity to secure. 
 
 Thus had Vallini realized a considerable 
 sum, without having done more than 
 exciting suspicion of what never could be 
 proved, and with his principles and 
 character unsuspected, he arrived at 
 Madeira, in the specious appearance of a 
 foreign merchant, at the period Lord Fitz 
 Ormond, tinder the assumed name of 
 Alvanley, was there. He had often met 
 him in public, and endeavoured to insinuate 
 himself into his confidence, but there was 
 a dark cunning and busy curiosity, which

 at times would break fhrough his reserve, 
 from which the generous nature recoils, 
 and the heart of Lord Ficz Ormond 
 shrunk from. 
 
 Ever on the watch to take advantage of 
 circumstances, he casually heard, during 
 the supposed Alvanley's illness, that he 
 had a large sum of money in gold j the 
 servant had mentioned it to secure 
 master attention, and it was during this 
 poor fellow's short absence, that Signor 
 Vallinr, who had a passpartout for almost 
 every lock, failed here ; but the vessel he 
 was to depart in being under weigh, a 
 trifle did not impede him, he broke the 
 lock, and with daring hand not only took 
 every guinea, but approaching the bed, 
 purloined his- watch, and while taking it, 
 his rapacious eye fixed on a ring suspended 
 by a black ribbon from the sick man's neck,

 Kad not the unconscious sufferer's every 
 sense been dormant, the stern sisters 
 severing shears, which clip the vital thread 
 of being, had been less severely felt, than 
 when with ruthless and remorseless hand 
 the plunderer tore the first love gift of 
 dear departed Eglentine from the widowed 
 bosom, where holy lasting love had en- 
 shrined it. 
 
 The eye that ever wakes, and ever 
 watches, beheld the deed, and commis- 
 sioned angels guarded the sacred pledge ; 
 though in a felon's keeping, it was safe, 
 and in the hour appointed, was made the 
 instrument of detection and condemna- 
 tion to the sinner's soul. 
 
 The robbery was not known till after 
 Vallini's departure, when its* suddenness, 
 and his having been seen in the invalid's 
 apartment, gave rise to conjectures, if not

 absolute certainty, that he was the plun- 
 derer. 
 
 On his arrival in Portugal, he found 
 himself possessed of property which would 
 have answered all the honest and honour- 
 able purposes of a moderate mind ; but 
 the even path of integrity is a difficult 
 walk for the crooked spirit ; Vallini knew 
 not its easy peaceful geography, and such 
 was his emboldened depravity, that diffi- 
 culty and danger only added charms to an 
 enterprise. 
 
 Landing in one of the remote provinces 
 of Portugal, he resolved to purchase a name 
 and title, with a chateau, which the inter- 
 nal commotion of the country rendered 
 an easy purchase ; he could then say xvho 
 he was when it suited, and as he now 
 seriously meditated some dernier coup 
 thai would enable him to pass for a foreign

 nobleman in England, where he longed to 
 display his supererninent abilities ; the pos- 
 session of this chateau answered his pur- 
 pose, and in a moment he became Don 
 Diego D s Almeyda, (the name of the estate) 
 and with much eclat he made his appear- 
 ance in Lisbon. 
 
 An apparent success and prosperity are 
 n, for a time, allowed by providence 
 to attend the most unjustifiable actions, 
 while the culpable being, wrapped up in 
 fancied security, is j y led on to 
 
 that point which is-to terminate in shame, 
 exposure, and ruin. 
 
 Lady Clancarron and her family had 
 arrived there on their plans, a very short 
 time before the Don ; he frequently met 
 them, and hearing they were of distinc- 
 tion, he procured himself an introduction, 
 and artfully paid them those delicate atten-

 tions which are better felt than described, 
 till at length he became so necessary to 
 their comfort, that the day was heavy and 
 uninteresting in which the Don did not 
 appear. 
 
 He was now about the middle of life ; 
 his figure tall and commanding, and his 
 air imposing ; and, though the stern pro- 
 perties of his dark mind gave a gloomy 
 expression to his full -lined "countenance, 
 there was an ease and affability in his man- 
 ner, when it suited his purposes, which, 
 discovered an acquaintance witji life in its 
 superior walks, and which gratified those it 
 was intended to gratify. 
 
 To the Countess, he always offered the 
 most unqualified deference ; to the Earl, 
 he acted in the triple character of moni- 
 tor, companion, and confidant ; he soon 
 discovered they had not an abundance of

 money, and as he had his own secret 
 designs, he established a system with his 
 Lordship to gain money, and in a short 
 time, the poor weak Clancarron could play 
 the whole game, yet only knew as much 
 of it as it pleased his mentor he should 
 know. 
 
 Destitute alike of principle and feeling,- 
 Lis imbecile mind became an easy tool in 
 such a crafty hand ; when his evil pro- 
 pensities and vicious habits all co-operating, 
 he was driven about alternately by the 
 blasts of passion, folly, and fashion, and 
 his character made up of shreds and 
 patches of nature's worst materials, he 
 became a thing in Don Diego's, or, indeed, 
 any other hand, to be moved at pleasure. 
 
 Lady Florence became the goddess of 
 his idolatry ; the qualities of her nature 
 were in unison with his own ; their pride

 and rancour, envy and avari e, were con- 
 genial, and both allowed their passions 
 to be their governing principles. 
 
 The Don had the art to insinuate with- 
 out seeming to do it, that he possessed 
 not only immense estates in Portugal, but 
 also had considerable claims in England, 
 but he had more than his habits of life 
 required, and unless some heart, such as 
 he could appreciate, would deign to share 
 his distinctions, he himself would be their 
 tomb. These conversations cunningly in- 
 troduced, and, as if by accident, drawn 
 from the secret recesses of his heart, had 
 their full effect on the Countess, and 
 made their wished impression on her 
 daughter ; he became their confidant, and 
 received an invitation to visit "England, 
 and make Clancarron house his residence. 
 This was beyond his hopes, and he was

 resolving how to expedite their departure, 
 for he had many aims, and many games 
 to play, when the English papers announ- 
 ced the death of Sir GeorTry De Dunstan- 
 ville, and his grand-daughter's accession 
 to the whole of his immense fortunes. 
 
 Their determinations on this event have 
 already been detailed ; the Clancarron 
 family set out immediately, and the Don, 
 as he had promised, followed, when he 
 had made necessary arrangements. He 
 now disposed of Chateau D'Almeyda, 
 but this he concealed from his fair Flo- 
 rence, and, on joining them in London, 
 he declared, smiling, " the fatigue of 
 stewards, tenants, and even rents, was so 
 excessive, that poverty would be almost 
 preferable." 
 
 The moment Don Diego beheld the 
 blaze of Jane's beauty, the empire of Flo-

 rence began to shake, but this he cauti- 
 ously concealed, and it must, in justice 
 be allowed, it was a very secondary con- 
 sideration to the blaze of her gold. 
 
 Through his various emissaries he learnt 
 how firmly she was attached to young 
 Fitz Ormond ; but, if not well-knowing 
 that public addresses would lose him the 
 certainty of Lady Florence ; he secretly 
 meditated making one bold stroke to se- 
 cure herself, her fortunes, and all for ever 
 his own. 
 
 Meantime, her Ladyship was plotting 
 and manoeuvring for her son, and when 
 she found every plan and effort abortive, 
 it struck her prolific brain, that were her 
 consequence reduced, she might surrender, 
 as she had not the most remote idea pf 
 her heart being engaged j no sooner had

 her depraved heart engendered the idea, 
 than she communicated the whole plan 
 to the Don, whose very brain and soul 
 took fire at the brilliant enterprize. The 
 Countess well recollected hearing of the 
 premature death of Sir Geoffry's younger 
 brother ; and the obscurity of many cir- 
 cumstances attending his fate, furnished 
 a spacious field for crafty invention to 
 work, and raise a plausible structure of 
 deception ; old papers, letters, with certifi- 
 cates of birth, affidavits and witnesses were 
 all prepared and properly instructed, and 
 the accommodating Mr. Flarehomme being 
 recommended as a most convenient soli- 
 citor, every thing was in train, when Lord 
 Berkhamstead's masquerade was consider- 
 ed, by the Don, as the best, and only 
 scene for his secret card to be played.

 A license, when parties are of a^e, is 
 easily procured, and bank notes, in the 
 eyes of a poor curate, fonder of mammon 
 than righteousness, having a most bewitch- 
 ing aspect, he informed himself of Jane's 
 dress, watched her motions during the 
 night, and at length, for his destruction, 
 the opportunity which he considered glo- 
 rious, offered itself; he had provided a 
 carriage, well armed with fleet horses in 
 waiting, for whether she had been com- 
 pelled to submit to the enforced ceremo* 
 ny or not, it was his intention to take her 
 off, till she could be reduced, either by 
 intreaty or terror to submit to his wishes, 
 and appear his acknowledged wife. 
 
 How Jane was rescued has been related, 
 while the Don bleeding, in horrible pain, 
 burning with disappointed passion, foam- 
 ing with rage, and venting the most appal-

 ling execrations, was carried by his two 
 accomplices to the waiting chaise, and by 
 his own desire taken to a Hotel, till his 
 arm was examined and dressed ; it was 
 dreadfully lacerated, but being only a flesh 
 wound it was soon healed. 
 
 To the Countess and her family, it was 
 in secrecy represented as une petite affaire 
 dlionneur ; tears, prayers, and several be- 
 coming faintings from Lady Florence, 
 were displayed as testimonies of ardent 
 affection, while the mother was not spar- 
 ing of her tender remonstrances, to be 
 less prodigial of a life so precious to so 
 many. 
 
 The ring he had lost being of some 
 value, he lamented, but inquiry was too 
 dangerous, and he relinquished the idea. 
 
 It was during his hours of convales- 
 cence, when all hopes of entrapping Miss

 De Dunstanville had vanished, that to se- 
 cure the best prize in his power, with the 
 least trouble, as he so much disliked the 
 troublesome routine of law and lawyers, 
 he proposed a private marriage to Lady- 
 Florence ; a few delicate maiden hesita- 
 tions, heart pantings, and cheek biushings, 
 were neither very serious nor insurmount- 
 able obstacles, and besides every thing se- 
 cret was delightful, so they went out one 
 morning early ;:o a neighbouring church, 
 and Lady Florence returned no longer a 
 Clan car r on. 
 
 By this private arrangement the Don 
 escaped the vast fatigue of signing mar- 
 riage settlements, pin money, jointer, &c. 
 and as nothing could prevent him re^ 
 ceiving ten thousand pounds at her mo- 
 ther's death, why the thing being done,

 he considered it on the whole a chef 
 (Tceiwre of contrivance, and > he could 
 bid defiance to prevention. 
 
 So far secured, beyond what he once 
 would have conceived a possibility of suc- 
 cess, he began to wish that some good 
 terms could be made with the heiress y 
 for well he knew the matter never could 
 be brought into court, and when he reflec- 
 ted on the magnitude and difficulty of the. 
 enterprize, with the danger of detection, 
 and impossibility of extrication, he seri- 
 ously wished it had never been attempted, 
 and ardently desired to withdraw his ill- 
 founded claims. 
 
 On his hinting certain apprehensions 
 to the Countess of future trouble and ex- 
 posure, if not punishment, her Ladyship 
 volunteered once more a visit to Jane, and 
 on her return, hopeless, disappointed, and

 miserable, bursting with rage, and terrified 
 at impending exposure, after a variety of 
 propositions and plans, it was resolved the 
 claims should be dropped, and so well she 
 knew the gentleness and generosity of 
 the heart she had so wrung, that she even 
 ventured to hope a remission of transgres- 
 sion, and that a general reconciliation 
 would take place with all parties. 
 
 Jane's love for Fitz Ormond, her proudly 
 avowed love, and her contempt for her 
 son, were scorpions that stung deep, and 
 added to the exposure and shame that 
 would attend their meeting, induced her 
 to propose again leaving England, till the 
 circumstances should sink into oblivion, 
 when they could return, and, perhaps, 
 former intimacy be resumed ; but the 
 Countess found neither her son, Lady Flo-

 rence, nor even the ever complaisant and 
 conciliating Don, acquiescent on this occa- 
 sion. 
 
 England abounded with pleasures and 
 plenty ; he was well received, and he hap- 
 pily held the power in his own hands ; 
 therefore, the Don determined to sojourn 
 a little longer in our " sea : girt isle." 
 
 The Countess never felt less at her 
 ease ; irresolution shook every plan. She 
 could not proceed, and she could not re« 
 treat ; poverty was again besetting hef 
 doors. She had closed her own admission 
 at Jane's banker's against herself, and Lady 
 Clancarron was in despondency, when, to 
 her feelings to the climax of horror 
 and despair, she encountered Jane, bloom- 
 ing in health, beauty, and renovated happi- 
 ness, and attended with a splendour and 
 magnificence, that whirled every sense ta

 pretensions she had sanctioned, indeed

 home, her condition was nearly approach- 
 ing to a torturing frenzy, but the argu- 
 ments of her family convincing her that 
 prompt measures were become necessary, 
 she grew rather calm, and the first step re- 
 solved on, was to employ confidential 
 people in the business, and, while one was 
 dispatched to Mrs. Norman, Jane's late 
 lodgings, to make discoveries respecting 
 her wonderful, and, to her, appalling alte- 
 ration of condition, another was directed 
 to summon their privy counsellor, Mr. 
 Flarehomme. 
 
 Their messenger soon returned from 
 Mrs. Norman's, loaded with intelligence. 
 
 The Countess gasped with impatience. 
 " Is Miss De Dunstanville there ? — Is she ? 
 What is she ?— Speak i" 
 
 " Why, my lady," said her emissary, 
 " a little will go a great way in what is to

 be told of the heiress. Mr. Fitz OrmoncTs 
 father is sure enough come, he is cast up, 
 with a vengeance to us all ; he needs nei- 
 ther law nor lawyers to get at his lands 
 and lordships, for he is the richest Earl in 
 all Ireland ; he has adopted Miss De Dun- 
 stanville, who, it seems, assisted him, when 
 he made as if he had been a poor man 
 wanting charity ; and she and her lover 
 Hildebrande, who was discovered in pri- 
 son, are to be married in a few days, and 
 such preparations were never known be- 
 fore, as are making for the wedding. 
 
 " The Earl laughs," continued her con- 
 fidante, " at the Don's pretensions to Miss 
 De Dunstanville's estates, and says, when 
 happiness gives a little leisure, he will settle 
 them easily ; he has been a far traveller, 
 and Mrs. Norman thinks, by his looks and 
 hints on the subject, that all the documents

 and proofs of Mr. Maximilian De Dun- 
 stanville's death, and all about him, are in 
 his possession." 
 
 Don Diego, while she spoke, could have 
 wished himself any where, rather than in 
 England ; a dark reserve sat upon his 
 scowling brow, and he secretly resolved to 
 leave the country, with his wife, as soon 
 as certain plans, his fertile brain had 
 arranged, were productive ; turning 
 therefore to the Countess, with a smile, he 
 bade her " Fear nothing." 
 
 But his voice had lost its persuasive 
 'charm ; a boding sickness seized * her 
 heart, and stiffening in the horror of accu- 
 mulated recollections, and their dreadful 
 consequences, for a time she sat without 
 either speech or motion. 
 
 The Peer was from home, forgetting his 
 confusion and apprehensions at the Dog ;

 and as for Lady Florence, whose feelings 
 ever concentred in self, calm in the ima- 
 ginary security of having a rich husband, 
 she reasoned very composedly on the evils 
 and disgrace impending over the rest of 
 her family. 
 
 In a little time Mr. Flarehomme made 
 his appearance ; he approached with the 
 accustomed fawning obsequiousness with 
 which he endeavoured to veil his coarse 
 manners, when in the presence of supe- 
 riors, and not having noticed the perturbed 
 features of the Countess, or the repressed 
 agitation of the Don, he declared that, 
 though going to the Judge's chambers on 
 special concerns, his solicitude in their 
 affairs had made him postpone it, to learn 
 their pleasure. 
 
 " To learn our pains, rather," replied 
 Lady Ciancarron ; " Miss De Dunstan-

 she is no longer helpless and friendless ; 
 she has become great and powerful, and 
 her power will blast us ; what can be 
 done ? Devise what may avert the bursting 
 storm of horror, something must be done, 
 and instantly." 
 
 The paleness of blended apprehension 
 and malign meanness overspread every 
 coarse feature of his vulgar countenance, 
 and while the contraction of bus*./ scowl- 
 ing brows gave dark evidence of inward 
 cunning, he paused in a gloomy and re- 
 flective silence, at length the oracle spoke. 
 
 " Her marriage and power will plead 
 little in our courts, for what can invali- 
 date the claims of justice ?" 
 
 Every eye was raised, for most dubious 
 were his words.

 fused; I am really astonished,'' and the

 Don's just claims will be established." 
 
 His auditors were struck dumb, and 
 their eyes fixed on him as on an uncommon

 There are windings in the honourable

 of a vision, except his own claims. Impu- 
 dence was his brazen shield — these, there- 
 fore, remained in full force, and, notwith- 
 standing the large sums he had drawn, 
 his rapacity demanded more, for the heart, 
 hardened by repeated enormities, loses 
 even the last feeble ray of expiring virtue, 
 shame, Mr. Flarehomme, therefore, una- 
 bashed, and boldly impudent in his guilt, 
 turned towards Don Diego and the 
 Countess, saying, " I must now attend the 
 judge, and when you have more import- 
 ant information to communicate, you know 
 my house, and in the mean time, Lady 
 Clancarron, depend on me; when we come 
 into our courts, you need not fear but 
 what just claims will be heard and esta- 
 blished. Oh! I had forgotten, papers want

 The cold and remorseless contempt with 
 which the pitiful petifogger had thrown 
 not only the whole obloquy on his employ- 
 ers, but also deserted their cause in mo- 
 ments of extremest exigency, gave a retri- 
 butive pang, and, in deadly bitterness of 
 soul, the Countess cursed the deceptious 
 attorney, the too ready villany of the 
 Don, herself, and every one any way con- 
 cerned, or accessary in the iniquitous tran- 
 saction, which now assumed so alarming 
 and disastrous an appearance. 
 
 The remaining part of the torturing day 
 was past among these illustrious confer 
 derates in unavailing regrets, splenetic 
 allusions, and mutual reproaches, and while 
 each vented the guilty recrimination, each 
 framed a secret and separate plan for fu-

 and fearful alarms which will ever accom- 
 pany the guilty bosom in its moments of 
 retirement, the dreadful evening closed 
 upon them. 
 
 ft was on the following day that Lord 
 Fitz Ormond judged, from his interview 
 with Tim Welby, and the recovery of his 
 long-treasured ring, that he was autho- 
 rised to call in the officers of justice to 
 seize the impostor, and detect the impos- 
 ture which had so cruelly disturbed the 
 tranquillity of his beloved Jane. 
 
 The earl, with a humanity which distin- 
 guished his noble feeling for the pitiable im- 
 becility and wretchedness of Lady Clancar- 
 ron's family, who all appeared sinking be- 
 neath the pressure of complicated guilt and 
 misery, had given necessary orders respect- 
 ing the wretched remains of Don Diego ;,

 his lordship had him removed, when his 
 own rank and character bearing weight, 
 he exerted his influence to avert the dis- 
 graceful exposure of a family he at once 
 pitied and despised ; and to avert the too 
 just verdict of felo de se, he, mentioned to 
 the jury the circumstance of the dog having 
 bitten him, when, probably, apprehension 
 might have caused a sudden frenzy ; it 
 had the desired effect, they brought it in 
 lunacy, and the funeral obsequies were 
 performed with decent privacy, and the

 CHAPTER XL 
 
 It will be naturally supposed that Don 
 Diego's death crushed every pretended 
 claim to the fortune of our heroine ; all 
 proceedings were instantly stopt, and she 
 was immediately reinstated in her here- 
 ditary possessions ; many valuable per- 
 sonals had been lost in the confusion, and 
 purloined by the dishonest, and the long 
 robed gentry endeavoured to persuade Jane 
 to commence actions against all the persons 
 implicated in the nefarious transaction, 
 assuring her she could recover heavy da- 
 mages ; but, even had she not been so 
 nearly connected with the unhappy sur-

 vivors, with certainty, she had too much 
 experienced the glorious uncertainty of the 
 law, to again involve herself in its devious 
 intricacies ; she therefore told her advisers, 
 with smiling thanks for their assurances, 
 that she was too happy in having escaped 
 the notoriety of an exhibition in West- 
 minster-hall, to hazard another so soon. 
 So with a douceur for past attentions, they 
 were obliged to depart whether quite 
 satisfied or not. 
 
 The bosom of Jane De Dunstanville 
 could not remain the residence of one 
 angry passion, beyond the moment of 
 inflicted wrong, and now, rich in every 
 earthly felicity that love, friendship, virtue, 
 rank, and fortune could bestow, her gentle 
 commiserative heart gave a sigh to the 
 wretched condition of the .Clancarron 
 family j in idea she beheld the Countess

 despised, neglected, and unpitied, sinking 
 beneath the pressure of shame, pecuniary 
 difficulties, and a sad variety of suffering ; 
 and that these accumulated evils were 
 merited, added a bitterer pang to the 
 accusing spirit, and called forth more com- 
 passion from the innately benevolent 
 heart. 
 
 The poor widowed Lady Florence, with 
 an accusing conscience, and many an angry 
 rankling passion desolating her bosom, 
 was without one hand to help, one heart to 
 feel for her accumulated calamities — the 
 contemplation excited the most generous 
 pity, and though a stranger to offence 
 herself, she felt that the forfeiture of 
 inward approbation must be the severest 
 penalty an erring being can pay, and the 
 charitable spirit will give a deeper sigh of 
 pity to the pang of conscious transgression

 Death and the shrouding grave had 
 extinguished every spark of resentment 
 towards her late, greatly culpable, husband, 
 and every wrong he had premeditated 
 against her peace and property was buried 
 in his unhonoured grave. 
 
 As for Lord Clancarron himself, he had 
 always appeared in her eyes too insignifi- 
 cant to excite any other sensation than 
 pity, and now that his nature had dis- 
 covered such depravity and unfeeling 
 meanness contempt and sorrow, mingled 
 with indignation, and produced a senti- 
 ment such as better beings feel when those 
 they would lead to virtue go astray ; these 
 and many a softening reflection blending 
 together in her gentle mind, determined 
 her to sooth them with her forgiveness, 
 and meliorate the hardness of their condi- 
 tion by her returning bounty.

 Lord Fitz Ormond smiled his approba- 
 tion ; Hildebrande's ideas were her own, 
 and Mrs. Moreland's judgment was called 
 into assist, in devising the least distressing 
 way of putting the design in execution ; 
 the council, however, was adjourned to 
 another day, for the Earl being informed 
 a young gentleman waited for an audience 
 in the library, the ladies, accompanied by 
 Mr. Fitz Ormond, Dillon, and Alfred, went 
 out for a morning ride ; the party was 
 joined in the park by Lady Ellen, and 
 high in health, happiness, and spirits, they 
 all returned together, and at six 'o'clock 
 assembled round the Earl's hospitable 
 board to dinner.

 thoughtfulness was diffused over his

 Something it was evident had occurred, 
 and though all were most anxious to know, 
 no one seemed willing to enquire what it 
 was ; at length smiling benignantly, with 
 much complacency he addressed them. 
 
 " I have had a most uncommon visitor 
 this morning/' said his lordship, in a 
 young merchant from the city ; and many 
 a sweet and bitter recollection have his 
 words and information awaked in my 
 bosom.

 earl, " that two and twenty years ago j?f

 " The dark obscurity in which my for-

 solitary wanderings of my angel Eglen-

 Heaven, and the warm shelter in which 
 my boy was reared, with the utter obli-

 generous donation unclaimed, and unpre- 
 sented till now ; but it was in the keeping 
 of honour, and now that the world 
 knows Fitz Ormond; this money with 
 its interest is honourably restored," 
 
 " How great, and nobly just, in the 
 house," cried Lady Ellen, " to restore so 
 large a sum of money, when the very 
 owner of it was ignorant of the circum- 
 stance, and never could have demanded 
 it."

 " The deed is perfectly in character 
 with the principal of that house," said 
 Alfred, almost blushing for his own in- 
 voluntary pun on the word, which, 
 though unintended, was not inapplicable 
 either to principal or principle* 
 
 " Had I not sprung from the dear 
 Highland clan myself," said Mrs. More*

 Lady Clancarron, in a burst of feeling 
 never known before, involuntarily sunk

 the only son of Earl Fitz Ormond ; and 
 it was whispered in the higher circles, 
 that the elegant Dillon Moreland, Esq. 
 would soon " step in with a receipt for 
 making smiles, and blanching sables into 
 bridal bloom ;" or, to descend from the 
 altitudes of romance, it was expected as 
 soon as Lady Ellen Stirling could, with 
 decency, throw aside her mourning habit, 
 she would figure " en bride "

 had passed the sabbath piously. 
 
 Piety had guided the earliest steps of

 Mrs. Moreland having often experienced 
 a Christian's consolation, aspired to the

 And yet while echo hung around, 
 As loth to leave the hallowed ground, 
 
 So mirthful and so gay ; 
 More swift his fingers sped along, 
 The mazes of the varied song, 
 Pure was the feeling that it gave, 
 Pure as the streamlets silver wave. 
 Pure as the fluid in mid air, 
 Pure as the soul of maiden fair, 
 Pure as fne bright ethereal ray, 
 That decks the diadem of day, 
 When rising in majestic pride, 
 He gild's the oceans rolling tide ! 
 Then as again he wakes the strings, 
 
 A feeling each attuned to move ; 
 Their cadence every passion brings, 
 
 Joy, friendship, hope, and love 
 'Twas pleasure all for no controul, 
 
 Fettered the flame as high it rose, 
 But freely o'er the raptured soul 
 
 The course of gladness flows.

 Not all the joys the mother knows, 
 
 "When cradled on her breast, 
 She lulls her infant to repose, 
 
 Her dear first born to rest j 
 Not all the self-approving joy, 
 
 Benevolence oft feels ; 
 When from her sympathetic eye, 
 
 The dew of pity steals. 
 Not these or all the joys of love, 
 Which sanguine youth can hope to prove, 
 Are aught compared to that which reigns, 
 At music's voice in nature's veins.

 But hark ! the minstrel's varied strain, 
 Now sweetly dwells on joy again, 
 Recalling many a happier hour, 
 When far beyond fate's chilling power j 
 Reckless of what she might portend,

 The minstrel was a welcome guest, 
 And there he lov'd the song to raise, 
 In his beloved chieftain's praise.

 Prey'd on his mind, he brought relief, 
 With music such as sprites to hear, 
 Might wish descent from heav'nly sphere. 
 Then, as his much-lov'd chieftain smil'd, 
 And grief by harmony beguil'd, 
 Her vanquish'd pow'r at length withdrew, 
 His eye with pleasure brighten'd, 
 
 An unfeign'd joy his bosom knew,

 And as be liv'd, he wisb'd to die, 
 Wedded from youth to minstrelsy. 
 A peaceful death with none to mourn, 
 But those who wept at friendship's urn, 
 With nought to mark his lowly grave, 
 But what his simple merit gave. 
 Three days are gone — the strain hath ceas'd, 
 Now that the bard hath sunk to rest ! 
 Where swells the sod in yonder grove, 
 He slumbers with his buried love, 
 And lo ! his lowly couch beside, 
 A willow droops in sorrow's pride. 
 On whose depending branch it hung, 
 The harp to which his Ella sung, 
 
 With such a sweet, enchanting air, 
 When oft to him, at evening hour, 
 Ere, wither'd was the cherish'd flow'r, 
 
 Her conscious bosom own'd the pow'r, 
 
 That rul'd despotic there. 
 So pass away the good, the brave, 
 Alike, they slumber in the grave. 
 Pride, lend thine ear ! that master's fire, 
 Which wont such feelings to inspire, 
 
 Lies there and now decay'd the hand, 
 
 Which bore each passion's magic wand $ 
 Then mark, if you can aught descry, 
 
 Of more than vulgar clay, 
 And learn that man was born to die, 
 That life is but a day!

 fond and faithful partners to each other,

 into their chambers, and having shut the

 charity, whose sigh is unheard, and whose 
 cheerless retreat is little known ; what

 mortal grandeur, the beam emanating from

 always past in London, and were always 
 gay and splendid ; but it was within their 
 own patrimonial boundaries, when sur- 
 rounded by their family, and a happy, 
 prosperous, and numerous tenantry, who

 looked up to them, as the healthy kindly 
 planets that shed upon them peace and 
 plenty, that Lord and Lady Arranville 
 found themselves really at home. There, 
 to their wishes height, the gentle and ge- 
 nerous pair were blessed, and in all the 
 polished and endearing pleasures of do- 
 mestic life, loved and loving, their inno- 
 cent and beneficent days glided on. 
 
 Earl Fitz Ormond happy, venerated, and 
 esteemed, lived many years in the bosom 
 of his children ; he lived to behold and 
 ble:s the third generation, and dandled in 
 his feeble arms, a great grandson, bearing 
 his own honoured name, and then, full of 
 days, and full of wisdom, in patriarchal 
 peace, he resigned a spirit, pure and puri- 
 fied as ever spirit covered with mortal 
 covering was resigned.

 grove of cypress, adjoining the abbey 
 church yard of De Dunstanville, he had 
 erected a monument, distinguished for 
 melanchoy grandeur, to the memory of 
 his sainted Eglentine ; he would not have 
 her sacred relics again disturbed nor sepa- 
 rated from the dust of her ancestors, and 
 therefore directed that his own should 
 mingle with it. 
 
 Dillon Moreland and his sensible, ele- 
 gant Ellen, lived happy, imitated and res- 
 pected ; sometimes, we must confess, he 
 would betray in: quality of temper, could 
 still be positive, and too fond of expen- 
 sive pleasures ; but instead of reproach, 
 recrimination, or even remonstrance, Lady 
 Ellen had the power to inspire him with 
 a love of all she herself loved, and by her 
 own fair and faultless example, gently led 
 him to the practice of her own virtues

 tnd moderation. She possessed the pleasing 
 happy art of teaching him greatness of 
 mind, without the pride of the heart, to 
 feel the dignity of birth, without the va- 
 nity of condition, to venerate the virtues, 
 though without the meritorious glare of. 
 human distinctions, but to despise distinc- 
 tions undignified by the virtues. Dilloa 
 Moreland, therefore, by the time he was 
 father to a third son, was in his habits 
 social, moral and, domestic; and in giving,

 always elegant, and though distinguished 
 for taste, fashion, and propriety, were al- 
 ways conducted within the limits of de--

 the kindness that could feel her own feeling. 
 She had a beautiful small gothic cottage 
 of her own on the borders of a celebrated 
 forest, yet a suite of apartments was 
 appropriated, and always ready for her 
 reception at De Dunstanville Abbey, and 
 sweet and numerous as were the sanies, 
 dimpling around the rosy lips of Jane, 
 they wore a sweeter enchantment stilly

 when the young blossoms of Fitz Or- 
 mond, with delighted voice in full chorus, 
 would shout from the windows, " Mamma 
 Moreland's carriage is come !" 
 
 Her daughters, charming, sensible, and 
 elegantly accomplished, were alike fitted' 
 to shine in the spheres of fashion, 
 and to dignify and endear the calm- 
 er scenes of domestic life, and, being 
 highly descended, and moving in the 
 superior circles, they were both most 
 respectably established, though their 
 mother was of opinion, at too early an 
 age to have attained that sobriety and 
 solidity of character so becoming and 
 necessary in a wife, and in the mistress of 
 a family. 
 
 Mr. Neville, the Navy Surgeon, was 
 neither forgotten nor neglected ; he had

 Titz Ormond's family quitted Grosvenor 
 Street, and the widow having attended 
 him with much tenderness, during a very 
 lingering fit of the gout, they became so 
 agreeable to each other, and so necessary 
 to each others convenience, that, with the 
 sanction and approbation of all their 
 friends, they married, and Lord Fitz 
 Ormond, whose grateful nature delighted 
 in generously remunerating all who had 
 any way contributed to his children's 
 comfort, settled them in the market 
 town adjoining De Dunstanville abbey, 
 and he having professional skill, and being 
 so highly patronized by the family, had 
 soon very extensive practice, and lived 
 with much respectability and comfort. 
 
 Dinah resided several years with Lady

 person, and modest and genteel in her 
 manners, a young curate, who officiated 
 for the old rector of De Dunstanville, 
 cast on the gentle maiden looks of loving 
 regard. The rector was very infirm, and 
 very soon was gathered to his fathers, 
 and Jane, ever munificent and kind, pre- 
 sented Dinah, and the rectory as her 
 wedding portion, to the young divine, 
 who nothing loth, tock the fair damsel 
 unto him, and she became his wife. 
 
 Happy and elevated beyond her most 
 sanguine expectations, the grateful and 
 meek-spirited girl, in order that she might 
 never forget herself, often remembered 
 her ill-destined sister Patty ; and when 
 that sorrow which follows unrestrained 
 passion, that disgrace which follows 
 unregulated feelings, was known in 
 the villa e, Dinah thought of Patty,

 and the sorrow was soothed, the disgrace 
 was hidden, and penitence encouraged. 
 
 Rupert Butler has progressively given 
 evidence of a superior mind, and superior 
 talents ; Dillon Moreland, in his new 
 sphere, never sought a new friend, and, 
 what is rather extraordinary in modern 
 days, among modern characters, Rupert 
 Butler never found the old one with a 
 new face. 
 
 Through Dillon's introduction, he now 
 moves in superior society, and Lord Fitz 
 Ormond always gratified in patronizing 
 merit, had him appointed travelling tutor 
 to a young nobleman, and with the ad- 
 vantages a mind like his can glean from 
 such a situation, it is expected he will 
 rank high in the world of letters, and 
 genius record his name in the page of li- 
 terature.

 CHAPTER XVI. 
 
 The darker characters, whose deeds have 
 blurred the fair page of this our history, 
 must not remain unremembered nor un- 
 noticed, for they still walk the peopled 
 earth, can still give the pang of remem- 
 brance to the innocent, the wronged, and 
 the aching heart, can still enjoy the warm 
 beams of prosperity, can still smile in the 
 proud security of human greatness, that 
 at once shrouds them from exposure, and 
 raises a brazen barrier against the feeble- 
 ness of complaint, and the bitterness of 
 unheeded claims. 
 
 The Counters of Clancarron survived 
 both her son and her daughter several 
 years ; the Earl too far, too deeply im- 
 mersed in the overwhelming vortex of a

 dissipated life, found his difficulties insur- 
 mountable, unless he had possessed the 
 resolution to change his nature, principles, 
 and habits ; — would he have submitted to 
 undergo a total reform, and a rigid eco- 
 nomy taken place of licentious pleasures 
 and expenses, his noble relatives would 
 have aided the charitable work ; but w r hile 
 he could raise money honourably or dis- 
 honourably, he never considered conse- 
 quences ; he would game, drink, and waste 
 his hours in the most shameful and aban- 
 doned profligacy, till with his constitution 
 worn out, his fortune exhausted, his cha- 
 racter destroyed, and every respectable con- 
 nection disgusted, instead of being forced 
 to a prison, or to a retreat in the highlands, 
 lie meanly and cowardly stole out of life 
 by a cup of poison, and was discovered 
 by his only remaining attendant, one 
 morning, dead in his bed.

 In life he had never given cause for 
 one honest smile ; in death he had not the 
 tribute of one sigh ; he had been a man 
 of pleasure, and met the man of pleasure's 
 doom. 
 
 Lady Florence, without one consistent 
 principle, and in her best moments a very 
 thing of the world, barely wore her sables 
 one year ; for meeting a very dashing and 
 handsome officer at a country ball, who 
 had a recruiting party near Clancarron, 
 she once more entered the lists of matri- 
 mony, and truth must allow that for two 
 years her ladyship lived respectably and 
 almost happy ; for Lord Fitz Ormond's 
 interest having promoted her husband, 
 and his nature being grateful, he repaid 
 the obligation in kindness and attention 
 to his wife ; she died, however, in giving 
 birth to a daughter, who was immediately 
 consigned to the care of her ^rand-mother,

 and afterwards inherited her mother's 
 fortune. 
 
 Lady Arranviile, who was always an 
 enthusiast in the awfully grand scenes of 
 wild and rugged nature, with her family, 
 made a tour one summer to the High- 
 lands, and passing some time at Clan- 
 carron Castle, whose antique turrets, and 
 gothic battlements, suited the temper of 
 her soul, she became very fond of her little 
 namesake, and promised to superintend 
 her education* 
 
 The old Countess lived to see her 
 grand-daughter of age, and it gratified the 
 pride of declining life, when assured by 
 Lord Fitz Ormond and Jane, that Clancar- 
 ron Castle should not pass into another 
 family. 
 
 She died, humbly resigned, and a 
 Christian.

 It has been reported, that Lord Falcon 
 found it convenient, to lately make a 
 precipitate retreat, and it was thought that 
 his lordship was literally bang-up to the 
 mark ; but whether his own inclination, 
 or any other body's inclination was most 
 impellent in hastening his return, I will 
 not assert ; nor have I heard that either 
 his barouche or bays have been again ex- 
 hibited. Who may be the biographer of 
 his latest exploits, is yet to be known. 
 Be the materials fairer than he has hitherto 
 given to compose his character ! 
 
 Rupert Brierton still lives, and still 
 wears the armour of hypocrisy; lately, 
 indeed, one of the rivets which fasten 
 this coat of mail, had nearly given way, 
 and exposed the vulnerable bosom within, 
 but gold and bank paper forming a strong 
 cement, the breast-plate is whole again.

 the recorder of these very authentic pages 
 is not without hope, that while reading

 Though last not least in this dark page 
 of iniquity, Flarehomme the attorney is 
 still alive, still practises., and is stiil em-

 when its ruthless underlings are busy, 
 his office resounds with the groans of dis-

 At his table meanness, hypocrisy, cow- 
 ardice, and vulgarity, hold their wretch-

 boxing in true Mendoza style the associate 
 of to-day, with w- :om he will sink in 
 drunkenness and gluttony to-morrow.

 Should the delineations of character 
 exhibited in these pages, have presented 
 one model for imitation, or one encou- 
 ragement for the lowliest virtue ; held up 
 a beacon to warn the foot of innocence 
 from a slippery path, restrain the vehe- 
 mence of destroying passion, soften the 
 bitterness of pride, or bend the stubborn* 
 ness of temper, I shall not have written 
 in vain. 
 
 Truth has given characters to many, and 
 the many will feel it ; and though fancy
