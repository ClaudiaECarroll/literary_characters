The Hour and The Man. 
 
 CHAPTER I. 
 
 WAITING STJPPEE. 
 
 The nights of August are in St. Domingo the hottest of the 
 year. The winds then cease to befriend the panting inhabitants; 
 and whUe the thermometer stands at 90°, there is no steady 
 breeze, as diiring the preceding months of summer. Light puffs 
 of wind now and then fan the brow of the negro, and relieve for 
 an instant the oppression of the European settler ; but they are 
 gone as soon as come, and seem only to have left the heat more 
 intolerable than before. 
 
 Of these sultry evenings, one of the sultriest was the 22nd of 
 August, 1791. This was one of five days appointed for rejoicings 
 in the town of Cap Fraugais — festivities among the French and 
 Creole inhabitants, who were as ready to rejoice on appointed 
 occasions as the dulness of colonial life renders natural, but who 
 would have been yet more lively than they were if the date of 
 their festival had been in January or May. There was no choice 
 as to the date, however. They were governed in regard to (Jieir 
 celebrations by what happened at Paris ; and never had the pro- 
 ceedings of the mother country been so important to the colony 
 as now. 
 
 During the preceding year, the white proprietors of St. 
 Domingo, who had haikd with loud voices the revolutionary 
 doctrines before which royalty had begun to succumb in Prance, 
 were astonished to find their cries of Liberty and Equality 
 adopted by some who had no business with such ideas and words. 
 The mulatto proprietors and merchants of the island ianotently 
 understood the words according to their commonly received 
 meaning, and expected an equal share with the whites in the 
 representation of the colony, in the distribution of its offices, and 
 in the civil rights of its inhabitants generally. These rights 
 having been denied by the whites to the freeborn mulattoes, with 
 every possible manifestation of contempt and dislike, an effort

10 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 had been made to ■wring from the whites by force what they 
 would not grant to reason ; and an ill-principled and ill-managed 
 revolt had taken place, in the preceding October, headed by 
 Vincent Oge and his brother, sons of the proprietress of a coffee 
 plantation, a few miles from Cap Frangais. These young men 
 were executed, under circumstances of great barbarity. Their 
 sufferings were as seed sown in the warm bosoms of their com- 
 panions and adherents, to spring up, in due season, in a harvest 
 of vigorous revenge. The whites suspected this ; and were as 
 anxious as their dusky neighbours to obtain the friendship and 
 sanction of the revolutionary government at home. That govern- 
 ment was fluctuating in its principles and in its counsels ; it 
 favoured now one paiMty, and now the other ; and on the arrival 
 of its messengers at the ports of the colony, there ensued some- 
 times the loud boastings of the whites, and sometimes quiet, 
 knowing smiles and whispered congratulations among the 
 depressed section of the inhabitants. 
 
 The cruelties inflicted on Yincent Oge had interested many 
 influential persons in Paris in the cause of the mulattoes. Great 
 zeal was exercised in attempting to put them in a condition 
 to protect themselves by equal laws, and thus to restrain the 
 tyranny of the whites. The Abbe Gregoire pleaded for them in 
 the National Assembly ; and on the 15th of March was passed 
 the celebrated decree which gave the mulattoes the privileges of 
 French citizens, even to the enjoyment of the suffrage, and to 
 the possession of seats in the parochial and colonial assemblies. 
 To Europeans there appears nothing extraordinary in the ad- 
 mission to these civil functions of freebom persons, many of 
 whom were wealthy, and many educated ; but to the whites of 
 St. Domingo the decree was only less tremendous than the rush 
 of the hurricane. 
 
 It arrived at Cap Frangais on the 30th of June, and the tidings 
 presently spread. At first, no one believed them but the mu- 
 lattoes. When it was no longer possible to doubt — when the 
 words of Robespierre passed from mouth to mouth, till even the 
 nuns told them to one another in the convent garden — " Perish 
 the colonies, rather than sacrifice one iota of our principles ! " 
 the whites trampled the national cockade under their feet in the 
 streets, countermanded their orders for the fete of the 14th of 
 July (as they now declined taking the civic oath), and proposed 
 to one another to offer their colony and their allegiance to 
 England. 
 
 They found means, however, to gratify their love of power, 
 and then- class-hatred, by means short of treason. They tried 
 disobedience first, as the milder method. The governor of the 
 colony, Blanchelande, promised that when the decree should 
 reach him officially, he would neglect it, and all applications

 from any quarter to have it enforced. This set all straight. 
 Blanchelande was pronounced a sensible and patriotic man. The 
 gentlemen shook hands warmly with him at every turn; the 
 ladies made deep and significant curtseys wherever they met 
 him ; the boys taught their little negroes to huzza at the name 
 of Blanchelande ; and the little girls called him a dear creature. 
 In order to lose no time in showing that they meant to make 
 laws for their own colony out of their own heads, and no others, 
 the white gentry hastened on the election of deputies for a new 
 General Colonial Assembly. The deputies were elected, and met, 
 to the number of a hundred and seventy-six, at Leogane, in the 
 southern region of the island, so early as the 9th of August. 
 After exchanging greetings and vows of fidelity to their class- 
 interests, under the name of patriotism, they adjourned their 
 assembly to the 25th, when they were to meet at Cap Frangais. 
 It was desirable to hold their very important session in the most 
 important place in the colony, the centre of intelligence, the 
 focus of news from Europe, and the spot where they had first 
 sympathised with the ungrateful government at home, by 
 hoisting, with their own white hands, the cap of liberty, and 
 shouting, so that the world might hear, " Liberty and Equality ! " 
 " Down with Tyranny ! " 
 
 By the 20th, the deputies were congregated at Cap Pranf ais ; 
 and daily till the great 25th were they seen to confer together in 
 coteries in the shady piazzas, or in the Jesuits' Walk, in the 
 morning, and to dme together in parties in the afternoon, 
 admitting friends and well-wishers to these tavern dinners. 
 Each day till the 25th was to be a fete-day in the town and 
 neighbourhood ; and of these days the hot 22nd was one. 
 
 Among these friends and well-wishers were the whites upon 
 all the plantations in the neighbourhood of the town. There was 
 scarcely an estate in the Plaine du Nord, or on the mountain 
 steeps which overlooked the cape, town, and bay, on all sides 
 but the north, which did not furnish guests to these dinners. 
 The proprietors, their bailiffs, the clergy, the magistrates, might 
 all be seen along the roads, in the cool of the morning ; and there 
 was a holiday air about the estates they left behind. The negroes 
 were left for this week to do their work pretty much as they 
 liked, or to do none at all. There was little time to think of 
 them, and of ordinary business, when there were the mulattoes 
 to be ostentatiously insulted, and the mother country to be defied. 
 So the negroes slept at noon, and danced at night, during these 
 few August days, and even had leave to visit one another to as 
 great an extent as was ever allowed. Perhaps they also transacted 
 other affairs of which their masters had little suspicion. 
 
 All that ever was allowed was permitted to the slaves on the 
 Breda estate, in the plain, a few miles from Cap rran9aisi The

12 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 attorney, or bailifE of the estate, M. Bayou de Libertas, was a 
 kind-hearted man, who, while insisting very peremptorily on his 
 political and social rights, and vehemently denouncing all 
 abstract enmity to them, liked that people actually about him 
 should have their own way. While ransacking his brain for terms 
 of abuse to vent on Lafayette and Oondorcet, he rarely found 
 anything harsh to utter when Caton got drunk, and spoUed his 
 dinner; when Venus sent up his linen darker than it went down 
 to the quarter, or when little Machabee picked his pocket of 
 small coin. Such a man was, of course, particularly busy this 
 week ; and of course, the slaves under his charge were particu- 
 larly idle, and particularly likely to have friends from other 
 plantations to visit them. 
 
 Some such visitor seemed to be expected by a family of these 
 Breda negroes, on the Monday evening, the 22nd. This family 
 did not live in the slave-quarter. They had a cottage near the 
 stables, as Toussaint Breda had been M. Bayou's postillion, 
 and, when he was lately promoted to be overseer, it was found 
 convenient to all parties that he should retain his dwelling, 
 which had been enlarged and adorned so as to accord with the 
 dignity of his new office. In the piazza of his dwelling sat 
 Toussaint this evening, evidently waiting for some one to arrive ; 
 for he frequently put down his book to listen for footsteps, and 
 more than once walked round the house to look abroad. His 
 wife, who was within, cooking supper, and his daughter and 
 little boy, who were beside him in the piazza, observed his rest- , 
 lessness ; for Toussaint was a great reader, and seldom looked 
 off the page for a moment of any spare hour that he might have 
 for reading either the books M. Bayou lent liim, or the three 
 or four volumes which he had been permitted to purchase for 
 himself. 
 
 " Do you see Jean P " asked the wife from within. " Shall we 
 wait supper for him ? " 
 
 "Wait a little longer," said Toussaint. "It will be strange 
 if he does not come." 
 
 "Are any more of Latour's people coming ivith Jean, mother P " 
 asked G^nifrede, from the piazza. 
 
 "No; they have a supper at Latour's to-night; and we 
 should not have thought of inviting Jean, but that he wants some 
 I conversation with your father." 
 
 " Lift me up," cried the little boy, who was trying in vain to 
 scramble up one of the posts of the piazza, in order to reach a 
 humming-bird's nest, which hung in the tendi-ils of a creeper 
 overhead, and which a light puff of wind now set swinging, so 
 as to attract the child's eye. What child ever saw a humming- 
 bird thus rocking— its bill sticking out like a long needle on 
 one side, and its tail at the other, without longing to clutch it ? 
 


## p. (#17) #################################################

TOUSSAJNT'S HOME. 1 3 
 
 So Denis cried out imperiously to be lifted up. His father set 
 him on the shelf within the piazza, where the calabashes were 
 kept — a station whf'nce he could see into the nest, and watch the 
 bird, without being able to touch it. This was not altogether 
 satisfactory. The little fellow looked about him for a calabash 
 to throw at the nest ; but his mother had carried in all her cups 
 for the service of the supper-table. As no more wind came at 
 his caU, he could only blow with all his might, to swing the ten- 
 dril again ; and he was amusing himself thus when his father 
 laid down his book, and stepped out to see once more whether 
 Jean was approaching. 
 
 " Lift me down," said the boy to his sister, when his head 
 was giddy with blowing. Geuifrede would fain have let him 
 stay where he was, out of the way of mischief ; but she saw that 
 he was really afraid of falling, and she offered her shoulders for 
 him to descend upon. When down, she would not let him 
 touch her work ; she took her scissors from his busy hands, and 
 shook him off when he tried to pull the snowberries out of her 
 hair ; so that there was nothing left for the child to play with 
 but his father's book. He was turning it over, when Toussaint 
 reappeared. 
 
 " Ha ! boy, a book in your hands already ? I hope you may 
 have as much comfort out of that book as I have had, Denis." 
 
 " What is it P what is it about P " said the boy, who had heard 
 many a story out of books from his father. 
 
 " What is it ? Let us see. I think you know letters enough 
 to spell it out for yourself. Oome and try." 
 
 The child knew the letter E, and, with a good deal of help, 
 made out, at last, Epictetus. 
 
 " What is that ? " asked the boy. 
 
 " Epictetus was a negro," said Genifrede, complacently. 
 
 " Kot a negro," said her father, smiling. " He was a slave ; 
 but he was a white." 
 
 " Is that the reason you read that book so much more than 
 any other ? " 
 
 " Partly ; but partly because I like what is in it." 
 
 " What is in it— any stories ? " asked Denis. 
 
 " It is all about bearing and forbearing. It has taught me 
 many things which you wiU have to learn by-and-by. I shall 
 teach you some of them out of this book." 
 
 Denis made all haste away from the promised instruction, and 
 his father was presently again absorbed in his book. Prom 
 respect to him, Genifrede kept Denis quiet by signs of admoni- 
 tion ; and for some little time nothing was heard but the sounds 
 that in the plains of St. Domingo never cease — the humming 
 and buzzing of myriads of insects, the occasional chattering of 
 monkeys in a neighbouring wood, and, with a passing gust, a

 chorus of frogs from a distant swamp. Unconscious of this 
 din, from being accustomed always to hear more or less of it, 
 the boy amused himself with chasing the fireflies, whose light 
 began to glance around as darkness descended. His sister was 
 poring over her work, which she was just finishing, when a 
 gleam of greenish light made both look up. It came from a 
 Eirge meteor which sailed past towards the mountains, whither 
 were tending also the huge masses of cloud which gather about 
 the high peaks previous to the season of rain and hurricanes. 
 There was nothing surprising in this meteor, for the sky was 
 full of them in August nights ; but it was very beautif id. The 
 globe of green light floated on tiU it burst above the mountains, 
 illuminating the lower clouds, and revealing along the slopes of 
 the uplands the cofCee-groves, waving and bowing their heads 
 in the wandering winds of that high region. Genifrede shivered 
 at the sight, and her brother threw himself upon her lap. Before 
 he had asked half his questions about the lights of the sky, the 
 short twilight was gone, and the evening star cast a faint shadow 
 from the tufted posts of the piazza upon the white waJl of the 
 cottage. In a low tone, full of awe, Genifrede told the boy such 
 stories as she had heard from her father of the mysteries of the 
 heavens. He felt that she trembled as she told of the northern 
 lights, which had been actually seen by some travelled persons 
 now in Cap Fran9ais. It took some time and argument to give 
 him an idea of cold countries ; but his uncle Paul, the fisher, 
 man, had seen hail on the coast, only thirty miles from hence ; 
 and this was a great step in the evidence. Denis listened with 
 aU due belief to his sister's description of those pale lights shoot- 
 ing up over the sky, tiU he cried out vehemently, " There they 
 are ! look ! " 
 
 Genifrede screamed, and covered her face with her hands ; 
 while the boy shouted to his father, and ran to call his mother 
 to see the lights. 
 
 What they saw, however, was little Kke the pale, cold rays of 
 the aurora boreaJis. It was a fiery red, which, shining to some 
 height in the air, was covered in by a canopy of smoke. 
 
 " Look up, Genifrede," said her father, laying his hand upon 
 her head. " It is a fire — a cane-field on fire." 
 
 " And houses, too — the sugar-house, no doubt," said Margot, 
 who had come out to look. " It bums too red to be canes only. 
 Can it be at Latour's % That would keep Jean from coming. — ■ 
 It was the best supper I ever got ready for him." 
 
 " Latour's is over that way," said Toussaint, pointing some 
 distance further to the south-east. " But see ! there is fire 
 there, too ! God have mercy ! " 
 
 He was silent, in mournful fear that he knew now too well the 
 reason why Jean had not come, and the nature of the conversation

REBELLION. 1 5 
 
 Jean had desired to have with him. As he stood with folded arms 
 looking from the one conflagration to the other, Genifrede clung 
 to him trembling with terror, In a quarter of an hour another 
 blaae appeared on the horizon ; and, soon after, a fourth. 
 
 " The sky is on fire," cried Denis, la more delight than fear. 
 "Look at the clouds!" And the clouds did indeed show, 
 tliroughout their huge pile, some a mild flame colom-, and others 
 a hard crimson edge, as during a stormy sunset. 
 
 "Alas! alas! this is rebellion," said Toussaint; "rebellion 
 against God and man. God have mercy! The whites have 
 risen against their king ; and now the blacks rise against them, 
 in turn. It is a great sin. God have mercy ! " 
 
 Margot wept bitterly. " Oh, what shall we do ? " she cried. 
 " What will become of us, if there is a rebellion .' " 
 
 " Be cheerful, and fear nothing," replied her husband. " I 
 have not rebelled, and I shall not. M. Bayou has taught mo 
 to bear and forbear — yes, my boy, as this book says, and as the 
 book of God says : We wiU be faithful, and fear nothing." 
 
 " But they may burn this plantation," cried Margot. " They 
 may come here, and take you away. They may ruin M. Bayou, 
 and then we may be sold away; we may be parted " 
 
 Her grief choked her words. 
 
 "Fear nothing," said her husband, with calm authority. 
 " We are in God's hand ; and it is a sin to fear His will. But 
 see I there is another fire, over towards the town." 
 
 And he called aloud the name of his eldest son, saying he 
 should send the boy with a horse to meet his master. He him- 
 self must "remain to watch at home. 
 
 Placide did not come when called, nor was he at the stables. 
 He was gone some way off, to cut fresh grass for the cattle — 
 a common night-labour on the plantation. 
 
 " Gall Isaac, then," said Toussaint. 
 
 " Run, Genifrede," said her mother. " Isaac and Aimfe are 
 in the wood. Run, Genifrede." 
 
 Genifrede did not obey. She was too much terrified to leave 
 the piazza alone ; though her father gently asked when she, his 
 eldest daughter, and almost a woman, would leave off being 
 scared on all occasions like a child. Margot went herself ; so 
 far infected with her daughter's fears as to be glad to take little 
 Denis in her hand. She was not long gone. As soon as she 
 entered the wood she heard the sound of her children's laughter 
 above the noise the monkeys made ; and she was guided by it 
 to the well. There, in the midst of the opening which let in the 
 starlight, stood the well, surrounded by the only grass on the 
 Breda estate that was always fresh and green ; and there were 
 Isaac and his inseparable companion, Aimee, making the grass 
 greener bv splashing each other with more than half the water

 tliey drew. Their bright eyes and teeth could be seen by the 
 mild light, as they were too busy with their sport to heed their 
 mother as she approached. She soon made them serious with 
 her news. Isaac flew to help his father with the horses, while 
 Aimee, a stout girl of twelve, assisted her mother in earnest to 
 draw water, and carry it home. 
 
 They found Geuifrede crouching alone in a corner of the 
 piazza. In another minute Toussaint appeared on horseback, 
 leading a saddled horse. 
 
 " I am going for M. Bayou myself," said he ; adding, as he 
 glanced round the lurid horizon, " it is not a night for boys to 
 be abroad. I shall be back in an hour. If M. Bayou comes by 
 the new road, tell him that I am gone by Madame Oge's. If 
 fire breaks out here, go into the wood. If I meet Placide, I will 
 send him home." 
 
 He disappeared under the limes in the avenue ; and his family 
 heard the pace of the horses quicken into a gallop before the 
 sound died away upon the road. 
 
 CHAPTER II. 
 
 THK EXCLTJSITES. 
 
 The party of deputies with whom M. Bayou was dining were 
 assembled at the great hotel, at the comer of Place Mont 
 Archer, at Cap rran9ais. Languidly, though gladly, did tlie 
 guests, especially those from the country, enter the hotel, over- 
 powering as was the heat of the roads and the streets. In the 
 roads, the sand lay so deep, that the progress of horsemen was 
 necessarily slow, while the sun seemed to shed down a deluge of 
 flame. In the streets, there was the shelter of the piazzas ; but 
 their piUars, if accidentally touched, seemed to burn the hand ; 
 and the hum of traffic, and the sound of feet, appeared to in- 
 crease the oppression caused by the weather. Within the hotel, 
 all was comparatively cool and quiet. The dining and drawing 
 rooms occupied by the guests adjoined each other, and presented 
 none but the most welcome images. The jalousies were nearly 
 closed ; and through the small spaces that were left open, there 
 might be seen in one direction the fountain playing in the 
 middle of the Place, and iu the other, diagonally across the Rue 
 Bspaguole, the Jesuits' Walk, an oblong square laid down iu 
 
 frass, and shaded in the midst by an avenue of palms. Imme- 
 iately opposite the hotel was the Convent of Religieuses, over 
 whose garden wall more trees were seen; so that the guests

AT DINNER. 1 7 
 
 might easily have forgotten that they were in the midst of a 
 town. 
 
 The rooms were so dark that those who entered from the 
 glare of the streets could at first see nothing. The floor was 
 dark, being of native mahogany, polished like a looking-glass. 
 The walls were green, the furniture green — everything ordered 
 in counteraction of light and heat. In the dining-room more 
 was visible ; there was the white cloth spread over the long 
 range of tables, and the plate and glass, glittering in such light 
 as was allowed to enter ; and also the gilded balustrade of the 
 gallery, to be used to-day as an orchestra. This gallery was 
 canopied over, as was the seat of the chairman, with palm 
 branches and evergreens, intermixed with fragrant shrubs, and 
 flowers of all hues. A huge bunch of peacocks' feathers was 
 suspended from the lofty ceiling ; and it was waved incessantly 
 to and fro, by strings pulled by two little negroes, at opposite 
 comers of the room, causing a continual fanning of the air, and 
 circulation of the perfumes of the flowers. The black band in 
 the orchestra summoned the company to dinner, and entertained 
 them while at it by playing the popular revolutionary airs which 
 were then resounding through the colony like the hum of its 
 insects, or the dash of its waterfalls. As they took their seats 
 to the air of the "Marseillaise Hymn," more than one of the 
 guests might be heard by his next neighbour singing to himself, 
 
 " Allons, enfans de la patrie, 
 Le jour de gloire est arrive." 
 
 Before politics, however, there was dinner to be attended to ; 
 and the first-fruits of the eloquence of the meeting was be- 
 stowed on the delicate turtle, the well-fattened land- crabs, and 
 the rich pasties — on the cold wines, the refreshing jellies, and 
 the piles of oranges, figs, and almonds, pomegranates, melons, 
 and pine-apples. The first vote of compliment was to Henri, the 
 black cook from St. Christophe, whence he had been brought 
 over by the discerning hotel-keeper, who detected his culinary 
 genius while Henri was yet but a lad. When the table was 
 cleared, a request was sent up to the chairman from various 
 parties at the table, that he would command Henri's attendance, 
 to receive the testimony of the company respecting the dinner 
 he had sent up, and to take a glass of wine from them. 
 
 Dr. Protean, the chairman, smilingly agreed, saying that such 
 a tribute was no more than Henri's professional excellence and 
 high reputation deserved; and Henri was accordingly summoned 
 by a dozen of the giinning black waiters, who ran over one 
 another in their haste to carry to the kitchen the message of 
 these, the highest gentry of the land. The waiters presently

 poured into the room again, and stood in two rows from the 
 door, where Henri appeared, not laaghing like the rest, but per- 
 fectly grave, as he stood, white apron on, and napkin over his 
 arm, his stout and taU figure erect, to receive the commands of 
 his masters. 
 
 " Was your father a cook or a gourmand, Henri P Or are yon 
 all good cooks at St. Ohristophe P " asked a deputy. 
 
 " If it is the air of St. Ohristophe that makes men such cooks 
 as Henri, the knights of St. John of Malta had a goodly gift in 
 it," said another. 
 
 " Can one get such another as you for money, Henri P " asked 
 a third. 
 
 " How many hoys has your wife brought you, Henri P We 
 shall bid high for them, and make your master's fortune, if he 
 trains them aU. to your profession," said a fourth. 
 
 " Tell your master he had better not part with you for any 
 sum, Henri. We will make it worth his while to refuse more 
 for yon than was ever offered yet." 
 
 " Tour health, Henri ! May you live out all the turtle now 
 in St. Domingo, and the next generation after them." 
 
 Amidst all these questions and remarks, Henri escaped an- 
 swering any. He stood looking on the ground, till a glass of 
 champagne was brought to him, bowed to the company, drank it 
 off, and was gone. 
 
 " How demure the fellow looks ! " said M. Papalier, a planter, 
 to Bayou, his neighbour in the plain, who now sat opposite to 
 him ; " what an air of infinite modesty he put on ! At this 
 moment, I daresay he is snapping his fingers, and telling the 
 women that aU the money in St. Domingo won't buy him." 
 
 " Tou are mistaken there," said Bayou. " He is a singular 
 fellow, is Henri, in more ways than his cookery. I believe he 
 never snapped his fingers in his life, nor told anybody what his 
 master gave for him. I happen to know Henri very well, from 
 his being an acquaintance of my overseer, who is something of 
 the same sort, only superior even to Henri." 
 
 " The fellow looked as if he would have given a great deal 
 more than his glass of wine to have stayed out of the room," 
 observed M. Leroy. " He has nothing of the mulatto in him, 
 has he P Pure African, I suppose." 
 
 "Pure African — all safe," replied Bayou. "But observe! 
 the music has stopped, and we are going on to the business of 
 the day. Silence, there ! Silence, aU ! " 
 
 Everybody said " Silence ! " and Dr. Protean rose. 
 
 He declared himself to be in a most remarkable situation — 
 one in which he was sure every Frenchman present would sym- 
 pathise with him. Here he stood, chairman of a meeting of the 
 most loyal, the most spirited, the most patriotic citizens of the

DR. PROTEAU S SPEECH. 1 9 
 
 empire, chairman of an assemblage of memljers of a colonial 
 piii-liamcnt, and of their guests and friends — here he stood, in 
 this capacity, and yet he was unable to propose any one of the 
 loyal toasts by wliich it liad, till now, been customary to sanc- 
 tion their social festiyities. As for the toast, now never more 
 to be heard from their lips — the health of the king and royal 
 family — the less that was said about that the better. The times 
 of oppression were passing away; and he, for one, would not 
 dim the brightness of the present meeting by recaUiug from 
 the horizon, where it was just disappearing, the tempest cloud 
 of tyranny, to overshadow the young sunshine of freedom. 
 There had been, however, another toast, to which they had been 
 wont to respond with more enthusiasm than was ever won by 
 despotic monarchy from its slaves. ' There had been a toast to 
 which this lofty roof had rung again, and to haU which every 
 voice had been loud, and every heart had beat high. Nei- 
 ther could he now propose that toast. With grief which 
 consumed his soul, he was compelled to bury in silence — the 
 silence of mortification, the silence of contempt, the silence of 
 detestation — the name of the National Assembly of Prance. 
 His language might appear strong; but it was mild, it was 
 moderate ; it was, he might almost say, cringing, in comparison 
 with what the National Assembly had deserved. He need not ' 
 occupy the time of his friends, nor harrow their feelings, by a 
 narrative of the injuries their colony had sustained at the hands 
 of the French National Assembly. Those around him knew 
 too well, that in return for their sympathy in the humbling of a 
 despot, for their zeal in behalf of the eternal principles of free- 
 dom, the mother country had, through the instrumentality of 
 its National Council, endeavoured to strip its faithfid whites in 
 this colony of the power which they had always possessed, and 
 which was essential to their very existence in their ancient 
 prosperity — the exclusive power of making or enforcing laws 
 for their own community. The attempt was now made, as they 
 too well knew, to wrest this sacred privilege from their hands, 
 by admitting to share it a degraded race, before whose inroads 
 would perish all that was most dear to his fellow-citizens and 
 to himself — the repose of their homes, the security of theii 
 property, the honour of their colour, and the prosperity of the 
 colony. He rejoiced to see around him, and from his heart he. 
 bade them welcome, some fellow-labourers with himself in the 
 glorious work of resisting oppression, and defending their ancient 
 privileges, endeared to them by as many ages as had passed 
 since distinctions of colour were made by an Almighty hand. 
 He invited them to pledge themselves with him to denounce and 
 resist such profane, such blasphemous innovations, proposed by 
 shallow enthusiasts, seconded by designing knaves, and destined

 to be wrouglit out by the agency of demons — demons in human 
 form. He called upon all patriots to join Mm in Ms pledge ; 
 and in token of their faith, to drink deep to one now more de- 
 serving of their homage than was ever king or National Assem- 
 yy — lie need not say that he aUuded to the noblest patriot in the 
 colony — its guardian, its saviour — Grovemor Blanchelande. 
 
 The gentleman who rose, amidst the cheers and jingling^ of 
 glasses, to say a few words to this toast, was a man of some im- 
 portance in the colony as a member of its Assembly, though he 
 otherwise held no higher rank than that of attorney to the estate 
 of M. Gallifet, a rich absentee. Odeluc was an old resident, and 
 (though zealous for the privileges of the whites) a favourite with 
 men of aU colours, and therefore entitled to be listened to by all 
 with attention, when he spoke on the conflicting interests of 
 races. However Ms opinions might please or displease, all liked 
 to look upon his bright countenance, and to hear his lively voice. 
 Vincent Oge had said that Odeluc was a worse foe to the mulat- 
 toes than many a worse man — he always so excited their good- 
 will as to make them forget their rights. 
 
 As he now rose, the air from the peacock-fan stirring the wMte 
 hair upon his forehead (for in the heats of St. Domingo it was 
 permitted to lay wigs aside), and the good wine animating yet 
 further the spirit of his lively countenance, Odeluc was received 
 with a murmur of welcome, before he opened his lips to speak. 
 
 " I must acknowledge, my fellow-citizens," said he, " I never 
 was more satisfied with regard to the state of our colony than 
 now. We have had our troubles, to be sure, like the mother 
 country, and like aU countries where portions of the people 
 struggle for power which they ought not to have. But we have 
 settled that matter for ourselves, by the help of our good Gover- 
 nor, and I firmly believe that we are at the commencement of a 
 long age of peace." 
 
 Here some applauded, while two or three shook their heads. 
 Odeluc continued — 
 
 " I see some of my friends do not altogether share my hopes. 
 Tet are these hopes not reasonable ? The Governor has himself 
 assured me that nothing shall induce Mm to notice the obnoxious 
 decree, till he has, in the first place, received it under all the 
 ofBcial forms — in the next place, vrritten his remonstrance to 
 the government at home — and, in the third place, received an 
 answer. Now, all this will take some time. In three days, we 
 deputies shall Isegin our session ; and never were the members 
 of any assembly more united in their will and in their views, and 
 therefore more powerful. We meet for the express purpose of 
 neutralising the effects of this ill-judged decree ; we have the 
 power — we have the will — and who can doubt the results .f The 
 management of this colony has always succeeded well in the

 hands of the wliites; they have made its laws, and enforced 
 them — ^they have allowed the people of colour liberty to pursue 
 their own business, and acquire property if they could, conscious 
 of strength to restrain their excesses, if occasion should arise : 
 and, as for the negro population, where in the world were affairs 
 ever on a better footing between the masters and their force than 
 in the colony of St. Domingo p If all has worked so well hitherto, 
 is it to be supposed that an ignorant shout ui the National As- 
 sembly, and a piece of paper sent over to ns thence, can destroy 
 the harmony, and overthrow the prosperity which years have 
 confirmed ? I, for one, will never believe it. I see before me 
 in my colleagues men to whom the tranquillity of the colony 
 may be safely confided; and over their heads, and beyond the 
 ■(vise laws they are about to pass for the benefit of both the 
 supreme and subordinate interests of our community, I see, 
 stretching beyond the reach of living eye, a scene of calm and 
 fruitful prosperity in which our children's children may enjoy 
 their lives, without a thought of fear or apprehension of change. 
 Regarding Governor Blanchelande as one of the chief securities 
 of this our long tenure of social prosperity, I beg to propose, not 
 only that we shall now drink his health, but that we shall meet 
 annually in his honour on this day. ■ Tender is Governmeni; 
 House. If we open our jalousies wide enough, and give the 
 honours loudly enough, perhaps our voices may reach his ears, 
 as the loyal greeting that he deserves." 
 
 " Do not you smell smoke? " asked Bayou of his neighbour, 
 as the blinds were thrown open. 
 
 " What a smell of bui-ning ! " observed the chairman to Odeluc 
 at the same moment. 
 
 " They are burning field-trash outside the town, no doubt," 
 Odeluc answered. " We choose the nights when there is little 
 wind, you know, for that work." 
 
 There was a small muster of soldiers round the gates of 
 G-overnment House, and several people in the streets, when the 
 honours were given to the Governor's name. But the first 
 seemed not to hear, and the others did not turn their heads. 
 The air that came in was so hot, that the blinds were imme- 
 diately ordered to be closed again. The waiters, however, 
 seemed to have lost their obsequiousness, and many orders and 
 oaths were spent upon them before they did their duty. 
 
 While the other gentlemen sat down, a young man remained 
 standing, his eyes flashing, and his countenance heated, either 
 by wine, or by the thoughts with which he seemed big. 
 
 " My fellow-citizens," said M. Brelle, beginning in a very loud 
 voice, " agreeing as I do in my hopes for this colony with M. 
 Odeluc, and, like him, trusting in the protection and blessingof 
 a just Providence, which wiU preserve our rights, and chastise

 those wlio would infringe them — ^feeling thus, and thus trust, 
 ing, there is a duty for me to perform. My friends, we must not 
 permit the righteous chastisements of Providence to pass by 
 unheeded, and be forgotten. The finger of Providence has been 
 among us, to mark out and punish the guilty disturber of our 
 peace. But, though dead, that guilty traitor has not ceased to 
 disturb our peace. Do we not know that his groans have moved 
 our enemies in the National Assembly — that his ashes have been 
 stirred up there, to shed their poison over our names ? It be- 
 comes us, in gratitude to a preserving Providence, in fidelity to 
 that which is dearer to us than life — our fair fame — ^in regard 
 to the welfare of our posterity, it becomes us to mark our 
 reprobation of treason and rebellion, and to perpetuate in 
 ignominy the name of the rebel and the traitor. Fill your 
 glasses, then, gentlemen, and drink — drink deep with me — 
 Our curse on the memory of Yinoent Oge ! " 
 
 Several members of the company eagerly filled their glasses ; 
 others looked doubtfully towards the chair. Before Dr. Proteau 
 seemed to have made up his mind what to do, M. Papalier had 
 risen, saying, in a rather low and conversational tone — 
 
 " My young friend will allow me to suggest to him the 
 expediency of withdrawing his toast, as one in which his fellow- 
 citizens cannot all cordially join. We all unite, doubtless, in 
 reprobating treason and rebellion in the person of Oge ; but I, 
 for one, cannot think it good, either in taste or in policy, to curse 
 the memory of the dead in the hearing of those who desire mercy 
 for their fallen enemies (as some here present do), or of others 
 who look upon Oge as no criminal, but a martyr — which is, I 
 fear, the case with too many outside." He pointed to the 
 windows as he spoke, where it now appeared that the jalousies 
 had been pushed a little open, so as to allow opportunity for 
 some observation from without. M. Papalier lowered his tone, 
 so as to be heard, during the rest of his speech, only by those 
 who made every effort to catch his words. Not a syllable could 
 be heard in the orchestra outside, or even by the waiters ranged 
 against the wall; and the chairman and others at the extremities 
 of the table were obliged to lean forwards to catch the meaning 
 of the speaker, who proceeded — 
 
 " No one more heartily admires the spirit and good-humour of 
 our friend, M. Odeluc, than myself : no one more enjoys being 
 animated by the hilarity of his temper, and carried away by the 
 hopeful enthusiasm which makes him the dispenser of happiness 
 that he is. But I cannot always sympathise in Ms bright 
 anticipations. I own I cannot to-day. He may be right. God 
 grant he be so ! But I cannot take M. Odeluc's word for it, 
 when words so different are spoken elsewhere. There are 
 observers at a distance— impartial lookers-on, who predict (and

IMPENDING DANGER. 23 
 
 I fear there are signs at home which indicate) that our position 
 is far from secure — our prospects far other than serene. There 
 are those who believe that we are in danger from other foes than 
 
 the race of Oge ; and facts have arisen but enough. This is 
 
 not the time and place for discussion of that point. Suffice it 
 now that, as we all know, observers at a distance can often see 
 deeper and farther than those involved in affairs ; and that 
 Mirabeau has said — and what Mirabeau says is, at least, worth 
 attention — Mirabeau has said of us, in connection with the events 
 of last October, ' They are sleeping on the margin of Vesuvius, 
 and the first jets of the volcano are not sufficient to awaken 
 them.' In compliment to Mirabeau," he concluded, smiling, 
 and bowing to M. Brelle, " if not in sympathy with what he 
 may think my needless caution, I hope my young friend will 
 reserve his wine for the next toast." 
 
 M. BreUe bowed, rather sulkily. No one seemed ready at the 
 moment to start a new subject. Some attacked M. Papalier in 
 whispers for what he had said ; and he to defend himself, told, 
 also in whispers, facts of the murder of a bailiff on an estate 
 near his own, and of suspicious cii'cumstances attending it, 
 which made him and others apprehend that all was not right 
 among the negroes. His facts and surmises weni round. As, 
 in the eagerness of conversation, a few words were occasionally 
 spoken aloud, some of the party glanced about to see if the 
 waiters were within earshot. They were not. There was not a 
 negro in the apartment. The band had gone out unnoticed ; to 
 refresh themselves, no doubt. 
 
 Odeluc took the brief opportunity to state his confidence that 
 all doubts of the fidelity of the negroes were groundless. He 
 agreed with M. Papalier that the present was not the time and 
 place for entering at large into the subject. He would only just 
 say that he was now an old man, that he had spent his fife 
 among the people alluded to, and knew them well, if any man 
 did. They were revengeful, certainly, upon occasion, if harshly 
 treated ; but, otherwise, and if not corrupted by ignorant dema- 
 gogues and designing agents, they were the most tractable and 
 attached people on earth. He was confident that the masters in 
 St. Domingo had nothing to fear. 
 
 He was proceeding ; but he perceived that the band was re- 
 entering the orchestra, and he sat down abruptly. 
 
 The chairman now discovered that it had grown very dark, 
 and called out for lights. His orders were echoed by several of 
 the party, who hoped that the lights would revive some of the 
 spirit of the evening, which had become very flat. 
 
 While waiting for lights, the jalousies were once more opened, 
 by orders from the chair. The apartment was instantly per- 
 vaded by a duU, changeful, red light, derived from the sky,

 which glowed above the trees of the Jesuits' Walk with tlie 
 l-eflection of extensive fires. The guests were rather startled, too, 
 by perceiving that the piazza was crowded with heads ; and that 
 dusky faces, in countless number, were looking in upon them, 
 and had probably been watching them for some time past. 
 "With the occasional pufEs of wind, which brought the smell of 
 burning, came a confused murmur, from a distance, as of voices, 
 the tramp of many horses in the sand, and a multitude of feet 
 in the streets. This was immediately lost in louder souuds. 
 The band struck up, unbidden, with all its power, the Mar- 
 seillaise Hymn; and every voice in the piazza, aud, by degrees, 
 along the neighbouring streets and square, seemed to join in 
 singing the familiar words — 
 
 " Aliens enfans de la patrie, 
 Le jour de gloire est arrive." 
 
 The consternation of the deputies and their guests was ex- 
 treme. Every man showed his terror in his own way ; but one 
 act was imiversal. Each one produced arms of one sort or 
 another. Even Odeluc, it appeared, had not come unarmed. 
 While they were yet standing in groups about the table, the door 
 burst open, and a negro, covered with dust and panting with 
 haste, ran in and made for the head of the table, thrusting him- 
 self freely through the parties of gentlemen. The chairman, at 
 sight of the man, turned pale, recoiled for a moment, and then, 
 swearing a deep oath, drew the short sword he wore, and ran 
 the negro through the body. 
 
 " Oh, master ! " cried the poor creature, as his life ebbed out in 
 the blood which inundated the floor. 
 
 The act was not seen by those outside, as there was a screen 
 of persons standing between the tables and the windows. To 
 this accident it was probably owing that the party survived that 
 hour, and that any order was preserved in the town. 
 
 " Shame, Protean ! shame ! " said Odeluc, as he bent down, 
 and saw that the negro was dying. Papalier, Bayou, and a few 
 more, cried " Shame ! " also ; while others applauded. 
 
 '' I will defend my deed," said Protean, struggling with the 
 hoarseness of his voice, and pouring out a glass of wine to clear 
 his throat. His hand was none of the steadiest as he did so. 
 " Hush that band ! There is no hearing oneself speak. Hush! 
 I say; stop!" and swearing, he passionately shook his fist 
 at the musicians, who were still making the air of the Mar- 
 seillaise peal through the room. They instantly stopped, and 
 departed. 
 
 " There ! you have sent them out to tell what you have done," 
 observed a deputy. 
 
 " I will defend my deed," Protean repeated, when he had

 swallowed the wine, "I am confident the negroes have risen. 
 I am confident the fellow came with bad intent." 
 
 " No fear but the negroes will rise, anywhere in the world, 
 where they have such as you for masters," said Odeluo. 
 
 " What do you mean, sir ? " cried Proteau, laying his hand on 
 the hilt of his dripping sword. 
 
 " I mean what I say. And I wiU tell you, too, what I do not 
 mean. I do not mean to fight to-night with any white ; and 
 least of all with one who is standing in a pool of innocent blood, 
 of his own shedding." And he pointed to Proteau's feet, which 
 were indeed soaked with the blood of his slave. 
 
 " Hush ! hush ! gentlemen ! " cried several voices. " Here is 
 more news ! " 
 
 " Hide the body ! " said Bayou, and as he spoke he stooped 
 to lift it. M. BreUe made shorter work. He rolled it over 
 with his foot, and kicked it under the table. It was out of sight 
 before the master of the hotel entered, followed by several 
 negroes from the plain, to say that the " force " had risen on 
 several plantations, had dismantled the mills, burned the sugar- 
 houses, set fije to the crops, murdered the overseers, and, he 
 feared, in some cases, the proprietors. 
 
 " Where ? " " Whose estates ? " " What proprietors ? " asked 
 eveiy voice present. 
 
 " Where did it begin ? " was the question the landlord applied 
 himself first to answer. 
 
 " It broke out on the Noe estate, sir. They murdered the 
 refiner and his apprentice, and carried off the surgeon. They 
 left another young man for dead; but he got away, and told the 
 people on the next plantation ; but it was too late then. They 
 had reached M. Clement's by that time, and raised his people. 
 They say M. Clement is killed ; but some of his fainily escaped. 
 They are here in the town, I believe." 
 
 Some of the deputies now snatched their hats, and went out 
 to learn where the fugitives were, and thus to get information, 
 if possible, at first hand. 
 
 " All is safe in oar quarter, at present, I trust," said Papalier 
 to Bayou ; " but shall we be gone ? Tour horse is here, I sup- 
 pose. We can ride together." 
 
 " In a moment. Let us hear all we can first," replied Bayou. 
 
 " Do you stay for that purpose, then, and look to our horses. 
 I will learn what the Governor's orders are, and come here for 
 you presently." And Papalier was gone. 
 
 When Bayou turned to listen again, Odeluc was saying — 
 
 " Impossible ! incredible ! GaUifet's force risen ! Not they 1 
 They would be fii-m if the world were crushed flat. Why, they 
 love me as if I were their father ! " 
 
 " Nevertheless, sir, you owe your safety to being my gueat,"

 said the landlord, with a bow as polite as on the most festive 
 occasion. " I am happy that my roof should — " 
 
 " Who brought this report P " cried Odelue. " Who can 
 give news of Gallifet's negroes ? " And he looked among the 
 black faces which were clustered behind the landlord. No one 
 spoke thence ; but a voice from the piazza said — 
 
 " Gallifet's force has risen. The canes are all on fire." 
 
 " I will bring them to their senses," said Odelue, with 
 sudden quietness. " I have power over them. The Governor 
 will give me a handful of men from the town guard, and we 
 shall set things straight before morning. The poor fellows have 
 been carried away, while I was not there to stand by them — but 
 maldng speeches here, like a holiday fool ! I wiU bring them to 
 their senses presently. Make way, friends — make way." 
 
 And Odelue stepped out among the blacks on the piazza, 
 that being the shortest way to Government House. 
 
 " I hope he is not too confident," whispered a town deputy to 
 a friend from the south. "But this is bad news. Gallifet's 
 plantation is the largest in the plain, and only eight miles ofP." 
 
 A sort of scream, a cry of horror, from one who stood close 
 by, stopped the deputy. 
 
 " Boirien ! what is the matter P " cried a deputy, as Boirien 
 hid his face with his arms upon the table, and a strong shudder 
 shook his whole frame. 
 
 " Do not speak to him ! I will tell you," said another. " Oh, 
 this is horrible ! They have murdered his brother-in-law on 
 Flaville's estate, and carried ojBE his sister and her three 
 daughters into the woods. Something must be done directly. 
 Boirien, my poor fellow, I am going to the Governor. Soldiers 
 shall be sent to bring your sister into the town. We shall have 
 her here before morning ; and you must bring her and her family 
 to my house." 
 
 No one could endure to stay and hear more. Some went to 
 learn elsewhere the fate of those in whom they were interested. 
 Some went to offer their services to the Governor; some to 
 barricade their own houses in the town ; some to see whether it 
 was yet possible to entrench their plantations. Some declared 
 their intention of conveying the ladies of their families to the 
 convent ; the place always hitherto esteemed safe, amidst all 
 commotions. It soon appeared, however, that this was not the 
 opinion of the sisters themselves, on the present occasion, nor 
 of the authorities of the town ; for the muffled nuns were seen 
 hurrying down to the quay, under the protection of soldiers, in 
 order to talve refuge on board the vessels in the bay. All night 
 long, boats were plying in the harbour, conveying womou, 
 children, plate, and money, on board the ships which happened 
 to be in the roads.

HENRI PROVES USEFUL. 2/ 
 
 The_ landlord would have been glad of the help of any of his 
 guests, in clearing his house ; but they had no sympathy to spare — 
 no time to think of his plate and wines. As the whites disappeared 
 from the room, the blacks poured in. They allowed the land- 
 lord to sweep away his plate, but they laid hands on the wines ; 
 and many a smart speech, and many a light laugh, resounded 
 within those walls till morning, while consternation reigned 
 without. When these thoughtless creatures sauntered to their 
 several homes in the sunrise, they found that such of their 
 fellow-servants as they had been accustomed to look up to, as 
 abler and more trusted than themselves, bad disappeared, and 
 no one would teU whither they were gone — only that they were 
 quite safe. 
 
 When M. Papalier returned to the hotel, from his cruise for 
 information, he found his neighbour Bayou impatiently waiting 
 on horseback, while Henri, still in his white apron, was holding 
 the other horse. 
 
 " Here, sir — mount, and let us be off," cried Bayou. " We 
 owe it to my friend Henri, here, that we have our horses. 
 The gentlemen from the country very naturally took the first 
 that came to hand to get home upon. They say Leroy is gone 
 home on a dray-mule. I rather expect to meet Toussaint on 
 the road. If he sees the fires, he will be coming to look after 
 me." 
 
 " He cannot well help seeing the fires," replied Papalier. 
 " They are climbing up the mountain-side, all the way along the 
 Hau.t du Cap. We shall be singed like two porkers, if we do 
 not ride like two devils ; and then we shall be lucky if we do not 
 meet two thousand devils by the way." 
 
 " Do you suppose the road is safe, Henri P " asked Bayou. 
 " I know you will tell me truth." 
 
 " Indeed, master, I know nothing," replied Henri. " You 
 say you shall meet Toussaint. I will I'ide with you till you 
 meet him, if you will. Our people all know him and me." 
 
 " Do so, Henri. Do not wait to look for another horse. 
 Jump up behind me. Mine is a strong beast, and will make no 
 difficulty, even of your weight. Never mind your apron. Keep 
 it for a flag of truce, in case we meet the enemy." 
 
 They were off, and presently emerged from the comparative 
 darkness of the streets into the light of the fires. None of the 
 three spoke, except to urge on the horses up the steep, sandy 
 I'oad, which first presented an ascent from the town, and then a 
 descent to the plain, before it assumed the level which it then 
 preserved to the foot of the opposite mountains, nearly fifty miles 
 off. No one appeared on the road; and the horsemen had, 
 therefore, leisure to cast glances behind them, as they were slowly 
 carried up the ascent. The alarm-bell was now sending its

28 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 sullen sounds of dismay far and wide in the air, whose stillness 
 was becoming more and more disturbed by the draughts of the 
 spreading fires, as the canes caught, like torches, up the slopes 
 to the right. Pale twinkling lights, sprinkled over the cape and 
 the harbour — lights which looked like glow-worm tapers amidst 
 the fiery atmosphere, showed that every one was awake and 
 stirring in the town, and on board the ships; while an occasional 
 rocket, mounting in the smoky air, from either the Barracks or 
 Government House, showed that it was the intention of the 
 authorities to intimate to the inhabitants of the remoter districts 
 of the plain that the Government was on the alert, and pro- 
 viding for the public safety. 
 
 On surmounting the ridge, Henri stretched out his hand, and 
 pulled the bridle of M. Bayou's horse to the left, so as to turr. it 
 into a narrow, green track which here parted from the road. 
 
 " What now, sir ? " cried Papalier, in a tone of suspicion, 
 checking his horse, instead of following. 
 
 " You may, perhaps, meet two thousand devils, if you keep 
 the high road to the plain," answered Henri, quietly. To M 
 Bayou he explained that Toussaint would probably choose this 
 road, through Madame Og6's plantation. 
 
 " Oome on, Papalier; do not lose time. All is right enough," 
 said Bayou. " The grass-tracks are the safest to-night, depend 
 upon it." 
 
 Papalier followed, in discontented silence. In a few moments, 
 Henri again pulled the bridle — a decided check this time — ' 
 stopping the horse. 
 
 " Voices," he whispered. Bayou could hear none. In a 
 moment, Henri continued. 
 
 " It is Toussaint. I thought we should meet him hereabouts.'' 
 
 The next turn of the path brought them upon Toussaint, who 
 was advancing with the Ted horse from Breda. Not far behind 
 him was Madame Og^'s house, the door standing wide, and, seen 
 by the light within, a woman in the doorway. Toussaint pulled 
 up, Henri leaped down, and ran to shake hands with his 
 friend. Papalier took the opportunity to say, in a low voice, 
 to Bayou — 
 
 " Y"ou must send your fellow there on board ship. Toumust, 
 there is no doubt of it. The Governor, and all the householders 
 in Cap, are doing so with their cleverest negroes ; and if there is 
 a clever one in the colony, it is Toussaint." 
 
 " I shall do no such thing," said Bayou. " I have trusted 
 Toussaint for these thirty years ; and I shall not distrust him 
 now — now when we most need those we can best confide in." 
 
 " That is exactly what M. Clement said of his postillion ; and 
 it was his postillion that struck him to the heart. Tou must 
 send Toussaint on board ship ; and I will tell you how "

MADAME 0G&. 29 
 
 Papalier stopped, perceiving that the two negroes were not 
 talking, but had their eyes fixed on him. 
 
 " What is that ? " said Henri. " Is Toussaint to go on board 
 shipP" 
 
 " No, no ; nonsense," said Bayou ; " I am not going to send 
 anybody on board ship. All quiet at Breda, I suppose, 
 Toussaint P " 
 
 " All quiet, sir, at present. M. Papalier — on board ship I 
 wiU not go." 
 
 " As your master pleases. It is no concern of mine, Tons, 
 saint," said Papalier. 
 
 " So I think," replied Toussaint. 
 
 " Tou see your faithful hands, your very obedient friends, 
 have got a will of their own already," whispered Papalier to 
 Bayou, as they set their horses forward again ; Henri turning 
 homewards on the tired horse which had carried double, and 
 Bayou mounting that which Toussaint had brought. 
 
 " Will you go round, or pass the house ? " Toussaint asked of 
 his master. " Madame Oge is standing in the doorway." 
 
 Bayou was about to turn his horse's head, but the person in 
 the doorway came out into the darkness, and called him by his 
 name. He was obliged to go forward. 
 
 " Madame," said he, " I hope you have no trouble with your 
 people. I hope your people are all steady." 
 
 " Never mind me and my people," replied a tremulous voice. 
 " What I want to know is, what has happened at Oap. Who 
 have risen P Whose are these tires P " 
 
 " The negroes have risen on a few plantations : that is all. 
 We shall soon " 
 
 " The negroes ! " echoed the voice. " Tou are sure it is only 
 the negroes ? " 
 
 " Only the negroes, madame. Can I be of service to you P If 
 you have any reason to fear that your force " 
 
 " I have no reason to fear anything. I will not detain you. 
 No doubt you are wanted at home, M. Bayou." 
 
 And she re-entered her house, and closed the doors. 
 
 " How you have disappointed her ! " said Papalier. " She 
 hoped to hear that her race had risen, and were avenging her 
 sons on us. I am thankful to-night," he continued, after a 
 pause, " that my little girls are at Paris. How glad might that 
 poor woman have been, if her sons had stayed there ! Strange 
 enough, Paris is called the very centre of disorder, and yet it 
 seems the only place for our sons and daughters in these days." 
 " And strangely enough," said Bayou, " I am glad that I have 
 neither wife, son, nor daughter. I felt that, even while Odeluc 
 was holding forth about the age of security which we were 
 now entering upon — I felt at the moment that there must be

 something wrong ; that all could not be right, when a man feels 
 glad that he has only himself to take care of. Our negroes are 
 bettor off than we, so far. Hey, Toussaint ? " 
 
 " I think so, sir.'' 
 
 " JEow many wives and children have you, Toussaint ? " asked 
 Papalier. 
 
 " I have five children, sir." 
 
 " And how many wives in your time P " 
 
 Toussaint made no answer. Bayou said for him — 
 
 " He has such a good wife that he never wanted more. He 
 married her when he was five-and-twenty — did not you, 
 Toussaint ? " 
 
 Toussaint had dropped into the rear. His master observed 
 that Toussaint was rather romantic, and did not like jesting on 
 domestic afeirs. He was more prudish about such matters than 
 whites fresh from the mother country. Whether he had got it 
 out of his books, or whether it really was a romantic attachment 
 to his wife, there was no knowing ; but he was quite unlike his 
 race generally in family matters. 
 
 "Does he take upon himself to be scandalised at us ? " asked 
 Papalier. 
 
 " I do not ask him. But if you like to consult him about 
 your Therese, I do not doubt he will tell you his mind." 
 
 " Oome, cannot we go on faster ? This is a horrid road, to 
 be sure ; but poor Therese will think it is all over with me, if she 
 looks at the red sky towards Cap." 
 
 There were reasons enough for alarm about M. Papalier's 
 safety, without looking over towards Cap. When the gentlemen 
 arrived at Ai-abie, his ]plantatiou, they found tlie iron gates 
 down, and lying on the grass — young trees hewn down, as if for 
 bludgeons — the cattle couched in the cane-fields, lapped in the 
 luxury of the sweet tops and sprouts — the doors of the sugar- 
 house and mansion removed, the windows standing wide, and 
 no one to answer call. The slave-quarter also was evidently 
 deserted. 
 
 Papalier clapped spurs to his horse, and rode round, faster 
 than his companions could follow him. At length Bayou inter- 
 cepted his path at a sharp turn, caught his bridle, and said — 
 
 " My dear fellow, come with me. There is nothing to be 
 done here. Tour people are all gone ; and if they come back, 
 they will only cut your throat. You must come with me ; and 
 under the circumstances, I cannot stay longer. I ought to be at 
 home." 
 
 " True, true. Go, and I will follow. I must find out whether 
 tbey have carried oH Th&ese. I must, and I will." 
 
 Toussaint pricked his horse into the court-yard, and after a 
 searching look around dragged out fi-om behind the well a

 yoimg' negress who had been crouching there, with an infant in 
 her arms. She shrieked and struggled till she saw Papalicr, 
 wlien she rushed towards him. 
 
 " Poor Therese ! " cried he, patting her shoulder. " How we 
 have frightened you ! There is nobody here but friends. At 
 least, so it seems. Where are all the people ? And who did 
 this mischief ? " 
 
 The young creature trembled excessively ; and her terror 
 marred for the time a beauty which was celebrated all over the 
 district — a beauty which was admitted as fully by the whites as 
 by people of her own race. Her features were now convulsed by 
 fear, as she told what had happened — that a body of negroes had 
 come, three hours since, and had summoned Papalier's people to 
 meet at Latour's estate, where all the force of the plain was to 
 unite before morning — that Papalier's people made no diificulty 
 about going, only stopping to search the house for what arms 
 and ammxmition might be there, and to do the mischief which 
 now appeared — that she believed the whites at the sugar-house 
 must have escaped, as she had seen and heard nothing of blood- 
 shed — and that this was all she knew, as she had hidden herself 
 and her infant, first in one place, and then in another, as she 
 fancied safest, hoping that nobody would remember her, which 
 seemed to have been the case, as no one molested her till 
 Toussaint saw her, and terrified her as they perceived. She had 
 not looked in his face, but supposed that some of Latour's people 
 had come back for her. 
 
 " Now you will come with me," said Bayou to Papalier, im- 
 patiently. 
 
 " I will, thank you. Toussaint, help her up behind me, and 
 carry the child, will you ? Hold fast, Thdrese, and leave off 
 trembling as soon as you can." 
 
 Therese would let no one carry the infant but herself. She 
 kept her seat well behind her master, though still trembling 
 when she alighted at the stables at Breda. 
 
 Placide and Denis were on the watch at the stables. 
 
 " Run, Denis ! " said his brother. And Denis was off to tell 
 his mother that Toussaint and M. Bayou were safe home 
 
 " Anything happened, Placide p " asked Bayou. 
 
 " Tes, sir. The people were sent for to Latour's, and most of 
 them are gone. Not all, sir. Saxe would not go till he saw 
 father ; nor Oassius, nor Antoiue, nor — " 
 
 " Is there any mischief done P Anybody hurt P ' 
 
 " No, sir. They went off very quietly." 
 
 " Quietly, indeed ! They take quietly enough all the kind- 
 ness I have shown them these thirty years. They quietly take 
 the opportunity of leaving me alone to-night, of all nights, when 
 the devils from hell are abroad, scattering their fire as they go."

32 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " If you will enter, M. Bayon," said Toussaint, " my wife 
 will get you supper ; and the boys and I will collect the people 
 that are left, and bring them up to the house. They have 
 not touched your arms, sir. If you wUl have them ready for 
 us " 
 
 " Grood, good ! Papalier, we cannot do better. Come in. 
 Toussaint, take home this young woman. Tour girls will take 
 care of her. Eh ! what's the matter ? Well, put her where you 
 will — only let her be taken cai-e of — that is all." 
 
 " I will speak to Jeannette, sir." 
 
 "Ay, do. Jeannette will let Th^rese come to no harm, 
 Papalier. Come in, till Toussaint brings a report of how matters 
 stand with us poor masters." 
 
 CHAPTEE, III. 
 
 WHAT TO DO ! 
 
 The report brought by Toussaint was astounding to his hearers, 
 even after the preparation afforded by the events of the evening. 
 It was clear that the negroes had everything in their own hands, 
 and that the spirit roused in them was so fierce, so revengeful, 
 as to leave no hope that they would use their power with 
 moderation. The Breda estate, and every one near it, was to be 
 ravaged when those on the north side of the plain were com- 
 pletely destroyed. The force assembled at Latour's already 
 amounted to four thousand ; and no assistance could be looked 
 for from the towns at all adequate to meet such numbers, since 
 the persons and property of the whites, hourly accumulating in 
 the towns as the insurrection spread, required more than all the 
 means of protection that the colony afforded. The two gentle- 
 men agreed, as they sat at the table covered with supper, wine, 
 and glittering arms, that to remain was to risk their lives with 
 no good object. It was clear that they must fly. 
 
 Toussaint suggested that a quantity of sugar from the Breda 
 estate was now at Port Paix, lying ready for shipment. There 
 was certainly one vessel, if not more, in that port, belonging to 
 the United States. If the gentlemen would risk the ride to the 
 coast with him, he thought he could put them on board, and 
 they might take with them this sugar, intended for France, but 
 now wanted for their subsistence in their exile. Bayou saw at 
 once that this was the best plan he could adopt. Papalier was 
 unwilling to turn his back so soon, and so completely, on his 
 property. Bayou was only attorney to the Breda estate, and 
 had no one but himself to care for. Papalier was a proprietor.

POISON TO TOUSSAINT. 33 
 
 and he could not give up at once, and for ever, the lands wMeh 
 Ms daughters should inherit after him. He could not instantly 
 decide upon this. He would wait some hours at least. He 
 thought he could contrive to get into some town, or into the 
 Spanish territory, though he might be compelled to leave the 
 plain. He slept for this night with his arms at hand, and under 
 the watch of Placide, who might be trusted to keep awake and 
 listen, as his father vouched for him. Bayou was gone presently ; 
 with such little money as he happened to have in the house; 
 and in his pockets, the gold ornaments which Toussaint's wife 
 insisted on his accepting, and which were not to be despised in 
 this day of his adversity. He was sorry to take her necklace 
 and ear-rings, which were really valuable ; but she said, truly, 
 that he had been a kind master for many years, and ought to 
 command what they had, now that they were all in trouble 
 together. 
 
 Before the next noon, M. Bayou was on board the American 
 vessel in the harbour of Port Paix, weary and sad, but safe, with 
 his sugar, and pocketsful of cash and gold trinkets. Before 
 evening, Toussaint, who rode like the wind, and seemed in- 
 capable of fatigue, was cooling himself under a tamarind-tree, 
 in a nook of the Breda estate. 
 
 He was not there to rest himself, while the world seemed to 
 be falling into chaos around him. He was there for the duty of 
 the hour — ^to meet by appointment the leader of the insurgents, 
 Jean Pranpais, whom, till now, he had always supposed to be 
 his friend, as far as their intercourse went, though Jean had 
 never been so dear to him as Henri. He had not sat long, 
 listening for sounds of approach amidst the clatter of the neigh- 
 bouring palm-tree tops, whose stiff leaves struck one another 
 as they waved in the wind, when Jean appeared from behind 
 the mill. 
 
 " Tou have stopped our wheel," said Toussaint, pointing to 
 the reeking water-mill. " It will be cracked in the sun before 
 you can set it going again." 
 
 " Tes, we have stopped aU the miUs," replied Jean. " Every 
 stream in the colony has a holiday to-day, and may frolic as it 
 Ukes. I am afraid I made you wait supper last night P " 
 
 " Tou gave me poison, Jean. Tou have poisoned my trust 
 in my friends. I watched for you as for a friend ; and what 
 were you doing the while ? Tou were rebeUrng, ravaging, and 
 murdering ! " 
 
 " Go on," said Jean. " Tell me how it appears to you ; and 
 then I will tell you how it appears to me." 
 
 "It appears to me, then, that if the whites are to blame 
 towards those who are in their power — if they have been cruel 
 to the Oges, and their party— if they have oppressed their 
 c

 negroes, as they too often have, our duty is clear — ^to bear and 
 forbear, to do them good in return for their evil. To rise against 
 them cunningly, to burn their plantations, and murder them — 
 to do this is to throw back the gospel in the face of Him who 
 gave it ! " 
 
 " But you do not understand this rising. It is not for revenge." 
 
 " Why do I not understand it. Because you knew that I 
 should disapprove it, and kept me at home by a false appoint- 
 ment, that I might be out of the way. Do you say all this is 
 not for revenge? I look at the hell you have made of this 
 colony between night and morning, and I say that if this be not 
 from revenge, there must be something viler than revenge in the 
 hearts of devils and of men." 
 
 " And now, hear me," said Jean, " for I am wanted at Latour's, 
 and my time is short. It was no false appointment last night. 
 I was on my way to you, when I was stopped by some news 
 which altered our plans in a moment, and made us rise sooner, 
 by three days, than we expected. I was coming to teU you all, 
 and engage you to be one of our chiefs. Have you heard that 
 the Calypse has put into port at the other end of the island ? " 
 
 "No." 
 
 " Then you do not know the news she brought. She has a 
 royalist master, who is in no hurry to tell his news to the revo- 
 lutionary whites. The king and all his famUy tried to escape 
 from Prance in June. They were overtaken on the road, and 
 brought back prisoners to Paris." 
 
 Toussaiut, who always uncovered his head at the name of the 
 king, now bent it low in genuine grief. 
 
 " Is it not true," said Jean, " tliat our masters are traitors ? 
 Do they not insult and defy the king ? "Would there not have 
 been one shout of joy through all Cap last night, if this news 
 had been brought to the deputies after dinner with their 
 wine ? " 
 
 " It is true. But they would stm have been less guilty than 
 those who add ravage and murder to rebellion." 
 
 " There was no stopping the people when the messengers from 
 the Oalypse crossed the frontier, and sent the cry, ' Vive le Eoi ! 
 et I'anoien regime,' through the negro quarters of every estate 
 they reached. The people were up on the No^ plantation at the 
 word. Upon my honour, the glare of the fire was the first I 
 knew about it. Then the spirit spread among our people, like 
 the flames among our masters' canes. I like murder no better 
 than you, Toussaint; but when .once slaves are up, with knife 
 and firebrand, those may keep revenge from ldnd£ng who can 
 — I cannot." 
 
 " At least, you need not join— you can oppose yourself to it." 
 
 " I have not joined. I have saved three or four whites this

 day by giving them waraing. I have hidden a family in the 
 woods, and I will die before I will tell where they are. I did 
 what I could to persuade Gallifet's people to let Odeluc and his 
 soldiers turn back to Cap : and I believe they would, but for 
 Odeluc's obstinacy in coming among us. If he would have kept 
 his distance, he might have been alive now. As it is " 
 
 " And is he dead ? — the good Odeluc % " 
 
 " There he lies ; and half-a-dozen of the soldiers with him. 
 I am sorry, for he always thought well of us ; but he thrust 
 himself into the danger. One reason of my coming here now 
 is to say that this plantation and Arable will be attacked 
 to-night, and Bayou had better roost in a tree till morning." 
 
 " My master is safe." 
 
 "SafeP Where?" 
 
 " On the sea." 
 
 " Tou have saved him. Have you — I know your love of obe- 
 dience is strong — have you pledged yourself to our masters, to 
 oppose the rising — to fight on their side ? " 
 
 " I give no pledges but to my conscience. And I have no 
 party where both are wrong. The whites are revengeful, and 
 rebel against their king; and the blacks are revengeful, and 
 rebel against their masters." 
 
 " Did you hear anything on the coast of the arrival of the 
 Blonde frigate from Jamaica ? " 
 
 " Yes ; there again is more treason. The whites at Cap have 
 implored the English to take possession of the colony. First 
 traitors to the king, they would now join the enemies of their 
 country. Fear not, Jean, that I would defend the treason of 
 such ; but I would not murder them." 
 
 " What do you mean to do ? this very night your estate wiU 
 be attacked. Your family is almost the only one remaining on 
 it. ' Have you thought what you will do % " 
 
 " I have ; and your news only confirms my thought." 
 
 " You wlU not attempt to defend the plantation ? " 
 
 " What would my single arm do 1 It would provoke revenge 
 which might otherwise sleep." 
 
 " True. Let the estate be deserted, and the gates and doors 
 left wide, and no mischief may be done. Will you join us then ? " 
 
 " Join yoa ! no ! Not till your loyalty is free from stain. 
 Not while you fight for your king with a cruelty from which 
 your king would recoil." 
 
 " You will wait," said Jean, sarcastically, " till we have con- 
 quered the colony for the king. That done you vriU avow your 
 loyalty." 
 
 " Such is not my purpose, Jean," replied Toussaint, quietly. 
 " You have called me your friend ; but you understand me no 
 more than if I were your enemy. I will help to conquer the

 colony for the king ; but it sTiall be to restore to him its knds 
 as the King o£ kings gave them to him — not ravaged and soaked 
 in blood, but redeemed with care, to be made fair and fruitful, 
 as held in trust for him. I shall join the Spaniards, and fight 
 for my king with my king's aUies." 
 
 Jean was silent, evidently struck with the thought. If he 
 had been troubled with speculations as to what he should do 
 with his undisciplined, half -savage forces, after the whites should 
 have been driven to entrench themselves in the towns, it is pos- 
 sible that this idea of crossing the Spanish line, and putting him- 
 self and his people under the command of these allies, might be 
 a welcome relief to his perplexity. 
 
 " And your family," said he : " will the Spaniards receive our 
 women and children into their camp ? " 
 
 "I shall not ask them. I have a refuge in view for my 
 family." 
 
 " When will you go ? " 
 
 " When you leave me. You will find the estate deserted this 
 night, as you wish. The few negroes who are here will doubt- 
 less go with me ; and we shall have crossed the river before 
 morning." 
 
 " Tou would not object," said Jean, " to be joined on the road 
 by some of our negro force ; on my pledge, you understand, that 
 they will not ravage the country." 
 
 " Some too good for your present command p " said Toussaint, 
 smiling. " I mU. command them on one other condition — that 
 they wiU treat well any white who may happen to be with me." 
 " I said nothing about your commanding them," said Jean. 
 " If I send men I shall send officers. But whites ! what whites ? 
 Did you not say Bayou was on the sea ? " 
 
 " I did ; but there may be other whites whom I choose to pro- 
 tect, as you say you are doing. If, instead of hiding whites in 
 the woods, I carry them across the frontier, what treatment may 
 I expect for my party on the road ? " 
 
 " I will go with you myself, and that is promising every- 
 thing," said Jean, making a virtue of what was before a strong 
 inclination. " Set out in two hours from this time. I wiU put 
 the command of the plain into Biasson's hands, and makea camp 
 near the Spanish lines. The posts in that direction are weak, 
 and the whites panic-struck, if indeed they have not all fied to 
 the fort. Well, well," he continued, "keep to your time, and 
 I wiU join you at the cross of the four roads, three miles south 
 of Fort Dauphin. All wUl be safe that far, at least." 
 
 _ " If not, we have some strong arms among us," replied Tous- 
 saint. " I believe my girls (or one of them at least) would bear 
 arms where my honour is at stake. So our king is a prisoner ! 
 and we are free ! Such are the changes which Heaven sends ! "

NEGROES AND BOOKS. 2i7 
 
 " Aj. how do you feel, now you are free ? " saiJ Jean. " Did 
 you not put your horse to a gallop when you turned your back 
 on your old master ? " 
 
 " Not a word of that, Jean. Let us not think of ourselves. 
 There is work to do for our king. He is our task-master now." 
 
 " You are in a hurry for another master," said Jean. " I am 
 not tired of being my own master yet." 
 
 " I wish you would make your people masters of themselves, 
 Jean. They are not fit for power. Heaven take it from us, by 
 putting all power into the hand of the king ! " 
 
 " We meet by starlight," said Jean. " I have the business of 
 five thousand men to arrange first ; so, more of the king another 
 time." 
 
 He leaped the nearest fence and was gone. Toussaint rose and 
 walked away, with a countenance so serious, that Margot asked 
 if there was bad news of M. Bayou. 
 
 When the family understood that the Breda estate was to be 
 attacked this night, there was no need to hasten their prepara- 
 tions for departure. In the midst of the hurry, Aimee consulted 
 Isaac about an enterprise which had occurred to her, on her 
 father's behalf ; and the result was, that they ventured up to the 
 house, and as far as M. Bayou's book-shelves, to bring away the 
 volumes they had been accustomed- to see their father read. This 
 thought entered Aimee's mind wheu she saw him, busy as he 
 was, carefully pocket the Epictetus he had been reading the night 
 before. M. Papalier was reading, while Therese was making 
 packages of comforts for him. He observed the boy and girl, 
 and when he found that the books they took were for their 
 father, he muttered over the volume he held — 
 
 " Bayou was a fool to allow it. I always told him so. Wheu 
 our negroes get to read like so many gentlemen, no wonder the 
 world is turned upside down." 
 
 " Do your negroes read, M. Papalier ? " asked Isaac. 
 
 " No, indeed ! not one of them." 
 
 " Where are they aU, then P " 
 
 Aimee put in her word. 
 
 "Why do they not take care of you, as father did of M. 
 Bayou ? "

 CHAPTER IV. 
 
 WHITHBK AWAY ? 
 
 M. Papalibb did not much relish the idea of roosting in a tree 
 for the night ; especially as, on coming down in the morning, 
 there would be no friend or helper near, to care for or minister 
 to him. Habitually and thoroughly as ho despised the negroes, 
 he preferred travelling in their company to hiding among the 
 monkeys ; and he therefore decided at once to do as Toussaint 
 concluded he would — accompany him to the Spanish frontier. 
 
 The river Massacre, the boundary at the north between the 
 French and Spanish portions of the island, was about thirty 
 miles distant from Breda. These thirty miles must be traversed 
 between sunset and sunrise. Three or four horses, and two 
 mules which were left on the plantation, were sufficient for the 
 conveyance of the women, boys, and girls ; and Placide ran, of 
 his own accord, to M. Papalier's deserted stables, and brought 
 thence a saddled horse for the gentleman, who was less able 
 than the women to walk thirty miles in the course of a tropical 
 summer's night. 
 
 " What will your Spanish friends think of our bringing so 
 many women and children to their post ? " said Papalier to 
 Toussaint, as soon as they were on their way. " They will not 
 think you worth having, with all the incumbrances you carry." 
 
 " I shaU carry none," said Toussaint. 
 
 " What do you mean to do with your wife and children ? " 
 
 " I shall put them in a safe place by the way. — For your own 
 sake, M. Papalier, I must ask you what you mean to do in the 
 Spanish post — republican as you are. Tou know the Spaniards 
 are allies of the king of Prance." 
 
 " They are allies of Prance, and will doubtless receive any 
 honourable French gentleman," said Papalier confidently, though 
 Tonssaint's question only echoed a doubt which he hatt already 
 spokento himself. " Tou are acting so like a friend to me here 
 Toussaint, that I cannot suppose you will do me mischief there| 
 by any idle tales about the past." 
 
 " I will not ; but I hear that the Marquis d'Hermona knows 
 the politics of every gentleman in the colony. If there have been 
 any tales abroad of speeches of yours against the king, or 
 threats, or acts of rebellion, the Marquis d'Hermona knows them 
 all." 
 
 " I have taken less part in politics than most of my neighbours ; 
 and Hermona knows that, if he knows the rest. But what shall

 I do with Therese, if your women stop short on the way ? 
 Could you make room for her with them ? " 
 
 " Not with them, but " 
 
 " M^y good fellow, this is no time for fancies. I am sorry to 
 see you set your girls above their condition and their neighbours. 
 There is no harm about poor Th6rese. Indeed, she is very well 
 educated ; I have had her weU taught ; and they might learn 
 many things from her, if you really wish them to be superior. 
 She is not a bit the worse for being a favourite of mine ; and it 
 will be their turn soon to be somebody's favourites, you know. 
 And that before long.depend upon it," he continued, turning on 
 his saddle to look for G6nifr6de and Aimee. " They are fine 
 girls, — very fine girls for their age." 
 
 When he turned again, Toussaint was no longer beside his 
 horse. He was at the head of the march. 
 
 " What a sulky fellow he is ! " muttered the planter, with a 
 smile. " The airs of these people are curious enough. They 
 take upon them to despise Therese, who has more beauty than 
 all his tribe, and almost as much education as the learned Tous- 
 saint himself." 
 
 He called to the sulky fellow, however, and the sulky fellow 
 came. What Papalier wanted to say was — 
 
 " Ton seem to know more of these Spaniards than I. What 
 wiU become of Therese, if I take her among them ; which, you 
 see, you oblige me to do P " 
 
 " I proposed to her," said Toussaint, " to leave her with some 
 of our people near Port Dauphin." 
 
 "Fort Egalite, you mean. That is its present name, you 
 know. So you asked her ! Why did you not speak to me about 
 it ? It is my affair, not hers." 
 
 " I thought it her affair. She wiU not remain behind, how- 
 ever. She begged me to say nothing to you about her leaving 
 you." 
 
 " Indeed ! I will soon settle that." And the planter imme- 
 diately overtook the horse on which sat Therese, with her infant 
 on her arm. Therese smiled as she saw him coming ; but the 
 first few words he said to her covered her face with tears. 
 Blinded by these tears, she guided her horse among the tough 
 aloes which grew along the border of the bridle-path, and the 
 animal stumbled, nearly jerking the infant from her arms. Her 
 master let her get over the difiiculty as she might, while he rode 
 on in the midst of the green track. 
 
 Placide disdained to ride. He strode along, singing in a low 
 voice, with a package on his shoulders, and his path marked by 
 the fireflies, which flew round his head, or settled on his woollen 
 cap. Isaac had made Aimee happy by getting on her mule. 
 Geuifrede heard from the direction in which they were, some-

40 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 times smothered laughter, but, for the most part, a never-ending, 
 low murmur of voices, as if they were telling one another 
 interminable stories. Genifrede never could make out what 
 Isaac and Aimee could be for ever talking about. She wondered 
 that they could talk now, when every monkey-voice from the 
 wood, every cUok of a frog from the ponds, every buzz of insects 
 from the citron-hedge, struck fear into her. She did not ask 
 Placide to walk beside her horse; but she kept near that on 
 which her mother rode, behind Denis, who held a cart-whip, 
 wlyeh he was forbidden to crack — an accomplishment which he 
 had learned from the driver of the plantation. 
 
 It soon became clear that Jean had made active use of the 
 hours since he parted from Toussaint. He must have sent 
 messengers in many directions ; for, from beneath the shadow 
 of every cacao grove, from under the branches of many a clump 
 of bamboos, from the recess of a ravine here — ^from the mouii 
 of a green road there, beside the brawling brook, or from their 
 couch among the canes, appeared negroes, singly or in groups, 
 ready to join the travelling party. Among aU these, there were 
 no women and children. They had been safely bestowed some- 
 where ; and these men now regarded themselves as soldiers, going 
 to the camp of the allies, to serve against their old masters on 
 behalf of the king. "Tive le Roi, et I'aucien regime!" was 
 the word as each detachment joined — a word most irritating to 
 Papalier, who thought to himself many times during this night, 
 that he would have put all to hazard on his own estate, rather 
 than have undertaken this march, if he had known that he was 
 to be one of a company of negroes, gathering like the tempest 
 in its progress, and uttering at every turning, as if in mockery 
 of himself, "Vive le Roi, et I'ancien regime ! " He grew very 
 cross, while quite sensible of the necessity of appearing in a good 
 mood to every one — except, indeed, poor Therese. 
 
 " We are free — this is freedom ! " said Toussaint more than 
 once as he laid his hand on the bridle of his wife's horse, and 
 seemed incapable of uttering any other words. He looked up at 
 the towering trees, as if measuring with his eye the columnar 
 palms, which appeared to those in their shade as if crowned with 
 stars. He glanced into the forest with an eye which, to Margot, 
 appeared as if it could pierce through darkness itseK. He 
 raised his face in the direction of the central mountain-peaks, 
 round which the white lightning was exploding from moment to 
 moment ; and Margot saw that tears were streaming on his face 
 — ^the first tears she had known him shed for years. " We are 
 free — ^this is freedom ! " he repeated, as he took off his cap ; 
 " but, thank God ! we liave the king for our master now." 
 
 " Tou wiU come and see us," said she. " We shall see you 
 sometimes while you are serving the king."

ON THE MARCH. 4 1 
 
 " Tes." He was called away by another accession of numbers, 
 a parly of four who ran down among them from a mountain 
 path. Toussaint brushed away his unwonted tears, and went 
 forward, hearing a well-known voice inquire for Toussaint Breda. 
 
 " Here I am, Jacques ! " he exclaimed in some surprise, as he 
 addressed himself to a short, stout-built young negro. " You 
 are the first townsman among us, Jacques. Where is old 
 Dessalines ? " 
 
 " Here is my master," said Jacques. 
 
 " Not the better for being a master," said the old tiler, who 
 was himself a negro. " I found myself no safer than Jacques in 
 the town ; so I came away with him, and we have been among 
 the rocks all day, tired enough." 
 
 " Have not you a horse for him ? " asked Jacques. Toussaint 
 stepped back, to desire Aimee and Isaac to give up their mule to 
 Dessalines ; but before it was done, Dessalines was mounted on 
 Papalier's horse. Jacques had told Papalier, on finding that he 
 had not been walking at aU, that his horse was wanted, and 
 Papalier had felt aO the danger of refusing to yield it up. He 
 was walking moodily by the side of Therese, when Toussaint 
 offered him the mule, which he haughtily declined. 
 
 When Dessalines was mounted, Jacques came running for- 
 ward to Toussaint, to ask and to tell much concerning their 
 singular circumstances. 
 
 " Tour party is too noisy," said he. " The whole country is 
 up ; and I saw, not far ofE, two hours ago, a party that were 
 bringing ammunition from Cap. There may be more ; and, if 
 we fall in their way, with a white in company " 
 
 " True, true." And Toussaint turned back to command silence. 
 He told every one that the safety of all might depend on the ut- 
 most possible degree of quietness being observed. He separated 
 Isaac from Aimee, as the only way of obtaining silence from 
 them, and warned the merry blacks in the rear that they must 
 be still as death. He and Jacques, however, exchanged a few 
 more words in a low whisper, as they kept in advance of the party. 
 
 " How do they get ammunition from Cap ? " asked Toussaint. 
 " Have they a party in the town ? I thought the town negroes 
 had been sent on board ship." 
 
 " The suspected ones are. They are the siUy and the hax*m- 
 less who have still wit and mischief enough to give out powder 
 and ball slyly for the plantation negroes. Once over the river, 
 what will you do with your party ? " 
 
 "My wife and children wiU be safe with my brother Paul — 
 you know he fishes on the coast, opposite the Seven Brothers. 
 I shall enter the Spanish ranks ; and every one else here will do 
 as he thinks proper." 
 
 " Do not you call yourself a commander, then ! Why do you

 not call us your regiment, and take the command as a matter of 
 course, as Jean has done P " 
 
 " If it is desired, I am ready. Hart ! " 
 
 There was evidently a party at some distance, numerous and 
 somewhat noisy, and on the approach from behind. Toussaint 
 halted his party, quickly whispered his directions, and withdrew 
 them with all speed and quietness within the black shade of a 
 cacao plantation, on the left of the road. They had to climb an 
 ascent ; but there they found a ^reen recess, so canopied with 
 interwoven branches that no light could enter from the stars, 
 and so hedged in by the cacao plants, growing twelve feet high 
 among the trees, that the party could hardly have been seen from 
 the road in broad daylight. There they stood crowded together 
 in utter darkness and stillness, unless, as Genifrede feared, the 
 beating of her heart might be heard above the hum of the mos- 
 quito, or the occasional rustle of the foliage. 
 
 The approaching troop came on, tramping, and sometimes 
 singing and shouting. Those in the covert knew not whether 
 most to dread a shouting which should agitate their horses, or a 
 silence which might betray a movement on their part. This last 
 seemed the most probable. The noise subsided ; and when the 
 troop was close at hand, only a stray voice or two was singing. 
 They had with them two or three trucks, drawn by men, on 
 which were piled barrels of ammunition. They were now very 
 near. Whether it was that Th^rese, in fear of her infant cry- 
 ing, pressed it so close to her bosom as to awaken it, or whether 
 the rumbUng and tramping along the road roused its sleeping 
 ear — the child stirred, and began what promised to be a long 
 shrill wawl, if it had not been stopped. How it was stopped, 
 the trembling, sickening mother herself did not know. She only 
 knew that a strong hand wrenched the child from her grasp in 
 the black darkness, and that all was stUl, unless, as she men and 
 ever after had a shuddering apprehension, there was something 
 of a slight gurgle which reached her strained ear. Her own 
 involuntary moan was stopped almost before it became a sound 
 — stopped by a tap on the shoulder, whose authoritative touch 
 she well knew. 
 
 No one else stirred for long after the troop had passed. Then 
 Toussaint led his wife's horse down into the road again, and the 
 party resumed their march as if nothing had happened. 
 
 " My chOd ! " said Therese, f eai-f ulLy. " Give me my child ! " 
 She looked about, and saw that no one seemed to have the infant. 
 
 " I will not let it cry," she said. " Give me back my child ! " 
 
 " What is it P " asked Papaiier, coming beside her horse. She 
 told her grief, as she prepared to spring down. 
 
 " No, keep your seat ! Don't get dovra," said he, in a tone 
 she dared not disobey. " I will inquire for the child."

THERkSE's GRIEF. 43 
 
 He went away, and returned — without it. 
 
 " Tliis is a sad thing," said he, leading her horse forward with 
 the rest. " No one knows anything about the poor thing. Why 
 did yon let it go? " 
 
 " Have you asked them all ? Who snatched it from me ? Oh, 
 ask who took it ! Let me look for it. I wiU — I wiU " 
 
 " It is too late now. We cannot stop or turn hack. These 
 sad accidents will happen at such times." 
 
 "Leave me behind — oh, leave me in the wood ! I can follow 
 when I have found it. Leave me behind ! " 
 
 " I cannot spare you, my dear. I should never see you again; 
 and I cannot spai-e you. It is sad enough to have lost the child." 
 
 " It was your child," said she, pleadingly. 
 
 " And you are mine too, my dear. I cannot spare you both." 
 
 Therese had never felt before. All that had moved her during 
 her yet short life — all emotions in one were nothing to the passion 
 of this moment — the conditional hatred that swelled her soul ; 
 conditional — for, from moment to moment, she believed and 
 disbelieved that Papalier had destroyed her child. The thought 
 sometimes occurred that he was not the only cruel one. No one 
 seemed to pity or care for her — not even Margot or the girls 
 came near her. She more than once was about to seek and 
 appeal to them ; but her master held her bridle, and would not 
 permit her to stop or turn, saying occasionally that the lives of 
 all depended on perfect quiet and order in the march. When 
 they arrived at the cross, at the junction of the four roads, they 
 halted, and there she told her story, and was convinced that the 
 grieved women knew nothing of her loss till that moment. It 
 was too late now for anything but compassion. 
 
 Jean Fran^ais soon appeared with a troop so numerous, that 
 all necessity for caution and quiet was over. They could hardly 
 meet an equal force during the remainder of the march, and 
 might safely make the forests and ravines echo to their progress. 
 Jean took ofE his cocked hat in saluting Toussaint, and com- 
 mended his punctuality and his arrangements. 
 
 "Jean always admires what my husband does," observed 
 Margot to her acquaintance Jacques. " Ton hear how he is 
 praising him for what he has done to-night." 
 
 " To be sure. Everybody praises Toussaint Breda," replied 
 Jacques. 
 
 The wife laughed with delight. 
 
 " Everybody praises him but me," pursued Jacques. " I find 
 fault with him sometimes ; and to-night particularly." 
 
 " Then you are wrong, Jacques. Ton know you have every- 
 body against you." 
 
 " Time will show that I am right. Time will show the mischief 
 of sending away any whites to do us harm in far countries."

 " Oh, you do not blame Mm for helping away M. Bayou ! " 
 
 " Yes, I do." 
 
 " Why, we have been under him ever since we were children 
 — and a kind youth he was then. And ho taught my husband to 
 read, and made him his coachman ; and then he made him 
 overseer ; and he has always indulged the children, and always 
 bought my young guinea-fowl, and " 
 
 " I know that. All that will not prevent the mischief of 
 helping him away. Toussaint ought to have seen that if we send 
 our masters to all the four sides of the world, they will bring the 
 world down upon us." 
 
 " Perhaps Toussaint did see it," said the man himself, from 
 the other side of his wife's horse. " But he saw another thing, 
 too — that any whites who stayed would be murdered." 
 
 " That is true enough ; and murdered they ought to be. They 
 are a race of tyrants and rebels that our warm island hates." 
 
 " Nobody hated M. Bayou," said Margot. 
 
 'Tes, I did. Every one who loves the blacks hates the 
 whites." 
 
 " I think not," said Toussaint. " At least, it is not so with 
 Him who made them both. He is pleased with mercy, Jacques, 
 and not with murder." 
 
 Jacques laughed, and muttered something about the priests 
 having been brought in by the whites for a convenience ; to 
 which Toussaint merely replied that it was not a priest, nor an 
 ally of white masters, who forgave His enemies on the cross. 
 
 " Father," said Placide, joining the group, " why is Jean com- 
 manding your march ? He speaks to you as if you were under 
 him." 
 
 " Because he considers it his march." 
 
 "He praised your father — ^very much, Placide," said his 
 mother. 
 
 " Tes — ^just as if my father were under him — as if the march 
 wore not ours. We began it." 
 
 " I command those who began it — that is, my own family, 
 Placide. I command you to obey Jean, while you are with him. 
 On the other side the river, you shall be commander, all the way 
 to your uncle's house. Tou wiU foUow his lead, Margot ? " 
 
 " Oh, yes, if he leads straight. Jean is a commander, Placide. 
 Look at ms cocked hat." 
 
 " And he calls himself commander-in-chief of the armies of 
 France." 
 
 " In St. Domingo. Well, so he is," said Toussaint, smiling, 
 and pointing to the troop. " Here are the armies of the King 
 of Prance in St. Domingo ; and here Jean commands." 
 
 At this moment, Jean made proclamation for Toussaint Breda , 
 and Toussaint joined him, leaving his wife saying, " Tou see lie

 wants my husband at euery turn. I am sure he thinks a great 
 deal of my husband." 
 
 " Toussaint," said Jean, " I shall introduce you to the Marqnis 
 d'Hermona; and I have no doubt he will give you a command." 
 '' I shall introduce myself to him, Jean." 
 " But he win be expecting you. He will receive you according 
 to my report — as a man of ability, and a most valuable officer. 
 1 sent messengers forward to tell him of my approach with 
 reinforcements ; and I gave a prodigious report of you." 
 " Still I shall speak for myself, Jean." 
 
 " What I now have to ask of you is, that you will dress like 
 an officer — like me. The uniform is, on the whole, of no great 
 consequence at this season, when the whites wear aU the linen, 
 and as little cloth as they can. But the hat, Toussaint — the 
 hat ! Tou will not show yourself to the Marquis d'Hermona in 
 a cap ! For my sake, do not show yourself tUl you have pro- 
 cured a cocked hat." 
 
 " Where did you get yours, Jean P " 
 
 Jean could only say that it was from one who would never 
 want it again. 
 
 " We wUl go as we are," said Toussaint. " Tou look Uke a 
 commander, as you are — and I look what I- am, Toussaint 
 Breda." 
 
 " But he will not believe what I shaJl say of you, if he sees a 
 mere common negro." 
 
 " Then let him disbelieve, till I have shown what I am. We 
 shall find daylight on the other side this ridge." 
 
 They had been for some time ascending the ridge which lies 
 north and south between Fort Dauphin and the river Massacre, 
 the Spanish boundary. In the covert of the woods which clothed 
 the slope all was yet darkness ; but when the travellers could 
 catch a glimpse upwards through the interwoven branches, they 
 saw that the stars were growing pale, and that the heavens were 
 filling with a yellower light. On emerging from the woods on 
 the summit of the ridge, they found that morning was indeed 
 come, though the sun was not yet visible. There was a halt, as 
 if the troops now facing the east would wait for his appearance. 
 To the left, where the ridge sank down into the sea, lay Mance- 
 nUle Bay, whose dark grey waters, smooth as glass, as they 
 rolled in upon the shore, began to show lines of light along their 
 swell. A dim sail or two, small and motionless, told that the 
 fishermen were abroad. From this bay, the river Massacre led 
 the eye along the plain which lay under the feet of the troops, 
 and between this ridge and another, darkly wooded, which 
 bounded the valley to the east ; while to the south-east, the view 
 was closed in by the mass of peaks of the Cibao group of moun- 
 tains. At the first moment, these peaks, rising eight thousand

 feet from tlie plain, appeared hard, cold, and grey, between the 
 white clouds that encumbered their middle height and the 
 kindling sky. But from moment to moment their aspect 
 softened. The grey melted into lilac, yellow, and a faint blush- 
 ing red, till the stark, barren crags appeared bathed in the hues 
 of the soft yielding clouds which opened to let forth the sun. 
 The mists were then seen to be stirring, — ^rising, curling, sailing, 
 rolling, as if the breezes were imprisoned among them, and 
 struggling to come forth. The breezes came, and, as it seemed, 
 from those peaks. The woods bent before them at one sweep. 
 The banyan-treo, a grove in itself, trembled through all its leafy 
 columns, and shook off its dews in a wide circle, like the return 
 shower of a playing fountain. Myriads of palms which covered 
 the uplands, till now still as a sleeping host beneath the stars, 
 bowed their plumed heads as the winds went forth, and shook 
 ofE dews and slumber from the gorgeous parasitic beauties which 
 they sustained. "With the &st ray that the sun levelled among 
 the woods, these matted creepers shook their flowery festoons, 
 their twined, green ropes, studded with opening blossoms and 
 bells, more gay than the burnished insects and gorgeous birds 
 which flitted among their tangles. In the plain, the river no 
 longer glimmered grey through the mists, but glittered golden 
 among the meadows, upon which the wild cattle were descend- 
 ing from the clefts of the hills. Back to the north the river led 
 the eye, past the cluster of hunters' huts on the margin, — ^past 
 the post where the Spanish flag was flying, and whence the early 
 drum was sounding — past a slope of arrowy ferns here, a grove 
 of lofty cocoa-nut trees there, once more to the bay, now 
 diamond-strewn, and rocking on its bosom the boats, whose sails 
 were now specks of light in contrast with the black islets of 
 the Seven Brothers, which caught the eye as if just risen from 
 the sea. 
 
 " No windmills here ! No cattle-miUs ! " the negroes were 
 heard saying to one another. " No canes, no sugar- houses, no 
 teams, no overseers' houses, no overseers ! By God, it is a fine 
 place, this ! So we are going down there to be soldiers to the 
 king ! those cattle are wild, and yonder are the hunters going 
 out ! By God, it is a fine place ! " 
 
 In somewhat different ways, every one present, but Papalier 
 and Thdrese, was indulging the same mood of thought. There 
 was a wildness in the scene which made the heart beat high 
 with the sense of freedom. For some the emotion seemed too 
 strong. Toussaint pointed out to his boys the path on the other 
 side of the river which would lead them to the point of the 
 shore nearest to Paul's hut, instructed them how to find or make 
 a habitation for their mother and sisters till he could visit them 
 gave his wife a letter to his brother, and, except to bid his family

MARQUIS D HERMONA. 47 
 
 a brief farewell for a brief time, spoke no more till he reached, 
 the Spanish post, and inquired for the general. 
 
 Jean stepped before him into the general's presence, taking 
 possession of the centre of the green space before the tent, where 
 the Marquis d'Hermona was enjoying the coolness of the 
 morning. After having duly declared his own importance, and 
 announced the accession of numbers he was likely to bring, Jean 
 proceeded to extol Toussaint as one of the valuables he had 
 brought. After apologising for his friend's want of a cocked 
 hat, he proceeded, to exhibit his learning, declaring that he had 
 studied " Plutarch," " Osesar's Commentaries," " Epictetus," 
 "Marshal Saxe's Military Reveries—" 
 
 Here he was stopped by the grasp of Toussaint's hand upon 
 his arm. Toussaint told the general that he came alone, with- 
 out chief and without followers : the few men who had left 
 Breda with him having ranged themselves with the force of 
 Jean Frangais. He came alone to offer the strength of his arm, 
 on behalf of his king, to the allies of royalist Prance. 
 
 The Spanish soldiers, who glittered all around in their arms 
 and bright uniform, looked upon the somewhat gaunt negro 
 in his plantation dress, dusty with travel, and his woollen cap 
 in hand, and thought, probably, that the king of Prance would 
 not be much aided by such an ally. It is probable ; for a 
 smUe went round, in which Jean joined. It is probable that 
 the Marquis d'Hermona thought differently, for he said — 
 
 " The strength of your arm ! Good ! And the strength of 
 your head, too, I hope. We get more arms than heads from 
 your side of the frontier. Is it true, that you have studied the 
 art of war ? " 
 
 " I have studied it in books." 
 
 " Very well. We want officers for our black troops — all we 
 can raise in the present crisis. You will have the rank of colonel 
 in a regiment to be immediately organised. Are you content ? " 
 
 Toussaint signified his assent, and orders were given for a tent 
 to be prepared for his present repose. He looked around, as if 
 for some one whom he did not see. On being asked, he said that 
 if there was at the post a priest who spoke Prench, he could 
 wish to converse with him. 
 
 " Laxabon understands Prench, I think," said the marquis to 
 a gentleman of his staff. The aide assented. 
 
 " Tour excellent desire shall be gratified," said the general. " I 
 doubt not Father Laxabon will presently visit you in your tent." 
 
 Father Laxabon had heard rumours of the horrors perpetrated 
 in the Prench colony within the last two nights. On being told 
 that his attendance was equally desired by a" fugitive negro, he 
 recoiled for a moment from what he might have to hear. 
 
 When he entered the tent, he found Toussaint alone, on

 the ground, Ms bosom bursting with deep and thick-coming 
 
 " How is this, my son ? " said the priest. " Is this grief, or is 
 it penitence?" 
 
 "I am free," said Toussaint, "and I am an oppression to 
 myself. I did not seek freedom. I was at ease, and did not 
 desire it, seeing how men abuse their freedom." 
 
 " Ton must not, then, abuse your freedom, my son," said the 
 priest, wholly relieved. 
 
 "How shall I appear before God — I who have ever been 
 guided, and who know not whether I can guide myself — my 
 master gone — my employment gone — and I, by his will, a free 
 man, but unprepared, unfit ? — Receive my confession, father, 
 and guide me from this time." 
 
 " Willingly, my sou. He who has appointed a new lot to you 
 will enable me to guide you in it." 
 
 The tent was closed ; and Toussaint kneeled to relieve his 
 full heart from its new sense of freedom, by subjecting himself 
 to a task-master of the soul. 
 
 CHAPTER Y. 
 
 GKIBFS or THE LOYAL. 
 
 Maegot doubted much, at the end of the first week, and at 
 the end of every following week, whether she liked freedom. 
 Margot had had few cares duriug the many years that she had 
 lived under the mild rule of M. Bayou — ^her husband faithful 
 and kind, and her children provided for without present anxiety 
 on her part. Thoughts of the future would, it is true, occa- 
 sionally trouble her, as she knew they weighed heavily on her 
 husband's mind. When she saw Genifrede growing up, hand." 
 some in her parents' eyes, and so timid and reserved that her 
 father sometimes said he wondered whether any one would ever 
 know her mind better than her own family did-^-when Margot 
 looked upon Genifrede, and considered that her "lot in life de- 
 pended on the wiU of M. Bayou, she shuddered to think what it 
 might be. When M. Bayou told Genifrede that she was well 
 coifEee, or that he wished she would show the other girls among 
 the house-negroes how to make their Sunday gowns sit like hers, 
 Genifrede invariably appeared not to hear, and often walked 
 away in the midst of the speech ; and then her mother could not 
 but wonder how she would conduct herself, whenever the day 
 should come that must come, when (as there was no one on the 
 Breda estate whom Genifrede liked, or would associate with)

M argot's cares. 49 
 
 M. Bayou should bring some one to their cottage, and desire 
 tremfrede to marry him. When Margot looked upon her sons, 
 and upon Aimee, uow so inseparable from Isaac, and considered 
 that their remaining together depended not only on M. Bayou's 
 will, but on his life, she trembled lest the day should be at hand 
 when Placide might be carried away northward, and Isaac east- 
 ward, and poor Aimee left desolate. Such had been the mother's 
 passing cares in the situation in which nothing had been want- 
 ing to her immediate comfort. Now, amidst the perplexities of 
 her new settlement, she was apt to forget that she had formerly 
 had any cares. 
 
 Where to house the party had been the first difficulty. But 
 for old Dessalines, who, being no soldier, had chosen to hide 
 himself in the same retreat with them, they would hardly hare 
 had good shelter before the rains. Paul had received thera 
 kindly ; but Paul's kindness was of a somewhat indolent sort ; 
 and it was doubtful whether he would have proceeded beyond 
 looking round his hut, and lamenting that it was no bigger, if 
 his spirited fon Moyse, a fine lad of sixteen, had not been there 
 to do_ something more effectual, in finding the place and the 
 materials for the old tiler to begin his work. It was Moyse 
 who convinced the whole party from the plain that a hut of 
 bamboo and palm-leaves would fall in an hour before one of the 
 haU-storms of this rocky coast ; and that it would not do to build 
 on the sands, lest some high tide should wash them all away in 
 the night. It was Moyse who led his cousins to the part of the 
 beach where portions of wrecks were most likely to be found, 
 and who lent the strongest hand to remove such beams and 
 planks as Dessalines wanted for his work. A house large 
 enough to hold the family was soon covered in. It looked well, 
 perched on a platform of rock, and seeming to nestle in a recess 
 of the huge precipices which rose behind it. It looked well, as 
 Dessalines could obtain neither of his favourite paints to smear 
 it with. It stood, neither red nor blue, but nearly the colour of 
 the rocks, against which it leaned, and thatched with palm- 
 leaves, which projected so far as to throw of£ the rains, even to 
 a depth below. 
 
 Paul provided fish — as much as his relations chose to have ; 
 but the young people chose to have many other things, under 
 the guidance of Moyse ; and here lay their mother's daily care. 
 She beKeved that both boys and girls ran into a thousand 
 dangers, and no one would help her to restrain them. Paul had 
 always let Moyse have his own way ; and Dessalines, when he 
 had brought in drift-wood for her fires, which he daily chose to 
 do, lay down in the sun when the sun shone, and before the 
 fire when the clouds gathered, and slept away the hours. Paul 
 wanted help in his fishing ; and it was commonly Isaac who went 
 
 D

 witli him ; for Isaac was more fond of boating than rambling. 
 Where Isaac was, there was Aimee. She gave no contemptible 
 help in drawing in the nets ; and when the fish was landed, she 
 and Isaac sat for hours among the mangrores which bordered 
 the neighbouring cove, under pretence of cleaning the fish, or 
 of mending the nets, or of watching the cranes which stalked 
 about the sands. Sometimes, in order to be yet more secure from 
 disturbance, the brother and sister would put ofE again, when 
 they had landed Paul with his prize, and get upon the coral reef, 
 half a mUe off — ^in calm weather collecting the sheU-fish which 
 were strewed there in multitudes, and watching the while the 
 freaks and sports of the dolphins in the clear depths around ; 
 and in windy weather sitting in the midst of the spray, which 
 was dashed over them from the heavy seas outside. Many times 
 in a morning or evening did Margot look out from her doorway, 
 and see their dusky forms upon the reef, now sitting motionless 
 in talk, now stooping for mussels and crabs, and never till the 
 last moment in the boat, on their way home. Sometimes Denis 
 was with them — sometimes with her — but oftenest with the party 
 led by Moyse. 
 
 Moyse had first enticed G^nifrede up the rocks behind their 
 dwelling, to get grass for hammocks, and to make matting for 
 the floors. Almost from the first day, it appeared as if Geni- 
 frede's fears all melted away in the presence of Moyse ; and her 
 mother became sure of this when, after grass enough had been 
 procured, Genifrede continued to accompany Placide and Moyse 
 in their almost daily expeditions for sporting and pleasure. 
 They brought guanas, tender young monkeys, and cocoa-nuts 
 from the wood, wild kids from the rock, delicate ducks from the 
 mountaiu-pouds, and sometimes a hog or a calf from the droves 
 and herds which flourished in the rich savannahs on the southern 
 side, on which they looked down from their ridge. In the joy 
 of seeing her children home again, gladsome as they were, and 
 feeling that they brought plenty and luxury into her cottage, 
 Margot kept her cares to herself, from day to day, and did not 
 interfere_ with their proceedings. She sometimes thought she 
 was foolish, and always was glad to see them enjoying their 
 freedom; but still, she felt doubtful whether she herself had 
 not been happier at Breda. The only time when her heart was 
 completely at ease and exulting was when Toussaint came to see 
 his family, to open his heart to his wife, and to smile away her 
 troubles. Her heart exulted when she saw him cross the ridge, 
 with a mounted private behind him, urge his horse down the 
 ascent, gallop along the sands to the foot of the rocks, throw the 
 bridle to his attendant, and mount to the plotform, looking- up 
 as he approached, to see whether she was on the watch. °She 
 was always on the watch. She liked to admire his uniform

 and to hear his sword clatter as he walked. She liked to see 
 him looking more important, more dignified, than Bayou or 
 Papalier had ever appeared in her eyes. Then, her heart was 
 always full of thoughts about their children, which he was as 
 anxious to hoar as she to toll ; and he was the only one from 
 whom she could learn anything of what was going on in the 
 world, or of what prospects lay before themselyes. He brought 
 news from France, from Cap and the plain, and, after a while, 
 from America — that M. Bayou was settled at Baltimore, where 
 he intended to remain till, as he said, the pacification of the 
 colony should enable him to return to Breda. There was no 
 fear, as Toussaint always found, but that Margot would be 
 looking out for him. 
 
 The tidings he brought were never very joyous, and often sad 
 enough. He said little of his personal cares; but Margot gathered 
 that he found it difiicult to keep on good terms with Jean. Once 
 he had resigned his rank of colonel, and had assumed an office 
 of which Jean could not be jealous — ^that of physician to 'the 
 forces — an office for which he was qualified by an early and 
 extensive acquaintance with the common diseases of the country, 
 and the natural remedies provided by its soil. When the Marquis 
 d'Hermona had insisted upon his resuming his command, as the 
 best officer the negro forces could boast, Jean had purposed to 
 arrest him on some frivolous charge, and the foolish act had only 
 been prevented by a frank and strong remonstrance from his old 
 friend. All this time, Toussaint's military successes had been 
 great ; and his name now struck such awe into the lawless forces 
 of the insurgent blacks, that it was unnecessary for him to shed 
 their blood. He held the post of Marmalade, and from thence 
 was present with such unheard-of i-apidity of march, wherever 
 violence was expected, that the spirit of outrage throughout the 
 colony was, at length, kept in check. This peaceful mode of 
 standing by the rights of the king was more acceptable to the 
 gentle Toussaint than the warfare by which he had gained his 
 power over his own race ; but he knew well that things could 
 not go on as they were — that order of some kind must be estab- 
 lished — order which could be reached only through a fierce final 
 struggle; and of what nature this order was to be, depended 
 wholly upon the turn which affairs took in Europe. 
 
 He rarely brought good news from abroad. His countenance 
 always grew sad when Margot asked what ships had arrived 
 from Prance since his last visit. First he had to tell her that 
 the people of Paris had met in the Champ de Mars, and demanded 
 the dethronement of the king ; then, that Danton had auda- 
 ciously informed the representatives of France that their refusal 
 to declare the throne vacant would be the signal for a general 
 insurrection. After this, no national calamity could surprise the

52 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 loyal colonists, Toussaint said ; for the fate of Louis as a king, 
 if not as a man, was decided. Accordingly, there followed 
 humiliations, deposition, imprisonment, during which little could 
 be known of the mind, and even of the condition of the Hng : and 
 those who would have served him remained in anxious suspense. 
 It happened, one warm day in the spring, when every trace 
 of the winter hail-storms had passed away, that the whole party 
 were amusing themselves in trying to collect enough of the 
 ripening sea-side grape for a feast. The bright round leaves 
 were broad and abundant ; but the clusters of the fruit were 
 yet only of a paJe yellow, and a berry here and there was all 
 that was fit for gathering. The grape-gathering was little more 
 than a pretence for basking in the sun, or for lounging in the 
 shade of the abundant verdure, which seemed to have been 
 sown by the hurricane, and watered by the wintry surf, so 
 luxuriantly did it spring from the sands and the salt waves. 
 The stately manchineel overhung the tide ; the mangroves 
 sprang out of the waters; the sea-side grape overspread the 
 sands with a thick green carpet, and kept them cool, so that 
 as the human foot sought the spot, the glittering lizards for- 
 sook it, and darted away to seek the hot face of the rock. For 
 full half a mile this patch of verdure sprestd; and over this 
 space were dispersed Margot and her household, when Tous- 
 saint crossed the ridge, on one of his frequent visits. As he 
 descended, he heard laughter and singing; and among the 
 singing voices, the cracked pipe of old Dessalines. Toussaint 
 grieved to interrupt this mirth, and to think that he must leave 
 dull and sad those whom he found so gay. But he came with 
 bad news, and on a mournful errand, and there was no help for it. 
 As he pricked on his horse towards the party, the young 
 people set up a shout and began to run towards him, but stopped 
 short on seeing how unusually large a train he brought. Five or 
 six mounted soldiers, instead of one, followed him this time, and 
 they led several horses. 
 
 " Oh, yon are come to take us home ! " cried Margot, joyfully, 
 as she met him. 
 
 He shook his head as he replied — 
 " iiro,_Margot, not yet. But the time may come." 
 " I wish you could teU us when it would come," said Dessa- 
 lines. '"It is all very well gathering these things, and calling 
 them grapes, for want of better ; but give me the grapes that 
 yield one wine. I wonder who has been gathering the grapes 
 from my trellis all this time, while, the whole rainy season 
 through, not a drop did I taste ? I wish you had left your revo- 
 lutions and nonsense till after my time, that I might have sat 
 under my own vine and my own fig-tree, as the priest says, till 
 the end of my days."

YOUNG RECRUITS. S3 
 
 " Indeed I wish so too, Dessalines. But you shall have some 
 vrine." 
 
 " Ay, send us some. Jacques will tell you what I like. 
 Don't forget, Toussaint Breda. They talk of palm wine in the 
 season ; but I do not believe we shall get any worth drinking 
 from the palms hereabouts." 
 
 " What is the matter with our palms P " cried Moyse, firing 
 up for the honour of the northern coast. " I will get you a 
 cabbage for dinner every day for a month to come," he added, 
 moderating his tone under his uncle's eye — " every day, till you 
 say that our palms, too, are as good as any you have in the 
 plain ; and as for palm wine, when the season comes " 
 
 "No, let me — let me cut the cabbage!" cried Denis. "I 
 can climb as quick as a monkey now — a hundred feet in two 
 minutes. Let me climb the palmetto, Moyse." 
 
 " First take back my horse to those soldiers; my boy," said 
 his father, setting Denis upon his horse, " and then let us all sit 
 down here in the shade." 
 
 " All those horses," said Margot, anxiously : " what is to be 
 done with them to-day ? There are so many ! " 
 
 " They will return presently," replied her husband. " I am 
 not going to stay with you to-day. And, Margot, I shall take 
 the lads with me, if they are disposed to go." 
 
 " The lads ! my boys ! " 
 
 " Tes," said Toussaint, throwing himself down in the shade. 
 '' Our country and its people are orphaned ; and the youngest 
 of us must now make himself a soldier, that he may be ready for 
 any turn of affairs which Providence may appoint. Do you 
 hear, my boys ? " 
 
 " Tes, father," answered Placide in an earnest tone. 
 
 " They have then murdered the king?" asked Margot; "or 
 did he die of his imprisonment ? " 
 
 " They brought him to trial, and executed him. The apes 
 plucked down the evening star, and quenched it. We have no 
 king. We and our coimtry are orphaned." 
 
 After a pause, Paul said — 
 
 "It is enough to make one leave one's fishing, and take up a gun.'' 
 
 " I rejoice to hear you say so, brother," said Toussaint. 
 
 " Then, father, you will let me go," cried Moyse. " Ton will 
 give me your gun, and let me go to the camp." 
 
 " Tes, Moyse : rather you than I. Ton are a stout lad now, 
 and I know nothing of camps. Tou shall take the gun, and I 
 will stay and fish." 
 
 " Leave your father his gun, if he chooses to remain, Moyse. 
 We will find ai"ms for you. Placide ! Isaac ! " he continued, 
 looking from one to the other of his sons. 
 
 " And Denis," cried the boy, placing himself directly in his

 father's eye, as he returned breathless from the discharge of his 
 errand. 
 
 "Yes, my boy, by-and-by, when yon are as strong as 
 Placide. Ton shaU come to the camp when we want you." 
 
 " I will go to-day, father," said Placide. 
 
 " "What to do ? " said Isaac. " I do not understand." 
 
 Other eyes besides Aim^e's were feed on Toussaint's face, in 
 anxiety for his reply. 
 
 " I do not know, my son, what we are to do next. When the 
 parent of a nation dies, it may take some time to decide what is 
 the duty of those who feel themselves bereaved. All I now am 
 sure of is, that it cannot but be right for my children to be fitted 
 to serve their country in any way that they may find to be 
 appointed. I wish to train you to arms, and the time has come. 
 Do not you think so ? " 
 
 Isaac made no direct reply, and Aimee had strong hopes that 
 he was prepared with some wise, unanswerable reason for re- 
 maining where he was. Meanwhile, his father proceeded — 
 
 " In aU that I have done, in all that I now say, I have the 
 sanction of Father Laxabon." 
 
 " Then all is right, we may be sure," said Margot. " I have 
 no doubt you would be right, if you had not Father Laxabon to 
 consult ; but if he thinks you right, everything must be done as 
 you wish. My boys," pursued the tearful mother, " you must 
 go with your father : you hear Father Laxabon thinks so." 
 
 " Do you think so ? " whispered Aim& to Isaac. 
 
 He pressed her arm, which was within his, in token of silence, 
 while his father went on : 
 
 " Tou heard the proclamation I sent out among our people a 
 few weeks ago." 
 
 " Tes," said Placide ; " that in which you teU them that you 
 prefer serving with Spaniards who own a king, than with French 
 who own none." 
 
 " Tes. I have had to make the same declaration to the two 
 commissaries who have arrived at Cap under orders from the 
 regicides at Paris. These commissaries have to-day invited me 
 to their standard by promises of favour and consideration." 
 
 " "What do they promise us ? " asked Margot eagerly. 
 
 _" Nothing that we can accept. I have vn:itten a letter in reply, 
 saying that I cannot yield myself to the wiU of any member of 
 the nation, seeing that, since nations began, obedience has been 
 due only to kings. We have lost the king of France ; but we 
 are beloved by the monarch of Spain, who faithfully rewards our 
 services, and never intermits his protection and indulgence. 
 Thus, I cannot acknowledge the authority of these commissaries 
 till they shall have enthroned a king. Such is the letter which, 
 guided by Father Laxabon, I have written."

FREEDOM S REQUIREMENTS. 55 
 
 " It is a beautiful letter, I am sure," said Marsfbt. " Is it not, 
 Paul." 
 
 " I don't doubt Father Laxabon is right," ^aid Dessalines ; 
 " only I do not see the use of having a king, if people are turned 
 out of house and home for being loyal — as we all are. If we 
 had not cared anything about the king's quarrel, we might have 
 been under our vines at home, as I have often said before." 
 
 " And how would it have been with us here P " said Toussaint, 
 laying his hand on his breast. 
 
 " Put your hand a little lower, and I say it would have been 
 all the better for us," said the old negro, laughing, " for we 
 should not have gone without wine all this time." 
 
 " What do you think ? " Aim^e, as usual, asked Isaac. 
 
 " I think it was good for my father to be loyal to the king, as 
 fong as the king lived. I think it was good for us to be living 
 here free, with time to consider what we should do next. And I 
 think it has happened very well that my father has shown what 
 a soldier he is, which he could not so well have done if we had 
 stayed at Breda. As for Dessalines, he is best where the vines 
 grow thickest, or where the cellars are deepest. It is a pity he 
 should have taken upon him to be loyal." 
 
 " And what do you think of going to the camp with my father ? 
 Look at Moyse — how delighted he is ! " 
 
 Moyse certainly did look possessed with joy. He was rapidly 
 telling all his warlike intentions to Genifrede, who was looking 
 in his face with a countenance of fear and grief. 
 
 " Tou think nothing of us," she cried at length, giving way to 
 a passion of tears. " We have been so happy here, all together ; 
 and now you are glad to go, and leave us behind ! Tou will go 
 and fight, without caring for us — you will be killed in this horrid 
 war, and we shall never see you again — we shall never know 
 what has become of you." 
 
 Moyse's military fire was instantly quenched. It immediately 
 appeared to him the greatest of miseries to have to leave his 
 cousins. He assured Genifrede he could not really intend to go. 
 He had only been fancying what a war with the white masters 
 would be. He hated the whites heartily ; but he loved this place 
 much more. Placide and Isaac might go, but he should stay. 
 Nothing should part him from those he loved best. 
 
 Toussaint was not unmindful of what was passing. Geui- 
 frede's tones of distress, and Moyse's protestations, all reached 
 his ear. He turned, and gently drew his daughter towards him. 
 
 " My child," said he, " we are no longer what we have been — 
 slaves, whose strength is in the will of their masters. We are 
 free ; and to be free requires a strong heart, in women as well as 
 in men. When M. Bayou was our master, we rose and slept 
 every day alike, and went out to our work, and came in to our

 food, without having to think of anjihinff beyond. Now we are 
 free, and God has raised us to the difficult duties which we have 
 always reverenced in the whites. We men must leave our homes 
 to live in camps, and, if necessary, to fight ; and you, women and 
 girls, must make it easy for us to do our duty. Tou must be 
 willing to see us go — glad to spare us — and you must pray to 
 God that we may not return till our duty is done." 
 
 " I cannot — I shall not," G^nifrfede muttered to herself, as she 
 cast down her eyes under her father's compassionate gane. He 
 looked towards Aimee, who answered, with tearful eyes — 
 
 " Tes, father. They must go ; and we will not hinder them; 
 but they will soon be back, will not they P " 
 
 " That depends on how soon we can make good soldiers of 
 them," said he, cheerfully. " Come, Moyse, have you changed 
 your mind again ? Or will you stay and plait hammocks, while 
 my boys are trained to arms ? " 
 
 " I shall not stay behind, if the others go. But why should 
 not we all go together p I am sure there is room enough in 
 yonder valley for all the people on this coast." 
 
 " Boom enough, but my family are better beside your father 
 than among soldiers and the hunters of the mountains. Stay 
 with them, or go with me. Shoot ducks, and pick up shell-fish 
 here ; or go with me, and prepare to be Geuei-al Moyse some 
 day." 
 
 Moyse looked as if he would have knocked his uncle down at 
 the supposition that he would stay to pick up shell-fish. He 
 could not but laugh, however, at hearing himseM greeted as 
 General Moyse by all the boys ; and even G6nif rede smiled. 
 
 Margot moved, sighing, towards the rocks, to put up for her 
 boys such comforts as she could muster, and to prepare the meal 
 which they must have before they went. Her girls went with 
 her ; and Denis shouted after them, that he was to get the cab- 
 bage from the palmetto, adding, that if they gave him a good 
 knife, he would take it ofE as neatly as the Paris people took off 
 the king. _ His father grasped his arm, and said — 
 
 " Never name the king, my boy, till you feel grieved that you 
 
 have lost him. Tou do not know what you say. Remember 
 
 never mention the king unless we ask you." 
 
 Denis was glad to run after his cabbage. His father remem- 
 bered to praise it at dinner. No one else praised or liked 
 anything. Margot and Aimee were tearful; Genifrede was 
 gloomy. The lads could think of nothing but the new life 
 before them, which yet they did not like to question their father 
 about, till they should have left the tears behind. No sooner 
 were they past the first turn up the ridge, than they poured out 
 their inquiries as to life in the camp, and the prospects of 
 the war. Their eager gestures were watched by those they left

 behind ; and there was a feeling of mortification in each woman's 
 heart, on seeing this evidence that home was already forgotten 
 for busier scenes. They persuaded themselves, and believed of 
 each other, that their grief was for the fearful death of the 
 king ; and they spoke as if this had been really the case. 
 
 " We have no one to look up to, now," said Margot, sobbing ; 
 " no one to protect us. Who would have thought, when I mar. 
 ried, how desolate we should be one day on the sea-shore — with 
 our master at Baltimore, and the king dead, and no Mag likely 
 to come after him ! What will become of us P " 
 
 "But Margot," interposed Dessalines, "how should we be 
 better off' at this moment, if the king were alive and flourishing 
 at Paris P " 
 
 " How ? " repeated Margot, indignantly. " Why, he would 
 have been our protector, to be sure. He would have done some 
 fine thing for my hushaud, considering what my husband has 
 done for him. If our beloved king (on his throne) knew of my 
 husband's victory at Plaisance, and of his expedition to St. Marc, 
 and of his keeping quiet all these plantations near Marmalade, 
 and of the thousands that he had brought over from the rebels, 
 do you think a good master like the king would have left us to 
 pine here among the rooks, while Jean Prangais is boasting all 
 day long, as if he had done everything' with his own hand ? 
 No, our good king would never have let Jean Prangais' wife 
 dress herself in the best jewels the white ladies left behind, while 
 the wife and daughters of his very best ofiicer are living here in 
 a hut, on a rock, with no other clothes to wear than they brought 
 away from Breda. No, no ; as my husband says, in losing the 
 king we are orphans." 
 
 " I can get you as good clothes as ever Jean's wife wore, Mar- 
 got," said Paul, whose soft heart was touched by her grief. " I 
 can run my boat along to a place I know of, where there are 
 silks and trinkets to be had, as well as brandy. I will bring you 
 and the girls some pretty dresses, Margot." 
 
 " No, Paul, not here. We cannot wear them here. And we 
 shall have no pleasure in anything, now we have lost the only 
 one who could take care of us. Ajid who knows whether we 
 shall ever see our boys again P " 
 
 " Curse the war ! " muttered Paul, wiping his brows. 
 
 " Mother," said Aimee in a low voice, " have we not God to 
 protect us still P One master may desert us, and another may 
 die ; but there is still God above ajl. Will not he protect us P " 
 
 " Tes, my dear. God takes care of the world; but then He 
 takes care of our enemies as well as of us." 
 
 "Does hep" exclaimed Denis, in a tone of surprise. 
 
 " Tes ; ask your father if Father Laxabon does not say so 
 The name of God is for ever in the mouths of the whites at

 Cap ; but they reviled the ting ; and, true enough, the king was 
 altogether on our side, — we had all his protection." 
 
 " All that is a good deal changed now, I hear," said Paul. 
 " The whites at Cap are following the example of the rebels at 
 Paris, and do not rely upon God, as on their side, as they used 
 to do." 
 
 " Will God leave ofl taking care of them, then P " asked 
 Denis, " and take care only of us P " 
 
 " No," said Aimee. " God is willing, Isaac says, to take care 
 of all men, whether they serve him or not." 
 
 Denis shook his head, as if he did not quite approve this. 
 
 " Our priest told Isaac,"continued Aimee, " that God sends 
 his rain on the just and on the unjust. And do not you know 
 that he does ? When the rains come next month, vrill they not 
 fall on all the plantations of the plain, as well as in the valley 
 where the camp is ? Our waterfalls will be all the fresher and 
 brighter for the rains, and so will the springs in Cap." 
 
 " But if he is everybody's master, and takes care of every- 
 body," said Denis, " what is all this fighting about p We are not 
 fighting for Him, are we P " 
 
 " Tour father is," said Margot ; " for God is always on the 
 side of kings. Father Laxabon says so." 
 
 The boy looked puzzled, till Aimee said — 
 
 " I think there would be none of this fighting if everybody 
 tried to please God and serve Him, as is due to a master — as 
 father did for the king. God does not wish that men should 
 fight. So our priest at Breda told Isaac." 
 
 "Unless wicked rebels force them to it, as your father is 
 forced," said Margot. 
 
 " I suppose so,* said Aimee, "by Isaac's choosing to go." 
 
 CHAPTER VI. 
 
 THE HOTJE. 
 
 The lads found some of the details of military training less 
 heroic and less agreeable than they had imagined — scarcely to be 
 compared, indeed, under either aspect, to the chase of the wild 
 goats, and search for young turtle, to which they had been of late 
 accustomed. They had their pleasures, however, amidst the 
 heats, toils, and laborious oifices of the camp. They felt them- 
 selves men, living among men : they were young enough to throw 
 off, and almost to forget, the habits of thought which belong to 
 slavery ; and they became conscious of a spirit growing np within

 them, by which they could look before and after, perceive that 
 the future of their lives was in their own hands, and therefore 
 understand the importance of the present time. Their father 
 looked upon them with mixed feelings of tender pride in them, 
 and regret for his own lost youth. The strong and busy years 
 on which they were entering had been all spent by him in ac- 
 quiring one habit of mind, to which his temperament and his 
 training aKke conduced — a habit of endurance. It was at this 
 time that he had acquired the power of reading enough to seek 
 for books ; and the books that he had got hold of 'were Epictetus, 
 and some fragments of Fenelon. With all the force of youth, 
 he had been by turns the stoic and the quietist ; and, while 
 busied in submitting himself to the pressure of the present, he 
 had turned from the past, and scarcely dreamed of the future. 
 If his imagination glanced back to the court of his royal grand- 
 father, held under the palm shades, or pursuing the hon-huut 
 amidst the jungles of Africa, he had hastily withdrawn his mind's 
 eye from scenes which might create impatience of his lot ; and 
 if he ever wondered whether a long succession of ignorant and 
 sensual blacks were to be driven into the field by the whip every 
 day in St. Domingo, for evermore, he had cut short the specula- 
 tion as inconsistent with his stoical habit of endurance, and his 
 Christian principle of trust. It was not till his youth was past 
 that he had learned anything of the revolutions of the world — 
 too late to bring them into his speculations and his hopes. He 
 had read, from year to year, of the conquests of Alexander and 
 of Caesar ; he had studied the wars of France, and drawn the 
 plans of campaigns in the sand before his door till he knew them 
 by heart ; but it had not occurred to him, that while empires 
 were overthrown in Asia, and Europe was traversed by powers 
 which gave and took its territories, as he saw the negroes barter 
 their cocoa-nuts and plantains on Saturday nights — while such 
 things had happened in another hemisphere, it had not occurred 
 to him that change woidd ever happen in St. Domingo. He had 
 heard of earthquakes taking place at intervals of hundreds of 
 years, and he knew that the times of the hurricane were not 
 calculable ; but, patient and still as was his own existence, he 
 had never thought whether there might not be a convulsion of 
 human affections, a whirlwind of human passion, preparing under 
 the grim order of society in the colony. If a master died, his 
 heir succeeded him; if the "force" of any plantation was by 
 any conjuncture of circumstances dispersed or removed, another 
 negro company was on the shore, ready to re-people the slave 
 quarter. The mutabilities of human life had seemed to him to 
 be appointed to whites — to be their privilege and their discipline ; 
 while he doubted not that the eternal command to blacks was to 
 bear and forbear. When he now looked upon his boys, and

 remembered that for them this ordei was broken up, and in time 
 for them to grasp a future, and prepare for it — that theirs was 
 the lot of whites, in being .involyed in social changes, he regarded 
 them with a far deeper solicitude and tenderness than in the 
 darkest midnight hours of their childish illnesses, or during the 
 sweetest prattle of their Sabbath afternoons, and with a far 
 stronger hopefulness than can ever enter the heart or home of a 
 slave. They had not his habitual patience ; and he saw that they 
 were little likely to attain it ; but they daily manifested qualities 
 and powers — enterprise, forecast, and aspiration of various kinds, 
 adorning their youth with a promise which made their father 
 sigh at the retrospect of his own. He was amused, at the same 
 time, to see in them symptoms of a boyish vanity, to which he 
 had either not been prone, or which he had early extinguished. 
 He detected in each the secret eagerness with which they looked 
 forward to displaying their military accomplishments to those 
 with whom they were always exchanging thoughts over the 
 ridge. He foresaw that when they shonid have improved a little 
 in certain exercises, he should be receiving hints about a visit to 
 the shore, and that there would then be such a display upon the 
 sands as should excite prodigious admiration, and make Denis 
 break his heart that he must not go to the camp. 
 
 Meantime, he amused them in the evenings, with as many of 
 his ofBcers as chose to look on, by giving them the history of the 
 wars of Asia and Europe, as he had learned it from books, and 
 thoroughly mastered it by reflection. Night after night was the 
 map of Greece traced with his sword's point on the sand behind 
 his tent, while he related the succession of the conflicts with 
 Persia, with a spirit derived from old Herodotus himself. Night 
 after night did the interest of his hearers arouse more and more 
 spirit in himself, till he became aware that his sympathies with 
 the Greeks in their struggles for liberty had hitherto been like 
 those of the poet born blind, who delights in describing natural 
 scenery — thus unconsciously enjoying the stir within him of 
 powers whose appropriate exercise is forbidden. Amidst this 
 survey of the regions of history, he felt, with humble wonder, 
 that while his boys were like bright-eyed children sporting fear- 
 lessly in the fields, he was like one lately couched, by whom the 
 order of things was gradually becoming recognised, but who was 
 oppressed by the unwonted light, and inwardly ashamed of the 
 hesitation and uncertainty of his tread. While sons, nephew, 
 and a throng of his officers, were listening to him as to an oracle, 
 and following the tracings of his sword, as he showed how this 
 advance and that retreat had been made above two thousand 
 years ago, he was full of consciousness that the spirit of the 
 history of freedom was received more truly by the youngest of 
 his audience than by himself— that he was learning from their

 natural ardour sometMng of higher value than all that he had to 
 impart. 
 
 As he was thus engaged, late one spring evening — late, 
 because the rains would soon come on, and suspend all out-door 
 meetings — he was stopped in the midst of explaining a diagram 
 by an authoritative tap on the shoulder. Roused by an appeal 
 to his attention now so xmusual, he turned quickly, and saw a 
 black, who beckoned him away. 
 
 " Why cannot you speak P — Or do you take me for some one 
 else ? Speak your business." 
 
 " I cannot," said the man, in a voice which, though too low 
 to be heard by anyone else, Toussaint knew to be Papalier's. 
 " I cannot speak here — I must not make myself known. Oome 
 this way." 
 
 Great was the surprise of the group at seeing Toussaint 
 instantly follow this black, who appeared in the dusk to be 
 meanly clothed. They entered the tent, and let down the cur- 
 tain at the entrance. Some saw that a woman stood within the 
 folds of the tent. 
 
 " Close the tent," said PapaUer, in the same tone in which 
 he had been wont to order his plate to be changed at home. 
 " And now, give me some water to wash ofB this horrid daubing. 
 Some water — quick ! Pah ! I have felt as if I were really a 
 negro all this day." 
 
 Toussaint said nothing ; nor did he summon any one. He 
 saw it was a case of danger, led the way into the inner part of 
 the tent, poured out water, pointed to it, and returned to the 
 table, where he sat down, to await further explanation. 
 
 Papalier at length reappeared, looking like himself, even as 
 to his clothes, which Therese must have brought in the bundle 
 which she carried. She now stood leaning against one of the 
 tent-poles, looking grievously altered — worn and wearied. 
 
 " Will you not sit down, Therese P " said Toussaint, pointing 
 to a chair near his own, Papalier having seated himseM on the 
 other side of the table. 
 
 Therese threw herself on a couch at some distance, and hid 
 her face. 
 
 " I must owe my safety to yon again, Toussaint," said Papa- 
 lier. " I understand General Hermona is here at present." 
 
 "He is." 
 
 " Ton have influence with him, and you must use it for me." 
 
 " I am sorry you need it. I hoped you would have taken 
 advantage of the reception he gave you to learn the best time 
 and manner of going. to Europe. 1 hoped you had been at Paris 
 long ago." 
 
 " I ought to have been there. If I had properly valued my 
 life, I should have been there. But it seemed so inconceivable

 that things shoTild have reached a worse pass than when J. 
 crossed the frontier ! It seemed so incredible that I should not 
 be able to preserve any wreck of my property for my children, 
 that I have lingered on, staying month after month, till now I 
 cannot get away. I have had a dreadful life of it. I had better 
 have been anywhere else. "WTiy, even Therese," he continued, 
 pointing over his shoulder towards the couch, " Therese, who 
 would not be left behind at Fort EgaUte, the night we came 
 from Breda — even Thdrese has not been using me as she should 
 do. I believe she hates me." 
 
 " Tou are in trouble, and therefore I will not speat with you 
 to-night about Therese," said Toussaint. " Tou are in danger, 
 from the determination of the Spaniards to deliver up the 
 enemies of the late king to " 
 
 "Bather say to deliver up the masters to their revolted 
 slaves. They make politics the pretence ; but they would not be 
 sorry to see us all cut to pieces, like poor Odeluo and Clement, 
 and fifty more." 
 
 '' However that may be, your immediate danger is from the 
 Spaniards — is it ? " 
 
 " Yes, I discovered that I was to be sent over the line to- 
 morrow ; so I was obliged to get here to-day in any way I 
 
 could ; and there was no other way than ^pah ! it was 
 
 horrid ! " 
 
 " No other way than by looking like a negro," said Tous- 
 saint, calmly. " Well, now you are here, what do you mean to 
 do next P " 
 
 "I mean, by your influence with General Hermona, to 
 obtain protection to a port, that I may proceed to Europe. I do 
 not care whether I go from St. Domingo, or by St. lago, so as 
 to sail from Port Plate. I could find a vessel from either port. 
 You would have no difficulty in persuading General Hermona 
 to this?" 
 
 " I hope not, as he voluntarily gave you permission to enter 
 this territory. I wiU ask for his safe-conduct in the morning. 
 To-night you are safe, if you remain here. I request that yoii 
 will take possession of the inner apartment, and rely upon my 
 protection." 
 
 "Thank you. I knew my best way was to come here," said 
 Papalier, rising. " Therese will bring me some refreshment ; 
 and then I shall be glad of rest, for we travelled half last 
 night." 
 
 " For how many shall the safe-conduct be ? " asked Toussaint, 
 who had also risen. " For yourself alone, or more 'i " 
 
 "No one knows better than you," said Papalier, hastily, 
 ' that I have only one servant left," pointing again to the couch 
 "And," lowering his voice, so that Therfese could not hear "she"

 poor thing, is dreadfully altered, you see — ^has never got over 
 the loss of her child, that night." Then, raising his voice again, 
 he pursued : " My daughters at Paris will be glad to see The- 
 rdse, I know ; and she will like Paris, as everybody does. All 
 my other people are irrecoverable, I fear ; but Therese goes 
 with me." 
 
 '' No," said Therese, from the couch, " I will go nowhere 
 with you." 
 
 " Hey-day ! what is that P " said Papalier, turning in the 
 direction of the voice. " Yes, you will go, my dear. You are 
 tired to-night, as you well may be. You feel as I do — as if you 
 could not go anywhere, to-morrow or the next day. But we 
 shall be rested and ready enough, when the time comes." 
 
 " I am ready at this moment to go anywhere else — anywhere 
 away from you," replied Therese. 
 
 " What do you mean, Therese P " asked her master, sharply. 
 
 " I mean what you said just now — ^that I hate you." 
 
 " Oh ! silence ! " exclaimed Toussaint. He then added in a 
 mild tone to Th&^se, " This is my house, in which God is wor- 
 shipped and Christ adored, and where therefore no words of 
 hatred may be spoken." He then addressed himself to Papalier, 
 saying, " You have then fully resolved that it is less dangerous 
 to commit yourself to the Spaniards than to attempt to reach 
 Cap?" - 
 
 '' To reach Cap ! "What ! after the decree P Upon my soul, 
 Toussaint, I never doubted you yet ; but if " 
 
 He looked Toussaint full in the face. 
 
 " I betray no one," said Toussaint. " What decree do you 
 speak of ? " 
 
 " That of the Convention of the 4th of February last." 
 
 " 1 have not heard of it." 
 
 " Then it is as I hoped — that decree is not considered here 
 as of any importance. I trusted it would be so. It is merely a 
 decree of the Convention, confirming and proclaiming the liberty 
 of the negroes, and declaring the colony henceforth an integrant 
 part of Prance. It is a piece of folly and nonsense, as you wiU 
 see at once ; for it can never be enforced. No one of any sense 
 will regard it ; but just at present it has the effect, you see, of 
 making it out of the question for me to cross the frontier." 
 
 " True," said Toussaint, in a voice which made Papalier look 
 in his face, which was working with some strong emotion. He 
 turned away from the light, and desired Therese to follow him. 
 He would commit her to the charge of one of the suttlers' wives 
 for the night. 
 
 Having put on the table such fruit, bread, and wine as re- 
 mained from his own meal (Papalier forbidding further pre- 
 paration, for fear of exciting observation without), Toussaint

64 THE HOUR AND THE MAN, 
 
 went ont ■witli Therese, committed her to safe hands, and then 
 entered the tent next his own, inhabited by his sons, and gave 
 them his accustomed blessing. On his return, he found that 
 Papalier had retired. 
 
 Toussaint was glad to be alone. Never had he more needed 
 solitude ; for rarely, if ever, in the course of his life, had his 
 calm soul been so disturbed. During the last words spoken by 
 Papalier, a conviction had flashed across him, more vivid and 
 more tremendous than any lightning which the skies of December 
 had sent forth to startle the bodily eye ; and amidst the storm 
 which those words had roused within him, that conviction con- 
 tinued to glare forth at intervals, refusing to be quenched. It 
 was this : — that if it were indeed true that the revolutionary 
 government of Prance had decreed to the negroes the freedom 
 and rights of citizenship, to fight against the revolutionary 
 government would be henceforth to fight against the freedom 
 and rights of his race. The consequences of such a conviction 
 were overpowering to Ms imagination. As one inference after 
 another presented itself before him — as a long array of humili- 
 ations and perplexities showed themselves in the future — he felt 
 as if his heart were bursting. For hour after hour of that night 
 he paced the floor of his tent ; and if he rested his limbs, so 
 unused to tremble with fear or toil, it was while covering his 
 face with his hands, as if even the light of the lamp disturbed 
 the intensity of his meditation. A few hours may, at certaia 
 crises of the human mind and lot, do the work of years; and 
 this night carried on the education of the noble soul, long re- 
 pressed by slavery, to a point of insight which multitudes do 
 not reach in a Inetime. No doubt, the preparation had been 
 making through years of forbearance and meditation, and 
 through the latter months of enterprise and activity ; but yet, 
 the change of views and purposes was so great as to make him 
 feel, between night and morning, as if he were another man. 
 
 The lamp burned out, and there was no light but from the 
 brilliant flies, a few of which had found their way into the teut. 
 Toussaint made his repeater strike : it was three o'clock. As 
 his mind grew calm under the settlement of his purposes, he 
 became aware of the thirst which his agitation had excited. By 
 the H^ht of the flitting tapers, he poured out water, refreshed 
 himself with a deep draught, and then addressed himself to his 
 duty. He could rarely endure delay in acting on his convictions. 
 The present was a case in which delay was treachery ; and he 
 would not lose an hour. He would call up Father Laxabon, and 
 open his mind to him, that he might be ready for action when the 
 camp should awake. 
 
 As he drew aside the curtain of the tent, the air felt fresh to 
 his heated brow, and, with the calm starlight, seemed to breathe

CONSULTING FATHER LAXABON. 65 
 
 strength and quietness into his soul. He stood for a moment 
 listening to the dash and gurgle of the river, as it ran past the 
 camp — the Toice of waters, so loud to the listening ear, but so 
 little heeded amidst the hum of the busy hours of day. It now 
 rose above the chirpings and buzzings of reptiles and insects, 
 and carried music to the ear and spirit of him who had so often 
 listened at Breda to the fall of water in the night hours, with a 
 mind unburdened and unperpleied with duties and with cai-es. 
 The sentinel stopped before the tent with a start which made his 
 arms ring at seeing the entrance open,and some one standing there. 
 
 " Watch that no one enters ? " said Tou'ssaint to him. " Send 
 for me to Father Laxabon's, if I am wanted." 
 
 As he entered the tent of the priest — a tent so small as to 
 contain only one apartment — aU seemed dark. Laxabon slept so 
 soundly as not to awake till Toussaint had found the tinder-box, 
 and was striking a light. 
 
 " In the name of Christ, who is there P " cried Laxabon. 
 
 " I, Toussaint Breda ; entreating your pardon, father." 
 
 " Why are you here, my son P There is some misfortune, by 
 your face. Tou look wearied and anxious. What is it ? " 
 
 " No misfortune, father, and no crime. But my mind is 
 anxious, and I have ventured to break your rest. Tou will 
 pardon me ? " 
 
 " Tou do right, my son. We are ready for service, in season 
 and out of season." 
 
 While saying this, the priest had risen, and thrown on his 
 morning-gown. He now seated himself at the table, saying — 
 
 " Let us hear^ What is this affair of haste ? " 
 
 " The cause of my haste is this — that I may probably not 
 again have conversation virith you, father ; and I desire to con- 
 fess, and be absolved by you once more." 
 
 " Good. Some dangerous expedition— is it not so ? " 
 
 " No. The affair is personal altogether. Have you heard of 
 any decree of the French Convention by which the negroes^ 
 the slaves — of the colony of St. Domingo are freely accepted 
 as fellow-citizens, and the colony declared an integrant part of 
 Fi-ance ? " 
 
 " Surely I have. The General was speaking of it last night ; 
 and I brought away a copy of the proclamation consequent 
 upon it. Let me see," said he, rising, and taking up the lamp, 
 " where did I put that proclamation ? " 
 
 " With your sacred books, perhaps, father ; for it is a gospel 
 to me and my race," 
 
 " Do you think it of so much importance ? " asked Laxabon, 
 returning to the table with the newspaper containing the pro- 
 clamation, officially given. " The General does not seem to 
 think much of it, nor does Jean Frangais."

 " To a commander of our allies the affair may appear a trifle, 
 fatlier; and such white planters as cannot refuse to hear the 
 tidings may acoff at them ; hut Jean Francjais, a negro and a 
 slave— is it possible that he makes light of this P " 
 
 " He does ; but he has read it, and you have not. Bead it, 
 my son, and without prejudice." 
 
 Tousaaint read it again and again. 
 
 " Well ! " said the prieat, as Tousaaint put down the paper, 
 no longer attempting to hide with it the streaming tears which 
 covered his face.

 found, when last night's sun went down (and as to-morrow 
 night's aun shall not find me), holding a command againat the 
 highest intereats of my race — now, at length, about to be 
 redeemed." 
 
 " Tou — Tousaaint Breda — the loyal ! If Heaven haa put any 
 of ita grace within you, it has shown itseH in your loyalty ; and 
 do you speak of deserting the forces raised in the name of your 
 king, and acting upon the decrees of his enemies P Explain to 
 me, my aon, how this can be. It seema to me that I can scarcely 
 be yet awake." 
 
 " And to me, it seema, father, that never till now have I been 
 awake. Tet it was in no vain dream that I served my king. 
 If he is now where he can read the hearts of hia aervants, he 
 knows that it was not for my command, or for any other dignity 
 and reward, that I came hither, and have fought under the royal 
 flag of France. It was from reverence and duty to him, under 
 God. He is now in heaven ; we have no king ; and my loyalty 
 is due elsewhere. I know not how it might have been if he had 
 atiU lived ; for it seems to me now that God has established a 
 higher royalty among men than even that of an anointed sove- 
 reign over the fortunes of many millions of men. I think now 
 that the rule which the free man lias over his own soul, over

 time and eternity — subject only to God's will — is a nobler 
 authority than that of kings ; but, however I might have 
 thought, our king no longer lives ; and, by God's mercy, as it 
 seems to me now, while the hearts of the blacks feel orphaned 
 and desolate, am object is held forth to us for the adoration of 
 our loyalty — an object higher than throne and crown, and offered 
 us by the hand of the King of kings." 
 
 " Do yon mean freedom, my son ? Remember that it is in 
 the name of freedom that the Fi-ench rebels have committed 
 the crimes which — which it would consume the night to tell of, 
 and which no one knows better, or abhors more, than yourself." 
 
 " It is true ; but they struggled for this and that, and the 
 other right and privilege existing in societies of those who are 
 fully admitted to be men. In the struggle, crime has been 
 victorious, and they have kiRed their king. The object of my 
 devotion wiQ now be nothing that has to be wrenched from an 
 anointed ruler, nothing which can be gained by violence — ^no- 
 thing but that which, being already granted, requires only to be 
 cherished, and may best be cherished in peace— the manhood of 
 my race. To this must I henceforth be loyal." 
 
 " How can men be less slaves than the negroes of St. Do- 
 mingo of late ? No real change has taken place ; and yet you, 
 who wept that freedom as rebellion, are now proposing to add 
 your force to it." 
 
 " And was it not rebellion ? Some rose for the plunder of 
 their masters — some from ambition — some from revenge — 
 many to escape from a condition they had not patience to endure. 
 All this was corrupt ; and the corruption, though bred out of 
 slavery, as the fever from the marshes, grieved my soul as if I 
 had not known the cause. But now, knowing the cause, and 
 others (knowing it also) having decreed that slavery is at an 
 end, and given the sanction of law and national sympathy to our 
 freedom — is not the case changed ? Is it now a folly or a sin to 
 desire to realise and purify and elevate this freedom, that those 
 who were first slaves and then savages may at length become 
 men — not in decrees and proclamations only, but in their own 
 souls P Tou do not answer, father. Is it not so ? " 
 
 " Open yourself further, my son. Declare what you propose. 
 I fear you are perplexing yourself." 
 
 " If I am deceived, father, I look for light from heaven through 
 you." 
 
 " I fear — I fear, my son ! I do not find in you to-night the 
 tone of humility and reliance upon religion in which you found 
 comfort the first time you opened the conflicts of your heart to 
 me. Tou remember that night, my son ? " 
 
 " The first night of my freedom ? Never shall I forget its 
 agonies."

 " I rejoice to hear it. Those agonies were safer, mdre accept- 
 able to God, than the comforts of self-will." 
 
 " My father, if my will ensnares me, lay open the snare— I 
 say not for the sake of my soul only— but for far, far more— for 
 the sake of my children, for the sake of my race, for the sake of 
 the glory of God in His dealings with men, bring me back if I 
 stray." 
 
 " Well. Explain — explain what you propose." 
 
 " I cannot remain in an army opposed to what are now the 
 legal rights of the blacks." 
 
 " Ton will give up your command ? " 
 
 "IshaU." 
 
 " And your boys — what will you do with them ? " 
 
 " Send them whence they came for the present. I shall dis- 
 miss them by one road, while the resignation of my rank goes 
 by another." 
 
 " And you yourself by a third." 
 
 " When I hiTe declared myself to General Hermona." 
 
 " Have you thoughts of taking your soldiers with you ? '' 
 
 "No." 
 
 " But what is right for you is right for them." 
 
 " If they so decide for themselves. My power over them is 
 great. They would follow me vrith a word. I shall therefore 
 avoid speaking that word, as it would be a false first step in a 
 career of freedom, to make them enter upon it as slaves to my 
 opinion and my will." 
 
 " But you wOl at least address them, that they may under- 
 stand the course yon pursue. The festival of this morning vrill 
 afford an opportunity — after mass. Have you thought of this? — 
 I do not say that I am advising it, or sanctioning any part of 
 your plan, but have you thought of this ? " 
 
 "I have, and dismissed the thought. The proclamation 
 will speak for itself. I act from no information which is not 
 open to them all. They can act, thank God, for themselves ; 
 and I will not seduce them into subservience, or haste, or 
 passion." 
 
 " But you will be giving up everything. What can make you 
 think that the French at Cap, aU in the interest of the planters, 
 will receive you P " 
 
 " I do not think it ; and I shall not offer myself." 
 
 " Then you will sink into nothing. Tou wUl no longer be an 
 officer, nor even a soldier. Tou will be a mere negro, where 
 negroes are wholly despised. After all that you have been, you 
 will be nothing." 
 
 " I shall be a true man." 
 
 " Tou will sink to less than nothing. Tou will be worse than 
 useless before God and man. Tou will be held a traitor."

 " I shall ; but it mil be for the sake of a higher fidelity." 
 
 There was a long pause, alter which Laxabon said, in a tone 
 half severe, and half doubting — 
 
 " So, here ends your career ! You wiU dig a piece of ground 
 to grrow maize and plantains for your family; you will read 
 history in your piazza, and see your daughters dance in tte 
 shade, while your name will never be mentioned but as that of 
 a traitor. So here ends your career ! " 
 
 " Prom no one so often as you, father, have I heard that man's 
 career never ends." 
 
 The priest made no reply. 
 
 " How lately was it," pursued Toussaint, " that you encou- 
 raged my children, when they, who fear neither the wild buU 
 nor the tornado, looked somewhat fearfully up to the eclipsed 
 moon ? Who was it but you who told them, that though that 
 blessed light seemed blotted out from the sky, it was not so ; 
 but that behind the black shadow, God's hand was still leading 
 her on, through the heaven, stiU pouring radiance into her lamp, 
 not the less bright because it was hidden from men ? A thick 
 shadow is about to pass upon my name ; but is it not possible, 
 father, that God may still be feeding my soul with Kght — still 
 guiding me towards Himself P WiU you not once more tell me, 
 that man's career never ends ? " 
 
 " In a certain sense — in a certain sense, that is true, my son. 
 But our career here is what God has put into our own hands : 
 and it seems to me that you are throwing away His gift and His 
 favour. How will you answer when He asks you, ' What hast 
 thou done with the rank and the power I put into thy hand ? 
 How hast thou used them ? ' What can you then answer, but 
 ' I flung them away, and made myself useless and a reproach.' 
 Tou know what a station you hold in this camp — how you are 
 prized by the General for the excellence of the military disci- 
 pline you have introduced; and by me, and all the wise and 
 religious, for the sobriety of manners and purity of morals of 
 which you are an example in yourself, and which you have 
 cherished among your troops, so that your soldiers are the boast 
 of the whole alliance. Tou know this — that you unite the 
 influence of the priest with the power of the commander ; and 
 yet you are going to cast off both, with aU the duties which 
 belong to them.and sink yourself in infamy — and with yourself, the 
 virtues you ha^e advocated. How will you answer this to God?" 
 
 " Father, was there not One in whose path lay all the king- 
 doms of the world and the glory of them, and who yet chose 
 ignominy — to be despised by the world, instead of to lead it F 
 And was God severe with Him ? Forgive me, father ; but have 
 you not desired me to follow Him, though far off as the eastern 
 moon from the setting sun ? "

70 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " That was a case, my son, unique in the world. The Saviour 
 had a lot of His own. Common men have ralers appointed them 
 whom they are to serve ; and, if in rank and honour, so much 
 the greater the f avoui' of God. Tou entered this service with an 
 upright mind and pure intent ; and here, therefore, can yon 
 most safely I'emain, instead of casting yourself down from the 
 pinnacle of the temple, which, you know, the Son of God refused 
 to do. Remember His words, ' Thou shalt not tempt the Lord 
 thy God.' Be not tempted yourself, by pride of heart, to com- 
 pare your lot with that of Christ, which was unique." 
 
 "He devoted Himself for the whole race of man : He, and He 
 alone. But it seems to me that there may be periods of time 
 when changes are appointed to take place among men — ^among 
 nations, and even among races ; and that a common man may 
 then be called to devote himself for that nation, or for that race. 
 Father, I feel that the hour may be come for the negro race to be 
 redeemed ; and that I, a common man, may so far devote myself 
 as not to stand in the way of their redemption. I feel that I 
 must step out from among those who have never admitted the 
 negroes' claims to manhood. If God should open to me a way to 
 serve the blacks better, I shall be foimd ready. Meantime, not 
 for another day wUl I stand in the light of their liberties. 
 Father," he continued, with an eagerness which grew as he 
 spoke, " you know something of the souls of slaves. Tou know 
 how they are smothered in the lusts of the body, how they are 
 debased by the fear of man, how blind they are to the providence 
 of God ! Tou know how oppression has put out the eyes of 
 their souls, and withered its sinews. If now, at length, a Saviour 
 has once more for them stretched out His healing hand, and 
 bidden them see, and arise and be strong, shall I resist the 
 work ? And you, father, will you not aid it ? I would not pre- 
 sume ; but if I might say all " 
 
 " Say on, my son." 
 
 " Having reproved and raised the souls of slaves, would it not 
 henceforth be a noble work for you to guide their souls as men ? 
 If you would come among us as a soldier of Christ, who is bound 
 to no side in earthly quarrels — if you would come as to those 
 who need you most, the lowest, the poorest, the most endangered, 
 what a work may lie between this hour and your last ! What 
 may your last hour be, if, day by day, you have trained our souls 
 in the glorious liberty of the children of God ! The beginning 
 must be lowly ; but the kind heart of the Christian priest is 
 lowly : and you would humble yourself first to teach men thus, 
 — ' you were wrong to steal ' — ' you were wrong to drink ' — ' you 
 were vrrong to take more wives than one, and to strike your 
 children in passion.' Thus humbly must you begin ; but among 
 free men, how high may you not rise ? Before you die, you may

 have led tJiem to rule their own spirits, and, from the throne of 
 that sovereignty, to look far into the depths of the heavens, and 
 over the history of the world ; so that they may live in the light 
 of God's countenance, and praise Him almost like the angefi — 
 for, you know, He has made us, even us, but a little lower than 
 they." 
 
 " This would be a noble work," said Laxabon, much moved : 
 " and if God is really about to free your race, He will appoint a 
 worthy servant for the office. My duty, however, lies here. I 
 have here souls in charge, without being troubled with doubts as 
 to the intentions of God and of men. As I told you, the General 
 does not think so much as you do of this event ; nor even does 
 Jean FrauQais. If you act rashly, you will repent for ever 
 having quitted the path of loyalty and duty. I warn you to 
 pause, and see what course events will take. I admonish you 
 not hastily to desert the path of loyalty and duty." 
 
 " If it had pleased God," said Toussaint, humbly, " to release 
 me from the ignorance of slavery when He gave me freedom, I 
 might now be able to lay open my heart as I desire to do ; I 
 might declare the reasons which persuade me so strongly as I 
 feel persuaded. But I am ignorant, and unskilful in reasoning 
 with one like you, father." 
 
 " It is therefor that we are appointed to guide and help you, 
 my son. Tou now know my mind, and have received my admo- 
 nition. Let us proceed to confession ; for the morning draws on 
 towards the hour for mass." 
 
 " Father, I cannot yield to your admonition. Reprove me as 
 you will, I cannot. There is a voice within me stronger than yours." 
 
 " I fear so, my son ; nor can I doubt what that voice is, nor 
 whence it comes. I will pray for you, that you may have 
 strength to struggle with the tempter." 
 
 " Not so, father ; rather pray that I may have strength to 
 obey this new voice of duty, alone as I am, discountenanced as I 
 shaU be." 
 
 " Impossible, my son. I dare not so pray for one self -wiUed 
 and precipitate ; nor, tUl you bring a humble and obedient mind, 
 can I receive your confession. There can be no absolution where 
 there is reservation. Consider, my dear son ! I only desire you 
 to pause." 
 
 " Delay is treachery," said Toussaint. " This day the decree 
 and proclamation will be made known through the forces ; and 
 if 1 remain, this night's sun sets on my condemnation. I shall 
 not dare to pray, clothed in my rank, this night." 
 
 " Go now, my son. Tou see it is dawning. Tou have lost 
 the present opportunity; and you must now leave me to my 
 duties. When you can return hither to yours, you will be 
 welcome."

72 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 Touasaint paid him his wonted reverence, and left the tent. 
 
 Arrived in his own, he threw himself on the couch like a 
 heart-broken man. 
 
 " No help ! no guidance ! " thought he. " I am desolate and 
 alone. I never thought to have been left without a guide from 
 God. He leaves me with my sins upon my soul, unconf essed, 
 unabsolved ; and, thus burdened and rebuked, I must enter upon 
 the course which I dare not refuse. But this voice within me 
 which bids me go — whence and what is it ? Whence is it but 
 from God? And how can I therefore say that I am alone? 
 There is no man that I can rely on — not even one of Christ's 
 anointed priests ; but is there not He who redeemed men P and 
 will He reject me if, in my obedience, I come to Him ? I will 
 try — I wiU dare. I am alone ; and He will hear and help me." 
 
 Without priest, without voice, without form of words, he con- 
 fessed and prayed, and no longer felt that he was alone. He 
 arose, clear in mind and strong in heart : wrote and sealed up 
 his resignation of his commission, stepped into the next tent to 
 rouse the three boys, desiring them to dress for early mass, and 
 prepare for their return to their homes immediately afterwards. 
 He then entered his own inner apartment, where PapaUer was 
 sleeping so soundly that it was probable the early movements of 
 saint's-day festivities in the camp would not awafeen him. As 
 he could not show himself abroad tiR the General's protection 
 was secured, his host let him sleep on ; opening and shutting his 
 clothes' chest, and going through the whole preparation for 
 appearance on the parade in full uniform, without disturbing his 
 wearied guest, who hardly moved even at the roll of the drum, 
 and the stir of morning in the camp. 
 
 CHAPTER VII. 
 
 Papaliek was probably the only person in the valley who did 
 not attend mass on this saint's-day morning. The Spanish 
 general was early seen, surrounded by his staff, moving towards 
 the rising ground, outside the camp, on which stood the church, 
 erected for the use of the troops when the encampment was 
 formed. The soldiers, both Spanish and negro, had some time 
 before filed out of their tents, and been formed for their short 
 march; and they now came up in order, the whites approaching 
 on the right, and the blacks on the left, tUl their forces joined 
 before the church. The sun had not yet shone down into the

 valley, and the dew lay on the grass, and dropped like rain from 
 the broad eaves of the church-roof — ^from the points of the palm- 
 leaves with which it was thatched. 
 
 This church was little more than a covered enclosure. It was 
 well shaded from the heat of the sun by its broad and low roof ; 
 but, between the corner posts, the sides could hardly be said to 
 be filled in by the bamboos which stood like slender columns at 
 intervals of several inches, so that all that passed within could 
 be seen from without, except that the vestry and the part behind 
 the altar had their walls interwoven with withes, so as to be 
 impervious to the eye. The ground was strewn thick with moss, 
 — cushioned throughout for the knees of the worshippers. The 
 seats were rude wooden benches, except the chair, covered with 
 damask, which was reserved for the Marquis d'Hermona. 
 
 Here the General took his place, his staff ranging themselves 
 on the benches behind. Jean Pran9ais entered after him, and 
 seated himself on the opposite range of benches. Next followed 
 Toussaint Breda, alone, having left his sons outside with the 
 soldiers. Some few more advanced towards the altar ; it being 
 understood that those who did so wished to communicate. An 
 interval of a few empty benches was then left, and the lower end 
 of the church was thronged by such of the soldiery as could find 
 room ; the rest closing in round the building, so as to hear the 
 voice of the piiest, and join in the service. 
 
 There was a gay air about the assemblage, scarcely subdued 
 by the place, and the occasion which brought them to it. Almost 
 every man carried a stem of the white amaryUis, plucked from 
 among the high grass, with which it grew thickly intermixed all 
 over the valley ; and beautiful to the eye were the snovfy, droop- 
 ing blossoms, contrasted with the rich dark green of their 
 leaves. Some few brought twigs of the orange and the lime ; 
 and the sweet odour of the blossoms pervaded the place like a 
 holy incense, as the first stirring airs of morning breathed 
 around and through the building. There were smiles on almost 
 every face ; and a hum of low but joyous greetings was heard 
 without, tin the loud voice of the priest, reciting the Creed, 
 hushed every other. The only countenance of great seriousness 
 present was that of Toussaint, and his bore an expression of 
 solemnity, if not of melancholy, which struck every one who 
 looked upon him— and he always was looked upon by every one. 
 His personal qualities had strongly attracted the attention of the 
 Spanish general. Jean Fran^ais watched his every movement 
 with the mingled triumph and jealousy of a superior in rank, 
 but a rival in fame ; and by the negro troops he was so beloved, 
 that nothing but the strict discipline which he enforced could 
 have prevented their following him in crowds wherever he went. 
 Whenever he smiled, as he passed along, in conversation, they

 laughed without inquiring why; and now, this morning, on 
 observing the gravity of his countenance, they glanced from one 
 to another, as if to inquire the cause. 
 
 The priest, having communicated, at length descended from 
 before the altar, to administer the water to such as desired to 
 receive it. Among these, Toussaint bent his head lowest — so 
 low, that the first slanting sunbeam that entered beneath the 
 thateh seemed to rest upon his head, while every other head 
 remained in the shadow of the roof. In after days, the negroes 
 then present recalled this appearance. Jean Fran9ai8, observing 
 that General Hermona was making some remark about Toussaint 
 to the ofiicers about him, endeavoured to assume an expression 
 of deep devotion also ; but in vain. No one thought of saying 
 of him what the General was at that moment saying of his 
 brother in arms — " God could not visit a soul more pure." 
 
 When the blessing had been given, and the few concluding 
 verses of Scripture read, the General was the first to leave his 
 place. It seemed as if he and Toussaint moved towards one 
 another by the same impulse, for they met in the aisle between 
 the benches. 
 
 " I have a few words of business to speak with you. General 
 — a work of justice to ask you to perform without delay," said 
 Toussaint. 
 
 " Good ! " said the General. " In justice there should be no 
 delay. I will therefore breakfast with you in your tent. Shall 
 we proceed ? " 
 
 He put his arm within that of Toussaint, who, however, 
 gently withdrew his, and stepped back with a profound bow of 
 respect. General Hermona looked as if he scarcely knew 
 whether to take this as an act of humility, or to be offended ; 
 but he smiled on Toussaint's saying — 
 
 " It is not without reasons that I decline honour in this place 
 this morning — reasons which I will explain. Shall I conduct 
 you to my tent ? And these gentlemen of your staff P " 
 
 "As we have business, my friend, I wUl come alone. I shall 
 be sorry if there is any quarrel between us, Toussaint. If you 
 have to ask justice of me, I declare to you I know not the 
 cause." 
 
 "It is not for myself, General, that I ask justice. I have 
 ever received from you more than justice." 
 
 "Tou have attached your men to yourself with singular 
 skill," said the General, on their way down the slope from the 
 church, as he closely observed the countenances of the black 
 soldiers, which brightened, as if touched by the sunlight, on the 
 approach of their commander. " Their attachment to you is 
 singular. I no longer wonder at your achievements in the 
 field."

INDIFFERENT TO PROMOTION. 75 
 
 " It is by no skill of mine," replied Toussaint ; " it is by the 
 power of past tyranny. The hearts of negroes are made to love. 
 Hitherto, all love in which the mind could share has been be- 
 stowed upon those who degraded and despised them. In me 
 they see one whom, while obeying, they may love as a brother." 
 
 " The same might be said of Jean Frangais, as far as your 
 reasons go; but Jean !Fran9ais is not beloved like you. He 
 looks gayer than you, my friend, notwithstanding. He is happy 
 in his new rank, probably. Ton have heard that he is ennobled 
 by the court of Spain ? " 
 
 " I had not heard it. It will please him." 
 
 " It evidently does. He is made a noble ; and his militai-y 
 rank is now that of lieutenant-general. Tour turn wUl come 
 next, my friend ; and if promotion went strictly according to 
 personal merit, no one would have been advanced sooner than 
 
 you." 
 
 " I do not desire promotion, and " 
 
 "Ah! there your stoical philosophy comes in. But I will 
 show you another way of applying it. Rank brings cares ; so 
 that one who is not a stoic may have an excuse for shrinking 
 from it ; but a stoic despises cares. Ha ! we have some young 
 soldiers here," he said, as Moyse and his cousins stood beside 
 the way, to make their obeisance ; " and very perfect soldiers 
 they look, young as they are. They seem bom for military 
 service." 
 
 " They were born slaves, my lord ; but they have now the 
 loyal hearts of freemen within them, amidst the ignorance and 
 follies of their youth." 
 
 " They are " 
 
 " My nephew and my two sons, my lord." 
 
 " And why mounted at this hour ? " 
 
 "They are going to their homes, by my direction." 
 
 '' If it were not that you have business with me, which I 
 suppose you desire them not to overhear " 
 
 " It is as you say, General." 
 
 " If it had not been so, I would have requested that they 
 might be at our table this morning. As it is, I wUl not delay 
 their journey." 
 
 And the General touched his hat to the lads, with a gracious- 
 ness which made them bend low their uncovered heads, and 
 report marvels at home of the deportment of the Marquis 
 d'Hermona. Seeing how their father was occupied, they were 
 satisfied with a grasp of his hand as he passed, received from 
 him a letter for their mother, and waited only tiU he and his 
 guest had disappeared within the tent, to gallop of£. They 
 wondered at being made the bearers of a letter, as they 
 knew that his horse was ordered to be readv beside his tent

 immediately after breakfast, aud had not a doubt of his arriving 
 at the shore almost as soon as themselves. 
 
 PapaJier was lounging on the couch beside the table where 
 breakfast was spread, when General Hermona aud his host 
 entered. He started up, casting a look of doubt upon Tous- 
 saint. 
 
 "Fear nothing, M. Papalier," said Toussaint; "General Her- 
 mona has engaged to listen to my plea for justice. My lord, 
 M. Papalier was amicably received by your lordship on crossing 
 the frontier, and, on the strength of your welcome, has remained 
 on the island tiU too late to escape, without your especial pro- 
 tection, a fate he dreads." 
 
 " Tou mean being delivered up as a republican P " 
 
 " Into the hands of my own negroes, my lord," said Papalier, 
 bitterly. " That is the fate secretly designed for any unfortu- 
 nate planter who may yet have survived the recent troubles over 
 the frontier." 
 
 " But how can I protect you ? The arrangement is none of 
 mine : I cannot interfere with it." 
 
 " Only by forgetting in this single instance the point of time 
 at which we have arrived, and furnishing me with a pass which 
 shall enable me to sail for Europe, as I acknowledge I ought to 
 have done long ago." 
 
 " So this is the act of justice you asked from me, Toussaint ! 
 Why did you not say favour ? I shall do it with much more 
 pleasure as a slight favour to one whom I strongly regard. 
 Tou shall have your safe-conduct, M. Papalier. In the mean- 
 time " 
 
 And he looked towards the steaming chocolate and the piles 
 of fruit on the table, as if his appetite were growing urgent. 
 
 " One word more, my lord, before ofEering you my welcome 
 to my table," said Toussaint. "I beseech you to consider the 
 granting this pass as an act of justice, or of anything rather 
 than favour to me. Yesterday, I would have accepted ahundred 
 favours from you : to-day, with equal respect, I must refuse 
 even one. I pledge myself to tell you why before you rise from 
 table, to which I now invite you." 
 
 " I do not understand all this, Toussaint." 
 
 "I have pledged myself to explain." 
 
 "And you say there is no personal feeling— no ofEence 
 between us ? " 
 
 "If any, my lord, I alone am the offender. Will you be 
 pleased to " 
 
 " Oh, yes, I wiU breakfast ; and was never more ready. M. 
 Papalier, our morning mass has kept you waiting, 1 fear."

 he saw his negro host preparing to take his place between his

 two guests, Papalier had never yet sat at table with a negro, 
 and his impulse was to resent the necessity ; hut a stern look 
 from the General warned him to submit quietly to the usages 
 of the new state of society which he had remained to witness ; 
 and he sat through the meal, joining occasionally in the con- 
 versation, which, for his sake, was kept clear of subjects which 
 might annoy him. 
 
 As soon as the servants, after producing pen, ink, and paper, 
 had withdrawn, the General wrote a safe-conduct, and delivered 
 it to M. Papalier, with an intimation that an attendant should 
 be ready to guide him to the nearest port, at his earliest conve- 
 nience. Papalier understood this as it was meant — as a hint 
 ,that there must be no delay. He declared, therefore, his wish 
 to depart, as soon as the heat of the day should decline. 
 
 " And now, my lord ," said Toussaint, 
 
 " Tes, now for the explanation of this fancy of not receiving 
 kindness from your best friends. Let us hear." 
 
 " I have this morning, my lord, despatched letters to Don 
 Joachim Garcia, at St. Domingo " 
 
 " Tou are in communication with the Colonial Government ; 
 and not through me ! What can this mean ? " 
 
 " And here, my lord, are exact copies of my letters, which I 
 request the favour of you to read, and, if I may be permitted to 
 say so, without haste or prejudice — ^though, in this case, it is 
 much to ask." 
 
 Toussaint disappeared in the inner apartment; but not before 
 he saw a smile on Papalier's face— a smile which told of amuse- 
 ment at the idea of a negro sending dispatches of any import- 
 ance to the head of the government of the Spanish colony. 
 
 The General did not seem to feel any of the same amusement. 
 His countenance was perplexed and anxious. He certainly 
 obeyed Toussaint's wishes as to not being in haste ; for he read 
 the papers (which were few and short) again and again. He 
 had not laid them down when Toussaint reappeared from within 
 — no longer glittering in his uniform and polished arms, but 
 dressed in his old plantation clothes, and with his wooUen cap in 
 his hand. Both his guests first gazed at him, and then started 
 from their seats. 
 
 Toussaint merely passed through the tent, bowing low to the 
 General, and bidding him farewell. A confused noise outside, 
 followed by a shout, roused Hermona from his astonishment. 
 
 " He is addressing the troops ! " he cried, drawing his sword, 
 and rushing forth. 
 
 Toussaint was not addressing the troops. He was merely in- 
 forming Jacques, whom he had requested to be in waiting there, 
 beside his horse, that he was no longer a commander — no longer 
 in the forces ; and that the recent proclamation, by showing ffim

 that the cause of negro freedom was now one with that of the' 
 present government of Prance, was the reason of his retirement 
 from the Spanish territory. He explained himself thus far, in 
 order that he might not be considered a traitor to the lost cause 
 of royalty in France; but, rather, loyal to that of his colour, 
 from the first day of its becoming a cause. 
 
 Numbers became aware that something unusual was going 
 forward, and were thronging to the spot, when the General 
 rushed forth, sword in hand, shouting aloud — 
 
 " The traitor ! Seize the traitor ! Soldiers ! seize the 
 traitor ! " 
 
 Toussaint turned in an instant, and sprang upon his horse. 
 Not a negro would lay hands on him ; but they cast upon him, 
 in token of honour, the blossoms of the amaryilis and the orange 
 that they carried. The Spanish soldiers, however, endeavoured 
 to close round him and hem him in, as the General's voice was 
 still heard — 
 
 " Seize him ! Bring him in, dead or alive ! " 
 
 Toussaint, however, was a perfect horseman ; and his favourite 
 horse served him well in this crisis. It burst through, or bounded 
 over, all opposition, and, amidst a shower of white blossoms 
 which strewed the way, instantly carried him beyond the camp. 
 Well-mounted soldiers, and many of them, were behind, how- 
 ever ; and it was a hard race between the fugitive and his pur- 
 suers, as it was witnessed from the camp. Along the river bank, 
 and over the bridge, the danger of Toussaint appeared extreme ; 
 and the negroes, watching the countenance of Jacques, preserved 
 a dead silence when all the horsemen had disappeared in the 
 woods which clothed the steep. Then all eyes were turned 
 towards the summit of that ridge, where the road crossed a 
 space clear of trees; and there, in an incredibly short time, 
 appeared the solitary horseman, who, unencumbered with heavy 
 arms, and lightly clothed, had greatly the advantage of the 
 soldiers in mounting the ascent. He was still followed; but he 
 was just disappearing over the ridge, when the foremost soldier 
 issued from the wood behind him. 
 
 " He is safe ! he is safe ! " was murmured through the throng ; 
 and the words reached the ears of the General in a tone which 
 convinced him that the attachment of the black troops to Tons- 
 saint Breda was as strong as he himself had that morning de- 
 clared it to be. 
 
 " Now you see. General," said Papalier, turning into the tent^ 
 from which he too had come forth in the excitement of the scene 
 — " you see what you have to expect from these negroes." 
 
 ''I see what I have to expect from you," replied the General, 
 with severity. '' It is enough to witness how yon speak of a man to 
 whom you owe your life this very day— and not for the first time."

AN ANXIOUS POSITION. 79 
 
 " Nay, General, I have called him no names — not even 
 'traitor.'" 
 
 " I have not owed him my life, M. Papalier ; and you are not 
 the commander of these forces. It is my duty to prevent the 
 defection of the negro troops ; and I therefore used the language 
 of the government I serve in proclaiming him a traitor. Had it 
 been in mere speculation between him and myself that those 
 papers had come in question, God knows I should have called 
 him something very difEerent." 
 
 " There is something in the man that infatuates — that blinds 
 one's judgment, certainly," said Papalier. " His master. Bayou, 
 spoiled him with letting him educate himself to an absm-d ex- 
 tent. I always told Bayou so ; and there is no saying now what 
 the consequences may be. It is my opinion that we have not 
 heard the last of him yet." 
 
 " Probably," said the General, gathering up his papers as his 
 aide entered, and leaving the tent in conversation with him, 
 almost without a farewell notice of Papalier. 
 
 The negro troops were busy to a man, in learning from 
 Jacques, and repeating to one another, the particulars of what 
 was in the proclamation, and the reasons of Toussaint's depar- 
 ture. General Hermona found that the two remaining black 
 leaders, Jean Prangais and Biasson, were not infected by Tous- 
 saint's convictions; that, on the contrary, they were far from 
 sorry that he was thus gone, leaving them to the full enjoyment 
 of Spanish grace. They addressed their soldiers in favour of 
 loyalty, and in denunciation of treason, and treated the pro- 
 clamation as slightly as Don Joachim Garcia could possibly 
 have wished. They met with little response, however; and 
 every one felt, amidst the show and parade and festivity of the 
 day, a restlessness and uncertainty which he perceived existed 
 no less in his neighbour than in himself. No one's mind was 
 in the business or enjoyment of the festival ; and no one could 
 be greatly surprised at anything that might take place, though 
 the men were sufficiently orderly in the discharge of their duty 
 to render any interference with them unwarrantable, and any 
 precautions against their defection impossible. The great hope 
 lay in the influence of the two leaders who remained, as the great 
 fear was of that of the one who was gone. 
 
 The Spanish force was small, constituting only about one- 
 fourth of the whole ; and of these, the besjt mounted had not 
 returned from the pursuit of Toussaint; — not because they could 
 follow him far in the enemy's country, but because it required 
 some skill and caution to get back in broad day, after having 
 roused expectation all along the road. 
 
 While the leaders were anxiously calculating probabilities, 
 ind reckoning forces, Jacques was satisfying himself that the

 preponderance of numbers was greatly on the side of his absent 
 friend. His hatred of the whites, which had never intermitted, 
 was wrought up to strong passion this day by the treatment 
 the proclamation and his friend had received. He exulted in 
 the thought of being able to humble the Spaniards by withdraw- 
 ing the force which enabled them to hold their posts, and by 
 making him whom they called a traitor more powerful in the 
 cause of the blacks than they could henceforth be in that ot 
 royalist France. Fired with these thoughts, he was hastily 
 passing the tent of Toussaint, which he had supposed deserted^ 
 when he heard from within, speaking in anger and fear, a voice 
 which he well knew, and which had power over him. He had 
 strong reasons for remembering the first time he had seen The- 
 rese — on the night of the escape across the frontier. She was 
 strongly associated with his feelings towards the class to which 
 her owner belonged ; and he knew that she, beautiful, lonely, 
 and wretched, shared those feelings. If he had not known 
 this from words dropped by her during the events of this morn- 
 ing, he would have learned it now ; for she was declaring her 
 thoughts to her master, loudly enough for any one who passed 
 by to overhear. 
 
 Jacques entered the tent, and there stood Thferese, declaring 
 that she would leave her master, and never see him more, but 
 prevented from escaping by Papalier having intercepted her 
 passage to the entrance. Her eyes glowed with delight on the 
 appearance of Jacques, to whom she immediately addressed 
 herself. 
 
 " I will not go with him — I will not go with him to Paris, to 
 see his young ladies. He shall not take care of me. I will 
 take care of myself. I will drown myself sooner than go with 
 him. I do not care what becomes of me, but I will not go." 
 
 " Tes, you will care what becomes of you, Therese, because 
 your own people care," said Jacques. " I will protect you. If 
 you will be my wife, no white shall molest you again." 
 
 " Be your wife ! " 
 
 " Tes. I love the blacks ; and none so much as those whom 
 the whites have oppressed — no one so much as you. If you will 
 be my wife, we will " 
 
 Here, remembering the presence of a white, Jacques explained 
 to Th&ese in the negro language (which she understood, though 
 she always spoke French), the new hopes which had arisen for 
 the blacks, and his own intention of following Toussaint, to make 
 him a chief. He concluded in good French, smiling maliciously 
 at Papalier as he spoke — 
 
 " Tou wiU come with me now to the priest, and be my wife." 
 
 " I will," replied ThSrese, calmly. 
 
 "Go," said Papalier. "Tou have my leave. I am thus

 honourably released from the care of you till times shaU change. 
 I am glad that you will not remain unprotected, at least." 
 
 " Unprotected ! " exclaimed Th&ese, as she threw on the 
 Spanish mantle which she was now accustomed to wear abroad. 
 " Unprotected ! And what has your protection been? " 
 
 "Very kind, my dear, I am sure. I have spent on your 
 education money which I should be very glad of now. When 
 people flatter you, TMrese (as they will do ; for there is not 
 a negress in all the island to compare with you), — remember 
 who made you a lady. Tou will promise me that much, Therdse, 
 at parting ? " 
 
 " Remember who made me a lady ! — I have forgotten too long 
 who made me a woman," said Th^rese, devoutly upraising her 
 eyes. " In serving Him and loving my husband, I will strive to 
 forget you." 
 
 " All alike ! " muttered Papalier, as the pair went out. " This 
 is wha,t one may expect from negroes, as the General will learn 
 when he has had enough to do with them. They are all alike." 
 
 This great event in the life of Jacques Dessalines did not 
 delay his proceedings for more than haK-an-hour. Noon was 
 but just past, when he led forth his wife from the presence of 
 the priest, mounted her on his own horse before his tent, and 
 sent her forward under the escort of his personal servant, pro- 
 mising to overtake her almost as soon as she should have crossed 
 the river. When she was gone, he sent the word through the 
 negro soldiery, who gathered round him almost to a man, and 
 with the quietness which became their superior force. Jean 
 Franpais and Biasson were left with scarcely twenty followers 
 each ; and those few would do nothing. The whites felt them- 
 selves powerless amidst the noon-day heats, and opposed to 
 threefold numbers : and their officers found that nothing was to 
 be done but to allow them to look on quietly, while Jacques led 
 away his little army, with loud music and a streaming white 
 flag. A few horsemen led the van, and closed in the rear. The 
 rest marched, as if on a holiday trip, now singing to the music 
 of the band, and now making the hiUs ring again with the name 
 of Toussaint Breda. 
 
 As General Hermona, entirely indisposed for his siesta, 
 watched the march through his glass from the entrance of his 
 tent, while the notes of the wind-instruments swelled and died 
 away in the still air, one of his aides was overheard by him to 
 say to another — 
 
 " The General has probably changed his opinion since he said 
 to you this morning, of Toussaint Breda, that God could not 
 visit a soul more pure. We have all had to change our minds 
 rather more rapidly than suits such a warm climate." 
 
 "Tou may have changed your opinions since the sun

 rose, gentlemen," said Hermona; "but I am not sure that I 
 haye." 
 
 " How ! Is it possible ? We do not understand you, my 
 
 " Do you suppose that you understand him ? Have we been 
 of a degraded race, slaves, and suddenly offered restoration to 
 full manhood and citizenship P How otherwise can we under- 
 stand this man P I do not profess to do so." 
 
 " Tou think well of him, my lord P " 
 
 " I am so disposed. Time, however, will show._ He has 
 gone away magnanimously enough, alone, and believing, I am 
 confident, from what Father Laxabon tells me, that his career is 
 closed ; but I rather think we shall hear more of him." 
 
 " How these people revel in music ! " observed one of the staff. 
 " How they are pouring it forth now ! " 
 
 "And not without reason, surely," said Hermona. "It is 
 their exodus that we are watching." 
 
 CHAPTER VIII. 
 
 BREDA AGAIN. 
 
 The French proclamation was eflB.ciently published along the 
 line of march of the blacks. They shouted and sang the tidings 
 of their freedom, joining with them the name of Toussaint 
 Breda. These tidings of freedom rang through the ravines, and 
 echoed up the sides of the hills, and through the depths of the 
 forests, startling the wild birds on the mountain ponds and the 
 deer among the high ferns ; and bringing down from their fast- 
 nesses a multitude of men who had fled thither from the ven- 
 geance of the whites and mulattoes, and to escape sharing in the 
 violence of the negro force which Jean Fran9ais had left behind 
 him, to pursue uncontrolled their course of plunder and butchery. 
 Glad, to such, were the tidings of freedom, with order, and 
 under the command of one whose name was never mentioned 
 without respect, if not enthusiasm. The negro who did not 
 know that there was any more world on the other side the 
 Cibao peaks, had yet learned to be proud of the learning of 
 Toussaint. The slave who conceived of God as dwelling in the 
 innermost of the Mornes, and coming forth to govern His sub- 
 jects with the fire of the lightning and the scythe of the hurri- 
 cane, was yet able to revere the piety of Toussaint. The black 
 bandit who had dipped his hands in the blood of his master, and 
 feasted his ear with the groans of the innocent babes who had 
 sat upon his knee, yet felt that there was something impressive 
 in the simple habit of forgiveness, the vigilant spirit of mercy

IN SEARCH OF TOUSSAINT. 83 
 
 which distinguished Toussaint Breda from all his brethren in 
 arms — from all the leading men of his colour, except his friend 
 Henri Ohristophe. At the name of Toussaint Breda, then, these 
 flocked down into the road by hundreds, till they swelled the 
 numbers of the march to thousands. The Spanish soldiers, re- 
 turning to their camp by such by-ways as they could find, heard 
 again and again from a distance the cries of welcome and of 
 triumph; and one or two of them chanced to witness from a 
 high point of rock, or through a thick screen of foliage, the 
 joyous progress of the little army, hastening on to find their 
 chief. These involuntary spies gathered at every point of obser- 
 vation news which would gall the very soul of Jean FranQais, if 
 they should get back to the camp to tell it. 
 
 Jacques knew where to seek his friend, and led the way, on 
 descending from the hUls, straight across the plain to the Breda 
 estate, where Toussaint meant to await his family. How un- 
 like was this plantation to what it was when these negroes had 
 seen it last ! The cane-fields, heretofore so trim and orderly, 
 with the tall canes springing from the clean black soil, ^rere now 
 a jungle. The old plants had run up till they had leanbd over 
 with their own weight, and fallen upon one another. Their 
 suckers had sprung up in myriads, so that the racoon which 
 burrowed among them could scarcely make its way in and out. 
 The grass on the little enclosed lawns grew so rank, that the 
 cattle, now wild, were almost hidden as they lay down in it; 
 and so uneven and unsightly were the patches of growth, that 
 the blossoming shrubs with which it had been sprinkled for 
 ornament, now looked forlorn and out of place, flowering amidst 
 the desolation. The slave-quarter was scarcely distinguishable 
 from the wood behind it, so nearly was it overgrown with 
 weeds. A young foal was browsing on the thatch, and a crowd 
 of glittering lizards darted out and away on the approach of 
 human feet. 
 
 Jacques did not stay at the slave quarter ; but he desired his 
 company to remain there and in the neighbouring field, while he 
 went with Therese to bring out their chief to them. They went 
 up to the house ; but in no one of its deserted chambers did they 
 find Toussaint. 
 
 " Perhaps he is in his own cottage," said Therese. 
 
 " Is it possible," replied Jacques, " that, with this fine house 
 all to himself, he should take up with that old hut ? " 
 
 " Let us see," said Ther&se ; " for he is certainly not here." 
 
 When they reached Toussaint's cottage, it was no easy matter 
 to know how to effect an entrance. Enormous gourds had 
 spread their network over the ground, like traps for the feet of 
 trespassers. The front of the piazza was completely overgrown 
 with the creepers which had been brought there only to cover 
 f2

 the posts, and hang their blossoms from the eaves. They had 
 now spread and tangled themselves, till they made the house 
 look like a thicket. In one place, however, between two of the 
 posts, they had been torn down, and the evening wind was toss- 
 ing the loose coils about. Jacques entered the gap, and imme- 
 diately looked out again, smiling, and beckoning Therese to come 
 and see. There, in the piazza, they found Toussaint, stretched 
 asleep upon the bench — so soundly asleep, for once, that the 
 whispers of his friends did not alter, for a moment, his heavy 
 breathing. 
 
 " How tired he must be ! " said Jacques. " At other times I 
 have known his sleep so light, that he was broad awake as quick 
 as a lizard, if a beetle did but sail over his head." 
 
 " He may well be tired," said Therese. " You know how 
 weary he looked at mass this morning. I believe he had no rest 
 last night ; and now this march to-day " 
 
 "Well! He must rouse up now, however; for his business 
 will not wait." And he called him by his name. 
 
 " Henri ! " cried Toussaint, starting up. 
 
 " STo, not Henri. I am Jacques. Ton are not awake yet, and 
 the place is dax'k. I am your friend Jacques, five inches shorter 
 than Henri. You see ? " 
 
 "You here, Jacques! and Therese! Surelyl am not awake yet." 
 
 " Yes, you are, now you know Therese — whom yon will 
 henceforth look upon as my wife. We are both free of the 
 whites now, for ever." 
 
 " Is it possible ? " 
 
 " It is true ; and we wiU tell you all presently. But first 
 explain why you called me Henri as you woke. If we could see 
 Henri Why did you name Henri ? " 
 
 " Because he was the next person I expected to see. I met one 
 on the way who knew where he was, and took a message to him." 
 
 " If we could learn from Henri " said Jacques. 
 
 " Here is Henri," said the calm, kindly, weU-known voice of 
 the powerful Ohristophe, who now showed himself outside. The 
 other went out to him, and greeted him heartily. 
 
 "What news, Henri? " asked Toussaint. " How are affairs 
 at Cap ? What is doing about the proclamation there ? " 
 
 " Affairs are going badly at Cap. The mulattoes wiU no more 
 bear our proclamation than the whites would bear theirs. They 
 have shut up General Laveaux in prison; and the French, 
 without their military leader, do not know what to do next. 
 The commissary has no authority, and talks of embarking for 
 Prance ; and the troops are cursing the negroes, for whose sake, 
 they say, their General is imprisoned, and will soon die of the 
 heats." 
 
 " We must deliver General Laveaux," said Toussaint " Our

A PLAN OF ACTION. 85 
 
 work already lies straight before us. We must raise a force. 
 Henri, can you bring soldiers ? " 
 
 " Ay, Henri," said Jacques, " what force can you bring to join 
 ours ? General Toussaint Breda has six thousand here at hand, 
 half of whom are disciplined soldiers, well armed. The rest are 
 partially armed, and have strong hearts and ready hands." 
 
 Toussaint turned round, as if to know what Jacques could 
 mean. 
 
 " General," said Jacques, " the army I speak of is there, 
 »mong those fields, burning to greet you their commander ; but 
 in the meantime, I believe, supping heartily on whatever they 
 can find in your wilderness here, in the shape of maize, pump- 
 kins, and plantains — and what else, you know better than I. 
 That is right, Therese ; rest yourself in the piazza, and I will 
 bring you some supper, too." 
 
 " Six thousand, did you say, Jacques ? " said Henri. " I can 
 rally two thousand this night, and more wiU join on the way." 
 
 "We must free Laveaux before- sunrise," said Toussaint. 
 " Will our troops be fit for a march after this supper of theirs, 
 Jacques — after supper and three hours' rest ? " 
 
 " They are fit at this moment to march over the island — to 
 swim from St. Domingo to Prance, if you wUl only lead them," 
 replied Jacques. " Go to them, and they wiU do what you wiU.." 
 
 " So be it ! " said Toussaint, his bosom for a moment heaving 
 with the thought that his career, even as viewed by Father Laxa- 
 bon, was not ended, " Henri, what is the state of the plain ? Is 
 the road open 1 " 
 
 " Far from it. The mulattoes are suspicious, and on the watch 
 against some danger-^I believe they are not clear what. I 
 avoided some of their scouts ; and the long way they made me 
 go round was the reason of my being late." 
 
 Observing that Toussaint looked thoughtful, he proceeded : 
 " I imagine there is no force in the plain that could resist your 
 numbers, if you ai'e sure of your troops. The road is open, if 
 they choose that it be so." 
 
 " I am sure of only haK of them ; and then there is the town. 
 It seems to me, Jacques, that I may more depend upon my 
 troops, in their present mood, for a merry night march, though 
 it be a long one, than for a skirmish through the plain, though 
 it be a short one." 
 
 Jacques assented. It was agreed that the little army should 
 proceed by the mountain tracts, round by Plaisance and Gros 
 Mome, so as to arrive by the Haut-du-Oap, in which direction 
 it was not likely that a foe should be looked for. Thus they 
 could pour into the town from the western heights before sun- 
 rise, while the scouts of the mulatto rebels were looking for them 
 across the eastern plain. 
 


## p. (#90) #################################################

86 THE HOUR AND THB MAN. 
 
 This settled, Jacques went down among liis forces, to tell them 
 that their general was engaged in a council of war — Henri 
 Christophe having joined from Cap, with a promise of troops, 
 and with intelligence which would open the way to victory and 
 freedom. The general allowed them ten minutes more for 
 refreshment, and to form themselves into order ; and he would 
 then present himself to them. Shouting was forbidden, lest any 
 foe should be within hearing; but a murmur of delight and 
 mutual congratulation ran through the ranks, which were begin- 
 ning to form while the leader of their march was yet spejiking. 
 He retreated, carrying with him the best arms he could select 
 for the use of his general. 
 
 While he was gone, Toussaint stepped back into the piazza, 
 where Therese sat quietly watching the birds flitting in and out 
 among the foliage and flowers. 
 
 " Therese," said he, " what will you do this night and to- 
 morrow ? Who will take care of you P " 
 
 " I know not — I care not," said she. " There are no whites 
 here ; and I am well where they are not. WiU you not let me 
 stay here ? " 
 
 " Did Jacques say, and say truly, that you are his wife .P " 
 
 " He said so, and truly. I have been wretched, for 
 long " 
 
 " And sinful. Wretchedness and sin go together." 
 
 " And I was sinful ; but no one told me so. I was ignorant, 
 and weak, and a slave. Now I am a woman and a wife. No 
 more whites, no more sin, no more misery ! Will you not let 
 me stay here ? " 
 
 " I will : and here yon will presently be safe, and well cared 
 for, I hope. Mjr vpife and my chilc&en are coming home — 
 coming.probably inafewhours. They will make this a home 
 to you till Jacques can give you one of your own. Tou shall be 
 guarded here till my Margot arrives. Shall it be so P " 
 
 " Shall it ? Oh, thank God ! Jacques," she cried, as she heard 
 her husband's step approaching. " Oh, Jacques ! I am happy. 
 Toussaint Breda is kind — he has forgiven me— he welcomes 
 me — his wife will ■' " 
 
 Tears drowned her voice. Toussaint said gently — 
 
 " It is not for me to forgive, Therese, whom you have never 
 offended. God has forgiven, I trust, your young years of sin. 
 Tou will atone (will you not ?) by the purity of your life— by 
 watching over others, lest they suflEer as you have done. Tou 
 wiU guard the minds of my young daughters : wiU you not .P 
 Tou will thank God through my Genifrede, my Aimee ? " 
 
 " I wiU, I will," she eagerly cried, lifting up her face, bright 
 through her tears. " Indeed my heart will be pure— longs to 
 be pure." °

NEWS OF THE DEFECTION. 87 
 
 "I know it, Therese," said Toussaint. "I have always 
 believed it, and I now know it." 
 
 He turned to Jacques and said — 
 
 " Tou declare yourself to be under my command P '' 
 
 " Yes, Toussaint ; you are my general" 
 
 " "Well, then, I appoint you to the duty of remaining here, 
 with a troop, to guard my family (who are coming in a few 
 hours), and this estate. I have some hopes of doing what I want 
 at Cap without striking a blow ; and you will be better here. 
 Tou hate the whites too much to Kke my warfare. Tarewell, 
 Therese ! Jacques, foUow me, to receive your troop." 
 
 CHAPTER IX. 
 
 THE MAN. 
 
 The town of Cap Franijais was next morning in a hurry, which 
 attracted the attention of General Laveaux in his prison, and the 
 French commissary, Polverel, on board the vessel in the roads, 
 in which he had taken refuge from the mulattoes, and where he 
 held himself in readiness to set saU for France, in case of any- 
 grave disaster befalling the General or the troops. From his cell, 
 Laveaux heard in the streets the tramp of horses and of human 
 feet ; and from the deck of the Orphee, Polverel watched through 
 his glass the bustle on the wharves, and the putting off of more 
 than one boat, which prepared him to receive news. 
 
 The news came. The report was universal in the town that 
 Toussaint Breda had gone over from the allies to the side of 
 republican France ; and that this step had been followed by a 
 large defection from the allied forces. Messengers had arrived, 
 one after another, with dispatches which had been intercepted 
 by the mulattoes. These who brought them, however, had given 
 out that some posts had been surrendered, without a summons, 
 into the hands of the French. This was certainly the case with 
 Marmalade and Plaisance ; and others were confidently spoken of. 
 
 '' Offered to our hands just when our hands are tied, and we 
 cannot take them ! " said Polverel. " If our fresh regiments 
 would only arrive to-day, and help us to wrench the prison keys 
 from the hands of those devils of mulattoes, and let out Laveaux, 
 the colony would be ours before night." 
 
 As he spoke, he swept the horizon to the north and east 
 with his glass ; but no welcome sail was visible. 
 
 " Now look the other way," said the commander of the vessel ; 
 " if there is no help at sea, try if there be none on land. I have

 been watching that mountain-side for some time ; and, if I am 
 not much mistaken, there is an army of dusky fellows tiiere." 
 
 "Dusky ! mulattoes ! then we are lost ! " cried Polverel. "If 
 the mulattoes from the south have come up in any numbers " 
 
 " They are black as the night that is just gone," said the 
 commander, still keeping his eye fixed on the western heights 
 above the town. " See, the sun strikes them now. They are 
 blacks. The negroes under Toussaint himself, very probably. 
 I shall not have the pleasure of carrying you to Trance just yet, 
 M. Polverel." 
 
 Notwithstanding the display of black forces on the Haut-du- 
 Cap, the bustle of the town seemed to be in the opposite direction. 
 A few shots were fired in the south-east quarter, and some smoke 
 arose from thence. This was soon explained by the news that 
 Henri Christophe had approached the town from the plain, with 
 four or five thousand men, and was forcing an entrance that way. 
 There was little conflict. Toussaint poured down his force 
 through the barracks, where the French soldiers gave him a 
 hearty welcome, and along the avenues of Government House, 
 and the neighbouring public offices, in which quarter the mulat- 
 toes had little interest. Within an hour, the mulattoes had all 
 slunk back into their homes, telling their families that they could 
 have dealt with the French alone, but that they could not with- 
 stand an army of twenty thousand men (only doubling the real 
 number), which had dropped from the clouds, for aught they 
 knew. The few dead bodies were removed, the sand sucked 
 up their blood, and the morning wind blew dust over its traces. 
 A boat was sent ofE, in due form, to bring Commissary Polverel 
 home to Government House. Toussaint himself went to the 
 prison to bring out General Laveaux, with every demonstra- 
 tion of respect; and all presently wore the aspect of a jour-de-fSte. 
 
 Hour by hour tidings were spread which increased the joy of 
 the French, and the humiliation of their foes. The intercepted 
 dispatches were given up, and more arrived with the news of 
 the successive defection from the allies of all the important posts 
 in the colony, held by negro forces. In the name of Toussaint 
 Breda, the garrisons of Marmalade and Plaisance first declared 
 for republican France ; and after them, Gros-Mome, Henneri, 
 and Le Dondon. 
 
 The news of the acquisition of these last arrived in the evening, 
 when the French officials were entertaining the negro chief in 
 the salon of Government House, It was late : the house was 
 brilliantly lighted ; and its illuminations were reflected from a 
 multitude of faces without. Late as it was, and great as had 
 been the fatigues of the negro troops, they were not yet weaiy 
 of hearing the praises of their own Toussaint. Adding their 
 numbers to those of the white inhabitants of Cap, they thronged

 the court of Government House and the Jesuits' Walk ; and 
 even in the Place d' Archer and the Rue Espagnole, passengers 
 found it difficult to make their way. The assemblage could 
 scarcely have told what detained them there, unless it were the 
 vague expectation of more news, the repetition of the praises 
 they loved to hear, and, perhaps, some hope of getting one more 
 glimpse of Toussaint on this night of his triumph. From mouth 
 to mouth circulated the words which General Laveaux had 
 spoken in the morning, when released from his prison — ^" This 
 man is the saviour of the whites— the avenger of the authorities. 
 He is surely the black, the Spartacus predicted by Raynal, 
 whose destiny it should be to avenge the wrongs of his race." 
 From mouth to mouth went these words; and from heart to 
 heart spread the glow they kindled. 
 
 Toussaint himself had heard these words ; and in his heart 
 also were they glowing. As he sat at table, refreshing himself 
 with fruits, but (according to his invariable custom) refusing 
 wine, he was reminded by aU that passed that his career was not 
 ended. He wore the uniform of brigadier-general — a token that 
 he had not lost rank. M. Polverel had declared his intention of 
 soon returning to Prance ; and General Laveaux had said that 
 when he was thus left in charge of the colony, he should entreat 
 General Toussaint, who best understood its affairs, to fill the 
 office of lieutenant-governor, and should also be guided in 
 military affairs implicitly by his counsels. Toussaint heard, 
 and felt that, in truth, his career was not ended. He was re- 
 quested to name a day when he would take the oaths publicly, 
 and receive the homage of the grateful colony ; and in his reply 
 he took occasion to declare with earnestness that his present 
 course of action originated altogether in the decree of the Con- 
 vention in favour of the negroes ; and that the resources of his 
 power and influence should all be directed towards raising his 
 race to that intellectual and moral equality with the whites, 
 without which they could neither enjoy nor retain the political 
 equality which the Convention had decreed. In the midst of 
 the strongly expressed sympathy of his hosts, who were this day 
 disposed to approve and admire all he said and did — while they 
 were uttering hopes for his own people which touched his soul, 
 the final news of this great day was brought in, contained in 
 dispatches which told of the acquisition of the posts of Limb^ 
 and I'Acul — the two bars to the north-western peninsula of the 
 colony. The commanders declared their adhesion to the cause 
 of the blacks and Toussaint Breda. 
 
 " Bravo ! " cried the French general : " that obstinate region 
 is ours ! We will march through those posts to hold our fes- 
 tival, and the oaths shall be taken at Port Paix. Was not that 
 district considered the most obstinate general ? "

go THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 Toussaint did not answer. He did not hear. The mention of 
 Port Pais carried back his thoughts to the night when he was 
 last there, heavy at heart, assisting his master to escape. 
 
 " All is ours, now, through him," said M. Polverel, gazing at 
 his guest, 
 
 " Tes," rejoined Laveaux ; " he is the Napoleon Bonaparte of 
 St. Domingo. 
 
 " Who is he ? — who is Napoleon Bonaparte P " asked Toussaint, 
 roused to listen. '' I have heard his name. What has he done P " 
 
 " He is a young French artillery officer " 
 
 " A Corsican by birth," interposed Polverel. 
 
 "Is he really P I was not aware of that," said Laveaux. 
 " That circumstance somewhat increases the resemblance of the 
 cases. He was ill-used (or thought he was) by his officers, and 
 was on the point of joining the Turkish service, when he was 
 employed in the defence of the Convention, the other day. He 
 saved the Convention — he saved Paris — and he is about to 
 put off his uniform of brigadier-general " (and Laveaux smiled 
 and bowed as he spoke) — "like yourself, he is about to put 
 off his uniform of brigadier-general for that of a higher rank. 
 His name was known before in connection with the siege of 
 Toulon. But this last achievement is the grand one. He has 
 cleared the path of the Convention. Polverel, did I not say rightly 
 that General Toussaint is the Napoleon Bonaparte of St. 
 Domingo ? " 
 
 " Tes. General Toussaint also is making for us an opening 
 everywhere." 
 
 Toussaint heard the words, but they made a faint impression 
 at the moment of his imagination being fixed on the young 
 artillery officer. There were those present, however, who lost 
 nothing of what was spoken, and who conveyed it all to the 
 eager ears outside. The black attendants, the gazers and lis- 
 teners who went in and out, intoxicated with the glory of the 
 negro general, reported all that was said of him. These last few 
 words of Polverel wrought wonderfully, and were instantly 
 spread through the excited multitude. A shout was presently 
 heard, which must have sounded far up the moimtains and over 
 the bay ; and Polverel started with surprise when his word 
 came back to him in a response like that of an assembled nation. 
 " L'ouverture ! " " L'ouverture ! " cried the multitude, f uUy 
 comprehending what the word contained in its application to 
 their chief, " Toussaint L'Ouverture ! " Henceforth, the city, 
 the colony, the island, and, after a time, all Europe, rang with 
 the name of Toussaint L'Ouverture. 
 
 When Toussaint heard the cry from without, he started to his 
 feet; and his hosts rose also, on seeing the fire in his eye- 
 brighter than during the deeds of the morning.

 " The general woiild address them," said Polverel. " Tou 
 wish to speak to the people, G-eneral Toussaint." 
 
 " No," said Toussaint. 
 
 " What then ? " inquired Laveaux. 
 
 " I would be alone," said Toussaint, stepping backwards from 
 the table. 
 
 " Tour fatigues have doubtless been great,'' observed Laveaux. 
 "Lights shall be ordered in your apartment." 
 
 " I cannot sleep yet," said Toussaint. " I cannot sleep tiU I 
 have news from Breda. But I have need of thought, gentlemen ; 
 there is moonlight and quiet in these gardens. Permit me to 
 leave you now. 
 
 He paced the shrubberies, cool with moonlight and with dews ; 
 and his agitation subsided when all eyes but those of Heaven 
 were withdrawn. Here no flatteries met his ear — no gestures 
 of admiration made him drop his eyes, abashed. Constrained 
 as he yet felt himself in equal intercourse with whites, new to 
 his recognised freedom, unassured in his acts, uncertain of the 
 future, and (as he believed) unprepared for such a future as was 
 now unfolding, there was something inexpressibly irksome and 
 humbling in the homage of the whites — of men who understood 
 nothing of him, and little of his race, and who could have none 
 but political purposes in their intercourse with him. He 
 needed this evening the sincerities as well as the soothings of 
 nature ; and it was with a sense of relief that he cast himself 
 once again upon her bosom, to be instructed, with infantine 
 belief, how small an atom he was in the universe of God — how low 
 a rank he held in the hierarchy of the ministers of the Highest. 
 
 " Tet I am one," thought he, as the shout of his name and 
 new title reached his ear, distinct, though softened by distance. 
 " I am an appointed minister. It seems as if I were the one of 
 whom I myself have spoken as likely to arise — not, as Laveaux 
 says, after E/aynal, to avenge, but to repair the wrongs of my 
 colour. Low, indeed, are we sunk, deep is our ignorance, abject 
 are our wills, if such a one as I am to be the leader of thousands 
 — I, whose will is yet unexercised — I, who shrink ashamed before 
 the knowledge of the meanest white — I, so lately a slave — so 
 long dependent that I am an oppression to myself — am at this 
 hour the ruler over ten thousand wills ! The ways of God are 
 dark, or it might seem that He despised His negro children in 
 committing so many of them to so poor a guide. But He despises 
 nothing that He has made. It may be that we are too weak and 
 ignorant to be fit for better guidance in our new state of rights 
 and duties. It may be that a series of teachers is appointed to 
 my colour, of whom I am to be the first, only because I am the 
 lowest ; destined to give way to wiser guides when I have taught 
 all that I know, and done all that I can. May it be so ! I will

 devote myself wholly; and when I have done may I be more 
 willing to hide myself in my cottage, or lie down in my grave, 
 than 1 have been this day to accept the new lot which I dare not 
 refuse ! — Deal gently with me, O God ! and, however I fail, let 
 me not see my children's hearts hardened, as hearts are hardened, 
 by power ! Let me not see in their faces the look of authority, 
 nor hear in their voices the tones of pride ! Be with my people, 
 O Christ ! The weaker I am, the moi-e be Thou with them, that 
 Thy gospel may be at last received ! The hearts of my people 
 are soft — they are gentle, they are weak : — let Thy gospel make 
 them pure — let it make them free. Thy gospel — who has not 
 heard of it, and who has seen it ? May it be found in the 
 hearts of my people, the despised! and who shall then despise 
 them again ? The past is all guilt and groans. Into the future 
 open a better way '' 
 
 " Toussaint L'Ouverture ! " he heard again from afar, and 
 bowed his head, overpowered with hope. 
 
 " Toussaint L'Ouverture ! " repeated some light gay voices 
 close at hand. His boys were come, choosing to bring themselves 
 the news from Breda — that Margot and her daughters, and old 
 Dessalines and Moyse were all there, safe and happy, except for 
 their dismay at finding the cottage and field in such a state of 
 desolation. 
 
 " They wiU not mind when they hear that they are to live in 
 a mansion henceforward," said Placide. " Jean Francjais had 
 better have stood by his colour, as we do." 
 
 " And how have you stood by your colour, my young hero ? " 
 
 " I told Jean in the camp to-day " 
 
 " Jean ! In the camp ! How came you there ? " 
 
 " We were so near, that I galloped in to see what they thought 
 of your leaving, and who had followed yon." 
 
 " Then I thank God that you are here." 
 
 " Jean caught me ; but the General bade him let me go, and 
 asked whether the blacks made war upon children. I told him 
 that I was not a child ; and I told Jean that you had rather live 
 in a cave for the sake of the -blacks, than go ofE to the court of 
 Spain " 
 
 " "What made yon fancy I should go there ? " 
 
 " Not you, but Jean. Jean is going, he says, because he is a 
 noble. There will soon be peace between France and Spain, he 
 says ; and then he shall be a noble at the court of Spain. I am 
 glad he is going." 
 
 " So am I, if he thinks he shall be happy there." 
 
 " We shall be better without him," said Isaac. " He would 
 never be quiet while you were made Lieutenant-Governor of St. 
 Domingo. Now you will be alone and unmolested in your power." 
 
 "Where did you learn all this ? "

 " Every one knows it — every one in Cap. Every one knows 
 that Jean has done with us, and that the Commissary is going 
 home, and that General Laveaux means to be guided iu every- 
 thing by you ; and that the posts have all surrendered in your 
 name ; and that at Port Paix " 
 
 " Enough, enough ! my boys. Too much, for I see that your 
 hearts are protid." 
 
 " The Commissary and the General said that you are supreme 
 — the idol of your colour. Those were their words." 
 
 "And in this there is yet no glory. I have yet done nothing, 
 but by what is called accident. Our own people were ready— by 
 no preparation of mine ; the mulattoes were weak and taken by 
 surprise, through circumstances not ef my ordering. Glory 
 there may hereafter be belonging to our name, my boys ; but as 
 yet there is none. I have power : but power is less often glory 
 than disgrace." 
 
 " Oh, father ! do but listen. Hark again ! ' Toussaint L'Ou- 
 verture ! ' " 
 
 " I will strive to make that shout a prophecy, my sons. Till 
 then, no pride ! Are you not weary ? Come in to rest. Can 
 yon sleep in my fine chamber here as well as at Breda ? " 
 
 " Anywhere," said Isaac, sleepily. 
 
 Toussaint gave up his apartment to his sons, and went forth 
 once more to survey the town, and see that his troops were in 
 their quarters. This done, he repaired to his friend Henri, 
 willing for one more night to forego his greatness ; and there, 
 in his friend's small barrack-room, the supreme in the colony — 
 the idol of his colour— slept, as he had hoped for his boys, as 
 tranquilly as if he had been at Breda. 
 
 CHAPTER X. 
 
 A MOKNING OF OFFICE. 
 
 If the devastation attending the revolutionary wars of St. 
 Domingo was great, it was repaired with singular rapidity. 
 Thanks to the vigorous agencies of nature in a tropical region, 
 the desolated plains were presently covered with fresh harvests, 
 and the burnt woods were buried deep under the shadow of 
 young forests, more beautiful than the old. Thanks also to the 
 government of the wisest mind in the island, the moral evils of 
 the struggle were made subordinate to its good results. It was 
 not in the power of man to bury past injuries in oblivion, while 
 there were continually present minds which had been debased

94 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 by tyranny, and hearts which had been outraged by cruelty; 
 but all that conld be done was done. Vigorous employment was 
 made the great law of society — the one condition of the favour 
 of its chief ; and, amidst the labours of the hoe and the mill, the 
 workshop and the wharf — amidst the toils of the march and the 
 bustle of the court, the bereaved and insulted forgot their woes 
 and their revenge. A new growth of veneration and o£ hope 
 overspread the ruins of old delights and attachments, as the 
 verdure of the plain spread its mantle over the wrecks of man- 
 sion and of hut. In seven years from the kindling of the first 
 incendiary torch on the Plaine du Nord, it would have been hard 
 for a stranger, landing in St. Domingo, to believe what had been 
 the horrors of the war. 
 
 Of these seven years, however, the first three or four had been 
 entirely spent in war, and the rest disturbed by it. Double that 
 number of years must pass before there could be any security 
 that the crop planted would ever be reaped, or that the peasants 
 who laid out their family burying-grounds would be carried 
 there in full age, instead of perishing in the field or in the 
 woods. The cultivators went out to their daily work with the 
 gun slung across their shoulders and the cutlass in their belt : 
 the hiUs were crested with forts, and the mountain passes were 
 watched by scouts. The troops were frequently reviewed in 
 the squares of the towns, and news was perpetually arriving of 
 a skirmish here or there. The mulatto general, Rigaud, had 
 never acknowledged the authority of Toussaint L'Ouverture; 
 and he was stiU in the field, with a mulatto force sufficient to 
 interrupt the prosperity of the colony, and endanger the autho- 
 rity of its Lieutenant- Governoi-. It was some time, however, 
 since Eigaud had approached any of the large towns. The 
 sufferers by his incursions were the planters and field-labourers. 
 The inhabitants of the towns carried on their daily affairs as if 
 peace had been fully established in the island, and feeling the 
 effects of such warfare as there was only iu their occasional 
 contributions of time and money. 
 
 The Commander-in-chief, as Toussaint L'Ouverture was 
 called, by the appointment of the Trench commissaries, though 
 his dignity had not yet been confirmed from Paris — the Com- 
 mander-in-chief of St. Domingo held his head-quarters at Port- 
 au-Prince. Among other considerations which rendered this 
 convenient, the chief was that he thus avoided much collision 
 with the French officials, which must otherwise have taken 
 place. AU the commissaries, who rapidly succeeded one another 
 from Paris, resided at Grovemment House, in Cap Pran9ais. 
 Thence they issued orders and regulations in the name of the 
 government at home ; orders and regulations which were some- 
 times practicable, sometimes unwise, and often absurd. If

IN OFFICE. 95 
 
 Tonssaint had resided at Cap, a constant witness of their igno- 
 rance of the minds, manners, and interests of the blacks — ^if he 
 had been there to listen to the complaints and appeals which 
 would have been daily made, he could scarcely have kept terms 
 for a single week with the French authorities. By establishing 
 himself in the south, while they remained in the north, he was 
 able quietly to neutralise or repair much of the mischief which 
 they did, and to execute many of his own plans without con- 
 sulting them ; while many a grievance was silently borne, many 
 an order simply neglected, which would have been a cause of 
 quarrel, if any power of redress had been at hand. Jealous as 
 he was for the infant freedom of his race, Toussaint knew that 
 it would be best preserved by weaning their minds from thoughts 
 of anger, and their eyes from the sight of blood. Trust in the 
 better part of negro nature guided him in his choice between 
 two evUs. He preferred that they should be misgoverned in 
 some affairs of secondary importance, and keep the peace, rather 
 than that they should be governed to their hearts' content by 
 himself, at the risk of quarrel with the mother country. He 
 trusted to the singular power of forbearance and forgiveness 
 which is found in the negro race for the preservation of friend- 
 ship with the whites and of the blessings of peace; and he 
 therefore reserved his own powerful influence over both parties 
 for great occasions — interfering only when he perceived that, 
 through carelessness or ignorance, the French authorities were 
 endangering some essential liberty of those to whom they were 
 the medium of the pleasure of the government at home. The 
 blacks were aware that the vigilance of their Commander-in- 
 chief over their civil rights never slept, and that his inter- 
 ference always availed; and these convictions ensured their 
 submission, or at least their not going beyond passive resistance 
 on ordinary occasions, and thus strengthened their habits of 
 peace. 
 
 The Commander-in-chief held his levees at Port-au-Prince on 
 certain days of the month, all the year round. No matter how 
 far off he might be, or how engaged, the night before, he rarely 
 failed to be at home on the appointed day, at the fixed hour. 
 On one particular occasion, he was known to have been out 
 against Rigaud, day and night, for a fortnight, and to be closely 
 engaged as far south as Aux Oayes, the very evening preceding 
 the review and levee which had been announced for the 20th of 
 January. Not the less for this did he appear in front of the 
 troops in the Place Republicaine, when the daylight gushed in 
 from the east, putting out the stars, whose reflection trembled 
 in the still waters of the bay. The last evolutions were finished, 
 and the smoke from the last volley had melted away in the 
 serene sky of January, before the coolness of the northern breeze

 had yielded to tlie blaze of the mounting sun. The troops then 
 lined the long streets of the town, and the avenue to the palace, 
 while the Commander-in-chief and his staff passed on, and 
 entered the palace-gates. 
 
 The palace, like every other building in Port-au-Prince, con- 
 sisted of one storey only. The town had been destroyed by an 
 earthquake in 1770; and, though earthquakes are extremely 
 rare in St. Domingo, the place had been rebuilt in view of the 
 danger of another. The palace therefore covered a large piece 
 of ground, and its principal rooms were each nearly surrounded 
 by garden and grass-plat. The largest apartment, in which the 
 levees were always held, was the best room in the island — if 
 not for the richness of its furniture, for its space and propor- 
 tions, and the views which it commanded. Not even the abode 
 of the Commander-in-chief could exhibit such silken sofas, 
 marble tables, gilded balustrades, and japanned or ivory screens, 
 as had been common in the mansions of the planters ; and Tous- 
 saint had found other uses for such money as he had than those 
 of pure luxury. The essential and natural advantages of his 
 palace were enough for him and his. The floor of this, his 
 favourite apartment, was covered with a fine India matting; 
 the windows were hung with white muslin curtains; and the 
 sofas, which stood round three sides of the room, between the 
 numerous windows, were covered with green damask, of no very 
 rich quality. In these many windows lay the charm, com- 
 manding, as they did, extensive prospects to the east, north, 
 and west. The broad verandah cast a shadow which rendered 
 it unnecessary to keep the jalousies closed, except during the 
 hottest hours of the year. This morning every blind was swung 
 wide open, and the room was cool and shady, whUe, without, 
 all was bathed in the mUd, golden sunshine of January — bright 
 enough for the strongest eye, but without glare. 
 
 To the east and north spread the Cul-de-Sac — a plain of un- 
 equalled richness, extending to the foot of the mountains, fifteen 
 miles into the interior. The sun had not yet risen so high but 
 that these mountains cast a deep shadow for some distance into 
 the plain, while their skirts were dark with coflee-groves, and 
 their summits were strongly marked against the glowing sky. 
 Amidst the wide, verdant level of the plain, arose many a white 
 mansion, each marked by a cluster of trees, close at hand. Some 
 of these plantation houses looked bluish and cool in the mountain 
 shadows; others were like bright specks in the sunshine, each 
 surmounted by a star, if its gilded weathercock chanced to turn 
 in the breeze. To the north, also, this plain, still backed by 
 mountains, extended till it joined the sands of th« bight. 
 
 Upon these sands, on the margin of the deep blue waters, 
 might be seen flashing in the sun a troop of flamingops, now

 moving forward in a line into the waves, and diligently fishing ; 
 and then, on <he alarm of a scout, all taking wing successively, 
 and keeping their order, as they flew homewards, to the salt 
 marshes in the interior — their scarlet bodies vividly contrasted 
 with the dark green of the forests that clothed the mountain 
 sides. To the west lay the broad azure sheet of the bay, looked 
 by the island of Gonave, and sprinkled with fishing-boats, whUe 
 under the forest-tufted rooks of the island two vessels rode at 
 anchor — a schooner belonging to St. Domingo, and an English 
 frigate. 
 
 In the shady western piazza sat a party who seemed much 
 occupied in looking out upon the bay, and watching the vessels 
 that lay under the island ; from which vessels boats might be 
 seen putting off for the town just at the time of the commence- 
 ment of the levde. The party in the piazza consisted chiefly of 
 women. Madame L'Ouverture was there — like, and yet unlike, 
 the Margot of former years — employed, as usual — busy with 
 her needle, and motherly, complacent, tenderly vigilant as of 
 old; but with a matronly grace and dignity which evidently 
 arose from a gratified mind, and not fi"om external state. Her 
 daughters were beside her, both wonderfully improved in beauty, 
 though Genifrede still preserved the superiority there. She sat 
 a little apart from her mother and sister netting. Moyse was 
 at her feet, in order to obtain the benefit of an occasional gleam 
 from the eyes wliich were cast down upon her work. His ido- 
 latry of her was no surprise to any who looked upon her in her 
 beauty, now animated and exalted by the love which she had 
 avowed, and which was sanctioned by her father and her family. 
 The sisters were dressed nearly alike, though Aimee knew well 
 that it would have been politic to have avoided thus bringing 
 herself into immediate comparison with her sister. But Ainiee 
 cared not what was thought of her face, form, or dress. Isaac 
 had always been satisfied with them. She had confided in 
 Genifr^de's taste when they first assumed their rank ; and it 
 was least troublesome to do so still. If Isaac should wish it 
 otherwise when he should return from France, she would do as 
 he desired. Meantime, they were dressed in all essentials 
 exactly alike, from the pattern of the Madras handkerchief they 
 wore (according to universal custom) on their heads, to the cut 
 of the French-kid shoe. The dress was far from resembling the 
 European fashion of the time. No tight laeing ; no casing in 
 whalebone — nothing like a hoop. A chemisette of the finest 
 cambric appeared within the bodice, and covered the bosom. 
 The short fuU sleeves were also of white cambric. The bodice, 
 and short full skirt, were of deep yellow India silk; and the 
 waist was confined with a broad band of violet-coloured velvet, 
 gaily embroidered. The only difference in the dress of the

 sisters was in their ornaments. Aimee wore heavy ear-drops, 
 and a large necklace and bracelets of amethyst; while Geni- 
 frede wore, suspended from a throat-band of velvet, embroidered 
 like that which bound her waist, a massive plain gold crucifix, 
 lately given her by Moyse. Her ear-rings were hoops of plain 
 gold, and her bracelets again of embroidered velvet, clasped 
 with plain gold. In her might be seen, and in her was seen by 
 the Europeans who attended the levee of that day, what the 
 negro face and form may be when seen in their native climate, 
 unhardened by degradation, undebased by ignorance, unspoiled 
 by oppression — all peculiarities of feature softened under the 
 refining influence of mind, and all peculiarities of expression 
 called out in their beauty by the free exercise of natural affec- 
 tions. The animated sweetness of the negro countenance is 
 known only to those who have seen it thus. 
 
 Paul was of the party, looking very well in the French 
 uniform, which he wore in honour of his brother on great occa- 
 sions, though he was far from having grown warlike on his 
 change of fortune. His heart was still in his cottage, or on the 
 sea ; and now, as he stood leaning against a pillar of the piazza, 
 his eye was more busy in watching the fishing-boats in the bay 
 than in observing what went on within the house. The only 
 thing he liked about state-days was the hours of idleness they 
 afforded — such hours as this, when, lounging in the shade, he 
 could see Moyse happy at the feet of his beloved, and enjoy the 
 soft wind as it breathed past, laden with spicy scents. During 
 such an hour, he almost forgot the restraints of his uniform and 
 of his rank. 
 
 There was yet another person in the piazza. Seated on its 
 step, but sheltered by its broad eaves, sat Th^rese — more beau- 
 tiful by far than G^nifrede — more beautiful by far than in her 
 days of girlhood — celebrated as she had then been throughout 
 the colony. Her girlishness was gone, except its grace; her 
 sensitiveness was gone, and (as those might think who did not 
 watch the changes of her eye) much of her animation. Her 
 carriage was majestic, her countenance calm, and its beauty, 
 now refined by a life of leisure and the consciousness of rank — 
 leisure and rank both well employed— more imposing than ever. 
 Her husband was now a general in Toussaint's army. When he 
 was in the field, Madame DessaUnes remained at home, on their 
 estate near St. Marc. When he was in attendance on the Com- 
 mander-in-chief, she was ever a welcome guest iu Toussaint's 
 family. Madame L'Ouverture loved her as a daughter ; and she 
 had endeared herself to the girls. At this time, from an acci- 
 dental circumstance, she was at the palace without her husband. 
 It was evident that she felt quite at home there ; for, though 
 she had arrived only a few hours before, she did not appear

RECEIVING DEPUTATIONS. 99 
 
 disposed to conrerse. As she sat alone, leaning against the base 
 of the pillar, she now and then cast her eyes on the book she held 
 open in her hand, but for the most part looked abroad upon the 
 terraced town, the bay, or the shadowy clefts of the roeky island 
 which closed it in. 
 
 The sound of feet and of voices from within increased from 
 moment to moment. The Commander-in-chief had assumed his 
 place, with his aides on either hand ; and presently the room 
 was so nearly filled as to leave no more space than was required 
 for the deputations to pass in at one entrance on the south of the 
 apartment, appear before the General, and pass out at the 
 other door. Toussaint stood at the centre of the north end, 
 beside a table partly covered .with papers, and at which sat his 
 secretary. On this table lay his cocked hat. His uniform was 
 blue, with scarlet cape and cuffs, richly embroidered. He had 
 white trousers, long Hessian boots, and, as usual, the Madras 
 handkerchief on his head. While walking up the apartment, he 
 had been conversing on business with his oflBcers, and continued 
 to do so, without tlie loss of a moment, tiU, on his taking his 
 place, two ushers came up with an account of the parties waiting 
 for admittance, desiring to know his pleasure as to who should 
 have precedence. 
 
 " The clergy," said Toussaint ; " the first in duty must be first 
 in honour." 
 
 In a few moments there was a loud announcement of the 
 clergy from the districts of St. Marc, Leogane, Mirbalais, and so 
 on, through a long enumeration of districts. The priests entered, 
 two and two, a long procession of black gowns. As they collected 
 into a group before him, every one anxiously making way for 
 them, Toussaint crossed his arms upon his breast, and bowed his 
 head low for many moments. When he looked up again, an 
 expression of true reverence was upon his countenance ; and, in 
 a tone of earnestness, he asked for what service they desired to 
 command him. 
 
 Father Antioche, an old priest, assisted by a brother at least 
 thirty years younger, offered sealed papers, which, he said, con- 
 tained reports from the several districts concerning the religious 
 and moral condition of the inhabitants. Toussaint received 
 them, and laid them, with his own hand, upon the table beside 
 him, saying, with much solicitude — 
 
 " Do I see rightly in your countenances that you bring good 
 news of your flocks, my fathers ? " 
 
 " It is so," replied the old priest. " Our wishes are fast ful- 
 filling." 
 
 "Eight thousand marriages have been celebrated, as will 
 appear in our reports," added the young priest. 
 
 " And in the difficult cases of a plurality of wives," resumed 
 o 2

 Father Antioche, " there is generally a willingness in the culti- 
 vators to maintain liberally those who are put away." 
 
 "And the children P" 
 
 " The children may be found in the schools, sitting side by 
 side in peace. The quarrels of the children of different mothers 
 (quarrels often fatal in the fields) disappear in the schools. The 
 reports well exhibit the history of our expanding system." 
 
 " God be thanked ! " Toussaint uttered in a low voice. 
 
 "Under the religions rule of your excellency," said the young 
 priest, "enforced by so pure an example of piety, the morals of 
 this colony will be established, and the salvation of its people 
 secured." 
 
 " Ton," said Toussaint, " the servants of Christ, are the true 
 rulers of this island and its inhabitants. I am your servant in 
 guarding external order, during a period which you will employ 
 in establishing your flocks in the everlasting wisdom and peace 
 of religion. I hold the inferior office of keeping our enemies in 
 awe, and enabling our people to find subsistence and comfort. 
 My charge is the soil on which, and the bodies in which, men 
 live. Ton have in charge their souls, in which lies the future 
 of this world and of the next. Ton are the true rulers of St. 
 Domingo ; and we bow to you as such." 
 
 Every head was immediately bowed, and the priests went out, 
 amidst the obeisances of the whole assemblage — some of the 
 order wondering, perhaps, whether every mind there was as 
 sincere in its homage as that of the Commander-in-chief. 
 
 The superintendents of the cultivators came next — ^negroes 
 dressed in check shirts, white linen jackets and trousers, and 
 with the usual Madras handkerchief on the head. They, too, 
 handed in reports ; and to them also did Toussaint address his 
 questions, with an air of respect almost equal to that with which 
 he had spoken to the priests. 
 
 " I grieve," said he, " that you cannot yet fulfil your function 
 altogether in peace. My generals and I have done what we can 
 to preserve our fields from devastation, and our cultivators from 
 the dangers and the fears of ambushed foes ; but Bigaud's forces 
 are not yet subdued ; and for a while we must impose upon our 
 cultivators the toil of working armed in the field. We are 
 soldiers here," he added, looking round upon his officers, " but I 
 hope there is not one of us who does not honour the hoe more 
 than the gun. How far have you been able to repair in the 
 south-eastern districts the interruption in the September plant- 
 ing ? " 
 
 The superintendent of those districts came forward, and said 
 that some planting had been efPected in November, the sprouts 
 of which now looked well. More planting had been done during the 
 early part of the present month ; and time would show the result.

 " Good ! " said Tonssaint. " Some of the finest crops I have 
 seen have risen from January plants, though it were best it 
 were done in September. How do you repoi-t about the rats ? " 
 
 " The nuisance is still great," replied the head superintendent ; 
 " their uninterrupted possession of the fields during the troubles 
 has made them very powerful. Would that your excellency 
 were as powerful to conquer the rats as the mulattoes ! " 
 
 " We have allies," said Toussaint, gravely — " an army more 
 powerful than that which I command. Where are the ants ! " 
 
 " They have closed their campaign. They cleared the fields 
 for us in the autumn ; but they have disappeared." 
 
 " For a time only. While there are rats, they wiU reappear." 
 
 " And when there are no more rats, we must call iu some force, 
 if your excellency knows of such, to make war upon the ants ; 
 for they are only a less evil than that which they cure." 
 
 " If they were absent, you would find some worse evil in their 
 stead — pestilence, perhaps. Teach your children this, if you 
 hear them complain of anything to which Providence has given 
 life and an errand among us. The cocoa walks at Plaisance — 
 are they fenced to the north p " 
 
 " Completely. The new wood has sprung up from the ashes 
 of the fires, like a mist from the lake." 
 
 "Are the cottages enlarged and divided, as I recommended?" 
 
 " Universally. Every cottage inhabited by a family has now 
 two rooms, at least. As your excellency also desired, the culti- 
 vators have spent their leisure hours in preparing furniture — 
 from bedsteads to baskets. As the reports will explain, there are 
 some inventions which it is hoped will be inspected by your 
 excellency — particularly a ventilator, to be fixed iu the roofs 
 of cottages ; a broad shoe for walking over the salt marshes ; 
 and " 
 
 " The cooler," prompted a voice from behind. 
 
 " And a new kind of cooler, which preserves liquids, and even 
 meats, for a longer time than any previously known to the richest 
 planter in the island. This discovery does great credit to the 
 sagacity of the labourer who has completed it." 
 
 " I will come and view it. I hope to visit all our cultivators 
 — ^to verify your reports with my own eyes. At present, we are 
 compelled, like the Romans, to go from arms to the plough, and 
 from the plough to arms ; but, when possible, I wish to show 
 that I am not a negro of the coast, with my eye ever abroad upon 
 the sea, or on foreign lands. I desire that we should make use 
 of our own means for our own welfare. Everything that is good 
 shall be welcomed from abi-oad as it arrives ; but the liberty of 
 the blacks can be secured only by the prosperity of their agri- 
 culture." 
 
 " I do not see why not by fisheries," observed Paul, to the

 party in tlie piazza, as he caugM his brother's words. " If Tons- 
 saint is not fond of fish, he should remember that other people 
 are." 
 
 " He means," said Therese, " that toil, peaceful toil, with its 
 hope, and its due fruit, is best for the blacks. Now, you know, 
 Paul L'Ouverture, that if the fields of the ocean had required as 
 much labour as those of the plain, you would never have been 
 a fisherman." 
 
 " It is pleasanter on a hot day to dive than to dig ; and easier 
 to draw the net for an hour than to cut canes for a day — is it 
 not, uncle p " asked Aimee. 
 
 " If the Oommander-in-chief thinks toil good for us," said 
 Moyse, " why does he disparage war ? Who knows better than 
 he what are the fatigues of a march ^ and the wearisomeness 
 of an ambush is greater stiR. Why does he, of aU men, dis- 
 parage war ? " 
 
 " Because," said Madame, "he thinks there has been enough 
 hatred and fighting. I have to put him in mind of his own 
 glory in war, or he would be always forgetting it — except, in- 
 deed, when any one comes from Europe. When he hears of 
 Bonaparte, he smiles ; and I know he is then glad that he is a 
 soldier too." 
 
 " Besides his thinking that there has been too much fight- 
 ing,'' said Aimee, "he wishes that the people should labour 
 joyfully in the very places where they used to toil in wretched- 
 ness for the whites." 
 
 Therese turned to listen, with fire in her eyes. 
 
 " In order," continued Aimee, " that they may lose the sense 
 of that misery, and become friendly towards the whites." 
 
 Therese turned away again, languidly. 
 
 "There are whites now entering," said Paul; "not foreigners, 
 are they ? " 
 
 "No," said Madame. " Surely they are Creoles ; yes, there 
 is M. Gaze, and M. Hugonin, and M. Charrier. I think these 
 gentlemen have all been reinstated in their properties since the 
 last levee. Hear what they say." 
 
 " We come," exclaimed aloud M. Gaze, the spokesman of the 
 party of white planters ; " we come, overwhelmed with amaze- 
 ment, penetrated with gratitude, to lay our thanks at your feet. 
 AU was lost. The estates on which we were born, the lands 
 bequeathed to us by our fathers, were wi-enched from our hands, 
 ravaged, destroyed. We and our families fled— some to the 
 mountains — some to the woods — and many to foreign lands. 
 Tour voice reached us, inviting us to our homes. We trusted 
 that voice ; we find our lands restored to us, our homes secure, 
 and the passions of war stilled, like this atmosphere after the 
 storms of December. And to you do we owe aU— to yon.

 possessed by a magnanimity of which we had not dared to 
 dream ! " 
 
 " These passions of war, of which you speak," said Toussaint, 
 " need never have raged, if God had permitted the whites to 
 dream what was in the souls of the blacks. Let the past now 
 be forgotten. I have restored your estates because they were 
 yours ; but I also perceive advantages in your restoration. By 
 circumstances — not by nature, but by circumstances — the whites 
 have been able to acquire a wide intelligence, a depth of know- 
 ledge, from which the blacks have been debarred. I desire for 
 the blacks a perpetual and friendly intercourse with those who 
 are their superiors in education. As residents, therefore, you 
 are welcome ; and your security and welfare shall be my care. 
 You find your estates peopled with cultivators P " 
 
 "We do." 
 
 " And you understand the terms on which the labour of your 
 fellow-citizens may be hired ? Tou have only to secure to them 
 one-fourth of the produce, and you will, I believe, be well served. 
 If yon experience cause of complaint, your remedy will be found 
 in an appeal to the superintendent of cultivators of the district, 
 or to myself. Over the cultivators no one else, I now intimate 
 to you, has authority." 
 
 The gentlemen bowed, having nothing to say on this head. 
 
 " It may be in your power," continued Toussaint, after apply- 
 ing to his secretary for a paper from the mass on the table — 
 " it may be in your power to do a service to the colony, and to 
 individuals mentioned in this paper, by affording information as 
 to where they are to be found, if alive ; which of them are dead ; 
 and which of the dead have left heirs. Many estates remain 
 unclaimed. The list is about to be circulated in the colony, in 
 France, and in the United States. If you should chance to be 
 in correspondence with any of the owners or their heirs, make 
 it known to them from me that they will be welcome here, as 
 yon are. In the mean time we are taking the best care in our 
 power of their estates. They must rebuild such of their houses 
 as have been destroyed ; but their lands are cultivated under a 
 commission, a part of the produce being assigned to the cultiva- 
 tors, the rest to the public treasury." 
 
 Toussaint read the list, watching, as did every one present, 
 the countenances of the Creoles as each name was pronounced. 
 They had information to offer respecting one or two only ; to the 
 rest they gave sighs or mournful shakes of the head. 
 
 " It is afflicting to us all," said Toussaint, "to think of the 
 slaughter and exile of those who drank wine together in the 
 white mansions of yonder plain. But a wiser cheerfulness is 
 henceforth to spread its sunshine over our land, with no tempest 
 brewing in its heats."

104 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " Have we heard the whole list ? " asked M. Charrier, 
 auxiouslj. 
 
 ''All except three, whose owners or agents have been already 
 summoned. These three are, the Athens estate, M. Dank ; the 
 Breda estate, the attorney of which, M. Bayou " 
 
 " Is here ! " cried a Toice from the lower part of the room. 
 " I landed just now," exclaimed Bayou, hastening with extended 
 arms to embrace Toussaint ; " and I lose not a moment " 
 
 " Gently, sir," said the Commander-in-chief, drawing back 
 two steps. " There is now a greater distance between me and 
 you than there once was between you and me. There can be no 
 familiarity with the chief of a newly-redeemed race." 
 
 M. Bayou fell back, looking in every face around him, to see 
 what was thought of this. Every face was grave. 
 
 ''I sent for you," resumed Toussaint, in a mild voice, ''to 
 put you at the head of the interests of the good old masters ; — 
 for the good alone have been able to return. Show us what can 
 be done with the Breda estate, with free labourers. Make the 
 blacks work well. Be not only just, but firm. Ton were for- 
 merly too mild a master. Make the blacks work well, that, by 
 the welfare of your small interests, you may add to the general 
 prosperity of the administration of the Commander-in-chief of 
 St. Domingo." 
 
 M. Bayou had no words ready. He stared round him upon 
 the black officers iu their splendid uniforms, upon the trains of 
 liveried servants, handing coffee and fruits and sangaree on 
 trays and salvers of massive silver, and on the. throng of visitors 
 who crowded upon one another's heels, all anxious, not merely 
 to pay their respects, but to offer their enthusiastic homage at 
 the feet of his former slave. His eye at length fixed upon the 
 windows, through which he saw something of the outline of the 
 group of ladies. 
 
 " Ton desire to greet Madame L'Ouverture P " said Toussaint, 
 kindly. "Tou shall be conducted to her." And one of the 
 aides stepped forward to perform the office of introducer. 
 
 M. Bayou pulled from his pocket, on his way to the window, 
 a shagreen jewel-case ; and, by the time he was in front of 
 Madame he had taken from it a rich gold chain, which he hung 
 on her neck, saying, with a voice and air strangely made up of 
 jocoseness, awkwardness, and deference — 
 
 " I have not forgotten, you see, though I suppose you have, 
 what you gave me, one day long ago. I tried to bring back 
 something prettier than 1 carried away — something for each of 
 you — but—I don't know — I find everything here so different 
 from what I had any idea of —so very strange — ^that I am afraid 
 you win despise my little presents." 
 
 While speaking, he shyly held out little parcels to G^nifrede

M. bayou's surpkisb. ios 
 
 and Aim^e, who received them graciously, while their mother 
 replied — 
 
 " In those old days, M. Bayou, we had nothing really our own 
 to give; and yon deserved from us any aid that was in our 
 power. My daughters and I now accept with pleasure the tokens 
 of friendship that you bring. I hope no changes have taken 
 place which need prevent our being friends, M. Bayou." 
 
 He scarcely heard her. 
 
 "Is it possible," cried he, "that these can be your girls P 
 Aimee I might have known — but can this lady be Genifrode H " 
 
 Genifrede looked up with a smile, which perplexed him still 
 further. 
 
 " I do not know that I ever saw a smile from her before ; and 
 she would not so much as lift up her head at one of my jokes. One 
 could never gain her attention with anything but a ghost story. 
 But I see how it is," he added, stooping, and speaking low to her 
 mother, while he glanced at Moyse — " she has learned at last the old 
 song that she womd not listen to when I wanted to tell her fortune : — 
 
 ' Your heart's your own this summer day ; 
 To-morrow 'twill be changed away.' 
 
 And Aimee — is she married ? " 
 
 " Aimee is a widow — at least, so we call her,'' said her 
 mother, smiling. " Isaac (you remember Placide and Isaac) — 
 her brother Isaac is aU the world to her ; and he is far away." 
 
 Aimee's eyes were full of tears in a moment ; but she looked 
 happy, as she always did when Isaac was spoken of as her own 
 peculiar friend. 
 
 " I was going to ask about your boys," said Bayou. " The 
 little fellow who used to ride the horses to water, almost before 
 he could walk aloue — he and his brothers, where are they P " 
 
 "Denis is with his tutor, in the palace here. Placide and 
 Isaac are at Paris." 
 
 " At Paris ! For education ? " 
 
 " Partly so." 
 
 " And partly," interposed Paul, " for an object in which you, 
 sir, have an interest, and respecting which you ought, therefore, 
 to be informed. There are those who represent my brother's 
 actions as the result of personal ambition. Such pei'sons have 
 perpetually accused him to the French Government as desiring 
 to sever the connection between the two races, and therefore 
 between this colony and France. At the moment when these 
 charges were most strongly urged, and most nearly believed, my 
 brother sent his two elder sons to Paris, to be educated for their 
 future duties under the care of the Directory. I hope, sir, you 
 see in this act a guarantee for the safety and honour of the whites 
 in St. Domingo."

 " Certainly, certainly. AH very right — very satisfactory." 
 
 " Everybody who understands, thinks all that the Commander- 
 in-chief does quite right," said Madame, with so much of her old 
 tone and manner as made Bayou ready to laugh. He turned to 
 Paul, saying — 
 
 " May I ask if yon are the brother who used to reside on the 
 northern coast — if I remember right ? " 
 
 " 1 am. I am Paul — Paul L'Ouverture." He sighed as he 
 added, "I do not live on the northern coast now. I am going 
 to live on the southern coast — in a palace, instead of my old 
 hut." 
 
 "M. Bayou will see — M. Bayou will hear,'' interrupted 
 Madame, " if he will stay out the levee. Ton will not leave us 
 to-day, M. Bayou ? " 
 
 M. Bayou bowed. He then asked if he had the pleasure of 
 any acquaintance with the other lady, who had not once turned 
 round since he arrived. Therese had indeed sat with her face 
 concealed for some time past. 
 
 " Do not ask her," said Aimee, eagerly, in a low voice. " We 
 do not speak to her of old times. She is Madame Dessalines." 
 
 " The lady of General Dessalines," said Madame. " Shall I 
 introduce you P " 
 
 She called to Therese. Therese just turned round to notice 
 the introduction, when her attention was called another way by 
 two officers, who brought her some message from Toussaint. 
 That one glance perplexed M. Bayou as much as anything he 
 had seen. That beautiful face and form were not new to him ; 
 but he had only a confused impression as to where and when he 
 had seen them. He perceived, however, that he was not to ask. 
 He followed her with his eyes as she rose from her low seat, and 
 placed herself close by one of the open jalousies, so as to hear 
 what passed within. 
 
 " It is the English deputation," said Paul. " Hear what my 
 brother wiU say." 
 
 " What will become of them ? " said Madame. " I do not 
 know what would become of me if my husband were ever as 
 angry with me as I know he is with them." 
 
 There were indeed signs of wrath in the countenance which 
 was commonly gentle as the twilight. The rigid uprightness of 
 his figure, the fiery eye, the distended nostril, aU showed that 
 Toussaint was struggling with anger. Before him stood a group 
 of Englishmen — a sailor holding a wand, on which was fixed a 
 small white banner, two gentlemen in plain clothes, the captain 
 of the frigate which rode in the bay, and a colonel of the English 
 troops in Jamaica. 
 
 " It is all very well, gentlemen," Toussaint was saying — " it 
 is all very well as regards the treaty. Twenty-four hours ago

THE ENGLISH DEPUTATION. IO7 
 
 we should have had no difficulty in concluding it. But what 
 have you to say to this treatment of women on board the schooner 
 you captured ? What have you to say to your act of taking all 
 the gentlemen out of your prize (except one who would not quit 
 his sister), leaving the ladies in charge of a brutal prize-master, 
 who was drunk — was it not so P " he added, turning to one of his 
 officers. 
 
 " It was : he was drunk, and refused the ladies access to their 
 trunks of clothes, denied them the wine left for their use, and 
 alarmed them extremely by his language. These ladies were 
 wives of our most distinguished officers." 
 
 " It matters not whose wives they were," said Toussaiut : 
 " they were women ; and I wiU treat with none who thus show 
 themselves not to be men." 
 
 " We do not ask you to treat with my prize-master," said 
 Captain Reynolds. " If it be true " 
 
 " It is true," said a voice from the window, to which aU lis- 
 tened in a moment. "My maid and I were on board that 
 schooner ; from which we landed four hours ago. It is true that 
 we were confined to the cabin, denied the refreshments that were 
 before our eyes, and the use of our own clothes ; and it is true 
 that the oaths and threats of a drunken man were in our eai-s all 
 night. When morning came, we looked out to see if we were 
 really in the seas of St. Domingo. It seemed as if we had been 
 conveyed where the whites are still paramount." And Th&ese 
 indignantly walked away. 
 
 " You hear ! " said Toussaint. " And you ask me to trade 
 with Jamaica ! While permitted to obtain provisions from our 
 coast, you have captured a French schooner and a sloop in our 
 seas ; you have insulted our women ; and now you propose a 
 treaty ! If it were not for that banner, you would have to treat 
 for mercy." 
 
 " When shall I be permitted to speak ? " asked Captain 
 Reynolds. 
 
 "Now." 
 
 " The blame is mine, I appointed a prize-master, who, it now 
 appears, was not trustworthy. I was not aware of this ; and I 
 left in the cabin, for the use of the ladies, -all their own property, 
 two cases of wine, and such fruits as I could obtain for them. I 
 lament to find that my confidence was misplaced ; and I pledge 
 myself that the prize-master shall be punished. After offering 
 my apologies to the ofEended ladies, I will retire to my ship, 
 leaving this business of the treaty to appear as unconnected as 
 it really is with this mischance. Allow me to be conducted to 
 the presence of the ladies." 
 
 " I will charge myself with your apologies," said Toussaint, 
 who knew that any white stood a small chance of a good

 reception from Therese. " I accept your acknowledgment of error, 
 Captain Reynolds, and shall be ready to proceed witli the treaty, 
 on proof of the punishment of the prize-master. Gentlemen, I 
 regard this treaty with satisfaction, and am willing to enclose 
 this small tract of peace in the midst of the dreary wilderness 
 of war. I am willing to see trade established between Jamaica 
 and St. Domingo. There are days when your blue mountains 
 are seen from our shores. Let to-morrow be a bi-ight day when 
 no cloud shall hide us from one another's friendship." 
 
 "To-morrow," the deputation from Jamaica agreed, as they 
 bowed themselves out of the presence of the Commander-in-chief. 
 
 " More English ! more English ! " was whispered round, when 
 the name of Gauthier was announced. 
 
 " No ; not English," observed some, on seeing that the five 
 who now entered, though in the English uniform, were mulattoes. 
 
 " Not English," said Toussaint, aloud. " English soldiers 
 are honourable, whether as friends or foes. When we meet with 
 the spying eye, and the bribing hand, we do not believe them to 
 be English. Such are the eyes and hands of these men. They 
 have the audacity to present themselves as guests, when their 
 own hearts should tell them they are prisoners." 
 
 " Prisoners ! " exclaimed Gauthier and his companions. 
 
 " Tes, surely — prisoners. Tour conduct has already been 
 judged by a military commission, and you are sentenced. If 
 you have more to say than you had to plead to me, say it when I 
 have read." 
 
 Toussaint took from among the papers on the table a letter 
 brought, as Gauthier alleged, from the English commander. Sir 
 Thomas Brisbane, declaring Gauthier empowered to treat for the 
 delivery to the British of the posts of Gonaives, Les Verrettes, 
 and some others, in order to secure to the British the freedom of 
 the windward passage. Toussaint declared that the messengers 
 had brought with them bags of money, with which they had 
 endeavoured to bribe him to this treachery. He asked of them 
 if this were not true. 
 
 " It is," said Gauthier ; " but we and our authorities acted 
 upon the precedent of your former conduct." 
 
 " What former conduct P Did these hands ever receive gold 
 from the cofBers of an enemy ? Speak freely. Tou shall not 
 suffer from anything you may say here." 
 
 " Tou have been the means by which posts have been delivered 
 to an enemy. We remember hearing of the surrender of Mar- 
 malade, Gros Mome, and some others." 
 
 " I was the means, as you say ; but it was done by a wiser 
 will and a stronger hand than mine. In that transaction my 
 heart was pure. My design was to lose rank, and to return to 
 poverty by the step I took. Tou ought to have inquired into

 facts, clearly understood by all who know me, before yon pro- 
 ceeded to insult me. Have you more to say ? " 
 
 " It was natural tbat we should believe that he through whom 
 posts had been delivered would deliver posts again; and this 
 was confirmed by rumours, and I believe, even by letters which 
 seemed to come from yourself, in relation to the posts now in 
 question." 
 
 Gauthier appealed to his companions, who all assented. 
 
 " There are other rumours concerning me," said Toussaint, 
 " which could not be perverted ; and to these you should have 
 listened. My actions are messages addressed to the whole world 
 — letters which cannot be forged ; and these alone you should 
 have trusted. Such misunderstanding as yours could hardly 
 have been foreseen ; but it will be my fault if it be repeated. 
 The name of the First of the Blacks must never again be 
 associated with bribery. Tou are sentenced by a military com- 
 mission, before which your documents have been examined, to 
 run the gauntlet. The sentence will immediately be executed 
 in the Place d'Armes." 
 
 "Are you aware," cried Gauthier, " that I was second in com- 
 mand at St. Marc when it was in the possession of the British ? " 
 
 " I am aware of it." 
 
 " This is enmity to our colour," said another. " To our being 
 mulattoes we owe our disgrace." 
 
 "I have beloved friends of your colour," said Tonssaiut. 
 " Believe me, however, the complexion of your souls is so 
 disgusting that I have no attention to spare for your faces. 
 Tou must now depart." 
 
 " Change our punishment ! " said Gauthier. " Consider that 
 I am an emigrant officer. Some other punishment ! " 
 
 " No other," said Toussaint. " This is the fit punishment — 
 mean as your design — ridicxdous as your attempt. Are the 
 Trench Commissaries in waiting, Laroche P Let them be 
 announced." 
 
 The prisoners were removed by one door, while the imposing 
 party from France entered by the other. 
 
 Commissary Hedouville, who had been for some time resident 
 at Cap Fran9ais, entered, followed by a party of his countrymen, 
 just arrived from Paris. There was among them one, at sight of 
 whom Toussaint's countenance changed, while an exclamation 
 was heard from the piazza, which showed that his family were 
 moved like himself. The person who excited this emotion was 
 a young black officer, who entered smiling, and as if scarcely 
 able to keep his place behind the Commissary, and General 
 Michel, the head of the new deputation. 
 
 The Commander-in-chief quitted his station, and advanced 
 some steps, seizing the officer's hand, and askingr eagerly —

 " Which we will speak of when I have offered my welcome

 Toussaint, turning to the Commissary and the General, and

 the moment, to lose sight of the business of the hour. He made 
 
 * I have to aokaowledge that injustipe is done in this work to the cha- 
 racter of General Viaoent. The writer of historical fiction is under that 
 serious liability, in seizing on a few actual incidents, concerning a subor- 
 dinate personage, that he makes himself responsible for justice to the 
 whole character of the individual whose name he iutroduces into his 
 story. Under this liability I have been unjust to Vincent, as Scott was 
 to Edward Christian, in " Peveril of the Peak," and Campbell to Brandt, 
 in " Gertrude of Wyoming." Like them, I am anxious to make repar- 
 ation on the first opportimity. It is true that in my Appendix I avowed 
 that Vincent was among those of my personages whose name alone I 
 adopted, without knowing his character ; but such an explanation in an 
 appendix does not counteract the impression already made by the work. 
 Finding this, I had thoughts of changing the name in the present edition ; 
 but I feared the character being still identified with Vincent, from its 
 being fact that it was Vincent who accompanied Toussaint's sons to 
 Paris, and returned with the deputation, as I have represented ; I think 
 it best, therefore, to say here that, from all I can learn, General Vincent 
 was an honourable and useful man, and that the delineation of character 
 under that name in my book is purely fictitious. The following extract 
 from Clarkson's pamphlet on Negro Improvement will show in what 
 estimation GenertU Vincent is held by one whose testimony is of the 
 highest value : — 
 
 "The next witness to whom I shall appeal is the estimable General 
 Vincent, who now lives at Paris, though at an advanced age. He was a 
 Colonel, and afterwards a General of Brigade of Artillery in St. Domingo. 
 He was detained there during the time both of Santhonax and Toussaint. 
 He was also a proprietor of estates in the island. He was the man who 
 planned the renovation of its agriculture after the abolition of slavery, 
 and one of the great instruments in bringing it to the perfection men- 
 tioned by La Croix. In the year 1801 he was called upon by Toussaint 
 to repair to Paris, to lay before the Directory the new Constitution, 
 which had been agreed on in St. Domingo. He obeyed the summons. 
 It happened that he arrived in France just at the moment of the Peace 
 of Amiens. Here he found, to his inexpressible surprise and grief, that 
 Bonaparte was preparing an immense armament, under Leclero, to 
 restore slavery in St. Domingo. He remonstrated against the expedition : 
 he told him to his face that though the army destined for this purpose 
 was composed of the brilliant conquerors of Europe, they could do 
 nothing m the Antilles. He stated, as another argument against the 
 expedition, that it was totally unnecessary, and, therefore, criminal ; for 
 that everything was going on. well in St. Domingo ; the proprietors in 
 peaceable possession of their estates, cultivation making rapid progress, 
 the Blacks mdustrious, and beyond example happy,"

HONOURS FROM FRANCE. Ill 
 
 himself the usher of the French Oommissaries to the sofa, in 
 front of which he had himself been standing. There he would 
 have seated H^douville and General Michel. Hedouville threw 
 himself down willingly enough; but the newly arrived mes- 
 senger chose to stand. 
 
 " I come," said he, " the bearer to you of honours from the 
 Republic, which I delight to present as the humblest of your 
 servants. — Not a word of apology for your graceful action of 
 welcome to Brigadier- General Vincent ! Wliat so graceful as 
 the emotions of a parent's heart ? I understand — I am aware — 
 he went out as the guardian of your sons ; and your first wel- 
 come was, therefore, due to him. The office of guai'dian of your 
 sons is, ought to be, in your eyes, more important, more sacred, 
 than that of Commissary, or any other. If our national 
 Deliverer — if the conqueror of Italy — if our First Consul himself 
 were here, he ought to step back while you embrace the guardian 
 of your sons." 
 
 The party in the piazza saw and heard all. 
 
 "If," said Madame, in a whisper to Genifrede, "if these 
 honours that they speak of come from Bonaparte — if he has 
 answered your father's letter, your father wiU think his happiness 
 complete — now we know that the boys are well." 
 
 " The First Consul has written, or will write, no doubt," said 
 Aimee. " It must be pleasant to him as to my father, to greet 
 a brother in destiny and in glory. Surely General Vincent will 
 come and speak to us ; will tell us of my brothers ! He looked 
 this way just now." 
 
 " The First Consul wiU not write," said Moyse. " He is a 
 white ; and therefore, though a brother in destiny and in glory, 
 he will not notice the Commander-in-chief of St. Domingo." 
 
 " Tou are right, Moyse," said Madame Dessalines. '' And it 
 is best so." 
 
 " But that will disappoint my husband very much," said 
 Madame. '' He likes the whites better than you do." 
 
 •' He does," said Therese. " But let us listen." 
 
 Hedouville was at the moment exerting himself to iutroduco 
 his secretary, M. Pascal. 
 
 " An honoured name," observed Toussaint. 
 
 "And not only in name, but by blood connected with the 
 great man you refer to," said Hedouville. 
 
 " None are more welcome here," said Toussaint, " than those 
 who bring with them the honours of piety, of reason, and of 
 science." And he looked with deep interest upon the counte- 
 nance of the secretary, which did in truth show signs of that 
 thoughtfulness and sagacity, though not of the morbid sufPering, 
 which is associated in all minds with the image of the author of 
 the Provinciales. M, Pascal returned the gaze which was fixed

112 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 upon him with one in which intense curiosity was mingled with 
 doubt, if not fear. His countenance immediately, however, 
 relaxed into an expression of pleased surprise. During this 
 brief moment, these two men, so unlike — the elderly, toil-worn 
 negro, and the young, studious rrenchman— f elt that they were 
 friends. 
 
 M. Pascal stepped aside to make way for M. Moliere. 
 
 "Are we to welcome in you," asked Toussaint, " a messenger 
 of mirth to our society ? " 
 
 The group of Frenchmen could scarcely restrain their laughter 
 at this question. M. Moliere had a most lugubrious countenance 
 —a thing not always inconsistent with a merry humour : but 
 M. Moliere's heart was believed never to have laughed, any 
 more than his face. He answered, as if announcing a misfor- 
 tune, that he claimed no connection with the dramatist, though 
 he believed some of his family had attempted to do so. 
 
 " M. Moliere discharges the duty of a pious descendant, 
 however," said Vincent. " He laughs himself into such a state 
 of exhaustion every night over those immortal comedies, that 
 he has to be carried to bed. That is the reason we see him so 
 grave in the morning." 
 
 " Think of M. Moliere as a trusted secretary of the messenger 
 from the republic to yourself," said General Michel. 
 
 " I come," said Michel, assuming a pompous tone, " I come 
 associated with an officer of the republican army, M. Petion — a 
 native of this colony, but a stranger to yourself." 
 
 M. Potion paid his respects. He was a mulatto, with shy 
 and reserved manners, and an exceedingly intellectual coun- 
 tenance. 
 
 " "We lost you early," said Toussaint ; " but only to offer you 
 the warmer welcome back. It was, as I remember, to attend 
 the military schools of Prance that you left your home. Such 
 scholars are welcome here." 
 
 " And particularly," observed Michel, " when they have also 
 had the fortune to serve in the army of Italy, and immediately 
 under the eye of the First Consul himself." 
 
 " Is it so P Is it really so ? " exclaimed Toussaint. " I can 
 
 never hear enoflgh of the ruler of France. TeU us but that 
 
 must be hereafter. Do you come to me from him P " 
 
 " From the government generally," replied Petion. 
 
 An expression of disappointment, very evident to his watch- 
 ful wife, passed over the face of Toussaint. 
 
 " There is no letter," she whispered to Genifrede. 
 
 " "We bring you from the government," said Michel, " a con- 
 firmation of the dignity of Commander-in-chief of this colony, 
 conferred by Commissary Santhonax." 
 
 Toussaint bowed, but smiled not.

TOUSSAINJ'S FAME IN EUROPE. II3 
 
 " See, he sighs ! " said Madame, sighing in echo. 
 
 " These are empty words," said Theresa. " They give him 
 only what they cannot withhold ; and at the very moment they 
 surround him with spies." 
 
 " He sajs," replied Madame, " that Hedouville is sent here 
 ' to restrain his ambition.' Those were the words spoken of 
 Mm at Paris, where they will not believe that he has no selfish 
 ambition." 
 
 " They will not believe, because they cannot understand. 
 Their Commander-in-chief has a selfish ambition ; and they can- 
 not imagine that ours may be a man of a higher soul. But we 
 cannot help it : they are whites." 
 
 " What a dress — what a beautiful dress ! " exclaimed Madame, 
 who almost condescended to stand fairly in the window, to see 
 the presents now displayed before her husband by the commis- 
 sary's servants. 
 
 "These presents," pursued General Michel, while Potion 
 stood aloof, as if he had no concern in the business — " this dress 
 of embroidered velvet, and this set of arms, I am to present to 
 you, in the name of the late Directory of France, in token of 
 their admiration of your services to the colony." 
 
 Toussaint stretched out his hand for the sword, which he 
 immediately assumed instead of the one he wore, observing that 
 this sword, like that which he had now laid aside, should be 
 employed in loyal service to the republic. As he took no notice 
 of the embroidered dress, it was conveyed away. 
 
 " Not only in the hall of government,'' resumed Michel — 
 " but throughout all Europe, is your name ringing to the skies. 
 A eulogium has been delivered at the Council of Ancients " 
 
 " And an oration before the governors of the Military Schools," 
 added H^douviUe. 
 
 " And from Paris," said Pascal, " your reputation has spread 
 along the shores of the Rhine, and as far north as St. Peters- 
 burg ; and in the south,even to Rome." 
 
 Toussaint's ear caught a low laugh of delight from the piazza, 
 which he thought fit alone for a husband's ear, and therefore 
 hoped that no one else had heard. 
 
 "Enough, gentlemen," he said. "Measuring together my 
 deeds and this applause, I understand the truth. This applause 
 is in fact given to the powers of the negro race ; and not to 
 myself as a soldier or a man. It belongs not, therefore, to me. 
 For my personal support, one line of a letter, one word of mes- 
 sage, from the chief of our common country, would be worth the 
 applause of Europe, of wliich you speak." 
 
 M. Petion produced a sealed packet, which he delivered; 
 and this seemed to remind General Vincent that he had one too. 
 Toussaint was unable to refrain from tearing open first one, and

 then the other, in the intense hope of receiving some acknow- 
 ledgment, some greeting from the '.' brother in destiny and in 
 glory," who was the idol of his loyal heart. There was no word 
 from Bonaparte among the first papers ; and it was scarcely 
 possible that there should be in the other packet ; yet he could 
 not keep his eye from it. Other eyes were watching from behind 
 the jalousies. He cast a glance, a half smile that way ; the con- 
 sequence of which was that Aimee, forgetting the time, the 
 deputation, the officers, the whole crowd, sprang into the room, 
 and received the letter from Isaac, which was the only thing in 
 aU that room that she saw. She disappeared in another 
 moment, followed, however, by General Vincent. 
 
 The father's smUe died away from the face of Toussaint, and 
 his brow darkened, as he caught at a glance the contents of the 
 proclamations contained in Petion's packet. A glance was 
 enough. Before the eyes of the company had returned from 
 the window, whither they had followed the apparition of Aimee, 
 he had folded up the papers. His secretary's hand was ready 
 to receive them : but Toussaint put them into his bosom. 
 
 " Those proclamations," said Hedouville, rising from the sofa, 
 and standing by Toussaint's side, " you will immediately publish. 
 You will immediately exhibit on your colours the words imposed, 
 ' Brave blacks, remember that the French people alone recognise 
 your freedom, and the legality of your rights ! ' " 
 
 As the commissary spoke these words aloud, he looked round 
 upon the assembled blacks, who, in their turn, all fixed their 
 eyes upon their chief. Toussaint merely replied that he would 
 give his best attention to all communications from the govern- 
 ment of France. 
 
 " In order," said Hedouville, as if in explanation of a friend's 
 purposes, '' in order to yield implicit obedience to its commands." 
 Then resuming his seat, he observed to Toussaint, " I believe 
 General Michel desires some little explanation of certain circum- 
 stances attending his landing at Cap." 
 
 " I do," said General Michel, resuming his solemn air. "You 
 are aware that General Vincent and I were arrested on land- 
 ingP" 
 
 " I am aware of it. It was by my instant command that you 
 were set free." 
 
 " By whose command, or by what error, then, were we 
 arrested ? " 
 
 " I hoped that fuU satisfaction had been afforded you by M. 
 • Raymond, the Governor of Cap Fran^ais. Did he not explain 
 to you that it was by an impulse of the irritated blacks — an 
 impulse of which they repent, and to which they will not again 
 yield, proceeding from anger for which there is but too much 
 cause P As you, however, are not to be made responsible for the

 faults of your government towards us, the offending parties have 
 been amply punished." 
 
 " I," said HedouviUe, from the sofa behind, " I am held re- 
 sponsible for the faults of our government towards you. What 
 are they ? " 
 
 " We will discuss them at Cap," replied Toussaint. " There 
 you will be surrounded by troops of your own colour ; and you 
 will feel more at liberty to open your whole mind to me than, it 
 grieves me to perceive, you are when surrounded by blacks. 
 When you know the blacks better, you will become aware that 
 the highest security is found in fully trusting them." 
 
 " What is it that, you suppose we fear from the blacks ? " 
 
 " When we are at Cap, I will ask you what it was that you 
 feared, M. HedouviUe, when yon chose to land at St. Domingo, 
 instead of at Cap — when you showed your mistrust of your 
 fellow-citizens by selecting the Spanish city for your point of 
 entrance upon our island. I will then ask you what it is that 
 your government fears, that it commits the interests of the blacks 
 to a new legislature, which understands neither their temper nor 
 their affairs." 
 
 " This was, perhaps, the cause of the difiB.calty we met with 
 at Cap," observed General Michel. 
 
 " It is the chief cause. Some jealousy on this account is not 
 to be wondered at ; but it has not the less been punished. I 
 would further ask," he continued, turning again to HedouviUe, 
 " what the First Consul fears, that " 
 
 " Who ever heard of the First Consul fearing anything ? " 
 cried HedouviUe, with a smile. 
 
 " Hear it now, then." 
 
 " In this place P " said HedouviUe, looking round. " In 
 public ? " 
 
 "In this place — among the most loyal of the citizens of 
 France," replied Toussaint, casting a proud look round upon his 
 officers and assembled friends. If I were about to make com- 
 plaints of the First Consul, I would close my doors upon you and 
 myself, and speak in whispers. But it is known that I honour 
 him, and hold him to my heart, as a brother in destiny and in 
 glory : though his glory is now at its height, while mine will 
 not be so tiU my race is redeemed from the consequences of 
 slavery, as weU as from slavery itself. StUl, we are brothers ; 
 and I therefore mourn his fears, shown in the documents that 
 he sends to my soldiers, and shown no less in his sending none 
 to me." 
 
 " I bring you from him the confirmation of your dignity," 
 observed General Michel. 
 
 " You do so by message. The honour is received through the 
 ear. But that which should plant it down into my heart — the

 greeting from a brother — is wanting. It cannot be that the First 
 of the Whites has not time, has not attention, for the First of 
 the Blacks. It is that he fears— not for himseK, but for our 
 country: he fears our ambition, our revenge. He shall experience, 
 however, that we are loyal — from myself, his brother, to the 
 mountain child who startles the vulture from the rocks with his 
 shouts of Bonaparte the Great. To engage our loyalty before 
 many witnesses," he continued, once more looking round upon 
 the assemblage, " I send this message through you, in return for 
 that which I have received. Tell the First Consul that, in the 
 absence of interference with the existing laws of the colony, I 
 guarantee, under my personal responsibility, the submission to 
 order, and the devotion to France, of my black brethren. Mark 
 the condition, gentlemen, which you will pronounce reasonable. 
 Mark the condition, and you will find happy results. Ton will 
 soon see whether I pledge in vain my own responsibility and 
 your hopes." 
 
 Even while he spoke, in all the f ervom* of unquestionable 
 sincerity, of his devotion to France, his French hearers felt that 
 he was virtually a monarch. The First of the Blacks was not- 
 only supreme in this palace, and throughout the colony ; he had 
 entered upon an immortal reign over all lands trodden by the 
 children of Africa. To the contracted gaze of the diplomatists 
 present, aU might not be visible — the coming ages when the 
 now prophetic name of L'Ouverture should have become a bright 
 fact in the history of man, and should be breathed in thanks- 
 giving under the palm-tree, sung in exultation in the cities 
 of Africa, and embalmed in the liberties of the Isles of the 
 West : — such a sovereignty as this was too vast and too distant 
 for the conceptions of Michel and H^douville to embrace ; but 
 they were impressed with a sense of his power, with a feeling of 
 the majesty of his influence ; and the reverential emotions which 
 they would fain have shaken off, and which they were after- 
 wards ashamed of, were at the present moment enhanced by 
 sounds which reached them from the avenue. There was 
 military music, the firing of salutes, the murmur of a multitude 
 of voices, and the tramp of horses and of men. 
 
 Toussaint courteously invited the commissaries to witness the 
 presentation to him, for the interests of France, of the keys of 
 the cities of the island, late in the possession of Spain, and now 
 ceded to France by the treaty of Bale. The commissaries could 
 not refuse, and took their stand on one side of the First of the 
 Blacks, while Paul L'Ouverture assumed the place of honour on 
 the other hand. 
 
 The apartment was completely filled by the heads of the 
 procession— the late Governor of the city of St. Domingo, his 
 officers, the magistracy of the city, and the heads of the clergy,

CESSION OF ST. DOMINGO. 1 1 7 
 
 Among these last was a face which Toussaint recognised with 
 strong emotion. The look which he cast upon Laxahou, the 
 gesture of greeting which he offered, caused Don Alonzo Dovaro 
 to turn round to discover whose presence there could be more 
 imposing to the Oommander-in-chief than his own. The iiushed 
 countenance of the priest marked him out as the man. 
 
 Don Alonzo Dovaro ordered the keys to be brought, and ad- 
 dressed himself in Spanish to Toussaint. Toussaint did not 
 understand Spanish, and knew that the Spaniard could speak 
 French. The Spaniard, however, chose to deliver up a Spanish 
 city in no other language than that of his nation. Father Lax- 
 abon stepped forward eagerly, with an offer to be interpreter. 
 It was an opportunity he was too thankful to embrace — a most 
 favourable means of surmounting the awkwardness of renewed 
 intercourse with one, by whom their last conversation could not 
 be supposed to be forgotten. 
 
 " This is well — this fulfilment of the treaty of Bale,'' said 
 Toussaint. " But it would have been better if the fulfilment 
 had been more prompt. The time for excuses and apologies is 
 past. I merely say, as sincerity requires, that the most speedy 
 fulfilment of treaties is ever the most honourable ; and that I 
 am guiltless of such injury as may have arisen from calling off 
 ten thousand blacks from the peaceful pursuits of agriculture 
 and commerce, to march them to the gates of St. Domingo. 
 Tou, the authorities of the city, compelled me to lead them 
 there, in enforcement of the claims of France. If warlike 
 thoughts have sprung up in those ten thousand minds, the re- 
 sponsibility is not mine. I wish that nothing but peace should 
 be in the hearts of men of all races. Have you wishes to express, 
 in the name of the citizens? Show me how I can gratify them." 
 
 " Don Alonzo Dovaro explains," said the interpreter, " that 
 it vnll be acceptable to the Spanish inhabitants that you take the 
 customary oath, in the name of the Holy Trinity, respecting the 
 government of their whole region." 
 
 " It is indeed a holy duty. What is the purport of the 
 oath?" 
 
 " In the name of the Holy Trinity, to govern wisely and weU." 
 
 " Has there lived a Christian man who would take that oath ? " 
 
 " Every governor of the Spanish colony in this island, from 
 Diego, the brother of Columbus, to this day." 
 
 "What is human wisdom," said Toussaint, "that a man 
 should swear that he will be always wise ? What is human 
 virtue, that he should pledge his salvation on governing well ? 
 I dare net take the oath." 
 
 The Spaniards showed that they understood French by the 
 looks they cast upon each other, before Laxabon could complete 
 his version.

Il8 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " This, however, will I do," said Toussaint. " I will meet 
 you to-morrow, at the great church in Port-au-Prince, and there 
 bind myself before the altar, before the God who hears me now, 
 on behalf of your people, to be silent on the past, and to employ 
 my vigilance and my toils in rendering happy the Spanish people, 
 now become my fellow-citizens of France." 
 
 A profusion of obeisances proved that this was satisfactory. 
 The late governor of the city took from one of his officers the 
 velvet cushion on which were deposited the keys of St. Domingo, 
 and transferred it to the hands of the Commander-in-chief. At 
 the moment, there was an explosion of cannon from the terrace 
 on which stood the town ; the bells rang in aU the churches ; and 
 bursts of military music spread over the calm bay, with the 
 wreaths of white smoke from the guns. The flamingoes took 
 flight again from the strand ; the ships moved in their anchorage ; 
 the shouts of the people arose from the town, and those of the 
 soldiery from the square of the great avenue. Their idol, their 
 Ouverture, was now in command of the whole of the most 
 beautiful of the isles of the west. 
 
 As soon as he could be heard, Toussaint introduced his brother 
 to the Spaniards. Placing the cushion containing the keys upon 
 the table, and laying his hand upon the keys, he declared his 
 intention of giving to the inhabitants of the city of St. Domingo 
 a pledge of the merciful and gentle character of the government 
 under which they were henceforth to live, in the person of the 
 new governor, Paul L'Ouvertnre, who had never been known 
 to remember unkindness from day to day. The new governor 
 would depart for the east of the island on the morrow, from the 
 door of the church, at the close of the celebration. 
 
 The levde was now over. Spanish, French, and the family 
 and guests of the Commander-in-chief, were to meet at a ban- 
 quet in the evening. Meantime, Toussaint and his brother 
 stepped out together upon the northern piazza, and the room 
 was cleared. 
 
 " I wish," said Paul, " that you had appointed amy one but 
 me to be governor of that city. How should a poor negro 
 fisherman lite me govern a city ? " 
 
 " Tou speak like a white, Paul. The whites say of me, ' How 
 should a poor negro postillion govern a colony ? ' Tou must do 
 as I do — show that a negro can govern."

THE GOVERNOR OF ST. DOMINGO. II9 
 
 Heuri must remaiu in the field while Rigaud is in arms. 
 Jacques " 
 
 " Ay, Dessalines — and he might have a court — such a wife 
 as he would carry." 
 
 " Dessalines must not govern a city of whites. He hates the 
 whites. His passion of hatred would grow with power ; and the 
 Spaniards would be wretched. They are now under my pro- 
 tection. I must give them a governor who cannot liate ; and 
 therefore I send you. Your love of our people and of me, my 
 brother, will rouse you to exertion and self-denial. For the rest 
 you shall have able counsellors on the spot. For your pr'vate 
 guidance, I shall be ever at your call. Confide wholly in me, 
 and your appeal shall never be unanswered." 
 
 " Tou shall be governor, then. I will wear the robes, and 
 your head shall do the work. I will amuse the inhabitants with 
 water-parties, and you " 
 
 " No more of this ! " said Toussaint, somewhat sternly. " It 
 seems that you are unwilling to do your part of the great duty 
 of our age and our race. Heaven has appointed you the oppor- 
 tunity of showing that blacks are men — fit to govern as to serve; 
 — and you would rather sleep in the simshine than listen to the 
 message from the sky. My own brother does what he can to 
 deepen the brand on the forehead of the negro ! " 
 
 " I am ashamed, brother," said Paul. " I am not like you ; 
 but yet I will do what I can. I wiU go to-morrow, and try 
 whether I can toil as you do. There is one thing I can do wliich 
 Henri, and Jacques, and even you, cannot ; — I can speak Spanish." 
 
 " Tou have discovered one of your qualifications, dear Paul. 
 You will find more. Will you take Moyse with you P " 
 
 " Let it be a proof that I can deny myself, that I leave my 
 son with you. Moyse is passionate." 
 
 " I know it," said Toussaint. 
 
 "He governs both his love and his hatred before you, while 
 with me he indulges them. He must remain with you, in order 
 to command his passions. He inherited them from me ; and I 
 must thus far help him to master them. You are all-powerful 
 with him. I have no power." 
 
 " You mean that Genifrede and I together are all-powerful 
 with him. I believe it is so." 
 
 " To you, then, I commit him. Moyse is henceforth your son." 
 
 " As Genifrede is your daughter, Paul. If I die before the 
 peace of the island is secured, there are two duties which I 
 assign to you — to support the spirit of the blacks, and to take 
 my G&ifrede for your daughter. The rest of my family love 
 each other, and the world we live in. She loves only Moyse." 
 
 "She is henceforth my child. But when will you marry 
 them?"

i^O THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " When Moyse stall liave done some act to distinguisli him- 
 self — for which he shall not want opportunity. I have a higher 
 duty than that to my family — it is my duty to call out all the 
 powers of every black. Moyse must therefore prove what he 
 can do, before he can marry his love. For him, however, this is 
 an easy condition." 
 
 " I doubt not you are right, brother ; but it is well for me 
 that the days of my love are past." 
 
 " Not so, Paul. The honour of your race must now be youi* 
 love. For this you must show what you can do." 
 
 They had paced the northern piazza while conversing. They 
 now turned into the eastern, where they came upon the lovers, 
 who were standing half shrouded by creeping plants — Moyse's 
 arm round G-enifrede's waist, and GdnifrSde's head resting on 
 her lover's shoulder. The poor girl was sobbing violently, while 
 Moyse was declaring that he would marry her, with or without 
 consent, and carry her with him, if he was henceforth to live in 
 the east of the island. 
 
 " Patience, foolish boy ! " cried his father. " Tou go not with 
 me. I commit you to my brother. Tou will stay with him, 
 and yield him the duty of a son — a better duty than we heard 
 you planning just now." 
 
 " As soon as you prove yourself worthy, you shall be my son 
 indeed," said Toussaint. " I have heard your plans of marriage. 
 Tou shall hear mine. I wUl give you opportunities of distin- 
 guishing yourself, in the services of the city and of the field. 
 After the first act which proves you worthy of responsibility, I 
 wiU give you G^nifrede. As a free man, can you desire more ? " 
 "I am satisfied — I am grateful," said Moyse. "I believe I 
 spoke some hasty words just now ; but we supposed I was to be 
 sent among the whites — and I had so lately returned from the 
 south — and Genifrede was so wretched ! " 
 
 Genifrede threw herself on her father's bosom, with broken 
 words of love and gratitude. It was the first time she had ever 
 voluntarily approached so near him; and she presently drew 
 back, and glanced in his face with timid awe. 
 
 " My Genifrede ! My child ! " cried Toussaint, in a rapture 
 of pleasure at this loosening of the heart. He drew her towards 
 him, folded his arms about her, kissed the tears from her cheek, 
 and hushed her sobs, saying, in a low voice which touched her 
 very soul — 
 
 " He can do great deeds, G&ifrede. He is yours, my child ; 
 but we shall all be proud of him." 
 
 She looked up once more, with a countenance so radiant, that 
 Toussaint carried into aU the toils and observance of the day 
 the light heart of a happy father.

 CHAPTER XI. 
 
 l'etoile and its people. 
 
 One radiant day of the sviooeeding spring, a party was seen in 
 the plain of Oul-de-Sac, moving with such a train as showed 
 that one of the principal families of the island was travelling. 
 Rigaud and his forces were so safely engaged in the south, that 
 the plain was considered secure from their incursions. Port-au- 
 Prince, surrounded on three sides by hills, was now becoming so 
 hot, that such of its inhabitants as had estates in the country 
 were glad to retire to them, as soon as the roads were declared 
 safe ; and among these were the family of the Oommander-in- 
 chief, who, with tutors, visitors, and attendants, formed the 
 group seen in the Oul-de-Sao this day. They were removing to 
 their estate of Pongaudin, on the shores of the bay of Gonaves, 
 a little to the north of the junction of the Artibonite with the 
 sea ; but instead of travelling straight and fast, they intended 
 to make a three days' journey of what might have been accom- 
 plished in less than two — partly for the sake of the pleasure of 
 the excursion, and partly to introduce their friends from Europe 
 to some of the beauties of the most beautiful island in the 
 world. 
 
 Madame L'Ouverture had had presents of European carriages, 
 in which she did not object to take airings in the towns and 
 their neighbourhood ; but nowhere else were the roads in a state 
 to bear such heavy vehicles. In the sandy bridle-paths they 
 would have sunk half their depth; in the green tracks they 
 would have been caught in thickets of brambles and low boughs ; 
 while many swamps occurred which could be crossed only by 
 single horses, accustomed to pick their way in uncertain ground. 
 The ladies of the colony, therefore, continued, as in all time 
 past, to take their journeys on horseback, each attended by 
 some one — a servant, if there were neither father, brother, nor 
 lover — ^to hold the umbrella over her during rain, or the more 
 oppressive hours of sunshine. 
 
 The family of L'Ouverture had left the palace early, and were 
 bound for an estate in the middle of the plain, where thoy in- 
 tended to rest, either tiE evening, or till the next morning, as 
 inclination might determine. As their train, first of horses, and 
 then of mules, passed along, now under avenues of lofty palms, 
 which constituted a deep, moist shade in the midst of the glare 
 of the morning — now across fields of sward, kept green by the 
 wells which were made to overflow them ; and now through 
 swamps where the fragrant flowering reeds reached up to the 
 flanks of the horses, and courted the hands of the riders, the

122 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 inliabitants of the region watched their progress, and gave them 
 every variety of kindly greeting. The mother who was sitting 
 at work under the tamarind- tree called her children down from 
 its topmost branches to do honour to the travellers. Many a 
 half-naked negro in the rice-grounds slipped from the wet plank 
 on which, while gazing, he forgot his footing, and laughed his 
 welcome from out of the mud and slime. The white planters 
 who were taking their morning ride over their estates, bent to 
 the saddle-bow, the large straw hat in hand, and would not 
 cover their heads from the hot sun till the ladies had passed. 
 These planters' wives and daughters, seated at the shaded win- 
 dows, or in the piazzas of their houses, rose and curtsied deep 
 to the ladies L'Ouverture. Many a little black head rose drip- 
 ping from the clear waters, gleaming among the reeds, where 
 negro children love to watch the gigantic dragon-flies of the 
 tropics creeping from their sheaths, and to catch them as soon 
 as they spread, their gauzy wings, and exhibit their gem-like 
 bodies to the sunlight. Many a group of cultivators in the 
 cane-grounds grasped their arms, on hearing the approach of 
 numbers — taught thus by habitual danger — but swung back 
 the gun across the shoulder, or tucked the pistol again into the 
 belt, at sight of the ladies ; and then ran to the road- side to 
 remove any fancied obstruction in the path ; or, if they could do 
 no more, to smile a welcome. It was observable that, in every 
 case, there was an eager glance, in the first place, of search for 
 L'Ouverture himself; but when it was seen that he was not 
 there, there was still all the joy that could be shown where he 
 was not. 
 
 The whole country was full of song. As M. Loisir, the archi- 
 tect from Paris, said to Genifrede, it appeai-ed as if vegetation 
 itself went on to music. The servants of their own party sang 
 in the rear ; Moyse and Denis, and sometimes Denis' sisters, sang 
 as they rode ; and if there was not song already on the track, it 
 came from behind every flowering hedge — from the crown of the 
 cocoa-nut tree — from the window of the cottage. The sweet 
 wild note of the mocking-bird was awakened in its turn ; and 
 from the depths of the tangled woods, where it might defy the 
 human eye and hand, it sent forth its strain, shrill as the thrush, 
 more various than the nightingale, and sweeter than the canary. 
 But for the bird, the Spanish painter, Azua, would have sup- 
 posed that all this music was the method of reception of the 
 family by the peasantry; but, on expressing his surprise to 
 Aimee, she answered that song was as natural to St. Domingo, 
 when freed, as the light of sun or stars, when there were no 
 clouds in the sky. The heart of the negro was, she said, as 
 naturally charged with music as his native air with fragrance. 
 If you dam up his mountain streams, you have, instead of

 fragrance, poison and pestilence ; and if you chain up the negro's 
 life in slavery, you have, for music, wailing and curses. Give 
 both free course, and you have an atmosphere of spicy odours, 
 and a universal spirit of song. 
 
 "This last," said Azua, "is as one long, but varied ode in 
 honour of your father. Men of some countries would watch him 
 as a magician, after seeing the wonders he has wrought. Who, 
 looking over this wide level, on which plenty seems to have 
 emptied her horn, would believe how lately and how thoroughly 
 it was ravaged by war ? " 
 
 " There seems to be magic in all that is made," said Aimde ; 
 " so tliat all are magicians who have learned to draw it forth. 
 M. Loisir was showing us yesterday how the lightning may now 
 be brought down from the thunder-cloud, and carried into the 
 earth at some given spot. Our servants, who have yearly seen 
 the thunder-bolt fire the cottage or the mill, tremble, and call 
 the lightning-rods magic. My father is a magician of the same 
 sort, except that he deals with a deeper and higher magic." 
 
 " That which lies in men's hearts — in human passions." 
 
 " In human affections ; by which he thinks more in the end is 
 done than by their passions." 
 
 " Did you learn this from himseM P " asked Azua, who listened 
 with much surprise and curiosity to this explanation from the 
 girl by whose side he rode. " Does your father explain to you 
 his views of men, and his purposes with regard to them p " 
 
 " There is no need," she replied. " From the books he has 
 always read, we know what he thinks of men's minds and ways : 
 and from what happens, we learn his purposes ; for my father 
 always fulfils his purposes." 
 
 "And who led you to study his books, and observe his 
 purposes ? " 
 
 ** My brother Isaac." 
 
 " One of those who is studying at Paris P Does he make you 
 study here, while he is being educated there P " 
 
 " No ; he does not make me study. But I know what he is 
 
 doing 1 have books Isaac and I were always companions 
 
 He learns from me what my father does But I was 
 
 going to tell you, when you began asking about my father, that 
 this plain will not appear to you throughout so, flourishing as it 
 does now, from the road. When we reach the Etoile estate, you 
 will see enough of the ravages of war." 
 
 " I have perceived some signs of desertion in a house or two 
 that we have passed," said Azua. " But these brothers of yours 
 — ^when will they return P " 
 
 " Indeed I wish I knew," sighed Aimee. " I believe that 
 depends on the First Consul." 
 
 " The First Consul has so much to do, it is a pity their return

 should depend upon his memory. If he should forget, you will 
 go and see Paris, and bring your brothers home." 
 
 " The Pirst Consul forgets nothing," replied Aim^e. " He 
 knows and heeds all that we do here, at the distance of almost 
 half the world. He never forgets my brothers : he is Tery kind 
 to them." 
 
 " All that you say is true," said Yincent, who was now on the 
 other side of Aimee. " Everything that you can say in praise 
 of the First Consul is true. But yet you should go and see Paris. 
 You do not know what Paris is — you do not know what your 
 brothers are like in Paris — especially Isaac. He tells you, no 
 doubt, how happy he is there P " 
 
 " He does ; but I had rather see him here." 
 
 " Tou have fine scenery here, no doubt, and a climate which 
 you enjoy : but there ! what streets and palaces — what theatres 
 — what libraries and picture-galleries — and what society ! " 
 
 " Is it not true, however," said Azua, " that all the world is 
 alike to her where her brother is ? " 
 
 " This is L'Etoile," said Aimee. " Of all the country houses 
 in the island, this was, not perhaps the grandest, but the most 
 beautiful. It is now ruined ; but we hear that enough remains 
 for M. Loisir to make out the design." 
 
 She turned to Vincent, and told him that General Christophe 
 was about to build a house ; and that he wished it to be on the 
 model of L'EtoUe, as it was before the war. M. Loisir was to 
 furnish the design. 
 
 The Europeans of the party were glad to be told that they 
 had nearly arrived at their resting place ; for they could scarcely 
 sit their horses, whUe toiling in the heat through the deep sand 
 of the road. They had left far behind them both wood and 
 swamp ; and, though the mansion seemed to be embowered in 
 the green shade, they had to cross open ground to reach it. At 
 length Azua, who had sunk into a despairing silence, cried out 
 with animation — 
 
 " Ha ! the opuntia ! what a fence ! what a wall ! " 
 
 "Tou may Know every deserted house in the plain," said 
 Aimee, " by the cactus hedge round it." 
 
 "What ornament can the inhabited mansion have more 
 graceful, more beautiful P " said Azua, forgetting the heat in his 
 admiration of the blossoms, some red, some snow-white, some 
 blush-coloured, which were scattered in profusion over the thick 
 and high cactus hedge which barred the path. 
 
 " Nothing can be more beautiful," said Aimee, " but nothing 
 more inconvenient. See, you are setting your horse's feet into a 
 trap." And she pointed to the stiff, prickly green shoots which 
 matted all the ground. " We must approach by some other way. 
 Let us wait till the servants have gone round."

AT L'ETOILE. 125 
 
 With the servants appeared a tall and veiy handsome npgro, 
 well known throughout the island for his defence of the Etoile 
 estate against Rigaud. Charles Bellair was a Congo chief, 
 kidnapped in his youth, and brought into St. Domingo slavery; 
 in which state he had remained long enough to keep all his 
 detestation for slavery, without losing his fitness for freedom. 
 He might have returned, ere this, to Africa, or he might have 
 held some military ofiBce under Toussaint; but he preferred 
 remaining on the estate which he had partly saved from 
 devastation, bringing up his little children to revere and 
 enthusiastically obey the Commander-in-chief — the idol of 
 their colour. The heir of the ll^toile estate did not appear, nor 
 transmit his claim. Bellair, therefore, and two of ms former 
 fellow bondsmen, cultivated the estate, paying over the fixed 
 proportion of the produce to the public funds. 
 
 Bellair hastened to lead Madame L'Ouverture's horse round 
 to the other side of the house, where no prickly vegetation was 
 allowed to encroach. His wife was at work and singing to her 
 child under the shadow of the colonnade — once an erection of 
 great beauty, but now blackened by fire, and at one end 
 crumbling into ruins. 
 
 " Minerve ! " cried Madame, on seeing her. 
 
 " Deesha is her name," said Bellair, smiling. 
 
 " Oh, you call her by her native name ! Would we all knew 
 our African names, as you know hers ! Deesha ! " 
 
 Deesha hastened forward, all joy and pride at being the 
 hostess of the Ouverture family. Eagerly she led the way into 
 the inhabited part of the abode — a corner of the palace-like 
 mansion— a corner well covered in from the weather, and 
 presenting a strange contrast of simplicity and luxmy. 
 
 The courtyard through which they passed was strewed with 
 ruins, which, however, were almost entirely concealed by the 
 brushwood, through which only a lane was kept cleared for going 
 in and out. The whole was shaded, almost as with an awning, 
 by the shrubs which grew from the cornices, and among the 
 rafters which had remained where the roof once was. Ropes of 
 creepers hung down the wall, so twisted, and of so long a growth, 
 that Denis had climbed half-way up the building by means of 
 this natural ladder, when he was called back again. The jalousies 
 were decayed — starting away from their hinges, or hanging in 
 fragments; while the window-sills were gay with flowering 
 weeds, whose seeds even took root in the joints of the flooring 
 within, open as it was to the air and the dew. The marble steps 
 and entrance-hall were kept clear of weeds and dirt, and had a 
 strange air of splendour in the midst of the desolation. The 
 gilding of the balustrades of the hall was tarnished ; and it had 
 no furniture but the tatters of some portraits, whose frame and

 substance had been nearly devoured by ants ; but it was weather- 
 tight and clean. The saloon to the right constituted the family 
 dwelling. Part of its roof had been repaired with a thatch of 
 palm-leaves, which formed a singular junction with the portion 
 of the ceiling which remained, and which exhibited a blue sky- 
 
 f round, with gUt stars. An alcove had been turned into the 
 replace, necessary fra cooking. The kitchen comer was parti- 
 tioned off from the sitting-room by a splendid folding screen of 
 Oriental workmanship, exhibiting birds-of-paradise, and the blue 
 rivers and gilt pagodas of China. The other partitions were the 
 work of Bellair's own hands, woven of bamboo and long grass, 
 dyed with the vegetable dyes, with whose mysteries he was, like 
 a true African, acquainted. The dinner-table was a marble slab, 
 which still remained cramped to the wall, as when it had been 
 covered with plate, or with ladies' work-boxes. The seats were 
 benches, hewn by Bellair's axe. On the shelves and dresser of 
 unpainted wood were ranged together porcelain dishes from 
 Dresden, and calabashes from the garden ; wooden spoons, and 
 knives with enamelled handles. A harp, with its strings broken, 
 and its gilding tarnished, stood in one corner; and musical 
 instruments of Congo origin hung against the wall. It was 
 altogether a curious medley of European and African civilisation, 
 brought together amidst the ruius of a West Indian revolution. 
 
 The young people did not remain long in the house, however 
 tempting its coolness might have appeared. At one side of the 
 mansion was the colonnade, which engrossed the architect's 
 attention ; on the other bloomed the garden, oflering temptations 
 which none could resist — least of all those who were lovers. 
 Moyse and his Genifrede stepped first to the door which looked 
 out upon the wilderness of flowers, and were soon lost sight of 
 among the shrubs. 
 
 Genifrede had her sketch-book in her hand. She and her 
 sister wore here partly for the sake of a drawing lesson from 
 Azua ; and perhaps she had some idea of taking a sketch during 
 this walk with Moyse. He snatched the book from her, how- 
 ever, and flung it through the window of a garden-house which 
 they passed, saying — 
 
 " You can draw while I am away. For this hour you are all 
 my own." 
 
 " And when wiU you be away ? Wherever you go, I will 
 follow you. If we once part, we shall not meet again." 
 
 " We think so, and we say so, each time that we part ; and 
 yet we meet agaiu. Once more, only the one time when I am 
 to distinguish myself, to gain you — only that once will we be 
 parted ; and then we wUl be happy for ever." 
 
 " Then you will be killed— or you will be sent to France, or 
 you wUl love some one eUe and forget me "

PASSIONATE VOWS. 127 
 
 " Forget you ! — love some one else ! Oh ! Heaven and 
 earth ! " cried Moyse, clasping her in his avras, and putting his 
 whole soul into the kisses he impressed on her forehead. " And 
 what," he continued, in a voice which thrilled her heart, '' what 
 would you do if I were killed P " 
 
 " I would die. Oh, Moyse ! if it should be so, wait for me ! 
 Let your spirit wait for mine ! It shall not be long." 
 
 " Shall my spirit come— shall I come as a ghost, to tell you 
 that I am dead? Shall I come when you are alone, and call you 
 away ? " 
 
 " Oh ! no, no ! " she cried, shuddering. " I wiU follow — you 
 need not fear. But a ghost— oh ! no, no ! " And she looked up 
 at him, and clasped him closer. 
 
 " And why ? " said Moyse. " Tou do not fear me now— you 
 cling to me. And why fear me then ? I shall be yours stiU. 
 I shall be Moyse. I shall be about you, haimting you, whether 
 you see and hear me or not. Why not see and hear me ? " 
 
 " Why not P " said G^nifr^de, in a tone of assent. " But I 
 dare not — I will not. Tou shall not die. Do not speak of it." 
 
 " It was not I, but you, love, that spoke of it. Well, I will 
 not die. But tell me — if I forget you — if I love another — 
 what then P " And he looked upon her with eyes so full of love, 
 that she laughed, and withdrew herself from his arms, saying, 
 as she sauntered on along the blossom-strewn path — 
 
 " Then I will forget you too." 
 
 Moyse lingered for a moment, to wa^ch her stately form, as 
 she made a pathway for herself amidst the tangled shrubs. The 
 walk, once a smooth-shaven turf, kept green by trenches of water, 
 was now overgrown with the vegetation which encroached on 
 either hand. As the dark beauty forced her way, the maypole - 
 aloe shook its yellow crown of flowers, many feet above her 
 head ; the lilac jessamine danced before her face ; and the white 
 datura, the pink flower-fence, and the scarlet cordia, closed round 
 her form, or spread themselves beueath her feet. Her lover was 
 soon again by her side, warding ofB every branch and spray, and 
 saying— 
 
 " The very flowers worship you : but they and all — all must 
 yield you to me. Tou are mine ; and yet not mine till I have 
 won you from your father. Genifrede, how shall I distinguish 
 myself ? Show me the way, and I shall succeed." 
 
 " Do not ask me," she replied, sighing. 
 
 " Nay, whom should I ask ? " 
 
 " I never desired you to distinguish yourself." 
 
 " Tou do not wish it ? " 
 
 "No." 
 
 " Not for your sake p " 
 
 "Nq."

128 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 And she looked around her with wistful eyes, in which her 
 lover read a wish that things would ever remain as they were 
 now— that this moment would never pass away. 
 
 " You would remain here — you would hide yourself here with 
 me for ever ! " cried the happy Moyse. 
 
 " Here, or anywhere ; — in the cottage at Breda ; — in your 
 father's hut on the shore; — anywhere, Moyse, where there ia 
 nothing to dread. I live in fear ; and I am wretched," 
 
 " "What is it that you fear, love ? Why do you not trust me 
 to protect you p " 
 
 " Then I fear for you, which is worse. Why cannot we live in 
 the woods or the mountains, where there would be no dangerous 
 duties, and no cares ? " 
 
 " And if we lived in the woods, you would be more terrified 
 still. There would never be a falling star, but your heart would 
 sink. Tou would take the voices of the winds for the spirits of 
 the woods, and the mountain mists for ghosts. Then, there are 
 the tornado and the thunderbolt. When you saw the trees 
 crashing, you would be for making haste back to the plain. 
 Whenever you heard the rock rolling and bounding down the 
 steep, or the cataract rising and roaring in the midst of the 
 tempest, you would entreat me to fly to the city. It is in this 
 little beating heart that the fear lies." 
 
 " What then is to be done ? " 
 
 " This little heart must beat yet a while longer j and then, 
 when I have once come back, it shall rest upon mine for ever." 
 
 "Beside my father p He never rests. Tour father would 
 leave us in peace ; but he has committed you to one who knows 
 not what rest is." 
 
 " Nor ever wUl," said Moyse. " If he closed his eyes, if he 
 relaxed his hand, we should all be sunk in ruin." 
 
 " We P Who ? What ruin P " 
 
 " The whole negro race. Do you suppose the whites are less 
 cruel than they were P Do you believe that their thirst for our 
 humiliation, our slavery, is quenched ? Do you believe that the 
 white man's heart is softened by the generosity and forgiveness 
 of the blacks?" 
 
 "My father believes so," replied Genifrede; "and do they 
 not adore him— the whites whom he has reinstated ? Do they 
 not know that they owe to him their lives, their homes, the 
 prosperity of the island P Does he not trust the whites P Does 
 he not order all things for their good, from reverence and affec- 
 tion for them P " 
 
 " Tes, he does," replied Moyse, in a tone which made G6ni- 
 f rede anxiously explore his countenance. 
 
 " Tou think him deceived p " she said. 
 
 " No, I do not. It is not easy to deceive L'Ouverture,"

 " No. L'Ouverture deceives no one. As you say, he reveres 
 the whites. He reveres them for their knowledge. He says 
 they are masters of an intellectual kingdom from which we have 
 been shut out, and they alone can let us in. And then again, 
 
 GenifrSde, it seems to me that he loves hest those who have 
 
 most injured mm." 
 
 _" Not best," she replied. " He delights to forgive : but what 
 white has he ever loved as he loves Henri P Did he ever look 
 upon any white as he looked upon me, when ^when he con- 
 sented P Moyse, you remember ? " 
 
 " I do. But stiQ he loves the whites as if they were born, 
 and had lived and died, our friends, as he desires they should be. 
 Yet more — he expects and requires that all his race should love 
 them too." 
 
 "And you do not ? " said Genifrede, timidly. 
 
 " I abhor them." 
 
 " Oh ! hush ! hush ! Speak lower. Does my father know 
 thisP" 
 
 " Why should he P If he once knew it " 
 
 " Nay, if he knew it, he would give up his purposes of dis- 
 tinction for you ; and we might live here, or on the shore." 
 
 " My Genifrede, though I hate the whites, I love the blacks. 
 I love your father. The whites will rise upon us at home, as 
 they are always scheming against us in Prance, if we are not 
 strong — and as watchful as we are strong. If I and others leave 
 L'Ouverture alone to govern, and betake ourselves to the woods 
 and the mountains, the whites will again be masters, and you and 
 I, my Genifrede, shall be slaves. But you shall not be a slave, 
 Genifrede," he continued, soothing her tremblings at the idea. 
 " The bones of the whites shaU be scattered over the island, like 
 the shells on the sea-shore, before my Genifrede shall be a slavei. 
 I wlU cut the throat of every infant at every white mother's 
 breast, before any one of that race shall lay his grasp upon you. 
 The whites never wUl, never shaU again, be masters : but then, 
 it must be by L'Ouverture having an army always at his com- 
 mand ; and of that army I must be one of the officers. We 
 cannot live here, or on the sea-shore, love, while there are whites 
 who may be our masters. So, while I am away, you must pray 
 Christ to humble the whites. Will you ? This is all you can 
 do. Will you not ? " 
 
 " How can I, when my father is always exalting them ? " 
 
 " Tou must choose between him and me. Love the whites 
 with him, or hate them with me." 
 
 " But you love my father, Moyse P " 
 
 " I do. I adore him as the saviour of the blacks. You adore

 him, Genifrede. ETery one of our race worships him. GInifrede, 
 you love him — ^your father." 
 
 " I know not Yes, I loved Mm the other day. I know not, 
 
 Moyse. I know nothing but that 1 will hate the whites as 
 
 you do. I never loved them : now I hate them." 
 
 "Tou shall. I will tell you things of them that wiU make 
 you curse them. I know every white man's heart." 
 
 " Then tell my father." 
 
 " Does he not know enough already ? Is not his cheek 
 furrowed with the marks of the years during which the whites 
 were masters ; and is there any cruelty, any subtlety, in them 
 that he does not understand ? Knowing all this, he curses, not 
 them, but the power which, he says, corrupted them. He keeps 
 from them this power, and believes that all will be well. I shall 
 tell him nothing." 
 
 " Yes, tell him all — all except " 
 
 " Yes, and tell me first," cried a voice near at nana. tThere 
 was a great rustling among the bushes, and Denis appeared, 
 begging particularly to know what they were talking about. 
 They, in return, begged to be told what brought him this way, 
 to interrupt their conversation. 
 
 " Deesha says Juste is out after wild-fowl, and, most likely, 
 among some of the ponds hereabouts." 
 
 " One would think you had lived in Cap all your days," said 
 Moyse. " Do you look for wild-fowl in a garden ? " 
 
 " We will see presently," said the boy, thrusting himself into 
 the thicket in the direction of the ponds, and guiding himself 
 by the scent of the blossoming reeds — so peculiar as to be known 
 among the many with which the air was filled. He presently 
 beckoned to his sister ; and she followed with Moyse, till they 
 found themselves in the field where there had once been several 
 fish-ponds, preserved in order with great care. All were now 
 dried up but two ; and the whole of the water being diverted to 
 the service of these two, they were considerable in extent and 
 in depth. What the extent reaUy was, it was difficult to ascertain 
 at the first glance, so hidden was the margin with reeds, populous 
 with wUd-fowJ. 
 
 Denis was earnestly watching these fowl, as he lay among the 
 high grass at some little distance from the water, and prevented 
 his companions from approaching any nearer. The sun was 
 hot, and Genifrede was not long in desiring to return to the 
 garden. 
 
 " Let us go back,'' said she. " Juste is not here." 
 
 " Yes he is," said Denis. " However, go back if you like. 
 I shall go fowling with Juste." And he began to strip ofE his 
 clothes. 
 
 His companions were of opinion, however, that a son of the

NIGGER SPOST. I3I 
 
 Oommander-in-ohief must not sport with a farmer's boy, without 
 leave of parents or tutor ; and they begged him to put on his 
 clothes again, at least till leave was asEed. Denis had never 
 cared for his rank, except when riding by his father's side on 
 review-days ; and now he liked it less than ever, as the pond 
 lay gleaming before him, the fowl sailing and fluttering on the 
 surface, and his dignity prevented his going among them. 
 
 " What makes you say that Juste is here ? " said G&ifrede. 
 
 " I have seen him take five fowl iu the last five minutes." 
 
 As he spoke, he plucked the top of a bulrush, and threw it 
 with such good aim, that it struck a calabash which appeared to 
 be floating among others on the surface of the pond. That par- 
 ticular calabash immediately rose, and the face of a negro child 
 appeared, to the consternation of the fowl, whose splashing and 
 screaming might be heard far and wide. Juste came out of the 
 water, displaying at his belt the result of his sport. He had, as 
 Denis had said, taken five ducks in five minutes by pulling them 
 under the water by the feet, while lying near them with his head 
 covered by the calabash. The little fellow was not satisfied 
 with the admiration of the beholders ; he ran homewards, with 
 his clothes in his hand, Denis at his heels, and his game dangling 
 from his waist, and dripping as he ran. 
 
 " Many a white would shudder to see that child," said Moyse, 
 as Juste disappeared. "That is the way Jean's blacks wore 
 their trophies during the first days of the insurrection." 
 
 "Trophies!" said Gdnifrede. "Tou mean heads : heads with 
 their trailing hair " ■ and her face worked with horror as she 
 spoke. "But it is not for the whites to shudder, after what they 
 did to Oge, and have done to many a negro since." 
 
 "But they think we do not feel as they do." 
 
 " Not feel ! O Christ ! If any one of them had my heart before 
 I knew you — in those days at Breda, when M. Bayou used to 
 come down to us ! " 
 
 " Here comes that boy again," cried Moyse. " Let us go into 
 the thicket, among the citrons." 
 
 Denis found them, however — found Moyse gathering the 
 white and purple blossoms for Genifrede, while she was select- 
 ing the fruit of most fragrant rind from the same tree, to carry 
 into the house. 
 
 " Tou must come in — you must come to dinner," cried Denis. 
 " Aimde has had a drawing lesson, while you have been doing 
 nothing all this while. They said you were sketching; but I 
 told them how idle you were." 
 
 " I will go back with Denis," said G&ifrede. " Tou threw 
 away my sketch-book, Moyse. Tou may find it, and follow 
 us." 
 
 ' Their path lay together as far as the garden-house. When

 there, Moyse seized Denis unawares, shot him through the ■win- 
 dow into the house, and left him to get out as he might, and 
 bring the book. The boy was so long in returning, that his 
 sister became uneasy, lest some snake or other creature should 
 haTe detained him in combat. She was going to leave the table 
 in search of him, because Moyse would not, when he appeared, 
 singing, and with the book upon his head. 
 
 " Who calls Grdnifrede idle ? " cried he, flourishing the book. 
 " Look here ! " And he exhibited a capital sketch of herself and 
 Moyse, as he had found them, gathering fruits and flowers. 
 
 " Can it be his own ? " whispered G^nifrede to her lover. 
 
 Denis nodded and laughed, while Azua gravely criticised and 
 approved, without suspicion that the sketch was by no pupil of 
 his own. 
 
 In the cool evening, Gf^nifrede was reaUy no longer idle. 
 While Denis and Juste were at play, they both at once stum- 
 bled and feU over something in the long grass, which proved 
 to be a marble statue of a Naiad, lying at length. Moyse 
 seized it, and raised it where it was relieved by a dark green 
 back-ground. The artist declared it an opportunity for a 
 lesson which was not to be lost : and the girls began to draw, 
 as well as they could for the attempts of the boys to restore the 
 broken urn to the arm from which it had fallen. When Denis 
 and Juste found that they could not succeed, and were only 
 chidden for being in the way, they left the drawing party seated 
 under their clump of cocoa-nut trees, and went to hear what 
 Madame was relating to BeUair and Deesha, in the hearing of 
 M. MoHere, Laxabon, and Vincent. Her narration was one 
 which Denis had often heard, but was never tired of listening to. 
 She was telling of the royal descent of her husband — ^how he 
 was grandson of Gaou Guinou, the king of the African tribe 
 of Arrudos : how this king's second son was taken in battle, 
 and sold, with other prisoners of war, into slavery: how he 
 married an African girl on the Breda estate, and used to talk of 
 home and its wars, and its haunts, and its sunshine idleness — 
 how he used thus to talk in the evenings, "and on Sundays, to 
 the boy upon Ms knee ; so that Toussaint felt, from his infancy, 
 like an African, and the descendant of chiefs. This was a 
 theme which Madame L'Ouverture loved to dwell on, and espe- 
 cially when listened to as now. The Congo chief and his wife 
 hung upon her words, and told in their turn how their youth 
 had been spent at home— how they had been kidnapped, and 
 delivered over to the whites. In the eagerness of their talk, 
 they were perpetually falling unconsciously into the use of their 
 negro language, and as often recalled by their hearers to that 
 which aU could understand. Moliere and Laxabon listened 
 earnestly ; and even Loisir, occupied as he was still with the

 architecture of the mansion, found himself impatient if he lost a 
 word of the story. Vincent alone,negro as he was, was careless and 
 unmoTed. He presently sauntered away, and nobody missed him. 
 
 He looked over the shoulder of the architect. 
 
 " What pains you are taking ! " he said. " Tou have only to 
 follow your own fancy and convenience about Christopne's 
 house. Ohristophe has never been to France. Tell him, or any 
 others of my countrymen, that any building you choose to put 
 up is European, and in good taste, and they will be quite pleased 
 enough." 
 
 " You are a sinner," said Loisir ; " but bo quiet now." 
 
 "Nay — do not you find the blacks one and all ready to devour 
 your travellers' tales — your prodigious reports of European 
 cities ? Tou have only to tell Uke stories in stone and brick, and 
 they will believe you just as thankfully." 
 
 " No, no, Vincent. 1 have told no talcs so wicked as you tell 
 of your own race. My travellers' tales are all very well to pass 
 an hour, and be forgotten ; but Christophe's mansion is to stand 
 tor an age — to stand as the first evidence, in the department of 
 the arts, of the elevation of your race. Ohristophe knows, as 
 well as you do without having been to Paris, what is beautiful 
 in architecture ; and, if he did not, I would not treacherously 
 mislead him." 
 
 " Ohristophe knows ! Ohristophe has taste ! " 
 
 " Tes. While you have been walking streets and squares, he 
 has been studying the aisles of palms, and the crypts of the 
 banyan, which, to an open eye, may teach as much as a preju- 
 diced mind can learn in all Bome." 
 
 " So Loisir is of those who flatter men in power P " said 
 Vincent, laughing. 
 
 "I look further," said Loisir; "lam working for men unborn. 
 I am ambitious ; but my ambition is to connect my name honour- 
 ably with the first great house built for a negro general. My 
 umbition is to build here a rival to the palaces of Europe." 
 
 "Do what you will, you will not rival your own tales of 
 them — unless you find Aladdin's lamp among these ruins." 
 
 " If you find it, you may bring it me. Azua has found some- 
 thing half as good — a really fine statue in the grass." 
 
 Vincent was off to see it. He found the drawing party more 
 eager in conversation than about their work. Aimee was saying 
 as he approached— 
 
 " General Vincent declares that he is as affectionate to us as 
 if we were the nearest to him of all the children of the empire. 
 — Did you not say so ? " she asked, eagerly. "Is not the First 
 Consul's friendship for us real and earnest ? Does he not feel a 
 warm regard for my father P Is he not like a father to my 
 brothers?"

 " Certainly," said Vincent. " Do not your brothers confirm 
 this in their letters P " 
 
 " Do they not, Genifrede ? " repeated Aimee. 
 
 " They do ; but we see that they speak as they think : not as 
 things really are." 
 
 " How can you so despise the testimony of those who see what 
 we only hear of P " 
 
 " I do not despise them or their testimony. I honour their 
 hearts, which forget injuries, and open to kindness. But they 
 are young ; they went from keeping cattle, and from witnessing 
 the desolations of war here, to the first city of the world, where 
 the first men lavish upon them instructions, and pleasures, and 
 flatteries ; and they are pleased. The greatest of aU — the First 
 of the "Whites, smiles upon the sons of the First of the Blacks ; 
 and their hearts beat with enthusiasm for him. It is natural. 
 But, while they are in Paris, we are in St. Domingo ; and we 
 may easily view affairs, and judge men differently." 
 
 " And so," said Aimee, " distrust our best ft-iends, and despise 
 our best instructors ; and all from a jealousy of race ! " 
 
 " We think the jealousy of race is with them," said Moyse, 
 bitterly. " There is not a measure of L'Ouverture's which they 
 do not neutralise — not a fragment of authority which they will 
 yield. As to friends, if the Consul Bonaparte is our best friend 
 among the Whites, may we be left thus far friendless ! " 
 
 "You mean that he has not answered my father's letters. 
 M. Vincent doubts not that an answer is on the way. Remember, 
 my brothers have been invited to his table." 
 
 "There are blacks in Paris, who look on," replied Moyse, 
 drUy. 
 
 " And are there not whites too, from this island, who watch 
 every movement P " 
 
 " Tes : and those whites are in the private closet, at the very 
 ear of Bonaparte, whispering to him of L'Ouverture's ambition; 
 while your brothers penetrate no further than the saloon." 
 
 " My brothers would lay down their lives for Bonaparte and 
 France," said Aimee ; " and you speak treason. I am with them." 
 
 " And with me," said Vincent, in a whisper at her ear. 
 " Where I find the loyal heart in woman, mine is ever loyal 
 too." 
 
 Aim^e was too much excited to understand in this what was 
 meant. She went on — 
 
 " Here is M. Vincent, of our own race, who has lived here 
 and at Paris — who has loved my father. — You love my father 
 and his government ? " she said, with questioning eyes, inter- 
 rupting herself. 
 
 " Certainly. No man is more devoted to L'Onverture." 
 
 " Devoted to my father," pursued Aimee, " and yet devoted

 to Bonaparte. He is above the rivalry of races — as the First 
 Consul is, and as Isaac is." 
 
 " Isaac and the First Consul — these are the idols of Aimde's 
 worship/'said G&ifr^de. "Worship Isaac still; for that is a 
 harmless idolatry ; but give up your new religion, Aimee ; for it 
 is not sound." 
 
 " Why not sound ? How do you know that it is not sound P" 
 
 " When have the blacks ever trusted the whites without find- 
 ing themselves bound victims in the end ? " 
 
 " I have," said Vincent. " I have lived among them a life of 
 charms, and I am free," he continued, stretching his arms to 
 the air — "free to embrace the knees of both Bonaparte and 
 L'Ouverture— free to embrace the world." 
 
 " The end has not come yet," said Moyse. 
 
 " What end ? " asked Aimde. 
 
 " Nay, God knows what end, if we trust the French.'' 
 
 " Tou speak from prejudice," said Aimee. " M. Vincent and 
 my brothers judge from facts." 
 
 " We speak from facts," said Genifrede ; " from, let us see — 
 from seven — no, eight, very ugly facts." 
 
 " The eight Commissaries that the colony has been blessed 
 with," said Moyse. " If they had taken that monkey which is 
 looking down at your drawing-, Aimee, and seven of its brethren, 
 and installed them at Cap, they would have done us all the good 
 the Commissaries have done, and far less mischief. The monkeys 
 would have broken the mirrors, and made a hubbub within the 
 walls of Government-house. These Oommissai-ies, one after 
 another, from Mirbeck to HddouviUe, have insulted the colony, 
 and sown quarrels in it, from end to end." 
 
 " Mirbeck ! Here is Mirbeck," said Denis, who had come up 
 to listen. And the boy roUed himself about like a drunken man 
 — ^Uke Mirbeck, as he had seen him in the streets of Cap. 
 
 " Then they sent St. Leger, the Irishman," continued Moyse, 
 " who kept his hand in every man's pocket, whether black or 
 white." 
 
 Denis forthwith had his hands, one in Vincent's pocket, the 
 other in Aaua's. Azua, however, was drawing so fast that he 
 did not find it out. 
 
 " Then there was Roume." 
 
 " Roume. My father speaks well of Roume," said Aimde. 
 
 " He was amiable enough, but so weak that he soon had to go 
 home, where he was presently joined by his successor, Santhonax, 
 whom, yon know, L'Ouverture had to get rid of, for the safety of 
 the colony. Then came Polverel. What the tranquillity of St. 
 Domingo was in his day we all remember." 
 
 Denis took off Polverel, spying from his ship at the island, on 
 which he dared not land.

t$6 THb HOVR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " For shame, Denis ? " said Aim^e. " Tou are ridiculing him 
 who first called my father L'OuYerture.'' 
 
 " And do you suppose he knew the Tise that would be made of 
 the word ? " asked G^nif rMe. " If he had foreseen its being a 
 title, he would have contented himself with the obsequious bows 
 I remember so well, and never have spoken the word." 
 
 Denis was forthwith bowing, with might and main. 
 
 "Now, Denis, be quiet! Raymond, dear Raymond, came 
 next ; " and she looked up at Vincent as she praised his 
 friend. 
 
 " Raymond is excellent as a man, whatever he may be as 
 governor of O9.P," said Moyse. " But we have been speaking of 
 whites, not of mulattoes — which is another long chapter." 
 
 " Raymond was sent to us by l^ance, however," said Aimde. 
 
 " So was our friend Vincent there ; but that is nothing to the 
 purpose." 
 
 " Well ; who next P " cried Denis. 
 
 " Do not encourage him," said Aim&. " My father would be 
 vexed with you for training him to ridicule the French — ^par- 
 ticularly the authorities." 
 
 " Now we are blessed witli HddouviUe," pursued Moyse. 
 " There you have him, Denis — only scarcely sly, scarcely smooth 
 enough. Tet, that is Hddouville, who has his eye and his smiles 
 at play in one place, while his heart and hands are busy in 
 another." 
 
 "Busy," said Genifrede, "in undermining L'Ouverture's 
 influence, and counteracting his plans; but no one mentioned 
 AUhaud. AUhaud " 
 
 " Stay a moment," said Azua, whose voice had not been heard 
 till then. ' 
 
 All looked at him in surprise, nobody supposing that, while S(T 
 engrossed with his pencil, he could have cared for their conver- 
 sation. Aim& saw at a glance that his paper was covered with 
 earicatures of the commissaries who had been enumerated. 
 
 " Tou must have known them," was Aimle's involuntary tes- 
 timony, as the paper went from hand to hand, amidst shouts of 
 laughter, while Azua sat, with folded arms, perfectly grave. 
 
 " I have seen some of the gentlemen," said he, " and M. Denis 
 helped me to the rest." 
 
 The laughter went on till Aim^e was somewhat nettled. When 
 the paper came back to her, she looked up into the tree under 
 which she sat. The staring monkey was stiU there. She made 
 a vigorous spring to hand up the caricature, which the creature 
 caught. As it sat demurely on a branch, holding the paper as if 
 reading it, while one of its companions as gravely looked over its 
 shoulder, there was more laughter than ever. 
 
 " I beg your pardon, M. Azua," said Aimee ; " but this is the

 Only worthy fate of a piece of mockery of people wiser than 
 onrselves, and no less kind. The negroes have hitherto been 
 thought, at least, grateful. It seems that this is a mistake. For 
 my part, however, I leave it to the monkeys to ridicule the 
 French." 
 
 Vincent seized her hand, and covered it with kisses. She was 
 abashed, and turned away, when she saw her father behind her, 
 in the shade of the wood. M. Pascal, his secretary, was with 
 him. 
 
 " My father ! " " L'Ouverture ! " exclaimed one after another 
 of the party ; for they all supposed he had been far away. Even 
 Denis at once gave over pelting the monkeys, and left them to 
 their study of the arts in peace. 
 
 " Tour drawings, my daughters ! " said L'Ouverture, with a 
 smile, as if he had been perfectly at leisure. And he examined 
 the Naiad, and then Genif ride's drawing, with the attention of 
 an artist. Genifrede had made great progress, under the eye of 
 Moyse. Not so Aimee ; her pencil had been busy all the while, 
 but there was no Naiad on her page. 
 
 " They are for Isaac," she said, timidly. " Among all the 
 pictures he sees, there are no " 
 
 " No sketches of Denis and his little companions," said her 
 father ; " no cocoa-nut clumps — no broken fountains among the 
 aloes — no groups that will remind him of home. Isaac shall 
 presently have these, Aim^e. I am on my way to Cap, and will 
 send them." 
 
 " On your way to Cap ! " cried every one — some in a tone of 
 fear. 
 
 "To Cap," said he, "where Father Laxabon will foUow me 
 immediately, with M. Pascal. By them, Aimee, you wiU send 
 your packet for Isaac. My own horse is waiting." 
 
 " Do not go alone — do not go without good escort," said 
 Moyse. " I can give you reason." 
 
 " I know your thoughts, Moyse. I go for the very reason that 
 there are, or will be, troubles at Cap. — The French authorities 
 may sometimes decree and do that which we feel to be unwise — 
 unsuitable to the blacks," he continued, with an emphasis which 
 gave some idea of his having overheard more or less of the late 
 conversation ; " but we islanders may be more ignorant still of 
 the thoughts and ways of their practised race." 
 
 " But you are personally unsafe," persisted Moyse. " If you 
 knew what is said by the officers of Hedouville's stafE— — " 
 
 " They say," proceeded Toussaint, smiling, " that they only 
 want three or four brigands to seize the ape with the Madras 
 head-dress ; and then all would go well. These gentlemen are 
 mistaken ; and I am going to prove this to them. An armed 
 escort proves nothing. I carry something stronger still in my

 mind and on my tongue. General Vincent, a word with 
 
 you-" 
 
 While he and Vincent spoke apart, Aimee exclaimed, 
 
 " Oh, Moyse ! Go with my father ! " 
 
 " Do not — Oh, do not ! " cried Genifrede. " Tou wiU never 
 return ! " she muttered to him, in a roiee of terror. " Aimee, 
 yon would send him away : and my mother — all of us, are far 
 from home. Who knows but that Rigaud " 
 
 " Leave Rigaud to me," cried Vincent, gaily, as he rejoined 
 the party. " I undertake Rigaud. He shall never alarm you 
 more. Farewell, Mademoiselle Aimee ! I am going to the 
 south. Rigaud is recruiting in the name of France ; and I know 
 France too well to allow of that. I shall stop his recruiting, and 
 choke his blasphemy with a good French sword. Farewell, till 
 I bring you news at Pongaudin that you may ride along the 
 southern coast as securely as in your own cane-pieces." 
 
 " Tou are going P " said Aim&. 
 
 " This very hour. I south — L'Ouverture north " 
 
 " And the rest to Pongaudin with the dawn," said Toussaint. 
 
 " What is your pleasure concerning me ? " asked Moyse. " I 
 wait your orders." 
 
 " I remember my promise," said Toussaint ; " but I must not 
 leave my family unprotected. Tou wiU attend them to Pon- 
 gaudin : and then let me see you at Cap, with the speed of the 
 wind." 
 
 " With a speed like your own, if that be possible," said 
 Moyse. 
 
 "Is there danger, father P " asked G^nifrfide, trembling. 
 
 " My child, there is danger in the air we breathe, and the 
 ground we tread on : but there is protection also, everywhere." 
 
 " Tou win see Afra, father," said Aim^e. " If there is danger, 
 what will become of Afra P Her father will be in the front, in 
 any disturbance : and Government-house is far from being the 
 safest place." 
 
 " I will not forget Afra. Farewell, my children ! Go now to 
 your mother ; and, before this hour to-morrow, I shall think of 
 you resting at Pongaudin." 
 
 They saw him mount before the courtyard, and set off, fol- 
 lowed by one of his two trompettes — the only horsemen in the 
 island who could keep up with him, and therefore his constant 
 attendants in his most important journeys. The other was gone 
 forward, to order horses from post to post. 
 
 Viacent, having received written instructions from the secre- 
 tary, set off in an opposite direction, more gay than those he left 
 behind. 
 
 The loftiest trees of the rich plain were still touched with 
 golden light ; and the distant bay glittered so as to make the

 gazers turn away their eyes, to rest on the purple mountains to 
 the north : but their hearts were anxious ; and they saw neither 
 the glory nor the beauty of which they heard talk between the 
 painter, the architect, and their host. 
 
 CHAPTER XII. 
 
 A NIGHT OF OFFICE. 
 
 As soon as Toussaint was out of hearing of his family and 
 suite, he put his horse to its utmost speed. There was not a 
 moment to be lost, if the peace of the island was to be preserved. 
 Faster than ever fugitive escaped from trouble and danger, did 
 the negro commander rush towards them. The union between 
 the black and white races probably depended on his reachLag 
 Cap by the early morning — in time to prevent certain proclama- 
 tions of Hedouville, framed in ignorance of the state of the colony 
 and the people, from being published. Forty leagues lay between 
 L'Etoile and Cap, and two mountain ridges crossed his road : 
 but he had ridden forty leagues in a night before, and fifty in a 
 long day; and he thought little of the journey. As he rode, ho 
 meditated the work of the next day, while he kept his eye awake, 
 and his heart open, to the beauty of the night. 
 
 He had cleared the plain, with his trompette at his heels, 
 before the woods and fields had melted together into the purple 
 haze of evening; and the labourers returning from the cane- 
 pieces, with their tools on their shoulders, offered their homage 
 to him as he swept by. Some shouted, some ran beside him, 
 some kneeled in the road and blessed him, or asked his blessing. 
 He came to the river, and found the ford lined by a party of 
 negroes, who, having heard and known his horse's tread, above 
 the music of pipe and drum, had thrown themselves into the 
 water to point out the ford, and save his precious moments. He 
 dashed through uncovered, and was lost in the twilight before 
 their greeting was done. The evening star was just bright 
 enough to show its image in the still salt-lake, when he met the 
 expected relay, on the verge of the mountain woods. Thence 
 the ascent was so steep, that he was obliged to relax his speed. 
 He had observed the birds winging home to these woods ; they 
 had reached it before him, and the chirp of their welcome to 
 their nests was sinking into silence; but the whirring beetles 
 were abroad. The frogs were scarcely heard from the marshes 
 below ; but the lizards and crickets vied with the young monkeys 
 in noise, while the wood was all alight with luminous insects.

140 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 Wherever a twisted fantastic cotton-tree, or a drooping wild fig, 
 stood out from the thicket and apart, it appeared to send forth 
 streams of green flame from eveiy branch; so incessantly did 
 the fire-flies radiate from every projecting twig. 
 
 As he ascended, the change was great. At length there was 
 no more sonnd ; there were no more flitting fires. Still as sleep 
 rose the mountain peaks to the night. Still as sleep lay the 
 woods below. Stiff as sleep was the outspread western sea, 
 silvered by the steady stars which shone, still as sleep, in the 
 purple depths of heaven. Such was the starlight on tliat pin- 
 nacle, so large and round the silver globes, so bright in the 
 transparent atmosphere were their arrowy rays, that the whole 
 vault was as one constellation of little moons, and the horse and 
 his rider saw their own shadows in the white sands of their path. 
 The ridge passed, down plunged the horseman, hurrying to the 
 valley and the plain ; like rocks loosened by the thunder from 
 the mountain top. The hunter, resting on the heights from his 
 day's chase of the wild goats, started from his sleep, to listen to 
 what he took for a threatening of storm. In a little while, the 
 child in the cottage in the valley nestled close to its mother, 
 scared at the flying tramp ; while the trembling mother herseK 
 prayed for the shield of the Virgin's grace against the night-fiends 
 that were abroad. Here, there was a solitary light in the plain ; 
 there, beside the river ; and yonder, behind the village ; and at 
 each of these stations were fresh horses, the best in the region, 
 and smiling faces to tender their use. The panting animals that 
 were left behind were caressed for the sake of the burden they 
 had carried, and of the few kind words dropped by their rider 
 during his momentary pause. 
 
 Thus was the plain beyond Mirbalais passed soon after mid- 
 night. In the dark the horsemen swam the Artibonite, and 
 leaped the sources of the Petite Riviere. The eastern sky was 
 beginning to brighten as they mounted the highest steeps above 
 Atalaye; and from the loftiest point, the features of the wide 
 landscape became distinct in the cool grey dawn. Toussaint 
 looked no longer at the fading stars. He looked eastwards, where 
 the green savannahs spread beyond the reach of human eye. He 
 looked northwards, where towns and villages lay in the skirts of 
 the mountains, and upon the verge of the rivers, and in the green 
 recesses where the springs burst from the MU-sides. He looked 
 westwards, where the broad and full Artibonite gushed into the 
 sea, and where the yeUow bays were thronged with shipping, 
 and every green promontory was occupied by its plantation or 
 fishing hamlet. He paused, for one instant, while he surveyed 
 what he well knew to be virtually his dominions. He said to 
 himself that with him it rested to keep out strife from this 
 paradise — to detect whatever devilish cunning might lurk in its

 by- comers, and rebuke whateTer malice and revenge might linger 
 within its bounds. With the thought he again sprang forward, 
 again plunged down the steeps, scudded over the wilds, and 
 splashed through the streams; not losing another moment tUl 
 his horse stood trembling and foaming under the hot sun, now 
 touching the Haut-du-Cap, where the riders had at length pulled 
 up. Here they had overtaken the first trompette, who, having 
 had no leader at whose heels he must follow, had been unable, 
 with all his zeal, quite to equal the speed of his companion. He 
 had used his best efforts, and showed signs of fatigue ; but yet 
 they had come upon his traces on the grass road from the Gros 
 Mome, and had overtaken him as he was toiUng up the Haut- 
 du-Cap. 
 
 Both waited for orders, their eyes fixed on their master's face, 
 as they saw him stand listening, and glancing his eye over the 
 city, the harbour, and the road from the Plain du Nord. He saw 
 afar signs of trouble : but he saw also that he was not too late. 
 He looked down into the gardens of Government-house. Was 
 it possible that he would show himself there, heated, breathless, 
 covered with dust as he was ? No. He dismounted, and gave 
 his horse to the trompettes, ordering them to go by the most 
 public way to the hotel, in Place Mont Archer, to give notice of 
 the approach of his secretary and staff; and thence to th« 
 barracks, where he would appear when he had bathed. 
 
 The trompettes would have gone round five weary miles for 
 the honour of carrying messages from the Commander-in-chief 
 through the principal streets of Cap. They departed with great 
 zeal, while Toussaint ascended to the mountain-pool, to take the 
 plunge in which he found his best refreshment alter a long ride. 
 He was presently walMng leisurely down the sloping field, 
 through which he could drop into the grounds of Government- 
 house by a back gate, and have his interview with Hedouville 
 before interruption came from the side of the town. As he 
 entered the gardens, he looked, to the wondering eyes he met 
 there, as if he had just risen from rest, to enjoy a morning walk 
 in the shrubberies. They were almost ready to understand, in 
 its literal sense, the expression of his worshippers, that he rode 
 at ease upon the clouds.

 CHAPTER XIII. 
 
 AN OLD MAN IN NEW DATS. 
 
 Befoeb the sun had touched the roofs of the town of Gap — 
 while the streets lay cool and grey under the heights, which 
 glowed in the flames of sunrise — most of the inhahitants were 
 up and stirring. Euphrosyne Revel was at her grandfather's 
 chamber-door ; first listening for his call, and then softly looking 
 in, to see whether he could still he sleeping. The door opened 
 and shut by a spring, so that the old man did not hear the little 
 girl as she entered, though his sleep was not sound. As Eu- 
 phrosyne saw how restless he was, and heard him mutter, she 
 thought she would rouse him : but she stayed her hand, as she 
 remembered that he might have slept ill, and might slUl settle 
 for another quiet doze, if left undisturbed. With a gentle hand 
 she opened one of the jalousies, to let in more air ; and she chose 
 one which was shaded by a tree outside, that no glare of light 
 might enter with the breeze. 
 
 What she saw from this window drew her irresistibly into the 
 balcony. It was a tree belonging to the convent which waved 
 before the window ; and below lay the convent garden, fresh 
 with the dews of the night. There stretched the green walks, 
 so glittering with diamond-drops and with the gossamer as to 
 show that no step had passed over them since dawn. There lay 
 the parterres — one crowded with geraniums of all hues ; another 
 with proud lilies, white, orange, and purale ; and another with a 
 flowering pomegranate in the centre, while the gigantic white and 
 blue convolvulus covered the soil all around, mixing with the 
 bright green leaves and crimson blossoms of the hybiscns. No 
 one seemed to be abroad, to enjoy the garden during this the 
 freshest hour of the day ; no one but the old black gardener, 
 Raphael, whose cracked voice might be heard at intervals from 
 the depths of the shrubbery in the opposite comer, singing 
 snatches of the hymns which the sisters sung in the chapel. 
 When his hoarse music ceased, the occasional snap of a bough, 
 and movements among the bushes, told that the old man was 
 still there, busy at his work. 
 
 Euphrosyne wished that he would come out, within sight of 
 the beckon of her hand. She dared not call, for fear of waken- 
 ing her grandfather: but she very much wanted a flowering 
 orange branch. A gay little humming-bird was sitting and 
 hovering near her ; and she thought that a bunch of fragrant 
 blossoms would entice it in a moment. The little creature came 
 and went, flew round the balcony and retired: and stiU old 
 Raphael kept out of sight behind the leafy screen.

EUPBROSYNE AND THE HUMMING BIRDS. I43 
 
 " It will be gone, pretty creature ! " said Euphrosyne to 
 herself; "and all for want of a single bougli from all those 
 thickets ! " 
 
 A thought struck her. Her morning frock was tied round 
 the waist with a cord, ha-s-ing tassels which hung down nearly 
 to her feet. She took off the cord, made a noose in it, and let 
 it down among the shrubs below, swinging the end this way 
 and that, as she thought best for catching some stray twig. 
 She pursued her aim for a time, sending showers of dew-drops 
 pattering down, and knocking off a good many blossoms, but 
 catching nothiug. She was so busy, that she did not see that a 
 grey-suited nun had come out, with a wicker cage in her hand, 
 and was watching her proceedings. 
 
 " What are you doing, my cMld P " asked the nun, approach- 
 ing, as a new shower of dew-drops and blossoms was shaken 
 abroad. " If you desire to iish, I doubt not our reverend mother 
 wiU make you welcome to our pond yonder." 
 
 " Oh, sister Christine ! I am glad you are come out," said 
 Buphrosyne, bending over the balcony, and speaking in a low, 
 though eager voice. " Do give me a branch of something sweet, 
 — orange, or citron, or something. This humming-bird will be 
 gone if we do not make haste — Hush ! Do not call. Grand- 
 papa is not awake yet. Please, make haste." 
 
 Sister Christine was not wont to make haste ; but she did her 
 best to gratify Euphrosyne. She went straight to the corner of 
 the shrubbery where the abbess's mpckiug-bird spent all its 
 summer days, hung up the cage, and brought back what Eu- 
 phrosyne had asked. The branch was drawn up in the noose 
 of the cord, and the nun could not but stand and watch the 
 event. 
 
 The bough was stuck between two of the bars of the jalousie, 
 and the gin. withdrew to the end of the balcony. The hum- 
 ming-bird appeared, hovered round, and at last inserted its 
 long beak in a blossom, sustaining itself the wlule on its quiver- 
 ing wings. Before proceeding to another blossom it flew away. 
 Euphrosyne cast a smile down to the nun, and placed herself 
 against the jalousie, holding the branch upon her head. As she 
 had hoped, two humming-birds returned. After some hesita- 
 tion, they came for more of their sweet food, and Euphrosyne 
 felt that her hair was blown about on her forehead by the motion 
 of their busy wings. She desired, above everything, to keep 
 still ; but this strong desire, and the sight of sister Christine's 
 grave face turned so eagerly upwards, made her laugh so as to 
 shaie the twigs very fearfully. E!eeping her hand with the 
 branch steady, she withdrew her head from beneath, and then 
 stole slowly and cautiously backward within the window — the 
 birds following. She now heard her grandfather's voice, calling

 feebly and fretfully. She half -turned to make a signal for silence, 
 which the old man so far observed as to sink his complaints to a 
 mutter. The girl put the branch into a water-jar near the win- 
 dow, and then stepped lightly to the bed. 
 
 "What is all this nonsense P" said M. Revel. "Why did 
 not you come the moment I called P " 
 
 " Here I am, grandpapa — and do look — ^look at my humming- 
 birds ! " 
 
 " Humming-birds — nonsense ! I called yon twice." 
 
 Yet the old gentleman rubbed his eyes, which did not seem 
 yet quite awake. He rubbed his eyes and looked through the 
 shaded room, as if to see Bnphrosyne's new plaything. She 
 brought him his spectacles from the toilette, helped to raise him 
 up, threw a shawl over his shoulders, and placed his pillows at 
 his back. Per'^eiving that he still could not see very distinctly, 
 she opened another blind, so as to let one level ray of sunshine 
 fall upon the water-jar, and the little radiant creatures that 
 were hovering about it. 
 
 " There ! there ! " cried M. Revel, in a pleased tone. 
 
 " Now I will go and bring you your coffee," said Euphrosyue. 
 
 " Stop, stop, child ! Why are you in such a hurry ? I want 
 to know what is the matter. Such a night as I have had ! " 
 
 " A bad night, grandpapa P I am sorry." 
 
 " Bad enough ! How came my light to go out ? And what 
 is aU this commotion in the streets P " 
 
 Euphrosyne went to the night-lamp, and found that a very 
 large flying beetle had disabled itself by breaking the glass, and 
 putting out the light. There it lay dead — a proof at least that 
 there were no ants in the room. 
 
 " SiUy thing ! " said Euphrosyue. " I do wish these beetles 
 would learn to fly properly. He must have startled you, grand- 
 papa. Did not you think it was a thief, when you were left in 
 the dark?" 
 
 " It is very odd that nobody about me can find me a lamp that 
 will serve me. And then, what is all this bustle in the town P 
 Tell me at once what is the matter." 
 
 " I know of nothing the matter. The trompettes have been 
 by this morning; and they say that the Commander-in-chief 
 is here : so there will be nothing the matter. There was some 
 talk last night, Pierre said — some fright about to-day. But 
 L'Onverture is come; and it will be all right now, you 
 know." 
 
 " You know nothing about it, child — ^teazing one with your 
 buzzing, worrying humming-birds I Go and get my coffee, and 
 send Pierre to me." 
 
 " The birds will come with me, I dare say, if I go by the bal- 
 cony. I will take them away."

"black upstarts. 145 
 
 " No, no. Don't lose time with them. Let them be. . Go 
 and send Pierre." 
 
 When Euphrosyne returned with the coffee, she fonnd, as 
 Pierre had found before her, M. Revel so engrossed in looking 
 through Ms spectacles at the water-jar, as to have forgotten what 
 he had to ask and to say. 
 
 " Ton will find the bath ready whenever you want it, grand- 
 papa," said Euphrosyne, as she placed the little tray before him : 
 " and it is a sweet airy morning." 
 
 "Ay; I must make haste up, and see what is to be done. 
 It is not safe to lie and rest in one's bed, in this part of the 
 world." And he made haste to stir his cofEee with his trembling 
 hands. 
 
 " Oh, yon have often said that — almost ever since I can re- 
 member : and here we are, quite safe still." 
 
 " Tell the truth, child. How dare you say that we have been 
 safe ever since you remember ? " 
 
 " I said ' almost,' grandpapa. I do not forget about our being 
 
 in the woods — about but we wiLL not talk of that now. That 
 
 was all over a long time ago ; and we have been very safe since. 
 The great thing of all is, that there was no L'Ouverture then, to 
 take care of us. Now, you know, the Oommander-in- chief is 
 always thinking how he can take the best care of us." 
 
 " ' No L'Ouverture then ! ' One would think you did not 
 know what and where Toussaint was then. Why, chUd, your 
 poor father was master over a hundred such as he." 
 
 " Do you think they were like him ? Surely, if they had been 
 like him, they would not have treated us as they did. Afra 
 says she does not believe anybody like him ever lived." 
 
 " Afra is a pestilent little fool." 
 
 " Oh, grandpapa ! " 
 
 " Well, well ! She is a very good girl in her way ; but she 
 talks about what she does not understand. She pretends to judge 
 of governors of the colony, when her own father cannot govern 
 this town, and she never knew Blanchelande ! Ah ! if she had 
 known Blanchelande, she would have seen a man who under- 
 stood his business, and had spirit to keep up the dignity and 
 honour of the colony. If that sort of rule had gone on till now, 
 we should not have had the best houses in the island full of these 
 black upstarts ; nor a mulatto governor in this very town." 
 
 " And then I should not have had Afra for a friend, grandpapa." 
 
 " You would have been better without, child. I do not like to 
 see you for ever with a girl of her complexion, though she is the 
 governor's daughter. There must be an end of it — ^there shall 
 be an end of it. It is a good time now. There is a reason for it 
 to-day. It is time you made friends of your own complexion, 
 child ; and into the convent you go — this very day."

146 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " Oh, grandpapa, you don't mean that those nnns are of my 
 compleKion ! Poor pale creatures ! I would not for the world 
 look like them : and I certainly shall, if you pot me there. I 
 had much rather look like Afra than like sister Benoite, or 
 sister Cecile. Grandpapa I you would not like me to look like 
 sister Benoite ? " 
 
 " How do I know, child ? I don't know one from another of 
 them." 
 
 " No, indeed ! and you would not know me by the time I had 
 been there three months. How sorry you would be, grandpapa, 
 when you asked for me next winter, to see all those yellow-faced 
 women pass before you, and when the yellowest of all came, to 
 haTe to say, ' Can this be my poor Euphrosyne ! ' " 
 
 M. Revel could not help laughing as he looked up at the girl 
 through his spectacles. He pinched her cheek, and said that 
 there was certainly more colour there than was common in the 
 West Indies ; but that it must fade, in or out of the convent, by 
 the time she was twenty ; and she had better be in a place where 
 she was safe. The convent was the only safe place. 
 
 "Tou have often said that before," replied she, "and the 
 time has never come yet. And no more it will now. I shall go 
 with Afra to the cacao-gathering at Le Zephyr, as I did last 
 year. Oh, that sweet cool place in the Momes du Chaos ! How 
 different from this great ugly square white convent, with nothing 
 that looks cheerful, and nothing to be heard but teaching, teach- 
 ing, and religion, religion, for ever." 
 
 ''I advise you to make friends among the sisters, how- 
 ever, Euphrosyne; for there you wiU spend the next few 
 years." 
 
 " I will not make friends with anything but the poor mocking- 
 bird. I have promised Afra not to love anybody instead of her j 
 but she will not be jealous of the poor bird. It and I will spend 
 the whole day in the thicket, mocking and pining — pining and 
 mocking. The sisters shall not get a word out of me — not one 
 of them. I may speak to old Raphael now and then, that I may 
 not forget how to use my tongue ; but I vow that poor bird shall 
 be my only friend." 
 
 " We shall see that. We shall see how long a giddy chUd 
 like you can keep her mocking-bird tone in the uproar that is 
 coming upon us ! What will you do, child, without me, when 
 the people of this colony are cutting one another's throats over 
 my grave ? What will become of you when I am gone ? " 
 
 "Dear grandpapa, before that comes the question. What wUl 
 you do without me ? What will become of you when I am gone 
 into that duU place ? Tou know very well, grandpapa, that you 
 cannot spare me." 
 
 The old man's frame was shaken with sobs. He put liis thin

THE URGENT MESSAGES. I47 
 
 hands before his face, and the tears trickled between Ms fingers. 
 Euphrosyne caressed him, saying, 
 
 " There ! I knew how it womd be. I knew I should never 
 leave you. I never will leave you. I will bring up your coffee 
 every morning, and light your lamp every night, as long as you 
 live." 
 
 As she happened to be looking towards the door, she saw it 
 opening a little upon its noiseless hinges, and a hand which she 
 knew to be Pierre's beckoning to her. Her grandfather did not 
 see it. She withdrew herself from him with a sportive kiss, 
 ordered him to rest for a while, and think of nothing but her 
 humming-birds, and carried the tray out of the room. 
 
 Pierre was there, waiting impatiently with a note from Afra. 
 
 "I did not bring it in, Mademoiselle," said he, "because I 
 am sure there is something amiss. A soldier brought the note ; 
 and he says he has orders to stay for my master's commands." 
 
 Afra's note told what this meant. It was as follows : — 
 
 " Dearest Ettpheosyne, 
 
 " Do not be frightened. There is time, if you come directly. 
 There is no danger, if you come to us. The cultivators are 
 marching hither over the plain. It is with the whites that they 
 are angry; so you had better make yourselves secure with us. 
 The soldier who brings this will escort M. Revel and you this 
 little way through the streets : but you must lose no time. We 
 are sorry to hurry your grandfather; but it cannot be helped. 
 Come, my dearest, to your " Afea Raymond." 
 
 Pierre saw his young lady's face turn as pale as any nun's, as 
 she glanced over this note. 
 
 " The carriage, Pierre ! Have it to the door instantly." 
 
 " With your leave. Mademoiselle, the soldier says no French 
 carriages wiU be safe in the streets this morning." 
 
 " Oh, mercy! A chair, then. Send for a chair this moment. 
 The soldier will go for it — ask him as a favour. They will not 
 dare to refuse one to a governor's guard. Then come, and 
 dress your master, and do not look so grave, Pierre, before 
 him." 
 
 Pierre went, and was met at the door by a servant with 
 another note. It was — 
 
 " Do not come by the street, dearest Euphrosyne. The nuns 
 will let you through their garden, into our garden alley, if you 
 can only get your grandfather over the balcony. My two mes- 
 seno-ers will help you ; but they are much wanted : — so make 
 haste. "A. R."

 Pierre ; and send one of them round into the convent garden, to 
 be ready to receive us there. The abbess will have the gate 
 open to the Government-house alley. Then come, and dress 
 your master ; and leave it to me to tell him everything." 
 
 " Likely enough," muttered Pierre ; " for I know nothing of 
 what is in those notes myself." 
 
 " And I do not understand what it is all about," said Buphro- 
 syne, as she returned to her grandfather. 
 
 He had fallen into a light doze, lulled by the motion and sound 
 of the humming-birds. Euphrosyne kissed his forehead, to rouse 
 him, and then told him gaily that it was terribly late — ^he had no 
 idea how late it was — he must get up directly. The bath ! no ; 
 there must be no bath to-day. There was not time for it ; or, 
 at least, he must go a little ride first. A new sort of carriage 
 was getting ready 
 
 She now looked graver, as Pierre entered. She said, that 
 while Pierre dressed him, she would put up some clothes for a 
 short visit to Government-house. 
 
 M. Revel, being now alarmed, Euphrosyne admitted that some 
 confusion in the streets was expected, and that the Governor and 
 Af ra thought that their friends would be most quiet at the back 
 of Government-house. 
 
 To her consternation, M. Revel suddenly refused to stir a step 
 from his own dwelling. He would not be deceived into putting 
 himself and his child into the hands of any mulattoes upon 
 earth, governors or other. Not one of his old friends, in Blanche- 
 lande's time, would have countenanced svich an act ; and he 
 would not so betray his colour and his child. He had rather die 
 on his own threshold. 
 
 " Ton must do as you please about that, sir," said Pierre; 
 " but, for Mademoiselle Euphrosyne, I must say, that I think it 
 is full early for her to die — and when she might be safe too ! " 
 
 " Oh, grandpapa ! I cannot let you talk of our dying," cried 
 Euphrosyne, her cheeks bathed in tears. " Indeed I will not 
 die — nor shall you either. Besides, if that were all " 
 
 The old man knew what was in her mind — that she was 
 thinking of the woods. He sank down on his knees by the bed- 
 side, and prayed that the earth might gape and swallow them up 
 — that the sea might rush in, and overflow the hollow where the 
 city had been, before he and his should fall into the hands of the 
 cursed blacks. 
 
 "Grandpapa," said Euphrosyne, gravely, "if you pray such a 
 prayer as that, do not pray aloud. I cannot hear such a prayer 
 as that." Struggling with her tears, she continued : "I know 
 you are very much frightened— and I do not wonder that you 
 are : but I do wish you would remember that we have very kind 
 friends who will protect us, if we will only make haste and go

 to them. And as for their being of a different colour — I do 
 wonder that you can ask God to cause the earth to swallow us 
 up, when you know (at least, you have taught me so) we must 
 meet people of all races before the throne of God. He has made 
 of one blood all the nations of the earth, you know." 
 
 M. Revel shook his head impatiently, as if to show that she 
 did not understand his feelings. She went on, however : — 
 
 " If we so hate and distrust them at this moment, here, how 
 can we pray for death, so as to meet them at the next moment 
 there ? Oh, grandpapa ! let us know them a little better first. 
 Let us go to them now." 
 
 " Don't waste time so, child ; you hinder my dressing." 
 
 He allowed himself to be dressed, and made no further 
 opposition till he found himself at the balcony of the next 
 room. 
 
 " Here is your new coach," said Euphrosyiie, " and plenty of 
 servants :" showing him how one of the soldiers and old Raphael 
 stood below to receive the chair, and the abbess herself was in 
 waiting in a distant walk, beside the wicket they were to pass 
 through. 
 
 Of course, the old gentleman said he could never get down 
 that way ; and he said something about dying on his own thres- 
 hold — this time, however, in a very low voice. But, in the 
 midst of his opposition, Euphrosyne seated herself in the chair, 
 and was let down. When she could no longer hear his com- 
 plaints, but was standing beckoning to him from the grass-plat 
 below, he gave up all resistance, was let down with pei-f ect ease, 
 and carried in the chair, followed by all the white members of 
 his household, through the gardens, and up the alley where 
 Afra was awaiting them. There was a grey sister peeping from 
 behind every blind as they crossed the garden, and trembling 
 with the revived fears of that terrible night of ninety-one, when 
 they had fled to the ships. It was some comfort to them to see 
 old Raphael busy with rake and knife, repairing the damage 
 done to the bed under the balcony — all trampled as it was. 
 Each nun said to herself that Raphael seemed to have no fears 
 but that the garden would go on as usual, whatever disturbance 
 was abroad. 
 
 " Have you seen him ? " asked Euphrosyne eagerly of her 
 friend, the moment they met. 
 
 " Oh yes. Tou shall see him too, from my window, if they 
 will but talk on tiU we get there. He and the Commissary, and 
 some of the Commissary's officers, are in the rose-garden under 
 my window. Make haste, or they may be gone." 
 
 " We must see grandpapa settled hrst." 
 
 " Oh yes ; but I am so afraid they may be gone ! They have 
 been pacing the alley between the rose-trees this hour nearly —

 talking and arguing all the time. I am sure they were arguing ; 
 for they stopped every now and then, and the Commissary made 
 such gestures ! He looked so impatient and so vexed ! " 
 
 " And did he look vexed, too ? " 
 
 " Not in the least angry, but severe. So quiet, so majestic he 
 looked, as he listened to all they said ! and when he answered 
 them — Oh, I would not, for all the island, have his eyes so set 
 upon me ! " 
 
 " Oh dear, let us make haste, or they will be gone ! " cried 
 Euphrosyne. 
 
 While Euphrosyne was endeavouring to make her grandfather 
 feel himself at home and comfortable in the apartment appointed 
 for him by the Governor, Af ra ran to her window, to see if the 
 potentates of the island were still at their conference. The rose- 
 garden was empty ; and she came back sorrowfully to say so. 
 As she entered the apartment of her guests, she heard M. Revel 
 sending a message of compliments to the Commissary, with a 
 request of an audience of a few minutes. The servants gave as 
 much intimation as they dared of the Commissary being so par- 
 ticularly engaged, that they had rather be excused carrying this 
 message. The girls looked at one another, nodded agreement, 
 and Euphrosyne spoke. 
 
 " Suppose, grandpapa, you ask to see the Commander-in-chief. 
 He never refuses anything that is asked of him : and he can do 
 everything he wishes. I dare say he -will come at once, if you 
 desire it, and if we do not detain him too long. If he had been 
 ia this room once with us, how safe we should feel ! " 
 
 " Oh, if we could see him once in this room ! " cried 
 Afra. 
 
 "Do you suppose I will beg a favour of that ambitious 
 black P " cried M. Revel. " Do you think I will crave an audience 
 of a fellow who, for aught I know, may have driven his master's 
 carriage to my door in the old days P — ISo, if I cannot see 
 H^douviUe, I wUl take my chance. Go, fellow ! and carry my 
 message," he cried to Pierre. 
 
 Pierre returned with the answer which might have been 
 anticipated. The Commissary was so engaged, there was so much 
 bustle and confusion throughout his establishment, that no one 
 of his people would deliver the message. 
 
 " That would not have been the answer if " whispered 
 
 Euphrosyne to her friend. 
 
 " Shall I venture ? — yes, I will— shall I ? At least, I will keep 
 upon the watch," said Afra, as she withdrew.' 
 
 She presently sent in, with the tray of fruit, a basket of flowers, 
 which Euphrosyne occupied herself in dressing, exactly as she 
 did at home, humming the while the airs her grandfather 
 hoard her sing every day. Her devices answered very well.

 Ho presently occupied himself in pointing out, exactly as he 
 always did, that there was too much green in this bouquet, and 
 not enough in that. 
 
 CHAPTER XIV. 
 
 SPOILING SPOET. 
 
 NOTHiiTG could exceed the astonishment of the Commissary on 
 seeing Toussaint this morning. HedouTiIle was amusing 
 himself, before the sun was high, alternately with three or f our 
 of his officers, in duetting with a parrot, which had shown its 
 gaudy plumage among the dark foliage of a tamarind tree in 
 the garden. At every pause in the bird's chatter, one of the 
 gentlemen chattered in reply ; and thus kept up the discord, to 
 the great amusement of the party. Hedouville was just declaring 
 that he had obtained the best answer — the loudest and most 
 hideous — when he heard the swing of a gate, and, turning round, 
 saw Toussaint entering from the barrack-yard. 
 
 " The ape ! " exclaimed one of the officers, in a whisper. 
 
 "Who — who is it?" eagerly asked a nayal captain, lately 
 arrived. 
 
 " Who should it be but the black chief ? No other of his race 
 is fond enough of us to be for ever thrusting himself upon us. 
 He is confoundedly fond of the whites." 
 
 " We only ask him," said Delon, another officer, " to like us 
 no better than we like him, and leave us to manage our business 
 our own way." 
 
 " Say the word. Commissary," whispered the first, " and he 
 shall not go hence so easily as he came." 
 
 " I shoidd beg pardon. Commissary," said Toussaint, as he 
 approached, "for presenting myself thus — for entering by a 
 back-way — if it were not necessary. The crisis requires that 
 we should agree upon our plan of operations, before we are seen 
 in the streets. It is most important that we should appear to act 
 in concert. It is the last chance for the public safety." 
 
 "Crisis! — public safety! — seen in the streets!" exclaimed 
 Hedouville. "I assure you. General, I have no thoughts of 
 going abroad tUl evening. It will be a scorching day. Is tha 
 crisis you speak of that of the heats P " 
 
 " No trifling. Commissary ! Gentlemen," said he, turning to 
 the officers, who happened to be laughing, " no levity ! The 
 occasion is too serious for mirth or for loss of time. Shall we 
 speak alone. Commissary P " 
 


## p. (#156) ################################################

152 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " By no means," said Hedouville. " These gentlemen would 
 not for the world miss hearing your news. Has a fresh insurrection 
 been contrived already? or has any Frenchman forgotten 
 himself, and kissed Psyche, or cuffed Agamemnon P " 
 
 " A new insurrection has been contrived ; and by you. The 
 cultivators are marching over the plain ; and in four hours the 
 town will be sacked, i£ you, M. Hedouville, who have given the 
 j>rovocation,[do not withdraw it. Tou must sign this proclamation. 
 It is the opposite of your own now waiting for publication. 
 But you must sign and issue it — and that within this hour. I 
 hear what you say, gentlemen. Tou say that I have raised the 
 cultivators. I have not. There is not a negro in the plain who 
 does not at this moment believe that I am in the south. I come 
 to put them down ; but I will not go out with the sword in one 
 hand, if I do not carry justice in the other." 
 
 '' What do you mean about justice. General ? What injustice 
 has been done P " 
 
 "Here is the draft of- your proclamation " 
 
 "How came you by that paper — by the particulars of my 
 intention ? " asked Hedouville. " My proclamation is yet locked 
 up in my own desk." 
 
 " Its contents are nevertheless known throughout the colony. 
 When a Commissary, lightly and incidentally (and therefore 
 the more offensively) settles, without understanding them, the 
 most important points of difference between two unreconciled 
 races, the very winds stoop in their flight, to snatch up the tid- 
 ings, and drop them as they fly. See here ! See how you pro- 
 nounce on the terms of fleld-service — and here, on the partition 
 of unclaimed estates — and here, on the claims of the emigrants ! 
 The blacks must be indeed as stupid as you hold them to be, 
 if they did not spread the alarm that you ax% about to enslave 
 them again." 
 
 " I protest I never dreamed of such a thing." 
 
 " I believe you. And that you did not so dream, shows that 
 you are blind to the effects of your own measures — that the 
 cultivators of the plain understand your proceedings better than 
 you do yourself. Here is the proclamation which must be 
 issued." 
 
 And he offered a paper, which Hedouville took, but tore in 
 pieces, trampling them under foot, and saying, that he had never 
 before been so insulted in his function. 
 
 " That is a chUdish act," observed Toussaint, as he looked 
 down upon the fragments of the document. " And a useless 
 one," he continued ; " for my secretary is getting it printed off 
 by this time." 
 
 " Are you going to dare to put my name to a proclamation I 
 have not seen P " 
 


## p. (#157) ################################################

THE BURDEN OF GOVERNMENT. I53 
 
 " Certainly not. My name will suffice, if you compel me to 
 dispense with yours. This proclamation grants " 
 
 H^douville here gave whispered directions to Delon, who 
 hastened towards the nouse; and to another, who made for the 
 barrack-yard. 
 
 " Prom every quarter," said Toussaint, " you will have con- 
 firmation of the news I brought. I will speak presently of what 
 must be done. This proclamation," pointing to the torn paper. 
 " grants an amnesty to all engaged in former conflicts of race, 
 and declares that there are no ' returned emigrants ' in the 
 island — that they are all considered native proprietors — that 
 aU now absent shall be welcome again, and shall be protected 
 — that the blacks are free citizens, and will so remain ; but that 
 they shall continue for five years to till the estates on which they 
 live, for one-fourth of the produce." 
 
 " I do not see the grounds of your disgust with my proclama- 
 tion," said HedouviUe. " I think your anger absurd." 
 
 " I have no doubt you do. This proves, with a multitude of 
 other circumstances, that you must go." 
 
 ''Admirable ! And leave the colony to your government ! " 
 
 " Just so. If you ask the whites of the island, they will tell 
 you, almost to a man, that I can govern the whites ; while 
 events daily show that you cannot rule the blacks. While you 
 have held the title of Commissary, you know that you have 
 ruled only by my permission — sometimes strengthened by my 
 approbation — oftener spared by my forbearance. I am aware 
 that these gentlemen are not of that opinion," he continued, his 
 voice assuming the mildness which always distinguished it 
 when he spoke of his personal injuries. '' They believe that if 
 two or three brigands could be got to seize in his camp the ape 
 with the Madras on his head, all would be well. But they are 
 mistaken. They may play the brigand, and seize me now ; but 
 then the town will be burning before night." 
 
 " Ton should not believe all the saucy things that are told you 
 — you should not care for the impertinence of young soldiers," 
 said HedouviUe, who suspected that his affairs were really in a 
 critical state, and had now resumed his usual smoothness of 
 manner. He led the way up the alley between the rose-trees, 
 that the torn proclamation might be no longer in sight. 
 
 " No doubt," observed an officer, gravely, " the Commissary 
 will report to the First Consul (if you really persist in sending 
 the Commissary away) — he wiU doubtless report to the First 
 Consul the prodigious power you hold here, and how great a 
 rival Bonaparte has on this side the water." 
 
 " And how willing a servant," added Toussaint — "how wil- 
 ling to bear the burden of government for the good of France." 
 
 " Burden ! " exclaimed all. 
 


## p. (#158) ################################################

154 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " Yes," replied Toussaint : " where is there a heavier burden? 
 Do you suppose that men choose their own office in life ? If so, 
 should I have chosen such a one as mine ? Was the pleasure 
 of Heaven ever more clearly revealed than in my case ? Ask 
 the First Oonsul whether it was possible for me to be other than 
 I am. The revolution of St. Domingo proceeded without any 
 interference from me — a negro slave. I saw that the dominion 
 of the whites could not last, divided as they were among them- 
 selves, and lost in the numbers of their foes. I was glad that I 
 was a black. The time came when I was compelled to act. I 
 associated myself with the Spaniards, who were the allies of my 
 king, and who had extended protection to the loyal troops of my 
 colour. But this protection served no end. The republic pro- 
 claimed the general liberty of the blacks. An unerring voice 
 told me that my allegiance was thenceforward due to the republic. 
 The blacks in their new condition wanted a leader. They chose 
 me to lead them — to be the chief predicted by Baynal, as General 
 Laveaux declared. Inspired by this call, I entered into the ser- 
 vice of France. The services that I have rendered prove that it 
 was indeed the voice of God that called me. Why do I tell you 
 this ? — Because I owe an account of my life to you ? No, indeed ! 
 — I teU you aU this that you may render my account to the First 
 Consul, whom, it appears, I cannot reach by letter. I charge 
 you, by your fidelity to the mother country, to repeat to Bona- 
 parte what I have said." 
 
 "Tou could do it more accurately and forcibly yourself," 
 observed Hedouville. "Let me advise that you go instead of me." 
 
 " Tou know," replied Toussaint, " who it was that said that I 
 am the Bonaparte of St. Domingo, and that the colony could not 
 exist without me. It was your brother functionaries who said 
 it ; and never did they say anything more true." 
 
 The naval captain, Meronet, observed that his ship, now in the 
 roads, happened to be that which had conveyed the Commissary ; 
 and that it would greatly flatter him, after having brought out 
 Commissary Hedouville, to carry back General Toussaint 
 L'Ouverture. 
 
 " Tour ship, sir," replied Toussaint, " will not contain a man 
 like me — a man laden with the destinies of a race." 
 
 " But you speak of the burden of your office," observed one of 
 the aides. " It must be great ; and all men need occasional repose. 
 Suppose you retire to France for an interval of repose ? " 
 
 "Perhaps I may," replied Toussaint, "when this shrub," 
 pointing to the sucker of a logwood tree, " shall be large enough 
 to make a ship to take me there." 
 
 " Tou could devolve your cares upon your friend Raymond, 
 General, if you do not wish fully to trust the whites. Be persuaded 
 to visit your brother in destiny and glory, as you call Bonaparte."

DANGER Pressing. 155 
 
 '' Raymond is my friend, as you say, and a good man ; but he 
 is not called to be arbiter of tbe fate of tlie colony. See ! Here 
 are your messengers, Oommissaiy." 
 
 The oificers entered from the barracks, with news that the 
 plain was really in a state of commotion, and that no adequate 
 defences appeared to be provided by the authorities of the town. 
 
 " I _ charge myself with the defence of the town," said 
 Toussaint. " Tour part, Commissary, .is to sign the new pro- 
 clamation instantly ; and to prepare to sail for Prance, with as 
 many persons as desire to accompany you. On your promise to 
 do this, I will guarantee the public peace. In this case, you 
 incur no further dishonour than that of not understanding the 
 temper and the affairs of the blacks. If you refuse to go, I 
 shall arrest you here, and denounce you to the government of 
 France, as the cause of the insurrection which will undoubtedly 
 ensue. Tou will not choose to incur this infamy. Therefore," 
 he continued, turning to Captain Meronet, " you will have the 
 goodness to return to your ship, and prepare it for the reception 
 of the Commissary. He will probably join you in the course of 
 this day." 
 
 Again addressing the astonished funotionaiT, he continued, 
 
 " Tou shall be protected to the latest possible moment, for the 
 convenience of making your arrangements. When I can protect 
 you no longer, I will cause the alarm gun on the height behind 
 the barracks to be fired. At that signal, you will hasten to the 
 boats, and be gone. Assure yourself of my justice, and render 
 me an equal measure at the court of Prance. PareweU ! " 
 
 As he entered Government-house, the oficers looked at each 
 other in consternation. 
 
 " What is to be done P " asked more than one. 
 
 " It is true enough," said Hedouville, " that neither I nor 
 any one else understand these people. The danger is really 
 pressing, Delon." 
 
 '' Most pressing, there is no doubt." 
 
 " Then I have done with this mongrel colony ; and I am not 
 sorry. At home I shall find means to vindicate my honour." 
 
 " Tou mean to depart, then. Commissary ? " 
 
 " When we hear the alarm gun. Not sooner. It is possible 
 that it may be a mere threat." 
 
 " If so, it wUl be the first mere threat in which this black has 
 been detected." 
 
 " That is true. He usually acts first, and speaks afterwards. 
 Gentlemen, we shall have to go. I must first see about this 
 proclamation, and discover whether anything else can be done. 
 If not. Captain, au revoir ! "

 CHAPTER XY. 
 
 GO OE STAT? 
 
 The Commander-in-chief was not long closetect with G-Dvernor 
 Raymond : for this was a day when minutes were precious. It 
 was observed that there was a sudden actiidty among the mes- 
 songers of the Governor, among the soldiers, anil among the 
 citizens ; and every one felt that the voice of Toussaint was 
 giving orders in every corner of the town, before he had yet 
 come forth. The report spread that Moyse L'Ouverture was 
 come; and he was soon seen, superintending the placing of 
 cannon in the streets, and the mustering of soldiers in the squares. 
 The presence of the young man inspired an enthusiasm inferior 
 only to that which waited on the steps of his uncle. Its influence 
 on Moyse was seen in the fire of liis eye, the quickness of his 
 movements, and the hilarity of his air. He appeared to notice 
 every one who cheered, or waved hat or handkerchief to him, 
 and to overhear all that was said as he passed along. In one 
 instance he stopped to reply. 
 
 " I little thought," he heard an old negro merchant say to a 
 neighbour — " I little thought ever to see an Ouverture planting 
 cannon against his own colour." 
 
 " Nor do you see it now, friend," said Moyse. " The insur- 
 gents in the plain are of'aU colours — almost as many whites as 
 blacks are discontented with the Commissary, and " 
 
 " Turn your guns upon the Commissary, then, young soldier ! " 
 
 " There is no need, friend. "We shall be rid of the Commissary 
 by an easier method ; and these guns will be wheeled home, as 
 hai-mless as they came. My belief is that not a drop of negro 
 blood wUl be shed ; and to that end do we plant our cannon. If 
 we tranquiUise the whites of the town, and empty Government- 
 house of the French, the negroes of the plain will find none 
 but friends when they arrive." 
 
 " Oh, ay ! That is your policy, is it ? " 
 
 " That is L'Ouverture's policy. Tell it everywhere. He is 
 the best friend of the blacks who best makes it mown." 
 
 The explanation passed from mouth to mouth ; and the new 
 proclamation, signed by Toussaint and Hedouville, from hand to 
 hand. The proclamation was posted in the corners of the streets ; 
 it was read dioud in the squares ; it was sent, by messengers of 
 every colour, among the insurgents in the plain. The eSect of 
 this, connected with the report, which every moment gained 
 strength, that the Commissary was about to quit the colony was 
 so evident, that Toussaint's wishes seemed likely to be accom- 
 plished. The insurgents did uot, indeed, disband: they had

 been too often deceived by the Commissary's bland promises to 
 do that before they had gained their point : but there was every 
 reason to believe that wiey would march upon the town, only 
 to secure the departme of Hedouville and his adherents, and the 
 fidelity of the government to the terms of the proclamation. 
 
 WhenToussaint came forth fromhis conference with Raymond, 
 Afra and Euphrosyne were awaiting him in the corridor. He 
 would have passed them with a smile ; but he saw that Afra 
 was urging Euphrosyne to speak, and that the blushing Euphro- 
 syne dared not do so. He therefore stopped to tell Afra that his 
 daughters had sent their love to her; that she was going to 
 Pongaudin in a day or two ; and that her friends there would be 
 very glad to see her. 
 
 " Am I really going ? Does my father say that I may ? " 
 
 " He is going too : he will be there before you." 
 
 " My poor Euphrosyne, what will you do ? " exclaimed Afra. 
 " This is Euphrosyne Revel," she continued to Toussaint ; 
 " and " 
 
 " Revel ! " he said. " Have not you an aged relative in this 
 town, my dear ? " 
 
 " In that room," hastily answered Afra. " He is very old, 
 and much alarmed to-day ; and he cannot believe that he and 
 Euphrosyne are safe, even here. If you wiU only assure Eu- 
 phrosyne that there is no danger — M. she could tell him that you 
 say so " 
 
 " I will teU him myseH," said Toussaint. " He is in that 
 apartment, you say P*" 
 
 "Oh! but please your Excellency," exclaimed Afra, "he 
 
 may not like — he may not wish ^Euphrosyne is as much 
 
 devoted to you as we are, but " 
 
 Toussaint was well aware that M. Revel might not like, would 
 not wish, to see him, or any black. Among aU the hatreds which 
 had deformed the colony, none more fierce had existed than that 
 between M. Revel and the negro race. He had been a cruel 
 master; hence his incessant terrors now. He had been marked 
 out for vengeance at the time of the revolution, and his family 
 had perished for his crimes ; and hence the detestation in which, 
 as the survivor of these victims, he was regarded by most who 
 knew the story. Euphrosyne knew nothing of it ; nor did her 
 young companion. There was no one to teU them uselessly so 
 painful a tale ; and there was nothing in M. Revel's present con- 
 duct to awaken a suspicion of the truth. He rarely saw a black : 
 and the tenderness which lies in some corner of the hardest hearts 
 was by him lavished upon his only remaining descendant. Little 
 did she suppose now, how much better her grandfather was 
 known by Toussaint than by herself. 
 
 " Trust me ! " said Tou,ssaint, smiling. " I will not annoy

IS8 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 M. Revel. I will merely reassure him, and teU Mm a little good 
 news ; and then leave him to his repose." 
 
 " Tes, Alra," interposed Euphrosyne. " Oh yes, please your 
 Bicellenoy, do go ! I will teU him you are coming." 
 
 She flew along the corridor, and, with joyous smiles, prepared 
 M. Revel for some great honour and pleasure, when Toussaint 
 entered, and bowedlow, as it had ever been his custom to do 
 before grey hairs. 
 
 " I come," said he to the old man, who seemed at a loss 
 whether to rise or not, but who would not ask his visitor to sit 
 down, " I come to encourage you to dismiss aU fears. By the 
 resolution of the Commissary to sail for France this day all 
 further disputes are obviated. We have strong hopes that peace 
 will not be disturbed." 
 
 "The Commissary going home ! Who, then, is to govern us ? 
 What is to become of the whites in the colony P " 
 
 " I wiU take care of them. Those who are unwilling to 
 remain, in the absence of the Commissary, can depart with him. 
 There is shipping enough for more than will wish to go." 
 
 Euphrosyne glanced apprehensively at her grand&ther, and 
 then said, 
 
 " Grandpapa is too old to go upon the sea any more ; and I 
 am not afraid of anything here. I do not believe there is any- 
 thing to be afraid of here ; is there ? " 
 
 " Indeed, I believe not." 
 
 " Besides," said Afra, " my father wiU not allow any harm to 
 happen to his best friends. My father '' 
 
 " Tour father, my dear, will not be here," said Toussaint. 
 " He is appointed to the legislature, in the interior. I protect 
 this town till a new governor is appointed. I told you we 
 hoped to see you at Pongaudin. Ton wiU. pass your time there, 
 with my family, while M. Raymond attends his duties in the 
 legislature. I go, su-, to provide for the peace of the town. If 
 I can be of service to you, you have only to send to me. I 
 entreat you to rely upon my protection." 
 
 And he went out. 
 
 " Oh, grandpapa ! " exclaimed Euphrosyne, sighing. 
 
 " My dears, I hope I was not rude to him. I know that he 
 meant kindly by coming : and I would not be otherwise than 
 civil. I hope I was not rude to the Commander-in-chief." 
 
 Neither of his companions spoke, to give him comfort on this 
 head. He grew angry. He declared that he did not understand 
 all these changes and troubles, and he would go out of the way 
 of them. He would sail with Hedouville; and so should 
 Euphrosyne, and so should Pierre. He knew he should die 
 before they had been a week at sea ; but he would not stay to 
 see everything turned topsy-turvy by the blacks.

toussaint's position. 159 
 
 Afra gently said that she understood it was Hedouville who 
 had endeavoured to turn everything topsy-turvy, and those who 
 understood the affairs of the colony better, who hoped to keep 
 them straight. Euphrosyne protested that it was impossible to 
 get home, to pack iip their goods ; and even if they were at 
 home, there was no time to do it properly. When she found all 
 her objections of this class unavailirig, she gravely said that she 
 fully believed what her grandfather had just declared — that he 
 would die before they had been a week at sea ; and nothing, 
 therefore, should make her consent to go. A compromise was at 
 length agreed upon. Euphrosyne promised to enter the convent, 
 if her grandfather should desire it : and on this promise, he con- 
 sented to say no more about going to sea. 
 
 As Toussaint went forth from M. Revel's apartment, he met 
 M. Pascal, with his portfolio in his hand. 
 
 " M. Pascal here already ! I am gratified — I am grateful ! " 
 said Toussaint, grasping his hand. " Tou are weary — you must 
 be very weary ; but can you work a little before going to rest P " 
 
 " Willingly. No doubt. Most willingly." 
 
 Toussaint desired that fruit and wine should be sent to the 
 governor's private room, and that the reports of messengers from 
 the city should be brought instantly to him there. M. Pascal 
 and he then sat down beside a table, with pen, ink, and paper 
 before them. 
 
 " M. Pascal," Toussaint began, " the Commissary sails for 
 Prance this day, with as many as desire to accompany him. 
 Tou know the reasons which compel me to advise his departure. 
 Tou came out as his secretary. D you desire to return with him ? " 
 
 " I do not. With your permission, I will remain with you." 
 
 " With what view P " 
 
 " My own satisfaction, and the wish to serve the colony. My 
 attachment to yourself is strong. I also perceive that you 
 govern wisely and well ; and I desire to aid in so important a 
 work." 
 
 " Good. But you are not aware of the danger of attaching 
 yourseM thus exclusively to me. Till to-day, if 1 fell, your way 
 to France, your way in Prance, was open. After to-day, it will 
 no longer be so. I am so surrounded with dangers, that I can 
 scarcely escape ruin or death. The mulattoes conspire against 
 my power and my life. The blacks, for whom I have made 
 myswf responsible, are yet full of passion, and not to be relied 
 on in the present infancy of their education. The French 
 ofBcials are so many malignant spies — excepting yourself, in- 
 deed," he added, with a smile. " Bonaparte, who rules every- 
 where, is surrounded by our emigrants, who attribute their 
 sufferings to the blacks ; and he is jealous of me. I would rather 
 say he distrusts me. Now you see my position. I ask.no

 white to share its perils. H you go with Hedouville, you shaD 
 carry with you my friendly farewell." 
 
 " I will stay with you." 
 
 " Thank God ! Then we are friends indeed ! Now to busi- 
 ness. In the pressing affairs of to-day, we must not overlook 
 the future security of the colony. The story which Hedouville 
 will tell at home must be met and illustrated by our statement. 
 Write so fully to the First Consul as that he may clearly see 
 that it is to Hedouville's ignorance and presumption that the 
 present disturbances are owing." 
 
 " It is a clear case." 
 
 " It is to us. Make it so to him. One word first. Will you 
 undertake the office of governor of this town ? " 
 
 " Instead of Raymond ? " 
 
 " Instead of Raymond. He is a good man ; but I erred in 
 appointing Mm. He is fit for deliberation, but not for action. 
 But for my early arrival, this town would have been burned 
 to-day, for want of even a show of defence. He is setting out 
 now for the legislature, to which I have appointed him, and 
 where he will be valuable. Will you assume his office ? " 
 
 " By no means. I desire to remain beside you, and study your 
 mode of government, before I attempt myself to govern." 
 
 " I have no fixed mode of governing. I merwy act as seems 
 to me good at the time." 
 
 " Inspired by a generous love, ever," said Pascal 
 
 " Enough of this. It would be an advantage to me, and to 
 the colony, that you should undertake this office. There is no 
 other white, there is no mulatto fit for it ! and the mulattoes 
 need conciliation. If they see the office bestowed on a black, 
 or occupied by me, in the interim they will feel themselves 
 injured by Raymond's removal. Tou see the advantages of 
 your filling the office." 
 
 " I see yet more plainly the disadvantages, imfit as I am. I 
 cannot accept it." 
 
 " Very well. While you are writing, I will ascertain how 
 the provisioning of the ships goes on, and wiU give you as much 
 time as possible. But there is not a moment to lose. I wiU 
 return presently to sign." 
 
 Toussaint walked up and down the corridor, receiving reports, 
 and issuing orders every moment. He found that the harbour 
 was covered with boats carrying out hogs, fowls, vegetables, and 
 water, according to his orders : but no baggage had been sent 
 down from the quarters of the French offioisJs, though porters 
 had been waiting for two hours past. Scouts had come in, with 
 news of the approach of the insurgents. This information was 
 communicated to Hddouville, with a hint that the ships were 
 (learly provisioned ; but no answer was returned. Moyse sent

AFFAIRS BECOME CRITICAL. l6l 
 
 word tliat the preparations in the town were nearly complete, 
 and the spirit of the inhabitants improving every hour, if only 
 the Commissary would make haste and oe gone. Toussaint 
 found the moment was coming for him to give the word to fire 
 the alarm gun. 
 
 " Are the despatches nearly ready P " he asked of Pascal, 
 entering the secretary's apartment. 
 
 " Quite ready for signature," replied Pascal, drying the ink 
 of the last sheet. 
 
 " Excellent ! " cried Toussaint, when he had read them. 
 '' True and clear I " 
 
 He signed and sealed them, and introduced the officer who 
 was to be responsible for their delivery, assuring him that he 
 would be welcome back to the honours which would follow the 
 faithful discharge of his trust. He did not forget to request M. 
 Pascal to go to rest. There might be no rest for either of them 
 this night. 
 
 As Euphrosyne sat beside M. Bevel, who was sleeping on a 
 couch, after the fatigaes of the morning, old Pierre beckoned 
 her softly out, sending in Euphrosyne's maid, and saying, as he 
 shut the door, 
 
 " She wUl stay with my master till he wakes. Mademoiselle 
 Afra has sent for you, mademoiselle, to see from the upper 
 gallery what is going on. The harbour is so crowded with boats, 
 that they can hardly move ; and it is time they were moving 
 pretty fast ; for the battle is beginning at the other end of the 
 town ; and the Commissary is not ofE yet, though the gun was 
 fired half-an-hour since. Ton heard the gun, mademoiselle ? " 
 
 " Tes. I am glad it was only a signal. You are sure it was 
 only a signal ? " 
 
 " So they say everywhere. This is the way, mademoiselle. 
 M. Pascal is up here — the secretary, you know — and Made- 
 moiselle Raymond, and her gouvernante, and several more, who 
 have nothing to do with the fighting." 
 
 " But I do not want to see any fighting," said Euphrosyne, 
 turning upon the stairs to descend. "Tell Mademoiselle 
 ■Raymond that I cannot bear to see fighting.'' 
 
 " There is no fighting yet, mademoiselle, indeed : and many 
 say there will not be any. Indeed you must see such a fine 
 sight as this. Tou can see the Oommander-m-chief galloping 
 about the square, with his two trompettes at his heels." 
 
 Euphrosyne turned again, and ran up to the top, without once 
 stopping. There she was hastily introduced to M. Pascal, and 
 placed by the gouvernante where she could see everything. 
 
 By this time it had become a question whether the Commis- 
 sary and his suite could get away. They were making every 
 effort to do so; but it was clear that their road would have been 
 K

 blockaded if the Commander-in-chief and his trompettes had 
 not ridden round and round the party of soldiers which escorted 
 them, clearing a passage by the power of a voice and a presence 
 which always prevaifed. Meantime, a huge body of people, 
 which filled aU the streets in the northern quarter, was gaining 
 ground, pressing forwards against the peaceable opposition of 
 the town's-people, and the soldiers, commanded by Moyse. The 
 clamour of voices from that quarter was prodigious, but there 
 were no shots. The wharves were covered with gentlemen, 
 ladies, children, servants, and baggage, all being precipitated by 
 degrees into boats, and rowed away, while more were perpetually 
 arriving. 
 
 " Is not this admirable ? " said M. Pascal. " The secret has 
 actually been kept that the Commissary is on his way to the 
 water side. See ! the cultivators are pressing on in this direc- 
 tion. They think he is here. If they knew where he was, they 
 might catch him. As it is, I believe he will escape." 
 
 " Oh ! are they coming here ? Oh, my poor grandfather ! " 
 cried Euphrosyne, turning very pale. 
 
 " Fear nothing," said Afra. '' They wiU presently learn that 
 there is nothing to come here for. Will they not, M. Pascal P " 
 
 " No doubt : and if not, there is nothing to fear, I believe. 
 Not a shot has been fired yet, but from the alarm gun." 
 
 " Oh, how it echoed from the Haut-du-Cap ! '' cried Afra. " 1 
 wonder what the cultivators understood by it. See ! my father's 
 barge ! There is fighting there, surely." 
 
 As Hedouville and his suite approached the wharf, the 
 Governor's barge, which had lain at a little distance from the 
 shore, began to press in, among the crowd of other boats, at a 
 signal from one of the trompettes. The other boats, which were 
 taking in terrified women and children, resisted this movement, 
 and refused, at such a moment, its usual precedence to the 
 Governor's barge. There was a hustling, a struggling, a shriek- 
 ing, an uproar, so loud as to reach the ears and understandings 
 of the insurgents. The word spread that the Commissary was 
 escaping them. They broke through their opponents, and began 
 a rush to the wharves. Not a few shots were now fired ; but 
 the young ladies scarcely heeded them in the excitement of this 
 decisive moment. 
 
 " Oh, they will seize him ! They will tear him in pieces ! " 
 cried Afra. 
 
 " He cannot — no, he never can get away ! " exclaimed 
 Euphrosyne. 
 
 " And he gave me the sweetest smile as he was going out ! " 
 said the weeping gonvernante. 
 
 " There ! Bravo ! Bravo ! " cried M. Pascal ; and Pien-e 
 echoed " Bravp 1 "

ESCAPED. 163 
 
 " What is it ? What is it ? " cried the girls. 
 
 " He is safe ! He and his party — they are all safe ! Not in 
 the barge — that is upset. Tou see those two green boats, now 
 pulling off. They are there. They leaped into those boats just 
 in time." 
 
 " Oh, look, look ! what dreadful confusion ! " cried Euphrosyne, 
 covering her eyes with her hands. 
 
 " It is not so sure that they are safe yet," observed Pierre. 
 " See liow the blacks are pouring into the water ! " 
 
 _ " And carrying the ladies and children with them, I fear," 
 said M. Pascal, gazing anxiously through his glass. 
 
 In fact, the negroes had no idea of giving up the pursuit 
 because they had reached the water. Hundreds plunged in; 
 and their heads wore seen bobbing about all the surface of the 
 bay. The rowers, however, pulled well, and presently left the 
 greater number behind, to find satisfaction in the coolness of the 
 element. 
 
 " Thei-e is no great harm done," said M. Pascal, still gazing 
 through his glass. " They have picked up two ladies and three 
 children ; and none seem to be missing." 
 
 " It is well that you and Monsieur were not there, Euphro- 
 syne," observed Afra. 
 
 Euphrosyne shuddered, and Pierre looked all amazement at 
 the absurdity of such an idea. 
 
 " No fear for us. Mademoiselle," said he. " See how empty 
 the streets are, down below. None but the guard left, within 
 half a mile," 
 
 It did indeed appear as if the whole population of the town 
 and plain was collected on the shores of the bay. Those who 
 had thrown themselves into the sea had to wait for a footing on 
 land, unless they chose to swim round the point — which some 
 of them did. When at length the crowd began to move up into 
 the town, it was because the Commander-in-chief was riding 
 away, after having addressed the people. 
 
 " What have you been about, child ? " exclaimed M. Eevel, an 
 hour after. " Tou are never beside me when I wake." 
 
 Euphrosyne did not point out that this was the first time she 
 had failed to watch his siesta. She said that she had been seeing 
 the Commissary set sail. 
 
 " What, already I He is in a great hurry, I think." 
 
 " The wind is quite fair, grandpapa. I suppose that is the 
 reason why he made all the ships in the harbour sail the same 
 way. He has carried off three frigates, and all the shipping in 
 the roads. The sea is quite clear, grandpapa. There is not a 
 single sail in sight, all along, as far as you can see. They are 
 all off for France." 
 
 " What in the world made him do that ? "

 " Perhaps we shall hear, some day. To be sure, he had to 
 carry a good many people away with him." 
 
 " Did many whites go with him ? " 
 
 " I do not know how many whites. They say fifteen hundred 
 went altogether ; but many of these were mulattoes ; and some 
 few blacks, who went for a frolic, and will come back again when 
 they hare seen France." 
 
 " Strange doings ! Strange doings ! " sighed the old man. 
 
 " And we shall have some glorious doings to-morrow, grand- 
 papa. There was a little bustle and struggle when the Commis- 
 sary went away — I am glad you were asleep, and did not hear it. 
 There will be no more — there will be no riot now, everybody 
 says — the Commander-in-chief has behaved so finely, and the 
 people are so fond of him. The danger is all over ; and the 
 town's-people have begged him — the Deliverer, as they call him 
 — to attend the great church to-morrow, in state. Te Deum will 
 be sung in all the churches, and it is to be a great fete-day. Are 
 you not pleased F " 
 
 " Not at aU pleased that Hedouville is gone, and fifteen hun- 
 dred of his friends, and all the shipping." 
 
 " Well, but we are all at peace now, and everybody satisfied." 
 
 " Why are we here, then p Why am I not at home .' " 
 
 " We will go home in a day or two. The streets will be noisy 
 to-night ; and besides, one removal is enough for one day. Af ra 
 will follow her father after to-morrow — he is gone, you know, 
 this morning " 
 
 " Whose guest am I, then? If I am the guest of the negro 
 Toussaint " 
 
 " Tou are the guest of M. Raymond while Afra is here. When 
 she sets out, we will go home." 
 
 " And shall I have to be swung up to the balcony, and have 
 my brains dashed out, while all the nuns are staring at me ? " 
 
 "Oh, no," replied Euphrosyne, laughing. "There will be 
 nothing then to prevent your going in your own carriage to 
 your own door. I am afraid we shall not find my pretty 
 little hummiug-birds there. They will think I have forgotten 
 them." 
 
 " Ay, those humming-birds," said M. Revel, appearing to for 
 get aU his troubles.

 CHAPTER XVI. 
 
 DREAMING AWAKE. 
 
 THOrsH the peace of the town was now considered secure, there 
 was little less bustle throughout the day and night than there 
 had been in the morning. The cultiyators were sSl gone home. 
 They poured out of the town almost as fast as they had poured 
 into it, happy to have attained their object, in the defeat of the 
 French authorities, and to be retm-ning without the loss or 
 punishment of a man. As they attained the height behind 
 which they would lose sight of the sea, they turned for one more 
 view of the empty bay, and of the fleet, now disappearing on the 
 horizon. They gave three cheers ; and this was the last that 
 was heard of them, except by such as met them in the plain, 
 where they sang, as they walked, the words of their chief's pro- 
 clamation. In negro fashion, they had set it to music ; and very 
 well it sounded, when sung from the heart. 
 
 In the town, the soldiers were busy removing the guns, and 
 all signs of wai-fare, and the inhabitants in preparing for the fete 
 of to-morrow. During the night, the hurry of footsteps never 
 ceased — so many of the citizens were going out into the country, 
 and returning with blossoming shrubs to adorn the churches, 
 and flowers with which to strew the path of the Deliverer. 
 Under cover of these zealous preparations did discontent, like a 
 serpent under the blossoms of the meadow, prepare to fix its 
 poisonous tooth. There were men abroad in the streets who 
 looked upon these preparations for rejoicing with a determina- 
 tion that the rejoicings should never take place. 
 
 The business of this arduous day being finished, Toussaint had 
 retired early to rest, in a chamber in the south wing of Govern- 
 ment-house — the part which had been inhabited by the Trench 
 functionaries. He would allow no one to occupy any apartments 
 of the north wing (that which was appropriated to the governor 
 of the town), while the daughter of the late governor and her 
 guests remained there. His secretary, who had taken some 
 hours' rest before, was busy writing, after midnight, in an apart- 
 ment in the same wing. He was preparing dispatches for the 
 Central Assembly, now sitting in the interior. 
 
 M. Pascal was far from being on good terms with himself this 
 night. H, in the morning, he had doubted his capacity for being 
 governor of the town, he this night doubted his qualifications for 
 the office of secretary, which he had thus far filled to his own 
 satisfaction. To-night he could not command his ideas — he 
 could not fix his attention. He wrote a paragraph, and then he 
 dreamed ; he planned a proposition, and then he forgot it again ;

l66 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 and, in despair, started \y^ to pace the floor, and disperse intru- 
 siTe thoughts by exercise. These thoughts would intrude again, 
 however ; and he found himself listlessly watching through the 
 window a waving tree-top, or a sinking star, while Ms pen dried 
 in his hand. 
 
 These intrusive ideas were of Af ra. He had never thought of 
 love, in regard to himseK, even enough to despise it, or to resolve 
 against it : and the time was apparently come when love was to 
 revenge himself for this neglect. Perhaps it was this idea, as 
 much as the attractions of Afra herself, that haunted him 
 to-night. He felt that his hour was come ; that he was hence- 
 forth, like other men, to be divided between two pursuits, to be 
 dependent upon another for his tranquillity. He felt already 
 that he could never again see Mademoiselle Raymond, or hear 
 of her, without emotion. He had never understood love at first 
 sight, and had hardly believed in it : — ^he now did not under- 
 stand it ; but he could not but believe in it. He felt actually 
 haunted. Every breath of air that whispered in the window 
 brought her voice. Everything that moved in the night breeze 
 made him start as if it was herself. At last, in despair about 
 his task, which must be finished before dawn, he covered his 
 eyes with his hands, as he leaned back in his chair, resolving not 
 to move till he had ascertained what it was that he wanted to 
 write next. 
 
 A slight noise in the direction of the door, however, made him 
 look up ; and he saw, advancing towards the light, no other than 
 Afra herself. It was no wonder that he sat upright in his chair, 
 his pale face paler than usual. In another moment, however, 
 he blushed to the temples on hearing a suppressed laugh from 
 some one who stood behind Afra, and who said, after some vain 
 attempts to speak for laughing — 
 
 " M. Pascal takes us for ghosts." 
 
 " By no means, Mademoiselle Revel. Ghosts do not wrap 
 themselves in shawls from the night air, I believe ; nor come in 
 at the door when the shorter way is through the wall ; or take a 
 seat when asked, as I hope you will do." And he placed chairs 
 as he spoke. 
 
 " We might have frightened you delightfully if we could have 
 looked half as ghost-like as you did, the first moment you saw 
 us. Perhaps it was the lamp " 
 
 " Hush ! Euphrosyne," said Afra. " Tou speak too loud, and 
 waste time. Remember what we came for. M. Pascal," she 
 said, in a low voice, leaning towards him over the table, and 
 refusing to sit down, "how is L'Ouverture guarded P " 
 
 " Not at all, I believe. Why ? " 
 
 The girls made a gesture of terror. Both said eagerly — 
 
 " He is in great danger ; indeed, indeed he is.''

WARNING. 167 
 
 " Where are the soldiers ? " asked Euphrosyne. " Do send 
 for them directly -. and ask him to lock himself up in the safest 
 place till they come." 
 
 " Tell me what you mean, and then '' 
 
 " I think he is in danger, now the white rulers are gone, 
 from the people of my colour," said Afra : " and I fear, this very 
 night." 
 
 " Do you mean, that they intend to murder him P " 
 
 " Perhaps so. Perhaps to seize him, and send him to Rigaud ; 
 — and that will he only a slower murder." 
 
 "But how " 
 
 " I wiU tell you. Euphrosyne and I sat rather late hehind 
 the jalousies, in the dark, to see the people bring in flowers and 
 fruit from the country for the morning. I saw many mulattoes 
 in the walk ; but none of them had fruit or flowers. I watched 
 them. I know their ways, their countenances, and their ges- 
 tures. I saw they were gloomy and angry; and I found out 
 that it is with L'Onverture. They were plotting mischief, I am 
 certain." 
 
 " But why so suddenly ? — why to-night ? " 
 
 " So we thought at first ; and we went to rest, intending to 
 teU L'Onverture to-morrow. But the more we thought and 
 talked about it, the more uneasy we grew. We were afraid to 
 go to sleep without telling some one in this wing; so we stole 
 along the corridors in the dark, and saw that there was a light 
 in this library, and ventured to look in, hoping it might be 
 L'Onverture himself." 
 
 " He is asleep in a I'oom near. I wiU waken him. Ton are 
 not afraid to stay here a few moments, while I am gone ^ " 
 
 "Oh, no." 
 
 " He may wish to question you himself." 
 
 " Tell him," said Alra, speaking rapidly, " that the mulattoes 
 are jealous of him, because they think he wants to have all the 
 power in his own hands. They say — ' There go the ships ! 
 There are no whites in power now. So much the better ! But 
 here is Raymond displaced, and L'Ouverture is all in all. We 
 shall have every office filled with blacks ; and the only chance 
 for our degraded colour is in the fields or in the removal of this 
 black.' Tell him this : but oh ! be sure you tell him my father 
 and I do not agree in one word of it." 
 
 " She would do anything in the world to save him," said 
 Euphrosyne. 
 
 " Ton are dear as a daughter to him," said M. Pascal, with 
 eyes of love, as he left them. 
 
 " I wish I was sure of that,'' said Afra. " But what can be 
 done, Euphrosyne ? He has no guard ! And my father is not here, 
 nor anyone to help us! I fancyevery moment I hear them coming." 
 


## p. (#172) ################################################

1 68 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " I am not much afraid," said Eupkrosyne, her teeth chatter- 
 ing all the while. " He is so powerful ! He never seems to 
 want anybody to protect — scarcely to help him." 
 
 " But asleep ! After midnight ! Thiiifc of it ! If they should 
 seize him and bind him before he is awake ! " 
 
 This fear was removed by his appearance, dressed, and like 
 himself. He smiled at the girls, oflered them each an arm, and 
 said he had a sight to show them, if they would look at it with- 
 out speaking. He led them in the dark to a window, whence 
 they looked down upon a court-yard, which was full of soldiers, 
 awake and armed. In another moment, Toussaiut was con- 
 ducting them along the corridors, towards' their own apartments, 
 
 " Tou knew ! " whispered Afra. " "We need not have come. 
 I believe you always know everything." 
 
 " I suspected a plan to prevent the publishing of the amnesty 
 to-morrow, and the filling up the offices of the colony with 
 blacks. I suspected, but was not certain. Tour intelligence has 
 confirmed me." 
 
 " What will happen ? " asked Euphrosyne, trembling. " Will 
 anybody be killed r " 
 
 " Not to-night, I trust. Tou may go to rest secure that no 
 blood will be spilled to-night ; and to-morrow, you know, is a 
 holy-day. If you hear a step in the corridor of this your wing, 
 do not be alarmed. I am going to send one of my own guard." 
 
 He left them at their door, after standing to hear them fasten 
 it inside. 
 
 The girls kept awake as long as they could, calling each 
 other's attention to every fancied noise. They could be sure of 
 nothing, however, but of the march of the sentinel along the cor- 
 ridor. They both slept at last, and were wakened in broad day- 
 light by the gouvernante, who entered in great trepidation, to 
 say that there had been a plot against the Commander-in-chief ; 
 — ^that the window of his chamber had been entered at two 
 o'clock by a party of mnlattoes, who had all been seized by 
 L'Ouverture's soldiers. How it came to end so — ^how soldiers 
 enough happened to be at hand at the right moment — ^how it 
 was all done without fighting, without noise enough even to 
 break her rest (and she always knew if anybody stirred) — the 
 gouvernante could not tell. All she knew was, that L'Ouver- 
 ture was the most considerate creature in the world. As soon 
 as the eleven mnlattoes who had been taken were put into con- 
 finement, L'Ouverture had sent one of his own guards into her 
 corridor to prevent her being alarmed for herself and her young 
 charge.

 CHAPTER XVII. 
 
 THE GIFT AT THE ALTAR. 
 
 Poor Euplirosyne ! She was not allowed by her grandfather to 
 go to church this day. M. Bevel insisted upon it that it would 
 be an act of treason for one of the French race to attend a thanks- 
 giving for having got rid of the French authorities. In vain 
 did Euphrosyne represent that the thanksgiving was for some- 
 thing very different — for the deliverance of the town and dis- 
 trict from war — for the security of white and black inhabitants 
 alike. — Neither M. Revel nor Pierre would hear a word of this. 
 They were quite sure that the faster the dark people thronged 
 to the churches to rejoice, the more fervently should the whites 
 mourn and pray for mercy at home. Her grandfather said 
 Pierre should escort her to the chapel of the convent, where she 
 might go without being seen. That service was a fitting one for 
 her to attend ; and he would spare her for a couple of hours, to 
 be so spent, under the eye of the abbess. This, however, 
 Euphrosyne declined. She preferred remaining to see from 
 behind the blind what went on in the Jesuits' Walk — to see 
 Afra and her gouvemante dressed for chm-ch — to see L'Ouver- 
 ture set forth — to see the soldiei-s follow, marching in a compact 
 body, each man carrying a gi-een bough, in token of rejoicing. 
 She did not know, any more than the crowd that lined the way, 
 that in the centre of this body of military, and concealed by the 
 green boughs, were the eleven mulatto prisoners. 
 
 Afra entered quickly to say farewell ; and, lifting her veil 
 hastily, she said, 
 
 " Kiss me, and let me go. L'Ouverture says he shall take us 
 into church himself, as my father is not here. Mademoiselle 
 and I are going with Madame Ducie and her daughters ; and 
 L'Ouverture will wait for us at the church, and lead us in. Poor 
 Euphrosyne ! I wish you were going ! " 
 
 " I never cared for anything half so much. WiU you reaUy 
 walk all through the church to your seat on liis arm P And I 
 should have been on the other side, if grandpapa would have let 
 me go I Do not stay, dear. Tell me all about it when you 
 come back." 
 
 " I must be gone. There will not be standing-room for one 
 person to spare. Tou know every one of my colour in Cap is 
 ordered to be in the church as the hour strikes. Farewell." 
 
 Euphrosyne had thought she had heard the crier publish this 
 order ; and presently Pierre brought her the handbill to the same 
 effect, which was passing from hand to hand. If Euphrosyne

170 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 and Pierre speculated curiously on what this order might mean, 
 what must have been the anxiety of the mulattoes ! Most of 
 them had known of the conspiracy of the day before : all had 
 now heard of its failure. All were anxious to attend the church, 
 as staying away would amount to a confession of disloyalty ; but 
 there was not one of them who did not go with fear and trem- 
 bling, wishing that the day was over, though dreading what it 
 might bring forth. 
 
 As Af ra, and the ladies who attended her, drew near the great 
 church, they found the streets absolutely empty. Loyalty, and 
 the desire to appear loyal, had carried the entire population to 
 the churches ; and the houses appeared deserted by all but an 
 aged or sick person, here and there, who looked forth upon the 
 activity he could not share. In the centre of the area before the 
 church were piled the arms of the garrison and of Toussaint's 
 troops ; and on the top of the pile of arms lay the fetters which 
 had just been removed from the mulatto conspirators. L'Ouver- 
 ture, in giving his orders to this effect, had said that arms should 
 be laid aside in the act of thanksgiving for peace ; and bonds, 
 while giving thanks for liberty. When, at length, he gave the 
 signal for the military to enter the church after him, some of the 
 officers looked earnestly to him for orders that a guard might be 
 left with the arms. He understood their thoughts, and replied, 
 with a smile : — ■> 
 
 " Let every one enter to vforship : the arms are safe. There 
 is no one near who would employ them against us." 
 
 Afra's heart beat, and she did not forget Euphrosyne, as she 
 was led to her seat by L'Ouverture, at whose entrance there 
 was a half-suppressed murmur throughout the vast congrega- 
 tion — a murmur which sank into silence at the first breathing 
 of solemn music from the choir. The signs of gratulation for 
 the escape of the Deliverer, first heard in the streets, and now 
 witnessed amidst the worshipping crowd, were too much for the 
 self-command of the conspirators. Their attitude became every 
 moment more downcast— their countenances more sullen and 
 wretched. They had a strong impression that their execution 
 was to seal the thanksgivings of this day ; and in every allusion 
 to deliverance from danger, privy conspiracy, and rebellion, they 
 believed that they read their own doom. A tempting idea of 
 escape now and then crossed the imagination of one or other of 
 them. As they sat with their heads upon their breasts, the 
 thought that they were unfettered, and their guards unarmed, 
 made them eager to glance around, and see if there was hope ; 
 but whenever they raised their eyes, and whichever way they 
 looked, they encountered eyes seemingly as numerous as the stars 
 of heaven — as many, as penetrating, but not so calm. Eyes 
 which shone with love of L'Ouverture. could not look benignly

 on those who would have kidnapped or murdered him. Nor 
 did the eleven meet with any risible sympathy from the multi- 
 tude of their own colour who were present. The greater num- 
 ber looked studiously another way, in order to appear to have 
 no connection with them ; and the countenances which were 
 turned towards them wore a strong expression of displeasure, as 
 towards men who had ruined the last hopes of a cause. The 
 wretched men gave themselves up, at length, to counting the 
 minutes till the service should be over, and they should be once 
 more retired from this myriad of eyes, when they were roused 
 by a singular suspension of the service. 
 
 After the prayer for divine pardon, ensuing upon mutual 
 forgiveness, L'Ouverture arose from his knees, stepped from his 
 place, and stood before the altar. He spoke, while all rose to 
 hear. 
 
 " In this place," said he, " brethren should be reconciled, or 
 their offering of thanksgiving will not be pure. Will all who 
 feel enmity towards me come to this holy spot, and exchange 
 forgiveness ? " 
 
 He looked towards the conspirators, who gazed upon him 
 with eager eyes, but did not move. They could not believe that 
 this appeal was intended for them, till he beckoned to them. 
 They advanced with hesitating steps — ^first one or two — then 
 several — ^then all ; and as they drew nearer they rushed upon 
 him, some kissing his hand, others kneeling and embracing his 
 knees. Bidding these arise, he said gently, but in a voice so 
 penetrating that it was heard in the farthest recess of the 
 building, 
 
 " I must have offended you, since you have conspired against 
 me; and you are very guilty towards me and your country. 
 May He who looks down with pity on the shameful strifes of 
 men, bear witness to our hearty forgiveness of each other ! Can 
 you with truth say Amen P — If not yet with truth, say it not tiE 
 you have heard me." 
 
 '' Amen ! " they cried, with a cry which was echoed first from 
 the roof of the church, and then by every voice beneath it which 
 was not choked with sobs. 
 
 " If you had had patience with me," said Toussaint, " you 
 would have found that I am above partiality in regard to race. 
 When I find men of your colour fit for office, they shall be 
 promoted to office as my friend Raymond was. I entreat you 
 henceforth to give me time ; to watch me, though closely, 
 generously ; and if I fail to satisfy you, to make your complaints 
 to myself. As for the past, let it be forgotten by all. Go to 
 your homes, and I trust no one will ever speak to you of this 
 day. As for myself, I must go where I am wanted. It may be 
 that I shall have to punish the leader of your colour, it he persists

 in disturbing the peace of the colony. But fear not that, if you 
 do not share in his ofPenoes, I shall impute them to you. It is 
 true that, however far off, my eye 'wiU be upon you, and my arm 
 stretched out over you ; but as long as you are faithful, this my 
 presence will be your protection. 5lter the blessing, the amnesiy 
 I have promised will be read. This, my act of forgiveness, is 
 sincere. Show that yours is so, I entreat, by cherishing the 
 peace of the colony. By the sanctity of the place on which we 
 stand, let there be peace among us all, and mutual forgiveness 
 for all time to come ! " 
 
 " Amen ! " again resounded, louder than the most joyous 
 strain of the choir that ever rang through the building. 
 
 L'Ouverture went back to his place, surrounded by the eleven 
 released men, for whom room was made round his person by 
 those who could best read his eye. After the priest had given 
 the blessing, the amnesty was read which declared pardon for aU 
 pohtical offences, and all personal offences against the Com- 
 mander-in-chief, up to that hour. The moment it was concluded, 
 those who had arrived at the church in custody, left it in freedom, 
 though in shame, and sped away to their several homes, as if the 
 death they had anticipated were at their heels. There they told 
 I heir wonderful tale to their families, turning the desolation of 
 wives and children into joy almost too great to be believed. 
 
 Afra found, to her satisfaction, that no one had entered to tell 
 Euphrosyne of this act of L'Ouverture. Euphrosyne had been 
 full of perplexity about the mulattoes — almost disposed to think 
 that the whole race must have suddenly gone mad. She had seen 
 them two hours before, flocking to church with faces whose gloom 
 contrasted strangely with their numbers, their holiday dresses, 
 and their eagerness to be in time to secure admittance. She 
 now saw them return, as if intoxicated with joy, cheering, the 
 whole length of the walk, and crying with an enthusiasm, if pos- 
 sible, surpassing that of the blacks, " Long live the Deliverer ! " 
 
 CHAPTER XVIII. 
 
 THE COTJNCIL OP FIVE. 
 
 A corNCiL was held one morning, soon after the events just 
 related, whose aspect would have perplexed an old colonist, if 
 he could have looked forward in vision to that day. In a shady 
 apartment of Toussaint's house at Pongaudin sat five men, in 
 whose hands lay the fortunes of the colony ; and only one of 
 these men was a white.

GOOD-TIDINGS. 1 73 
 
 The five came to report well to one another of the fortunes of 
 the colony. Never, in the old days, coiild any set of counsellors 
 have been gathered together, who could have brought with them 
 such proofs of the welfare and comfort of every class of inha- 
 bitants. In former times the colonial legislators were wont to 
 congratulate the Assembly on the good working of their system ; 
 which meant that the negroes were quiet, the mulattoes kept 
 under, and the crops promising ; but under this " good working " 
 there were the heart-burnings of the men of colour, the woes 
 and the depravity of the slaves, and the domestic fears and 
 discomforts of the masters, arising from this depravity. Now, 
 when there was no oppression and no slavery, the simple system 
 of justice was truly " working well " ; not only in the prospect 
 of the crops, and the external quiet of the proprietors, but in 
 the hearts and heads of every class of men — of perhaps every 
 family in the island. 
 
 Jacques Dessalines had arrived from St. Marc, near which 
 his estate lay. He had to tell how the handsome crescent of 
 freestone houses behind tlie quay was extending — how busy 
 were the wharves — how the storoliouses were overflowing — how 
 the sea was covered with merchant ships — and how the cheerful 
 hum of prosperous industry was heard the long day through. 
 
 Henri Christophe had come from the city of St. Domingo, 
 quite through the interior of the island. He had to tell how the 
 reinstated whites paid him honour as he passed, on account of 
 his friendship with L'Ouverture ; how the voice of song went 
 up from the green valleys, and from the cottage door ; how the 
 glorious AjHiibonite rolled its fuU tide round the base of mountains 
 which no longer harboured the runaway or the thief, and through 
 plains adorned with plenty, and smiling with peace. 
 
 M. Raymond arrived from the sittings of the Central As- 
 sembly. What good things he had to report will presently be 
 seen. 
 
 Toussaint, with M. Pascal, had arrived from Cap, where all 
 was at present quiet, and where he had done the best he could, 
 as he believed, by making Moyse a general, and leaving him in 
 charge of the town and district, till a person could be found fit 
 for the difficult and most anxious office of Governor of Cap. The 
 two most doubtful points of the colony were Port-au-Prince and 
 Cap Prancjais. They had been the great battle-grounds of races ; 
 they were the refuge of the discontented whites ; and they were 
 open to the operations of factious people from Prance. L'Ouver- 
 ture was never sure of the peace and quiet of Cap, as long as 
 French ships came and went ; but there was peace in the town 
 at the present moment ; and he had left that peace in the tem- 
 porary charge of one who had done much, under his eye, to 
 establish it — who had shown no small energy and talent, and

 who had every inducement that could be conceived to go through 
 his brief task well. Great had been Tonssaint's satisfaction in 
 offering to Moyse this honourable opportunity of distinguishing 
 himself ; and much had he enjoyed the anticipation of telling 
 Genifrede of this fulfilment of her lover's ambition, and of the 
 near approach of their union, in consequence. It is true, he had 
 been disappointed by Geuifrede's receiving this news with a 
 shudder, and by none but forced smiles having been seen from 
 her since ; but he trusted that this was only a fit of apprehension, 
 natural to one who loved so passionately, and that it would but 
 enhance the bliss that was to succeed. 
 
 If, as usual, L'Ouverture had to report the situation of Cap 
 Fran^ais as precarious, he brought good tidings of the South. An 
 express had met him on his journey homewards, with news of 
 the total defeat of the insurgent mulattoes by Vincent. Bigaud 
 had surrendered his designs, and had actually sailed, with his 
 principal officers, for Prance. Thus was the last torch of war 
 extinguished in the colony, and matters of peaceful policy alone 
 lay before this Council of Five. 
 
 The announcement of the entire pacification of the island was 
 the first made by L'Ouverture, when his friends and counsellors 
 looked eagerly to him for what he should say. 
 
 " Vincent is a fine fellow," said Dessalines, " and a credit to 
 his colour." 
 
 "He has been in the most pressing danger,'" observed Tous- 
 saint. " God willed that he should escape, when escape appeared 
 impossible." 
 
 " What is to be done now with these cowardly devils of mu- 
 lattoes P " asked Dessalines. 
 
 M. Pascal glanced at Raymond, to see how he bore this. 
 Raymond chanced to meet his eye, and replied to the glance. 
 
 " Tou will not take me for a cowardly mulatto, M. Pascal, if 
 I do not resent Dessaline's words. He is speaking of the rebels, 
 not of the many mulattoes who, like myself, disapprove and 
 despise all such jealousy of race as leads to the barbarism of 
 aggressive war." 
 
 " Yet," said Christophe, " I wish that we should all avoid 
 such language as provokes jealousy of race." 
 
 "In council one must speak plainly," replied Dessalines. 
 " I hope M. Pascal agrees with me ; for doubtless certain affairs 
 of the whites will be in question, with regard to which they may 
 be uncivilly spoken of. I was going to say, for instance (what 
 L'Ouverture's secretary ought to be able to bear), that if we wish 
 this state of peace to last, we must studiously keep the whites 
 down — exclude them from all situations of power and trust. 
 Tou aU know that, in my opinion, they ought every one to have 
 been done with some time ago. As that was not effected, the

 next best policy is to let them die out. One may compute pretty 
 well the time that this will take. If nothing better remains for 
 them here than to liye upon their estates, without a chance of 
 distinction, or of employment in public affairs.'they will grow 
 tired of the colony ; the next generation, at farthest, will be glad 
 to sell their property, and go home ; and we shall be rid of them." 
 
 " By that time, Jacques," said Toussaint, " yon and I may 
 find ourselves again in the midst of them, in a place whence we 
 cannot drive them out." 
 
 Dessalines' countenance told, as well as words could have 
 done, that heaven would be no heaven to him if the spirits of 
 white men were there. Toussaint well understood it, and 
 resumed, 
 
 " Better begin here what may be our work there — draw 
 closer, and learn from them the wisdom by which they have 
 been the masters of the world : while they may learn from us, if 
 they wiU, forgiveness of injuries." 
 
 " I am sick of hearing all that, Toussaint. It is for ever in 
 your mouth." 
 
 " Because it is for ever in my heart. Tou will hear it from 
 me, Jacques, till I see that there is no occasion to say it more. 
 As to Vincent, I propose to keep him, in token of honour, near 
 my person ; and to request the Central Assembly to decree to 
 him an estate of siich value as they shall think proper, to be 
 purchased from the public treasury." 
 
 '' That is, supposing he should desire to remain among us," 
 observed Christophe ; " but Vincent is fond of f ranee." 
 
 "Then his estate shall be in Prance, Henri. Our friend 
 Raymond will charge himself with this business in the As- 
 sembly." 
 
 " If I bring it forward in the form of a message from your- 
 self," replied Raymond, " there is no doubt of its being carried 
 by acclamation. The finances of the colony are flourishing, 
 and the attachment of the Assembly to your person most en- 
 thusiastic." 
 
 " What of the finances p " asked Toussaint. 
 
 Raymond gave from his notes a statement which showed that 
 both the customs' duties and internal taxes had been productive 
 beyond all expectation; that the merchant- ships of almost every 
 nation had visited the ports ; and that, after defraying the ex- 
 penses of the war now closed, there would be a sm-plus sufficient 
 for the extension of the schools and the formation of some new 
 roads. 
 
 " What of the attachment of the Assembly to L'Ouverfcure's 
 person ? " asked Christophe. 
 
 " Every member of it sees that the prosperity of the island is 
 the consequence of the vigorous prosecution of his system ; and

 that there is no security but in its unquestioned continuance. 
 The Commander-in-chief having been thus proved as eminently 
 fitted for civil as for military government, the Assembly proposes 
 to constitute him president of the colony for life, with power to 
 choose his successor, and to appoint to all offices." 
 
 All eyes were now fixed upon Toussaint. He observed that 
 a dark cloud must have hidden France from the eyes of the 
 Assembly, when they framed this proposition of independent 
 sovereignty. 
 
 Raymond had no doubt that France would agree to have her 
 colony governed in the best possible manner. If there should 
 be a difficulty about the title of president, that of governor 
 might be substituted. The power being the same, there need 
 not be a quarrel about the title. The Assembly would yield 
 that point — probably the only one that France would dispute. 
 
 M. Pascal believed that France would never yield the power 
 of appointing to offices of importance for life ; still less that of 
 choosing a successor. 
 
 " France ought not to yield such powers," said Toussaint ; 
 " and the Assembly ought not to bring upon me (representative 
 as I am of my i"ace) the imputation of a personal ambition which 
 I abjure and despise. I could tell the Assembly that, if I had 
 chosen to stoop under the yoke of personal ambition, I might 
 have been sovereign of this island without waiting for their call. 
 Yes," he continued, in answer to the inquiring looks of his 
 friends, " I have in my possession a treaty proposed to me by the 
 British Government, in which the English ofEer to make me king 
 of this island — in such case to be called by its ancient name of 
 Hayti — on condition of exclusive commerce." 
 
 " Is it even so ? " exclaimed Ohristophe. 
 
 ' Even so, Henri. The English believed that I had acted on 
 my own account ; and that we, the children of France, should 
 turn against our mother in the day of her perplexity, and join 
 hands with her foes." 
 
 "Any other man would have done it," said M. Pascal. 
 
 " No, Pascal ; no man who was appointed, like me, to redeem 
 nis race." 
 
 "How do you consider that you wiU injure your race by 
 accepting the proposal of the Assembly? " asked M. Pascal. " I 
 understand why you would accept nothing from the hands of the 
 English ; and also why you would hesitate to assume a power 
 which the government at home would doubtless disallow. But 
 how would your race be injured by honours paid to you ? " 
 
 " Tou are my friend," replied Toussaint. " Is it possible 
 that you can fail to understand ? " 
 
 "I call myself your friend too," said Dessalines, "and 1 
 declare I can comprehend nothing of it."

AN OPPORTUNITY REJECTED. 1 77 
 
 " Tour prejudices on one point are strong, Jacques ; and pre- 
 judice is blind. M. Pascal is singularly unprejudiced : and 
 therefore I believed that he would understand me." 
 
 " Perhaps I do : but I wish to hear your reasons from yonr- 
 
 " Particularly,'' interposed Raymond, " as to whether you 
 believe the blacks (who are, we know, your first object) would 
 be more benefited by continued connection with Prance or by 
 independence. I believe M. Pascal is unprejudiced enough to 
 bear the discussion of even this point." 
 
 " It is that which I wish to understand clearly," observed M. 
 Pascal. 
 
 " Whether, if I believed my race would be benefited by the 
 independence of this island, I could answer it to my conscience 
 to separate from Prance," said Toussaint, " we need not decide, 
 as I am convinced that, amidst all the errors committed under 
 the orders of government, it is best for us to remain in connection 
 with France. The civilization of the whites is the greatest 
 educational advantage we could enjoy. Tes, Jacques ; and the 
 more we despise it, the more we prove that we need it. The 
 next great reason for remaining faithful is that we owe it to the 
 white inhabitants of the colony not to deprive them of their 
 connection with Paris, on the one hand, nor of their liberty to 
 live and prosper here, on the other. As regards my own peculiar 
 position, I feel that my first duty is to present an example of 
 reverence and affection for my country, and not of a selfish am- 
 bition. I may have other personal reasons also, tending to the 
 same conclusion." 
 
 " Some favourite passages in Epictetus, perhaps, or in the 
 Bible," said Jacques : " some reasons confirmed by the whispers 
 of the priests. Nothing short of priestly influence could blind 
 you to such an opportunity as we now have of disembarrassing 
 ourselves of the whites for ever." 
 
 " Patience, Jacques ! " said Toussaint, smiling. 
 
 " I believe," said Christophe, " that there is neither book nor 
 priest in the case. I believe that it is your peculiar feeling 
 towards Bonaparte, Toussaint, which strengthens your affection 
 for France." 
 
 Christophe saw, by a glance at his friend's countenance, that 
 he was right. 
 
 " I should act as you do," Henri continued, " if I were certain 
 of a full and generous reciprocity of feeling on the part of the 
 government and of Bonaparte. But I have no such confidence." 
 
 " Hear him ! " cried Dessalines and Raymond. 
 
 " Tou were not wont to doubt Bonaparte, Henri," observed 
 Toussaint. 
 
 " Because, tUl of late, there was no reason to doubt him. \

 BtUl believe that he was in earnest at the outset, in his professed 
 desire to serve Prance for the sake of Prance, and not for his 
 own. But I believe that he has a head less strong than yours ; 
 that we shall see him transformed from the pacificator into the 
 aggressor — that, instead of waiting upon his pleasure, we may 
 have to guard against injury from him." 
 
 " These words from the generous Henri," said Toussaint, " are 
 portentous." 
 
 " I may be wrong, Toussaint. God grant, for the sake of the 
 liberties of the world, that I may be proved mistaken ! But, in 
 the hour of choice between your sovereignty and continued 
 dependence, you must not suppose the sympathy between the 
 First of the Whites and the First of the Blacks to be greater 
 than it is." 
 
 Toussaint could have told how Henri's words only confirmed 
 misgivings as to the public virtues of Bonaparte, which had long 
 troubled his secret soul. 
 
 " Are you willing," he asked of M. Pascal, " to tell us your 
 anticipations as to the career of the First Consul ? Do not speak, 
 if you prefer to be silent." 
 
 " I cannot predict confidently," replied Pascal ; ',' but I 
 should not be surprised if we see Bonaparte imable to resist the 
 offer of sovereignty. Once crowned, and feeling himself stiU 
 compelled to speak incessantly of the good of his country, his 
 views of good will become debased. He wiU invest Prance with 
 military glory, and sink into ruin by becoming a conqueror ; — 
 a vulgar destiny, in tliis age — a destiny which Alexander himself 
 would pi-obably scorn, if now born again into the world." 
 
 " Alas ! my poor blacks, if this be indeed Bonaparte ! " 
 exclaimed Toussaint. " Their supreme need is of peace ; and 
 they may become the subjects of a conqueror." 
 
 "And happy if they be no worse than subjects," said 
 Christophe. 
 
 " If," said Toussaint, " Bonaparte respects the liberties of the 
 French no more than to reduce them from being a nation to 
 being an army, he wUl not respect the liberties of the blacks, 
 and wiU endeavour to make them once more slaves." 
 
 " Ah ! you see ! " exclaimed Dessalines. 
 
 " I neither see nor believe, Jacques. We are only speculating. 
 I will be thoroughly faithful to my allegiance, till Bonaparte is 
 unquestionably unfaithful to the principles by which he rose. 
 At the moment, however, wlieu he lifts his finger in menace of 
 the liberties of the blacks, I will declare myself the Champion 
 of St. Domiugo; — not, however, through the offices of the 
 English, but by the desire of those whom I govern." 
 
 " Say King of Hayti," exclaimed Christophe. " This island 
 was Hayti, when it lay blooming in the midst of the ocean, fresh

 from the will of God, thi-onged with gentle beings who had never 
 lifted up a hand against each other. It was Hayti when it 
 received, as into a paradise, the first whites who came into our 
 hemisphere, and who saw in our valleys and plains the Eden of 
 the Scripture. It became St. Domingo when vice crept into it, 
 and oppression turned its music into sighs, and violence laid it 
 waste with famine and the sword. While the blacks and whites 
 yet hate each other, let it be still St. Domingo : but when you 
 withdraw us from jealousy and bloodshed, let it again be Hayti. 
 While it holds its conquered name there will be heart-burnings. 
 If it became our own Hayti, we might not only forgive, but 
 forget. It would be a noble lot to be King of Hayti ! " 
 
 " If so ordained, Henri. We must wait till it be so. My 
 present clear duty is to cultivate peace, and the friendship of 
 the whites. They must have their due from us, from Bonaparte 
 himself, to the youngest infant in Cap. You may trust me, 
 however, that from the hour that there is a whisper about slavery 
 in the lightest of Bonaparte's dreams, I will consent to be called 
 by whatever name can best defend our race." 
 
 " It will be too late then," said Dessalines. " Why wait till 
 Bonaparte tells you his dreams ? We know, without being told, 
 that all the dreams of all whites are of our slavery." 
 
 "Tou are wrong, Jacques. That is no more true of all 
 «rliites, than it is true of all blacks that they hate the whites as 
 you do." 
 
 " Tou wiU. find too late that I am not wrong," said Jacques. 
 " Remember, in the day of our ruin, that my timely advice to 
 you was to send for your sons from Paris, and then avow 
 yourself King of St. Domingo — or of Hayti, if you like that name 
 better. To me that name tells of another coloured race, whom 
 the whites wantonly oppressed and destroyed. One cannot 
 traverse the island without hearing the ghosts of those poor 
 Indians, from every wood and every hiU, calling to us for 
 vengeance on their conquerors." 
 
 " Take care how you heed those voices, Dessalines," said 
 Christophe. " They are not the voices of the gentle Indians 
 that you hear ; for the whites who injured them are long ago 
 gone to judgment." 
 
 " And if they were stiU in the midst of us," said Toussaint, 
 ■' vengeance is not ours. Jacques knows that my maxim in the 
 field — my order, which may not be transgressed — is, no 
 EETAXIATION ! I will have the same rule obeyed in my council- 
 chamber, as we all, I trust, observe it in our prayers. Jacques, 
 you have not now to learn my principle and my command — no 
 RETALIATION. Have you ever Imown it infringed, since the hour 
 when you found me at Breda, and made me your chief ? " 
 
 '•Never."

 " Nor shall you while I am obeyed. If the hour for defence 
 comes we shall be ready. Till then we owe allegiance." 
 
 " Ton will find it too late," Dessalines said, once more. 
 
 " The Assembly," said Toussaint to Raymond, " will withdraw 
 their proposition regarding my being President of this island. 
 I have all needful power as Oommander-in-chief of the colony." 
 
 " They have already published their request," said Raymond ; 
 " which I do not regret, because " 
 
 '' I regret it much," said Toussaint. " It will incense France.'' 
 
 " I do not regret it," pursued Raymond, "because it renders 
 necessary the publication of your refusal, which cannot but 
 satisfy France." 
 
 " On the point of Toussaint's supposed ambition it may satisfy 
 France," observed Ohristophe. " But if Bonaparte be jealous of 
 the influence of the First of the Blacks, this homage of the 
 Assembly will not abate his jealousy." 
 
 " Have you more messages for us, Raymond ? — No. Then M. 
 Pascal and I will examine these reports, and prepare my replies. 
 This our little council is memorable, friends, for being the first 
 in which we could report of the entire pacification of the colony. 
 May it be only the first of many ! My friends, our council is 
 ended."

 Pkecious to the statesman are the moments he can snatch for 
 the common pleasures which are strewed over the earth— meant, 
 apparently, for the perpetual enjoyment of all its inhabitants. 
 The chUd gathers flowers in the meadow, or runs up and dovra 
 a green bank, or looks for birds' nests every spring day. The 
 boy and girl hear the lark in the field and the linnet in the wood, 
 as a matter of course : they walk beside the growing com, and 
 pass beneath the rookery, and feel nothing of its being a privi- 
 lege. The sailor beholds the stars every bright nigkt of the 
 year, and is familiar with the thousand hues of the changing sea. 
 The soldier on his march sees the sun rise and set on mountain 
 and valley, plain and forest. The citizen, pent up in the centre 
 of a wide-built town, has his hour for play with his little ones, 
 his evenings for his wife and his friends. But for the statesman, 
 none of these are the pleasures of every day. Week after week, 
 month after month, he can have no eyes for the freshness of 
 nature, no leiswe for small affairs, or for talk about things which

 cannot be called affairs at aU. He may gaze at pictures on his 
 walls, and hear music from the drawing-room, in the brief 
 intervals of his labours ; and he may now and then be taken by 
 surprise by a glimpse of the cool bright stars, or by the waving 
 of the boughs of some neighbouring tree. He may be beguiled 
 by the grace or the freak of some little child, or struck by some 
 wandering flower scent in the streets, or some efEeot of sanlight 
 on the evening cloud. But with these few and rare exceptions, 
 he loses sight of the natural earth, and of its free intercourses, 
 for weeks and months together ; and precious in proportion- 
 precious beyond its utmost anticipation — are his hours of holiday 
 when at length they come. He gazes at the crescent moon 
 hanging above the woods, and at the long morning shadows on 
 the dewy grass, as if they would vanish before his eyes. He is 
 intoxicated with the gurgle of the brook upon the stones, when 
 he seeks the trout stream with his line and basket. The whir- 
 ring of the wild bird's wing upon the moor, the bursting of the 
 chase from cover, the creaking of the harvest wain — the song of 
 the vine-dressers — the laugh of the olive-gatherers — in every 
 land where these sounds are heard, they make a child once more 
 of the statesman who may for once have come forth to hear them. 
 Sweeter still is the leisure hour with children in the garden or 
 the meadow, and the quiet stroll with wife or sister in the 
 evening, or the gay excursion during a whole day of liberty. If 
 Sunday evenings are sweet to the labourer whose toils involve 
 but little action of mind, how precious are his rarer holidays to 
 the state labourer, after the wear and tear of toil like his — after 
 his daily experience of intense thought, of anxiety, and fear ! In 
 the path of such should spring the freshest grass, and on their 
 heads should fall the softest of the moonlight, and the balmiest 
 of the airs of heaven, if natural rewards are in any proportion to 
 their purchase money of toil. 
 
 The choicest holiday moments of the great negro statesman 
 were those which he could spend with his wife and children, away 
 from observing eyes and listening ears. He was never long pent up 
 in the city, or detained by afEairs within the walls of his palace. 
 His business lay abroad, for the most part; and he came and 
 went continually, on horseback, throughout every part of the 
 island. Admirable as were his laws and regulations, and zealously 
 as he was served by his agents of every description, there was 
 no security for the working of his system so good as his own 
 frequent presence among the adoring people. The same love 
 which made him so powerful abroad interfered with his comfort 
 at home. There were persons ever on the watch for a glimpse 
 of him, eager to catch every word and every look : and the very 
 rarest of his pleasures was unwitnessed intercourse with his 
 family.

I §2 TBB HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 At length, wlien Hedouville was gone away from one port, 
 and Rigaud from another — when neither spy nor foe appeared to 
 remain — it seemed to be time for him, who had given peace and 
 leisure to everybody else, to enjoy a little of it himself. He 
 allowed his children, therefore, to fix a day when he should go 
 with them on a fishing excursion round the little island of 
 Gonaives, which was a beautiful object from the windows of the 
 house at Pongaudin, as it lay in the midst of the bay. 
 
 The excursion had answered completely. General Vincent, 
 leaving the south of the island in a state of perfect tranquillity, 
 had arrived to enjoy his honours in the presence of L'Ouverture 
 and his family. Madame Dessaliues had come over from St. 
 Marc. As Afra was of the party, M. Pascal had found it pos- 
 sible to leave his papers for a few hours. Toussaint had caught 
 as many fish as if he had been Paul himself. He had wandered 
 away with his girls into the wood, tiU he was sent to the boats 
 again by the coimtry people who gathered about him; and he 
 lay hidden with Denis under the awning of the barge, playing 
 duck and drake on the smooth water, till the islandei's found out 
 where he was, and came swimming out, to spoil their sport. It 
 was a day too soon gone : but yet he did not consider it ended 
 when they landed at Pongaudin, at ten o'clock. The moon was 
 high, the gardens looked lovely ; and he led his wife away from 
 the party, among the green alleys of the shrubbery. 
 
 "I want to know what you think," exclaimed Madame 
 L'Ouverture, as they emerged from a shaded walk upon a grass 
 plot, on which the light lay, clear and strong — " I want to ask 
 you " — and as she spoke, she looked round to see that no one 
 was at hand — " whether you do not think that General Yincent 
 loves Aimee." 
 
 " I think he does. I suspected it before, and to-dav I am sure 
 of it." 
 
 " And are not you glad ? " 
 
 " That partly depends on whether Aimee loves him. I doubt 
 whether Vincent, who is usually a confident fellow enough, is ao 
 happy about the matter as you are." 
 
 " Aim^e is not one who will ever show herself too ready 
 
 Aimee is very quiet " 
 
 " Well, but, is she ready in her heart ? Does she care about 
 Vincent ? " 
 
 " I do not knowthat she does qviite, yet— though I think she 
 likes him very much, too. But surely she will love him— she 
 must love him— so much as he loves her— and so delightful, so 
 desirable a match as it is, in every way ! " 
 
 " Ton think it so." 
 
 " Why, do not yon ? Consider how many years we have 
 known him, and what confidence you had in him when you sent

 him with our dear boys to Paris ! And now he has done great 
 things in the south. He comes, covered with glory, to ask us for 
 our Aimee. What could be more flattering ? 
 
 " It was our child's future happiness that I was thinking of, 
 when I seemed to doubt. Vincent is full of good qualities ; but 
 he is so wholly French that " 
 
 " Not so French as M. Pascal, who was bom, brought up, and 
 employed at Paris ; and you are pleased that he should marry 
 Afra." 
 
 " Vincent is more French than Pascal, though he is a black. 
 He is devoted to Bonaparte " 
 
 " What of that ? " said Madame L'Ouverture, after a pause. 
 " He is devoted to you also. And are you not yourself devoted to 
 France and to Bonaparte ? Do we not pray together for him 
 every day of our lives ? " 
 
 " Remember, Margot, to pray for him every day, as long as 
 you live, if I am separated from you by death or otherwise. 
 Pray that such a blessing may rest upon him as that he may be 
 wise to see his duty, and strong to do it. If he injures us, pray 
 that he may be forgiven." 
 
 " I wiU," replied Margot, in a low voice ; " but — — " 
 
 She was lost in considering what this might mean. 
 
 "As for Vincent," resumed Toussaint, "my doubt is whether, 
 with his views and tastes, he ought to ally himself with a doomed 
 man." 
 
 " Vincent is ambitious, my dear husband ; and, even if he did 
 not love our child as he does, he might be anxious to ally himself 
 with one so powerful — so full of honours — with so very great a 
 man as you. I would not speak exactly so if we were not alone : 
 but it is very true, now that the Central Assembly has declared 
 you supi-eme in the colony. Consider what Vincent must think of 
 that ! And he has travelled so much in the island, that he must 
 have seen how you deserve all that is said of you. He has seen 
 how all the runaways have come down from the mountains, and 
 the pirates in from the reefs and the coves ; and how they are 
 all honestly cultivating the fields, and fishing in the bays. He 
 has seen how rich the whole island is growing ; and how con- 
 tented, and industrious, and honest, the people are, in this short 
 time. He has seen that all this is your work : and he may well 
 be ambitious to be your son-in-law." 
 
 " Unless he has the foresight to perceive, with all this, that 1 
 am a doomed man." 
 
 " I thought you said so — I thought I heard that word before,'' 
 said Margot, in a trembling voice ; " but I could not believe it." 
 
 Toussaint knew by her tone that some vague idea of evil 
 agency — some almost forgotten superstition was crossing her 
 imagination : and he hastened to explain.

184 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " Do not imagine," said he, solemnly, " do not for a moment 
 suppose that God is not on onr side — that He will for a moment 
 forsake us. But it is not always His pleasure that His servants 
 should prosper, though their good work prospers in the end. I 
 firmly trust and beliere that our Father will not permit us to be 
 made slaves again ; but it may be His will that I and others 
 should fall in defending our freedom." 
 
 " But the wars are at an end. Tour battles are all over, my 
 loTe." 
 
 "How can we be sure of that, when Bonaparte has yet to learn 
 what the Assembly has done P H^douviUe is on the way home, 
 eager to report of the blacks, while he is ignorant of their minds, 
 and prejudiced about their conduct. M. Papalier and other 
 planters are at Paris, at the ear of Bonaparte, while his ear is 
 already so quickened by jealousy, that it takes in the lightest 
 whisper against me and my race. How can we say that my 
 battles ai-e over, love, when every new success and honour makes 
 this man, who ought to be my brother, yet more ray foe ? " 
 
 " Oh, write to him ! Write to him, and tell him how you 
 would have him be a brother to you ! " 
 
 " Have I not written twice, and had no reply but neglect ? 
 I wrote to him to announce the earliest prospect of entire peace. 
 I wrote again, to explain my intercourse with his agent Roume, 
 and requested his sanction of what I had done. There has been 
 no reply." 
 
 " Then write again. Write this very night ! " 
 
 " I wrote yesterday, to inform him fully concerning the new 
 constitution framed by the Assembly. I told him that it should 
 be put in force provisionally, till the pleasure of his government 
 is made known." 
 
 " Oh, then, that must bring an answer." 
 
 Toussaint was sUent. 
 
 " He must send some sort of answer to that," pursued Margot. 
 " What answer do you think it will be P " 
 
 " Ton remember the great esigle that I shot, when we lived 
 nuder the mountains, Margot P Do you remember how the kids 
 played in the pasture, with the shadow of that huge eagle floating 
 above them P ' 
 
 Margot, trembling, pressed closer to her husband's side. 
 
 " Tou saw to-day," he continued, " that troop of gay dolphins, 
 in the smooth sea beyond the island. Tou saw the shark, with 
 its glaring eyes, opening its monstrous jaws, as it rose near the 
 pretty creatures, and hovered about them." 
 
 " But you shot the eagle," cried Margot ; "and Denis wounded 
 the shark." 
 
 " Heaven only knows how it may end with us," said Toussaint ; 
 " but we have the shadow of Bonaparte's jealousy over us, and

 danger all about us. The greater our prosperity, the more certain 
 is it to bring all France down upon us." 
 
 " Oh, can Bonaparte be so cruel ? " 
 
 " I do not blame him for this our danger ; and any future woe 
 must all go to the account of our former slavery. We negroes are 
 ignorant, and have been made loose, deceitful, and idle, by 
 slavery. The whites have been made tyrannical and unjust, by 
 being masters. They believe us now ambitious, rebellious, and 
 revengeful, because it would be no wonder if we were so. All 
 this injustice comes of our former slavery. God forbid that 
 I should be unjust too, and lay the blame where it is not 
 due ! For nothing done or feared in St. Domingo do I blame 
 Bonaparte." 
 
 " Then you think — Oh ! say you think there is no danger for 
 Placide and Isaac. Bonaparte is so kind to them! Surely 
 Placide and Isaac can be in no danger ! " 
 
 " There is no fear for their present safety, my love." 
 
 Toussaint would not for the world have told of his frequent 
 daily thought and nightly dream, as to what might be the fate of 
 these hostages, deliberately sent to France, and deliberately left 
 there now. He would not subject himseK to entreaties respecting 
 their return which he dared not listen to, now that their recall 
 would most certainly excite suspicions of the fidelity of the 
 blacks. Not to save his children would L'Ouverture do an act 
 to excite or confirm any distrust of his people. 
 
 " Bonaparte is kind to them, as you say, Margot. And if 
 Vincent should win our Aimee, that wiU be another security for 
 the lads ; for no one doubts his attachment to France." 
 
 " I hope Vincent will win her. But when will you send for 
 the boys? They have been gone very long. When will you send P' 
 
 " As soon as affairs will allow. Do not urge me, Margot. I 
 think of it day and night." 
 
 "Then there is some danger. Tou would not speak so if 
 there were not. Oh ! my husband ! marry Vincent to Aimde ! 
 Tou say that will be a security." 
 
 " We must not forget Aim§e herself, my love. If she should 
 hereafter find her heart torn between her lover and her parents 
 — if the hour should come for every one here to choose between 
 Bonaparte and me, and Vincent should still adore the First of 
 the Whites, what will become of the chihi of the First of the 
 Blacks P Ought not her parents to have foreseen such a 
 struggle ? " 
 
 " Alas ! what is to become of us all, Toussaint ? " 
 
 " Perhaps G^nifrede is the happiest of our children, Margot. 
 She looks anxious to-day ; but in a few more days, I hope even 
 her trembling heart will be at rest." 
 
 " It never will," said Margot, mournfully. '' I think there is

 some evil influence upon our poor child, to afflict her with per- 
 petual fear. She still fears ghosts, rather than fear nothing. 
 She enjoys nothing, except when Moyse is by her side." 
 
 " Well, Moyse wiU presently be by her side ; and for life. — 
 I was proud of him, Margot, last week, at Cap. I knew his 
 military talents, from the day when we used to call the boy 
 General Moyse. I saw by his eye, when I announced him as 
 Genera] Moyse in Cap, that he remembered those old days on 
 the north shore. Oh, yes, I was aware of his talents in that 
 direction, from his boyhood ; but I found in him power of an- 
 other kind. Ton know what a passionate loTer he is." 
 
 " Tes, indeed. Never did I see such a lover ! " 
 
 "Well, he puts this same power and devotedness into his 
 occupation of the hour, whatever it may be." 
 
 " Do you mean that he forgets G«nifrede, when he is away 
 from her p " 
 
 " I rather hope that it is the remembrance of her that animates 
 him in his work. I'm sure that it is so ; for I said a few words 
 to him about home, which made him very happy. If I were to 
 see him failing, as we once feared he would — if I saw him 
 yielding to his passions — to the prejudices and passions of the 
 negro and the slave, my reproof would be, ' Tou forget Geni- 
 f rede.' Moyse has yet much to learn — and much to overcome ; 
 yet I look upon G&ifrede as pei-haps the most favoured of oui 
 children. It is so great a thing to be so beloved ! " 
 
 " It is indeed the greatest thing." Margot stopped, as a turn 
 in the walk brought them in view of the house. The long 
 ranges of verandah stood in the moonlight, checkered with the 
 stiU shadows of the neighbouring trees. Every window of the 
 large white mansion gave out a stream of yellow light, to con- 
 trast with the silvery shining of the moon. " This is very unlike 
 the hut we went to when we were married, Toussaint. Yet I 
 was quite happy and contented. It is indeed the greatest thing 
 to be loved." 
 
 " And have you not that greatest thing here too ? Do I not 
 love you, my Margot P " 
 
 " Oh, yes ! Tes, indeed, we love each other as much as we did 
 then — in that single room, with its earthen floor, and its cribs 
 against the wall, and the iron pot in the fire-place, and the hen 
 pecking before the door. But, Toussaint, look at the difEerence 
 now ! Look at this beautiful house, and aU the gardens and 
 cane-pieces— and think of our palace at Port-au-Prince — and 
 think of the girls as they look at church, or in the boat to-day — 
 and how the country is up, rejoicing, wherever you go — and now 
 the Assembly consider you — think of all that has happened since, 
 the wedding-dfl,y of ours at Breda ! It is so fine — so wonderful, 
 that you shall not frighten me about anything that can happen.

THE COTTAGE AND THE COURT. 187 
 
 I am sure the blessing of God is upon you, my husband ; and you 
 shall not make me afraid." 
 
 "I would have none be afraid while God reigns, Margot. 
 May yon ever say that you will not fear ! The blessing of God 
 may be on us now, love ; but it was never more so than when 
 we went home to our hut at Breda. When I lay under the 
 treesat noon, taking care of the cattle, how many things I used 
 to think of to say to you when I came homo ! " 
 
 " And so did I, as I kneeled at my washing by the brook-side, 
 and you were driving M. Bayou, twenty miles off, and were 
 expected home in the evening. How much there was to say at 
 the end of those days ! " 
 
 _ " It was not for ourselves then, Margot, that we have been 
 raised to what we are. We were as happy drawing water in 
 the wood, and gathering plantains in the negro-grounds, as we 
 have ever been in these shrubberies. We were as merry in that 
 single room at Breda as in this mansion, or in our palace. It is 
 not for our own sakes that we have been so raised." 
 
 " It is pleasant for our children." 
 
 "It is. And it is good for ou. race. It is to make us their 
 servants. Oh! Margot, if ever you find a thought of pride 
 stirring at your heart, remember that if the blacks were less 
 ignorant and more wise, it would not matter whether we lived 
 as we used to do, or as we live now. It is because we negroes 
 are vain and corrupted, that show and state are necessary : and 
 the sight of our show and state should, therefore, humble us." 
 
 " 1 am sure you are not fond of show and state. Ton eat and 
 drinli, and wait upon yourself, as you did at Breda ; and your 
 uniform is the only fine dress you like to wear. I am sure you 
 had rather have no court." 
 
 " Very true. I submit to such state as we have about us, for 
 the sake of the negroes who need it. To me it is a sacrifice ; 
 but, Margot, we must make sacrifices — ^perhaps some which you 
 may little dream of, while looking round upon our possessions, 
 and our rank, and our children, worshipped as they are. We 
 must carry the same spirit of sacrifice into all our acts ; and be 
 ready to suffer, and perhaps to fall, for the sake of the blacks. 
 The less pride now, Margot, the less shame and sorrow then ! " 
 
 " I wish not to be proud," said Margot, trembling — " I pray 
 
 that I may not be proud ; but it is difiicult Hark ! there is a 
 
 footstep ! Let us turn into this alley." 
 
 " Nay," said Toussaint ; " it is M. Pascal. No doubt I am 
 wanted." 
 
 " For ever wanted ! " exclaimed Margot. " No peace ! " 
 
 " It was not so at Breda," said Toussaint, smiling. " I was 
 just speaking of sacrifice, you know : and this is not the last 
 Kight that the moon wiU shine. — News, M. Pascal P " 
 


## p. (#192) ################################################

1 88 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " News from Cap," replied M. Pascal, in a depressed tone. 
 " Bad news ! Here are dispatches. Not a moment is to be 
 lost." 
 
 " There is Ught enough," said Toussaint, turning bo that the 
 moonlight fell upon the page. 
 
 While he read, M. Pascal told Madame L'Ouverture that 
 messengers had brought news of a quarrel at Cap — a quarrel 
 between the races, unhappily, about HedouTille's proclamation 
 again; — a quarrel in which several whites had been killed. 
 AH was presently quiet ; but the whites were crying out for 
 vengeance. 
 
 " No peace, as you say, Margot," observed Toussaint, when 
 he had run over the letters. " See what a strong hand and 
 watchful eye our poor people require ! The curse of slavery is 
 still upon us." 
 
 " How is Moyse ? Tell me only that. What is Moyse 
 doing?" 
 
 " I do not understand Moyse, nor what he is doing," said 
 Toussaint gloomily. " M. Pascal " 
 
 " Tour horses are coming round," said Pascal, " and I shall 
 be there almost as soon as you." 
 
 " Eight : and Laxabon. From me, ask the favour of Father 
 Laxabon to follow without delaj . Margot, take care of poor 
 G^nifrede. PareweU ! " 
 
 As he passed through the piazi,d, to mount his horse, Tous- 
 saint saw Genif rede standing there, like a statue. He embraced 
 her, and found her cold as marble. He returned to his family 
 for an instant, to beg that she might not be immediately dis- 
 turbed. In an hour or two she might be able to speak to her 
 mother or sister ; and she could not now. Once more he whis- 
 pered to her that he would send her early news, and was gone. 
 
 Again and again Aimee looked timidly forth, to see if she 
 might venture to approach her sister. Once Madame L'Ouver- 
 ture went to her, and once Therese ; but she would say nothing 
 but " Leave me ! " Prom her they went to Afra, who wept 
 incessantly, though she did not reject their consolations. The 
 night wore on wearily and drearily. When the moon set, and 
 the damps were felt wherever the air penetrated, Madame 
 L'Ouverture went once more to Genifrede, determined to take 
 her to her own chamber, and win her to open her heart. But 
 Genifrede was not there, nor in her chamber. The mother's 
 terror was great, till a cultivator came to say that Mademoiselle 
 L'Ouverture had gone a journey, on horseback, with her brother 
 Denis to take care i)f her. Denis's bed was indeed found empty: 
 and two horses were gone from the stables. They had fled to 
 Moyse, no doubt. The hope was that they might fall in with 
 Father Laxabon on the road, who would surely bring the poor

 girl back. There was another road, however : and by this road 
 Th&ese declared that she would follow. 
 
 " Tes, yes — go ! " exclaimed Madame L'OuYortnre. " She 
 will heed you, if any one. She thinks you understand her. She 
 says " 
 
 " She loves me," said Therese, sighing, " because 1 hardly 
 
 know ^but Heaven forgive me, if it be as she says !" 
 
 " She says you hate the whites," declared Aimie. "If it be 
 so, may indeed Heaven forgive you ! Moyse hates the whites : 
 and you see how wi'etched we are ! " 
 
 " Aim&, do not be hard. We are made to love — my heart 
 inclines to all who are about me : — but if there are some — if 
 one cannot — Oh, Aim^e, do not be hard ! " 
 
 " It is those who hate who are hard," said Aimde, whose tears 
 fell fast, in sympathy with Afra's. " Is it not so, Afra ? " 
 
 " Well, I will go," said Therese, gently. " One kiss, Aimi^e, 
 for Genifrede's saie ! " 
 
 " For your own," said Aimee, tenderly embracing her. " Bring 
 back poor Grenifrede! Tell her we will devote ourselves to her." 
 
 " Bring back my child," said Margot. " Be sure you tell her 
 that there may be good news yet. Moyse may have explanations 
 to give ; — he may do great things yet." 
 
 These words renewed Afra's weeping, in the midst of which 
 Therese hastened away : when the remnant of the anxious family 
 retired to their chambers, not to sleep, but to pray and wait. 
 
 CHAPTER XX. 
 
 PEEPLBXITY. 
 
 As it might be supposed, M. Revel and his grandchild had no 
 desire to remain in Government-house a moment longer than 
 was necessary, as Afra was obliged to leave it. Afra's last care, 
 before quitting Cap, was to see that her friends were properly 
 escorted to their home. 
 
 Euphrosyne was still struggling with the grief of saying fare- 
 well to Afra, when she entered the pleasant sitting-room at 
 home ; but she smiled through her tears when she saw how 
 cheerful it looked. There was a mUd, cool light in the room, 
 proceeding from the reflection of the evening sunshine from the 
 trees of the convent garden. The blinds were open; and the 
 perspective of one of the alleys was seen in the large mirror on 
 the wall — the shrubs noiselessly waving, and the gay flowers 
 nodding, in a sunlight and breeze which were not felt within. 
 Euphrosyne's work lay upon the table ; the needle sticking in

 the very stiteh of embroidery at which she had laid it down, 
 wheu she went to see if her grandfather was awake, on the 
 morning of their alarm. Some loose music had been blown down 
 from the stand upon the floor ; and the bouquet of flowers was 
 dead, the water dried up, and the leaves fallen to dust; but 
 when these were removed, there were no further signs of neglect 
 and desertion. 
 
 " How bright, how natural everything looks ! " cried Euphro- 
 syne. " I do love this room. This is the place that we thought 
 was to be sacked and burnt ! I won't believe such nonsense 
 another time. I never will be frightened again. Grandpapa, 
 do not you love this room P " 
 
 " It is a pretty room, my dear ; and it looks very bright when 
 you are in it." 
 
 " Oh, thank you ! " she cried, dropping a sportive curtsey. 
 
 " And now, will you look] at my work (sit down here) — and 
 
 tell me — (where are your glasses ? ) — tell me whether you ever 
 saw a prettier pattern. It is a handkerchief fit for a princess." 
 
 " It is very prettily worked, my dear. And whom is it for ? 
 Some very elegant lady. Is it for the First Consul's lady ? They 
 say she is the most elegant lady in the world — though she is a 
 Creole, like you, my darling. Is your pretty handkerchief for her ?" 
 
 " No, grandpapa. I dare say she has all the ladies in France 
 to work for her. I should like, if you have no objection, to send 
 this to Madame L'Ouverture ! " 
 
 " To Madame L'Ouverture. Vf hy P Has not she daughters 
 to work handkei-chiefs for her, and plenty of money to buy them ? 
 Why should you prick your fingers in her service P " 
 
 " I should like that L'Ouverture himself should observe, some 
 day, that she has a beautiful handkerchief ; and then, if he should 
 ask, he would find out that there is a little Creole girl who is 
 very grateful to him for his generosity to her colour." 
 
 "Do not speak of colour, child. Wliat expressions jou pick 
 up from Af ra, and such people ! It is our distinction that we 
 Imve no colour — that we are white." 
 
 " That is the distinction of the nuns, I know ; but I hoped it 
 was not mine yet. I do not forget how you pinch my cheek 
 sometimes, and talk about roses." 
 
 " What is there ? What do I see P " cried the old man, whose 
 mind seemed open to everything agreeable that met his obser- 
 vation, on his return home. " Are those the same little birds 
 that you were wooing the other morning ? No creature that has 
 ever seen you, my dear, ever forgets you. Nothing that you 
 have spoken to ever deserts you. Shy creatures, that are afraid 
 of everybody else, haunt you." 
 
 " Oh ! you are thinking of the little spotted fawn." 
 
 " Spotted fawn or squirrel — baby or humming-bird — it is

 always the same, child. They all come to you. I dare say these 
 little creatures have been flitting about the balcony and these 
 rooms, ever since we went away. Now they have found you." 
 
 " They do not seem to care much about me, now we have met," 
 said Euphrosyne. She followed them softly to the balcony, and 
 along it, as far as the window of M. Revel's room. There she 
 found, stuck in the bars of the balcony, a rather fresh branch 
 of orange-blossoms. While she was examining this, in some 
 surprise, old Raphael spoke to her from below. He said he had 
 made bold to climb up by his ladder, twice a day, with some- 
 thing to entice the birds to that window ; as he supposed that 
 was what she wi-shed, if she had been at home. The abbess had 
 given him leave to take this liberty. 
 
 " There ! " said M. Revel, when she flew to teU him, " there 
 is another follower to add to your fawns and kittens. Old 
 Raphael is considered a crusty fellow everywhere ; and you see 
 how different he is with you ! " 
 
 " I am very glad," declared Euphrosyne. " It is a pretty 
 sight to amuse you with, every morning when you wake. It is 
 kind of Raphael ; and of the abbess too." 
 
 " I am pleased that the abbess and you should be good friends, 
 
 Euphrosyne, because Ah ! that is the way," he said, in a 
 
 mortified tone, and throwing himself back in his chair, as he 
 followed with his eyes the flittings of the gii-1 about the room, 
 after her birds. " Tou have got your own way with everybody, 
 and we have spoiled you ; and there is no speaking to you upon 
 a subject that you do not like. Tou will not hear, though it is 
 a thing that lies heavy at the heart of a dying old man." 
 
 " I wiU hear you, if you talk to me all my life," said Euphro. 
 syne, with brimming eyes, seating herself on a low stool at the 
 old man's knees. 
 
 " And if you hear me, you will not give me a grave, steady 
 answer." 
 
 " Try me," said she, brushing away the gathering tears. " I 
 am not crying about anything you are going to say ; but only 
 
 because Oh, grandpapa ! how could you think I would not 
 
 listen to you ? " 
 
 " Well, well, my love ! I see that you are willing now. Tou 
 remember your promise to enter the convent, if I desired it." 
 
 " Tes." 
 
 " Tou talk of nothiDg being changed by our alarm, two days 
 ago, because this table stands in the middle of the room, and the 
 ants and beetles have not carried off your pretty work. Hey ! " 
 
 " May I speak, grandpapa ? " 
 
 " Speak." 
 
 " I said so because nobody's house is burnt, or even robbed ; 
 and nobody has been killed, or even hurt "

 " But, nevertheless, there is a great change. Oar friends, my 
 old friends, all whom I feel I could rely upon in case of need, 
 are gone to France with HMouviUe." 
 
 " Oh, grandpapa ! very few whites are gone — they were 
 chiefly mulattoes who went with Hedouville; and so many 
 whites remain ! And though they are not, except, perhaps, M. 
 Oritois, exactly our friends, yet we can easily make acquaintance 
 with them." 
 
 " BTo, no, child. If they were not upstarts, as some of them 
 are, and others returned emigrants, of whom I know nothing, it 
 IS too late now for me to make new friends. My old companions 
 are gone, and the place is a desert to me." 
 
 His hands hung listlessly, as he rested on the arms of his 
 chair. Euphrosyne looked up in his face, while she said, as well 
 as she could for tears, 
 
 " If you feel it so now, what wiU it be when I am shut up in 
 the convent, and you will hardly ever see me ? " 
 
 " That is no affair of yours, child. I choose that you should go." 
 
 " Whose affair is it, if it is not mine P I am your grandchild 
 — your only one ; and it is my business, and the greatest pleasure 
 I have in the world, to be with you, and wait upon you. If I 
 leave you, I shall hear my poor mother reproaching me all day 
 long. Every morning at my lessons, every night at my prayers, 
 I shall hear her saying, ' Where is your grandfather ? How dare 
 you desert him when he has only you left ? ' Grandpapa, I shall 
 be afraid to sleep alone. I shall learn to be afraid of my blessed 
 mother." 
 
 " It is time you were sent somewhere to learn your duty, I 
 think. We are at a bad pass enough ; but there must be some 
 one in the colony who can tell you that it is your duty to obey 
 your grandfather — that it is your duty to perform what you 
 promised him." 
 
 " I can preach that myself, grandpapa, when there is nobody 
 else who can do it better. It is just what I have been teaching 
 little Babet, this month past. I have no more to learn about 
 that ; but I win tell you what I do want to learn — whether you 
 
 are most afraid of my growing up ignorant, or (do just let 
 
 me finish, and then we shall agree charmingly, I dare say) — 
 whether you are most afraid of my growing up ignorant, or 
 unsteady, or ill-mannered, or wicked, or what ? As for being 
 unsafe, I do not believe a word of that." 
 
 " Everything — all these things, child. I am afraid of them all." 
 
 "What, all ! What a dreadfully unpromising creature I 
 must be ! " 
 
 " Tou know you must be very ignorant. You have had no 
 one to teach you anything." 
 
 " Then I will go to the conveiit to study for four, six, eight,

 twelve hours a day. I shall soon have learned everything in 
 the world at that rate : and yet I can go on singing to you in 
 the evenings, and bringing your coffee in the mornings. Twelve 
 hours' study a day may perhaps make me steady, too. That 
 was the next thing, was it not ? " 
 
 " Now have done. Say only one thing mere — ^that you will 
 perform your promise." 
 
 " That is a thing of course ; so I may just ask one other thing. 
 Who is to wait upon you in my place ? Ah ! I see you have 
 not fixed upon any one yet ; and, let me tell you, it will be no 
 easy matter to find one who makes coffee as I do. Then, yon 
 have been waited upon by a slave all your life. Yes, you have ; 
 and you have a slave now sitting at your knee. People do not 
 like being slaves now-a-days — nobody but me. Now I like it 
 of all things. So, what a pity to change ! " 
 
 " I know," said the old man, sighing, " that I am apt to be 
 peremptory. I know it is difiicult to please me sometimes. It 
 is very late in life — I am very old to set about improving : but 
 I will try not to hurt any one who will wait upon me, as I am 
 afraid I have often hurt you, my dear. I will make any effort, 
 if I can only feel that you are safe. Some one has been telling 
 you stories of old times, I see. Perhaps you can ask any servant 
 that we may engage — ^you may make it your request that she 
 will bear with me." 
 
 '' Oh, grandpapa ! Stop, grandpapa ! I cannot bear it," cried 
 the sobbing girl. " I never wiU joke again, if you do not see 
 that it is because I love you so, that I will venture anything 
 rather than leave you. We all love you dearly. Pierre would 
 not for the world live with anybody else. Tou know he would 
 not. And that is just what I feel. But I will do everything 
 you wish. I will never refuse again — I will never jest, or try, 
 even for your own sake, to prevent your having all your own 
 way. Only be so kind, grandpapa, as never to say anything 
 against yourself again. Nobody else would dare to do such a 
 thing to me, and I cannot bear it." 
 
 " Well, well, love ! I see now that no one has been babbling 
 to you. We will never quarrel any more. Tou will do as I 
 wish, and we will have no more disputing. Are they bringing 
 
 our coffee ? " _ j » .i. , 
 
 When Euphrosyne came out from placing her grandfather s 
 pillows, and bidding him good-night, she found Pierre lingering 
 about, as if wanting to speak to her. 
 
 " Have you anything to say to me, Pierre ? " 
 " Only just to take the liberty of asking. Mademoiselle, whether 
 you could not possibly gratify my master in the thing he has 
 set his heart upon. If you could, Mademoiselle, you may rely 
 on it, I would take every care of him in your absence."

 " I have no doubt, Pierre, of your doing your part." 
 
 " Tour part and mine are not the same, I know, Mademoiselle. 
 But he is so persuaded of there being danger for jon here, that 
 everything you do for him goes to his heart." 
 
 " Have you that idea, Pierre?" 
 
 " Indeed, Mademoiselle, I know nothing about it — more than 
 that it takes a long time for people in a town, or an island, to 
 live comfortably together, on equal terms, after having all their 
 lives looked upon one another as tyrants and low revengeful 
 servants." 
 
 " I do not think any one looks on me as a tyrant, or would 
 think of hurting poor grandpapa or me. How you shake your 
 head, Pierre ! We have lived seven years in peace and quiet — 
 sometimes being afraid, but never having found cause for fear. 
 However, if grandpapa really is uneasy " 
 
 " That is the point. Mademoiselle. He is so." 
 
 " Do you suppose I could see the abbess, if I were to go to 
 the convent to consult her ? It is not late." 
 
 " If the Dumonts were but here still ! " said Pierre — '' only 
 next door but one ! It was a comfort to have them at hand on 
 any difficulty." 
 
 " If they were here, I should not consult them. They were 
 so prejudiced against all the mulattoes, and put so little trust in 
 L'Ouverture himself — as indeed their going off in such a hurry 
 with HedouviUe proves — that I should not have cared for their 
 opinion to-night. Suppose you step to the convent, Pierre, and 
 ask whether the lady abbess could see me for half-an-hour on 
 business. If I am to leave grandpapa, I should like to tell him 
 in the morning that it is all settled." 
 
 Pierre went with alacrity, and was back in three minutes, 
 when he found Euphrosyne shawled and veiled for the visit. 
 The lady awaited her. 
 
 " What can I do for you, my child P " said the abbess, kindly 
 seating Euphrosyne beside her, in her parlour. 
 
 " Ton will teU me what you think it is my duty to do, when 
 I have told you my stoiy. I know I have laughed and joked 
 too much about this very matter ; and that partly because I had 
 a will of my own about it. But it is all serious enough now; 
 and I really do wish to find out my duty upon it." 
 
 " In order to do your duty, whatever it may cost you ? " 
 
 " Certainly." 
 
 She then told her story. The lady at length smiled, and 
 observed — 
 
 " You have no very strong inclination to join us, I perceive." 
 
 " Not any," frankly replied Enphrosyno. " I have no doubt 
 the sisters are very happy. They cboose their way of life for 
 themselves. I only feel it is one that I should never choose.

HER DUTY. 195 
 
 Nor wotjd grandpapa for me, for more than a short time. I 
 hope, madam, you understand that we neither of us think of my 
 ever heooming a nun." 
 
 " I see that there is no present sign of its being your voca- 
 tion." 
 
 " And there never will be," cried Euphrosyne, very earnestly. 
 " I assure you, I cannot bear the idea of it." 
 
 " So I perceive, my dear. I am quite convinced, I assure you. 
 Have you as great a dislike to being educated ? " 
 
 " Almost, I am afraid. But I could get over that. I like 
 reading very well, and learning things at my own time, and in 
 my own way ; but I feel rather old to begin to be under orders 
 as to what I shall learn, and when and how; and yet rather 
 young to be so grave and regular as the sisters are. I am fifteen, 
 you know." 
 
 " Tou are not aware, I see, how much we laugh when we are 
 by ourselves, nor how we like to see gii-ls of fifteen happy and 
 gay. I think, too, that I may answer for the sisters not quarrel- 
 ling with you about what you ought to learn. You will comply 
 with the rules of the house as to hours ; and your preceptresses 
 will allow you, as far as possible, to follow your bent." 
 
 " Tou are very kind, as you always are. But I think far less 
 of all this than of what grandpapa is to do without me. Con- 
 sider what long, weary days he will have ! He has scarcely any 
 acquaintance left in Cap ; and he has been accustomed to do 
 nothing without me. He will sit and cry all day — I know he 
 vrill." 
 
 And Buphrosyne's tears began to overflow at the thought. 
 
 " It is a great honour, my child, to have been made such a 
 blessing to an old man." 
 
 "It was almost the only one he had left. Up to that terrible 
 ninety-one " 
 
 The abbess shuddered. 
 
 " Tou knew my mother and sisters P " 
 
 " Very little. I was then a humble sister, and had little 
 intercourse with any ladies who might occasionally visit us. 
 But I remember her coming, one day, with her children — three 
 girls — one who ran about the garden, and two modest, blushing 
 girls, who accepted some of our flowers." 
 
 " I must have been the little one who ran about, and the others 
 were my poor sisters. Well, all these, besides my papa, were 
 always about grandpapa ; and he never wanted amusement or 
 waiting on. Since that dreadful time, he has had only me ; and 
 now, in his old age, when he has no strength, and nothing to do, 
 he is going to be all alone ! Oh, madam, I think it is wicked to 
 xeave him ! Had anybody ever a clearer duty than I have— to 
 stay with him .P "

 " Ton would be quite right if it was anybody but himself 
 that desired you to leave Mm. Tour first duty, my dear, is to 
 obey his wishes." 
 
 " I shall never be able to learn my lessons, for thinking of 
 him, sitting alone there — or perhaps lying in bed, because there 
 is nothing to get up for." 
 
 " Now yon are presumptuous. Ton are counting _ upon what 
 may never happen, and fearing to leave your parent in the hand 
 of Him who gave you to him. Suppose you were to die to-night, 
 I fear yon could not trust him in the hands of Him who wraps 
 ns round with old age, before taking us home to Himself." 
 
 " Oh, yes, I could so trust him to-night, if I myself had watched 
 him to sleep. But a month hence, if I were to die, I should 
 dread to meet iny parents. They would ask me, ' How is our 
 father?' and I should have to answer, 'I do not know — I have 
 left him — I have done nothing for him of late.' The whole 
 time that I am here, madam, I shall be afraid to die and meet 
 my mother." 
 
 " We must lead you to doubt your own notions, and to trust 
 more in God," said the lady, gently. " We know not what a 
 day may bring forth ; and as you grow older, you wUl find how, 
 in cases of hard and doubtful duty, our way becomes suddenly 
 clear, so as to make us ashamed of our late anguish. Father 
 Gabriel will tell you that one night he lost his way among the 
 marshes in the plain. The clouds hung thick and low overhead, 
 and there was not a ray of light. He plunged on the one hand 
 into the marsh ; and on the other, the reeds grew higher than 
 his head. Behind him was a wood that he had hardly managed 
 to struggle through ; and he knew not what might be before 
 him. He groped about for a firm place to stand on, and had no 
 idea which way to move. At last, without his having felt a 
 breath of wind, he found that the clouds had parted to the right, 
 making a chink through which he saw the Gibao peaks standing 
 up against a starlight sky ; and, to the left, there was, on the 
 horizon, a dim white line which he could not understand, till 
 the crescent moon dropped down from behind the cloudy canopy, 
 across a bar of clear sky, and into the sea. This made him look 
 whether the church of St. Hilaire was not close by. He made 
 out its dim mass through the darkness, and in a few minutes 
 stood in the porch. So, my child, is our way (even yours, young 
 as you are) sometimes made too dark for our feeble eyes ; and 
 thus, from one quarter or another, is a ray permitted to fall that 
 we may not be lost." 
 
 "Thank you," said Euphrosyne, softly. "May I come to- 
 morrow P " 
 
 " At any hour you shall be welcome, my dear," 
 
 " If you will appoint me something to do every morning in thp

 garden, madam, grandpapa might sit in the balcony, to see me, 
 and talk to me. That will be a reason for his getting up. That 
 wUl prevent his lying too long, for want of something to do." 
 
 " A very good plan. If you love your grandfather so, Eu- 
 phrosyue, how would you have loved your mother, if she had 
 lived P" 
 
 " Had you a mother, when you were my age ? " 
 
 " Tes, my dear. But do not let us speak of that. Do you 
 remember your mamma, my dear p " 
 
 "Tes — a little. I remember her sitting in a wood — on the 
 ground — with her head bent down upon her knees, and a great 
 many black people about." 
 
 " Well — tell me no more. I ought not to have asked you. I 
 was not thinking of that horrid time." 
 
 "But I do not mind telling you. I like to speak of it ; and I 
 never can to grandpapa — it makes him so UI. Mamma shook so, 
 that I remember putting my arms about her to keep her warm, 
 till I found how burning hot her hands were. My sisters were 
 crying ; and they told me not to ask any more why papa did not 
 come to us ; for he was dead. I remember being wakened by a 
 noise when I was very sleepy, and seeing some soldiers. One of 
 them lifted me up, and I was frightened, till I saw that they 
 were carrying mamma too. They put us both into a cart. I did 
 not see my sisters ; and I believe they were both dead then, of 
 grief and hardship. And mamma never spoke again. She looked 
 as pale as her gown, as she lay in the cart, with her eyes shut. 
 She was breathing, however, and I thought she was asleep. I 
 felt very sleepy and odd. The soldiers said I was half -starved, 
 and they gave me a plantain that they pulled by the road-side. 
 I wanted them to give some to mamma too ; but they made me no 
 answer. I put mine into her hand, but she let it fall ; and I 
 cried because she would not take any notice. Then one of the 
 soldiers bade me eat my plantain ; and I thought I must do as I 
 was bid. I forget where we went next." 
 
 " Tou remember more than I had supposed. Tour mother 
 was brought on board the ship where we were ; and there she 
 presently died." 
 
 " Tou were on board ship, madam P " 
 
 " Tes — ^aU the sisters — for the town was not considered safe, 
 even for us." 
 
 " And where was " Euphrosyne stopped abruptly. 
 
 " Tou were going to ask where my mother was," said the lady. 
 " I feel that I was wrong in stopping you as I did just now — ^for 
 you might fancy that my mother was in some way to blame. 
 She was a good mother to me — full of kindness ; but I did not 
 make her happy." 
 
 " Tou did not P "

 " Indeed I did not. I crossed her in the thing she desired 
 most of all — that we should live together. I believed it my 
 duty to become a nun, and I left her. She returned to France, 
 being a widow, and having no other child ; and there she died, 
 among distant relations." 
 
 " Was she angry with you ? " 
 
 " She never said or showed that she was. But I know that 
 she was grieved to the very soul, and for life. This, my dear, 
 has been the greatest affliction I have ever known. I did not 
 feel it so at the time, having no doubt of my vocation ; but what 
 I have suffered since from the thought that an only child and 
 only parent, who ought to have made each other happy, were 
 both miserable, God only knows." 
 
 " Yet you did what you thought was your duty to God. I 
 wonder whether you were right ? " 
 
 " If you knew how many times but," said the lady, inter. 
 
 rupting herself, " we shall know all when our hearts are laid 
 open ; and I may minister to my mother yet. If I erred, and 
 there be further punishment yet for my error, I am ready to bear 
 it. Tou see, my child, how much you have to be thaiiful for, 
 that your difficulty is not from having failed in duty to your 
 parent. For the future, fear not but that your duty will be 
 made clear to you. I am sure this is all you desire." 
 
 " Shall we have any more such conversations as this when I 
 come to live here P If we can " 
 
 " "We shall see," replied the lady, smiling. " Father Gabriel 
 says there may easily be too much talk, even about our duties ; 
 but occasions may arise." 
 
 " I hope so," said Buphrosyne, rising, as she perceived that 
 the lady thought it was time for her to go. " I dare say Pierre 
 is here." 
 
 Pierre had been waiting some time. 
 
 The abbess sat alone after Euphrosyne was gone, contem- 
 plating, not the lamp, though her eyes wei-e fixed upon it, but 
 the force of the filial principle in this lonely girl — a force which 
 had constrained her to open the aching wound in her own heart 
 to a mere child. She sat, till called by the hour to prayer, 
 pondering the question how it is that relations designed for duty 
 and peace become the occasions of the bitterest sin and suffering. 
 The mystery was in no degree cleared up when she was called 
 to prayer — ^which, however, has the blessed power of solving all 
 painful mysteries for the hour.

 CHAPTER XXI. 
 
 PERPLEXITY SOLVED. 
 
 " What is the matter, child ? What makes you look so merry P " 
 asked M. Revel, when his eyes opened upon Euphrosyne the 
 next morning. 
 
 " Nothing has happened, grandpapa. The only thing is, that 
 I like to do what you wish ; and I always will, as long as you 
 live. I will go to the convent to-day. You can send for me at 
 any time when you want me, you know. I am sure the abbess 
 will let me come whenever you send Pierre for me." 
 
 '' Well, well — do not be in such a hurry. I do not wajit you 
 to go to-day. Why should you be in such a hurry ? " 
 
 When the breeze had come to refresh him, and he had had his 
 coffee, M. Revel felt more complaisant, and explained what he 
 meant by there being no hurry. Euphrosyne should not leave 
 him till to-morrow ; and this day should be spent as she pleased. 
 Whatever she liked to ask to-day should be granted. This indul- 
 gence was promised under a tolerable certainty that she would 
 ask nothing unreasonable : that she would not propose a dinner- 
 party of dark-complexioned guests, for instance. There might 
 also be an expectation of what it would be that she would choose. 
 M. Revel was conscious that he did not visit his estate of Le 
 Bosquet, in the plain of Limbe, so often as Euphrosyne would 
 have liked, or as he himself knew to be good for his agent, the 
 cultivators, and his heiress. He was aware that if he could have 
 shown any satisfaction in the present order of affairs, any good- 
 will towards the working of the new system, there might have 
 been a chance of old stories dying away — of old grievances being 
 forgotten by the cultivators, in his present acquiescence in their 
 freedom. He could not order the carriage, and say he was going 
 to Le Bosquet ; but he had just courage enough to set Euphro- 
 syne free to ask to go. It turned out exactly as he expected. 
 
 " We will do what you will, my child, to-day. I feel strong 
 enough to be your humble servant." 
 
 " It is a splendid day, grandpapa. It must be charming at Le 
 Bosquet. If I order the carriage now, we can get there before 
 the heat ; and we need not come home tOl the cool of the even- 
 ing. We will fill the carriage with fruit and flowers for the 
 abbess. May I order the carriage ? " 
 
 Le Bosquet was only twelve miles off. They arrived when 
 the cultivators were settling to their work after breakfast. It 
 was now, as on every former occasion, a perplexity, an embar- 
 rassment to Euphrosyne, that the negroes lost all their gaiety, 
 aud most of their civility, in the presence of her grandfather.

200 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 She could hardly wonder, when she witnessed th:s, at his in- 
 tolerance of the very mention of the blacks, at his ridicule of all 
 that she ever told him about them, from her own observation. 
 When she was in any other company, she saw them merry, 
 active, and lavish of their kindness and politeness ; and when- 
 ever this occurred, she persuaded herself that she must have 
 been mistaken the last time she and M. Revel were at Le Bos- 
 quet, and that they ought to go again soon. The neit time 
 they went, there was the same gloom, listlessness, and avoid- 
 ance on the part of the negroes ; the same care on her grand- 
 father's that she should not stir a step without the escort of 
 Pierre or the agent. He would not even let her go with Portia, 
 the dairy. woman, to gather eggs ; nor with little Sully, to see his 
 baby-brother. She made up her mind that this was all wrong 
 — that all parties would have been more amiable and happy, if 
 there had been the same freedom and confidence that she saw on 
 other estates. Poor girl ! she little knew what was in all minds 
 but her own— what recollections of the lash and the stocks, and 
 hunger and imprisonment on the one hand, and of the horrors 
 of that August night on the other. She little knew how gene- 
 rally it was supposed that she owed it to the grandfather whom 
 she loved so much that she was the solitary orphan whom every 
 one pitied. 
 
 It was, as Euphrosyne had said, a splendid day; and all went 
 well. M. Revel would not go out much ; but as he sat in the 
 shaded room, looking forth upon the lawn, the agent satisfied 
 him witli accounts of the prosperity of the estate, the fine pro- 
 mise of the cacao walks, and the health and regular conduct of 
 the negroes. Euphrosyne showed herself from time to time, now 
 in the midst of a crowd of children, now with a lapful of eggs, 
 and then with a basket of fruit. In honour of the master and 
 young mistress, the dinner was very superb, and far too long ; 
 so that the day had slipped away before Euphrosyne felt at all 
 disposed to return. She was glad that the agent was engaged 
 in a deep discussion with his employer when the carriage came 
 round ; so that she was able to make one more short circuit in 
 the twilight while they were settling their point. 
 
 The gentlemen were talking over the two late proclamations 
 — L'Ouverture's and H^douviUe's. The agent wished that 
 HMouville had never come, rather than that he should have set 
 afloat the elements of mischief contained in his proclamation. 
 M. Revel could not believe that a Commissary, sent out for the 
 very purpose of regulating such matters, could have got very 
 far wrong upon them ; and besides, the proclamation had never 
 been issued. Never formally issued, the agent said ; but it had 
 been circulated from hand to hand of those who were interested 
 in its provisions. Some were, at that moment, preparing to act 
 


## p. (#205) ################################################

RETURNING. 20I 
 
 upon it; and he feared that mischief might come of it yet. 
 It was certain that L'Ouverture knew more about claims to 
 deserted estates, and about the proper regulations as to tillage, 
 than any novice from France could know; and it was no less 
 certaia that he was ever more eager to gratify the whites than 
 the blacks. It would have been by far the wisest plan to leave 
 that class of afEairs in the hands of the person who understood 
 them best ; and, if he was not much mistaken, the Government 
 at home would yet rae Hedouville's rashness in acting without 
 so much as consulting L'Ouverture. M. Revel was so amaaed at 
 finding that L'Ouverture was not only worshipped by romantic 
 young ladies and freed negroes, but approved and confided in by 
 such practical and interested whites as his own agent, that he 
 could only say again what he said every day — that the world 
 was turned ujjside down, and that he expected to be stripped, 
 before he died, of Le Bosquet, and of everything else that he 
 had ; so that his poor child would be left dependent on the 
 charity of France. To this the agent replied, as usual, that 
 the property had never before been so secure, nor the estate 
 so prosperous ; and that all would go well, if only the 
 Government at home would employ competent people to write its 
 proclamations. 
 
 " "Where is this child P " cried M. Revel at last. " I am always 
 kept waiting by everybody. It is dark already, and the carriage 
 has been standing this hour. Where is she ? " 
 
 " Mademoiselle is in the carriage," said Pierre, from the haU. 
 " I made Prince light the lamps, though he thinks we shall not 
 want them." 
 
 " Come, come! let us lose no more time," said M. Revel, as if 
 every one had not been waiting for him. 
 
 Buphrosyne jumped from the carriage, where she had been 
 packing her basket of eggs, her fruit, and her flowers, so that 
 they might be out of her grandfather's way. He could not 
 admire any of them, and found them all in his way. While the 
 road lay under the dark shadow of the groves on the estate, he 
 cast anxious glances among the taU stems on which the carriage 
 lamps cast a passing gleam. He muttered a surly good-night 
 to the negroes who held open the gates ; but, when the last of 
 these swung-to, when the carriage issued upon the high road, and 
 the plain lay, though dim in the starlight, yet free and lovely to 
 the eye, whUe the line of grey sea was visible to the left, the 
 old man's spirits seemed to rise. It was seldom that he quitted 
 the town ; and when he did, and could throw ofE his cares, he 
 was surprised to find how reviving were the influences of the 
 country. 
 
 " It is a lovely night, really," said he. " If you ever go to 
 Paris, my dear, you will miss this starlight. There the stars

 seem to have shrunk away from yon, a myriad of miles. Let 
 those flowers be, child. Why may not I have the pleasure of 
 smelling them ? There ! Let them lie. Who would believe that 
 that sea, which looks so quiet now, will be rolling and dashing 
 upon the beach in ISTovember, as if it meant to swallow up the 
 plain P How it seems to sleep in the starlight ! Tou found 
 little Sully grown, my dear, I dare say." 
 
 " Oh, yes ! but more glad to see us than ever. He had to show 
 me how ho could read, and how he had been allowed to put a 
 new leg to the master's desk at the school. Sully will make a 
 good carpenter, I think. He is going to make a box for me ; 
 and he declares the ants shall never get through it, at the 
 hinge, or lid, or anywhere. How the jpeople are singing all 
 about ! I love to hear them. Prince drives so fast, that we 
 shall be home too soon. I shall be quite sorry to be in the 
 streets again." 
 
 It seemed as if Prince had heard her, for, in another moment, 
 he was certainly checking his horses, and their speed gradually 
 relaxed. 
 
 " He must have driven us fast, indeed," said M. Revel. 
 " Look at the lights of the town — how near they are ! Are those 
 the lights of the town P " 
 
 " I should have looked for them more to the left," Euphro- 
 syne replied. " Let ns ask Pierre. We cannot possibly have 
 lost our way.'' 
 
 Pierre rode up to the carriage window, at the moment that 
 Prince came to a full stop. 
 
 " We do not know," said Louis, the black footman, who was 
 beside Prince — " We do not know what those lights can mean. 
 They seem to be moving, and towards this way." 
 
 " I think it is a body of people," said Pierre. " I fear so, sir." 
 
 " We had better go back," said Euphrosyne. " Let us go 
 back to Le Bosquet." 
 
 " Forward ! Forward ! " cried M. Revel, like one frantic. 
 " Wliy do you stand still, you rascal P I will drive myself if 
 you do not push on. Drive on — drive like the devil — like what 
 you all are," he added, in a lower tone. 
 
 " Surely we had better go back to Le Bosquet." 
 
 '' No, no, you little fool," cried the agonised old man, grasping 
 hold of her, and dragging her towards himself. 
 
 Louis shouted from the box, as Prince lashed his horses 
 onwards, " We shall be in the midst of them, sir, this way." 
 
 "Drive on," was stiU the command. " Drive through every- 
 thing to get honuB ! " As he clasped his arms round Euphrosyne, 
 and pressed her so closely that she could scarcely breame, heap- 
 ing his cloak upon her head, she heard and felt him murmuring 
 to himseM- —

 " To Le Bosquet ! No, indeed! anywhere but there! Once 
 at home — she once safe — and then — —" 
 
 Euphrosyne would have been glad to see a little of what 
 appeared — to know something of what to expect. Once or twice 
 she struggled to raise her head ; but this only made the convul- 
 sive clasp closer than before. AH she knew was, that Pierre or 
 the men on the box seemed to speak, from time to time ; for the 
 passionate " Drive on ! " " Forward ! " was repeated. She also 
 fancied that they must at last be in the midst of a crowd ; for 
 the motion of the carriage seemed to be interrupted by a sort of 
 hustling on either side. Her heart beat so tumultuously, how- 
 ever, and the sense of suffocation was so strong, that she was 
 sure of nothing but that she felt as if dying. Once more she 
 struggled for air. At the same moment, her grandfather started 
 — almost bounded from his seat, and relaxed his hold of her. 
 She thought she had heard fire-arms. She raised her head ; 
 but all was confusion. There was smoke — there was the glare 
 of torches — there was a multitude of shining black faces, and 
 her grandfather lying back, as if asleep, in the corner of the 
 carriage. 
 
 " IJrive on ! " she heard Pierre cry. The whip cracked, the 
 horses plunged and scrambled, and in another moment broke 
 through the crowd. The yelling, the lights, the smoke, were 
 left behind ; the air blew fresh ; and there was only calm star- 
 light without, as before. 
 
 The old man's hand fell when lifted. He did not move when 
 she stroked his cheek. He did not answer when she spoke. She 
 put her hand to his forehead, and it was wet. 
 
 " Pierre ! Pierre ! " she cried, " he is shot ! he is dead ! " 
 
 " I feared so. Mademoiselle. Drive on, Prince ! " 
 
 In an inconceivably short time, they were at their own door. 
 Pierre looked into the carriage, felt his master's wrist and heart, 
 spoke softly to Prince, and they drove on again — only past the 
 corner — only to the gate of the convent. 
 
 When it was opened, Pierre appeared at the carriage door. 
 " Now, Mademoiselle," he said. He half pulled, half lifted her 
 over the crushed fruit and flowers that were in her way — glanced 
 in her face, to see whether she had observed that the body fell 
 behind her — carried her in, and gave her, passive and stupified, 
 into the arms of two nuns. Seeing the abbess standing behind, 
 he took oif his hat, and would have said something ; but his lips 
 quivered, and he could not. 
 
 " I will," said the lady's gentle voice, answering to his thought. 
 " My young daughter shall be cherished here."

 CHAPTER XXII. 
 
 A loveb's love. 
 
 This new violence had for its object the few whites who were 
 rash and weak enongh to insist on the terms of HedouviUe's 
 intended proclamation, instead of abiding by that of L'Ouverture. 
 The cultivators on the estates of these whites left work, rather 
 than be reduced to a condition of virtual slavery. Wandering 
 from plantation to plantation, idle and discontented, they drew to 
 themselves others who, from any cause, were also idle and discon- 
 tented. They exasperated each olher vrith tales, old and new, 
 of the tyranny of the whites. Still, further mischief might have 
 been prevented by due vigilance and firmness on the part of him 
 in whose charge the town and district of Cap Pran<;ais now lay. 
 Stories, however, passed from mouth to mouth respecting General 
 Moyse — anecdotes of the words he had dropped in dislike of the 
 whites — of the prophecies he had uttered of more violence before 
 the old masters would be taught their new place — rumom-s like 
 these spread, till the gathering mob at length turned their faces 
 towards the town, as if to try how far they might go. They 
 went as far as the gates, having murdered some few of the ob- 
 noxious masters, either in their own houses, or, as in the case of 
 M. Revel, where they happened to meet them. 
 
 On the Haut-du-Oap they encountered General Moyse coming 
 out against them with soldiery. At first he looked fierce ; and 
 the insurgents began to think each of getting away as he best 
 might. But in a few moments, no one seemed to know how or 
 why, the aspect of afEairs changed. There was an air of irresolu- 
 tion about the Commander. It was plain that he was not really 
 disposed to be severe — that he had no deadly intentions towards 
 those he came to meet. His black troops caught his mood. Some 
 of the inhabitants of the town, who were on the watch with 
 glasses from the gates, from the churches, and from the roofs of 
 nouses, afterwards testified to there having been a shaking of 
 hands, and other amicable gestures. They testified that the in- 
 surgents crowded round General Moyse, and gave, at one time 
 cheers, at another time groans, evidently on a signal from him. 
 No prisoners were made — ^there was not a shot fired. The 
 General and his soldiers returned into the town, and even into 
 their quarters, protesting that no further mischief would happen, 
 but the insurgents remaiaed on the heights till daylight ; and 
 the inhabitants, feeling themselves whoUy unprotected, sent ofE 
 expresses to the Commander-in-Chief, and watched, with arms 
 loaded, till he, or one of his more trustworthy Generals, should 
 arrive. These expresses were stopped and turned back, by order

MOYSE UNDER ARREST. 205 
 
 of General Moyse, who ridiculed the idea of further danger, and 
 required the inhabitants to be satisfied with his assurances of 
 protection. Fortunately, however, one or two messengers who 
 had been sent of£ a few hours before, on the first alarm, had 
 reached their destination, while General Moyse was yet on the 
 Haut-du-Oap. 
 
 The first relief to the anxious watchers was on seeing the 
 heights gradually cleared at sunrise. The next was the news 
 that L'Ouverture was entering the town, followed by the ring- 
 leaders from Limbe, whom he was bringing in as prisoners. He 
 had proceeded directly to the scene of insurrection, where the 
 leaders of the mob were delivered up to him at his first bidding. 
 It now remained to be seen what he would do with those within 
 the town, high or low in ofiice, who were regarded by the in- 
 habitants as accessories. 
 
 This kind of speculation was not abated by the sight of 
 L'Ouverture, as he passed through the streets. Grave as his 
 countenance usually was, and at times melancholy, never had it 
 been seen so mournful as to-day. Years seemed to have sunk 
 down upon him since he was last seen — so lately that the 
 youngest prattler in the Cap had not ceased to talk of the day. 
 As he walked his horse through the streets, many citizens ap. 
 preached, some humbly to ask, others eagerly to ofi^er information 
 With all these last he made appointments, and rode on. His 
 way lay past M. Revel's door ; and it happened to be at the very 
 time that the funeral (an affair of hurry in that climate) was 
 about to take place. At the sight, L'Ouverture stopped, opposite 
 the door. When the coflBn was brought out, he took ofE his hat, 
 and remained imcovered till it moved on, when he turned his 
 horse, and followed the train to the comer of the street. There 
 were many present who saw his face, and by whom its expression 
 of deep sorrow was never afterwards forgotten. When he 
 again turned in the direction of <3rovernment-house, he pro- 
 ceeded at a rapid pace, as if his purposes had been quickened by 
 the sight. 
 
 His aides, who had been dispersed on different errands, 
 entered the town by its various avenues ; and some of them 
 joined him in the Jesuits' Walk. At the gate of Government- 
 house he was received by General Moyse, who had been almost 
 the last person in Cap to hear of his arrival. L'Ouverture 
 acknowledged his military greeting; and then, turning to his 
 aides, said in a calm tone, which yet was heard half-way down the 
 Walk, and thence propagated through the town, as if by echoes — 
 
 '' General Moyse is under arrest.'' 
 
 As Moyse was moving ofE towards the apartment in which he 
 was to be guarded, he requested an interview with the Com- 
 mander-in-Chief. 
 


## p. (#210) ################################################

206 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " After your business with the court-martial is concluded," 
 was the reply. " On no account before." 
 
 General Moyse bowed, and proceeded to his apartment. 
 
 For some hours after, there was every indication of the rapid 
 transaction of business in Grovernment-house. Messengers were 
 sent to Fort Dauphin, to the commanding officer at Limbd, and 
 to every military station within thirty miles. Orders were 
 issued for the garrison of Cap to be kept close within their 
 quarters. ISfot a man was to be allowed, on any pretence what- 
 ever, to pass the barrack-gates, which were well guarded by the 
 Oommander-in-Chief 's own guards, till troops for the service of 
 the town could arrive from Fort Dauphin. As L'Ouverture was 
 closeted with his secretary, message after message was reported; 
 letter upon letter was delivered by his usher. Among these 
 messages came, at length, one which made him start. 
 
 " Mademoiselle L'Ouverture begs to be permitted to see 
 General Moyse." 
 
 Before he could reply, a note by another messenger was put 
 into his hands. 
 
 " I implore you to let me see Moyse. I do not ask to see 
 yon. I do not wish it. I will disturb no one. Only give me 
 an order to see Moyse — for his sake, and that of your unhappy 
 
 " G^ENIFEtoE." 
 
 Tonssaint left the room, and was but too well directed by the 
 countenances of his servants to the room where G^nifrede was 
 lying, with her face hidden, upon a sofa. Denis was standing 
 silent at a window which overlooked the Walk. Both were 
 covered with dust from their journey. 
 
 Gdnifrede looked up, on hearing some one enter. When she 
 saw that it was her father, she again buried her face in the 
 cushions, saying only — , 
 
 " Oh, why did you come ? " 
 
 " Nay, my child, why did you come P How — why — " 
 
 " I always know," said she, " when misery is near ; and 
 where misery is, there am I. Do not be angry with Denis, 
 father. I made him come." 
 
 " I am angry with no one, Gdnif i-ede. I am too much grieved 
 to be angry. I am come to take you to Moyse. I cannot see 
 him myself, at present ; but I will take you to the door of the 
 salon where ho is." 
 
 " The salon ! " said Genifrede, as if relieved. She had pro- 
 bably imagined him chained in a cell. This one word appeared 
 to altpr the course of her ideas. She glanced at her travel-soiled 
 dress and hesitated. Her father said — 
 
 " I will send a servant to you. Refresh yourself ; and in 
 half-an-hour I wiU come agaiu."

"he is merciful!' 207 
 
 When he rejoined her, she was stiU haggard and agitated, but 
 appeared far less wretched than before. 
 
 " G<Snifrede ! " cried Moyse, as she entered and leaned against 
 the wall, unable to go farther. " Genifrede ! And was not that 
 your father who admitted you ? Oh, call him, Gdnifrede ! Call 
 him back ! I must see him. If you ask him, he will come. Call 
 him baclr, Genifrede ! " 
 
 " If you are engaged, Moyse,'' said she in a sickening voice, 
 " if I am iu your way, I will go." 
 
 " No, no, my love. But I must see your father. Everything 
 may depend upon it." 
 
 " I will go — as soon as I can," said the poor girl, beginning to 
 sink to the floor. 
 
 " Ton shall not go, my love — my Genifrede," cried Moyse, 
 
 supporting her to a sofa. " I did not know — I little thought 
 
 Are yon all here ? " 
 
 "No ; I came to see you, Moyse. I told you how it would be 
 if we parted." 
 
 " And how will it be, love ? " 
 
 " Oh, how can you make me say it P How can you make me 
 think it .P" 
 
 " Why, Genifrede, you cannot suppose anything very serious 
 will happen. What frightens you so P Once more 1 ask you 
 the old question that we must both be weaiy of — what frightens 
 you so P ' 
 
 " What frightens me ! " she repeated, with a bewildered look 
 in her face. " Were we not to have been married as soon as you 
 were relieved from your command here P And are you not a 
 prisoner, waiting for trial — and that trial for — for — for your life P " 
 
 " Never believe so, Genifrfede ! Have they not told you that 
 the poor blacks behaved perfectly well from the moment they 
 met me P They did not do a single act of violence after I went 
 to them. Not a hand was raised when they had once seen me ; 
 and after I had put them into good humour, they all went to 
 their homes." 
 
 " Oh, is it so ? Is it really so? But you said just now that 
 everything depended on your seeing my father." 
 
 " To a soldier, his honoui-, his professional standing, are every- 
 thing " 
 
 Seeing a painful expression iu Genifrede's face, he explained 
 that even his private happiness— the prosperity of his love, 
 depended on his professional honour and standing. She must be 
 as well aware as liimself that he was now wholly at her father's 
 mercy, as regarded all his prospects in life ; and that this would 
 justify any eagerness to see him. 
 
 " At his mercy," repeated Genifrede ; " and he is merciful. 
 He does acts of mercy every day."

208 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " True — true. Ton see now you were too much alarmed." 
 
 " But, Moyse, how came you to need his mercy ? But two 
 
 days ago how proud he was of you ! and now Oh ! Moyse, 
 
 when you knew what depended on these few days, how could 
 you fail?" 
 
 " How was it that he put me into an office that I was not fit 
 for ? He should have seen " 
 
 " Then let us leave him, and all these afPairs which make us 
 so miserable. Let us go to your father. He will let us live at 
 St. Domingo in peace.' 
 
 Moyse shook his head, saying that there were more whites at 
 St. Domingo than in any other part of the island ; and the plain 
 truth was, he could not live where there were whites. 
 
 " How was it then that you pleased my father so much when 
 Hedouville went away ? He whispered to me, in the piazza at 
 Pongaudin, that, next to himself, you saved the town — that 
 many whites owed their lives and their fortunes to you." 
 
 " I repent," cried Moyse, bitterly, " I repent of my deeds of 
 that day. I repent that any white ever owed me gratitude. I 
 thank God, I have shaken them off, like the dust from my feet ! 
 Thank God, the whites are all cursing me now ! " 
 
 " What do you mean ? How was it all ? " cried Genifrede, 
 fearfully. 
 
 " When H6douvUle went away, my first desire was to distin- 
 guish myself, that I might gain you, as your father promised. 
 This prospect, so near and so bright, dazzled me so that I could 
 not see black faces from white. For the hour, one passion put 
 the other out." 
 
 " And when how soon did you begin to forget me ? " asked 
 
 G&ifrede, sorrowfully. 
 
 " I have never forgotten you, love — not for an hour, in the 
 church among the priests — in the square among the soldiers, 
 any more than here as a prisoner. But I thought my point was 
 gained when your father stooped from his horse, as he rode away, 
 and told me there would be joy at home on hearing of my charge. 
 I doubted no more that all was safe. Then I heard of the insuf- 
 ferable insolence of some of the whites out at Limbe — acting as 
 if Hedouville was still here to countenance them. I saw exulta- 
 tion on account of this in aU the white faces I met in Cap. The 
 poor old wretch Revel, when my officers and I met his carriage, 
 stared at me through his spectacles, and laughed in my face as 
 if " 
 
 " Was his grandchild with him ? She was ? Then he was 
 laughing at some of her prattle. Nothing else made him even 
 smile." 
 
 " It looked as if he was ridiculing me and my function. I 
 was growing more angry every hour, when tidings came of the

PROPOSING TO RUN AWAY. 309 
 
 rising out at Limbe. I knew it was forced on by the whites. 1 
 knew the mischief was begun by HedouTille, and kept up by his 
 countrymen ; and was it to be expected that I shonld draw the 
 sword for them against our own people ? Could I have done so, 
 Genif rede ? " 
 
 " Would not my father have restored peace without drawing 
 the sword at all ? " 
 
 " That was what I did. I went out to meet the insurgents ; 
 and the moment they saw that the whites were not to have their 
 own way, they returned to quietness, and to their homes. Not 
 another blow was struck." 
 
 " And the murderers — what did you do with them ? " 
 
 Moyse was silent for a moment, and then replied — 
 
 " Those may deal with them who desire to live side-by-side 
 with whites. As for me, I quarrel with none who avenge our 
 centuries of wrong." 
 
 " Would to God my father had known that this was in your 
 heart ! Tou would not then have been a wretched prisoner here. 
 Moyse, the moment you are free, let us fly to the mornes. I 
 told you how it would be, if we parted. Tou will do as I wish 
 henceforward ; you will take me to the mornes ? " 
 
 "My love, where and how should we live there ? In a cave 
 of the rocks, or roosting in trees P " 
 
 " People do live there — not now, perhaps, under my father's 
 government : but in the old days, runaways did live there." 
 
 " So you would institute a new race of banditti, under your 
 father's reign ! How weU it will sound in the First Consul's 
 council-chamber, that the eldest daughter of the ambitious 
 Commander-in-Chief is the first bandit's wife in the mornes ! " 
 
 " Let them say what they wiU : we must have peace, Moyse. 
 We have been wretched too long. Oh, if we could once be up 
 there, hidden among the rocks, or sitting among the ferns in the 
 highest of those valleys, with the very clouds between us and 
 this weary world below — never to see a white face more ! Then, 
 at last, we could be at peace. Everywhere else we are beset 
 with this enemy. They are in the streets, in the churches, on 
 the plain. We meet them in the shade of the woods, and have 
 to pass them basking on the sea-shore. There is no peace but 
 high up in the mornes — too high for the wild beast, and the 
 reptile, and the white man." 
 
 " The white man mounts as high as the eagle's nest, Genif rede. 
 Tou win not be safe, even there, from the traveller or the philo- 
 sopher, climbing to measure the mountain or observe the stars. 
 — But while we are talking of the free and breezy heights " 
 
 " Tou are a prisoner," said Genifrede, mournfully. " But 
 soon, very soon, we can go. Why do you look so ? Tou said 
 there was no fear — ^that nothing serious could happen — ^nothing

 more than disgrace ; and, for each other's sake, we can defy dis- 
 grace. Can we not, Moyse ? Why do not you speak ? " 
 
 " Disgrace, or death, or anything. Even death, Genifrede. 
 Tes — I said what was not true. They will not let me out but 
 to my death. Do not shudder so, my love : they shall not part 
 us. They shall not rob me of everything. You did well to 
 come, love. If they had detained you, aud I had had to die with 
 such a last thought as that you remained to be comforted, sooner 
 or later, by another — to be made to forget me by a more prosperous 
 lover — O God ! I should have been mad ! " 
 
 " Tou are mad, Moyse," cried Genifrede, shrinking from him 
 in terror. " I do not believe a word you say. I love another ! 
 — they kill you ! It is all false ! I will not hear another word 
 — I wiU go." 
 
 To go was, however, beyond her power. As she sank down 
 again, trembling, Moyse said in the imperious tone which she 
 both loved and feared — 
 
 "I am speaking the truth now. I shall be tried to-night 
 before a court-martial, which will embody your father's opinion 
 aud will. They wiU find me a traitor, and doom me to death 
 upoi the Place. I must die — but not on the Place — and yon 
 shall die with me. In one moment, we shall be beyond their 
 power. Tou hear me, Genifrede ? I know you hear me, though 
 you do not speak. I can direct you to one, near at hand, who 
 prepares the red water, and knows me well. I will give you an 
 order for red water enough for us both. You will come — your 
 father will not refuse our joint request — ^you will come to me 
 as soon as the trial is over ; and then, love, we will never be 
 parted more." 
 
 Genifrede sat long with her face hidden on her lover's 
 shoxdder, speechless. After repeated entreaties that she would 
 say one word, Moyse raised her up, and, looking in her face, said 
 authoritatively — 
 
 " You will do as I say, GcSnifrede ? " 
 
 " Moyse, I dare not. No, no, I dare not ! If, when we are 
 dead, you should be dead to me too ! And how do we know ? If, 
 the very next moment, I should see only your dead body with 
 my own — if you should be snatched away somewhere, and I 
 should be alone in some wide place — if I should be doomed to 
 wander in some dreadful region, calling upon you for ever, and 
 no answer ! Oh, Moyse ! we do not know what fearful things 
 are beyond. I dai-e not ; no, no, I dare not ! Do not be angry 
 with me, Moyse ! " 
 
 " I thought you had been ready to live and die with me." 
 
 " And so I am — ready to live anywhere, anyhow — ready to 
 
 die, if only we could be sure Oh ! if you could only tell me 
 
 there is nothing beyond ."

THE BITTERNESS OF LOVE. 211 
 
 "I have little doubt," said Moyse, " that death is really what 
 it is to our eyes — au end of everything." 
 
 " Do you think so ? If you could only assure me of that ■ 
 
 But, if you were reaUy quite certain of that, would you wish me 
 to die too P " 
 
 " Wish it ! Ton must — you shall," cried he, passionately. 
 " Tou are mine — mine for ever ; and I will not let you go. Do 
 not you see — do not you feel," he said, moderating his tone, 
 " that you will die a slow death of anguish, pining away, from 
 the moment that cursed firing in the Place strikes upon your 
 ear? Tou cannot live without love — you know you cannot — 
 and you shall not live by any other love than mine. This little 
 sign," said he, producing a small carved ivory ring from his 
 pocket-book, " This little sign will save you from ttie anguish of 
 a thousand sleepless nights, from the wretchedness of a thousand 
 days of despair. Take it. If shown at No. 9, in the Rue Espagnole, 
 in my name, you will receive what will suffice for us both. 
 Take it, Genifrede." 
 
 She took the ring, but it presently dropped from her powerless 
 nands. 
 
 " Tou do not care for me," said Moyse, bitterly. " Tou are 
 like all women. Tou love in fair weather, and would have ns 
 give up everything for you ; and when the hurricane comes, you 
 will fly to shelter, and shut out your lover into the storm." 
 
 Genifrede was too wretched to remind her lover what was the 
 character of his love. It did not, indeed, occur to her. She 
 spoke, however : — 
 
 " If you had remembered, Moyse, what a coward I am, you 
 would have done differently, and not have made me so wretched 
 as I now am. Why did you not bid me bring the red water, 
 without saying what it was, and what for ? If you had put it to 
 my lips — if you had not given me a moment to fancy what is to 
 come afterwards, I would have drunk it — oh, so thankfully ! 
 But now — I dare not." ' 
 
 " Tou are not afraid to live without me." 
 
 " Tes, I am. I am afraid of living, of dying — of everything." 
 
 " Tou once asked me about " 
 
 '' I remember — about your spirit coming." 
 
 " Suppose it should come, angry at your failing me in my last 
 desire ? " 
 
 " Why did you not kill me ? Tou know I should have been 
 thanltful. I wish the roof would faU and bury us now." 
 
 She started and shrieked when she heard some one at tht 
 door. It was her father's servant, who told her that Madame 
 Dessalines had arrived, and that L'Ouverture wished her to 
 come and receive her friend. The servant held the door open, 
 so that there was opportunity only for another word.

 " Bemember," said Moyse, " they are not to seduce oi force 
 you back to Pongaudm to-day. Remember, you are not fit to 
 travel. Remember," he again said, holding up the ivory ring, 
 and then thrusting it into her bosom, " you come to me as soon 
 as the trial is over. I depend upon you." 
 
 He led her, passive and silent, to the door, where he kissed 
 her hand, saying, for the ear of any one who might be without, 
 " For once, I cannot accompany you further. Tell Madame 
 Dessalines that I hope to pay my respects to her soon." He 
 added, to the servant— 
 
 " See that Jnlien is at Mademoiselle L'Ouverture's orders, 
 till I need his services myself." 
 
 The man bowed, pleased, as most persons are, to have a com- 
 mission to discharge for a prisoner. Before he had closed the 
 door, G^nif rede was in the arms of Therese. 
 
 CHAPTER XXIII. 
 
 PANGS OF OFFICE. 
 
 That night, Madame Dessalines was alone in a dimly-lighted 
 apartment of Government-house — dimly lighted except by the 
 moon, shining in full at the range of windows which overlooked 
 the gardens, so as to make the one lamp upon the table appear 
 like a yellow taper. For most of the long hours that she had 
 sat there, Therese had been alone. Denis had entered, before 
 his departure homewards, to ask what tidings he was to carry to 
 Pongaudin from her. Father Laxabon had twice appeared, to 
 know if he could not yet see G«nifrede, to ofFer her consolation ; 
 and had withdrawn, when he found that Genif rede was not yet 
 awake. Madame Dessalines' maid had put her head in so often 
 as to give her mistress the idea that she was afraid to remain 
 anywhere else ; though it did not quite suit her to be where she 
 must speak as little as possible, and that little only in whispers. 
 So Therese had been, for the most part, alone since sunset. Her 
 work was on the table, and she ooeasioiially took up her needle 
 for a few minutes ; but it was laid down at the slightest noise 
 without ; and again and again she rose, either to listen at the 
 chamber-door which opened into the apartment, or softly to' pace 
 the floor, or to step out upon the balcony, to refresh herself with 
 looking down upon the calm lights and still shadows of the 
 gardens. 
 
 In the centre of one division of these gardens was a fountain, 
 whose waters, after springing in the air, fell into a wide and deep 
 reservoir, from whence were supplied the trenches which kept

THE TRIAL ENDED. 2.11 
 
 the alleys green and fresh in all but the veiy hottest weeks of 
 the year. Four straight walks met at this fouutain — walks 
 hedged in with fences of citron, geraniums, and lilac jessamine. 
 These walks were now deserted. Every one in the house and 
 in the town was occupied with something far different from 
 moonlight strolls, for pleasure or for meditation. The chequered 
 lights and shadows lay undisturbed by the foot of any intruder. 
 The waters gleamed as they rose, and sparkled as they fell ; and 
 no human voice, in discourse or in laughter, mingled with the 
 murmur and the splash. Here Therese permitted herself the 
 indulgence of the tears which she had made an effort to conceal 
 within. 
 
 " These young creatures ! " thought she. " What a lot ! They 
 are to be parted — wrenched asunder by death — by the same 
 cause, for indulgence of the same passion, which brought Jacques 
 and me together. If the same priest were to receive their con- 
 fession and ours, how would he reconcile the ways of God to 
 them and to us ? The thought of my child burns at my heart, 
 and its last struggle — my bosom is quivering with it still. 
 For this Jacques took me to his heart, and I have ever since had 
 — alas ! not f orgetfulness of my child— but a home, and the good 
 fame that a woman cannot lire without, and the love of a brave 
 and tender heart — tender to me, however hard to those we hate. 
 Jacques lives in honour, and in a station of command, though he 
 hates the whites with a passion which would startle Moyse him- 
 self — hates them so that he does not even strive, as I do, to 
 remember that they are human — to be ready to give them the 
 cup of cold water when they thirst, and the word of sympathy 
 when they grieve. He would rather dash the cup from their 
 parched lips, and laugh at their woes. Tet Jacques lives in 
 peace and honour at his palace at St. Marc, or is, iu war, at the 
 head of troops that would die for him : while this poor young 
 man, a mere novice in the passion, is too likely to be cast out, 
 as unworthy to live among us — among us who, God knows, 
 are in this regard more guilty than he ! The time may come, 
 when Genifrede's first passion is over, when I may teU her 
 this. Hark ! that trumpet ! The court-martial has broken up. 
 Oh, I wish I could silence that trumpet ! It will waken her. 
 It is further off — and further. God grant she may not have 
 heard it ! " 
 
 She stepped in, and to the chamber-door, and listened. There 
 was no stir, and she said to herself that her medicine had wrought 
 well. From the window, which opened on one of the court- 
 yards, she heard the shuflBing of feet, and the passing by of many 
 persons. She dared not look out ; but she felt certain that the 
 trial was over, that the officers were proceeding to their quarters, 
 and the prisoner to his solitude. Her heart beat so that she was

 glad to return to her seat, and cover her eyes from the light. 
 She was startled by the openiug of the door from the corridor. 
 It was L'Ouverture ; and she rose, as every one habitually did, 
 at his approach. 
 
 " Genifrede ? " he said, anxiously, as he approached. 
 
 Th6rese pointed to the chamber, saying softly — 
 
 " She is there. I do not know what you wiU think of the 
 means I have taken to procure her sleep. But she was so 
 shaken — she so dreaded this night ! " 
 
 " Tou have given her medicine. Is she asleep ? " 
 
 " I gave her henbane, and she is asleep." 
 
 " Is there a chance of her sleeping till noon ? " 
 
 "If she be not disturbed. I have carefully darkened the 
 room. What has been done P " she inquired, looking in his face. 
 Struck with its expression, she exclaimed, "How you have 
 suiiered ! " 
 
 " Tes. Life is bitter to those whom God has chosen. If 
 Moyse did but know it, I almost envy him his rest." 
 
 '' Is it over, then P is he deadp " 
 
 " He dies at sunrise. Tou think Genifrede may sleep tUlnoon? " 
 
 Therese could not reply, and he proceeded — 
 
 " He is found guilty, and sentenced. There was no escape. 
 His guilt is clear as noonday." 
 
 "No escape from the sentence," said Therese, eagerly. ''But 
 there is room for mercy yet. You hold the power of life and 
 death over all the colony — a power like that of God, and put 
 into your hand by Him." 
 
 " A power put into my hand by Him, and therefore to be 
 justly used. Moyse's crime is great, and mercy to him would 
 be a crime in me. I have fault enough already to answer for in 
 this business, and I dare not sin yet further." 
 
 " You yourself have sixmed ? " said Therese, with a gleam of 
 hope in her countenance and tone. 
 
 " Yes. I ought to have discerned the weakness of this young 
 man. I ought to have detected the passions that were working 
 in him. I was misled by one great and prolonged effort of self- 
 control in him. I appointed an unworthy officer to the care of 
 the lives and safety of the whites. Many of them are gone to 
 lay their deaths to my charge in heaven. All I can now do is, 
 by one more death (would to God it were my own!) to save 
 and to reassure those who are left. It is my retribution that 
 Moyse must die. As for Paul, as for Genifrede — the sin of the 
 brother is visited upon the brother — the sin of the father upon 
 the child." 
 
 " But," said Th&ese, " you speak as if you had caused the 
 innocent to be destroyed. Some few harmless ones may have 
 died ; but the greater number — those who were sought by the

 sword's point — were factious tyrants — enemies of your Govern- 
 ment, and of your race— men who raslily brought their deaths 
 upon themselves. They were passionate— they were stubborn 
 — they were cruel." 
 
 " True — and therefore were they peculiarly under my charge. 
 I have guaranteed the safety of the whites ; and none need my 
 protection so much as those who do not, by justice, obedience, 
 and gentleness, by gaining the good-will of their neighbours, 
 protect themselves." 
 
 " But Moyse did not murder any. .He was not even present 
 at any death." 
 
 " It has just been proved that, while he knew that slaughter 
 was going on, he took no measures to stop it. The ground of 
 his guilt is plain and clear. The law of the revolution of St. 
 Domingo, as conducted by me, is no retaliation. Every breach 
 of this law by an oflScer of mine is treason ; and every traitor to 
 the whites must die." 
 
 " Alas ! why so harsh now — only now ? Tou have spared 
 the guilty before, by tens, by hundreds. Why, now, cause all 
 this misery for this one young life ? " 
 
 " Those whom I have spared were my personal foes ; and I 
 spared them not so much for the sake of their separate lives, as 
 for the sake of the great principles for which I live and govern 
 — reconciliation and peace. For this end I pardoned them. For 
 this end I condemn Moyse." 
 
 " Tou make one tremble," said Th&ese, shuddering, " for 
 one's very self. What if I were to tell you that it is not Moyse 
 and Geniirede alone that " She stopped. 
 
 " That hate the whites ? I know it," replied Toussaint. " I 
 know that if God were to smite all among us who hate His chil- 
 dren of another race, there would be mourning in some of the 
 brightest dwellings of our land. I thank God that no commission 
 to smite such is given to me." 
 
 Therese was silent. 
 
 " My office is," said Toussaint, " to honour those (and they 
 are to be found in cottages all through the island) who forgive 
 their former oppressors, and forget their own wrongs. Here, as 
 elsewhere, we may take our highest lesson from the lowliest men. 
 My office is to honour such. As for the powerful, and those who 
 think themselves wise — their secret feelings towards all men are 
 between themselves and God." 
 
 " But if I could prove to you, at this moment, that Moyse's 
 enmity towards the whites is mild and harmless — his passions 
 moderation, compared with the tempest in the breasts of some 
 whom you employ and cherish — would not this soften you — 
 would it not hold your hand from inflicting that which no priest 
 can deny is injustice in God ? " 
 


## p. (#220) ################################################

2l6 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " I leave it to no priest, Th&ese, but to God HimseK, to yindi- 
 cate His own justice, by working as He will in the secret hearts, 
 or before the eyes of men. He may have, for those who hate 
 their enemies, punishments too great for me, or any ruler, to 
 wield; punishments to which the prison and the bullet are 
 nothing. Tou speak of the tempest within the breast : I know 
 at this moment, if you do not, that years of imprisonment, or a 
 hundred death-strokes, are mercy compared to it. But no more 
 of this ! I only say, Th^rese, that while Jacques " 
 
 " Say me too ! " 
 
 " While Jacques and you secretly hate, I have no concern with 
 it, except in my secret heart. But if that hatred, be it more or 
 less than that of this young man, should interfere with my duty 
 to friend or foe, you see, firom his fate, that I have no mercy 
 to grant. Jacques is my friend : Moyse was to have been my 
 son." 
 
 Neither could immediately speak. At length, Toussaint 
 signed once more to the chamber-door, and once more said — 
 
 "GenifredeP" 
 
 " I have something to teU you — something to show you," 
 replied Th&ese. " Her sleep or stupor came upon her suddenly : 
 but she kept a strong grasp upon the bosom of her dress. When 
 1 laid her on the bed, she kept her hands clasped one upon the 
 other there. As she slept more heavily, the fingers relaxed ; her 
 hands fell, and I saw one end of this." 
 
 She produced a phial. 
 
 " Ha ! the red water ! " exclaimed Toussaint. 
 
 " I thought it was," said Th^rese. 
 
 " Who taught her this ? Who has been tampering with her, 
 and with her life P " 
 
 " Perhaps this may tell," said Therese, showing the ivory ring. 
 
 Toussaint closely examined the ring, and then drew his hand 
 across his brows. 
 
 " How strange," said he, " are old thoughts, long forgotten ! 
 This bit of ivory makes me again a young man, and a slave. Do 
 you remember that I once had the care of the sick at Breda, and 
 administered medicines ? " 
 
 Therese shuddered. She remembered that when her infant 
 was taken ill, Papalier had sent for Toussaint, because, though 
 Toussaint was no longer surgeon to the quarter at Breda, he was 
 thought to have great knowledge and skUI. Toussaint remem- 
 bered nothing of this particular incident, and was not aware how 
 he had touched her feelings. He went on : 
 
 " I began that study as all of my race have begun it, tUl of 
 late, in superstition. With what awe did I handle charms like 
 this ! Can it be possible that my poor child has been wrought 
 upon by such jugglery ? What do you know about it ? "

A NIGHT Ot DISCIPLINE. 21/ 
 
 " No more than that the charm and the poison were hidden 
 in her bosom." 
 
 " It is hard to trouble a dying man," said Toussaint, " but 
 the survivor must be cared for. If Moyse has poisoned her mind, 
 as I much fear, he would have poisoned her body — But no — 
 it is an atrocious thought. If I wrong him — if hia lore for her 
 is faithful, he will be glad to tell me what he knows, that her 
 sick mind may be well tended. Father Laxabon is coming 
 presently, to go to Moyse, and leave him no more. I wiU go 
 with him." 
 
 " How you suffer ! How you must suffer ! " said Therfese, 
 again speaking her thoughts, as she looked in his face. 
 
 " It is worse than going to my death," replied he ; " but for 
 my child's sake — ^for my poor brother's sake, too — it must be 
 done." 
 
 He could say no more. Till Father Laxabon came, he paced 
 the room — he listened at the chamber door— he went out upon 
 the balcony, to hide, as Therese well understood, his tears of 
 agony. He again entered, listened again at the chamber-door, 
 and, hastily approaching the table, took up the phial, saying — 
 
 " Are you certain that this is all p Are you certain that she 
 only sleeps, and is not dying — or dead ? " 
 
 " Indeed, I am not certain," exclaimed Therese, starting up, 
 and softly entering the chamber. Toussaint followed with the 
 lamp, shading it carefully with his hand. 
 
 " Here is no pain," whispered Therese. "She breathes quietly. 
 There is no pain. Satisfy yourself." 
 
 She took the light from his hand, and saw him stoop above 
 his sleeping child, extending his hands over her, as if in the act 
 of prayer or blessing. 
 
 " No pain, thank God ! " he repeated, as they returned to the 
 salon, where they found Father Laxabon. 
 
 " Are you prepared, father, to deal with a spirit as perturbed 
 as that of the dead who cannot rest ? " 
 
 " Christ will strengthen me for my office, my son." 
 
 " And the other sviflerers P " 
 
 " My brethren are engaged with them. Every man of the 
 black troops wiU be shriven this night." 
 
 " Are there more doomed ? " asked Th&ese, faintly. 
 
 " There are. There are many guilty ; and of some I must 
 make an example. They know that they are guilty ; but they 
 know not yet which and how many are to be spared. The dis- 
 cipline of this night wiU, I trust, impress upon them that prin- 
 ciple of our revolution which they have hitherto failed to learn, 
 or have been tempted to forget. This night, father, will esta- 
 blish your precept and mine, and that of our Master — no eeta- 
 LIATION. If not, may God direct us, by whatever suffering, to

 some other method of teaching it ; for, at whatever cost, it must 
 be learned ! Let us begone." 
 
 " One moment," exclaimed Thdrese, in agitation. " You have 
 not told me when — whore " 
 
 " He dies on the Place, at sunrise — a military, not an ignomi- 
 nious death. Father Laxabon and I shall both be near at hand 
 when G^nifrede wakes. Tour task shall be shared, though we 
 must leave you now." 
 
 Moyse had been permitted to remain in the same apartment 
 which had been assigned to him after his arrest. When he heard 
 the key turn in the lock, he sprang from his seat to the door, 
 exclaiming — 
 
 " Tou nave come at last ! Oh, Genif rede ! to have kept me 
 waiting this last night ■" 
 
 He turned, and walked back to his seat, when he saw his 
 uncle and the priest. 
 
 " You expected Genifrede P " asked Toussaint. 
 
 " I did— naturally." 
 
 " She is asleep, and she must not be awakened. Yon would 
 be the last to wish it, Moyse." 
 
 " Must not be awakened," repeated Moyse to himself, with 
 something of doubt in his tone — sometliing of triumph in his 
 countenance. 
 
 " Perhaps you think," said Toussaint, fixing his eyes on the 
 young man's face, " that she cannot be awakened. Perhaps you 
 think that she may have drunk the red water ? " 
 
 " She has told, then. A curse upon woman's cowardice and 
 woman's treachery ! Who would not have sworn that if ever a 
 woman loved, Genifrede loved me P And now, when put to the 
 test " 
 
 " Now, when put to the test," interrupted Toussaint, " my 
 poor child was prepared to die with you, though you had per- 
 plexed her mind with superstition — terrified her with spells and 
 charms " 
 
 " You do not know her, uncle. She herself told me that she 
 dared not die with me, though it was the only " 
 
 " And you wished it — you required it ! You have striven to 
 destroy her, body and soul, because you yourseM were lost — 
 and now you curse a woman's cowardice and treachery ! I leave 
 you with Father Laxabon. Hasten to confess and cleanse your 
 soul, Moyse ; for never soul needed it more. 1 leave you my 
 pity and my forgiveness, and I engage for Genifrede's." 
 
 " Stop ! " cried Moyse, " I have something to ask. Who has 
 dared to keep Genifrede from me P She is mine." 
 
 " Think of her no more, except to implore Heaven's pardon 
 for your intent towards her." And Toussaint produced the 
 ivory ring and phial.

LAST MOMENTS. ZIQ 
 
 " Yes," exclaimed Moyse, " with that ring we obtained that 
 water, which we were to have drunk together." 
 
 " Here, then, I break the bond by which she was yom-s." 
 And Toussaint crushed the ring to dust with the heel of his 
 boot, and dashed the phial against the ceiling, from whence the 
 poisonous water sprinkled the floor. 
 
 " Tou spoke o± treachery just now," said Moyse. " How do 
 you propose to answer to my father for the charge he left you 
 in lue ? " 
 
 " Be silent, my poor son," said Father Laxabou. '' Do not 
 spend your remaining moments in aggravating your crimes." 
 
 " A few minutes' patience, father. I never before ventured 
 to speak freely to my uncle. Not on account of any severity of 
 his- -he never was severe to me — but on accoimt of a certain 
 awe I felt of him — an awe which the events of this day have 
 had a wonderful power to dispel." 
 
 " It is well," said Toussaint. " There should be no awe of the 
 creature when but a moment's darkness separates one from the 
 Creator. Speak freely and fearlessly, Moyse." 
 
 " I ask," said Moyse, in a somewhat softened tone, " how you 
 will answer to my father for the charge he left you in me F " 
 
 " Not by revealing to him the vices of the spirit he gave me 
 to guide. If your father's heart must be broken for yon, it shall 
 
 be for having thus lost a noble and gallant son, and not for 
 
 But it is no time for reproach from me. Let me go now, my 
 poor boy." 
 
 " Not yet, uncle. It is far from sunrise yet. How do you 
 mean to report of me to Genifrede ? WUl you make her detest 
 me P Will you work upon her fears — her fears of my ghost — 
 to make her seek refuge with another ? Will you trample on 
 the memory of the dead, to drive her into the arms of some living 
 lover, that you may no longer be reminded of the poor wretch 
 that you first fostered, and then murdered ? " 
 
 " Leave us ! " said Laxabon to Toussaint. " He is desperate. 
 Leave him to me, that he may not plunge deeper into sin with 
 every word he speaks." 
 
 " Presently, father. — Moyse, what Genifrede hears of you will 
 be according to what Father Laxabon has to report of your last 
 hours. Be assured that I shall not interpose between you and 
 her. It rests with yourself to justify her love, and engage her 
 affections to your memory. She has been laid to sleep this 
 night, not out of enmity to you, but to save her brain. As Pro- 
 vidence has decreed, it has also saved her life. When she 
 awakes, she will regard you as a martyr to a professional 
 necessity. A woman's love is sanctified and made immortal 
 when baptised in the blood of martyrdom. Hers may be so, if 
 your last moments are full of holy contrition, and purged from

 passion. Of Father Laxabon, and not of me, ^ill Genifrede 
 inquire concerning you." 
 
 " This is kind — this is generous," said Moyse, looking wistfully 
 in his uncle's face. 
 
 " And now,'' said Toussaint, " I have to ask you to be generous 
 to me. I need and implore your pardon, Moyse. WhUe you 
 were yet weak and wayward, I neglected the necessary watch 
 over you. Too prone to ease and satisfaction, for my child's 
 sake and my own, I too soon concluded you a man, and imposed 
 upon you the duties of a man. Tour failure is my condemnation. 
 I have cut short your discipline, and enabled you to throw away 
 your life. All this, and much more, am I answerable for. 
 Whether or not God may have mercy, can you yield me your 
 pardon ? I implore it, Moyse." 
 
 Moyse gazed at him in astonishment, and then cast himself at 
 his uncle's feet, clinging to his knees, and crying — 
 
 " Save me ! uncle, save me ! Ton can — you will " 
 
 " No, Moyse, I will not — I cannot," declared Toussaint, in a 
 voice which silenced even that most piercing of all sounds — ^the 
 cry for life. 
 
 "Not one word !" continued L'Ouverture. " Keep your en- 
 treaties for Him who alone can help you. Kneel to Him alone. 
 Rise, Moyse, and only say, if you can say it, that your last prayer 
 for me shall be for pardon." 
 
 The awe of man was not destroyed in Moyse. He looked 
 humbly upon the ground, as he again stood before his uncle, and 
 said — 
 
 "My destruction is my own work; and I have felt this 
 throughout. But if you have ever done me wrong, may it bo 
 forgotten before God, as it is by me ! I know of no such 
 wrong." 
 
 " Thank God ! " cried Toussaint, pressing him to his breast. 
 " This is the temper which will win mercy." 
 
 " Leave us now," said Father Laxabon, once more ; and this 
 time he was obeyed. 
 
 CHAPTER XXIV.

 TH:EEi)SE was. struck with awe as she stood, from time to time, 
 beside the bed on which lay Genifrede. The room was so 
 darkened that nothing was to be seen; but there she lay, 
 breathing calmly, motionless, unconscious, while the blessings 
 and hopes of her young life were falling fast into ruins around

A MELTING SCENE. 221 
 
 her. It seemed treacherous, cruel, thus to beguile her of that 
 tremendous night — ^to let these last hours of the only life she 
 prized pass away unused — to deprive her of the last glances of 
 those eyes which were presently to be dim in death — of the 
 latest tones of that voice which soon would never speak more. 
 It seemed an irreparable injury to rob her of these hours of in- 
 tense life, and to substitute for them a blank and barren sleep. 
 But it was done. It was done to save her intellect; it had 
 probably saved her life ; and she could not now be wakened to 
 any purpose. With sickening heart, Therese saw the moonlight 
 disturbed by grey light from the east. In a few minutes, 
 the sun would leap up from the sea, to quench not only the 
 gleams of moon and star, but the more sacred lamp of human 
 life. Brief as was always the twilight there, never had the 
 gushing in of light appeared so hasty, so peremptory as now. 
 By the rousing up of the birds, by the stir of the breezes, by 
 the quick unfolding of the flowers, it seemed as if Nature her- 
 self had turned against her wretched children, and was im- 
 patient tUl their doom was fulfilled. Therese resolved to 
 return no more to the chamber till all should be over, lest light 
 and sound should enter with her, and the sufferer be roused too 
 soon. 
 
 As the yellow rays shone in fuller and fuller, the watcher's 
 nerves were so stretched, that though she wrapped her head in 
 her shawl as she sat, she felt as if the rustle of every leaf, the 
 buzz of every insect-wing in the gardens, reached her ear. She 
 heard at intervals the tap of a distant drum, and, she was cer- 
 taiu, a discharge of fire-arms — not in a volley from the Place 
 d' Armes, as she had expected, but further off, and mere dropping 
 shot. This occurred so often, that she was satisfied it was 
 not the execution ; and, while she drew a deep breath, hardly 
 knew whether to feel relieved or not. The door from the corri- 
 dor presently opened and closed again, before she could throw 
 back the shawl from her face. She tiew to the door, to see if 
 any one was there who could give her news. M. Pascal was 
 walking away toward the further end. When she issued forth, 
 he turned and apologised for having interrupted her, believing 
 that the salon would be unoccupied at this early hour. 
 
 " Tell me — only tell me," said she, " whether it is over." 
 
 "Not the principal execution — it is about going forward 
 now. I came away — I saw what melted my soul ; and I could 
 endure no more." 
 
 " Ton saw L'Ouverture ? " said Madame Dessalines, anxi- 
 ously. 
 
 M. Pascal went back with her into the salon, as glad to re- 
 lieve his mind as she was eager to hear. 
 
 " I saw," said he, " what I never could have conceived of.

 and would never have believed upon report. I have seen man 
 as a god among his feUow-men." 
 
 A gleam of satisfaction lighted up Madame Dessalines' face, 
 through its agony. 
 
 " It was too touching, too mournful to be endured," resimied 
 M. Pascal. " The countenances of those poor creatures will haunt 
 me to my dying hour. Never was man idolised like L'Ouver- 
 ture. For him, men go willingly to their deaths — not in the 
 excitement of a common danger ; not for glory or for a bright 
 future — but solitary, in if,'nominy, in the light of a calm sunrise, 
 with the eyes of a condemning multitude upon them. Without 
 protest, without supplication — as it appears, without objection 
 —they stoop to death at his word." 
 
 " I do not know — I do not understand what has been done," 
 said Therese. " But does not every black know that L'Ouver- 
 ture has no private interests — nothing at heart but the good of 
 -us all?" 
 
 " That is the spell," replied Pascal. " This sacrifice of his 
 nephew will confirm it with my countrymen, as well as with 
 yours, for ever. These thirteen others — ^for he has sacrificed 
 thirteen of the soldiers, for dereliction of duty in the late rising 
 — these thirteen are from the garrison of Cap, chiefly, though it 
 is said two or three are from Limbe. All the soldiery from these 
 two places, and from Port Dauphin, are upon the Place. L'Ou- 
 verture stood in the midst and addressed them. He told them 
 that it was needless to explain to them what they had been 
 learning from his whole course of conduct, since he was chosen 
 by the blacks to lead and govern them. It was needless to insist 
 on the protection due to every inhabitant of the colony, and 
 especially the whites ; and on the primary duty of a liberated 
 race— that of keeping the peace. They knew their duty as well 
 as he did ; and those who had violated it should suffer the long- 
 declared and inevitable punishment of death. All knew that 
 everything was prepared on the rampart, near at hand. L'Ou- 
 verture walked slowly along each line of the soldiery ; and I 
 declare to you, Madame, that though all knew that he was 
 selecting victims for instant death, there was passionate love in 
 every face." 
 
 " I believe it," said Th&ese. " And he .P " 
 
 " He was calm ; but a face of deeper sorrow never did I see. 
 He is ten years older since last night. He spoke aloud the 
 names of the most guilty, according to their own previous 
 account of themselves to him, and the committee of investiga- 
 tion." 
 
 " And no one of the thirteen resisted ? " 
 
 " Not one. One by one they joined their hands, bowed their 
 heads humbly before him, and repaired where he pointed— to

 be shot. There was a spell upon me. I could not come 
 away, though feeling at every moment as if I could endure 
 no more. I did not, however, stay to see General Moyse brought 
 out " 
 
 As he was speaking, there was heard the heavy roll of drums 
 at a distance, followed by a volley of musketry. 
 
 " That is it," cried M. Pascal ; and he was gone. Th&fese 
 sank back upon a sofa, and again drew her shawl over her head. 
 She desired, in the sickness of her heart, never to see the day- 
 light more. 
 
 She knew not how long it was before the door was again 
 gently opened. She did not move; but she presently heard 
 Father Laxabon's soft voice, saying — 
 
 " Pardon, Madame, but I am compelled to ask where is 
 Mademoiselle L'Ouverture ? " 
 
 " She is asleep," said Th^rese, rousing herself — " asleep, if 
 indeed she be not dead. If this last sound did not rouse her, 
 1 think the trumpet of doom will scarcely reach her soul." 
 
 This last sound had roused Geuif rede. She did not recognise 
 it; she was not aware what had wakened her; but she had 
 started up, supposed it night, but felt so oppressed that she 
 sprang from the bed, with a confused wonder at finding herself 
 djessed, and threw open the door to the salon. There she now 
 stood, bewildered with the sudden light, and looking doubtful 
 whether to advance or go back. 
 
 "My daughter " said Father Laxabon. She came for- 
 ward with a docile and wistful look. " My daughter," he con- 
 tinued, " I bring you some comfort." 
 
 " Comfort P " she repeated, doubtingly. 
 
 " Not now. Father," interposed Th^rese. " Spare her." 
 
 " Spare me ? " repeated Genifrede in the same tone. 
 
 " I bring her comfort," said the father, turning reprovingly to 
 Madame Dessalines. " His conilict is over, my daughter," he 
 continued, advancing to Genifrede. " His last moments were 
 composed ; and as for his state of mind in confession " 
 
 He was stopped by a shriek so appalling, that he recoiled 
 as if shot, and supported himself against the wall. Genifrede 
 rushed back to the chamber, and drove something heavy against 
 the door. Therese was there in an instant, listening, and then 
 imploring, in a voice which, it might be thought, no one could 
 resist — 
 
 " Let me in, love ! It is Th&ese. No one else shall come. 
 If yon love me, let me in." 
 
 There was no answer. 
 
 " You have killed her, I believe," she said to the priest, who 
 was walking up and down in gi'eat disturbance — not vsdth him. 
 self, but with the faithless creature of passion he had to deal with.

 " The windows ! " exclaimed Th^rese, vexed not to have 
 thought of this before. She stepped out upon the balcony. One 
 of the chamber-windows was open, and she entered. No one 
 was there. G&ifrede must have fled down the steps from the 
 balcony into the gardens ; and there Therese hastened after her. 
 In one of the fenced walks leading to the fountain, she saw the 
 fluttering of her clothes. 
 
 " The reservoir ! " thought Thdrese, in despair. 
 
 She was not mistaken. G&ifrede stood on the brink of the 
 deep and brimming reservoir — her hands were clasped above her 
 head for the plunge, when a strong hand seized her arm, and 
 drew her irresistibly back. In ungovernable rage she turned, 
 and saw her father. 
 
 " They say," she screamed, " that every one worships you. 
 Not true now ! Never true more ! I hate — I curse " 
 
 He held up his right hand with the action of authority which 
 had awed her childhood. It awed her now. Her voice sank 
 into a low shuddering and muttering. 
 
 " That any one should have dared to tell you — that ^ny one 
 should have interfered between me and my poor child ! " he 
 said, as if involuntarily, while seating her on the fresh grass. 
 He threw himself down beside her, holding her hands, and 
 covering them with kisses. 
 
 " This sod is fresh and green," said he ; " but would we were 
 all lying under it ! " 
 
 " Do you say so P " murmured Genif rede. 
 
 " God forgive me ! " he replied. " But we are all wretched." 
 
 " Tou repent, then ? " said Genifrede. " Well you may ! 
 There are no more such, now you have killed him. Tou should 
 have repented sooner : it is too late now." 
 
 " I do not repent, Genifrede ; but I mourn, my child." 
 
 " There are no more such," pursued she. " He was gallant." 
 
 " He was." 
 
 " He was all life : there was no deadness, no coldness — he 
 was all life." 
 
 " He was, my child." 
 
 " And such a lover ! " she continued, with something of a 
 strange proud smile. 
 
 "He was a lover, Genifrede, who made your parents proud." 
 
 " Such a soldier ! " she dreamed on. " War was his sport, 
 while I trembled at home. He had a soldier's heart." 
 
 Her father was silent ; and she seemed to miss his voice, 
 though she had not appeared conscious of his replies. She 
 started, and sprang to her feet. 
 
 " Ton will go home now, G&if rede," said her father. " With 
 Madame Dessalines yon will go. Tou will go to your mother 
 and sister."

 "Home!" she exclaimed with loathing. "Yes, I must go 
 home," she said, hurriedly. " Ton love Pongaudin — you call it 
 paradise. I wish you joy of it now ! Ton have put an evil 
 spirit into it. I wish you joy of your paradise ! " 
 
 She disengaged herself from him as she spoke, and walked 
 away. Therese, who had drawn hack on seeing that she was in 
 her father's care, now intercepted her path, met her, and drew 
 her arm within hers. Toussaint, who was following, retreated 
 for a moment, to ease his agony by a brief prayer for his child, 
 and for guidance and strength. Having acknowledged with 
 humiliation that he found his mission well-nigh too hard for him, 
 and imploring for the wounded in spirit the consolation which 
 ho would willingly purchase for his brother and his child by a 
 life of woe for himself, he repaired to his chamber of audience ; 
 where, for the rest of the morning, he appeared wholly engrossed 
 by the affairs of the citizens of Cap. The steadiness of his 
 attention to business was felt by his still agitated secretary as a 
 rebuke to his own wandering thoughts. 
 
 CHAPTER XXV. 
 
 PBECH OP THE EAVBN. 
 
 Etjphbostnb's life in the convent was duU and weary. It 
 would probably have been so anywhere, for some time after the 
 old man's death : but elsewhere there would have been more to 
 do and to amuse herself with. Every one was kind to her — too 
 kind. She had been accustomed to the voice of chiding during 
 all the years that she had lived with her grandfather ; and she 
 did not mind it. It would now have been something of a relief, 
 something welcome and familiar, to have been called " child " 
 and " little fool " at times, instead of being told at every turn 
 that she was an angel and a love, and finding that she was every 
 one's pet, from the abbess to old Raphael. 
 
 The kindness of the household had begun from the moment 
 the poor girl appeared, after having been consoled by Father 
 Gabriel, and visited by Pierre, and the guardian to whose care 
 her grandfather had confided her person and her property. Pierre 
 had engaged to see her daily tOl the furniture should have been 
 sold, and the house shut up, and he himself about to embark for 
 France, with the savings of his long service. Her guardian, M. 
 Oritois, knew but little of young people, and how to talk to them. 
 He had assured her that he mourned extremely the loss of his 
 old acquaintance — the acquaintance of so many years — and so 
 O

 lost. He declared his desire of discharging his office of guardian 
 so as to prove himself worthy of the trust, and his hope that he 
 and his ward should be very good friends. At present, it was 
 his wish that she should remain where she was ; and he asked 
 whether she did not find every one very kind to her. Euphro- 
 syne could just say, " Tes ; " but she was crying too much to be 
 able to add, that she hoped she should not have to remain in the 
 convent very long. M. Critois saw that she was struggling to 
 say something : but, after waiting a mhiute, he stroked her hair, 
 promised to come again some day soon, lioped she would cheer 
 up, had no doubt she would be very happy — and was gone, glad 
 to have done with sobbing girls for this day. 
 
 When the gates had closed upon him, the petting began. The 
 abbess decreed that Euphrosyne should have the sole chai-ge of 
 her mocking-bird. Sister Angelique, who made the prettiest 
 artificial flowers in the world, invited her to her apartment at 
 all reasonable hours, when she might have a' curiosity to see to 
 learn the process. Sister Celestine had invented a new kind of 
 comfit which she begged Euphrosyne to try, leaving a paper of 
 sweetmeats on her table for that purpose. Old Raphael had 
 gained leave to clear a parterre in the garden which was to be 
 wholly hers, and where he would rear such flowers as she parti- 
 cularly admired. Father Gabriel himself, after pointing out to 
 her the uncertainty of life, the sudden surprises of death, and 
 the care with which it becomes social beings to discharge their 
 duties to each other, since they know not how soon they may be 
 parted — the serious Father Gabriel himself recommended her to 
 amuse herseK, and to remember how her grandfather had liked 
 to see her gay. She had, no doubt, been a good girl on the 
 whole ; and she could not now do better than continue the con- 
 duct which had pleased the dep.irted in the days that were gone. 
 
 Petted people generally prove perverse ; and so, in the opinion 
 of the universal household, did Euphrosyne. There could be no 
 doubt of her love for her grandfather. One need but see the 
 sudden tears that sprang, twenty times in a day, when any re- 
 membrance of him was awakened. One need but watch her 
 wistful looks cast up towards his balcony, whenever she was in 
 the garden. Yet, when any one expressed indignation against 
 his murderers, she was silent, or she ran away, or she protested 
 against it. Such was the representation which sister Claire made 
 to her reverend mother, on the first opportunity. 
 
 " I was not aware that it was exactly so," replied the abbess. 
 " It appears to me that she dislikes to hear any parties made 
 answerable for the murder but those by whose hands it was 
 actually done. She " 
 
 The abbess stopped, and sister Claire started, at the sound of 
 musketry.

TERKIBLE JUSTfCE. 22/ 
 
 " Another shot ! " said the abbess. " It is a fearful execution. 
 I should have been glad to have removed this poor child out of 
 hearing of these shots; but I had no notice of vrhat was to 
 happen, till the streets were too full for her to appear in 
 them." 
 
 " A piece of L'Ouverture's haste ! " said sister Claire. 
 
 " A fresh instance, perhaps, of his wise speed," observed the 
 abbess. " Events seem to show that he understands the conduct 
 of affairs better than you and I, my daughter." 
 
 " Again ! Hark ! Oh, mercy ! " cried sister Claire, as the sound 
 of a prolonged voUey reached them. 
 
 " Let us hope it is the last," said the abbess, with changing 
 colour. " Christ save their sinful souls ! " 
 
 The door opened, and Euphrosyne entered, in excessive 
 agitation. 
 
 " Madame," she cried, gasping for breath, " do you hear that P 
 Do you know what it is P They have shot General Moyse ! 
 Father Gabriel says so. — Oh no, no ! L'Ouverture never wouhl 
 do anything so cruel." 
 
 Sister Claire looked at the abbess. 
 
 "My daughter," said the abbess, "L'Ouverture's duty is to 
 execute justice." 
 
 " Oh, Genifrede ! Poor, poor Gdnifrede ! She will die too. 
 I hope she is dead." 
 
 " Hush, my child ! Her life is in God's hands." 
 
 " Oh, how cruel ! how cruel ! " the girl went on, sobbing. 
 
 ""What would L'Ouverture say," interposed sister Claii-e, "if 
 he knew that you, of all people, called him cruel P Have you to- 
 day put on this P " she continued, calling Euphrosyne's attention 
 to her new mourning ; " and do you call it cruel to execute 
 justice on tli* rebels and their officers ? " 
 
 "It is a natural and amiable grief in Euphrosyne," said the 
 abbess ; '' and if it is not quite reasonable, we can give her time 
 to reflect. She is among friends, who will not report the words 
 of her hours of sorrow." 
 
 " Tou may — you may,'' cried Euphrosyne. " Tou may tell 
 the whole world that it is cruel to — to — They were to have been 
 married so very soon ! — Afra wrote me all about it." 
 
 The abbess repeated what she had said about L'Ouverture's 
 office, and the requirements of justice. 
 
 " Justice ! justice ! " exclaimed Euphrosyne. " There has 
 been no justice till now ; and so the first act is nothing but 
 cruelty." 
 
 The abbess with a look dismissed sister Claire, who, by her 
 report of Euphrosyne's rebellion against justice, sent in Father 
 Gabriel. 
 
 " Euphrosyne thinks, father," reported the abbess, " that these

 negroes, in consideration of their ignorance, and of their anger 
 at having once been slaves, should be excused for whatever they 
 may do now, in revenge." 
 
 " I am surprised," said Father Gabriel. 
 
 So was Euphrosyne when she heard her argument thus 
 stated. 
 
 " I only mean," said she, striving to subdue her sobs ; " I 
 only mean that I wish sister Claire, and sister Benoite, and all of 
 them, would not want me to be glad and revengeful." 
 
 " Glad and revengeful ! " repeated Father Gabriel. " That 
 would be diflSoult." 
 
 " It makes me very miserable — it can do no good now — it 
 could not bring grandpapa to life again, if every negro in Limbe 
 were shot," she continued, as tears rained down her cheeks. 
 " Dear grandpapa never wished any Ul to anybody — he never did 
 anybody any harm " 
 
 The priest and the abbess exchanged glances. 
 
 " Why do you suppose these wretched blacks killed him, my 
 dear?" 
 
 " T do not know why they rose, this one particular time. But 
 I believe they have always risen because the whites have been 
 proud and cruel ; because the whites used to put them in chains, 
 and whip them, and part mothers and children. After doing all 
 this, and after bringing them up ignorant and without religion, 
 we expect them to forgive everything that has passed, while we 
 will not forgive them ourselves. But I will — I wiU forgive them 
 my share. For all that you religious people may say, I will 
 forgive them : and I am not afraid of what grandpapa would 
 think. I hope he is in a place now where there is no question 
 about forgiving those who have injured us. The worst thing is, 
 the thing that I cannot understand is, how L'Onverture could do 
 anything so cruel." 
 
 " I have a word to say to you, my dear," said the priest, with 
 a sign to the abbess. 
 
 " Oh, father ! " replied the abbess, in an imploring tone. 
 
 " We must bring her to a right view, reverend sister. 
 Euphrosyne, if your grandfather had not been the kind master 
 you suppose him — if he had been one of the cruel whites you 
 spoke of just now, if his own slaves had always hated him, 
 and " 
 
 " Do stop ! " said Euphrosyne, colouring crimson. " I cannot 
 bear to hear you speak so, fatlier." 
 
 " Tou must bear, my child, to listen to what it is good for you 
 to hear. If he had been disliked by every black in the colony, 
 and they had sought his life out of revenge, would you still be 
 angry that justice was done, and ungrateful that he is avenged ? " 
 
 "Tou talk of avenging— you, a Christian priest!" said

EUPHROSYNES SYMPATHY. 229 
 
 Euphrosyne. " Tou talk of justice — you, who slander the 
 dead!" 
 
 " Peace, my daughter," said the abbess, very gently. 
 " Remember where you are, and whom you speak to." 
 
 " Remember where my grandfather is," cried Euphrosyne. 
 " Remember that he is in his grave, and that I am left to speak 
 for him. However," she said — and, in these few moments, a 
 thousand confirmations of the priest's words had rushed upon her 
 memory — a thousand tokens of the mutual fear and hatred of her 
 grandfather and the black race, a thousand signs of his 
 repugnance to visit Le Bosquet — " however," she resumed, in a 
 milder tone, and with an anxious glance at Father Gabriel's face, 
 " Father Gabriel only said ' if ' — if aU that he described had 
 been so." 
 
 " True, my chUd," replied the abbess : " Father Gabriel only 
 said ' if it had been so.' " 
 
 " And if it had," exclaimed Euphrosyne, who did not wish to 
 hear the father speak again at the moment — " if it had been so, 
 it would have been wicked in the negroes to do that act in 
 revenge ; but it could never, never excuse us from forgiving them 
 — from pitying them because they had been made cruel and 
 revengertil. I am sure I wish they had all lived — ^that they 
 might live many, many years, till they could forget those cruel 
 old times, and, being old men themselves, might feel what it is 
 to touch an old man's life. This is the kind of punishment I 
 wish them ; and I am sure it would be enough." 
 
 " It is indeed said," observed the abbess, " ' Vengeance is 
 mine ; I will repay, saith the Lord.' " 
 
 " And oh ! poor Genifrede ! " pursued Euphrosyne. " She no 
 more wished ill to my parent than I do to hers ; and her lover — 
 
 it was not he that did it : and yet Oh, Father Gabiiel, are you 
 
 sure that that firing — that last volley " 
 
 " It was certainly the death stroke of Moyse. I perceive how 
 it is, my child. I perceive that your friendships among this 
 new race have blinded your eyes, so that you cannot see that 
 t]iese executions are, indeed, God's avenging of the murder by 
 which you are made a second time an orphan." 
 
 " Do you think L'Ouvertufe right, then P I should be glad to 
 believe that he was not cruel — dreadfully cruel." 
 
 " There is no doubt of L'Ouverture's being wise and right — of 
 his having finally assured the most unwilling of the inhabitants 
 of their security, and his stern justice. There is no doubt that 
 L'Ouverture is right." 
 
 "I could not have believed," said the abbess, "that my 
 daughter would have required a justification of anything done 
 by L'Ouverture." 
 
 " Nor I," said Euphrosyne, sighing.

230 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " Under him," said Father Gabriel, " there is less crime in the 
 colony than, I verily believe, in any other part of the empire. 
 Under him have homes become sacred, children are instructed, 
 and brethren are taught to dwell together in unity." 
 
 " As," said the abbess, " when he stopped in his journey to 
 greet an old negro of ninety-nine, and reconcile to him two who 
 had ofEended out of his many children. L'Ouverture is never 
 in so much haste but that he can pause to honour old age : never 
 too busy for works of mercy. If the peace-makers are blessed, so 
 is he." 
 
 " And where," continued the father, " where are the poor ? 
 We can observe his continual admonitioii to works of mercy, by 
 nursing the sick, and consoling the afiUcted ; but we have no 
 longer any poor. By Ms wisdom, he has won over all to labour. 
 The fields are thronged with labourers : the bays are crowded 
 with ships : the store-houses are overflowing with food and 
 merchandise : and there is a portion for all." 
 
 " And it was the French," said Euphrosyne, " who made this 
 last commotion. If they had let L'Ouverture alone, how happy 
 we might all have been ! Now, Genifrede will never be happy 
 again. If L'Ouverture could only have forgiven this once ! But, 
 father, I have no comfort — and never shall have comfort, as long 
 as I think that men have been murdered for iojuring us." 
 
 "Pray for comfort, my child. In prayer you will find 
 consolation." 
 
 " I dare not pray, now this has happened. If they were but 
 alive, how I would pray for them!" 
 
 " They are alive, my daughter, and where they much need 
 your prayers. Pray for them, and your intercession may be heard." 
 
 Euphrosyne saw that her feelings were not understood ; and 
 she said no more. She listened to all the teaehings that were 
 offered her, and reserved her doubts and troubles for Afra's ear. 
 Afra would tell her whether it could be right in euch a Christian 
 as L'Ouvertni-e to render violence for violence. As for what the 
 father and the abbess said about the effect of ejcample, and the 
 necessity and the benefit of assuring and conciliating the whites, 
 by sacrificing negro ofEenders for tlieir sakes, she dissented from 
 it altogether. She had witnessed Toussaiut's power — the power 
 with which his spirit of gentleness and forbearance endowed him ; 
 and she believed that, if he would but try, he would find he 
 could govern better by declaring always for the right and against 
 the wrong, and leaving vengeance to God, than by the violent 
 death of all the ignorant and violent men in the island. She 
 would ask A.fra. She was pretty sure Afra would think as she 
 did : and, if so, the time might come — it made her breathless to 
 think of it, but she could not help thinking of it every day — 
 the time might come when she might ask Toussaint himself what

EUPHROSYNE'S FRIEND. 23 I 
 
 y.e thought was exactly meant, iu all cases, by forgiving our 
 enemies ; and particularly whether this did not extend to for- 
 giving other people's enemies, and using no vengeance and no 
 violence at aU. 
 
 This idea of seeing Afi-a gained strength under all the circum- 
 stances of her present life. It Father Gabriel offered her comfort 
 which was no comfort, or reproved her when she did not feel 
 herself wrong ; if the abbess praised her for anything she had 
 not designed to be particularly right; if the sisters applauded 
 sayings which she was conscious wore not wise; if her heart 
 ached for her grandfather's voice or countenance ; if M. Oritois 
 visited her, or Pierre did not ; if her lesson in history was hard, 
 or her piece of needle-work dull ; if her flowers faded, or her 
 bird sang so finely that she would have been proud for the world 
 to hear it — the passion for seeing Afra was renewed. Afra 
 would explain all she could not understand, would teach her 
 what she wanted to know. Afra would blame her where she was 
 aware she was wrong, instead of bidding her be quit of it with a 
 few prayers, while laying much heavier stress upon something 
 that she could cure much more easily. Afra wrote her a few 
 letters, which were read by the abbess before they were de- 
 livered to her ; and many more which Pierre slipped into her 
 hand during their occasional interviews. She herself wrote such 
 prodigiously long letters to Afra, that to read them through 
 would have been too great an addition to the reverend mother's 
 business. She glanced over the first page and the last; and, 
 seeing that they contained criticisms on Alexander the Great, 
 and pity for Socrates, and questions about flower-painting and 
 embroidery, she skipped all that lay between. 
 
 It was not that Euphrosyne did not love and ti'ust the abbess. 
 She loved her so as to open to her all but the inner chambers of 
 her heart ; and she trusted her with all but other persons' con- 
 cerns. The middle pages of her letters contained speculation 
 chiefly : speculation, in the first place, on Afra's future destiny, 
 names and events being shrouded under mysterious expressions ; 
 and, in the second place, on points of morals, which might be 
 referred to M. Pascal, whose opinion was of great value. Eu- 
 phrosyne had a strong persuasion, all the while, that she should 
 one day tell her reverend mother the whole. She knew that she 
 should not object to her seeing every line that Afra held of hers. 
 Whatever was clandestine in the correspondence was for the 
 sake of avoiding restraint, and not because she was ashamed of 
 any of her thoughts. 
 
 One morning the abbess found her in the garden, listlessly 
 watching the hues of a bright lizard, as it lay panting in the 
 sun. The abbess put her arm round her waist, while stooping to 
 look.

 " How it glitters ! " said she. " It is a pretty piece of God's 
 handiwork : but we must leave it now, my dear. This sun is 
 too hot for you. Tour chamber, or sister Claire's room, is the 
 fittest place for you at this hour. You find your chamber 
 cool?" 
 
 " Tes, madam." 
 
 " The new ventilator works well ? " 
 
 " Yes, madam." 
 
 " You find— this way, my dear — ^this alley is the most shady

 " Yes, madam." 
 
 "And your toilet-cover — sister Marie's work — ^is, I think, 
 extremely pretty : and the book-shelf that Father Gabriel gave 
 you very convenient. Your friends here, my dear, are fond of 
 you. They are anxious to make you happy." 
 
 " They are all very kind to me, madam." 
 
 " I am glad you are sensible of it. You are not of an un- 
 grateful nature, we all know." 
 
 " I hope not : but, madam, I cannot stay here always." 
 
 " I was going to say, my dear, that we have not done every- 
 thing in our power for you yet. We must not forget thai 
 we grave women must be dull companions for a girl like 
 you." 
 
 " It is not that, reverend mother. But I cannot stay here

 " You wiU find it a very different thing when you have a 
 companion of your own age, which I hope will be the case very

 eveiy way worthy of being your companion " 
 
 " But, madam, I do not want that — I do not wish for any 
 companion while I am here. I had much rather be alone ; but 
 
 " But you would like to leave us — eh ? Tou would like to be 
 on a plantation, where you could amuse yourself with playing 
 with the little negroes, and driving about the country, and visit- 
 ing your neighbom-s two or three times a week P " 
 
 Euphrosyne smUed, and plucked a twig to play with. 
 
 " You would like," continued the abbess, " to live with ac- 
 complished people — to have a fine library, to lie on a couch and 
 read during the hot hours ; and to sing gay songs in the piazza 
 in the evening." 
 
 Euphrosyne smiled again. 
 
 " You would like," the abbess went on, " to dance, night after 
 night, and to make pic-nic parties to the cacao walks, and to the 
 shore. Tou would like to win over your guardian to let you 
 have your own way in everything : and, to be sure, in comparison 
 with his house, our convent '

AN ABBESS ON LOVE. 233 
 
 " My guardian ! " exclaimed Euphrosyne. ' ' Live at M. Oritois' ! 
 Oh no ! " And she laughed as she went on — 
 
 " He would be telling me every day that we should be very 
 good friends. He would be saying all day long that it was his 
 desire fully to discharge his duty to me. I can hardly help 
 shaking off his hand now, when he strokes my hair : and, if it 
 came to his doing it every morning, we should certainly quan-el. 
 They say Madame Critois never speaks ; so I suppose she admires 
 his conversation too much to interrupt it. There she and I should 
 never agree. — Live at my guardian's ! Oh no ! " 
 
 " You were thinking of some other house while I was de- 
 scribing your guardian's, my dear. What were you thinking 
 of ? Where would you live f " 
 
 Euphrosyne plucked another twig, having pulled the first to 
 pieces. She smiled again, blushed, and said she would tell her 
 reverend mother very soon what home she was thinking of : she 
 could not tell to-day ; but in a little while 
 
 " In the meantime," said the abbess, with a scrutinising gaze, 
 — " in the meantime, I conclude Father Gabriel knows all that 
 is in your mind." 
 
 " Tou will know in good time what I am thinking of, madam : 
 everybody will know." 
 
 The abbess was troubled. 
 
 " This is beginning early," she said, as if thinking aloud ; 
 " this is beginning early with the mysteries and entanglements 
 of life and the world ! How wonderful it is to look on, to be a 
 witness of these things for two or three successive generations ! 
 How every young creature thinks her case something wholly 
 new — the emotions of her awakened heart something that God 
 never before witnessed, and that man never conceived of ! After 
 all that has been written about love, upon the cavern walls of 
 Hindoo temples, and in the hieroglyphics of old Egypt, and 
 printed over all the mountains and valleys of the world by that 
 deluge which was sent to quench unhallowed love, every young 
 girl believes in her day that something unheard-of has happened 
 when the dream has fallen upon her. My dear child, listen to 
 one who knows more of life than you do — to one who would 
 have you happy, not only in the next world, but in this." 
 
 " Thank you, reverend mother." 
 
 " Love is holy and blessed, my dear, when it comes in its due 
 season — when it enters into a mind disciplined for new duties, 
 and a heart waiting for new affections. In one who has no mother 
 to help and comfort " 
 
 " No mother, it is true," said Euphrosyne. 
 
 " The mother is the parent naturally most missed," said the 
 abbess, supposing she was reading her pupU^s mind. " Where 
 there is no mother by a j'oung girl's side, and no brothers and

 sisters to serve, the fancy and the heart are apt to fix prematurely 
 on some object — too likely, in that case, to be one which will 
 deceive and fail. But, my dear, such a young girl owes duty to 
 herseK, if God has seen fit to make her solitary in the world." 
 
 " One cannot say solitary," interposed Euphrosyne, " or 
 without duties.' 
 
 " Tou are right, my love. No one is, indeed, solitary in life, 
 (blessed be God !) nor without duties. As I was going to say, 
 such a young girl's business is to apply herself diligently to her 
 education, during the years usually devoted to instruction. This 
 is the work appointed to her youth. If, while her mind is yet 
 ignorant, her judgment inexperienced, and her tastes actually 
 unformed, she indulges any afl'ection or fancy which makes her 
 studies tedious, liei- companions dull, and her mind and spirits 
 listless, she has fallen into a fearful snare." 
 
 " How long then would you have a girl's education go on ? 
 And if her lover be very particularly wise and learned, do not 
 you think she may learn more from him than in any other way ? 
 And if she be not dull and listless, but very happy " 
 
 " Every girl," interrupted the abbess, with a grave smile, 
 " thinks her lover the wisest man in the world : and no girl in 
 love would exchange her dreams for the gayest activity of the 
 fancy-free." 
 
 "Well, but, as to the age," persisted Euphrosyne; "how 
 soon " 
 
 '■ That depends upon circumstances, my dear. But in all 
 cases, I consider sixteen too early." 
 
 "Sixteen! Yes. But nineteen— or, one may say, twenty. 
 Twenty, next mouth but one." 
 
 " My dear," said the abbess, stopping short, " you do not 
 mean to say " 
 
 " Indeed, madam," said Euphrosyne, very earnestly, " Afra 
 will be twenty in two months. I know her age to a day, 
 
 " And yon have been speaking of Mademoiselle Raymond all 
 this time ! WeU, weU " 
 
 " And you were thinking of me, I do believe. Oh, madam, 
 how could you ! Why, I never saw anybody." 
 
 " I was wondering how it could be," said the abbess, striving 
 to conceal her amusement and satisfaction. " I was surprised 
 that you should have seen any one yet ; and I was going to give 
 you a lecture about half-confidences with Father Gabriel." 
 
 " And I could not conceive what Father Gabriel had to do 
 with Afra's affairs, orTiow you came to know anything about it. 
 I have let it out now, however ; and I do not know what Afra 
 will say." 
 
 " You have not told me who the gentleman is, you know ; so

 there is not much harm done. No, do not tell me, my dear, till 
 Mademoiselle Raymond desires it." 
 
 " Oh, I may as well, now you know so mucli. I dare say Afra 
 would have no objection ; particularly as you will then under- 
 stand what I meant about living somewhere else. When you 
 talked of a fine library," she continued, laughiag, " how could 
 I suppose you were thinking of any in the colony but M. 
 Pascal's ? " 
 
 " So he is the gentleman," said the abbess. " How times are 
 changed ! A lady of colour may be Madame Pascal now, with- 
 out reproach." 
 
 " I am glad it is out,'' said Euphrosyue, gaily. " I can spt'ak 
 now to somebody about Afra. Oh, madam, you do not know, 
 you cannot imagine, how they love one another." 
 
 " Cannot I ? " — and the abbess sighed. 
 
 "And I may look forward to living with them. They say I 
 may, madam. They say I must. And surely my guardian wiU 
 have no objection. Do you think he can, madam ? " 
 
 " Indeed I do not know. I am acquainted with the parties 
 only by hearsay. Report speaks highly of M. Pascal. Some 
 persons at Paris, and some formerly in ofiBce here, are surprised 
 at his unqualified adherence to the Ouverture system; but I 
 never heard anything worse of him than that." 
 
 " And that is nothing but good, as any one would say who 
 really knew all those dear people. L'Ouverture and M. Pascal 
 are almost like father and son. Afra says " 
 
 "My dear," interposed the abbess, "you wondered how I 
 knew of this affair. You must allow me to wonder how you 
 have gained all this intelligence. Mademoiselle Raymond must 
 have crossed her letters with sympathetic inks, which the warmth 
 of your friendship brought out ; for not a syllable of what you 
 have told me have her letters conveyed to me." 
 
 The abbess did not mean to press for au answer ; so iudulgent 
 was she made by the complacency of discovering that her charge 
 was not entangled in a love affair. While Euphrosyue was 
 blushing, and hunting for a reply which should be true and yet 
 guarded, she was relieved by the rapid approach of sister 
 Benoite. 
 
 " Something is amiss,' said the abbess, assuming the look of 
 calmness with which she was wont to await bad news. " What 
 has happened to alarm you, my daughter? " 
 
 " There is a message, reverend mother," said the breathless 
 nun, " from Madame Oge. She invites herself to our evening i-e- 
 past. If you cannot receive her to-day, she will come to-morrow." 
 
 " She shall be welcome," said the abbess ; without, however, 
 much of the spirit of welcome in her tone. 
 
 "So this is our calamity! " said Euphrosyue, laughing. 
 


## p. (#240) ################################################

236 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " There is calamity at hand, assuredly," sighed sister Benoite. 
 
 " Nay, nay, my daughter. This is superstition," said the 
 abbess. 
 
 " Whatever it be, reverend mother, do we not all, does not 
 every one quake when Madame Oge comes abroad ? " 
 
 " It is but seldom that she does," said the abbess, " and it is 
 our part to make her welcome." 
 
 " But seldom, indeed, reverend mother. When all goes well 
 — ^when the crops are fine, and the island all at peace, no one 
 hears of Madame Oge. She keeps within her coffee-groves " 
 
 " Mourning her sons," interposed the abbess. 
 
 " But," continued the nun, '• when any disaster is about to 
 happen, we have notice of it by Madame Oge coming abroad. 
 She came to this very house the first day of the meeting of the 
 deputies, in that terrible August of ninety-one. She came a day 
 or two before the rising against Hedouville. She came the night 
 before the great hurricane of ninety-seven " 
 
 " That was an accident," said the abbess, smiling. 
 
 " Then you think it is not by accident that she always comes 
 out before misfortunes happen ? " asked Euphrosyne, trembling 
 as she spoke. 
 
 " By no means, my dear. It is easily explained. Madame 
 Oge looks upon her sons as martyrs in the cause of the mulattoes. 
 When aU. goes well, as all has done, under L'Ouverture's rule, 
 with only a few occasional troubles — fewer and slighter than 
 might have been expected during such a change in society as 
 we have witnessed — when all goes well, Madame Oge feels that 
 her sons are forgotten ; and, as my daughter Benoite says, she 
 mourns them alone in the shades of her coffee-groves. She 
 seems, however, to have means of information which persons 
 less interested have not: and when she has reason to believe 
 that troubles will ensue, she hopes that the names of her sons 
 will once more be a watchword, for the humiliation of both 
 blacks and whites; and she comes forth with her hungry 
 maternal heart, and her quick maternal ear, to catch the first 
 echo of the names which are for ever mingled with her prayers." 
 
 " Can she mingle those names with her prayers, and yet not 
 forgive ? " 
 
 " My chUd, is it not so with us all ? Do we not pray for our 
 enemies, and ask to be forgiven as we forgive, and come out 
 from our closets with ears open to the fresh slanders of the day, 
 and hearts ready to burn at the thought of old injuries ? It 
 might be well for us, if we had the excuse of this wretched 
 woman, whose woes have been such as might naturally have 
 shaken her reason, and prostrated her will. If there be any 
 above others with whom God will be long suffering, it is with 
 the mother whose children have been torn from her arms to be

GUESTS AT THE CONVENT. 237 
 
 tortm-od and destroyed, and their very names made a term of 
 reproacli." 
 
 " Tou think something is going to happen P " 
 
 " As my daughter Benolte says, on one occasion there was a 
 hurricane. To-morrow the sun may rise, or there may be a 
 cloud in the sky." 
 
 " Nay, but— — " said sister Benolte. 
 _ " Nay, but," said the abbess, smiling, " I wiU have nothing 
 said which shall make Euphrosyne look upon my guest as a 
 sorceress, or as the instrument 01 any evil one. I wish all my 
 daughters to meet Madame Oge with cheerfulness. It is the 
 best I have to offer her, — the cheerfulness of my family ; and 
 that of which she has least at home. You hear, Euphrosyne ? " 
 
 " Madam, you do not mean that I am to see her. Indeed I 
 cannot, — ^indeed I dare not. It is no disrespect — quite the con- 
 trary. But I could not hold up my head before one who " 
 
 " Poor Madame Oge, if all said so ! " exclaimed the abbess. 
 
 " That is true," said Euphrosyne. " I will be there : but, 
 dear mother, do not speak particularly to me. Do not draw her 
 attention upon me." 
 
 " I will not, my dear." 
 
 " Do you think she wiU speak angrUy of the Ouvertures P I 
 hope she will say nothing about poor General Moyse." 
 
 " Tou must bear what she says, be it what it may." 
 
 " True. And it is only for one evening. But I wish it was 
 over. I shall be glad when to-morrow morning is come, and I 
 shall be in this alley again." 
 
 " Meantime, my dear, you have been long enough here for 
 this morning. Let us go in." 
 
 The prospect of any guest was in itself acceptable to the sister- 
 hood. It gave them something to do, and afforded one day of 
 variety. The abbess's parlour and the refectory had to be 
 adorned with fresh flowers. Napkins, of the workmanship of 
 one sister, were laid beside the plates ; and on the table were 
 fruits gathered by another, sweetmeats made by a third, and 
 chocolate prepared by the careful hands of a fourth. Even the 
 abbess's veil looked whiter, and more exactly put on than usual. 
 Everything within the walls was in its nicest order some time 
 before Madame Oge's carriage drew up before the gate. 
 
 Two or three of the sisters and Euphrosyne were with the 
 abbess in her parlour, when Madame Oge entered. Euphrosyne 
 had permission to bring in her work ; so that she could sit plying 
 her needle, and listening to what went on, without many 
 nervous feelings about being observed by a person whom she 
 could become acquainted with only by stealing glances at her 
 face. 
 
 That face, she thought, must in its youth have had much of

238 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 the beauty common among mulattoes, if not natural to them, in 
 a favourable climate. It was now deeply impressed with 
 so'rrow. Every line, every feature, told of sorrow. There 
 was no other painf-il expression in it. There was great solemnity, 
 but stillness rather than passion — nothing which warranted, 
 in itself, the superstitious fears which the sisters had of the 
 unhappy lady. She was handsomely dressed, and her manner 
 was quiet. 
 
 The conversation turned first upon the state of the cofEee and 
 sugar crops, about v/hich little could be said, because the 
 prospect of every kind of produce was excellent. So much 
 regard was everywhere paid to the processes of cultivation ; and 
 the practice of ten years, under the vigilant eye of Toussaiiit and 
 his agents, had so improved the methods of tillage and the habits 
 of the cultivators, that the bounties of the soil and climate were 
 improved instead of being intercepted. Every year, since the 
 revolution, the harvests had been richer ; and this was the 
 crowning year. 
 
 " Tea," said Madame Oge : " we have heard a great deal of 
 all that ; and I fancy we have nearly heard the last of it." 
 
 " There mu«t, indeed," replied the abbess, " be some limit to 
 the fruitfulness of the soil, and to the industry of those who 
 till it : and it does seem a.s if the earth could yield no more than 
 it is bringing forth this year." 
 
 " father Gabriel says," observed sister Claire, " that in his 
 journeys he could almost believe that the fields sing, and the 
 hills rejoice with music, as the Scripture says — the cultivators 
 are so hidden among the com and the canes, and the groves and 
 the vines, that their songs really seem to come out of the 
 ground." 
 
 " It is in the woods," added sister Benoite, " as if the very 
 trees shouted " 
 
 She stopped abruptly before the name L'Onverture, remem- 
 bering that it won'.d not be acceptable to all the present 
 company. 
 
 " I have no doubt," said Madame Oge, " that all the monkeys 
 and parrots iire taught to shout L'Ouverture. Like his people, 
 they are quick at learning that much. But I imagine there will 
 be something else for Toussaint to do presently, than teaching 
 the birds of the woods to praise him." 
 
 As no one asked what was likely to happen, she reserved for 
 the present the news they trembled to hear ; and went on, — 
 
 " It is grievous to see so good a negro as Toussaint lost and 
 spoiled. I knew him of old, when he was at Breda : and many 
 a time has M. Bayou told me that he was the most faithful, 
 decent, clever, well-mannered negro on the estate." 
 
 " I believe he preserves those qualities still," observed the

 abbess, reproving with a glance the laugh which was rising at 
 this description of the Commander-in-chief. 
 
 "If those had been masters who ought to have been masters," 
 pursued Madame Og6, " Toussaint would, no doubt, have been 
 placed at the head of the negroes : for we knew him well — 1 
 and they whom I have lost. Then, without insubordination, — 
 without any being lifted out of their proper places, to put down 
 others — we should have had a vast improvement in the negroes. 
 Toussaint would have been made their model, and perhaps would 
 have been rewarded with his freedom, some day or other, for an 
 example. This would have satisfied all the ambition he had by 
 nature. He would have died a free man, and perhaps have 
 emancipated his family. As it is, they wiU all die slaves : and 
 they will feel it all the harder for the farce of greatness they 
 have been playing these ten years. 1 am very sorry for them : 
 and I always was ; for I foresaw from the beginning how it 
 would end." 
 
 " Do you really imagine that any one thinks of enslaving this 
 wonderful man again p And what should make him submit to it p " 
 
 " He woidd sooner lay a train to the root of Oibao, and blow 
 up the island," exclaimed Euphrosyne. 
 
 " Ai'e you one of his party, young lady ? You look too 
 much as if yoii were but just landed from France for me to 
 sxippose that I was speaking before a friend of L'Ouverture's. 
 If yon really are lately from France, you may know that there 
 is a greater than our poor Toussaint, to whom he must yield at 
 command." 
 
 " I have never been at Paris, madame ; and I do not believe 
 that there is a greater than L'Ouverfcure, there, or anywhere 
 else." 
 
 " Ton have been a happy child, I see : yon have lived so retired 
 from our miserable world as not to have heard of Bonaparte. It 
 was by Bonaparte, my dear, for Bonaparte's convenience, and (it 
 is my idea) for his amusement, that Toussaint was made what he 
 is, and allowed to gallop about with his trumpeters behind him, 
 for so long. Ton look as if you did not believe me, my dear. 
 Well : time will show." 
 
 " I thought," said Euphrosyne, " that Toussaint was the First 
 of the Blacks before Bonaparte was the First of the Whites. I 
 have no doubt, however, that it has been very convenient to 
 Bonaparte, and very sui-prising to him and everybody, that the 
 colony has been so perfectly well governed by one from whom 
 they coiild have expected nothing. I hope Bonaparte will be 
 too wise and too grateftil to injure him, or even to hurt his feel- 
 ings ; and I feel very sure that Bonaparte is not strong enough, 
 with all the world to help him, to make L'Ouverture and his 
 famUy slaves again."

240 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " We shall see. ETen I may live to see it ; and I have no 
 doubt you will. Bonaparte is going to try ; and, if he cannot, 
 as you say, do it by himself, he may now persuade all the world 
 to help him : for he is making peace on all hands." 
 
 " Ton have that news from France ? " inquired the abbess. 
 
 " I have it from a sure quarter — never mind how. It will 
 soon be generally known that the preliminaries of peace between 
 France and England are signed : and I happen to know two 
 things more : that Bonaparte has agreed to maintain negro 
 slavery in Martinique, Guadaloupe, and Cayenne : and that — 
 (pray listen, young lady) — he declares to the English that he 
 can do what he pleases in St. Domingo. I wish he could see that 
 angry blush. Pray look at her, Madame ! I see she thinks 
 Bonaparte a very impertinent fellow." 
 
 "I do," replied Buphrosyne; ''and I hope he will know 
 better, and feel better, before he is L'Ouverture's age." 
 
 " Ha ! he ought to know what disloyal little hearts there 
 are beating against him in this St. Domingo that he thinks all 
 his own." 
 
 " Perhaps," observed the abbess, " he used these words when 
 he was not speaking of slavery ; but rather from being aware 
 of the loyalty .of the Ouvertiire famUy ; which is, I believe, 
 exemplary." 
 
 '' It is," declared Enphrosyne, looking up with glowing eyes. 
 " He has not only served, but worshipped Bonaparte, all the 
 years that they have both ruled. In his own family, M. Pascal 
 says — " 
 
 " What is M. Pascal to do under the changes that are coming ? " 
 interrupted Madame Oge. " He has placed himself in a diffi- 
 culty, it seems to me. Will he go under the yoke with his 
 father-in-law ? (for I suppose, in his devotion, he will be marrying 
 one of Tottssaint's daughters). Will he take the hoe, and go 
 into the field ? Tou are smiling, my dear young lady." 
 
 Enphrosyne was indeed smiling. She could not but hope 
 that, as Madame Oge was so ill-informed about the affairs of M. 
 Pascal, and of the Raymonds, who were of her own colour, she 
 might be mistaken about the whole of her news. 
 
 "Tou are smiling," repeated Madame Oge. "Though you 
 stoop your head over your work, I see that you have some droll 
 thought." 
 
 " It would be strange, certainly," replied Enphrosyne, "to see 
 the philosophical M. Pascal hoeing canes, or working at the mill. 
 Tet I believe we may be certain that he will be a slave as soon 
 as Toussaint, or any negro in St. Domingo," 
 
 " Young people like to be positive," said Madame Oge to the 
 abbess. _ "But it does not mueh matter, as they have life before 
 them ; time enough to see what is true, and what is not. Is it

A HELL ON BART If. 24 1 
 
 your doctrine, my dear young lady, that God has given over His 
 wrath towards this island ; and that it is to be happy hence- 
 forth, with the negroes for masters P " 
 
 " With the negroes for equals, I think it may be happy. But 
 I never thought of God being wrathful towards us. I thought 
 our miseries had arisen out of men's wrath with each other." 
 
 " If ever," said Madame Oge, in a low tone, but yet so that 
 every word was heard — " if ever there was a place set apart by 
 cursing — if ever there was a hell upon this earth, it is this 
 island. Men can tell us where paradise was — it was not here, 
 whatever Columbus might say. The real paradise where the 
 angels of God kept watch, and let no evil thing enter, was on 
 the other side of the globe : and I say that this place was meant 
 for a hell, as that was for a heaven, upon earth. It looked like 
 heaven to those who first came : but that was the devil's snare. 
 It was to make lust sweeter, and cruelty safer, that he adorned 
 the place as he did. In a little while, it appeared like what it 
 was. The innocent natives were corrupted ; the defenceless 
 were killed ; the strong were made slaves. The plains were laid 
 waste, and the valleys and woods were rifled. The very bees 
 ceased to store their honey : and among the wild game there was 
 found no young. Then came the sea-robbers, and haunted the 
 shores : and many a dying wretch screamed at night among the 
 caverns — many a murdered corpse lies buried in our sands. 
 Then the negroes were brought in from over the sea ; and from 
 among their chains, from under the lash, grew up the hatred 
 of races. The whites hated the mulattoes, and despised the 
 blacks. The mulattoes hated both the whites and the blacks ; 
 and " 
 
 "And," interposed Enphrosyne, courageously, "the blacks 
 hated neither. They loved where they could; and where they 
 could not love, they forgave ; and there lies the proof that this 
 island is not hell." 
 
 " Ton have proved nothing, my dear, but that yon do not 
 know what has happened, even since you were born. Any 
 white will tell you what the negroes did, so late as the year 
 ninety-one — how they killed their masters by inches — how 
 they murdered infants — how they carried off ladies into the 
 woods " 
 
 A sign from the abbess availed to stop Madame Oge, even in 
 the midst of a subject on which none usually dared to interrupt 
 her. Enphrosyne, in some agitation, replied, 
 
 " I am aware of all that you say : but every one allows 
 that the most ignorant and cruel of the negroes did over again 
 exactly what they had seen the whites do to their race. But 
 these revengef nl blacks were few, very few, in comparison with 
 the numbers who spared their masters, helped and comforted

 them, and are now working on their estates — ^friends with all 
 who will be friends with them. The place is not hell where 
 thousands of men forget the insults of a life-time, and bind up 
 the wounds of their oppressors." 
 
 " I cannot doubt," said the abbess, " that ever since there 
 was a Christian in the island, there have been angels of God at 
 hand, to sanctify the evil which they were not commissioned to 
 prevent. Violence is open to the day. Patience is hidden in 
 the heart. Revenge has shouted his battle-cry at noon, while 
 Forgiveness breathes her lowly prayer at midnight. Spirits 
 from hell may have raged along our high roads ; but I trust that 
 in the fiercest times, the very temper of Christ may have dwelt 
 in a thousand homes, in a thousand nooks of our valleys and our 
 woods." 
 
 "Besides," sister Benolte ventured to say, "our worst 
 troubles were so long ago ! For ten years now we have been under 
 the holy rule of a devout man ; and, for the most part, at peace." 
 
 " Peace ! " exclaimed Madame Oge, contemptuously. 
 
 "There have been disputes among the rulers, as Father 
 Gabriel says there are among all the rulers in the world ; but he 
 says (and no one knows better than Father Gabriel) that the body 
 of the people have not been troubled by these disputes, and are 
 not even aware of them." 
 
 " Does not Father Gabriel tell you that ten years are but a 
 day in heaven and heU ? Tes, in hell — ^ihey may be long for suf- 
 fering ; but they are short for revenge. The cruel master, who 
 saw one slave faint under the lash, and let another die in the 
 stocks, and tore the husband from the wife, and the child from 
 the mother, might escape for the time with the destruction of 
 his family, punished for his sake : — ^he might live safely in the 
 midst of the city, for the ten years you speak of ; but, let him 
 venture out for a single day — ^let him but drive to his own estate 
 and back again, and, grey as his head is, he is shot in his own 
 carriage, as soon as it is dark." 
 
 Before the abbess could anticipate what was coming, the words 
 were out. Before she could make a sign, Euphrosyne had rushed 
 from the room. 
 
 It was not long before the abbess entered the chamber of her

 shuddering with horror.

 the departed may have the benefit of your prayers. But how 
 differently would I have had you told ! " 
 
 " Never mind that ! Whatever is true, I can and wiU. bear. 
 I will pray for him, madam, day and night — as long as I live 
 
 will I pray for him: for he was to me Oh, madam, how he 
 
 loved me ! I will make reparation for him ; the reparation 
 that he would make if he could. I will find out who were the 
 
 poor creatures 1 will make them happy for as long as they 
 
 live, for his sake. Tou will help me, madam ? " 
 
 " I will. It is a pious intention." 
 
 " I owe him all that I can do. I ask one favour of you, madam. 
 Let no one speak to me about him — never again. No one can 
 understand what he was to me — ^what care he took of me — how 
 he used to love me. Oh, madam, is it quite certain — are you 
 quite sure that those things are true ? " 
 
 " My child, do not give me the pain of explaining more. As 
 you say, let this never again be spoken of.^I propose to you, 
 Euphrosyne, to make a virtuous effort." 
 
 " Not to come down this evening, madam p " 
 
 " Tes, my child, to come down this evening. I think it of 
 importance that Madame Og^ should not discover how she has 
 wounded you, and that nothing should occur to fix her attention 
 on the descendant of one who was active in procuring the death 
 of her sons. Trust me, my dear, it is worth an effort to prevent 
 Madame Oge leaving this house your enemy." 
 
 " I do not care for it, madam. Let her hate me. She is quite 
 welcome." 
 
 "Tou are thinking only of yourself, Euphrosyne. I am 
 thinking also of her. Consider how sore a heart she carries 
 within her. Consider how wretched her life has been made by 
 the enmities in which she has lived. Will you not save her one 
 more ? Tou have professed to pity her. Now you can show if 
 your pity is real, by saving her from a new enmity." 
 
 " I am willing to do that : but how can I speak, to her ? How 
 can we know what things she may say ? " 
 
 " Tou shall not converse with her again. The table is spread. 
 Go down now, and take your place at the foot, beside sister 
 Claire. When we rise from table, I will dismiss you to your 
 room as in course." 
 
 "I wish that time was come," sighed Euphrosyne, as she 
 languidly arranged her hair. 
 
 The abbess stroked her pale cheek, as she said that in an hour 
 she would be glad the effort was made. 
 
 " Tou can spend the evening in writing to your friend," said 
 she ; " and if you think proper to tell her that I know her secret, 
 you may assure her of my blessing and my prayers. They are 
 due to one who loves my dear charge as she does."

 Euphrosyne's cheeks were now no longer pale. 
 
 " And may I tell her, madam, what Madame Oge has heen 
 declaring about Bonaparte and his threats p " 
 
 " It -^vill be needless, my dear. If there be any truth in the 
 matter, M. Pascal, doubtless, knows more than Madame Og4" 
 
 " In that case there can be no harm in mentioning it." 
 
 Still the abbess thought it would be safer to say nothing about 
 it ; and Euphrosyne gave up the point for to-night, remembering 
 that she could perhaps send a private despatch afterwards by the 
 hands of Pierre. 
 
 During the meal, while the length of the table was between 
 them, Euphrosyne nearly escaped the notice of Madame Oge. 
 When it was over, and the sisters rose, while the guest and the 
 abbess passed out to the parlour, the abbess stopped at Euphro- 
 syne, kissed her forehead, and commended her to her studies. 
 Madame Oge stopped too, and put in an intercession that the 
 young lady might be excused studying this evening, and per- 
 mitted to return to her pretty fancy-work in the parlour. The 
 colour rushed to Euphrosyne's temples — a sign of ardent hope of 
 a holiday in Madame Oge's eyes. She therefore thought the 
 abbess grievously strict when she replied that her charge would 
 prefer spending the evening in her own chamber. 
 
 " As you please," said Madame Og6. " It was my wish to do 
 the child a kindness ; and perhaps to have the pleasure myself of 
 seeing a young face for an hour or two — ^the rarest of all sights 
 to me. I seldom go out ; and when I do, all the young and 
 cheerful faces seem to have hidden themselves." 
 
 The abbess regulated her invitations for the evening by this 
 speech. Sisters Debora and Marie, one the youngest, and the 
 other the merriest of the family, were requested to bring their 
 work-bags, and join the party in the parlour. 
 
 " Good evening, young lady," said Madame Oge to Euphrosyne, 
 holding out her hand. " I hoped to have procured you a little 
 freedom, and to have had more conversation about your hero ; 
 but " 
 
 " If there are to be great changes in the colony," observed the 
 abbess — " it may yet be in your power, madam, to show kindness 
 to my charge." 
 
 " If so, command me, my dear. But it is more likely that the 
 changes to come will have the opposite effect. Then pretty 
 young white ladies may have all their own way ; while the storm 
 will burst again on the heads of the dark people." 
 
 " If so, command me, madam," Euphrosyne exerted herself to 
 say. The abbess's smile made her eyes fill with tears, almost 
 before ste had spoken. 
 
 " Are your eyes wet for me, my dear P " said Madame Og^, 
 with surprise. " Let the storm burst upon me ; for I am shat-

 tered and stricken already, and nothing can hurt me. But I shall 
 remember your offer. Meantime, you may depend upon it, 
 the news I told you is true — the times I warned you of are 
 coming." 
 
 " What news ? what warning ? " eagerly asked the sisters of 
 Euphrosyne, as soou as the guest was out of hearing. 
 
 " That there were hurricanes last November, and there wiU be 
 more the next,'' replied she, escaping to her chamber. Before 
 she slept, she had written all her news and all her thoughts to 
 Afra, leaving it for decision in the morning, whether she should 
 seud entire what she had written. 
 
 CHAPTER XXVI. 
 
 THE HBKALD ABKOAD. 
 
 Madame Oge's news was too true. M. Pascal had held many 
 an anxious conversation with L'Ouverture on the subject, before 
 Afra showed him her little friend's letter. In a short time an 
 additional fact became known — that Bonaparte had re-esta- 
 blished the slave trade. His enmity to the race of blacks was 
 now open and declared. 
 
 The first intimation which the colony at large had of what had 
 happened, was through the altered demeanour of their chief. From 
 the first bright day of the prolific, gorgeous summer, to that in 
 which the season merged in a fierce autumnal storm, L'Ouverture 
 had been seen to be not less calm and quiet than usual, but 
 depressed and sad. Some ascribed his gloom to the traui action 
 at Cap, and the misery it must needs have introduced into his 
 home. Others, who saw how much the colony had gained in 
 confidence, and Toussaint's government in strength by that act, 
 looked for a different cause. Some reminded each other that, 
 while no man was more energetic in the hour of proof than their 
 chief, his spirits were wont to droop when others were elated. 
 It seemed as if some boding ghost whispered evil to him most 
 peremptorily when the harvests were ripest before his eyes, when 
 the laugh and the song were loudest in his ear, and when no one 
 dreamed that the bright days of the colony would ever more be 
 overclouded. 
 
 It was even so. Wben Toussaint saw that his race was in 
 peace, it filled him with grief that this peace was not likely to 
 last. When he saw what the true African soul was, when cleansed 
 from blood and anger, and permitted to grow in freedom and in 
 harmony, it was torture to know (as he did too well) that new

246 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 injuries were preparing for it — that it was certain to be again 
 steeped in passion and slaughter, and all that was savage in it 
 excited afresh. This, even more than the death of Moyse, cast 
 gloom roraid his soul, during the last of the series of bright and 
 prosperous summers that were to pass under his eye. When 
 autumn came, it might have made him wonder, if he had had 
 leisure to consider himself, to find how his spirits rose, and his 
 heart grew light, exactly wheu dismay and dread began to over- 
 cloud every face about him, but when he saw that suspense and 
 struggle were coming to an end. He perceived perplexity in the 
 countenance of his friend Pascal, even in the presence of his 
 bride. He met sorrow in the mild eyes of Henri ; he heard that 
 exultation in the voice of Jacques which always struck like 
 discord upon his ear. He observed that in the bearing of Madame 
 Dessaliues which carried back his memqry ten years into her past 
 history. He saw Aimee tremble at the approach of any one who 
 might bring news from France ; and he heard Margot weeping 
 at her prayers, as she implored of Heaven the safe return of her 
 sons. Tet all this caused to his sympathising heart scarcely a 
 pang ; so clear was his path now, so distinct was the issue to 
 which his duty, and the fate of his race was brought. 
 
 " Here it ends then," said he, one day at the council-table, 
 rising as he spoke. " Here ends all possibility of compromise. 
 For Me blacks, it is slavery or self-defence. It is so, M. Pascal." 
 
 " It is. The terms of the new peace are proclaimed." 
 
 " And the fact substantiated that Bonaparte has declared that 
 he will do what he pleases with St. Domingo." 
 
 " Such were certainly his words." 
 
 " Who is surprised ? " inquired DessaUnes. " I forewarned 
 you of this, long ago : and I said, at the same time, that, if we 
 waited for aggression, we might find it too late for defence.'' 
 
 " Not a word of fear, Jacques. Our victory is as sure as the 
 justice of Heaven." 
 
 " Perhaps so ; but it would have been easier if yon had not 
 been training your people, aU these years, to love and cherish 
 those whom they are now going to resist." 
 
 "I see and admit our difficulty, Jacques. But if I had 
 governed as you would have had me, we should have been in a 
 worse. I should then have been the chief of a race of savages, 
 instead of soldiers and citizens. If we had been extirpating 
 the whites all this time, we should now have been destroying 
 each other, instead of preparing to go forth to a righteous war. 
 
 "True. Most true," declared Henri. " We may sufEer f or a 
 time, and fight with the more difficulty, from our habits of 
 observance towards those whom we must now oppose ; but God 
 will not allow the spirit of forgiveness and love to be finally a 
 snare."

PREPARING FOR WAR. 247 
 
 " Never," said Toussaint. " He has appointed fierce passions 
 foi- a yoke, and mild affections for freedom. Tliougli Bonaparte 
 betrays and oppresses, the Gospel stands. — It is now time for 
 proclaiming the war throughout the colony." 
 
 " I will prepare the proclamation this night," said M. Pascal. 
 
 " If you will, my friend," said Toussaint. " But I intend to 
 be my own proclamation. To-morrow morning I set forth for 
 St. Domingo, to visit my brother in his city. I shall examine 
 every fort, and call together the militia, as I go. The trip 
 would be more effective if I could have my council about me." 
 
 " I will go with you," said Henri. 
 
 " And I," exclaimed Jacques. 
 
 "And I ? " said Raymond, inquiringly. 
 
 " No, Rajrmond ; stay at Port-au-Prince, to report my pro- 
 ceedings to the legislature. And you, M. Pascal, remain here 
 to receive the despatches which may arrive from Prance. My 
 brethren-in-arms of the council will be with me. When we 
 have satisfied ourselves, we wiU let you know whether or not 
 those who would have loved and served Prance for ever as a 
 guardian angel, can cast her off when she becomes an incubus." 
 
 It was a time of high excitement — that in which L'Ouverture, 
 attended by four of his generals, and a train of inferior officers, 
 traversed the island, to communicate or confirm the intelligence 
 that an expedition was believed to be setting sail from France, 
 for the purpose of wresting from the blacks the freedom which 
 was theirs by the law of the land. Toussaint found, not only 
 that all hearts were ready for the assertion of freedom, but 
 that all eyes were so fixed upon him, ail ears so open to his 
 lightest word, that there was every probability of his purposes 
 being fully understood and completely executed. At a word 
 from him, the inhabitants of Cap Prau9aise and Port-au-Prince 
 began to remove their property into the fastnesses of the interior, 
 and to prepare to burn those towns at the momeint of the French 
 attempting to land. It was useless to think of preventing a 
 landing, so exposed was the greater part of the coast. The more 
 rational hope was so to distress the foe on shore as to make them 
 glad to go on board their ships again. Equally satisfactory was 
 the disposition of the interior. The municipal bodies through- 
 out the colony, previously brought under one system, now acted 
 in concert. Their means of communication had been improved, 
 so that each settlement was no longer like an encampment in 
 the wilderness : on the contrary, every order given by L'Ouver- 
 ture seemed to have been echoed by the mountain-tops around, 
 so promptly was it transmitted, and so continually did he find 
 his commands anticipated. As he went, his four generals 
 parted off, to examine the forts on either hand, and to inspect 
 and animate the militia. Everywhere the same story was told.

248 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 and everywhere was it received with the same eagerness and 
 docility. " The French are coming to make slaves of us again ; 
 but there shall never more be a slave in St. Domingo. They 
 are coming ; but they are our countrymen till they have struck 
 the first blow. "We will demand of them an account of our 
 brethren in Cayenne, in Guadaloupe, and in Martinique. We 
 will ask of them concerning our brethren on the coasts of Africa. 
 If, in return, they throw us chains and the whip, we shall know 
 how to answer. But not a blow must be struck tiU they have 
 shovra whether they are brethren or foes. Our dark skin is no 
 disgrace ; but the first drop of a brother's blood dyes us all in 
 infamy. Let the infamy be theirs who assault us. At this 
 moment our first duty is to our white brethren of this island ; 
 in this time of our high excitement, they are full of grief ;_ they 
 are guiltless of this attack upon our liberty ; they are as wUling 
 as we to live and die raider the rule of L'Ouverture : and under 
 the special protection of L'Ouverture, they shall, if they please, 
 live and die. Beware of imputing to them the sins of their 
 colour ; protect them from your heaxts — defend them with your 
 lives. In the hour of danger, as you invoke the blessing of 
 Heaven, save first the Creole whites, and next your wives and 
 your children." 
 
 Such were the exhortations spoken everywhere by Ghristophe, 
 La Plume, and Olerveaux. It could not be expected of Dessa- 
 lines that he should deliver the last clauses with perfect fidelity. 
 The solemnity of the hour had, however its tranquillising efEect, 
 even upon his ruling passion. Even his heart, which usually 
 turned to stone at the sight of a white, was moved by the visible 
 distress of the proprietors of that race, who were, with scarcely 
 «in exception, in despair. In private, they execrated the spirit 
 and conduct of their former neighbours, now in Paris, whose re- 
 presentations were the chief cause of the expedition now pro- 
 jected. Instead of remaining or returning, to ascertain the real 
 state of things in St. Domingo — instead of respecting the inte- 
 rests and wishes of those who were entirely satisfied under the 
 government of L'Ouverture, they had prejudiced the mind of 
 the Pirst Consul, and induced him to bring back the ruin and 
 woe which had passed away. The ladies wept and trembled 
 within their houses; their fathers, husbands, and brothers 
 fiocked to every point where L'Ouverture halted, to assure him 
 of their good-will to his government, and to remind him of the 
 difficulty and danger of the position in which they were placed. 
 These last carried some comfort home with them. All who had 
 seen Toussaiut's face had met there the gaze of a brother. 
 If there were two or three who went with doubtful minds, 
 prepared to exult at the depression of the blacks, but thinking 
 it well to bespeak protection, in case of the struggle ending

PUBLIC SYMPATHY. 249 
 
 tho wrong way — if there was a sprinkling of such among the 
 throng of whites who joined the cavalcade from the cross-roads, 
 they shrunk away abashed before the open countenance of 
 the Deliverer, and stole homewards to wait the guidance of 
 events. 
 
 If it had not been that the city of St. Domingo was at the end 
 of this march, Toussaint would have traversed the colony with 
 a higher spirit and a lighter heart than during any of his 
 sereuer days of power ; but the city of his brother's government 
 was before him, and, at its gate, Paul, whom he had not met 
 since the death of Moyse. He had not been forgetful of his 
 sorrowing brother; he had immediately sent to him Father 
 Laxabon — the best consoler, as the last confidant of the departed. 
 Letter upon letter had. Toussaint sent— deed upon deed of kind- 
 ness had he attempted towards his brother; but stiU Father 
 Laxabon had written, " Come not yet ; '' " He must have time ; " 
 " Give him time if there is to be peace between you." Now it 
 had become necessary that they should meet ; and far readier 
 was Toussaint to encounter the armies of France than the 
 countenance of his brother. For ever, in the midst of the 
 excitements of the journey, he found himself asking in his own 
 mind where and how Paul would meet him ; and whether he 
 had cut off from himself his brother, as well as his brother's son. 
 
 Meantime, the party rode proudly on, through the interior of 
 the island, signs of welcome spreading aroimd them at every 
 step. From the grass-farms, in the wide savannahs, the herds- 
 men hastened, with promises to drive their flocks up into the 
 mornes, where no enemy should penetrate while a man remained 
 to guard the passes. At each salute from the forts that rose at 
 intervals along the way, the wild cattle rushed towai-ds the 
 steeps ; while the parties of hunters turned back from their 
 sports, to offer themselves as scouts and messengers on behalf of 
 the colony. From some glade of the woods appeared the monk, 
 charged with the blessing of his convent ; or the grazier, with 
 a string of horses — ^his ^t, for the service of the army. Around 
 the crosses which, half concealed by the long grass of the plains, 
 yet served to mark the road, were gathered groups of women, 
 bearing bags of money, or ornaments of gold and silver, which 
 they would have thrust upon him, to whom they declared that 
 they owed their all ; while every settlement displayed its com- 
 pany of armed men, standing in military order, and rending the 
 air with shouts, on the approach of their chief. La Plume and 
 Clerveaux, to whom such demonstrations were less familiar than 
 to the other generals, no longer doubted that all would be well. 
 They pronounced that the colony already showed itself invin- 
 cible. Toussaint thought that he might have been of the same 
 opinion, if the expected foe had been any other than French. 
 


## p. (#254) ################################################

250 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 The event must show whether the pains he had taken to unite 
 his race with their fellow-citizens as brethren would now weaken 
 or strengthen his cause — whether it would enhance or mitigate 
 the bitterness of the impending quarrel. 
 
 On the morning of the last day of their survey of the interior, 
 the party emerged from the shade of the woods, and, crossing 
 the grassy levels of the Llanos, reached the ferry by which the 
 Ozama was to be crossed near its mouth. On the opposite bank 
 were horsemen, who, on observing the party approaching the 
 ferry, put spurs to their horses, and galloped southwai'ds, in 
 the direction of the city. They need not so have hastened ; for 
 the Deliverer was stopped at every fishing hamlet — almost at 
 every hut along the snores of the bay, to receive the loyal 
 homage of the inhabitants — Spanish as well as French. In the 
 midst of these greetings the eye and the soul of the chief were 
 absent — looking to what lay before him. There, at some dis- 
 tance, springing from the level of the plain, rose the cathedral 
 of St. Domingo, and other lofty buil^ngs, whose outline was 
 distinctly marked against the glittering sea which spread im- 
 mediately behind. An ungovernable impatience seized him at 
 length, and he broke away, bursting through the throngs upon 
 the road, and resolving not to stop tUl he should have seen his 
 fate, as a brother, in his brother's eyes. 
 
 A procession of priests was issuing from the city gates as he 
 approached. They were robed, and they bore the Host under a 
 canopy. At the first sound of their chant, the generals and 
 their suite threw themselves from their horses, and prostrated 
 themselves upon the grass. On rising, they perceived that the 
 whole city had come out to meet them. " The whole city," 
 Toussaint heard his companions say: and his heart throbbed 
 when he strained his sight to see if the Governor of the city was 
 the only one left at home. The procession of priests had now 
 turned, and was preceding him — slowly — so slowly, that he 
 would fain have dispensed with the solemnity. The people 
 crowded round his horse and impeded his way. He strove to 
 be present to the occasion ; but all was like a troubled dream — 
 the chanting, the acclamation, the bursts of military music from 
 a distance — all that at other times had fired his soul was now 
 disturbance and perplexity. A few faithless persons iu the crowd, 
 on the watch for information with which they might make in- 
 terest with the French on their arrival, noted the wandering of 
 the eye and the knitting of the brow, and drew thence a portent 
 of the fall of the Deliverer. 
 
 At length the gate was reached ; and there, in the shadow of 
 the portal, surrounded by his attendants, stood Paul. On the 
 arrival of Ms brother at the threshold, he took from an oflcerthe 
 velvet cushion on which the keys of the city were deposited, and

 advancing to the stirrup of the Oommander-in-ohief , offered them, 
 according to custom. Eor an instant, Toussaint gazed on the 
 aged, worn, melancholy countenance beside him, and then stooped 
 from his horse, to fling his arms round the neck of his brother, 
 breathing into his ear, 
 
 " If you are in your duty at such a time as this, who else dare 
 fail me ? I thank God! I thank God! We cannot fail." 
 
 Paul withdrew himself, without speaking. His action was 
 snllen. He led the way, however, towards the Gorernor's house, 
 evidently expecting to be followed. Not another word passed 
 between them on the way. Through one wide street after an- 
 other L'Ouverture was led ; and from the balconies of whole ranges 
 of fine houses, from the roof of many a church, and the porch of 
 many a convent, was he hailed, before he could catch another 
 glimpse of the countenance of the brother who preceded him. 
 At the gate of the Governor's house there was a pause ; and way 
 was made for the chief to pass in first. He did so ; and the next 
 moment turned round in the vestibule, to speak to Paul ; but 
 Paul had disappeared. Glancing round, Toussaint saw Father 
 Laxabon awaiting him at the foot of the staircase. Each advanced 
 to the other. 
 
 " Father, he is wretched," whispered Toussaint. " Bring me 
 to him." 
 
 " Follow me," said the priest ; and, instead of mounting the 
 marble staircase, L'Ouverture and the father were seen to enter 
 a passage, into which every one else was forbidden to follow. 
 Father Laxabon tapped softly at a door, and was desired to 
 enter. He opened it, and closed it behind Toussaint, keeping 
 watch outside, that the brothers might not be disturbed. 
 
 Paul started to his feet from the couch on which he had thrown 
 himself. He stood waiting. Now was the decisive moment; 
 and Toussaint knew it was. Tet he stood speechless. 
 
 " I left my son in your charge," said Paul, at length. 
 
 " Tou did : and I " 
 
 " And you murdered him.'^ 
 
 " No, Paul ! I executed justice upon him. Hear me, brother, 
 once for all. I am heart-broken for you as a brother : but as a 
 magistrate, I will admit no censure. As his father in your stead, 
 I was, as the event has proved, too ambitious for him : but, as a 
 ruler, I did but my duty." 
 
 " Tes ! Tou have been ambitious ! Tou have chosen your 
 duty ! " 
 
 '' My ambition was for him, Paul. As for my duty — remem- 
 ber that I have too a child whom, by that act, I doomed to worse 
 than death." 
 
 " Tou see what liberty has brought to us. Look at the family 
 of Ouverture — consider what has befallen since your struggle

 ior liberty began; and then, perhaps, you will give over 
 struggling. Welcome the French — go back to Breda — send 
 me home to my hut on the shore, that I may die in such peace 
 as is left to a chUdless man. Why do you not answer me, 
 Toussaint ? Why wiU you not give us a last chance of peace ? 
 I must obey you at the city gate ; but I will importune you here. 
 Why will you not do as I say ? " 
 
 " Because I know that some — ^and the Ouvertures among them 
 — were not bom to live at ease — to pass their days in peace. I 
 feel that some — and the Ouvertures among them — are bom to 
 sufEer — to struggle and to die for their race. If you would know 
 why, ask their Creator. I myself would fain know why. Mean- 
 time, the will of God is so clear, that I have devoted, not myself 
 only, but my children. My sons, you know " 
 
 " And not your children only, but your brother and his child." 
 
 " No. Moyse cast himself away. And, as for you, your hut 
 still stands, as you say. Go to it, u you will ; or make friends 
 with the French, if you desire to be a slave again. Tou have 
 sufEered too much by me for me to ask you ever to serve me 
 more. I shall never desire you to dedicate yoiu-seH anew to 
 pain, in this crisis. Go and seek for ease. I shall incessantly 
 pray that you may find it." 
 
 "I shall not seek what is not to be found, Toussaint. I have 
 never dared wretchedness as you have : but since I am and must 
 be wretched, I will be an Ouverture. Tour eye and your voice 
 make me an Ouverture again, even yet. Give me your com- 
 mands." 
 
 " Read this proclamation, with the eye of au Ouverture. 
 Well! Do you like it? How do you understand it?" 
 
 " You declare your aDegiance to France, declaring, at the 
 same time, its limits, and appealing to your soldiers, in the 
 event of aggression. It is plain from this that you mean to 
 defend yourself, and anticipate war." 
 
 " It is well. That is what I intend to convey. Tou will 
 publish this proclamation, in your city and district, under the 
 date of this 18th of December, 1801. Tou will then concert with 
 General Clerveaus the measures for the defence of this city, and 
 report your decisions to me, on my return fi-om Cap Samana. 
 Shall it be so, brother ? " 
 
 " Be it so." 
 
 " And we are friends ? " 
 
 " We are f ellow-citzens — we are Ouvertures — and therefore 
 faithful. I shall not betray you." 
 
 " That is all I can ask, I know. We are old men, Paul, 
 Fidelity for a while ! Beyond the grave, perhaps more." 
 
 " Tou are going already ? " 
 
 " To Cap Samana ; and alone. Farewell ! "

 CHAPTER XXVII, 
 
 ALL EYE. 
 
 Day by day, in the intervals of Ms occupation about the defence 
 of the colony, did Toussaint repair to Cap Samana, to look 
 eastwards over the sea. Day by day was he more sure, from 
 the information that reached him, that the French could not be 
 far off. At length, he desired that his generals should be 
 within call from Cotuy, a small town which stood on the banks 
 of the Cotuy, near the western base of the mountainous promon- 
 tory of Samana — promontory at low water, island at high 
 tide. 
 
 All was yet dark on the eastern point of this mountain, on the 
 morning of the 28th of December, when two watchmen, who had 
 passed the night under the ferns in a cleft of the steep, came out 
 to look abroad. On their mountain all was yet dark, for the 
 stars overhead, though still rolling clear and golden — visible orbs 
 in the empty depths of the sky — were so far dimmed by the 
 dawn in the east as no longer to send down their shafts of light 
 upon the earth. The point on which these watchmen stood was 
 so high, that between them and the horizon the sea lay like half 
 a world — an immeasurable expanse, spreading as if from a vast 
 depth below up into the very sky. Dim and soundless lay the 
 mass of waters — breaking, no doubt, as for ages past, against 
 the rocky precipice below ; but not so as to be heard upon the 
 steep. It might have appeared dead, but that a ray from some 
 quarter of the heaven, capriciously touching its surface, showed 
 that it was heaving as was its wont. Eastwards, at the point 
 of junction of sea and sky, a dusky yellow light shone through 
 the haze of morning, as behind a curtain, and told that the sun 
 was on his way. As their eyes became accustomed to the dim 
 light (which was darkness compared to that which had visited 
 their dreams among the ferns), the watchmen alternately swept 
 the expanse with their glass, and pronounced that there was not 
 a sail in sight. 
 
 " I believe, however, that this wUl be our day ; the wind is 
 fair for the fleet," said Toussaint to Henri. " Go and bathe 
 while I watch." 
 
 " We have said for a week past that each would be the day," 
 replied Henri. " If it be to-day, however, they can hardly 
 have a fairer for the first sight of the paradise which poets and 
 ladies praise at the French court. It promises to be the love- 
 liest day of the year. I shall be here again before the sun has 
 risen."

 itself heard from behind the ferns, and was hidden by them ; 
 springing, as they did, to a height of twenty feet and upwards. 
 To the murmur and gush of this waterfall the friends had slept. 
 An inhabitant of the tropics is so accustomed to sound, that he 
 cannot sleep in the midst of silence : and on these heights there 
 would have been everlasting silence but for the voice of waters, 
 and the thunders and their echoes in the season of storms. 
 
 When both had refreshed themselves, they took their seat on 
 some broken ground on the verge of the precipice, sometimes 
 indulging their full minds with silence, but continually looking 
 abroad over the now brightening sea. It was becoming of a 
 deeper blue as the sky grew lighter, except at that point of the 
 east where earth and heaven seemed to be kindling with a 
 mighty fire. There the haze was glowing with purple and crim- 
 son ; and there was Henri intently watching for the first golden 
 spark of the sun, when Toussaint touched his shoulder, and 
 pointed to the northwards. Shading his eyes with his hand, 
 Christophe strove to penetrate the grey mists which had gathered 
 there. 
 
 " What is it P " said he — " a sail ? Tes : there is one — three 
 — ^four ! " 
 
 " There are seven," said Toussaint. 
 
 Long did he gaze through the glass at these seven sail; and 
 then he reported an eighth. At this moment his arm was 
 grasped. 
 
 " See ! see ! " cried Christophe, who was looking southwards. 
 
 From behind the distant south-eastern promontory Del 
 Enganno, now appeared, sail after sail, to the number of 
 twenty. 
 
 " All French,'' observed Christophe. " Lend me the glass." 
 
 "AU French," replied his friend. "They are, no doubt, 
 coming to rendezvous at this point." 
 
 While Henri explored those which were nearest, Toussaint 
 leaned on his folded arms against the bank of broken ground 
 before him, straining his eyes over the now-peopled sea. 
 
 " More ! More ! " he exclaimed, as the sun appeared, and the 
 new gush of light showed sail upon sail, as small specks upon 
 the horizon line. He snatched the glass; and neither he nor 
 Henri spoke for long. 
 
 The east wind served the purposes of the vast fleet, whose 
 three detachments, once within each other's view, rapidly con- 
 verged, showing that it was indeed their object to rendezvous at 
 Cap Samana. Silent, swift, and most fair (as is the wont of evil) 
 was this form of destruction in its approach. 
 
 Not a word was spoken as the great ships-of-the-line bore 
 majestically up towards their point, while the lighter vessels 
 akimmed the sea, as in sport, and made haste in, as if racing

THE ENEMY. 255 
 
 with one another, or anxious to be in waiting, to welcome their 
 superiors. Nearer and nearer they closed in, till the waters 
 seemed to be covered with the foe. When Toussaint was assured 
 that he had seen them all — when he had again and again silently 
 counted over the fifty-four ships-of-war — he turned to his friend 
 with a countenance of anguish, such as even that friend of many 
 years had never seen. 
 
 " Henri," said he, " we must all perish. All Trance has come 
 to St. Domingo ! " 
 
 " Then we wiU perish," replied Henri. 
 
 " Undoubtedly : it is not much to perish, if that were all. 
 But the world will be the worse for ever. France is deceived. 
 She comes, in an error, to avenge herself, and to enslave the 
 blacks. France has been deceived." 
 
 " If we were but all together," said Henri, " so that there 
 
 were no momen<8 of weakness to fear. If your sons were but 
 
 with us " 
 
 " Fear no moments of weakness from me," said Toussaint, its 
 wonted fire now glowing in his eye. " My colour imposes on me 
 duties above nature ; and while my boys are hostages, they shall 
 be to me as if they no longer existed." 
 
 " They may posiiibly be on board the fleet," said Ohristophe. 
 " If by caution we could obtain possession of them " 
 
 " Speak no more of them now," said Toussaint. — Presently, 
 as if thinking aloud, and with his eyes still bent on the moving 
 ships, he went on : 
 
 " JSTo, those on board those ships are not boys, with life before 
 them, and eager alike for arts and arms. I see who they are 
 that are there. There are the troops of the Rhine — troops that 
 have conquered a fairer river than our Artibonite, storming the 
 castles on her steeps, and crowning themselves from her vine- 
 yards. There are the troops of the Alps — troops that have 
 soared above the eagle, and stormed the clouds, and plucked the 
 ice-king by the beard upon his throne. There are the troops of 
 Italy — troops that have trodden the old Roman ways, and fought 
 over again the old Roman wars — that have drunk of the Tiber, 
 and once more conquered the armies of the Danube. There are 
 the troops of Egypt — troops that have heard the war-cry of the 
 desert tribes, and encamped in the shadow of the pyramids." 
 
 " Tet he is not afraid," said Henri to himself, as he watched 
 the countenance of his friend. 
 
 " All these," continued Toussaint, " all these are brought 
 hither against a poor, depressed, insulted, ignorant race — 
 brought as conquerors, eager for the spoil before a blow is struck. 
 They come to disembarrass our paradise of us, as they would 
 clear a fragrant and fruitful wood of apes and reptiles. And if 
 they find that it takes longer than they suppose to crush and

 disperse ns, France has more thousands ready to come and help. 
 The labourer will leave his plough at a word, and the vine- 
 dresser his harvest, and the artisan his shop — France will pour 
 out the youth of all her villages, to seize upon the delights of the 
 tropics, and the wealth of the savages, as they are represented by 
 the emigrants who will not take me for a friend, but eat their 
 own hearts far away, with hatred and jealousy. All France is 
 coming to St. Domingo ! " 
 
 " But " interposed Christophe. 
 
 " But, Henri," interrupted his friend, laying his hand on his 
 shoulder, " not all France, with her troops of the Rhine, of the 
 Alps, of the Nile, nor with all Europe to help her, can ex- 
 tinguish the soul of Africa. That soul, when once the soul of a 
 man, and no longer that of a slave, can overthrow the pyramid' 
 and the Alps themselves, sooner than be again crushed down 
 into slavery." 
 
 "With God's help," said Ohristophe, crossing himself. 
 
 " With God's help," repeated Toussaint. " See here," he 
 continued, taking up a handful of earth from the broken ground 
 on which they stood, " see here what God has done ! See, here 
 are shells from the depth of yonder ocean, lying on the mountain 
 top. Cannot He who thus uproars the dust of His ocean floor, 
 and lifts it above the clouds, create the societies of men anew, 
 and set their lowest order but a little below the stars P " 
 
 " He can," said Christophe, again crossing himself. 
 
 " Then let aU France come to St. Domingo ! She may yet be 
 undeceived — What now ? " he resumed, after a pause of obser- 
 vation. " What manoeuvre is this P " 
 
 The ships, almost before they had drawn together, parted ofE 
 again; nearly two-thirds retiring to the north, and the rest 
 southwards. 
 
 " They are doing as we supposed they would," said Chris- 
 tophe ; " preparing to attack Cap Fran9ais and our southern or 
 western ixiwns at once ; perhaps both St. Domingo and Port-au- 
 Prince." 
 
 " Be it so ; we are ready for them," replied Toussaint. " But 
 now there is no time to lose. To Cotuy, to give our orders, and 
 then all to our posts ! " 
 
 Once more he took a survey of the vast fleet, in its two divi- 
 sions, and then spread his arms in the direction of his chief 
 cities, promising the foe to be ready to meet them there. In 
 another moment he was striding down the mountain. 
 
 His generals were awaiting him at Cotuy, and the horses of 
 the whole party were saddled. 
 
 " The French are come ? " they asked. 
 
 " The French are come in great force. Fifty-four ships-of- 
 war, carrying probably ten or twelve thousand men."

PREPARING FOR ACTION. 257 
 
 "We have twenty thousand reg^ar troops," cried Dessaliues. 
 " The day of the proud French has arrived ! " 
 
 L'Ouverture's calm eye checked his exultation. 
 
 " Ten or twelve thousand of the 61ite of the armies of Prance," 
 said Toussaint, " are sailing along our shores ; and large re- 
 inforcements may be following. Our twenty thousand troops 
 are untried in the field against a European foe ; but our cause 
 is good. Let us be bold, my friends ; but the leaders of armies 
 must not be presumptuous." 
 
 All uncovered their heads, and waited only his dismissal. 
 
 " Greneral Christophe, Cap Franijais and its district are wait- 
 ing for you. Let the flames of the city give us notice when the 
 French land." 
 
 Christophe embraced his friend, and was gone. 
 
 " Greneral Dessaliues, to your command in the west ! Preserve 
 your line of messengers from Leogane to my gate at Pongaudin, 
 and let me not want for tidings." 
 
 The tramp of Dessaliues' horse next died away. 
 
 " General La Plume, it is probable that your eye will have 
 to be busier than your hands. Ton will be ever ready for battle, 
 of course ; but remember that I rely on you for every point of 
 the south-west coast being watched, from Leogane round to Aux 
 Cayes. Send your communications through Dessaliues' line of 
 scouts." 
 
 La Plume withdrew, and Toussaint gazed after him in 
 reverie, till he was out of sight. 
 
 " And I ? " said Olerveaux, the only general officer now left in 
 attendance. 
 
 " Tour pardon. General Olerveaux. This your department in 
 the east is likely at present to remain tranquil, as I forewarned 
 yon. I now forewarn you that it may hereafter become the 
 seat of war, when you wUl have your day. Meantime, I may 
 at any time call upon your reserve ; and you will take care that 
 the enemy shall find no solace in your department, if they 
 should visit it. Let it be bare as the desert before them. Fare- 
 well ; I leave you in command of the east." 
 
 Olerveaux made his obeisance with an alacrity which caused 
 Toussaint to say to himself, as he mounted — 
 
 " Is he glad that the hour is come, or that his post is in the 
 rear of the battle ? " 
 
 Toussaint's own road lay homewards, where he had assembled 
 the choicest troops, to be ready for action on any point where 
 they might first be wanted, and where the great body of the 
 cultivators, by whom his personal influence was most needed, 
 were collected under his eye. As he now sped like the light- 
 ning through the shortest tracks, his trompettes proclaiming the 
 invasion through all the valleys, and over all the plains as they

 went, he felt strong and buoyant in heart, like the eagle overhead, 
 which was scared from its eyrie in Oibao by the proclamation 
 of war. For ever, as he rode, the thought recurred to fire his 
 soul, 
 
 " He is my rival now, and no longer my chief. I am free. It 
 is his own act, but Bonaparte has me for a rival now." 
 
 CHAPTER XXVIII. 
 
 MANY GUESTS. 
 
 Foe some weeks after the appearance of the fleet upon the 
 coast, nothing took place which could be called war. Toussaint 
 was resolved not to be the aggressor. Prepared at aU points, he 
 waited till those whom he stiU regarded as his fellow-citizens 
 should strike the first blow. He was the more willing to leave 
 an opening for peace till the last, that he heard that ladies were 
 on board — ladies from the court of France, come to enjoy the 
 delights of this tropical paradise. The sister of Bonaparte, 
 Madame Leolerc, the wife of the commander of the expedition, 
 was there. It seemed scarcely conceivable that she and her 
 train of ladies could have come with any expectation of 
 witnessing such a warfare as, ten years before, had shown how 
 much more savage than the beasts of the forest men may be. 
 It was as little conceivable that they could expect the negroes 
 to enter into slavery again at a word, after having enjoyed 
 freedom, and held rule for ten years. There must still be hope 
 of peace ; and Toussaint spared no effort to preserve it, tiU the 
 strangers should declare their intentions by some imequivocal 
 act. 
 
 For this object, L'Ouverture appeared gifted with ubiqtiity. 
 No flying Arab was ever in so many places so nearly at once. 
 Pongaudin, like every other estate which was in friendly hands, 
 was a sort of camp. Here the Commander-in-chief and his 
 officers had their head-quarters ; and here he was to be found, at 
 intervals of a few hours. During those intervals, he was inspecting 
 the fortifications of St. Marc, one of the strongest places of the 
 island, and under the charge of Dessalines ; or he was overlooking 
 the bight of Leogane, from behind Port-an-Prince ; or he 
 was visiting L'Etoile, made a strong post, and held by Charles 
 Bellair and his wife (for Deesha would not leave her husband) ; 
 ^or he was riding through the mornes to the north, re-animating, 
 with the sight of his beloved countenance, the companies there 
 held in reserve. He was on the heights of tlie Gros Morne, an

LANDING OF THE FRENCH. 259 
 
 admiring spectator, on occasion of that act of Christophe which 
 was the real cause of the delay and indecision of Leclerc and his 
 troops. 
 
 The main body of the French army was preparing to land, 
 immediately on its arrival at Cap Frau^ais, when Christophe 
 sent his friend and brother officer, Sangos, on board the fleet, to 
 acquaint Leclerc with the absence of the Commander-in-chief of 
 the colony, without whose permission the landing of troops could 
 not be allowed. If a landing by force were attempted, the city 
 would immediately be fired, and the inhabitants withdrawn. 
 General Leclerc could not believe this to be more than an empty 
 threat; but thought it as well to avoid risk, by landing in the 
 night at points where he was not looked for. Accordingly, he 
 sent some of his force on shore at Port Dauphin, to the east ; 
 while he himself, with a body of troops, set foot on the fatal 
 coast which he was never to leave, at Le Limbe, on the western 
 side of the ridge which commanded the town, hoping to drop 
 into the military quarter from the heights, before he was looked 
 for. Prom these heights, however, he beheld the town one mass 
 of fire. Christophe had withdrawn the inhabitants, including 
 two thousand whites, who were to be held as hostages in the 
 interior ; and so orderly and well-planned had been his proceedings, 
 that not the slightest personal injury was sustained by any 
 individual. Of this conflagration, Toussaint had been a witness 
 from the heights of Gros Morne. The horror which it occasioned 
 was for the strangers alone. All the movable property of the 
 citizens was safe in the interior : and they were all safe in person. 
 The dismay was for the French, when they found only a burning 
 soil, tumbling roofs, and tottering walls, where they had expected 
 repose and feasting after the ennui of a voyage across the Atlantic. 
 For the court ladies, there existed at present only the alternative 
 of remaining on board the ships, of which they were heartily 
 weary, and establishing themselves on the barren island of 
 Tortuga, the home of the buccaneers of former days. They shortly 
 after took possession of Tortuga, which they found to be a tropical 
 region indeed, but no paradise. It was not the best season for 
 turtle ; and there was no other of the luxuries whose savour had 
 reached the nostrils of the court of France. 
 
 Among the two thousand whites removed from Cap were, of 
 course, the ladies of the convent. They were safely established 
 under shelter of the fortifications of St. Marc, with all their little 
 comforts about them, and their mocking-bird as tuneful as when 
 hanging in its own orange-tree. Euphrosyne was not with them 
 — nor yet with her guardian. M. Critois had enough to do to 
 protect himself and his lady ; and he earnestly desired his ward 
 to be thankful that she had friends among the ruling powers. 
 Euphrosyne needed no commands on this head. She joined

 Madame Pascal, and was now with her and the secretary in the 
 half -camp, half -household o£ Pongandin. 
 
 Besides the family and establishment of the Commander-in- 
 chief, as many of the white gentry of Cap were accommodated 
 as the country palace of Pongaudin would contain. It seemed 
 doubtful how long they would have to find amusement for 
 themselves there ; for the invaders seemed to have fallen asleep. A 
 month had passed since the burning of Cap, and not another step 
 had been taken. Expectation had begun to be weary. The 
 feverish watching for news had begun to relax; the ladies no 
 longer shuddered at the bare idea of walking in the shrubberies ; 
 and some of the yoimger damsels had begun to need warnings 
 from L'Ouverture himself not to go out of bounds — by no means 
 to pass the line of sentinels in any direction. Instead of every- 
 thing French being spoken of with a faltering voice, any one was 
 now welcome who might be able to tell, even at second or third 
 hand, that Madame Leclerc had been seen, and what she wore, 
 and how she looked, and what she had said, either about the 
 colony or anything else. The officers, both civil and military, 
 found themselves able to devote their powers of entertainment 
 more and more to the ladies ; and the liability to be called off in 
 the midst of the game of chess, the poem, the song, or the dance, 
 seemed only to make their attentions more precious, because 
 more precarious, than those of the guests who knew themselves 
 to be hostages, and who had abundance of time for gallantry, if 
 only they had had spirits and inclination. Most of the party 
 certainly found the present position of affairs very duU. The 
 exceptions were few. They were poor Geuif rede, whose mind 
 was whoUy in the past, and before whose eyes the present went 
 forward as a dim dream ; her mother and sister, whose faculties 
 were continually on the stretch to keep up, under such circum- 
 stances, the hospitalities for which they were pledged to so large 
 a household ; the secretary and his bride, who were engrossed at 
 once with the crisis in public affairs and in their own ; and 
 Euphrosyne, who could find nothing duU after the convent, and 
 who unconsciously wished that, if this were invasion and war, 
 they might last a good while yet. 
 
 One evening, the 8th of February, was somewhat remarkable 
 for L'Ouverture being not only at home, but at leisure. He was 
 playing billiards with his oflicers and guests. It followed of 
 course that General Vincent was also present. It followed of 
 course ; for whether it was that Toussaint felt the peculiar in- 
 terest in him which report made observers look for towards an 
 intended son-in-law, or whether the chief distrusted him on 
 account of his fondness for Paris and the First Consul, Vincent 
 was for ever kept under the eye, and by the side of his General. 
 Aimee was wont to sigh when she heard her father's horse

 ordered ; for she knew tliat Vincent was going too ; and she 
 now rejoiced to see her father at the billiard-table ; for it told 
 her that Vincent was her own for the evening. 
 
 Vincent was not slow iu putting in his claim. At the fii-st 
 moment, when they were unobserved, he drew her to the window, 
 where the evening breeze blew in, fragrant and cool ; then into 
 the piazza ; then across the lawn ; then down to the gate which 
 opened upon the beach. He would have gone furtlier; but 
 there Aimee stopped, reminding him of the general order against 
 breaking bounds. 
 
 " That is all very well for the whites ; and for us, when the 
 whites have their eyes upon us," said Vincent. " But we are 
 not prisoners ; and there is not a prisoner abroad to-night. Come 
 — only as far as the mangroves ! We shall not be missed : and 
 if we should be, we can be within the gate in two minutes." 
 
 " I dare not," said Aimee, with a longing look, however, at 
 the pearly sands, and the creaming waves that now overspread 
 them, now lapsed in the gleam of the moon. The dark shadow 
 of the mangroves lay but a little way on. It was true that two 
 minutes would reach them ; but she stiU said, " I dare not." 
 
 " Who is there ? " cried the sentinel, in his march past the 
 gate. 
 
 " No strangers, Claude. Any news on your watch P " 
 
 " None, Mademoiselle." 
 
 " AU quiet over towards St. Marc ?" inquired Vincent. 
 
 " All quiet there, General; and everywhere else when the last 
 reports came round, ten minutes ago." 
 
 " Very well : pass on, good Claude. Come, come ! " he said to 
 Aimee ; " who knows when we may have a moonlight hour 
 again ! " 
 
 He woidd not bide another refusal, but, by gentle violence, 
 drew her out upon the beach, telling the sentinel, as they 
 passed between him and the water, that if they were inquired 
 for, he might call : they should be within hearing. Claude 
 touched his cap, showed his white teeth in a broad smile, and 
 did not object. 
 
 Once among the mangroves, Aimee could not repent. Their 
 arched branches, descending into the water, trembled with every 
 wave that gushed in among them, and stirred the mild air. The 
 moonliglit quivered on their dark green leaves, and on the trans- 
 parent pool which lay among their roots. 
 
 " Now, would you not have been sorry if I had not made 
 you come ? " said Vincent. 
 
 " If we could only stay — stay here for ever ! " she exclaimed, 
 leaning back against the bush under which they sat. " Here, 
 amidst the whispering of the winds and the dash of the waters, 
 you would listen no more for the roll of the drum, or the

 boomiug of cannon at St. Marc. I am weary of onr life 
 at Pongaudin." 
 
 " Weary of rumour of wars, before we have the wars them- 
 selves, love." 
 
 " We can never hear anything of my brothers while we are 
 on these terms with France. Day after day comes on — day after 
 day, and we have to toil, and plan, and be anxious; and our 
 guests grow tired, and nothing is done ; and we know that we 
 can hear nothing of what we most want to learn. I am certain 
 that my mother spends her nights in tears for her boys ; and 
 nothing is so likely to rouse poor GSnifrede as the prospect of 
 their coming back to us." 
 
 "And you yourself, Aimee, cannot be happy without Isaac." 
 
 " I never tried," said she. " I have daily felt his loss, be- 
 cause I wished never to cease to feel it." 
 
 " He is happier than you, dearest Aimee." 
 
 " Do not teH me that men feel such separations less than 
 women ; for I know it well already. I can never have been so 
 necessary to him as he is to me ; I know that well." 
 
 " Say ' was,' my Aimee. The time comes when sisters find 
 their brothers less necessary to them than they have been." 
 
 " Such a time has never come to me, and I believe it never 
 will. No one can ever be to me what Isaac has been." 
 
 " ' Has been ; ' — true. But see how times have changed ! 
 Isaac has left off writing to you so frequently as he did " 
 
 " No, no. He never did write frequently ; it was never his 
 habit to write as I wrote to him." 
 
 " Well, well. What«ver expectation may lie at the bottom of 
 this little heart, whatever secret remonstrance for his sUeuce, 
 whatever dissatisfaction with his apologies, whatever mortifica- 
 tion that such apologies were necessary " 
 
 " How dare you What right have yon to pry into my 
 
 heart?" exclaimed Aimfe, withdrainng herself from her com- 
 panion's side. 
 
 " The right of love," he replied, following till both were seated 
 on the very verge of the water. " Can you suppose that I do 
 not see your disappointment when L'Ouverture opens his dis- 
 patches, and there is not one of that particular size and fold 
 which makes your countenance change when you see it ? Can 
 you suppose that I do not mark your happiness, for hours and 
 days, Mter one of those closely- written sheets has come ? — hap- 
 piness which makes me feel of no account to you — happiness 
 which makes me jealous of my ^ary brother — ^f or my brother he 
 is, as he is yours." 
 
 " It should not do that," replied Aimee, as she sat looking 
 into the water. " Tou should not be angry at my being happy. 
 If you have learned so much of my thouglits "

 " Say on ! Oh, say on ! " 
 
 " There is no need," said she, " if you can read the soul 
 without speech, as you seem to profess." 
 
 " I read no thoughts but yours ; and none of yours that relate 
 to myself. I see at a glance every stir of your love to all be- 
 sides. If you care for me, I need to hear it from yourself." 
 
 " If this quarrel comes to bloodshed, what will become of my 
 brothers ? li you love me, tell me that." 
 
 " Still these brothers ! " cried Vincent, impatiently. 
 
 "And who should be inquired of concerning them, if not 
 yon P Tou took them to France ; you left, them there " 
 
 " I was sent here by Bonaparte — put on the deputation by his 
 express command. If not, I should not now have been here — I 
 should have remembered you only as a child, and •"

 both killed — suppose Madame Leelerc entering once more into 
 her brother's presence, a mourning widow — vrliat would Bona- 
 parte do -with Placide and Isaac P I am sure you have no com- 
 fort to give me, or you would not so evade what I ask." 
 
 " I declare, I protest you are mistaken. Bonaparte is every- 
 thing that is noble, and gracious, and gentle." 
 
 " Ton are sure of that P " 
 
 " Nay, why not P Have I not always said so ? and you have 
 delighted to hear me say so." 
 
 " I should delight to believe it now. I will believe it ; but 
 yet, if he were really noble, how should this quarrel have 
 arisen ? For, if ever man was noble, and gracious, and gentle, 
 my father is. If two such men come to open defiance, whose is 
 the crime, and wherein does it lie P " 
 
 " If the world fall to pieces, Aimee, there can be no doubt of 
 Bonaparte's greatness. What majesty he carries with him, 
 through all his conquests ! How whole nations quail under his 
 magnificent proclamations ! " 
 
 " Are they really fine ? I have seen but few ; and they " 
 
 " Are they not all grand p That proclamation in Egypt, for 
 instance, in which he said he was the Man of Pate who had 
 been foretold in the Koran, and that all resistance was impious 
 and vain ! If it had not happened four years before Bonaparte 
 went to Egypt, I should have thought your father " 
 
 "I was just thinking of that. But there is a great diffe- 
 rence. It was not my father, but Laveaux, who said that the 
 black chief, predicted by Raynal, had appeared. And it was 
 originally said, not as a divine prophecy, but because, in the 
 natural course of things, the redeemer of an oppressed race 
 must arise. Besides, my father says nothing but what he be- 
 lieves ; and I suppose Bonapai-te did not believe what he was 
 saying."

 "Do you think not P For my part, I believe his very words — 
 that to oppose him is impious and vain." 
 
 " Heaven pity us, if that he true ! Was it not in that 
 proclamation that Bonaparte said that men must account to him 
 for their secret thoughts, as nothing was concealed from him P " 
 " Yes ; just as L'Ouverture told the mulattoes in the church 
 at Cap that, from the other side of the island, his eye would be 
 upon them, and his arm stretched out, to restrain or punish. 
 He almost reached Bonaparte's strain there." 
 
 " I like my father's words the best, because all understood 
 and believed what he said. Bonaparte may claim to read secret 
 thoughts ; but before my father, men have no secret thoughts — 
 they love him so that their minds stand open." 
 
 " Then those Italian proclamations, and letters to the Direc- 
 tory," said Vincent; "how they grew grander, as city after 
 city, and state after state, fell before him! When he sum- 
 moned Pavia to open her gates to him, after her insurrection, 
 how imperious he was ! If he had found that a drop of Trench 
 blood had been shed, he declared not a stone of the city should 
 have remained ; but a column should arise in its place, bearing 
 the inscription, ' Here once stood Pavia ! ' There spoke the 
 man who held the ages in his hand, ready to roll them over the 
 civilized world — to crumble cities, and overthrow nations, in 
 case of resistance to his will ! How Paris rang with acclama- 
 tions when these words passed from mouth to mouth ! He was 
 worshipped as a god." 
 
 " It is said," sighed Aimee, " that Leclerc has proclamations 
 from him for our people. I wonder what they are, and how 
 they will be received." 
 
 " With enthusiasm, no doubt. When and where has it been 
 otherwise ? Ton shudder, my Aimee ; but, trust me, there is 
 inconceivable folly in the idea of opposing Bonaparte. As he 
 said in Egypt, it is impious and vain. Trust me, love, and 
 decide accordingly." 
 
 " Desert my father and my family in their hour of peril ! I 
 will not do that." 
 
 " There is no peril in the case, love ; it is gloiy and happi- 
 ness to live under Bonaparte. My life upon it, he will do your 
 father no injury, but continue him in his command, under 
 certain arrangements; and, as for the blacks, they and the 
 whites will join in one common enthusiasm for the conqueror of 
 Europe. Let us be among the first, my Aimee ! Be mine ; 
 and we will go to the French forces — among my friends there. 
 It is as if we were called to be mediators ; it is as if the welfare 
 of your family and the colony were, in a measure, consigned to 
 our hands. Once married, and with Leclerc, how easuy may 
 we explain away causes of quarrel ! How completely shall we

 make him understand L'Ouverture ! And liow, tlirough us, 
 Leclerc pan put your father in possession of the views of Bona- 
 parte : Oh, Aimee, be mine, and let us go ! " 
 
 " And if it were otherwise — if it came to bloodshed — to deadly- 
 warfare P " 
 
 "Then, love, you would least of all repent. Alone and 
 desolate — parted from your brothers — parted from me." 
 
 " From you, Vincent ? " 
 
 " Assuredly. I can never unsheath my sword against those 
 to whom my attachment is strong. I can never fight against 
 an army from Paris — troops that have been led by Bonaparte." 
 
 " Does my father know that ? " 
 
 " He cannot know me if he anticipates anything else. 1 
 execute his orders at present, because I admire his system of 
 government, and am anxious that it should appear to the best 
 advantage to the brother-in-law of the First Consul. Thus, I 
 am contident that there will be no war. But, love, if there 
 should be, you will be parted for ever from your brothers and 
 from me, by remaining here — you will never again see Isaac. 
 Nay, nay ! No tears ! no terrors, my Aimee ! By being mine, 
 and going with me to that place where all are happy — to Paris 
 — you will, through my interest, best aid your father ; and 
 Isaac and I will watch over you for ever." 
 
 '' Not a word more, Vincent ! Tou make me wretched. Not 
 a word more, tiU I have spoken to my father. He must, he 
 wiU tell me what he thinks, what he expects — whether he fears. 
 Hark ! There are horsemen ! " 
 
 " Can it be ? Horsemen approaching on this side P I will 
 look out." 
 
 " No, no ! Vincent, you shall not go — " 
 
 Her terror was so great that Vincent could not indeed leave 
 her. As the tramp of a company of horsemen became almost 
 lost on quitting the hard road for the deep sand, he dropped his 
 voice, whispering in her ear that she was quite safe, completely 
 hidden under the mangroves, and that he would not leave her. 
 She clasped his hand with both hers, to compel him to keep his 
 word, and implored him not to speak — not to shake a leaf of 
 their covert. 
 
 The company passed very near ; so near as that the sand 
 thrown up by the horses' feet pattered among the foliage of the 
 mangroves. No one of the strangers was then speaking ; but iu 
 another moment the sentry challenged them. They laughed, 
 and were certainly stopping at the little gate. 
 
 " We know your master, fellow," said one. " We have had 
 more talk with him in one day than you in all your service." 
 
 '' I am sure I ought to know that voice," whispered Aimee, 
 drawing a long breath. 
 


## p. (#270) ################################################

266 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 The strangers were certainly intending to pass through the 
 gate into the grounds ; and the sentry was remonstrating. In 
 another moment he fired, as a signal. There was some cmnoui' 
 and laughter, and Aimee started, as at a voice from the grave. 
 
 " That is Isaac's voice ! " she exck,imed, springing from her 
 seat. It was now Vincent's turn to hold her hands, or she 
 would have been out in the broad moonlight in an instant. 
 
 " Stay, love ! Stay one moment," he entreated. " I believe 
 you are right ; but let me look out." 
 
 She sank down on the sand, while he reconnoitred. At the 
 moment of his looking forth, a young man who, he was certain, 
 was Placide, was good-humouredly taking the sentry by the 
 shoulders, and pushing him from his place, while saying some- 
 thing in his ear, which made the poor soldier toss his hat in the 
 air, and run forward to meet his comrades, whom the soimd of 
 his gun was bringing from every direction, over the sands. 
 
 " It is they, indeed," said Yincent. " Tour brothers are both 
 there." 
 
 While he was speaking, Aimee burst from the covert, made 
 her way miraculously through the gathering horses and men, 
 pushed through the gate, leaving her lover some way behind, 
 flew like a lapwing through the shrubbery, and across the lawn, 
 was hanging on her brother's neck before the news of the arrival 
 was understood within the house. 
 
 There was no waiting tiH father and mother could choose 
 where to meet their cliildren. The lads followed the messenger 
 into the salon, crowded as it was with strangers. L'Ouverture's 
 voice was the first heard, after the sudden hush. 
 
 "Now, Heaven bless Bonaparte for this!" he cried, "and 
 make him a happy father ! " 
 
 " Hear him, O God ! and bless Bonaparte ! " sobbed Margot. 
 
 A check was given to their words and their emotions, by seeing 
 by whom the young men were accompanied. Therese was lead- 
 ing forward Genifrede, when she stopped short, with a sort of 
 groan, and returned to her seat, forgetful at the moment even 
 of Genifrede ; for M. Papalier was there. Other gentlemen were 
 of the company. The one whom the young men most punc- 
 tiliously introduced to their father was M. Coasson, the tutor, 
 guardian, or envoy, under whose charge General Leclere had 
 sent them home. 
 
 Toussaint offered him a warm welcome, as the guardian of his 
 sons ; but M. Coasson himself seemed most impressed with his 
 office of envoy: as did the gentlemen who accompanied him. 
 Assuming the air of an ambassador, and looking round him, as 
 if to require the attention of all present, M. Coasson discharged 
 himself of his commission, as follows : — 
 
 " General Toussaint " 
 


## p. (#271) ################################################

THE PtRST CONSULTS COMMANDS. 267 
 
 '' They will not acknowledge him as L'OuTerture," observed 
 Therese to Madame Pascal and G6nifrede. Afra's eyes filled 
 with tears. Geuifrede was absorbed in contemplating her bro- 
 thers — both grown manly, and the one looking the soldier, the 
 other the student. 
 
 " General Toussaint," said Ooasson, " I come, the bearer of a 
 letter to you from the First Consul." 
 
 In his hand was now seen a gold box, which he did not, how- 
 ever, deliver at the moment. 
 
 " With it, I am commissioned to offer the greetings of General 
 Leclerc, who awaits with anxiety your arrival at his quarters as 
 his Lieutenant-General." 
 
 " Upon what does General Leclerc ground his expectation of 
 seeing me there ? " 
 
 " Upon the ground of the commands of the First Consul, de- 
 clared in his proclamation to the inhabitants of St. Domingo, 
 and, no doubt, more fully in this letter to yourself." 
 
 Here he delivered the box, desiring that the presence of him- 
 self and his compauious might be no impediment to General 
 Toussaint's reading his dispatches. 
 
 Toussaint had no intention that they should be any hindrance. 
 He read and re-read the letter, while all eyes but those of Aimee 
 were fixed upon his countenance. With an expression of the 
 quietest satisfaction, she was gazing upon her brothers, unvexed 
 by the presence of numbers, and the transaction of state busi- 
 ness. They were there, and she was happy. 
 
 Those many eyes failed to discover anything from the coun- 
 tenance of Toussaint. It was immovable ; and M. Coasson was 
 so far disappointed. It had been his object to prevent the 
 dispatches which he brought from being read in private, that he 
 might be enabled to report how they were received. He had 
 still another resource. He announced that he had brought with 
 him the proclamation of the First Consul to the inhabitants at 
 large of St. Domingo. As it was a public document, he would, 
 with permission, read it aloud. Toussaint now looked round, to 
 command attention to the words of the ruler of France. Vincent 
 sought to exchange glances with Aimee ; but Aimee had none to 
 spare. M. Papalier had unceremoniously entered into conversa- 
 tion with some of the guests of his own complexion, and did not 
 cease upon any hint, declaring to those about him, that none of 
 this was new to him, as he was in the counsels of Bonaparte in 
 all St. Domingo affairs. The tone of their conversation was, 
 liowever, reduced to a low murmur, while M. Coasson read aloud 
 the following proclamation : — 
 
 " Paris, Nov. 8, 1801. 
 " Inhabitants of St. Domingo, 
 
 " Whatever your origin or your colour, j'ou are all Fi'ouch :

 you are all equal, and all free, before God, and before the Re- 
 public. 
 
 " France, like St. Domingo, has been a prey to factions, torn 
 by intestine commotions and foreign wars. But all has changed : 
 all nations have embraced the French, and have sworn to them 
 peace and amity : the French people have embraced each other, 
 and have sworn to be aU friends and brothers. Come also, em- 
 brace the French, and rejoice to see again your European friends 
 and brothers ! 
 
 " The government sends you the Captain-Greneral Leclerc. 
 He has brought " 
 
 Here M. Ooasson's voice and manner became extremely em- 
 phatic. 
 
 " He has brought sufficient force for protecting you against 
 your enemies, and against the enemies of the Republic. If you 
 are told that these forces are destined to violate your liberties, 
 reply, ' The Republic will not suffer them to be taken from us.' 
 
 " Rally round the Captain- General. He brings you abundance 
 and peace. Rally all of you around him. Whoever shall dare 
 to separate himself from the Captain-General will be a traitor to 
 his country ; and the indignation of the country will devour him, 
 as the fire devours your dried canes. 
 
 "Done at Paris," &c. 
 
 " This document is signed, you wiU. perceive," said M. Ooas- 
 son, " by the First Consul, and by the Secretary of State, M. H. 
 B. Maret." 
 
 Once more it was in vain to explore the countenance of 
 L'Ouverture. It was still immovable. He extended his hand 
 for the document, saying that he would retire with his secretary, 
 for the purpose of preparing his replies for the First Consul, in 
 order that no such delays might take place on his part, as the 
 date of the letter and proclamation showed to have intervened 
 on the other side. Meantime, he requested that M. Coasson, and 
 all whom he had brought in his company, would make them- 
 selves at home in his house ; and, turning to his wife and family, 
 he commended his newly arrived guests to their hospitality. 
 With a passing smile and greeting to his sons, he was about to 
 leave the room witli M. Pascal, when M. (Joasson intimated that 
 he had one thing more to say. 
 
 " I am directed. General Toussaint," said he, " in case of your 
 refusal to join the French forces immediately, to convey your 
 sons back to the guardianship of the Captain-General Leclerc : 
 and it will be my duty to set out with them at dawn." 
 
 A cry of anguish broke forth from Margot, and Placide was 
 instantly by her side. 
 
 " Pear nothing," said Toussaint to her, in a tone which once

 more fixed all eyes upon him. His countenance was no longer 
 unmoved. It was convulsed, for a moment, with passion. He was 
 calm in his manner, however, as he turned to M. Coasson, and said, 
 
 " Sir, my sous are at home. It rests with myself and with 
 them, what excursions they make henceforth." 
 
 He bowed, and left the room with M. Pascal. 
 
 CHAPTER XXIX. 
 
 THE HOUR OF PEOOP. 
 
 " So the long-expected letter is come at last," observed M. Pascal, 
 as the study-door closed upon himself and his friend. 
 
 " Head it," said Toussaint, putting the letter into the secre- 
 tary's hand, and walking up and down the room, till his friend 
 spoke again. 
 
 " "We hear," said M. Pascal, "that the First Consul under- 
 stands men. He may understand some men — the soldiery of 
 France, perhaps — but of others he knows no more than if he 
 were not himself a man." 
 
 " He no more understands my people than myself. Can it be 
 possible that he believes that proclamation will be acceptable to 
 them — that mixture of cajolery and bombast. He has heard 
 that we are ignorant, and he concludes that we are without 
 understanding. What think you of his promise of abundance 
 by the hands of Leclerc ? As if it were not their cupidity, ex- 
 cited by oar abundance, which has brought these thousands of 
 soldiers to our shores ! They are welcome to it all — to our 
 harvests, our money, and our merchandise — if they would not 
 touch our freedom." 
 
 " Bonaparte has a word to say to that in his letter to you,'' 
 observed the secretary. " ' What can you desire ? The freedom 
 of the blacks ? You know that in all the countries we have been 
 in, we have given it to the people who had it not ? ' What say 
 the Venetians to that ? What says the Pope ! " 
 
 " Does he suppose us deaf," replied Toussaint, " that we have 
 not heard of the fate of our race in Guadaloupe, and Martinique, 
 and Cayenne ? Does he suppose us blind, that we do not see the 
 pirates he has commissioned hovering about the shores of Afiica, 
 as the vulture preparing to strike his prey P Ignorant as we are, 
 does he suppose us stupid enough to be delighted when, free 
 already, we find ourselves surrounded by fifty-four war-ships, 
 which come to promise ns liberty ? " 
 
 " He does not know, apparently, how our commerce with the 
 world brings us tidings of all the world." 
 


## p. (#274) ################################################

270 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " And if it were not so — if his were the first ships that our 
 eyes had ever seen — does he not know that the richest tidings 
 of liberty come, not through the eye and ear, but from the heart ? 
 Does he not know that the liberties of St. Domingo, large as they 
 are, everlasting as they will prove to be — all sprang from here 
 and here ? " — pointing to his head and heart. " This is he," he 
 continued, " who has been king in my thoughts, from th« hour 
 when I heard of the artiUe^ officer who had saved the Conven- 
 tion ! This is he to whom I have felt myself bound as a brother 
 in destiny and in glory ! This is he with whom I hoped to share 
 the lot of reconciling the quarrel of races and of ages ! In the 
 eye of the world he may be great, and I the bandit captain of a 
 despised race. On the page of history he may be magnified, 
 and I derided. But I spurn him for a hero — I reject him for a 
 brother. My rival he may make himself. His soul is narrow, 
 and his aims are low. He might have been a god to the world, 
 and he is a tyrant. We have followed him with wistful eyes, to 
 see him loosen bonds with a divine touch ; and we find him busy 
 forging new chains. He has sullied his divine commission ; and 
 whue my own remains pure, he is no brother of my soul. Tou, 
 my friend, knew him better than I, or you would not have left 
 his service for mine." 
 
 " Yet I gave him credit for a better appreciation of you, a 
 cleai-er foresight of the destiny of this colony, than he has shown." 
 
 " WhUe we live, my friend, we must accept disappointment. 
 In my youth, I learned to give up hope after hope ; and one of 
 the brightest I must now relinquish in my old age." 
 
 " Two brilliant ones have, however, entered your dwelling 
 this evening, my friend," said the secretary. 
 
 " My boys ? Are they not ? But these are times to show 
 
 what they are. In the joy of having them back, I might have 
 
 forgiven and forgotten everything, but for the claim Tou 
 
 heard, Pascal P " 
 
 " About their leaving you at dawn. Tes ; that was amusing." 
 
 " If they will not consider a negro a man, they might hare 
 remembered that beasts are desperate to recover the young that 
 they have lost. Leclerc will find, however, that this night will 
 make men of my sons. I will call them my boys no more ; and 
 never more shall this envoy call them his pupils, or his charge. 
 These French will find that there is that in this St. Domingo ( f 
 ours which quickly ripens young wits, and makes the harvest 
 ready in a day. Let them beware the reaping ; for it is another 
 sort of harvest than they look for. — But come," said he : " it is 
 late ; and we have to answer the letter of this foreigner — this 
 stranger to my race and nature." 
 
 He took some papers from his pocket, sat down beside the friend, 
 and said, with the countenance of one who has heard good news.

A D/SASTER. 2/ 1 
 
 " See here how little they comprehend how negroes may be 
 friends ! See here the proofs that they understand my Henri no 
 better than myself." 
 
 And he put into the hands of his secretary those fine letters of 
 Christophe, which do everlasting honour to his head and heart, 
 and show that he bore a kingly soul before he adorned the 
 kingly ofB.ce. As M. Pascal read the narrative of Leclerc's 
 attempts to alarm, to cajole, and to bribe Ohristophe to betray 
 his friend's cause, and deliver up his person, the pale counte- 
 nance of the secretary became now paler with anger and disgust, 
 now flushed with pleasure and admiration. 
 
 "Here is the friend that sticketh closer than a brother," 
 said he. 
 
 " Alas ! poor Paul ! he will be faithful, Pascal ; but he can 
 never again love me." 
 
 " Pardon me, I entreat you. I meant no allusion." 
 
 " Ton did not. But everything serves as an allusion there ; 
 for Paul is never out of my mind. Now for our letters ; — that 
 to Leclerc modified, as you perceive, hy our knowledge of what 
 has passed between him and Henri." 
 
 " Modified, indeed ! " exclaimed Pascal. 
 
 Their proceedings were destined to be further modified by the 
 events of this night. Tidings as black as the darkest night that 
 ever brooded over the island in the season of storms poured in 
 to overshadow the prospects of the negroes, and the hopes of 
 their chief. 
 
 It was after midnight when, in the midst of their quiet con. 
 sultation, Toussaint and his secretary thought they heard voices 
 at the gate. Toussaint was going to ascertain, when he was met 
 in the hall by news that a messenger from the south-west had 
 arrived. The messenger entered, halting and slow. 
 
 " It is no," said Pascal ; " surely it cannot be — —" 
 
 " Is it possible that you are Jacques ? " exclaimed Toussaint, 
 his eyes shaded by his hand. 
 
 '' I am Dessalines," said the wounded man, who had already 
 sunk upon a seat. 
 
 " Why come yourself, in this state !" cried Toussaint, hasten- 
 ing to support him. 
 
 " I could more easily come than write my news," replied 
 Dessalines ; " and it is news that I would commit to no man's 
 ear but your own.'" 
 
 " Shall I go P " asked M. Pascal of Toussaint. 
 
 " No. Stay and hear. Tell us your tidings, Jacques." 
 
 " I am as well here as down in the south-west, or you would 
 not have seen me." 
 
 " You mean that aU is lost there ? " 
 
 " All is lost there,"

272 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " While the enemy is beguiling us with letters, and talk of 
 truce ! " observed Toussaint to Pascal. " Where was your battle, 
 Jacques ? How can all the west be lost ? " 
 
 " The French have bought La Plume. They told him your 
 cause was desperate, and promised him honours and office in 
 France. Get me cured, and let me win a battle for yon, and I 
 have no doubt I can buy him back again. Meantime " 
 
 " Meantime, what has Domage done ? Is he with me or 
 La Plume ? And is Chaney safe ? " 
 
 " Domage never received your instructions. La Plume carried 
 them, and no doubt, your aide-de-camp also, straight to the 
 French. Ohaney has not been seen : he is traitor or prisoner." 
 
 " Then Cayes is not burned, nor Jeremie defended ? " 
 
 " Neither the one nor the other. Both are lost; and so is Port- 
 au-Prince. My troops and I did our best at the Croix de Bos- 
 quets : but what could we do in such a case ? I am here, 
 wounded within an inch of my life ; and they are in the fast, 
 nesses. Ton were a doctor once, L'Ouverture. Set me up again ; 
 and I will gather my men from the mountains, and prick these 
 whites all across the peninsula into the sea." 
 
 "I will be doctor, or nurse, or anything, to save yon, 
 Jacques." 
 
 " What, if I have more bad news? Will you not hate me ? " 
 
 " Lose no time, my friend. This is no hour for trifling." 
 
 " There is no room for trifling, my friend. I fear — I am not 
 certain — ^but I fear the east is lost." 
 
 " Is Olerveaux bought too? " 
 
 " Not bought. He is more of your sort than La Plume's. He 
 is incorruptible by money; but he likes the French, and he 
 loves peace. He would be a very brother to you, if he only 
 loved liberty better than either. As it is, he is thought to have 
 delivered over the whole east, from the Isabella to Cap Samana, 
 without a blow." 
 
 " And my brother ! " 
 
 " He ha? disappeared from the city. He did not yield ; but 
 he could du nothing by himself, or with only his griard. He 
 disappeared in the night, and is thought to have put ofE by water. 
 Ton will soon hear from him, I doubt not. Now I have told my 
 news, and I am faint. Where is Therese ? " 
 
 '.' She is here. Look more like yourself, and she shall be 
 called. Ton have told all your news ? " 
 
 "All; and I am glad it is out." 
 
 " Keep up your heart, Dessalines ! I have you and Henri; 
 and God is with the faithful. — Now to your bed, my friend." 
 
 Instead of the attendants who were summoned, Therese 
 entered. She spoke no word, but aided by her servant, had 
 her husband carried to his chamber. When the door was closed,

 sad and serious as were the tidings wMch had now to be acted 
 upon, the secretary could not help askiog L'Ouverture if he, had 
 ever seen Madame DessaUnes look as she did just now. 
 
 " Tes," he replied, " on certain occasions, some years since. — 
 But here she is again." 
 
 Th&ese came to say that her husband had yet something to 
 relate into Toussaint's own ear before he could sleep ; but, on 
 her own part, she entreated that she might first be permitted to 
 dress his wounds. 
 
 " Send for me when you think fit, and I will come, madame. 
 But, Therese, one word. I am aware that M. Papalier is here. 
 Do not forget that you are a Christian, and pledged to forgive 
 injuries." 
 
 "Tou think you read my thoughts, L'Ouverture ; but you do 
 not. Listen, and I am gone. His voice once had power over 
 me through love, and then through hatred. I never miss the 
 lightest word he speaks. I heard him tell his old friends from 
 Cap that I was his slave, and that the time was coming when mas- 
 ters would claim their own again. Now you know my thoughts." 
 
 And she was gone. 
 
 When Toussaint returned from his visit to Dessalines' cham- 
 ber, he found M. Pascal sitting with his face hid in his hands. 
 
 " Meditation is good," said Toussaint, laying his hand on his 
 friend's shoulder. " Lamentation is unworthy." 
 
 " It is so ; and we have much to do," replied the secretary, 
 rousing himself. 
 
 " Fear not," resumed Toussaint, " but that your bride will 
 bloom in the air of the mountains. We may have to entrench 
 ourselves in the momes — or, at least, to place there our ladies, 
 and the civil ofiScers of the government ; but we ought to thank 
 God for providing those natural homes, so full of health and 
 beauty, for the free in spirit. I have still three brigades, and 
 the great body of the cultivators, in reserve ; but we shall all act 
 with stronger hearts if our heart's treasure is safe in the mornes." 
 
 " Are we to lose Dessalines ? " asked M. Pascal. 
 
 "I believe not. He is severely wounded, and, at this moment, 
 exasperated. He vows the death of M. Papalier ; and I vow 
 his safety whUe he is my guest." 
 
 " Papalier and Madame Dessalines cannot exist in one house." 
 
 " And therefore must this deputation be dismissed early in 
 the morning, if there were no other reasons. Notice must be 
 carried to them with their coffee, that I am awaiting them with 
 my replies. Those delivered, negotiation is at an end, and we 
 must act. My foes have struck the blow which unties my hands." 
 
 " What has M. Papalier to do with the deputation ? " 
 
 "Nothing, but that he uses its protection to attempt to resume 
 his estates. They are in commission ; and he may have them ;

 though not, as he thinks, with men and women as jjart of his 
 chattels. No more of him." 
 
 "Of whom next, then? Except Christophe, who is there 
 worthy to be named by you ? " asked M. Pascal, with emotion. 
 
 " Every one who has deserted us, except, perhaps, La Plume. 
 He is sordid ; and I dismiss him. As for Olerveaux and his 
 thousands, they have been weak, but not, perhaps, wicked. They 
 may be recoTered. I take the blame of their weakness upon 
 myself. Would that I alone could bear the consequences ! " 
 
 " Tou take the blame of their weakness ? Is not their former 
 slavery the cause of it ? Is there anything in their act but the 
 sei-vility in which they were reared ? " 
 
 " There is much of that. But I have deepened the taint, in 
 striving to avoid the opposite corruption of revenge. I have 
 the taint myself. The stain of slavery exists in the Eirst of the 
 Blacks himself. Let aU others, then, be forgiven. They may 
 thus be recovered. I gave them the lesson of loving and trusting 
 the whites. They have done so, to the point of being treacherous 
 to me. I must now give them another lesson, and time to learn 
 it ; and they may possibly be redeemed." 
 
 '' Tou win hold out in the momes — conduct your resistance 
 on a pinnacle, where the eyes of the blacks may be raised to 
 you— fixed upon you." 
 
 " Just so ; — and where they may flock to me, when time shall 
 have taught them my principle and my policy, and revealed the 
 temper and purpose of our invaders. Now, then, to prepare ! " 
 
 Before dawn, the despatches for the French, on the coast and 
 at home, were prepared ; and messengers were dismissed, in every 
 direction, with orders by which the troops which remained 
 faithful would be concentrated, the cultivators raised and col- 
 lected, stores provided in the fastnesses, and the new acquisitions 
 of the enemy rendered useless to them. Never had the heads of 
 these two able men, working in perfect concert, achieved such a 
 mass of work in a single night. 
 
 A little after sunrise, the French party appeared in the salon, 
 where already almost every member of the household was col- 
 lected ; all being under the impression that a crisis had arrived, 
 and that memorable words were about to be spoken. 
 
 Toussaint acknowledged the apparent discourtesy of appointing 
 the hour for the departure of his guests ; but declared that he 
 had no apology to offer : — that the time for courteous observance 
 was past, when his guests were discovered to be sent merely to 
 amuse and disarm him for the hour, while blows were struck at 
 a distance against the liberties of his race. In delivering his 
 despatches, he said, he was delivering his farewell. Within an 
 hour, the deputation and himself must be travelling in different 
 directions.

 M. Coasson, on receiving the packets, said tliat he Jiatl no 
 other desire than to be on his way. There couhl be no satisfaction, 
 and little safety, in remaining in a house where, under a hypo- 
 critical pretence of magnanimity and good-will, there lurked a 
 spirit of hideous malice, of diabolical revenge, towards a race to 
 whom nature, and the universal consent of men, had given a 
 superiority which they could never lose. 
 
 In unaffected surprise, Toussaint looked in the face of the 
 envoy, observing that, for himself, he disclaimed all such passion 
 and such dissimulation as his household was charged with. 
 
 " Of course you do," replied Coasson : " but I require not 
 your testimony. The men of a family may, where there is occa- 
 sion, conceal its ruling passion : but, where there is occasion, it 
 will be revealed by the women." 
 
 Toussaint's eyes, like every one's else, turned to the ladies of 
 his family. It was not Madame L'Ouverture that was intended, 
 for her countenance asked of her husband what this could mean. 
 It could not be Aimee, who now stood drowned in tears, where 
 she could best conceal her grief. Geuif rede explained. She told 
 calmly, and without the slightest confusion, that M. Coasson had 
 sought a conversation with her, for the purpose of winning over 
 her feelings, and her influence with her father, to the side of 
 the French. He had endeavoured to make her acknowledge 
 that the whole family, with the exception of its head, were in 
 favour of peace, admirers of Bonaparte, and aware that they 
 were likely to be victims to the ambition of their father. Her 
 reply, in which she declared that she gloried, was that the 
 deepest passion of her soul was hatred of the whites ; and that 
 she prayed for their annihilation. 
 
 " And did you also declare, my daughter," said Toussaint, 
 " that in this yon differ from us all ? Did you avow that your 
 parents look upon this passion in you as a disease, for which 
 you have their daily and nightly prayers ? " 
 
 " I did declare, my father, that I alone of the Ouvertures 
 know how to feel for the wrongs of my race. But M. Coasson 
 did not believe me, and vowed that we should all suffer for the 
 opinions held by me alone." 
 
 " It is true, I did not believe, nor do I now believe," said 
 Coasson, " that the devil would single out one of a famUy, to 
 corrupt her heart with such atrocious hatred as that whose 
 avowal chilled the marrow of my bones. It was her coun- 
 tenance of wretchedness that attracted me. I saw that she was 
 less capable of dissimulation than the rest of you; and so I 
 have found." 
 
 " A wise man truly has the Captain-General chosen for an 
 envoy ! " observed Toussaint : " a wise and an honourable man ! 
 He sees woe in the face of a woman, and makes it his instrument

 for discovering the secret souls of her family. Blindly bent upon 
 this object, and haying laid open, as he thinks, one heart, he 
 reads the rest by it. But he may, with all his wisdom, and all 
 this honour, be no less ignorant than before he saw us. So far 
 from reading aU our souls, he has not eyen read the suffering 
 one that he has tempted. Tou have opened the sluices of the 
 waters of bitterness in my child's soul, M. Coasson, but you 
 have not found the source." 
 
 " Time will show that," observed the envoy. 
 
 " It vriU," replied Toussaint ; " and also the worth of your 
 threat of revenge for the words of my sufiering child. I have 
 no more to say to you. — ^My sons ! " 
 
 Placide sprang to his side, and Isaac followed. 
 
 " I no longer call you boys ; for the choice of this hour 
 makes you men. The Captain-General insists that you go from 
 me. He has no right to do so. Neither have I a right to bid 
 you stay. Hear, and decide for yourselves. — The cause of the 
 blacks is not so promising as it appeared last night. News has 
 arrived, from various quarters, of defeat and defection. Our 
 struggle for our liberties will be fierce and long. It wiU never 
 be relinquished ; and my own conviction is, that the cause of 
 the blacks wiU finally prevail ; that St. Domingo vrill never 
 more belong to Prance. The ruler of France has been a guardian 
 to you- — an indulgent guardian. I do not ask you to fight 
 against him." 
 
 The faces of both the young men showed strong and Joyful 
 emotion ; but it was not the same emotion in them both. 
 
 "Decide according to your reason and your hearts, my 
 children, whether to go or stay ; remembering the importance 
 of your choice." Putting a hand on the shoulder of each, he 
 said impressively, " Go to the Captain-General, or remain with me. 
 Whichever you do, I shall always equally love and cherish you." 
 
 Margot looked upon her sons, as if awaiting from them life 
 or death. Aim6e's face was still hidden in her handkerchief. 
 She had nothing to learn of her brother's inclinations. 
 
 Isaac spoke before Placide could open his lips. 
 
 " We knew, father," he said, " that your love and your rare 
 liberality — that liberality which gave us our French education 
 — would not fail now. And this it is that persuades me that 
 this quarrel cannot proceed to extremities — that it will not be 
 necessary for your sons to take any part, as you propose. When 
 Placide and I think of you — your love of peace, your loyalty, 
 and your admiration of Bonaparte ; and then, when we think of 
 Bonaparte — his astonishment at what you have done in the 
 colony, and the terms in which he always spoke of you to us — 
 when we consider how you two are fitted to appreciate each 
 other, wo cannot believe but that the Captain-General and yon

 will soon be acting in harmony, for the good of both races. But 
 for this assurance, we could hardly have courage to return." 
 
 " Speak for yourself alone, Isaac," said his brother. 
 
 " Well, then : I say for myself, that, but for this certainty, it 
 would almost break my heart to leaye you so soon again, though 
 to go at present no further oif than Tortuga. But I am quite 
 confident that there will soon be perfect freedom of intercourse 
 among all who are on the island." 
 
 " You return with me ? " asked M. Coasson. 
 
 " Certainly, as my father gives me my choice. I feel myself 
 bound, in honour and gratitude, to return, instead of appearing 
 to escape, at the very first opportunity, from those with whom I 
 can never quarrel. Returning to Leclerc, under his conditional 
 orders, can never be considered a declaration against my father : 
 while remaining here, against Leclerc's orders, is an undeniable 
 declaration against Bonaparte and France — a declaration which 
 I never will make." 
 
 " I stay with my father," said Placide. 
 
 "Tour reasons?" asked M. Ooassou; "that I may report 
 them to the Captain-General." 
 
 '■ I have no reasons," replied Placide; " or, if I have, I cannot 
 recollect them now. I shall stay with my father." 
 
 "Welcome home, my boy!" said Toussaint; "and Isaac, 
 my son, may God bless you, wherever you go." 
 
 And he opened his arms to them both. 
 
 " I am not afraid," said Madame L'Ouverture, timidly, as if 
 scarcely venturing to say so much — " I am not afraid but that, 
 happen what may, we can always make a comfortable home for 
 Placide." 
 
 " Never mind comfort, mother : and least of all for me. We 
 have something better than comfort to try for now." 
 
 " Give me your blessing, too, father," said Aimee, faintly, as 
 Isaac led her forward, and Vincent closely followed. " You 
 said you would bless those that went, and those that stayed ; and 
 I am going with Isaac." 
 
 The parents were speechless ; so that Isaac could explain that 
 the Captain-General offered a welcome to as many of the Ouver- 
 tures as were disposed to join him ; and that Madame Leclerc had 
 said that his sisters would find a home and protection with her. 
 
 "And I cannot separate from Isaac yet," pleaded Aimee. 
 " And with Madame Leclerc " 
 
 " General Vincent,^' said Toussaint, addressing his aide 
 before noticing his daughter, " have the goodness to prepare for 
 an immediate journey. I will give yon your commission when 
 you are ready to ride." 
 
 After one moment's hesitation, Vincent bowed, and withdrew. 
 He was not prepared to desert his General while actually busy

 in his affairs. He reflected that the great object (in order to the 
 peace and reconciliation he hoped for) was to serve, and keep on 
 a good understanding with, both parties. He would discharge 
 this commission, and then follow Aimee and her brother, as he 
 had promised. Thus he settled with himself, while he ordered 
 his horses, and prepared for departure. 
 
 Toussaint was sufflcientlv aware that he should prosper better 
 without his shallow-miuded and unstable liide; but he meant 
 to retain him about his person, on business in his serrice, till 
 Aimee should have opportunity, in his absence, to explore her 
 own mind, and determine her course, whUe far from the voice of 
 the tempter. 
 
 "Go with your brother, Aimee," he said, " rather than remain 
 unwillingly with us. Whenever you wish it, return. You will 
 find our arms ever open to you." 
 
 And he blessed her, as did her weeping mother — the last, 
 however, not without a word of reproach. 
 
 " Oh, Aimee, why did not you tell me ? " 
 
 "Mother, I did not know myself 1 was uncertain 1 
 
 was Oh, mother ! it will not be for long. It is but a little 
 
 way : and Isaac and I shall soon write. I will tell you everything 
 about Madame Leclerc. Kiss me once more, mother ; and take 
 care of Genifrede.", 
 
 As Toussaint abruptly turned away, with a parting bow to 
 the envoy, and entered the piazza, on his way to the urgent 
 business of the day, and as the shortest escape from the many 
 eyes that were upon him, he encountered M. Pascal, who stood 
 awaiting him there. 
 
 " My friend ! " said M. Pascal, with emotion, as he looked in 
 the face of Toussaint. 
 
 "Ay, Pascal: it is bitter. Bonaparte rose up as my rival; 
 and cheerfully did I accept him for such, in the council and in 
 the field. But now he is my rival in my family. He looks 
 defiance at me through my children's eyes. It is too much. 
 God give me patience ! " 
 
 M. Pascal did not speak; for what could he say?

CHOOSING A RETREAT. 2/9 
 
 who, out of tlie circle of immediate friends, might next join the 
 French for the sake of peace ; and for the sake of peace, perhaps, 
 deliver up the persons of the Ourertures, with their wounded 
 friend, Dessaliues, and the brave young officers who formed the 
 guard of the household. Ohristophe's letters had already proved 
 to Toussaint and his secretary, that no reliance was to be placed 
 on the honour of the French, in their dealings with negroes. 
 Cajolery in speech, covering plots against their persons, appeared 
 to be considered the conduct appropriate to business with blacks, 
 who had no concern, it seemed, with the usages of war, as 
 established among whites. La Plume had fallen by bribery; 
 Olerveaux by cajolery ; and both means had been attempted with 
 Ohristophe. The troops were assailed on the side of their best 
 affections. They were told that Leolerc came to do honour to 
 L'Ouverture — ^to thank him for his government of the island 
 during the troubles of France, and to convey to him the appro- 
 bation of the First Consul, in papers enclosed in a golden box. 
 It is probable that, if they had not heard from Toussaint's own 
 lips of the establishment of slavery in the other French colonies, 
 the authorisation of the Slave-trade, and the threat to do what 
 was convenient with St. Domingo — aU the negroes would have 
 made the French welcome, as Clerveaux had done. As it was, 
 large numbers unquestionably remained faithful to their liberties 
 and their chief^ — enough, as Toussaint never doubted, to secure 
 their liberties at last : but how many, and after how long and 
 arduous a struggle, it remained for time to show. 
 
 Many houses had been offered as a retreat for the household 
 of the Oommauder-in-chief. The one chosen this day was his 
 friend Raymond's cacao-plantation, Le ZSphyr, in the Momes du 
 Chaos — among the mountaias which retired above the right bank 
 of the Artibouite. It was a spacious mansion, sheltered from 
 storms, but enjoying a pleasant mountain air — the most whole- 
 some that could be found, if the retreat should continue through 
 the hot season. It was surrounded with never-failing springs of 
 pure water. There were kids on all the hills, and cattle in every 
 valley round. Grain and fruits were in the fields and gardens : 
 and it was thought that one well-guarded post, at a pass below 
 the Plateaux de la Ravine, would render the place inaccessible to 
 the enemy. To the satisfaction of Raymond and his daughter, 
 and the delight of Euphrosyne, this, their beloved summer 
 mansion, was fixed on for the abode of the whole party, pro- 
 vided Toussaint should find, on examination, that it would 
 answer his purposes as well as was now supposed. 
 
 Such was the plan settled presently after the deputation had 
 left the gates — settled among the few confidential friends, whose 
 tastes, as well as interests, Toussaint chose to consult. Madame 
 Dessalines was among these ; and one of the most eager to be

 gone. She engaged to remove her husband safely to a place where 
 is recovery must proceed better than among the agitations of 
 Pongaudin. By one of these agitations her desire to go had been 
 much quickened. Before the departure of the deputation, she 
 had chanced to meet M. Papalier in one of the corridors, equipped 
 for his journey. She could not avoid passing him ; and he had 
 greeted her with a significant " An revoir, Therese." Fervently 
 she prayed that she might never meet him again ; and anxious 
 was she to be gone to a place where he could not come. 
 
 Before noon, li'Ouverture, with Placide riding by his side, and 
 followed by some officers, who were themselves followed by a 
 few soldiers, was among the heights which commanded the plain 
 of the Artibonite on one side, and on the other the valleys 
 which lay between their party and the Gros Morue. They had 
 visited Le Zephyr, and were now about to examine the pass 
 where their post was to be established. 
 
 " This heat, Placide," said his father, as the sua beat down 
 upon their heads, " is it not too much for you ? Perhaps you 
 
 had better But I beg your pardon," he added, smiling ; " I 
 
 had forgotten that you are no longer my growing boy, Placide, 
 whom 1 must take care of. I beg your pardon, Placide ; but it 
 is so new to me to have a manly son beside me ! " 
 
 And he looked at him with eyes of pride. 
 
 Placide told how often at Paris he had longed to bask in such 
 a sunshine as this, tempered by the fragrant breezes from the 
 mountain-side. He was transported now to hear the blows of 
 the axe in the woods, and the shock of the falling trunks, as the 
 hewers of the logwood and the mahogany trees were at their 
 hidden work. He was charmed with the songs of the cultivators 
 which rose from the hot plain beloWi where they were preparing 
 the furrows for the indigo-sowing. He greeted every housewife 
 who, vrith her children about her, was on her knees by the moun- 
 tain-stream, washing linen, and splashing her little ones in sport. 
 All these native sights and sounds, so unlike Paris, exhilarated 
 Placide in the highest degree He was willing to brave either 
 heats or hurricanes on the mountains, for the sake of thus feel- 
 ing himself once more in his tropical home. 
 
 '' One would think it a time of peace," said he, " with the 
 wood-cutters and cultivators all about us. Where wiU be the 
 first cropping from those indigo-fields ? And, if that is saved, 
 where wifl. be the second! " 
 
 " Of that last question, ask me again when we are alone," 
 replied his father. " As for the rest, it is by no vrill of mine 
 that our people are to be called off from their wood-cutting and 
 their tUlage. To the last moment, you see, I encourage the 
 pursuits of peace. But, if you could see closely these men in 
 the forest and the fields, you would find that, as formerly, they

 have the cutlass at their belt, and the rifle slung across their 
 shoulders. They are my most trusty soldiery." 
 
 "Because they love you best, and owe most to you. What 
 has Vincent discovered below there— far ofE P Have you your 
 glass, father p " 
 
 " The deputation, perhaps,'' said Toussaint. 
 
 " Yes : there they are ! They have crossed the Trois Rivieres, 
 and they are creeping up towards Plaisance. What a mere 
 handful the party looks at this distance ! What mere insects to 
 be about to piill the thunder down upon so many heads ! What 
 an atom of space they cover ! Tet Vincent's heart is on that 
 little spot, I believe. Is it not so, father P " 
 
 " Tes ! unless some of it is, as I fear, with the fleet beyond tlie 
 ridge." 
 
 " He will be missing, some day soon, then." 
 
 " For his own sake and AimSe's, I trust not. This step of 
 hers has disconcerted me : but no harm can be done by detaining 
 Vincent in honour near me, till the turn of events may decide 
 his inclinations in favour of Aimee's father, and of his own race. 
 Detained he must be, for the present, in dishonour, if not in 
 honour : for he knows too much of my afEairs to be allowed to 
 see Leclero. If Aim6e returns to us, or if we gain a battle, 
 Vincent will be ours without compulsion. Meantime, I keep 
 him always employed beside^me." 
 
 " This is the place for our post, surely," said Placide. " See 
 how the rocks are rising on either hand above this level ! No 
 one could pass here whom we choose to obstruct." 
 
 " Tes : this is the spot ; these are the Plateaux," replied his 
 father, awaiting the officers and soldiers — the latter being pre- 
 pared with tools, to mark out and begin their work. 
 
 While the consultations and measurements were going on, 
 Placide's eye was caught by the motion of a young fawn in the 
 high grass of a lawny slope, on one side of the valley. He 
 snatched the loaded rifle which one of the soldiers had exchanged 
 for a spade and fired. The passion for sport was instantly roused 
 by the act. Kids were seen here and there on the rocks. Marks 
 were not wanting : and first Vincent, and then one and another, 
 followed Placide's example ; and there were several shots at the 
 same instant, whose echoes reverberated to the delighted ear of 
 Placide, who was sorry when the last had died away among the 
 mountain-tops. 
 
 " Tour first and last sport for to-day," observed Toussaint. 
 " Tou have given the game a sufficient alarm for the pre- 
 sent." 
 
 " We must find our game, as we have shot it," exclaimed 
 Vincent. " My kid is not far off." 
 
 " After it, then ! Tou will find me under the large cotton-tree

 yonder. The heat is too great here, Placide, between these walls 
 of rook." 
 
 Every man of the party was off in pursuit of his game, except 
 Placide, who remained to ask his father, now they were alone, 
 what was to happen at the season of the second indigo-cutting. 
 They threw themselves down beneath the cotton-tree, which with 
 its own broad shades, deepened by the masses of creepers which 
 twined and clustered about it, and weighed it down on every 
 side, afforded as complete a shelter from the shower of sun-rays 
 as any artificial roof could have done. 
 
 " The second indigo-cutting is in August, you know," said 
 Toussaint. " August will decide our freedom, if it is not decided 
 before. August is the season when Nature comes in as our ally 
 — comes in with her army of horrors, which we should not have 
 the heart to invoke, but which vriU arrive, with or without our 
 will ; and which it will be the fault of the French themselves if 
 they brave." 
 
 " Foul airs and pestUence, you mean ! " said Placide. 
 
 " I mean foul airs and pestUence. All our plans, my son^ 
 (it is a comfort to make a counsellor of my own son ! ) — all the 
 plans of my generals and myself are directed to provide for our 
 defence till August, certain that then the French will be occu- 
 pied in grappling with a deadlier foe than even men fighting for 
 their liberties." 
 
 " Till August ! " repeated Placide. " Nearly six months ! I 
 
 scarcely think the French could hold their footing so long, if 
 
 but that " 
 
 " If what ? Except for what ? " 
 
 " If it were not for the tremendous reinforcements which I 
 fear will be sent." 
 
 " I thought so," said his father. 
 
 " All France is eager to come," continued Placide. " The 
 thousands who are here (about twelve thousand, I fancy; but 
 they did what they could to prevent our knowing the numbers 
 exactly) — the thousands who are here are looked upon with 
 envy by those who are left behind. The jealou^ was incredible 
 — the clamour to gain appointments to the St. Domingo ex- 
 pedition." 
 
 " To be appointed to pestilence in the hospitals, and a grave 
 in the sands ! " exclaimed Toussaint. " It is strange ! French- 
 men enough have died here, in seasons of trouble, to convince all 
 France that only in times of peace, leisure, stillness, and choice 
 of residence, have Europeans a fair chance of life here, for 
 a single year. It is strange that they do not foresee their own 
 death-angels clustering on our shores." 
 
 " The delusion is so strong," said Placide, '' that I verily 
 believe that if these twelve thousand were all dead to-day, twenty

 thousand more would be ready to come to-morrow. If every 
 officer was buried here, the choicest commanders there would 
 press forward over their graves. If even the Leelercs should 
 perish, I believe that other relatives of the First Consul, and 
 perhaps some other of his sisters, would kneel to him, as these 
 have done, to implore him to appoint them to the new expedition 
 to St. Domingo." 
 
 " The madness of numbers is never without an open cause,'' 
 said Toussaint. '' What is the cause here ? " 
 
 " Clear and plain enough. The representations of the emi- 
 grants coming in aid of the secret wishes of Bonaparte, have, 
 under his encouragement, turned the heads of his family, his 
 court, and after them, of his people." 
 
 " The emigrants sigh for their country (and it is a country to 
 sigh after), and they look back on their estates and their power, 
 I suppose ; while the interval of ten years dims in their memories 
 all inconveniences from the climate, and from the degradation of 
 their order." 
 
 " They appear to forget that any form of evil but Oge and 
 you, father, ever entered their paradise. They say that, but 
 for you, they might have been all this while in paradise. They 
 have boasted of its wealth and its pleasures, till there is not a 
 lady in the court of France who does not long to come and 
 dwell in palaces of perfumed woods, marbles, and gold and 
 silver. Tliey dream of passing the day in breezy shades, 
 and of sipping the nectar of tropical fruits, from hour to 
 hour. They think a good deal, too, of the plate and wines, and 
 equipages, and trains of attendants, of which they have heard 
 so much; and at the same time, of martial glory and laurel 
 crowns." 
 
 " So these are the ideas with which they have come to 
 languish on Tortuga, and be buried in its sands I These 
 emigrants have much to answer for." 
 
 " So Isaac and I perpetually told them ; but they would not 
 listen to anything said by an Ouverture. JTor could we wonder 
 at this, when persons of evei-y colour were given to the same 
 boastings; so that Isaac and I found ourselves tempted into a 
 like strain upon occasion." 
 
 " It appears as if the old days had returned," said Toussaint ; 
 " the days of Columbus and his crews. We are as the unhappy 
 Indians to the rapacity of Europe. No wonder, if mulattoes and 
 blacks speak of the colony as if it were the old Hayti." 
 
 "They do, from Lanville, the coffee-planter, to our Mars 
 Plaisir. Mars Plaisir has brought orders for I do not know how 
 many parrots ; and for pearls, and perfumes, and spices, aud 
 variegated woods." 
 
 " Is it possible 'i " said Toussaint, smiling. " Does he really

 believe his own stories ? If so, that accounts for his staying 
 with you, instead of going with Isaac ; which I wondered at. 
 I thought he could not have condescended to ns, after having 
 lived in France." 
 
 "He condescends to be wherever he finds most scope for 
 boasting. On Tortuga, or among the ashes of Cap, he can boast 
 no more. With us he can extol France, as there he extolled St. 
 Domingo. If August brings the destruction we look for, 
 the poor fellow ought to die of remorse ; but he has not head 
 enough to suffer for the past. Tou can hold out till August, 
 father ? " 
 
 "If Maurepas joins us here with his force, I have no doubt of 
 holding out till August. In these momes, as many as will not 
 yield might resist for life ; but my own forces, aided by those of 
 Maurepas, may effectually keep off the grasp of the French from 
 all places but those in which they are acj;ually quartered. A few 
 actions may be needful, — morally needful, — to show them that 
 the blacks can fight. If this lesson wiU not suffice, August, alas ! 
 will exterminate the foe. What do I see stirring among the 
 ferns there p Is it more game ? " 
 
 Placide started up. 
 
 " Too near us for game," he whispered ; and then added 
 aloud, " Shall we carry home another deer ? Shall I fire ? " 
 
 At these words, some good French was heard out of the tall, 
 tree-like ferns, — voices of men intreating that no one would fire ; 
 and two Frenchman presently appeared, an army and a navy 
 officer. 
 
 " How came you here, gentlemen ? Are you residents in the 
 colony ? " 
 
 " If we had been, we should not have lost ourselves, as you 
 perceive we have done. We are sent by the Captain-General to 
 parley, as a last hope of avoiding the collision which the Captain- 
 General deprecates. Here are our credentials, by which you will 
 discover our names, — Lievitenant Martin," pointing to his com- 
 panion, "and Captain Sabes," bowing for himself. 
 
 " It is too late for negotiation, gentlemen," said L'Ouverture, 
 " as the news from the south will already have informed the 
 Captain- General. I regret the accident of your having lost 
 your way, as it will deprive you for a time of your liberty. 
 1 ou must be aware that, voluntarily or involuntarily, you have 
 fulfilled the office of spies; and for the present, therefore, I 
 cannot part with yon. Placide, summon our attendants, and, 
 with them, escort these gentlemen to Le Zephyr. I shall soon 
 join you there, and hear anything that your charge may have to 
 say." 
 
 I'he officers protested, but in vain. 
 
 "It is too late, gentlemen. Tou may thank your own

 commanders for compelling me to run no more risks — for having 
 made trust in a French officer's honour a crime to my own 
 people. Ton may have heard and seen so much that I am com- 
 pelled to hold you prisoners. As I have no proof, however, that 
 you are spies, your lives are safe." 
 
 In answer to Placide's shout — the well-known mountain-cry 
 which he was delighted to revive — their followers appeared ou 
 all sides, some bringing in their game, some empty-handed. 
 The French officers saw that escape was impossible. Neither 
 Imd they any thought, but for a passing moment, of fighting 
 for their liberty. The Ouvertures were completely armed ; and 
 there never was an occasion when a man would lightly engage, 
 hand-to-hand, with Toussaint or his son. 
 
 Half the collected party, including Vincent, accompanied 
 Toussaint to Pongaudin. The other half escorted Placide and 
 his prisoners up the morne to Le Zephyr ; these carried all the 
 game for a present provision. 
 
 Placide observed an interchange of glances between his pri- 
 soners as they passed the spades, pick-axes, and fresh-dug earth 
 in the plateaux. He had little idea how that glance was con- 
 nected with the romancing he had just been describing ; nor how 
 much of insult and weary suffering it boded to his father. 
 
 CHAPTER XXXI. 
 
 BBTBEAT. 
 
 Pongaudin was indeed no longer safe. Immediately ou the 
 return of Coasson to the fleet, under the date of the 17th of 
 February, the Captain- General issued a proclamation of out- 
 lawry against L'Ouverture and Christophe, pronouncing it the 
 imperative duty of every one who had the power to seize and 
 deliver up the traitors. As Toussaint said to his family, Pon- 
 gaudin was a residence for a citizen ; outlaws must go to the 
 mountains. 
 
 To the mountain they went — not weeping and trembling, but 
 in a temper of high courage and hope. The rocks rang with 
 the military music which accompanied them. Their very horses 
 seemed to feel the spirit of their cause ; much more were the 
 humblest of the soldiery animated with the hope of success in 
 the struggle, which was now to be carried on in a mode which 
 they much preferred to keeping watch in the plains. They 
 found the pass well fortified ; they found the morne above it 
 still and undisturbed; nntrod, as it seemed now likely to

 remain, by the foot of an invader. They found the mansion at 
 Le Zephyr, spacions as it was, much enlarged by temporary 
 erections, and prepared for the abode of more than the number 
 that had come. Madame Pascal looked at her husband with a 
 sigh, when the alterations met her eye ; and Raymond himself 
 did not much relish seeing sentinels posted at all his gates. 
 Euphrosyne, however, was still quite happy. Here was her 
 beloved Le Zephyr, with its blossoming cacao-groves. Here 
 were space, freedom, and friends ; and neither convent rules nor 
 nuns. 
 
 A perpetual line of communication was established between 
 the pass and this mansion. Vincent, with a troop, was ap- 
 pointed to guard the estate and the persons on it — ^including the 
 two French prisoners. Placide was to join his father below, to 
 receive the forces which flocked to the rendezvous. Before he 
 went, he pointed out to Vincent, and his own family, a station, 
 on a steep at some distance in the rear of the house, whence they 
 might discern, with a good glass, the road which wound 
 through the plain of the Artibonite, within two miles of the 
 Plateaux, and up towards Plaisance to the north. Many and 
 wonderful were the objects seen from this lofty station ; but 
 not one of them — not even the green knolls and hollows of the 
 mome, stretched out from Le Zephyr to the pass — not the 
 brimming river of the plain — not the distant azure sea, with its 
 tufted isles — was so interesting, under present circumstances, as 
 this yellow winding road — the way of approach of either friend 
 or foe. 
 
 But for the apprehensions belonging to a state of warfare — 
 apprehensions wMch embitter life in £ul its hours to women — 
 and, possibly, more than is generally acknowledged, to men — 
 but for the speculations as to who was destined to die, who to 
 fall into the most cruel hands that ever abused their power 
 over a helpless foe (for the French of former wars were not 
 forgotten), and what was to be the lot of those who escaped 
 death and capture — but for these speculations, which were stirring 
 in every woman's heart in all that household, the way of life at 
 Le Zephyr was pleasant enough. 
 
 Even poor Genifrede appeared to revive here. She showed 
 more interest in nursing Dessalines than in any previous occu- 
 pation since the death of her lover. Therese was delighted to 
 afPord her the opportunity of feeling herself useful, and per- 
 mitted herself many a walk in the groves, many an hour of 
 relaxation in the salon, which she would have despised, but for 
 their affording an interest to Genifrede. The three were more 
 than ever drawn together by their new experience of the con. 
 duct of the French. Never was sick man more impatient to be 
 strong than Pessalines, Genifrede regarded him as the pillar oi

 the cause, on account of his uncompromising passion for ven- 
 geance; and his wife herself counted the days till he could be 
 again abroad at the head of his forces. 
 
 When not in attendance upon him, Genifrede spent the hours 
 of daylight at the station on the height. She cared neither for 
 heat nor chill while there, and forgot food and rest ; and there 
 was sometimes that in her countenance when she returned, and 
 in the tone of her prophesying about the destruction of the 
 enemy, which caused the whisper to go round that she met her 
 lover there, just under the clouds. M. Pascal — the rational, 
 sagacious M. Pascal — was of opinion that she believed this 
 herself. 
 
 On this station, and other heights which surrounded the man- 
 sion, there were other objects of interest than the visitations of 
 the clouds, and the whisperings of the breezes from the depths 
 of the woods. Por many days, a constant excitement was caused 
 by the accession of troops, Not only Toussaint's own bands 
 followed him to the post, but three thousand more, on whom he 
 could rely, were spared from his other strong posts in the moun- 
 tains. Soon after these three thousand, Christophe appeared 
 with such force as could be spared from the gaiTisons m the north. 
 The officers under Dessalines also, aware that the main struggle, 
 whenever the French would come to an engagement, must be in 
 the Plateaux, de la Ravine, drew thither, with the remnants of 
 the force which had suffered defeat in the south-west. Hither, 
 too, came Bellair, with his family, and the little garrison which 
 had fortified and held L'Etoile, till it became necessary to burn 
 and leave it. 
 
 Messenger arrived after messenger, to announce these acces- 
 sions of force; and the whole household poured out upon the 
 heights to see and hear. If it was at noon, the clear music of the 
 wind instruments floated faintly in the stiU air ; if the morn- 
 ing or evening breezes were abroad the harmony came in 
 gushes ; and the shouts of greeting and reception were plainly 
 distinguishable, and were responded to involuntarOy by all at 
 Le Zephyr but the two prisoners. Under the impulse of the 
 moment, no voice was louder or more joyous than Vincent's. 
 It now only remained for Maurepas to bring his numerous 
 troops up to the point of junction. He must presently arrive ; 
 and then, as Placide and other sanguine young soldiers 
 thought, and as Sabes and his companion began seriously to 
 fear, the negro force under L'Ouverture might defy all 
 Europe. 
 
 News, stirring news, came from all corners of the colony with 
 every fresh arrival. Deesha, especially, could tell all that had 
 been done, not only at L'Etoile, and in all the plain of Oul- 
 ^e-Sac, but within the districts of the unfaithful generals.

288 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 Clerveaux and La Plume. Her boy Juste, though too young to 
 take a practical part in the war, carried the passion and energy 
 of a man into the cause, and was Tersed in all the details of the 
 events which had taken place since the landing of the French. 
 It was a sore mortification to Juste that he was not permitted 
 to remain by his father's side at the Plateaux; but he consoled 
 himself with teaching his little brother Tobie the military 
 exercise, and with sport. Juste was as fond of sport as on the 
 day when he floated under calabashes, to catch wild ducks; 
 and this was well; for at Le Zephyr, under present circum- 
 stances, the sportsman was one of the most useful members of 
 the establishment. The air of the momes was celebrated for 
 its power of creating an appetite ; and there were many mouths 
 to feed ; so that Juste was assured, on all hands, that he had as 
 important a function to fulfil as if he had been a soldier. As it 
 was believed impossible for human foot to stray beyond the 
 mome by any other passage than that of the Plateaux, the 
 boys were permitted to be out early and late, in the woods and 
 upon the MU-sides ; and often did Genifrede and the sentries 
 hear the far-ofB shouts of the little sportsmen, or see the pufE of 
 smoke from Juste's rifle in the valley, or under the verge of the 
 groves. Many a nest of young orioles did Tobie abstract from 
 the last fork of a branch, when the peculiar note of the parent- 
 bird led him on into the midst of the thicket where these deli- 
 cate creatures hide themselves. The ring-tail dove, one of the 
 most exquisite of table luxuries, he was very successful in 
 liming ; and he would bring home a dozen in a morning. He 
 could catch turkeys vrith a noose, and young pigs to barbecue. 
 He filled baskets with plover's eggs from the high lands ; and 
 of the vidld fowl he brought in, there was no end. In the midst 
 of these feats, he engaged for far greater things in a little while 
 — when the soldier-crabs should make their annual march dovra 
 the mountains, on their way to the sea. In those days, Tobie 
 promised.the tables at Le Zephyr should groan under the pro- 
 fusion of savoury soups, which should banish for the season the 
 salt-beef and salt-fish which, meantime, formed part of the 
 daily diet of the household. 
 
 While his little brother was thus busy with smaller game. 
 Juste was indulging a higher ambition. When nothing better 
 was to be had, he could condescend to plovers and pigeons ; but 
 he liked better to bring down a dainty young heifer among the 
 herds of wild cattle, or several head of deer in a day. It was 
 his triumph to return heavily laden, and to go forth again with 
 three or four soldiers, or half-a-dozen servants (whichever could 
 best be spared), to gather up from the hill-sides the fallen game, 
 which he had covered with branches of trees, to keep off hawk 
 and vulture. It was triumph to point out to his aides spot after

 spot where the bird of prey hovered, seekinpf in vain for a space 
 on which to pounce. Amidst these triumphs, Juste was almost 
 satisfied not to be at the Plateau. 
 
 Perhaps the heaviest heart among all that household, scarflely 
 excepting Genifrede's, was Madame L'Ouverture's ; and yet 
 her chief companionship, strangely enough, was with the one 
 who carried the lightest — Buphrosyne. It was not exactly 
 settled whether Madame L'Onverture or Madame Pascal was 
 hostess; and they therefore divided the onerous duties of the 
 office ; and Buphrosyne was their handmaid, charmed to be 
 with those she loved best — charmed to be busy in new ways 
 — charmed to hear, from time to time, that she was useful. 
 She useful to the Onvertures ! It was an honour — it was an 
 exquisite pleasure. She was perhaps the first white lady in the 
 island, out of the convent, who had gathered fruits, prepared 
 vegetables, and made sweet dishes with her own hands. Morn- 
 ing after morning the three ladies spent together in domestic 
 occupations, finding that the servants, numerous as they were, 
 could not get through the whole work of hospitality to such a 
 household. Morning after morning thoy spent in the shaded 
 store-room, amidst the fragrance of fruits and spices. Here 
 the unhappy mother, the anxious wife, opened her heart to 
 the young people ; and they consoled and ministered to her as 
 daughters. 
 
 " If you are not my daughters," said she, on one of these 
 mornings, " I have none." 
 
 " But you will have : they wUl return to you," said Alra. 
 " Think of them as you did of your sons, when they were at 
 Paris — as absent for a while to gain experience, and sure to 
 return. Ton will find one of them, perhaps both, as happy on 
 your bosom hereafter as we see your Placide by his father's 
 side." 
 
 " How can you say so, Afra ? Which of my girls will ever 
 come to me again, as they did at Breda ? " 
 
 " Genifrede is better," said Buphrosyne; "better since we 
 came here — better every day : and I should wonder if she were 
 not. No one can long be sullen here." 
 
 " Do not be hard, Buphrosyne, my love — ' Siillen ' is a hard 
 word for my poor, unhappy child." 
 
 " Nay, madam ; no one can be more sorry for her than I am ; 
 as you wiU find, if you ask Father Gabriel. He will tell you 
 how angry I was with L'Ouverture, how cruel I thought him on 
 that dreadful day. But now, in these stirring times, when our 
 whole world, our little world in the middle of the sea, is to be 
 destroyed, or made free and glorious for ever, I do think it is 
 being sullen to mope on the mountain as she does, and speak to 
 nobody, care for nobody, but the Dessalines. However, I wotdd

 not say a word about it, if I were not sure that she is getting 
 better. And if she were growing worse, instead of better, there 
 is nothing that I would not do to help or console her, though I 
 must still think her sullen — not only towards her father here, 
 
 but " 
 
 And Euphrosyne crossed herself. 
 
 " It is hard," sighed Madame L'Ouverture ; " it is hard to do 
 all one ought, even in the serious hours of one's prayers. I do 
 try, with my husband's help, when he is here, and from the 
 thought of him when he is absent, to pray, as he desires, for our 
 enemies. But it generally ends (God forgive me !) in my praying 
 that Bonaparte may be held back from the work of estranging 
 our children from us." 
 
 " It can only be for a time," said Af ra, again. She could 
 think of no other consolation. 
 
 " Those who know best say that everything is for good," con- 
 tinued Margot. " If so, I wonder whether anyone can foretell 
 what can be the good of a stranger, a man that we have never 
 seen, and who has everything about him to make him great, 
 thrusting himself between us and our children, to take their 
 hearts from us. I asked L'Ouverture to foretell to me how this 
 would be explained ; and he put his hand upon my mouth, and 
 asked me to kneel down, and pray with him that we might have 
 patience to wait God's own time." 
 
 " And could you do so ? " asked Euphrosyne, with brimming 
 eyes. 
 
 " I did : but I added a prayer that Bonaparte might be moved 
 to leave us the glory and dominion which we value — the duty 
 and the hearts of our children — and that he might be contented 
 with gaining the homage of the French nation, and grasping the 
 kingdoms of Europe." 
 
 " I think God wiU hear that prayer," said Afra, cheerfully. 
 
 "And 1 am sure Bonaparte will thank you for it," said 
 Euphrosyne, " in that day when hearts will be known, and tilings 
 seen as they are." 
 
 " One might expect," sighed Madame L'Ouverture, " as one's 
 children grow up, that they should go mad for love ; but I never 
 thought of such a thing as their going mad for loyalty." 
 
 " Do you think it is for loyalty? " asked Euphrosyne. " I 
 should call Placide the most loyal of your children ; and, next to 
 him, Denis." 
 
 " They think they are loyal and patriotic, my dear. I am 
 sure I hope they will go on to think so ; for it is the best excuse 
 for them." 
 
 " I wish I had a magic glass,'' said Euphrosyne — — 
 
 '' My dear, do not wish any such thing. It is very dangerous 
 anil wicked to have anything to do with that kind of peojSe. I

 could tell you such a story of poor Moyse (and of many other 
 uiiliappy persons, too) as would show you the mischief of 
 meddling with charms, Euphrosyne." 
 
 " Do not be afraid, dear madam. I was not thinking of any 
 witchcraft ; but only wishing your children the bright mirror of 
 a clear and settled mind. I think such a mirror would show 
 them that what they take for loyalty and patriotism in their own 
 feelings and conduct, is no more loyalty and patriotism than the 
 dancing lights in our rice grounds are stars." 
 
 " What is it, my dear, do you think ? " 
 
 " I think it is weakness, remaining from their former con- 
 dition. When people are reared in humiliation, there will be 
 weakness left behind. Loyal minds must call Bonaparte's 
 conduct to L'Ouverture vulgar. Those who admire it, it seems 
 to me, either have been, or are ready to be, slaves." 
 
 " One may pity rather than blame the first," said Afra; "but 
 I do not pretend to have any patience with the last. I pity our 
 poor faithless generals here, and dear Aimee, with her mind so 
 perplexed, and her struggling heart ; but I have no toleration 
 for Leclerc and Rochambeau, and the whole train of Bonaparte's 
 worshippers in Prance." 
 
 " They are not like your husband, indeed, Afra." 
 
 " And they might all have been as right as he. They might 
 all have known as well as he, what L'Ouverture is, and what he 
 has done. Why do they not know that he might long ago have 
 been a king ? Why do they not teU one another that his throne 
 might, at this day, have been visited by ambassadors from all 
 the nations, but for his loyalty to Prance ? Why do they not see, 
 as my husband does, that it is for want of personal ambition that 
 L'Ouverture is now an outlaw in the mornes, instead of being 
 hand-in-hand, as a brother king, with George of England ? They 
 might have known whom to honour and whom to restrain, as my 
 husband does, if they had had his clearness of soul, and his love 
 of freedom." 
 
 " And because they have not," said Euphrosyne, " they are 
 lost in amazement at his devotion to a negro outlaw. Do not 
 shrink, dear madam, from those words. If they were meant in 
 anything but honour they would not be spoken before you. 
 Afra and I feel that to be the First of the Blacks is now to be 
 the greatest man in the world ; and that to be an outlaw in the 
 mornes, in the cause of a redeemed race, is a higher glory than 
 to be the conqueror of Europe. Do we not, Afra ? " 
 
 " Assuredly we do." 
 
 " They will soon learn whom they have to deal with in this 
 outlaw," said Madame. " I can tell you, my dears, that Rocham- 
 beau is drawing near us, and that there is likely soon to be a 
 battle. Hoigho ! "

292 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " Is that bad news or good ? " asked Enphrosyne. 
 
 " My husband means it for good news, my dear — at least, if 
 Maurepas arrives from the south as soon as Rochambeau from 
 the north." 
 
 " I wish Maurepas would come ! " sighed Alra. Madame 
 L'Ouverture went on — 
 
 " It has been a great mortification to my husband that there 
 has been no fair battle yet. His people — those who ai-e faithful 
 — ^have had no opportunity of showing how they feel, and what 
 they can do. The French have been busy spying, and bribing, 
 and cajoling, and pretending to negotiate ; and the one thing 
 they wiU not do is fighting. But I tell you, my dears, the battle- 
 day is coming on now. Seigho ! " 
 
 There was a pause ; after which Euphrosyne said — 
 
 " I suppose we shall hear the battle." 
 
 There was another pause, during which Madame's tears were 
 dropping into her lap. Afra wondered how General Dessalines 
 would bear to hear the firing from his chamber, so near, and he 
 imable to help. 
 
 " That puts me in mind," said Madame, rising hurriedly — 
 " how could I forget ? It was the rery reason why my husband 
 told me that Rochambeau was so near. We must prepare for 
 the wounded, my dears. They will be sent up here — as many 
 as the house wiU hold, and the tents which my husband is send- 
 ing up. We must be making lint, my dears, and preparing 
 bandages. My husband has provided simples, and Madame IDessa- 
 ^lines will tell us Oh dear ! what was I about to forget all this ! " 
 
 " Do not hurry yourself, dear madam," said Aira. " We wiU 
 take care that everything is done. With Madame Dessalines to 
 direct us, we shall be quite prepared. Do not hurry yourself so, 
 I dare say Rochambeau is not at hand at this moment." 
 
 At the very next moment, however, Euphrosyne's countenance 
 showed that she was by no means certain of this. Madame 
 L'Ouverture stood still to listen, iu her agitated walk about the 
 room. There were distant shouts heard, and a bustle and buzz 
 of voices, within and about the house, which made Euphrosyne 
 empty her lap of the shaddocks she was peeling, and run out for 
 news. 
 
 " Joy ! Joy ! " she cried, returning. " Maurepas is coming. 
 We can see his march from the station. His army has crossed 
 the river. Make haste, Afra ; Dear madam, wiU you go with 
 me to the station ? " 
 
 " No, my love," said Madame, sitting down, trembling. 
 
 " We can go as slowly as you like. There is plenty of time. 
 Ton need not hurry; and it wiU be a glorious sight." 
 
 "No, my dear. Do you young people go. But, Euphrosyne, 
 are you quite sure it is not Rochambeau ? "

VINCENT ATTRACTS NOTICE. 293 
 
 " Oh, dear, yes ! quite certain. They come from the south, and 
 have crossed the Artibonite ; they come from the very point 
 they ought to come from. It is good news, you may rely upon 
 it ; the best possible news." 
 
 " I am thankful," said Madame, in a low, sad voice. " Go, 
 my dears. Go, and see what you can." 
 
 All who could leave the house, or the post of duty — that 
 is, all but the two prisoners, the sentries, and Madame — were 
 at the station, or on their way to it. The first notice had been 
 given, it appeared, by some huntsmen who had brought iu 
 game. 
 
 '' My boys ! " said Madame Bellair, " what a pity they should 
 miss this sight ! only that, I suppose, we could not keep Juste 
 within bounds. He would be oft" to the camp before we could 
 stop him. It may be a fortunate chance that he is on the 
 northern hUls instead of the southern, to-day ; but I am sorry 
 for my little Tobie. Whereabouts are they, I wonder. Has any 
 one seen them within these two hours ? " 
 
 The hunters had parted with the boys in the valley, at sun. 
 rise, when they said they should seek fish and fowl to-day, in 
 the logwood grove and the pond above it, as there were huntera 
 enough out upon the hills. 
 
 " If they are really no farther off than that," said their 
 mother, " they may hear us, and come for their share of the sight. 
 You walk well, General Dessalines." 
 
 Dessalines declared himself well. The rumour of war was the 
 tonic he needed. Even at this distance, it had done more for him 
 than all Therese's medicines in a month. Thdrese saw that it 
 was indeed so; and that he would be at the Plateaux now 
 before the enemy. 
 
 " Look at General Vincent," whispered Madame Pascal to 
 her husband, on whose arm she was leaning, as all stood on the 
 height, anxiously gazing at the road, which wound like a yellow 
 thread across the plain, and round the base of the hUls. The 
 troops were now hidden by a hanging wood; so that Afra rested 
 her strained eyes for a moment, and happened to notice Vin- 
 cent's countenance. " Look, do look, at General Vincent ! " 
 
 Her husband shook his head, and said that was what he was 
 then thinking of. Dessalines and his wife were similarly occu- 
 pied ; and they and the Pascals communica,ted with each other 
 by glances. 
 
 " What is the matter, Vincent," asked Dessalines, outright. 
 " Here are the long-expected come at last ; and you look as 
 gloomily upon them as if they were all France." 
 
 " I am not such a man of blood as you, Dessalines. I have 
 never given up the hope of accommodation and peace. It is 
 strange, when the great men on both sides profess such a desire

 for oeace, that we must see this brea^sh made, nobody can tell 
 why." 
 
 " Why, my good fellow ! " exclaimed Dessaliues, staring into 
 his face, " surely you are talking in your sleep ! The heats put 
 you to sleep last summer, and you are not awake yet. i ou 
 know nothing that has been done since December, I do 
 believe. Come ! let me teU you, as little Tobie is not here to 
 do it." 
 
 ''Don't, love," said Therese, pressing her husband's arm. 
 " No disputes to-day, Jacques ! The times are too serious." 
 
 "At another time. General," said Vincent, "I will instruct 
 you a little in my opinions, formed when my eyes were wide 
 open in France ; which yours have never been." 
 
 " There they are ! There they come from behind the wood, 
 if we could but see them for the dust ! " exclaimed some. 
 
 " Oh, this dust ! we can see nothing ! " cried others. " Who 
 can give a guess how many they are ? " 
 
 " It is impossible," said Bellair. " Without previous know- 
 ledge, one could not tell them from droves of bullocks and 
 goats going to market at St. Marc." 
 
 " Except for their caps," said Euphrosyne. " I see a dozen or 
 two of feathers through the crowd. Do not you, Afra ? " 
 
 " Tes, but where is their music r We should hear something 
 of it here, surely." 
 
 "Tes, it is a dumb march," said Dessalines, "at present. 
 They will strike up when they have turned the shoulder of that 
 hill, no doubt. There ! now listen ! " 
 
 All listened, so that the brook, half a mile behind, made its 
 babbling heard, but there was not a breath of music." 
 
 "Is it possible that Rochambeau should be in the way.' 
 asked Therese. 
 
 " He cannot be in the way,'' said her husband, " for where I 
 stand, I command every foot of the road, up to our posts ; but 
 he may be nearer than we thought. I conclude that he is." 
 
 " Look ! See ! " cried several. " They are taking another 
 road. Where are they going ! General Dessalines, what does 
 it mean ? " 
 
 " I would thank anyone to tell me that it is not as I fear," 
 replied Dessalines. " I fear Maurepas is effecting a junction, 
 not with us, but with some one else." 
 
 " With Rochambeau ! " " Traitor ! " " The traitor Maurepas ! " 
 " His head ! " " Our all for his head ! " cried the enraged 
 gazers, as they saw Maurepas indeed diverging from the road to 
 the post, and a large body of French troops turning a reach of 
 the same road, from behind a lull. The two clouds of dust met. 
 And now there was no more silence, but sound enough from 
 below and afar. There was evidently clamour and rage among

 the troops iu the Plateaux ; and bursts of music from the army 
 of their foes, triiamphaut and insulting, swelled the breeze. 
 
 " Our all for the head of Maurepas ! " cried the group again. 
 
 "Nay," said Vincent, "leave Maurepas his head. Wholmows 
 but that peace may come out of it ? If all had done as he has 
 now done, there could be no war." 
 
 " In the same way," exclaimed Pascal, " as if all of your 
 colour thought as you do, there would then be no war, because 
 there would bo no men to fight ; but only slaves to walk quietly 
 under the yoke." 
 
 " Be as angry as you will," said Vincent, in a low voice to 
 Pascal. " No one's anger can alter the truth. It is impious and 
 vain, here as elsewhere, to oppose Bonaparte. L'Ouverture will 
 have to yield ; you know that as well as I do, M. Pascal ; and 
 those are the best friends of the blacks who help to render war 
 impossible, and who bring the affair to a close while the First 
 Consul may yet be placable." 
 
 " Has that opinion of yours been offered to your Commander, 
 Vincent ? " 
 
 " It would have been, if he had asked for it. He probably 
 knows that I had rather have seen him high in honour and 
 function under Leclerc, than an outlaw, entrenched in the 
 momes." 
 
 " Then why are you here P " 
 
 " I am here to protect those who cannot protect themselves, 
 in these rough times. I am here to guard these ladies against 
 all foes, come they whence they may, — from France, or out of 
 our own savannahs, — from earth, air, or sea. — But hark! Silence, 
 ladies ! Silence all, for a moment ! " 
 
 They listened, ready to take alarm from him, they knew not 
 why. Nothing was heard but the distant baying of hounds, — 
 the hunters coming home as it was supposed. 
 
 " Those are not St. Domingo hoimds," said Vincent, in a low 
 voice to Dessalines. 
 
 " No, indeed ! — Home, all of you ! Eun for your lives ! No 
 questions, but run ! Therese, leave me ! I command you. — If 
 this is your doing, Vincent " 
 
 " Upon my soul, it is not. I know nothing about it. — Home, 
 ladies, as fast as possible ! " 
 
 " My children ! " exclaimed Madame Bellair. " I can find 
 them, if you wiU only toU me the danger,— what is the 
 danger ? " 
 
 " Tou hear those hounds. They are Cuba bloodhounds," said 
 Dessalines. " The fear is tliat they are leading an enemy over 
 the hills." 
 
 Not a word more was necessary. Every one fled who could, 
 except Thdrese, who would not go faster than her husband's

 strength permitted him to proceed. The voice of the hounds, 
 and the tramp of horses' feet were apparently so near, before 
 they conld reach the first sentry, that both were ^lad to see 
 Pascal hurrying towards them, with two soldiers, who carried 
 Dessalines to the house, while Pascal and Therese ran for their 
 lives,— she striving to thank her companion for remembering to 
 bring this aid. 
 
 " No thanks ! " said Pascal. " General Dessalines is our great 
 man now. We cannot do without him. Here is to be a siege, — 
 a French troop has come over by some unsuspected pass ; — I do 
 not understand it." 
 
 " Have you sent to the Plateaux ? " 
 
 " Of course, instantly ; but our messengers wiU probably be 
 intercepted, though we have spared three men, to try three 
 different paths. If L'Ouverture learns our condition, it will be 
 by the firing." 
 
 Some of the sportsmen had brought in from the hiUs the 
 news of the presence of an enemy in the morne — not, apparently, 
 on their way to the plantation, but engaged in some search 
 among the hills. Others spoke tidings which would not have 
 been told for hours but for the determination of Madame Bellair 
 to set out in search of her children, whatever foe might be in the 
 path. It became necessaory to relate that it was too late to save 
 her children. They had been seen lying in a track of the wood, 
 torn in pieces by the bloodhounds, whose cry was heard now close 
 at hand. Though there was no one who would at first undertake 
 to tell the mother this, there were none who, in the end, could 
 conceal it from her. They need not have feared that their work 
 of defence would be impeded by her wailings and tears. There 
 was not a cry ; there was not a tear. Those who dared to look 
 in her face saw that the fires of vengeance were consuming all 
 that was womanish in Deesha's nature. She was the soldier to 
 whom, under Dessalines, the successful defence of Le Zephyr 
 was mainly owing. Dessalines gave the orders, and superintended 
 the arfangemeuts, which she, with a frantic courage, executed. 
 Prom that hour to the day when she and her husband expired 
 in tortures, the forces of the First Consul had no more vindictive 
 and mischievous enemy than the wife of Charles Bellair. Never 
 propitiated, and long unsubdued, Charles BeUair and his wife 
 lived henceforth in the fastnesses of the interior ; and never for 
 a day desisted from harassing the foe, and laying low every 
 Frenchman on whom a sleepless, and apparently ubiquitous 
 vengeance, could fix its gi-asp. 
 
 Deesha was not the only woman who seemed to bear a f oeman's 
 soul. Therese looked as few had seen her look before ; and, busy 
 as was her husband with his arrangements for the defence of the 
 house, he could not but smile iu the face which expressed so

 much. To her, and any companions she could find among the 
 women, was confided the charge of Sabes and Martin, who, 
 locked into a room whence they must hear the firing of their 
 comrades outside, could not be supposed likely to make a des- 
 perate attempt to escape. Therese answered for their detention, 
 if she had arms for herself and two companions. Whoever these 
 heroines might be, the prisoners were found safe, after the French 
 liad decamped. 
 
 There were doubts which, at any other time, would have 
 needed deliberation. It was a doubt, for a moment, whether to 
 imprison Vincent, whose good faith was now extremely ques- 
 tionable : but there was no one to guard him ; and his surprise 
 and concern were evidently so real, and his activity was so great 
 in preparing for defence, that there seemed nothing for it but 
 trusting him to protect the women who were under his charge. 
 Dessalines, however, kept his eye upon him, and his piece in 
 readiness to shoot him down, on the first evidence of treachery. 
 
 Another doubt was as to the foe they had to contend against. 
 How they got into the mome, and why such an approach was 
 made to an object so important as securing a party of hostages 
 like these ; whether, if Vincent had nothing to do with it, the 
 spies had ; and whether, therefore, more attacks might not be 
 looked for, were questions which passed through many minds, 
 but to which no consideration could now be given. Here were 
 the foe ; and they must be kept ofB. 
 
 The struggle was short and sharp. Small as was the force 
 without, it far outnumbered that of the fighting men in what 
 had been supposed the secure retreat of Le Zephyr ; and there 
 is no saying but that the ladies might have found themselves 
 at length on Tortuga, and in the presence of Bonaparte's sister, 
 if the firing had not reached the watchful ear of L'Ouverture at 
 the Plateaux, on the way to which aU the three messengers had 
 been captured. Toussaint arrived with a troop, in time to 
 deliver his household. After his first onset, the enemy retreated; 
 at first carrying away some prisoners, but dropping them on 
 their road, one after another, as they were more and more hardly 
 pressed by L'Ouverture, till the few survivors were glad to 
 escape as they could, by the way they came. 
 
 Toussaint returned, his soldiers bi-inging in the mangled 
 bodies of the two boys. When he inquired what loss had been 
 sustained, he found that three, besides the children, were killed ; 
 and that Viacent was the only prisoner, besides the three mes- 
 sengers turned back in the morne. 
 
 " Never was there a more willing prisoner, in my opinion,'' 
 observed Pascal. 
 
 " He carries away a mark from us, thank Heaven ! " said 
 Dessalines. " Madame Bellair shot him."

298 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 It was BO. Deesha saw Vincent join the French, and go off 
 with thera, on the arrival of L'Ouverture ; and, partly through 
 revenge, but not without a thought of the disclosures it was in 
 his power to make, she strove to silence him for ever. She only 
 reached a limb, however, and sent him away, as DessaJines said, 
 bearing a mark from Le Zephyr. 
 
 One of the French troop, made prisoner, was as communicative 
 as could have been desired — as much so as Vincent would pro- 
 bably be on the other side. He declared that the attack on Le 
 Zephyr was a mere accident : that his company had entered the 
 mome, led by the bloodhounds in pursuit of some negroes, from 
 whom they wanted certain information for Rochambeau, re- 
 specting the localities ; that they had thus become acquainted 
 with the almost impracticable pass by which they had entered ; 
 that, when the hounds had destroyed the children, and proved 
 that there were inhabitants in the morne, the situation of Le 
 Zephyr had been discovered, and afterwards the rank of its 
 inhabitants ; that the temptation of carrying ofE these hostages 
 to Bochambeau had been too strong to be resisted ; and hence 
 the attack. 
 
 " We shall have to remove," the ladies said to each other, 
 " now that our retreat is known." 
 
 " ShaU we have to remove P " asked Eiiphrosyne, whose love 
 of the place could not be quenched, even by the blood upon its 
 threshold. " I am not afraid to stay, if any one else wiU." 
 
 " How can you be so rash, Euphrosyne P " asked Afra. 
 
 " I wonld not be rash, Euphrosyne replied ; but we know 
 now how these people came into the morne, and L'Ouverture 
 will guard the pass. And remember, Afra, we have beaten 
 them ; and they wiU take care how they attack us another time. 
 Remember, we have beaten them." 
 
 " We have beaten- them," said Dessalines, laughing. " And 
 what did you do to beat off the French, my little lady P " 
 
 " I watched the prisoners througlr the keyhole ; and if they 
 had made the least attempt to set the house on fire " 
 
 "Tou would have put it out with your tears — hey. Made- 
 moiselle Euphrosyne ? " 
 
 " Ask Madame, your lady, what she would have done in such 
 a case : she stood beside me. But does L'Ouverture say we 
 must remove p " 
 
 " L'Ouverture thinks," said Toussaint, who heard her ques- 
 tion, " that this is stiU the safest place for the brave women who 
 keep up his heart by their cheerful faces. He is ashamed that 
 they have been negligently guarded. It shall not happen again." 
 
 He was just departing for the Plateaux. As he went out he 
 said to his wife, while he east a look of tender compassion upon 
 Madame Bellair —

deesha's hate. 299 
 
 " I shall teU diaries that ynii will cherish Deesha. It is well 
 that we can let her remain here, beside the graves of her children. 
 Bury them with honour, Margot." 
 
 CHAPTER XXXII. 
 
 ATJGXrST FAB, OFF. 
 
 In time of peace, and if her children had perished by any 
 other mode, it might have been a consolation to Deesha to dwell 
 for a time beside their graves. As it was, the deep bark of the 
 murderous dogs filled her ear perpetually, and their fangs 
 seemed to tear her heart. Her misery in the quiet mansion of 
 the mornes was unendurable ; and the very day after the 
 funeral she departed, with her husband, to a place where no 
 woman's eye could mark her maternal anguish — where no 
 semblance of a home kept alive the sense of desolation. She 
 retired, with her husband and his troop, to a fastness higher up 
 in the Morne-du- Chaos, whence they kept watch over the 
 regular entrenchments below, out off supplies of provisions from 
 the French, harassed aU their marches, and waged a special 
 war against the bloodhounds — the negro's most dreaded foe. 
 More, however, were perpetually brought over from Cuba, and 
 regularly trained, by means too barbarous for detail, to make 
 negroes their prey. From the hour when Deesha first heard the 
 cry of a bloodhound, more than the barbarism of her native 
 Congo took possession of hei'. Never more was she seen sewing 
 under the shade of the tamarind tree. Never more did she spread 
 the table, for husband or guests, within a house. Never more was 
 her voice heard singing, gaily or plaintively, the songs that she 
 had gathered from the palm groves of Africa, or the vineyards of 
 Fi-ance, or from the flowery fields of a mother's hopes. Hence- 
 forth she carried the rifle, and ate her meal in stern silence, in 
 the cave of the rock. When she laughed, it was as her shot 
 went straight to her victim's heart. Wlien she spoke, it was of 
 the manceuvres of her mountain war; and the only time that 
 she was ever seen to shed tears was when a rumour of a ti'uce 
 reached the pinnacle on which she dwelt. Though assured that 
 any truce could be only, as every negro knew, a truce till 
 August, the mere semblance of accommodation with the foe 
 forced tears of vexation from eyes which were for ever after dry. 
 If she felt a gleam of satisfaction before leaving Le Zephyr, it 
 was at the singular accident by which Juste, always so bent 
 upon being a soldier, shared the honours of a military funeral. 
 Juste and Tobie were buried with the soldiers who had fallen

300 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 in the defence of the house ; and to the father, who followed the 
 coffins, and the mother, who hid herself in the thicket, there was 
 something like pleasure in the roll of the drum, and the measure 
 of the dead march, and the warlike tone of the shrill dirge 
 which was sung round the open graves, and the discharge of 
 firearms over them — a satisfaction like that of fulfilling the 
 last wish of their boy. This done, and the graves fenced and 
 planted, the childless pair departed, wishing, perhaps, in their 
 own hearts, that they could weep their misfortune like those 
 whom they left behind. 
 
 For some time forward from that day there was no more 
 cause for weeping at Le Zephyr. The season had come for the 
 blacks to show what they could do. In the hope, as he said, of 
 hastening on the peace, Vincent told all that he knew of the 
 plans and resources of the outlawed chiefs ; and, in consequence, 
 the French at length proceeded to vigorous action, believing 
 that if they could force the post at the Plateaux, they could 'so 
 impoverish and disable the negro leaders as to compel them to 
 become mere banditti, who might be kept in check by guarding 
 the mountain-passes. The French force was, therefore, brought 
 up again and again to the attack, and always in vain. The ill 
 success of the invaders was, no doubt, partly owing to the dis- 
 tress which overtook their soldiery whenever they had been a 
 few days absent from their camp and their ships. Whichever 
 way they turned, and however sudden the changes of their 
 mai'ch, they found the country laid waste — the houses unroofed, 
 the cattle driven away, the fields burned or inundated, and 
 nothing but a desert under their feet, and flames on the 
 horizon, while the sun of the tropic grew daily hotter overhead. 
 These were disadvantages ; but the French had greatly the 
 superiority in numbers, in experience, and in supplies of ammu- 
 nition. Yet, for many weeks, they failed in all their attempts. 
 They left their dead before the entrance of the Plateaux, or 
 heaped up in the neighbouring fields, or strewed along the 
 mountain-paths, now to the number of seven hundred, now 
 twelve, and now fifteen hundred ; while the negroes numbered 
 their losses by tens or scores. The first combined attack, when 
 Maurepas, with his army, joined Rochambeau, and two other 
 divisions mot them from different points, was decisively disas- 
 trous i and even Vincent began to doubt whether the day of 
 peace, the day of chastisement of L'Ouverture's romance, was 
 so near as he had supx)osed. 
 
 The last time that the French dared the blacks to come forth 
 from their entrenchments, and fight on the plain afforded the 
 most triumphant result to the negroes. So tremendous was the 
 havoc among the French — while the blacks charged without in- 
 termission, rolling on their force fi-om their entrenchments,

NO AMMUNITION. 30I 
 
 each advancing line throwing itself upon the ground imme- 
 diately after the charge, while those beliind passed over their 
 bodies, enabling them to rise and retreat in order to rush for- 
 ward again in their turn — that the troops of the Rhine and the 
 Alps were seized with a panic, and spread a rumour that there 
 was sorcery among the blacks, by which they were made invul- 
 nerable. It was scarcely possible, too, to believe in the infe- 
 riority of their numbers, so interminable seemed the succession 
 of foes that presented a fresh front. Rochambeau saw that, if 
 not ordered to retreat, his troops would fly ; and whether it was 
 a retreat or a flight at last, nobody could afterwards determine. 
 They left fifteen hundred dead on the field, and made no pause 
 till they reached Plaisance. 
 
 From this time, the French generals resolved against more 
 fighting, till reinforcements arrived from France. New hopes 
 inspired the blacks — all of them, at least, who did not, like 
 L'Ouverture and Ohristophe, anticipate another inundation of 
 the foe from the sea. Placide, who was foremost in every fight, 
 was confident that the struggle was nearly over, and rode up to 
 Le Zephyr occasionally with tidings which spread hope and joy 
 among the household, and not only made his mother proud, but 
 lightened her heart. 
 
 He told, at length, that the French, not relishing the offen- 
 sive war begun by Ohristophe, had blockaded his father in the 
 Plateaux. He treated this blockade as a mere farce — as a mode 
 of warfare which would damage the French irreparably as the 
 heats came on, while it could not injure the blacks, acquainted 
 as they were with the passes of the country. 
 
 Placide would have been right, if only one single circumstance 
 had been otherwise than as it was. L'Ouverture had nothing 
 to fear from a blockade in regard to provisions. He had adhe- 
 rents above, among the heights, who could supply his forces 
 with food for themselves and fodder for their horses inex- 
 haustibly. Every ravine in their rear yielded water. They 
 had arms enough ; and in their climate, and with the summer 
 coming on, the clothing of the troops was a matter of small 
 concern. But their ammunition was running short. Every, 
 thing was endeavoured, and timely, to remedy this ; but there 
 was no effectual remedy. Many a perilous march over the 
 heights, and descent upon the shore, did one and another troop 
 attempt — many a seizure of French supplies did they actually 
 effect— many a trip did Paul, and others who had boats, make 
 to one and another place, where it was hoped that powder and 
 ball might be obtained ; but no sufficient supply could be got. 
 The foe were not slow in discovering this, and in deriving 
 courage from their discovery. From the moment that they 
 found themselves assailed with flights of arrows from the

 heights, and that their men were wounded, not always with 
 ball, or even shot, but with buttons, nails, and other bits of old 
 metal — with anything rather than lead — they kept a closer 
 watch along the coast and the roads, that no little boat, no cart 
 or pack-horse, might escape capture. Towards the end of April 
 the difficulty became so pressing, that L'Onverture found him- 
 self compelled to give up his plan of defensive war, with all its 
 advantages, and risk much to obtain the indispensable means 
 of carrying on the struggle. 
 
 It was with this view that he mustered his force, gave out 
 nearly the last remains of his ammunition, burst victoriously 
 through the blockading troops, routed them, and advanced to 
 attack the Trench lines posted at Plaisance. Behind him he 
 left few but his wounded, commanded by Dessalines, who was 
 yet hardly sufficiently recovered to undertake a more arduous 
 service. Before him were the troops under Maurepas, whom he 
 had always believed he could recall with a word, if he could but 
 meet them face to face. Others probably believed so too ; for 
 these troops had, on every occasion, been kept back, and so sur- 
 rounded, as that no one from their old haunts and their old com- 
 panions could reach them. Now, however, the French force was 
 so reduced by the many defeats they had undergone, that it was 
 probable they would be obliged to put faith in the renegade 
 division, if attacked ; and L'Ouverture was not without hopes 
 of striking a decisive blow by recalling the negroes in the French 
 lines to their allegiance to himself. 
 
 Everything answered to his anticipations. When he advanced 
 to the attack, he found the troops of Maurepas posted in the 
 front, to weaken the resolution of their former comrades, or re- 
 ceive their first fire. His heart bounded at the sight ; and all 
 his resentment against them as renegades melted into compassion 
 for the weakness of those who had been reared in terror and ser- 
 vility. He rushed forward, plachig himself, without a thought 
 of fear, between the two armies, and extended his arms towards 
 the black lines of the enemy, shouting to them — 
 
 " My soldiers, will you kill your general ? WiU you kill your 
 father, your comrades, your brothers ? " 
 
 In an instant every black was on his knees. It was a critical 
 moment for the French. They rushed on, drowning the single 
 voice on which their destruction seemed to hang, threw the 
 kneeling soldiers on their faces, strode over their prostrate 
 bodies, and nearly effected their object of closing round L'Ouver. 
 ture, and capturing him. His danger was imminent. The 
 struggle was desperate ; — but his soldiers saved him. The battle 
 was fierce and long, but again and again turning in his favour, 
 tiU all seemed secure. He was forcing the enemy from their 
 lines, and giving out the inspiring negro cry of victory, when a

A TRUCE PROPOSED. 3O3 
 
 new force marched up against him, stopped the retreat of the 
 French, and finally repulsed the blacks — exhausted as they were, 
 and unable to cope with a fresh foe. In the most critical mo- 
 ment, four thousand troops, fresh from the ships had arrived 
 to convert the defeat of the French into a victory; and they 
 brought into the battle more than their own strength in the 
 news that reinforcements from France were pouring in upon 
 every point of the coast. 
 
 The news reached L'Ouverture, and completed the discourage- 
 ment of his little army. It decided him at once in what direc- 
 tion to retreat. It was useless to return to the Plateaux, as the 
 force there was more than proportioned to the supply of ammu- 
 nition. This fresh descent of the French upon the coast would 
 have the effect of dispersing the small bodies of black troops in 
 the north. A rendezvous was necessary, in order to make the most 
 both of the men and stores. He proceeded to post his troops at 
 Le Dondon, and Marmalade, sending orders to Christophe to 
 meet him there. There they might possibly be usefully em- 
 ployed in cutting off access to the French army at Plaisauce, and 
 at the same time supplying their own wants, while deliberating 
 on what plan to carry on the struggle, under the new circum- 
 stances, till August ; for, whatever treachery and defection 
 might have to be encountered elsewhere, there was never a 
 moment's doubt that Nature would prove a faithful ally, when 
 lier appointed season came. 
 
 CHAPTER XXXIII. 
 
 CONFLICTINS. 
 
 " "What to do ! " said L'Ouverture to Christophe, as they entered 
 his apartment at Le Dondon. " What to do ? Everything, this 
 year and for the future, may depend on what we decide on for 
 our next step. And we must decide before we leave this room, 
 say your thoughts, Henri." 
 
 " I am for a truce." 
 
 " I am for a retreat in the mountains. Now for our reasons ! 
 Why do you desire a truce P " 
 
 " Because I see that Leclero so earaestly wishes it, that I am 
 confident we may make good terms, for the interval of waiting 
 till we recover altogether our power, our territory, and our 
 people. Leclerc wiU revoke our outlawry. That done, you will 
 be the virtual ruler of our people till August ; after which no 
 foes wiE be left upon onr soil. What have you to say against 
 this?"

304 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " That it is yielding, unnecessarily and fatally, to the invaders. 
 Where are our censures of Clerreaux and Manrepas, if we, too, 
 yield to Leclerc, and make terms with him P " 
 
 " Every one of our people will understand the difPerence in 
 the cases. Every one of them sees the difference between falling' 
 at the feet of Leclerc, like Olerveaux ; or joining him on the very 
 field on which you were about to oppose him, like Maurepas ; 
 and making a truce, for a short interval, when you are almost 
 destitute of ammunition, and the enemy so exhausted with the 
 heats as to decline coming into the field; while, at the same 
 time, fresh troops are pouring in upon the coast, in such numbers 
 as to prevent your regaining your independence by remaining in 
 arms. If every man of the negroes has not wit enough to under- 
 stand this for himself, who is better able than you to inform 
 them of whatsoever yon desire them to know? Be assured, 
 Toussaint, powerful as your influence is this day among om- 
 people, it wiE be more so when you are no longer an outlaw. It 
 is worth a large sacrifice of our feelings to have our outlawry 
 revoked." 
 
 " Have you more reasons to give for accepting a truce ; or, as 
 the French understand it, a peace ? " 
 
 " Let me first hear your reasons for a retreat in the moun- 
 tains." 
 
 " A retreat in the mountains is the more honest proceeding of 
 the two, Henri. If we make terms with the French, it will be 
 knowing that that which goes by the name of peace is no more 
 than a truce till August." 
 
 " And will not they know that as well as we ? Is it necessary 
 to tell the whites, at this day, that they are liable to the fever 
 in the heats, and that any army, however glorious in its strength 
 previously, becomes a skeleton at that season ? This is a matter 
 that is perfectly understood, by all the parties." 
 
 " We must look forward, Henri, to the days to come, when 
 August itself is past. The influence of myself or my successor 
 win be injured by my having, even apparently, yielded to the 
 invaders. My power over our people's minds will be immea- 
 surably greater, if I shall have consistently refused to tolerate 
 the foe, from the moment of their first hostile act to the end of 
 the struggle. Am I not right ? " 
 
 " That character of consistency wiU be purchased at a price too 
 dear ; — at the cost of your characteristic of mercy, Toussaint — 
 of reverence for human life. Tou will be ranked with Dessalines, 
 if you keep up, for four months, the disturbance and devastation 
 of war, when every one knows that your end will be as certainly 
 gained after these four months have been spent in peace. What 
 a grief it would be to see you changed in all eyes from the adored 
 L'Ouverture to Toussaint the bandit ! Pardon my freedom."

A DISAGREEMENT. 3OS 
 
 " I rpqnired it of yon, my friend; so do not speak of pardon. 
 We are agreed that the moral influence of my conduct ia the 
 main consideration, as the destruction of the French army is 
 certain, sooner or later — our independence secure, if we so wiU 
 it-. If we remain in the mountains, cutting off in detail the 
 grasp which France shall attempt to lay on any part of our 
 territory or our system ; training our people, meantime, for another 
 campaign, if France should attempt another; replenishing 
 gradually our stores with perpetual small captures from the enemy, 
 allowing them no asylum, discountenancing their presence, in 
 every possible way — we shall be taking the shortest, and therefore 
 the most mercifm method of convincing the French and the 
 blacks at once that their empire here is at an end, and slavery 
 henceforth impossible for the negroes of St. Domingo. But, if 
 I make a peace or truce, how dim and perplexed will be the 
 impression of my conduct ! I cannot hold ofBoe, civil or military, 
 under the French. Henri, you would not have me do so ! " 
 
 " Certainly not. Till August, retire to your estate, that every 
 office in the colony may thereafter be in your hand." 
 
 "If I co-operate with the French, even in the faintest 
 appearance, my moral influence will be all on their side, and a second 
 year of warfare wiU find us farther from peace or independence 
 than the first. If I act, more or less, for the blacks, Leclerc will 
 send me to France as a traitor. If I do nothing, neither party 
 will believe in my doing nothing : each will suspect me of secret 
 dealings with the other. It is also true that I cannot, if I would, 
 be inoperative. Every glance of my eye, every word of my lips, 
 in my own piazza at Pongaudin, would be made to bear its 
 interpretation, and go to disturb the single and distinct image 
 which I now stand before every eye and in every mind." 
 
 " I do not agree with you," said Henri. " While the image 
 of August is distinct in the minds of the St. Domingo people, it 
 wUl keep your influence single and intelligible to them. As for 
 what the French think, that is their own affair. They have the 
 means of knowledge. Let them use them. There is one fact 
 which no one can misunderstand, the while: — that after the 
 defections under which you have suffered, and under your known 
 want of military stores, an incursive war from the mountains 
 appears ferocious — ^both revengeful and cruel— when every one 
 Imows that time will render it unnecessary." 
 
 " These defections do not discourage me as they do you, Henri. 
 FuU one third of my forces are faithful — are proved so by trial. 
 These, with the goodness of our cause, are enough for my hopes — 
 almost for my desires. There is no ferocity, but rather mercy, 
 in hastening on the day of our independence and peace, by using 
 a force so respectable — so honoured, as this tried remnant of my 
 army,"

 " Tou reckon fallaciously, Toussaint. You include my troops 
 in the force you speak of." 
 
 " Henri ! " exclaimed L'Onverture, stopping in his walk up 
 the apartment ; "it cannot be that yon will desert me. No, no ! 
 forgive me that the words passed my lips ! " 
 
 " Never will I desert you or our cause, Toussaint. Never will 
 I intermit my enmity to our invaders ; never will I live for any 
 other object than the liberties of our people. But the time may 
 be come for us to pursue our common object by difPereut paths. 
 I cannot go and play the bandit in the mountains." 
 
 " Why did you not call me a bandit when I was at the 
 Plateaux ? " 
 
 " Because yon were then waging an honourable war. War, 
 not peace, was then beckoning yon on to freedom. A state of 
 voluntary outlawry, a practice of needless ravage, will make a 
 different man of you. Say no more of it, Toussaint : I cannot 
 be lieutenant to Do not make me utter the word." 
 
 " Yon have always hitherto obeyed me, Henri." 
 
 " I have ; and when we are in a state of war, I will obey you 
 again. Do not class me with La Plume and Clerveaux — or, 
 rather, do, if you will, and when August is past I will prove to 
 you the difference." 
 
 " Do not you see, Henri, that you not only cease to aid me at 
 a great crisis but that you put a force upon me P " 
 
 " I cannot help it ; I must do so, rather than go and be a 
 butcher in the morues with Dessalines." 
 
 " Say with me, too : caU me a butcher, too ! After the long 
 years that you have known my heart, call me a butcher too." 
 
 " Let us talk sense, Toussaint : this is no time for trifling. 
 After August, I shall join you again — ^to fight, if it be necessary : 
 but I hope it will not." 
 
 " Not if heaven strengthens me to do my work without you, 
 Christophe. After the fever, it is much for the sick to walk : 
 we do not expect the dead to rise." 
 
 "When I join you, after August," resumed Christophe, 
 " whether for the labours of war or peace, you, and perhaps even 
 Jacques, will wish that your hands were as clean from blood as 
 mine. Your thought, Toussaint !— tell me your thought. 
 
 " I was thinking that you will join us, Henri. Tou will 
 labour till our great work is done. You may err ; and you may 
 injure our cause by your error ; but you will never be seduced 
 from the rectitude of your own intentions. That is what I was 
 thinking. I would fain keep my judgment of you undisturbed 
 by a grieving heart." 
 
 "Tou are more than generous, Toussaint : you are just. I 
 was neither. Pqrdon me. But I am unhappy— I am wretched

 that yon are about to forfeit your greatness, when Oh, Tous- 
 
 saint ! nothing should ever grieve- me again, if we could but 
 agree to-day — if I could but see you retire, with your wonted 
 magnanimity, to Pongaudin, there, with your wonted piety, to 
 await the leadings from above. Where is your wonted faith, 
 that you do not see them now, through the clouds that are 
 about us ? " 
 
 " 1 cannot but see them now," said Toussaint, sighing ; " and 
 to see is to foUow. If you are wholly resolved to make a truce 
 for yourseM and your division " 
 
 " I am wholly resolved to do so.'' 
 
 " Then you compel me to do the same. Without you, I have 
 not force sufficient to maintain an effectual resistance." 
 
 " Thank God ! then we shall see you again L'Ouverture, and 
 no longer Toussaint, the outlaw. Tou will " 
 
 " Hear me, Henri ! Tou put this constraint upon me. What 
 are you prepared to do, if the French prove treacherous, after 
 our peace is made P " 
 
 " To drive them into the sea, to be sure. Tou do not suppose 
 I shaU regard them as friends the more for making a truce with 
 them ! We will keep our eyes upon them. We will preserve 
 an understanding with the whole island, as to the vigilance which 
 the blacks must exercise, day and night, over their invaders. 
 The first treacherous thought in Leclerc's mind is a breach of 
 the truce ; and dearly shall he rue it." 
 
 " This is all well planned, Henri. If the cunning of Leclerc 
 proves deeper than yours " 
 
 " Say ours, Toussaint.'' 
 
 " No. I have no part in this arrangement. I act under your 
 compulsion, and under my own protest; as I require of yon, 
 Henri, to remember. If we are not deep enough, vigilant 
 enough, active enough, for Leclerc and his council — if he injures 
 us before August, and Bonaparte ordains a second campaign 
 after it, are you ready to endure the responsibility of whatever 
 may bef aU ? " 
 
 "lam." 
 
 " Have you looked well forward into the future, and detected 
 every mischief that may arise from our present temporising, 
 and resolved that it was a less evil than losing the rest of this 
 season, putting a compulsion upon your best friend, and 
 fettering the deliverer of your people P " 
 
 " I have so looked forward — -repudiating the charge of undu- 
 tiful compulsion. I act for myself, and those under my com- 
 mand." 
 
 " Virtually compelling me to act with you, by reducing me 
 from being the General of an army to be the leader of a troop ; 
 and by exposing our cause to the peril — the greatest of all — of a

 declared division between you and me. I yield, Christoplie ; but 
 what I am going to do, I do under protest. Order in the French 
 prisoners." 
 
 " Tet one moment," said Henri. " Let me reason with yon 
 a little further. Be satisfied of the goodness of the aet before 
 you do it." 
 
 " I do not need satisfaction on that. I do not quarrel with 
 the terms we are to make. I do not protest against any of the 
 provisions of the treaty. I protest against the necessity of 
 treating. Summon the prisoners." 
 
 " Can you," said Ohristophe, still delaying, " can yon improve 
 upon the terms proposed ? Can the conditions be altered, so as 
 to give more satisfaction to your superior foresight ? I would 
 not use flattering terms at this moment, Toussaint ; you know I 
 would not. But your sagacity is greater than mine, or any 
 one's. I distrust myself about the terms of the treaty, I assure 
 you." 
 
 " About anything more than the mere terms of the treaty P " 
 asked Toussaint, again stopping in his walk. 
 
 " About the conditions — and about the conditions only." 
 
 " Tour self-distrust is misplaced, and comes too late. Order 
 the prisoners to be brought in." 
 
 As Sabes and Martin entered, L'Ouverture and Ohristophe 
 renewed, by a glance, their agreement to speak and act with the 
 utmost apparent sameness of views and intentions. It was but 
 a poor substitute for the real coincidence which had always 
 hitherto existed ; but it was all that was now possible. 
 
 "I am going to send you back to your Captain-General, 
 gentlemen," said Toussaint. 
 
 ''Not without apology, I trust," said Sabes, "for having 
 subjected to such treatment as we have undergone, messengers 
 sent to parley — bearing actually the necessary credentials from 
 the Captain-General. For nine weeks have my companion and 
 I been dragged from place to place, wherever it suited your 
 purposes to go, in perpetual fear for our lives." 
 
 " I am sorry you have trembled for your lives, gentlemen," 
 replied Toussaint. " It was an unnecessary suffering, as I gave 
 you my word, on your capture, that your persons were safe. 
 Considering that you were found crouching among the ferns, 
 within hearing of my private conversation with my son respect- 
 ing the affairs of the war, I think your complaints of your 
 detention unreasonable; and I have no apology to make, on 
 that ground, either to yourselves or your commander. I cannot 
 hear another word of complaint, gentlemen. You know well 
 that by any general in Europe you would, under similar circum- 
 stances, have been hanged as spies. Now to public business. 
 I am about to send you to General Leclerc, with proposals from

TERMS OF PEACE. 3O9 
 
 General Ohristophe and myself to bring this painful war to an 
 end, according to the desire of the heads of both armies. We 
 all know such to be the wish of the Captain-General." 
 
 "No doubt. It was never his desire, nor that of any 
 triie Frenchman," said Sabes, "to be at war on the soil of 
 this colony. Ton alone, General Toussaint, are responsible 
 for the loss of lives, and all the other miseries which it has 
 occasioned." 
 
 " How so ? Let him say on, Lieutenant Martin. No one 
 suffers by speaking his thoughts to me, be they what they 
 may. On what consideration is it possible to impute this war 
 tome?" 
 
 "It would never have broken out if you had not despised 
 the authority, and thrown oH the control, of the mother- country. 
 This view cannot be new to you. General Toussaint," continued 
 Sabes, on seeing the look of amazement with which L'Ouverture 
 turned to Christophe. 
 
 '' Indeed it is," replied Toussaint. " The charge is as unex- 
 pected as it is untrue. You, sir," he said, appealing to Lieu- 
 tenant Martin, " are a naval officer. Tell me how you would 
 act in such a case as this. Suppose you commanded a vessel of 
 the state, authorised and approved in your office ? suppose 
 another officer came — without notice, without your having 
 heard a word of complaint — and leaped upon your deck, with 
 a crew double the number of your own, striking down and 
 fettering your men. If you resisted their violence in such a 
 case, successfully or unsuccessfully, would you admit that you 
 were the cause of the struggle — that you despised the govern- 
 ment under which you held your command — that you threw off 
 the control of your superiors ? " 
 
 There was a pause. 
 
 " Such is my case," said Toussaint ; " and thus you must 
 represent it, if you be men of honour. The purport of my letter 
 to the Captain-General (which wUl be ready by the time you 
 are prepared for your journey), is to declare the willingness of 
 General Christophe and myself to negotiate, as the continuation 
 of the war, under the circumstances which have arisen, appears 
 to be without object. The terms which we require, and which 
 it is supposed General Leclerc will agree to, are an amnesty for 
 aU who have ever fought, or otherwise acted, under our com- 
 mand; and the preservation of the rank of aU black officers, 
 civil and military. My friend Christophe and I wiU retire to 
 our estates, to pray for the peace and welfare of the colony — 
 the peace and welfare which have, notwithstanding our prayers, 
 been so unhappUy broken up. Gentlemen, there can be little 
 doubt that the Captain- General will agree to these terms of 
 pacification." 
 


## p. (#314) ################################################

3IO THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 "We cannot answer for his replies," said Martin. "Our 
 representations shall be faithful." 
 
 " I doubt it not," said Toussaint, " after experiencing your 
 companion's courage and fidelity in rebuke ; for which, though 
 he is mistaken in fact, I honour him. Nor can I doubt the 
 readiness of the Oaptain-General to treat with us on the terms I 
 shall propose ; for he must know that I shall always, among my 
 native fastnesses, be strong to bum, ravage, and destroy. He 
 must know, that though my negroes may be conquered, they will 
 never more be subdued ; and that, entrenched in the momes, 
 they can always effectually prevent an unfriendly settlement of 
 the island. He must know that I am open to generous treat- 
 ment ; but otherwise ready and able to sell deai-ly a life which 
 has done our country some service." 
 
 The French officers assented ; but waited, as if to hear some- 
 thing more, besides Ohristophe's declaration, for his own part, 
 of agreement in wha,t L'Ouverture had said. 
 
 Sabes at length spoke, not without another cautionary sign 
 from his companion. 
 
 "Tour generous frankness, General Toussaint," said he, 
 " induces me to remind you of one more duty which, in case of 
 the desired pacification, yon tntU owe to the Captain-General. 
 You wiU hold yourself indebted to France for all such treasure 
 as, in an hour of alarm, you may have chosen to conceal." 
 
 " What does this mean ? " said Toussaint. " General Chris- 
 tophe, do you know of any public treasure being concealed iu 
 any part of the island ? " 
 
 " None," said Ohristophe, " public or private." 
 
 " Nor do I. Ton hear, gentlemen." 
 
 " Ton forget. General Toussaint, what we heard on the occa- 
 sion of our capture." 
 
 " Ton forget your own words to us," said Lieutenant Martin 
 — " that we had seen and heard too much for you to let us go." 
 
 " I remember my words perfectly ; and that tlxey referred to 
 my choice of a post in the momes, and a retreat for my family — 
 affairs long since made public enough. What else do you sup- 
 pose you saw and heard ? If I spoke of depositing my treasures 
 in the momes, I was doubtless speaking of my household. Did 
 you understand me to mean gold and silver? What was it that 
 yon suppose you saw and heard p " 
 
 " We saw new-made graves, and the tools that dug them, 
 after having heard shots." 
 
 " Ton are welcome to dig upon the Plateaux, and to take 
 whatever treasure you may find. Ton will find only the bones 
 of the brave who fell in attacking and defending the post." 
 
 "Andof those who, being there, can tell no tales. Ton forget 
 that we heard their death-shots before we saw their graves.

 The time is come for you to tell the secret that you buried with 
 them." 
 
 Ohristophe rarely laughed ; but he laughed now. 
 
 " They beHeve," said he — " apparently they believe — that 
 you hid treasure in the morne, and then shot and buried the 
 servants employed." 
 
 " We do," said the officers, gravely. 
 
 " Were you really about to carry this story to the Captain- 
 General P " asked Toussaiut, smiling. " Tell him that the wealth 
 of the colony, sufficient for the desires of its iahabitants, is dis- 
 persed through all its dwellings, to be enjoyed — not hidden by 
 avarice, and sealed with blood." 
 
 " We are too weU informed," said Sabes, " concerning the 
 wealth and splendour of the colony to beheve that any part of 
 its treasure has met our eyes that can be concealed. Duty to 
 France now requires that she should be put in possession of the 
 whole wealth of the island." 
 
 " Let Prance ctdtivate an honourable peace," said Toussaint, 
 " and her authorities will assuredly see the wealth of the colony 
 spread over all its fields, and amassed in every harbour. We can 
 then present an overflowing public treasury. That is all I have 
 to offer : and it ought to be enough." 
 
 Sabes did not press the point further, because he saw it would 
 be useless. But he and his companion were more and more 
 persuaded of the truth of their notion of what they had seen and 
 heard, the more they recalled the tales told at the Court of Prance 
 of the plate, the gems, the bullion and coin, and the personal 
 ornaments which abounded, even in the prosperous days of the 
 old emigrants. Every one knew, too, that the colony had been 
 more prosperous than ever since. It is not known by whom the 
 amount of the hidden treasure was, at length, fixed at thirty-two 
 millions of francs. Sabes and Martin simply told their story and 
 their ideas to Leclerc, adding the information that Toussaint 
 L'Ouverture was an adept in dissimulation ; that they had as 
 nearly as possible been deprived of this piece of insight, by the 
 apparent frankness and candour of his manners ; and that, but 
 for the boldness of Sabes in pressing the affair of the buried trea- 
 sure, they should actually have quitted the negro chief, after an 
 occasional intercourse of nine weeks, without any knowledge of 
 that power of dissimulation which had been formerly attributed 
 to him by those who, it now appeared, knew him well, and which 
 must be the guiding fact in all the Captain-General's dealings 
 with him. His cunning must be met by all the cunning that 
 Leclerc's united council could muster, or destruction would lurk 
 under the pretended pacification. Accordingly, the whole of 
 Leclerc's policy henceforth proceeded on the supposed fact of 
 Toussaint L'Ouverture being the prince of dissemblers.

 CHAPTER XXXIV. 
 
 RECEDING. 
 
 LecLebc was eager to receiTe proposals of peace, — to owe a 
 respite to dissimulation itself, rather than continue the war, under 
 his present difficulties. It was weary work, keeping up a show 
 before the eyes of the blacks, when, of the twelve thousand 
 soldiers whom he had brought with him, five thousand had fallen 
 in battle, and five thousand more were in the hospitals. Twenty 
 thousand had arrived within a few weeks, from France ; and, of 
 these, scarcely eleven thousand remained fit for service. Happy 
 indeed was Leclero to receive replies to his overtures of peace ; 
 and anxious was he to testify every respect to the generals whom 
 he had lately insulted and defied. He revoked their outlawry, 
 commending them to the esteem and good offices of those to whom 
 he had desired to deliver them as traitors. It is true, he trans- 
 mitted to France magnificent accounts of the surrender of the 
 blacks, of their abject supplications for their lives, and of the 
 skill and prowess by which he had subdued the rebels, and 
 restored the colony to France. But these boastings were not 
 known in St. Domingo ; though the true state of the case was 
 whispered in Paris, as regarded the mortality among the white 
 troops, and the formidable influence still retained by the negro 
 leaders. 
 
 Leolerc invited Toussaint to visit him at Cap ; as well aware, 
 doubtless, as Toussaint himself, that this open indication of amity 
 was necessary to protect the army from the iU-will of the blacks, 
 who would not believe, on any other authority than L'Onverture's 
 own, that he had made peace with the invaders. 
 
 It was a mournful, though showy demonstration, and all parties 
 were glad when it was over. As L'Ouverture rode from Le 
 Doudou to Cap Pran^ais, followed by a guard of three hundred 
 and fifty horse, he was ^eeted by the inhabitants with the pro- 
 foundest respect. Only in by-places, or from the depths of some 
 wood, did a few voices sing, in negro language, tiie new song 
 which was spreading over the island in praise of August, — ex- 
 horting to patience and peace till August. As he entered the 
 town of Cap, the thunder of artillery reverberated from the 
 heights around. Every fort along the coast, every vessel in the 
 roads, fired its salute; and the inhabitants of eveiy colour 
 issued from their houses, to pay honour to their adored 
 L'Ouverture. 
 
 Leclero stood ready to receive him, and to administer to hiro 
 the oath of allegiance in the hall of Government House, the doors 
 of which stood wide, and were carefuUy kept so by Toussaint "s

BEFORE LECLERC, 3I3 
 
 own guard, who would not, for a moment, let their commander 
 be hidden from their sight. They formed in the Walk, and in 
 the court of Government House, remaining in fighting order, 
 with drawn sabres, during the whole of the interview between 
 the late and the present Commander-in-chief. 
 
 With an unaltered countenance, Toussaint took once more the 
 oath of allegiance to Fiance ; — the oath which it had never been 
 his desire to break. He smiled when he heard this simple act 
 proclaimed by another roar of artUlery, such as might have 
 greeted a victory. Leclerc frowned ; for it was not followed, as 
 he had hoped, by acclamations. The echoes died away into 
 deep silence. 
 
 It was an awkward moment. Leclerc hoped that Toussaint 
 would lead the conversation. But Toussaint was deep in thought. 
 Gazing on the anxious and sickly face of the Captain-General, he 
 was grieving at heart that he, and so many thousands more who 
 might have lived long and useful lives at home, should be laid 
 low, in the course of a bad enterprise against the liberties of the 
 natives. The mournful gaze of his mild eyes confused the 
 Captain-General, so that he said the first thing that occurred, in 
 order to break the silence. He observed that he understood there 
 was some business yet standing over for settlement between the 
 parties who had so happUy met at last. He had no doubt that 
 General Toussaint would see clearly that in his allegiance to 
 France was involved the duty of accounting to the government 
 for the wealth of the island, whether open to estimate or con- 
 cealed in the momes, or elsewhere. 
 
 " I have heard something of this before,'' said Toussaint, " and 
 am as ignorant as yourself of any buried treasure. In this island, 
 Nature is so perpetually bountiful, that we have not the tempta- 
 tion which we are told exists elsewhere, to amass wealth against 
 a time of dearth. I have no treasure." 
 
 " If so, how could you have proposed to remain out of the 
 bounds of the law, as you did till lately P Nature is not bountiful 
 on the mountain-peaks, which must then have been your abode. 
 At least, Nature does not there bring forth arms and ammuni- 
 tion. Without treasure, with which to purchase supplies, how 
 woxdd you have obtained arms and ammunition ? " 
 
 " I should have taken yours." 
 
 Leclerc saw that even his own followers were more disposed 
 to applaud than resent these words ; and he, therefore, changed 
 the topic. 
 
 " It is fortunate, then, for all parties," said he, " that future 
 struggles are avoided. We are friends. Let it go abroad through 
 the whole island that we are friends." 
 
 Toussaint made no reply. Leclerc continued — 
 
 " You, General, and youi' troops, will be employed and treated

 like the rest of my army. "With regard to yourself, you desire 
 repose." — Looking round, he repeated the words emphatically. 
 " You desire repose : and you deserve it. After a man has sus- 
 tained for several years the government of St. Domingo, I 
 apprehend he needs repose. I leave you at liberty to retire to 
 which of your estates you please. I rely so much on the attach- 
 ment you bear the colony of St. Domingo, as to believe you wiU 
 employ what moments of leisure you may have during your 
 retreat, in communicating to me your ideas respecting the means 
 proper to be taken to cause agriculture and commerce again to 
 flourish. Respecting your forces, and those of General Christophe, 
 I hold full information. As soon as a list and statement of the 
 troops under General Dessalines are transmitted to me, I will 
 communicate my instructions as to the positions they are to take." 
 
 " I wiU send a messenger from my guard to General Dessalines, 
 this day," said Toussaiut. " I shall be passing near his post, on 
 my way to my house at Pongaudin; and he shall have your 
 message." 
 
 " This day ? " said Leclerc, in a tone of some constraint. 
 " Will you not spend this day with us ? " 
 
 " I cannot," replied Toussaint. " I must be gone to my 
 home." 
 
 As soon as it was believed that he was fairly out of hearing, 
 the acts of the morning were proclaimed throughout Cap !Fran9ais 
 as the PARDON of Generals Toussaint and Christophe. This pro- 
 clamation was afterwards published, by Leclerc's orders, in the 
 Gazette d/u, Gap, where it was read by Toussaint in his study at 
 Pongaudin. 
 
 " See ! " said he, pointing out the paragraph to Pascal, with a 
 smile. " This is the way of men with each other. See the 
 complacency with which one man pardons another for the most 
 necessary, or the best deed of his life ! " 
 
 During a halt on the road to Pongaudin, Isaac and Aimee 
 appeared. Aimee was tearful, but her face was happy. So were 
 her words. 
 
 " Oh, father ! " she said, " who could have hoped, after what 
 has happened, that all would so soon be well ! " 
 
 " I am rejoiced to see you happy, my children." 
 
 " And you, father, you are happy ? Honoured as you are — 
 the colony at peace — all parties friends— no more divisions — 
 no more struggles in families ! Father, answer me. Is it not 
 allweU?" 
 
 " No, my child." 
 
 " Are you unhappy, fatlier ? " 
 
 "Yes, my child." 
 
 "I am quite disappointed, quite grieved," said Aimee, draw- 
 ing back from his arms, to look in his face.

 " Vincent gave us a glorious account on Tortuga," said Isaac, 
 " of the welcome you had at Cap. We thought '' 
 
 " I did not see Vincent at Cap." 
 
 " He was not there ; but he Imew all " 
 
 " But, father," said Aimde, " you wiU see General Yincent. 
 You will see him at Pongaudin. Now that you have done as he 
 did — now that you are friends with the French, as he is, you will 
 see him, father ? " 
 
 " I have never done as Vincent did, Aim^e ; and my friendship 
 with the French is what it ever was. If Vincent comes as your 
 husband, I will see him as such. As a friend, I cannot. Is he 
 your husband, my love ? " 
 
 " No." 
 
 " He is to be your husband P " 
 
 " If you would see him. If he were your friend. He urges 
 me, father ; and Madame Leclerc and Isaac urge me ; but I 
 cannot marry him yet. Father, you do not know how much my 
 heart is with you and my mother." 
 
 " Are you happy, Aimee ? " 
 
 " Madame Leclerc is very kind ; and Vincent's love is every- 
 thing that ought to make me happy, but " 
 
 "Will you go home with me, my child ? "

 " I cannot, Aimee. -Would that I could ! "

 we are married we wUl come to Pongaudin. May we P " 
 
 " Come, my dear, when you will. Your parents' home and 
 hearts will always be open to you. Meantime, write often to us, 
 Aimee." 
 
 "Oh, yes! I will. I will write very often; and you will 
 answer. I have heard perpetually of my mother, and of poor 
 Genifrede. But where is Placide ? I thought we should have 
 met him. Was not he at Cap ? " 
 
 " At Cap ! No, indeed ! He was too heart-broken to be at 
 Cap to-day." 
 
 " I wish I could understand it all ! " said Aim^e, sadly. " I 
 am sure there are many things that I do not know or compre- 
 hend. I thought all had been right now; and yet you and 
 Placide are unhappy. I cannot understand it all." 
 
 " Time will explain, my child. There will come a day when 
 aU doubts will be cleared up, and all woes at an end — when the 
 wicked will cease from troubling, love, and the weary be at rest." 
 
 " Must you be going, father, already ? Oh ! I wish " 
 
 And she looked at Isaac, as if purposing to go to Pongaudin. 
 Isaac, had, however, promised Madame Leclerc to return by an

 appointed hour. There could be no difficulty, he said, in going 
 to Pongandin any day : but to-day he had promised that they 
 would both return to Madame Leclerc. Aimee, therefore, bade 
 her father farewell for the present — only for a very little while. 
 He must tell her mother that they should certainly meet very 
 soon. 
 
 In the piazza, at Pongaudin, Toussaint found Christophe. 
 
 " I wish," said Christophe, " you would send to Dessalines 
 not only the Captain-General's message, but your own request 
 that he will yield." 
 
 " I cannot, Henri." 
 
 " But he may spoil all by holding out." 
 
 " I have done what I can in yielding myself. I can do no 
 more." 
 
 " Tou approve our act ? Surely you do not repent of wliat 
 you have done P " 
 
 " I cannot repent of what I could not avoid. But enough of 
 business for to-day, my friend. Where is Madame Christophe ? 
 Where are your children P Bring them here ; and let us enjoy 
 leisure and friendship once more, while we can." 
 
 " We wUl. But, Toussaint, if you could only say that you 
 are satisfied that we have done what is best, it would relieve me 
 much." 
 
 " 1 cannot, Henri. But, be assured, I fully acquiesce. One 
 has not always the comfort of being able to acquiesce." 
 
 " Can you say, then, that you forgive me, in as far as you 
 think me wrong P " 
 
 " Can you doubt it ? " replied Toussaint, turning upon him a 
 countenance full of frank affection. " Are you not a friend of 
 many years P " 
 
 " God forgive me if I have misled you, Toussaiut ! " 
 
 CHAPTER XXXV. 
 
 STJSPBlfSE. 
 
 Nattteb wrought with the blacks this season for the fulfilment 
 of their hopes, and the defence of their precarious liberties. 
 Never, within the remembrance of the young people at Pon- 
 gaudin, had the heat set in so early, and the month of May been 
 so sickly in the towns. To the eyes of such as G&ifrede, who 
 were ever on the watch for signs, it might almost seem that they 
 saw Pestilence floating, on her poison-droppiug wings, beneath 
 the clouds which sailed from all quarters of the sky to the

 moimfain peaks ; clouds muttering in thunder, and startling the 
 intruders with terrific lightnings, from night to night. The 
 reports of feyer having broken out here and there among the 
 invaders became more and more frequent. At first, those who 
 were watching the times the most intently concluded that, early 
 as the season was, " the wish " must be " father to the thought," 
 and believed little of what they heard. But before Toussaint 
 had been ten days at Pongaudin, it was certain that disease was 
 raging to such an extent among the French troops at Cap, that 
 the Captain- General had retired to Tortuga, to join his lady, and 
 others of the expedition who were the most carefully guarded. 
 The garrison at St. Mare was thinning, Th&ese sent word ; and 
 the country people conveyed to Pongaudin the news that funerals 
 were becoming daily more frequent at Limbe, Le Dauphin, and 
 other posts along the northern shore. 
 
 Not for this, however, was there any relaxation of the vigilance 
 with which L'Ouverture was watched by the foe. His mode 
 of life was simple, and open to the observation of any who 
 chose to look on. He improved his gardens ; he read much ; he 
 interested himself in Denis's studies; he rode out daily, and 
 conversed everywhere with the people by the wayside. He 
 wrote many letters, sometimes with his own hand, and sometimes 
 employing that of his friend, M. Pascal, who, with his wife, 
 resided with the Ouvertures. Toussaint also received m£my 
 letters, and a perpetual succession of visitors — of applicants 
 about matters of business, as it seemed. The only mystery was, 
 how all his despatches were sent to their destination. This was 
 a mystery which grew out of the French practice of intercepting 
 his correspondence. Accidents had happened to so many of his 
 letters during the first week, that he presently learned the 
 necessity of some plan for securing the privacy of his corre- 
 spondence : and some plan he did devise, which quite succeeded ; 
 as appeared from the French General having recourse to a new 
 mode of surveillance — that of setting spies on the person and 
 movements of the black chief. 
 
 Toussaint's family were alarmed at finding his steps tracked, 
 and his repose watched. They heard incessantly of his path 
 being crossed in his rides ; and they knew that many of the 
 trifling messages which were brought, at aU hours of the day and 
 night, to be delivered into L'Onverture's own ear, were mere 
 devices to learn whether he was' at home. They saw that their 
 grounds were never private ; and felt that eyes watched them 
 from the outer darkness when their saloon was lighted for their 
 evening employments and amusements. Toussaint smiled at 
 the alarms of his family, admitting the fact of this incessant 
 espionriage, but asking what harm it did, and pointing out that 
 it was only an inconvenience oi a few weeks' duration. He

 would not hear of any strengtliening of his guard. To increase 
 his guard would be to encourage and authorise the suspicious 
 which he was now daily weakening. He had nothing to conceal; 
 and the sooner the invaders satisfied themselves of this, the 
 better for all parties. 
 
 In answer to Madame L'OuTcrture's frequent speculations as 
 to what Leclerc could fix his suspicions on, Toussaint said he 
 was probably supposed to be in communication with Dessalines. 
 He thought so from his never approaching the momes, in his 
 rides, without finding French soldiers overlooking his proceedings 
 from every point of the hiUs. He was not in communication 
 with Dessalines. He did not know, and he wished not to know 
 even where he was — whether with the Bellairs, or training his 
 soldiers elsewhere for further warfare. Dessalines had never 
 submitted ; and while this was the case, it was obviously prudent 
 for those who had made terVns to know nothing of any plans of 
 his to which they might wish success. Therfese wotdd not com- 
 promise the Ouvertures by living with them, in the present state 
 of affairs. She remained quietly on her husband's estate, near 
 St. Marc, only corresponding frequently with her friends at 
 Pongaudin, in letters which all the world might see. 
 
 The chief subject of this correspondence was the fever-hospitals 
 preparing at St. Marc, as at all the other towns on the coast, for 
 the reception of the sick whites. Whatever might be Ther^se's 
 feelings towards the whites, her compassion towards sick persons 
 of every colour was stronger. Her gentle nature asserted itself 
 whenever weakness and suffering appealed to it ; and this season 
 she began to inspire that affection in her neighbours — to establish 
 that character for devoted charity, which afterwards made her 
 the idol of the people. If her husband had been with her, he 
 would probably have forbidden her to save the lives of any of 
 that race whom he desired to exterminate. But though she could 
 perhaps have taken away life, with her ovni hand, on the battle- 
 field, with the cry of liberty in her ear, she could form no com- 
 pact with such an ally as pestilence. In the season of truce and 
 retreat, in the absence of the sounds and sights of conflict, she 
 became all the woman — the gentle spirit — ^to whom the colony 
 from this time looked up, as sent to temper her husband's 
 ferocity, and wisely to direct his strengthening passions. She 
 who was so soon after "the Good Empress," was now the Sister 
 of Charity, actually forgetting former wrongs in present compas- 
 sion for the helpless ; and ministering to the sick without thought 
 whether, on recovery, they would be friends or foes. It was 
 matter of speculation to many besides the Ouvertm-es, whether 
 the invaders omitted the opportunity of making a hostage of her, 
 because their sick needed her services, or because they were 
 grateful for her ofBces, or because they knew Dessalines well

NURSING THE WHITES. 3 IQ 
 
 enough to be aware that, so far from such an act bringing him to 
 submission, it would exasperate his ferocity, and draw down new 
 sufferings and danger upon the discouraged whites. 
 
 One evening, the household of the Ouvertures were where it 
 was now their wont to be at sunset — under the trees, on a 
 grassy slope of the gardens, fronting the west. There they 
 usually sat at this hour, to see the sun sink into the ocean ; the 
 darkness following almost as quickly as if that great fire were 
 indeed quenched in the waters. On this occasion, the sun was 
 still half-an-hour above the horizon, when Madame Dessalines 
 appeared, in her riding-dress, and, as she said, in haste. She 
 spoke apart with Madame L'Ouverture and Toussaiut ; and 
 presently called Genifrede to the conference. 
 
 Therese had of late wanted help at St. Marc — ^help in direct- 
 ing the nursing of the sick. Now she must have it. M. Papalier 
 was iU — verj' ill. The people of the house where he lived insisted 
 upon sending him into the hospital this very night, if good 
 attendance were not provided for him ; and now 
 
 Th&rSse did not yet seem quite clear why this event had 
 determined the moment of her application for Genifrede's assist- 
 ance. She was agitated. She could only say that Genifrede 
 had nursed Dessalines well ; and she must have her help again 
 now. 
 
 "Tou wOl go, Genifrede," said her father; "that Madame 
 Dessalines may be at liberty to nurse M. Papalier herself." 
 
 "No, no," said Therese, trembling. Genifrede also said 
 "No." 
 
 " Tou would not have me nurse him V said Therese. "Any 
 one else ! Ask me to save Rochambeau. Send me to Tortuga, 
 to raise Leclerc from the brink of the grave ; but do not expect 
 me to be his nurse again." 
 
 " I do hope it from you. I expect it of you, when you have 
 considered the tenfold mercy of nursing hitn with your own 
 hands. Think of the opportunity you will give him of retrieving 
 wrongs, if he lives, and of easing his soul, if he dies. How 
 many of us would desire, above all things, to have those whom 
 we have injured beside our dying pillow, to make friends of 
 them at last? Let M. Papalier die grateful to you, if he 
 must die; and give him a new heart towards you, if he sur. 
 vivos." 
 
 " It was not this that I intended," said Therese. " Genifrede 
 will do everything, under my care. Tou shall have my help, 
 Genifrfede." 
 
 " No," said Genifrede. " Do not play the tempter with me. 
 Find some one else. Tou will have much to answer for, if you 
 make me go." 
 
 " What temptation, Genifrede ? " asked hey moth?r.

320 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " Do not press her," said Toussaint, who read his child's mind. 
 " You shall not be urged, Geni£rMe." 
 
 " Tou do not know — I myseM do not know," said GInifrede, 
 hurriedly, to Madame Dessalines, " what might happen— what I 
 might be tempted to do. Tou know — you have read what some 
 nurses did in the plague at Milan — in the plague in London — ^in 
 
 the night — with wet cloths " 
 
 " Do not speak of it. Stay here, Genifrede. I can do without 
 you." 
 
 " If," continued Genifrede, " they could do that for money — 
 if the tempter moved their hands to that deed with whispers of 
 money, with the sight of mere rings and watches, what might 
 not a wretched creature do, at such a time, with revenge mut- 
 tering for ever in her heart ! My ear is weary of it here ; and 
 
 there 1 cannot go." 
 
 " No, you cannot," said Therese.'' 
 
 " Christ strengthen you, my child," said Toussaint, " as The- 
 rese is strengthening ! She can already serve those whom she 
 and you once hated alike : and she is about to save her foe of 
 foes." 
 
 " No, you will not save M. Papalier," said Genifrede. 
 " L'Ouverture is a prophet, as all men are in proportion as 
 they are Christians," said Therese. "If he says I shall save my 
 enemy, I believe I shall." 
 
 " Tou will, at least, try. If you are going, go ; — the sun is 
 setting," said Toussaint. " What escort have you ? " 
 " Old Dessalines and another, I want no more." 
 " Old Dessalines ! " said Toussaint, smiling ; " then he must 
 have wine. I must see him." 
 
 " He is here," said Therese, calling him. 
 The old man was, indeed, lingering near, preferring the chance 
 of a word from L'Ouverture even to supper and wine within. 
 He was ready enough to tell his story : — that he lived as butler 
 at General Dessalines' ; and, that though master and servant 
 had changed places, he liked the new times better than the old. 
 He was treated with more respect now, by everybody, than when 
 he was a negro tradesman, even though he then had a slave of 
 his own. The place of butler suited him too. General Dessalines 
 and his lady drank only water ; and they left him to manage 
 the wine-cellar just as he liked ; except at the present time, 
 when a dreadful quantity of wine was wanted for the conva- 
 lescents. It frightened him to think how soon the cellar might 
 be emptied, if they went on at this rate. Old Dessalines was 
 glad he had come to Pongaudin to-day. He had not only seen 
 L'Ouverture, but had heard from L'Ouverture's own lips that 
 General Dessalines' cellars shoidd never be quite empty while 
 there was wine at Pongaudin.

CHRISTIANITY. 3 2 1 
 
 When Toussaint resumed his seat under the tree, where the 
 Pascals, Euphrosyne, Placide, and Denis remained (the rest 
 having gone into the house with Therese), he found Denis dis- 
 cussing with M. Pascal the principle and policy of nursing the 
 sick who were hereafter to be mown down on the battle-field. 
 Denis had been reminded that this was a time of peace, and that 
 he was not authorised to anticipate more battle-fields : and his 
 reply had shown that he had no faith in this peace, but looked 
 forward, like others of his colour, to August and its consequences. 
 He was not contradicted here ; and he went on to ask whether 
 the Crusaders (his favourite warriors) nursed the wounded and 
 sick heathens whom they found on their road, and in the cities 
 they took. 
 
 " They were no Christians if they did not," said Euphrosyne. 
 
 " It was a savage age," observed Placide. 
 
 " Still they were the representatives of the Christianity of 
 their day," said Afra ; " and Christianity requires us to do good 
 to those who use us ill." 
 
 " The Crusaders," said Toussaint, " lived in the early days of 
 that Christianity which is to endure as long as the race of man. 
 Like others, they did their part in acting out one of its prin- 
 ciples. That one was not love of enemies, — which yet remains 
 for us." 
 
 " I agree with you," said Pascal. " There are many ways of 
 warring for the Cross. Theirs was one ; ours is another." 
 
 " You always speak as if you were a black, M. Pascal," said 
 Denis. 
 
 '' I would fain be a negro in heart and temper, Denis, if what 
 your father thinks of the vocation of negroes be true." 
 
 " But about those ways of warring for the Cross ! " inquired 
 Afra. 
 
 "I mean, and L'Ouverture, I think, means," said Pascal, 
 " that nothing can immediately alter the nature of men ; that 
 the glorious Gospel itself is made to change the face of the world 
 gradually; all the more surely, because slowly and naturally. 
 This seed of life was cast upon the flood of human passions, and 
 the harvest must not be looked for till after many days. Mean- 
 time it sprouts out, now here, now there, proving that it is alive 
 and growing ; but the harvest is not yet." 
 
 " We find one trace of the Gospel here, and another there," 
 said Toussaint ; " but a Christian nation, or race, or class of 
 people, who has seen ? " 
 
 "Not in the earliest days ? " asked Euphrosyne. " Were not 
 the first confessors and martyrs a Christian class ?'' 
 
 "They were so according to their intention, to their own 
 idea," said Toussaint. " They were votaries of the one Christian 
 principle most needed in their time. The noble men, the 
 U

 courageous women, who stood, calm and resolved, in the midst 
 of the amphitheatre, with the heathen altar behind them, the 
 hungry tiger before them, and a careless or scoffing multitude 
 ranged aU around — these were strong witnesses to the great 
 principle of Faith — ^noble proofs of the power of Hving and 
 dying for things unseen. This was their function. It was for 
 others to show forth the humility and modesty in which, as a 
 class, they failed." 
 
 " The anchorites," said Pascal, " each in his cave, solitary, 
 abstemious, showed forth in its strength the principle of Devo- 
 tion, leaving Charity unthought of." 
 
 " And then the nun," said Toussaint 
 
 " What possible grace of religion did the nun exhibit ? " asked 
 Euphrosyne. 
 
 " The original nun, Euphrosyne, was inspired with the rever- 
 ence of Purity. In an age of licence, those who were devoted to 
 spiritual things were the salt of the earth. But in their worship 
 of purity they outraged human love." 
 
 " The friar," said Pascal, " was a perpetual emblem of Un- 
 worldliness. He forced upon the admiration of a self-seeking 
 world the peace of poverty, the repose of soul which is troubled 
 with no thought for the morrow. But for other teachers, how- 
 ever, industry would have been despised — the great law of toil 
 would have remained unrecognised." 
 
 " The Crusaders worked nard enough,'' said Denis. "Thou- 
 sands and thousands of them died of their toils, besides the slain." 
 
 " They were the apostles of Zeal," said M. Pascal. " For the 
 honour of the Gospel they suffered and died. They overlooked 
 all that it teaches of toleration and universal love ; — of peace on 
 earth and good-wiU to men." 
 
 " None of these Christians," said Afra, " appear to have had 
 much concern for men. They seemed to have lived for God and 
 the faith, without love or care for those for whose sake God gave 
 the faith." 
 
 " Just so," said her husband. " That part of our religion had 
 not yet come into action. The first step taken towards this 
 action was one which united with it the former devotion to God. 
 The organisation of the great Church of Christ united, in the 
 intentions of those who formed it, care for the glory of God and 
 the salvation of men. It was a great step." 
 
 " But still," said Euphrosyne, " there was not the Charity, 
 the living for the good of men; soul and body, which was what 
 Christ taught and practised." 
 
 " That, Euphrosyne, was a later fruit ; but it is ripening now. 
 We have more Sisters of Charity than contemplative nuns, at 
 this time. There are hospitals in every Christian land for the 
 sick and the aged. It is remembered now, too, that Christ had

 compassion on the blind, and the deaf, and the insane : and 
 charity to these is now the Christianity of a multitude." 
 
 " And what is their defect P " asked Denis. " What essential 
 do they overlook, as the anchorite and the crusader oTerlooked 
 this same charity P " 
 
 " It may be liberality — regard to the Christian liberty of 
 others ; — it may be " 
 
 " Let us not look too closely into their failures," said Tous- 
 saint. " Let us not judge our brethren. These are too near our 
 own time for us to be just judges. We see their charity— the 
 brightest light yet in the constellation of Christian principles; 
 let us be thankful that our eyes hare seen it. It is brightening 
 too ; so that day telleth to-day of its increase, and night is witness 
 of it unto night. It is now not only the sick and infirm in body 
 that are cared for ; but I am told there has been a man in Eng- 
 land who has taken such pity on those who are sick and deformed 
 in soul as to have explored the most loathsome of European 
 prisons in their behalf. There has been a Briton who pitied the 
 guilty above all other sufferers, and devoted to them his time, 
 his fortune, his all. He will have followers, till Christendom 
 itself follows him ; and he wiU thus haTe carried forward the 
 Gospel one step. The charity which grieves more for the defor- 
 mity of the Bom than the evils of the body is so far higher a 
 charity, that it may almost be called a new principle." 
 
 " What remains p " asked Euphrosyne. 
 
 " Do you see anything further to be done, father P " inquired 
 Denis. 
 
 With a mournful smile, Toussaint replied that mankind had 
 advanced but a little way yet. The world was very far from 
 being Christianised. 
 
 " In practice," said Euphrosyne. " But, supposing us all 
 to fulfil what has been exemplified from the earliest days till 
 now, do you suppose that many principles remain to be acted 
 upon P " 
 
 " No doubt. If I saw none, I should believe, from aU expe- 
 rience, that revelations (or rather verifications of what Christ 
 revealed) will succeed each other as long as men exist. But, 
 from the beginning tUl now, individuals here and there have 
 lived by the principles which classes and nations have overlooked. 
 By a solitary ray shining here and there, we may foretell some- 
 thing of the new lights about to rise upon the world. There 
 wiU be more privileged classes, Euphrosyne ; and, Denis, these 
 privileges are lying within our grasp." 
 
 " A new charity, father ? " 
 
 " A new charity, my boy. To solace the sick and infirm is 
 good. To tend the diseased soul is better. But there is a higher 
 charity stiU," 
 


## p. (#328) ################################################

324 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " To do good to those who hate us," said M. Pascal ; " in 
 doing good, to conquer not only our love of ease and onr fear of 
 pain, but our prejudices, our just resentments, our remembrance 
 of injuries, our disgust at oppression, our contempt of pride — to 
 forget or conquer Sil these through the love of men as men, is, in- 
 deed, a higher charity than any wmch classes have yet illustrated." 
 
 " The negroes are the race that will illustrate it," said Tous- 
 Baint, with calm confidence. " The Gospel is for the whole world. 
 It sprang up among the Jews ; the white Gentiles hold it now ; 
 and the negroes are destined to fulfil their share. They are to 
 illustrate its highest Charity. For tokens, mark their meek and 
 kindly natures, the softness and the constancy of their afEections, 
 and (whenever tried) their placability. Thus prepared, liberty 
 is about to be opened to them in a region of civilisation. When 
 God has given them the strength of the free, it wiU exalt their 
 meekness and their love into that highest charity of which we 
 have spoken. I myseK am old ; and though I shall do what I 
 can on this side the grave, I cannot see the great day, except in 
 faith. But my children may witness at least its dawn." 
 
 " In those days, wars wiu cease," said Euphrosyne, recalling 
 the thoughts she had revolved on the day of the death of Moyse : 
 "there will be no bloodshed, no violence — no punishment of 
 injuries to others, while your people forgive their own." 
 
 " So will it be, I trust," said Toussaint. 
 
 " Why not, then, begin now ? Why not act upon your whole 
 principle at once P " 
 
 " Because the nature of the negro has been maimed. He has 
 been made selfish, cowardly, and indolent. He must be educated 
 back into a fair condition ; and this necessary education circum- 
 stances Lave imposed. We are compelled to the self-denial, 
 toil, and danger of warfare, in order to obtain the liberty which 
 ia to carry lis forward. I once hoped otherwise, Euphrosyne ; 
 but I now see the bracing process of defensive warfare to be 
 inevitable, and, on the whole, good for my people. Their liber- 
 ties, thus hardly won, will be prized, so as to shut out the future 
 danger of war. If, however, one stroke is inflicted for other 
 purposes than defence — ^if one life is taken for vengeance, we 
 shall be set back, long and far, in our career. It shall not be, 
 under my rule. Alas ! for those who succeed me, if they permit 
 it ! It will not ouly make the first black empire a by-word 
 throughout the worldj^but it will render the Christian civilisation 
 of my people difficult and slow." 
 
 Toussaint spoke like a ruler; and he was virtually still a 
 sovereign, as he had been for years past. Nor were the tokens 
 of sovereignty altogether wanting. At this moment, as was 
 continually happening, despatches arrived, on affairs of great 
 importance, on which be must think and act.

THE SICK-BED. 325 
 
 " See what these French commanders are doing," said he, 
 handing his letters to M. Pascal, " at the very moment that they 
 disclaim all intention of enslaving the negroes ! What are they 
 doing yonder but recommencing slaveiy ? It must not be. Are 
 you disposed for business ? " 
 
 _ " This moment," said M. Pascal, springing up before he had 
 finished tlie letters. " Will you provide a messenger ? Slavery 
 is restored ; and there is not a moment to be lost." 
 
 As in old days, lights were ordered into the library; and the 
 royal-souled negro dictated his commands to his friendly secre- 
 tary, who smiled, at such an hour, at the thought of the exulta- 
 tion of the French court over the "surrender" and "submission" 
 of the blacks. 
 
 CHAPTER XXXTI. 
 
 DBPARTUKE WITHOUT KETINrB. 
 
 " Stand where you are, Therese ; there, at the foot of the bed ! 
 Stir not an inch without my leave ? I have let you have your 
 own way too much of late. I call for hours, and you never 
 come. I will not let you out of my sight again ? " 
 
 So said M. Papalier in the delirium of his fever, as Madame 
 Dessalines was nursing him in his chamber at St. Marc. It was 
 a sad and dreary office ; but she had motive to go through with 
 it. The more he wandered back in his talk to the old days, the 
 more strongly she felt herself called upon to use the present 
 generously. The more imperious the tone of command with 
 which he addressed her, the more easily could she pass over 
 the error. There was a degree of pleasure in giving momentary 
 ease to him, while he could not recognise the hand that bestowed 
 it. She dreaded, however, for the sake of both, an hour of 
 sanity. If he slept for a short interval, she feared to hear him 
 speak coherently on his waking ; and the more because little or 
 no chance of his recovery remained. The thought of his carry- 
 ing forward into the hour of death the insolent temper of his life 
 was terrible. She almost hoped that, if he were to die, it would 
 be without having been aware that he and his nurse were no 
 longer master and slave. 
 
 She was his sole nurse. There was no alternative between 
 this and her not being with him at all. It was impossible to 
 allow any servant, any stranger, to hear his talk of old times — 
 to witness the mode in which he addressed her. Except the 
 physician, no one but herself entered his chamber during his 
 waking hours.

326 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 She now sat. as lie desired, full in his view, at the foot of the 
 bed, encouraging repose by her stillness, and gladly turning 
 from the ghastly countenance of the dying man to the scene 
 without — visible in all its splendour, as the room had a north 
 aspect, and the window stood wide, to admit the breathing wind 
 from the sea. The deep blue sea, under the heaven of a lighter 
 blue, looked glorious from the shaded apartment. The rustle of 
 the trees in the court-yard, and the fall of water there, spoke of 
 coolness, and seemed to make themselves heard by the patient 
 even in the midst of the fever-flames by which he was consumed, 
 for he spoke of trees and fountains, and fancied himseK at 
 Arable. He asked Therese to sing ; and told her what to sing. 
 She did not wish to refuse ; she would have indulged him ; but 
 there was a choking in her throat which forbade it. Papaher 
 was not long peremptoiy. From commanding, his voice sank 
 to complaining ; from complaining, to the muttering of troubled 
 slumber ; and, at length, into the silence of sleep. 
 
 Therese sat still, as before, looking out upon the sea, till its 
 brightness, combined with the whispers of foliage and waters, 
 made her eyes heavy, and disposed her to sleep too. Leaning 
 back against the bed-post, she was dreaming . that she was 
 awake, when she heard her name so called that she awoke with 
 a start. Papalier was himself again, and was demanding where 
 he was, and what had been the matter. He felt the blister on 
 his head ; he complained of the soreness and stifEuess of his 
 mouth and tongue; he tried to raise himself, and could not; 
 and, on the full discovery of his. state, he wept like a child. 
 
 Gently, but not tenderly, did Therese endeavour to comfort 
 him. He had irrecoverably forfeited her tenderness. Gentle, 
 however, she was, as she told him that his state now, however 
 painful, was better than an hour ago, when he was unconscious 
 of it. Gentle was her hand, when she wrapped fresh, cool leaves 
 round his burning head. Gentle was her voice, when she per- 
 suaded him to drink. Gentle was the expression of her eye, 
 when she fixed its gaze upon his face, and by its influence 
 caused him to check, like a child, the sobs that shook his frame. 
 
 "Thdrese," said he, "I am dying. I feel that I am dying. 
 Oh ! what must I do ? " 
 
 " We must wait upon God's pleasure. Let us wait in quiet. 
 Is there anything that can give you quiet of mind or body ? " 
 
 Tears stole again from the heavy, closing eyes. 
 
 '' We are all familiar with the end of our lives, almost from 
 their beginning," said Th&ese. " There is nothing strange or 
 surprising in it. The great thing is to throw ofE any burden — 
 any anxiety — and then to be still. An easy mind is the great 
 thing, whether recovery is at hand, or " 
 
 " Do not talk of recovery. I shall not recover."

PAPALIER CONFUSED. 327 
 
 " Can I do anything — listen to anything — so as to give you 
 ease P Shall I call father Gabriel ? You may find comfort in 
 speaking to him." 
 
 "I want to speak to you first. I have not half done the 
 business I came for : I have not half secured my estates for my 
 daughters." 
 
 "I believe yon have. I know' that L'Ouverture fully 
 intends " 
 
 " What does it matter what L'Ouverture intends ? I mean 
 no contempt to him by saying so. He intends very well, I dare 
 say ; but in the scramble and confusion that are at hand, what 
 chance will my poor orphan girls have for their rights ? " 
 
 " Fear nothing for them. If there is to be a struggle, there 
 is no doubt whatever as to how it will end. The French army 
 will be expelled " 
 
 " Ton do not say so ! Tou cannot think so ! " 
 
 " I am certain of it. But the white proprietors will be as safe 
 in person and property, as welcome to L'Ouverture, as during 
 the years of his full authority. Tou were not here to see it ; 
 but the white proprietors were very happy, perfectly satisfied, 
 during those years (at least, all of them who were reasonable 
 men). I can undertake for L'Ouverture that your daughters' 
 income from their estates shall be sent to them at Paris, if you 
 desire them to stay there ; or the estates shall be sold for their 
 benefit ; or, if yon wiU trust them to my care " 
 
 " No, no ! Impossible ! " 
 
 " I am the wife of a general, and second to uo woman in the 
 island," said Therese, calmly. " I have power to protect your 
 daughters ; and, in an hour like this, you cannot doubt my sin- 
 cerity when I say that I have the will." 
 
 " It cannot be, Therese. I do not doubt you — neither your 
 word nor your will. But it is impossible, utterly." 
 
 " Is there strength, even in the hour of death, to trample on 
 the dark race ? Oh ! better far to trample on the prejudices of 
 race ! Will you not do this ? " 
 
 '' Tou talk absurdly, Therese. Do not trouble me with non- 
 sense now. Tou wiU Tuidertake, you say, that Toussaiut shall 
 secure to my daughters the estates I have left to them by will. 
 That is, in case of the blacks getting the upper hand. If they 
 are put down, my will secures everything. HappUy, my will is 
 in safe hands. Speak, Therese. Tou engage for what I have 
 just said P " 
 
 "As far as warranted by my knowledge of L'Ouverture and 
 his intentions, I do. If, through his death or adversity, this 
 resource should fail, your daughters shaU. not suffer while my 
 husband and I have property." 
 
 " Tour husband ! property ! It is strange,'' muttered Papalier,

328 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " I believe you, however, I trust you, TherSse ; and I thank you, 
 love." 
 
 Th&ese started at that old word — that old name. Eecover- 
 ing herself, she inquired — 
 
 " Have you more to ask of me ? Is there any other service I 
 can render you ? " 
 
 "No, no. Ton have done too much for me — too much, con- 
 sidering the new order of affairs." 
 
 " I have something to ask of you. I require an answer to one 
 question." 
 
 " T'ou require ! " 
 
 " I do. By the right of an outraged mother, I require to 
 know who destroyed my chUd." 
 
 " Say nothing of that, Therese. Tou should know betterthan 
 to bring such subjects before a dying man." 
 
 " Such subjects lie before the dead. Better to meet them 
 prepared — atoned for, in as far as atonement is yet possible. 
 For your own sake, and by my own right, I require to be told 
 who destroyed my child P " 
 
 "I did not, Therese." 
 
 " Tou did not ! Is it possible ? Yet in this hour you could 
 not deceive me. I have accused you of the deed, from that hour 
 to this. Is it possible that I have wronged youV " 
 
 " I do not say that I disapproved of it — ^that I did not allow 
 it. But I did not do it." 
 
 " Then you know who did it ? " 
 
 " Of course I do." 
 
 " Who was it ? " 
 
 " I swore long ago that I would not tell ; and I never will. 
 But you may lay the blame on me, my dear ; for, as I told you, 
 I permitted the deed. It was necessary. Our lives depended 
 on it." 
 
 " May you not find your eternal death depend on it ! " said 
 Thferese, agonised by suspicions as to whose hand it was by 
 which her child had died. In a moment, she formed a resolve 
 which she never broke — never again to seek to know that 
 which Papalier- now refused to tefl. A glance at the counte- 
 nance before her filled her with remorse the next instant, at 
 what now seemed the cruel words she had just spoken. 
 
 " Let me bring Father Gabriel to you," said she. " He will 
 give you whatever comfort God permits." 
 
 " Do not suppose I shall tell Father Gabriel what you want to 
 discover," replied Papalier. " He has no business with more 
 than my share of the affair : which is what you know already. 
 i am too weak to talk — to Father Gabriel, or any one else." 
 
 " But you need comfort. Tou will rest better afterwards." 
 
 " Well, well ; in the evening, perhaps. I must be quiet now

DEATH. 329 
 
 Comfort, indeed ! " he muttered. " Tes, I want comfort enougli, 
 in the horrid condition I am in. But there is no comfort till 
 one lies dead. I wish I were dead." 
 
 He fell into a restless doze. Moved by Ms misery and melted 
 by the thought that she had wronged him, all these years, by 
 harbouring the image of his hand on her infant's throat- 
 distracted, too, by the new doubts that had arisen — Therese 
 prayed and wept, wept and prayed, on behalf of Papalier and 
 all sinners. Again and again she implored that these wretched 
 hatreds, these miserable strifes, might be all hushed iu the grave, 
 — ^might be whoUy dissolved in death. 
 
 She was just stealing to the door, intending to send for Father 
 Gabriel, that he might be in readiness for the dying man's con- 
 fession, when Papalier started, cast his eyes round the room 
 hurriedly, and exclaimed — 
 
 " It is in vain to talk of attaching them. If one's eye is ofE 
 
 them for one moment Oh ! you are there, Therese ! I thought, 
 
 after all I had done for you — after all I had spent upon you — 
 
 I thought you would not go off with the rest. Don't go 
 
 Therese— Therese ! " 
 
 " I am here," said she, perceiving that he no longer saw. 
 
 " I know you would stay," he said, very faintly. "I cannot 
 spare you, my dear." 
 
 The last words he said were — 
 
 " I cannot spare you — remember — Therese ! " 
 
 To the pang of the thought that he had died unconfessed 
 succeeded the question, more painful still — 
 
 "Could religious offices avaU anything to a soul wholly un- 
 sanctified ? Is there a promise that any power can put such a 
 spirit into immediate congeniality with the temper of Heaven ? 
 Among the many mansions, is there one which would not be a 
 prison to such ? — to the proud one who must there feel himself 
 ' poor and miserable, and blind and naked P ' " 
 
 CHAPTER XXXVII. 
 
 JUNE. 
 
 Of the letters written by Toussaint and Pascal on the evening 
 when news arrived of the imposition of compulsory labour on the 
 negroes, some reached their destination ; but one did not. That 
 one was to L'Ouverture's aide, Fontaine, at Cap Pran9ais. It 
 contained the following : — 
 
 " It is said that General Leclerc is in a bad state of health at

 Tortuga. Of this you will inform me. If you see the Captain- 
 General, be sure to tell him that the cultivators are uo longer 
 disposed to obey me, for the planters wish to set them to work 
 at Herioourt ; which they certainly ought not to do. 
 
 " I have to ask you whether any one near the person of the 
 
 Oaptain-General can be gained to procure the release of D , 
 
 who would be very useful to me from his influence at La Nou- 
 velle, and elsewhere. 
 
 " Acquaint Gingembre that he is not to quit the Borgne, 
 where the cultivators must not be set to work." 
 
 This letter never reached Fontaine, but was, instead, mada 
 the subject of a consultation in the Oaptain-G«neral's quarters. 
 Amidst the boastings which he sent home, and by which Prance 
 was amused, Leclerc felt that his thirty-five thousand soldiers 
 had made uo progress whatever in the real conquest of St. 
 Domingo. He was aware that Prance had less power there than 
 before she had alienated L'Ouverture. He felt that Toussaint 
 was stm the sovereign that he had been for ten years past. He 
 knew that a glance of the eye, a lifting of the hand, from Tous- 
 saint, wrought more than sheaves of ordinances from himseU', 
 and all the commendations and flatteries of the First Consul. 
 Leclerc, and the officers in his confidence, could never take a 
 morning ride, or give an evening party — they could never hear 
 a negro singing, or amuse themselves with children, playing on 
 the shore or in the woods, without being reminded that ther 
 were intruders, and that the native and abundant loyalty of the 
 inhabitants was all for their L'Ouverture, now that France had 
 put him in opposition to herseK. Leclerc and his confidential 
 advisers committed the error of attributing aU this to Tous- 
 saint's personal qualities; and they drew the false inference 
 (most acceptable to the First Consul) that if Toussaint were 
 out of the way, all would be well for the purposes of Prance. 
 Having never seriously regarded the blacks as free men and 
 fellow-citizens, these Frenchmen omitted to perceive that a 
 great part of their devotion to Toussaint was loyalty to their 
 race. Proceeding on this mistake, Leclerc and his council, 
 sanctioned by the First Consul, ruined their work, lost their 
 object, and brought irretrievable disgrace upon their names — 
 some of which are immortalised only by the infamy of the act 
 which ensued. 
 
 From day to day, they endeavoured to entrap Toussaint ; but 
 he knew it, surrounded as he was by faithful and vig^ant friends. 
 Day by day he was warned of an ambush hero, of spies there, or 
 of an attempt meditated for such an horn-. During a fortnight of 
 incessant designs upon his person, he so bafiBled all attempts 
 as to induce a sort of suspicion among the French soldiery that 
 he was protected by magic.

IN PERIL. 331 
 
 It was an anxious season for Ms family. Their only comfort 
 was that it would soon bo over ; that this, like all other evils 
 connected with the invasion, was to last only '■ till August ; " 
 the familiar words which were the talisman of hope thi'oughout 
 the island. The household at Pongaudin counted the days till 
 August ; but it was yet only the beginning of June ; and the 
 season passed heavily away. On one occasion, a faithful ser- 
 vant of Toussaint's was brought in dead — shot from a thicket 
 which his master was expected to pass. On another, the road 
 home was believed to be beset ; and all the messengers sent by 
 the family to warn him of his danger were detained on some 
 frivolous pretext ; and the household were at length relieved by 
 his appearing from the garden, having returned in a boat pro- 
 vided by some of his scouts. Now and then, some one mentioned 
 retiring to the mountains ; but Tonssaint would not hear of it. 
 He said it would be considered a breach of the treaty, and 
 would forfeit all the advantages to be expected from a few 
 weeks' patience. The French were, he knew, daily more en- 
 feebled and distracted by sickness. Caution and patience, for 
 two months more, would probably secure freedom without blood- 
 shed. He had foreseen that the present perils would arise from 
 the truce ; and still believed that it had better not have been 
 made. But, as he had agreed to it, the first breach should not 
 be on his part. 
 
 If Toiissaint owed his danger to Ohristophe, he owed him the 
 protection by which he had thus far been preserved. "Worn as 
 he was by perpetual labour and anxiety, Henri seemed never 
 to close his eyes in sleep during this anxious season. He felt 
 to the full his responsibility, from the hour of the first discovery 
 of Fi-ench treachery towards his friend. By day, he was scour- 
 ing the country in the direction of Toussaint's rides. By night, 
 he was patrolling round the estate. It seemed as if his eye 
 pierced the deepest shades of the woods ; as if his ear caught up 
 whispers from the council-chamber in Tortuga. For Henri's 
 sake, Toussaint ran no risks but such as duty absolutely re- 
 quired ; for Henri's sake, he freely accepted these toils on his 
 behalf. He knew it to be essential to Henri's future peace that 
 his personal safety should be preserved through this season, and 
 that Henri himself should be his chief guardian. 
 
 Henri himself did not ask him to give up his rides. It was 
 necessary that his people should have almost daily proof that 
 he was among them, safe and free. It was necessary that the 
 French should discern no symptom of fear, of shrinking, of de- 
 parture from the mode of life he had pi'oposed on retiring to his 
 estate. Almost daily, therefore, he rode ; and exhilarating did 
 he find the rapid exercise, the danger, and, above aU, the know- 
 ledge he gained of the condition of his people, in fortunes and

 in mind, and the confidence with which they hailed him, the 
 constancy with which they appealed to his authority, wherever 
 he appeared. 
 
 This knowledge enabled him to keep up more than the show 
 of co-operation with the French in matters which concerned the 
 welfare of the people. He pointed out gross abuses ; and Leclerc 
 hastened to remedy them. Leclerc consulted him occasionally 
 in local afEairs, and had his best advice. This kind of corre- 
 spondence, useful and innocent, could not have been carried on 
 to equal purpose but for Toussaint's rides. 
 
 By such excursions he verified a cause of complaint, concern- 
 ing which he had received applications at home. In dispersing 
 his troops over the colony, Leclerc had taken care to quarter a 
 very large proportion in the districts near Gonaives, so as to 
 enclose the residence of Toussaint with the best of the French 
 forces. The canton of Henneri was overcharged with these 
 troops ; so that the inhabitants were oppressed, and the soldiers 
 themselves suffered from scarcity of food, and from the fever 
 which raged in their crowded quarters. Having ascertained this 
 to be the fact, Toussaint wrote to represent the case to Leclerc, 
 and received a speedy and favourable reply. By Leclerc's com- 
 mand. General Brunet wrote that this was an affair which came 
 within his department ; that he was necessarily ignorant of the 
 localities of St. Domingo, and of their respective resources ; and 
 that he should be thankful for information and guidance from 
 one who had a perfect knowledge of these circumstances. He 
 proposed that General Toussaint should meet him in the centre 
 of the canton of Henneri, and instruct him concerning tha better 
 distribution of the troops. 
 
 " See these whites ! " said Toussaint, handing the letter to 
 M. Pascal. " Till they find they are wrong, they have no mis- 
 givings ; they know everything ; and they are obliged at last to 
 come, and learn of old Toussaint." 
 
 " Tou will not meet General Brunet, as he proposes," said M. 
 Pascal. " Tou will not place yourseK in the centre of the canton, 
 among their troops ? " 
 
 " No, no i you will not ! You will not think of going ! " cried 
 Madame L'Ouverture. 
 
 " For once, Margot, you bear ill-will towards those who com- 
 pliment your husband," said Toussaint, smiling. " But be easy; 
 I shall not go to the canton of Henneri. If I walk into a 
 pitfall, it shall not be after having seen it made. I must meet 
 General Brunet, however. I shall invite him here with an escort 
 of twenty soldiers ; promising to limit my own guard to that 
 number." 
 
 " He will not come," said M. Pascal. 
 
 " I think he will ; not because they trust me, for they know

A CONSULTATION. 333 
 
 not what trust is ; but because I could gain nothing by any 
 injury to General Brunet and twenty soldiers that could com- 
 pensate for a breach of the treaty." 
 
 " The gain, from capture or violence, would be all the other 
 way, certainly," said Pascal, in a low voice. 
 
 " Henri will take care that General Brunet's is bond fide an 
 escort of twenty. There is reason for the meeting taking place 
 here. Maps will be wanted, and other assistance which we might 
 not remember to provide elsewhere. General Bi-unet must be 
 my guest ; and Madame L'Ouverture wUl make him admire our 
 hospitality." 
 
 General Brunet immediately accepted the invitation, pro- 
 mising to present himself at Pongaudin on the tenth of June. 
 
 CHAPTER XXXVni. 
 
 Geneeai Beunet brought with him no more than his allotted 
 twenty soldiers, and a secretary. Ohristophe ascertained to his 
 own satisfaction, and let the household know, that not another 
 French soldier breathed within a circuit of some miles, when the 
 evening closed in ; so that the ladies threw ofE constraint and 
 fear together as the two generals, with their secretaries, retired 
 to the library, after coffee. 
 
 Placide hsid been with Ohristophe all day, and was thermeans 
 by which the household had been assured of the tranquUlity of 
 the neighbourhood. He was of the patrol which was to watch 
 the roads during the night. It seemed improbable, however, that, 
 of all nights, that should be chosen for an assault when the 
 Ouvertures must be particularly roused to observation, and when 
 a French general was in their hands. Of all nights, this was 
 probably the safest ; yet Placide, glad, perhaps, of an excuse to 
 keep out of the way of a guest from Paris, chose to mount guard 
 with Ohristophe. 
 
 Denis was permitted to be in the library, as the business was 
 not private, and, to one who knew the country as well as he did, 
 very entertaining. For a time he found it so, while all the five 
 were stooping over the maps, and his father was explaining the 
 nature of the localities, and the interests of the inhabitants, and 
 while words dropped from General Brunet which gave an insight 
 into that object of Denis's strong curiosity — the French encamp- 
 ment on Tortuga. When all of this kind had been said, and 
 the cpjivprsation turned upon points of military science or

 management, -whioli he did not care about, Denis drew off to the 
 window, and thence into the balcony, where he looked ont upon the 
 night — vainly, for it was cloudy, and there was yet no moon. The 
 air was cool and pleasant, however, and he remained leaning over 
 the balcony, revolving what he had heard, and picturing to 
 himself the little court of Madame Leclerc — so near, and yet 
 Gilt of his reach. "While thus absorbed, it is probable that some 
 distant voice of song instigated him to sing also. Like his race 
 generally, Denis was almost always singing ; always when alone 
 and meditative. It is probable that some notes of the air sung 
 by those who looked to August for freedom — sung by the whole 
 negro population — now caught his ear ; for he began, hardly to 
 sing, but to murmur this popular air. The words were not heard 
 withiu ; and it would not have mattered if they had been ; for 
 the words were in the negro language. But the air was, by this 
 time, intelligible enough to the invaders. In the interest of 
 conversation, nothing escaped the eye of Toussaint. He saw an 
 exchange of glances between General Brunet and his secretary, 
 and a half smile on the face of each which he did not like. 
 
 He thought it best to take no notice ; but, far from leaving 
 ofP, Denis sang louder as he sank deeper into reverie. M. Pascal 
 became aware of some embarrassment, and of its cause. 
 
 " Denis, you disturb us," he called out from the table. 
 
 They heard no more of Denis ; and their business proceeded. 
 Vexed, partly with himself, and partly at having been rebuked 
 in General Brunet's hearing, he went round the house by the 
 balcony, and thence to the upper gallery, which commanded the 
 finest sea view in the day-time, and the freshest sea breezes at 
 night. There, in a somewhat perverse mood, he sang for his 
 own pleasure the air which he had been checked for singing 
 unconsciously. He remained there a long while — he did not 
 know how long — tiU the moon rose, when he remembered that it 
 must be midnight. As no one had called him, he supposed that 
 the party in the library were still in consultation. 
 
 As his eye rested on the bay, while he was considering whether 
 he must not go in, he perceived something dark lying on tlie 
 waters between the is^aid and the shore. As he strained his 
 sight, and as the waned moon rose higher, he discovered that it 
 was a ship. It was strange. No ship ever had business there; 
 though he had heard that there was a deep channel, and good 
 anchorage in that little bay. It was very strange. But some- 
 thing stranger still soon met his ear — sounds, first odd, then 
 paindEul — horrible. There was some bustle below — on the beach, 
 within the little gate — he thought even on the lawn. It was a 
 scufiBe ; there was a stifled cry. He feared the guard were dis- 
 armed and gagged — attacked on the side of the sea, where no one 
 dreamed of an assault, and where there was no Christophe to

ARRESTED. 335 
 
 help. Denis knew, lioweyer, how to reach Christophe. He did 
 the right thing. Lest his purpose should be prevented if he 
 entered the house, he clambered up the roof to its ridge, and 
 swung the heavy alarm-bell. Its irregular clang banished sleep 
 in a moment from a circuit of many miles. It not only startled 
 the ladies of the family from their beds ; but every fisherman 
 rushed from his hut upon the shore. Christophe and Placide 
 were galloping to Pongaudin almost before they had drawn a 
 breath. Every beast stirred in its lair ; and every bird rustled 
 in its roost. .Rapid, however, as was the spread of sound, it was 
 too late to save L'Ouverture. 
 
 L'Ouverture himself had but a few moments of uncertainty 
 to endure. In the midst of earnest conversation, suspicious 
 sounds were heard. The two Frenchmen rushed to the door of 
 the library, and M. Pascal to the balcony. M. Pascal re-entered 
 in an instant, saying — 
 
 " The house is surrounded — the lawn is crowded. Make no 
 resistance, and they may spare your life." 
 
 " Hark ! The bell ! There is hope," said Toussaint. " No 
 resistance ! but let us gain time." 
 
 The door was burst open, and with General Brunet entered a 
 personage whom he introduced as Admiral Ferrari, followed by 
 a file of grenadiers. 
 
 " What can be your errand at this hour ? " asked Toussaint. 
 
 "I have orders from the Captain-General to arrest you," 
 replied Admiral Ferrari. "Tour guards are disarmed and 
 bound. Our ti'oops are everywhere. Ton are dead if you 
 resist. Deliver up your sword!" 
 
 " I shall not resist such a force as you have thought it neces- 
 sary to bring against me," replied Toussaint, handing his sword 
 to the admiral. "Am I to be a prisoner here, in my own 
 house P " 
 
 " No, indeed ! I have orders to convey you and your family 
 to Cap Frangais. No delay ! To the boats this moment ! Tou 
 will find your family on board the frigate, or on the way to it." 
 
 " Do what you wiU with me ; but Madame L'Ouverture is iu 
 weak health. Suffer her and my children to remain at home." 
 
 "Lose no more time. General. March! orwe must carry you." 
 
 Voices of lamentation and of passion were heard in the cor- 
 ridor, which quickened L'Ouverture's movements more than 
 threats or insults could have done. He left the library, and 
 found the ladies of the household in the corridor — Margot 
 weeping and trembling, and Genifrede addressing M. Coasson 
 in a tone of high anger. 
 
 " Ton here ! M. Coasson ! " said Toussaint ; " and availing 
 yourself once more of the weakness and woes of women, I 
 perceive."

3^6 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " I came as guide," replied M. Ooasson. " The admiral and 
 his troops needed some one to show them the way; and, as you 
 are aware, I was qualified to do so. I have always felt, too, 
 that I had a sort of appointment to fulfil with this young lady. 
 Her kind expressions towards the whites on my last visit might 
 be considered a sort of invitation to come again — with such a 
 train as you see," pointing to the stiff row of grenadiers who 
 stood beluud. 
 
 Genifrede groaned. 
 
 " Make yourself happy with your train," said Toussaint, as 
 he seized the wretch by the collar, hurled him back among the 
 grenadiers, and kicked him over as he lay, introducing great 
 disorder into the formal arrangements of that dignified 
 guard. 
 
 This would have been the last moment of Toussaint, if 
 General Brunet had not drawn his sword, and commanded 
 every one to stand back. His orders, he said, were to deliver 
 his prisoner alive. 
 
 " Come, my love," said Toussaint to Madame L'Ouvertnre. 
 " We are to sleep on board a frigate this night. Come, Geni- 
 frede ! We may sleep in peace. General Brunet wiU hardly 
 be able to digest your hospitality, my Margot; but yov, may 
 sleep. Who else ? " he asked, as he looked round upon his 
 trembling household. 
 
 " We are following," said M. Pascal, who had his wife and 
 Euphrosyne on either arm. 
 
 " Pardon me," said General Brunet. " Our orders extend 
 only to General Toussaint and his family. Tou must remain. 
 Reverend father," he said to Father Laxabon, " you will remain 
 also — to comfort any friends of General Toussaint whom you 
 may be able to meet with to-morrow. They will be all incon- 
 solable, no doubt." 
 
 M. Ooasson whispered to the admiral, who said, in conse- 
 quence, bowing to Euphrosyne — 
 
 " I can answer for this young lady being a welcome guest to 
 Madame Leolerc. If she will afford to a countryman the pleasure 
 and honour of conveying her, it will give him joy to introduce 
 her to a society worthy of her." 
 
 "I do not wish to see Madame Leclerc," said Euphrosyne, 
 speaking with surprising calmness, though her cheek was white 
 as ashes. " I wish to be wherever I may best testify my attach, 
 ment to these my honoured friends, in the day of their unde- 
 served adversity." 
 
 She looked from M. Pascal to L'Onverture. 
 
 " Stay with those who can be your guardians," said Toussaint. 
 
 " For our sakes," added Genifrede. 
 
 " Stay with us ! " cried M. Pascal and Af ra.

" THE COUNTRY IS UP." 33/ 
 
 " Farewell, then," said Eupkrosyne, extending her arms to 
 Madame L'Ouverture. 
 
 '' We are losing time," said General Brunet, as the clang of 
 the alarm-bell was heard again. By his order, some soldiers 
 went in search of the traitor who was ringing the hell; and 
 others pushed the captive family before them towards the door. 
 M. Ooasson thrust himself between the parting friends, and 
 began to count the family, in order to tell who was missing. It 
 would not do, he observed, to leave any behind. 
 
 " Lose no more time," said the admiral. " Those who may 
 be left behind are cared for, I promise you. We have a hundred 
 of them safe already." 
 
 " A hundred of whom ? " asked Toussaint, as he walked. 
 
 " Of your friends," replied Admiral Ferrari. 
 
 This was too true. A hundred of Toussaint's most attached 
 adherents had been seized this night. No one of them was ever 
 again heard of in the island. 
 
 At the door of the mansion Denis was brought forward, 
 guarded. His eyes were flashing fire. 
 
 " The country is up ! " he cried. " I got good service out of 
 the old bell before they found me." 
 
 " Right, my boy ! Thank you !" said his father, cheerfully. 
 
 " Give Genifrede to me, father. My mother is ready to sink." 
 
 Proudly he supported his sister to the boats, carrying her 
 on so rapidly as to prevent the need of any soldier speaking to 
 her. 
 
 There was an array of boats along the shore of the bay. Dis- 
 tant firing was heard during the whole time that the prisoners 
 and the troops were embarking. 
 
 " They must be very much afraid of us,'' observed Denis, 
 looking round, as soon as he had taken his place beside his sister 
 in the boat. " They have given us above a hundred guards, 
 I believe." 
 
 "They are afraid of us," said Toussaint. 
 
 "There is terrible fighting somewhere," murmured the weep- 
 ing Margot. " I am afraid Placide is in the midst of it." 
 
 " He is in his duty if he be," said Toussaint. 
 
 Placide had discharged this kind of duty, however, and now 
 appeared to fulfil the other — of sharing the captivity of his 
 parents. He leaped into the boat, breathless, after it had pushed 
 ofE from the shore. 
 
 " In time, thank God ! " gasped he. 
 
 " He can hardly speak ! " exclaimed his mother. " He is wet ! 
 He is wounded — cruelly wounded ! " 
 
 " Not wounded at all, mother. Whole in heart and skin ! 
 I am soaked in the blood of our enemies. We have fought glc- 
 riously — in vain, however, for to-night. Latortue is shot ; and

 Jasmin. There are few left but Christophe ; but he is fighting 
 like a lion." 
 
 " "Why did you leave him, my son .P " asked Toussaint. 
 
 " He desired me to come, again and again, and I fought on. 
 At last I was cut ofE from him. I could not give any more help 
 there; and I saw that my business lay here. They say this 
 frigate is the Creole. Whither bound, I wonder ? " 
 
 " To Cap Fran9ais," replied the officer in the stern : " to join 
 the HSros, now in the roads there." 
 
 "The Heros — a seTenty-four, I think," said L'Onverture. 
 
 "A seventy-four — you are correct," replied the of^eer. No 
 one spoke again. 
 
 CHAPTER XXXIX. 
 
 TEXrCE NO MOBE. 
 
 When Toussaint set foot on the deck of the Heros, on the 
 evening of the next day, the commander stood ready to receive 
 him — and not only the commander. Soldiers also stood ready 
 with chains, with which they lost no time in fettering the old 
 man's ankles and wrist-s. While they were doing this, Tons- 
 saint qmietly said to the commander — 
 
 " By my overthrow, the trunk of the tree of negro liberty is 
 laid low ; only the trunk. It will shoot out again from the 
 roots ; and they are many and deep." 
 
 The moment the soldiers stepped back, and allowed access to 
 him, Aimee was in his arms ; and Isaac, in great agitation, pre- 
 sented himself. 
 
 " I will never leave you more, father ! " said he. " These 
 fetters ! Nothing should have made me believe such treatment 
 possible. I trusted Leclerc as firmly as I trusted you. I have 
 been living with him while he meditated chains for you. I am 
 humbled for ever ! All I can do now is to devote myself to 
 you, as Placide did at the right time. Would I were Placide ! 
 I am humbled for ever ! " 
 
 " No, my son: not for ever. It is a common lot to be humbled 
 for the credulous canfidence of youth. It is a safer and a 
 nobler error, Isaac, than its opposite. It is better than unbelief 
 in the virtue of man." 
 
 " Tou torture me with your goodness, father ! " 
 
 " I deal with you as with myself, Isaac. In the young days 
 of my freedom I trusted falsely, as you have done. I believed

 in Bonaparte, as yon have believed in Leelere. "We have both 
 received a lesson ; but I do not feel humbled for ever; nor must 
 you." 
 
 " "Would I were Placide ! " was all that Isaac could say. 
 
 " Tou are so good to Isaac and me," said Aimee, timidly, 
 "that perhaps you would (could you P) see Yincent." 
 
 " No, my child. Vincent is not like Isaac. He cannot be 
 made wise by experience ; and his folly is scarcely to be distin- 
 guished from treachery. I cannot see General Vincent." 
 
 No choice was allowed, however. Vincent rushed forward, 
 knelt before Toussaint, and clasped his knees, imploring, in a 
 convulsion of grief, pardon for the past, and permission to devote 
 every hour of his future life to the family whom he had 
 ruined. 
 
 " My pardon you have," said L'Ouverture. " I should rather 
 say my compassion; for you never deHberately designed 
 treachery, I am persuaded." 
 
 " I never did ! I never did ! " 
 
 " Neither had yon any good design. Tou have been selfish, 
 vain, and presumptuous; as far from comprehending my pur- 
 poses as from having criminal ones of your own. In the new 
 circumstances in which negroes are placed, many must fall, 
 however firmly some may stand. Tou are among the infirm ; 
 and therefore, however I may mourn, I do not resent what you 
 have done." 
 
 " Thank God ! Tou pardon me ! Thank God ! Henceforth, 
 with Aimee to watch over me — with you to guide me " 
 
 " No, Vincent ! Tou cannot be with me. Aimee is free as 
 she has ever been ; but you cannot be with me. I go to mar- 
 tyrdom : to fulfil what appears to be the solemn vocation of the 
 Ouvertures. I go to martyrdom ; and none but steady souls 
 must travel that way with me." 
 
 " Tou scorn me," said Vincent, springing from his knees. 
 " Tour acts show that you scorn me. Ton take that poor fellow," 
 pointing to Mars Plaisir, " and you reject me." 
 
 " My son's servant," said Toussaint, smiling. " He goes to 
 his beloved France, free to quit us for any other service, when 
 ours becomes too grave for his light spirit. I would not insult 
 you by taking you on a like condition. Tou must leave us, 
 Vincent," pointing to the Creoles boat, now about to put off 
 from the Seros. " We wiU pray for you. Farewell ! " 
 
 " Aimee ! " said her lover, scarcely daring to raise his eyes 
 to her face. 
 
 " Farewell, Vincent ! " Aim^e strove to say. 
 
 In vain Vincent endeavoured to plead. Aimee shook 
 her head, signed to him to go, and hid her face on her 
 father's shoulder. It was too much. Humbled to the point

 of exasperation, Vincent threw himself over the ship's side iato 
 the boat, and never more saw the face of an Onverture. 
 
 " I have nothing left hut you," sobbed Aimee — " but you and 
 my mother. If they kiU you my mother will die, and I shall 
 be desolate." 
 
 " Tour brothers, my child." 
 
 " No, no. I have tried all. I left you to try. I loved you 
 always ; but I thought I loved others more. But " 
 
 " But," said her father, when she could not proceed, " you 
 found the lot of woman. To woman the affections are all : to 
 men, even to brothers, they are not. Courage, Aimee ! Courage ! 
 for you are an Ouvertnre. Courage to meet your woman's 
 martyrdom ! " 
 
 " Let me rest upon your heart, father ; and I can bear any- 
 thing." 
 
 "Would I could, my child! But they will not allow it— 
 these jailors. They will part us.'' 
 
 " I wish these chains could bind me too — these very links — 
 that I might never leave you," cried Aim^e, kissing the fetters 
 which bound her father's arms. 
 
 " Tour mother's heart, Aimee ; that remains." 
 
 " I wiU keep it from breaking, father, trust me." 
 
 And the mother and daughter tasted something like happiness, 
 even in an hour like this, in their re-union. It was a strange 
 kind of comfort to Aimee to hear from her mother how long ago 
 her father had foreseen, at Pongaudin, that the day might come 
 when her heart would be torn between her lover and her family. 
 The impending blow had been struck — the struggle had taken 
 place : and it only remained now to endure it. 
 
 " Father ! " said Genifrede, appealing to Toussaint, with a 
 grave countenance, "you say that none but brave and steady 
 soials must go with you on your way to martyrdom. Tou know 
 me to be cowardly as a slave, and unstable as yonder boat now 
 tossing on the waves. Do you see that boat, father ? " 
 
 " Surely — yes ; it is Paul ; " said Toussaint, looking through 
 his glass. " Paul is coming to say farewell." 
 
 " Let me return with him, father. Let me become his child. 
 I am unworthy to be yours. And he and I are so forlorn ! " 
 
 Her father's tender gaze encouraged her to say more. Draw- 
 ing closer, she whispered — 
 
 "I have seen Moyse — I have seen him more than once in the 
 Morne ; and I caimot leave this place. Let me stay." 
 
 " Stay, my child. Seek consolation in your own way. We 
 will aU pray for you ; we will all console your mother for your 
 absence. We shall not meet again on earth, Genifrede." 
 
 " I know it, father. But the time of rest — ^how long it is in 
 coming ! "

THR CONCEALED TREASURE. 34 1 
 
 " My child, our rest is in the soiil — it lies not either in place 
 or time. Do not look for it in the grave, unless you have it fii-st 
 in the soul." 
 
 " Then would I had never been bom ! " 
 
 " How different will be your cry when you have been a 
 daughter to Paul for a while ! When you see him consoled, and 
 reposing upon your care, you will say, ' I thank God that I have 
 lived for this ! ' A g^eat duty lies before you, my dear child ; 
 and in the heart of duty lies rest — a deeper than that of the 
 grave. Shall I give you a duty to discharge for me ? " 
 
 " Oh, yes ! I will take it as your blessing." 
 
 " Convey to Christophe my last message. Bid him rejoice for 
 mo that my work is done. My work is now his. Bid him 
 remember how we always agreed that freedom is safe. I bequeath 
 the charge of it to him, with my blessing." 
 
 " He shall know this, if he lives, before the moon rises." 
 
 "If he does not live, let Dessalines hear what was my 
 message to Christophe. He will know how miich to take to 
 hiraseli." 
 
 It was well that this message was given without further delay. 
 Toussaint was summoned to speak with some officers of Leclerc's 
 council, in the cabin below. At the clank of his chains upon 
 the deck all eyes were upon him, except those of his ovfn family, 
 which were turned away in grief. 
 
 " Before your departure," said one of the officers, in the small 
 cabin to which Toussaint was conducted, " we would urge you 
 to do a service to the colony which yet remains in your power. 
 Ton must not refuse this last service." 
 
 " I have never refused to serve the colony ; and I am as willing 
 to-day as ever." 
 
 " JCfo doubt. Reveal to us, then, the spot in the Momes du 
 Chaos, in which your treasures lie buried, and state their 
 amount." 
 
 " I have before said that I have buried no treasures. Do you 
 disbelieve my word ? " 
 
 " We are sorry to do so ; but facts are against you. Tou 
 cannot deceive us. We know that you caused certain of your 
 dependents to bury treasure near the Plateaux de la Ravine ; 
 and that you afterwards shot these servants, to secure your 
 secret." 
 
 "Is it possible?" 
 
 " Tou see we have penetrated your counsels. The time for 
 concealment is past. Tou take your family with you ; and none 
 of you will ever return. Tour friends are, most of them, disposed 
 of. A new order of things has commenced. Tou boast of your 
 patriotism. Show it now by giving up the treasure of the colony 
 to the uses of the colony."

342 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " I have already devoted my all to tlie colony. I reply once 
 more that I leave behind me no treasure but that wHoh jou 
 cannot appreciate — the grateful hearts of my people." 
 
 The investigation was pressed — the inquiry made, under every 
 form of appeal that could be devised ; and in vain. Toussaint 
 disdained to repeat his reply; and he spoke no more. The 
 officers left him with threats on their lips. The door was locked 
 and barred behind them, and Toussaint found himself a solitary 
 prisoner. 
 
 During the night the vessel got under weigh. What at that 
 hour were the secrets which lay hid in the mountain-passes, the 
 forest-shades, and the sad homes of the island whose true ruler 
 was now borne away from its shores ? 
 
 Pongaudin was already deserted. Monsieur and Madame 
 Pascal had, by great activity, obtained a passage for France in 
 the ship which was freighted with Leclerc's boastings of his 
 crowning feat. They were already far on the sea before the 
 Ileros spread its sails. Leclerc's announcement of Toussaint's 
 overthrow was as follows : — 
 
 " I intercepted letters which he had written to one Fontaiue, 
 who was his agent at Cap Prangais. These afEorded an un- 
 answerable proof that he was engaged in a conspiracy, and that 
 he was anxious to regain his former influence in the colony. He 
 waited only for the result of disease among the troops. 
 
 "Under these circumstances, it would be improper to give 
 him time to mature his criminal designs. I ordered him to be 
 apprehended — a difficult task; but it succeeded through the 
 excellent arrangements made by General Brunet, who was en- 
 trusted with its execution, and the zeal and ardour of Admiral 
 Perrari. 
 
 "I am sending to Prance, with all his family, this deeply 
 perfidious man, who, by his consummate hypocrisy has done us 
 so much mischief. The government will determine how it should 
 dispose of him. 
 
 " The apprehension of General Toussaint occasions some dis- 
 turbances. Two leaders of the insurgents are already in custody, 
 and I have ordered them to be shot. About a hundred of his 
 confidential partisans have been secured, of whom some are on 
 board the Muiron frigate, which is under orders for the Mediter- 
 ranean ; and the rest are distributed among the different ships of 
 the squadron. 
 
 " I am daily occupied in settling the affairs of the colony, with 
 the least possible inconvenience : but the excessive heat, and the 
 diseases which attack us, render it an extremely painful task. 
 I am impatient for the approach of the month of September, 
 when the season will renovate our activity.

 " The departure of Toussaint has produced general joy at Cap 
 Francais. 
 
 " The Oonmdssary of Justice, Mont Peson, is dead. The 
 Colonial Prefect, Benezeoh, is breathing his last. The Adjutant- 
 Commandant, Dampier, is dead: he was a young officer of great 
 promise. 
 
 " I have the honour, &c. 
 
 (Signed) " Leclebc." 
 
 On board the vessel which carried these tidings was Pascal, 
 prepared to give a different version of the late transactions, and 
 revolving, with Afra, the means by which he might best employ 
 such influence as he had on behalf of his friend. Theirs was a 
 nearly hopeless errand, they well knew; but the less hopeful, 
 the more anxious were they to do what they could. 
 
 Was Euphrosyne with them? — "So. She never forgot the 
 duty which she had set before her — to stay near Le Bosquet, in 
 hopes of better times, when she might make reparation to the 
 people of the estate for what they had suffered at her grand- 
 father's hands. A more pressing duty also detained her on the 
 island. She could be a daughter to M. Raymond in Af ra's stead, 
 and thus make their duty easier to the Pascals. Among the 
 lamentations and prayers which went up from the mourning 
 island were those of the old man and the young girl who wept 
 together at Le Zephyr — scarcely attempting yet to forgive the 
 enemies whose treachery had outraged thp Deliverer — as he was 
 henceforth called, more fondly than ever. They were not wholly 
 wretched. They dwelt on the siirprise and pleasure it would be 
 to the Ouvertures to find the Pascals in France before them. 
 Euphrosyne had also the satisfaction of doing something, how- 
 ever indirectly, for her unfortunate friends; and she really 
 enjoyed the occupation, to her so familiar, and still so dear, of 
 ministering to the comfort of an old man, who had no present 
 dependence but on her. 
 
 Her cares and duties were soon increased. The habitations of 
 the Plain du Nord became so disgusting and so dangerous as the 
 pestilence strewed the land with dead, and the survivors of the 
 French army became, in proportion to the visitation, desperate 
 and savage, that Madame Oge was, at length, like all her 
 neighbours, driven from her home. She wished to take refuge 
 with one of her own colour ; and M. Raymond, at Euphrosyne's 
 suggestion, invited her to Le Zephyr, to await better days. With 
 a good grace did Euphrosyne go out to meet hsr ; with a good 
 grace did she welcome and entertain her. The time was past 
 when she could be terrified with evil prognostications. In the 
 hour of the earthquake, no one heeds the croak of the raven. 
 Aniong the nuns at St. Marc there was trembling, which the

 pale abbess herself could not subdue by reason or exhortation. 
 Their ears were already weary with the moans of the dying. 
 They had now to hear the shrieks and curses of the kidnapped 
 blacks — the friends of L'Ouverture— whose homes were made 
 desolate. The terrified women could not but ask each other, 
 " who next ? " for they all loTed L'Ouverture, and had declared 
 their trust in him. No one injured the household of the abbess, 
 however ; and the sisters were all spared, in safety and honour, 
 to hear the proclamation of the Independence of Hayti, and to 
 enjoy the protection and friendship of its beloved Empress. 
 
 And where was she — ^Th&ese — ^when St. Marc was resounding 
 with the cries of her husband's betrayed companions and friends? 
 She was on the way to the fastnesses, where her unyielding hus. 
 band was preparing a tremendous retribution for those whom he 
 had never trusted. She rejoiced, solemnly but mournfully, that 
 he had never yielded. She could not wonder that the first words 
 of Dessalines to her, when he met her horse on the steep, were a 
 command that she would never more intercede for a Frenchman 
 — never more hold back his strong hand from the work which 
 he had now to do. She never did, tUl that which, in a chief, 
 was warfare, became, in an emperor, vengeance. Then she 
 resumed her woman's office of intercession ; and by it won for 
 herself the title of " the Good Empress." 
 
 The eyes which first caught sight of the receding ship Heros, 
 at dawn, were those of Paul L'Ouverture and Genifrede. They 
 had sent messengers, more likely than themselves to reach 
 Christophe and Dessalines, with the last message of Toussaint ; 
 and they were now at leisure to watch, from the heights above 
 their hut (their home henceforth), the departure of all who bore 
 their name. They were left alone, but not altogether forlorn. 
 They called each other father and daughter; and here they 
 could freely, and for ever, mourn Moyse. 
 
 Christophe received the message. It was not needed to rouse 
 him to take upon himself, or to share with Dessalines, the oflice 
 of him who was gone. The thoughts of his heart were told to 
 none. They were unspeakable, except by the language of deeds. 
 His deeds proclaimed them : and after his faithful warfare, during 
 his subsequent mild reign, his acts of liberality, wisdom, and 
 mercy, showed how true was his understanding of the mission of 
 L'Ouverture. 
 
 There were many to share his work to-day. Dessalines was 
 the chief : but leaders sprang up wherever soldiers appeared, 
 asking to be led ; and that was everywhere, from the moment of 
 the report of the abduction of Toussaint. Clerveaux revolted 
 from the !French, and visited on them the bitterness of his 
 remorse. Maurepas also repented, and was putting his repentance 
 into action when he was seized, tortured, and murdered, with

 his famUy. Bellair and his wife conducted ■with new spirit, 
 from this day, a ■victorious warfare which was never intermitted, 
 being bequeathed by their barbarous deaths to their exasperated 
 followers. 
 
 It was true, as Toussaint knew and felt in his solitary prison 
 on the waters, that the groans which went up from the heights 
 and hoUows, the homes and the fastnesses of the island, were 
 such as could not but unite in a fearful war-cry ; but it was also 
 true, as he had known and felt during the whole term of his 
 power, that in this war victory could not be doubtful. He had 
 been made the portal of freedom to his race. The passions of 
 men might gather about it, and make a conflict, more or less 
 tremendous and protracted ; but the way which God had opened, 
 and guarded by awakened human hearts, no multitude of rebel- 
 lious human hands could close. 
 
 CHAPTER XL. 
 
 MEETING ■WINTEE. 
 
 It was a glorious day, that twelfth of June, when the Heros 
 sailed away from the shores of St. Domingo. Before the Heros 
 could sail quite away, it was compelled to hover, as it were, 
 about the shadow of the land — to advance and retreat — to say 
 farewell, apparently, and then to greet it again. The wind was 
 north-east, so that a direct course was impossible ; and the 
 Ouverture family assembled, with the exception of Toussaint 
 himself, upon deck, gave vent, again and again, to their tears — 
 again and again strained their eyes, as the mountains with 
 their shadowy sides, the stiU forests, the yellow sands, and the 
 quiet settlements of the lateral valleys, came into view, or faded 
 away. 
 
 L'Ouverture's cabin, to which he was strictly confined during 
 the voyage, had a -window in the stem, and he, too, had there- 
 fore some change of prospect. He gazed eagerly at every shift- 
 ing picture of the land; but most eagerly when he found 
 himself ofE Cap Samana. With his pocket-glass he explored 
 and discovered the very point of rough ground on tlie height 
 where he stood -with Christophe, less than six months before, to 
 watch the approach, and observe the rendezvous, of the French 
 fleet. He remembered, as his eye was fixed upon the point, his 
 naming to Henri this very ship, in which he was now a prisoner, 
 sailing away, never more to return. 
 


## p. (#350) ################################################

346 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " Be it so ! " he thought, according to his wont. " My blacks 
 are not conquered, and will never more be slaves." 
 
 The wind soon changed, and the voyage was a rapid one. 
 Short as it was, it was tedious ; for, with the exception of Mars 
 Plaisir, who was appointed to wait on him, the prisoner saw no 
 one. Again and again he caught the voices of his children, 
 singing upon deck — no doubt iu order to communicate with him: 
 but, in every instance, almost before he had begun to listen, the 
 song ceased. Mars Plaisir explained that it was silenced by the 
 captain's order. No captain's order had power to stop the pri- 
 soner's singing. Every night was Aimde consoled, amidst her 
 weeping, by the solemn air of her father's favourite Latin Hymn 
 to Our Lady of the Sea : every morning was Margot roused to 
 hope by her husband's voice, singing his matin-prayer. What- 
 ever might be the captain's apprehensions of political danger 
 from these exercises, he gave over the opposition which had 
 succeeded so weU with the women. 
 
 " My father crossed this sea," thought Toussaint: " and little 
 could he have dreamed that the next of his race would cross it 
 also, a prince and a prisoner. He, the son of a Mng, was seized 
 and sold as a slave. His son, raised to be a ruler by the hand of 
 Him who creates princes (whether by birth or royalty of soul), is 
 kidnapped, and sacrificed to the passions of a rival. Such is our 
 life ! But in its evil there is good. If my father had not crossed 
 this sea as a slave, St. Domingo would have wanted me ; and in 
 me, perhaps, its freedom and civilisation. If I had not been 
 kidnapped, my blacks might have lacked wrath to accomplish 
 the victory to which I have led them. If my father is looking 
 back on this world, I doubt not he rejoices in the degradation 
 which brought elevation to his race ; and, as for me, I lay the 
 few years of my old age a ready sacrifice on the altar of An-ica." 
 
 Sometimes he amused himself with the idea of surveying, at 
 last, the Paris of which he had heard so much. Of tener, however, 
 he dwelt with complacency on the prospect of seeing Bonaparte 
 — of meeting his rival, mind to mind. He knew that Bonaparte's 
 curiosity about him was eager, and he never doubted that he 
 should be called to account personally for his govenmient, in all 
 its details. He did not consider that the great captain of the age 
 might fear to meet his victim — ^might shrink from the eye of a 
 brother-soldier whom he had treated worse than a felon. 
 
 Time and disappointment taught the prisoner this. None of 
 his dreams were verified. In Brest harbour he was hurried from 
 the ship — allowed a parting embrace of his family upon deck — 
 no more ; not a sentence of conversation, though all the ship's 
 crew were by to hear. Mars Plaisir alone was wowed to accom- 
 pany him. Two hurried whispers alone were conveyed to his 
 ear. Placide assured him (yet how could it be ? ) that M. Pascal

 was in Prance and would exert himself. And Margot told him, 
 amidst her sobs, that she had done the one only thing she could 
 — she had prayed for Bonaparte, as she promised, that night of 
 prophetic woe at Pongaudin. 
 
 Nothing did lie see of Paris hut some of the dimly-lighted 
 streets, as he was conveyed, at night, to the prison of the Temple. 
 During the weeks that he was a prisoner there, he looked!^ in 
 vain for a summons to the presence of the First Consul, or for 
 the First Consul's appeai-ance in liis apartment. One of Bona- 
 parte's aides, Caffarelli, came indeed, and brought messages : 
 but these messages were only insulting inquiries about the trea- 
 sures—the treasures buried in the mornes; — ^for ever these 
 treasures ! This recurring message, with its answer, was aU the 
 communication he had with Bonaparte ; and the hum and 
 murmur from the streets were all that he knew of Paris. When 
 Bonaparte, nettled with the reply — •" The treasures I have lost 
 are far other than those you seek," — was convinced that no 
 better answer would be obtained, he gave the order which had 
 been impending during those weeks of confinement in the Temple. 
 
 When Bonaparte found his first leisure, after the f§tes and 
 bustle occasioned in August by his being made First Consul for 
 life, he issued his commands regarding the disposal of his West 
 Indian prisoner : and presently Toussaint was traversing France, 
 with Mars Plaisir for his companion in captivity — with an ofiicer, 
 as a guard, inside the closed carriage ; another guard on the box; 
 and one, if not two, mounted in their rear. 
 
 The journey was conducted under circumstances of gi*eat mys- 
 tery. The blinds of the carriage were never let down ; provisions 
 were served out while the party was in full career ; aud the few 
 baitings that were made were contrived to take place, either 
 during the night, or in unfrequented places. It was clear that 
 the complexion of the strangers was not to be seen by the inha- 
 bitants. All that Toussaint could learn was that they were 
 travelling south-east. 
 
 " Have you mountains in your island ? " asked the oflBcer, let- 
 ting down the blind just so much, when the carriage turned a 
 ■corner of the road, as to permit to himself a glimpse of the 
 ■scenery. " We are entering the Jura. Have you mountains in 
 your island ? " 
 
 Toussaint left it to Mars Plaisir to answer this question; which 
 ie did with indignant volubility, describing the uses and the 
 beauties of the heights of St. Domingo, from the loftiest peaks 
 which intercept the hurricane, to the lowest, crested with forts 
 ■or spreading their blossoming groves to the verge of the valleys. 
 
 " We too have fortresses on our heights," said the officer. 
 " Indeed, you will be in one of them before night. When we 
 ■are on the other side of Pontarlier, we wiU look about us a little."

348 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 "Then, on the. other side of Pontarlier, we shall meet no 
 people," observed Mars Plaisir. 
 
 " People ! Oh, yes ! we have people everywhere in France." 
 
 When Pontarlier was passed, and the windows of the carriage 
 were thrown open, the travellers perceived plainly enough why 
 this degree of liberty was allowed. The region was so wild, that 
 none were likely to come hither in search of the captives. There 
 were inhabitants ; but few likely to give information as to who 
 had passed along the road. There were charcoal-burners up on 
 the hill-side ; there were women washing clothes in the stream 
 which rushed along, far below in the valley ; the miller was in 
 his mill, niched in the hollow beside the waterfall; and there 
 might still be inmates in the convent which stood just below the 
 firs, on the knoll to the left of the road. But by the way-side, 
 there were none who, with curious eyes, might mark, and with 
 eager tongue report, the complexion of the strangers who were 
 rapidly whirled along towards Joux. 
 
 Toussaint shivered as the chill mountain air blew in. Perhaps 
 what he saw chilled him no less than what he felt. He might 
 have unconsciously expected to see something like the teeming 
 slopes of his own mountains, the yellow ferns, the glittering 
 rocks, shining like polished metal in the sun. Instead of these, 
 the scanty grass was of a blue-green; the stunted firs were 
 black; and the patches of dazzling white intermingled with them 
 formed a contrast of colour hideous to the eye of a native of the 
 tropics. 
 
 " That is snow," exclaimed Mars Plaisir to his master, with 
 the pride of superior experience. 
 
 " I know it," replied Toussaint, quietly. 
 
 The carriage now laboured up a steep ascent. The "brave homme 
 who drove alighted on one side, and the guard on the other, aud 
 walked up the hiU, to relieve the horses. The guard gathered 
 such flowers as met his eye ; and handed into the carriage a blue 
 gentian which had till now lingered on the borders of the snows, 
 — or a rhododendron, for which he had scaled a crag. His officer 
 roughly ordered him not to leave the track. 
 
 " If we had passed this way two or three months earlier," he 
 said complacently to his prisoners, " we should have found cow- 
 slips here and there, all along the road. We have a good many 
 cowslips in early summer. Have you cowslips in your island ? " 
 
 Toussaint smiled as he thought of the flower-strewn savan- 
 nahs, where more blossoms opened and perished in an hour than 
 in this dreary region all the summer through. He heard Mars 
 Plaisir compelled to admit that he had never seen cowslips out of 
 Prance. 
 
 At length, after several mountings and dismountings of the 
 driver and guard, they seemed, on entering a defile, to apply

AT THE FORTRESS. 349 
 
 themselves seriously to their business. The guard cast a glance 
 along the road, and up the sides of the steeps, and beckoned to 
 the horsemen behind to come on; and the driver repeatedly 
 cracked his whip. Silence settled down on the party within the 
 carriage; for all understood that they drew near the fortress. 
 In silence they wound through the defile, tOl aU egress seemed 
 barred by a lofty crag. The road, however, passed round its 
 base, and disclosed to view a small basin among the mountains, 
 in the midst of which rose the steep which bore the fortress of 
 Joux. At the foot of this steep lay the village ; a small assem- 
 blage of sordid dwellings. At this village four roads met, from 
 as many defiles which opened into this centre. A mountain- 
 stream gushed along, now by the road-side, now winding and 
 growing quieter among the little plot of green fields which lay 
 in the rear of the castle rock. This plot of vivid green cheered, 
 for a moment, the eye of the captives ; but a second glance 
 showed that it was but a swamp. This swamp, crags, firs, and 
 snow, with the dirty village, made up the prospect. As for the 
 inhabitants — as the carriage stopped short of the village, none 
 were to be seen, but a girl with her distafC amidst a flock of 
 goats, and some soldiers on the castle walls above. 
 
 There appeared to be but one road up the rock — a bridle or 
 foot road to the right, too narrow and too steep for any carriage. 
 Where this joined the main road the carriage stopped ; and the 
 prisoners were desu'ed to alight. 
 
 '' We must trouble you to walk up this hill," said the officer, 
 " unless you prefer to mount, and have your horse led," 
 
 Before he had finished speaking, Toussaint was many paces in 
 advance of his guards. But few opportunities had he enjoyed, 
 of late, of exercising his limbs. He believed that this would be 
 the last ; and he sprang up the rocky pathway with a sense of 
 desperate pleasure. Panting and heated, the most active of the 
 soldiers reached the summit some moments after him. Tous- 
 saint had made use of those few moments. He had fixed in his 
 memory the leading points of the landscape towards the east — - 
 the bearings of the roads which opened glimpses into two valleys 
 on that side — the patches of enclosure — the nooks of pasture 
 where cows were grazing, and children were at play — these 
 features of the landscape ne eagerly comprehended — partly for 
 use, in case of any opportunity of escape ; partly for solace, if 
 he should not henceforth be permitted to look abroad. 
 
 A few, and but a few, more moments he had, while the draw- 
 bridge was lowered, the portcullis raised, and the guard sent in 
 with some order from his officer. Toussaint well knew that that 
 little plot of fields, with its winding stream, was the last verdure 
 that he might ever see. The snowy summits which peered over 
 the fir-tops were prophets of death to him ; for how should he.

350 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 who had gone hither and thither under the sim of the tropics for 
 sixty years, Utib chained among the snows ? "Well did he know 
 this ; yet he did not wait to be asked to pass the bridge. 
 
 The drawbridge and the courtyard were both deserted. Not 
 a soldier was to be seen. Mars Plaisir muttered his astonish- 
 ment, but his master understood that the presence of negro 
 prisoners in the fortress was not to become known. He read in 
 this incident a prophecy of total seclusion. 
 
 They were marched rapidly through the courtyard, into a 
 dark passage, where they were desired to stop. In a few 
 moments Toussaint heard the tramp of feet about the gate, 
 and imderstood that the soldiers had been ordered back to their 
 post. 
 
 " The Commandant ' " the officer announced to his prisoners ; 
 and the Commandant Rubaut entered the dim passage. Tous- 
 saint formed his judgment of him, to a certain extent, in a 
 moment. Bubaut endeavoured to assume a tone of good- 
 humoured familiarity ; but there appeared through this a mis- 
 giving as to whether he was thus either letting himself down, 
 on the one hand, or, on the other, encroaching on the dignity of 
 the person he addressed. His prisoner was a negro ; but then 
 he had been the recognised Commander-in-Chief of St. Domingo. 
 One symptom of awkwardness was, that he addressed Toussaint 
 by no sort of title. 
 
 "We have had notice of your approach," said he; "which 
 is fortunate, as it enables me to conduct you at once to your apart- 
 ment. Will you proceed ? This way. A torch, BeHines ! We 
 have been looking for you these two dfl,ys ; which happens very 
 well, as we have been enabled to prepare for you. Torches, 
 Bellines ! This way. We mount a few steps, you perceive. 
 We are not taking you underground, though I call for lights ; 
 but this passage to the left, you perceive, is rather dark. Tes, 
 that is our well ; and a great depth it is — deeper, I assure you, 
 than this rock is high. What do they call the depth, Ohalot ? 
 Well, never mind the depth ! You can f oUow me, I believe, 
 without waiting for a light. We cannot go wrong. Through 
 this apartment to the left." 
 
 Toussaint, however, chose to wait for Bellines and his torch. 
 He chose to see what he could of the passages of Ms prison. If 
 this vault in which he stood were not underground, it was the 
 dreariest apartment from which the daylight had ever been built 
 out. In the moment's pause occasioned by his not moving on 
 when desired, he heard the dripping of water as in a well. 
 
 Bellines appeared, and his torch showed the stone walls of 
 the vault shining with the trickling of water. A cold st«am 
 appeared to thicken the air, oppress the lungs, and make the 
 torch burn dim.

toussaint's cell. 351 
 
 "To what apartment can this be the passage?" thought 
 Toussaint. " The grave is warm compai-ed with this." 
 
 A glance of wretchedness from Mars Plaisir, seen in the 
 torchlight, as Bellines passed on to the front, showed that the 
 poor fellow's spirits, and perhaps some visions of a merry life 
 among the soldiers, had melted already in the damps of this 
 vault. Ruhaut gave him a push, which showed that he was to 
 follow the torch-bearer. 
 
 Through this vault was a passage, dark, wet, and slippery. 
 In the left-hand wall of this passage was a door, studded with 
 iron nails thickly covered with rust. The key was in this door. 
 During the instant required for throwing it wide, a large flake 
 of ice fell from the cefling of the passage upon the head of Tons- 
 saint. He shook it off, and it extinguished the torch. 
 
 " Tou mean to murder us," saidne, " if you propose to place 
 us here. Do you not know that ice and darkness are the negro's 
 poison ? Snow, too," he continued, advancing to the cleft of his 
 dungeon wall, at the outward extremity of which was his small 
 grated window. " Snow piled against this window now ! We 
 shall be buried under it in winter." 
 
 " Tou win have good fires in winter." 
 
 " In winter ! Tes ! this night ; or I shall never see winter." 
 
 " This night ! Oh, certainly ! Tou can have a fire, though 
 it is not usual with us at this season. Bellines — a fire here 
 immediately." 
 
 He saw his prisoner surveying, by the dim light from the 
 deep window, the miserable cell — about twenty-eight feet by 
 thirteen, built of blocks of stone, its vaulted ceiling so low that 
 it could be touched by the hand; its floor, though planked, 
 rotten and slippery with wet ; and no furniture to be seen but 
 a table, two chairs, and two heaps of straw in opposite corners. 
 
 " I am happy," said the Commandant, " to have been able to 
 avoid putting you underground. The orders I have had, from 
 the First Consul himseK, as to your being mis au secret, are very 
 strict. Notwithstanding that, I have been able, you see, to place 
 you in an apartment which overlooks the courtyard ; and which, 
 too, affords you other objects " — pointing through the gratings 
 to the few feet of the pavement without, and the few yards of 
 the perpendicular rock opposite, which might be seen through 
 the loop-hole. 
 
 " How many hours of the day and night are we to pass in 
 tliis place ? " 
 
 " How many hours .P We reckon twenty-four hours to the 
 day and night, as is the custom in Europe," replied Enbaut ; 
 whether in ignorance or irony, his prisoner could not, in the 
 dim twilight, ascertain. He only learned too surely that no exit 
 from this cell was to be allowed. 
 


## p. (#356) ################################################

352 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 Firewood and light were brought. Eubaut, eager to be busy 
 till he could go, and to be gone as soon as possible, found fault 
 with some long-deceased occupant of the cell, for having covered 
 its arched ceiling with grotesque drawings in charcoal; and 
 then with Belliues, for not having dried the floor. Truly the 
 light gleamed over it as over a pond. Bellines pleaded in his 
 defence that the floor had been dried twice since morning; 
 but that there was no stopping the melting of the ice above. 
 The water would come through the joints tUl the winter frosts 
 set in. 
 
 "Ay, the winter frosts — they will set all to rights. Thej 
 will cure the melting of the ice, no doubt." Turning to his 
 prisoners, lie congratulated himself on not being compelled to 
 search their persons. The practice of searching was usual, but 
 might, he rejoiced to say, be dispensed with on the present occa- 
 sion. He might now, therefore, have the pleasure of wishing 
 them a good evening. 
 
 Pointing to the two heaps of straw, he begged that his 
 prisoners would lay down their beds iu any part of the cell 
 which pleased them best. Their food, and all that they wanted, 
 would be brought to the door regularly. As for the rest, they 
 would wait upon each other. Having thus exhausted his polite- 
 ness, he quitted the cell ; and lock, bolt, and bar were fastened 
 upon the captives. 
 
 By the faint light, Toussaint then perceived that his com- 
 panion was struggling with laughter. When Mars Plaisir per- 
 ceived by his master's smile that he had leave to give way, he 
 laughed till the cell rang again, saying — 
 
 " Wait upon each other ! His Excellency wait upon me ! 
 His Excellency wait upon anybody ! " 
 
 " There would be nothing new in that. I have endeavoured 
 to wait upon others all my life. Rarely does Providence grant 
 the favour to wait upon so many." 
 
 Mars Plaisir did not comprehend this, and therefore con- 
 tinned — 
 
 " These whites think that we blacks are created to be serving, 
 serving always — always serving." 
 
 " And they are right. Their mistake is in not seeing that 
 the same is the case with all other men." 
 
 In his incessant habit of serving those about him, Toussaint 
 now remembered that it would be more kind to poor Mars 
 Plaisir to employ him, than to speak of things which he could 
 not comprehend. He signed to him, therefore, to shake down 
 the straw on each side the fireplace. Mars Plaisir sacrificed 
 some of his own bundle to wipe down the wet walls; but it 
 was all in vain. During the silence, while his master was 
 meditating at the window, the melancholy sound of falling water

TEARS AND LAUGHTER. 3S3 
 
 — drip, drip — plash, plash — was heard all around, within and 
 without the cell. When he had wiped down the wajls, from the 
 door in the comer round to the door again, the place from which 
 he had set out was as wet as ever, and his straw was spoiled. 
 He angrily kicked the wet straw into the fire ; the consequence 
 of which was that the cell was filled with smoke, almost to 
 suffocation. 
 
 " Ask for more," said Toussaint. 
 
 Mars Plaisir shouted, knocked at the door, and used every 
 endeavour to make himself heard ; but in vain. No one came. 
 
 " Take some of mine." said Toussaint. " No one can lie on 
 this floor." 
 
 Mars Plaisir shook his head. He proceeded mournfully to 
 spread the other heap of straw; but a large flake of ice had 
 fallen upon it from the corner of the walls, and it was as wet as 
 that which he had burned. 
 
 This was too much for poor Mars Plaisir. He looked upon 
 his master, now spreading his thin hands over the lire, his fur- 
 rowed face now and then lighted up by the blaze which sprang 
 fitfully through the smoke—he thought of the hall of audience 
 at Port-au-Prince, of the gardens at Pongaudin, of the Place 
 d'Armes at Cap Franqais on review days, of the military journeys 
 and of&cial fetes of the Commander-in-Ohief, and he looked upon 
 him now. He burst into tears as unconti-oUable as his laughter 
 had been before. Feeling his master's hand upon his shoulder, 
 he considered it necessary to give a reason for his grief, and 
 sobbed out — 
 
 " They treat your Excellency as if your Excellency were 
 nobody. They give your Excellency no title. They will not 
 even call you General." 
 
 Toussaint laughed at this cause of grief in such a place ; but 
 Mars Plaisir insisted upon it. 
 
 " How would they like it themselves ? What wotdd the 
 First Consul himself say if he were a prisoner, and his gaolers 
 refused him his titles ?" 
 
 " I do not suppose him to be a man of so narrow a heart, and 
 so low a soul, as that such a trifle could annoy him. Cheer up, 
 if that be all." 
 
 Mars Plaisir was far from thinking this all ; but his tears and 
 sobs choked him in the midst of his complaints. Toussaint 
 turned again to the fire, and presently began to sing one of the 
 most familiar songs of St. Domingo. He had not sung a stanza 
 before, as he had anticipated, his servant joined in, rising from 
 his attitude of despair, and singing with as much animation 
 as if he had been on the Haut-du-Cap. This was soon put a 
 stop to by a sentinel, who knocked at the door to command 
 silence.

354 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 "They cannot hear us if we want dry straw," said Mars 
 Plaisir, passionately : " and yet we cannot raise a note but they 
 must stop us." 
 
 " We are caged birds ; and you know Denis's canary might 
 sing only when it pleased his master. Have I not seen even 
 you cover up the cage p But sing — sing softly, and they may 
 not hear you." 
 
 "When supper was brought, fresh straw and more firewood 
 were granted. At his master's bidding, and under the influence 
 of these comforts. Mars Plaisir composed himself to sleep. 
 
 Toussaint sat long beside the fire. He could not have slept. 
 The weeks that had passed since he left St. Domingo had not 
 yet reconciled his ear to the silence of a European night. At 
 sea, the dash of the waves against the ship's side had lulled 
 him to rest. Since he had landed, he had slept little, partly 
 from privation of exercise, partly from the action of over-busy 
 thoughts ; but also, in part, from the absence of that hum of life 
 which, to the natives of the tropics, is the incentive to sleep and 
 its accompaniment. Here, there was but the crackle of the 
 burning wood, and the plashing of water, renewed from minute 
 to minute, till it became a fearful doubt — a passing doubt, but 
 very fearful — whether his ear could become accustomed to the 
 dreary sound, or whether his self-command was to be overthrown 
 by so small an agency as this. From such a question he turned, 
 by an effort, to consider other evils of his condition. It was a 
 cruel aggravation of his sufferings to have his servant shut up 
 with him. It imposed upon him some duties, it was true ; and 
 was, in so far, a good ; but it also imposed most painful re- 
 straints. He had a strong persuasion that Bonaparte had not 
 given up the pursuit of his supposed treasures, or the hope of 
 mastering aU his designs, real or imaginary ; and he suspected 
 that Mars Plaisir would be left long enough with him to receive 
 the overflowings of his confidence (so hard to restrain in such 
 circumstances as theirs ! ) and would then be tampered with by 
 the agents of the First Consul. What was the nature and 
 efficacy of their system of cross-examination, he knew ; and he 
 knew how nothing but ignorance could preserve poor Mars 
 Plaisir from treachery. Here, therefore — here, in this cell, 
 vrithout resource, without companionship, vrithout solace of any 
 kind, it would be necessary, perhaps, through long months, to 
 set a watch upon his lips, as strict as when he dined with the 
 French Commissaries at Government-House, or when he was 
 weighing the Report of the Central Assembly, regarding a 
 Colonial constitution. For the reserve which his function had 
 imposed upon him at home, he had been repaid by a thousand 
 enjoyments. Now, no more sympathy, no more ministering 
 from, his family ! — no more could he open to Margot his glory

PAINFUL REFLECTIONS, 355 
 
 in Placide, his hopes from Denis, his cares for his other children, 
 to uphold them under a pressure of influences which were too 
 strong for them ; no more could he look upon the friendly face 
 of Henri, and unbosom himself to him in sun or shade; no 
 more could he loot upon the results of his labours in the mer- 
 chant fleets on the sea, and the harvests burdening the plains ! 
 No more could happy voices, from a thousand homes, come to 
 him in blessing and in joy ! No more music, no more sunshine, 
 no more fragrance ; no more certainty, either, that others were 
 now enjoying what he had parted with for ever ! Not only might 
 he never hear what had ensued upon the " truce tiU August," 
 but he must carefully conceal his anxiety to hear — his belief 
 that there were such tidings to be told. In the presence of Mars 
 Plaisir, he could scarcely even think of that which lay heaviest 
 at his heart — of what Henri had done, in consequence of his 
 abduction — of his poor oppressed blacks — whether they had 
 sunk under the blow for the time, and so delayed the arrival of 
 that freedom which they must at length achieve ; or whether 
 they had risen, like a multitudinous family of bereaved children, 
 to work out the designs of the father who had been snatched 
 from them. Of all this there could be no speech (scarcely a 
 speculation in his secret soul) in the presence of one who must, 
 if he heard, almost necessarily become a traitor. And then his 
 f amUy ! From them he had vanished ; and he must live as if 
 they had vanished from his very memory. They were, doubtless, 
 all eye, all ear : for ever watching to know what had become of. 
 him. For their personal safety, now that he was helpless, he 
 trusted there was little cause for fear ; but what peace of mind 
 could they enjoy, while in ignorance of his fate ? He fancied 
 them imploring of their guardians tidings of him, in vain ; ques- 
 tioning the four winds for whispers of nig retreat ; pacing every 
 cemetery for a grave that might be his ; gazing up at the loop- 
 holes 01 every prison, with a fear that he might be there ; 
 keeping awake at midnight, for the chance of a visit from his 
 injured spirit ; or seeking sleep, in the dim hope that he might 
 be revealed to them in a dream. And all this must be but a 
 dim dream to him, except in such an hour as this — a chance 
 hour when no eye was upon him ! The reconciling process was 
 slow — but it was no less sure than usual. 
 
 " Be it so ! " was, as usual, his conclusion — " Be it so 1 for as 
 long as Heaven pleases — though that cannot be long. The one 
 consolation of being buried alive, soul or body — or both, as in 
 this case — is, that release is sure and near. This poor fellow's, 
 spirit will die within him, and his body will then be let out — 
 the consummation most necessary for him. And my body, 
 already failing, will soon die, and my work be done. To die, 
 and to die thus, is part of my work ; and I will do it as willingly

 as in the field. Hundreds, thousands of my race have died foi 
 slavery, cooped up, pining, suffocated in slave-ships, in the 
 vrastes of the sea. Hundreds and thousands have thus died, 
 without knowing the end for which they perished. What is it, 
 then, for one to die of cold in the wastes of the mountains, for 
 freedom, and knowing that freedom is the end of his life and 
 his death ? What is it ? If I groan, if I shrink, may my race 
 curse me, and my God cast me out ! " 
 
 A warmer glow than the dying embers could give passed 
 through his frame ; and he presently slept, basking till morning 
 in dreams of his sunny home. 
 
 CHAPTER XLI. 
 
 HAI.F FBEE. 
 
 Atjtttmn faded, and the long winter of the Jura came on, with- 
 out bringing changes of any importance to the prisoners — ^unless 
 it were that, in addition to the wood-fire, which scarcely kept up 
 the warmth of life in their bodies, they were allowed a stove. 
 This indulgence was not in answer to any request of theirs. 
 Toussaint early discovered that Bubaut would grant nothing 
 that was asked for.but Kked to bestow a favour spontaneously, 
 now and then. This was a clear piece of instruction ; by which, 
 however, Mars Plaisir was slow to profit. Notwithstanding his 
 master's explanations and commands, and his own promises, fer- 
 vently given when they were alone, he could never see the Com- 
 mandant without pouting out all his complaints, and asking for 
 everything relating to external comfort that his master had been 
 accustomed to at Pongaudin. A stove, not being among the 
 articles of furniture there, was not asked for ; and thus this one 
 comfort was not intercepted by being named. Books were 
 another. Mars Plaisir had been taught to read and write in one 
 of the public schools in the island ; but his tastes did not lie in 
 the direction of literature ; and he rarely remembered that he 
 possessed the accomplishment of being able to read, except when 
 circumstances called upon him to boast of his country and his 
 race. Books were therefore brought, two at a time, with the 
 Commandant's compliments ; two at a time, for the rule of 
 treating the prisoners as equals was exactly observed. This 
 civUity brought great comfort to Toussaint— the greatest except 
 solitude. He always chose to suppose that Mars Plaisir was 
 reading when he held a book: and he put a book into his 
 hands daily when he opened his own. Many an hour did he

BOOKS FOR THE PRISONERS. 357 
 
 thus obtain for the indulgence of his meditations ; and while his 
 servant was wondering now he could see to read by the dim 
 light which came in at the window — more dim each day, as the 
 snow-heap there rose higher — or by the fitful flame of the fire, 
 his thoughts were far away, beating about amidst the struggle 
 then probably going on in St. Domingo ; or exploring, with won- 
 der and sorrow, the narrow and darkened passages of that mind 
 which he had long taken to be the companion of his own ; or 
 springing forward into the future, and reposing in serene faith 
 on the condition of his people when, at length, they should 
 possess their own souls, and have learned to use their human 
 privileges. Many a time did Mars Plaisir, looking off from a 
 volume of the Philosoi)hical Dictionary, which yielded no amuse- 
 ment to him, watch the bright smile on his master's face, and 
 suppose it owing to the jokes in the Racine he held, when that 
 smile arose from pictures formed within of the future senates, 
 schools, courts, and virtuous homes, in which his dusky brethren 
 would hereafter be exercising and securing their rights. Not 
 ungratefully did he use his books the while. He read and en- 
 joyed; but his greatest obligations to them were for the sugges- 
 tions they afforded, the guidance they oilered to his thoughts to 
 regions amidst which his prison and his sufflerings were for- 
 gotten. 
 
 At times, the servant so far broke through his habitual defer- 
 ence for his master as to fling down his book upon the table, and 
 then beg pardon, saying that they should both go mad if they 
 did not make some noise. When he saw the snow falling per- 
 petually, noiseless as the dew, he longed for the sheeted rains 
 of his own winter, splashing as if to drown the land. Here, 
 there was only the eternal drip, drip, which his ear was weary 
 of months ago. 
 
 " Cannot you fancy it rain-drops falling from a palm-leaf ? 
 Shut your eyes and try," said his master. 
 
 It would not do. Mars Plaisir complained that the Com- 
 mandant had promised that this drip should cease when the 
 frosts of winter came. 
 
 " So it might, but for our stove. But then our ears would 
 have been frozen up, too. We should have .been underground by 
 this time — which they say we are not now, though it is hard 
 sometimes to believe them. However, we shall hear something 
 by-and-by that will drown the drip. Among these mountains, 
 there must be thunder. In the summer, Mars Plaisir, we may 
 hear thunder." 
 
 " In the summer ! " exclaimed Mars Plaisir, covering his face 
 with Ms hands. 
 
 " That is, not you, but I. I hope they will let you out long 
 before the summer."

 " Does your Excellency hope so ? " cried Mars Plaisir, spring- 
 ing to Ms feet. 
 
 " Certainly, my poor fellow. The happiest news I expect ever 
 to hear is that you are to be released : and this news I do expect 
 to hear. They will not let you go home, to tell where I am ; 
 but they will take you out of this place." 
 
 " Oh, your Excellency ! if you think so, would your Excel- 
 lency be pleased to speak for me — to ask the Commandant to 
 let me out ? If you wUl tell him that my rheumatism will not 
 
 let me sleep I do not want to go home — I do not want to 
 
 leave your Excellency, except for your Excellency's good. I 
 would say all I could for you, and kneel to the First Consul ; 
 
 and, if they would not set you free, I would " Here his 
 
 voice faltered, but he spoke the words — " I would come back 
 into your Excellency's service in the summer — when I had got 
 cured of my rheumatism. If you would speak a word to the 
 Commandant ! " 
 
 " I would, if I were not sure of injuring you by doing so. 
 Do you not see that nothing is to be granted us that we ask for ? 
 Speak not another word of liberty, and you may have it. Ask 
 for it, and you are here for life — or for my life. Remember ! " 
 
 Mars Plaisir stood deep in thought. 
 
 "You have never asked for your liberty?" said his master. 
 " ITo. I knew that, for my sake, you had not. Has no one ever 
 mentioned Kterty to you P I understand," he continued, seeing 
 an expression of comusion in the poor fellow's face. " Do not 
 tell me anything ; only hear me. If freedom should be offered 
 to you, take it. It is my wish — ^it is my command. Is there 
 more wood ? None but this ? " 
 
 " None but this damp wood that chokes us with smoke. They 
 send us the worst wood — the green, damp wood that the poorest 
 of the whites in the castle will not use," cried Mars Plaisir, 
 striving to work off his emotions in a fit of passion. He kicked 
 the unpromising log into the fireplace as he exclaimed — 
 
 " They think the worst of everything good enough for us, 
 because we are blacks. Oh ! oh ! " Here his vrrath was aggra- 
 vated by a twinge of rheumatism. " They think anything good 
 enough for blacks." 
 
 " Let them think so," said his master, kindly. " God does 
 not. God did not think so when He gave us the soil of Africa, 
 and the sun of St. Domingo. When He planted the gardens of 
 the world with palms, it was for the blades. When He spread 
 the wide shade of the banyan. He made a tent for the blacks. 
 When He filled the air with the scent of the cinnamon and the 
 cacao, was it not for the blacks to enjoy the fragrance P Has He 
 not given them music ? Has he not given them love and a home ? 
 What has He not given them P Let the whites think of us as

SUSPICIONS. 359 
 
 they will ! They shall be welcome to a share of what God gave 
 the blacks, though they return us nothiug better than wet wood, 
 to warm us among their snows." 
 
 " It is true," said Mars Plaisir, his complacency completely 
 restored — " God thinks nothing' too good for the blacks. I will 
 teU the First Consul so, if " 
 
 "The First Consul would rather hear something else from 
 you : and you know, Mars Plaisir, the whites laugh at us for 
 our boastings. However, tell the First Consul what you will." 
 
 Again was Mars Plaisir silenced, and his couiftenance con- 
 fused. Perpetually, from this hour did he drop words which 
 showed an expectation of seeing the First Consul — words which 
 were never noticed by his master. Every time that the increasing 
 weakness and pain under which Toussaint suffered forced them- 
 selves on his servant's observation — whenever the skeleton 
 hands were rubbed in his own, to relieve cramps and restore 
 warmth ; or the friendly oifice was returned, in spite of the 
 shame and confusion of the servant at finding himself thus 
 served — ^with every drift of snow which blocked up the window 
 — and every relaxation of frost, which only increased the worse 
 evil of the damp — ^Mars Plaisir avowed or muttered the per- 
 suasive things he would say to the First Consul. 
 
 Toussaint felt too much sympathy to indulge in much con- 
 tempt for his companion. He, too, found it hard to be tortured 
 with cramps, and wrung by spasms — to enjoy no respite from 
 vexations of body and spirit. He, too, found the passage to the 
 grave weary pad dreary. And, as for an interview with Bona- 
 parte, for how long had this been his first desire ! How dis- 
 tinctly had it of late been the reserve of his hope ! B/eminding 
 himself, too, of the effects on the wretched of an indefinite hope, 
 such as the unsettled mind and manners of his servant convinced 
 him, more and more, had been held out — he could not, in the 
 very midst of scenes of increasing foUy and passion, despise 
 poor Mars Plaisir. He mistrusted him, however, and with a 
 more irksome mistrust continually, while he became aware that 
 Mars Plaisir was in the habit of lamenting St. Domingo chiefly 
 for the sake of naming Ohristophe and Dessalines, the companies 
 in the mornes, the fever among the whites, and whatever might 
 be most likely to draw his master into conversation on the hopes 
 and resources of the blacks. He became more and more con- 
 vinced that the weakness of his companion was practised upon, 
 and possibly his attachment to his master, by promises of good 
 to both, on condition of information furnished. He was neai-ly 
 certain that he had once heard the door of the cell closed gently, 
 as he was beginning to awake, in the middle of the night ; and 
 he was quite sure that he one day saw Mars Plaisir bum a note, 
 as he replenished the fire, whUe he thought his master was busy

360 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 reading. Not even these mysterious proceedings could make 
 Toussaint feel anything worse than sorrowing pity for Mars 
 Plaisir. 
 
 The Commandant had ceased to visit his prisoners. During 
 the rest of the winter, he never came. He sent books occa- 
 sionally, but less frequently. The supply of firewood was 
 gradually diminished ; and so was the quantity of food. The 
 ailments of the prisoners were aggravated, from day to day; and 
 if the Commandant had favoured them with his presence, he 
 would have Relieved that he saw two dusky shadows amidst the 
 gloom of their cell, rather than men. 
 
 One morning, Toussaint awoke, slowly and with difficulty, 
 from a sleep which appeared to have been strangely sound for 
 one who could not move a limb without pain, and who rarely, 
 therefore, slept for many minutes together. It must have been 
 strangely long, too ; for the light was as strong as it had ever 
 been at noon in this dim cell. Before he rose, Toussaint felt 
 that there was sunshine in the air ; and the thought that spring 
 was come, sent a gleam of pleasure through his spirit. It was 
 true enough. As he stood before the window, something like a 
 shadow might be seen on the floor. No sky — not a shred the 
 breadth of his hand — was to be seen. For six months past, he 
 had beheld neither cloud, nor star, nor the flight of a bird! But, 
 casting a glance up to the perpendicular rock opposite, he saw 
 that it faintly reflected sunshine. He saw, moreover, something 
 white moving — some living creature upon this rock. It was a 
 young kid, standing upon a point or ledge imperceptible below 
 — by its action, browsing upon some vegetation which could not 
 be seen so far ofE. 
 
 " Mars Plaisir ! Mars Plaisir ! " cried Toussaint. " Spring is 
 come ! The world is alive again, even here. Mars Plaisir ! " 
 There was no answer. 
 
 " He has slept deeply and long, like myself," said he, going, 
 however, iato the darker corner of the cell where Mars Plaisir's 
 bed was laid. The straw was there, but no one was on it. The 
 stove was warm, but there was no fire in the fireplace. The 
 small chest allowed for the prisoners' clothes was gone — every- 
 thing was gone but the two volumes in which they had been 
 reading the night before. Toussaint shook these books, to see if 
 any note had been hidden in them. He explored them at the 
 window, to discover any word of farewell that might be written 
 on blank leaf or margin. There was none there ; nor any scrap 
 of paper hidden in the straw, or dropped upon the floor. Mars 
 Plaisir was gone, and had left no token. 
 
 " They drugged mo— hence my long sleep," thought Toussaint. 
 " They knew the poor fellow's weakness, and feared his saying 
 too much, when it came to parting. I hope they will treat him

 well, for (thanks to my care for him !) he never betrayed me 
 to them. I treated him well in taking care that he should not 
 betray me to them, while they yet so far believed that he might 
 as to release him. It is all well ; and I am alone ! It is almost 
 like being in the free air. I am almost as free as yonder kid on 
 the rock. My wife ! my children ! I may name you all now — 
 name you in my thoughts and in my song. Placide ! are you 
 rousing the nations to ask the tyrant where I am ? Henri ! have 
 you buried the dead whites yet in St. Domingo ? and have your 
 rains done weeping the treason of those dead against freedom % 
 Let it be so, Henri ! Your rains have washed out the blood of this 
 treason ; and your dews have brought forth the verdure of your 
 plains, to cover the graves of the guilty and the fallen. Take 
 this lesson home, Henri ! Forget — ^not me, for you must remem- 
 ber me in carrying on my work — but forget how you lost me. 
 Believe that I fell in the momes, and that you buried me there ; 
 believe this, rather than shed one drop of blood for me. Learn 
 of God, not of Bonaparte, how to bless our race. Poison their 
 souls no more with blood. The sword and the fever have done 
 their work, and tamed your tyrants. As for the rest, act with 
 God for our people ! Give them harvests to their hands ; and 
 open the universe of knowledge before their eyes. Give them 
 rest and stillness in the summer heats : and shelter them in vir- 
 tuous and busy homes from the sheeted rains. It is enough that 
 blood was the price of freedom — a heavy price, which has been 
 paid. Let there be no such barter for vengeance. My children, 
 hear me ! Wherever you axe — in the court of our tyrant, or on 
 the wide sea, or on the mountain-top, where the very storms 
 cannot make themselves heard so high — yet let your father's 
 voice reach yon from his living grave ! No vengeance ! Free- 
 dom — ^freedom to the last drop of blood in the veins of our race ! 
 Let our island be left to the wild herds and the reptiles, rather 
 than be the habitation of slaves : but if you have established 
 freedom there, it is holy ground, and no vengeance must profane 
 it. If you love me and my race, you must forgive my murderers. 
 Yes, murderers," he pursued in thought, after dwelling awhile 
 on the images of home and familiar faces, "murderers they 
 aLready are, doubtless, in intent. I should have been sent hence 
 long ago, but for the hope of reaching my counsels through Mars 
 Plaisir. From the eyes of the world I have already disappeared ; 
 and nothing hinders the riddance of me now. Feeble as I am, 
 the waiting for death may yet be tedious. If tedious for him 
 who has this day done with me, how tedious for me, who have 
 done with him and with aU the world ! — done with them, except 
 as to the afPections with which one may look back upon them 
 from the clear heights on the other side of the dark valley. 
 That I should pine and shiver long in the shadows of that valley

 woiild be tedious to him who drove me there before my time, 
 and to me. He has never submitted to what is tedious, and he 
 will not now." 
 
 The door of the cell was here softly opened, a head showed 
 itself, and immediately disappeared. Toussaint silently watched 
 the kid, as it moved from point to point on the face of the rock : 
 and it was with some sorrow that he at last saw it spring away. 
 Just then, BeUines entered with the usual miserable breakfast. 
 Toussaint requested fire, to which BeUines assented. He then 
 asked to have the window opened, that the air of the spring 
 morning might enter. BeUines shrugged his shoulders, and 
 observed that the air of these March mornings was sharp. The 
 prisoner persisted, however ; and with the fresh air, there came 
 in upon him a fresh set of thoughts. OaUing BeUines back, he 
 desired, in a tone of authority, to see the Commandant. 
 
 It was strange to him — he wondered at himself on finding his 
 mind filled with a new enterprise — with the idea of making a 
 last appeal to Rubaut for freedom — an appeal to his justice, not 
 to his clemency. With the chill breeze, there had entered the 
 tinkle of the cow-beU, and the voices of children singing. These 
 caUed up a vivid picture of the valley, as he had seen it on 
 entering his prison — the smaU green level, the gushing stream, 
 the sunny rock, the girl with her distaff, tending the goats. He 
 thought he could show his title to, at least, a free sight of the 
 face of nature ; and the impulse did not immediately die. During 
 the morning, he listened for footsteps without. After some hours, 
 he smiled at his own hope, and nearly ceased to listen. The 
 face of the rock grew dim ; the wind rose, and sleet was driven 
 in at the window ; so that he was compeUed to use his stiff and 
 aching limbs in climbing up to shut it. No one had remembered, 
 or had chosen to make his fire ; and he was shivering, as in an 
 ague fit, when, late in the afternoon, BeUines brought in his 
 second meal, and some fuel. 
 
 " The Commandant ? " 
 
 "The Commandant is not in the castle. He is absent to- 
 day." 
 
 " Where P " 
 
 " They say the First Consul has business with him." 
 
 " With me rather," thought Toussaint. He said aloud, 
 " Then he is gone with my servant ? " 
 
 " May be so. They went the same road ; but that road leads 
 to many places." 
 
 The road from Pontarlier ? " 
 
 " Any road — all our roads here lead to many places," said 
 BeUines, as he went out. 
 
 "Poor Mars Plaisir!" thought Toussaint, as he carefuUy 
 placed the wood so as to tempt the feeble blaze. " Our road

RUBAUT RE-APPEARS. 363 
 
 has seemed the same for the last eight months ; but it leads to 
 widely different points. I rejoice for him that his has parted ofl 
 to-day ; and for myself, though it shows that I am near the end 
 of mine. Is it this soldier, with comrades, who is to end me ? 
 Or is it this supper, better drugged than that of last night ? Or 
 will they wait to see whether solitude will kill a busy, ambitious 
 Commander-in-Chief, as they think me ? " 
 
 CHAPTER XLII. 
 
 Day after day passed on, and the prisoner found no change in 
 his condition — as far, at least, as it depended on his gaolers. He 
 was more iU as he became enveloped in the damps of the spring ; 
 and he grew more and more sensible of the comfort of being 
 alone. Death by violence, however, did not come. 
 
 He did not give over his concern for Mars Plaisir because he 
 was glad of his absence. He inquired occasionally for the Com- 
 mandant, hoping that, if he could see Rubaut, he might learn 
 whether his servant was still a prisoner, and whether his release 
 from his cell had been for freedom, or for a worse lot than he 
 had left behind. There was no learning from Bellines, however, 
 whether the Commandant had returned to the fortress, or who 
 was his lieutenant, if he had not. In the middle of April, the 
 doubt was settled by the appearance of Rubaut himself in the 
 cell. He was civil — unusually so — but declared himself unable 
 to give any information about Mars Plaisir. He had nothing 
 more to do with his prisoners when they were once taken out of 
 his charge. He had always business enough upon his hands to 
 prevent his occupying himself with things and people that were 
 gone by. He had delivered Mars Plaisir into proper care ; and 
 that was the last he knew of him. The man was well at that 
 time — as well as usual, and pleased enough to be in the open 
 air again. Rubaut could remember no more concerning him 
 — in fact, had not thought of him again, from that day to the 
 present. 
 
 " And this is the kind of answer that you would give con- 
 cerning me, if my sons should arrive hither in search of me 
 some days after my grave had been closed P " 
 
 " Come, come ! no foreboding ! " said Rubaut. " Foreboding 
 is bad." 
 " If my sons should present themselves " proceeded Tous-

364 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 " They will not come here — ^they cannot come here," inter- 
 mpted Eubaut. " No one knows that you are here, but some 
 three or four who will never tell." 
 
 " How," thought Toussaint, " have they secured Mars Plaisir, 
 that he shall never tell ? " For the poor man's sake, however, 
 he would not ask this aloud. 
 
 Rubaut continued : " The reason why we cannot have the 
 pleasure of giving you the range of the fortress is, that the First 
 Consul thinks it necessary to keep secret the place of your abode 
 • — for the good of the colony, as he says. With one of our own 
 countrymen, this seclusion might not be necessary, as the good 
 people of the village could hardly distinguish features from the 
 distance at which they are ; and they have no telescopes — no 
 idea of playing the spy upon us, as we can upon them. They 
 cannot distinguish features, so high up " 
 
 "But they could complexion." 
 
 " Exactly so ; and it might get abroad that some one of your 
 colour was here." 
 
 " And if it should get abroad, and some one of my sons, or 
 my wife should come, your answer would be that you remember 
 nothing — that you cannot charge your memory with persons and 
 things that are gone by — that you have had prisoners of all 
 complexions — that some have lived and some have died — and 
 that you have something else to do than to remember wliat 
 became of each. I hope, however, and (as it would be for the 
 advantage of the First Consul) I believe, that you would have 
 the complaisance to show them my grave." 
 
 "Come, come ! no foreboding ! Foreboding is bad," repeated 
 Rubaut. 
 
 Toussaint smUed, and said — 
 
 " What other employment do yon afford me than that of look- 
 ing into the past and future, in order to avoid the present 1 If, 
 turning from the sickening view which the past presents of the 
 treachery of your race to mine, of the abuse of my brotherly trust 
 in him by which your ruler has aflBicted our hearts — if, turning 
 from this moiu-nful past, I look the other way, what do I see 
 before me but the open grave ? " 
 
 " Tou are out of spirits," said Rubaut, building up the fire. 
 " You wear well, however. Tou must have been very strong 
 iu your best days. Tou wear extremely well." 
 
 " I still live ; and that I do so is because the sun of my own 
 climate, and the strength of soul of my best days, shine and glow 
 through me now, quenching iu part even these damps. But I 
 am old, and every day heaps years on me. However, I am as 
 willing as you that my looking forward should be for others than 
 myself. I might be able to forebode for France, and for its 
 ruler." 
 


## p. (#369) ################################################

"no foreboding.'" 365 
 
 Rubant folded his arms, and leaned, as if anxious to listen, 
 against the wall beside the fire ; but it was so wet that he quickly 
 shifted his position ; stiU, howerer, keeping his eyes fixed on his 
 prisoner. 
 
 "And what would you forebode for Prance, and for hor 
 ruler P" he asked. 
 
 " That my country will never again be hers. Her retribution 
 is as sure as her tyranny has been great. She may send out fleet 
 after fleet, each bearing an army ; but the spirit of freedom will 
 be too strong for them all. Their bodies will poison the air, and 
 choke the sea, and the names of their commanders will, one after 
 another, sink in disgrace, before they will again make slaves of 
 my people in St. Domingo. How stands the name of Leclerc at 
 this moment in France ? " 
 
 " Leclerc is dead," said Rubaut ; repenting, the next moment, 
 that he had said so much. Toussaint saw this by his countenance, 
 and inquired no further. 
 
 " He is dead ! and twenty thousand Freuchmen with him, 
 who might at this hour have been enjoying at home the natural 
 wealth of my country, the fruits of om- industry. The time was 
 when I thought your ruler and I — the ruler, in alliance with 
 him, of my race in St. Domingo — were brothers in soul, as wo 
 were apparently in duty and ui fortune. Brothers in soul we 
 were not, as it has been the heaviest grief of my life to learn. I 
 spurn brotherhood of soul with one whose ambition has been for 
 himself. Brothers in duty we were ; and, if we should yet be 
 brothers in fortune — if he should fall into the hands of "a strong 
 foe — But you are saying in your heart, ' No foreboding ! Fore- 
 boding is bad ! ' " 
 
 Rubaut smiled, and said foreboding was only bad for the 
 spirits; and the First Consul's spirits were not likely to be 
 affected by anything that could be said at Joux. To predict 
 bad fortune for him was like looking for the sun to be put out 
 at noonday; it might pass the time, but would not dim the sun. 
 
 " So was it said of me," replied the prisoner, " and with the 
 more reason, because I made no enemies. My enemies have not 
 been of my own making. Tour ruler is making enemies on every 
 hand ; and alas ! for him if he lives to meet the hour of retribu- 
 tion ! If he, like myself, should fall into the power of a strong 
 foe — if he should pass his remaining days imprisoned on a rock, 
 may he find more peace than I should dare look for, if I had his 
 soul!" 
 
 " There is not a braver man in Europe, or the Indies either, 
 than the First Consul." 
 
 " Brave towards foes without and sufferings to come. But 
 bravery gives no help against enemies harboured within, and 
 evils fixed in the past. What will his bravery avail against the

366 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 images of France corrupted, of Europe outraged, of the blacks 
 betrayed and oppressed — of the godlike power which was put 
 into his hands abused to the purposes of the devil ! " 
 
 " But perhaps he would not view his affairs as you do." 
 
 " Then would his bravery avail him no better. If he should 
 be so blind as to see nothing highei and better than his own acts, 
 then will he see no higher nor better hope than he has lost. 
 Then will he suffer and die under the slow torment of personal 
 mortifications and regrets." 
 
 " Tou say you are sinking under your reverses. Tou say you 
 are slowly dying." 
 
 " I am. I shall die of the sickening and pining of sense and 
 limb — of the wasting of bone and muscle. Day by day is my 
 eye more dim, and my right arm more feeble. But I have never 
 complained of evils that the bravery you speak of would not 
 meet. Have I ever said that you hav? touched my soul ? " 
 
 Rubaut saw the fire in his eye, glanced at his emaciated hand, 
 and felt that this was true. He could bear the conversation no 
 longer, now that no disclosures that could serve the First Consul 
 seemed likely to be made. 
 
 " Tou are going ? " said Toussaint. 
 
 " Tes. I looked in to-day because I am about to leave thp 
 fortress for a few days." 
 
 " If you see the First Consul, t«ll him what I have now said ; 
 and add that if, like him, I had used my power for myself, he 
 would have had a power over me which he has not now. I 
 should not then have been here-^nay, you must hear me — ^I 
 should not then have been here, crushed beneath his hand; I 
 should have been on the throne of St. Domingo — flattered, as he 
 is, by assurances of my glory and security — ^but crushed by a 
 heavier weight than that of has hand ; by his image, as that of 
 one betrayed in my infidelity to his country and nation. Tell him 
 this ; teU him that I perish willingly, if this consequence of my 
 fidelity to France may be a plea for justice to my race." 
 
 " How people have misrepresented you to me ! " said Rubaut, 
 bustling about the cell, and opening the door to call BeUines. 
 " They told me you were very silent— rarely spoke." 
 
 " That was true when my duty was to thini," said Toussaint. 
 " To-day my duty has been to speak. Remember that yours, in 
 fidelity to your ruler, is to repeat to him what I say." 
 
 " More wood, Belliues," said Rubaut, going to the door, to 
 give further directions in a low voice. Returning, he said, with 
 some hurry of manner, that, as he was to be absent for two or 
 three days, he had sent for such a supply of wood and flam- 
 beaux as might last some time. More books should also be 
 brought. 
 
 " When shall we meet again P " asked Toussaint.

AN AWFUL FATE, 367 
 
 " I don't know. Indeed I do not know,'' said the Com- 
 mandant, looking at his watch by the firelight. His prisoner 
 saw that his hands trembled, and that he walked with some 
 irresolution to the door. 
 
 " Au revoir !" said Toussaint. 
 
 Rubaut did not reply, but went out, leaving the door standing 
 wide, and apparently no one to guard it. 
 
 Toussaint's heart beat at the thought that this might give 
 him one more opportunity of being abroad in the daylight, 
 perhaps in the sun ! He rose to make the attempt ; but he was 
 exhausted by the conversation he had held — the first for so long ! 
 His aching limbs failed him ; and he sank down on his bed, from 
 which he did not rise tiU long after Bellines had laid down his 
 loads, and left the place. 
 
 The prisoner rose, at length, to walk, as he did many times in 
 the day, from comer to corner of his cell. At the first turn, by 
 the door, he struck his foot against something which he upset 
 It was a pitcher of water, which, with a loaf of bread, had been 
 put in that unusual place. The sight was as distinct in its 
 signification as a yawning grave. His door was to open upon 
 him no more. He was not again to see a human face. The 
 Commandant was to be absent awhile, and, on returning, to find 
 his prisoner dead. 
 
 He used all means that he could devise to ascertain whether 
 it were indeed so. He called BellineS from the door, in the way 
 which Bellines had never failed to reply to since the departure 
 of Mars Plaisir. Bellines did not come. He sang aloud, as he 
 had never before been allowed to sing unchecked, since he entered 
 the fortress. He now sang unchecked. The hour of the after- 
 noon meal passed, and no one came. The evening closed, and 
 no bolt had been drawn. The case was clear. 
 
 The prisoner now and then felt a moment's surprise at expe- 
 riencing so little recoil from such a fate. He was scarcely 
 conscious even of repugfuance. His tranquillity was doubtless 
 owing, in part, to his having long contemplated death in this 
 place as certain ; to life having now little left to make its con- 
 tinuance desirable; and to his knowing himself to be so reduced, 
 that the struggle could not be very long. But he himself 
 believed his composure to be ovring to another cause than any 
 of these. 
 
 " He who appointed me to the work of such a life as mine," 
 thought the dying man, " is making its close easy to His servant. 
 I would vrillingly have suffered to the extremity of His wiU : 
 but my work is done ; men's eyes are_ no longer upon me ; I am 
 alone with Him ; and He is pleased to let me enter already upon 
 my everlasting peace. If Father Laxabon were here, would he 
 now say, as he has often said, and as most men say, that, looking

 bct npon life from its close, it appears short as the time of the 
 rly rains ? Instead of this, how long appear the sixty years 
 at I have lived ! How long, how weary now seems the life 
 hen I was a slave — though much was done, and it was the 
 hooling of my soul for the work preparing for my hand. My 
 !argot ! my children ! how quietly did we then live, as if no 
 lange were ever to come, and we were to sit before our door at 
 reda every evening, tUl death should remove us, one by one! 
 Tiile I was composing my soul to patience by thought and by 
 ading, how little did I dream that I was so becoming prepared 
 free my race, to reign, and then to die of cold and hunger, 
 ich as the meanest slave never knows ! Then the next eight 
 lars of toil — they seem longer than all that went before, 
 oubtless they were lengthened to me, to make my weak powers 
 (ual to the greatness of my task ; for every day of conductiag 
 ar, and making laws, appeared to me stretched out into a year, 
 hese late seasons of reverse have passed over more rapidly, for 
 leir suffering has been less. While all, even to Henri, have 
 tied me during these latter years, they knew not that I was 
 icovering the peace which I shall now no more lose. It is true 
 lat I erred, according to the common estimate of affairs, in 
 )t making myself a king, and separating my country from 
 ranee, as France herself is compelling her to separate at last. 
 1 is true, I might now have been reigning there, instead of 
 jdng here ; and, what is more worthy of meditation, my people 
 ight now have been laying aside their arms, and beginniug a 
 ng career of peace. It might possibly have been so ; but at 
 hat cost ! Their career of freedom (if freedom it could then 
 ive been called) would have begun in treason and in murder ; 
 id the stain would have polluted my race for ever. Now, they 
 ill have freedom still — ^they cannot but have it, though it is 
 jlayed. And upon this freedom will rest the blessing of 
 !eaven. We have not fought for dominion, nor for plunder; 
 )r, as far as I could govern the passions of men, for revenge. 
 Te began our career of freedom in fidelity, in obedience, and in 
 iverence towards the whites ; and therefore may we take to our- 
 Ives the blessing of Him who made us to be free, and demands 
 lat we be so with clean hands and a pure heart. Therefore wiU 
 le freedom of St. Domingo be but the beginning of freedom to 
 le negro race. Therefore may we hope that in this race will 
 le spirit of Christianity appear more fully than it has yet shown 
 self among the proud whites — show itself in its gentleness, its 
 ielity, its disinterestedness, and its simple trust. The proud 
 hites may scorn this hope, and point to the ignorance and the 
 issions of my people, and say, ' Is this your exhibition of the 
 )irit of the Gospel?' But not for this will we give np our 
 jpe. This ignorance, these passions, are natural to all men,

 and are in us aggravated and protracted by our slavery. Remove 
 them by the discipline and the stimulus of freedom, begun in 
 obedience to God and fidelity to men, and there remain the love 
 that embraces all — the meek faith that can bear to be betrayed, 
 but is ashamed to doubt — the generosity that can forgive 
 offences seventy-and-seven times renewed — the simple, open, 
 joyous spirit which marks such as are of the kingdom of heaven. 
 Lord ! I thank Thee that Thou hast made me the sei'vant of 
 this race ! " 
 
 Never, during the years of his lowliness, or the days of his 
 grandeur, had Toussaint spent a brighter hour than now, while 
 the spirit of prophecy (twin-angel with death) visited him, and 
 showed him the realms of mind which were opening before his 
 race — that countless host whose van he had himself led to the 
 confines. This spirit whispered something of the immoi'tality of 
 his own name, hidden, lost as he was in his last hours. 
 
 " Be it so ! " thought he, " if my name can excite any to 
 devotedness, or give to any the pleasure of being grateful. If 
 my name live, the goodness of those who name it will be its life ; 
 for my true self will not be in it. No one will the more know 
 the real Toussaint. The weakness that was in me when I felt 
 most strong, the reluctance when I appeared most ready, the 
 acts of sin from which I was saved by accident alone, the divine 
 constraint of circumstances to which my best deeds were owing 
 — these things are between me and my God. If my name and 
 my life are to be of use, I thank God that they exist ; but this 
 outward existence of them is nothing between Him and me. 
 To me henceforward they no itiore belong than the name of 
 Epaminondas, or the life of Tell. Man stands naked on the 
 brink of the grave, his name sti-ipped from him, and his deeds 
 laid down as the property of the society he leaves behind. Let 
 the name and deeds I now leave behind be a pride to generations 
 yet to come— a more innocent pride than they have sometimes, 
 alas ! been to me. I have done with them." 
 
 Toussaint had often known what hunger was — in the momes 
 he had endured it almost to extremity. He now expected to 
 suffer less from it than then, from being able to yield to the 
 faintness and drowsiness which had then to be resisted. From 
 time to time during his meditations, he felt its sensations visiting 
 him, and felt them without fear or regret. He had eaten his 
 loaf when first hungry, and had watched through the first night, 
 hoping to sleep his long sleep the sooner, when his fire should at 
 length be burned out. During the day, some faint sounds reached 
 him from the valley — some tokens of the existence of men. 
 During the two last nights of his life, his ear was kept awake 
 only by the dropping of water — the old familiar sound — and the 
 occasional stir of tlie brands upon the hearth. About midnight

 of the second night, he fotmd he could sit np no longer. With 
 trembling hands he laid on such pieces of wood as he could lift, 
 lighted another flambeau, and lay down on his straw. He raised 
 himself but once, hastily and dizzily in the dawn (dawn to him, 
 but sunrise abroad). His ear had been reached by the song of 
 the young goatherds, as they led their flock abroad into another 
 TaUey. The prisoner had dreamed that it was his boy Denis, 
 singing in the piazza at Pongaudin. As his dim eye recognised 
 the place, by the flicker of the expiring flambeau, he smiled at 
 his delusion, and sank back to sleep again. 
 
 The Commandant was absent three days. On his return, 
 he summoned Bellines, and said, in the presence of several 
 soldiers — 
 
 "How is the prisoner there?" pointing in the direction of 
 Toussaint's cell. 
 
 " He has been very quiet this morning, sir." 
 
 " Tory quiet ? Do you suppose he is iU ? " 
 
 " He was as well as usual the last time I went to him." 
 
 " He has had plenty of everything, I suppose ? " 
 
 " Oh, yes, sir. Wood, candle, food, water — everything." 
 
 " Very well. Get lights, and I will visit him." 
 
 Lights were brought. A boy, who carried a lantern, shivered 
 as he saw how ghastly Bellines' face looked in the yeUow gleam, 
 in the dark vaiut on the way to the cell, and was not sorry to 
 be told to stay behind, tiU called to light the Commandant back 
 again. 
 
 " Have you heard anything ? " asked Eubaut of the soldier, 
 in a low voice. 
 
 " Not for many hours. There was a call or two, and some 
 singing, just after you went ; but nothing since." 
 
 "Hush! Listen!" 
 
 " They listened motionless for some time ; but nothing was 
 heard but the everlasting plash, which went on all around them. 
 
 " Unbar the door, Bellines." 
 
 He did so, and held the door wide for the Commandant to 
 enter. Bubaut stalked in, and straight up to the straw bed. He 
 called the prisoner in a somewhat agitated voice, felt the hand, 
 raised the head, and declared that he was gone. The candle was 
 burned completely out. Rubaut turned to the hearth, carefully 
 stirred the ashes, blew among them, and raised a spark. 
 
 " Tou observe," he said to Bellines ; " his fire was burning 
 when we found him." 
 
 " Yes, sir." 
 
 " There is more wood and more candle ? " 
 
 "Yes, sir; the wood in this corner, and the candle on the 
 table — just ujider your hand, sir,"

 " Oh, ay, here. Put on some wood, and blow up a flame. 
 Observe, we found Ms fire burning." 
 
 " Tes, sir." 
 
 They soon re-appeared in the courtyard, and announced the 
 death of the prisoner. Bubaut ordered a messenger to be in 
 readiness to ride to Pontarlier, by the time he should have writ- 
 ten a letter. 
 
 " We must have the physicians from Pontarlier," observed 
 the Commandant, aloud, " to examine the deceased, and declare 
 what he died of. The old man has not been well for some time 
 past. I have no doubt the physicians will find that he died of 
 apoplexy, or something of the kind." 
 
 " No wonder, poor soul ! " said a sutler's wife to another 
 woman. 
 
 " No wonder, indeed," replied the other. " My husband died 
 of the heat in St. Domingo; and they took this poor man (don't 
 tell it, but he was a black ; I got a sight of him, and he came 
 from St. Domingo, you may depend upon it) — they took him out 
 of all that heat, and put him into that cold, damp place there ! 
 No wonder he is dead." 
 
 " Well, I never knew we had a black here ! " 
 
 " Don't say I told you, then." 
 
 "I have no doubt-— yes, we found his fire burning," said Bel- 
 lines to the inquirers round him. " They will find it apoplexy, 
 or some such thing, I have no doubt of it." 
 
 And so they did, to the entire satisfaction of the First Consul. 
 
 Tet it was long before the inquiring world knew with cer- 
 tainty what had become of Toussaint L'Ouverture.

APPENDIX. 
 
 Those who feel interest enough in the extraordinary fortunes of 
 Toussaint L'Ouverture to inquire concerning him from the Bio- 
 graphical Dictionaries and Popular Histories of the day, will find 
 in them all the same brief and peremptory decision concerning 
 his character. They all pronounce him to have been a man of 
 wonderful sagacity, endowed with a native genius for both war 
 and government; but savage in warfare; hypocritical in religion 
 — ^using piety as a political mask; and, in all his affairs, the very 
 prince of dissemblers. It is true that this account consists 
 neither with the facts of his life, the opinions of the people he 
 delivered, nor the state documents of the island he governed. 
 Tet it is easy to account for. The first notices of him were 
 French, reported by the discomfited invaders of St. Domingo to 
 writers imbued with the philosophy of the days of the Revo- 
 lution ; and later accounts are copies of these earlier ones. From 
 the time when my attention was first fixed on this hero, I have 
 been struck with the inconsistencies contained in all reports of 
 his character which ascribe to him cruelty and hypocrisy ; and, 
 after a long and careful comparison of such views with his words 
 and deeds, with the evidence obtainable from St. Domingo, and 
 with the temper of his times in France, I have arrived at the 
 conclusion that his character was, in sober truth, such as I have 
 endeavoured to represent it in the foregoing work. 
 
 I do not mean to say that I am the first who has formed an 
 opinion that Toussaint was an honest, a religious, and a mild and 
 merciful man. In an article in the Quarterly JReview (No. xlii.) 
 on the "Past and Present State of Hayti," so interesting an 
 account is given of the great negro, as to cause some wonder that 
 no one has till now been moved hy it to present the facts of his 
 life in the form of an historical novel. In that article it is justly 
 observed that the onus rests with those who accuse Toussaint of 
 hypocrisy to prove their allegation by facts. I would say the 
 same of the other charge, of cruelty. Meanwhile, I disbelieve 
 both charges, for these reasons among others : — 
 
 The wars of St. Domingo were conducted in a most barbarous 
 spirit before the time of Toussaint's acquisition of power, and 
 after his abduction. During the interval, the whole weight of

 his influence was given to curb tlie ferocity of both parties. He 
 pardoned Ms personal enemies (as in the instance of the mulat- 
 toes iu the church) ; and he punished in his followers, as the 
 most unpardonable offence they could commit, any infringement 
 of his rule of " No Retaliation." When it is considered that 
 the cruelties perpetrated in the rising of 1791, and renewed after 
 the fall of Toussaint, were invented by the whites, and copied 
 by the negroes (who were wont to imitate their mastei-s in all 
 they did), it is no small evidence of L'Ouverture's magnanimity 
 that he conceived, illustrated, and enforced, in such times, such 
 a principle as that of No Retaliation. 
 
 All the accounts of him agree that, from his earliest childhood, 
 he was distinguished by a tenderness of nature which would 
 not let him hurt a fly. He attached to himself the cattle and 
 horses which were under his charge when a boy, to a degree 
 which made him famous in a region where cruelty to animals at 
 the hands of slaves was almost universal. A man who lived 
 tUl fifty, remarkable for a singular gentleness and placability, 
 ought not to be believed sanguinary from that time forward, 
 on the strength of the unsupported charges of his disappoiuted 
 enemies. 
 
 Piety was also his undisputed early characteristic. A slave 
 bringing to the subject of religion the aptitude of the negro 
 nature, early treated with kindness by a priest, evincing the 
 spirit of piety from his infant years, finding in it the conso- 
 lations required by a life of slavery, and guided by it in a course 
 of the strictest domestic morality, while surrounded by licen- 
 tiousness, may well be supposed siacere in his religion, under a 
 change of circumstances occurring after he was fifty years of 
 age. The imputation of hypocrisy is not, however, much to be 
 wondered at when it is considered that, at the time when the 
 first notices of Toussaint were written at Paris, it was the 
 fashion there to believe that no wise man could be sincerely 
 religious. 
 
 As for the charge of general and habitual dissimulation, it can 
 only be said that while no proof of the assertion is offered, there 
 is evidence, in all the anecdotes preserved of him, of absolute 
 frankness and simplicity. I rather think that it was the in- 
 credible extent of his simplicity which gave rise to the belief that 
 it was assumed, in order to hide cunning. The Qwartsrly Review 
 quotes an anecdote thoroughly characteristic of the man, which 
 is not introduced into my story, because, in the abundance of 
 my materials, I found it necessary to avoid altogether the history 
 of the English transactions iu St. Domingo. It was only by 
 confining my narrative to the relations between Toussaint and 
 Prance that I could keep my tale within limits, and preserve the 
 clearness of the representation. There are circumstances, how-

 ever, in his intercourse with the British, as honourable to 
 Toussaint's character as any that I have related; and among 
 them is the following, which I quote from the Quarterly Review. 
 
 " General Maitland, preTious to the disembarkation of the 
 troops, returned the visit at Toussaint's camp ; and such was his 
 confidence in the integrity of his character, that he proceeded 
 through a considerable extent of country, full of armed negroes, 
 with only three attendants. Roume, the French Commissary, 
 wrote a letter to Toussaint, on this occasion, advising him to 
 seize his guest, as an act of duty to the republic : on the route. 
 General Maitland was secretly informed of Eoume's treachery ; 
 but, in f uE reliance on the honoiir of Toussaint, he determined 
 to proceed. On arriving at head-quarters, he was desired to 
 wait. It was some time before Toussaint made his appearance ; 
 at length, however, he entered the room with two open letters iu 
 his hand. ' There, General,' said he, ' before we talk together, 
 read these. One is a letter from the French Commissary — the 
 other is my answer. I could not see you till I had written my 
 reply, that you might be satisfied how safe you were with me, 
 and how incapable I am of baseness.' " — Quarterly Review, vol. 
 xxi., p. 442. 
 
 The charge of personal ambition is, above all, contradicted by 
 facts. If anything is clear in Toussaint's history, it is that Ms 
 ruin was owing to his loyalty to France, his misplaced trust in 
 Napoleon, and his want of personal ambition. He did not, as 
 he might have done, make himself a sovereign when France was 
 wholly occupied with European warfare. He did not, as he 
 might have done, prepare his people to resist the power of the 
 mother-country, when she shotdd at length be at liberty to re- 
 claim the colony. He sent away the French commissaries only 
 when, by their ignorance and incompetency, they imperilled the 
 peace and safety of the colony. He cherished the love of the 
 mother-country in the hearts of the negroes, to the very last 
 moment — ^till the armament which came to re-establish slavery 
 appeared on the shores — till it was too late to offer that re- 
 sistance which would have made him a king. Ohristophe's view 
 of this part of his conduct is given in a manifesto, dated in the 
 eleventh year of the Independence of Hayti : — 
 
 " Toussaint L'Ouverture, under his paternal administration, 
 had reinstated, in full, force, law, morals, religion, education, and 
 industry. Agriculture and commerce were flouri'shiug. He 
 favoured the white colonists, particularly the planters. Indeed, 
 his attentions and partialities had been carried to such a length, 
 that he was loudly blamed for entertaining more affection for 
 them than for thosei of his own colour. Nor was this reproach 
 without foundation ; for, a few months before the arrival of the 
 French, he sacrificed his own nephew, General Moyse, who had

 disregarded the orders he had given for the protection of tlie 
 colonists. That act of the Governor, added to the great con- 
 fidence he had placed iu the French authorities, vras the prin- 
 cipal cause of the feeble resistance the French encountered in 
 Hayti. Indeed, his confidence in these authorities was such, 
 that he had discharged the greater part of the regular troops, 
 and sent them back to the tiilage of the soil." — HaytianPoupers, 
 p. 158. 
 
 Such conduct is a sufficient answer to the allegation that 
 Toussaint was actuated by a selfish ambition, cimning in its 
 aims, and cruel in its use of means. 
 
 Some light is thrown upon the character of his mind by the 
 record of the books he studied while yet a slave. Rainsford 
 gives a list, which does not pretend to be complete, but which is 
 valuable as far as it goes. It appears that in his years of com- 
 parative leisure he was completely engrossed by one book at a 
 time, reading it at all spare moments, meditating its contents 
 while in the field, and quoting it in conversation for weeks 
 together. One of the first authors whose works thus entirely 
 jjossessed him was Raynal : afterwards, Epictetus, in a French 
 translation ; then others, as follows : — 
 Scriptores de Re Militari. 
 
 CsBsar's Commentaries. French translation, by De Orisse. 
 Des Olaison's History of Alexander and Caesar. 
 D'Orleans' History of Revolutions in England and Spain. 
 Marshal Saxe's Military Reveries. 
 
 Guischard's Military Memoirs of the Greeks and Romans. 
 Herodotus. 
 
 Le Beau's Memoirs of the Academy of Inscriptions and 
 BcUes-Lettres. 
 
 Lloyd's Military and Political Memoirs. 
 English Socrates, Plutarch, Cornelius Nepos, &e. &c. 
 Great mystery hangs over the tale of Toussaint's imprisonment 
 and death. It appears that he was confined in the Temple only 
 as long as Napoleon had hopes of extorting from him information 
 about the treasures, absurdly reported to have been buried by 
 him in the momes,* under circumstances of atrocious cruelty. 
 It has been suggested that torture was employed by Bonaparte's 
 aide, CafEarelli, to procure the desired confession; but I do not 
 know that the conjecture is founded on any evidence. 
 
 As to the precise mode of L'Ouvertnre's death, there is no 
 certainty. The only point on which all authorities agree is, that 
 he was deliberately murdered; but whether by mere confine- 
 ment in a cell whose floor was covered with water, and the

 walls with ice Ca conliuemeut necessarily fatal to a negro), or 
 by poison, or by starvation iu conjunction with disease, may 
 perhaps never bo known. The report which is, I believe, the 
 most generally believed iu France is that which I have adoptoil— 
 that the Commandant, when his prisoner was extremely ill, loft 
 the fortress for two or three days, with the key of Toussaint's 
 cell in his pocket; that, on his return, he found his prisoner 
 dead; and that he summoned physicians from Pontarlier, wlio 
 examined the body, and pronounced a serous apoplexy to be the 
 cause of death. It so happened that I was able, in the spring 
 of last year, to make some inquiry upon the spot ; the result of 
 which I wiU relate. 
 
 I was travelling in Switzerland with a party of friends, witli 
 whom I had one day discussed the fortunes and character of 
 Toussaint. I had then no settled purpose of writing about him, 
 but was strongly urged to it by my companions. On the morning 
 of the 15th of May, when we were drawing near Payerne from 
 Freyburg, on our way to Lausanne, I remembered and men- 
 tioned that we were not very far from the fortress of Joux, where 
 Toussaint's bones lay. My party were all eager that I should 
 visit it. There were difficulties in the way of the scheme — the 
 cldef of which was that our passports were not so signed as to 
 enable us to enter France; and the nearest place where the 
 necessary signature could be obtained was Berne, which we had 
 left behind us the preceding day. I had, however, very fortu- 
 nately a Secretary of State's passport, besides the Prussian 
 Consul's ; and this second passport, made out for myseK and a 
 femme-de-chamhre, had been signed by the French Minister in 
 London. One of my kind companions offered to cross the frontier 
 with me, as my femme-de-chamhre, and to help me in obtaining 
 access to the prison of Toussaint; an offer I was very thankful 
 to accept. At Payerne, we separated ourselves and a very 
 small portion of luggage from our party, whom we promised to 
 overtake at Lausanne in two or three days. We engaged for 
 the trip a double char-a-banc, with two stout little horses, and a 
 brave homme of a driver, as our courteous landlady at Payerne 
 assured us. Passing through Tverdun, we reached Orbe by five 
 in the afternoon, and took up our quarters at the " Guillaume 
 Tell," full of expectation for the morrow. 
 
 On the 16th, we had breakfasted, and were beginning the 
 ascent of the Jura before seven o'clock. The weather was fine, 
 and we enjoyed a succession of interesting objects, till we reached 
 that which was the motive of our excursion. First we had that 
 view of the Alps which, if it wore possible, it would be equally 
 useless to describe to any who have and any who have not stood 
 on the eastern slope of the Jura, on a clear day. Then we wound 
 among the singular defiles of this mountain range, till we reached 
 


## p. (#382) ################################################

378 THE HOUR AND THE MAN. 
 
 the valley which is commanded by Jougne. Here we alighted, 
 climbing the slope to the gate of the town, while the carriage was 
 slowly dragged up the steep winding road. Our appearance 
 obviously perplexed the two custom-house officers, who questioned 
 us, and peeped into our one bag and our one book (the Handbook 
 of Switzerland) with an amusing air of suspicion. My companion 
 told them that the aim of our journey was the fortress of Joux ; 
 and that we expected to pass the frontier again in the afternoon, 
 on our return to Orbe. Whether they believed us, or, believing, 
 thought us very foolish, is best known to themselves ; but I sus- 
 pect the latter, by their compliments on our cleverness, on our 
 return. At Jougne we supplied ourselves with provisions, and 
 then proceeded through valleys, each narrower than the last, 
 more dismal with pines, and more chequered with snow. The 
 air of desolation, nere and there rendered more striking by 
 the dreary settlements of the charcoal-burners, would have 
 been impressive enough, if our minds had not been full of the 
 great negro, and therefore disposed to view everything with Ms 
 eyes. 
 
 The scene was exactly what I have described in my story, 
 except that a good road, made since Toussaint's time, now passes 
 round and up the opposite side of the rock from that by which 
 he mounted. The old road, narrow and steep, remains ; and we 
 descended by it. 
 
 We reached the courtyard without difficulty, passing the two 
 drawbridges and portcullis described. The Commandant was 
 absent ; and his lieutenant declared against our seeing anything 
 more than the great wheel, and a small section of the battle- 
 ments. But for great perseverance, we should have seen nothing 
 more; but we obtained, at last, all we wanted. We passed 
 through the vault and passages I have described, and thoroughly 
 examined the cell. No words can convey a sense of its dreari- 
 ness. I have exaggerated nothing — ^the dim light, the rotten 
 floor, shining like a pond, the drip of water, the falling flakes of 
 ice, were all there. The stove was removed ; but we were shown 
 where it stood. 
 
 There were only three persons who pretended to possess any 
 information concerning the negro prisoner. The solmer who was 
 our principal guide appeared never to have heard of him. Avery 
 old man in the village, to whom we were referred, could tell us 
 nothing but one fact, which I knew before — that Toussaint was 
 deprived of his servant, some time before his death. A woman 
 in the sutler's department of the fortress pretended to know all 
 about him ; but she had never seen him, and had no further title 
 to authority than that her first husband had died in the St. 
 Domingo invasion. She did us the good service of pointing out 
 the grave, however. The brickwork which surrounds the coffin

 now forms part of a new wall ; but it was till lately within the 
 church. 
 
 This woman's story was that which was probably given out 
 on the spot, to be told to inquirers ; so inconsistent is it in itself, 
 and with known facts. Her account was, that Toussaint was 
 carried off from St. Domingo by the ship in which he was ban- 
 queted by Leclerc (the last of a line of two hundred), weighing 
 anchor without his perceiving it, while he was at dinner. The 
 absurdity of this beginning shows how much reliance is to b3 
 placed upon the rest of her story. She declared that the Com- 
 mandant Rubaut had orders from the Government to treat the 
 prisoner well ; that his servant remained with him to the last ; 
 that he was well supplied with books, allowed the range of the 
 fortress, and accustomed to pass his days in the house of the 
 Commandant, playing cards in the evenings : that on the last 
 night of his life he excused himself from the card-table, on the 
 plea of being unwell ; that he refused to have his servant with 
 him, though urged not to pass the night alone ; that he was left 
 with fire, fauteuil, flambeaux, and a book, and found dead in his 
 chair in the morning f and that the physicians who examined the 
 body declared his death to have been caused by the rupture of a 
 blood-vessel in the heart. This last particular is known to be as 
 incorrect as the first. As for the rest, this informant differs from 
 all others in saying that Mars Plaisir remained with his master 
 to the last day of his life ; and we may ask why Toussaint's 
 nights were to be passed in his horrible cell, if his days were so 
 favoured ; and how it was that no research availed to discover to 
 the eager curiosity of all Europe and the West Indies the retreat 
 of L'Ouverture, if he, a negro, was daily present to the eyes of 
 the garrison of the fortress, and to those of all the inhabitants of 
 the village, and of all the travellers on that road who chose to 
 raise their eyes to the walls. 
 
 Our third informant was a boy, shrewd and communicative, 
 who could tell us the traditions of the place ; and, of course, 
 young as he was, nothing more. It was he who showed us 
 where the additional stove was placed when winter came on. 
 He pointed to a spot beside the fireplace, where he said the 
 straw was spread on which Toussaint lay. He declared that 
 Toussaint lived and died in solitude ; and that he was found 
 dead and cold, lying on that straw — his wood-fire, however, not 
 being wholly extinguished. 
 
 The dreary impressions of the place saddened our minds for 
 long after we had left it; and, glad as we were, on rejoining our 
 party at Lausanne, to report the complete success of our enter- 
 prise, we cannot recur to it, to this day, without painful feelings. 
 
 How the lot of Toussaint was regarded by the generous spirits 
 of the time is shown in a sonnet of Wordsworth's, written

 during the disappearance of L'Ouverture. Every one knows 
 this sonnet ; but it may be read by others, as by me, with a 
 fresh emotion of delight, after having dwelt on the particulars 
 of the foregoing history. 
 
 " Toussaint, the most unhappy Man of Men ! 
 Whether the whistling rustic tend his plough 
 Within thy hearing, or thy head be now 
 Pillow'd in some deep dungeon's earless den : — 
 O miserable Chieftain ! where and when 
 WUt thou find patience ? Yet die not : do thou 
 Wear rather in thy bonds a cheerful brow : 
 Though fallen thyself, never to rise again, 
 Live, and take comfort. Thou hast left behind 
 Powers that will work for thee : air, earth, and skies 
 There's not a breathing of the common wind 
 That will forget thee : thou hast great allies ; 
 Thy friends are exultations, agonies. 
 And love, and Man's unconquerable mind." 
 
 The family of Toussaint were first sent to Bayonne, and after- 
 wards to Agen, where one of the sons died of a decline. The 
 two elder ones, endeavouring to escape from the surveillance 
 under which they lived, were embarked for Belle Isle, and im- 
 prisoned in the citadel, where they were seen in 1803. On the 
 restoration of the Bourbons, not only were they released, but a 
 pension was settled on the family. Madame L'Ouverture died, 
 I believe, in the South of France, in 1816, in the arms of Placide 
 and Isaac. 
 
 What Napoleon afterwards thought of the dungeon of Tous- 
 saint, is known through an anecdote which I have received from 
 high authority. 
 
 The next occupant of Toussaint's cell was the Duo de Riviere, 
 afterwards the first Trench ambassador to Constantinople. The 
 Due (then Marquis) was a young man, on the point of marriage 
 with Mademoiselle de la Perte, when, for some unknown offence, 
 he was thrown into prison at Joux, and apparently forgotten. 
 There he wasted three of the best years of his life. Mademoiselle 
 de la Ferte never relaxed in her efforts to obtain his liberation ; 
 but she was told, at length, that Napoleon was weary of her 
 solicitations, and that further efforts on her part would have no 
 better result than increasing the displeasure of the Emperor. In 
 the hour of her despair, the kind-heartedness of Josephine came 
 to hor aid. The ladies caused a model of the cell at Joux to be 
 prepared — bearing the most exact resemblance to the horrible 
 abode ; and this model Josephine placed, with her own hands, on 
 the bureau of the Emperor. 
 
 " All ! fi done ! Quel est ce lieu abominable ? " said the 
 Emperor.

APPENDIX. 3S1 
 
 The Empress informed him that it was one of his Majesty's 
 state prisons ; to which he replied that it was impossible ; that 
 no man could live four-and-twenty hours in such a den. This 
 brought out the information that the Marqids de Biviere had 
 lived three years in it, and was still lying there, by his Majesty's 
 commands. 
 
 " Otez-moi sa ! " cried the Emperor, tartly. " Cette vue me 
 fait frdmir." 
 
 The model was removed. The Marquis was presently after- 
 wards liberated. He retired to Germany, where he was met by 
 Mademoiselle de la Perte, whom he there married. In after- 
 years he was fond of relating the anecdote which I have given, 
 as nearly as possible, in his method and language. 
 
 For some years I have read whatever came within my reach 
 on the subject of my present work : so that it would not now be 
 easy to assign my authority for every view and every statement 
 it contains. The authorities which I have principally consulted 
 whUe actually writing, I will, however, give. They are — Rains- 
 ford's " Historical Account of the Black Empire of Hayti ; " the 
 above-mentioned article in the Quarterly Review; Bryan 
 Edwards's "St. Domingo"; the article " Toussaint L'Ouverture," 
 in the " Biographie Universelle ; " and the " Haytian Papers," 
 edited by Prince Sanders. 
 
 Of these, Bryan Edwards, who did not live to complete his 
 history, barely names my hero ; and the reports he gives of Ihe 
 Revolution of St. Domingo are useful chiefly as representing the 
 prejudices, as well as the interests, of the planters. The article 
 in the Qaarterly is valuable, as being an able and liberal digest 
 of various narratives ; some derived from Hayti itself. Rains- 
 ford's book is nearly unreadable, from the absurdity of its style ; 
 but it is truly respectable in my eyes, notwithstanding, from its 
 high appreciation of L'Ouverture's character. It contains more 
 information concerning Toussaint than can be found, I believe, 
 anywhere else, except in the Biographie ; and it has the advan- 
 tage of detailing what fell under the writer's own observation. 
 The Biographie furnishes many valuable facts ; but appears, 
 from the inconsistency of various part^, and the confused im- 
 pression which it conveys as a whole, to be a compilation in 
 which the workman has been more careful to record dates aud 
 other facts correctly, than to understand the personage whose 
 portrait he professes to give. The " Haytian Papers " are the 
 most valuable of all authorities, as far as they go. 
 
 Of my other personages, all had a real existence, except M. 
 Revel, Euphrosyne, and their servants ; some of the planters 
 Tuentioned in the second chapter ; the ishildren of Bellair ; the

 Abbess and her establishment; and some of the Tisitors at 
 Tonssaint's leree ; with a few other subordinate characters. 
 
 Of the real personages, several were probably very unlike what 
 I have represented them. I knew the names of some, without 
 knowing their characters ; as in the instances of Placide and 
 Isaac, MM. Pascal and Moliere, Mars Plaisir, Madame Oge, the 
 Marquis d'Hermona, Laxabon, Vincent, and Paul. 
 
 Of others, I knew the character and history, without being 
 able to ascertain the names ; as in the instances of Madame 
 DessaJines and Madame Bellair. Since the issue of my first 
 edition, I have learned that the name of Madame Dessalines 
 was Marie ; and her second name, before marriage, Claire or 
 Clerc. I have not thought it advisable to substitute Marie for 
 Therese in this edition, as nothing could be thereby gained 
 which would compensate for disturbing the associations of my 
 readers in regard to one of the chief personages of the story. 
 
 Of others, such as the wife, daughters, and third son of Tous- 
 saint, M. Papalier, and the tutors, Azua and Loisir, I knew only 
 that they existed, without being able to learn their names or 
 characters. The only character designed to be folly and faith- 
 fully acenrdaut with history is that of Toussaint himself. 
 Those which have much, but less absolute, pretension to his- 
 torical truth are those of Jean Prangais, Christophe, Dessalines, 
 and the other negro G-enerals, old Dessalines, Bellair, Raymond, 
 tlie French Commissaries and Envoys, Bayon, and Moyse.
