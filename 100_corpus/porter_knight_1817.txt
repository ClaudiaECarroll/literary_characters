Favourably blew the vernal breezes, as
a weather-beaten vessel steered for the
port of Genoa, late one evening, in
the year 1568. Her crew were all on
the deck, welcoming, after an absence
of four years among distant seas, the
sight of their blue gulf, and their na-
tive city.
That majestic city was now only dimly
seen, reflected from the crystal mirror
below; for the sun had been long set,
and but the faintest purple remained in

ject, undulating with the waves, still
possessed charms for those in whose me-
mories it was associated with ideas of
home and domestic joy. Now broken
by a crossing sail or a dashing oar; now
uniting and forming again into the same
shapes of shadowy beauty; now gra-
dually assuming darker and less distinct
outlines, the visionary picture at last
melted into one with the gray and uni-
form water. - -
But the moon rises; and as the shout-
ing mariners approach the pharos, the
proud city is again seen in all her glory,
encircling the bay as with a diadem.

theatre of towers, and spires, and domes;
of churches, and convents, and palaces!
There rise her lofty cypress groves |
There hang her aerial gardens! There
spread her gilded trellises blushing with
flowers and fruits; her sparkling foun-
tains, her marble terraces descending to

lant vessels, and her protecting hills glit-
tering with villas and with vineyards!
- The broad moonlight now covers sea
and shore with a flood of molten silver;
the white-winged vessel gleams like a
meteor as she glides swiftly onwards;
she approaches the moles and the cita-
del—she passes them: now they recede
from her forward course, – she reaches
the port, — she casts anchor, and the
next moment all her crew are on land. . .
One young man, exchanging hasty
adieus with his companions, broke from
the party,’ and hastened forwards with
the eager step of joy. His progress was
stopped in the Strada Balbi, by a crowd
assembled before the gates of the seig-
niory. Having in vain urged his way
by vehement actions and exclamations,
he found the throng too solid to pene-
trate; and, forced to submit, turned to-
wards a person next him, enquiring, in
no patient tone, what all this meant.

- “It is the last day of the Adimari
and Cigala trial,” replied the gentleman
he questioned. - -
* “The Adimari and Cigala trialſ” re-
peated his questioner with a look of
astonishment: “Have the goodness,
signor, to tell me the particulars ”
Without remarking the very remark-
able expression which suddenly changed
the animated countenance of the stranger,
the Genoese proceeded to satisfy his cu-
riosity. - * -
“The present dispute is about an
estate at Nervi, which was sold, some
two hundred years ago, by one of the
Cigali to one of the Adimari. It re-
mained in the hands of the Adimari
from that day till about two years ago,
when Signor Cigala laid claim to it, in
right of descent from the original pos-
sessors: offering to show proof, that it
was so secured to the next of kin at the
time in which his ancestor sold it, as to
be incapable of alienation while any of

the direct line remained. Adimari sup-
ported his right to a property which his.
family had fairly bought, and kept quiet
possession of for two centuries. The suit
was drawn out to great length, from the
novelty of the case, the display of proofs
and papers, the various altercations of
the lawyers, &c.; — but to-day was an-
nounced for the termination; and, though
the sitting is protracted to a most unsea-
sonable hour, we are all still waiting, im-
patient to know the decision of the
judges.” . . . - -
“ They cannot give it in Cigala's fa-
vour!” exclaimed the young man, with
some degree of indignant warmth.
“Very few wish they should,” rejoined
his companion; “for it is shrewdly sus-
pected, that these vexatious family-re-
gisters have been dragged forth by Cigala
to satisfy an old grudge he bore to Adi-
mari when a youth. He might have
been contented with the triumph he
gained over him, some fifteen years ago,

injury galled poor Adimari sorely ; but

resentment, though he felt injury. — If

the closeness of the press. -

tures, the people around pronounced him
dead; and humanity soon effected, what
nothing else could have done: the sym-
pathising crowd broke asunder, pressed

persons who were endeavouring to bear
him forward to the portico of the Pa-
lazzo; and some one recognising his
lineaments, or fancying a resemblance,
as he was borne by, whispered his name.
“It is Adimari’s son " repeated one
to another; and as they followed him
with their eyes, low murmurs of pity
succeeded to the clamour of curiosity
and impatience.
The doors, that had so long been
watched, now flew open, and a mixed
multitude poured forth; all wearing the
emblem of the Cigali triumphantly in
their caps.
The shouts of the one party, and the
execrations of the other, were unnoticed,
and scarcely heard by the outer crowd:
their attention had fastened upon another
object; and thcy now trampled down
each other, anxious to catch a glimpse
of the sufferer, and to ascertain whether
he were indeed their fellow-citizen.
When this unfortunate son (for it was

found himself principally supported by a
young man, whose prepossessing coun-
tenance was expressive of deep interest.
He felt this person's hand tremble in
assisting him to rise; and he observed
that his garments were sprinkled with
blood. This person then had held him,
while the vein had been opened which
Cesario now felt stiffening in his arm.
“I thank you, signor!” he said in an
agitated voice. “I thank you all, my
countrymen!— I will go home now —

Gushing into tears as he spoke, and
unable to resist their salutary violence,
he leaned his face against one of the
gates; again he felt the cold agitated
touch of the hand which had so recently
pressed his : it was colder and more tre- .
mulous than at first.

licly displaying his feelings, and into
livelier gratitude for the compassion be-
stowed on him, Cesario was pulling his
cloke round him to depart, when, in di-
recting his eye towards the benevolent
stranger, with a look that still asked his
sympathy, he saw in his cap the hated
myrtle-branch of the Cigali.
His eye changed. “You are a Cigala,
then P. s. -
“.. I am.”: " -
Some of the crowd murmured, in un-
der voices, “Giovanni Cigala.”
Cesario started at the sound; the
scathing of a glance keener than anycurse
ever uttered by hatred, was all the an-
swer he vouchsafed to the son of the man
who had stripped his father of compe-
tence and life. He shook off the grasp
that would have detained him; and,
springing down the steps of the portico
with sudden strength, was out of sight,
and beneath friendly shelter, ere nature
again gave way under the shock of fuller

information, and the certainty of utter
Tulln. - -
Many days elapsed,—days of alternate
grief and indignation: for Cesario
mourned the loss of a parent dearer
than his life’s blood; and saw himself
reduced to beggary and dependence.
The bulk of his expected inheritance
had consisted of the estate just wrested
from him. His father was a man of
nobler pursuits than fortune: in his early
youth he had served in the fleet of the
Republic, but with more honour than
profit; and in later life he entered into
commercial speculations. -
- In Genoa, the gentry, and second class
of nobility, are permitted to unite mer-
cantile concerns with their boast of pa-
trician quality; and Adimari, having em-
barked in them, had ventured rather too
far in the hope of increasing the fortune
of this darling son.

of one of his richest vessels, in a Portu-

guese Indian settlement, Adimari had
been induced to send his son thither,
charged with documents necessary for
the release of the ship. A voyage to the
East was, in those days, long and dan-
gerous: Cesario encountered the perils
and pains of its difficult navigation; and
endured, afterwards, the vexation of
combating for his rights with an arbi-
trary governor, determined to keep the
prize he detained under imaginary pre-
tences. - - -
An act of self-defence, made by some
of the crew during a visit on shore, was
construed into a piratical attack: and
the ship and cargo being formally con-
demned as forfeited to the government
of Goa, Cesario returned to Europe,
comforting himself under this disappoint-
ment by the certainty of finding affluence
and peace at home.
But during four years, his father had
suffered many other losses; and, the
Nervi estate gone, nothing remained to

berry grounds at Polchiverra; the annual
products of which would fall far short of
the sums demanded to defray the debts
contracted during his absence in this
disastrous law-suit. He was resolved,
however, to pay them; and he instantly
made himself answerable to all the cre.
ditors. -
* What madness P’ said one of his
kinsmen to him : “ you are destroying
yourself, - that wretched remnant of
property, comes to you in right of your
mother's settlement; it cannot be touch-
ed by your father's creditors: why con-
tract this needless engagement?”
“ Needless, do you call it?” inter-
rupted Cesario; “needless to preserve
my father's name without reproach not
that unspotted name is all he had left
to bequeath me; and I will preserve the
precious legacy with my life.”

“Are much for a man who has not
quite the sixth part of that sum to live

I will do it, or perish in prison; and so
add another damning sin to the cata-

the money, perhaps, for ten or twenty
years possession—meanwhile I must find
bread with my sword.” . . . . s ,

arose in forms of startling reality, and
made him live the past again.
* In imagination he walked beneath the
lofty plane-trees that shaded the terrace
at Nervi, conversing with his father;
‘now and then stopping to list the soft
laving of the tide against the steps which
led into the sea; or leaning over the
balustrade, to watch the progress of a
skiff, or the flight of a bird: the gracious
voice he was never again to hear on
earth, fell on his ear in accents of tender-
mess and instruction; they talked of Ce-
sario's meditated voyage, they anticipated
a joyful meeting after two years of sepa-
ration. Cesario's lips were just sealed
on his father's hand with filial fondness,
when the door of the apartment he
really sat in, opened hastily, and the
vision vanished. -
Rising in disorder, he looked with in-
dignant amazement upon the person that
entered : it was Giovanni Cigala.

demanded Cesario.
“It means any thing but offence,”
replied the former, gently, but steadily
advancing. -
“You come for my thanks, perhaps,”
said the other abruptly, “ for services
rendered me in the portico of the seig-
niory? You have them, signor. I thank
you.-I thank you ! There ! do not urge
me further.” i
He turned away as he concluded, and
leaned against a window frame; evidently
desirous of thus terminating the inter-
view. - . . .
Giovanni still advanced, though with
an air of respect and dignity. “I should
not have intruded on you, signor, with
any selfish errand, earnestly as I desire
to cultivate mutual good-will ;” (Cesario
cast on him a glance of disdain; Gio-
vanni proceeded;) “but I come to do
you an act of justice; to make some

you would have me endure your sight

The impassioned young man dashed
his forehead against his hand in a phrenzy
of recollection, and vainly tried to stifle
a groan.
Giovanni looked at him with increas:
ing commiseration; a feeling of another
sort reddened his cheek, and altered his
voice as he said, “ The cause of this in-
dignation honours you too much, signor,
for me to remind you in strong terms,
that I, too, am a son; but you must allow
me to execute my commission: — I pray
you permit me!” >
Cesario did not answer; his generous
soul was moved, in spite of himself, by
the noble manner of his imagined enemy;

he could not close his sense against the
inexpressible charm of his voice; but he
would not trust himself to look upon
him. Giovanni's was, indeed, such a
countenance as Raphael might have
chosen for the favourite disciple of our
Lord : a serene breadth of forehead,
with “ heavenly hair,” parting from it
in ample waves; large dove-like eyes;
and that fair composure of complexion,
which bespeaks the calm of goodness,
To this countenance was joined a figure,
of which the eminent gracefulness first
caught attention; but, on second ob-
servation, its large proportions denoted
power, the power of strength; and then
the gentleness of his countenance seemed
but the more gracious,
As Cesario still kept silence, Giovanni
approached him; and weighing every
word, ere it fell from him, lest it should
wound the delicacy, or kindle the inflam-
mable passions of his unwilling hearer,
he opened his commission, .

It was a request, that Cesario would
be pleased to receive the value of the
estate at Nervi; at the same time assur-
ing him, that, although the Cigali family
could not allow the right of their title to
be disputed, (since indeed the most satis-
factory proofs of that right had been
sanctified by the decision of incorruptible
judges,) they abhorred the idea of ravish-
ing it from one who had hitherto believed
himself its undoubted heir.—What they
were content to receive at the hands of
justice, therefore, was only the power of
restoring this estate to the property from
which it had been unlawfully dismem-
bered two centuries back.
They prayed him to consider them as
its purchasers; and having had the estate
valued, Giovanni was come to proffer the
sum named. He would have laid a very
heavy bag of ducats on the table as he con-
cluded, had not Cesario sprung forward
with the fierceness of a tyger, and pushed
122
it back. “ Have your race hearts ſ” ex-

claimed he indignantly, “ that you be-
lieve I am sorrowing over a few bags of
dross? Not all the Wealth of Peru can
be a compensation to me: take back
your ducats. I would neither have sold
nor given my birth-place to any man;
and though the law has basely awarded
it to you, I may die a beggar and in
prison, but never will I seal the triumph
of the Cigali, by accepting gold from
them as a boon.” - -
“I would your just grief were less in-
temperate!” said Giovanni patiently; “you
would then admit that we have right on
our side, though grievous has been its
enforcement.” - -
“I care not for right, I know not
where it lies; I seek not to discover !”
interrupted Cesario, bursting forth anew ;
“I am only certain that I would not
have acted thus by my direst foe; there-
fore I despise ye. I know that this hate-
- ful contest ruined my father's affairs, and
broke his heart, therefore I hate ye! Go

then—never let me see you more, or I
know not whither my distraction and
despair may lead me.” Again he struck
his clasped hands against his forehead,
and stopped for want of breath. -
“I will bear any thing from you, just
now,” said Giovanni, speaking quick
and short; “for I see you are not your-
self. You cannot hate me, you cannot
be so unjust, you must see that I am not
a hard and merciless man. - .
“Oh, you court popularity perhaps º'
exclaimed Cesario, maddened by the in-
dulgence he was giving to his passions:
“’tis fit you do; for I can tell you, that
where my father lies buried, there lies
all the honour of your race.” ''
“Popularity!” murmured Giovanni, and
a tear glistened in his mildly reproachful
eye. -
'Twas an injurious suspicion, and Ce.
sario had rather uttered than thought it:
he now stood gloomily silent; ashamed
of his own intemperance, yet jealous of

favour of a Cigala.
Could he have known with what cou-
rageous nobleness this insulted man had
braved the anger of a worldly-minded
parent, while convincing him that human
nature called aloud for a compensation
to Cesario Adimari; could he have known
that after a long and painful struggle,
Giovanni had finally wrested consent, by
solemnly swearing to renounce the world,
unless this feeble consolation were afford-
ed to his distressed spirit; could he have
known this, even in the heat and transport
of his passion, Cesario must have thrown
himself upon the breast of Cigala, and
besought his pardon. As it was, he
laboured with his contending emotions
in silence. - -
“Then, I may not hope to move your
purpose 2" asked Giovanni. “You mo-
tion me to leave you: I will do so. But

name of Christian charity, not to judge ;

Cigala, it is true — the son of him by
whom fate has dealt its severest blow to
you... I even feel as if I had been instru-
mental in your misfortunes, (yet, God
knows, I am not!) and I would fain be
allowed to offer some atonement, not in
the shape of gold— not in the shape of
vain dissipation, but in that of devoted
service. In truth, I would rather win .
your friendship than the love of the fair-
est woman in Italy.” - -
He paused, somewhat overcome, and
proffered his hand. — Cesario turned
hastily round, perusing him from head
to foot with struggling feelings: but pride
and false opinion had the mastery; and
he said, bitterly, “Perhaps you come to
mock me with this amazing show of
goodness : — I’ll not believe in it.”
“Fancy our situations changed,” said
Giovanni, earnestly; “how would you,
then, have acted P” - -

by this fierce accusation, and his cheek
losing its colour; “they will convince
you, that resumption of right is not rob-
bery: and, for the last charge, Heaven
only is answerable.— My father, possibly,
guessed your father's heart as ill, as you
do mine. Farewell, signor l’” -
His voice faltered, but his counte-
nance had assumed an expression of
offended virtue, which approached to
awfulness; he staid not for reply: the
door closed on him; and Cesario was left
standing in a painful confusion of irri-
tated and self-accusing feeling,

with a swelling heart, he thought over
the scene which had just passed; and
while he blamed the determined animo-

ardent nature, perhaps never restrained,

prized in life.

have been supposed the results of philo-

philosophy in it, if by that term we
are to understand the austere discipline

Concealing under the serenity of a
temper incapable of disturbance, feelings
peculiarly sensitive, and a mind highly
exalted by romantic and religious stu-
dies, Giovanni had, at a very early age,
felt the full force of the master-passion.
He was a younger son, with more graces
than wealth for his portion: it was his
destiny to love a coquet, by whom he
was alternately tortured and transported,
till she broke her own spells by marrying
an old nobleman, whose rank and riches
ensured her that power and those plea-
sures which she rated far above the en-
joyments of the heart. .
At the same period, Giovanni lost his
mother. This affliction (for he loved her
tenderly) following so immediately upon
a first disappointment, at once divorced
him from the usual interests and expect-
ations of life; and, obeying a sudden
impulse, he enrolled himself among the
Knights of St. John.

brated order, after having for more than
four centuries been the bulwark of
Christendom ; after having shed their
noblest blood in all the wars between the
infidels and the true believers; after
having given dignity to chivalry, by the
irreproachable lives of its knights; Was
now driven from Rhodes, the ancient
throne of its glory; despoiled of its con-
quests by the Ottoman arms, robbed of
its richest commanderies by the very
princes whom its valour had supported,
and all its possessions shrunk to the
sterile rock of Malta.
As the brothers of this celebrated order
preserved the fame of its former glory,
and the chivalric spirit by which that
glory was acquired, Giovanni repaired to
their island, with a soul burning to prove
itself worthy of their fellowship.
When he thus took upon him the obli-
gation to live a life of celibacy, and to
devote himself to the interests of reli-
gion, he had scarcely attained the age of

- one-and-twenty. He fulfilled this obli-
gation for five years; distinguishing him-
self in the convent by obedience and
purity of conduct, and upon service, by
zeal and intrepidity.
Mild and unaspiring in peace, in war
he was inspired with a new character;
for never did Caesar's ambition prompt
to bolder enterprise, nor Alexander's
thirst of fame lead to nobler exploits.

Meanwhile, the death of his heir made
a great revolution in the sentiments of
the elder Cigala and the destiny of his
younger son. It was not fit to let his
honours and wealth pass to a distant
branch, while a true scion from the pa-
rent tree yet flourished. He had a

daughter, it is true; but she was an alien
from his affection, by having clandes-
timely married a young Frenchman, with
whom she had fled, he neither knew nor
cared to enquire whither: he was little
inclined, therefore, to let the offspring of
such a marriage inherit his property.
In consequence of these circumstances,
he procured the Pope's dispensation for
his son Giovanni (a favour not unfre-
quently sought and obtained on similar
occasions); and thus released from his
vow of celibacy, and obedience to a mi-
litary superior, Giovanni reluctantly re-
turned into the business and bustle of
every-day life. -
Although he had long ceased to con-
sider the woman who had formerly infa-
tuated him, with any other emotion than
contempt, her tyranny rankled in his
memory; and he shrunk from such ig-
noble bondage to another, with something
of prejudice. - -

our lives, made him shun those gay
scenes where women hold the chief
place; and though he never expressed
his averseness to marriage, nor suffered
himself to believe he might eventually
disappoint his father's hope of seeing him
suitably allied, he had gone on nearly a
twelvemonth, since his return from Malta,
without evincing the slightest inclination
for any of his sprightly countrywomen.
Yet Giovanni was neither unsocial nor
melancholy. Perhaps he had more in-
ward happiness than any other man of
his age, consequently sought less from
without. He was one that loved to look
on the fair side of creation: for him,
every place had its pleasures, every sea-
son its enjoyment, every prospect its
beauty, every character its excellence,
and every vexation its utility.
Accustomed to seek a beneficent cause

light and consolation.
And for all subjects, there is that
cloudless region' — every trial and ca-

him, and saw not the expression of his
downcast eyes, resting on the fallen
leaves over which he trod, might fancy
him wrapt in melancholy contemplation.

reminded him of the brevity of human
existence, the light and life within him-

enshrines a light which the grave cannot
extinguish, and a living principle over
which death has no power. -

though solitary, not unsocial; and the

serenity of his countenance only reflected
a just image of his soul. . . . .
Report had wronged the elder Cigala,
or rather had mistaken his character,
when it charged him with malignant
motives in his contest for the estate at
Nervi. He was actuated solely by a
selfish desire of acquisition. -
The elder Adimari once held the most
lucrative post under the Doge, the po-
destat of Corsica; Cigala coveted it, in-
trigued for, and got it. He wanla have
done the same thing by his best friend.
. After a lapse of years, accident dis-
covered to him the family-deeds by
which he regained a right to the pro-
perty which had been unwittingly pur-
chased by the ancestor of Adimari; his
greediness could not resist the tempt-
ation; and deceiving himself, by ima-
gining he yielded solely to a laudable
regard for posterity, he commenced and
prosecuted the suit.

During its progress, Signor Adimari’s
fortune suffered by great mercantile mis-
fortunes; the suit was tedious and ex-
pensive; his son’s absence was prolonged
far beyond the time stated for his pro-
bable return; and, in those days, there
were no fixed modes of communication
between the two hemispheres; he had
heard of him but once during three
years; and the information he sent, con-
vinced his father that the business ho had
gone on veuld end in disappointment:
wearied out, therefore, with hope de-
ferred, with anxiety, with increasing debt,
with the straitening of his bountiful
spirit, and pining for his son, the un-
happy gentleman gradually drooped, and
at length died.
His death somewhat shocked the elder
Cigala; but the impression was not
strong enough to assist the pleadings of
Giovanni, who ceased not to importune
his father to drop the suit.
The suit, however, proceeded against

the executors of Signor Adimari, and
the result is known. -
With little sympathy, either in their
tastes or principles, the elder and younger
Cigala lived together in common-place
harmony: Giovanni had that ascendancy
over his father, which a strong mind gains
over a weak one; that ascendancy which
controls the actions of him upon whom
it is exerted, without altering his incli-
nations; that ascendancy which is often
submitted to in private, in deference to
public consideration.
So meekly did Giovanni bear his no-
blest qualities, that not one party could
hate or vilify him; and if the elder Ci-
gala were susceptible of laudable pride,
it was when he heard his son’s integrity
quoted, and his knightly exploits ex-
tolled. While listening to praises be-
stowed on his son, he seemed to fancy
that his own character was ennobled by
them. -
Thus, making a sort of property of

Giovanni's good report and high endow-
ments, he liked him not the less for a
superiority, which would have mortified
him in any other.
In one instance, hard was the contest
between habitual respect for this excel-
lent son and habitual selfishness. For a
long time Signor Cigala resisted both
persuasions and arguments, when Gio-
vanni would have induced him to make
the offer of considering the contested
estate as a purchase; and at last he
yielded solely from the fear of seeing
this admired son return into the bosom
of the order he had quitted.
As Giovanni now recalled the scene
which had then passed, he grieved to
think how unfairly he was estimated by
Cesario Adimari; and to be esteemed
by Cesario Adimari, to be absolved by
him, for being allied to the person whose
triumph had been his downfall, was the
liveliest desire of Giovanni's soul.
‘Yet whence originated this desire 2

was it from previous representations of
that young man’s filial piety; or from a
romantic imagination ? was it from pity,
and respect, and a sense of injury sus-
tained by Cesario; or was it from the
mere tenderness of a nature prone to
-trust and to love 2 -
Perhaps all thesecauses were combined:
perhaps they were rendered morepowerful
‘by that solitariness of the heart, which is
felt by persons endowed with warm affec-
tions, when surrounded by companions
lower than themselves in the scale of
moral and mental excellence; and lower,
by countless fathoms, than the elevated
'standard of their own imagination.
But there was another sentiment, and
a painful one, which harassed his hitherto
-tranquil breast. He saw that the extre-
mity of the law is not always what would
be the judgment of equity. There was
more in the estate at Nervi, to the son
of Adimari, than its pecuniary value.
Giovanni was sensible to a ceaseless whis-

per in his heart, that his father's triumph
was unjust. To seem to sanction such
an act, to appear to appropriate its fruits,
stung the high honour of the Knight of
St. John to the quick; and he felt that
he could not rest day nor night, until he
had incontrovertibly asserted his inno-
cence of the transaction, by a patient
endurance of its victim’s natural indig-
nation, and a persevering devotedness to
his service: till he had planted this con-
viction in the mind of the injured Adi-
mari, his own nobility of soul felt itself
stigmatised and under an impression of
disgrace.
Giovanni asked himself why he felt so.
interested in Cesario Adimari; and these
reasons satisfied him : but he could not
so satisfactorily answer his further ques-
tion, of what Cesario's character might
appear, if divested of the powerful inte-
rest bestowed on it by his peculiar situ-
ation.
Giovanni strove to recollect the par-


## p. 37 (#47) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 37
ticulars of Cesario’s countenance, to
assist his judgment; and he remembered
them distinctly.
It seemed to him almost an Asiatic
physiognomy: —so dark, yet so bright;
so full of ardent and impetuous passion;
so flashing, so varied, so sparkling : the
same dark-browed eye of diamond light;
the same clear forehead, polished like
marble, and rounded by black and glossy
curls.-Did the same character of devour-
ing fire lie beneath P Was it a proud
soul, that cast such an air of haughty
majesty over the movements of those
youthful limbs: was it a determined
thirst for vengeance, which gave that
stern yet noble fixture to a lip which
seemed made for the loves and graces to
hang on 2 *
And that lip, that cheek, that eye su-
preme in manly beauty, might not they
at once change their lofty character, and
become the evidences of a voluptuous-

ness too often associated with this keen
sensibility to the more stormy passions:
If experience were to answer these
questions in the affirmative, Giovanni felt
that his pure and kindly spirit could
never hold fellowship with one so differ-
ent: but if on the contrary, time should
prove Cesario as capable of friendship,
as of filial affection; if it should direct
his ardour to the sublime object of self.
devotion for the advancement of his
country or of his faith; if it should van-
quish his prejudices, by the growth of his
own virtues and wisdom; then Giovanni
felt, that he could grapple him to his
soul with hooks of steel; and in this yet-
unconquered hope he went on his quiet
way. * . . .
The occupation of the Marino (for
such was the name of the house at
Nervi) afforded much satisfaction to
Signor Cigala: it was a constant source
of bitterness to his son. Although its
internal ornaments of furniture, pictures,

marbles, &c. had been faithfully surren-
dered to the creditors of Adimari, there
remained painful remembrances of its
former inhabitant, in many a rural embel-
lishment planned by his taste, and many
an useful building erected by him for
the comfort of his tenantry.
Giovanni often entered the cottages
of the silk-spinners and the vine-dressers,
in the hope of cultivating their good-
will, and learning how best to serve them.
At first, they received him in sullen
silence; but after repeated visits, and
frequent attempts to draw them into
conversation, he won them at length
into confidence ; and, prefacing their
discourses with some cold compliments
to their present lord, they would then
lament the death of their “good signor”
in terms of sincere grief.
As they described the characters and
habits of the elder and younger Adimari,
their artless narratives presented many a
beautiful picture of domestic happiness.

It was an union so perfect, a happiness
so pure, a condition so moderate, and so
little likely to be interrupted either by
the temptations of an elevated fortune,
or the trials of a depressed one, that
Giovanni mourned to think his father’s
hand had levelled so fair a fabric with
the dust. - -
One of the oldest cottagers had a
chronicle of every bush and stone on
the estate. That summer-house, over-
grown with jessamines, was the place
where Signor Adimari used to take his
siesta in summer. Yon bosquet of roses
was planted when the young signor went
beyond seas. Under that palisade of
myrtles, by the great gates, the father
stood and embraced his son for the
last time. And on that terrace, he
used to walk every morning and evening
during the year appointed for his return,
watching the ships that came from the .
east, and still returning, though still dis-
appointed. -


## p. 41 (#51) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 41
To this terrace, Giovanni soon learned
to bend his pensive steps, whenever a
melancholy humour inclined him “to
nurse sad fancies:” it was a walk adapt.
ed for contemplation, independent of its
association in the mind of Giovanni with
the family of Adimari. --
The Marino stood upon unequal
ground, like all the villas in that pic-
turesque part of the Genoese coast; and
its gardens, extending over a great sur-
face of irregular hills, united their sunny
slopes by a succession of terraces and
flights of steps, which led to the very
margin of the sea.
These terraces and steps, built with
the green marble of the Bochetta, were
mantled by a variety of creeping plants,
as sweet to the sense, as delightful to
the eye: the ballustrades of the steps
were hung with them as with garlands.
It had been Signor Adimari’s pleasure
to surround himself with these simple
luxuries; and even where the pavement

of his terraces left no soil for a plant, he
supplied the deficiency by occasional
groupes of shrubs growing in porcelaine
or alabaster, and moveable at will.
From one of these varying groves of
gay geraniums, on the highest terrace,
rose a jet d'eau, the sound and sight of
the water of which, soothed pensiveness
rather than excited gaiety : near it
stood a magnificent cedar, its branches
shading the shattered roots of a former
companion. These roots, now over-
grown with moss and violets, formed
a fantastic yet easy seat, and had been
the favourite resting-place of Signor Adi-
mari. It soon became the evening haunt
of Giovanni. -
He would bring his book and read
there; or, in the still hour of vespers,
he would repeat the offices of that sacred
profession, never abjured by his heart,
though relinquished in obedience to his
father. Still oftener, he would pace the
cold marble, musing with fruitless pity
-


## p. 43 (#53) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 43
- on the many sad hours the elder Adimari
had wasted there, waiting for that son,
whose return he was destined never to
witness! -
Giovanni's kindly heart calculated but
too well all the pangs of that venerable
parent. “Here,” he would say, “here,
most likely, where the marble is worn
upon the eastern edge of the ballustrade,
he has been used to lean, while regard-
ing that quarter of the horizon; and
here, under the shade of these old myr-
tles, where the branches look brown and
blighted, perhaps the tears of the poor
father have dropped unheeded, as he sat
forlorn and lonely, vexed with the cares
of law and the disappointment of
worldly hopes; seeking, in vain, a breast
whereon to weep, and foreboding his
own dying hour of yet sadder loneli-
ness.”
In this neglected alcove Giovanni
found a volume of Virgil, which had
fallen down, and been forgotten, in times

long past. It opened of itself, at the
eleventh book, where the grief of Evan-
der, over the body of the young Pallas,
is painted with such tenderness and
beauty. The leaves of this part of the
volume were worn and discoloured, too
probably with the reader's frequent tears;
and Giovanni, as he contemplated their
traces, scarcely doubted that with the
affliction of the venerable Evander, Adi-
mari had almost identified his own.
He had feared, then, the untimely
death of his absent son: Oh, could he
have read the book of fate, and seen his
own end was so near ! — This precious
volume was often Giovanni's companion
in his evening wanderings; and the ten-
der strains of the poet, thus associated
with the sorrows of the respectable Adi-
mari, unconsciously heightened their dig-
nity and deepened their interest.
But not in reveries of vain compas-
sion, (though by such reveries are all
our virtues nourished, and preserved for

action,) did Giovanni pass his evening
hours. He sought to recompense his
father's new tenants for their change of
masters: he prompted, nay, he extorted
many a beneficial act from his father in
their favour; and his own gracious man-
mer being always interposed to shield
the grudging manner of that father
from dislike or disrespect, harmony was
established, and satisfaction beginning
to appear. - -
Still, however, his thoughts were full
of Cesario Adimari; and the little in-
formation he could obtain of that young
man’s situation and plans troubled his
peace. -
He learned that, by the sale of the per-
sonal property, and the pledging of his
land at Polchiverra, Cesario had dis-
charged the principal demands upon
him; and that, having obtained the pro-
mise of his creditors to wait the event of
a voyage he was about to make, he was
preparing to sail in a vessel bound for

the Levant; having taken on himself the
charge of superintending the disposal of
her cargo, and that of freighting her
back, in consideration of a valuable share
promised to him by her owners.
Giovanni had sought, more than once
since their second interview, to throw
himself in his way; but whether or no
Cesario as purposely avoided him, they
never had directly met. 3.
This perversity of accident, far from
abating Giovanni's desire to win some
kindness from Cesario, quickened it, by
causing him to meditate but the oftener
on such peculiar ill luck. He did so,
till this desire grew almost into a passion;
and he would cheerfully have incurred
the risk of another, and another repulse,
had he been assured that Cesario would
ever do his feelings justice, and separate
him from the hard character of his fa-
ther.
This, however, was not probable; for
Cesario was entering upon a course of
Io

life that would hereafter cause him to
pass the greater part of his time at sea;
and, when on land, would keep him down
in a society far, far below the level of
Giovanni Cigala's station.
Giovanni never revolved these things
without a concern amounting to sorrow :
here was a young man, born in the class
of nobility, educated in the expectation
of an ample fortune, accustomed to an-
ticipate the future dignities of the Re-
public, and from general fame fitted to
win them all in succession: liberal by
habit and by nature, keenly alive to
honour and dishonour; here was this
man, at the age of four-and-twenty, Sud-
denly sunk to poverty, and forced to
seek the means of preserving his father's
memory from popular reproach by em-
bracing the humblest post of mercantile
employment. - - -
Unfitted by his former education and
habits to sympathise with any but cul-
tured and elegant minds, he was conse-

quently cut off from the dearest affections
of man, friendship and love; or obliged
to receive an imperfect image of each, in
association without conformity of taste,
and marriage without the union of mind
with that of heart.
Could Giovanni have reversed this
hard fortune, by any sacrifice, whether
of right or generosity, he would have
done it joyfully; but it was impossible
for him to deny, that legal forms, and a
worldly view of right, furnished too many
arguments for an obligation on the head
of the chief of the Cigali, to regain the
property which had been alienated from
them in times past; and it was in vain
that he spoke of a superior law com-
prised in that simple and sublime maxim
of the meek Jesus, “Do as thou wouldest
be done unto.”
His father, yielding through a mixture
of dastardliness and respect in less im-
portant matters, where it imported no
one to support him, had been obstinate

in this: for nearly all of his name, having
a remote interest in the family-aggrandise-
ment, and being in the line of succession,
fortified his sordid arguments by their
opinions; and thus drowned the single
generous voice of the immediate heir.
Giovanni, therefore, could do no more
than lament that his will was unaccom-
panied by power; and lie in wait for some
happy opportunity of serving the injured
Cesario in despite of himself. -

CHAPTER III.
Signor Cigala had been settled above
two months at the Marino, when, that
object obtained, he became a candidate
for the Procuratorship, the second dig-
nity in the Republic,
During the progress of the election, he
frequently remained in the city; leaving
his son to the calm enjoyment of rural
pleasures, and those higher gratifications
connected with the study of ancientworth,
and the well-being of his dependants.
During one of these solitary periods,
Giovanni was returning from a long
ramble along the sea-shore, in haste to
avoid a storm; (for it was the end of July,
and the thickened clouds darkened his
way;) when having entered the demesne

of the Marino, he observed a figure dart-
ing from a cypress grove into a short
walk that led to the chapel.
The person was wrapped in a cloak
evidently for concealment; and the ra-
pidity, yet apprehensiveness of his move-
ments, made Giovanni pause and retreat
a few steps, to note whither he went.
Seeing this person still go on, he fol-
lowed him softly; sheltering himself at
intervals under the broad shade of the
trees, lest he should be observed in his
turn.
What was his surprise to see this man,
(after having vainly tried the door) mount
by one of the buttresses to a window,
which, yielding to his rough shake, left
him a free passage into the interior.
The chapel, dedicated to the martyr
Stephen, was richly furnished with images
and religious vessels, composed of gold
and precious stones: it coutained also the
relics of many eminent saints, and the
consecrated garments of the officiating

priest. All these treasures were sacred
to every good Catholic; but infinitely
more so, to one who had formerly vowed
to devote his life to the preservation of
the Christian faith, and whatever related
to it. -
Alarmed lest this suspicious person
were one of a gang purposed to pillage
the chapel of these holy things, Giovanni
hastened to a low door at the further end
of the building, of which he remembered
having the key; he opened it softly, and
closing it with equal caution, shut himself
in with the robber.
The stained glass of the long pointed
windows, and the shadows of the high
crocketted pinnacles which rose above
them, together with the drooping ban-
mers of the knights mouldering below,
increased the darkness of the place.
Giovanni felt for his dagger, and stood
steadily observant, behind the light
tracery of one of the shrines.
The person advanced eagerly.—“This

—this is the spot!”—he cried in a voice
that made Giovanni’s heart thrill; in a
voice which he could not mistake, but
which he had never before heard utter
such piercing and tender sounds. “O my
father — and is it here I find thee!”
It was Cesario Adimari that now cast
himself on the pavement of the chapel,
where a single square of black marble
denoted the place he sought.
He spoke no more; but relaxed from
every sterner feeling, his tears and groans
echoed through the hollow aisles; and the
frequent kisses he bestowed on the in-
sensible marble, testified the love he had
borne to him who slept beneath.
Giovanni was root-bound: he would
have given his life for the power of trans-
porting himself to another scene. It was
horror to him, thus to profane with sa-
crilegious eyes the sacred sorrow of a son
taking a last farewell of the ashes of a
father; to hear, perhaps, the confessions
of a soul burdened with the weight of

remembered omissions; and magnifying
its frailties into erimes. He tried to move,
but his limbs shook under him; he es-
sayed to speak, but utterance failed him;
— again the doleful accents of Cesario
were heard in the chapel.
“O my father thou hearest me, thou
beholdest me in this wretched hour !
strengthen me to bear my lonely and
altered fate—forgive me for all my past
offences against thee!—O ask for me,
courage to resist the weakness of my own
nature, and the seductions of a race I
ought to hate—for they murdered thee.”
“ Hold, Adimari!” interrupted Gio-
vanni, recovering his voice, though unable
to advance,—“you are not alone.”—
Cesario was silent for an instant with
surprise and resentment; then hastily
starting up, he exclaimed, “What, sir,
do you persecute me even here 2" —
Giovanni briefly explained the mistake
which had led him into the chapel. He
opened the door behind him as he spoke,

and let in the little light which yet
brightened in the evening sky.
That doubtful light fell full upon the
figure of Cesario, as he stood supporting
himself against a monument; it showed
him pale, dejected, his eyes swollen with
weeping, and all his features marked with
the languor of exhausted feelings.
That countenance was robbed of the
fire and ferocity of grief with which
Giovanni had formerly seen it agitated ;
but never had it been so affecting, never
so powerful over his sympathising heart.
He lingered ere he went: and perhaps
Cesario felt the influence of that profound
interest painted in the looks of Giovanni,
and which he was desirous of shunning,
for he only motioned him to be gone,
and turned back into the aisle,
“I would you could see what is passing
here !” exclaimed Giovanni, striking his
breast with fervour, after having com-
templated him for some time in silence,
“What matters it?” asked Cesario, his

either in life or death.”
“Am I answerable for my birth P”
enquired Giovanni, hazarding a step
Klearer.
“I am no casuist,” returned Cesario,
gloomily; and he fixed his eyes upon the
spot where his father lay.
A long silence followed. Giovanni
almost fancied he heard heavy drops fall-
ing upon the inanimate marble: the light
was so indistinct that he could only see
at that short distance the shadowy out-
line of Cesario's figure; but had he been
nearer, he might indeed have heard, nay,
he might have seen the big drops chasing
one another down the pale cheeks of the

mourner, and falling like rain upon the
tomb. But though he guessed from
Cesario's silence that he wept, he was far
from guessing that he himself had any
share in such emotion.
: In truth, Cesario's proud heart was
softened by the present scene; by his
previous abandonment to the tenderest
lamentations; by the thought that he
was about to quit his country once more;
and by the very forlornness of his own
fortune.
At such a moment, how precious would
a friend have been to him how inestim-
able the relief of throwing himself upon
any sympathising breast; and then suffer-
ing his grief to burst its flood-gates, and
pour out in lamentation and praises of the
object lost. - " -
But that relief could not be; it was a
Cigala that invited him to confidence and
affection; it was the son of the man whose
malice or avidity had caused the death of
his father: no, it could never be. Did

Giovanni speak with the tongue of an
angel, he should never turn him from
what he believed his duty – enmity to
all their race.
Suddenly steeled against the weakness
which unmanned him but a few moments
before, Cesario gathered his disturbed
garments round him with an air of severe
dignity, and said, – “I come not here,
Signor, to be the gaze of any man; my
business was with the dead. — But I
should have asked permission to have
entered this place, I know I should : —
by heavens, I could not ask it!—yet, I
do you justice; and as a proof, I will ask
of you the only favour Cesario Adimari
ever asked of any man.”
“Ask any thing — every thing ! — I
promise!” — exclaimed Giovanni, ar-
dently pressing towards him.
Cesario turned his brimming eyes down-
ward, – “Preserve this piece of marble
from insult, or removal.”

“So may I hope for mercy —so may
I hope at length to win your —”
“Friendship,” he would have added;
but, wresting from him the hand he had
rashly taken, Cesario rushed from the
chapel; and well knowing all the garden-
paths, soon reached the lowest terrace;
whence leaping into a boat that waited
for him, he was half way to the vessel he
was to sail in, ere Giovanni had recovered
from his confused amazement.

Five months after this, Cesario Adimari
returned to Genoa, one of a wretched
remnant saved from shipwreck on the
coast of Calabria. -
~ During his eventful absence, he had
often recalled the countenance and con-
duct of the younger Cigala; and, in spite
of himself, had done so with some regret
for the hard necessity (as he falsely
deemed it) which forbade him to indulge
any sentiment for him less potent than
a VC1'SeneSS.
Previous to the visit he paid the burial-

some of the oldest cottagers, and ques-

which, he took it for granted, were mak-
ing in this favourite habitation.
He had heard then, with a mixture of
disappointment and reluctant pleasure,
that some improvements might be found
on the estate, but no alterations had been
made in the house or gardens. Many
had been projected by their new ‘lord,
but every peasant could testify that
Signor Giovanni had always an argument
or a prayer in favour of the old order of
things; and so they remained.
Not a shrub was uprooted, nor a fancy
building pulled down, which Signor Adi-
mari had planted, or built, or frequented.

the upper terrace, stood there still: Sig-
nor Giovanni would not let it go by any
other name. And the white owl which
had built in that cedar so many years,
he protected even her, when he was told
that Signor Adimari used to feed her.
Nay, Giovanni carried this respect for
the dead into more important concerns.

He distributed alms on the same days as
had been appointed in the time of his
predecessor; he procured for the servi-
tors and labourers the same privileges
granted by Adimari, and he observed
the same festivals. In short, every thing
looked as it did formerly; and nothing
was missed by the neighbouring poor,
but the gracious countenance of their
ancient signor, and the charming spec-
tacle of his son’s filial fondness. Poor
Giovanni had not such a father, so to love
and honour.
With these details making their way in
his heart, Cesario had gone to the tombs
of his ancestors; and, with an additional
motive for esteeming Giovanni Cigala, he
had broken from the increasing influence
of his presence; had carried its impres-
sion with him through a fatiguing but
prosperous speculation; and was now re-
turned with those recollections blunted,
not effaced, by subsequent misfortune.
The fruit of his toil, the foundation on

which he hoped to build future respecta-
bility, together with the property his
employers had risked, was destroyed.
All had sunk in the richly-freighted ship
with which he was returning to Genoa;
and at this period he was poorer and
more desperate than when he set forth.
Cesario landed in the gloom of a thick
winter-fog, which had gathered after the
ship cast anchor. He took his way along
the Strada Nuova, towards the house of
a kinsman in the Piazza dell’ Acqua
Verde, where he had formerly found
hospitality.
In the 16th century, even the princi-
pal cities of Italy were only lighted by
tapers burning before the images of Saints
and virgins in different quarters, and by
the lamps in the porticoes of palaces and
public buildings.
Thus, while one part of a street was
glaringly illuminated, others remained in
total darkness; making them unpleasant
and unsafe, tempting assassination by the

immediate obscurity into which a mur-
derer might rush, after having found his
victim in the brightness of some enlight-
ened colonnade.
Cesario was habitually finding his way
through streets familiar to him from in-
fancy, scarcely sensible of their greater
darkness; when, in passing the church
of the Annonciata, he saw the door open,
and guessed by the just-kindled tapers
within, that vespers were not yet begun.
• The home of the destitute is the house
of God: and whatever ceremonies are
performed there, it is there the unhappy
of every condition and every sect find
comfort and refuge. Cesario turned into
the church. -
No one was there, besides the two or
three servants of the chapels, whom he
saw at a distance through the aisles, pre-
paring the vessels and censors.
The tapers before the different shrines,
not thoroughly lighted, threw quivering
and fitful gleams round the immediate
spots whereon they stood. The larger

branches of lights on the altar, and in
the dome, were not yet kindled; so that
but a kind of twilight filled the church :
that sort of slowly-clearing twilight which
precedes the rising of the moon.
Imperfect as objects were, Cesario ob-
served that a chapel to the left of the
nave was hung with mourning and boughs .
of cypress. -
He approached, and entered it.
A bier, raised a few feet from the
ground, and surrounded by gigantic
black tapers burning in silver candela-
bras, occupied the vacant space before
the altar. In that age, it was customary
at Genoa, as it still is at Florence, to ex-
pose the dead for several days before they
are buried. Cesario drew nigh to look at
the deceased.
It was a young man bound in grave-
clothes, his golden hair encircled with a
garland of narcissus: the bier he lay on
was covered with the same pale flowers;
and, at the head of it, half lost among

large branches of myrtle, hung the
armorial bearings of his family.
Cesario stooped to examine the face,
Mighty God! he saw the features of
Giovanni Cigala! He glanced to the
shield above that motionless head: it
was the twice-crowned eagle of the
Cigali.
He staggered — he fell against the
steps of the sanctuary. Stunned with
the shock, at that moment Cesario felt
that he had never been able to hate
Giovanni.
Drawn thither, either by the exclam-
ation that had escaped Cesario, or in the
execution of his duties, one of the ser-
vitors entered the chapel. Seeing a per-
son leaning against the rails of the altar,
he stopped and said something: Cesario
recovered himself.
“Whose body is that?” he asked in a
voice full of dismay.
“The body of Signor Matteo Cigala,”
replied the man.


## p. 67 (#77) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 67
“Jesu be praised I thought it had
been Giovanni.”
“The kinsmen were much alike,” re-
turned the servitor, settling some of the
furniture of the altar.
“Then the Signor Giovanni is well ?”
asked Cesario, approaching the bier again
with a steadier step, and contemplating
the face he had so painfully mistaken.
“He was at mass here, yesterday,”
replied the man. “Poor gentleman he
looks but thin and pale since the old
signor died.”
“What! and is he also dead?” en-
quired Cesario, powerfully struck.
The servitor repeated his information,
with the addition of the time and circum-
stances of the elder Cigala's death.
Cesario no longer heard what was said;
his mind had rushed back to the time of
his last return after long absence, when
the destroying angel had passed over his
house, and left it desolate. There was
something striking in the resemblance of

the two periods: 'tis true, it was only a
confused resemblance; a similarity which
disappeared on examination; but, at any
rate, it was a something that connected
both periods and both events; and it had
the effect of awing Cesario's dominant
passion into silence.
In another place, and told to him under
the impression of other feelings, the news
of Signor Cigala's death might have sent
a flash of gloomy joy through his breast;
it might have seemed to him a just sacri-
fice to his father’s manes: now, he pon-
dered on it without triumph; and as he
thought of Giovanni thin and pale as
the servitor described, he muttered with
a smothered sigh, “ Perhaps he loved
him ſ” -
The vesper bell had begun to ring
while this conversation proceeded: seve-
ral persons were already come in, and
taking their places.
Cesario hastily passed from the chapel
of the Cigali into the body of the church;

and, mixing there with the rest of the
congregation, partook of that spiritual
refreshment which all needed, but which
none sought with more earnestness than
he.

CHAPTER V.
In the business of the succeeding day,
Cesario dissipated the most painful of
those recollections which this incident
had revived. He had to see the mer-
chants with whom he was engaged; to
explain to them the circumstances of his
shipwreck, and to produce proofs of his
zeal and ability in the discharge of his
1ll-fated commission,
The case was clearly mere misfortune;
blame fell on no one : the merchants
were men of liberal feelings; and, hay-
ing made up their minds to their own
loss, they offered Cesario the chance of
another adventure.
But Cesario was not formed for a life
of plodding calculation: he had only his

THE KNIGHT OF ST, JOHN. 71
own necessities to supply ; and he re-
tained the prejudices of his birth, which,
even in a mercantile city, made it dis-
graceful for nobility to take a personal
share in commerce.
Could he obtain longer indulgence
from his father’s creditors, he determined
to enter the navy of the republic: there
fortune might be more favourable to
him than in the sphere of commercial
speculation ; at all events, his poverty
would then be that of a gentleman; and
from his slender pay he might annually
set one portion apart for the liquidation
of his pecuniary engagements. But
though Cesario found sympathy and
kindness from many, his difficulties were
not of a kind to be quickly removed;
the chief obstacle lay in his own cha-
racter. - -
Abhorrent of obligation, because
hitherto unused to it, he could not
brook the idea of extending the chain,
by paying his father's debts with money

lent to him by a friend. To accept
money as a donation, was a humiliation
that never crossed his thoughts; nor to
such a spirit would his warmest con-
nections have dared to offer it. It was
galling enough for him to solicit time
from the persons whose claims he ac-
knowledged; it was a sufficient victory
over his proud independence, to bend it
before the necessity of claiming the hos-
pitality of a distant kinsman, whose
habitation, nevertheless, had been be-
stowed on him by the elder Adimari.
Happily, this kinsman was not a per-
son by whom obligation is pressed with
coarse freedom : he was a man in the au-
tumn of life, married, but childless; not
burdened with riches, though possessing
enough for the decent elegancies of
life. He was syndic to the senate; and,
after the official business of the day, was
glad to find Cesario's interesting coun-
tenance, and varied discourse, added to
the sober society of his elderly wife.

From the moment Cesario came to re-
side with him, when driven from his pa-
ternal roof, the Syndic had considered
his house as his young kinsman's home:
he never thought of telling him so, be-
cause he considered the thing impos-
sible to be doubted : it was the natural
course of relationship; he acted upon
this worthy feeling; and Cesario, there-
fore, did feel at home; and believing his
gratitude gratuitous, bestowed it with
fuller measure.
The Syndic, when consulted, saw no
objection to his kinsman’s choice of the
naval service: he might rise in it to
honour and fortune; for his father’s
name was still remembered with terror
by the enemies of Genoa, and with re-
spect by its friends. -
The return of Cesario, Adimari, and
his increased distresses, were not long
unknown to Giovanni. He heard of his
intended application for admission into
the service; and still anxious to assist

him, he went privately to the person who
superintended the marine in the absence
of the Prince of Melfi, and obtained his
promise to place the noble adventurer in
the situation most favourable to the de-
velopment of his capacity.
Giovanni would fain have gone farther,
and supplied every thing necessary for
the ample equipment of the new sailor;
but he remembered the fiery spirit he
had to deal with, and, afraid of alarming
its jealous delicacy, forbore to indulge
his own amiable wishes.
For some indulgence, indeed, Gio-
vanni's heart groaned. He loathed the
cumbersome wealth of which he was now
the sole possessor, since part of it was
the spoil of another's inheritance. But
how could he relieve himself from it?
An hereditary estate regained was not his
to restore; there were numerous expect-
ants of the Cigala family to challenge
the succession ; besides which, there was
yet a probability (and Giovanni che-

rished the hope) of the inheritance being
hereafter claimed by his sister, or by her
children. -
Three years had elapsed since the dis-
appearance of Amadea Cigala with the
Chevalier de Fronsac; and as their father’s
anger would not allow any extensive en-
quiries to be made after her and her
husband, Giovanni hoped that the search
he was now instituting would be suc-
cessful.
Much as he censured the action by
which she had forfeited her paternal
roof, his gentle nature found much to
excusein theimprudent conductofa child,
who yields to the eloquence of a young
man by whom she is adored, to avoid
an union with one of an austere character
and forbidding aspect.
When Giovanni embraced the profes-
sion of knighthood, his sister had just
attained her tenth year, and four years
afterwards she eloped with the Che-
valier. Thus he knew her only as an

innocent and lovely little girl, whose
caresses used to touch, and playful spirits
amuse him : but he had none of those
extensive associations of mind and heart
with her, which form the dearest bond of
fraternal affection, and which render the
void left by its object lost, a void never to
be filled ! -
He therefore prosecuted his enquiries,
rather for her sake than for his own.
In the very thick of these cares, he
heard, by an extraordinary chance, that
one of Cesario Adimari’s creditors (the
only one, be it recorded for the honour.
of human nature, who had not shown
the most generous forbearance) was de-
termined to arrest his person for the pay-
ment of his father's funeral; believing
that by this act he should force Cesario
to obtain the sum from his friends.
* Without stopping to consider the effect
it might produce upon Cesario, Giovanni
hastened to discharge this debt. It was
no sooner done, than he recalled the

proud aversion which Cesario had always
shown him ; and he, therefore, made the
persons concerned, promise never to
reveal the name of him who had satisfied
them. In the midst of various tumultuous
plans for appeasing his rapacious creditor,
and of gloomy forbodings, that by this
means he should be deprived of liberty
and honour, Cesario was surprised by the
sudden withdrawal of that demand.
He went to the creditor; he heard
that the debt was paid, but the man de-
clined satisfying him further.
Instantly suspecting to whom he owed
this cruel obligation, Cesario questioned
the partners of the house again and again.
He looked steadily in their faces, while
he deliberately named several persons by
whom it was possible this favour might
have been thrust on him.
At the name of Signor Giovanni.
Cigala, he fancied their denials were
fainter, and their looks less assured. His

opinion was settled; his resolution taken;
and he left them. -
When he entered the Syndic’s house,
Cesario went straight to his own apart-
ment; where, opening a small box con-
taining the last letter and the hair of
his father, he took out the only relic he
preserved of that father, which had a
value independent of its reference to
him.
It was indeed a relic of great price:
a diamond which the immortal Doria had
wrested from the hand of a Turkish
prince, which he had worn constantly
on his finger till the invasion of Africa by
Charles V. -
At that disastrous period, in the me-
morable storm which scattered the Chris-
tian fleet, and wrecked its noblest vessels
on the Moorish coast, the ship that car-
ried the young hero, Gianettino Doria,
was stranded on a point of land, and in
imminent danger of being taken by the
enemy. - -

-
The galley of hisuncle the great Andrea,
(who commanded the fleet,) was labour-
ing against the same enraged elements;
and though too remote to succour his
nephew, was near enough to perceive
his peril, and partake his despair.
Knowing it impossible to save their
ship, and preferring death to slavery, the
crew of the stranded vessel cast them-
selves into the sea, hoping to reach
such of the Imperial fleet, as yet rode out
the storm.
Meanwhile the great Andrea stood
upon the deck of his distant galley,
watching the movements of his nephew
with torturing anxiety.
Gianettino was the only one who did
not perish at that awful moment: he was
seen clinging to an oar which he had
fortunately reached, struggling for life,
yet still gallantly retaining the flag.
Aboat from the admiral’s ship, (manned
with volunteers, determined to risk every
danger in the attempt to rescue the

nephew of their beloved chief,) though
launched with the utmost haste, was not
in time to meet him : exhausted by the
weight of the dripping banner, and the
fatigue of contending with the sea, he
let go his hold, and sank. -
Signor Adimari, then a young and vi-
gorous man, seeing the danger of his
friend, plunged overboard from the boat;
and buffetting the outrageous billows
with the strength of enthusiastic reso-
lution, reached the wave above which
Gianettino's bright face was raised for an
instant, —that would have been his last
look of this world, had not Adimari
grasped him by the hair. Holding his
gallant prey with one hand, with the
other he supported himself against the
roaring current, until rescued by the
boat; whence he was transferred with
the young hero and the banner of the
Republic to the vessel of the admiral.
It was on this occasion that the vener-
able patriot exclaimed, while clasping this

• THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 81
beloved nephew in his arms, – “Heaven
has permitted thee to be in such extre-
mity, only to show the world that Andrea
Doria can shed a tear.” -
The ring Cesario now held in his
hand, had been transferred at that
moment from the finger of Andrea to
that of Adimari. It was the pledge of
their future friendship; it was the me-
morial of his father's intrepidity, and of
Doria’s gratitude; it was the sacred wit-
ness of an affection between youth and
age in the persons of son and nephew,
than which neither ancient nor modern
history hath aught superior.
Yet this ring he must either part
with, merely for its intrinsic value, (which
was in truth prodigious,) and so let it
pass into the common tide of costly or-
naments; or he must sit down under the
load of an obligation to a Cigala; or he
must do violence to his proud nature,
and ask of the Dorias an equivalent for

the Jewel, he should offer to render back
to their family. *
Each of these alternatives had its mor-
tifications, yet of one he must make
choice. -
The two first he dismissed after a
short consideration; the last he revolved
several times.
According to every received notion,
the Doria family certainly stood indebted
to his father for a benefit which no pecu-
niary consideration could requite; any
present, however princely, could only be
considered a pledge of their eternal gra-
titude; yet, since the death of the great
Andrea, the Adimari had never sought
or needed their favour. -
It is true, the Podestat of Corsica had
been given to Signor Adimari by Andrea
Doria's voluntary influence; but it had
been transferred from him to Signor
Cigala after Andrea's death; and Adi-
mari, (hastily ascribing this mortification
to lukewarmness in his friend’s successor,

Gianettino,) silently displeased, withdrew’
from those habits of intimacy which had
been the consequence of former obliga-
tion.
By thus removing himself from the
society of the Doria family, Signor
Adimari occasionally faded from their
thoughts. Gianettino, Prince of Melfi,
now admiral of the republic, and father
of a numerous family, was too little on
shore to spare much time for the culti-
vation of particular friendships ; and as
Signor Adimari mixed no longer in the
public business of the city, he met him
too rarely for the renewal of a right
understanding.
For some time previous, and subse-
quent to the death of his preserver, the
admiral had been at sea; whence he re-
turned not till Cesario was set forth on
his unfortunate voyage to Syria.
Since then, the prince had made many
affectionate enquiries after the son of his
old friend; and those being reported to

Cesario by the Syndic, induced him to
resolve on making the sacrifice of this
treasured trophy to Gianettino.
With a swelling heart and an unsteady
hand, Cesario sat down to address him as
follows : —
** TO THE PRINCE OF MELFI.
“Your Highness must have heard or
my father's death, and of the hard decree
which occasioned it : I will not enlarge
upon the subject of my greatest grief;
it is enough that I am stripped of every
thing except honour and self-respect.
“My father left many debts behind him,
incurred by the suit at law, and by heavy
losses at sea: I have done all in my
power to cancel these debts; but my
means fail; and I am reduced to the
necessity of selling the only valuable I
possess, to get rid of a pecuniary obliga-
tion which is peculiarly intolerable to
me, having been forced on me by one of
the Cigali.


## p. 85 (#95) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 85
“Thevaluable Iallude to is the diamond
which was given to my father in the year
1541, on the night of the 16th. I would
not have it pass into common hands; I
would not sell it to save my life; but the
present necessity is urgent, and I offer it
to the nephew of the great Doria for just
so many ducats as will release me from
the bondage of debt; after that my way
is clear, –a life, or a death of glory.
“CESARIO ADIMARI.”
Whoever has trod but a third of life’s
briary path, and has not looked on the
cares and calamities which obstructed
his way as merely accidents, must often
have been led to remark, that during this
trying pilgrimage we are generally as-
sailed in our most vulnerable part: the
thorns pierce where our flesh is ten-
derest; the sorrow strikes where our sen-
sibility is most acute. Whatever be the
passion which predominates over every
other, and makes our hopes and fears

and efforts all tend towards its gratifica-
tion, it is from that quarter the severest
disappointments await us.
Thus Cesario's cherished sin was pride;
and successive humiliations were ordained
to level that inordinate pride with the
dust. Sometimes it was to be mortified
by indignities; sometimes it was to be
vanquished by kindness; but till the dis-
cipline of events should finally subdue it,
never was that intention of Providence
undiscernible by a reflecting mind.
Cesario remained in a state of tumultu-
ous agitation from the time of dispatching
his letter till the return of his messenger:
now he approved, and now he condemned
the step he had taken; alternately thought
himself too humble, or too lofty; and
finally groaned over the days of thought-
less boyhood, when he knew money only
as a medium of bounty and pleasure.
His father’s image came with bitterer
anguish to his memory, because that
sacred image was connected, not only

with his years of enjoyment, but with
those of independence.
The answering billet from Prince
Doria found him thus agitated, and still
alone; he read its contents so rapidly,
that he might be said to have taken them
in at a single glance: —
LETTER.
“You have laid me under as great an
obligation, signor, as that which I received
from your noble father twenty-three years
ago: I would not, for half my illustrious
-uncle's fame, have had the ring you
write of pass into any other families
than those of Doria and Adimari. As I
see what spirit you are of, (though I
could wish its edge less keen,) I will not
offend it by arguments which may here-
after find a fitter season; allow me at
present to pray only, that you will esti-
mate the jewel at whatever value you
please, and suffer me to consider it as a

mere deposit for you, or your heirs, to
claim at some future day.
“My treasurer, by whom I send this
letter, will take charge of the ring, and
give you an order upon the bank of
St. George for whatever sum you may
choose to receive. -
“ That affair settled, I shall claim the
privilege of your late father's grateful
friend, and hope in that character to be
allowed the gratification of forwarding
you in the military life it seems you are
on the point of embracing.
(Signed,) GIANETTINo DoRIA,
Prince of Melfi.”
Cesario read this letter several times,
as if he could not sufficiently take in all
its generous meaning ; but it soothed a
proud heart, rankling with former wounds,
and it threw over his dark fortunes the
first beam of light which had brightened
them for many months.

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JoHN. 89
Yet when he summoned the Prince’s
treasurer, after long delay, it was with
difficulty he preserved that command
over himself which is so necessary for
dignity.
A countenance all movement and ex-
pression; speaking eyes, which involun-
tarily sought the looks of those he con-
versed with ; and a cheek that alter-
mately took the hue of all his emotions,
were not features to be trusted when
propriety demanded an appearance of
tranquillity. He named hastily a sum
just adequate for his honourable pur-
poses; and consigning the ring to the
treasurer, with a short billet for the
Prince, took the order on the bank, and
dismissed his visitant.

CHAPTER VI.
It was then that Cesario's freed heart
sprang back with the violence of a bow
long bent; the passions of suffering
pride, of self-pity, of struggling inclina-
tion and of prejudice, of gratitude and
reviving hope, mingled their torrents
down his cheeks; and in that solitary
hour, all the pleasures, the pains, the
hardships and the enjoyments, the pos-
sessions and the privations of his former
life, were crowded by memory.
To the natives of colder regions, these
sudden abandonments to every passion
of the instant, may appear unmanly; but
nature varies human character as infi-
nitely as she does the modes of animal
and vegetable existence; and amongst

our southern neighbours, every feeling
assumes such a character of vivacity, that
it is no more susceptible of concealment
than the lineaments of the face are ca-
pable of alteration. These franker people
attach no shame to the display of a passion
which is not in itself, or by its direction,
criminal; they are ignorant of characters
like that of the English, whose heart’s
workings are kept from sight with as
much jealousy as a Turkish husband
guards his Haram; where the profoundest
sensibilities are habitually repressed, and
a surface of ice spread over a soil of fire.
In addition to this character of coun-
try, Cesario was further privileged by
the manner of the age he lived in ; it
was an age of stormy revolution, perils
and change knocked at the gates of all
the Italian states; and in a country
where every thing increased the spirit of
party, and each individual attached him-
self to a favourite leader or kinsman, the

vicissitudes, even of the humblest station,
were singularly striking.
Thus, strong passions were kept in
constant action ; aversions and attach-
ments were strengthened by injuries and
obligations of more than ordinary pro-
portions; and the human soul, disdaining .
mere pleasures for the game of life, de-
manded the agitation of powerful affec-
tions and the stake of happiness.
Thus, the times of which we speak
were as fruitful in heroic actions as in
great crimes: and if they chronicled the
horrid act of one brother tearing out the
eyes of another, they opposed to it the
beautiful instance of a son expiring of
grief at sight of his father’s tomb.
Cesario Adimari had all that vigour of
passion which makes character either
formidable or admirable, as that passion
is used; and he was now at that mo-
mentous period of life when the character
receives its final direction towards good
or evil: that even period between youth

and manhood, in which the soul takes a
steady survey of its own prospects and
powers, and strikes at once into the dark
road of selfishness, or the bright track of
heroism.
On the intimacies he should now cul-
tivate, and the habits he should now
form, much of his future fate must de-
pend. He felt this: and while he re-
joiced to re-enter the noble circle of the
Doria family, he almost grieved to think
that Giovanni Cigala, whose gentleness
attracted, and whose goodness would have
attached him, was the only living being
whom it would be impious for him to
cherish in friendship.
Firmly persuaded that the more diffi-
cult it was for him to shun and to abhor
this amiable enemy, the greater was the
sacrifice to filial duty, he lost no time in
ridding himself of unsought obligation.
For this purpose he sought Giovanni at
his house in the Strada Lomellino.
He was gone into the country.

“To Campo Marone or to Nervi P”
“To Nervi.” Even there Cesario had
the resolution to seek him.
Giovanni was walking up and down a
winter-walk, open to the sun and the
prospects of the south, when he was told
that young Signor Adimari waited him
in the house. “Did I hear you rightly?”
asked Giovanni, astonished. The servant
repeated his information: then, quickly
guessing the business of his haughty
countryman, Giovanni hastened to find
him.
Ten minutes’ solitude in a room where
the happiest part of his life had been
chiefly spent, assisted Cesario to smother
such of his peculiar feelings towards the
generosity of Giovanni, as he now doubly
deemed it his duty not to show ; for these
ten minutes of racking remembrance
made a heavy addition to the resentment
he bore the race of Cigala. -
His eye and his step had more than
their usual haughtiness when he ad-

vanced to meet Giovanni:—“You guess
my business, Signor Cigala,” said Ce-
sario; and he emphasized that name, as
if he meant to fortify his resolution by
its sound.
“Any business is welcome which gives
me the satisfaction of seeing you,” re-
plied Giovanni, purposely evading the
question.
Cesario fixed his eyes on him—fixed
them somewhat severely:-‘‘I must not
expect you, signor, to confess, unques-
tioned, a transaction which you have
taken such pains to conceal; but I do
expect from you a direct answer to this
question: — Is it to you I am indebted for
the payment of — ?” and he named
the debt.
Giovanni did not speak; only a deeper
red coloured his cheek. That gene-
rous glow, that dignified silence, smote
Cesario ; and rapidly changing, not
merely in voice, but in look, he added,
“I thank you for your amiable intentions,

signor: it is all I can ever bring myself
to thank a Cigala for. Your silence wants
no interpreter: again I thank you.” He
laid a heavy purse upon the table as he
spoke, and took up his hat.
“ Unkind '' exclaimed Giovanni, with
unusual vehemence.
“ Ungrateful perhaps you mean P”
said Cesario, darting on him an eye of .
fire. “But when favours are thus forced
on us, by hands we abhor, what have we
to do with gratitude 2 Be this the last
time that my feelings are thus outraged:
— Signor, it must be the last.”
“I have mistaken your character,”
said Giovanni, drawing back with an air
of chagrin and self-respect. “I fancied
it accessible to all kindly emotions: but
it must have been no it could not
have been pride that looked so noble to
me under the semblance of filial piety"
... The just indignation with which this
speech began, and the sudden return to
generous inference with which it ended,

made Cesario blush : “What is it you
would wring from me?” he asked, in a
relenting tone.
“Some show of that common good-
will with which man looks on man,” re-
plied Giovanni. “I could ill support
this frightful outlawry from any one of
my fellow-creatures, much less from
you.”
“And why less from me than from
another?” asked Cesario, turning away
his eyes.
“Do not these walls answer you?”
said Giovanni, in a low voice.
“Yes, they do answer me!” exclaimed
the kindling Cesario. “They speak to
me with a hundred tongues!—that spot,
whereon my father used to stand—those
trees, which I see from this window, and
which his hand planted—yonder dismal
pile, where his sacred ashes rest without a
monument, all speak, and bid me »
Cesario stopped suddenly, struck with a
recollection of the promise he had sought

from Giovanni at their meeting in the
chapel. Vanquished by that recollection,
he sunk upon a seat, burying his face in
his hands.
Giovanni guessed his thoughts, but
forbore to give his own, utterance.
After a long silence, Cesario rose.
“. Blame our fate, Cigala,” he said, with
penetrating pathos, “it is that which
has made us enemies. I should have
been your friend, your grateful friend,
had you been the son of another man;
but as it is, my father’s shade would rise
and curse me, were I to trust myself
longer within the powerful influence of
your character.”
Again Cesario escaped from the eager
grasp of Giovanni's hand, just as he had
again excited the hope of future amity;
and again Giovanni saw his kind exer-
tions baffled, his benevolence spurned;
and was left to contemplate all that he
possessed in the luxuriant seene around

him, only as the abundant fuel of a never-
ceasing remorse. *
Cesario's next duty was to visit th
Palazzo Doria, and acknowledge the
friendship of its princely master: but
agitated by the past scene, and unwilling
to present himself in such a tremor of
spirit, instead of proceeding through the
city, he turned aside towards that quar-
ter where the Albergo now stands; seek-
ing to tranquillise himself among the
solitary groves which then occupied the
present site of that building.
His retirement was, however, soon in-
vaded. Scarcely had he attained the
level of the hill, when he heard the
tinkling of falcons’ bells, mingled with
the agreeable tumult of animated con-
versation and the prancing of steeds:
the next moment he espied a party re-
turning from hawking,
Cavaliers and ladies, falconers and
pages, were mixed together in pleasing
confusion. The gay colours of their dif-

ferent habits, the feathers on the heads
of the ladies’ palfreys, and the fanciful
hoods of the birds, made an amusing
picture; and Cesario, in another mood,
might have paused to look at it. He
would now have struck into a side path,
had not his attention been momentarily
caught by an object, singular at that
period—a little open car drawn by four
Neapolitan horses.
Seen from a short distance, these ele-
gant animals appeared hardly larger than
greyhounds : they wore silver collars,
through which passed reins of azure silk;
and were guided by a young creature,
whose slight form happily harmonised
with the fantastic character of her car-
riage. -
She was standing, less from skill than
from exuberant spirits: as she passed,
the wind, ruffling her light garments, be-
trayed the ancle of an Atalanta, and
kindled the colours of Aurora upon her
cheek. Half-laughing, half-fearful, she

held the reins, contending against the
rough blast and the spirited action of her
horses.
In the act of passing Cesario, the wind
blew off her thin scarf; he caught it;
returned it to her, bowed, received a
gracious glance from a pair of bright
blue eyes, and went on.
. A second afterwards, he turned round
to observe whether so careless and skill-
less a driver proceeded safely. Her
horses were still checked, and she was
standing looking back after him : he
lifted his hat again, but he staid not;
his head and heart were full of other
things; and leaving the sprightly caval-
cade to their mirth, and the lady to her
meditations, he proceeded on his cir-
cuitous way to the Palazzo Doria.
None but emotions of the most plea-
surable sort awaited him there.
The prince received him cordially;
entered with interest into his concerns,
and frankly discussed the subject upon

which the elder Adimari had withdrawn
from his society.
From this discussion, it was manifest
to Cesario, that his father had greatly
overrated the prince’s influence. From
amiable unwillingness to dwell upon
what pained him in human character, and
having abstained from investigating the
affair, lest what was then only suspicion,
should be made certainty, Signor Adimari
had lost the opportunity of discovering
his own error.
It was evident, that Gianettino’s in-
terest had been exerted to the utmost;
and that he in his turn, hurt at “having
his good, evil thought of,” had receded
Hike his friend.
This explanation not only convinced
Cesario of the Doria's sincerity, but fur-
ther unveiled to him the indefatigable
intrigues of the elder Cigala: he was
therefore less disposed than ever to enter
into a league of amity with his son; and

less tenacious than heretofore, in accept-
ing the friendship of Doria.
Frankness was natural to Cesario:
there were now no resentments, nor pride
to bar its way: he became easy and com-
municative ; first giving Doria a sum-
mary of his past history; then explaining
to him his views and wishes for the
future.
With far more of the artless sailor in
him, than of the discerning statesman,
Prince Doria did not penetrate the re-
cesses of Cesario's character; he saw him
only such as he appeared at that moment;
avowedly jealous of obligation, and bent
upon laying the first stone of his own
fortunes.
Indeed Cesario deprecated any further
favour from this distinguished friend, than
that of placing him in his ship, and ad-
vancing him in proportion to his deserts.
Subsistence and honour were all he co-
veted; he therefore sought nothing be-
F 4

yond the admiral's protection from ne-
glect or envy.
When Cesario sincerely protested, that
common pleasures were indifferent to him;
and that he disdained the mere trappings
of wealth, however glittering, Doria
smiled at such philosophic austerity in a
man of twenty-four, while he praised his
spirit for spurning favours from the Cigali.
A closer observer would have discovered
in the vehement eloquence of Cesario,
while describinghis griefs, his resentments,
and his scorn of life's minor enjoyments,
that dangerous excess of sensibility which
sooner or later must find its object; and
which was even now vibrating between a
yearning towards Giovanni Cigala, and
that pride which bid him shun, and that
erroneous piety which bid him hate the
man whose father had beggared his.
Cesario would not have been displeased,
had Prince Doria combatted his resolu-
tion of avoiding Giovanni: but as the
prince did not do so, he concluded that


## p. 105 (#115) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. John. 105
the resolution was a right one; and that
if he should ever swerve from it, the
weakness would digrace him. In fact,
the Genoese hero, hurried away by Ce-
Sario's impetuous oratory, mistook pas-
sion’s torrent for the force of truth ;
simply because it swept his judgment
along with it. He saw clearly, that Ce-
sario would not accept the least assist-
ance from Giovanni Cigala; therefore, to
urge them into intimacy, would be doing
needless violence to the former’s filial
principles.
The prince knew very little of the per-
son in question: for since Giovanni's
return from Malta, Doria was divided
between public duties and the anxieties
of a large family; some of whom vexed
his heart, and embarrassed his finances.
The prince was consequently unable
to estimate the moral advantage which
his young friend might reap from such an
intimacy; as little did he suspect that
Cesario's inclination was at war with his
F 5

principles, (at least with those powerful
passions which he mistook for principles;)
and that, almost unconsciously, he waited
only the sanction of another, to break
the bonds of his ardent nature, and let it
spring forth to meet that of Giovanni
with noble rivalry of confidence.
Unable to fathom the depths of that
profound sensibility, of which he saw but
the agitated surface, Doria believed there
would be neither utility nor good man-
ners in attempting to argue Cesario out
of resolutions, which, however over-
strained, were honourable, and he con-
cluded agreeable to his feelings: he
therefore forebore to discuss the subject.
Having settled the mode and the pe-
riod, in which Cesario’s services would
be required, Doria invited him to join his
domestic circle; where, in a numerous
family consisting of young men and wo-
men, all unbroken in health, hopes, and
hilarity, Cesario's wintry humour warmed
into a social glow.

CHAPTER VII.
From this auspicious day, his fortune
appeared to return : the Palazzo Doria
was ever open to him; and though its
master had not much time to bestow on
the concerns of any one unconnected with
his own family, Cesario never found him
cold to his communication, nor luke-
warm in his exertions.
An expedition was fitting out in the
ports of Genoa, of which Doria was to
take the command; and having appointed
Cesario to his own ship, he exhorted him
to employ the intermediate time in study-
ing the principles of a profession, which
required science united with valour in its
votaries.

108 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
At that age when the spirit of adven-
ture begins to dawn in the youthful
mind, Cesario, in common with other
boys, delighted in reading voyages, and
listening to his father's narratives of na-
val exploits: since then, his own expe-
rience had given him some insight into
navigation. Nature had bestowed on
him the materials of military superi-
ority; and as all of naval tactics then
known, was principally the fruit of the
great Doria's genius, his nephew's in-
structions were nearly all-sufficient.
The prospect of activity, and peril, and
distinction, roused the soul of Cesario.
To the bitterness of grief, with which
he had mourned the loss of his father,
succeeded the animating belief that his
sacred shade witnessed his present ex-
-ertions, and would brighten in his fu-
...ture fame. He had shaken off the load
of debt; he was free from any galling
obligation, and though now but a child

of fortune, he had conquered for himself
respect from all with whom he mingled.
This change of circumstances, by re-
storing to him the conscious dignity of
independence, completely changed his
appearance. It was no longer necessary
for him to flash a threatening spirit in
the eyes of the world, and to show, by
a frowning brow, that immediate venge-
ance would follow insult. He was
still noble; he was again free (for debt
is slavery); and, with that conscious-
mess, he became kindly, indulgent, and
amiable.
Like all other expeditions, that of the
republic was delayed from week to week:
its object was co-operation with the
troops and fleet of Spain, which were
then slowly collecting for the purpose of
regaining the rock and fortress of el penon
de Velez.
This fortress, situated close to the
African coast, and once in the possession
of a Christian power, at that time ef.

fectually bridled the insolence of the
corsairs; but it was now in the hands of
the Moors, and every Christian state be-
came interested in its reduction,
An expedition against this place had
the best chance of success, if undertaken
when the prospect of intercepting the
galleons in their return from the new
world should have carried out the ene-
my’s cruizers. It was therefore agreed,
that, immediately on this event, the
Spanish commanders should issue forth
for Penon de Velez, while Prince Doria
with the Genoese galleys should follow,
and destroy the pirates, or at least
render their return to succour the fort-
ress doubtful, if not impossible.
Upon tidings of the India ships, and
the appearance of the pirates, depended
the departure of the fleet: Cesario was
consequently forced to wait in Genoa,
till his burning desire of quitting it was
nearly destroyed by new hopes and new
inclinations. 4.

Marco Doria, one of his noble friend's
younger sons, had lately returned from
travelling in foreign countries; and be-
ing of an amusing, kindly character, had
first pleased, and then almost attached
Cesario.
There was a sort of good-humoured
caprice about Marco, which served to
give his society that piquancy, without
which common pleasures had no relish
for Cesario; and, as that caprice was
never directed upon him, this liking was
the more flattering.
In fact, Marco's caprices were rather
those of humour than of heart; and
were oftener affected than real. At first
they had been purely natural ; but now,
from indulgence, and from seeing their
effect in procuring him the privileges of
a character, he rather fostered than
sought to weed them out.
By turns Cesario smiled at, and re-
proved, and smiled again on the fantastic
moods which made Marco, in the course

of a single day, alternately a cynic, a
sybarite, a devotee, and a hero. His
brave father, often heart-wrung by the
shameful irregularities of an elder son,
and the profuse expenditure of another,
had no anger to waste upon venial fol-
lies; so that if Marco appeared in the
morning with the look and the dress of
a philosopher, and at night with the
tinsel and talk of a coxcomb, he simply
shook his head, muttered “Foolish boy!”
and bade Cesario teach him to act and
look like a man.
Dividing his time between professional
studies and occasional recreation, Cesario
passed from the grave abode of the syn-
dic to the sprightlier Palazzo Doria;
seldom frequenting other houses, there-
fore rarely thrown in the way of Giovanni
Cigala.
The retired habits and peaceful pur-
suits of the latter tended to remove
them from each other; but at times they
met at mass, or at public festivities, or in
Io

the streets; and whenever they did so,
Giovanni carried the idea of Cesario
back with him to his solitary home; and
Cesario was rendered thoughtful for the
remainder of the day.
. . Giovanni sought him no longer; but
the expression of countenance with which
he returned the passing salute of Cesario,
convinced the latter that he must attri-
bute this change to delicacy, not to in-
difference; and that, as he had found
friendship and the means of honourable
subsistence from other than the generous
son of his father's enemy, he need ap-
prehend no further intrusion from the
man who had sought him on purely be-
nevolent principles.
There were moments when Cesario
felt tempted to stop Giovanni as they
met, and proffer that acquaintanee which
could no longer receive an interpretation
wounding to jealous pride. But still
one feeling interposed, one feeling was
unappeased—the remembrance of his

father, “done to death” by the elder
Cigala.
At this recollection the kindly glow
left his heart, and he would pass quickly
by, with an averted head. Giovanni
failed not to remark these repelling looks,
and was at length unwillingly convinced,
that he and Cesario Adimari were indeed
not fated to knit the knot of amity. True
to his habitual confidence in the wisdom
- of Heaven, he reconciled himself under
the disappointment, and turned his sym-
pathy into another channel.
The task is not hard, when our ima-
gination has been the source of the
baffled affection: Giovanni lived to feel
the difference between such an affection,
when but a courted inclination, and when
worked into the soul by time and trial—
when become part of its being, and
cruelly torn thence by ungrateful vio-
lence. º
Hitherto he had seen only the inter-
esting and agitating parts of Cesario's

character: chance gave him an opportu-
mity of observing how enchantingly that
character was varied, and how capable it
was of diffusing all the charms of mind
over social intercourse.
He went by mere accident one even-
ing to a conversazioná. A numerous
party was assembled when he entered;
it was broken into detached sets; and in
one of those he discovered Cesario. In
the instant of making this discovery,
Giovanni withdrew himself as much as
possible from observation.
He then remarked, that the persons
by whom Cesario was encircled were ex-
actly those most distinguished by that
eloquent talent de societé which illumi-
nates the dullest subject, and bestows
nearly absolute power upon the possessor.
These persons were evidently absorbed
by the superior eloquence of Cesario.
As Giovanni continued steadily to
watch his movements, he conceived not
how the same man could look so different,

yet leave no doubt of his identity. The
darkness of despair, and the fierceness
of irritated pride, were vanished from
that singularly-beautiful face; all there
was openness, and hilarity, and bright-
ness. Wherever Cesario's eyes rested,
they rested with an expression at once
sweet, inviting, and kindly: he smiled
frequently; and he smiled like one
who neither distrusts nor dreads any of
the persons around him; like one who
sees that he is admired, and listened to
with pleasure, and whom that convic-
tion only renders more inclined to like
and admire in return. -
The animation of his gestures, joined
to the interesting variety of his counte-
nance, but, above all, the deep atten-
tion of those about him, left Giovanni
without a doubt that he was detailing
some remarkable adventure, or enforcing
some favourite opinion. What magic
must there be in his eloquence, thus to
rivet so many eyes and thoughts, upon

him alone; thus to charm even Envy it-
self into admiration . How did Gio-
vanni wish that he, too, might have be-
come a listener!—but, fearful of disturb-
ing that happy flow of soul, and reluct-
ant to overshadow that brilliant sunshine,
he kept aloof for some time, and at last
quitted the assembly. -
If Giovanni afterwards recalled the
scene of this evening, and thought on it
with regret, that he must never hope to
enjoy the intimacy, and share in the feel-
ings of one so liberally endowed by na-
ture, he consoled himself by believing
that Cesario had, at least, regained his
original capacity of happiness, and was
entering a career which might lead to
fortune.
Though Giovanni's character was
deeply tinctured with romance, it was
not that blameable romance which de-
taehes the mind from its legitimate ob-
jects of interest, and weds it to some
hopeless or useless attachment: he saw

Cesario no longer destitute and desolate;
he turned, therefore, from contemplating
his situation to active duties and dearer
interests. In a very short time he be-
came entirely engrossed by the wish of
discovering his sister.
From the relatives of the Chevalier
de Fronsac, to whom he wrote with a
fraternal anxiety which opened their
hearts in return, he learned, that, shortly
after her marriage, she accompanied her
husband to Naples, whither he was car-
ried by an unsettled humour; that they
had continued there some time, then
passed into Sicily, whence, after another
sojourn of a few months, they had em-
barked for Marseilles, with the purpose
of returning to settle in France.
But ere they had gone a third of their
voyage, the Chevalier, with his usual
fickleness, landed at one of the Papal
ports, intending to cross Italy into France.
From that period (now more than two
years), no tidings had been heard either
8

of him, his wife, or their domestics. So,
whether they had re-embarked in some
other vessel, and perished by shipwreck;
whether they had been robbed and mur-
dered by banditti, or were living, for
some unaccountable reason, in voluntary
privacy, the family of De Fronsac knew
not.
The chateau of the Chevalier was now
occupied by a cousin, the legal heir ; and
his mother was retired into a religious
house.
From this account it seemed too pro-
bable that Madame de Fronsac and her
husband had perished at sea: for it was
unlikely that not one of their domestics
should have escaped, if their fate had
been to fall amongst robbers; still less
likely, if they were dwelling in any other
part of Europe, that not one should quit
them, and return to his native country.
Giovanni sometimes feared it was a
forlorn hope to seek further; yet he
could not rest satisfied, until he went te

Ostia, the port where the Sicilian ship
had landed them, and where it seemed
just possible that his personal enquiries
might elicit some new light, and lead to
the discovery of his sister's fate.
He had projects for his future life,
which he would not realise till this im-
portant point should be cleared; at least
till the death of his imprudent sister, and
the extinction of her race, should amount
to certainty.
Leaving his property under the care of
a relation, he therefore quitted Genoa,
hopeless of success, though resolute to
attempt it.

CHAPTER VIII.
WHILE Giovanni was pursuing his jour-
ney among the Maritime Alps, calmly
surveying the more important path of life
which lay before him, and revolving
whether he were to tread it singly, or en-
circled by domestic ties, Cesario Adimari
was rapidly losing the gloomy retrospec-
tion of past sorrows in the hopes and
fears of new attachments.
“I am going to the Palazzo Rosso,”
said Marco Doria, one morning entering
Cesario's apartment at the Syndic’s ; “do

one to divide with me the toil of listen-
ing to a little coquette in the bud; for her
arts are not full-blown yet; and I know
you love me well enough, to be that self.

Cesario smiled at the affected languor
with which his friend spoke. He re-
minded him, how often they had heard
the Signora Brignoletti spoken of in terms
of rapture; and requested to know what
his objections could be against one so
generally admired.
Marco was in a wrºngling mood: he
quarrelled with the lădy’s beauties and
accomplishments; he proved, that every
one of her graces and merits was neutra-
lised by some opposite quality of mind
or person,
True, she was gifted with the talent
of chaunting extempore verses; and when

She talked well upon every subject;
for if she knew nothing of them, she
nevertheless uttered the most ingenious
fancies, or the most amusing absurdities,

without hesitation; yet, after all, was not
a woman’s virtue, ignorance? her best
grace, silence?
Then her person—it was indeed a
glow of youth and health; but it was too
glowing: she reminded a poetical ob-
server of a peach rather than a rose;
and that was high treason against the
delicate character of female beauty.
She was said to have the very prettiest
feet and ankles imaginable: but if beauty
is but the harmonious adaptation of parts
to the particular end for which they are
destined, if it be simply utility, then
Beatrice's pretty feet must be ugly, be-
cause they were too small to support her.
Cesario interrupted this solemn non-
sense with a sudden burst of laughter:
not a whit discouraged, Marco went on
with the gravity of a Seneca, to rail at his
cousin's singularly bright eyes and white
teeth. He maintained that both were
detestable.
“ They injure my sight!” he said,

“I hate all glaring objects; so I always
avoid white teeth, snow, diamonds, and
bright eyes. But come—since I must
face these horrors to-day, by the saints
you shall confront them with me.”
Cesario yielded to his impelling arm,
as he concluded this tirade, and they
went forth together. -
And what, in sober truth, was the
woman thus described by the whimsical
mood of her cousin?
With youth, laughing from the blue
heaven of her eyes; a complexion, indeed,
like the sunny side of a peach; and clus-
tering hair, of ardent brown; Beatrice
Brignoletti was charming in defiance of
rule. Her springing steps was marked
by a volatile grace, something between
walking and dancing; in another person
it might have been mistaken for affect-
ation, but in her, it was the natural ex-
pression of that jocund spirit which looked
forth from her eyes, her lips, her cheek,

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 125
- her flying tresses, nay, “at every act and
motion of her body.”
The same jocund spirit made her rash
and fearless, and discourseful even in
large societies; and more judicious men
than Marco Doria might have agreed
with him in asking for something more of
timidity in an inexperienced girl. But
at seventeen, with all her genius, Beatrice
was as much of a child in her love of
amusement, her eagerness in the pursuit
of whatever tempted her whim or her
heart, and her utter disregard of what
other people thought of her conduct, as
when she used to cry for a doll, or
trample over a parterre in chase of a
butterfly. . .
As amusing, as caressing, as endearing
as a child, she was usually judged with
the same indulgence; and as neither the
saddest humour could resist the flash of
her smile, nor the coldest heart her
glance of brief sensibility, there were not

many persons courageous enough to teſt
her, nor wise enough to tell themselves,
that her exuberant gaiety hovered on the
verge of freedom.
An heiress, and an only child, Beatrice
was left solely to the guardianship of a
mother, who had “ thrown herself into
devotion,” as the French call it; and
who, without power or perhaps inclina-
tion to shut out the heathenish world
from the Palazzo Rosso, presided at her
assemblies with a visage that would not
have disgraced Medusa. - -
Although the Dorias called the pretty
heiress cousin, their relationship was very
distant; and had far less share in binding
the families together, than their mutual
desire of a nearer connection.
. The Marchesa Brignoletti wished her
daughter to marry the heir of the Doria
honours; and the young man himself left
no assiduity untried which might win the
heart of his mistress; but the heart is
sometimes very provoking, and though

that of Beatrice was certainly given to
“the melting mood,” it melted not before
the many sighs of this admirer.
Report whispered, that Cynthio Doria
was refused, because another Genoese, of
nearly equal rank, was handsomer, and
not so much in love, as to make love
aukwardly: be that as it may, Cynthio
was silenced for ever; his rumoured rival
thrown aside; and the lady's favour en-
grossed by a young Sardinian, who had
followed her from Turin, and seemed
likely to carry off the prize.
All this, and much more of private
annals did Marco Doria impart to his
companion, as they took their way along
the Strada Nuova, to the Palazza Rosso.
It was one of those golden mornings
known only to Italy; a refreshing breeze,
blowing off the sea, tempered the hot
sun; the air, the exercise, the quickening
influence of animated conversation, had
given to the fine person of Cesario its
full lustre, and, as his friend presented

him, he received one of Signora Beatrice's
brightest eye-beams. There needed not
her musical shriek of recognition to in-
form him that he saw in her the pretty
charioteer whose scarf he had picked up
several weeks ago. She seemed en-
chanted with the opportunity of thank-
ing him for his gallantry; and said so
much more upon the subject than such a
trifling civility required, that Cesario
could not help recalling one of Marco's
exclamations about her—“How she will
talk!” He smiled, bowed, complimented
her in return; then, directing his atten-
tion, as he believed right, to the Mar-
chesa, left Beatrice to his friend. 3.
With that volublevivacity which Marco
Doria had exaggerated, Beatrice began
to rally him on the doleful seriousness of
his deportment; to contrast him with the
sprightly Frenchmen and ardent Savoy-
ards at the court of Turin; to beg the
history of his travels, and to give him
that of her own. Thence she flew off

to a repetition of their amicable disputes
and artless sports in childhood, which she
coloured so magically by a pretty mix-
ture of sentiment and gaiety, that Cesa-
rio's attention was irresistibly attracted,
while he wondered at the obstinately-in-
different mood of his companion.
“O you must come and worship my
doves,” exclaimed Beatrice, suddenly
starting up, “if you wish to see just
such feathers as Cupid is plumed with, or
perhaps his arrows winged with ; come
with me to my aviary.” "
“I had rather make acquaintance
with a sensible-looking owl,” replied
Marco, forcing a yawn.
“That ungracious speech, and that
mirror beside you, are so tempting for a
bad jest!” returned Beatrice; “but as
I am no owl-fancier, prithee remainwhere
you are. Signor Adimari, you will come
with me?”
There was no resisting the pretty
plaintive tone of childish disappointment

with which this was said; Cesario rose,
and approached the door she was opening.
. “Where are you going, Beatrice 2”
asked her mother, in a tone of displea-
Sure. - * ,
“Into the air with the birds, mamma,”
replied the gay creature, vanishing as
she spoke. -
Cesario followed her out into an ačrial
garden, formed by an extensive platform,
supported on a range of marble arcades;
it was diversified by parterres of the
choicest flowers and bowers of shrubs.
There the pomegranate, wedded to the
heliotrope and yellow rose, hung its
blushing garlands through the openings
of gilded trellices, and strewed the path
with, varied blossoms: at the extremity
of the platform, shaded from the sun by
rose-acacias, and sprinkled by the waters
of a fountain from below, (the sparkling
showers of which rose as high as this
fantastic garden,) stood the aviary.
Beatrice ran to call out her doves, and

as she placed them alternately in the
hands of Cesario, descanting on their
beauty, her own charms of complexion
and animation could not pass unnoticed.
. From the beauty of the birds, their
conversation turned upon beauty in the
human species: Beatrice avowed her ad-
miration of it with indiscreet ardour; and
having warmly praised a head of the
war-angel, by Michael Angelo, at Turin,
as her idea of perfect manly beauty, she
met Cesario's eyes while hers were ad-
miringly rivetted on his figure; and for-
getting what it implied, she uttered, in
the confusion of that detection, some-
thing about his strong resemblance to
this picture.
The words were no sooner escaped,
than she blushed like vermilion; Cesario
coloured too; neither of them spoke,
till Beatrice, fairly overcome with shame,
flew back into the room º her mother
sat, leaving Cesario to º ver from his

embarrassment, and to follow her at his
leisure.
The remainder of this visit was spent
in more general conversation; and al-
though the lively Beatrice ceased not to
sport with the transient humour of Marco
Doria, she never addressed nor answered
Cesario without a visible blush; perhaps
there was, insensibly, less of confusion
and more of delight in this heightened
colour; for Beatrice began to forget that
she had any thing to be ashamed of, and
thought only of admiring that sweet im-
periousness of expression, which, though
softened, was not subdued, in the fine
countenance of Cesario, and that flexible
grace which was developed by every
movement of his exquisite figure.
The ensuing day carried Cesario into
the same society. Signora Brignoletti
had invited her cousin and his friend to
take chocolate with her in the morning,
a celebrated singer being engaged to give

her a lesson, in her way to the court of
Piedmont. - r
They were true to their appointment,
for Marco Doria was in the mood of gal-
lantry, and Cesario loved music to abso-
lute passion. -
Her mother was at mass; the Count
Cagliari, Beatrice’s Sardinian adorer,
stood by her side, leaned over her chair,
handed her the music-books, lifted her
nosegay when it dropt, and retained part
of it as he did so ; in short, assumed the
air of a man as sure of his station in a
lady's heart, as vain of the privileges that
position gave him. -
Cesario did not much observe then,
though he often recalled it afterwards,
that at his first meaning glance from her
to the Count, Beatrice suddenly altered
her manner; she listened with a cold
air to the familiar whisperings of Cag-
liari; and, removing from that part of
the room in which he was, contrived so
to immerse herself in the rest of the

party, that he could never again fix him-
self at her side. -
While her little circle were trifling
away the time, till the Seraphina should
arrive, Beatrice flew up to Marco Doria
with the smiling witchery of a Eu-
phrosyne, – “So you are out of your
tub to-day,” she said, glancing archly
over his suit of azure silk, delicately
wrought with silver; “ no longer Di-
ogenes, what art thou, my entertaining
cousin 2” -
“ Your slave, fair Beatrice l—for I
have not seen any thing so charming
since ” “Since your last look at your
mirror,” was her arch interruption, and
she turned her brilliant face towards
Cesario: “And you, Signor Adimari,
what humour are you in 2 or are you in
any humour at all? have the charity to
let me know before-hand, that I may not
nip our acquaintance in the bud, by
being either too grave or too gay, or too
wise or too foolish, or too awful or too

familiar for your taste of the moment; I
do assure you my humour is to please you
both :” – and as she curtesied with in-
imitable grace, a pretty dropping of her
eye-lids gave but the more effect to the
brilliant orbs from which they were as
suddenly raised.
“It is not for you, Signora, to bend
to any one's humour,” said Cesario,
gaily. “You triumph over all.”
“Santa Maria! here comes that perse-
cuting man!” -
“What! Count Cagliari!” repeated
Doria. “I thought he was lord of the
ascendant here !”
“He I hate him | I never did more
than tolerate him; and I have hated him
ever since yesterday.” -
“ Bravo! you and I are formed for
each other I see, after all !” cried Marco.
Hated since yesterday! — why, even my
weathercock fancies could not have shift-
ed in less time; nor, I dare say, with less
reason.”


## p. 136 (#146) ############################################

136 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
Beatrice was too earnestly eluding
Count Cagliari, and too eagerly attend-
ing to Cesario, for a reply to this remark.
After having successfully evaded her ad-
mirer, she said to the latter, “Can you .
imagine any thing so odious, as to be
persecuted by a man one has taken a
disgust to '''
“Yes! to be avoided by the person
we love,” was Cesario's playfully-reprov-
ing answer.
“Then you pity that presumptuous
creature? You would be his advocate
with me?” she said, with a mixture of
softness and pique.
“I suspect there is no man who would
consent to plead any other cause than his
own to the Signora Brignoletti,” replied
Cesario.
His answer was a mere common-place
of gallantry demanded by the question;
and he uttered it sportively; but no
sooner was it said, than all the colours of
morning painted the face of his fair

companion; and indiscreetly exclaiming,
“Oh! I must not jest with you; I see
you are dangerous,” she fled away as
fast as she had done the day before.
“What a pretty, strange little crea-
ture l’” said Cesario to himself, somewhat
disturbed by her second flight; and he
repeated this remark more than once, as
he accidentally caught her eye fixed on
him, through the occasional openings of
the different groupes in the apartments.
That eye receded from his for a mo-
ment, when he made his way towards
her some time afterwards, and joined
Marco Doria who stood by her; but it
was not long of recovering its usual lively
excursiveness; and it sparkled with such
extraordinary brightness, that Cesario
could not forbear asking his friend, in a
low voice, “Whether his near neighbour-
hood to so much light were good for his
eyes?”
Beatrice claimed a share in their secret:
it was immediately granted; and Marco

Doria's voluble gallantry left nothing to
Cesario but an expression of countenance,
to which Signora Brignoletti's quick fancy
gave its own meaning.
“’Twas in compliment to those bright
eyes that I chose this watchet-coloured
mantle,” said Marco. “ Their colour, an
earthly dyer may imitate; but for their
fire, I must take Prometheus's journey.
Prithee reward me, sweet Beatrice, with
a smile for this.” -
“If you had asked for a sigh, I might
have wondered at your effrontery,” she
answered, giving the sweet reward he
asked ; “but a smile is such a poor
every day favour — a mere Algerine
asper—the smallest coin in the heart’s
treasury; and thrown, like alms, to vaga-
bonds, simply to get rid of them! There!
you may have a score at once; I can
afford millions.”
“And is a sigh, then, the richest gift
of this fair treasury of yours?” asked
Cesario, feeling, for the first time, an

emotion of tenderness in her company;
“I have seen a blush that was worth the
Indies;” and his eyes said where, and
when. -
“By the Virgin, she gives you both !”
exclaimed Marco, as Beatrice did indeed
sigh and blush from very pleasure; “but
given thus, for nothing, they must be
counterfeits; don’t take them, Adimari;
at any rate, don’t attempt imposing them
on me as lawful coin.”
At that instant Count Cagliari ad-
vanced to take leave, piqued by the Sig-
nora's marked avoidance of him. To
appear still sure of her favour, and yet to
scorn it, he carelessly snatched her hand,
kissed it with the air of one tired of play-
ing the lover, and walked out of the
room with a vacant stare of listlessness.
“You have not told us, my fair coz,
by what name to call this favour!” ob-
served Marco; “ a kiss of that white
hand is doubtless a medal struck only for
some happy individual.” -

140 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
“The die is destroyed then there
never will be another!” replied Beatrice,
glowing with indignation ; she paused,
then added with imprudent frankness,
“I see what the Count aimed at. He
intended to make you and Signor Adi-
mari believe that he is a favoured lover,
therefore privileged to take this liberty;
but it is no such thing: and I beg you
both to come every evening to the Pa-
lazzo, just to see how I will mortify his
presumption.”
Both gentlemen bowed, and one of
them laughed; it was certainly not Ce-
sario, - - -
The Seraphina never came ; so the
party broke up, and the different per-
sonages betook themselves to their sepa-
rate homes.
As Marco Doria sauntered along with
Cesario, he amused himself with ridi-
culing the caprices and artifices of women.
He offered to bet any sum, that the
Signora Brignoletti was at this moment

weeping over the success of her own stra-
tagem: for he considered her conduct to
Cagliari as mere wanton-sport with his
feelings; or else, but a passing fit of
irritation.
Marco was so much used to timidity in
some women, and finesse in others, where
their hearts were concerned, that he never
dreamt of finding the real meaning of
Beatrice's conduct, in its literal interpre-
tation: he therefore fancied her evident
admiration of his friend a piece of
childish acting; and set it down for cer-
tain, that she only tried to play him off
against some neglect or offence from her
real lover.
From respect for female sincerity, Ce-
sario was not disposed to admit this; and
from regard for female modesty, he was
as little inclined to believe that the lady
really felt that admiration of his person
which Marco protested she displayed.
He consequently combatted Marco's ar-

senses; called her looks and expressions
mere accidents; and, neither convincing
nor convinced, parted from his com-
panion.

CHAPTER IX.
WHATEveR was the nature of the Signor
Brignoletti's reveries, when Cesario was
their object, it is certain that he thought
of her only as a charming child; and as
such, saw no danger in accompanying
Marco Doria to the house of her
mother.
It is true, Beatrice had talents which
often elevated her above her own cha-
racter. When she sang, she did it with
the expression of vivid, unrestrained
feeling: and when obeying an impulse
(which her flatterers called inspiration),
she chanted or recited an extempory
poem, she was certainly inspired with
something beyond the common-places of
Fine-Ladyism. Still, this was only a

wild shoot of genius; neither nourished
nor improved by study, nor pruned by
judgment: it was but a meteor light,
brighter at its first burst than it would
ever appear afterwards: flowers without
root, worn but as youth's garland, and
destined to wither with its brief day of
enthusiasm.
Cesario saw nothing in this boasted
wonder, beyond the promising talent of
a clever girl.
As the Palazzo Rosso was open every
evening, and after the first introduction
no future invitation being necessary, the
two young men went there every night.
At the commencement of these visits,
they usually stopped but a few minutes;
then they staid a little longer; after that
Cesario grew to oppose their departure
so very early; and, at last, he fell into
the habit of remaining there alone.
From scarcely noticing the little atten-
tion given by Beatrice to Count Cagliari's
assiduities, and the eagerness with which
I4

THE KNIGHT OF ST. John. 145
she received attention from himself, Ce-
sario insensibly began to feel, and to
watch for, these proofs of peculiar in-
terest. He gradually lost sight of every
other thing in the conversations of the
Marchesa, till his mind, habituating itself
to one line of observation, and one ex-
pectation, became rivetted upon the
object of its attention with the strength
of passion.
It is humiliating to detect the weak-
messes of human nature : but, perhaps,
were every passion conceived for a very
faulty or dissimilar object, traced to its
source, we should find it in an awakened
vanity. Cesario's might be attributed
to that subtle cause.
One evening, as Marco Doria called
on him as usual, in his way to the Pa-
lazzo Rosso, he affected a fit of what
he called ‘the God,” and insisted upon
reciting some verses which he had just
composed upon his friend himself.
Marco enacted his new character of

º
bard so well, that it was indeed as im-
possible to stop him in his tuneful ca-
reer, as it would have been to stop the
most practised of his supposed brethren:
with “his eye in a fine phrenzy rolling,”
he volubly delivered the following
SONNET.
Who now, with voice profaning Nature's hand,
Shall of Ideal Beauty idly boast?—
Thy form, Cesario, dims the faultless band
Of sculptured gods, enthroned on Grecia's coast.
Faultless are they : but with exhaustless grace
(Beyond or chisel's touch or fancy's glow,)
Thy limbs divine each charm of motion show,
Matching the bright perfection of thy face —
That lip, that eye, where Love and Mind contend
For mastery of power; that smile of light;
Those curls of jet, and brows sublime, that bend
Like thunders resting on some snow-clad height;
O, who on these shall gaze, nor rapt exclaim,
Here sculpture's idol falls before a mortal's frame!
Cesario laughed heartily at what he
considered bombastic nonsense, when
applied to one man by another; but he
bestowed a very different appellation on


## p. 147 (#157) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 147
it, when Marco proclaimed it a produc-
tion of Beatrice Brignoletti's, and stolen
by him from her writing-case.
The original manuscript shown by
Marco, in support of what he advanced,
was in vain presented to Cesario: the
latter refused to share in such unmanly
treason against the defenceless sex; and,
though convinced by the delicate hand-
writing, and Marco's utter incapacity to
string a rhyme, that it was really the
work of Beatrice, he persisted in avowing
his disbelief of its authenticity; and so
the affair ended. -
After this incident, Cesario was not
long of estimating his power over the
young heart he wished to reign in. Her
sparkling eyes, and glowing cheeks,
whenever he drew near, needed no inter-
preter: those eyes were never long absent
from him : and one glance from his,
would at any time make her repulse the
Count Cagliari with marked rudeness; if
she danced, if she sang, it was only at
H 2

his request; if she gathered a flower, it
was for him; if she took refreshments,
it was because he offered it. If Cesario
hawked or hunted, she lent her best
falcon, or pressed on him her favourite
gennet. - - -
That pernicious habit of indulgence
in which Beatrice had been educated,
being more powerful than modesty itself,
she consciously betrayed this secret in-
clination, from a lurking expectation of
gratification waiting upon such display.
Hers was not the love which is disco-
vered by its own attempts at conceal-
ment; hers was not the love which would
rather have perished with its victim in
the grave, than have compassed a return
at the expense of maidenly dignity; hers
was not the love, which, born of moral
and mental admiration, can live through
years of hopeless attachment, nourished
by contemplating the virtues of its ob-
ject, and consoled by witnessing his
happiness. -


## p. 149 (#159) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 149
It was the love of an age just beyond
that wherein a sweetmeat and a flower
are the highest enjoyment; an age in
which the senses and the imagination
are sometimes mistaken for the heart and
the judgment; an age, in short, of tur-
bulent but rarely deep attachments.
If Cesario ever dwelt for an instant
with an unpleasant sensation upon her
careless conduct, it lasted but an instant.
There were so many delightful and flat-
tering reasons to be urged in her excuse:
complete innocence, ignorant of the very
sentiment it indulged and betrayed;
truth, so transparent that even virgin
bashfulness could not veil it; love so
powerful, or love so generous, that either
it could not be restrained by any consi-
derations, or would not, from a noble
disdain of unequal fortune.
To these sophistries were added the
seductions of self-love; the wants of a
heart formed for strong emotion; and

the tumults created by the beauty of
luxuriant and playful youth. -
Marco Doria, meanwhile, rallied both
parties on their evident mutual prefer-
ence, and with such dexterous address,
that it was impossible for either to show
their knowledge of his meaning; yet, as
impossible for them to learn by it the
nature and extent of a sentiment which
both felt, and neither ventured to express.
Just as Marco was in the mood, he
treated love as a light or a profound
sentiment; deified it with the spirit of a
hero in romance, or sneered at it with
the asperity of a cynic. But in none of
his moods was he wise enough, or kind
enough, to remind Cesario of the despe-
rate inequality which existed between
his fortunes and those of the inexpe-
rienced creature for whom he sighed. .
Count Cagliari was formally dismissed
and gone back to Turin; and an armour
of frowns was beginning to invest the

brow of the Marchesa, when the Genoese
fleet received orders to sail. -
A swarm of Turkish cruisers, after
sweeping the Adriatic and the shores
of the Mediterranean, were seen hover-
ing round the adjacent islands: it was
therefore expedient to disable or drive
them back; that so powerful a reinforce-
ment might not come in aid of the Bar-
bary fleet, when the expedition against
Penon de Velez should take place.
This expedition was indeed on the
point of issuing from Spain, but the Ge-
noese admiral abandoned his share in its
success, only that he might render it
sure, by destroying the ally of Morocco.
Marco Doria, who had been all this
time making up his mind about his fu-
ture pursuit in life; and who had alter-
nately determined upon the land and the
sea service, the line of politics, the
church, and the court of the Emperor
Charles, was now thoroughly convinced
for the next fortnight, that there was

nothing in this world worth a wise man’s
trouble ; that honours were bubbles;
riches toys, pleasures dreams; that, in
short, there was nothing substantial but
ease and indifference; and that, conse-
quently, a country abode, with a garden,
a few books, and a single domestic,
were the ultima Thule of human happiness.
Marco's valour had been approved,
more than once, as a volunteer upon
sufficiently memorable occasions; there-
fore, without fear of being stigmatised
with cowardice, he suddenly announced
his intention of sitting down for life, as
a philosophic solitary.
Before Cesario left Genoa, he saw this
fantastic personage tranquilly installed
in a small house, that once belonged to
a falconer, on the banks of the Pol-
civerra. -
Thus, bereft of his usual companion,
Cesario had to go through the dangerous
scene of announcing his own departure
to the Signora Brignoletti.

It was in the gardens of the Palazzo,
where the Marchesa had given a moon-
light supper in an open pavilion.
Part of the company were enjoying
the beautiful night among groves of
breathing rose and orange trees; some
stood listening to the tinkling sound of
fountains, or to strains of music issuing
from the house. The Marchesa sat with
her daughter on the alabaster steps of
the pavilion, seemingly attentive to the
progress of a wreath of flowers which
Beatrice was sportively twisting for her
own hair, but in reality watching the
steps of Cesario, and keeping him off by
her threatening frown.
Cesario was alternately sauntering and
leaning under the shade of an acacia,
with two or three persons, of whose con:
versation his sense took no cognisance.
His head was continually turned towards
the pavilion, where the peculiar cha-
racter of Beatrice’s charms appeared

e
heightened by their contrast with sur-
rounding objects.
The pale moon-light, and the cold
whiteness of the portico, were opposed
to the glow of her complexion, and the
speaking fire of her eyes: the tranquillity
of the flowers and trees, (for no breeze
disturbed them,) was contrasted by her
rapid and animating movements. She
seemed to Cesario the sole principle of
life and motion in this lovely scene; and
as much intoxicated by the contemplation
of her beauty, as agitated by the thought
of quitting her, he walked with a hurried
and unequal pace, which the forbidding
looks of the Marchesa kept still far from
the pavilion.
Happily for Cesario's wishes, the un-
expected ascent of some fire-works at a
distance made every one start from their
position, and run towards the Pine-mount
whence it proceeded. In the rush and
confusion, Beatrice escaped from her
mother, and was soon near enough to

Cesario for him to join her. “Ah, what
a tiresome evening this has been " she
said, in reply to the eloquent glance of
his eyes.
“One of torture to me!” replied Ce-
sario, with ill-repressed emotion, “for I
wished to tell you that we sail to-morrow;
and I had a boon to ask.” -
“Then it really sails after all!” cried
Beatrice, tears suffusing her bright eyes;
“O why did you not do as Marco Doria
has done!”
“What! renounce the hope of dis-
tinction, and shut myself up in a moun-
tain-hovel?” -
“A person might be much happier
there than in such an odiously-fine place
as this,” was the reply of Beatrice.
“And could the Signora Brignoletti
find happiness in such a lot 2" asked
Cesario, his heart quivering on his lips.
The Signora did not answer; but she
refused not the hand he wildly clasped in
both his. For the short instant during

which he retained this willing hand,
Cesario saw no other image than such a
- mountain-hut with Beatrice and felicity.
He was on the point of telling her so,
(all lost to reason as he was,) when the
steps of persons approaching made him
check the tide of passion. First pausing,
then gently drawing a ring from one of
her passive fingers, he whispered in ac-
cents of smothered fire —“O let me cast
myself at your feet in this spot to-morrow
morning, before the first matin bell, - I
sail at the second.”
Beatrice faltered out the permission he
sought: Cesario ardently kissed the hand,
which he instantly released; and tore
himself away.
Cesario saw nothing, felt nothing, re-
membered nothing but this ring, and the
manner in which it had been rendered to
him. He could not recall, how Beatrice
had looked when he made the bold theft;
for at that instant a mist covered his
sight, and he lost every other thought in

the agony of transport with which he felt
her soft finger yielding its treasure.
What needed he more, to tell him that
he reigned absolute in her heart, and .
that she was ready to flee with him from
wealth and grandeur to the mountain
life he had described 2 What needed he
more, to animate him on his way to peril
and glory?
But when is that heart satisfied, where
love rules like a tyrant? Cesario thirsted
to hear the voice of Beatrice confirm the
assurance of her eyes; he longed to cast
himself at her feet, and exhale there his
ardent soul in vows and thanks. Perhaps
he dared to imagine her pressed to his
sighing breast, and bedeved with farewell
tears, too sacred for passion to profane
Burdened with its own fulness, his
heart did indeed languish for participa-
tion with hers; and, wishing the night
annihilated, he reached the house of the
Syndic, unconscious of his own move-
ments. .

There was no sleep for Cesario during
the hours that intervened between this
period and that in which he hurried out
to keep his appointment in the Rosso
gardens.
He had previously taken leave of the
good Syndic: his equipage was on board;
and he therefore had no more to do in
Genoa than to see his enchantress.
As he approached the gate of St.
Thomas, he was overtaken by the Prince
of Melfi, attended by some of his officers:
“Well met, Adimari,” cried the Prince,
taking his arm and impelling him forward,
“ you have just been summoned. The
pirates are out, — the wind serves. –
Now, for your first throw, for death or
glory!”
Never before did those two words
sound appallingly to Cesario: he turned
pale; and he hesitated in his walk. A
look of astonishment from the Prince
brought the crimson back to his cheek;
and, shocked at the interpretation towhich

his present agitation was liable, he stam-
mered out, —“ I could have wished not to
have been summoned, till I had taken
leave of a friend, who must now be wait-
ing for me: — and if?”
“You cannot have a moment!” inter-
rupted Doria, hurrying him on. “Your
friend, or your mistress, must console
themselves with the news of your future
exploits.” -
Cesario saw there was no remedy;
and rousing his spirit from its trance of
love,
“Like dew-drops shaken from the lion's mane,”
the image of Beatrice, of parting tears,
benedictions, and embraces, fled at once
from his mind: he thought of contests
and conquests, of wounds and crowns,
of his father's fame, and his country’s
gratitude.

CHAPTER X.
The saffron of early morning had just
changed into the rosy hue that precedes
sunrise, when Cesario reached the place
of embarkation. The harbour was all in
motion. The heavy ships were standing
out to sea with all their sails set: the gal-
liots and brigantines were rowing with
quick and regular strokes to the sound
of martial instruments: different-coloured
flags were seen flying from the masts’
heads, or sweeping the blue waves with
their majestic folds.
Boats passing to and fro; persons
running to the east and western moles,
to catch a last glimpse of their departing
friends; handkerchiefs waving; voices
calling; oars splashing; signal-guns an-

swering each othef from the vessels and
the citadel; the sea and the land all
in motion; and above all, the Turkish
cruisers specking the horizon; formed so
many picturesque and animating objects,
that Cesario caught the contagion of en-
thusiasm, and, for the next six hours,
thought only of battle and victory. -
“The Tyrrhene seas did glitter all with flame;
Up sprung the cry of men, and trumpet's blast.”
When those six hours had terminated,
the Genoese fleet were masters of the
watery field: they had given chase to
the pirates, overtaken, encountered, and
conquered them. -
Part of the enemy’s galliots now fol-
lowed in the triumphant train of the
Capitanata; the small remainder were
either sunk, or seeking shelter in the
obscure ports of the adjacent islands.
The action had been fiercely contested.
Animated by the deadliest feelings of
revenge and animosity, each party had

exerted the most determined and obsti-
mate resolution. Death or victory seemed
to have been the motto under which they
fought; and deeds of valour were per-
formed, which in themselves would have
immortalised the arm that wrought them,
but that all were heroes, all fighting as
if the fate of the battle rested on each
individual exertion.
Cesario, now foremost in the ranks of
death, felt this soul-inspiring thought;
and, emulative of his great leader’s fame,
sought by some mightier effort to become
conspicuous in the dreadful conflict. In
vain he set his life at nought to win this
pre-eminence; each fearless deed was
seconded; the glorious example of their
chief had fired all ranks, and he saw that
no common daring could lift him above
his dauntless companions.
Fortune at this moment, as if in re-
ward for his exertions, now smiled on
them, and pointed to the long-wished
and ardently-desired opportunity.

~
Their infidel adversary, (carrying the
commander-in-chief's flag,) defeated, and
nearly destroyed, after a most determined
but unavailing resistance, was now at-
tempting to clear herself from her oppo-
ment, and escape: Cesario, whose eagle
eye had watched every turn of the fight,
perceived her intention; and maddening
with the anticipated joy of reaching that
pinnacle of glory he had so nobly striven
for, called on a few of his gallant follow-
ers to support him, and threw himself
into the enemy's vessel.
Amazement seized the Turks at this
desperate act of valour; they were
thrown into confusion; assistance poured
in from Doria’s vessel; and Cesario soon
found himself in possession of the Turk-
ish admiral’s sword and ship.
* This gallant action had been witnessed
and duly appreciated; all ranks joined
in bestowing the highest honours on the
youthful warrior, and hailing him the
hero of the fight.

On the deck of the captured vessel,
and in the presence of enemies and com-
patriots, Prince Gianettino embraced his
young lieutenant,”—“You have proved
yourself worthy of your father,” he said,
and his eyes glistened. Cesario squeezed
the hero's hand in eloquent silence; then,
more respectfully putting it to his lips,
returned such an answer as the occasion
demanded.
After so convincing “a proof of his
mettle,” he had nearly as many enviers
as admirers; but, awakened to a passion
for renown, and a séñse of duty, by suc-
cess and eulogium, Cesario had no
thoughts to bestow on jealous infe-
riority; he began to cherish hopes of
a destiny as brilliant as the lover of
Signora Brignoletti ought to aspire to ;
and to dream, for golden instants, of the
only equivalent he would ever accept in
the place of a patrimony cruelly with-
drawn — lands bestowed hereafter by
his country.

If these reveries were troubled at times,
it was by the recollection of the appoint-
ment he had made, and broken, with
Beatrice. -
What must she have thought of him
while awaiting him in vain P while walk-
ing through those dewy gardens, under
the grey dawn, hearing the momentary
gun that marked each departing ship; .
and then beholding the white sails of the
collected fleet hovering like a flight of
sea-fowl on the horizon 2 -
Could she have admitted a suspicion,
that any thing but imperious honour had
prevailed against his love 2—no—it was
impossible she could think otherwise:
and again and again Cesario fastened his
lips to that little circle of gold, where it
seemed as if all his future hopes were
contained. -
Transports like these were the luxu-
ries of his solitary moments; all his social
hours were given to action and to enter-
prise.

Prince Doria had given him the com-
mand of a galley; and as the roving
warfare of the pirates was best coped
with by the same adventurous methods,
Cesario's eagerness to distinguish him-
self rendered him more forward in the
dangerous but necessary boldness of
pursuit.
The San Lorenzo (the ship Cesario
commanded) was giving chase to a
single galliot near the rocks of Corsica,
when the evening of a sultry day began
to darken, and some heavy clouds of
gloomy purple foretold a storm. The
galliot, familiar with the coast, and form-
ed to run in shallow water, ran safely in
shore under the shelter of the rocks;
while the heavier galley of Cesario,
obliged to keep out to sea, remained
exposed to the violence of the rising
tempest. -
Night thickened; the winds began to
rage from every quarter of the heavens
by turns; the hoarse roar of the

breakers was heard, mixed with the
shriller cries of sea-birds; the galley
laboured, and groaned among the splash-
ing waves; — still Cesario was loath to
relinquish his expected prey; the master
at length bluntly told him, that unless he
gave up the pursuit, every soul must in-
evitably perish.
It was now indeed impossible to pursue
the pirate, who ran his lighter vessel
ashore in a friendly creek, where the
darkness and the situation favoured his
concealment; the San Lorenzo therefore
made for the island of Pianosa.
Well built, and ably manned, the
Genoese galley rode out the storm during
the night, and, by day-break, as she
neared the island-rock, guns were heard
on the subsiding wind.
By the quivering light of their succes-
sive flashes, Cesario and his companions
found they proceeded from a vessel in
distress; he returned her signals, and
every exertion was made to reach her.

The unhappy merchantman (for such
she was) had struck upon a low rock,
close to the desert Pianosa, and her
loosened planks were beginning to sepa-
rate.
Boats, crowded with women, children,
and mariners in the wildest despair, were
seen on the mountainous waves, strug-
gling to attain the friendly galley: those
whom the boats could not receive, had
cast themselves into the sea, catching at
spars, oars, any thing, in short, slight
enough to grasp, and strong enough to
bear them up.
Impatient of delay, Cesario had al-
ready thrown himself with a few sailors
into his own boat, and was making to-
wards the wreck, for he had discovered
on the remnant of the vessel some women
running in distraction to and fro, and a
single man, who, by his gestures, ap-
peared encouraging them to hope and
exertion. -

That fearful swell carried her at once

it: a shock, a shriek—O what a shriek
— told Cesario that he came too late;

her timbers over the face of the waters.

ments with instinctive sense; but alas !

their stunned companion lay senseless on
the surface.
Cesario was on the point of leaping
into the sea, and swimming through the
raging elements to this devoted victim;
but aware that in doing so he must
perish without attaining the object de-
sired, he exerted all his own skill and
his men's courage, to impel their boat
forward to their assistance.
As they proceeded they were menaced
with instant destruction on every side;
large masses of the wreck, impetuously
hurried by the current against their
slight boat, threatened to overturn it;
rocks above and rocks below water sur-
rounded them; but still manfully com-
bating every obstacle, they passed safely
through, and reached the given point.
The unfortunate man yet lay without
motion on the water; the next instant
he must have sunk: but what will not

boat steady, while he fearlessly plunged
out of it into the boiling surf.
It was but a moment of alarm and
strong emotion: the next instant he re-
gained the boat, with the object of his
solicitude in his arms. -
The sailors had previously rescued the
women; the other boats had gained the
galley : not a soul had perished. Ce-
sario hastily passed his hand over his
eyes, to hide feelings which honoured
his manhood: the joyful conviction of
being the preserver of so many persons,
rendered his late martial triumph cold
and worthless in comparison; but this
was not a time for indulging in reflec-
tions of any kind, for the unfortunate
man whom he had saved still demanded
his care.
He now took him once more in his
arms, to observe whether life yet re-
mained: as he did so, the pale head
hung feebly backward, but the mild blue
eyes unclosed. -

Was it a dream, or did Cesario in
reality support upon his breast the man
he had avoided with so much passion?
Was it memory or fancy, working in his
mind, that told him he had just saved
the life of Giovanni Cigala? and so re-
paid with overflowing measure all the
proofs of kindness which had been thrust
upon him by the only noble offspring of
that detested race!
The tremulous day was yet uncertain;
but he could not again mistake that face
when united with the soul which stamped
its individuality. -
“. Keep off! — he revives!” was his
hurried exclamation. Willing to have
that instant of strong emotion without
witnesses, he motioned to the sailors and
women to precede him into the galley,
which had now rowed up to them.
During the transfer of these persons, he
had time to collect his amazed thoughts.
Giovanni's hand was in his : hitherto it
had been motionless; but now a trem-

bling pressure conveyed his generous
gratitude. “Adimari!” he said, in low
accents, “ Heaven ordains us to be
friends.” -
“O that some revelation from heaven
would indeed tell me so!” exclaimed Ce-
sario, transported out of himself by this
extraordinary adventure, and involun-
tarily straining Giovanni to his breast.
“I owe my life to you,” said Gio-
vanni, “ and I devote it to you hence-
forth. Yes, whether you will or no.”
• Overcome with a rapid retrospect of
past times, at these words Cesario bowed
his head upon the shoulder of Giovanni;
with a deep sigh, he said, “In this hour
of agitation I am not myself; I know
not what I say;” and, folding Giovanni
with his supporting arm, he called one of
the seamen to assist in raising him into
the galley.
Saved from death by the exertions of
Cesario, and thrown upon his humanity
for the remaining period of their cruise,

Giovanni had powerful auxiliaries in these
circumstances: nay, even the weak parts
in the character of Cesario assisted him
in the conquest he sought over his pre-
judices.
His proud spirit was appeased by the
obligation he had already laid upon the
son of Paulo Cigala: he now thought
only of showing to him that an Adimari
scorned all revenge save that of added
services; that while these services were
needed by one of the Cigali, he would
render them profusely; but that neces-
sity over, the obliger and the obliged
must return into their former constrained
position.
Cesario had yet to learn his own heart:
he had yet to learn, also, the influence of
an enthusiastic interest, steady yet not
obtrusive; forbearing, yet dignified; ex-
traordinary, but not extravagant. He
had yet to learn, that even love itself
sufficed not for all the wants of a soul
like his, created to desire and to feel

every animated sentiment; to aspire after,
and, haply, to reach every heroic virtue.
The injury Giovanni had sustained by
the fall of the mast, was aggravated by
a fever, which confined him entirely to
the rough couch of Cesario's cabin. Here,
when not required amongst his people,
Cesario came to assist in administering
to his ailments; or to relieve the tedium
of solitary inaction, by reading or con-
versation.
At these times, Giovanni forbore to
speak either of his gratitude or his now-
rivetted resolution to win his friendship:
but the expression of his mildly-pene-
trating eye spoke volumes; and Cesario,
from avoiding its fixture, grew to endure
its mute appeal; and, finally, to seek and
to love the look which laid bare that pure
and disinterested heart.
Giovanni, in his turn, became daily
more interested in the character and for-
tunes of Cesario; the almost romantic
attraction he had felt towards him while

Z
he was an object rather of his imagin-
ation than his knowledge, seemed now
to be at once justifiable by reason, and
demanded by gratitude. •
In their desultory conversations, where
feeling was seldom analyzed, but uni-
formly displayed, Cesario showed all the
varieties of his character. The nobleness
of his sentiments, contrasted with the
mediocrity of his destiny, was only the
more affecting: and that war between
ingenuous sympathy and exaggerated
duty, which never failed appearing when-
ever his father's memory crossed these
hours of intercourse, excited at once
respect and regret in the bosom of Gio-
vanni. -
Once, indeed, unable to resist a pecu-
liarly tender tide of recollections which
the mention of his father’s early career
caused to flow, he spoke at large of that
cherished parent; he described his gentle
manners and gracious countenance; his
bounteous and ever-open hand; his un-

blemished life and guileless heart, which
seemed remnants of the golden age: he
painted his love and reverence of that
honoured parent, with all the eloquence
of profound sensibility; and, as the mois-
ture which clouded his own eyes was re-
flected by that of Giovanni's, now fixed
on him with brotherly expression, he for-
got his hated lineage, and said in broken
accents, “Oh, you were worthy to have
known him '''
Giovanni could with difficulty master
the pleasurable emotion which struggled
to have way: he raised himself from his
couch, took and squeezed Cesario's hand.
Cesario's heart took alarm at that sign of
confidence: the expression of tenderness
subsided from his countenance, while that
of trouble and of self-reproach succeeded.
He fixed his eyes earnestly upon Gio-
vanni, as, profoundly sighing, he said, in
an altered voice, — “Man cannot control
destiny; and he must submit to it.” While
I 5

he spoke, he dropped Giovanni's hand,
and left him.
When they met again, it was on the
ensuing day in the stern gallery, where
Giovanni, for the first time, was allowed
to breathe the free air. ,
A signal from the Admiral had just
declared the objects of the expedition
attained, and turned all the fleet home-
wards. The San Lorenzo was now coast- .
ing the shores of the Papal states; and ere
, a few days should elapse, her victorious
flag would be flying in the port of
Genoa. -
Would that event at once dissolve the
union of mind, if it were not to be called
one of heart, between the preserver
and the preserved? would the sight of
places, where he had suffered real anguish
and supposed wrong, revive the slum-
bering resentment and antipathy of Ce-
sario? would he, indeed, have the cruel
courage to tear himself from all inter-
course with a man, who had sympathised

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 179
with his worthiest feeling? would he in-
flict such a wound upon a trusting breast?
When they met in the gallery, after the
first interchange of good wishes, and the
performance of some kind offices on the
part of Cesario, Giovanni fell into a re-
verie, during which he asked himself
these questions.
Cesario, meanwhile, was thinking of a
far different subject. -
As the galley glided through glassy
waves, under a beautiful morning sky,
he stood, not far from Giovanni, leaning
on the railing of the balcony, completely
abstracted from surrounding things. Gio-
vanni's attention was insensibly attracted
by the peculiar and varying expressions
of his countenance. At times he saw his
cheek kindle, and his eyes sparkle with
sudden brilliancy; then the colour and
the light would fade from both, and
softness, even to languor, steal over his
features.
Unconscious of the tremor and fre-

quency of his sighs, Cesario continued to
muse and to sigh; and once, quite lost to
every other idea, he carried, Beatrice's
ring to his lips, and held it there in a
trance of fond remembrances.
This action, coupled with the look by
which it was accompanied, fixed a floating
suspicion in the mind of Giovanni. He
had observed much in the conduct and
conversation of Cesario, which warranted
the belief of his being attached to some
lady in Genoa; and now, while anxiously
contemplating his agitated countenance,
he grieved to think, that this affection,
though returned by its object, might be
thwarted by unkind relatives, or rendered
abortive by mutual poverty.
“Had my imprudent sister been this
chosen object" he said to himself, in-
dulging a momentary vision of generous
improbabilities, “all might have been
made up to him l’” -
Giovanni had touched the most painful
ehord of his own heart by this spon-

taneous reflection; and, drawn from the
consideration of Cesario by hopes and
fears about his sister, he withdrew his
eyes, which unconsciously took the va-
cant fixture of deep thought, and pur-
sued a train of troubled meditation.
A demand for orders, from some sailors,
who had rowed round the stern, recalled
Cesario to himself; and having given
them the necessary commands, he turned
from his own tumultuous thoughts to seek
the conversation of Giovanni.
But for once he found Giovanni self. .
absorbed ; never had Cesario seen him
look so absolutely sad; and penetrated
by that unusual expression, in proportion
to his own expectation of coming hap-
piness, he drew near and sat down by
him.
“Cigala, something distressing em-
ploys your mind!” he said this in a tone
of lively interest: “I would I could charm
it away, before we part.” He made a
short pause between the first sentence of

this address, and the few concluding
words, which he strove to say in a lighter
1manner.
“And are we to part, Adimari?”
asked Giovanni, raising his full mild eye,
and laying on him a hand chilled by
painful surprise.
“We ought — we must.” — was Ce-
sario's answer, hemming away a sigh,
and averting his head.
“What! part to meet no more?” re-
peated Giovanni.
“ No more on earth — at least not as
we meet now,” resumed Cesario with
seriousness. “You were aware of my
principles– prejudices, if you please-
long ago—I hope you are not very much
surprised to find that I still believe it my
duty to abide by them?” -
It is a strange inconsistency in human
mature, that when we are obliged to say
or do an unkind thing, and feel most pain
from that necessity, we always try to hide
our concern under an appearance of

hardness or indifference. Something like
remorse, in truth it was regret, tugged
at Cesario's heart-strings: yet he main.
tained his air of chilling determination,
and moved a few steps away, to conceal
his inward struggle.
Giovanni looked after him with earnest
observation : a long silence followed.
At length he said, “I am surprised –
and how grieved, I forbear to say. I
wish you had not bestowed on me the
useless obligation of life saved: for what

world, bereft of kindred, outraged by

“You have loved then, Cigala?”
exclaimed Cesario, turning on him a
countenance all melting with kindly sym-
pathy.
“I have,” replied Giovanni, “and I
remember enough of its pains, to wish
you nothing but its joys. Go, Adimari;
I read your feelings in your face; –
would, I could read your destiny also —

if that were all prosperity, here would I
quit my hold upon your heart; and let
you loose to that happiness, which you
will not even permit me to witness and
rejoice in : but if it is to be otherwise; if
you suspect, that you are destined to
drink the bitter cup I have drunk of,
then nothing shall make me leave you till
I have wrung your promise of claiming
my grateful sympathy in that day of
desolation.” -
“That day will never come !” ex-
claimed Cesario, rapturously. “Witness
this precious pledge of love, for which
princes might contend in vain. A moun-

ral turns up and down the gallery, in
troubled silence.
If grief be hard to bear alone, happi-
ness unshared is intolerable. Never
had Cesario groaned so powerfully for
the sympathies of friendship; and never,
till now, had Giovanni's image presented
itself to him in the light of one seeking
compassion and sympathy.
With a sister, whose fate was involved
in mystery; a youth, blighted by unre-
quited or unfortunate love, was not Gio-
vanni Cigala fitted to excite, and to feel,
that species of friendship which, tinc-
tured by the chivalrous spirit of their age,
had in it all the ardour without the in-
firmity of passion 2 Would not his gentler
temper assist Cesario in moderating the
impetuosity of his? Were the elder Adi-
mari, in heaven, allowed to select a bosom

not choose such an one as Giovanni? and

sentiments on this trying question, what
would they be 2 *
Cesario pressed his throbbing temples
with his hand, as he paused upon these
questions. Again he asked himself, what
would his father’s sentiments be 2 and
the reply was, -affection for Giovanni's
admirable and estimable qualities; sen-
sibility to his attachment; grateful re-
membrance of all he had offered, and all
he had done, to soothe the pain of wounds
which he could not prevent
By the elder Adimari’s silent resent-
ment at the supposed ingratitude of
Prince Doria, had he not distinctly de-
livered it as his opinion, that a man is
bound, by indissoluble ties, to him who
has saved his life? Thus, then, Gio-
vanni's persevering attachment took the
stamp of a duty; and if it were virtue in
him to persevere, it must be culpable or
cruel in his preserver to resist.

of impiety, if I link my heart with Ci-

gala?” asked Cesario, inwardly. “Is it
enough that again and again I spurned
his offered kindness, when I had no
friend to console me, no heart to beat,
like his, in generous sympathy with
mine? Then I might have doubted the
disinterestedness of my gratitude; but
now, O, my father! may I not forget that
he is the son of thy destroyer, and think
of him but as one to whom I may lament
thee P”
During this internal address, he stood
with his face buried in his hands. Gio-
vanni watched him from a short distance,
with extreme anxiety. Suddenly Cesario .
approached: he stretched out his arms,
his face beaming through tears. Gio-
vanni precipitated himself upon his neck,
and there, locked in a strong embrace,
their hearts silently exchanged the vow
of friendship. -
If their delight in each other's so-
ciety had hitherto been great, what was
it now, when reserve on the one side,

and apprehension on the other, gave
way before the full tide of mutual confi-
dence 2 -
The story of Giovanni's past, and Ce-
sario's present love, occupied many suc-
ceeding hours. Cesario was moved by
the vivid picture Giovanni drew of his
former sensibility to the most powerful
of human passions; but more astonished,
that, having once felt such a passion, he
should live to look back on those days
without anguish that they were over.
It could not arise from coldness of
character, he thought; for with what
enthusiasm did he speak of the chivalric
profession into which he had then thrown
himself; and with what romantic per-
severance had he sought his friendship !
Was it then the natural march of human
feeling? Cesario shuddered at the chil-
ling supposition: for love was now a
source of such bliss to him, that he fan-
cied even its torments preferable to its
extinction,

The openness with which he expressed
this astonishment might have tempted
another man into justifying his own sen-
sibility, by explaining the soberising ef.
fects of time, and of reason, earnestly
called into action; but, unwilling to
rend the bright blossoms of youthful im-
agination, Giovanni forbore to detail the
progress of his mind from grief to indig-
nation, from indignation to scorn, and
at last to indifference. He simply said,
“From the moment of my profession, I
devoted the powers of my mind, and
the affections of my heart, to higher pur-
poses: I devoted myself to a life of
singleness and the cross. Is it wonder-
ful, then, that my soul should reject
every remembrance of a sentiment which
its object had dishonoured in my eyes,
and that I should consider the vow which
bound me to refrain from woman’s love,
not as bondage, but as freedom 2 I
know not what the destiny of my heart
might have been, had my attachment

been as truly returned as yours, and my
mistress torn from me by death or duty:
as it is, I have done with every inclina-
tion of the kind.” -
Cesario smiled—“You will love again,
and find happiness.”
“No : friendship will content me,”
replied Giovanni; and the satisfaction,
as well as purity of heaven, shone in his
serene eyes.
Cesario shook his head, without speak-
ing ; but his smile, and the incredulous
action of his head, required no com-
ment.
The conversation again reverted to
Signora Brignoletti. Beatrice was, per-
sonally unknown to Giovanni; he there-
fore took his idea of her from the por-
trait painted by her lover.
Coloured by that lover's vivid sensi-
bility, her portrait was, indeed, charm-
ing: it was Beauty, without thought of
power; Youth, in all its innocence and
ardour; Love, undisguised, because pure

and generous: in short, it was all that
would have given happiness in those
blissful days, when the affections and
duties were man’s only law-givers, and the
tyranny of prejudices and the distinc-
tions of society were unknown.
But, alas ! those blissful times were
past, and Giovanni saw in their stead a
host of difficulties between his friend’s
wishes and their object.
Beatrice was very young; most likely,
therefore, timid in spirit; long-continued
opposition from her relatives might even-
tually harass her into giving up her own
inclinations. Possibly she might have
the instability of her age; and time, or a
new object, cause her fancy to alter.
But of all the obstacles to Cesario's
success which Giovanni imagined, none
appeared to him so formidable, and so
sure of checking his fond career, as Ce-
sario's own principles. At present, in-
toxicated with the joy of beholding his
fair mistress, and being permitted to tell

her how absolute she reigned over his
affections, Cesario dreamt not of a wish
beyond, nor anticipated the period when
headlong passion would demand its ut-
most gratification, and meditate seizing
it at the expense of Beatrice's duty and
his own honour.
Giovanni foresaw this period, and
rightly believed that Cesario would then
shrink with horror from the baseness of
persuading a young woman to abandon
her first duties, and act in open rebellion
against her sole remaining parent. Nay,
were even that parent’s consent to be
wrung from her by importunities or per-
severance, how would Cesario's pride en-
dure the humiliation of owing dignity
and riches to his wife? How would his
jealous reputation bear the probable mis-
conception of public opinion? -
Giovanni felt and reasoned thus for
his friend; but, as yet, their bond of
amity was too newly knit to warrant him
in urging a sacrifice of this inauspicious

attachment: he could only resolve to
watch its progress with an attentive eye,
and to seize the first troubled feeling of
Cesario, as a fortunate opportunity for
enlarging upon those motives, which he
ventured to hope, would be all-powerful
with one so ingenuous and so just.
If Giovanni ever indulged a selfish
joy, this was the period in which he was
the most inclined to it: for, in attaining
Cesario's friendship, he had acquired
that, which for six years, he had sought
in vain—a source of deep, increasing
interest, calculated to nourish that gene-
rous sympathy which might be said to
constitute his very being, and which had
languished hitherto for want of aliment.
Giovanni's soul did, in truth, realise
the beau ideal of those enchanting min-
strels of the “olden time,” whose songs
immortalise some fancied hero, capable
of love without desire, and friendship
excelling even that disinterestedness, in
its capacity of sacrificing the hopes of

love to impregnable fidelity. Had the
outward expression of this character
been more marked, or fluently professed
by him who bore it, those who studied
it might have believed it the result of a
strong aspiration after excellence, and
consequent victory over human weak-
ness; but so calmly and uniformly did
it appear, on every occasion, in Giovanni,
that it was impossible not to consider it
as the involuntary habit of a soul follow-
ing its own nature, without resistance or
effort.
Although this tranquil constancy
stamped a sacred character upon qua-
lities which might otherwise have seemed
romantic, Giovanni was less likely to
kindle enthusiasm in his admirers, than
to excite in them that still, profound
satisfaction, with which we contemplate
beatified natures.
Even that which now constituted his
own especial gratification, in this new
bond of amity, was more an animating

hope of benefitting Cesario hereafter,
than the prospect (delightful as it was)
of solacing himself with his fraternal
affection.
He foresaw the near approach of that
crisis in Cesario's connection with Sig-
mora Brignoletti, when either his assaulted
principles would require the encourage-
ment of friendship, to assist him in van-
quishing strong temptation to act wrong,
or his betrayed love demand sympathy
and consolation. -
: “My heart shall support him in that
trial,” he said to himself; and Giovanni
soothed his own prophetic sadness with
this kindly thought.
It was so sweet to him, to witness
every day the rapid increase of Cesario's
confidence; and to observe the noble
elements of a character, not yet reduced
to that harmonious order, that frame of
moral beauty, to which they seemed des-
tined, that he could have chidden the

favourable gales, now speeding them on
their way home.
But Giovanni was incapable of selfish-
mess, even thus ennobled; and he turned
with pleasure to the certainty of his
friend’s honourable welcome from his
country, after the acquisition of so much
renown.
Cesario, on his part, was never weary
of listening to the wide-reaching conver-
sation of his friend. His own habits had
been more active than studious; and
though he knew the histories of past
ages, he rather remembered than re-
flected on them.
Giovanni's remarks taught him that
all the instruction of history lies in the
important lessons it gives; not in its
otherwise sterile list of facts. He taught
him to carry every thing back to his
own heart, and his own conduct; to esti-
mate men's actions by their motives;
and while observing the tissue of their
crimes, and virtues, and inconsistencies,

to remark, how surely they all tend, in
the hand of Providence, to the great
work of human improvement.
By directing his attention to this ana-
lysis of characters and circumstances,
Giovanni shook many of Cesario's fa-
vourite and fostered prejudices: but he
shook them with so gentle a touch, that
Cesario's pride was not roused to defend
them; and thus left to the operations of
truth and tenderness, they were gradu-
ally giving way.
Giovanni beheld his growing influence
with generous exultation: for he sought
Cesario’s happiness; and he wisely be-
lieved, that he who weeds out a fault,
and plants a virtue in a friend, does far
more for his comfort, even here, than he
that bestows on him all the earthly ob-
jects of man’s desire.

CHAPTER XI.
WHEN the victorious gallies were peace-
fully moored in the harbour of Genoa,
Prince Doria procured for his young
officer, the public thanks of the seigniory.
Those thanks were followed, in private,
by the offer of a pecuniary reward in
recompense of the Capitain-Basha's ves-
sel. At that moment, Cesario thought
only of his father: he forgot his bondaged
fortune; he forgot even Beatrice; and,
transported with filial feelings, could only
say, “A monument for my father in the
cathedral of San Siro; and this, and alk
my future services are over-paid P’
Some eyes were moist that looked on
him, as he pronounced these words.
The request was immediately granted;

and Cesario himself was empowered to su-
perintend its execution. It was not the
costly marble of which this memorial was
afterwards formed; it was not the story of
Gianettino Doria’s deliverance, sculp-
tured on its front; it was not the actual
banner, then saved with the prince, and
now floating over the pictured scene; it
was not even the proud distinction of
its being erected by the hands of his
country, which wrought Cesario's joy
almost to transport. It was the consci-
ousness that he had earned this trophy
with his blood; and thus proved himself
worthy the name of him to whom it was
dedicated.
In this pious joy, Giovanni could now
mingle his faithful spirit, without dread
of repulse. When the monument was
placed in the church of San Siro, Cesario,
in a paroxysm of re-awakened grief and
exultation, ran to throw himself upon
Giovanni's breast. - - -
On that kindly breast, he feared not to

give those tender feelings way; beneath
that gracious eye, he suffered his tears
to flow, cease, and gush again, in alter-
nate gusts of recollected and present
happiness, of regret and gratitude, of
pain and pleasure.
Giovanni pressed him in a strong em-
brace, while silently witnessing these
bursts of an over-wrought sensibility.
“Alas, what materials of misery, perhaps,
are here,” he said inwardly; “yes:—of
misery, in this brief world; but of double
felicity in the world of spirits.” And at
that thought, the cloud hanging over
Giovanni's heavenly countenance at once
fled.
Cesario recovered from his stormy
transports, only to run back to the church
of San Siro; to feast his eyes again with
the sight of his father's monument; to
return once more to Giovanni; and to
lose, in his fraternal sympathy, all re-
membrance of his relationship to the de-
stroyer of that honoured parent. -

Hearts so knit, hearts so cemented;
were they ever to be rent asunder?
O frail estate of man
After the accomplishment of this sacred
object, Cesario restored himself to Bea-
trice. He had sought her immediately
on landing at Genoa; and had obtained,
in that sudden and accidentally private
interview, a full confirmation of what the
yielded ring had promised.
He taught her to consider this ring as
the talisman by which his late achieve-
ment had been operated: as such, she
heard with increased joy of the honours
awarded him by the seigniory; and though
she sometimes upbraided him, with sweet
injustice, for devoting nearly all his
hours to urge the completion of his
father’s memorial, her anger never out-
lasted the first kiss which he printed on
her willing hand.
Cesario was now hurrying along a swift
stream of transport, that, by its rapidity,
left him not time to look steadily on the

brilliant objects past which it was sweep-
ing; nor to think of the frightful regions
into which it might eventually bear him.
He was sensible but to present felicity;
and, far from the horrid images of guilt
and self-reproach, dreamt not, that even
the tide of happiness, when not watched
in its flow, may glide at last into their
gloomy confines.
The cold salutations of the Marchesa
had no longer power to chill his hopes:
he followed Beatrice like her shadow;
and as she scarcely endeavoured to veil
her partiality for one whom a brilliant
action covered with glory, even the re-
straints and the distractions of large so-
cieties did but feebly shade the lustre of
his enjoyments.
The mountain-hut was forgotten: Bea-
trice sparkled brightest in the brightest
scenes: her gay caprices charmingly va-
ried the settled forms of a life of repre-
sentation; and what would elicit these in
the calm of retirement?

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 203
Cesario began to covet honours and
rewards for the sake of her, whose habits
made riches, or at least distinction, neces-
sary. He therefore panted impatiently
for another opportunity of deserving and
winning both.
Though loving with all the ardour of a
first passion, he retained sufficient reason-
ableness to see the folly of seeking the
Marchesa Brignoletti's consent to his
union with her daughter. At present, the
celebrity of his name was but just rising
above the ruins of his father's fortune:
the former was yet to be extended; the
latter, to be new made: then, and not
till then, could he venture to express his
wishes.
Cesario submitted to this necessity,
but he abhorred the thought of shroud-
ing his attachment by any artifice. Too
honest, and too proud, to purchase the
Marchesa's forbearance by the sacrifice
of self-esteem, he left the secret of his

heart free to shine out on his counte-
nance and in his actions.
This principle, very early avowed to
Beatrice, checked her from uttering a
different one; and she therefore contented
herself with smiling her sanction to the
candour of her lover, while she cunningly
rendered the light veil of her own heart
a little less transparent.
Beatrice well knew that her mother’s
smothered suspicion of Cesario's atten-
tions, before he went to sea, would now
break out in peremptory commands, un-
less some adroit stratagems were used to
lull her alarm.
She had not courage to confess her
attachment; much less her determina-
tion to abide by it: besides, since she had
wrested the avowal of his passion from
him, she felt the very opposite of a desire
to run into a desert with him.
Though she loved Cesario, she loved
pleasure also; and half her heart's joy
consisted in seeing him slight every other

beauty for her sake. There were many
beauties, whose advances Cesario abso-
lutely shunned. All this triumph would
cease in the mountain-hut: it was there-
fore her policy to wait the turns of ac-
cident, and meanwhile parry her mother’s
suspicions. -
To effect this, Beatrice affected entire
confidence in her mother; rallied herself,
with great spirit, upon her evident con-
quest of so exalted a personage as the
ruined son of Francisco Adimari; sported
with the details of his tender speeches
and jealous looks; and, in fine, perfectly
succeeded in making her mother believe,
that she despised the lover, while she
liked the love; and that a little vanity,
and a little mischief, were her only sti-
mulants. -
Beatrice, in reality, was amused by the
success of her scheme ; and, hurrying
over the question of its morality, she
found in it as much food for mirth as
shelter for inclination.

Cesario, unsuspicious of any under-
plot, saw things just as they seemed:
and, perhaps, too happy for reflection
upon his happiness, might never have
observed the relaxed brow of the Mar-
chesa, had not his friend Giovanni gently
hinted at her future prohibition of his
visits.
Then it was that Cesario first remarked,
the tranquillity with which she now saw
his passion for her daughter; and catch-
ing fire at the thought, his hopes blazed
forth at once into certainty.
Surely this quiescence was a tacit per-
mission to win Beatrice by noble exploits!
He was yet but entering the road of
honour, it is true, and had fortune to
retrieve ; but the blood of kings and
princes filled his veins, rendering it more
than worthy to mingle with that of the
Brignoletti.
The Marchesa must know that his
ancestors were sovereigns where he now
possessed not a rood of land; holding the

title of Counts of Genoa for more than
three centuries. She must know, that
they claimed kindred with the illustrious
Pepin, by whom their jurisdiction was
bestowed ; and that, althougii sunk to
absolute poverty in their solitary repre-
sentative, remembrance of his family was
still coupled, in the minds of men, with
ideas of magnificence and power.
Giovanni listened to the visionary
transport of his friend with painful scep-
ticism. The Marchesa was not likely to
be thus actuated by the mere shadows of
precious things, when their realities might
be offered to her daughter by more for-
tunate rivals. Yet such romance was
possible; or rather it was possible that
an excess of maternal fondness might in-
duce her to sacrifice her own wish of an
equal alliance for her daughter, to that
daughter's peculiar happiness.
Giovanni wished this might prove the
case, but he ventured not to hope it;
yet too tender for the severest office of

friendship, he contented himself with
turning the projects of Cesario's love to-
wards the interests of his glory.
After signalising himself in the de-
fence of his country and the protection
of Christendom, should this cherished
friend be disappointed of the lovely re-
ward which now animated him, still there
would remain for him the substantial pos-
sessions of an honourable reputation, re-
vived fortunes, and the consciousness of
high desert. -
In Giovanni's estimation, these bless-
ings, with friendship added, included all
that life had of desirable and noble; and
while he contemplated the possibility of
disappointment to his friend’s passion, he
believed that such a catastrophe would
eventually lead that ardent soul, as it had
impelled his own, to fix upon great and
imperishable objects alone.
Beatrice was yet personally unknown
to Giovanni; for the latter found much
to occupy his time after his return home,

and the former had little inclination to
make the acquaintance of one whom she
persisted in imagining disagreeable, be-
cause he had once been almost a monk,
and was, even now, resolved never to
marry. .
In truth, Beatrice generally felt pretty
accurately upon most subjects without
the trouble of reasoning; and, though
quite unreflecting upon her own conduct,
seemed to know by intuition that her
lover’s friend would scrutinise and con-
demn what that dazzled lover admired.
Giovanni might detect her subtle game
with the Marchesa; and if once he di-
rected Cesario's eyes to the fact, she felt
certain that her humiliation in her lover's
opinion would be the immediate conse-
quence.
Beatrice was yet too unpractised to
have divined the baneful secret of making
an excess of love her apology for every
violation of dignity or morality: a secret,
it is said, by which the loftiest manly

character is bent to the most degrading
connections. -
She knew that Cesario’s censure would
overwhelm her with shame; and she
therefore studiously avoided the person
whose discernment and austere principles
threatened her little artifices with de-
struction.
Under these impressions, Beatrice
evaded Giovanni's introduction; and she
did this the more easily from his frequent
absences. -
He was desirous of providing for the
shelter and refreshment of the humbler
order of travellers among the wild moun-
tains leading into Lombardy; and for
this purpose he promoted and superin-
tended the erection of several small
buildings, where both rest and refresh-
ment were to be furnished at his expense.
Another occupation, equally benevo-
lent in its object, but visionary in its
hopes, withdrew him yet more from so-
ciety; stole him from his sleep, his food,

his exercise, and rendered all things in-
different to him, excepting the company
of Cesario.
This occupation was the study of the
Genoese laws; and the object he sought
to gain was the reversal of that sentence
by which he possessed the estate of Adi-
mari.
Ere he embraced the profession of
knighthood, Giovanni, in common with
every other Genoese youth, had devoted
much attention to legal studies: it was
the regular course in educating persons
destined from their birth to contend for
the highest offices in the republic.
He now returned to these studies with
a zest they had not before; fondly be-
lieving he should find some forgotten
statute or precedent which might warrant
him in agitating a new process, and
finally restore to Cesario the home of his

those civic honours of which he believed
himself as yet unworthy; and for which,

it, would have been the one his father
had withdrawn him from : it would have
been that of arms, pursued in the name
and for the interests of religion. But as
it was, with particular duties to fulfil,
and private friendship to gratify, he was
content to consider the situation of an
active citizen as that for which Provi-
dence had ordained him; and to go on
in it content and cheerful.
Occupied as he was by his buildings
and his application to law-books, Gio-

racter of a woman on whom Cesario's
peace depended, not to remark with con-
siderable mortification that every arrange-
ment for his visiting at the Palazzo Rosso
was continually frustrated by her frivolous

Far from guessing the real reason—
her awe of, and distaste to his character,-
he concluded she must be of a jealous
disposition; and that even friendship was
in her eyes a treachery to love.
Sometimes this conjecture made him
uneasy at the effect of her influence over
the heart she would rule so exclusively;
but the apprehension lasted not a mo-
ment: Cesario’s speaking countenance,
whatever else it expressed of sadness or
of joy unconnected with Giovanni, was
still expressive of grateful, spontaneous
fraternal affection. -
Still, with Giovanni only, did he talk
of his father and his boyish days: still,
with him only, did he give voice to the
day-dreams of a youthful soul, animated

by the emulation of every thing noble,
every thing praiseworthy; animated too
by love.
It is only when our hearts thus think
aloud in the presence of another, that we
have found a friend; that noble abandon-
ment is the pledge of mutual faith.
Since their interchange of vows on the
deck of the San Lorenzo, Cesario and
Giovanni had opened to each other the
inmost recesses of their souls; they had
led each other back from the full stream
of their present friendship to its hidden

In their mutual confessions, each found
more to esteem in the character of the
other: Cesario reproached his own proud
prejudices, which had urged him so often
to repulse with bitterness the gentle na-
ture that approached him so amiably;
and Giovanni taxed himself with injustice
because he had not divined what it cost
Cesario to treat him with ferocity.
Thus each saw more to prize in his

friend, and more to repent of in himself;
Consequently, the wish of repairing in-
justice gave fresh energy to the impulse
of inclination.
It was no longer bitterness for Cesario
to re-tread his father's steps on the ter-
race at the Marino, or to sit in the seat
he used to love, under the old cedar;
this beloved spot was indeed no longer
his, but it was the property of one who
grieved over its possession; who reve-
renced every memorial of the sacred
dead; and who, while apologising for his
unwilling detention of a place so dear,
by degrees convinced Cesario that justice
attached it to the Cigala property.
Cesario ceased, therefore, to consider
the subject with acrimony: it was only
when he thought his father's life had
fallen a sacrifice to this hardly-enforced
right, that he felt all his former passions
rekindle. -
At first, Giovanni pressed on him the
occupation of this endeared villa; but

Cesario could not forget that it was the
son of Paulo Cigala who would thus lend
him what had once been his own, and
he refused it with impetuosity; the next
instant he softened his refusal by a look
that spoke volumes; and by the pro-
mise of using the Marino as if it were
still his home.
Giovanni pardoned him this imperfec-
tion of friendship; and serenely waiting
the effects of time and increased con-
fidence, forbore to hint to him what he
longed to urge—an equal participation
in each other’s fortunes.
Giovanni could not resign his kindred's
right to the Marino; nor would he aban-
don it to the possession of any one less
anxious than himself, to preserve it in its
original beauty; but he abhorred the
thought of appropriating the liberal re-
turns of this estate to the purposes of his
own establishment: he therefore devoted
them exclusively to acts of charity.

tion Friars, the rents of the Marino were
employed in ransoming Christian slaves.
Many a hopeless captive, who had long
languished under the tyranny of Algerine
masters, was thus released from toil and
suffering, and restored to his home.
Cesario accidentally discovered this
merciful destination of wealth which was
once his own; and loving Giovanni the
better for the discovery, he no longer
allowed himself to regret the loss of a
fortune which, instead of increasing the
luxuries of one individual, bestowed bless-
ings upon numbers.
Meanwhile, he continued to reside with
the good Syndic and his wife; content
to live with the utmost simplicity, and
entering crowds only at the Palazzos
Doria and Rosso.
His former associate, Marco Doria,
had long since abandoned the falconer’s
cottage; and was again afloat upon the
idle currents of vanity and dissipation.
They met with the same cordiality as

formerly, though their companionship
was somewhat injured by Cesario's nobler
tie with Giovanni, and yet more, by a
new whim of the Iris-humoured Marco.
This absurd young man, as if in de-
fiance of his own capricious character,
had formally assumed the office of cices-
beo to a lady then newly married: by
this act he bound himself to servitude
without relaxation or without recom-
pense ; for in that early age it was
neither libertinism which sought, nor
infidelity that rewarded this irksome en-
gagement. It was simply the shadow of
what had once had form and substance
in the days of chivalry.

honour and affections of the lady; thus

treasure of domestic happiness. We may
thence conclude that in process of time
this chivalric institution softened into one
less arduous; and the friend who would
formerly have been called on to become
responsible for the virtue of the lady in-
trusted to his care, was only required to
watch over her outward demeanour in
public on private circles; to animate her
innocent pleasures, and protect her from
neglect or insult.
At what time this harmless, nay kindly
appointment sunk into the odium it is
now said to deserve, it is impossible to
guess, and would be revolting to enquire:
suffice it, the cicesbei were originally
characters of the noblest class; after-
wards, of the most amiable; now, alas,
too frequently of the basest.
The person to whom Marco Doria had
engaged himself was the Signora Calva,
a woman of honour, but of more spirit
than sense: well-inclined to enjoy all the
privileges which her situation might give

her over the time and attentions of an
amusing young man, and to laugh at the
unwillingness with which she foresaw he
would very soon render them.
Being the favourite cousin and com-
panion of Beatrice Brignoletti, her own
natural vivacity was often heightened into
mischief by her friend's wilder spirits;
and Marco Doria's patience or constancy
was thus put to many a severe test.
The very act of accepting Marco as
her cicesbeo had been a scheme of mirth
concerted between Signora Calva, her
bridegroom, and Beatrice. They anti-
cipated much entertainment from the
zeal with which he would begin his new
duties, and the loathing with which he
would eventually meet their perform-
ance: their triumph was to consist in
driving him to the desperate act of en-
treating for a release.
The affair had already reached its se.
cond stage of wearisomeness to Marco
Doria, when Cesario returned from sea;

but whether Marco had conceived a sus-
picion of collusion amongst the parties,
and was excited to disappoint their good-
humoured malice, or whether he really
considered adherence to this engagement
as a point of honour, or whether he sim-
ply endeavoured to prove that he could
persevere when he chose to do so, is
doubtful; but it is certain that he did
persevere. -
In vain Signora Calva flew from town
to country, from carnival to fair, from
hawking to angling, from praying to
dancing; in vain she varied her humour
from gay to grave, from amiable to
austere, from mild to vindictive: Marco
Doria kept to his post; and, ever at her
side, performed all the duties of a liege
cicesbeo, with apparent satisfaction.
The allied powers were nearly wearied
out by this unforeseen dissimulation; and
were busily plotting some ruse de guerre
by which to capture him at once, when

confederacy, — Cesario went on service.
Advice was brought to Genoa, that
a Barbary cruiser had made a descent
upon the coast of Tuscany during the
night, carried off several of the inha-
bitants, and was now proceeding with
her prey towards the Straits of St. Bo-
nifacio. -
The horror of such events was never
diminished by their frequency; for as

Adriatic, had either suffered from the
fear or the reality of such visitations,
during the last twenty years; they shud-
dered, with more than pity, when they
heard of those calamities befalling their
neighbours.
What indeed could exceed the horror,
of men being suddenly snatched from
the bosoms of their families; or what is
worse, of seeing their wives, children, and

parents, plunged into the same misery
with themselves 2
Neither sex, age, character, nor con-
dition, was spared by these ocean robbers.
The great and the mean, the rich and the
poor, were alike torn without remorse
from their enjoyments and their ties; and
carried into captivity.
But a few years had elapsed, since their
audacious enterprises were on the point
of being crowned by the possession of
the supreme Pontiff himself; and as this
terrible incident was fresh in every mind,
it rendered the images of the pirates as
impious as formidable.
No sooner did the rumour of their
present descent reach Cesario, than,
agitated by compassion for the poor Tus-
cans, excited by the hope of regaining
them, and thus finding glory in the ser-
vice of Humanity, he ran to the Prince
of Melfi ; and besought his interest with
the Seigniory, for permission to follow
the pirates.

224, THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
His earnestness, his former gallant
conduct, the urgency of the occasion,
and the strenuous recommendation of the
admiral, prevailed on the doge and his
counsellors. A galliot was then lying in
the harbour, just returned from a short
cruise, the captain of which was disabled
by illness. To the command of this ves-
sel, Cesario was immediately appointed;
and in less than four hours from the con-
firmation of the report, he was at sea.
The pressing nature of his enterprise
only allowed him to take a written fare-
well of Beatrice, and to leave a parting
message at Giovanni's door.
That valued friend was gone for a few
days to his house beyond Pietra Lava-
serra; little imagining, that ere he
should return, Cesario would be again
seeking honour at the cannon’s mouth,
on the eventful ocean. -
It had been Giovanni’s determination
to share all future perils with the man to
whom he had consecrated his friendship;

what then was his mortification, to learn
by the arrival of a servant, that Cesario's
vessel had been long out of sight ere the
man left Genoa; and that the galley he
chased, was commanded by the desperate
pirate Delli Rais ! -
Cesario, with all his bravery and talent,
was yet but imperfectly versed in the
subtler part of a profession, where skilful
manoeuvre so often baffles the hardiest
spirit. Delli Rais, educated by the for-
midable Dragut, was known to have im-
bibed, not only the daring character of
his master, but his keener genius for
stratagem. He knew, too, every inch of
coast from the mouth of the Nile to
the Pillars of Hercules.
With such an adversary, even Cesario's
courage (and it was that of a lion) would
be of no avail; unless assisted by the ex-
perience of practised seamen and officers.
Giovanni rationally concluded, that the
Prince of Melfi had foreseen and provided
for this; and hestrove, therefore, to confine

his concern solely to the regret of not
sharing danger and honour with the friend
he loved.
That regret was indeed deep and sin-
cere; for his spirit panted for action;
and his heart sunk at the prospect of a
long chasm in their daily intercourse.

CHAPTER XII.
Musing over these things, during his
return from a charitable errand, Giovanni
stopped to observe the effect of a moon-
light upon the broken side of a ruined
chapel, which started from an Ilex wood
overhanging his path.
The silvery touches of that lovely light,
beautifully contrasted with the deep ver-
dure of the trees; and the fresh night
air, just quivering their twinkling leaves,
seemed, as it moaned round the de-
serted edifice, to utter the dirge of de-
parted time. -
Giovanni fixed his eyes upon the shat-
tered remains of a cross, in the open area
of the building: it was nearly overgrown
with wild vine. That emblem, so sacred in

his estimation, and so degraded, changed
his thoughts; and ceasing to admire the
prospect of mountain, wood, and dell, he
thought only of restoring the temple of
the Saviour to its original order.
Though the ruin was not on his do-
main, he was tolerably certain that no
one would obstruct him in the execution
of so pious a work; and delighting him-
self with the prospect of its completion,
he was proceeding, with his sword, to
cut away the foul weeds clasping the
cross, when the shriek of a woman made
him start forward, and look round for her
that utered it.
His astonishment was extreme, when
he beheld a young creature in the dress
of a novice, but without her veil, alone,
and running towards him with the air of
one distracted.
“O, save me! sir,” she cried; “ you
are a knight—protect me—hide me!”—
Misled by a badge of the order to
which Giovanni formerly belonged, and

which he still wore in pious memorial,
the lady almost threw herself into his
arms, striving to cover her face with his
mantle; Giovanni flung it round her, and
bore her into the chapel. -
He then seated himself by her, upon
a fragment of stone; and as the pale
moonbeam fell upon her, whitening the
panting neck and rounded cheek, from
which terror had banished colour; as its
tremulous light glittered on the tears in
her eyes, he thought he had rarely seen
any thing so lovely.
His own mild eyes, full of tender
concern, and his usually composed com-
plexion, heightened into lustre by surprise,
were displayed to advantage by the same
soft light. The novice evidently beheld
them, and his superb figure, which the
want of his mantle fully discovered, with
wondering admiration; for she gazed at
him in silence, unconscious that he ad-
dressed her.
“What am I to protect you from,

madam?” he asked respectfully, remov-
ing his supporting arm when he saw her
recovering. — “Where may I conduct
you?—by your dress”—He glanced at
her white garments and ebon crucifix.
The brightest and deepest blushes
then overspread the youthful face of the
novice; she turned away in some con-
fusion, faintly repeating, in a voice be-
tween weeping and smiling, “This dress
is a disguise ; I am not a religious—
I have been mistaken for one, and am
pursued by the brethren of San Eugenio.
O sir, if they discover who I am–
where, where will you hide me!”—
More perplexed, and amazed than be-
fore, Giovanni's looks expressed extreme
disturbance. “I can conceal you here
for a while, madam,” he said: “I have a
sword, and will defend you, with my
life, against every thing but the au-
thority of the church.” And as he
spoke, he advanced to the entrance of
the chapel.

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN, 231
A mingled confusion of laughter, hal-
loos, and expressions of alarm, was heard
from that quarter of the wood whence
the lady had issued; and Giovanni dis.
tinctly heard a boy’s voice calling, “Sig-
nora, Signora! there is nothing to fear.”
The sound was speedily followed by
the appearance of a motley groupe of
men and women, in religious habits,
whose laughing exclamations quickly
brought the fictitious novice from her
retreat.
A hurry of embraces, congratulations,
reproaches, and interrogations, then fol-
lowed, while Giovanni stood clasping his
useless sword with the air of a man
awaking from a dream. All he could
collect from the scene, was that one
party had attempted to impose upon the
other, and that the last had outwitted
the first. -
“Do I leave you in the hands you
wish, madam?” asked Giovanni, taking

up his cloak which the lady had let fall,
and preparing to depart.
“O you must not leave me, my pro-
tector,” she replied, ardently catching
his arm : “I have not thanked you yet.—
By what name must I address you?”
“Surely it is Signor Cigala P’ said one
of the company, coming forward, and
discovering, under the cowl of a monk,
the piquant countenance of Marco
Doria.
“Cigala —the friend of Cesario !”
repeated the lady with animation.—
“Ah Signor then you must not go.”
Giovanni looked at her while she
spoke; and the moonlight now showed
that lately-pale face, sparkling with colour
and joy. He could not mistake that
rayonante complexion which his friend
had so often described: “The Signora
Brignoletti!” he repeated, and respect-
fully kissed her extended hand.
Her spirits, the distant place in which
they met, and the childish trick which

had caused their meeting, convinced
Giovanni that Beatrice was yet ignorant
of her lover's departure from Genoa;
and at this thought he fixed his eyes on
her with a look of tender commiseration.
Beatrice was not very able in the
knowledge of countenance, and she mis-
took that expression for one of pure
admiration. “This is the man who fore-
swears the power of beauty,” she said to
herself; and, from that instant, she forgot
he was also the friend of her lover.
The Signora Calva's request, that
Giovanni would return with them to
his casino, was seconded with much cor-
diality by Marco Doria, and with more
earnestness by Beatrice. Uneasily anxious
to see her character closer, he yielded
immediate consent; and the lively party
proceeded down the mountain.
During their walk homewards, and it
was not a short one, the mystery of their
disguises was explained to him : he
learned that a trick had been devised

234 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
between Signora Calva and Beatrice, by
which they hoped to seduce Marco Do-
ria from his duty to the former: — a
pretty page belonging to the latter was
dressed in the habit of a novice, and in-
structed in a tale of parental tyranny,
likely to enlist Marco's knight-errantry
on her side : the boy’s effeminate beauty
and well-taught flatteries, were expected
to work upon his susceptibility, or va-
nity; and as this pretended novice’s
task was to get him to elope with her
from the pursuit of her relations, &c. it
was hoped that Marco would fall into
the snare, and thus leave the field to the
conquerors of his constancy. Beatrice,
in the character of a sister-novice, could
not refuse herself the imprudent amuse-
ment of witnessing Marco's delusion.
The scheme was admirably planned, they
thought; for Marco accompanied the
Signora Calva and her husband to their
country-house, unconscious that Beatrice
was concealed in it; and that the tender

billet he received the next day, appoint-
ing an interview that night, was written
by her pen.
But unfortunately for the conspiring
ladies, Signor Calva, with true esprit de
corps, felt reluctant to cover one of his
own majestic sex with shame and ridi-
cule; so, counterplotting his wife and
her friend, he concerted with Marco the
merry revenge of allowing the two no-
vices to repair, in all the pomp of their
vestal veils to the appointed spot, and
then to rush on them in the character of
monks. -
The terror of public exposure and
spiritual censure, fully revenged Marco;
for the poor page actually fainted away
at the sight of such a crowd of ecclesi-
astics, (as Signor Calva had strengthened
his party by servants,) and Beatrice flew,
in terror, she knew not whither.
Some reproaches, but more lively sal-
lies, were mutually exchanged; after
which, the tie between Marco and the

family of Signor Calva was amicably dis-
solved, and the former left free to follow
his own caprices. º
Meanwhile many a courteous speech
and Euphrosyne glance from Beatrice
tried to soften the severity with which
Giovanni felt inclined to consider her
share in the transaction. He liked not
the levity of a temper so eager for
amusement; it seemed to him, that a
heart occupied by one powerful senti-
ment, and that too clouded by apprehen-
sion, should have no room for childish
mirth. -
Ought any thing to delight, ought any
thing to be sought with avidity uncon-
nected with the object dearest in life?
Giovanni remembered the days of love
with himself, and answered no. -
It was not that he doubted the since-
rity of Beatrice’s attachment; he quar-
relled only with its nature. 'Twas such
as might content a common mind, be-
cause to such it would fully reply; but


## p. 237 (#247) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 237
how was it to satisfy such a heart as
Cesario’s 2 -
Where was that exclusive, concentrated
ardour, that indifference to all, beyond
duties and honourable affections 2 Where
was that deep tenderness, almost amount-
ing to melancholy; that existence but in
the presence, or in the praise of its ob-
ject, which should have kept Beatrice
from leaving Genoa and Cesario, merely
to indulge a girlish caprice? In short,
where was that vital glow of perfect sym-
pathy, which would preseve their attach-
ment, after youth and beauty was gone?.
Giovanni often looked at his fair com-
panion, involuntarily looked at her, and
sighed, as these reflections passed through
his mind; and at those times her bright-
ened eyes and complexion made his
heart smite him.
Why should his observation please her,
unless from his association with the .
image of Cesario?– “I judge women
like a monk!” he said to himself, “and,

perhaps, like an enemy: that is unjust—
I will study her more closely;” — and,
from that moment, he attached himself
to her side.
The Signora Calva received the mot-
ley groupe with just as much participa-
tion with their merriment, as sat well
upon a married woman: a collation of
fruits and ices refreshed them after their
adventures; and Giovanni had, then,
ample opportunity of seeing every indi-
vidual in their genuine character.
Mirth banished ceremony; their plot
and counterplot were amply discussed, and
laughed over: they rallied each other on
their several follies with as much point
as good-humour; and a whimsical de-
bate, in which the whole company joined,
was ended only by a display of Signora
Brignoletti’s peculiar talent.
The question agitated was, in what
ursuit the greatest proportion of human
fº is to be found?
One person named ambition, another

social pleasures, a third study, a fourth
the fine arts, &c. : when Beatrice was
asked, she gaily snatched up her hute,
and bending over it for a few seconds in
silence, burst into an extempore declara-
tion in favour of love.
The sportive glance with which she
first took the instrument, was succeeded
by a look of brief but intense thought;
the next instant, a bright illumination of
intelligence and emotion spread over her
face, while, with the voice and air of in-
spiration, she chanted this momentary
rhapsody: —
O! it is sweet, on one alone,
In waking dreams to muse away
The hours of night, the hours of day;
And as the tide of time is flowing,
To see but one reflection glowing
On its clear glass 1
What matters then, the moments gone,
Since others pass?
Yes, through that stream, so clear, so deep,
In beauty ever-brightening, rises
The form our soul enamoured prizes;

Each tender charm again repeating,
Still, still renewed, though ever fleeting,
Wave follows wave,
While trancing echoes o'er them sweep,
From Memory's cave.
Then shall we scale the rocks of power,
Or colder study's stormy height,
Or weave the flowerets, fair as slight,
Of pleasures vain and unabiding?—
No–still where Time's full stream is gliding
Through Love's green bower,
With thrilling heart and tranced eye,
There let me live—I ask no more —
There let me die!
When Beatrice concluded, the bright-
est colours of the seducing passion she
sung, painted her cheek; and an expres-
sion, at once intoxicating and embarrass-
ing, thrilled from her kindled eyes. Gio-
vanni turned away his from their scarcely-
encountered glance. There was nothing
in her impromptu to find a tangible fault
with ; yet he liked not the subject, sung
with such enthusiasm by a woman.
Love, chaste, regulated love; devoted
to one deserving object, is natural and

honourable in that tender sex, which
Providence has destined to bless the
home of man; but it is as natural for
woman to blush at the avowal of the
sentiment, as to feel it; and she who
can discourse on it with the least restraint,
and the greatest energy, is precisely she
with whom it is rarely but a gust of pas-
sion : — so true is it, that “ love burns.
the brightest in the purest breast.”
Giovanni made no audible remark
upon the song of the fair Improvisatrice,
though all around him were clamorous
in its praise: he sat silent, disturbed and
meditative, with his eyes fixed on the
ground.
Beatrice saw that she had agitated
him; how, she guessed not: — very dif.
ferent were the feelings she vainly at-
tributed to that spotless heart, from what
really worked there. - -
After a long and uneasy reverie, Gio-
vanni rose, and said good night to the
company, leaving Beatrice still in igno-

rance of Cesario's absence. He departed,
carrying with him a painful doubt of her
substantial worth. “The woman that
has not modesty,” he thought, “is des-
titute of virtue’s strongest out-work.”
That she was charming, bewitching,
infatuating, he acknowledged; but it was
witchery, she unconsciously exerted; it
was infatuation, she excited; it was some-
thing, which fled the glance of reason.
Levity of disposition, indiscretion of
conduct, and instability of taste, appeared
to him visible in all her words and ac-
tions. It was a character, innocent per-
haps, but not principled; one that might
have been moulded to good, by judicious
restraint, and consistent example in child-
hood; but which, left to the accidents of
rank, and her own humour, by feeble-
minded relatives, was fast verging to-
wards evil.
Giovanni thought it was possible to
save this almost-interesting young crea-
ture from the moral alteration that

THE KNight of St.John. 243
threatened her; and thus reconciled to
the sudden departure of Cesario, he re-
solved to devote the period of his absence
to the endeavour of rendering his mis-
tress more worthy of him.
Very different was the state of Bea-
trice's mind, at the same period: all
there was delighted confusion. A mul-
titude of indistinct images, as bright as
fleeting, appeared to her successively.
Now it was Giovanni, subdued by her
charms; struggling between love and
friendship; while she nobly preserved
her faith, and bestowed her hand on
Cesario: then it was the same Giovanni,
driven to distraction by her rigour; and,
either roving among savage solitudes, a
maniac for her sake, or dying in some
distant cell, a martyr to that love which
not even the gloom of a cloister could
extinguish. -
Then the picture changed; and for a
moment she fancied Cesario forgotten;
and herself at the bridal altar with the

once-famed Knight of St. John, whom
every female eye must admire, and every
female heart covet!
Her heart beat quick at this imagina-
tion; and it was hard to say, whether its
pulsation was more increased by plea-
sure or by self-condemnation. But, ac-
customed to discard every unpleasing
thought as it arose, Beatrice shifted the
the picture and the feeling, hurrying
from the uncertain future to the agree-
able present.
Again and again she compared the ex-
iterior of the two friends; and, as she did
so, wondered that she had considered Ce-
sario's as the perfection of manly beauty.
It is true, his figure was agile and
finely-turned; abounding in those swelte
and light movements, which display
grace and denote activity: it was such as
we imagine in the messenger of the gods.
But Giovanni might have passed for
one of the gods themselves. His were
the sublime proportions, and sublimer

expression of serenity and greatness
which rose above every other, and pro-
claimed the immortal.
• In short, Beatrice was struck by that
singular mixture of the powerful and the
peaceful, the mild and the commanding,
which distinguished Giovanni from all
his kind: and, perhaps, the proud thought
of troubling that superb calm of counte-
nance and of character, was the source
of an inclination, which, she afterwards
believed, sprung solely from admiration
of this noble superiority. -

gination, and still more of habitual self-

new channel; and perceiving nothing
distinctly, because she would not look at
any thing steadily, she was now com-
mencing a career of dishonourable incon-
stancy.
In his road to Genoa the ensuing day,
Giovanni called at the house of Signor
Calva, to thank him for his hospitality of
the foregoing evening, and to acquaint
Signora Brignoletti of Cesario's cruize.
As he passed an orange-grove in the
garden, he saw her alone, collecting its
scattered blossoms: she dropt her fra-
grant spoils through haste to meet him.
Solicitude to please one, whose dignity
awed her, now tempered her excessive
vivacity; and Giovanni, after a short
dialogue, began to think her character
less volatile than her manner. -
He sat down by her, under one of the
orange-trees, while asking her commands
for Genoa.
“You may carry this flower from me
to your friend, if you will,” she said,

blushing with pretty coquetry, and ex-
pecting him to look, at least, a desire of
keeping it for himself.
But Giovanni, not liking her manner,
gravely put it by with his hand, answer-
ing, that he believed his friend was now
seeking a nobler reward on the ocean.
A start, an exclamation, almost a shriek
from Beatrice, whose conscience smote
her for the reveries of the past night,
made Giovanni's air change from auste-,
rity to tenderness: he looked kindly on
her while he explained the nature of
Cesario's enterprise ; and extolled, not
merely his bravery, but his humanity in
this voluntary cruise.
Beatrice wept with the impetuosity of
a child: at every pause in her gust of
grief, enumerating the dangers that me-
naced Cesario, and condemning herself.
º: this foolish visit to Signora Calva,
ince it had prevented her from receiving
his perhaps last farewell!
Giovanni comforted her by every ar-

gument in his power; agreeably sur-
prised by her excess of feeling, and little
aware of its transitory nature.
He strove, at the same time, to impress
on her, as he always did on Cesario, that
the blameless accomplishments of their
wishes could only be effected by the ac-
quirement of that fame, and those distinc-
tions (if not fortune), which Cesario must
find in the path of danger; or be deemed
both insolent and mercenary, when he
should sue for her hand. - -
“I fear,” he said, “that you must
discipline your mind to endure a long
probation of anxiety and frequent sepa-
ration.” - -
“Oh, 'tis what he suffers P’ she rashly
exclaimed. “ He loves me so much,
that I should be ungrateful, insensible,
not to weep as I am now doing!”
Giovanni averted his gentle eyes as
she spoke; believing those broken sen-
tences proceeded from maiden bashful-
ness, unwilling to confess its own tender- -

ness; but, at a very distant period, he
recalled it as a proof that her’s was a
love of gratitude, rather than of spon-
taneous preference; and in doing so, he
made a second conclusion as erroneous
as the first. -
When Signor Calva and his wife, on
joining Beatrice in the grove, heard that
Giovanni was going to Genoa for only a
single day, they pressed him with great
earnestness to return to their casino, in-
stead of to his own solitary house. Signor
£alva boasted his hawks and his wolf.
dogs; and promised his guest all the
glory of a hazardous chase.
Giovanni considered for a moment; he
was not usually inclined to sudden inti-
macies; but as it was an object with him
to read Beatrice thoroughly, he thanked
Signor Calva, and accepted the invit-
ation. -
That prompt acceptance was another
blow to the image of Cesario in the heart
of his unstable mistress; and her eyes

sparkled with joy: those very eyes which,
but a few moments before, had streamed
with tears!
In truth, for the last night and day,
and for some few that followed, Beatrice’s
inclinations were a sort of chaos, that
would have puzzled the steadiest ob-
server to have guessed in what order it
would at last settle.
So many rapturons recollections and
pangs of remorse, so much of lingering
liking and fear of his despair, was at-
tached to the idea of Cesario; and so
much of novelty, and excited vanity, and
ardour of pursuit, and personal admi-
ration, belonged to that of Giovanni,
that Beatrice herself was unable to decide
what she felt, or what she desired, or
what she meant to do.
This was the moment in which she
ought to have flown from the seductions
of opportunity; and refused to her rising
vanity, or wandering inclination, the food

but, ever self-indulging, she staid at the
casino: and, once from shore, the tide
was free to carry her where it would.

CHAPTER XIII.
During Giovanni's residence of a fort-
night in the same house with the Signora
Brignoletti, he became more sensible to
the witcheries as well as to the defi-
ciencies of her character; and though,
in their frequent conversations, his pure-
ly-benevolent manner, and his earnest
admonitions, showed him unwarped by
any treacherous inclination, Beatrice
found enough to flatter her hopes in the
single circumstance of his remaining a
guest at the casino.
To one so spoiled as Beatrice was, by
every other person, there was something
piquant in his reproofs of her idleness,
or levity, or liberal display of talent;
and having discovered that a look of pe-

nitence became her, she was never spar-
ing of them, nor indeed of promises of
amendment.
Giovanni allowed this ingenuous spirit
to be very charming; but his better judg-
ment saw its worthlessness, as reform-
ation seldom followed confession,
Beatrice was not yet practised enough
for the artifice of overruling her own
faulty habits, and stifling her own fa-
vourite opinions till her point was gained:
she could only look to the soul, with
beautiful eyes all tears and brightness,
and ask again, and again, in a voice ten-
der as a child’s, to hear the catalogue of
her errors, and wish she could be but
half as wise and good as her mentor.
Sometimes she broke forth in grateful
acknowledgments of Giovanni's kind,
austerity, lamenting that Cesario blindly
indulged her follies; and then she always
added, “but he loves me so much l’’.
Giovanni soon began to observe, that
she never added to this phrase any ex-

pression implying an equal attachment on
her side.
Never dreaming, however, that he was
personally concerned in this, he yet felt
certain that his friend's hopes were
hollow, and that the bubble would sooner
or later burst in his hand.
This imagination was a distressing one;
for Cesario's passion was, alas, too real;
and his despair would be extreme. But
Giovanni consoled himself by believing
that as succeeding events must unfold
Beatrice's unsteady character, Cesario
would, at last, be brought to consider the
disappointment as a blessing.
Some business having recalled Gio.
vanni to Genoa, he took leave of the
agreeable Signor Calva with many testi.
monies of good-will; and, as Beatrice
professed her intention of being in Genoa
nearly as soon as himself, he promised
to present himself at the Palazzo Rosso.
Having reached the city, he was
mounting the steps of his own portico,

when he felt himself caught in the arms
of some person behind. He turned
round, and met the beaming look of
Cesario. With what joy did he return
his cordial pressure :
“I have not been an hour on shore,”
exclaimed Cesario; “and am just come
from reporting my success to the Sig-
niory.” - -
Success was, indeed, painted on Ce.
sario's countenance: its animated glow
scarcely required the rapid narrative he
gave by snatches as he entered the
house with Giovanni.
He had overtaken the Barbary vessel,
boarded and captured her. The fight
was fierce; and a Moorish sabre had
nearly severed his left arm from his body;
but a crowd of hapless women and child-
ren were praying to Heaven for his suc-
cess and safety, and Heaven had heard.
With his prize in tow, Cesario steered
for the Tuscan village which the pirates
had plundered. What transport, to re-

store its captured inhabitants to their
homes | What a moment, to see wives
throwing themselves into the arms of
their husbands, children running to kiss
the feet of their venerable parents, whom
they had never expected to see more on
this side the grave! -
Cesario painted the scene, not by
words, but by looks—by the profound
emotion with which he uttered these
few words: “We restored them all!”
Giovanni had known the same satisfac-
tion, and his memory completed the un-
finished picture. -
When his friend’s feelings were a little
quieter, he spoke of Beatrice. At that
name the heart of Cesario blazed forth
afresh. Eager questions, passionate apos-
trophes, expressions of alternate sur-
prise and delight, broke in repeatedly
upon Giovanni's account of his intro-
duction to her; and, as Giovanni uni-
formly answered “Yes,” to his throng-
ing questions of, “Is she not lovely? is
_*

she not charming? is she not delightful?
is she not all ingenuousness?” Cesa-
rio never observed that his friend did
not follow up these affirmations by any
approving observations of his own.
It was enough for his rapid feelings to
know, that his friend and his mistress
were acquainted: after that, he fancied
all the rest.
Every thing now was bright in his on-
ward path: he was rapidly winning ho-
nour and station in society; fortune must
follow: Beatrice loved him ; her mother
ceased to frown on him ; Giovanni was
his friend; and his father's memory was
honourably perpetuated by his country!
“A little while, and I shall possess all
the happiness that is now but promised
me!” he said, in a transport of hope
and gratitude: “Oh Giovanni, how I
wish ” he stopt. “You wish me a
mistress as fair and as kind as your own
Is not that what you would have said?”
asked his friend, smiling; “but my heart

has not room for any thing besides my
friend.”
“Beware l’exclaimed Cesario; “Love
will have his revenge some day.”
“I won't defy him, but I do not fear
him,” was Giovanni's tranquil answer, as
they shook hands after a long discourse,
and parted in the porch of his vestibule.
Cesario chose the hour of matins, the
next day, for his visit to the Palazzo
Rosso. At that hour, he knew the Mar.
chesa would be at her devotions.
The suddenness of his appearance, his
ardour, his wound, his fresh laurels, nay,
even the confusion of her own con-
science, gave a more touching character
to the Signora's reception than it would
naturally have had.
When he talked of Giovanni, she
listened with attention, and replied with
animation; but when he would have
covered her fair hands with kisses, some-
thing of self-condemnation, and rather
more of altered sensibility, gave her an

air of modest resistance, which Cesario
had hitherto never allowed himself to
miss, but which, once there, transported
him to rapture.
He threw himself at her feet, pouring
out a torrent of wishes and entreaties.
It seemed to him, that he could no
longer live without permission to declare
to all the world that he lived but for her
alone, Deluded by his frantic passion,
he besought Beatrice to let him avow
their attachment to the Marchesa, and
beseech her to consent to their future
union, whenever the fortune of the war,
or the liberality of his country, should
reward his enterprises with the means of
honourable life.
Beatrice was too well acquainted with
her mother's sentiments, and too uncer-
tain of her own, to yield assent to this
proposal: not that she now dreaded the
consequence of a refusal for herself, but
she feared, that in Cesario's banishment
from the Palazzo Rosso, his friend would

be included, and her yet half-formed pro-
jects upon Giovanni's affections be de-
stroyed at once, -
Art is the offspring of fear and con-
scious unworthiness. Beatrice, without
foregone purpose, instantly assumed an
appearance of sympathy with her lover's
ardour, only to persuade him not to
risk, by a rash disclosure, the chance of
her mother's prohibition, and probable
removal of her from his reach.
She did not, it is true, advance many
good arguments against frankness of con-
duct; but she said so many playful
things; she hovered round him so like a
caressing breeze; she looked in such a
glow of love and youth and earnestness,
that Cesario yielded his integrity to the
charm, and believed that he ought not
to ask or wish for more.
. After this meeting, he rarely went to
the Palazzo Rosso unaccompanied by
Giovanni, whose silent observations upon

able to her.
Cesario was of a temper slow to im-
agine wrong from persons dear to him;
and he, therefore, saw in Beatrice’s an-
xiety to please Giovanni, merely the
conduct of one inclined to love every
thing beloved by the object of her prime
affection. -
Rendered uncomfortable by hermarked
attentions to himself (which had a subtle
something in them which distressed him,
the knew not why), Giovanni mean-while
seized an opportunity, which just then
presented itself, of leaving Italy. This
opportunity was afforded by a letter from
the Chevalier de Fronsac’s cousin, in-
viting Giovanni into Guienne, for the
purpose of renewing their attempts of as-
certaining the existence or death of their
separate relatives. *
Giovanni hoped some light might be
struck out by personal communication ;

and he trusted that during his absence,
if Beatrice's inconstancy were destined to
pierce his friend’s heart, it might find an-
other hand than his to throw the dart
with. -
Revolving how to leave some hint
of his doubts for Cesario to recal here-
after, when his own apprehensions might
require support from those of another,
he went with his friend to a supper at
Signor Calva's, the night before he was
to commence his journey to France.
Several other persons were added to
the family party, amongst whom were
the Marchesa Brignoletti and the Sig-
nora Beatrice.
Cards, conversation, and music filled
up the time. Beatrice did not assist at
these amusements; she was gay but by
fits; and Cesario's animated attention to
her alone, failed to drive away the cloud
of thought or melancholy, which dark-
ened her bright eyes.
He observed this with silent delight;
5


## p. 263 (#273) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST, JOHN. 263
for he flattered himself that it arose from
her apprehension of his being ordered
out to sea again, as a rumour in the
morning had suggested. -
After supper, the younger part of the
company went to enjoy the cool night-
air, in one of those artificial gardens with
which the Genoese ornament the broad
and flat roofs of their houses. -
Flowering shrubs formed slight divi-
sions between the different sets into
which their little society now broke.
Beatrice stood, leaning her blooming
cheek against the dark umbrage of some
cypress-trees, evidently absorbed by un-
pleasant thoughts, while she was uncon-
sciously tearing into fragments the flow-
ery band which confined her luxuriant
hair.
Strong expression gives elevation to
beauty; and for once, Cesario saw that
face of almost infantine sportiveness
assume the severer charm of painful
thought.


## p. 264 (#274) ############################################

264 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JoHN.
After calling Giovanni's notice to her
interesting figure, he drew near; whisper-
ing his own and his friend’s admiration.
That whisper restored its wonted ani-
mation to the face of Beatrice: it was the
first time she had been told that Gio-
vanni did admire her beauty; and her
pulse beat joyously at the idea. She
listened to her lover's raptures, as if she
fancied he spoke those of his friend also;
and thus beguiling, and self-beguiled, she
bent forward to his discourse with an air
of such perfect satisfaction, that Gio-
vanni, who now and then glanced at
them from a distance, knew not what to
think of her Proteus-like manners.
Nearly persuaded that he did exact
too much consistency from youth, he
joined her and his friend. “Why have
you not sung to-night?” he asked with
an air of kind interest; “I can forgive
your little caprices, when they do not rob
us of a pleasure.”
Beatrice gave him one of her most
w

brilliant smiles; not the less brilliant,
because the eyes she darted round at
him sparkled through tears. “I was
out of spirits — thinking all sorts of dis-
mal fancies.” She replied in her most
penetrating tone.
“I will not chide you for that,” re-
turned Giovanni, playfully. “I have
lectured you often on a very opposite
tendency.”
At that moment Cesario obeyed the
call of the Signora Calva; and Beatrice
was left by the side of Giovanni:—he
was about to leave her, when she said
precipitately, “So you go to-morrow !
I have been thinking of it all this evening.
Ah, Signor Cigala, what shall I do with-
out my monitor 2°
The touching accent in which this was
said, and the agitated air by which it was
accompanied, made Giovanni start; his
pulse beat not so temperately as before ;
but withdrawing his eyes from her glow
of beauty, he replied calmly, “I suspect,
VOL. I. N

266 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
there are no better monitors than our
own reflections, if we will but attend to
them.”
“No — no ſ” repeated Beatrice, ear-
nestly; “every thing right I have yet to
learn. You have shown me the impro-
priety of many things I do, which I never
dreamt were wrong; and which no one
else has had the precious sincerity to tell
me were so. — O, if I could be always
near you, I should never act foolishly.—
How long shall you stay away?—Oh,
do not stay long.”—She spoke with the
innocent passionateness of a child, and
she looked like an angel.
Giovanni had to remind himself that
she was neither a child nor an angel;
and that as an engaged woman, having
decorums and delicacies to observe, she
was strangely indiscreet. Yet this anxiety
for his return might indeed arise from a
wish to become more reasonable; and as
the friend of Cesario, she might, with per-
fect artlessness, believe herself privileged

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 267
to speak to him with lively regard. He
glanced anxiously on her, as he replied,
“I shall stay just long enough, I sup-
pose, to allow Adimari time to undo all
my work. When he will tell you, that
even your greatest faults are charms in
his eyes, there can be no hope that
my monkish admonitions will be either
regarded or remembered.”
Beatrice started, and trembled with
the agitation of sudden hope. To her
distempered fancy, those serious words
seemed the dictates of jealous love. She
forgot all reserve in that fancy; and
solely intent upon the object of unde-
ceiving him, if he could doubt her pre-
ference for him, she rashly exclaimed,
“I am tired of admiration that I know
I don't deserve; and I shall think of no-
thing but your admonitions.”
Giovanni's deep disorder made her ii.
stantly sensible of her indiscretion, and
his sentiments of it; and she blushed till
her very temples throbbed visibly.

Unable to raise her eyes, from which
tears now burst, she added, “You will
never see me gay and thoughtless again.—
I have mistaken gratitude, for I know
not what I — I have entangled myself in
a net of trouble and folly; and, I must
abide the consequence — misery P’
Giovanni, in extreme confusion, mut-
tered something about always wishing
her happiness and the consciousness of
deserving it; and hastily left her side.
He went, purposely, into the middle
of a little circle, where Signor Calva was
singing to his wife's lute; and appearing
to listen, he stood, in reality, thinking
over his strange conversation with Bea-
trice. -
In her last speech, it is true, she had
not mentioned Cesario, but the impres-
sion on Giovanni's mind, was that she
alluded to him. “ This net of trouble
and folly;” what could it mean, beside
her engagement with him? “This misery

-
that was to be the consequence;” what
was it, unless the bitterness of marrying
a man, she either ceased to love, or had
encouraged formerly from mingled gra-
titude and childish levity ? -
Giovanni had not a spark of vanity,
but he was not mentally blind; and, un-
less he had been so, it would have been
impossible for him to have put together
her words, and looks, and tones of voice,
without observing, that they made up a
most startling whole of flattery to him-
self. -
Whether coquetry, or liking, was the
source of this subtle wooing, it was
equally pernicious to him, and injurious
to Cesario; and he believed it his duty
to speak more explicitly of her now
to his friend, than he had intended to do
while fluctuating between suspicion of
her fickleness and reliance upon her
candour. - -
Giovanni was to quit Genoa the next
day; that night, therefore, was his only

opportunity: he must imbitter its sacred
farewell, by urging doubts that must
shock, perhaps irritate Cesario: that
night, he must begin to put Cesario's
friendship to the test by opposing it to
his love : that might, he must leave a
sting in the heart dearest to him, either
by troubling Cesario's affection for him-
self, or his devotedness to Beatrice

determined upon the act. -->
He now joined the party of gentlemen
who, with customary gallantry, preceded
the Marchesa's carriage, with their torch-
bearers, to the Palazzo Rosso ; then se-
parating from them, Giovanni accom-
panied Cesario home.
. On reaching the Syndic's, they sat
down together in the single but large
window of Cesario's apartment; there
they conversed with “unlocked breasts.”
The window was open; but it looked
only upon an extensive orchard, where

every thing was so still, that even the
ripe fig was heard as it fell from the
loaded boughs upon the soft turf below:
they were therefore fearless of listeners.
They talked of Giovanni's intended
journey; and, of course, of its purpose.
Giovanni lamented his sister’s uncertain
fate, and early imprudence, with unusual
vehemence; striving, while he described
the distress a clandestine marriage had
caused in his family, to guard Cesario
against the temptation of producing equal
confusion in that of the Marchesa..
“And if you are made certain that
your sister is no more; or, if none of
your endeavours can discover her abso-
lute fate; — what will you do?” -
“ Return hither, and live a solitary
life; but as happy a one, as freedom and
friendship can make it.”
“Good. Heaven and you determine
not to marry 2” exclaimed Cesario.
“I make no such determination:”
replied his friend, smiling; “but I have

no wish to marry; and I think it is an
event very unlikely to happen.”
“You think you shall not find a woman
capable of making you happy?” asked
Cesario. -
“ I do indeed.” -
“O, that I could find you another
Beatrice ’’. -
Giovanni only smiled, and shook his
head.
Cesario considered him with surprise.
“What! would not such kove, and such
beauty, as hers, content you?”
“I am, in truth, not so soon satisfied
as you are,” said Giovanni, with appre-
hensive kindness.
Again Cesario was a moment silent
with surprise. “What is it that does not
satisfy you in Beatrice 2 her affection for
me? or her character P’’
“ Her character, principally.”
“Good Heaven P’ again repeated Ce-
sario; “this is extraordinary ! and what
are your objections to her ?”

habits.” - * * *
Cesario could not easily comprehend
the nature of this accusation; and he
urged a more distinct explanation of it.
Giovanni then gently, but firmly,
showed him how entirely the days of
Beatrice were wasted in mere amuse-
ments, without reference to a single ob-
ject, either beneficial to herself, or to
others. Cesario reluctantly confessed

this, but added, “she is so young.”—
“Well, then, I would not marry one so
very young,” replied Giovanni, some-
what playfully.
Cesario pressed him further; and Gio-
vanni was obliged to confess, that the
unceasing brilliancy of Beatrice's spirits
frightened him: he could never convince
himself that such a constant glow of
hilarity could be united with depth of
feeling.—Then her caprice in dress, and
favourites, and pleasures, made him fear,
she might not be very steady in more
serious things.
In short, it was instability of charac-
ter which appeared to him the secret of
all her fascination and all her faults.
Cesario’s rising resentment was quelled
by his friend’s liberal confession of Bea-
trice's witchery; he therefore answered
his different objections with less heat than
Giovanni had prepared himself to expect.
Cesario admitted her agreeable caprice
in trifles, her thoughtless squandering of

time, herbuoyant resistance against every
sorrow ; but he attributed these to a
different source from that on which Gio-
vanni charged them.
In her lover's opinion, her caprices
were, singly, pretty affectations assumed
to amuse others; ſher waste of time, the
effect of innocence and inexperience,
which had only to learn the severer du-
ties of life, to practise them with ear-
nestness; her cloudless gaiety, the wish
of diffusing happiness, joined to that
vernal spirit of hope, which is woman’s
best attribute.
“It may be so, my dear Cesario,” said
Giovanni, stifling a sigh; “and I should
rejoice to read my recantation to you;-
when she is your wife.” -
“And will that answer all these
doubts?” asked Cesario, thrilling at the
idea. J L -
“Certainly,” “returned his friend ;
“ time will then have proved her con-
stancy; and, with her constancy, proved

her depth of feeling; and, where there
is deep feeling in an innocent breast,
there is a principle that will redeem lost
time, and repair error.” -
Cesario embraced him: “There spoke
my kind Giovanni again; I scarcely
knew his voice, when it uttered such
harsh sentiments.”
Cesario's eyes were moistened with
tenderness; Giovanni's were full of con-
cern, and even greater tenderness.
“A friend's hardest office is some-
times that of speaking truth:” he said,
grasping Cesario's agitated hand; “and
you may believe, I perform it unwil.

warn another of a probable danger;
ought he not to show him, how to avoid
misery, and secure peace? I am suspi-
cious of Beatrice's steadiness; you are
not; and if she were to fail you, and the
unforeseen shock deprive you of reason,

remember that my warning might, at
least, have prepared 22 -
“ Kill me not now with this horrid
image P’ interrupted Cesario, starting
from him, yet not in anger. “O Gio-
vanni, one miserable event has mixed
poison with this noble heart’s stream;
which else had flowed all pure and
healthy. You have been deceived; and
you suspect all the sex Is this just –
is this reasonable P” -
Giovanni could have said, he did not
suspect all the sex; that there were
some he valued highly ; and one, (his
hapless sister,) whom he could still love
most fondly; but he forbore to press
further upon the feelings of Cesario;
and, suffocating a sigh, he replied, “I
may be wrong; I hope, and wish I may.
Yet let me entreat you, for the dignity
of your nature, for the sake of your
future security in an indissoluble engage-
ment, do a little violence to this honour-
able romance of love; and imagine the

possibility of Beatrice being less than
perfect. Study her closer; watch her
conduct to others; see if she always
satisfies you. Reflect upon the many
emotions in which you may find that she
does not sympathise with any of your
strong sensibilities, unconnected with
herself: then go back to your own heart,
and ask it, if such a companion, in weal
and woe, in youth and age, for time and
for eternity, would leave it nothing to
desire.” -
Giovanni stopped. Cesario did not
reply; his heart was full ; and his eyes
were on the point of overflowing. He
saw the spire of San Siro at a distance;
and that object reminded him with what
profound emotion he had led Beatrice to
his father’s monument there; and what
a chill struck to his soul, when he saw
her cheek tearless. º
He was silent a long, long time: how
many racking ideas were then torturing
him! At length throwing himself into

reproach, “Giovanni, what friendship
is this 2° and he concealed his face.
“Judge what friendship,” cried Gio-
vanni in as penetrating a tone, “when it
gives me strength to risk even the loss
of that affection I had such a conflict
to gain l’” - -
Both were again silent; and perhaps
both shed tears. Cesario first roused
himself; and took Giovanni’s hand : he
pressed it affectionately. “You were
born to subdue me—and I yield wil-
lingly to our stars. But urge not your
power too far, my Giovanni; force me
not to see, what I would rather not see—
what I should never have looked at,
had you not directed my eyes that way.
'Tis true, Beatrice wants general sen-
sibility; but how lively and fervent is
her attachment to me! Well, then, she
can feel strongly. Perhaps that sensibi-
lity, hitherto unexercised, will strengthen

estedly, is surely capable of other ge-
nerous affections?” º
“Say steadily, my Cesario,” said
Giovanni.
“And has she not been steady ?”
enquired the astonished lover. “Five
months since, this precious ring pledged
her heart to mine; that heart, sought by
all the brave and noble throughout
Italy.”
“I will not pursue this painful sub-.
ject,” said Giovanni, purposely avoiding
a direct answer to his friend’s question.
“If I have already grieved you deeply
by my over-anxious friendship, place
that offence among “ the godly sins:”
doubt my judgment, suspect my preju-
dice, blame my intemperate zeal; do
any thing but think me wilfully un-
kind.”
“But what would you wish Beatrice
to do, that she does not do, to testify her
purpose to be mine,” enquired the rest.

described it formerly.” Cesario was on
the point of vehemently rebutting this
assertion, when some disagreeable recol-
lections crossed him. He remembered,
that she had seldom found opportunities
of conversing with him alone of late;
and that once or twice, when he had
gathered a bouquet for her, she had care-
lessly left it on a garden-seat, or suffered
it to fall from her breast unheeded,
There was a time, when she had preserva
ed even the fragment of a flower, simply
touched by him He turned pale, and
cast down his eyes.
Giovanni read the disturbance of his
mind in his countenance; and assured,
that his distressing task was fulfilled,
sought to end the conversation. But
Cesario either did not hear, or would
not answer what he said on less interest-
ing things; he remained looking gloomily
on the ground, evidently revolving some
newly conceived thought. Abruptly
raising his head, he said in a determined
voice — -

“I will be satisfied, and you shall be
convinced. I will absent myself from
the Palazzo Rosso; and from every
place, where there is a chance of meet-
ing her; you shall see, that her love will
break through common forms to learn
the cause of this. Oh yes! her fond
heart will rather afflict itself with the
idea of some accident having befallen
me, than suspect me of change.”
The gloom of Cesario's countenance
melted away as he spoke, and Giovanni
saw that reason was indeed no match for
passion. “If time and trial should
prove her all I wish her to prove,” he
said, “will you pardon me for raising
these painful doubts? but, Cesario, could
you see into my heart —”
“I should see all that earth has of
goodness, kindness, and unheard of
friendship !” interrupted Cesario, open-
ing his arms to him, with his generous
soul in his eyes.
Giovanni pressed him strongly against

emotion; then releasing him, with a

him farewell. -

CHAPTER XIV.
What were the meditations and occu.
pations of Giovanni during his journey?
Far from entertaining a feeling in
unison with those of the light-minded
Beatrice, he was solely intent upon the
best interests of his friend.
This journey had a two-fold object:
one was to visit the family of De Fron-
sac; the other, to serve Cesario.
Some years back, the late Signor Adi-
mari had advanced a large sum of money
to a young adventurer, called Lanza,
who was going to try his fortune in the
newly-discovered countries beyond the
Atlantic.
Several vicissitudes had prevented this
person from repaying the important loan,

286 THE KNIGHT of ST. JoHN.
-
while he was abroad: but on returning
to Europe, (his own moderate fortune
augmented by the unexpected legacy
of a rich partner’s property,) during
his voyage homeward he had spoken
openly of his debt, and expressed his
intention of gratefully repaying it.
Lanza unfortunately died on his pas-
sage, and his wealth went into the hands
of a distant relation. But, as Signor
Michaeli, his heir, was a man of respect-
able character, though no bond had
ever been taken by the elder Adimari,
it was possible that Michaeli might be
induced to discharge the debt.
Accident having thrown Giovanni into
the society of a gentleman who had come
passenger in the same vessel with Lanza,
he learned these circumstances, together
with the name and residence of Signor
Michaeli ; and it immediately struck
him, that this gentleman’s testimony,
with that of one or two others (not dif-
ficult to find out), would oblige Michaeli
I2.


## p. 287 (#297) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 287
to admit that such a sum of money was
due to the heir of Signor Adimari,
and consequently lead him to do an act
of justice. The law, indeed, could not
extort it, but honour and generosity have
their own code. :
Signor Michaeli was now at the head
of a mercantile concern at Marseilles :
thither Giovanni meant to seek him,
concealing the circumstance from his
friend, lest he should either excite ex-
pectations which might not be realised,
or be stayed by his scrupulous delicacy.
An invitation from the Marquis de
Blanchefort, happily arriving at that pe-
riod, afforded Giovanni a pretext for a
journey into France; yet hopeless of hear-
ing anything new of his sister, he first
directed his steps to Marseilles.
On reaching that city, Giovanni found,
in Signor Michaeli, a man of habitual
caution and extreme prudence; and, for
a while, the minuteness of the latter's
investigation, his numerous doubts, his

cool balancing between what was likely,
and what merely possible, made him
abandon all hope of success; but the
event proved that Signor Michaeli scru-
tanised but to attain conviction; and
that, once satisfied of his kinsman’s obli-
gation to Signor Adimari, he was ready
to repay the whole charge. “My re-
lative’s affairs are not settled,” he said:
“I know not yet the extent of those
| claims upon his property which legal
forms can compel us to satisfy: they of
course would come in first ; but as
soon as I am able to balance the debts
and the property, Signor Cigala shall
hear from me. I do not doubt, how-
ever, that there will be enough and to
spare. Your friend, in that case, may
depend upon principal and interest.”
Giovanni disclaimed the latter in his
friend's name. “It is his right,” returned
Michaeli calmly, “no gift: 'tis in the
course of business; and there can be no
obligation in the affair.”
II


## p. 289 (#299) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. ’289
Michaeli then took down the names of
the persons to whom his kinsman had
spoken of his intention to repay Signor
Adimari; and, expressing an expectation
of finding some memorandum of the
business amongst the papers of the de-
ceased, he bade his visitor good morn-
ing.
Animated by this prospect of recover.
ing what was now of such importance
to Cesario, Giovanni “went on his way
rejoicing;” for he no longer dreaded, as
formerly, repulse for every kindness;
and though he hoped no satisfaction to
himself from his visit to Sauveterre, he
felt that, in making it, he should have
completed his duty to his imprudent
sister. - -
Something like melancholy, however,
did await him at Sauveterre. The Mar-
quis de Blanchefort (his brother-in-law’s
successor) had found out a person who
was at Ostia in the year 1564, and who
perfectly remembered being casually on

board a vessel in the harbour, when a
French gentleman of the name of DeFron-
sac was settling with the captain for a
passage to Venice for himself and family.
. This person knew that the vessel
foundered at sea, shortly afterwards; so
that it was now almost certain that
De Fronsac and his hapless wife had
perished in her.
Giovanni did not hear this dismal
confirmation of his worst imaginations
without sorrow; indeed, he paid a heavy
tribute of tears, in secret, to the memory
of this unfortunate sister.
There is something more than com-
monly sad in death, when it comes un-
expectedly, and arrests the young on the
very threshold of life! When Madame
De Fronsac perished by this most miser-
able of deaths, she could hardly have
reached her sixteenth year. So young,
so beautiful, so amiable as she promised
to be, Giovanni could have mourned
long and deeply, had he not drawn ar-

guments for resignation from the details
of her husband's character, as communi-
cated to him by the Marquis de Blanche-
fort. . . .
Handsome, engaging, skilled in paint-
ing and music, and highly susceptible of
the charms of beauty, De Fronsac was
unhappily but too much adapted to,
dazzle the imagination, if not win the
affections of an inexperienced girl: but
though free from turbulent passions or
degrading views, he was not of a cha-
racter to increase domestic happiness.
A restless disposition, which made in-
cessant change of place necessary to his
very existence, disjointed the comforts
of every individual connected with him,
and by degrees wearied out their regard.
Thus, in despite of his relations’ re-
monstrances and friends’ admonitions,
he persisted to waste life in travelling,
without purpose or benefit, insensible to
the claims of a numerous tenantry, and

carrying into responsible manhood the
habits of unimportant youth.
During one of his wandering excur-
sions in the neighbourhood of Monaco,
he saw the Signora Cigala at a convent, of
which an aunt of his was Superior. He
had never been in the custom of foresee-
ing consequences, or, in fact, of caring
for them. He found she was going to
marry, against her will, a person no-
- toriously disagreeable; and he knew that
if she married any other, her father
would disclaim her: but inclination was
uncontrollable with De Fronsac ; and he
played so ably upon the two passions of
hope and fear, in the artless breast of
fourteen, that he persuaded her to elope •
with him. -
The imprudent couple received the
nuptial benediction from a mercenary
priest, not over curious as to the pro-
priety of their union ; after which
De Fronsac hastened, with a lover’s

pride, to display his fair bride to his
mother and kindred.
“I saw your sister at that time,” said
the Marquis de Blanchefort (as walking
in the garden he gave Giovanni this rela-
tion); “and I have never forgotten her—
I shall never forgether! Not one of these
flowers about us is half so lovely; she was
so delicate, so fair, so young —the first
tender bloom of childhood was still on
her cheek. How little did I think that
beautiful form was destined to feed—”
De Blanchefort stopped, and apolo-
gised for his indiseretion, when he saw
the sudden paleness of Giovanni; the
latter bowed his head, smiled kindly, but
spoke not ; a shudder passed over him—
a momentary struggle was visible in all
his features—it was but momentary-
he recovered himself; and the Marquis
then spoke of other things. -
After this conversation, when Gio-
vanni could think of his sister’s fate with
steadiness, he scarcely wished her again

in life: for, tied to a man of De Fronsac's
unsettled temper, she must either have
grown into unhappiness with him, by
vainly endeavouring to exalt his existence
into usefulness, or her own character
must have sunk to the same worthless
habits of self-indulgence which distin-
guished his.
Thus, Giovanni still adhered to his
original conviction, that all is for the best;
and that if we wish to think so, we shall
find that truth made manifest, even, in
this world.
The subject on which the Marquis
de Blanchefort wished for advice was
about a change of property which he
wished to make, but would not do, be-
fore he had asked the opinion of Ma-
dame de Fronsac’s brother. It was
possible that Madame de Fronsac had
borne a child (her pregnancy having
been mentioned in one of the Chevalier’s
letters): it was barely possible, there-
fore, that this child might not have been

the companion of their voyage, and
might, at a future day, appear to claim
his estates. The Marquis, therefore,
would not, without the sanction of that
child’s maternal uncle, stir a step in the
business proposed.
Giovanni speedily quieted his respect-
able scruples, promising to take all re-
sponsibility upon himself. After this
he paid a visit to the old Madame de
Fronsac, now dedicated to heaven in a
convent of Ursalines; and, having thus
completed his business in France, he
turned his face once more towards Italy.

CHAPTER XV.
A few days subsequent to his depart-
ure from Sauveterre, having secured
himself a night's shelter in an abbey on
the confines of the province, Giovanni
rambled out alone, to enjoy the stillness
and freshness of evening. -
Where increase of population has
since converted the wilds of nature into
meadows and cornfields, there spread
then, deep forests and lonely morasses;
and the towns which now glitter on the
verdant shores of the Aveiron were then
but scattered and distant hamlets.
It was the season of the vintage : and
as Giovanni took his contemplative way,
occasionally through more frequented
- paths than those of the tangled woods,
s

he met parties of country people return-
ing home to the neighbouring village.
Their hats, garlanded with vine-branches,
and their baskets teeming with the grapes
themselves, gave a sort of Arcadian
grace to their figures.
Giovanni loitered at times to return
a courteous answer to their frank offers
of fruit; and to admire the sparkling
looks and animated movements of the
girls, as they went on, coquetting and
carolling with their sweethearts.
The setting-sun played on many a
crimson cheek, which its hot ray em-
browned with richer beauty; and many
a bright dark eye, as it passed, darted
a roguish glance at the handsome
stranger.
The joyous groupes, now advancing
towards him, now disappearing among
the shaded cross-roads, gave life and in-
terest to the charms of inanimate nature.
Birds warbling their hymn of gladness
from each surrounding copse, (where

every leaf sparkled with rain-drops
just scattered from a passing cloud;) the
delightful smell of mingled fruits and
blossoms and wild flowers, rising like
the earth’s incense to her Creator; the
sight of that beauteous earth, and those
splendid heavens, were to Giovanni's
heart so many calls to prayer and praise;
and with devotional rapture he stood in
that august temple, silently worshipping
the one Great Cause. - . . .
His secret transport over, with feelings
softened, not changed, he turned from
the public path, and, striking down a
wooded declivity, entered a savage dell
darkened by old chesnut-trees, and echo-
ing to the rush of a river.
The brilliancy of sun-set brightening
even this dismal solitude gave a charm
to that deep mass of umbrage by which
it was almost choked up ; and, illumi-
nating the river for an instant, as it
appeared through a chasm in its steep
banks, discovered the cause of that sullen

din, which sounded in the ear of inspi-
ration, like the accents of its troubled
deity.
Giovanni made his way leisurely
through the rank bushes to the margin
of the water; and, as he emerged, came
suddenly upon a man sitting there alone.
The man stirred not, for he heard not:
his head was supported by both hands,
resting on his knees, and his eyes were
fixed upon the swift tide. Giovanni
paused to observe whether he was in
distress, or might be dangerous.
He saw a figure scarcely human,
scarcely proportioned; a countenance
livid, yet swollen ; features, where dis-
ease, and deformity, and weariness of life
were mixed with expressions of the most
affecting and the most revolting kind.
In the pale, deep-sunken eye was
thirst of vengeance, hatred, and fierce
impatience, mixed with grief, and tender-
ness, and the sad consciousness of power-
less will. Now and then the poor wretch

muttered to himself, accompanying his
mutterings by some violent gesture of
‘the hands or head; but still he moved
not away; and Giovanni fancied that
amidst low threatenings and curses, he
could distinguish lamentation and prayer.
He drew near then. His steps brush-
ing the long damp grass, made the man
start. At sight of one beside him,
he rose, and would have fled; but Gio-
vanni gently seized his coarse garment,
and bade him stay.
“You touch me!—what!—I may be
touched, then º’ exclaimed the maniac,
or miserable, with a laugh which froze
Giovanni’s blood, and made him loose
his hold.
Thus released, the man broke from
him; and running fast, but feebly, gained
a broken ascent at a short distance : the
next moment he vanished, as it were,
into the ground.
Giovanni stood to shake off the su-
perstitious seizure of an instant; then,

ashamed of his folly, hastened after the
human spectre.
The spot where it seemed to vanish
was only one of those natural grottoes.
which are often found in the sides of
hills, and are as often turned into habita-
tions by shepherds and might-wanderers:
some wild cherry-bushes masked, without
securing, the wide entrance. Stooping
under its rocky porch, Giovanni, found
himself in a mere mountain hollow, con-
taining no better useful furniture than
a bed of heath, and no other inhabitant
than the creature he had followed.
At the extremity, however, the chalky
side of the hollow was scooped into a
sort of altar, on which stood a wooden
crucifix rudely carved: a circle of some
prickly briar surmounted it. -
This faithful imitation of the crown
of thorns, and the feelings it indicated,
redeemed, in Giovanni's estimation, the
gaudy heap of coloured glass and spars .
and peacock feathers which furnished a

-
garniture for this humble shrine: he saw
in the latter only that childish love of
glitter which is common to all ignorant
persons; while in the former he read the
sentiment of a devout spirit. The presence
of the sacred symbol guaranteed his
personal safety; and at the same time
reminded him that even the miserable
object by his side, was his brother in
faith. Silently crossing himself, he ap-
proached the forester.
“What do you want here?” asked the
latter, in a sullen tone, averting eyes
inflamed with weeping.
“A shelter—rest for a while, if you
will give them me,” returned Giovanni,
hoping to detain the miserable, by this
demand on his hospitality.
“ Take them, then,” answered the
man, going out of the grotto. He then
seated himself at a distance, in his former
attitude of stern wretchedness.
Giovanni again followed. Without
approaching too close, and, regarding

him kindly, he said, “Something affects
you, my poor friend; may a stranger
offer you help ?” -
The man neither stirred nor answered.
Giovanni repeated his questions in a
soothing voice, adding some expressions
still more soothing. The solitary then
raised his head, looked wildly, piteously,
as if discrediting the sense that would
have persuaded him he heard the voice
of benevolence : then exclaiming, “Au-
gustel” burst into a terrifying passion of
tears.
Giovanni now saw grief in its stormiest
character; for it was grief, evidently
combined with rage and impotent desire
of vengeance. The unhappy man dashed
himself against the ground, tearing up
the grass as he lay there, struggling be-
tween cries and imprecations.
“Alas, poor fellow !” said Giovanni,
drawing close to him, as he saw his vio-
lence exhausting him; “you are, doubt-
less, in extreme sorrow; and it seems

that you have no one to comfort you:
where is your home?—let me lead you
to it.” -
“That is my home,” replied the soli-
tary, pointing to the mountain-hollow.
“And what are you, then?”
“A Cahet.” The man pronounced
that ignominious name with a mixture
of shame and defiance.
Giovanni was far beyond the character
of the times he lived in ; and he shrunk
not from a term which stigmatised the
unhappy wretch before him as one of an
accursed and avoided race.
“What, then?” he said; “you are a
man—all men are brethren: you seem
a Christian—Christians are more than
brethren. Come, then ; tell me your
distresses freely, and let me see if I can
relieve you.”
O spark of the Divine essence, soul

moment over all that disease has of

squalid, and deformity, of revolting! The
Cahet's livid and gloomy face shone with
light; tears (no longer withering tears)
poured in abundance down his cheeks:
he ran, he sprang, he cast himself at the
feet of Giovanni; he seized his garments,
rather devouring than kissing them, as
he cried in broken accents, “ O, do I
indeed hear words of kindness again!”
Giovanni raised him; and, regarding
him with an expression of the most bene-
volent pity, he said, “Let us re-enter
your cave. No one will disturb us there
—and you shall tell me what I can do
to help you.”
“No one can help me now!—Auguste
is dead!” exclaimed the Cahet, and fresh
tears rained from his hollow eyes.
“Then you shall talk to me of this
Auguste,” replied Giovanni, gently
urging him forward; if you have no one
else to lament him with, I will grieve
with you.” "
Again the Cahet grasped the hem

of Giovanni's cloak, and glued his lips
to it.
They entered the mountain-hollow to-
gether. When they had severally seated
themselves, Giovanni considered the poor
object before him with greater attention
and with the liveliest interest.
In him he saw, for the first time, one
of that mysterious race whom some un-
known calamity has scattered throughout
France, and degraded from their rank
and rights of men: a race which were
numerous in the first and middle ages,
but of which only a miserable remnant
now remains to perpetuate the injustice
of former centuries.
This proscribed race, known under
various opprobrious titles in different
provinces, have been alternatively sup-
posed the descendants of the conquered
Alans, of the Saracens, of the Visigoths:
nay, some writers have tried to find the
origin of their disgrace in hereditary
leprosy.

In that chaos of nations and events
which renders the history of the first ages
but a wilderness of imaginations, nothing
satisfactory can be discovered respecting
their origin. We see only the frightful.
facts of their being sold and transferred
as slaves with the land on which they
dwelt; of intermixture with them being
considered an act of iniquity; of their
banishment from the rites of sepulture
and sacrament; of their being allowed
only the exercise of those employments
which would keep them aloof from towns,
and other society than their own.
Marked with disease, (perhaps the con-
sequence of scanty food, hopeless toil,
and continued intermixture with their
own cast,) this unhappy race form, even
now, as distinct a people, but, thank
God, a far less numerous people, than the
gipseys. -
But bound to the soil on which they
are born ; not free, like them, to rove at
will; they are doomed to endure the

same injuries from the same oppressors,
in age as in youth; and thus they ac-
quire habits of unresisting endurance.
Objects of horror and aversion to every
other class of men, even two centuries
back, they could not question the justice
of their fate; because they were then
as ignorant of its cause in remote anti-
quity, as they were who oppressed them :
still they felt its weight, groaned, and
submitted.
Giovanni had often pondered over the
possible source of this furious antipathy,
which still remained in all its strength,
when every trace of what might explain
(for nothing could justify it), was swept
from record and tradition. Rejecting
every other opinion, he believed, with
some acute writers, that in the heresy of
the Arian Visigoths lay the solution of
the difficulty. Once tainted with that
abhorred schism, the whole race would
be pronounced excommunicate, and shun-
ned accordingly.

This hypothesis certainly wanted com-
pleteness; as it did not account for the
gradual change which must afterwards
have taken place in their creed; the Ca-
hets professing pure Catholicism : —and
how was that change to have been ef.
fected, seeing they were denied not only
intermixture by marriage with more or-
thodox Christians, but refused admittance
into their society?
Giovanni, however, passed lightly over
the objection; willing to gild a wretched
and despised race, with the long-set glo-
ries of the warlike Goths.
He now contemplated, as he thought,
one of their descendants in the person
of a timid slave; and, marvelling at those
great reverses of fortune, which distin-
guish nations as much as individuals, he
drew from his pallid companion the little
history of his life.
It was a life of uniform dreariness;
with much in it to corrode the sufferer’s
heart, but little to mark a narrative.

by every other human being, he followed
his monotonous task of wood-cutting

himself up from the wolves and the snows

On Saints-days he stole into some
neighbouring church at a side-entrance
set apart for his unhappy cast; and there,
while he listened to the awful service,
feared to join his prayer or his praise,
with any of the crowd that shuddered
if his garments did but touch them in
passing.
He now described his return from those
pious exercises with a pathetic force
which pierced Giovanni's heart. The
mysterious horror with which he con-
sidered himself; the trembling awe with

which he regarded all that multitude of
persons so different from him in appear-
ance and in destiny; and that continued
sensation of misery, which he painted as
having supplied in him the place of
thought; — all these were so many af.
fecting proofs, how easy it is to crush
the human spirit under a load of injustice
and superstition. .
Education had not taught Rodolphe
to reflect; nature, however, made him
feel. — He questioned not the justice of
whatever laws condemned him, in com-
mon with other Cahets, to ignominy and
wretchedness; but submitting to his fate,
as to necessity, he never knew complaint,
till he had enjoyed and lost comfort.
An accidental circumstance had first
eaused a glimmering light to shine on his
mental gloom.
While cutting wood in the dell one
autumnal day, a boy six years old, who
had strayed from his foster-mother's cot-
tage, came to play there. Pleased with

the child’s beauty and gaiety, the poor
Cahet suspended his labour to watch him
sporting among the rushes. While clam-
bering after a butterfly, the boy fell into
the river that ran below — Rodolphe
jumped in after him, seized, and saved
him.
Having borne him in his arms to the
hamlet from which he had strayed,
though Auguste's nurse received him as
if from the hands of a demon; Rodolphe
afterwards haunted the spot every morn-
ing and evening, till he saw the little
prattler again. Gratitude on the one
side, and on the other the love of that we
have served, were too powerful for re-
straint: Rodolphe could imitate every
bird in the forest; and he gathered ber-
ries and blossoms, and laid them where
Auguste found them. Thus administering
to the gentle child’s pleasures, his image
could not be coupled in his mind with
ideas of dread and disgust.
When, at last, the furious prejudices

of the villagers drove Rodolphe from
their door, Auguste learned to steal away
alone to the wood-cutter's cave; and
then his pretty arts beguiled the mo-
ments, and “made a sun-shine in that
shady place.”
This intercourse continued without in-
termission for two years, during which
time, the child became the man’s in-
structor; and having taught him to feel,
he soon taught him to think. Rodolphe
well remembered the change that was
wrought in him.
“ Before I knew Auguste,” he said,
“I used to sit here alone, day after day—
dark winter-days, long winter-nights —
doing nothing but feeding my fire with
fallen wood. Once I used to think
about my family that were dead – but
that was just after they died : years
passed, and I forgot to think; and then
I used to feel as if I lived in my grave.
Something thick, and dark, and heavy,
was always before my eyes – or in my

where it was—what it was—for I thought
of no one that had ever lived; nor of any
thing that had ever been. — O, those
were horrid days I’’ .
The pallid face of the Cahet took a
more deadly hue as he spoke. After a
suffocating pause he resumed: —
“ Auguste changed all that. From
the moment I had him first in my arms,
I felt that every thing was altered: for
even then, he put his soft, red cheek
against mine; — he breathed gently on
my lips, because they were livid blue, and
he thought I must be cold — and he pro-
mised to love me dearly all his life — he
did not know I was a Cahet! Ah well!
he knew it afterwards; but he loved me
still ; and no one could keep him from
me. He would come to me in the
wood, and sing me pretty songs, and
tell me pretty tales, and stick flowers in
my hair, and stroke my rough hands with
his delicate ones. O Auguste Auguste

breathing more never! never!”
The Cahet now sobbed aloud; and his:
voice, quite subdued by grief, was no
longer audible, :
“You lament a child thus?” repeated.
Giovanni, his own eyes dim with oppres--
sive sympathy. The Cahet bowed his
head in expressive silence, at length re-
suming, he said, - -
“Auguste was a little child, when first
we met; but he grew so tall, and so sen-
sible, in two years | He could read, and
make letters upon vellum, like a book;
and he taught me to read; he used to steal,
his books out, and help me to read them:
so after that, Inever felt dark and heavy in
this cave; for I could sit by my fire, and
repeat them word for word; and think
over all my pretty Auguste had said or
done. —O how I was ‘happy! and he
taught me that word—I had never heard
it, till he said it to me.”

“Nor ever felt it !” said Giovanni, in-
wardly sighing at the thought.
“But a Cahet is not born to be happy,”
resumed Rodolphe . “Auguste fell sick,
and I did not know it. I watched for
him in the woods, by the river, in all the
pathways; I ventured to go near his
nurse’s house ; still I saw him not. At
last she told me that he was taken home
to his father's in the town, and that he
was dying. Did I not run there? Did
I not beg them, on my knees, to let me see
him only once again P If they would have
told him—if they would have brought
me but a message from him . At last
they told me he was dead; they drove
me away with stones and frightful words;
they cursed me for loving Auguste ; they
said his death was a judgment, because
he had loved me; they told me his inno-
cent soul would suffer for my sake, and
they mocked my 'agony.”
A ghastly smile gleamed over the fea-
tures of the Cahet, and his lips moved

wildly for a while, though not articu-
lately. At length he smote his breast,
and with a thrilling cry exclaimed,
“O! if this arm had power!—if I
might ease the dreadful pain that’s gnaw-
ing here! The pangs of thirst, of hunger,
of dreary loneliness, are not half so
strong. Might I be revenged!”
Rodolphe trembled with the hideous
passions that now engrossed him : rage
and hatred glared in his fixed eye; he
shook his clenched hand, as if threaten-
ing some unseen object, while a horrid
groan convulsed his bosom.
At first Giovanni soothed him; then
proceeded to explain the sinfulness of
revenge, and the loveliness of returning
evil with good.
He reminded Rodolphe that those
persons who were most cruel to him, were
related to the object he loved so dearly,
therefore should be considered sacred on
that account; that perhaps their injuri-
ous treatment was rather the effect of a

grief more ungovernable than his own,
and that aggravated by superstition, than
the result of deliberate cruelty.
He then urged him to reflect that, ac-
cording to the religion they both pro-
fessed, he would more surely and worthily
manifest his fondness for Auguste, by
joining in the customary prayers for his
soul, than by committing acts of vio-
lence, upon his kindred.
As he enforced this, Giovanni laid
aside his hat and cloak, inviting Ro-
dolphe to assist him in repeating the of.
fices for the dead.
Kneeling down before the cross on the
rude and almost grotesque altar, he re-
cited in a solemn voice, the service to
which he invited the Cahet. The un-
'fortunate then sunk in silence beside
him : by degrees his countenance lost
its wildness, his movements their convul-
sive quickness, and his fast-streaming
tears announced the melting of his heart.
Never did Giovanni pray more fer-

Vently. In the august chapel of the
Knights of St. John, surrounded by a
multitude of kindred spirits, and by all
the pomp and circumstance of cere-
monial worship, he had felt his soul
transported with holy rapture : in the
church of the Annonciata, during the
masses that were said over his father's
body, he had felt that soul awe-struck,
and anxious and earnest in its ad-
dresses to the Judge of men and an-
gels; but never had he felt in such im-
mediate communion with his Creator as
now, when lifting up his heart and voice
to him, in a lonely desert, by the side of
a forlorn and sorrowful slave. ~ ,
Their devotions ended, Giovanni and
Rodolphe arose: the latter was still
bathed in tears, increasing tears; but
they distilled in kindly showers, as if they
relieved his heart of all that weighed
upon its better purposes.

kissed it, and held it against his heaving

side; while Giovanni, with the gracious
look of a heavenly messenger, continued
to fortify him in patient submission, and
to describe that ineffable bliss which must
be the portion of a soul unspotted by
the world. -
His arguments had less effect than his
description of Auguste's beatitude: so
little power has reason over sensibility,
strongly roused; and so necessary is it
to combat one passion by another.
In conformity with the precepts of
their religion, Giovanni taught him, that
there yet remained a means by which he
could testify his love to the innocent
child, now no more; and in teaching
him this, he opened to him a source of
enjoyment, and he animated him into
action.
Even that innocent soul would not, he
said, be deemed free from the imputed
guilt of our first father; and for it,
therefore, the mass might be performed,

and the secret prayer offered, with blessed
effect.
Thus soothed, thus led to stem his
own faulty impulses, for the sake of the
soul he lamented, Rodolphe, for the first
time in his life, made an effort which had
self-control for its object. Oh, sorrow,
what a teacher art thou! -
Giovanni marked, and commended his
struggles; and, promising to see him ere
he departed the next day, bade him a
kindly farewell. -
As he slowly took his way homewards
to the convent where he was to sleep,
the past scene engrossed all his faculties;
nothing outward, indeed, pressed upon
his attention: for, as if respecting his me-
ditations, nature had veiled herself in a
mist; and, as he passed along, the mea-
dows and valleys, covered with its white
billows, presented no object to call forth.

Giovanni recollected the gay groups

hours before; and, contrasting them with
the wretched wood-cutter, he sighed over
their disproportionate destinies.
Comected with that poor wretch's
image, the happiness of these people ap-
peared monstrous; it seemed the hilarity
of heartless selfishness: for were not these
the villagers who drove the Cahet from
their doors, and would have excluded
him, if possible, from their churches?
“But why do I condemn them?” he
asked ; “the blame falls on their in-
structors:” and he fixed his eyes on that
quarter where the towers of the abbey
rose, like an aérial edifice, above the float-
ing mists.
Giovanni felt the religious enthusiasm
of his times without their prejudices,
and his heart ached while remembering
all that he had heard and read of priestly
anathema against this unfortunate race.
Who in this province but himself, would
have entered a Cahet's hut, pressed his

As he asked himself this question, he
thanked Heaven that he had been born
in a country where none of these wretched
beings existed, and where the blind habit
of hatred to them, had not deafened even
superior minds to the pleadings of hu-
manity and reason -
He saw in a Cahet, one of the same
species with himself; one whom he was
led by natural instinct to pity; and
whom he was bound to succour by the
vows he had taken when dedicating him-
self to the service of Heaven and of
mankind. r -
Obliged by the rules of his Order to
attend the sick, and wash the feet of
the poor, Giovanni felt no degradation,
when he knelt with the half-savage wood-
cutter before his rude altar; and, habi-
tuated to consider himself still bound to
assist all his distressed fellow-creatures,
he was not sensible to any self-applause,

when resolving not to quit Guienne till
he should ameliorate or wholly change
this forlorn one’s lot.
In this frame of mind, he reached the
abbey; sought and obtained information
of the Count d’Armand, on whose estate
Rodolphe was born.
The next day, Giovanni went to wait
on him. -
Whether his arguments, his persua-
sions, his gold, or his winning manner,
had most weight with a spendthrift cour-
tier, I leave courtiers to determine; suf.
fice it, that when he took the river-path,
he carried with him the exulting power
of bestowing freedom.
The day was advanced, and the poor
Cahet was gone to his allotted task in
the forest. Giovanni found him there,
repeating the ineffectual blows of his
hatchet at long intervals, with an arm
nearly enfeebled.
He had been wandering, at day-break,
round the house that contained the

corpse of Auguste; and had collected
there some withered flowers as they
were thrown from the windows of the
mournful chamber. He did not err
when he fondly fancied they had strewn
the body of his youthful friend.
During the progress of his labour,
these dismal flowers were only taken
from his breast, to press with his lips,
and water with tears. He displayed
them to Giovanni, telling him their his-
tory.
Giovanni took them in his hand, con-
sidered them with respect and tender-
ness, said some soothing words; and
thus lightened the grief of Rodolphe by
appearing to share it.
In the desolation of this poor outcast,
and in the stormy excess of his sorrow,
there seemed a resemblance with the
situation and feelings of Cesario Adimari;
such, at least, as they were, when Gio-
vanni first saw him in the Palazzo Pub-
lico.

The comparison did but strengthen his
interest in the person before him. And
believing he saw in his violence of feel-
ing, one of those strong characters, on
whom nature bestows an extraordinary
capacity for happiness and virtue, he
flattered himself with the hope of here-
after building him up in both, by judi-
cious instruction.
His mild sympathy had already sooth-
ed his companion into details of his little
favourite’s sportiveness and affection ;
when the deep toll of a bell was heard
over the wood-tops: at that sound, the
Cahet started up, uttered a piercing cry,
and fell upon the ground, like one de-
prived of sense. . . -
Giovanni divined the cause of this
new agony. Doubtless, that bell an-
nounced the interment of Auguste.
Some pitying drops fell from his cheek
upon the livid face of Rodolphe, as he
raised him from the ground. The un-
happy man opened his eyes, (for anguish

alone had closed them,) and fixed them
with an expression of gratitude upon the
gracious countenance of Giovanni; then
he groaned, and, closing them again,
threw himself back on the earth.
Giovanni would not urge the exhaust-
ed spirit beyond its strength: he suffered
Rodolphe to remain stretched in dumb
despair, while the bell continued to toll;
and the funeral procession, (seen only
in their mind's eye,) was proceeding
from the town to the church of the
Benedictines.
As he contemplated the convulsed
figure of the Cahet, and listened to his
half-breathed groans, he marvelled at
the mysterious power which enables man
to enslave, not merely the body, but the
mind of his fellow-men. -
What had been this poor Cahet’s
strongest desire? To follow those pre-
cious remains to their last rest; to hear
the solemn rites performed for that
almost sinless soul; to watch, and weep,

spirit; but for which no name is ade-

the sufferer’s weakness, which constitute
its very essence.
Giovanni thought he had never, till
now, fathomed the utmost depths of
human misery and human degradation;
and, yearning to restore this unoffending
creature to man’s birthright of freedom,
comfort, and knowledge, he waited
anxiously for the moment, in which he
could make him sensible, that the paths

to these, were all open to him. “I will
die!” were the first articulate sounds
the Cahet uttered, as he suddenly start-
ed from the ground, rolling round his
blood-shot eyes with a look of phrenzy
—“ They have buried him now.— and
what should I live for P”
“Live for the stranger that has sor-
rowed with you!” said Giovanni, in a
tone of gentle reproach, laying his hand
upon Rodolphe's arm.
“ For you? I would die for you!”
exclaimed the poor forester, falling at
his feet with a softened countenance,
“but you are going far away; and I —
am, like these trees, – fixed — fixed —
fixed.”
“You may go whither you will,”
replied Giovanni: “you are no longer
a slave.” -
It was long ere he could make Ro-
dolphe comprehend the change that had
taken place in his fate: the magnitude
of it stupefied him.

But when his labouring mind at length
took in, not the full extent of the bless-
ing gained for him, but only the extent
of his personal freedom, his gratitude
apd joy amounted to delirium. He
passed, in a moment, from a paroxysm of
despair to one of rapture: even the re-
collection of Auguste was suspended in
his mind. - . . . ;
To live and die near his benefactor,
near the only one of his species, save a
little child, that had ever cast on him a
look of kindness; the ideal happiness
was almost beyond his power to bear:
and, sobbing like an infant, he would
have worshipped him who blessed him
thus, had not Giovanni's gentle rebuke
taught him where to direct his thanks-
givings. -
When the replies to his wandering
questions informed Rodolphe that he
would accompany his benefactor into
other countries, amongst mixed multi-
tudes, his joy faded : he cast his eyes

upon the clear mirror of the river, and,
shuddering at “the imperfect fashion of
man” there reflected, compared it, by a
speaking glance, with the rare perfection
of Giovanni's proportions. - -
He did not speak, but that piteous
look needed no interpreter.
Giovanni understood it: he hastened
to say, that in the country where he
wished to remove him, the very name of
his proscribed race was known only to
the learned or the traveller; that, con-
sequently, he would mix on equal terms
with persons of his own condition: that
his livid complexion and feeble limbs
would change into health and vigour by
wholesome food and considerate care,
and that he would have, besides, in Gio-
vanni, a friend able and willing to protect
him against insuit. -
The simple Cahet listened as to an
oracle, his wishes giving force to each
benevolent argument. - ;
Ere Giovanni quitted him, he had

promised to be in waiting on the by-road
to Italy, by day-break the next morning.
Giovanni concluded that he would
visit the grave of Auguste during the
night, and he wished not to impose any
restraint on a sorrow so legitimate.
Yet he could have gone and wept with
him ; so truly did he lament the early
death of a child, whose uncommon
energy and sensibility augured such a
noble maturity. -
Even in that event, however, he saw
the gracious hand of Providence; which,
depriving Rodolphe of so feeble an as-
sistance, had caused him to excite the
compassion of one competent to change
his wretchedness to comfort. -
Rodolphe passed that night in the
church-yard of the Benedictines. His
lamentations no mortal ear heard ; his
agony, no mortal eye witnessed: for who
had loved the beauteous clay that rested
there, like the unhappy Cahet?— to

whom was Auguste any thing, save to
him 2 -
He returned no more to his cave. —
An osier-basket held all his property: this
consisted of a few miserable garments;
the spars which had decorated his shrine;
a rosary; and a mutilated missal; all the
gifts of Auguste. In his breast, he
hoarded the flowers he had found under
the window of that dear child, and the
sod he had taken from his grave.
With these treasures—for they were
such to him — he met Giovanni in a by-
path beyond the town; and, joining his
small suite, quitted France, with him, for
ever. -





CHAPTER I.
GiovaNNI had no sooner left Genoa than
Cesario hastened to begin his meditated
experiment upon Beatrice's affection.
Not that he wanted proof of it, for him-
self: the alarm his friend's suspicion had
conjured up, was already vanished. He
had reflected, again and again, upon all
his past intercourse with Beatrice, till
imagination and memory combined, pre-
sented him with such overwhelming testi-
monies of almost public preference from
her; that, whatever trifles testified dif.
ferently, were cast from the scale.

Reflection has usually a very different
effect upon the delusions of love than
upon those of other passions: it in-
creases, rather than diminishes them.
But when we love, is it our reason, or
our imagination, that decides 2
By a most violent effort over himself,
he refrained from her society a whole
day; then wrote her a few confused lines
to say he was going a short journey, and
could not see her ere he went. In this
note, he gave no account of whither he
went, or why he was going; nor did he
fix the period of his return. The in-
stant it was dispatched, he threw himself
upon his horse, and went where chance
impelled him.
After a week spent in aimless, cheer-
less wandering, he returned pale with
bodily fatigue, and worn with anxiety.
Now, believing he would find Beatrice
too enraptured at his return, to chide his
silence and his stay; now, fearing that
her just resentment would already have

extinguished her attachment, he hastened,
with the utmost agitation, to the Syndic’s.
On questioning his servant, he found
that neither message nor letter waited
him from the Signora Brignoletti. She
had duly received the billet he had
written, and that had satisfied her | She
had not been distressed then, by the
mysteriousness of his departure, nor by

Cesario felt his heart die within him,
at this information. With difficulty he
reached his apartment, where he threw
himself into a seat in a state of stupe-
faction.
He had believed himself prepared for
some shew of resentment from Beatrice;
he had expected some petulant message,
or letter; some rebuke through the Signora
Calva: but for this petrifying indif.
ference, he was not prepared; and it
threw all his faculties into disorder.
He held a letter from Giovanni long
in his hand, unopened: then he opened,

and read it—but he might as well have
looked on vacancy; his mind took no
cognisance of its contents.
Hour after hour passed, without giving
order to his thoughts. Fluctuating be-
tween resentment and misery, sometimes
he resolved to seek Beatrice, and re-
proach her; then, thrilling with mo-
mentary anger, he determined, rather to
lose his senses, than let her know the
extent of a love she repaid so inade-
quately.
Fortunately for him, the good Syndic
and his wife were absent from their
home; his disturbance, therefore, had no
witness. - - - ,
He was still sitting in his solitary apart-
ment, dubious what to do, and execrat-
ing his own folly, when his servant hur-
ried into the room, announcing Signor
Calva. The Signor checked himself, till
the servant had retired; then glancing
over Cesario's harassed and haggard
looks, exclaimed, with great perturbation,

“What has really happened?— Has
the Signora Beatrice guessed—” “What
of Beatrice?” interrupted Cesario, joy
flushing his face at the mere sound of a
name so beloved,
Signor Calva hastened to explain. —
How did that explanation heal and re-
vive the bleeding heart of the lover !
Beatrice, he said, had been that night
of the Signora Calva’s party to the opera;
when a story was circulated, which
wanted only the names of Cesario and
Giovanni to render mortal to her.
... It was said, that two travellers, with a
single attendant, had been attacked in
the woods near Noli, by banditti; that
one of them had fallen ; and that his
friend, and servant, in trying to rescue
his body, were desperately wounded.
The wounded persons had been after-
wards found by some military, who con-
veyed them to the adjacent town, where
their wounds were dressed. The ser-
vant, however, expired under the sur-

geon’s hands; but the other having re-
covered, had announced himself and his
murdered companion as natives of
Genoa. - -
The circumstance of their being at-
tended only by one servant, was explained
thus: the surviving gentleman had but
just joined his friend, on a matter of
temporary business; and that discussed,
he was about to return home again when
they were surprised by the robbers.
The age, the figures, the circumstances
of these travellers, (for Giovanni was to
go from Noli to Marseilles by sea,) all
pointed to Giovanni and Cesario; and
the sudden departure of the latter, with
his silence since, made the supposition
certain in the mind of Beatrice.
She had fallen into the most terrifying
fits, upon hearing this frightful relation;
and was then at the house of Signora
Calva, raving alternately of her lover and
of his friend.
The only rational words she had spoken

since the affair, was an entreaty that
Signor Calva would hasten to Cesario's
residence, and Giovanni's, and learn what
had been heard of them there.
“How, beyond my hopes, was it, to
find yourself!” explained the Signor, as
he hurried along the streets with the im-
patient, the agonised, yet the overjoyed
lover.
Cesario rushed into the room, whence
issued the sound of Beatrice's agitated
voice — he threw himself at her feet, as
she lay sobbing on the bosom of the
Signora Calva.
“Cesario !” she shrieked out, “ Ce-
sario !” starting up as she spoke, “but
where — where is your friend?”
“My own Beatriceſ” burst raptur-
ously from the lover's lips, as he fondly
fancied her interest in Giovanni but a
sympathy with all his powerful affections.
“Our Giovanni is safe—is well.—This
letter from him.”—
Beatrice extended her hand with a

look of wild joy, to snatch the letter he
offered, but ere she could do so, she
fainted on his neck. - -
Signor Calva, who was observing the
scene, started—eyed her unbreathing
figure for a moment or two in silent
displeasure ; then, with a significant
“hum !” abruptly quitted the room.
Whatever was the suspicion which had
darted through his mind, it touched not
that of Cesario; for, to him, every thing
appeared bliss-confirming; and as hepress-
ed the pale face of Beatrice against his,
while the Signora Calva sought to revive
her by essences, and assiduities, he forgot
to aid those assiduities, but remained
fondly, blissfully gazing on her.
At length her quivering eyelids, and
a few short breathings, announced re-
turning life: the Signoragently withdrew
her hand from the head of Beatrice, and
smiling kindly on Cesario, left them to-
gether. - - -
All Beatrice's first enquiries and ex-

clamations were incoherent: they were
uttered with such rapidity and wildness;
with such a mixture of transport, and
terror; with so many tears, so many em-
braces; in such a distraction of spirit,
in short, that Cesario might as well have
pretended to describe the figures of so
many lightning-flashes, as have remem-
bered what she said and did during the
first moments of explanation.
. The letter he shewed her from Gio-
vanni, was dated from a very different
place than the scene of assassination; and
being of a later date than that assigned
to this horrid affair, completely dis-
proved its connection with him.
Her expression of joy after reading it,
was so earnest and so delightful to Ce-
sario, that he scarcely knew how to per-
severe in what had always been his
intention; namely, to tell her the reason
of the experiment he had made upon
a heart, his devoted one had never
doubted. -

Sincerity was, however, the code of
Cesario's life; and hesitating but an in-
stant, he frankly confessed the trial he
had made of her affection, (which accident
only had rendered so painful,) and the
scepticism of Giovanni, which it was in-
tended to vanquish. Fortunately for
Beatrice, Cesario had cast down his
humbled eye, while making this confes-
sion; so that her blush—and how deep
was that blush ! escaped his notice.
She knew not whether to admit this
account of Giovanni’s observations on her
decreasing attachment to his friend as a
proof of her dangerous influence over
himself; or simply as a proof of his un-
swerving fidelity to his friend: but, at
all events, her policy now was to hide
from Cesario the emotion it caused in
her.
She did not reply for some time: at
length, with a smile of thrilling sweet-
ness, she said, “I can be angry with you
Cesario, but not indifferent. I was angry

at your abrupt, unexplained absence;
and I would not bend to enquire the
reason of it; but when I heard that
horrid story—when I fancied ” She
stopt, blushed; and hiding her conscious
face, in very confusion pressed his hand
to her heart. -
The rapture which followed from Ce.
sario need not be described: he believed
himself in possession of the whole heart
of her he loved, believed also, that he
had discovered in that heart all the sen-
sibility it once seemed to want; and she
fluttered between the hope of attaching
a new lover, and the necessity of blinding
an old one. -
From that night, Cesario spoke of his
friend to her with complete confidence.
He lamented with her, Giovanni's early
disappointment, and its supposed effect,
of rendering him too doubtful of female
stability; and he exulted with her over
his triumph, and Giovanni's recantation.
Meanwhile, Beatrice felt much, and

reflected little. How often did she turn
away with the weariness of satiety from
the vivid looks and manners of Cesario;
asking herself how she could ever have
found a charm in aught but the heavenly
calm of his friend’s countenance. . . .
That magnificence of stature and pro-
portion which distinguished Giovanni's
appearance from that of all other men,
seemed to her the only character of
figure worthy the name of manly beauty;
and that soft, but resolute sway which
he exercised over himself and others,
appeared to her the only mental attribute
before which her spirit could now wil-
lingly bend. Ar - - -
Cesario's lighter graces of person, and
lustre of expression, ceased to charm her
eyes; his sensibility, his eloquence, his
exhaustless fertility of fancy, all ceased
to interest her heart; because—she had
ceased to love him -
She was, besides, growing weary of
all the persons and pleasures by which
5


## p. 13 (#23) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 13
she was courted; and that, because every
pleasure was attainable to her, and every
associate subservient. Her fickleness
wanted novelty; her active spirit, diffi-
culty. She was continually imagining
the glory, and gratification, of subduing
Giovanni's prejudices against her sex;
and of seeing him at her feet: some-
times, she even fancied, that to win his
love, she could change her nature, and
become all he admired.
Vain fancy! Beatrice knew not her
own heart: she knew not that she loved
Giovanni as she had loved Cesario; as a
child desires a toy; covets it, — fights for
it, —struggles the harder the stouter it is
withheld, -gains it, sees another, drops
the first, and goes over the same con-
test for the second. - -
On the night of Giovanni's departure,
she had wept till morning; precisely
as she had done, when Cesario broke
his appointment in the Rosso gardens:
but the next day, she began to imagine

all that he would do and say when he re-
turned ; and, hoping every thing she
wished, because all things hitherto had
bent to her will, she became again ac-
cessible to pleasure, and diffusive of
gaiety.
More enchanted than ever with his
fair mistress, Cesario yielded up his soul
to happiness: again his sky was cloudless,
and his path through Elysium. His last
gallant enterprise had not only obtained
the public thanks of the Seigniory, but
procured him a more flattering testi-
mony.
In gratitude for the service rendered
to so many of his subjects, the Grand Duke
of Tuscany conferred on him the order of
the Star; accompanying a brilliant collar
of the Order, with a letter written in his
own hand.
This distinction was not without its
fruit: it conferred honour; and it di-,
rected the eyes of his compatriots to
the young hero, whose blood was thus

liberally poured out from a principle of
general philanthropy.
How freely would he let it flow, they
thought, whenever called on, to shed it

Thus, the bright sun of honour was
shining over his head; and he wanted
only Fortune's golden shower, to ripen
his harvest of expected happiness.

At this crisis, Giovanni returned.
Having bespoken, for Rodolphe, the
compassion and care of the excellent
woman to whom his household cares were
• delegated, Giovanni hastened to the
Piazza dell’Acqua Verde. He found Ce-
sario on the point of going out, to keep
an appointment with Beatrice.
With what joy, what affection did they
embrace —So ardent was the welcome of
Cesario, that Giovanni could with dif-
ficulty refrain from imparting to him the
narrative of his visit to Marseilles. Some
reasonable fear, however, of possible dis-
appointment, checked this useless over-
flow; and, contenting himself with de-
tailing the other incidents of his journey,

he enjoyed his friend’s sympathy, without
risking his friend’s future mortification.
Having given several sincere sighs to
the probable fate of Madame de Fronsac,
and to the history of the Cahet, Cesario
hastened to convince Giovanni, that he
had been unjust in estimating the cha-
racter of Beatrice.
- The strength of his argument lay in her
extreme emotion when she believed that
Giovanni had fallen under the hands of
the banditti. He described her agonies
then, and her joy afterwards; he painted
her subsequent interest in him, with all
the ardour of unsuspicious sincerity.
He forgot not to say, that almost the
first words she uttered, when restored to
her senses, had been, “but where is your
friend ?”
Cesario saw, but remarked not, the Sud-
den colour which spread over Giovanni's
face, at the last sentence; yet he remem-
bered it in after times, and drew from
ºr-
it a fatal inference, " . ... . . .

What, then, are those subtle operations
of the mind, which can thus go on, un-
observed, even by ourselves? yet which
memory can recal afterwards, when nei-
ther foregone observation, nor subsequent
reflection, has assisted in stamping an
image of that act
Giovanni would not have been sorry
had Cesario suspected the veering incli-
nation of Beatrice, from her conduct,
and his disturbance; for to be suspected
himself, of any passion for her, never en-
tered his imagination: but he shrunk
from the coarse, and perhaps unjustifiable
task, of telling her lover, that he found
her inconstant heart had now strayed to
him.
In this humour, he consented, not un-
willingly, to accompany his friend to San
Pier d’Arena.
This beautiful fauxbourg was then
the evening resort of all the youth and
beauty of Genoa.
Carriages of any kind were uncommon;

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 19
but the few there were, regularly appear-
ed there with the elders of families; the
young still preferring the gayer fashion
of riding, or the freer one of walking.
As Giovanni, leaning on the arm of
Cesario, advanced along the path, where
this ‘lively promenade commences, he
directed his friend’s attention to the
strong contrast exhibited by the animated
multitude at a distance, and the scene
near at hand. - º -
Where they stood, all was stillness, and
fragrance, and rural beauty: the sea was
so calm, that but for its soft, laving sound
against the shore, it might have been
imagined a moveless plane of crystal.
The verdant acclivities, rising from Ses-
tri, to Campo Marone, were covered with
the countless colours of evening; while
the loveliest of the stars, palpitating at
intervals through those iris-tinctured
clouds, rather excited tenderness than
awakened to pleasure.
Giovanni paused; and directing his

eye to the whirling chariots, and horses
beyond, he said, “How ingenious we
are in destroying the beauties, and de-
lights of nature . This tranquil scene
owes half its charm to its tranquillity;
yet, that mad crowd hurry into it, mar-
ring the charm they profess is their
attraction ''' -
Cesario was about to vindicate the mo-
tive, at least, of each individual; when,
from a throng at a short distance, one
fair rider darted towards them like a
bright meteor. — By the carnation and
white feathers on the head of her tasselled
and tinkling palfrey, Giovanni knew it
to be the Signora Beatrice. Cesario’s
beating breast recognised only her smil-
ing self.
“ Ah, my friend P’ she exclaimed,
with a tone eloquent of joy, and a look
yet more eloquent, extending a hand to
Giovanni. - -
In Cesario's unsuspecting ear, never
had her voice sounded sweeter; for he

believed her admiration of Giovanni's
character, the best proof of her own ex-
cellence. He ran to quiet the spirited
little horse, which her fluttered grasp
had no longer strength to rein in ; but
Giovanni forbore offering his assistance;
and having shaken hands with her, re-
mained a few paces off, returning her
agitated and repeated exclamations of
delight, with a countenance almost aus-
tere. - -
Cesario averted his face for a moment,
to salute her advancing companions;
Beatrice seized that opportunity, of di-
recting a look to Giovanni, only too ex-
pressive of her mortification at his de-
termined coldness: his modest eye fell
under the unbridled glance. But his
resolution was taken ; and resolving to
weary out her fancy by obstinate dul-
ness, and extreme reserve, he only utter-
ed a few words of friendly satisfaction,
at seeing her look so well.
Turning to Marco Doria, who was in

22 THE KNIGHT OF ST, JOHN.
the party, he repeated the remark he
had made to Cesario, upon the folly of
people coming for retirement, to mobs;
and seeking pure air, in a cloud of dust.
“ But who comes hither, either for
air or retirement?” asked Marco, who
was at that moment the champion of
society. “ The women come to kill;
and we, to fall their victims. In short,
the plain truth is, that all walk here,
either to meet an old love, or to find a
new one. Come, confess! Does not
some bright-eyed beauty attract you!”
Giovanni shook his head, and smiled
rather contemptuously: Marco re-iter-
ated his charge. Giovanni recollected
himself; and resuming that tranquil air,
which was more withering to Beatrice's
hopes, than the haughtiest scorn, said
gaily:
“Spare your artillery, my good Signor;
'tis wasting it on one bullet-proof. I
have had my day of folly long ago. And
though I do not value some of my

friends the less for being at this moment
under the influence of the tyrant pas-
sion; I may wish their serene evening
of reasonable affections, were already
come, like mine.” -
“ Oh, infidel !” exclaimed Cesario
sportively, and glancing at Beatrice.
What was his astonishment to see her
cheeks covered with tears! With dif.
ficulty did he retain the bridle of her
palfrey, while he pressed close to her;
hurrying out some expressions of amaze-
ment, and enquiry, and alarm. -
Beatrice's vexation was beyond her
power to control. “Your friend insults
me!” she exclaimed sobbing, wildly wrap-
ping her head in the Mezzaro, which had
hitherto blown round her shoulders'
“My friend! — Giovanni —” re-
peated Cesario, with a vacant gaze, re-
collecting Giovanni's words, and unable
to comprehend what insult had been
couched in them.
The rest of the little party exclaimed

24 THE KNIGHT OF ST. John.
loudly at the Signora's absurdity: Giovanni
alone was silent. His heart was swelling
with indignation, almost disgust; while
he scarcely knew which most to wonder
at, Beatrice’s determined abandonment
to her feelings, or Cesario's blind faith
in her truth. -
Each of the company repeated Gio-
vanni's offending answer; at the same
time coupling it with a lively rebuke of
the Signora's touchy humour; and thus
obliging her to recollect that the occult
meaning was known only to herself; the
insult none, if she were not conscious of
meriting rebuke.
Forced, therefore, to rally herself,
she coloured, tried to laugh, explained,
defended, and finally confessing her own
foolish misapprehension, and more foolish
irritability, suffered Cesario to put her
hand into that of his friend.
“”Tis well,” he said, as he prest them
together, “ that such a cloud of dust
covers yonder multitude; we should not

w
else have escaped ridicule,” and he turned
aside, to recover his own composure.
Peace apparently restored, Beatrice
declared herself weary of the promenade,
and proposed returning home. Marco
Doria volunteered riding back, to inform
the Marchesa, that her daughter had left
the drive; and, as the Marchesa's heavy
coach never went at a livelier pace than
a state-hearse, he whispered Cesario, he
might have time for at least a folio of
fond nonsense, ere the old lady should
appear to interrupt it. -
Signor Calva and the ladies now
walked their horses to keep pace with
their friends on foot; and the former,
sporting with some ungraceful fashion of
his wife's dress, threw a little gaiety into
the conversation. All otherwise would
have been sombre : for the spoiled Bea-
trice could not conquer her chagrin at
the repelling air of Giovanni; and he
would not, upon principle, attempt to
varnish her unamiable mood,

Cesario, troubled, confounded, unknow-
ing what to think, yet sure there was
some latent cause for the strangeness of
Beatrice, was lost in distracting fears
and forebodings.
Alas, unhappy Cesario ! he conjec-
tured nothing like the truth: he simply
began to believe, that Giovanni unjustly
disliked this object of his fondest admir-
ation; that she saw it, felt it, and resent-
ed it: that days of distress and dissen-
sion were approaching; days, in which
his heart would be rent alternately by
his friend and his mistress.
At first this imagination plunged him
into such deep sadness, that he neither
heard nor answered what was addressed
to him ; but, gradually, better thoughts
dawned : his elastic character rose above
the sudden pressure; and, cherishing the
belief of reconciling these two precious
persons, by making their respective ex-
cellences more intimately known to each
other, he recovered his spirits.

Instead of proceeding to the usual em-
trance of the Palazzo Rosso, Beatrice
suddenly alighted from her horse at one
of the garden-gates, and, giving her page
orders to quit her, said “Farewell” to
her party. -
Every one returned her adieu, except
Cesario; but he, whispering his resolu-
tion of attending her through those ex-
tensive gardens at so late an hour (for
it was night), shook hands with Gio
vanni, and followed her. . . .
Beatrice was no longer in a condition
to control herself: the dignified firm-
ness of Giovanni's manner, as they pro-
ceeded homewards, had dispossessed her
of the little self-command she had ever
to boast; and, released from other ob-
servers, she gave way, before Cesario, to
all the violence of her feelings,
“ No!” she cried, in a voice of des-
peration, bursting into a passion of tears,
and repulsing the hand Cesario held out
to her—“ no I never can—never will

grateful, unfeeling Giovanni !”
“Hates you!—Giovanni!—You will
not be mine ! — Beatrice!” — Cesario
stood like one before whom some strange
apparition is passing.
Beatrice recollected herself; but still
she wept—wept more profusely. “What
happiness should we have, if I were to
know that the dearest friend of my hus-
band disliked me—misinterpreted me—
perhaps would infuse his doubts into him
at last !”
“O heaven '' exclaimed Cesario :
“shall I ever be forced to choose be-
tween my friend and Beatrice P’—and
he shuddered as he flung his arms round
her.
Beatrice leaned on his shoulder, and
wept bitterly. “Why does he dislike
me so P’’ she asked, in a more softened
tone. “What have I done to deserve
such savage treatment?”
“Be composed, my best-beloved ſ”

said Cesario, gently placing her on a
seat by one of the fountains: “this ex-
cess of sensibility leads you astray.
Would I had never confessed to you Gio-
vanmi's erroneous notions of your sex –
but did I not tell you, too, that he pro-
mises to recant all his heresies one day
in your favour 2’’
“When 2–when? what day 2” ex-
claimed Beatrice.
Cesario pressed her agitated breast
against his, while he fondly whispered a
few words of the tenderest import. Bea-
trice struggled herself out of his em-
brace: “That day !—talk not of it, Ce-
sario!” Her voice was hurried and broken.

Beatrice, by these fantastic griefs?” in-

oath-bound to repress even the slightest
sentiment of regard or admiration for
your charming sex: you forget that the
eye of his spirit is not often withdrawn
from the one perfect being ; and that,
after contemplating such brightness, the
brightest here are dark to his exalted
sense. Thus, where your happy Cesario
sees nothing but light, and life, and joy
(fervently kissing her hand between each
rapturous expression), he discovers a so-
litary something, which nature permits
there, to show that Beatrice is not yet all
angel.” -
He stopt, and, soothed by his fond
flatteries, she “imparadised his soul” by
one of her most bewitching smiles, and
he resumed. -
“Giovanni is visionary enough to de-
mand heaven on earth; and he seeks to
bring it here by trying to make you
faultless: he therefore stifles every ex-
pression of admiration, and speaks to you -
only as a monitor. Believe me, it costs

you excite in him under the severe ex-
terior of reproof. He has told me how
dangerously charming he thinks your
brief penitence and gay defiance.”
“Charming!” repeated Beatrice, de-
light dancing in her eyes: “if you could
convince me that Giovanni, that your
friend did not despise me !—ah! he will
never do any thing but despise me!”
Cesario hastened to repeat to her num-
berless admiring and kind expressions of
Giovanni's relating to herself, tending to
prove that she was an object of extreme
interest to him. -
While he repeated these, he coloured
them (unconsciously) more highly than
the originals from which they were drawn;
and he increased their value by forgetting
to state when they were said—in the
earliest period of Giovanni's acquaintance,
ere he knew her thoroughly.
Beatrice fell into a deep reverie, and
gave way to a thousand cheating fancies,

* The paramount idea in this day-dream
was, that Giovanni's coldness arose from
restrained passion, and that he wrestled
against her and himself from romantic
fidelity to his friend,
- With such an ally in his bosom, she
thought, would she not prevail at last?
She could scarcely doubt it. Snatched
away by the joy of this belief, her sti-
mulated passions left conscience and de-
licacy far behind; and, resolving to seize
their prize, reckless of Cesario's peace
and Giovanni's honour, she gaily started
from her thoughtful posture. -
Looking with all the graciousness of
an elated heart upon the anxious coun-
tenance of Cesario, she said—“Well,
then, make us friends again : let Signor
Cigala come as usual : come oftener to
the Palazzo Rosso ; tell him that I am
ready to sacrifice all my levities, all my
wishes, to please the friend of Cesario.”
Her eye sunk with her voice, as she
uttered the last sentence; but again the

credulous Cesario was thrown into trans-
port by that two-fold charm of tender-
ness and generosity which this speech
‘contained. . - -
Though he had argued against Bea-
trice’s convictions in their past conver-
sations, he had secretly and sadly con-
fessed to himself that she was right, and
that Giovanni's demeanor, at their meet-
ing, had astonished even him by its
coldness. -
After the account he had given his
friend of her anguish at his supposed
murder, how stubborn must be that
friend’s prejudice against her character,
if he could withstand such a proof of her
ingenuous interest in the man so beloved
by her Cesario. Cesario hoped, how-
ever, that her present generosity, in not
only forgiving such ingratitude, but in
offering to guide her conduct by Gio-
vanni's admonitions, must conquer his
esteem, and wrest the acknowledgment
of it from his lips.

“I will bring him to you to-morrow,”
he said, as they parted at the garden-por-
tico of the Palazzo, under the bright
light of the the moon. “I will make
you friends again; and after that, O, my
Beatrice, may we three have but one
heart!”
Beatrice could not bear the tender,
touching, trusting tone with which this
was said. She turned away her face
abruptly from the moonlight which shone
full on her false, false eyes, as they were
on the point of seeking Cesario's, and,
half repenting, half exulting, alternately
wishing she could be true, and hoping
Giovanni would be false, she just re-
returned the pressure of her cheated
lover's hand, and quitted him.

CHAPTER III.
Cesario flew to the Strada Lomellini.
He found Giovanni sitting tranquilly in
his study, discoursing with Rodolphe, by
the light of that pure planet from which
Beatrice had just shrunk.
Cesario's impatience of any hindrance
to the conversation he most desired,
gave way before the interest excited by
humanity. He was not skilled in lan-
guages, but he could utter a few sen-
tences in imperfect French ; and the ex-
pressive kindness of his looks made even
these unnecessary. He approached, and
took the Cahet's hand. Rodolphe suf-
fered his hand to remain in his for a mo-
ment in vacant surprise, while his eyes
wandered from Cesario's beaming face

to the gentler light of his master’s : but
by degrees those eyes suffused, and having
put Cesario's hand to his lips, he ran to
Giovanni, took, and wrung, and kissed
his with passionate gratitude; then hur-
ried out of their presence.
After a few moments given to the sem-
sibility of Rodolphe, Cesario ingenuously
repeated to Giovanni all that had just
passed between himself and Beatrice.
As frankly did he avow his own surprise
at his friend’s chilling return to her
animated welcome of him.
Giovanni listened in profound silence;
for he was meditating how to reply. At
length, with a clearing countenance, he
said rather sportively,–" It is too late to
begin quarrelling with my nature, Ce-
sario; you and I have pledged ourselves
to each other; and you must endure my
frost as I do your fire. — However, is it
not a little unreasonable in you to expect
that I shall throw myself into ecstacies at
the sight of your mistress! I welcomed

her, as any other sober-minded man
would do the affianced wife of his friend;
and what more would you, or ought she
to wish?”—“No Giovanni,” replied Ce-
‘sario, gravely, “yours is not a nature of
frost; and I feel that you did return the
affecting joy of Beatrice with amazing
insensibility. There is still some lurking
disapprobation of her in your heart.
What is it?—our friendship gives me a
right to repeat, what is it?”
Giovanni was awhile silent. “To be
sincere with you,” he said at last, “will
offend or pain you—yet so pressed—
the Signora ought not to press me—how-
ever, no matter | – I confess then, there
is something still, which dissatisfies me
with her. Yet I do protest to you most
solemnly, that there is nothing I desire so
much to be assured of, as her friendship;
that if I find she really feels that senti-
ment for me, and will follow some advice
I mean to give her, she will make me the
happiest of men; for she will then insure

to me both my friend and his happi-
ness. – Take me to see her to-morrow,
and be satisfied that I will ask her par-
don for all my harshnesses with as much
sincerity as she will promise me amend-
ment.”
“The expression in your eyes belies
your words. – What impossible perfec-
tion is it that you want?” exclaimed Ce-
sario, bewildered and amazed. “I un-
derstand you less than I do Beatrice.
In the name of Heaven, what is it you
require 2–In our conversation before
you went for France, your chief quarrel
with Beatrice was her supposed deficiency
in sensibility; and now you seem almost
angry with her for evincing so much.
Giovanni, is not this unreasonable P’’
“ Apparently so,” replied Giovanni,
“but have patience. To-morrow I will
ask from her a proof of friendship for me,
of attachment to you, of respect for her-
self; and if she refuses, you ought to re-
nounce her.”

“ Renounce herſ’ repeated Cesario,
and he stood motionless with astonish-
ment.
“If she give this proof,” resumed Gi-
ovanni, “I shall hate myself; and if she
forgive me afterwards, I will confess her
scarcely less than angel—for in that
case I must be incomprehensible to her.”
“You distract me !” exclaimed Ce-
sario; “let us discuss this no further. I
see what it is you mean: you suspect
Beatrice of artifice : you think her sen-
sibility on your account assumed.”
Giovanni averted his head; and a sigh
of compassion for his friend’s blindness
half escaped him.
“You do not answer me,” repeated
Cesario, with a kindling countenance;
“here let us part, then, for to-day. When
matins are over, be ready for me to-
morrow, and I will take you to Beatrice.
She will be alone; let all be explained
then — let her distinctly hear what
are the heavy accusations you have to

bring against her, and what the trial of
truth to which you mean to bring her.
Let me learn, in short, whether I am
henceforth to commit half my happiness
into the hands of a friend, or into those of
a madman.” – Cesario looked sternly as
he pronounced the last ungracious word;
and, refusing the hand Giovanni offered,
abruptly departed.
, Giovanni looked after him a moment
with sorrow, apprehension, and pity in
his heart; murmured a few indulgent
words, and turned to benevolent occu-
pation for comfort.
The friends met the next day, with
constraint on one side, and seriousness
on the other. Cesario was justly dis-
pleased at the strange rigidity of his
friend; and Giovanni was perplexed how
to convince Cesario of that of which he
was too well convinced, though a fact
of which he could bring no tangible
proof, namely, Beatrice's views upon
himself.

In silence they walked along the Strada
Nuova; in silence they entered the glit-
tering palace of the Brignoletti. A page
conducted them to Beatrice: she was
sitting in an absolute temple of flowers,
“ herself the fairest flower.”
All those extravagant hopes which she
had so suddenly and rashly conceived the
day before, were now glowing on her
cheek; she was sparkling with brightness
and bloom.
She started from her seat on the friends’
approach, and, extending a hand to each,
exclaimed, “–We meet friends, Signor
Giovanni? O if you could read my heart,
and see how sincerely I covet your re-
gard P” – As she said this, who that
looked upon that frank and fearless brow,
could have imagined there was ought be-
neath it she should have wished con-
cealed?
Giovanni almost doubted the past evi-
dence of his senses; but, fortifying him-
self anew against her prime witchcraft,

that air of ingenuous youth, – he ap-
proached her.
Taking her hand, and resting his eyes
on her for a few moments with earnest
observation, he said, -
“Signora, will you allow me to deal
frankly with you?—will you pardon me
hereafter, if it is proved that I have mis-
taken your intentions?—and will you,
in that case, obtain for me Cesario’s
pardon?”
“Speak on, sir!” replied Beatrice,
the colour heightening on her cheeks.
“You know, Signora,” he resumed,
“that from the first days of our ac-
quaintance, I had the boldness to notice
those little blemishes, which you share
with more than half your sex. I had
often the pleasure of seeing you make
some efforts at uprooting them: – surely
that boldness was the best proof of my
real regard for you, and for my friend?—
you pardoned it.”
“I did,” faltered Beatrice, turning

suddenly pale, and shrinking with in-
distinct dread.
“So far, then, there was no coldness
nor resentment between us,” resumed
Giovanni. “I felt a brother’s interest in
you ; but at length I saw, or fancied I
saw, (dare I own it 2) a decline in your
professed affection for Cesario: — I had
even the temerity to imagine that you
were trifling with his peace; that you
never meant to fulfil your engagement
with him.”
He was interrupted by an exclamation
of indignation from Cesario. Beatrice
stretched out her hand, and caught the
arm of the latter; for she had no longer
courage to dare the remainder of this
explanation. “ Take me away,” she
cried, averting her eyes from Giovanni's
speaking look; “I can endure no more.”
“ Stay, Signora! In Heaven's name,
I adjure you, stay!” exclaimed Gio-
vanni, turning with earnest expression
from her quivering features to the in-

flaming countenance of his friend—
“This is the crisis of my friendship with
Cesario, and I have but a few more
words to say.” -
“If I have wronged you, it is in your
power to convince me, by at once doing
what I believe it to be your duty to do;
that is, avow your attachment to your
mother l’” * -
“To my mother!” exclaimed Bea-
trice, alarm and the pangs of disap-
pointment struggling in her voice —
“How should I ever be able to bear
her anger? — No, no. — Do not ask so
hard a proof of me!” — and her humid
eye-glance spoke volumes to his.
“I should think systematic deception
a harder task,” said Giovanni. He ut-
tered that full-fraught sentence steadily,
yet with compassionate apprehensiveness.
Beatrice felt the shaft strike; and she
burst into ungovernable tears.
Cesario caught her hand in his. “Gi-
ovanni! on your life proceed no fur.

ther l’’ he cried; “I will bear no more.”
There was a threatening cloud on his
brow, which restored to it all its early
haughtiness. Giovanni felt the recol-
lection of former days press upon him, as
he looked at his friend ; and he looked
but the more tenderly for that recol-
lection. He did not speak.
“What inhuman proof of attachment
to me do you require of the fond heart
on which I repose with perfect confi-
dence 2° asked Cesario, after mastering
the first blaze of anger. “You have
more than once urged this upon me;
and have I not uniformly assured you,
that I was certain the avowal of our en-
gagement would not only overwhelm
Beatrice with her mother’s wrath, but
prove my sentence of banishment from
the Palazzo Rosso? It is in the Mar-
chesa’s power to enclose her daughter in
a cloister; to debar her from friends,
liberty, every thing, in short, but life, till
the day of her minority expires? What

madness, then, to ask the consent we
know she never would give ; and to
make for her a plea for separating us at
once P”
“Yet, grant it should prove so, my
Cesario,” replied Giovanni mildly. “You
would then have the consciousness of
acting rightly; and two years sacrificed
to integrity would make you both more
worthy of happiness. I grant, the Mar-
chesa is of a severe temper; ambitious,
prejudiced: but you stand high in public
expectation. You are of noble blood |
Why should not the Signora try her mo-
ther with these arguments? Why should
she, whose influence is unbounded over
the Marchesa in all other things, just
shrink from exerting that influence on
the point most connected with her own
peace and good name?— Amiable Bea-
trice!” he said, turning to her, and
gently taking her hand, “believe me, I
am solely actuated by the desire of seeing
you and Cesario united in hearts, as well

as fates. Waiving my own satisfaction
in a happy result, I do strenuously urge
you to take the step proposed, as the
one most likely to insure your future
comfort. Honestly proclaim your en-
gagement with a man, whose brows wear
the noblest crown of honour and of vic-
tory! Have the courage to dare the
chance of being severed a while, that you
may pledge your faith to each other here-
after without a blush | Rescue yourself
from the gross imputation you now labour
under, of sporting with the love you
never mean to reward | Recover your
self-respect as a daughter, and attach to
yourself, for life, a friend, who will de-
vote his whole existence to repair his
present harshness.”
His benevolent eyes were suffused by
his earnestness. Beatrice raised her’s ;
and fixed them, for the first time since
his entrance, steadily upon him. How
seducing, how dangerous were the tears
that floated those beautiful eyes! How

doubly dangerous their penetrating ex-
pressionſ
“ You ask me to do this, Giovanni !”
she said, after a long pause. “You ask
me — well then — I promise.”
She had no sooner uttered that mo-
mentous promise, than her eyelids closed,
and she sank into the extended arms of
the transported Cesario. -
Giovanni gazed on her for a moment
in a trance of feelings long unknown
to him : it was the infirmity but of a
moment: he started at his own weak-
ness; and, resolutely extinguishing what-
ever unhallowed fire pity had kindled, he
turned towards Cesario.
“I have overwrought her tender na-
ture,” he said. (Alas, why was Bea-
trice then sensible to the pathos of his
voice P) “And now, Cesario, I confess it
is tender — heroic, I believe When she
revives, pray her to forgive me. Tell.
her, I depend on her promise for the
sake of your happiness and her own;

tell her, she and Cesario will be united
henceforth in my heart, and in my
prayers.”
Giovanni was powerfully affected; too
powerfully for restraint: and Cesario,
troubled, bewildered, amazed, knew not
whether the emotion with which his
breast was heaving, were grief or glad-
11eSS.
He felt the delicate frame of Beatrice
trembling in his arms; and he asked
himself, why all this was done; and by
what authority Giovanni had made her
consent to enter upon a line of conduct
from which she foreboded such disas-
terous consequences?
In this stupor of thought, he offered
no resistance to his friend's departure;
but remained, after Giovanni was gone,
still supporting Beatrice.
Giovanni returned home in great dis-
turbance of mind. He shut himself into
a distant apartment, where no one might

invade him, and abandoned himself to
reflection. -
What had he done? — forced a young
inexperienced girl to promise the fulfil-
ment of a solemn engagement, from
which her heart revolted Was he sure
that Cesario's happiness would be se-
cured by it? Was he sure that her feeble
character could support, throughout life,
the high tone just given to it by the en-
thusiasm of self-sacrifice?
What would become of him, if her
culpable vacillation towards him should
re-appear after she had become the wife
of his friend! Would it be possible for
him to continue in that intimate union
with Cesario, while apprehensive of
awaking in his mind the suspicion, or in
her’s the reality, of a guilty passion 2
How had this unexpected self-devotion
of Beatrice destroyed his views?
Giovanni had calculated, with seeming
reason, upon her petulant refusal to give
the pledge he demanded; he had ima-

gined her heart full of childish, wilful
passion; nor dreamt of the temporary
elevation to which even passion could
raise itself, when his pure character was
its object, and his admiration its aim. .
Every look, every word, hitherto, had
testified Beatrice's strong and involuntary
sentiment for him : perhaps Cesario
had never, indeed, won more than her
lively gratitude; if so, she was to be
pitied, while blamed; and Giovanni felt,
that he must be more or less than man,
did not his heart melt at her intended
self-sacrifice.
That mixture of extreme weakness,
and extreme strength in the character of
Beatrice, which her present conduct dis-
played, was of itself calculated to awaken
compassion and tenderness. Giovanni's
better reason was bewildered by it for a
brief instant; but not his principles:
they faltered not. His heart, still loyal
to his friend, and impregnable in virtue,
throbbed not with one lawless pulse.

After the first confusion of surprise .
and pity was over, he began to think
with more distinctness. Whatever dis-
tress might follow the promise into which
he had drawn Beatrice, he believed he
had no cause to condemn his share in
the transaction. Her indiscreet conduct
towards himself, rendered it his duty
either to extort from her an avowal of
her altered sentiments for Cesario, or to .
re-awaken in her a sense of shame and
of honour; at least, that indiscretion
made it his duty to protest, as plainly as
delicacy would permit, against the effect
of her charms upon his integrity.
This duty he had performed: his in-
tention was unimpeachable; the event
might be unfortunate; but for the in-
tention only was he responsible.
The longer Giovanni reflected upon
the past scene at the Palazzo Rosso, the
more he became convinced that the en-
thusiasm of Beatrice would not have con-
tinuance. At any rate, he was certain


## p. 53 (#63) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 53
that her self-command could not proceed
beyond the mere act of asking the Mar-
chesa’s consent to her union with Cesario:
she would find it too difficult a task to
conceal that disgust and aversion to him
which must arise in such an indulged
heart as her’s, the moment she should
consider herself his victim. These feel-
ings would force themselves on notice;
and the ultimate consequence must be—
explanation, and separation.
But how would fare his friendship with
Cesario during this stormy time 2 Gio-
vanni dreaded to answer the question.
The only personal sacrifice he could
make, in return for the one which the
infatuated Beatrice was now certainly in-
tending, was some portion of that full-
- flowing confidence with Cesario, without
which friendship withers and dies. Per-
haps this was the bitterest sacrifice fate
could exact from a man to whom friend-
ship was every thing; but honour and
honesty forbade him to give a deter-

minate meaning to those expressions from
Beatrice, which his mind had too faith-
fully shaped into their original image;
and unless he did so, a cloud must always
cover his motives in the transaction.
After the strictest scrutiny of himself,
Giovanni was satisfied that he had acted
right; and that conviction fortified him
against any consequence. .
Towards evening, Cesario appeared.
He came to acknowlege, and to ask for-
giveness, for his angry impetuosity in the
morning; to confess his conviction of his
friend's disinterested anxiety for his re-
putation and happiness, as well as for
that of Beatrice; and to avow his own
belief, after cooler consideration, that
they were imperiously called on by duty
to act as he advised.
This was generous affection, with over-
flowing measure! It partook of that
trusting credulity which kept Cesario so
blind to Beatrice’s dereliction: for Gio-
vanni felt, that until Beatrice's impru-

dences of speech should be known to
Cesario, the latter must always have ra-
tional ground for considering his friend's
determined interference with their pri-
vate plans, an absolute persecution.
But Giovanni knew his own motives
were pure, though obliged to lie conceal-
ed; and he was content, therefore, to
owe Cesario’s return of confidence to
partial blindness, since he dare not
demand his scrutiny.
Giovanni had now to listen and to
sympathise with Cesario's fervent views:
that sanguine spirit was again all hope
and fond anticipation. The Marchesa’s
consent to his immediate marriage with.
her daughter, no longer seemed impro-
bable; and his ardent imagination soon
pictured future honours, plucked from
the steep of danger, ennobling and jus-
tifying the Signora's choice.
It was a hard task for Giovanni to
partake any part of his friend's trans-
port; for as yet he knew not what to

believe, or what to wish about Beatrice.
If she were to abide by her sudden
heroism, from the moment she became
Cesario's wife, his friend was bound, by
every feeling sacred in man, to forget,
himself, and to make her forget, if pos-
sible, that she had ever given him cause
to suspect her heart had strayed from its
first ties, -
The possibility of this consummation
rendered discretion now, an absolute
duty on his part; yet, even while he felt
this, there was a misgiving something in
his breast, which almost smothered every
attempt at participation with his friend.
When they met again the next morn-
ing, Cesario brought a billet he had just
received from Beatrice; it was evidently
Written in great agitation, and contained
these lines:-
“EvKRY thing combines to distress me,
Cesario. I sent to the Signora Calva
after you left me yesterday, that I might

intreat her to charge herself with the
dreaded disclosure; to my mother. I
learnt to my surprise and mortification,
that she is gone into the country for an
indefinite time. How I wept when they
told me this! I dreaded such a scene
with my mother! A convent, and sepa-
ration from all I love, for nineteen
dreary months' Yet I determined to
risk every thing to make you happy, and
force your friend to esteem me. All
that, however, is over ; I was called to
my mother before day-break this morn-
ing, and found her so very ill, that I am
told her life depends upon a breath.
Can I speak to her of myself, of you, of
any one at such a time 2 Tell your
friend, however, that when I may do so
without endangering her life, I am too
anxious to show him that I am not the
weak and worthless thing he thinks me,
to delay the proof a single moment. -
- Farewell. •

After Giovanni had read this letter,
Cesario told him, that he had already
called at the Palazzo Rosso, where he
heard that the Marchesa was even worse
than her daughter had described; her
complaint was inward inflammation.
Giovanni reddened at this information,
ashamed of his first feeling, which had
been doubt of the fact. -
He then proceeded to say what might
be expected on such an occasion; every
thing that could tend to soften Cesario's
concern for the present distress of Bea-
trice, by representing its probable effect
upon the happiness of their future lives.
The Marchesa’s death would at once
emancipate her daughter from control,
and at the same time spare her the pain
of avowing an engagement, made so cul-
pably without her mother’s sanction.

CHAPTER IV.
While the Marchesa continued in dam.
ger, her daughter could not with pro-
priety admit the visits of gentlemen.
The friends were therefore banished from
the Palazzo Rosso for some time. To
Cesario it was indeed banishment, but to
Giovanni it was relief and repose.
He employed himself as usual, actively
and benevolently; dividing his days be-
tween Genoa and the Marino; and giv-
ing to the instruction of Rodolphe every
moment which he could spare from prior
claims.
His confessor, a man of probity and
talent, undertook to teach Rodolphe the
Italian tongue ; and to enlighten his
mind upon spiritual concerns. Giovanni

himself was the Cahet’s instructor in
the every-day occurrences of life; and
to him it was actual happiness to watch
the progress of such a mind. At first,
Giovanni was disappointed in the plea-
sure he had expected to find in the
Cahet, at the sight of public spectacles,
and works of art. Rodolphe only testi-
fied a sort of dull wonder, which quickly
ceased, and appeared to leave no traces.
But in after-times, as the faculty of ob-
servation was roused in him by some
conception of the powers required to
produce what he saw, he expressed more
and more astonishment; showed interest;
looked, examined; understood, admired.
The perfectly ignorant may wonder,
but they cannot admire; to feel the full
value of a discovery in science, or a pro-
duction of art, we must understand the
difficulties which have been conquered;
know the deficiencies which have been
supplied, and the advantages gained.
Thus, Rodolphe's curiosity and plea-

sure increased, in proportion to his
greater acquaintance with the objects
calculated to arouse them; and, mixing
with the multitudes of a great city upon
equal terms, the mere absence of insult
from them, was to him absolute kindness:
all their countenances beamed with be-
nevolence in his unpractised eyes.
Such feelings brightened his own face;
its livid hue, was now fast disappearing;
while his once famished frame began
gradually to assume the fullness and
firmness of health.
He attached himself to Giovanni with
devotion nearly amounting to idolatry;
and, so happy was he made by this, in-
dulgence of his affectionate nature, that
it was only now and then the remem-
brance of Auguste came over him in all
its bitterness, and drowned him in tears.
Yet the less acute remembrance of that
interesting child was stationary in his
mind: mixing with its transports of pre-

sent joy and gratitude, just sufficient
sadness, to soften and to elevate them.
“Do you suppose Rodolphe often
thinks now of his poor little friend!”.
asked Cesario, one day, of Giovanni.
“I can give you a proof that he
does; and I like him the better for it;”
returned Giovanni; “I never take him
out, and he never returns from any place,
without having seen some face which
reminds him of Auguste: there is not a
church in Genoa, where he does not find
some picture of a youthful Jesus or
St. John, which he says resembles what
Auguste was. These pictures are rarely
like one another; so the heart must be
very full of an object, when that object
so possesses the eye.”
Cesario admitted the truth of this re-
mark; for he had as often felt or fancied
resemblances to his lamented father in
heads expressive of benignity and mild-
ness. At the end of a fortnight, the
Marchesa Brignoletti was pronounced

convalescent, and her daughter eagerly
prepared to receive the congratulatory
visits of her acquaintance.
When Cesario and Giovanni presented
themselves, they found her in a circle
with the Signor Calva, imprudently re-
proaching him for having absented him-
self and his wife from Genoa, at a time
when their friendly offices would have
been most welcome.
The Signor well knew, that by these
friendly offices, Beatrice meant the op-
portunity their house afforded her of
seeing the persons there, whom she could
not then receive at her mother’s ; and
he smiled equivocally as he whispered,
on seeing Cesario enter—“It is quite
time to put an end to this business, my
cousin; I have made up my mind:—you
must either get the Marchesa’s consent,
or no more meetings with us. The Sig-
mora and I thought we were doing good,
when we consented to befriend your at-
tachment to yon brave fellow; but I

believe now we had better never have in-
terfered: it will break off, and—you'll
survive it.”
He bowed himself out of the room as
he concluded, leaving Beatrice covered
with confusion, and trembling with vex-
ation. -
What was she to do 2 She thought
her former confidants evidently suspected
the change in her sentiments; they might
impart their suspicions to Cesario; he
would then blaze out into madness; he
would make their engagement and her
inconstancy public; he would prove her
duplicity to her mother; Giovanni would
despise her for all this, and willingly
give the promise, which the other would
exact, of shunning her for ever; or if,
indeed, Giovanni avowed sympathy with
her wishes, the death of one or both
rivals, might be the consequence.
These thoughts flashed through her
mind, as the friends made their way to
her. At first she could hardly speak to

them for agitation. Cesario attributed
this unusual emotion to filial feelings;
and Giovanni, to a heart softened by her
mother’s danger, and to her meritorious
struggle with herself. Willing to show
her that her present conduct was right
and acceptable to him, and that he gave
her credit for the intention she professed
in her letter to his friend, Giovanni’s
manner assumed a soothing air of sym-
pathy; he enquired the particulars of the
Marchesa’s illness, applauded Beatrice
for her dutiful attendance in her sick
chamber; and assured her, in a lowered
voice, that, by persevering in her present
conduct, she would command his respect
and admiration through life.
If Giovanni were too amiable to Bea-
trice, even when repulsive and cold, how
irresistible did he appear, now that he
smiled on her as he did on Cesario—now
that his eyes occasionally rested on hers
with a look of cordial approbation 1
She could scarcely bear those eyes: for,

under all their sweet expressions, her
heart swelled with emotions almost be-
yond control. The love, the brightness,
the dark beauty of Cesario's so lately
extolled eyes, were no longer any thing
to her; all there, which had once beamed
light, was to her blank; the charm was
gone—the passion which had bestowed
that enrapturing charm
How brief, how worthless are all the
affections of a heart, which does not find
its chief delight in contemplating the
moral perfections of its object! for in
virtue only, do we find increasing, un-
sating beauty; in virtue only, do we ask
no novelty -
On the charms of moral beauty, all
mankind agree: her divine lineaments
are to be traced from rules drawn by a
divine hand; and she has only, therefore,
to be seen, to be acknowledged and
adored : but material beauty is a thing
of mere opinion, subject to argument,
unsatisfactory when unconnected with

nobler qualities, and perishable in her
nature. Unite the two; place the di-
vinely-aspiring soul in the mould “made
after God’s own image,’ and we have
the perfection of man. Then, to love
such union—then, to admire the out-
ward type of inward excellence, is natural
and right; and we honour the Creator in
estimating his work. -
Cesario might have observed Beatrice's
imattention to himself, had he not been
too agreeably occupied in remarking the
mutual confidence which he believed was
now established between her and his
friend. To fix that confidence was the
chief object of his present anxiety; after
which, he hoped that Giovanni's kind
counsel would fortify the courage of Bea-
trice ; and that, supported by him, and
prompted by her own wishes, she would
make the trial they proposed of the Mar-
chesa's indulgence.

quiries, nothing particular could pass in
conversation; Cesario, therefore, yielded
to the motion of his friend, and whisper-
ing the wish of finding Beatrice alone, at
an earlier hour the next day, he bade her
adieu !
In their way homewards they encoun-
tered the Prince of Melfi. He was stand-
ing under the portico of a Palazzo in the
Strada Balbi.
“I have news for you, young men,”
he said, holding out a letter: “the Turk
is preparing employment for us all. Sig-
nor Cigala, I hope you are still knight
enough to draw a sword, and dare a cul-
verin, in aid of your former brethren?”
“What means your Highness?” asked
Giovanni, advancing.
“This letter here,” returned the
Prince, “tells me the Sultan Solyman
seriously meditates the siege of your
island—of Malta I mean ; and if we
have any true blood in our veins, there
is not a man amongst us, who will not be

ready, aye rejoiced, to pour it out, in de-
fence of that bulwark of Christendom.”
The Prince thought not of compli-
ment; but Giovanni instinctively bowed
his head at this gratifying testimony to
the order he still loved; and, taking the
letter, he ran hastily over its contents.
It was written by a person whose local
situation stamped his communications
with authority; and the information it
gave, was of a nature to rouse all the
dormant fire in Giovanni’s breast. -
It represented the Sultan in the high-
est state of irritation against the Knights
of St. John, whose ships not only scoured
the Archipelago, but had the boldness to
run under the very guns of the Ottoman
forts. The richest prizes captured by
the Turkish corsairs had been retaken by
those valiant chevaliers; so that, deprived
of their plunder, and insulted in their
very harbours, the Turks were roused
into a determination of exterminating the
whole Order at a blow, Solyman had al-

ready issued orders for the assembling of
troops at the different ports of the Morea,
to be ready for embarkation at the proper
season: he was increasing his fleet, and
had sent privately to demand the aid of
his bashas at Algiers and Tripoli.
All the Mahometan powers, therefore,
were in motion; and it remained for
Christendom to prove that her energies
were equal to the strength of her cause.
“It will be a desperate struggle !” ex-
claimed the experienced Doria, as Gio-
vanni transferred the letter to Cesario.
“Desperate ’’ repeated Giovanni, and
the look which accompanied that word
transformed him into another man ;
“say, a glorious struggle ! Who will re-
main spectator of it?—I would not give
my right to be an actor there, for all
the other distinctions of life P”
“But you are no longer one of the
Order?”
“In my soul, I am,” replied Giovanni;
and again such a brightness spread over
his face, that the prince stood astonished.

“Now I believe all I have heard of
you!” he exclaimed, eying him with a
smile of pleasure. “When I used to
pass you in your walks, or meet you in so-
ciety, and see you so calm, so like a man
of peace and study, I confess it was not
possible for me to conceive that such
had ever been a thunderbolt of war.”
Cesario, who glanced over the whole
letter in an instant, now interrupted them:
he precipitated himself upon Giovanni,
crying out, “I will accompany you.”
He forgot Beatrice, as he embraced his
friend in a transport of generous enthu-
siasm.
“You will go under my orders, I
hope,” said the prince, with good-hu-
mour; “the fleet of Genoa will make
but a sorry figure in the harbour of her
besieged ally, if her best sailors choose to
volunteer fighting on shore.”
“You think then, my prince,” asked
Giovanni, “that, if the Turk persists in
his resolution, Genoa will assist the
Grand Master?”

“Can you doubt it 2" enquired Doria,
“we shall meet before the guns of St.
Angelo, depend on it.” -
“And when may this formidable ope-
ration commence?” asked Cesario, sud-
denly recollecting his bright prospects
of love and felicity.
“The project is but hatching,” replied
Doria, “ and will require time to mature.

cannot be ready before spring. Those

time; and if I could command Spain as
easily as I hope to move Genoa, I’d
scotch the young snakes in their nest.
I’d burn or cripple every galley before
they could assemble into mischief.”
“Ah my prince and rob the brave
, chevaliers of the glory they are about
to gain!”
Doria smiled kindly at Cesario; then
said temperately, “At your age I should

have made the same exclamation; but
I have now lived long enough to know
that the greatest glory a soldier or sailor
can obtain, is to give up a brilliant action,
when the same object may be reached
by a less showy and less dangerous road.
I should like fighting and fame as well as
the youngest of you; but, if I can
prevent the Turk beforehand, my con-
science won’t excuse me if I neglect it.”
- While this short dialogue was passing
between the prince and his officer, Gio-
vanni was musing upon the probable
effect of the present conversation on his
friend’s destiny. He now repented the
precipitancy with which he had urged
Beatrice to declare her engagement,
since it was likely that circumstances
would remove both friends for a period
long enough to shake even her latest
attachment. But who may foresee events?
At any rate, he thought, “I have gained
one salutary point, -she is awakened to
some emulation of nobler character.”

“And why should not my friend ac-
company me, when I go to Malta?” he
asked suddenly, anxious to remove Ce-
sario, as soon as possible, from the circle
of Beatrice’s enchantments. “I will
pledge myself to yield him up to you
and his duty, the moment the fleet of
the republic appears off our island:
meanwhile, why may he not share in
whatever is going on at Il Borgo?”,
“I see no objection to it,” replied the
prince; “but what says Adimari himself?”
My sons tell me that there is a certain at-
traction in a certain quarter—which—”
Cesario's colour deepened into crim-
son; he cast down his eyes in some con-
fusion, while stammering out a few
words of faint denial.
“Come, come, young man,” resumed
Doria, “I am neither your confessor nor
your judge; but if I can be your ad-
vocate (not with the fair lady, for there
you don't want one of course,) but with
her relations, I am heartily at your ser.

vice. My years and name, perhaps,
might have influence.”
“O my prince!” exclaimed Cesario,
seizing his hand, and incapable of utter-
ing more. Giovanni foresaw the agi-
tating scene which must follow ; and
giving Doria a sign, they turned from
the portico into the garden of the Pa-
lazzo. There, secure from observation,
the warm-hearted Doria repeated his
offer of service; and enquired the extent
of Cesario's addresses to the Signora
Brignoletti.
When he heard of their actual engage-
ment, he showed much surprise. “Her
mother, certainly, is far from suspecting
it!” he said; “the lively Signora has con-
trived to make her believe that she listens
to your enamoured complaints, only to
laugh at them. The Marchesa has re-
peated to me several excellent bons mots
of her daughter about you. By the
mass this young lady would make a
capital politician: however, I conclude

stratagems are as fair in love as in war;
so we'll not be too nice. As I have always
had some weight with the Marchesa, I
will do my best to make her favourable,
You are noble, if her daughter be rich—
you are brave, she beautiful: in my
mind the thing is suitable enough. What
shall I do?—speak to the Marchesa, or
take counsel with the daughter first?”
Giovanni undertook an answer to this;
for Cesario, struck with what the prince
had said unreflectingly, was standing
silent, astonished and mortified.
It was Giovanni's opinion, that the
prince should at once see and speak with
the Marchesa, when her health would
permit; that of course he should use the
only argument the case allowed, Cesario’s
noble birth and rapidly-rising honours.
But perhaps for the lady's sake, it might
be as well merely to say, that his young
friend had every reason to hope his con-
stancy and character had distinguished
him in the Signora's eyes above her other

admirers; and that what Cesario now
sued for, was but permission to declare
his passion in the world, as one not
forbidden by the Marchesa; after which
he would hasten to win honours, ere
he would venture to ask the hand of,
Beatrice.
“So here I have plunged all at once
into a love-affair!” exclaimed the frank-
hearted prince: “at my age it is almost
ridiculous. I could mot—I would not
do more for one of my own boys: and
let me tell you, Adimari, I am half in-
clined to make it a quarrel between us,
that you have not considered me as a
father in this business. You have fallen
in love, and given up coming to see me;
and I should never have known more of
the thing than what common report said,
had Inot, by some odd chance, taxed you
with it myself.” - -
“I confess my fault!” replied Cesario,
respectfully, yet fervently kissing the
hand then extended to him; “but to

talk of Beatrice to any one but a friend
of my own age, (glancing at Giovanni;)
and besides, I knew Your Highness had
concerns of your own.“
“Aye, aye!” interrupted the prince,
with a sigh which he hemmed away :
“some of my children find me work
enough. You may thank the heart-aches
which one of them often gives me, for
the high, high value Iset upon character
and conduct. They are worth all the
titles and riches in the world. Parents
may think themselves happy when their
children set their hearts upon persons
who have no other fault than want of
money.” - - -
The veteran's care-furrowed brow
clouded as he spoke, and his kindly eyes
suffused. . . .
Giovanni, who had heard the family-
circumstances to which he alluded, was
respectfully silent.
Rumour said that the eldest Doria was
privately married to an infamous crea-

ture, who had not only been his mistress,
but was notorious from a former con-
nection of that sort with the most pro-
fligate cardinal at Rome; and the brave
father contemplated, with bitterness, the
prospect of all his honours (honours so
mobly won) descending to the children
of such a disgraceful union.
He had to lament, also, this son’s ruin-
ous habit of deep play; a habit into
which he had been led by intimacy with
a foreigner of high rank but sordid prin-
absent on a state mission) was eminently
qualified to increase the lustre of the fa-
mily, that circumstance seemed to sharpen
the father's pangs. In truth, he could
not forbear regretting that the rights of
primogeniture were unalienable: he could
not always suffocate a murmur, when he
looked on the brightness of his own and
his uncle's fame, and saw the black
eclipse with which it was threatened by
his eldest born.

But how often do we witness these
equal distributions of Providence! where
the one scale is so overflowingly filled
with distinctions and prosperity, disgrace
and disunion too often weigh down the
other
Cesario's quick sensibility was moved—
he thought of his own father, whose
slightest wish had ever been the law of
his life; the image affected him; so that
he could not refrain from once more
taking Doria’s hand, and giving it the
pressure of respectful sympathy.
The veteran wrung his in return, and
smiling cheeringly, said, - “Well—you
must let me know when I should ask
for an audience of the Marchesa: your
fair mistress will of course give you the
earliest intimation of her mother’s com-
plete recovery. Meanwhile, go home
and think of your crusade. Make up
your mind on that subject; for, if it
comes to any thing, you must apply of
ficially for leave.”

“I shall go back immediately to the
Palazzo Rosso,” said Cesario; “if I can
see Beatrice for five minutes only — go
with me, Giovanni — no, stay — I had
better see her alone: she will be so over-
come—so overjoyed at being relieved
from this trying confession to her mo-
ther. How I bless this fortunate ex-
‘planation for her sake! — The prince's
gracious arguments in my favour will
have smoothed at least part of her
difficulties.” ... •
He was hurrying along as he spoke,
and, having reached the gate by which
they had entered, darted into the street.
Giovanni accompanied the prince to
the door of his own residence; con-
versing, as they went, upon the subject
most important to them, the expected
invasion of Malta. -
Having discussed it in all its forms,
they separated; the one, to return into
family-cares, and the other to wait for
the re-appearance of his friend,

CHAPTER V.
CesARIo came back disappointed: the
Signora Brignoletti was in her mother's
oratory at private mass, and could not
be disturbed. But he had returned home,
written, and given a letter for her to her
page; in which he briefly recapitulated
the events of the morning, and requested
her to allow him a meeting at vespers, in
the church of San Siro, after her usual
attendance there.
Never had Giovanni seen him in such
a tremor of spirit: Cesario called him-
self intoxicated with joy and hope; he
believed himself so; yet was there a trou-
bled expression in his countenanee, which
showed that all was not as he wished
within.
- I5

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 83
In truth, there was a something rank-
ling there — a trifle; — but it was a
stinging trifle; and it pressed upon the
most sensitive nerve of his character—
its pride.
The Prince of Melfi had said, that
Beatrice had made her mother believe
Cesario was the object of her ridicule.—
In Cesario's eyes this was a mortal sin: –
it would have been so to any delicate
mind; and he judged rightly, when he
thought, that the woman who truly loves,
would almost as soon profane sacred sub-
jects by irreverent speech, as breathe or
endure one contemptuous breath against
the object of her affections. He, to
whom she hopes to vow love and obedi.
ence for life; he, whose will is to be her
law and her delight; must be, in her es-
timation, the noblest of his kind, or her
love and her submission will prove but
visions of the fancy.
Cesario tried to banish this recol-
lection, but it returned again and again;
E-6

and at last he had no other refuge than
in the hope that the prince had mistaken
the Marchesa. -
He now repented the proud feeling
which had withheld him from asking
Doria to explain himself further on this
subject; yet while repenting his pride
them, he was now yielding to the same
infirmity, and debarring himself the com-
fort of Giovanni's probable better know-
ledge in her favor.
Giovanni, however, was too clear-
sighted not to know what troubled his
friend’s transports: he forebore from re-
marking it: cheering himself with the
hope that this dissatisfaction with Bea-
trice, might lead to that perfect ac-
quaintance with her selfish insincerity,
which must finally cure his infatuation.
Upon Giovanni himself, this new light
acted like a blessed charm. He saw
Beatrice as she really was ; light, hollow,
ungoverned either by principle or reason;
artful, even in the very tempest of the
1 I


## p. 85 (#95) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 85
passions: a character, in short, which
was rapidly approaching the most start-
ling lengths, solely from its deficiency
of self-government.
Thus she, who began with innocence,
might easily be led to end in crime: and
Giovanni felt with a shudder, that it was
in his power to bring her to that horrid
point.
So impressed, he found it a difficult
task to speak of Beatrice as her lover's
present state demanded; but the subject
of Malta fortunately was now so con-
nected with that of Beatrice, that he
soon succeeded in engaging Cesario's at-
tention from her, and arousing him to
that lively impatience for noble action,
which was the natural bent of his soul.
On this day, Cesario watched the set-
ting sun with peculiar anxiety: — he
watched the purple twilight till it deep-
ened into its last solemn shade, and then
he darted out. -
He found the principal streets thronged
w

with people. — The relics of some saint
were carrying in procession from a church
in the city to one beyond the walls; and
he could scarcely get along through the
crowd of priests and nuns, the long train
of light of whose torches, was seen blazing
over the dark mass of rabble behind.
Their sweetly-solemn chant was un-
heard by him; and but for the interrup-
tion their procession gave to his eagerness,
perhaps he might not have seen them; so
intent was he upon his principal object.
He pushed forwards, regardless of every
thing; afraid that Beatrice might be de-
terred by this very crowd from attending
vespers. On reaching the cathedral, he
was agreeably disappointed; for he not
only found the Signora there, but saw.
the church was nearly empty. Almost
every one had left it to join the pro-
cession. -
As the service was not quite concluded,
he stood at a little distance from the spot
where Beatrice was saying her last prayer;

and his eye, after one fond glance at her
kneeling figure, turned to fix upon the
monument of his father.
The scene; the situation; the mixture
of transport and dissatisfaction which was
swelling his breast; the recollection of
all that he had enjoyed, during his fa-
ther’s life, and all he had suffered since
his death; the idea of Giovanni; the pa-
ternal care of Doria; and lastly, Bea-
trice’s insensibility, when she first saw
his father’s monument; every one of
these circumstances pressed upon him
with more than usual force. Some pro-
phetic sadness mingled with regret for
past blessings; and he almost audibly ex-
claimed, “O Beatrice, why am I com-
pelled to feel that there is a want in the
creature I love dearest?”—
A moment afterwards, the small con-
gregation separated; and Cesario, hasten-
ing to Beatrice, led her into a remote
part of the church. -
There they walked long and undis-

/
turbed. Beatrice was veiled from head
to foot; so that, except from the sound
of her voice, it was impossible to discover
her emotions. -
Cesario first recapitulated the friendly
purpose of Prince Doria, together with
his own hopes and wishes; then described
in glowing terms all the glory he pro-
mised himself in serving with the Knights
of St. John ; and at last ventured to de-
clare his condemnation of what had so
keenly pained him. -
Beatrice did not lose the opportunity
this afforded her. During his discourse
she had heard only, that Giovanni was
still as eager as ever to urge on her mar-
riage, or at least the public avowal of
her engagement with his friend: she only
saw Giovanni resolutely flying from her.
Whatever impelled him, whether despotic
principle, or cold indifference to her en-
chantments, Cesario was the cause, and,
as such, Cesario became almost hateful
in her eyes. The idea of marrying him,

even of confessing that she ever wished
to do so, was abhorrent to her mind; and,
bursting into repeated passions of tears,
she reproached him for his honourable
censure of her humiliating artifice with
her mother; declared, he loved her no
longer as he had done; that she never
would marry one who could make so un-
grateful a return for an innocent deceit
practised from tenderness for him; and
finally, in a tone of distraction, protested
her resolution of shutting herself up from
the ungrateful world in a convent.
At first, Cesario yielded to her storm
of indignation; for he thought it but a
storm, brief as violent, and excusable,
perhaps, in one whose heart, he fondly
fancied, meant right, even when her
judgment led her wrong.
But Beatrice was not to be softened,
either by his silence, his submission, or
his weak pleadings; he had unwarily
given her an argument for breaking with
him, and she therefore resented this first

rebuke of his, with a violence which ar-
gued ill for his lawful rule over her,
whenever she should endow him with a
husband's authority.
At this moment, however, the amazed
and agonised Cesario thought of nothing
but the frightful possibility of losing her
affections: he conjured her, in the name
of their former confidence, to recal her
cruel threat; to remember how he had
loved, how idolised her; to think what
distraction must follow if she persisted
the name of that father, whose memorial
stood before them—that father, for whom
she alone was an equivalent, not to de-
stroy at one stroke all the promise of his
youth ; not to condemn him to madness
or self-destruction.
Beatrice was inflexible : she broke
from his arms, as he threw himself dis-
tractedly at her feet, trying to clasp her
knees; and calling to her page without,
she hurried into the street.

Her disappearance roused the lover
from his trance : he started from his
ignoble posture; indignation kindled in
him hike sudden fire, while, with a heart
which might be said actually to burn, he
rushed out of the church.
His looks and manner, when he entered
with Giovanni, scarcely needed explan-
ation. He threw himself into a seat with
a look in which the fire of outraged
love was, alas, quite gone out! He was
now pale and haggard.
“It is past—gone!—gone!—” he
exclaimed. “She is implacable.”
The last words astonished Giovanni,
who rather expected to hear that she had
made some half confession of her altered
feelings.
-“Implacable P’ he repeated, “in what
have you offended her?” -
Cesario hurried out an explanation;
but it was so often broken by his pas-
sionate bursts of anguish and self-blame,

that it was long ere Giovanni could col-
lect the particulars.
This truest of friends could almost
have ejaculated a thanksgiving for so
critical a turn in the conduct of Bea-
trice; but when he looked upon the dis-
tracted figure of the man whom he
cherished with a brother’s tenderness,
his heart melted into sympathy. He ap-
proached him, and by every affectionate
art sought to assuage the acuteness of
immediate suffering.
The end Giovanni foresaw and re-
joiced in; he foresaw that Beatrice would
at last completely unmask herself, and
that Cesario would escape so unworthy
an union. In the tumult and anxiety of
war, he hoped his spirit might find that
lively interest without which a heart like
his, must lose all relish for life. Could
he be brought to endure his present de-
solation of soul but for a certain period,
after that, his recovery from a passion he

would then begin to blush at, would be
certain. - -
Giovanni himself had experienced this:
he had gone through every stage of pain
and amendment, which they must pass
through, whose affections have been fixed
either on a fickle or a deceitful object;
and he knew, therefore, better than most
men, what arguments to use with Ce-
sario. - -
It was no longer his duty to direct his
friend's attention to the Signora's faults;
it was rather his province to hold off part
of that heavy weight of disappointment
which must at last fall on him, and which,
coming suddenly, might crush him at
once. He made light of Beatrice's anger;
represented it as the wrath of an indulged
child, which, if it had no root in the heart,
could not have outlived the instant of its
utterance. . . . .
“Surely,” he said, “Cesario could
not imagine her seriously, deliberately
resolved on punishing him with such

rigour for having uttered an unwelcome
truth; and yet continue to think her
worthy of love and regret?” .
Cesario felt that he ought not to regret
her if it were so —but that he would
not! – Who that has ever loved, and
ever felt or fancied unkindness from the
person beloved, who in such circum-
stances could have replied sincerely!
Giovanni's affectionate soothings by
degrees restored Cesario to himself: he
yielded to that cheating confidence in
the character of Beatrice which had so
fatally ensnared him hitherto; and sud-
denly recollecting the facility with which
she pardoned Giovanni's unqualified cen-
sures and unsubmitting firmness, he ex-
claimed,—“Oh, she will pardon me — I
had forgotten her generosity to you.”
Giovanni turned away his face without
speaking. It was not his wish to give a
false colour to Beatrice, he was only
solicitous to spare Cesario the complete
shock of disappointment; and he endea-

voured, therefore, to separate approbation
of her conduct from assurances of his be-
lief that her resentful resolution could
not continue; if, indeed, her attachment
had ever deserved the name of an affec-
tion. - |
Cesario was not in a mood to scrutinize
phrases; these guarded expressions, there-
fore, went unnoticed by him. He passed
from one violent emotion to another, and
saw nothing distinctly but the images of
former happiness.
From each of these, he not only drew
arguments for reliance upon Beatrice, but
reasons for regarding her more fondly.
Instances of former devotedness to him, of
disinterested, generous, what he thought
self-sacrificing love, rose before him, and
filled his heart with a transport of tender
gratitude. He magnified the idols of
rank and riches only that he might find
Beatrice admirable in having despised
them for his sake; yet, had he questioned
his own heart, how pitiful would such a

sacrifice have seemed to it, if required
as a proof of its devotionſ
While Giovanni listened to this torrent
of delusions, he was wrung with com-
passion; and, conscious how soon all must
change into bitterness, he felt it harder
to command his feelings now, than when
he saw Cesario actually in the grasp of
misery. -
At a very late hour they parted; Gio-
vanni, to lead the devotions of his house-
hold; and Cesario, to resign himself to
the idea of an earthly object, little cal-
culated to draw him on to nobler medi-
tations.
The next day carried the friends to
the Palazzo Rosso: the Marchesa was
not risen, and her daughter was there-
fore mistress of the next hour.
She received Cesario in that cabinet
which has for two centuries since, been
the admiration of Europe. Giovanni de-
clined entering till the first embarassment
of their meeting should have subsided.

It was not long ere he was called in. ,
“Giovanni!” exclaimed Cesario on
his entrance, “now do I demand all the
succours of your friendship!—help me
to understand Beatrice — to understand
myself—what is it I have done? — am I
indeed deserving?— think for me—
judge me—for I can no longer think.”
— He struck his forehead with his
clasped hand as he spoke, and looked
wildly round, as if indeed under the in-
fluence of temporary madness. . .
Giovanni stood where this address had
arrested him, and fixing his eyes on Be-
atrice with an air of severe virtue, said
firmly, “You do not mean me to under-
stand that the Signora can, upon reflec-
tion, persist in her senseless anger of last
night?” *
“Yes!—she renounces me—she will
not forgive—she refuses ” Cesario's
frantic and disjointed answer was inter-
rupted by Beatrice, who put aside her

at Giovanni, exclaimed, -
“Do not you condemn me, Signor
Cigala; I am sick of the world, and am
determined to leave it. O do not think
I would pain your friend, if my own per-
petual misery were not—”
“ Perpetual misery!” echoed Cesario,
“what do I hear?—some demon in
the shape of a 'confessor, I suppose,
has terrified her with preposterous threat-
enings; and now she fancies it piety to
renounce me. —
“Giovanni! you that are skilled in
all the learning of the schools, talk to
her; convince'her'that it is not a work
to gain heaven by, that 6f breaking a
fond and faithful heart!” -
Cesario's voice was choked by a thou-
'sand melting feelings, and walking into
‘the other apartment to recover himself,
he 'gave Giovanni a few moments for
unrestrained speech. * - -

grasping the wrist of Beatrice, “in the
name of God I adjure you, act fairly
with my friend in this last struggle be-
tween his faithful and your estranged
heart! Act without artifice; and as yot,
hope for mercy in your dying hour, be
just to him: to delude him on, is to
cheat him of his youth—of all that ar-
dent youth, prompts him to pursue and
win. Have the courage, to be hated by
him; - if you adolindeed no longer love
him, tell him so, and set him free; I
then will be his anchorage. My heart
wants nothing but friendship.”
“Oh barbarianſ” exclaimed the dis-
tracted Beatrice, catching his arm as he
turned away, “gentle to severy other
creature, harsh, cruel, merciless to me
only Why will you thus wring from
me, what shame—?” Aburning blush
covered her face as she broke off; and
the very action, of awerting her eyes
said more than if she had looked on
him.

Giovanni shook her off, as he would
have done a serpent; and, springing into
the apartment to which Cesario had re-
tired, he took hold of him.
“Let us go,” he cried, with the com-
mand of a superior being; “this is no
place for you; I cannot move her.”
Cesario would have resisted, but there
was a strength in Giovanni's grasp which
defied resistance, and ere the former was
aware of it he found himself in the open
street. - -
During the first hour of their conver-
sation, Cesario's despair mastered his
reason: he raved alternately against Be-
atrice's unkindness, Giovanni's fastidious
observation of her, and his own folly in
acting by the advice of one so prejudiced.
Giovanni gave the storm way, till, ex-
hausted by his own violence, Cesario
sunk into speechless dejection. - -
It was then that his friend began, with
the tenderest care, to prepare his mind
for a final separation from this too-fondly

cuss the nature of true courage, which is
better displayed by enduring misfortune
nobly, than by contending victoriously i
the field.
He reminded him of his father’s me-
mory, and of his own fair fame; he en-

assuring him, that each foregone gallant
action was an additional pledge to his
country of future services.
... He tried to re-awaken in him that
honourable ambition which seeks distinc-
tion by the path of usefulness; and, if he
ventured to speak of his own conduct
under similar disappointment, he did it,

ness is attainable, after the loss of one,
whom, however we may have prized, we
must eventually contemn.

more to shake her purpose; if her reply

were still inexorable, he recommended
him then to quit Genoa with him.
While he described the characters of
several individuals of the order for which
they hoped to draw the defensive sword,
and enlarged on the spirit-stirring scenes
in which they might so soon be engaged
together, he communicated a momentary
enthusiasm to Cesario: the eyes of that
unhappy young man kindled with all their
former fire, but that fire lasted not; and
he sank again into lifeless despondency.
“I will at least have one triumph over
her!” he said, after a long and dismal
silence,—“the world shall never know
her cruelty. It may continue to believe
that I was a presumptuous fool — that
she never loved me!”—He sighed as if
his heart were rent in twain by the sigh,
and relapsed into a gloomy reverie.
Giovanni's entreaties that he would
rouse himself, brought him out of this
trance of despair; he seized a pen and
wrote to Beatrice. -

He wrote long, and wildly, but in the
midst of lamentation, and complaint, he
declared his purpose of accompanying
his friend immediately to Malta, assuring
her, that beyond the loyal, breast of that
friend, and the Prince of Melfi, the se-
cret of her professed attachment to him
should never transpire: that he was then
going to exact from the prince, a promise
of that sort, which would, leave. Beatrice
to bestow herself, uncensured, by the
world, upon some happier man than him
who had loved her only too well.
Giovanni could not condemn any part
of this letter; its generosity affected
him; and he dispatched it, though nei-
ther hoping nor wishing that the foolish
Beatrice, might be moved by its pas-
sionate pleadings.
The answer was such as he expected
— embarrassed and agitated; evidently
written under a humiliating sense of
shame, which she strove to cover by con-
fused allusions to her duty as a daughter,

by resentment of Cesario's displeasure
at what she called the strongest proof of
her regard, and by declarations of her
inclination for a religious life.
She concluded with a prayer for Ce-
sario's happiness and honour; and repeat-
ing her resolution to take the veil, bade
him an etermal farewell.
Even till this moment Cesario believed
himself entirely convinced that his situa-
tion was desperate, but he now found
that some hope had glimmered through
all that darkness; this letter extinguished
it : this selfish, unrelenting, ungenerous
letter, — when he closed it, he felt as if
his heart were withered for ever. : :
He remained sitting where he had
read it, with his eyes fixed upon the
vellum; though he no longer took cogni-
sance of the characters, he heard the
voice of Giovanni uttering, at times, a
few words of courage and comfort. . . .

again, before the unhappy young man
regained any consciousness to things
around him : when he did so, he re-
covered himself with a heavy sigh, and
laying his chilly hand on the arm of
Giovanni, said, with a wintry smile,
“Let us go now, Giovanni—let us
leave Genoa together—if you can bear
with such a wretch as I am.”
Giovanni's reply was an embrace full
of his afflicted soul. Cesario rather
yielded to, than returned it; but ere he
rose from the neck of that incomparable
friend, he gave him one convulsive, ex-
pressive pressure, and sighing again from
the very depth of his heart, left him for
solitude and struggle.

CHAPTER VI.
WHEN they met next, it was not to talk
of Beatrice, for Cesario avoided her
name, but to settle the time and mode of
their departure. *
Cesario confessed his eagerness to be
gone; but, as Giovanni had many de-
pendants to consider, and arrangements
to make, in case he never might return,
it was not possible for him to depart so
suddenly.
He was, besides, under obligation to
assist at the celebration of a marriage
which he had made between a ward
of his father’s and the heir of a noble
family. -

necessities which the world imposes upon
us: one of those cases when we cannot

assign our reason for a disinclination to
do what the world expects from us, in
compliance with its usual forms.
The public service upon which he was
going to volunteer, did not require his
immediate presence; and his private rea-
son (a heart aching for his friend) was
not to be given in consideration of the
Brignoletti family. It was therefore
painfully incumbent on Giovanni to ap-
pear through all the ceremonies and fes-
tivities of these nuptials; and it was
agreed between them that Cesario should
go to Civita Vecchia, and wait there the
arrival of his friend; after which, they
were to embark together for Malta,
A letter of gratitude, and respect, and
affection was the only return Cesario
could make to the warm-hearted Prince
of Melfi. He had not fortitude to sup-
port a personal leave-taking with the man
whom he had last seen when his brightest
hopes were shining. He claimed secresy
from the prince, with relation to Beatrice;

and pledging himself henceforth to de-
vote his whole heart to glory, he prayed
His Highness to grant him that leave for
accompanying Giovanni to Malta, which
he so lately promised. . . .
Doria's reply was written with kindly
indulgence to the first disappointment
of an ardent nature. He commended
his resolution of seeking forgetfulness of
a capricious mistress, even “at the can-
non’s mouth;” and, enclosing him the
official permission he asked, bade him
adieu. - . . . . -
Cesario had little more to do after
this in Genoa. The friendly kinsman,
under whose roof he dwelt, regretted,
but could not blame his eagerness to seek
military employment. “Arms are his
profession,” thought the Syndic, “ and
if we mean to advance in any way of life,
we must not stand still.” With this
Sagely self-evident proposition, he gave
Cesario his parting benediction, coupled
with the hope of soon seeing him return.

* Cesario would not trust himself with
a sight of his father's monument: yet,
twice he went to San Siro, twice he put
his foot upon the threshold, and as often
turned away in a paroxysm of bitter re-
collection. It was in that church, near
that very monument, Beatrice had first
condemned him to despair! How then
could he bear to look on it 2
But his filial heart recompensed itself
amply in the chapel at the Marino.
There, where the actual remains of that
dear father reposed, he gave way to every
tender recollection; and felt himself once
more all the son.
“O, that I had never loved aught but
thee!” he cried in bitterness of soul, as
he embraced the cold marble which
covered that sainted dust. He forgot
Giovanni at that moment; but in the
phrenzies of betrayed love, even friend-
ship is forgotten.
Cesario left Genoa on the very day of
Giulio Carega's marriage, with the ward

of Giovanni; and though proposing soon
to follow, his friend contemplated with
distaste, nearly amounting to disgust, the
mask and supper at which he must appear
in the evening. Mirth, indeed, is mock-
ery to “a mind diseased.”
Giovanni saw, with regret, that Cesario
went not in such utter desolation of soul
as he professed to do: for Giovanni
knew how fallacious was the hope which
began again to cheat that sanguine spirit;
and aware that his friend’s future peace
was only to be purchased by total despair
now, he would not fan a kindling hope
by one breath of indulgence.
He spoke to Cesario of Beatrice, as of
one cut off from him for ever by her own
unjustifiable act; he called on him, there-
fore, to show his attachment had been
grounded on the belief, at least, of ex-
cellence in her; and he conjured him to
recollect by what a degrading artifice she
had prevented her mother's interference
with their engagement.

* This last argument was the deadly
probe: so sensitive was Cesario's wounded
delicacy, that he scarcely endured the
salutary point of that probe, even from
the apprehensive hand of friendship.–
Starting at that part of the subject, with
a look which convinced Giovanni that he
must not press it again, and stifling a
throb of momentary resentment, Cesario
seized his friend’s hand, wrung it in both
his, burst into an agonised groan, and
departed.

chanically) to the Syndic’s; but there
was nothing there to detain him—no
letter, no message | When he found
himself actually on the road from Genoa,
and became convinced that Beatrice
would not recall him, his amazed senses
nearly deserted him. He was tempted
to ride back, go to her, implore her, die
before her . To live without her, he be-
lieved impossible; but yet it was easier
for him to die, than to bend his insulted

fended her.
Neither pride nor principle would let
him do otherwise than assert his dis-
pleasure at the stratagem by which she
blinded her mother. That she could
have mocked his love, and ridiculed its
pretensions, was something so gross, so
unworthy, so incompatible with the idola-
try of true attachment, that he never
thought of it without indignation.
Contrition, indeed, might have effaced
that hateful impression of art and indeli-
cacy; but Beatrice had defended her
conduct, and braved his anger: and
where was he to find security, if the wife
to whom he confided his honour, were
guided by such pernicious policy?
As these reflections crowded on him,
Cesario's paroxysm of relenting fondness
died away: but again, and again it re-
turned. He granted something to her
pride, and more to maidenly modesty:
perhaps she wished to recall him, yet was

restrained by these two motives (motives
generally termed honourable to a woman
so circumstanced); perhaps even now
she was given up to greater despair than
he was: —for how passionately did she
once return his affections! .
If she had really ceased to prefer him,
why should she express such a distaste to
life? why should she not remain in the
world, enjoying the bright season of her
youth and beauty 2 why should she seek
to fly other admirers?—but if she were
only chilled to him by resentment of his
supposed offence, and consequent doubt
of his affection, why then her tenderness
must return with the conviction of his
truth. -
Cesario was amazed that he had never
seen the subject in this light before ; he
even wondered that Giovanni had not
urged it on him. Certain facts spoke
for themselves : Beatrice had not shown
favour to any other man; and she was,
in the very May-morning of life, with

all its golden prospects before her, going
to immure herself in a convent}
So instantaneous a blaze of hope
blinded Cesario to every thing else: he
now saw but one object—the blissful re-
union to which it directed him; and, all
Beatrice's errors forgotten, all his own
feelings, all Giovanni's reasonings, he
determined to throw himself upon the
good offices of Signor Calva,
With this purpose, and already aban-
doned to the utmost joy of his sanguine
nature, Cesario changed his route, and
gallopped to the country-house of Bea-
trice’s cousin.
He found the Signor at home, but his
wife was at Genoa. Cesario’s errand was
soon told ; after which Signor Calva,
having first professed his readiness to
serve him, took the liberty of questioning
him upon several particulars. He testi-
fied peculiar curiosity about all that had
passed between Cesario and his friend on
the subject of Beatrice; at each detail

making some significant motion of the
head or shoulders.
Signor Calva was one of those good.
natured, well-meaning persons, who see
parts of a subject very clearly, but have
not discernment enough to take in the
whole of any. He judged every event
and character by common rules; and, as
his measure could not stretch to any
thing beyond the ordinary standard of
human conduct, he was, consequently,
sometimes mistaken.
The character of Giovanni Cigala en-
tirely passed the bounds of his compre-
hension; so that he more readily im-
agined his friendship failing before the
seductions of youth and beauty, than a
well-educated young woman, like the
Signora Brignoletti, shamelessly breaking
from one lover to woo another.
The Signor’s principles were not so
nice, or so consistent, as to condemn
with the same severity the same conduct
in different persons. If a man's vices, or

a woman's frailties, did not injure either
his honour or happiness, he considered
them, as every-day matters. Thus, he
could be very indignant at one particular
action, and yet tolerate the performer
of it. In short, he resented or excused
every dereliction from high principle,
just so far as it affected himself or his
friends. He thought he had reason to
think Giovanni no longer true in one
point to Cesario, and that falseness he
believed it right to detect: but he never
suspected that by asserting this, he was
doing more than accusing Giovanni of
some mere natural frailties; he was pro-
nouncing him to be one of the most
odious impostors that ever cheated under
the mask of virtue. s
Believing Cesario more the dupe of
his friend, than of his mistress, yet im-
agining him deceived by both, he thought
it an act of good-nature to show him the
double imposition; and, by that warning,
afford him an opportunity and motive for

being beforehand with the dissemblers,
by breaking with the lady, and treating
his rival with the contempt he merited.
In this feeling he spoke; meaning well,
acting ill. - - - -
Oh! the responsibility we take on
ourselves, when we attempt to shake
the confidence of another! Long should
we ponder on it, widely should we sur-
vey every part of the character we are
about to make an object of suspicion
Which of us, indeed, dare give our own
conjectures in the place of facts? . . . .
Signor Calva had but his own imper-
fect observations and hasty fancies to
warrant him in what he thought; yet he
rashly uttered those thoughts, and laid
waste two hearts which were lately all
affection and trust. :
“So, it was Signor Cigala who first
advised you and Beatrice to acknowledge
your mutual engagement to the Mar-
chesa?” he observed, drily : “the con-
sequence he must have foreseen—the

Marchesa's prohibition of her daughter's
intercourse with you: for, besides other
objections, she would be incensed past
forgiveness by your joint concealment of
it. I cannot admire that part of his ad-
vice: but, perhaps, he calculated upon
keeping up your mutual attachment by
charging himself with your several bil-
lets; for he, of course, would not have
been exiled. Then he does not counsel
you to try your fate again with Beatrice?
He thinks you had better, give her up at
once, and go with him to Malta?—but
he does not go, after all; he remains for
these: marriage-festivities (which I used
to fancy he would despise) at the Carega
Palace.” n
Signor Calva: paused frequently dur-
ing this speech, and looked significantly
at Cesario: he looked still more signifi-
cantly when he concluded it. The heart
of the latter was dull in the science of
suspicion; he read no particular meaning
in the Signor's large round eyes, but re-

plied simply, “He will follow me when
they are over. Giovanni does not coun-
sel me to try Beatrice again, because he
judges her strange conduct with severity,
perhaps I ought to say, with justice. In-
deed, he is so displeased with her, that I
fear he does not wish her to recal me.”
“I believe it,” observed the Signor,
ºmore drily than before. He waited for
some remark from Cesario, but the latter,
absorbed in recollection, not making
any, he resumed.
“And, if I go upon this embassy for
you, Signor Adimari, what terms am I
to propose? Still the avowal of your
engagement, or unconditional submis-
sion ?”
“O, nothing! nothing that can alarm

my life in expectation, so she will but

sario broke off, ashamed of his folly.
Signor Calva rested his hand on his
shoulder, with a mixed feeling of con-
cern for him, and vexation at his cre-
dulity. -
“I am heartily sorry to put an end to
these sanguine feelings of your's,” he
said, “but I really do not believe my
visit to Beatrice would produce any good.
My wife and I have not been stupid ob-
servers: we long ago suspected that her
inclinations had changed their object;
and now we are convinced of it. It was
this suspicion which made us withdraw
from our house in town.” -
“Changed their objectſ” repeated
Cesario, in wild, incredulous astonish-
ment. “You cannot mean it! – What
man does she receive with any dis-
tinction P” -
“What man has she pardoned, again
and again, for doubting the sincerity of

her intentions in your favour?” asked
Calva, in a lowered voice. “What man
has she allowed to rebuke, to control,
almost to govern her ?”
“Ha!” cried Cesario, flashing round
on him, “ have a care, signor!” — and
he grasped the hilt of his sword, as if
instinctively prompted to avenge this in-
sinuation against his friend.
“I have done!” said the signor, some-
what chagrined at what he thought in-
gratitude for his good intentions. “I can
have no interest in it; time will show”—
and opening a trelliced door, he went
out into his garden. .
Cesario stood a moment or two, breath-
less with indignation; then, struck at
once by a multitude of hideous recol-
lections, he rushed after the signor.
“Explain yourself,” he cried; “I de-
mand explanation. What infernal sus-
picion would your words Giovanni

which, in my mind, amounts to proof.-
Have you temper to hear it?” .
“Temper!” ejaculated Cesario, press-
ing his hand tightly on his convulsed
heart, — “Go on, signor.”
Calva sat down on a rustic bench, and
Cesario threw himself beside him.
The former then began to recapitulate
all Giovanni's deep attention to the looks,
words, and actions of the Signora Brig-
moletti during their first acquaintance at
his house; from which time, he said, both
he and his wife had since remarked that
her partiality for Cesario began to de-
cline. **
He then proceeded to describe Bea-
trice's violent agony when she heard the
story of the banditti; and he bade Ce-
sario remember, that her first words, on
recovering from her swoon on that oc-
casion, were, not thanksgiving and joy .
for his safety, but eager enquiry after his
friend. - - .

—but he spoke not. The signor re-

His next argument was drawn from
the strange scene they had all witnessed
between her and Giovanni, at San Pietro
d’Arena; what followed, when Beatrice
and Cesario were afterwards alone toge-
ther, the signor knew not; but he ven-
tured to challenge her lover's recol-
lections of that interview, feeling sure
they would corroborate what he sug-
gested. . -
Cesario’s recollections were now in-
deed beginning to compose: they prest
on him so fast and thick, that he dared
not look upon them. “I cannot remem-
ber I will not think No more

across the path — then, as hastily return-
ing, he besought the signor to proceed.
Calva was now sincerely sorry for what
he had done, and was very unwilling
to proceed; but Cesario's impatience was
so inflamed by opposition, that the
signor, still thinking he was doing a duty,
though an unpleasant one, conquered
what he considered a weakness, and
Went On. -
He had previously drawn enough from
Cesario, to have those additional proofs at
his command, which might be said to
consist in the facility with which Beatrice
yielded to, and the authority with which
Giovanni uttered any counsel or reproof:
her extreme repugnance to the avowal
of her engagement with Cesario, might
be dated from her acquaintance with
Giovanni; and her present notion of
taking the veil could be only the despe-
rate resource of a person resolved not .
to act as she ought, and ashamed of act-
ing as she wished.

few paces, and fell against one of the
trees: he was for some moments quite

consciousness, “that expression of yours

that he has done his best to struggle
against what has conquered greater saints
and philosophers than himself; but he is
flesh and blood, like the rest of us; and
Beatrice's eyes are not to be resisted,
especially when there is love in their
glances.” - -
º “ Madness! torture P’ exclaimed the
frantic Cesario, “I have heard enough,
—but stay—when, said you, they were
to meet?” Signor Calva proceeded, not
only to repeat when, but to detail the
odd chance by which he had discovere
their intended meeting. - - -
That very morning, a woman employ-
ed to make festival habits, had sent by
mistake, a Spanish gypsey’s dress, de-
signed for the Signora Brignoletti, to the
Signora Calva, instead of some other
which the latter lady had ordered.
When this person came to repair her
error, she prayed the signora to keep the
discovery to herself, as the young lady
had sworn her to secrecy; fearing the

indecorum of going to a mask at the
Palazzo Carega, when her mother was
yet but partially recovered.
To Beatrice, indeed, who was drugged
with similar pleasures, this mask could
have but one attraction, the presence of
Giovanni: and who, therefore, could
imagine that any thing but his more than
avowed sympathy with her attachment,
his absolute importunities, could have
led her into the imprudence of going
thus clandestinely, where she must go
without a protector?
The inference was too obvious.
Cesario stood rivetted where this convic-
tion first struck him; in outward appear-
ance he appeared stupefied; but in fact
his thoughts were flying, with the rapidity
of light, from point to point of this
horrid subject; now believing, now re-
jecting every startling circumstance
which made against the fidelity of his
friend. z
“Proof–and proof only!” he said at

last, in a determined voice. “I will see
them together, or I will not believe.
Signor Calva, I thank you for your in-
tentions: from my soul I believe you
mean me well, but you may be mistaken;
and you cannot blame me for resolving
to rely only upon the evidence of my
own senses. If Giovanni be false—if
he has deceived me but in one, the
smallest atom, then is heaven false and
hell true.”
“Well, them, you mean to go to the
Palazzo Carega?” asked Calva: I’ll ac-
company you—our masks will conceal
us, if we choose they shall do so; and
there can be no sin in coming at the
truth by any means.” -
A very short time was required to fix
the necessary arrangement. Signor Calva
now made it a point of honour to sub-
stantiate his accusations; and Cesario
was in that state of feverish impatience
which hurries its unhappy victim on to
the very conviction he dreads to find.

Signor Calva was to join his wife in
Genoa, as he had engaged to do, ere she
left him. He was then to prepare a
mask and domino for Cesario, who was
to accompany him to the Palazzo Carega;
then, they were to separate, and singly
watch the two persons whose conduct
there must stamp or efface their sus-
picions. . . . . . º * , ,
This settled, they parted: Signor Calva

CHAPTER VII.
All the arguments urged by Signor
Calva to prove the mutual understanding
between Giovanni and Beatrice, were
now powerfully supported by Cesario's
own recollections: it explained all Bea-
trice’s inconsistencies, and Giovanni's
austerity,+that austerity which was so
incomprehensible to him. It did not
seem assumed. O that seemed !—there
lay the damning solution of the mystery.
It was plain they had both counter-
feited: Beatrice loved Giovanni, Gio-
vanni loved her. Cesario believed he
could have forgiven him that love, had
he avowed it frankly; but to endeavour
at undermining his attachment to her,
by counterfeiting displeasure at venial

faults; to lay a plot to get him ba-
mished from the Marchesa's house; was
a treachery to which Cesario felt that
not even love, all-powerful as it was
Over his heart, could have made him
subservient.
Yet, was it not possible, after all, that
Giovanni might detest his own frailty,
and determine to refuse the happiness
he must purchase with the life's blood
of his friend. Might not Beatrice, too,
rather resolve to sacrifice her bloom to a
cloister, than plant such a dagger in the
breast she once joyed to reign over ?
Their meeting to-night might be intended
for a last farewell! if so, Cesario might
still retain a remnant of happier days;
esteem of what had once possessed every
affection of his soul. -
Friendship and love were indeed too
strong within him, for one blow, however
violent, to dislodge them. He clung to
this fond fancy, the moment it appeared;
and the romantic wish of proving himself

more generous than his friend and mis-
tress were unkind, happily arose to divide
his heart.
He now determined to see Giovanni
at his own house; there to tell him,
openly, what he knew and imagined of
his smothered passion for Beatrice: he
would then learn how far she returned
that passion, and if entirely, he resolved
to resign her to him. -
Filled with this deceitful idea of his
moral strength, and unconscious of his
own insincerity, Cesario hastened to re-
take the road to the Marino. As he went
along, his busy thoughts pictured the
scene he was about to go through, in a
thousand varieties. Had he reflected on
the nature of those day-dreams, it would.
have awakened him from his trance of
self-delusion: they were prompted by his
secret hopes, as much as by his wishes;
they were all full of high-wrought enthu-
siasm and generous sacrifice. They re-
presented himself in a struggle of agony

and devotedness, and Giovanni, over-
powered by his heroism. They ended,
how 2– by the conquest of principle
over the two hearts which passion had
led astray. Thus, however they began,
they concluded in Cesario's restoration
to the affections of his mistress; and the
sacrifice he meditated, was therefore but
one of those vain visions of impracticable
romance, which, only those indulge, who
know not the tyranny of love, and the
weakness of youth.
The day had been far advanced, when
Cesario encountered Signor Calva; it was
far spent ere he reached the Marino.
Giovanni was not there: he was gone, his
domestics said, into Genoa, purposing to
remain for the mask at the Palazzo Ca-
rega.
Chilled and disappointed, Cesario has-
tened to Genoa. Giovanni was not at
his house even there; he might be al-
ready at the Palazzo Carega; or he might

have gone out, in consequence of a billet
brought him by an unknown person.
Cesario’s false courage was nearly ex-
hausted; and this second check to the
feverish ardour with which he sought ex-
planation, extinguished it at once.
This billet, the servant mentioned,
came most likely from Beatrice. They
were to meet at the Count Carega's. Ah
well ! then there was no self-sacrifice
purposed by either of them; he was to be
the sacrifice.
Crushed at once, all the romantic mix-
ture of struggle and transport with
which he had so lately medicined his sick
soul, vanished like a broken spell: the
wretched Cesario turned, to go, he knew
not whither; and turning, found himself
by the side of Signor Calva.
The Signor, guessing something of his
feelings, uttered but a few words of
friendly salutation, and led him to his.
own residence.

Cesario scarcely spoke during the
interval which elapsed between this
rencontre and the fête at the Palazzo
Carega. -
The Signora Calva, having made one
of the bridal party through the day, ap-
peared not to interrupt, or rather relieve
her husband in his fruitless attempt at
reconciling Cesario to his fate. The
latter was again abandoned to a trance
of rapid, incoherent thought.
Yet, though dead to every other thing,
he heard and registered all that Signor
Calva continued to urge in support of his
destructive opinion : and when the hour
came for joining the lively groupes at the
Palazzo Carega, he threw on his disguise
with breathless eagerness. -”
Many masks were assembled, when
Cesario followed Signor Calva into the
principal saloon of the Palazzo : the bridal
party were easily distinguished by the
fancy and splendour of their dresses:-

Giovanni alone was magnificent with
simplicity.
He wore a suit of pliant amber-coloured
leather, richly damasked with pearls; over
which a loose cloke of azure silk served
but to mark the noble movements of his
figure. . .
He was reclining along the lowest step
of a sort of throne, where the bride was
seated: his head raised, and inclined
back to address her at the moment of
Cesario's entrance, gave, by that action,
a peculiar grace to his whole person.
The benevolent satisfaction of his heart
was diffused over his countenance; yet
was there a sweet heaviness in his eyes,
perhaps more touching than their usual
cloudless serenity. -
Cesario's distempered fancy attributed
this expression to the soft reveries of
love, while in fact it proceeded from
suppressed sorrow for him.
Never before had Cesario examined
his friend's figure with the gaze of jea-

lousy; and never before, therefore, had
he remarked all its symmetry.
“What sorcery blinded me till now !”
he exclaimed, half-aloud, as he stood
gazing on him. “How could I believe
that perfection of manly grace was dead
to the passion he must inspire?— how.
could I suppose, that my wretched self.
might ever bear 'comparison—” He
stopped, overcome with shame at this
humiliating idea; for, was it possible to
lament - the woman, whose heart was
either to be won or lost by mere ex-
terior P - *
His ready heart had an answer for that
also ; it told him, that in character he
was as inferior to Giovann; as in person.
Signor Calva drew near him at that
moment. “Leave me, I pray of you,”
said the latter hastily, ere he could ad-
dress him. “I can scarcely endure my
own thoughts, much less any society. I
would not be shackled.” -
The good-tempered Calva motioned

acquiescence, and mingled with the
crowd. - - - *-
Cesario remained where he left him,
till the increasing influx of masks dis-
turbed his meditations, and obstructed
his view. He then changed his place;
and, during that change, Giovanni es-
caped him.
Cesario looked round in every direc-
tion; but pillars, arches, groupes of sta-
tuary intervened, and Giovanni was no
longer discernible. He then gathered
his large domino round him, and hastened
where he thought it most likely for Gio-
vanni and Beatrice to meet.
He got by degrees through the long
suite of saloons, perpetually stayed and
irritated by the persecutions of the fam-
tastic groupes peopling those superb
apartments. He turned back from the
seventh room, nearly frantic with im-
patience: for no where could he see the
lofty head of Giovanni towering above
others; no where could he discern that

Moresco shawl, with which he was told
the glittering ringlets of Beatrice were
to be disguised.
Had they met? Had they left the
Palazzo together? -
Almost breathless with the rapidity of
his movements, and the torture of his
mind, he was standing in a maze of per-
plexity, when the Signora Calva came up
to him. _*
“I am very sorry,” she whispered,
“ that my husband talked to you of our
wrong-headed little cousin; but now, as
you ought to be convinced, I advise you
to go into the gardens: I saw Signor
Cigala and Beatrice there, by the grotto
of Arethusa, not a quarter of an hour
since.” -
The Signora did not wait reply, and
Cesario was not able to give one. For
a moment or two his limbs failed under
him, and he had to support himself by
catching at a pillar of the orchestra;
but immediately afterwards, new-strung

by despair, he sprang forward, and strug-
gled through the crowd. -
Signor Calva, who was watching him .
from a distance, marked the wild flash-
ings of his eye, as it turned from side
to side, lest the objects he sought should
pass him unseen; and quietly making
his way up to him, he followed unob-
served.
Cesario entered the gardens: they
were partially illuminated; some walks,
however, were left to their own deep um-
brage and the silver moonlight. Through
these darker shades the tremulous gleam
of water was visible, but not a foot was
yet heard to disturb their solitudes.
The other avenues were blazing with
colouredlamps, and thronged with figures:
from those Cesario turned, loathing. He
flew to the grotto of Arethusa; but it
was vacant : he rushed out of it, and
looked round. Before him lay several
open groves and glades, and behind him

a deep shade of sycamores, skreening one
of the lesser entrances.
He stood troubled and doubtful which
path to take. As he paused, he was
startled by the sound of unequal steps
among the sycamores, and the next mo-
ment he heard the peculiar voice of
Beatrice.
“No, Giovanni?” she said, in a tone
of distraction; “I feel now that I never
loved Cesario. I was grateful, and I
pitied him—pitied his misfortunes too.
Would I have done for his sake what I
now do for yours? Oh! be assured I
never loved him.”
At the last words, Cesario uttered a
terrible cry, and rushed forwards. His
hand was on his sword; but in drawing
it, his foot entangled in the folds of his
domino, and, betrayed equally by the
slippery grass and by his own agitation,
he fell to the ground. Doubtless some
other person had interrupted and alarmed

Beatrice; she fled precipitately; and
the uproar of maskers within the gar-
dens, and of lacqueys without, must
have prevented Giovanni from recog-
nising the voice of his friend : for having
first stooped for a bracelet which Bea-
trice had dropped, and which, if lifted by
another, might sully her reputation, he
went out by the same door through which
she had darted to her hired carriage.
Signor Calva, meanwhile, was prompt
in assisting Cesario; but, in doing so, he
had the address to make a sign to one in
the company, who obeyed it by convey-
ing away the sword which caused Cesa-
rio's fall. “Command yourself!” whis-
pered the signor, stooping to his ear,
and forcibly holding on the wretched
young man's mask, which he was on the
point of tearing off. “Be guarded, for
the sake of the Signora's family.” Cesario
ceased at that appeal: he rose from the
ground without speaking, at the same

time impelling the signor forward into
the grove. -
The short path through that mere
skirting of trees led them to an open
door, beyond which they saw the street,
and a throng of pages with flambeaux.
“They must have gone out this way,”
said the signor, as he passed with him
out of the door. -
“And together!” muttered Cesario,
“I will follow to his house.” And he
tried to shake off the arm of his com-
panion. º -
The stifled tone in which he spoke,
had something so portentous in it, that
the signor grasping him more firmly, in-
sisted upon accompanying him wherever
he went.
Cesario contested the point almost
fiercely, but Calva was too resolute in
his determination to be got rid of;
Cesario, therefore, yielded to the impulse
he gave, and went home with him. .
He preserved a gloomy silence, during
VOL. II, H -

146 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
all the signor's exhortations to patience;
and calls on him for a spirited displayof in-
difference on the loss of such a friend and
mistress were unheard. Calva spoke like a
common man, to one but slightly affected
by a common passion: he was used to see
lovers discarded and hearts change; he
was used also to the first burst of jealous
rage; and he dreaded only its first burst.
He was, consequently, assiduous to keep
the rivals separate, till the resentment of
the supplanted, should have time to cool
into contempt. -
Cesario’s share in the conversation
went little beyond an occasional mono-
syllable; condemning himself to the
penance of appearing to listen, in grati-
tude for the signor’s well-intended kind-
ness. In fact, he only heard the irritat-
ing hum of a voice, without yielding
attention to what it uttered.
When he thought he had endured this
long enough for propriety, he rose from
his seat. “ Allow me now to retire,”

he said, commanding his fluctuating
colour for an instant. “I want rest—
to-morrow we may consult together: you
have promised me shelter for to-night.”
The signor was deceived by that air
of composure which persons under the
most violent agony of grief sometimes
assume with the cunning of insanity, to
lull suspicion of their fatal purpose.
He took a light; and having conduct-
ed his impatient guest to a chamber,
repeated his exhortations, and bade him,
good-night. . . . - -
As the signor departed, Cesario shot
the bolt of his door. He listened with
gasping anxiety, till the steps of Calva
were no longer audible : then a wild
and savage joy thrilled through him:
for he was free!—free, to seek the re-
venge his soul thirsted for.
With one spring he cleared the bal-
cony of his window into the garden;
scaled its high wall; and was at the
door of Giovanni's house in the Strada

to take breath. He passed the servant
who let him in, without a question. The
man knew him too well, to give him any
interruption, or to apprehend any thing
from the fierceness and strangeness of his
entry. Cesario, therefore, took the lofty
staircase at a bound, and burst into Gio-
vanni's apartment.
Giovanni was sitting at a table, his
face buried in his hands. His hair was
all disordered, as if the actions of a per-
turbed spirit had scattered its broken

So absorbed was he in painful thought,

such an expression of misery and melt-
ingness in his face; and that face so
wan, that he almost took it for his appa-

rition. He half rose, ejaculating some
pious adjuration.
“Giovanni!” exclaimed Cesario, ap-
proaching him, all bewildered with the
revulsion of feeling which the mere sight
of him, thus sad and alone, had caused.
Giovanni knew then, that it was Ce-
sario; and he was stretching out his hand
to welcome him back, and to demand
the reason of his re-appearance, when he
saw his friend's countenance suddenly
convulsed, and a demon’s frown alter
every feature. -
“ Ha! have I proof again!” he ex-
claimed, precipitating himself upon the
table, and snatching from it the bracelet
which Giovanni had so unfortunately
taken up after it fell from the arm of
Beatrice. * * .
Cesario looked at this bracelet eagerly,
intently; then furiously dashing it on the
floor, and trampling it under his feet, he
cried out, “ There, cursed bauble ! -
defend yourself, false man!” he con-

tinued, rushing upon Giovanni, and put-
ting his hand to his side in search of his
sword. The empty scabbard mocked
his grasp: for he knew not what had
passed in the grove at the Palazzo
Carega. . . . .
His passions were now doubly in-
flamed by disappointed fury, and he
darted his eyes round the room in the
deadly hope of espying some weapon of
offence. - .
At that moment, had Giovanni pos-
sessed ten thousand lives, Cesario would
have thought them all too few to slake
his gasping vengeance: he uttered some
unconnected words of horrid import, ac-
companied by certain wandering move-
ments of the eye and hand, which had an
expression in them even more horrible
than his words. . . .
Giovanni, however, looked at him
awhile with a fearless though afflicted
aspect; then advancing, said,
“What fatal suspicion thus maddens

you?—You suspect me of perfidy, Ce-
sario, and I am innocent; in the name
of God, be less violent, and hear me.”
“I waste no time in words,” exclaimed
Cesario, fiercely repulsing him; “answer
me — did I not see you in the Carega
gardens, this night, with Beatrice? did I
not hear the vows of love pass between
you? did I not hear her declare-
shame on that shameless avowal! Away—
away.”
“Cesario, if these lips, -this heart—”
“. Hence! Mock my blind faith no
longer;—I heard—I heard!—yon brace-
let too,-I have kissed it on her arm a
thousand times!—as you are a knight,
lend me a sword, – here, in this spot,
let us end one or both of us.—I can-
not, and you shall not live beyond this
hour.”
“But hear me, Cesario; and if after
that, you still thirst for my blood, why, it
is yours—all yours. I call Heaven to
witness, (and I will prove it to you,) that

never by thought, word, nor deed, have I
wronged you with Beatrice;—is our
bond of soul to be broken at last by a
woman?—No!—she wrings it from me;
—and now I own, that her persecuting
love, inflamed by my indifference —”
“ Her persecuting love!” repeated
Cesario; “her love!—your indifference!”
and he burst into a withering laugh:
them with a terrible voice, — “ Infamous
liar !” he exclaimed, advancing; he raised .
his hand—was it a blow that fell?
Giovanni's shudder was audible as he
started back : from another hand, that
blow had been the watch-word of death;
but on Cesario, the wretched, misled Ce-
sario, he only turned a look, such a look!
and ere the insult could be repeated,
disappeared.
Cesario remained where Giovanni had
left him, motionless in mind as in body.
He might be said to have forgot himself
to stone for he was only roused by the
entrance of a domestic who came in by

chance. At sight of this person, recol-
lection of what had just passed, flashed
on him; but no longer feeling any of
that devouring passion which demanded
action, he started forward in silence, and
casting round him a haggard look of
amazement at what had happened, rushed
from the scene.

CHAPTER VIII.
* -
THE unhappy Cesario lost all memory of
himself and others, for several weeks after
this. When he recovered his recollection,
he found himself in a convent among the
Appennines, whither he had wandered in
the delirium of despair. -
He looked round and saw a narrow
cell, with a single ray of light admitted
at a narrow aperture; it illuminated four
stone-walls, without other furniture than
a huge wooden crucifix, and the pallet he
lay on.
That ray of light, however, streamed
on the saintly figure of a monk, who sat
by his rugged bed with the sacred volume
on his knee.
Cesario addressed to him the first
rational words he had uttered for several

weeks. The holy man started at the
sound of his voice, closed his book, and
approached nearer; his face was covered
with his cowl, but his breast heaved, and
his hands trembled with kindly sympathy.
He did not speak. * . . .
Cesario addressed him again: the monk
bowed his head, crossed himself, pointed
to his habit, then to heaven, and with-
drew.
Cesario never, saw that monk again.
He was one of the order of La Trappe,
and the rules of that rigid order forbid
all intercourse by speech.
* . Its ministers did enough when they
lifted the sick traveller and bound up his
wounds; to pour wine and oil into them,
in consolation and counsel, was not in
their instructions. . .
* As Cesario recovered, the faded images
of the past were renewed in his mind. He
recollected all that Signor Calva had re-
lated to him, all that he had heard Beatrice
say, and all that Giovanni had asserted:
- H 6

156 THE KNIGHT of St. John.
he added to these recollections whatever
he remembered of the separate conduct
of these two suspected persons.
After this painful act of memory, and
the reflections consequent on it, what a
difference did he find between his regret
of Beatrice and of his friend! Giovanni’s
disaffection rankled sorely in his heart:
the emotion Beatrice excited was perhaps
more tempestuous, but it was neither so
deep nor so enduring. The one grief
came over him in gusts, but the other
penetrated his whole soul with dreariness
and desolation. -
Let it not be understood that in thus
displaying the difference of Cesario's
feelings, I would contemn the legitimate
sentiment of well-grounded honourable
love. I speak not, in his case, of that
sentiment, which, to intimate knowledge
of its object, perfect assurance of her ex-
cellence, and complete security in her
faith, superadds all that is necessary to
distinguish it from friendship, and to join

the vivacity of passion to the durability
of principle. I speak but of that wild
misleading fire, which beauty only kindles,
and vanity and imagination feed, till at
last it seizes upon the heart.
That is the love which, in its bitterest
hour of disappointment, can yet feel that
there are griefs of more exceeding poig-
nancy than its own: and such, though
he knew it not, was the passion of Ce-
sario; such was the grief which he now
found, overpowered by the loss of his
friend. e' -
There is an invincible something in
truth, which no appearances can wholly
conquer. Giovanni's looks, and words,
and actions, returned upon Cesario with
redoubled impression of their sincerity,
every time they did return. The more
he considered the former character and
conduct of his friend, the more monstrous
did his present apostasy appear: but alas,
the longer he reflected upon Beatrice, the
less reason did he find for believing that

her affections had been hardly won from
him by subtle artifice. He thought of
Count Cagliari, once so evidently fa-
voured, then so soon dismissed; and his
heart smote him with compunction.
• They that slay with the sword shall
‘perish by the sword’ — in more ways
than its literal meaning is that awful
threat applicable to the affairs of life!
To endure such a state of doubt was
impossible to Cesario. Better, he thought,
to plunge at once into complete despair;
better to learn that both were utterly
false, than thus linger round the ideas of
a friend and a mistress in agonizing un-
certainty, which was the tempter, which
was the wilful cause of his wide and
irremediable woe.
Cesario had seen Giovanni since that
fatal night in the Carega gardens. Gio-
vanni had offered him explanation and
proof of integrity, and how had he put
it to silence . His blood burned and froze
in his veins. He would now see Beatrice,

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 159
and if she shrunk from his questionings,
why then she was the perfidious one.
Yet, how foul was such an image
Beatrice the deceiver! Beatrice the
wooer! It could not be . The tortured
Cesario relapsed again into weakness and
credulity.
There was happily, however, one recol-
lection of power to dispel the brief illu-
sion; and it came like the malignant
whisper of some envious fiend: this was
the recollection of her artifice with her
mother. . - - -
Unable to bear the frequent recurrence
of this degrading thought; and, perhaps
unconsciously, desirous to learn all that
was necessary to banish her at once from
his heart, he resolved to go back again
to Genoa, and satisfy himself completely.
The ardour of so justifiable a purpose
gave a new impulse to his constitution;
so that, in a very few days from that in
which he first meditated this journey, he
was able to undertake it.

During the period of his convalescence,
he had learned nothing from the gloomy
fraternity by whom he was attended.
They glided before his eyes like noiseless
spectres; and when, at the close of the
day, he passed the burial-ground of the
convent, and beheld each dark figure em-
ployed in digging its grave, his distem-
pered imagination almost fancied that he
was himself a disembodied spirit, and
doomed to eternal dreariness in that
desolate region.
Forbidden to disturb the religious
silence of his sad associates, he tasked
his memory to discover how long he
could have been in his present residence.
The task was vain; for the chain had
been broken by a wild interval of deli-
rium; and all measure of time was thus
lost.
He could but confusedly recollect
having gone from Genoa, without caring
or knowing whither he went; hurrying
from place to place, unmindful of food

and rest, unless forced on him by self.
interested or benevolent persons.
His last consciousness was the act of
sinking down, in a remote solitude, ex-
hausted with fatigue and neglect of
SuStenance.
The remainder of this imperfect history
of himself, he received from the superior
of the convent, just as he departed;
when the holy man used the discretionary
power of speech vested in him by their
rules, to recommend a life of monastic
seclusion to one whom the world had
evidently pierced.
Cesario's heart did not repel the gloomy
exhortation ; but ere he could divorce
himself from life, with all its active duties
and endearing bonds, he felt that a con-
viction of what he now could sometimes
doubt, was absolutely necessary for that
purpose.
After frankly stating his feelings, he
learnt from the superior that he had
been found on the road by a traveller

who brought him to the convent as the
nearest shelter. The monks nursed him
four weeks. -
“What a period!” thought Cesario;
“how much may have happened in it
to finish my despair!”
The venerable father put into his
hand a purse of ducats, which his bene-
volent preserver had left for his use.
Cesario eagerly enquired the traveller's
name. He had not told it, for none had
asked it!
Cesario's heart suffered a momentary
chill: he had once been more proud than
grateful; but events had changed him;
and he felt this generous humanity from
a stranger almost reconcile him to the
world.
Having taken from the purse a few
pieces of gold, sufficient for his fewer
wants, he returned the remainder for
charitable uses, besought the superior’s
benediction, and departed.
It was the end of the carnival, when

Cesario re-entered Genoa; and, as if to
mock his misery, all was mirth and pa-
geantry. -
As he proceeded along the Strada
Nuova, he saw but one house dark and
silent; it was the Palazzo Rosso. The
Palazzo Rosso a blank, when all others
were light and gaity | What could have
befallen its inhabitants 2–his ill-boding
heart was busy with the images of Bea-
trice and Giovanni.
With hasty, but faltering steps, he pre-
sented himself at the gates. A servant
whom he did not know, informed him
that the Signora Beatrice had been near
death, he was told; and was now gone a
journey with the Marchesa and their con-
fessor. Cesario questioned the man fur-
ther: the man was but a servant of ser-
vants, and knew nothing; his superiors
were all in the streets amongst the
maskers.

telligence, yet kindling with a wild and

vain hope, since Beatrice was yet under
her mother's protection, he turned from
their late abode in search of fuller in-
formation. -
For the first moment or two, he thought
of seeking Signor Calva; but the feelings
associated with that officious friend, were
too keen to bear renewal, and he turned
his steps towards the Palazzo Doria.
Every Strada and Pico was thronged
with people and pageantries. The bal-
conies, and terraced roofs of the houses,
were full of ladies attired in their gala
dresses; some sparkling with jewels, some
blooming with flowers, or panting under
embroidery and brocade.
Here were the fooleries of pantomime
represented on a temporary stage; there,
bands of wandering musicians, playing
under the colonades of public buildings.
Jugglers, rope-dancers, reciters, were seen
in every corner.
Now, rolled on a gilded car filled with
allegorical personages, and followed by

troops of maskers in characters con-
nected with the pageant before them:
and now a band of young cavaliers, gal-
lantly armed, and mounted on managed
horses, went through a mimic joust.
One universal uproar of laughter, mu-
sic, shouts, cries of momentary alarm,
whirring of artificial fires, sound of
trumpets, and ringing of bells, loaded
the air.
Cesario's ears were stunned by the
din : to him, all was discord, and all im-
pertinence: the showers of sweetmeats
and flowers, which fell on him in com-
mon with others, as he pushed through
the erowd under the balconies, seemed
as if thrown inderision of his misery. In
truth, the gaiety and the masks gave to
this night a certain resemblance to the
last he had spent in Genoa: it seemed
its mocking and gigantic phantom.
Obstructed by so many obstacles, Ce-
sario was some hours ere he could reach

the Palazzo Doria; and when he got
there, the morning was just dawned.
Those magnificent gardens, always
open to the public, were filled with multi-
tudes: where the fountains spouted wine,
or the groves were transiently illuminated
by a burst of fire-works, there poured the
tide of idlers; so that Cesario found
some unobstructed paths to reach the
house. . -
In one of these, (a mossy alley, actu-
ally roofed with evergreens,) he encoun-
tered the very man he sought. Doria
had withdrawn from the giddy crowd, to
refresh himself with the dewy breathings
of morn: his surprise at sight of Ce-
sario was only equalled by the other's
joy. - .
Their first few questions mutually an-
swered, Doria prepared to relieve the
anxiety of his young friend. Having led
him into a little Gothic oratory, buried
among the trees, therefore not likely to

attract intruders, he began his important
communication. .
The prince related what he had to
tell, without preface or remark; leaving
characters to develope themselves by their
actions. -
“Some days after you left Genoa,”
he said, “I received a visit from the Sig-
nor Giovanni; he put into my hand two
papers: one his last testament in case of
his death; and the other, a legal dispo-
sition of his property during his life. It
was his purpose, he said, to re-enter the
Order of St. John.” -
Cesario started, and changed coun-
tenance: his lips moved; but the prince
hearing no articulate sound, proceeded.
“You shall see that last paper, before
we part—for it is generously full of
care for all you could wish attended to
on the lands that once were your fa-
ther's — at present I’ll go on with my
story. - -
“ He told me in brief, that a cruel

misunderstanding had disunited you, (of
what nature he said not,) and he ex-
pressed the liveliest anxiety to discover
whither you were gone. He then ob-
tained my promise to transmit him what-
ever account might reach me respecting
you, wherever he might then be, and
took his leave.
“I was far from guessing what was
the cause of your alienation; and it was
not till several days afterwards, that I
was let into the lamentable secret.
“I was sent for one morning by the
Marchesa Brignoletti, who was in the
habit of consulting me occasionally. She
appeared in extreme distress of mind,
while she told me, that her daughter was
then given up to such a pitiable state, in
consequence of an attachment to Signor
Cigala, (whose departure from Genoa,
and purpose of renewing his vow of ce-
Hibacy, were publicly talked of) that she
had lost all government of herself; and

was, in truth, little short of downright
distraction.” -
At this sentence, Cesario grasped the
prince’s arm with a convulsive pressure,
and smothered a groan: still, however,
he spoke not. — Doria continued. r
“The material part of this infatuated
girl’s confession was, that Signor Cigala
had uniformly shunned her; but as she
persisted in attributing such conduct to
a high sense of honour towards you, she
besought her mother to urge him for his
own sake, as well as hers, to relax his
rigid principles, and to take the hand
she never would yield to another.
“In short, my dear Adimari, I would
not say it to you if I could avoid it, but
truth is sacred; and I confess the com-
mission I was prayed to undertake was
absolutely to ask Signor Cigala to marry
the Signora Beatrice.”
“ Hold! hold, Prince l’exclaimed Ce-
sario, starting up distractedly, “I can-
not—will not believe —” He checked

the rash conclusion, bowed his crimson
face on his hand, and re-seated himself
in silence. Never had respect made a
greater conquest!
The excellent Doria felt the full value
of this self-command, and acknowledged
it.
“I believe now, it is best to tell you
what follows, in brief. Well then : — I
undertook their commission — undertook
it to satisfy my own astonishment and
incredulity; for, in fact, I thought bet-
ter of your friend than that he would
“sell his large honours’ for that toy —
a susceptible girl : he did not disap-
point me: he refused the lady with all
her wealth and beauty. He assured me,
that in doing so, he made no sacrifice to
friendship —for that he never had felt
the smallest inclination for her ; that he
was exceedingly sorry his zeal for her
mental improvement, when he considered
her your future wife, should ever have
led her into so fatal an error. In truth,

he spared her, more than any other man
in his circumstances would have done;
for then it was, that I learnt how your
friendship had been destroyed.” -
“If I am awake,” exclaimed Cesario,
striking his forehead with both hands,
and raising his agonised eyes to Heaven,
“ then am I of all men most wretched ſ”
“Say not so, Adimari, when you have
such a friend.”
“Have!” reiterated Cesario, with a
thrilling voice—“I have him no longer!”
Doria looked at him in expressive
silence. Cesario's ghastly look, joined
to the anguish of his voice, told of some-
thing more than mere suspicions or re-
proach: the prince remembered, that
when he had spoken of reconciliation
between the friends, Giovanni’s counte-
nance had changed to pale, and then
to red, as he said, in a hurried voice,
“No, no; there are things, I fear, I
cannot—ought not to forgive.”
There was but one thing which, as a

gentleman and a knight, Doria believed
it was impossible to efface, even by re-
pentance; and with this thought he
divined the humiliating secret.
He heaved a deep sigh, and said, em-
phatically, “Unhappy young man!”
Cesario sat, pressing his clasped hands
on his burning temples, without attend-
ing to him : shame, misery, despair were
all in his altered countenance. Now
and then he groaned; and a convulsive
shudder ran through his limbs. At times
he snatched away his head, and pressed
his hands closer over his eyes; as if by
that action he could shut out the image
in his mind–Giovanni's last look —
but still it was there, still did it enter
into his soul: a start, a cry told the mo-
mentary pang.
The next instant fixed him in mute
and motionless despair.
At length his tortured soul relieved
itself by words: he spoke, at intervals,
in a voice interrupted by grief. - -

“Now do I understand thee, Gio.
vanni. Fool that I was—blind, infatuated
..fool!—when I thought him harsh to
venial faults, he was but just: he knew
her false, false heart. False! mighty
heaven, can she have been so false, so
dost, so humbled ! — and I have loved
this woman."
... Once more he sunk into stupor. -
An instant after, his features bright-
‘ened with a wild light, and he exclaim-
ed, - “But that bracelet! I saw it in
his chamber; ’twas her bracelet. Their
meeting, too!—No, no; you cheat me;
they are both, both false.”
- Doria hastened to explain these cir-
cumstances: for Giovanni had explain-
ed them to him when he commissioned
him to return Beatrice the ornament
which had caused so much mischief.
His meeting with her (so Giovanni
assured the prince) was accidental on
his part; and that she had not purposed
more than to sound his secret inclina-
I 3

tions under the disguise she assumed, he
was right in believing. -
In truth, Beatrice had flattered her-
'self with the expectation of drawing a
delightful discovery from him; believing
that if she failed, pride and anger would
enable her to quit him without betraying
who she was. - 3.
But who that passion hurries thus far,
dare say she will go no further? If we
give our hand to a fiend, will he not drag
sus down a precipice 2 . . . . . . .
Beatrice voluntarily sacrificed her de-
{licacy; and the next sacrifice exacted by
the tyranny of passion was decency itself.
She was maddened by Giovanni's pre-
—ference of friendship to love (who quickly
guessed the disguised tempter, and mo-
delled his replies accordingly), and, yield-
ing to her torrent feelings, she burst
forth in reproaches, confessions, suppli-
cations! : .
Giovanni rebuked this unmaidenly vio-
lence,” while he assured her that this

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 175
fancy for him would pass away like others;
for, that she mistook her own heart when
she believed it so eternally devoted to
him. -
It was in answer to this ungrateful
truth, that, having repeated to him all
she did at the prompting of this passion,
and contrasted it with her feeble return
to the fondness of Cesario, that she ended
with the words which caught Cesario's
tar. - . - - :
3. To this explanation Doria only added,
that, by his advice, the Marchesa had
taken her daughter to travel; as it was
probable change of scene would abate the
poignancy of the latter's disappointment,
and the former's sense of family-degra-
dation. - -
“Rouse yourself, Adimari!” cried the
blunt but kindly Doria, when he con-
cluded; “make up your mind to forget
all this: leave the foolish girl to her
shame, and begin life afresh. Take my
word for it, there is both honour and

happiness in store for you yet, if you
will but seek them.”
“Yes, Prince!” replied Cesario, with
a mixture of pride and anguish, “I will
forget this cruel, this once-dear Bea-
trice l’” A sigh burst out with her name,
his lips quivered, and tears suddenly
covered his eyes.
Ashamed of the weakness, yet unable
to clear his suffocated voice, he stopped,
turning his eyes downwards. This effort
of self-conquest was beyond his present
strength; the tears rolled over his cheeks,
and his heart, once escaping the curb,
could no longer be commanded. He
started from the prince into another
division of the oratory, and remained
there till he could re-appear with firm-
neSS.
When he returned, it was with a com-
posed exterior; and, pressing the prince's
hand most gratefully more than once,
he said, in a resolute tone,
“Your Highness shall have no cause .

to blush for me in future. I will rather
tear out my heart than let it regret
her — she that never loved me ! I could
have pardoned any thing but such a
confession. Glory will soon efface her
image; but what shall recompense me
for the loss of my friend! What can root
out my black ingratitude to him To
doubt him had been crime enough —but
to outrage him too !”
The memory of that last act came
over Cesario’s soul, aggravated by all
his present convictions. It sunk him
into an abyss of shame, from which he
thought nothing could recover him ; so
that every other image faded before it;
and even she was, indeed, forgotten,
whose faithless conduct had caused his
guilt. -
Doria strove to argue him into happier
feelings; but, as he could not deny that
Giovanni, through all his tenderness for
his former friend, showed a deep and

powerful sense of injury, his reasonings
were of little avail.
Cesario listened to the various details
of that friend's generous conduct towards
the old tenants and attendants at the
Marino in gloomy silence: for to him
these seemed but so many parts of a
great and signal revenge.
Doria could not resist telling him Gio-
vanni's share in the transaction with
Signor Michaeli; it had come naturally
to light, during the period of enquiring
for Cesario, and transmitting the money.
The Syndic had that sum now in trust
for his absent relative. -
“O, do not quite crush me!” inter-
rupted Cesario, in a paroxysm of remorse
and self-abasement — “ no more — no
more!” He covered his face again, and
was silent.
So various, and so powerful were the
feelings by which he was agitated, that
his countenance changed every minute:
by degrees, its acute expressions of agony

were less frequent, till at length there
remained only a look of melancholy de-
termination.
“I will not ask it !” he said, thinking
aloud; “I am beyond pardon. My only
atonement must be a life spent like his—
so shall I prove, that I was not all un-
worthy of the love he once bore me.”
When Doria questioned him on his in-
tentions, he avowed his resolution of fol-
lowing the path of his offended friend
through the fields of war; but that, at
too awful a distance for Giovanni to know
it, till his career, perhaps, were honour-
ably closed. - -
Doria did not dissuade him from this
purpose; it was his wish to see Cesario
advancing in the line of duty; and his
well-grounded hope, that the chances of
war might reconcile the friends in the
most affecting and rivetting way – by
mutual defence | Yet, if he could acce-
lerate so desirable a re-union, it was
almost his duty to do so.

He spoke, therefore, of Giovanni's
general kindness, as well as his particular
friendship; he urged the value of Cesa-
rio's penitence, and the probable effects
of time in softening even the fiercest
resentments; and he besought him, not
to carry his commendable self-abhorrence
to a length which might in reality rather
afflict than appease his friend.
The prince offered to mediate between
their estranged hearts ; but Cesario
would not hear of it. He was too self.
degraded, in his own eyes, to think that
any thing would procure Giovanni's for-
giveness, except a series of hazardous
actions and long repentance.
Doria talked something about foolish
romance, overstrained delicacy, &c. but
his heart was of Cesario's opinion; and
he urged the thing no further.
“ I know not what we shall do in the
business of Malta,” said the prince, after
a while, with an air of secret vexation;
“but if we do nothing, you may fairly

fill up your idle time by a gallant action
or two ; and, after all, if we act as we
ought, and carry our fleet to the defence
of Malta, you can join us from the shore.
Go, then, in heaven’s name. I now
wish never to hear of you, but where
danger is grappled with, and honour
won.” - -
Cesario took the kindly-extended hand
of the veteran, and pressed it against his
breast.
“Farewell, my Prince " he said, with
a softened heart, “we may never meet
again. I should go a less unhappy man,
if I knew that my father's friend was
relieved from any part of those cares,
which so lately —” Cesario stopped,
respectfully loath to press a tender point,
yet gratefully anxious to know something
of Doria's most intimate feelings.
The prince gave him a look of pleased
acknowledgment. “Go content, then,
my dear Adimari. My family-affairs
brighten: I have good hope that matters

will turn out better than I expected—
for there is no marriage. I shall not for-
get this proof of your regard for me and
mine.” He pressed his young friend’s
hand very earnestly, and Cesario kissing
his in return, bowed and departed.
He hastened at once to his relation’s
in the Piazza dell’Acqua Verde, as it
was necessary for him to ascertain the
amount of what Giovanni’s exertions had
recovered; and to make arrangements
for the career upon which he was about
to enter.
The Syndic received him with cordial
pleasure; gave him the details of Signor
Michaeli's handsome conduct, and de-
livered up the proper vouchers from
the bank in which he had lodged the
money. -
Cesario's first employment of this
money was for the purposes of grati-
tude and kindness, (and, how sweet was
the pleasure so long untasted by him )
He next redeemed the only remnant of

property his father had left; and retain-
ing sufficient for the possible contin-
gencies of another country, and an in-
dependent service, prepared to set forth
on his pilgrimage of penitence.
There had been a time when, circum-
stanced as now, Cesario would have
perished rather than have used the good
fortune for which he was indebted to the
friend he had since insulted; but those
times, happily, were gone; and, awakened
to clearer views of the truly noble, he
was now able to vanquish himself, and
prove his repentance by sacrificing his
pride.
To allow Giovanni the privilege of
remotely becoming his benefactor, was in
fact to let him “heap coals of fire upon
the offender:” in doing so, Cesario was
humbling himself before him more com-
pletely than if he were cast upon his
knees entreating pardon.
But humility is the only certain sign
of repentance; and Cesario did so sin-

cerely abhor himself for what he had
done, that he justly believed it would be
far easier for him to obtain Giovanni's
forgiveness, even now, than that of his
own accusing conscience. ,
But when we resolve on right, and are
conscious that we see our own actions
without prejudice or passion; when we
feel that our warmest aspirations are for
the purification of our own character, and
the esteem of the excellent; — then,
whatever be our faults, we feel in our-
selves the assurance of peace hereafter.
Those noble aspirations are a pledge to
us of future self-respeet; they tell us
that we shall one day regain it: and,
with self-respect, where is the calamity
which is insupportable 2
In all that related to Giovanni, Ce-
sario's heart was soothed and calmed,
solely by principles which did him ho-
mour: but the oblivion which quickly
passed over the image of Beatrice, was
produced by less exalted agency. He

was mortified, irritated, stung with the
idea of being duped either by his own
credulous vanity, or by her art; and his
pride, thus forcibly roused, promised soon
to make absolute aversion succeed to
love. Nay, there were moments when
he remembered what he never otherwise
would have allowed himself to remember,
that the symptoms of preference had
begun on the side of Beatrice. Had she
continued true, this recollection might ,
only have heightened his grateful ten-
derness — but acting faithlessly, it ren-
dered her lightness but the more des-
picable. -
Whatever were the causes, the effect
was salutary; and, all given to the two
grand objects of his soul, glory and his
friend, Cesario now turned his back on
the scene of former deceitful joys, with-
out one wish for their return.

AND Giovanni where was he?—what
had been, what were now his feelings? .
When he quitted his own house so
abruptly on the night of Giulio Carega's
marriage, he hurried, unconscious whither;
and that, in a perturbation of soul, more
congenial with the stormy character of
him who caused it, than with his own
habitual self-command.
Having by chance taken the way to
the ramparts, he walked along them, re-
gardless of the wind and rain now sud-
denly beating in upon him from the
south. - - - - - -
Not a creature was stirring on these
noble terraces, except the solitary senti-
nels of the distant forts, whose far-off

steps were, however, lost in the roar of
sea and air.
Upon the dark mass presented by the
city below, but a speck of light was here
and there seen glimmering like glow-
worms, and like them vanishing into the
surrounding blackness. Only the waving
lanthorns of the shipping in the harbour,
and the beacon of the Pharos, steadily
illuminated their immediate stations; all
else was dark: the ocean presented one
black, immeasureable abyss; the land, a
shapeless chaos of gloom.
Giovanni felt not the blasts, as they
rushed furiously over his head, to rouse
and scatter those inland woods which
were yet silent: he felt but the blow of
Cesario.
“Dishonoured! — disgraced! — un-
done!”—he ejaculated repeatedly, as he
walked to and fro; sometimes stopping
and gazing round, unconscious what he
looked on, or listened to ; unconscious
that he was alone, unmantled, and un-

bonnetted, in the middle of a boisterous
night on an exposed rampart.
“And by thee, Cesario!—thee, for
whom I would have died P’—Giovanni's
great heart gave way under nothing but
disgrace.
In that age of chivalric character, to
receive a blow was to endure the greatest
indignity man might suffer; and not to
avenge it, was to live dishonoured: but
to wash out disgrace in the blood of him
for whom Giovanni would willingly have
shed all his blood, drop for drop, how
could it be thought on 2—yet, they must
meet no more, if they met not at the
point of each other's swords.
“ We are divorced, then, for ever!”
exclaimed Giovanni, still breathing his
agitated soul to the deafening elements;
“ and now there is no interest for me in
life.”
At that moment ten thousand delight-
ful recollections of former days came
over him, dimming the loftier images of

future devotion to religion and glory.
Sympathies of taste, feeling, principle;
intellectual pleasures shared with Cesario,
and heightened by participation; sor-
rows softened, virtues confirmed, or frail-
ties subdued in generous emulation of
each other’s better qualities; unequal
habits assimilated by equality of affection;
confidence unbounded.
All these joys of holy friendship, which
elevate the soul to a rank little less than .
angelic, these joys were gone; like
a momentary glimpse of Heaven, they
had been, and were withdrawn. -
Giovanni's heart melted at the review
of such a past; and for some time his
regrets absorbed the sense of personal
degradation. . . . .
By slow degrees, however, his ideas
arranged themselves; and those plans
for the future, which were at first but
indistinct images floating through un-
, certainty, assumed shape and fixedness.
While Cesario remained his friend;

allied to the general world, by the variety
of bonds which that friend’s warm af.
fections were daily multiplying, Giovanni
became interested in them all; and self.
devoted to that chosen friend, had their
union of souls continued, he never would
have shackled the freedom of his own
actions, by renewing his vow of obedi-
ence to the order of St. John;—but now
that he and Cesario were to each other
as though they had never been, the world
was grown a wilderness, and the service
of God and humanity the only sanctu-
aries for Giovanni.
To the offices of religion, and the du-
ties of charity, he looked for consolation;
the sacred fire of the altar was still burn-
ing in his breast, as brightly as when it
first kindled there; he could still carry
to the feet of his heavenly Father, the
obedience, the gratitude, the perfect love
of a son; he could still glow with kindly
admiration of brave and excellent asso-
ciates; he could still delight in the beau-

ties, and meditate on the wonders of
creation; he could enjoy the luxury of
ministering to the sick, the sorrowful,
and the poor; he could look back on a
life of twenty-eight years past without
reproach from others, and with scarcely
one just rebuke from his own heart;
how then could he call himself mise-
rable 2
With such affections remaining, and
such objects for those affections to fixon,
could his soul be desolate 2—and with
such godlike gratifications, could it be

blush, from his temporary weakness; and

heart where Cesario had once been trea.
sured, he left the ramparts, and descend-
ing into the town, entered the first church
at which early mass was performing.
There, in secret, he addressed himself
to the one great Being, on the subject of
his own immediate wants; he prayed for

tranquillity of spirit and a life of useful-
ness; he prayed for blessings upon the
man whose unkindness had pierced him;
he prayed for re-union with him in the
world of spirits. -
This done, he returned home, where
he began immediately to settle his worldly
affairs, and make that distribution of his
property which the laws allowed: he
could not alienate anything; but he had
it in his power to grant annuities during
his life, and he used that power chiefly
in favour of Signor Adimari's old ser.
vants and former pensioners,
Part of his large revenue he allotted to
the kinsman whom he intrusted with the
superintendence of his estates; the far
greater part he devoted to the service of
his Order.
. . After seeing these dispositions put into
a legal form, he deposited duplicates of
them, and of his final testament, in the
hand of Prince Doria; thus prudently

providing a check upon the possible avi-
dity or neglect of his trusted relation.
It was his purpose to go direct to
Malta, in a noble galley which he bought
at an enormous price of the Seigniory,
and which he meant as a present to the
Grand Master. ! . . . . .
While this vessel was completing her
complement of men and stores, Giovanni
had ample leisure to think of Cesario.
Prince Doria's embassy from the Mar-
chesa, found him full of anxiety for that
friend, and left him doubly pierced with
regret. — Had that embassy taken place
but twelve days sooner, he might yet
have retained his friend. Cesario would
then have been told the truth by one
whom he could not hesitate to believe ;
and now, explanation was vain, and re-
conciliation hopeless. That fatal blow
had destroyed every thing.
When Giovanni found that neither
Doria, nor the Syndic, nor any of Cesa-
rio's younger associates knew whither he

was gone, nor by what means his wants
were supplied, this generous friend began
to entertain the most alarming appre-
hensions. He could not doubt Cesario's
almost immediate repentance of the out-
rage which severed them, even before
reflection might have made him question
the justice of his suspicions: he could
not doubt the distraction of such a mind,
when possessed at once by jealousy and
remorse; and some fearful ideas of self-
destruction crossed his thoughts.
Panic-struck with such an image,
Giovanni determined to go in search of
him. Concealing his name, but liberally
bestowing his purse wherever he went,
he rode from village to hamlet, from
hamlet to solitary hut, just as he dis-
covered, or fancied he discovered, traces .
of Cesario's route.
Cesario's was a face and figure which,
once seen, could never be forgotten; and
even in his various stages of distraction,
gloom, and total stupefaction of every

t
power, mental and bodily, the peasants
had remarked him, as he passed along,
with occasional feelings of admiration,
curiosity, or wonder, which assisted in
stamping his remembrance.
That fortunate peculiarity which dis-
tinguished Cesario from other men,
afforded Giovanni a sure guide; and he
trod the labyrinth of all his wretched
friend’s wanderings, in patient hope of
reaching his resting place at last.
Giovanni's intention was not to seek
an interview with him; it was now his
point of honour to avoid one: but he
found it impossible to throw his soul into
other duties, until he had ascertained
Cesario's existence, and covertly supplied
his wants.
In this state of mind, what was his
emotion, when he recognised in the per-
son of an insensible man, lying across
the path of a mountain-pass, his still-
dear Cesario 2 -

to support, to chafe the limbs of that pale
corse; to pour a cordial into his lips, and
breathe into them his own warm breath,
were the actions of a moment. Every
thing was forgotten but that morning in
which this very Cesario had so supported
him, after having snatched him from a
watery grave. - .
Giovanni looked on him in pale and
speechless anxiety, while thus endeavour-
ing to restore him to animation; but
when he saw his heart heave and his lips
move, the tears rolled down his cheeks,
and he broke out into audible thanks-
givings. -
As Cesario opened his eyes, they met
those of Giovanni; they remained fixed
on him, it is true, yet calmly, vacantly,
without change or expression. “O worse
than dead!” exclaimed Giovanni, clasp-
ing him in agony against his breast, and
looking at him as though he hoped that
look would rekindle extinguished reason.
“ Then I leave thee no more!” he

cried, after a pause, during which Cesa-
rio's unsettled intellect betrayed itself in
words. “I leave thee no more—unless
Heaven restore thee to thyself!”
Giovanni spoke in the calm tone of
fixed but despairing resolution: he
thought of Beatrice, while contemplat-
ing the wreck she had made; and he
well-nigh abhorred himself for being in-
nocently connected with her perfidy.
The towers of a convent, seen through
a gorge of the mountains, first inspired
him with hope: he lifted Cesario gently
from the ground, where he had sunk
again, from mere animal exhaustion; and
holding him firmly on with one hand,
while he led his horse with the other
he proceeded slowly onwards. -
It is needless to add, that Giovanni
was the silent brother of La Trappe, who
watched unwearied by Cesario's side for
four tedious weeks; and that it was on
Giovanni's shrouded figure, Cesario di-

rected his first glance of returning con-
, SC1011SIles S.
Giovanni had long learned to master
the impulse of extravagant feelings; had
it not been so, he must have rushed into
the arms of Cesario the moment that
well-beloved voice, re-informed by reason,
had reached his ear: — but, accustomed
to vanquish himself, he paused, till the
repeated thrills of thankful surprise
Ceased to quiver through every vein, and
then he approached the bed of his friend.
The fervent benediction of his yearn-
ing, heart was not uttered by his lips; it
could not escape even at his eyes; for
they were so shaded by his cowl, that
neither their expression, nor the tears
which flooded them at that moment, and
which poured down the moment after,
were visible to Cesario.
The latter thought he saw only a
pious brother of St. Bruno, calmly trans-
ferring his charitable cares from the bed
of a convalescent to that of some greater

sufferer, when he looked indeed upon
the figure of his friend, of that friend
within whose heart all the tender passions
were wrestling with despotic honour.
The laws of the Knights Hospitallers
were framed in the spirit of chivalry;
and the members of that order were
consequently accustomed never to sepa-
rate the temporal from the spiritual part
of their code. Thus, Giovanni dared
not go beyond the bounds he had now
reached. As a Christian, he had suc-
coured the man that outraged him, and
he had returned good for evil; but as a
knight, he must avoid his presence, or
redeem his knightly character with his
life. -
The laws of this order, like those of
our own military bodies, were directly
adverse to its spirit: thus, with equal in-
consistency, those laws denounced the
practice of duelling, while every knight
who failed to avenge an affront, offered

him willfully or heedlessly, was tacitly
outlawed. -
Giovanni was not all faultless: he was
but the brightest pattern of an imperfect
idea of Christian duty: his nobler facul-
ties were yoked, equally with those of
the lowest intellect, to the car of spiritual
supremacy; to the authority of ancient
usages; and he followed, unresistingly,
where these led. Happy they who live
under a clearer light! -
Thus he did not see the monstrousness
of embodying the peaceful spirit of
Christianity in the frame of fantastic
honour; a frame, however engaging to
the eye, permicious to many of the vir-
tues and blessings of life. At the com-
mand of that visionary honour, how often
were the tenderest ties dissolved Judg-
ing an act independent of the intention,
it resented a breath unwillingly breathed
upon it, as direfully as if aimed by de-
liberate malice. -
At such a chimerical command, did


## p. 201 (#211) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 201
Giovanni now immolate his fondest wish.
He acknowledged Cesario dearer to him
than ever, because more wretched; he
cherished no resentment against him;
and he felt himself not the less respect-
able, for refraining from avenging a blow
given in a moment of phrensy.
Yet, because a blow, under any cir-
cumstances, was considered a mortal
affront by mankind in general, and by
the rules of chivalry in particular; he
stifled the cry of mature, turned from
the languid head he yearned to support,
and tore himself away. -
Giovanni did not quit the convent,
till he was quite assured of Cesario's
progress towards recovery : he then de-
parted, with a resigned though joyless
spirit; leaving the monks of St. Bruno
as incurious as they were taciturn, and
commissioned only to speak of him as a
traveller. - - -
His business now lay at Rome. Thi-
ther he went, to throw himself at the

feet of the pontiff, and ask his permis-
sion to resume the sign of the cross. -
This act of humility was a mere cere-
mony, essential only as a part of that
complete authority over all professing
obedience to the Holy See, which its
head found it expedient to display.
From Rome, Giovanni proceeded to
Porto Ercole, whither he had directed
his galley to meet him. It was not in
the port, when he reached Ercole; and
anxious to learn something of the Turkish
armament, and the views of the Grand
Master, he hastened to a neighbouring
commandery, where Dueguerras, the bai-
liff of Negropont, was just arrived from
a mission in France.
Giovanni had last seen this brave old
knight, when he fought for the last time
as a brother of the order, on the shore
of Africa. They had bled together on the
plains of Gomera, when the almost impreg-
mable fortress of El Penon de Velez was
first taken by the knights, and the sol-

diers of Spain—that important fortress,
which, in the course of three years after,
had been lost and won again by the
Christians.
When Giovanni beheld this intrepid
old man, at the age of seventy, eagerly
embracing toil and peril for the sake of
his brethren; hurrying from a peaceful
and powerful situation, into the shock
of war; he could not enough admire
the force of mind, and the omnipotence
of virtue.
The order of St. John, dedicated
solely to the service of the oppressed,
whether states or individuals; exposing
themselves continually to every species
of danger, not for their own aggrandise-
ment or riches, but for the rescue of
private property; that order, which ex-
isted only to relieve the poor, attend the
sick, and release the captive; was not
one, to see perish; it became the duty of
every Christian, but especially of every
knight, to rally round the standard of

St. John, and present his breast to the
pikes of the infidels.
The old Dueguerras uttered his reso-
lution of dying at the foot of that stand-
ard, with all the enthusiasm of youth;
and Giovanni's already kindled spirit
caught new fire from that of so ardent a
companion. -
It was publicly ascertained, that the
Turkish armament, which had excited
the alarm of so many different states,
was in reality intended for the destruc-
tion of the Knights Hospitallers.
In every conquest over the Ottomans
and Algerines, these intrepid brothers
were always foremost; adventuring their
lives fearlessly, which they passed purely.
The Goletta, and Penon de Velez,
which were indeed the keys of Barbary,
were formerly won by the bravery of the
knights; in consequence of which, Has-
sam of Algiers, and Dragut of Tripoli,
became their most inveterate foes.
The Porte, long irritated against the

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 205
order, was at last roused to vengeance;
not by motives of sound and general
policy, but by the petty resentments of
a minister and a mistress.
The capture of a huge gallion, laden
with the richest commodities of the East,
by a Maltese galley, was the real cause
of that mighty armament, which after-
wards broke like an inundation over the
island rock.
Urged to revenge the insult, thus
given to his favourites, (for the gallion,
with her lading, belonged to the Kislar
Aga, and the chief ladies of the sera-
glio,) Solyman hastily summoned a mili-
tary council, and laid before them his
reasons for attacking the knights of
St. John. - -
He represented their continual and
successful enterprises against various
Mahomedan possessions; their mortify-
ing superiority in the very sea which
seemed exclusively the right of Turkey;
the Archipelago, he said, swarmed with

w -
their gallies, and every port in the
Morea bore witness to their audacity.
But above all, he dwelt less on the
evils resulting to his commerce, and the
disgrace inflicted on his arms, than
upon the alarming hindrance which these
formidable warriors opposed to the piety
of his subjects. No true Mussulman
could now venture a pilgrimage to Mecca :
or Medina, without incurring the almost
certain penalty of death or slavery : —
the knights were always on the watch
for the vessels bearing these devout per-
sons; and their fate was inevitable,
when once they encountered the Chris-
tian foe. - -
Solyman, therefore, deemed it a point
of conscience to extirpate such a confe-
deracy of disciplined banditti; or at
least to drive them from a rock, whence,
like eagles in their ačry, they watched
and pounced upon their prey. -
It was his proud boast, (and a proud
one indeed it was 1) that he had already

THE KNIGHT OF ST. John. 207
wrested from their weakened grasp all
their possessions in the Archipelago and
Asia Minor; had driven them from
Rhodes; and finally left them but this
single fortress in the Mediterranean. —
Why then should he doubt almost imme-
diate success in a second attack upon
these sea-girt robbers ?
The conquest of Sicily, and the re-
capture of the Christian forts on the
African coast, which some of his generals
recommended, he considered but as se- .
condary objects; alleging, that if Malta
were taken, and her knights exterminat-
ed, Sicily would lose her bulwark, and
the African strongholds must fall of
COUITSe.
In short, Solyman felt the insult re-
ceived by the chief officer of his plea-
sures, as a personal insult to himself;
and, as such, he thirsted to revenge it.
The expedition once determined upon,
the Sultan issued orders for immediate
preparation. His fleet was confided to

Piali, an able admiral in the flower of
manhood; and his land forces to Musta-
pha, a general advanced in age, but cele-
brated for former victories.
To these forces were to be joined the
strength of Barbary. Hassan, the young
and dauntless Basha of Algiers, agreed
to assist the armament with all his troops,
headed by himself in person; and Dra-
gut, governor of Tripoli, was to lend his
skill and experience to the admiral of
the Porte.
The fame of this noted corsair had
long rivalled that of the great Andrea
Doria, during whose latter years Dragut
had started into celebrity. His ability
in working a vessel was only equalled
by the admirable courage and conduct
with which he either defended or at-
tacked: he was enured to fatigues and
hardships of every kind; and possessed
in himself that precious secret of success,
invincible determination.

ships of war, besides transports, and an
army of thirty thousand Janizaries and
Spahis, (not including the African auxi-
liaries,) formed an awful object for ex-
pectation. - -
When once the destination of this
armada was ascertained, La Valette, the
Grand Master of Malta, prepared to re-
ceive them, as became the head of an
order which had never yet shrunk from
an enemy. He called a general council;
and having communicated to them the
intelligence just received from his agents
at Constantinople, he proceeded, by their
consent, to issue a summons for the
immediate return of all those knights
who were absent from the island; whe-
ther on their own concerns, or pursuing
their duty at their different priories,
bailliwicks, and commanderies. -
He dispatched agents to levy troop
in Italy, and solicit aid from the princes
of Christendom ; and he wrote himself

to Don Garcia di Toledo, the Sicilian
viceroy, for those ample succours of
land and sea forces, which his master
Philip of Spain had not only promised,
but which policy rendered as necessary
for the ultimate preservation of his do-
minions, as for that of the island.
All now was impulse and activity in
Malta: the dispersed knights were hurry-
ing from every part of the continent,
to take their posts in that huge citadel;
vessels were daily arriving there with
arms, ammunitions, provisions, and fo-
reign volunteers. All things, in short,
announced the brave La Valette’s reso-
lution of repulsing the infidels, or of
gallantly perishing in the attempt.
Expectant Europe looked on in breath-
less anxiety, while this handful of un-
daunted chevaliers, in the spirit of a
single champion encountering an impious
giant, planted themselves to receive the
shock of the infidels.
Except its natural advantages, Malta

possessed few means of defence. When
the order received it from the hands of
the Emperor CharlesV., above thirty years
before the present period, it boasted but
a single fortification, the castle of St.
Angelo; and two towns. One of these,
called La Citte Notabile, was the capital
and centre of the island; and the other,
named Il Borgo, was then a mere collec-
tion of fishers' huts, and lay behind the
castle of St. Angelo.
L'Isle Adam, the memorable Grand
Master of that period, fixed the seat of
government at Il Borgo, surrounded it
with walls, and established the convent
of the order there.
Since then, in the time of John
D’Omedes, his third successor, two more
fortifications had been added, called the
forts of St. Elmo and St. Michael.
Each of these forts standing upon
what may be termed the pinnacles of the
island rock, commanded its approaches
by land and sea: for St. Elmo was erected

on the peninsular point which, running
out towards Sicily, divides what had else
been one vast harbour into two distinct
ports. -
Marza Muzet, the lesser of these
ports, lay on the left of this peninsula,
and was supposed to be sufficiently pro-
tected by the cannon of St. Elmo ; but
the Great Port required additional de-
fences, as it embraced all the wealth and
power of the order, * ,
From that side of it which fronted the
peninsular rock on which St. Elmo stood,
there ran out two lesser peninsulas
equally steep and defensible. On that
nearest the harbour mouth, was the fort
of St.Angelo protecting the town behind
it; and on that beyond (miscalled the
Isle de la Sangle) rose the fort of St.
Michael. - -
The space between these two slips of
land formed a secure port for the gallies
of the order, where they were nightly shut
in, by an enormous iron chain, stretching

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 213
across from the fort of St. Angelo to the
point of the Isle de la Sangle.
On the further side of La Sangle, lay
another inner port for merchant-vessels,
commanded by the heights of Conradin;
but on these heights there were no fortifi-
cations; and the various roads and an-
chorages in different quarters of the
island, left it but too accessible to a de-
scent of troops, if protected by a numer-
ous fleet. -
The confidence of La Valette was
however grounded on the opinion that
he could maintain his island till the
stormy season of autumn; when the
Turks, (supposing the siege not raised
sooner,) would no longer be able to keep
the seas, or assist the operations of their
land forces.
Half suspecting the selfish and short-
sighted policy of Spain, (which was
indeed to withhold assistance till the last
moment, lest Sicily should be attacked
while its viceroy was absent,) La Valette

determined to rely solely on his own
reSOUITCeS. -
In this spirit, he first estimated his
military strength, and then apportioned
it to the weakness or importance of such
positions as he wished to guard.
After numbering his knights present,
and expected, he found, they did not
exceed seven thousand; and of inferior
soldiers, including foreign auxiliaries,
serving brothers, and peasants hastily
trained to arms, there were not above
three thousand; but they were all heroes;
and in the breast of a single hero, lives
the spirit of a host.
The defence of the entrance of the
great port, La Valette confided to Ro-
megas, commander of the gallies; St.
Elmo he destined for the venerable
bailiff of Negropont: the Isle de la Sangle
he intrusted to the bravery of Di Monte,
an Italian knight of the first class; while
he undertook himself the defence of St.
Angelo, and the protectien of Il Borgo.

The ancient capital heleft to the care of an
experienced Portuguese called Mosquita;
delegating to Copier, grand marshal of
the order, a sort of flying warfare; that
of watching the movements of the hostile
armada, as it proceeded round the coast,
and opposing himself with his band of
knights to the first descent of troops.
Having appointed each his post, and
receiving from the whole assembly of
chevaliers, their assurance of dying in
their defence, he called on them to follow
him to the church of their patron saint;
there to ask a blessing on their arms,
and to purify themselves from their past
sins by unfeigned contrition.
This pious ceremony done, each
knight betook himself to his station; and
Dueguerras, when he gave this relation
to. Giovanni, was himself hastening to
assume the honourable post assigned to
him in the defence of St. Elmo.

CHAPTER X.
GiovaNNI listened to these details, with
all its first ardours glowing in his heart.
A thousand spirit-stirring recollections
rushed on him. His own gallant exploits,
and those of his brothers in arms, (now
raised to the first dignities of the order,
or haply resting in the bed of honour,)
rekindled in his memory. He listened,
enquired, mused, exulted, and melted
by turns, as the discourse of Dueguerras
roused and calmed him. -
Giovanni had served with the brave
La Valette, when that memorable hero
commanded the gallies of the order; and
he knew therefore of what that great soul
was capable.
Even his then inexperienced eye had

seen enough to enable him to foresee in
riper age, all those sublime qualities of
unquenchable resolution, unshrinkingfor-
titude, ever-springing hope, and complete
devotedness to duty, which the circum-
stances of this celebrated siege after-
wards called out before the world.
As Dueguerras related the active and
multiplied occupations of their Grand
Master, Giovanni, saw La Valette in his
mind's eye, alternately visiting the ma-
gazines and the infirmary; attending the
sick, and assisting workmen; now admi-
nistering a healing draught, and now
tracing a fortification; in short, perform-
ing the various offices of military sci-
ence, and of tender charity, with a coun-
tenance at once benignant and com-
manding.
His admiration warmed into affection,
as he contemplated an object so greatly
lovely; and stifling the sigh which rose
to his lips with the half-breathed name
of Cesario, he besought Dueguerras to

give him a passage to Malta, if his own
galley did not reach Porto Ercole in
time. -
This request was granted ; but as
Dueguerras had to touch at Sicily, to
expedite the succours promised by the
Viceroy Toledo, Giovanni heard with
joy of the arrival of his vessel from
Genoa.
Having taken on board some knights
and soldiers who solicited a passage, he
set sail, in company with his veteran
friend. At the straits of Messina they
parted, whence the Santa Croce (so his
ship was called), coasting the fertile
shore of Sicily, and doubling Cape Pas-
saro, stretched across the channel of
Malta. -
As they approached the road of St.
Paul, two sails, bearing the appearance
of Turkish vessels, were discovered ho-
vering between the island of Goza, and
the two islets near.
It was night; but the moon enlight-

ened the whole expanse of sea and sky;
and the weather was so favourable, that
the galley might reap the double advan-
tage of sails and oars.
Giovanni ordered his vessel to be ad-
vanced near enough to reconnoitre the
force of these strangers.
He found them to be a galley of
greater strength than his own, attended
by a stout brigantine with fifteen banks
of oars. -
These belonged, doubtless, to the Ot-
toman armada, and had probably been
sent forward to spy into the state of
Goza, and most likely to attempt a sur-
prise; if so, their capture might prove
of essential service, by retarding the
movements of the fleet from which they
were detached.
Under this impression, Giovanni de-
termined to attack them. “Shall we
not advance, my friends?” he asked with
a tone of confidence, as he pointed them
out to the officers and men around him.

He was answered by a burst of enthu-
siasm: he then gave the necessary -
orders; assigned to each man his quar-
ters; and ere he took his own station,
called Rodolphe to his side.
In a few words he explained to the
amazed Cahet, the nature of the scene
he was about to witness; and having
dwelt on its importance to the interest
of Goza and Malta, gave him the op-
tion either of remaining on deck, or
going below.
Rodolphe received only a confused
impression of the greatness of the object,
for which this struggle was about to com-
mence; but he perfectly comprehended
the danger which threatened his bene-
factor. “Leave you, my dear master! —
leave you!” he exclaimed, his eyes
sparkling, even while filling with tears, –
“no — if I must die, it shall be here,”
and he threw himself at his master's
feet. -
Giovanni raised him, renewed his des

scription of the horrid scene he expected,
and after an ineffectual attempt at per-
suading him to avoid it, assigned him a
post near himself. *
Meanwhile the Turkish vessels having
espied the Christian galley, believing
her an easy prize, had tacked about, and
were now making towards her.
The moon that silvered the waves
through which they were advancing,
shone full upon them, displaying their
formidable appearance. -
There was something in the gallant
bearing of these vessels, as they glided
along the bright moon-track, which com-
manded admiration; and hearts less in-
trepid than those in the Santa Croce,
might have quailed when they came near
enough to mark their strength distinctly:
so greatly disproportionate was it to that
which they were about to oppose to it.
The chief strength of a ship, at that
period, consisted in small-arms and cross
bows: few vessels could boast more than
L 3

222 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
one great gun, called the Coursier; the
fire of which was rendered more or less
destructive, rather by the adroitness of
him who worked the ship, than by that
of the cannoneer particularly attached
to it.
Giovanni saw that not only the galley,
but the brigantine carried a gun of this
sort; and were, besides, filled with jani-
zaries as well as sailors.
The light of the moon gave to view
a band of archers standing on the poop
of each, apparently ready to send a deadly
shower into the Christian galley.
The officers were numerous, and easily
distinguished by their embroidered tur-
bans and glittering scymetars.
As they bore down, the Santa Croce
rested on her oars, and silently awaited
them : the enemy assuming to themselves
the honour of seeking, and commencing
the engagement. Deceived by this po-
sition into an idea that their opponent

was panic-struck and about to surrender,
the Turks set up a shout of triumph,
accompanied by a crash of warlike in-
Struments.
The Cahet's was the only countenance
which changed at the sound; and his
limbs shook: the next moment a shower
of arrows and shot fell over him, suc-
ceeded by the groans of wounded, and
the fall of dying men. His first action
was to bury his head in his hands; but
his next was to look for his master.
At that instant Giovanni was trying to
extricate himself from an arrow which
had unfortunately struck him in the neck,
just below the helmet; Rodolphe flew
towards him, wrenched it out, and flung
it into the sea: but when he saw the
blood spout from the wound like an
unstopped spring, he set up a cry of an-
guish.
Giovanni turned on him a momentary
glance of gratitude, said a few cheering

words, and hastily stanching the wound
with his scarf, eagerly gave the signal
expected by his men.
At that signal, the action on the part
of the Christians commenced with a de-
structive fire of musketry: taking ad-
vantage of the smoke, Giovanni's galley
was placed in such a situation, that as the
clouds dispersed, the whole decks of the
enemy were exposed to the archers, who
now, in their turn, poured terror and de-
struction amongst their astonished crew.
The slaughter was great, and the con-
sternation yet greater : the Turk had ex-
pected an easy conquest, and this bold
resistance struck him at once with sur-
prise and dismay. Instead of the thun-
dering sounds of returning musquetry,
or the whizzing of arrows, nought was
heard but shrieks, imprecations, groans,
and the ineffectual commands of undis-
ciplined authority.
The brigantine, alarmed at the situ-
ation of her companion, hastened to her

assistance, and endeavoured to distract
and draw off the attention of the Christ-
ians: in this, by dextrous management,
she succeeded ; for Giovanni, seriously
annoyed by her manoeuvres, was obliged
to quit his scarce recovered and now
nearly conquered foe: but she brought
his vengeance in dreadful reckoning on
herself; for quickly closing with her,
his great gun was brought to bear; fate
winged its ball; and the reeling, and
almost instantaneous sinking of the ves-
sel, proved but too truly that that fate
was overwhelming death and horror to
all on board.
A pause ensued: Turks and Christians
as the waves closed over the spot which
the brigantine had but just occupied,
fixed their eyes there in awful astonish-
ment and fear: the suspense was mo-
mentary, other feelings than those of
pity and commiseration agitated their
bosoms; revenge, and invigorated hope
on either side, raised again the blade of

death, and Christian and Turk sought
each other, and rushed again into war's
hottest ranks with increased hatred and
determination.
All but Rodolphe; he remained, stand-
‘ing with a ghastly fixture of every fea-
ture, incapable of moving his eyes from
the place where the brigantine had dis-
appeared.
Though the Turks, after the fate of
their companions, had sought, and eager-
ly renewed the fight, their enthusiasm
was brief; ’twas but a momentary pa-
roxysm of the soul, ill calculated to
withstand the steady and determined
valour of their opponents, now cheered
by hope; and it soon left them to all the
horrors of despair: safety was sought in
flight, and every energy exerted to es-
cape from their Christian adversary.
The Santa Croce followed in chase;
and Giovanni cheered and encouraged,
both with his voice and his example, his
brave and resolute adherents.


## p. 227 (#237) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN, 227
The Santa Croce was the quicker vessel,
and the Turk was soon overtaken. Gio-
vanni, to prevent a repetition of the at-
tempt to escape, laid her alongside, and
boarded her.
When Rodolphe beheld his master
spring on the deck of the Turkish galley,
he snatched up a battle-axe and sprang
after him: the knights had already joined
their dauntless leader; and the gallies
being now fastened together, all the
Christians threw themselves in a body
upon the enemy. -
In the deadly strife which followed,
Rodolphe seemed inspired with a new
soul; the instinct of self-preservation was
roused in him, and to that was added the
new feeling of emulation, and the more
powerful desire of succouring or dying
for his master. Turks and Christians
mingled together in one flood of carnage;
the galley rocked as it were under their
struggles; while the waves, crimsoned
with the streams of blood that flowed

into them, polluted the pure reflection
of the silvered and serene heavens.
Giovanni now hoped the contest was
nearly over; but the Turks in a last
paroxysm of despair, rallying round their
crescent, presented so formidable an ap-
pearance, that the Christians paused as-
tounded, and for an instant shrunk back:
the moment was critical; Giovanni saw
his men recede; he sprang to their head,
and waving his hand, exclaimed, “On,
my friends, for the Cross and St.John P’
At that instant his companions saw
him fall: consternation seized them; and
the Turks, taking advantage of their con-
fusion, pressed them in heaps back to
their vessel. Too much weakened, how-
ever, to follow up their blow, the enemy
thought only of escape; and extricating
himself from the cramp-irons which
fastened him to the Santa Croce, betook
himself a second time to flight.
But Rodolphe, though himself bleed-
ing at every pore, had happily borne off
IS

what he believed his master’s lifeless
body. He now tore away Giovanni's
helmet, and discovered the wound whence
the blood had flowed so profusely as to
occasion sudden fainting.
It was that arrow-wound which Gio-
vanni had received in the first of the
action: though it lay amongst a number of
lesser arteries, it might not have pro-
duced any extraordinary consequences,
had not his unusual exertions not merely
loosened the scarf which bound it, but
increased the action of the veins them-
selves. -
The wound was, however, speedily
stanched, and declared of no importance.
The shout of his own men, and the yell
of the Turks, at their escape, roused him
from his temporary suspension of sense:
he looked round, saw the flying galley,
started up, and snatching a weapon from
one next him, called on his rowers to
pursue.
A short chase brought them up again

230 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
with their enemy, whom now, for the third
and last time, they prepared to attack.
No sooner were they along side of her,
than giving the desperate example him-
self, Giovanni leaped into her, followed
by his only surviving knight, and the
most gallant of his crew.
Rodolphe, now familiarised with dan-
ger, and regardless of his streaming
wounds, rushed fearlessly after them. .
- The Turks rallied themselves about
the masts, and before the colours, where
they fought with a determination wor-
thy the better cause: again and again
the Christians attacked them, and as
often were they repulsed with dreadful
slaughter.
As he trod over an absolute rampart
of dead and dying, and cut his way
towards the waving crescent, there was
a horrid beauty in the figure of Giovanni,
which appalled the infidels. His un-
covered and golden hair glittered in the
moon-beam, while the same pale light

illuminating his face, gave every perfect
feature the whiteness and the polish of
marble.
His stature, his sublime air, the ex-
pression of his countenance, but above
all his resistless valour, made him appear
more than man; and for a while, the
Mussulmen imagined they saw the Patron
Saint of the order, combatting for his
followers in this shape of earthly beauty.
But quickly shaking off their super-
stitious panic, they resumed the contest
with fresh fury.
The Turkish commander fell in this
last struggle: as he dropped, Giovanni
snatched the hatchet from Rodolphe,
and throwing himself upon the colours,
cut them from their staff. They fell
into the sea.
As if that were the acknowledged
signal for submission, the Turkish officers
threw away their swords, and surren-
dered.
The prisoners were immediately

transported to the Christian galley, and
the prize manned; after which, Giovanni
gave orders for the deck to be cleared,
and the wounded taken care of. -
It was then that Rodolphe felt he had
regained his master; when he saw him
with a countenance full of compassion
and sadness, assisting in the decent dis-
position of the dead, and the care of the
maimed and dying.
It was indeed a piteous sight to see
the decks both of the galley and her
prize, covered with dismembered bodies,
some quite motionless, and others yet
heaving.
As these were successively plunged
into the deep, and the waters of that
deep poured over the horrors of the deck,
Rodolphe shuddered to his soul, and
almost wished himself once more in his
solitary hut, by the dreary but unpolluted
stream of Aveiron. -
The immediate stillness which suc-
ceeded to the noise and fury of the fight;

the tranquil course of the planets above,
and the waves below; the dark silence
of the surrounding islands,-deepened his
impression of the past scene: and, already
over-excited by the enthusiasm which
his master's example and danger had
inspired, exhausted by the rapidity and
novelty of his sensations, and released
from all obligation to further exertion,
he sank down in an obscure corner, and
wept like a child.
Meanwhile Giovanni, in the true spirit
of chivalry, conducted the Turkish offi-
cers to his cabin, where he strove to soften
their mortification, by admiring the gal-
lantry of their defence, and lamenting
his own severe loss.
The highest compliment a victor could
pay the vanquished, was to confess that
their bravery had caused him to buy vic-
tory at a dear rate. Giovanni did this;
and thus soothed the pain of defeat,
and the regrets of private friendship.
As it was no longer necessary to dis.

guise the object they were seeking, when
the Santa Croce fell in with them, the
Turkish officers acknowledged that they
were proceeding to Goza, for the purpose
of surprising its castle; a purpose which,
their papers discovered, was to be assisted
by treachery.
Some Mahometan slaves employed in
the works, and too generously trusted,
had engaged to secure their secret en-
trance into the fortress. The plan ap-
peared so well laid, that it must have
been successful, had not Giovanni's galley
providentially fallen in with that of the
enemy.
Had Goza been delivered into the
hands of the Porte, it would have become
a station of alarming annoyance to the
besieged Maltese; for its castle, built
on a rock equally elevated with those of
St. Angelo and St. Elmo, commanded
the island of Malta; and was separated
from it only by a channel of a few miles
breadth.


## p. 235 (#245) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 235
This circumstance at once reconciled
Giovanni to the defaced appearance of
his galley, and to the grievous slaughter
of his men. -
They were, perhaps, the first victims
that had been offered; but they had
attained a worthy object, and fallen glo-
riously. Though he carried but the re-
mains of that noble vessel, which he
fondly expected to present in all its com-
pleteness, he brought with it a trophy
well worth the staining of its first fresh-
mess; and if more than two-thirds of his
brave companions had fallen, they had
redeemed, with their lives, the lives and
liberties of all at Goza. -
Satisfied, yet sad, after this retrospect,
(for Giovanni never failed to search his
actions and his motives) he assembled
his remaining crew, and, kneeling in the
midst of them, listened to a mass said
for the souls of their enemies, as well as
for those of their own companions.
The service was short, but impressive;

and Rodolphe joined it, in awful admir-
ation of that benevolent spirit which
distinguished every action of his master,
and made him the diffuser of “peace
and goodwill to all men,” even in the
centre of merciless war.
Mass ended, the Santa Croce steered
for Goza, where Giovanni landed; and
having seen the governor, and confided
to him the papers found in the Turkish
vessel, relating to the treachery of the
citadel, their captor re-embarked, and
proceeded on his course to Malta.
The Santa Croce entered the great
port; and her triumphant gun, firing
every minute, announced a prize. The
first rays of morning were reddening
the grand standard of the order on the
tower of St. Angelo, below which, stood
a groupe of knights hastily gathered to
the spot.
As the galley passed by the castle
rock, the knights hailed her, enquiring
her country and commander. At the

name of Giovanni Cigala, the noblest
in the groupe uttered an exclamation of
joy, and hurried down the steep steps of
the fortress to give him welcome,
Giovanni threw himself into a shallop,
his soul all in a tumult of grateful and
solemn feelings; after which, springing
on shore, he found himself in the midst
of friends, and pressed to the heart of
the venerable La Valette.

CHAPTER XI.
The memorable May of 1565 had already
commenced when the transport which
bore Cesario came in sight of Malta.
It was broad day, and the reflection of
the meridian sun upon the rock made it
burn like the approach to a furnace.
That beautiful drapery, formed by the
cotton and capillaire plants, by the starry
flowers of the caper-bushes, and by that
variety of asphodels which clothe Malta
in the winter, was now withered, leaving
the flinty island in complete nakedness.
That immense rock, hewn by nature
into ravines, ramparts, and pinnacles,
presented a new and striking object to
Cesario. From the spot where he landed,
he saw bastions and batteries ascending
I3

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 239
from height to height, intersected by dry
ditches of wonderful depth and breadth;
rampart rising over rampart; and above
all, the castles of St. Angelo, St. Michael,
and St. Elmo.
The town, built upon lower ranges of
crags, followed all the inequalities of its
extraordinary foundation, and might be
called a town of steps; for the short steep
streets were in some places but paved
precipices, with almost perpendicular
flights of steps cut in the rock, and
forming their foot-paths.
In contemplating these strange roads,
the mind felt wearied for the body, and
shrunk from such a laborious residence :
yet still admiration accompanied this
feeling; and a proud sense of man’s
power and man’s perseverance, soon ba-
nished whatever alloyed admiration.
Malta was indeed a conquest over
nature. At this moment, with the ocean
at her foot, her long lines of batteries,

from all those flinty pinnacles which
rose like so many towers, she might well
have passed for some giant fortress of
fabulous days.
The greatness of the object was not
lost upon Cesario, who stood for some
time eyeing it in a trance of admiration.
At the voices of his companions he
turned, and beheld, some few paces off,
a groupe of knights. -
The air of one of these warriors re-
sembled Giovanni; yet the figure seemed
neither so tall nor so massy in its propor-
tions: but distances are deceptive, and
the dimensions of this figure might be
really larger than they appeared.
As the noble soldier varied his position,
Cesario thought he could not mistake the
graceful sway of that finely-formed body.
He hesitated a moment; then breaking
from his party, pulled his cloke round
him, and drawing the thick feather of
his hat over his bent face, prepared with

, a throbbing heart to pass this interesting
groupe. -
The chevaliers divided as he came
near them, and the one he observed, re-
mained standing alone. He had evi-
dently been musing on some dear and
agreeable idea, for when he raised his
head and directed his eyes towards Ce-
sario, his unknown countenance was suf.
fused with all that loveliness of expression
which belongs but to one set of feelings.
That engaging expression made Ce-
sario pause; and the courteous stranger,
believing from his looks that he wanted
information of the way to Il Borgo, im-
mediately advanced.
Saluting Cesario as one brought to the
island by the same honourable motive
which led thither so many volunteers, he
informed him that the Grand Master
with the chief of the Order were then
engaged in the ceremonies of admitting
a brother ; but he obligingly offered
either to accompany him to the place of

ceremony, or to conduct him to the inn
(so the several residences of the convent
were called) which was set apart for the
reception of strangers. He announced
himself as Felix di Toledo, son to the
viceroy of Sicily.
Already prepossessed by his fancied
resemblance to Giovanni, and by his own
interesting countenance, Cesario yielded
to the charm of so amiable a manner,
and accepted the stranger's offer of ac-
companying him to the church.
As they walked along, Toledo con-
versed with great animation upon the
state of the island, the reinforcements
which they expected, and their daily
expectation of the Turkish armament.
Cesario, meanwhile, observed in him
no other actual resemblance to Giovanni
than what might be found in his voice:
that, was deep and clear, and sweet, like
his friend’s ; and like his, Toledo's gave
a peculiarly-penetrating intonation to
every word expressive of tenderness.

The young knight was nearly Gio-
vanni's age : but his figure was cast in
a mould of slighter proportions; and
though equally perfect, might be termed
rather elegant than magnificent. His
eyes, too, were of a much darker blue
than Giovanni's ; and his war-burnt brow
better suited than the saintly clearness of
the latter’s complexion, with features
whose chief beauties consisted in man-
liness and heart-speaking expression.
Solely intent upon the one great object
which he imagined engrossed all who
came to share in the danger of Malta,
Toledo developed his own interest in it
without caution or distrust; though as
yet Cesario had announced himself but
as an Italian volunteer, with credentials
from Prince Doria. -
“You belong to the Order, of course?”
asked Cesario.
“No,-I am here as a hostage for my
father's good-behaviour,” replied Toledo,
with amiable cheerfulness. “ Two

months ago, I came hither with him, in
his way from inspecting the Goletta.
He left me with the Grand Master, as a
pledge which he is to redeem with a gal-
lant fleet and army, the moment the
infidels have slipped their cables. Icon-
fess I am avaricious enough of glory, to
wish contrary winds may keep him in
port ’till we have won the day ourselves.
Oh the exultation of driving back the
whole force of Turkey and Algiers!—
Seven thousand knights against as many
tens of thousands of infidels — it would
be the triumph of David over Goliah;
and I hope to live to share it, or die
nobly before Malta falls.”
“You are a happy man, Don Felix,”
observed Cesario, resting his eyes on the
speaking countenance of his companion;
“ for you do not seem to have any one
that makes life too precious to you.”
“Think you so?”—interrupted To-
ledo, his eyes suffusing with instantane-
ous tenderness, and his voice sweetening

beyond all that music has of sweet and
touching. “There is one in Sicily whose
presence is my paradise. I left a young
and beautiful bride for this war-scene.—
Why do I call her beautiful?— Dear –
dear—that is the word which speaks a
husband's feelings. I left her at the
call of gratitude: for I was shipwrecked
off this island five years ago, and restored
to life by the personal exertions of La
Valette himself. Should I not have
been unworthy my Camilla's love, had I
hesitated to offer him the aid of this well-
tried sword? —But the sacrifice – ah!
Signor, –you must love as I do ; and
the creature you doat on, must be your
own; sacred marriage must have opened
to you all her soul, and shown you there
nothing but yourself— and heaven —
before you can comprehend half that
sacrifice.” Cesario looked with some-
thing like envy upon Toledo, as the
latter stood with his head declined and
his arms folded, evidently banqueting

246 THE KNIGHT of St. John.
upon the tender ideas he had conjured
up. “Sacred marriage, indeed!” he
exclaimed, profoundly sighing; “sacred
indeed, when even such happiness as you
describe, only exalts a husband’s sensi-
bility to all that ennobles our nature.”
After this remark, both young men
proceeded for some time in silence: the
one, ruminating upon scenes of domestic
bliss; the other, sadly imagining that
such were never to exist for him.
Toledo suddenly roused himself, by
observing that they must quicken their
pace, or lose the ceremony. Cesario,
upon whose lips the name of Giovanni
had more than once trembled, then en-
quired what the new knight was called?
“Giovanni Cigala,” replied Toledo,
“that Cigala, who was once a brother of
the Order—the bravest and the best.”
Cesario suffocated the exclamation that
was bursting from his heart, and turned
aside to conceal his face. Toledo went
on with his discourse; giving so ani-

mated a description of the action be-
tween the Santa Croce and the Turkish
vessels, that Cesario’s soul flamed out.
“My friend my friend my peerless
Giovanni!” he exclaimed, his counte-
nance radiant with exulting affection.
“He is your friend!” repeated Don
Felix, casting on him a brightened look,
as if Giovanni’s excellence were the
pledge for all who claimed his intimacy.
Cesario's eyes clouded; he passed his
hand over them, while he answered,—
“I dare not call him so : we were once
friends; but I have so sinned against that
matchless worth, that nothing less than
my life, I think, may expiate it. I come
here, Don Felix, to lose that life, I hope,
but so to lose it that Giovanni need not
blush to shed a tear over my remains.
My only business now in this world is
to regain his esteem.”
“And what was your offence 2" asked
Toledo, stopping, and looking on him
with a searching, yet not prejudging eye.
M 4


## p. 248 (#258) ############################################

24.8 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
There was a manly frankness in this
direct question, which, if it wanted the
extreme delicacy of Giovanni's nicer
sensibility, displayed, what was equally
valuable, a character “open as day” in
him who asked it. - -
Cesario's mature responded to this sin-
cerity; and, after a momentary pause,
he said – “Ere this siege ends, I trustwe
shall know each other better, Don Felix;
but, till them, I cannot bring myself to
enter on the long and intricate story. If
you are content to take me upon trust,
so long, here is my hand : if not, be as-
sured I will build no claim to your ac-
quaintance upon this act of courtesy.”
Toledo fell back a few paces, and still
keeping his eye fixed upon that of his
companion, stood musing for a second
or two. There was a playful smilingness
over his whole countenance, when, ad-
vancing again, he stretched out his hand,
and said kindly,– “I’ll take youontrust.”
Cesario pressed the generous hand

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 249
thus offered to him with contradictory
feelings: for he felt powerfully attracted
to this open-hearted stranger, and he
chid himself for admitting any other
friendship than the one he had alienated,
into his desolated bosom.
After an instant's glance, Toledo re-
moved his kindly eyes, and spoke of
something else: his careless air concealed
a habit of observing other men’s feel-
ings; and at this moment he was be-
nevolently anxious to change the sad
thoughts of his companion for images of
a more agreeable kind. -
It was his creed, that no tender heart
could be a depraved one; and seeing
such evident signs of sensibility in Ce-
sario, he augured satisfaction rather than
disappointment from their future inti-
macy. -
By this time they had reached the en-
trance of the church. As Toledo put his
foot on the threshold, Cesario stopped,
in a disorder which amazed even himself.

- What was this sudden oppression of his
heart, this intolerable pain which shot
through him P What was it he regretted
for Giovanni, as he thought of that dear
friend, on the point of abjuring for ever
the complete freedom of his own will 2
The vow of celibacy was already made
in Giovanni's heart; for love was not ne-
cessary to his happiness: and the vow
of devoting himself to the interests of
humanity, led but to the natural course
of his own godlike inclinations.
By uniting arms with these gentler
modes of serving mankind, the order of
St. John gave scope to Giovanni's enter-
prise and military genius, and by this
means, afforded occupation to every
power of his mind. Had any one of
those powers been condemned to inac-
tion, then Cesario might have shrunk from
witnessing his friend's self-devotion.
Cesario said all this to himself without
effect; for at every close he added,

• THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 251
“Still I feel that but for my offence he
would not so have forsworn the world.”
Toledo now asked if he would rather
not enter. Cesario recollected himself
at the question, and whispering an agi-
tated request to be placed as much as
possible out of sight, followed into the
cathedral.
Till long after he was seated, his
troubled senses took no cognisance of
any thing. The awful gloom of the
church, filled with knights in the black
dress of their order; the numerous tro-
phies of former victories waving before
the richly-stained windows; the pealing
anthem, and the smoking incense, were
all lost upon Cesario. Even when his
faculties began to clear, he had not cou-
rage to turn his eyes towards the altar,
where he knew he should see his friend.
The preparatory part of the ceremony
was already over—that which belongs
to the previous devotions of the candi-

date. When the choral music which
followed it, was concluded, and the low
solemn voice of the Grand Master was
heard, proclaiming to those around, the
wish of a former brother to renew his
vows, Cesario's eyes turned involuntarily
that way. . .
He then saw the august La Valette
seated within the enclosure of the sanc-
tuary, and the bishop of Malta standing
by his side.
Kneeling upon the lowest step of the
altar, and clothed in a loose drapery of
black serge, with a burning taper in one
hand, and a drawn sword in the other,
... was Giovanni. His head was uncovered,
and his loosened hair receiving, as it fell
over his shoulders, the light of the taper,
appeared like so much living gold.
His face was pale as moonshine; but
in his heaven-fixed eyes there was a divine
light, which rivetted those of Cesario.
At the proper summons Giovanni
arose; and, having laid his sword upon


## p. 253 (#263) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 253
the altar, returned to his former posi-
tion, while the customary exhortations
and benedictions proceeded.
Cesario's heart meanwhile seemed pal-
sied within him : he grew paler every
instant; he sat breathless and intent, for-
getting every thing but the object of his
immediate interest. -
But when the majestic La Valette,
rising, and approaching the still-kneeling .
Giovanni, addressed him, in a firm voice,
with that solemn adjuration beginning,
“Take this sword into your hand—by
the clear and glittering blade it instruct-
eth you to shine in faith,” &c., Cesario
felt as if an iron vail was then dropped
between him and Giovanni. Such a
pang accompanied this thought, that he
groaned aloud, and startled those who
sat near him. . . . . º
s Toledo gently touched him, and di-
rected a meaning glance towards the
door. -
Cesario shook his head, and recollect-

ing where he was, looked down for some
moments, till he believed he could com-
mand himself. His features meanwhile
gradually composed; yet every now and
then Toledo heard him shudder convul-
sively, as if in an ague-fit.
Cesario was, indeed, paying the full
penalty of all his past offences: he could
not divest himself of the idea, that not
even Giovanni could voluntarily prefer
a life of constant self-sacrifice, and .
equally-diffused affections, to the charms
of a free-will, and a heart pillowed on
domestic love. He believed that his in-
gratitude had driven him to this ; and
he fancied that in Giovanni's holy rap-
ture, he saw the complete oblivion of his
own repentant image.
There was bitterness insupportable in
these ideas; and not even the unobtru-
sive sympathy of Toledo, shown in the
expressions of his amiable countenance,
could divert him from them.
When the Grand Master had girded

the sword upon Giovanni's thigh, and
received it from him again undrawn, he
proceeded to lay it upon his shoulder,
and declare him “A Knight of the Order
of St. John of Jerusalem, in the Name
of the Holy Trinity:” then, gently
striking him on the cheek, he uttered
these thrilling words,- “Rouse up your
spirits, and dream no longer on this
world’s affairs.”
Cesario started from his seat in a wild
tumult of every feeling: his heart knocked
violently against his breast, which he
pressed with both hands, as if to still
its intolerable motion. The whispering
voice of Toledo recalled him a second time
to recollection: he reseated himself while
the Grand Master went on with his so-
lemn appeal.
“ Be watchful in the faith of Jesus
Christ; and dispose yourself so, as if you
were even at the last affront, and the very
latest injury you were to receive in
marching under the cross of our Lord.”


## p. 256 (#266) ############################################

256 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
Cesario now laboured and struggled
with yet stronger emotion. The image
that address presented, was Giovanni's
bed of death; and whether on the field
of honour, or in the solemn peace of his
convent, that image was powerfully af.
fecting.
Wilder ideas melted before it; and
precipitating his face into his hands, he
wept to suffocation. He neither saw the
affixing of the spurs, nor heard the mass
that was said immediately afterwards:
he was roused a second time, only by the
voice of Giovanni himself, replying to
the injunctions and interrogatories of the
Grand Master. . -
When that full and mellow voice re-
peated after La Valette the vows of obe-
dience, chastity, and endurance of every
danger and toil for the sake of the true
faith, every note of it vibrated in the
heart of Cesario. His tears flowed anew,
but in a salutary stream of tender regret;
and he secretly prayed Heaven to grant

THE KNIGHT OF ST. John. 257
him a glorious death in defence of that
dear friend's life; or, his pardon, and
permission to embrace the same profes-
sion of arms and obedience. -
When he looked up again, Giovanni
was clothed in the black garment of the
Order; and having listened to the last
explanations of the Grand Master re-
specting the various beatitudes, and re-
ceived his instructions to pray for the
souls of their deceased brethren, the ce-
remony would have ended, but La Va-
lette, holding up the white subrevest with
its scarlet cross, which the knights wear
over their armour in battle, called on him
to approach and receive it.
Placing it with his own hands on the
body of Giovanni, he broke out in a
strain of eloquence which roused every
soul that heard him.
“Now was the day of battle,” he said,
“when that garment should be worn 1
The infidels were approaching, and every
knight must so array himself, to give

them meeting like true champions of
God and Christ. That garment must be
their robe of triumph or their shroud.”
He described the various miseries in-
flicted on the Christians by the impious
race of Mahomet; the countries they
ravaged; the multitudes they carried into
captivity. He detailed the sufferings of
their slaves; he reverted to the affronts
the Order had received from them at so
many different periods; and he called on
every chevalier present, to draw forth,
his sword in the name of their patron-
saint, and swear, with God’s leave, never
to sheathe it while a single enemy trod
their shore.
At this call, every sword was drawn
from its scabbard. The sound was like
the rushing of winds, like the roar of
waters, like the shout of distant mul-
titudes. -
The knights remained standing in re-
spectful expectation, with their shining
blades raised above their heads.


## p. 259 (#269) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 259
The pause was an impressive one. —
La Valette then set the example, and
with one movement they were all pro-
strate before the altar.
The Bishop of Malta now advanced to
the front of the sanctuary to pronounce
a benediction on their righteous purpose;
but overcome with the sight of so many
young and aged heads, bent down in
Christian submission, so soon to be lifted
up to meet the shock of war, and pe-
netrated with a foreboding conviction of
their danger, he attempted to speak, but
could not: he then raised his eyes in
mute prayer to Heaven, and extending
his arms over the kneeling crowd, re-
mained many minutes without moving.
His aged countenance was seen to
change during that affecting interval,
and his breast to heave; tears at length
trickled down his furrowed cheek; when
hastily retreating behind the altar, he
dissolved the assembly.

CHAPTER XII.
CesARio stood aloof with Don Felix, till
the principal performers in this striking
scene were out of the church; he then,
in a voice of stifled emotion, besought
his kind companion to bestow him some-
where remote from the quarters of Gio-
vanni, whose recognition it was his duty
to avoid, till he had redeemed his esteem
by worthy action. -
Toledo informed him that Signor Ci-
gala's station was the Fort of St. Elmo,
where he would most likely immediately
take his post: that being the fort most
exposed, yet most important for the de-
fence of the island.
Toledo himself was just adopted into
the squadron appointed to march round

THE KNIGHT of st. John. 261
the whole island, flying from point to .
point, menaced with a descent: this duty
had the charm of constant action and en-
terprise; and as such, was better suited
to his home-divided mind, than one re-
quiring the virtue of unsubmitting pa-
fience, united to those of valour and of
skill. He advised Cesario to offer himself
for the same service, proposing his im-
mediate presentation to the Grand Master.
Cesario gladly accepted the offer, at
the same time expressing his sense of
this generous reliance upon the good
faith of a stranger.
“And what should I suspect you of 2*
demanded the frank-hearted Toledo;
“ there is nothing to be got here but
hard blows, and perhaps, at Hast, empty
stomachs:—men do not generally im:
pose on others to get knocked on the
head with them.”
“But there are such wretches as spies,
—and perhaps private impulse should be
checked, when public good —”

262 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
- “By the virgin, I never thought of
that!” interrupted Toledo, stopping sud-
denly. Cesario's dark eye smiled; To-
ledo's reflected that amiable smile, and
setting off again in a quicker pace,
added, “Well, we’ll soon ascertain that,
— and I’m not afraid of the trial. The
governor will sift you to the utmost, in
affront of that honesty of look which
would give my heart the lie, if it were
capable of harbouring one doubt of
you.” -
“ Generous, generous Don Felix P
exclaimed Cesario aloud, and his secret
soul added,—“but thou shalt never rival
Giovanni.”
Toledo led him on to his own tempo-
rary residence in Il Borgo, where he left
him to learn the Grand Master’s hour of
leisure. - -
It was not long ere he returned, and
then he brought the agreeable inform-
ation of La Valette’s wish for the
stranger’s immediate presentation. Ce-

sario arose, and followed his guide in
silence. The interview with the Grand
Master ended to the satisfaction of all
parties: a letter from the Prince of
Melfi, and the certificate of Cesario’s
rank in the Genoese navy, were sufficient
credentials. La Valette assured him that
his reputation had already reached Malta,
making him wish that so brave a volun-
teer might find the fellowship of con-
genial spirits too precious to be resigned.
Cesario bowed, without other answer
than what his eloquent eyes gave, for his
heart was full : he thought of the cere-
mony he had just witnessed; and dared
not foresee that time, and those events,
which must appease his own self-abhor-
rence, ere he could solicit admission into
an order which would give him equality
once more with Giovanni.
The countenance of Toledo shone with
benevolent pleasure, as he received La
Valette's permission to present Cesario
in his name to the commander Copier,

264 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
whose troop they were to join, with other
volunteers, near the bay of Mugiaro; he
then led his new associate to his own
quarters till the morrow, when they were
to Set Out.
“Now, then,” said Toledo, “here ends
every thing about credulity and genero-
sity, and so forth : henceforth we are
yoke-fellows in war. You will fight to
regain your friend's heart, and I, to keep
that of my wife. Can we have better in-
spiration?”
*Cesario took the hand, then extended
to him in the spirit of manly sincerity, and
pressing it more than once very strongly,
replied in the words of Sophocles,
“On, then! and like two lions in the field
Roaming for prey, guard we each other well.”
The short remainder of this day was
employed in necessary arrangements;
and the night they partly consumed in
conversation.
Toledo enumerated the strangers who
were come, like Cesario, to combat from a

merely chivalric spirit; and amongst
these he mentioned two sons of the
Prince of Melfi.
Cesario was pleased to learn that these
were his old friends Marco, and Cynthio.
the fruitful source of all his brave father's
cares. -
Cynthio's appearance in the present
scene seemed an earnest, or rather a
proof of reformation from those destruc-
tive habits which find their full exercise
in luxurious capitals only; and as such,
Cesario felt his heart glow with joy for
the excellent Doria, and with something
of kindliness towards the young man
himself. -
The conversation then turned naturally
upon the early tie between Doria and the
elder Adimari; this produced some de-
scription of the characters of each;
which led Cesario insensibly into unre-
strained discourse of his father.
Once more did he find an ear attentive
to all he said upon that cherished sub-

ject; and while he spoke with humid
eyes of his father's virtues and misfor-
tunes, Toledo listened with that animated
pleasure which warms us, when we have
our best feelings called into action by
the character or communications of our
companions. Encouraged by the con-
geniality of their natures, he suffered him-
self to flow into confidence: he talked
of his wife, of their days of courtship,
and of all their hopes in the future.
“Ours was no common attachment!”
he said, after having told his own romance
by snatches. “You see it stood the test
of four long years, and those dismally
agitating ones. But fathers are not all
indulgent and reasonable; and lovers
rarely find out that they love one another
till they have nearly brought each other
to death's door. Perhaps Camilla and I.

delay; yet, it is hard, too, to be cheated.

gave it me the very day we parted
last!”
He took from his vest a small em-
broidered case, as he spoke, and opening
it, presented his companion with a set of
ivory tablets. Between the two last
leaves Cesario saw a very dark ringlet,
lying in its natural and glossy curl;
he admired it awhile; then turning his
eye to the opposite leaf, where he ob-
served written characters, asked with a
smile, if he might read them.
“As you please,” returned Toledo,
looking down upon the hilt of his sword,
and beginning to burnish it very busily
with his glove.
The verses ran thus: —
“ON A LOCK OF HAIR.
“Go, envied, to my husband's breast,
And there with love and honour stay;
Oft wilt thou to his lips be pressed,
While I, alas, am far away!
“Should cer unkindness start the tear,
Or cold neglect his bright cyes dim,

o, do thou bid him think of her
Who only lives to think of him."
“They are pretty good verses for a
woman, are they not ?” asked Toledo,
his face crimsoning with a mixture of
pleasure and confusion.
“I am no critic,” replied Cesario,
“ and I like the sentiment of this little
song too much to think whether it be
well or ill expressed; but indeed ,”
and then, of course, followed some good-
natured encomiums upon the versifica-
tion, &c. -
Toledo affected the same indifference
to these flattering remarks upon his
wife's verses, as he would really have
felt, had they been his own. Cesario,
meanwhile, opened the tablets in another
place, and recognising the same elegant
characters, asked permission to go on.
Toledo hesitated, and glanced his eye
upon the ivory page. “Shall I, or shall
I not give you further licence?” he

asked ; his manly features coloured like
those of a bashful girl. “You’ll think
me a fool and a coxcomb, perhaps, if I
do. Well! if a man is only proud of his
wife's attachment, and vain of its testi-
monials, there’s no great harm in it.
This little book,” he continued, taking
it in his hand, “I won from her, after
our marriage, with I don’t know how
many fond oaths that no eye but mine *
should ever rest on it. See, how ill I
keep my engagement!—but she knew
my heart too well, to believe I could
keep it; and when she said so, I smiled;
and that smile absolves me I think. It
was as good as a confession, that she
guessed right. There, you may read
one more.” -
Cesario accepted the permission, and
read these -

For who may near sweet roses dwell,
Nor bear away their fragrant smell?

Nor be like light to look upon P -
In those dear arms, beneath that eye,
Bosom'd in goodness should I lie;
While in his eyes my eyes would look,
They'd read them like some holy book,
And learn the rapturous lesson there, .
Of all that's excellent and rare:
Nay, e'en the beatings of his heart
Some answering virtue would impart,
And teach my heart the power to prove,
Of growing like the thing I love.”
Cesario read these verses twice, and
after the second reading shut the table
with a sigh. -
“Yes, faith, you've read quite enough!”
cried Toledo, gaily snatching them, yet
with a face all tenderness. “I hope you
know how to make allowance for the en-
thusiasm of affection. Camilla has one
of those true woman’s hearts, which
thinks the command to honour a hus-
band as delightful as the impulse to
love him; and so instead of persuading
herself that I am an Adonis, (which by
the way it would be difficult to do,) she

wisely gives her imagination the reins
where it is not so easy to stop it, and
erects me into a mirror of moral excel-
lence. You'll allow that it is not my in-
terest to undeceive her ?” -
Had Cesario looked on Toledo at that
moment, he might have thought it re-
quired no stretch of fancy in his wife to
find matchless beauty in a countenance
bright with every noble and lovely ex-
pression. -
But Cesario was lost in other thoughts:
he was contrasting the verses just read,
with many which he had himself inspired;
and the difference of their spirit struck
him forcibly. Beatrice used to paint his
outward graces in a variety of lights, and
with a vivid pencil perhaps; but he could
not remember one stanza, where his
nobler endowments were the subject,
not one which was calculated to kindle
in him an ambition to reach beyond wha
he was. -

already all that his wife described, her
belief that he was so, must inspire him
with the wish, and endue him with the
power to realise her fancy.
Thus, then, the very partiality of such
a woman tended to elevate her husband’s
character in this world, and to fit it for
the next: while on the contrary, he
whose best impulses were lulled into
sleep by the sweet opiate of purely per-
sonal admiration, must soon sink into
oblivion here, nor rise hereafter to the
bliss and dignity of immortal beings. .
“I am glad,” he said, at length, “that
you permitted me to read both these little
poems; they give me so clear a view of
Donna Camilla’s character. When she
writes but for herself, (as she certainly in-
tended the last verses,) her innocent yet
glowing affection is poured out without
reserve; but when she writes that affec-
tion direct to her husband—even her
husband — how delicately restrained is
the expression and the sentiment 1

“This is indeed a heart to anchor a
man's soul upon.” Cesario said the last
words with an air of complete abstrac-
tion; for they belonged to a set of ideas
which Camilla’s tender and modest cha-
racter had called up; and, absorbed in
feelings past, hopes deceived, passions
too skilfully played upon, he remained
a long time silent. At length he shook
off that selfish reverie, and asked Toledo
what “unkindness” his wife alluded to
in her first stanzas 2 Could she dread it
from the exemplary La Valette?
“O none from him?” returned Toledo,
hemming away a sigh, “but I was never
a favourite with my father, and so forth;
and there was one subject upon which
Camilla knew we should have frequent
altercations; and though it is a man’s
duty to remonstrate with his parent,
when he believes him influenced to do
what is not right, he has always some
filial qualms after it; that is what she
means. The tear, you know, is only a

poetical licence, — I am not given to
weep.” - -
Cesario enquired no further, believing
the subject he had unwarily touched
upon too tender for continuance.
In truth, though not of the private
nature he conjectured, it was one which
pierced a son's jealous honour to the
quick; for it might possibly shade his
father's reputation hereafter.
It related to the shameful counsels of
Spain with regard to Malta; and which,
though Don Garcia di Toledo believed
it his duty to obey, even while detesting
them, his son, aware of the odium that
must follow this desertion of a dependant
and ally, thought his father's honour
demanded the protest of dignified resis-
tance. -
He was therefore constant in his en-
treaty that his father would remonstrate
more earnestly with their Royal master;
and rather resign the splendid post he
held in Sicily, than purchase a conti-

nuance in it at the price of his repu-
tation for good faith. -
It was with these feelings, and from
a fear that Don Garcia’s ambition would
not yield to a nobler love of distinction,
that his son, whose integrity was firm
as the rock he then trod, tore himself
from the arms of domestic happiness,
determined that he at least should live or
die without the opprobrium of deserting
the brave vanguard of Christendom. '
Anxious, however, to give his parent
the full measure of admiration due to
him, Toledo was enlarging upon those
military actions of his, which the
historians of those days have recorded
with such animation, when an unusual
noise of steps and voices in the town
made him start from his seat.
He ran to the window, and rushing
back, caught up his sword, exclaiming,
“I see the signal fire!—the enemy must
be in sight.” -
Cesario sprang after him, and with so

eager a bound, that he got to the en-
trance of their abode at the same instant
of time.
As they hurried into the open street,
they saw the knights pouring from their
different inns, half-attired, and tumult-
uously scaling the steep ascents to get
a wider view of the surrounding scene.
A blaze of light in the direction of the
road of Sirocco, was the signal Toledo
mentioned: to that quarter all eyes were
now directed. It flamed upwards with
strong illumination, while all the other
parts of the island lay in complete
shadow. *
Toledo hurried Cesario up with him
to the ramparts of St. Angelo, where they
stopped and looked round.
They saw the sea to the eastward
covered with ships, extending as far as
the eye could reach, and advancing with
their lanthorns lighted, and all their sails
set, before a steady breeze.
Toledo gazed on that formidable ar-

mada with dauntlessness and admira-
tion.
“A gallant show, by heaven º’ he
exclaimed, turning to Cesario: the latter
did not answer, but stood eagerly leaning
forward, his kindling eyes fixed on the
sublime scene exhibited on the ocean.
It seemed as if he drank in draughts of
ardor as he gazed; for his soul was indeed
all roused within him; and, every selfish
care forgot, he thought only of the great
destruction for which this armada was
prepared. -
Toledo contemplated him awhile with
a luminous look of sympathetic appro-
bation; then, striking him on the shoul-
der, exclaimed, “Wake, my friend, from
your trance!—wake, and let us run to
realise all that you are dreaming of.”

of an illuminated countenance; it was
an eloquent illumination which Toledo's
reflected, and which rendered words un-
necessary: indeed, for the next half hour,

as they hurried from St. Angelo to the
residence of the Grand Master, and
thence to the rendezvous of volunteers
for their troop, they were quite uncon-
scious that they conversed by the inter-
change of looks alone. -
Meanwhile, the heavy tread of foot-
soldiers, the clang of armour, the rattling
noise of ordnance wheeling along the
ramparts, the thundering close of gates,
the erection of standards, the tumult of
haste, and the rush of eagerness; the
whole rock, in short, alive with men
and movement, afforded a singular con-
trast to the majestic stillness and uni-
formity of the scene at sea. There, the
white-winged vessels only differed from
each other in magnitude; they were
otherwise the same, advancing with equal
order and steadiness over the level plain
before them.
At the moment Cesario was marking
this contrast in his own mind, La Valette
passed in his hasty way to St. Angelo:

Toledo left his ranks to run after him a
few paces.
The brave Governor turned round at
his voice, and casting on him a look al-
most paternal, exclaimed, “My gallant
hostage!” He strained him in his arms
as he spoke; and his cheek, as it rested
against that of the young warrior, made
the other’s moist.
“Back to your post!” he cried, re-
leasing him. “With God’s blessing, we
shall meet again. Young man, your
father must disperse that fleet, when once
it has landed its host, and then our swords
must do the rest.”
Toledo waved his bright sword in token
of his own loyal purpose, and fell back
into the ranks. -
“Let no one say that youth only is
charming!” he said, turning to Cesario.
“Can any countenance be more attrac-
tive than that of La Valette 2 What a
picture does he make at this moment,
with his gray hairs blowing in the wind,

and his eagle eye softening every time he
stoops to embrace and bless his children'
for we all think ourselves so.”,
Cesario's eyes were rivetted on the
same object with similar feelings. He
watched the august La Valette as he went
along, stopped every moment by knights
hurrying to their posts, who would not
depart without a hasty supplication for
their Grand Master’s benediction.
These intrepid chevaliers, kneeling for
an instant with their helmets raised from
their heads, then starting up, and darting
away like so many flashes of light, seemed
a distinct race of men, hitherto unknown
by Cesario. -
How could it be otherwise, when every
countenance was irradiated by the sub-
limest enthusiasm : -
He looked round; but Giovanni was
no where to be seen . He looked then
at the rocky point of Sceberras, and
doubting not that his friend was already
in the fortress there, he fervently prayed


## p. 281 (#291) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 281
that St. Elmo, at least, might be found
impregnable. -
The order to march terminated these
reflections; when, giving a second wish-
ful look to the embattled fort, and dread-
ing to think whether it were in the decrees
of Heaven that he and Giovanni should
ever meet again, he turned away, reso-
lute to deserve, if not to win such hap-
piness.

CHAPTER XIII.
While Cesario was rapidly approaching
the enemy, Giovanni, unconscious of his
proximity, was lending all the powers of
his greatly-gifted mind to strengthen
the different fortresses round the two
ports.
He was equally skilled in the science
of defence as in that of attack; for he
had studied engineering with deep atten-
tion, and his suggestions had already im-
proved and extended the fortifications
round St. Angelo itself. -
St. Elmo was originally built with the
view of protecting Malta from attacks
by sea, as it commanded the entrance of
both the great and lesser ports; so that
on that side it was deemed impregnable:


## p. 283 (#293) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JoHN. 283
but on the land side, the defences were
not so strong, nor indeed the ground
favourable to their construction. But
Giovanni, earnestly advising the addition
of more efficient entrenchments, sug-
gested several new ideas, inspired by a
genius which seized capabilities hitherto
unobserved, and triumphed over obsta-
cles always believed invincible.
He was the first to imagine the pro-
bability of an attack being made upon
St. Elmo by land; urging the certainty of
the Turkish army's advance in its rear,
while their ships of war would beleaguer
it in front. - -
The event fulfilled his prediction.
Their fleet, taking advantage of a dark
night, landed the troops in a bay to the
eastward, whence they spread themselves
over the country between that ‘and St.
Catharine's, pillaging and massacring
all who offered resistance.
The path of these formidable infidels
was to be tracked in the blood of the

peasantry, and the ashes of the surround-
ing villages. At first they seemed irreso-
lute whether to fall at once upon the
ancient capital, and so cut off the supplies
of the different garrisons, or to invest St.
Angelo and Il Borgo, or to attack St.
Elmo.
They suddenly determined upon the
last enterprise, believing St. Elmo's com-
mand of the two entrances rendered it
the most important object ; and flatter-
ing themselves that it could not hold out
above a few days. -
In this belief they marched straight
from St. Catharine’s to Mount Sceberras,
where they established their camp, and
began to trace their lines.
It was during the rapid and destructive
march of this army, that Giovanni first
heard of Cesario: he heard of him as
the foremost and the bravest of that gal-
lant troop, that handful of heroes, who
were the first to brave death in opposition
to those locusts of the East. -


## p. 285 (#295) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 285
This troop, taking advantage of the
local circumstances of ground and time,
though consisting but of three hundred
men (principally peasants), watched the
motions of the enemy, hung upon their
rear, and, falling upon their straggling
parties, cut off their return to the main
body. . -
It is true, half his own number fell in
these bold skirmishes; but he attained
his object of retarding the progress of
the infidels, and therefore his followers
deemed their own blood cheaply spilt.
When the Turkish army encamped on
Mount Sceberras, this troop was recalled,
and the survivors distributed amongst the
stationary posts.
The joyful thrill which shot through
Giovanni's veins, when he first heard that
Cesario was in the same island with him,
and had already distinguished himself
beyond his brave associates, – that joy-
ful thrill told him the indestructibility of
his friendship.

286 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
Many a romantic possibility passed in
a moment through his mind, each tend-
ing to exalt the character of Cesario, to
prove his repentance, and to make it
virtue in Giovanni to open his arms to
him once more. -
No one saw the tear which Giovanni
turned aside to brush off, as the fearless
enterprises of this cherished friend were
related to him as a matter of mere talk
by the Chevalier de la Cerda. His heart
throbbed in silence: for, except towards
Cesario, Giovanni had never felt an un-
controllable impulse to pour out its most
tumultuous feelings, save at the foot of
the Cross. -
To look into the future, and imagine
a moment in which he might claim his
friend again without shame; that friend
proved by time and trial; and, by such
means, justly restored in his own opinion
to that precious feeling of equality with-
out which there is no friendship; — to
imagine this, was to console himself for

the past, and to animate him through the
present. -
He felt the blessing of such a prospect;
and, looking up to heaven, he ejaculated
a fervent thanksgiving. -
He withdrew his eyes, to fix them, with
his disciplined thoughts, upon the formid-
able scene below.
He was standing with De la Cerda in
a redoubt flanking one of the entrench-
ments of St. Elmo, and from this point
he took in the full sweep of the enemy's
lines. -
Giovanni had not been in the fortress
since his first observation of its defi-
ciencies and capabilities; and he was but
now returned from visits of a similar
kind. . . He saw with astonishment the
camp of Mustapha extending over the
whole of the mountain : it followed its
abrupt declivities, and was defended by
huge mortar batteries.
Every where pioneers and soldiers were
at work, in cutting trenches, rearing pa-

escalade. -
Meanwhile St. Elmo thundered upon .
them with all her guns; but, though the
Turks fell in numbers, others immediately
supplied their places.
Giovanni turned his eyes from that
enormous camp, first to St. Elmo, and
then to an eminence since called Dragut's
Point, which runs parellel with Mount
Sceberras, on the other side of the lesser
port. A battery erected on that point
might actually enfilade the fort: it was
therefore a highly important station; and
his quick glance had formerly taken in
all its capacity of annoyance.
He started now to see it had not been
secured. He did not speak, but he
looked again on St. Elmo. -
The steep rock on which it stood, (the
very pinnacle of Sceberras,) was so narrow,
that at best it did not afford room for
fortifications, however well-conceived, of
any extent. Thus the safety of the place
must entirely depend upon the resolution

of its defenders; for if the Turks were
able to complete the numerous batteries
which they were now constructing be-
fore the Spaniards should arrive, they
would soon batter down the fort itself,
and leave but a naked station to be con-
tested at the point of the sword, and won
by the fall of the last knight.
“So shall it be won, if it ever be
won,” said Giovanni internally; and he
turned away from De la Cerda, to seek
the governor Dueguerras, and to urge
the necessity of immediately erecting a
ravelin upon the rampart facing Cape
Tragut.
The whistling of bullets through the
stillest air imaginable, was the only sound
heard around him as he ascended the
rocky steps of the fortress; but Gio-
vanni heard it not, for he was familiarised
to its deadly whisper, and intent upon his
own thoughts. Yet is that single sound
enough to chill the stoutest heart: the
clash of sabres, and the roar of cannon,

sounds; but the low, rushing whir of
bullets is so traiterously disproportionate
to the fatal certainty of the death they
carry, that it resembles in effect the
cautious tread of a midnight murderer. .
Whoever has once heard that sound,
can never forget the horrible seizure of
the moment in which it first struck his
ear. Yet there has existed a warrior
who exclaimed upon such an occasion,
“ Henceforth this is my music!”
On reaching the Governor, Giovanni
ventured modestly, but firmly, to repeat
his ideas of the neglected station on the
other side of the port; offering, if Due-
guerras would give him leave, and supply
him with means, to eross the bay with a
few other knights, and establish himself
on the pointere the enemy could seize it.
Afraid of weakeninghis garrison, (which
did not indeed exceed two hundred men,
including serving brothers and soldiers,)

Dueguerras excused himself from follow-
ing this judicious counsel, alleging that
reason; and assuring Giovanni, that the
Viceroy of Sicily with his fleet of trans-
ports and ships of war, and Prince Doria,
with the gallies of the republic, would
appear off the island, even before the
enemy could make a 'single lodgment in
their covert way. - -
Giovanni shook his head. — -
“You doubt the Viceroy's sincerity 1"
asked the sanguine, therefore credulous
old warrior. “It has ever been my opi-
nion,” replied Giovanni, “that what a
mān intends to do, he does as promptly
as possible. Will is always accompanied
by action. The Viceroy promises and
apologises; explains and promises again;
again disappoints and again explains. Ex-
cept his brave and open-hearted son, not a
single man has he lent to our cause.
Facts speak with the tongues of angels,
my honoured Sir.” -
“But you know that a great convoy

of ships, and troops, and stores, are not
moved by the act of one will, as a man
marches his own body?” said Dueguer-
ras, smiling in obstinate but good-humour-
ed disbekief; “and it is so much the inte-
rest of Spain to preserve us, (for are we
not the very outpost of her Italian posses-
sions 2) that, putting aside all the obliga-
tions of honour and gratitude, this con-
sideration alone makes it absurd to doubt
the intentions of the Spaniards.”
Again Giovanni shook his head, and
said earnestly, “We must judge of a
man's probable conduct, not by our own
measure of reasonableness, but by his.
Philip's policy is notoriously narrow and
selfish; and the noble Toledo must be
guided by it. I am convinced that the in-
-clinations of the latter are to bring his
whole force directly to the aid of the
Grand Master. His son’s character and
conduct are my warrant for this; nay,
his very presence here is convincing.
But if Philip fancies that the ships and

troops under the governors of Tripoli
and Algiers, which are said to be ex-
pected by yonder host, are to be employ-
ed against Sicily, when deserted by her
Viceroy and fleet, is it not quite in the
nature of his short-sighted policy, to
leave Malta to her own resources? and
must not his Viceroy obey the harsh
command, however unwillingly.”
“Then why not say so?— why heap
promise upon promise 2"
“Because it is Philip's interest to sup-
port our spirits with hope,” was Gio-
vanni's remark, with a sigh at Dueguerras’
pernicious dependence.
He then resumed his entreaties for per-
mission to attempt securing the position
on the adjacent eminence; but finding
no arguments available against the Go-
vernor’s fear of weakening his garrison,
he suggested the idea of the ravelin, and
went away, rejoiced that at least on that
subject his representations were to be
attended to.

From this moment the operations of
the Turks proceeded with such rapidity,
that, in less than five days from their
landing, they had brought their artil-
lery to the very foot of St. Elmo, raised
their platforms and gabions, and opened
a terrible fire from a battery of cannon,
charged with bullets of stone.
At every shock of this tremendous
battery, some part of the fort fell in
ruins over its defenders in the trenches.
The Turks shot at a single and fixed
mark, while the besieged had to scatter
their fire over so much ground, and
so many objects, that the destruction,
though great in reality, was compara-
tively small. -
It was evident that unless the Sicilian
succours arrived to raise the siege, by
blocking up the Turkish fleet in the bay
of Mugiaro, and attacking their camp in
the rear, the fort must soon be reduced
to dust. Thus would fall the actual
key of the island; after that, nothing

would obstruct their entrance into both
the great and lesser port, and the re-
duction of the inner fortresses could not
then be the work of many more days.
Anxious to preserve his position to the
last, and confident only in the bulwark
of dauntless souls, Dueguerras deputed
De la Cerda to go and solicit a reinforce-
ment from the Grand Master at St.Angelo.
Unhappily for the reputation of all within
St. Elmo, De la Cerda was the only one
of that garrison whose valour could not
stand the test of extraordinary danger.
Terrified by some hideous cruelties al-
ready exercised by the enemy on their
prisoners, he went beyond his commis-
sion; and though he could not paint in
too strong colours the desperate state
of St. Elmo, nor exaggerate the imminent
danger of its garrison, he misrepresented
their inextinguishable spirit.
He described their alarming diminu-
tion of numbers, in consequence of their
perpetual exposure to the fire of the

enemy, and the intense heats of the
weather; and he asserted that they were
so dismayed by their hourly losses, and
by the growing strength of their adver-
sary, that he was convinced they would
not hold out above six days longer.
La Valette was seated in the midst of
the knights belonging to the posts of St.
Angelo and Castile, when De la Cerda
made this imprudent assertion; he started
up in a flame of virtuous indignation:—
“These are not the sentiments of the
veteran Dueguerras!” he exclaimed; “and
if they are those of the boys unworthy
his command, (for I will not call such
timid soldiers men,) it is time their places
should be filled with others of nobler
metal. I will throw myself into St.
Elmo, and bury these bones under its
ruins, rather than live to see it in the
power of infidels. Shame on the
knight who would consent to quit it a
living man, when the crescent should
supplant the Cross!”


## p. 297 (#307) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 297
La Valette had scarcely spoken, when
a crowd of warriors pressed round him,
deprecating his departure from St. An-
gelo, the citadel of the island, for what
they termed an outpost like St. Elmo.
Each brave spirit demanded leave to join
the garrison of that fort; and, after a
short but lively contest of self-devotion,
it was determined that two experienced
chevaliers should lead some companies of
foot, together with a certain number of
knights and a party of the lately-arrived
volunteers from foreign countries, to its
support.
Amongst the first who offered them-
selves, were Toledo and Cesario; the
former burning to atone with his life, if
that were necessary, for his father's forced
delay; and the other thirsting to draw
nearer Giovanni, and court some blessed
chance of shielding that precious head
in the peril of the expected assault.
But La Valette, putting Cesario back
with his hand, accompanied with a glance

of his powerful eye, said in a low tone,
“I have other work for you, Adimari;
wait till I can tell you what!”—turned
to Toledo, and gently delivered his rea-
sons for wishing to retain him near his
own person. -
These reasons were of a nature too
flattering to Toledo's affection for the
Grand Master, not to silence him, how-
ever reluctantly; and laying his hand on
his breast, where there were yet-gaping
wounds got in the late skirmishes, to bear
witness of his truth, he turned to embrace
with a cordial farewell, some of his de-
parting associates.
Meanwhile La Valette walked aside
with Cesario, to whom he spoke of his
uneasiness at the protracted delays of
Toledo's father; and asked if he would
undertake the dangerous service of get-
ting out of port, with his nephew the
Chevalier La Valette, whom he meant to
send at any risk to Sicily.

though a brave soldier; and Cesario's
nautical experience, in case of any ac-
cident, would be inestimable.
Besides which, if Prince Doria were in
the harbour of Messina, Cesario might
either induce him to sail without waiting
for the Sicilian fleet, or learn to a cer.
tainty the intentions of the Seigniory.
When Cesario obeyed the motion of
La Valette's arm, as it gently restrained
his impetuous action of entreaty when the
reinforcement of St. Elmo was discussing,
he resolved that nothing should put him
from his purpose of becoming one of the
garrison; but this appeal was conclusive:
he knew his own influence over the worthy
Doria to be greater than that of his son’s
inow at Malta, and he knew still better
his own ardent zeal. - -
Doria must have great weight with the
crown of Spain; perhaps the existence of
Malta might depend upon Cesario's con-
sent or refusal to make this desperate

destiny to speed those succours which
were to save St. Elmo!—perhaps this ser.
vice might be deemed enough by Gio-
vanni to warrant him in renewing their
league of soul. -
What agitating, what animating possi-
bilities Ought he to renounce them?—
ought he, in short, to give up so great
a public duty for the indulgence of any
private feeling 2
He looked on Toledo, whose whole
countenance was at that moment in a
glow of generous ardour, but whose se-
cret affections were, he well knew, with
his young bride; the view stung him
into noble emulation. He replied to the
Grand Master at once ; accepted the
service; thanked him for the enviable
distinction it conferred; and, receiving
his further instructions to conceal his in-
tended voyage from Don Felix, lest it
should wound his sensitive honour, he
left the council-hall. -

That very evening, while the cannon .
of St. Angelo were covering the short .
but perilous passage of the reinforce-
ments across the great port, a ball struck
the Turkish : General, and for several
hours threw such consternation among
the enemy, that Cesario believed this the
favourable moment for getting out to sea.
He threw himself, with Henri La Valette,
into the galliot destined for them; and,
favoured by the darkness of night, which
mothing illuminated but incessant flashes
from the guns of the castlé, steered safely
out of harbour. -
Cesario looked up to St. Elmo, as they
doubled the point on which it stood; the ,
fort was scarcely distinguishable from
that black and frowning rock; and on
the-sea side all was still : but the roar of
artillery behind it, and in front of the
Turkish camp, convinced him that the
work of death was going on.—Giovanni!

plosion which shook the shores and the
sea, might carry his fate with it!
This was not a thought to be dwelt
on by the man whom duty forbade to
share such danger with his friend:
he wrested his mind resolutely from it;
and commending that dearly-loved friend
to the protection of Heaven and his own
nobleness, took the helm of the galley,
and turned her head towards Sicily.

CHAPTER I.
The Chevalier who led the reinforce-
ment to St. Elmo, found congenial ardour
in Giovanni; and, no sooner was he ar-
rived, than a sally was determined and
executed.
The new troops rushed from the fort,
and, falling upon the Turks in their
trenches, drove them out with prodigious
slaughter. Quickly rallying, however,
and supported by the whole strength of
their camp, the enemy not only regained
their lines, but, favoured by a strong
wind, which blew back the smoke pro-

ceeding from the artillery of the fort,
they possessed themselves of the counter-
scarp, and began to rain a fire of musque-
try upon the ravelin. - -
When the smoke cleared, and dis-
covered the Turkish colours flying on the
counterscarp, (whence the Janizaries
took murderous aim at every knight as
he advanced,) some of the garrison called
loudly for the immediate blowing up of
this unfortunate work; but, Giovanni
not only abhorring such inglorious de-
struction, but desirous of checking the
despondent spirit which prompted it,
threw himself singly upon the enemy,
crying out, “Rather let us regain it!”
He was followed by the chevaliers
only; but they, inflamed with honourable
shame and setting life at nought, when
compared with honour, rushed so im-
petuously upon the infidels that they
were a second time driven beyond their
trenches. .
In such alternations of fortune passed

day after day: the Turks fought like
tigers; and the besieged, like men who
know the value of that for which they .
contend. But though the slaughter in
the infidel camp was infinitely greater
than that in the folt, the consequences
were woefully disproportionate: for the
Christians were becoming hourly more
exposed by the shattered state of the
fortress itself, and no reinforcements
came to fill up the dismal chasms made
in their ranks. -
In this condition they heard with hor-
ror the thundering cannon which an-
nounced the arrival of Dragut with a fleet
of gallies and 3000 fresh troops.
His presence soon announced itself by
more terrible proofs; for Dragut's expe-
rimental knowledge in the science of
sieges was even greater than that of
Errard himself, then the military oracle
of Europe; and the masterly dispositions
the infidel now made, threatened soon to
reduce the fort to a heap of ashes,

The venerable Dueguerras beheld these
new arrangements with dismay: he saw
too, with instant self-condemnation, four
enormous culverins planted upon that
parallel point, which Giovanni had so
strenuously urged him to secure; and
which now battered the flanks of his
ravelin and cavalier with a fury that
menaced the whole western side of the
fort with destruction. r
Even the sanguine spirit of the old
knight must have fainted under these ill-
boding appearances, had not the infor-
mation he received from St. Angelo re-
stored his hopes. Henri la Valette had
returned from Sicily with the Viceroy's
solemn promise of sending part, if not
the whole of his fleet and army, in less
than ten days, to the relief of the island.
Cesario had remained in Sicily, to wait
the arrival of Prince Doria, according to
previous instructions; and his arguments,
it was believed, would certainly expe-
dite the succours.

The KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 5
Having communicated these gladden-
ing tidings to his garrison, Dueguerras
required them to call up their resolution,
and defend themselves manfully, since
their day of deliverance drew nigh.
The garrison, with one voice, expressed
their determination of standing out to
the last gasp of their lives; and each
man then betook himself to his post.
In the middle of the second night
after Dragut's appearance in the infidel
camp, Giovanni was alarmed by an un-
usual noise, whilst in the act of applying
a bandage to a severe wound which Ro-
dolphe had got in the trenches the day
before. He started from the ground on
which he was kneeling, and at that mo-
ment a horrid shout and a volley of fire-
arms assured him that the enemy were
within the Christian lines. He threw the
bandages to a serving-brother,and, giving
Rodolphe a hasty benediction, rushed
out amongst the combatants.
'. He found Ottomans and Christians mixed

together without the fort, in confused
but horrid carnage: the enemy had dis.
covered an entrance to the ravelin
through a port-hole, and, getting from
thence into the cavalier, had quickly
overpowered the few soldiers defend-
ing it. -
When Giovanni rushed into the open
air, he found soldiers, knights, and serv.
ing-brothers all running in consternation
towards the cavalier. -
The struggle which followed was des.
perate: the enemy were repulsed with
prodigious loss, and driven even beyond
the ravelin; but every man that fell had
thousands to supply his place; while the
wasted garrison of St. Elmo was like a
tree shaken by autumnal blasts, which
every fresh gust despoils to be replenished
Ino more. -
Giovanni was in all quarters of the
fight with the celerity of thought; and
everywhere he saw the aged Dueguerras
opposing his scarred breast to the scyme-

tars of the infidels. He would have
urged him to retire; and with nearly
filial tenderness besought him to do so;
but the old man, reddening as he spoke,
and pointing to the distant cape from
which was pouring the storm of Dragut's
culverins, said, “This is the only advice
I will ever neglect again;” and he threw
himself into the thick of the fight. The
Turks, newly-reinforced, had by this time
secured the ravelin, and returned to the
attack of the cavalier; yet did the fort
still hail upon them showers of balls and
stones, and flaming pitch: at length the
good cause triumphed, and they were
once more beat back.
At the ravelin, however, they rallied;
and, supported by constant accessions of
force from their camp, were no longer
to be dislodged. The counterscarp was
covered with their slain, and so many of
the knights had fallen, that both parties
seemed tacitly to demand a suspension
of arms.

Dueguerras himself was amongst the
wounded: but he roused himself to
examine the state of his garrison, and
found it alarmingly reduced.
Two-thirds were either killed or dis-
abled; and the infidels, growing in num-
bers, were now in possession of one of
the principal outworks of the fort.
In the dead of the ensuing night he
contrived to convey his wounded across
the port to Il Borgo, and at the same
time he prayed for a second reinforce-
ment. . . - -
La Valette sent him what troops he
could spare from the other fortresses;
which, though not then in a state of
actual siege, he was obliged to hold in
momentary expectation of a surprise.
From this period the condition of the
besieged grew daily more critical: the
Turks, inspirited by the hardy counsels
and skill of Dragut, and drawing prodi-
gious advantages from their superiority in
numbers and artillery, and their extended

position, baffled all the science of the
engineers of the Order, and all the
heroism of its knights.
Every living soul that went forth to
repulse their fierce attacks, went self.
devoted to death : they fell like so many
appointed victims.
The grief of La Valette when he heard
their fate, was as poignant as his admi-
ration of their constancy was fervent;
and so impatient was he for the relief of
this suffering garrison, that no sooner
was Cesario arrived with Prince Doria’s
assurance of joining the Sicilian fleet,
than he was sent back again to urge the
instant appearance of both fleets, and to
paint the desperate situation of St. Elmo.
In contempt of imminent danger, Ce-
sario continued to cross the channel in
a bark so slight that it was scarcely able
to weather the frequent gales which as-
sailed it. In getting out and into port,
which he always contrived at night, he
dared the perpetual risk of being taken

by the enemy's cruisers; but the Grand
Master depended on his skill and his
zeal; and though Cesario panted for
closer action, and thought chiefly of Gio.
vami, he believed it his duty to continue
that irksome but useful service.
His suspicions of the Viceroy's since-
rity, now amounted to absolute certainty;
for Prince Doria doubted it; and had
wrung his hands in bitterness of soul,
when he received the Seigniory's positive
orders not to risk his gallies by an indis-
creet attempt to succour Malta unless
previously joined by the ships of Spain.
The Grand Master himself began
now to dismiss all expectation from that
quarter: but it was necessary not to dis-
close this opinion, lest the courage of his
different garrisons should sink at once.
He therefore dispatched Cesario again
to Sicily, as if to press the succours; but
in reality to raise money upon the
various possessions of the Order in Italy,

with which he must hire troops and
transports, and buy ammunition.
. Meanwhile the Turks advanced in
such numbers to the attack of the de-
fences of St. Elmo, that they had already
run up the ravelin so high as to overlook
the parapet of the place, and were be-
ginning to undermine the wall.
By the aid of a temporary bridge,
they got over the ditch which lay be-
tween them and the wall, and clapping
their scaling ladders to it, made a show
as if they would storm the fort at once.
Giovanni, who was at that moment
standing on the highest battlement to
observe the plans of the enemy, saw all
the garrison rushing, as if by one im-
pulse, to the place threatened. He
called loudly on them to stop; for he
was convinced it was a stratagem.
From his elevated position, he saw
the whole range of Turkish artillery
levelled in that direction. His voice
was unheard: the rashly gallant men

presented themselves in a body upon the
rampart, and as immediately disappeared
under the fire of those dreadful batteries;
they fell, as if a scythe had mowed them
down with a stroke.
Giovanni rushed from the battlements
to the wall; and there he beheld, in-
deed, the slaughter he had foreseen.
On emerging from the postern of the
fort, he was struck and wounded in the
forehead by the splinter of a cuirass;
but scarcely feeling the acute pain it
gave, he advanced towards the scene of
destruction. While he held his blood-
streaming head downwards, he stood
mute with anguish, looking upon the
lifeless bodies of all that brave phalanx.
Feeble accents from a heap of slain
roused him from his mournful trance;
and, wiping away the blood that flowed
over his dimmed eyes, he stooped to ex-
tricate the wounded knight! -
It was Cynthio Doria: the unhappy
young man grasped Giovanni's hand

with death and anguish in his face, at
the same time faltering out, — “ I
cannot live, Cigala; take me into the
chapel; I would die there, sinner that
I am!—there, perhaps — Heaven 35
his senses forsook him at these words;
but Giovanni, hoping that life might yet
be recalled, lifted him from the ground,
and bore him in his arms to the chapel
of the fort.
The motion, and the brisker current
of air, through which he was carried,
brought Cynthio back to sense ; the
few religious attached to the garrison
were saying mass for the success of their
warring brethren; and Giovanni, deli-
vering up to them his sad burden, was
about to return to the rampart, when
the dying man feebly detained him.
“Stay a moment in Christian charity!”
he gasped out, in intermitting accents;
“tell my poor father that I die lament-
ing my many offences against him. If

my life has disgraced his noble name,
my death, I hope, —”
Articulation failed him at that instant;
he turned his dim and glazing eyes
feebly towards the symbol of redemption
upon the altar, and, closing them again,
his hand just pressed, and then dropped
that of Giovanni. -
The latter retained him upon his
breast a few moments afterwards, and
his eyes rested awhile upon the altered
face with an expression of awe and re-
gret: then, fetching a sigh fraught with
many remembrances, he transferred the
body to the chaplains, and returned to
his duty.
By the time he reached the rampart
again, he found the enemy had most
inexplicably withdrawn, and the surviv-
ing knights busily employed in removing
the corses of their companions.
Dueguerras was standing in the midst,
tears coursing one another down his
furrowed cheeks, as he watched with a

fixed gaze the progress of their dismal
work. He wept the fate of so much
bravery and youth; but he contemplated
without one throb of fear his own
almost certain fall under the same
'swords. -
Penetrated with sorrow for the fallen,
and believing it his duty to save the
survivors if possible, he asked Giovanni
if he would undertake to cross to St. An-
gelo, and represent their state once
more to La Valette; showing him the
necessity they were under of immediately
evacuating the fortress, if they would
not perish in the impossible attempt of
resisting an assault.
“ I cannot be the bearer of such a
message,” replied Giovanni, leaning on
his sword, overcome with sickness from
the wound which he was stanching with
his handkerchief.
“You are wounded, I see P’ exclaim-
ed Dueguerras, misinterpreting his an-
swer; “go and be taken care of — I

must find another messenger.” Gio-
vanni bowed his head without speaking,
and retired abruptly.
Happily for him, the fever consequent
on this wound disabled him so com-
pletely, that he gave no countenance by
his presence to the desperate councils
which followed. -
The Grand Master replied to the first
representation of the besieged, after the
destruction on the rampart, by the most
pathetic lamentations over their suffer-
ings and losses; but also with strong
arguments in support of his opinion, that
the whole island depended upon the pro-
tracted holding out of St. Elmo; and by
entreaties that its defenders would new-
string their courage, and rely upon his
fatherly anxiety to recruit them with
men and provisions, to the extent of his
limited power. - -
This reply was received with indig-
nation by more than half the garrison:
they considered themselves wantonly de-

voted to slaughter, since the delay of
the Sicilian succours rendered their relief
nearly impossible; and, believing that
sooner or later the fort must fall, they
accused their Grand Master of Savage
indifference in thus exacting a fruitless
waste of their lives.
The malcontents, unknown to their
Governor, drew up a memorial of griev-
ances, declaring their resolution (in case
the Grand Master refused them permis-
sion to evacuate the fort,) to sally from
it sword in hand, and perish at once in
fair fight, rather than stay to be but-
chered in cold blood by their barbarian
conquerors.
One of their members bore this memo-
rial to St. Angelo. He returned after
a short absence, accompanied by three
senior knights, commissioned to ascer-
tain the strength of the place; and he
brought an indignant answer from La
Valette,
When this awful answer was read

aloud to the assembled malcontents,
each man bent his head in shame and
remorse: at every indignant line, they
fancied they met the penetrating eye of
their father and prince, overwhelming
them with a sense of their own baseness
and his disdain.
In this justly-severe letter, he called
on them to remember, that when they
took the habit of St. John, they took on
themselves an obligation to surrender up
their judgments and wills into the ex-
perienced hands of their master: he bade
them remember, that they had other
duties to perform, besides those of rush-
ing into battle; that they must practise
patience and obedience, and trust in
God; and that if it were his Divine will
that they should stand and meet death
at their posts, they were bound to await
it cheerfully. - .
“What hope ye,” he asked in a flame
of noble indignation, “ from a removal
to Il Borgo? Do you expect that the

Will your hearts grow stouter for being

surely as on Mount Sceberras; and fall
disgraced ; or you will live still more
dishonorably, a second time deserters
from duty.”
These reproaches touched every one
of the offenders to the quick, reviving
in most a sense of honour and of shame.
But a few remained obstimately rebel-
lious; and in spite of all the indulgent
things said by two of the commissioners
to soothe them into obedience, they per-
sisted in averring that the Turks would
either entirely demolish the fort by the
aid of that prodigious work which they
had raised above the ravelin, and from
which they poured a continual storm of
fire; or they would blow it into the air

at once, by springing the mine which
they were rapidly running under the
first parapet.
This last argument was disproved by
the nature of the rock itself, which in-
creased so much in hardness as it ad-
vanced in depth, that only madmen could
doubt the certain failure of the Turkish
engineers on that subject. -
The other argument was not to be
treated lightly; and two of the commis-
sioners answered it rather by motives of
honour and duty to remain at all risks,
than united in the extravagant assertions
of their hot-headed associate Castriot,
that the fort was not merely tenable for
much longer, but capable of new and
formidable defences.
The pertinacity and overbearing lan-
guage of Castriot irritated even those
among the knights who were most sin-
cere in the intention of submitting to
whatever the Grand Master should com-
mand; and some very young brothers,

drawing their swords in the heat of pas-
sion, a disgraceful scene of contention
would have followed, had not Giovanni,
enquiring the cause of the violent uproar
as he reclined in the hospital-room,
started up, and with happy presence of
mind ordered an alarm to be sounded.
This feint succeeded : for at that
sound every knight ran to his post, ex-
pecting to see the infidels mounting the
walls. -
Till this moment Giovanni was igno-
rant of the rebellious remonstrance of
the malcontents: he got now, by a strong
effort, to the gate of the fort, where he
saw the commissioners hurrying out with
Dueguerras to engage in the repulse.
Arresting the veteran by his cloke, he
exclaimed, “Pardon my temerity, Father
I heard the humiliating contention, and
it was I who ordered that alarm to be
sounded.”
“Ever the best and wisest l” exclaimed
Dueguerras, interrupting him, and catch-

ing him in his arms; “ look at him, my
friends,” he continued: “wan and worn
as he is, had I but twenty such, I would
defend these crumbling walls against a
host.”
Giovanni bowed his face to hide the
honest exultation which flushed it at this
irrepressible encomium. “ Mine is a
partial governor,” he said, after a mo-
ment’s pause to steady his voice; “Che-
valiers, I but pray you to report me as
one determined never to quit this rock
but in obedience to the Grand Master.”
He did not wait for reply, but hurry-
ing from their commendations left them
to pursue their mow-unobstructed return
to Il Borgo.

CHAPTER II.
A shallop from St. Angelo, by day-
break the next morning, decided the con-
duct of the garrison: it came charged
with a letter from the Grand Master,
written in a strain of cold displeasure
less supportable than the sharpest re-
buke.
He accepted their resignation, bidding
them prepare to resign their places to
other soldiers: he added, that so far from
finding any difficulty in providing persons
to supersede them, his only anxiety WaS
how to choose best, from the number of
brave men who came in crowds from less
exposed fortresses, nay from the very
cultivation of the fields, to demand a post
in St. Elmo.

He told them that, at midnight, boats
would arrive with part of the new gar-
rison; and he therefore exhorted those
who evinced such a love of inglorious
life, to return in those boats without
delay.
“ They will come, my brethren º’ ex-
claimed Giovanni, who was present at
the reading of this piercing letter; “they
will defend St. Elmo ; and we shall call
in vain for the rocks to cover us!”
A general murmur of shame and re-
pentance ran through the assembly.
“Go who will,” cried the Governor,
striking his baton on the table, “no boat
shall carry this withered body across
yon water, but as a conqueror or a
COTSe -
By the same impulse the offending
knights threw themselves at the feet of
their intrepid Governor, imploring for-
giveness, and declaring their wish to
share his fate. “Obtain for us the Grand
Master's pardon,” they cried, “and we
122

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 25
will wash out our offences in the best
blood of our enemies.”
Dueguerras pressed them severally in
his arms, bedeving them with tears; and,
assuring them that their moment of re-
bellion was forgotten, hastened to repre-
sent their contrition to La Valette.
More than one messenger passed be-
tween the forts of St. Angelo and St.
Elmo, before the Grand Master allowed
himself to relax from his necessary se-
verity; and his forgiveness was obtained
at last, only by such repeated sub-
mission from the knights as convinced
him he might now depend upon their
firmness, - -
Each man, indeed, had made up his
mind to self-sacrifice for the general
good: and in this spirit, under the de-
vouring fire of the sun and of the enemy,
they persisted in erecting new works as
fast as the old ones were destroyed.
Giovanni, under skilful hands, was
soon able to take an active share in these

labours; and, whether combating sword
in hand in the trenches, or directing the
cannon from the batteries, or attending
the sick and wounded in the hospital, he
was equally the inspirer of noble am-
bition, and the object of emulation to
his associates.
No one, who saw him passing from post
to post, with a step as light as his coun-
tenance was animated, could have guessed
that under that show of cheerful con-
fidence there lay the settled conviction
of their destruction. He was too well
versed in the most scientific part of the
military profession, not to calculate to a
certainty the chances for and against
their power of maintaining the fort.
Without the seige were raised before a
given period, he knew it must fall: not
even supernatural courage could prevent
its being "destroyed under the inexhaust-
ible and unceasing fire of the enemy,
But what of that? The safety of the
Order, and of the whole island, depended

upon their keeping that enemy at bay as
long as possible ; and it was therefore
their duty to do so, though with the po-
sitive certainty of destruction to them-
selves.
They were now, he thought, literally
called upon “to lay down their lives for
the brethren,” not wantonly and vain-
gloriously, for the sake of worldly ap-
plause, but in obedience to the highest
commands of Him who sealed that com-
mand by his sacred example. ,
Thus Giovanni mounted, the walls of
St. Elmo as he would have gone to the
stake; believing himself called to "mar-
tyrdom for a great and glorious object,
and confidently anticipating the starry
crown promised “to them who endure
to the end.” sº ... : -
But one human affection clogged his
soul's heaven-ward flight: Cesario's
image still presented itself; and anxious
friendship fancied many a probable scene

of that friend's future life, torturing to
imagine. -
Giovanni yearned to behold that erring
but still dear Cesario again; and had not
the latter's absence in Sicily prevented
it, perhaps he might have urged La
Valette to appoint him a post in St.
Elmo. -
As it was, Giovanni thought of the
hazardous service in which Cesario was
placed, with extreme solicitude: for now
the cruisers of Dragut were scattered
about the seas between Sicily and Malta,
with the express purpose of intercepting
the convoy of stores expected by the
Grand Master under the guidance of
Cesario. -
Already had two gallies so laden, under
another commander, gone back to the
Sicilian port from which they had sailed,
even after they had nearly reached Malta:
their conduct, though justifiable in ordi-
nary situations, was so severely repro-
bated by La Valette, who never ceased

exhorting all within his influence to risk
every thing in a conjuncture like the pre-
sent, that Giovanni was convinced Ce-
sario would rather run direct into the
cannon's mouth, than turn back from his
COur See - -
Indifferent to his own life, Giovanni
could not be so to that of one so inter-
woven with his dearest remembrances;
and many and fervent were the prayers
he offered up for that cherished friend's
ultimate preservation. - -
Meanwhile the operations of the ene-
my proceeded with greater vigour than
ever: the shameful delay of the Italian
forces, which plunged the Maltese in
despair, inspirited the infidels; they be-
gan to blush at being kept so long before
an imperfect fort, which only a handful
of men defended. The Basha Mustapha
determined therefore to lay aside every
scheme for its slower reduction, and
assault it in good earnest with his whole
force. - -

Having previously devoted a day to
battering the walls, without a moment’s
intermission; and having succeeded in
laying a breach open to the very rock
itself; on the morning of the 16th of
July, the Turkish fleet suddenly appeared
before the sea-front of the fort; and,
while their artillery, and the land-battery
of Cape Dragut, thundered upon the
"southern and eastern end, the whole
Turkish army marched to the assault on
the north and west. - - - -
They advanced in the midst of a
hideous dissonance of appalling sounds,
which disgraced the name of martial
music, but which might have frozen
blood less warmed by generous ardour
than that of the besieged. -
It is the province of the historian to
give the details of this fierce contest: the
firm rank of knights was said to oppose a
second wall behind that now broken, to
the sabres of the infidels; and when that
living bulwark was gapped and broken

down in parts by the multitude of the
enemy, each individual knight and sol-
dier threw himself on the besiegers, sing-
ling out his opponent, and quitting him
not, till one or both fell dead.
Yet how ineffectual seemed every sin-
gle conquest, when such hosts were to
be subdued Sheltered by the fire of
all their batteries, the Turkish arque-
busiers rushed in crowds into the
trenches, and there sent their winged
deaths amongst Christians.
So sure was their aim, that they were
exulting with shouts of victory, when
suddenly aband of knights appeared, with
each a new and dreadful instrument of
destruction in his hand; advancing with
terrible rapidity, they threw them amid
the enemy, and as quickly ran back to
hurl down those who had already mounted
the wall.

bustible hoops dipped in blazing oils,

filled the trenches with a horrid light,
while the shrieks and groans of the
miserable wretches expiring of the tor-
ments they caused, disputed the superi-
ority of horror between sight and sound.
The flames of these dreadful fire-wheels
and the flashes of so many pieces of ord-
nance, covered the whole rock of St.
Elmo with fire; while, on the opposite
side of the great port, the batteries of
St. Angelo and the Isle de la Sangle,
thundering across the harbour upon the
enemy’s lines, showed, by their mo-
mentary illuminations, the anxious gar-
risons of each, watching the fate of
St. Elmo.
This fierce assault began in the dark-
ness of night, and continued till noon;
when the intense heat, the fatigue of
both parties, and above all the flagging
spirits of the infidels, combined to ter-
minate it.
Above two thousand of the latter
strewed the ground; and the Basha,

finding that no authority could, that day,
force his men to a second encounter
with the fire-wheels, ordered a retreat to
be sounded. - -
At that sound, the triumphant shout
of the besieged was re-echoed by one
from St. Angelo and St. Michael ; and
La Valette himself was seen by the
side of the grand standard, with his arms
extended towards St. Elmo, as if by that
action he wished to tell them that they
were again restored to his affections.
. . At this affecting sight, a second shout,
but less tumultuous and more thrilling
than the first, rent the air: an impres-
sive pause succeeded; after which the
surviving warriors hastened to fulfil their
sad duty to the wounded and dead.
Sad indeed was the task for there lay
kinsmen, and friends, and fellow-soldiers,
never to rise again
They who lifted their mangled corses,
and committed them to the ground,
might have wept over such dismal havoc,

had not the belief of being soon called
to follow them given a solemn check to
lamentation. - * -
They looked with tearless eyes upon
each well-known face, as it disappeared
under the mould they were heaping over
it; but many a deep-drawn sigh testified
but too truly, how far from hard indif.
ference were the brave hearts from which
those sighs were drawn.
- The boats which conveyed the wounded
to St. Angelo returned with a reinforce-
ment of volunteers, gallantly devoting
themselves to death, in emulation of
those who were now deaf to the voice of
human applause. -
... Such a remnant of the garrison re-
mained, that but for this voluntary band
La Valette knew the fort could not have
held out a day longer. Still indulging,
however, some faint hope of the Sicilian
succours, or at least of being able to de-
fend the island till the stormy season,
when the breath of heaven would blow

the enemy from their shores, he durst
not yield to the cry of his tenderer feel-
ings, which urged him to save these
gallant men from their impending fate.
A severe duty called on him to van-
quish himself; and while in secret he
wept and sorrowed over these successive
victims, in public he wore a face of
ardour and encouragement and con-
fidence. - - -
Enraged at the successful landing of
this reinforcement, in defiance of all his
efforts to prevent it, the Basha's fury ex-
ceeded all bounds: he called a council
of war, where it was determined, that
new works should be immediately con-
structed, so as to hem in the fort of St.
Elmo on every side, and make it impos-
sible for La Valette to succour it either
with men or provisions from the town;
while by sea all assistance should be cut
off by the gallies stationed before the en-
trance of the port. -

* This plan, in despite of the most in-
trepid sallies of the besieged, was quickly
executed. A formidable sweep of bat-
teries extending down to the very edge
of the great portion one side, and of the
lesser port on the other, shut in the de-
voted fort, and shut out hope.
. This work completed, the infidels
rushed again to the walls, which now
presented not one breach, but many, O
breaches nobly stopped; with mortal
bodies it is true, but invincible souls'
- Thrice came the infidels on, and as
often were they driven back: the blood
ran off those floated ramparts like the
sheeted rain of thunder-storms. The
dying curses of infidels mingled with
the dying prayers of Christians; and the
last pressure of kindred lips upon the
clammy ones of expiring warriors, was
seen, but not heard, amid that dismal
uproar.
Again, the disgraced Ottomans were
beaten beyond the trenches; which,

however, were left unmaintained by the
besieged, for want of soldiers.
... The Turks now drew back upon their
camp to breathe for the night; leaving
the afflicted garrison to collect their
wounded, and count their few surviving
numbers.
Alas, there was scarcely one who
could be called more than the remnant
of himself! Those who were not de-
prived of some limb, were disfigured by
hideous wounds, and scarcely able to
drag their suffering bodies through the
laborious offices of the night.
The aged Dueguerras dug with his
own hand the grave of more than one of
his brave garrison; while Giovanni,
whom some good angel had miraculously
protected through the storm of the as-
sault, and the dangers which he courted,
dressed the wounds of those that yet
lived, and soothed each parting spirit
with the consolations of religion.

Rodolphe was amongst the survivors;
and though Giovanni saw the dark goal
to which all their glory tended, he felt a
thrill of pleasure at hearing his poor fol-
lower’s praise. -
Rodolphe had saved the lesser standard
of the Order on the cavalier; and
thrown himself with such intrepidity,
singly, amongst whole bodies of the
enemy, that Dueguerras did not hesitate
to assure him, that if they lived to meet
the Grand Master, he should claim for
him the honourable title of a serving
brother, — a distinction, from which, ae-
cording to the strict rules of the Order,
the meanness of his birth must otherwise
have excluded him.
Rodolphe's feelings were overpowered
by this unexpected good fortune; for,
as his mind opened, he became more
sensitive to the opinion of others; and
now, transported with joy, he embraced
the knees of the Governor and of Gio-
vanni, unable to articulate his thanks.

Rather exhausted by fatigue, than by
the pain of his many but unimportant
flesh-wounds, the poor fellow was at last
persuaded to retire and seek a short re-
freshment: his example was followed by
all the inferior soldiers, leaving the few
surviving knights to consult with their
Governor.
His council-hall was the dismal scene
of their last contest: a faint gleam of yet
lingering day glimmered over their de-
jected figures, as each stood leaning on
his pike, with grief and perplexity in his
looks.
Nearly all of them had their heads, or
limbs, or bodies swathed in recent band-
ages; the white linen of which woefully
matched their pale faces: and as they
leant their unsteady figures with all their
weight upon weapons now too feeble to
support them, they seemed the slowly-
sinking spectres of those knights whose
yet unburied bodies lay scattered round.

“They are fast lopping our few
withering branches!” said Dueguerras,
after a long and dismal silence, while he
held out the stump of that arm with
which he had vainly grasped the standard
Rodolphe afterwards recovered. “They
will have laid the axe to the root, ere the
next set of the sun that has just sunk
to his bed of rest! How many of us
remain P One—two—three I’ll count
no more!” exclaimed the old man, inter-
rupting himself with a burst of anguish,
his eye rapidly outrunning his calcu-
lation. He turned away to conceal his
gushing tears. -
Giovanni followed him. “ Father!”
he cried with great emotion, pressing
the shaking arm of Dueguerras, “time
presses; we cannot defend this fort a
single instant, if the enemy attack it
again before we are reinforced ; it is not
a question of our lives—they go with
the next hour; but the fort must be
preserved.”


## p. 41 (#51) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 41
“Good heaven!—preserved P’ repeated
Dueguerras, raising his afflicted counte-
mance, “ look there—there !” and he
pointed to the triple lines of Turkish
batteries, commanding every part of the
two shores. “How are reinforcements
to land under those batteries? and how
are we to get a single boat across the
port to tell our wretched tale to La
Valette 2" * -
“I’ll swim it!” cried Giovanni, in a
voice which made every heart thrill.
It was some minutes ere he could
make Dueguerras comprehend the prac-
ticability of this bold measure; the
success of which must rest chiefly upon
his extraordinary bodily strength. The
risk was imminent; but the necessity
was yet more urgent; and all impatient
of delay, Giovanni received the few in-
structions from his Governor, and break-
ing away, flew along a path shaded by
mounds of earth, down to the beach.

One clear gleam was in the sky, as he
sprang naked into the water, dividing
with vigorous strokes its turbulent waves.
The agitated friends he had left stand-
ing on the rampart of St. Elmo watched
his fateful progress by that gradually-
extinguishing gleam, and with hearts
so anxious that minutes comprised the
tortures of hours. - -
His white and polished limbs in the
midst of that black mass of water was
too striking an object to be unmarked
by the enemy. One of their sentinels,
mistaking the glittering appearance for
a sea-fowl, wantonly discharged his piece
in that direction. At that moment, the
same impulse checked by the same
action the sudden cry of all upon the
rampart. Giovanni, with admirable pre-
sence of mind, dived for an instant or
two below the surface of the water;
and when he rose again, the closing
clouds had just shut in the only gleam

of light, and the sentinel was turned
another way.
Giovanni then exerted all his strength;
and, vigorously breasting the waves,
gained the shore.

"CHAPTER III.
WHILE the garrison of St. Elmo were
thus contending with super-human cou-
rage against a growing host, Cesario was
on the sea, joyfully conducting, as he
believed, certain succour to Malta.
This consisted of two gallies filled
with gentlemen, and knights from their
distant commanderies; and two trans-
ports bearing Spanish troops. This
meagre reinforcement was to be consi-
dered a pledge for the whole Sicilian
fleet, which should arrive as soon as
the various regiments and supplies could
be got on board the different vessels.
But, unhappily for Cesario's hopes,
the command of these few auxiliaries
was given to Don Juan Cardona, with,


## p. 45 (#55) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 45
private instructions not to land the
soldiers nor risk the shipping, if he
should receive any news by the way
of an unfavourable nature. , -
The critical state of St. Elmo being
hastily given to him with all the exag-
gerations of vulgar fear by a fisherman,
Cardona, in obedience to the positive
commands of his court, instead of making
for the island, stood out to sea, irresolute
whether to return to Messina, or hover
about the channel, -
In vain Cesario remonstrated against
this conduct; Cardona assured him, that
his instructions were peremptory for
avoiding an action with the Turkish
fleet; and in addition to that, he confessed
a private reason, the force of which, he
flattered himself, no man could deny.
The wife of Felix di Toledo was on board
his ship. Cardona was her uncle; and,
overcome by her importunities, he had
consented to secrete her and her maid
in his cabin, and convey them to Malta.
*


## p. 46 (#56) ##############################################

46 THE KNIGHT OF ST. John.
He was however of too weak a character
for consistency in kindness; and, afraid
of being reproached for running his ships
into danger, only to gratify his private
affections, he now burst out into péttish
exclamations, devoutly giving all women,
and wives especially, to the devil.
Cesario was sensibly affected by this
proof of Donna Camilla's conjugal tender-
ness; for though he could not justify
her taking such a hazardous step without
her husband's permission, he understood
how easily a fond heart might be bewil-
dered between real and imagined duties;
and how much a passionate desire of
sharing the dangers, and watching over
the probable ills of a beloved object,
might blind her sense to that increase of
his perils and anxieties which must follow
her arrival.
The siege also had been drawn out so
long beyond the period expected for its
conclusion, that he was not quite sure
Toledo would sincerely wish his wife

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 47
had been less adventurous: he therefore
wished for both their sakes that she
could be landed; and he urged every
argument in his power to induce Cardona
to disregard the false or exaggerated
statement of the fisherman.
His heart was all in tumults lest he
should arrive too late to share Giovanni’s
bed of honourable death, (for, alas ! he
dare no longer encourage the hope of
seeing St. Elmo relieved); and his ten-
perest sympathies were excited for the
interesting young creature who was so
devotedly throwing herself, for a hus-
band's sake, into the midst of perils hid-
eous but to imagine. - -
Cesario’s acquaintance with Toledo
had been short, it is true; but frequent
opportunity of observation stands in the
place of months and years; and he had
fortunately seen the noble Spaniard in
situations where the inmost character"
must rise to light.
From every trial he had seen Toledo's

sterling heart come out like tried and .
pure gold. During their harassing march
along the coast, his manly neglect of
every personal comfort, and his delicate
attention to that of others, rivetted Ce-
sario's regard: he saw him, after the most
fatiguing and dispiriting service, go forth
amongst the men, to inspect their ac-
commodations and attend to their com-
plaints. Nay, the very brute creation had
a friend in Toledo; and many was the
wounded war-horse, which his humane
and skilful hand cherished into health
again,
These may seem trifling acts of hu-
manity; yet, perhaps, it is from such
minor acts that we can best judge of the
soul's spontaneous movements, and are
most powerfully attracted to love the
person who displays them.
In the field, and at the military council,
• Toledo evinced qualities of a cast de-
manding respect as well as affection. On
these occasions the greatest valour

coupled with discretion and the soundest
judgment, unwarped even by a romantic
passion for glory worthy the first days of
chivalry, distinguished him from every
other warrior. -
Thus, in a moment, he passed from
the amiable to the admirable; from the
careless, unpretending, amusing com-
panion, to the firm and enlightened coun-
sellor. -
In both characters Cesario admired
him; and scarcely knew whether he
liked him best, when, lightening the hours
of their stated watch, he recited or
chanted a Provençal romance, or, when
severely thoughtful, he delivered opinions
as valuable in themselves as important
to the cause he investigated.
This esteem for Toledo's character
was heightened by the interesting nature
of his private situation; and convinced
that no event could bestow more hap-
piness upon him than that of his wife's

voluntary arrival, Cesario longed to lead
her to him through every obstacle. ,
As Cesario had left an agent of the
Grand Master's at Messina, to employ
the money and equip the recruits he had
succeeded in raising, he felt authorised
to make his own immediate way to Il
Borgo: he therefore proposed the enter-
prise to the knights and gentlemen on
board, who were all eager to adventure
every thing for the attainment of the
general wish. -
Cardona could not refuse the boat they
demanded for this purpose; but, sincerely
apprehensive of their destruction, he en-
deavoured to dissuade them from so
daring an attempt. He expostulated in
vain: in vain he magnified the dangers
they were about to brave, for no other
object than that of losing their lives fruit-
lessly the next hour, on the walls of the
fated fortress. He spoke to resolute men
whom nothing could change; and he
was to be conquered. - -

Cesario meanwhile conveyed a billet
to Donna Camilla, briefly telling her of
their intended desperate method of at-
tempting a landing; and offering her his
protection in case she had courage to
encounter the alarm of such an effort,
and to trust to his experience and reso-
lution.
Their boat was just launched, and Ce-
sario already in it, when Camilla and her
attendant appeared. She had broken
from her timid uncle’s mingled argu-
ments and threatenings, with the sudden
strength of wildly-exalted feelings, and
now sprang into the boat, under the dark-
ness of a thick fog, with as much eager-
ness as if she were springing through the
gates of heaven. -
A veil entirely concealed her face and
figure, as she sat silent, trembling with a
little fear, but more anxiety, near Cesario,
who guided the rudder.
He was now so familiar with the creeks
and rocks of the island, that, so far from

dreading the increasing fog, he blessed
it as their shield and security; and, hap-
pily screened by it from the observation
of the enemy, and favoured by the tide,
he drifted silently through their very fleet
into the great port.
No sooner were they landed, than
taking Donna Camilla and her faithful
attendant under his own care, he pro-
ceeded to Toledo's quarters, having pre-
viously dispatched one of the chevaliers
to apprise him of their arrival.
Donna Camilla's impatience made her
nearly outstrip his messenger; for when
they came in sight of her husband's re-
sidence, and no sooner was it pointed out
to her by Cesario, than, breaking from
his supporting arm, she flew like a lap-
wing into the court of the building. He
followed quickly, and got up to her in
time to see her throw herself upon her
husband’s neck in the porch of the
Youilding.
But though the strong light of a lamp

suspended above, shone full upon her
figure, and though her veil was fallen off,
he only caught a glimpse of a youthful
face, all tears and transport; and saw a
figure, light as air, in defiance of a cir-
cumstance which rendered it more in-
teresting in the eye of a husband.
It was long ere Don Felix was suf.
ficiently master of his joyfully-amazed
senses to move from the position in which
her first action had placed him. He held
her locked in his arms, scarcely breath-
ing; his lips fondly sealed upon the back
of her white neck, as she lay with her
face buried on his shoulder.
When he found that she made no an-
swer to his whispered blessings, he raised
her gently; and, finding that she had
fainted, called Cesario to assist him in
bearing her into his apartment.
Cesario did so ; and having waited to
see some signs of returning life, he left
them to themselves.
. The first person Cesario met after this,

answered his eager question of, whether
St. Elmo still held out, by telling him its
desperate situation.
Giovanni, after breathing awhile, when
his gloomy errand was told, had swam
back to inform the garrison that numbers
had volunteered for their reinforcement;
and that boats were then preparing to
attempt their passage across the port.
“O, had I been but one hour sooner!”
exclaimed Cesario, with a pang of disap-
pointment; and, rushing down to the
shore by the light of a few cautiously
shaded torches, he saw those heroic men
who were about to court death in every
shape, tumultuously getting into the
boats.
“Where is the Grand Master P” he
cried, throwing himself into one of the
smallest shallops; “but this is no time
to wait for leave—Off—off—push off!”
His own hand performed the office he
demanded; and, pushing before the little
fleet, he led the way from eagerness, not

ambition; not even the ambition of
glory animated him; his whole soul was
fixed on friendship and Giovanni. -
The night was still dark; but there
was light enough along the lines of the
enemy, to show their dreadful prepara-
tion. The whole shore, indeed, was lined
with artillery, and the mouth of the port
blocked tip by triple rows of gallies.
In advance of these were posted a lighter
squadron filled with musqueteers and
archers; so that from the seaside, the
slender shallops of the knights were ex-
posed to the operations of the Turkish
navy. As long as the forts of St. Angelo
and St. Elmo remained in the hands of
the Order, and maintained the chain
which crossed the entrance of the har-
bour, the vessels of the infidels could
not pass to take absolute possession of
the port; but the fire of their guns could
not be excluded; and they raked the
little forlorn hope of gallant spirits in

every direction, while in front it re-
ceived the whole thunder of the enemy's
camp and land batteries.
Yet undismayed, the chevaliers per-
sisted in attempting to weather that
storm of death. Animated by the sight
of their brave companions on the rampart
of St. Elmo, who were seen clad in their
white and scarlet subrevests, standing in
the midst of those sulphureous clouds
which rose in volumes from the shore
to the very pinnacle of the rock; ani-
mated by their appearance and their
encouraging gestures, this adventurous
band made the most desperate efforts to
join them. Some rashly ran their boat
a-ground under the very guns of the
enemy, hoping to cut their way through
their lines; others threw themselves into
the sea, endeavouring to gain the foot
of the rock by swimming; others again,
with frantic cries and gestures, seemed
questioning the decrees of heaven; while
a few humbly knelt in their shallops,

as if to supplicate Divine assistance for
their devoted brethren. -3
Cesario was the first that leaped into
the sea: he thought he saw Giovanni,
and he did see him, directing the fire
of some guns upon the enemy, near the
only spot where a landing was practicable.
At that imagination, he sprang into
the waves, crying out, “I come, Gio-
vanni ’’
Giovanni's blood thrilled to that
piercing sound—that sound so long un-
heard—that sound at once welcome, and
the only one that could make him feel
the pang of fear : he ran to the beach,
followed by Rodolphe ; but Cesario was
not fated to reach him. A well-aimed
and heavy stone struck him on the
shoulder, and his right arm, with which
he was stemming the waves, fell power-
less under water. His immediately
sinking showed that he was deprived
of sense; but at that moment Henri
La Valette, who had observed him,

dragged him into his boat, and rowed
away.
tº All this was the work of an instant;
and Giovanni had rushed half into the
sea, when, seeing Cesario safe, and recol-
lecting his own duty, he drew back,
exclaiming in agonized accents, “Is there
no man who will swim to yonder boat,
and tell Cesario Adimari that my heart
is bursting to reach him ''' - -
... “I will!” cried Rodolphe, starting
forward. Giovanni caught the faithful
Cahet as he flew,-‘ Bear him this last
embrace" he cried, and giving him one
convulsive pressure, as if it were indeed
Cesario that he held, he turned with the
feelings of a man who has made his last
sacrifice, to regain his station on the
walls. . . . .
From that awful station he beheld
the fearful scene of the unfortunate
boats: but two were now visible of all
that had dared the passage; and they
were hastily steering back to the opposite

shore, through showers of balls which
threatened every moment to send them
after their wretched companions.
Giovanni strained his eyes to watch
the fearful progress of the little barks:
but dark themselves, they were soon be-
yond the reach of distant lights; and
Giovanni could but guess at their safety,
when he heard two faint shouts, repeated
after short intervals, from the quarter of
the town. *
Hoping all things, as we are instructed
to do, he then turned with a thankful
though trembling heart to his other
duties.
In the spirit of those immortal heroes
who laid down their lives at Thermo-
pylae a willing sacrifice, the self-devoted
garrison prepared for certain death: dis-
tinctions were all laid aside : each soldier
could boast as scarred a breast, and as
brave a heart within it, as that of the
noblest knight who commanded him;

mon of the last solemn rite of Christians,
they all embraced, for the last time, in
this world. After this, they betook them-
selves to their post. Even the wounded
and the sick prayed to find death, not by
lingering pain or murderous blows in
their beds, but where they had so often
sought it, in front of the enemy: they
were therefore placed in the ranks with
their less disabled associates.
Thus passed that dismal night.
When day dawned, the infidels came
on to the assault with the fury and the
yells of demons. What was to withstand
them? Not a ruined fortress, beaten
almost to the ground !—not a handful of
bleeding and dismembered men, whose
brave souls were already flitting away!
Yet did these unconquerable men con-
tinue to fill up the breach with their
bodies, till one by one they fell under
the ruthless battle-axes of the enemy.
“ This terrible assault,” says the his-
torian, “ was discontinued only for want

of combatants, it not ending, but with
the death of the last knight. The
Turkish fleet then entered the great port
in triumph, their cannon firing, their
trumpets sounding, and all the infidels
shouting for joy.”

CHAPTER IV.
Happily for Cesario, he remained in a
state of stupor almost amounting to in-
sensibility, till long after the fall of St.
Elmo. On recovering perfect conscious-
ness, the first object his eyes encountered
was Rodolphe.
The presence of the Cahet excited an
instant hope of his master, and with wild
transport Cesario pronounced Giovanni's
11ame. .
At that name Rodolphe threw himself
upon the ground, answering only by a
groan.
Cesario was iced to his inmost soul;
but suddenly starting up, he called out,
“Tell me the worst!”
One near them, who knew not the un-

happy young man’s individual interest
in St. Elmo, immediately related the
fate of the fort, and the slaughter of
its garrison.
He added to this tale, the frightful
fact—O shame to humanity! — of the
Basha's impotent revenge.
That ferocious monster had ordered
the bodies of such as were found with
remaining life, to be ripped open, and
their hearts torn out. Upon those already
dead, in horrid mockery of their sacred
badge, he commanded gashes to be cut
in the form of a cross; then tying those
insulted remnants of so many heroes to
planks of wood, he cast them into the
sea, leaving them to be washed by the
tide to the very foot of St. Angelo. . .
At this dreadful recital, Cesario fell
back a second time, insensible to every
thing. The cries of Rodolphe at last
roused him : he opened his eyes once
more, and slowly recollecting the horrors
to which he had before listened, he fixed

a withering look upon Rodolphe, asking
him in a stern voice, what brought him
there. -
Rodolphe hastened to account for this
apparent desertion of the master for
whom he would willingly have died a
thousand deaths.
The violence of his grief would scarcely
allow him to articulate; but at length
he faltered through a short recital of
their last interview at the foot of Mount
Sceberras.
“O give me that sad, that dear em-
brace l’’ cried Cesario, dissolving into
tears, and trying once more to rise and
receive it. The Cahet threw himself
upon his breast with that familiarity
which companionship in the same grief
renders sacred. -
Cesario pressed him against his heart,
with the only arm he could now use, and
so strongly, that it seemed as if he would
have had him grow there.
It was long, long ere either of them
7


## p. 65 (#75) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 65
could speak: when they did so, Cesario
said with a rending sigh, “We must
never part again, Rodolphe ; you are
my Giovanni's legacy; and we will lay
down our desolated lives together.”
Rodolphe had no voice to answer.
In sorrow he was still the undisciplined
child of nature: and though he had
learned many noble lessons from the
example of his master, he had not yet
learned to bow his whole soul in submis-
sion to the seemingly-hard decrees of
Providence.
While he wept and beat his breast, in
stormy agony, Cesario lay motionless on
his pallet, his hands clapsed over his
body, and his eyes fixed on heaven, in
silent communion with the beatified spirit
of his friend. -
To him, even this moment of anguish
had its balm: for in it, he had been told,
not only of Giovanni's forgiveness, but
of his unabated affection. What, then,
was to make Giovanni's removal from

this earthly tabernacle a grief to his sur-
viving friend ? Let but Cesario hasten
to lose his life, as he had done whom he
lamented, and their souls would meet,
and spring into each other, in regions of
everlasting joy -
This exaltation of feeling was inter-
rupted by sounds from without, to
which no name may be given: they were
nor groans nor cries, but they smote the
heart through the ear, and spoke of woe
and horror. - -
Cesario quickly comprehended their
import: his eyes sought those of Ro-
dolphe, where the ghastly expression of
his, was reflected. He started from his
couch, and tried to reach the door; but,
enfeebled by foregone exertion, and the
anguish of his contusion, he dropt upon
the threshold. Rodolphe passed with-
out seeing him.
Winged with a dreadful hope, the
Cahet flew down to the beach; there he
saw a crowd of mournful faces. Towns-

men and warriors stood mute and motion-
less, watching the sullen motion of the
tide, as it heaved-in the several corses of
their martyred companions.
An individual or general murmur of
grief followed the nearer view of each
floating body. Some were the remains
of unknown volunteers; some, of the in-
trepid peasantry; some, of the oldest
and dearest of their brethren. Women
and children were seen kneeling upon the
shore, fixed in stupid gaze over the
mangled corses of brothers, husbands,
and sons. - *-
La Valette was not present: he durst
not trust himself with a sight which must
have unmanned him. He withdrew from
every eye, to commune singly with that
God, whose awful decrees he might not
question, but whose graciousness not
only permits, but invites us to implore
the removal of his judgments when they
weigh upon us beyond our strength.
. Rodolphe's phrenzied eyes now ran

over the whole surface of the port, in
search of those precious relics, which it
would be joy to rescue from indignity,
and see committed with holy rites to the
earth.
Alas, what is our joy? what is our
grief? and how limited is our capacity
of either, when we can thus admit an
emotion of delight from the very circum-
stance which makes our losses more ma-
nifest! Alas, what is our grief, when
time, yes time only, can wear away the
acuteness of a sorrow as justly due to the
memory of its object after years have
passed by, as when it was first ravished

with that of Giovanni. Hope might
have kindled at this, had not several of
these corses been so mangled in the
assault, and so wantonly mutilated since,
that all traces of humanity were effaced
from them. From the sight of these,
Rodolphe turned at first, with a convul-
sive shudder; then returned to assist in
drawing them from the water, lest he
should unconsciously leave his master’s
body unhonoured. -
“Whose remains do you seek 2" asked
a knight, who had been long standing
pale and dejected near him, fixed in
dismal contemplation.
“My master’s — the Chevalier Ciga-
la,” returned the Cahet, scarcely able
to utter that name. -
“I too have sought it,” replied his
questioner, who was no other than Felix
di Toledo, “but in vain.” -
He sighed heavily as he spoke; and,
plunging again into his own dark
thoughts, took the road to the town.


## p. 70 (#80) ##############################################

70 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
Not very long after, he entered the in-
firmary where Cesario lay in the midst of
wounded associates; and, advancing to
his pallet, with Donna Camilla in his
hand, he said with a faint smile, “I
bring you a nurse, Adimari: she will me.
dicine both your mind and body, for she
will mourn with you. I have other work
to do.”
The glance of his kindled eye, and the
nobly stern expression which at once
banished the habitual sweetness of his
countenance, were not to be mistaken:
they were indicative of his determination
to rush into the most desperate scenes,
to satisfy his irritated honour, and ap-
pease the manes of all those whom his
father’s political obedience had delivered
up to destruction.
The feeble smile which accompanied
his first address, was the last Cesario saw
upon Toledo's lips through many a fate-
ful day after the present; for his heart
was stricken ; and not even Camilla could

THE KNIGHT of St. John. 71
charm him into the oblivion of what he
believed a family-disgrace.
That amiable young creature now ap-
proached Cesario, and, mixing her assur-
ance of skill in contusions, with her
concern that he should require its exer-
cise, she insinuated by degrees some
hope that Giovanni might yet live.
Rodolphe joined them: his haggard
visage told the tale which his lips refused
to utter. Cesario saw enough in that
dreadful look to convince him that none
but Camilla entertained the hope he
wished to catch at. A deep sigh from
Toledo, and a tremulous motion of Ro-
dolphe's head, answered him when he
gasped out an enquiry respecting the
remains of his friend.
“Surely that is ground for hope, not
for despairl” said the tender Camilla,
hastening to catch his sinking head, as
it fell back upon his pillow, in complete
abandonment to misery. “Oh I hope,
till you are convinced of what you fear !


## p. 72 (#82) ##############################################

72 THE KNIGHT OF ST. John.
Assuredly Heaven would never abandon
such a matchless person, as I am told
your friend was, to such ruthless ene-
mies.”
The persuasive tones of her voice had
magic in them, for Rodolphe precipitated
himself at her feet, where, fastening his
lips upon her robe, he lay, inarticulately
repeating some broken sentences of gra-
titude and blest credulity of the hope she
painted.
Cesario, meanwhile, more respectfully
bowed his head upon her supporting
hand, in silent, hopeless thankfulness. He
knew Giovanni's principles, and he felt
convinced that his soul must have quitted
its frail tenement, the first or the last
in the breach of St. Ehmo.
Toledo cast an approving glance upon
his lovely wife, and pressing the hand
of Cesario, commended him to her care,
while he hurried to attend the council
just summoned.
This solemn assembly was preceded


## p. 73 (#83) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JoHN. 73
by the more solemn interment of those
brave remains which had been rescued
from the waters.
The long array of biers was followed
by a train of knights in mourning habits,
with black tapers in their hands; their
pale countenances, at once expressive of
sorrow and of resolution to imitate those
they mourned. . . * .
The suffering inhabitants of Il Borgo
thinly lined the streets through which
they passed; silently regarding that vast
funeral, and listening with suspended
breaths to the heavy tread of so many
feet, and the deep toll of a single bell.
The bodies were laid in the ground
with all the honours of war; and all the
ceremonies of religion by the bishop of
Malta; but their funeral oration was
delivered by La Valette himself.
When the stated service was over, he
rose up in the midst of the crowd, and,
mastering that transport of grief and
indignation which nearly hurried him

out of himself, he pronounced the pane-
gyric of the slain. Then looking round
upon the assembly, his eyes sparkling
with generous fire, he called on them
not to lament, but to emulate those who
had fallen so gloriously.
He protested that, for his part, he
rather envied than pitied the meanest
soldier who had fallen on the walls of
St. Elmo; for his measure of glory was
filled up; he had departed in the bright-
ness of his fame : while those who re-
mained had yet to war against the infir-
mities of human nature; to watch and
pray, lest they should fall away from
their former selves.
He bade his hearers remember that
the garrison of St. Elmo had not been
conquered by the superior valour or skill
of the besiegers, but by their numbers:
and that now, that superiority was fast
diminishing. The infidels had lost above
three thousand men in that single siege;
Dragut too, the formidable Dragut, had

just expired in consequence of a wound
received in the trenches; a mortal and
contagious distemper was in their camp;
and their provisions were nearly ex-
hausted.
Thus, if each garrison resolved to
emulate the noble example of St. Elmo,
and perish rather than capitulate, Malta
must finally conquer; for the stormy
season would arrive long before the re-
duction of a second fort so defended;
and the infidels, no longer able to receive
any but precarious supplies by sea, must
at last consume away from disease and
famine. -
La Valette no longer found it neces-
sary to animate the courage of his people
by the hope of foreign succours. A
higher state of feeling now prevailed
throughout Malta; even the commonest
peasant, catching the heroic contagion,
thought only of dying for the general
good. -
Every man, in short, was so assured
E 2

76 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
that their cause must finally triumph,
and that posterity would immortalise its
martyrs, that he cared less for living
to share, than dying to secure it.
La Valette's penetrating eye discerned
this universal exaltation; and glancing
for a moment with a softened heart on
the bent and varying countenance of
Felix di Toledo, he went on, forbearing
to mention those succours which were
once the main spring of his eloquence.
The appearance of a Greek slave
bearing a flag of truce from the Basha,
interrupted the answer from the knights.
The man’s errand was quickly told: he
came to summon the whole Order to sur-
render, offering them specious terms,
couched in insulting language. -
La Valette, who had seated himself on
his entrance, now started up. “Lead
him away!” he cried. He then returned
calmly to his duties; while Toledo,
seizing the astonished messenger, hurried
him from the hall.


## p. 77 (#87) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 77
He led him in silence through the
fortified lines of the town; but as he
paused with him on the counterscarp, he
pointed sternly to the deep ditch below.
“See there,” he said, “the only spot of
ground we can afford your master.”
Toledo released the arm he had grasp-
ed; and did so with so forceful an action,
that the slave staggered and fell. The
bitter smile on the brave Spaniard's face
was instantly displaced by sudden light;
he hailed the omen; and, waiting a mo-
ment to see the man joined by the guard
that was appointed to conduct him from
the lines, he turned back into the town.

CHAPTER V.
On the return of his messenger, with a
description of the bold conduct of the
knights, and the imposing appearance of
their defences, Mustapha saw that none
but the most vigorous measures could pre-
vent his suffering the disgrace and mor-
tification of final defeat. Aware of those
circumstances in his own situation, which
inspired La Valette with confidence, he
resolved to lose no time in rendering it
impossible even for the Sicilian fleet,
should it arrive after all, to relieve the
garrisons of St. Angelo and St. Michael.
In pursuance of this determination,
he proceeded to invest the Christians on
the land side, by removing his army from
Mount Sceberras to the heights behind
-


## p. 79 (#89) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT of St. John. 79
the Isle de la Sangle, and the peninsula
on which stood Il Borgo and St. An
gelo.
In doing this, he pursued the same
plan which had already been so suc-
cessful with St. Elmo, that of enclosing it
in a semicircle of batteries.
The command of Mount Sceberras
gave him the advantage of battering the
fortresses in front, while the possession
of the heights overlooking them, en-
abled him to plunge the fire of his artil-
lery direct into the towns.
Happily for the besieged, both in Il
Borgo and St. Michael, the effect of these
formidable preparations was in some de-
gree counterbalanced by the arrival of
the troops under Cardona. -
The generous spirit of his officers and
men was not to be controlled ; and hav-
ing by a mixture of violence and stra-
tagem induced him to sailback to Malta,
and put them on shore, they had suc-

ceeded in making their way under cover
of night to the town. .
With this unexpected reinforcement,
the Grand Masterproceeded to strengthen
his garrisons, and prepare for the threat-
ened storm. - - - - -
While the Christians and infidels were
thus employed, the sick and wounded
amongst the former were slowly re-
covering. . . * : -
The Maltese women and the Nuns
Hospitallers devoted themselves to the
care of those brave men who had bled
for their preservation. Their watchful
tenderness was more serviceable than the
skill of the surgeons; and perhaps their
pious consolations, when mixed with the
sweet sounds of gratitude, went more
surely to the hearts of those they suc-
coured, than all the ceremonies of their
common faith. -
Donna Camilla was distinguished even
here. Perhaps her frame was less strong
than others, her nerves less firm, her

countenance less manageable; but she
atoned for these defects of constitution
by that extreme sensibility to the suf.
ferings she witnessed, which inspires the
possessor of it with a variety of expe-
dients for mitigating pain and infusing
fortitude. - . .
Kind and succouring to all, she was
especially so to Cesario. His character
interested her, his situation called for
her liveliest sympathy; and his evident
appreciation of her husband's excellence
warmed her regard for him into sister-
like affection.
She had persuaded him to remove
from the hospital to her husband’s quar-
ters in Il Borgo; and it was there, that
she and Toledo endeavoured to medicine
his sick soul with all that woman’s soft-
ness and man’s firmness can render
grateful or useful. * -
But what was that medicine? what
discourse could they find to interest the

bereaved Cesario? what object could
they offer him in the desolate future!
Nothing, indeed, in this world. When
Camilla found him inaccessible to the
amiably wild hope she at first attempted
to infuse, she ceased to urge it; and
dwelt only on the character and fame of
him they mourned.
Again and again she drew him into
details of Giovanni's military actions;
and, as she commented on the hero's ar-
dent desire for the preservation of the
“Order, she insensibly inflamed Cesario's
zeal for the same great object. Thus
she taught him to seek consolation for
a friend’s loss, in sympathy with that
friend’s strongest desire; and thus, by
kindling another strong and laudable pas-
sion in Cesario’s soul, she gave him a mo-
tive to endure what else had crushed him
unresistingly: then placing his goal in
that heaven to which Giovanni was gone,
she prepared him to seek it by a race
of glory on earth.
I5


## p. 83 (#93) ##############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 88
With Camilla, therefore, Cesario talked
of his friend’s finer shades of character,
and to her related all the vicissitudes of
their friendship; with Toledo he expa-
tiated on those sublime features of mag-
nanimity and self-denial which a soldier
only can properly estimate; with Ro-
dolphe he conversed upon those minutiae
of Giovanni's domestic hours, which per-
petually delight and surprise, or afflict
and mortify those who scrutinise thus
closely the private life of one removed
by death.
Every day Rodolphe had something
hitherto untold to relate; some action or
some word unimportant to all others, but
most precious to Cesario; something
which exalted Giovanni still higher in his
friend's esteem, and rivetted his heart by
some additional testimony of Giovanni's
all-forgiving affection.
These, added to the never-wearying re-
cital of Giovanni's last message, were the
secret treasures of Cesario; to them he

retired from the society of Toledo and
Camilla, when his over-tasked heart could
no longer bear the sight of their mutual
happiness. : - -
Let it not be imagined that Cesario
turned from such happiness, because
every thing like it was denied to him.
Far different was his reason! He trembled
at the exquisiteness of their felicity; and
he looked with dismal forebodings to that
bloody cloud which was gathering over
, them all. >
Sometimes as they sat together, during
the short period of rest from military du-
ties, he would look at the interesting
figure of Donna Camilla, and as he con-
templated its extreme delicacy, and the
sensitive variation of her countenance,
he would say to himself, “Alas, what will
become of her, if Toledo ” he never
finished the sentence.
Never had Cesario seen or imagined
a female heart so devoted; and the sight
was equally novel as lovely to him.

In the midst of personal danger, and
with the prospect of greater trials, Ca-
milla seemed to think, that where her
husband was, there was safety, there was
joy | -
The countenance which was dim, and
pale, and abstracted, when he was not
present, lighted up into immediate beauty
the instant he appeared : through the
crystal clearness of a complexion, which
only her vivid sensibility coloured, her
whole soul was visible; and her husband,
“ Seen, heard, and felt, possessing every pulse,”
became from that instant the only objects
her eyes voluntarily rested on.
The manly tenderness of Toledo was
not so irrepressibly elastic : he could
listem in her presence, with a calm air, to
the indifferent conversation of another,
and give the most earnest attention of
mind and eyes to a discourse upon the
great interests of society; but whenever
he turned those eyes upon his wife, an

eloquent look promised a recompense for
himself and her in their hours of unre-
strained, unwitnessed confidence. That
deeply fond look said as much perhaps,
as all the illuminations of Camilla's kin-
dling countenance.
In short, the heart of each, was
equally true, tender, and happy; but even
the heart has a different sex; and Ca-
milla's had not room for all those great
objects which assisted in filling that of
her husband.
It was impossible for Cesario to avoid
the recurrence of one image, as he con-
templated the conjugal happiness of To-
ledo and the character of his wife — it
was that of the woman he wished to
forget.
Happily, her image came no longer in
the seducing dress of love and imagina-
tion; he saw her now, as she was in fact,
a thing to despise, and blush at, for hav-
ing squandered his soul on, — may, as

THE KNIGHT OF ST.JOHN. 87
the cause of all his faults and all his mi-
sery, for had she not lost him Giovanni?
“Would I could blot out that shameful
period from my life P’ he would exclaim
to himself, his cheeks burning, even
though alone, at that humiliating recol-
lection; “I loved her to distraction; and
for her sake flung from me the treasure
of my soul. I lose her, and her image
passes away like a shadow — I lose him,
and the world is a desert! Mighty God!
how ill do we read even our own hearts!”
Then would Cesario plunge into an
abyss of reflections on the mystery of
human passions, and the frailty of human
affections, till reason herself could no
longer struggle against misanthropy.
But Toledo's fraternal look, or Ca-
milla's tender voice, would at any time
draw him back again to friendship with
his kind; and then his heart would flow
out in a fuller stream of confidence for
this temporary check.
There was one circumstance which


## p. 88 (#98) ##############################################

88 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
severely pained Cesario: since the arrival
of Donna Camilla, he observed that To.
ledo was less gay than before. Two rea-
sons might be given for this change:
when separated from the object of his
tenderness, by what he deemed neces-
sity, Toledo had not allowed himself any
indulgence of regret; thus he was gay
then, only because had he been serious,
he must have been sad.
In addition to this, the gratifying ex-
pectation of seeing Malta relieved by his
father, was quite extinguished: and a
sense of disgrace substituted in its place.
To none of his private remonstrances had
the Viceroy been able to pay more atten-
tion than to the public applications of La
Valette. -
Burning to balance; if possible, his fa-
ther's failure by greater zeal on his part,
Toledo now courted situations of the
extremest peril; and if a thought arose
of the fate too likely to follow this teme-
rity, he banished it, in the fond hope

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 89
that Heaven would spare his life for the
sake of Camilla. -
A Greek deserter from the camp of
the infidels had brought intelligence
that they meant to attack the peninsula
De la Sangle by land and water. Finding
it impossible to bring their armed boats
against it, under the guns of St. Angelo,
(which they must pass, if they attempted
to enter the great port from the main
sea,) they had projected the astonishing
measure, of drawing them from the lesser
port actually across Mount Sceberras, and
so launching them again directly in
front of that point of the peninsula
called the Spur of St. Michael. -
The Isle de la Sangle, therefore, be-
came the post of danger, and for that
station Felix di Toledo solicited.
The surprise with which La Valette
heard this bold project of the enemy, was
not however coupled with incredulity:
he had not forgotten a similar measure,
by which the gallies of Dragut had es-

caped from a port blockaded by Andrea
Doria ; and he therefore set himself
immediately to provide against its ex-
ecution.
In this view, he raised batteries and
planted cannon on every part of the pe-
ninsula where a descent of troops was
practicable; while, to check their ap-
proach to the town of St. Michael, which
lay on the side opposite Mount Conradin,
he formed a huge staccado of piles, driven
into the sea, with chains, masts, and sail-
yards strongly fastened together; and
carrying it from the foot of Conradin to
the point of the peninsula, thus barred
all entrance to the narrow anchorage
beyond. -- .
The post of the gallies, already chained
in from the same point to the foot of
St. Angelo, he strengthened with dif.
ferent staccadoes of the same materials:

on their work by day, at night they la-
boured so vigorously, that these new de-
fences appeared like so many exhalations
to the infidels, who guessed not how
they could have been completed in so
short a period.
Still anxious to stay the dreadful effu-
sion of blood, which must have been the
consequence of his protracted and de-
termined resistance, La Valette deemed
it his duty to try again the forlorn hope
of an application to Sicily.
Another brave spirit was found as a
substitute for the exhausted Cesario, in
the person of Marco Doria, who had
learned that his father was still in the
port of Messina; and he prayed permis-
sion that he might go thither to animate
his exertions, if necessary, for the relief
of the Order.
His request was complied with. Marco
went, and returned: he returned hoping,
and deceived.

son's representation of the state of Malta,
and heard the death of him whose later
days held out the hope of atonement for
the past, than, transported with grief and
generous indignation, he ran to the Vice-
roy, offering to transport as many troops
to Malta as his gallies could convey; en-
gaging, by the strength and ability of his
rowers, to carry them all safely into the
great port before the heavy-minded Turks
could have weighed up their anchors.
“Let me,” he said, “but land your sol-
diers, and my sailors, (which I’ll answer
for with my head,) and I care not what
becomes of the mere hulks of my gallies.
My fortune shall answer for them to the
Republic — nay, my life, if she will have
it then.” -
The Viceroy, more cruelly bound than
ever, since the fall of St. Elmo, by the
narrow policy of his master, dared not
avow his painful bondage; he therefore
applauded this magnanimous offer, and
declaring his intention of immediately

setting sail for Malta, dispatched Marco
Doria with that intelligence to the Grand
Master. -
Meanwhile he persuaded the unsuspect.
ing prince to return to Genoa for per-
mission to abandon his ships, if need
were; since, unless he obtained such
sanction, Don Garcia said he could not
outrage his Royal Master's dignity so far,
as to venture upon accepting so bold an
offer from an unwarranted subject.
As the Viceroy gave Doria to under-
stand that he meant to sail himself, the
instant the soldiers could be embarked,
and that Doria's gallies would be em-
ployed, when he returned from Genoa,
for the transport of other troops now
levying, the honest sailor trusted to his
truth, and made the voyage, which was
to rid the other of his importunities.
Marco reached Malta in all the buoy-
ancy of a sanguine spirit; but La Valette
saw deeper into the intentions of Spain;
and, dismissing every thought of suc-

cour from that quarter, applied himself
with greater energy to defend himself
singly. -
No sooner did he perceive the view
of the infidels upon the Isle de la Sangle,
than he hastened to man that peninsula
with his best soldiers. Cesario, now re-
stored to a capacity for service, and
Toledo animated by a noble sense of dis-
grace, were amongst these new reinforce-
ments. -
Domna Camilla was not to be separated
from her husband. She dared all the
dangers and terrors of a temporary bridge,
thrown across from one peninsula to
the other; and, protected by Providence,
through the shower of balls under which
she was led by her fondly-chiding yet
grateful husband, she reached her desti-
nation in safety. -
Scarcely were they thus transported
from Il Borgo to the town of St. Michael,
when the two warriors were called into
action. The infidels, they were told,

had desperately attempted to force the
staccado; at least to break it, sufficiently
for their boats to pass through.
At this moment, some were seen swim-
ming towards it with their axes stuck in
their girdles; while others, already upon
it, were eagerly trying to cut it away
with their hatchets.
The firing from the Christian batteries
gave little interruption to this bold enter-
prise; for proceeding from too great a
height, it scarcely took effect.
Consternation had seized the few sol-
diers guarding the shore; but no sooner
did Cesario and Toledo reach it, than by
the same impulse each tore off his clothes,
and calling on those who followed, to
imitate their example, they took their
swords in their teeth, and, plunging into
the water, swam to the staccado.
There wanted but such an example:
numbers joined them almost instantly,
encouraged by Di Monte, who com-
manded at that station.


## p. 96 (#106) #############################################

96 THE KNIGHT OF ST. John.
The contest on the staccado was short
and fierce; each Turk disputed the posses-
sion of this important work with all the
fury of baffled confidence and frustrated
ambition. The Christians thought not
of themselves; nobler and stronger feel-
ings inflamed them; they fought for
the preservation of each other, and the
continuance of their Order.
Rodolphe alone was stimulated by a
thirst for vengeance; as he grasped
the throat of each opponent on the pile,
and at every deadly thrust of his dagger,
he shrilly pronounced the name of his
master.
The pulsation of Cesario's heart stop-
ped every time that name was uttered;
yet, only to beat again with greater force
of resolution. That name was his watch-
word to conquest: happily, individual re-
venge had no power over his Christian
principle. -
Toledo boasted the honour of hurling

CHAPTER VI.
Even after this affair, more than one
unsuccessful attempt to destroy the stac-
cado was made by the enemy. In vain
they varied their modes, and called in
the aid of their ships and levers; the
Christians triumphed over all their strata-
gems. Mustapha at length desisted;
and believing that success must depend
upon the actual weight of his whole force
being directed upon each smaller object
separately, he determined to attack the
Isle de la Sangle alone, with all his
troops.
A reinforcement of six thousand men,
under Hassan of Algiers, had just reached
him; and as Hassan, not yet acquainted
with the temper of the knights’ swords, de-

rided their romantic chivalry, Mustapha
yielded to his impetuous desire of attack-
ing them without delay.
While the infidels, therefore, were pre-
paring for a grand assault, by battering
the devoted peninsula from all their old
and new batteries; and the Christians
were as actively employed in strengthen-
ing their fortifications, and exercising
themselves in every species of hazardous
service; Cesario beheld with a tranquil
eye, for himself, the approaching struggle.
He hoped to fall, but to fall amidst vic-
tory: yet, even while looking to that
hour with the distempered impatience of
a world-sick heart, he breathed a prayer
for the preservation of Toledo.
It was impossible for a heart like Ce-
sario's to shut out all interest in objects
which, in his happier days, would have
warmed him with affection; and now he
contemplated Toledo and Camilla with a
sad tenderness, prophetic of ill; which,
if it deepened his own melancholy, did

not leave existence quite sterile of every
sweet and sympathising emotion.
There was something inexpressibly in-
teresting to him in that union of soft-
mess and heroism which he hourly re-
marked in Camilla : though her feelings
were torn by apprehension for her hus-
band, whenever he was at his post, or
exposing himself in some hastily con-
ceived enterprise, she never gave them
utterance to himself: she never at-
tempted to melt him into that momentary
weakness, of which he might afterwards
have repented. It was not that his
glory was dearer to her than her own
peace, but his self-esteem was. If there
were an action which her Felix’s calm
reason and principles would have con-
demned himself in the slightest degree,
for yielding to, even though that action
'might spare her days of agony, she would
have shrunk from urging it.
. His principles were fate to her: and
when her trembling hands armed him for

the fight, and her labouring heart almost
throbbed to bursting, she sought not to
detain him; breathing only blessings and
giving only farewell embraces, where one
more selfish (there could not be one more
fond) would have made her words sup-
plications, and her arms bonds. .
Cesario often lulled the remembrance
of his own irreparable losses of father
and of friend, in the endeavour to soothe
those fears which Camilla rarely ex-
pressed to any but him; and loving her
with the disinterested affection of a bro-
ther, he felt that if Toledo were to fall,
he could wish then to live, only to protect
her, and watch over their expected babe.
With these feelings strongly excited,
one night, after a day spent in harassing
sallies from different outposts, he saw
with a mixture of satisfaction and uneasi-
ness, on visiting the extreme end of the
peninsula, that the enemy were evidently
preparing for a sudden and fierce assault.
His honour was pledged to Toledo, to

give him the intelligence of every ex-
pected action, and, hastening back for
that purpose, he repaired to the town.
As he slowly entered the apartment
which contained his friends, he could not
help pausing a moment to contemplate
the picture they formed.
The light of a lamp fell directly upon
the spot where they were placed.
Camilla was sitting on a low cushion,
supporting her husband's head on her lap,
while he lay asleep. As she bent over
him, his manly figure, half despoiled of
its martial trappings, formed a picturesque
contrast with the delicate grace and light
drapery of hers.
The contrast was yet greater between
her fair face, all awake with fond and
varying expression, and his bronzed fea-
tures, fixed in tranquil sleep. Yet was
there so soft and sweet a smile upon the
lips of Toledo, while he slept, that, like
moonlight on the water, it seemed but

the reflection of the smile of her that
hung over him. - - - - -
At the sound of Cesario's step, she
started, and a vivid blush shot into her
cheek: she bashfully moved her knee a
little, as if to shake the sleeper off, yet
so gently, that she did not rouse him.
“He was so tired P’ she said, with an
air of embarrassment and apology; and
she continued to look down, ashamed of
her unwillingness to sacrifice her hus-
band's rest to her sense of propriety,
Neither this beautiful shame, nor the
tenderness which triumphed over it, were
lost upon Cesario: he advanced with an
air of respect, and, careful not to rouse
her fears by any abruptness, instead of
waking Toledo by the usual method, he
took up her lute as if by chance, and
making some courteous reply to her,
passed his hand somewhat strongly over
the strings.
Toledo waked at the sound: as he
opened his eyes, he saw Cesario sitting in

seeming composure near him. Used to
see him thus domesticated with them, and
quite wearied with past exertion, Toledo
just stretched out his hand to him, with-
out otherwise altering his position, bid-
ding his wife “sing him that air again.”
At his desire, Camilla took the lute,
and, bending over it, sang with all the
heart’s pathos, the following song : —
- S O N G.
THE mellow'd strain of distant horn,
O'er some wide-spreading water borne
At set of sun, to wanderer lone,
Is like his voice of silver tone
And heard amid the twilight pale,
When warbling sweet, the nightingale
Pours her fond soul to woods alone,
"Tis like his voice of silver tone ! .
The darkly-rich, empurpled hue
Of violet beds when steep'd in dew,
And moon-light on their surface lies,
Is like his soft and lovely eyes t -
And when Eve's star, with humid light,
Just trembles on the verge of night,
That tender beam, those shaded skies,
Are like his soft and lovely eyes!


## p. 105 (#115) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 105
The fond eyes which opened again to
raise themselves to Camilla's face, and
the tender, whispering accent which
thanked her, were faithfully described in
the words of her song: Cesario felt their
resemblance, and he could not stifle the
involuntary sigh which escaped him.
At that sound, for his sigh was fraught
with his foreboding and pitying heart,
Toledo turned on him an investigating
glance, and reading his countenance
started up: — “I see we are not to rest
to night!” he cried; “where is the point
threatened 2 Camilla, sweetest, fetch
me my lighter baldric.” -
His wife tremulously obeyed; and in
the rapid moment between her disap-
pearance and return, Toledo enquired,
and Cesario hastily named, the Spur of
St. Michael. -- -
Toledo took the baldric from his
wife with a bright look of ardour; and
while he eagerly armed himself, bade her
be of good cheer, for the faster the in-

fidels repeated their attacks, the sooner
would the Christians get to the end of.
their work.
“ And where is the assault now P”
asked Camilla, striving to diffuse a serene
expression over her suddenly blanched
and quivering features. “At the Spur,
dearest P’ replied her husband; “they
will not come on till day-break; but I
must be there directly, or perhaps—”
Camilla released the arm which she
had instinctively seized in both her
trembling hands; and, looking on him
through blinding tears, with an expres-
sion of love and submission, faltered out,
“O go — go, my Felix' I know it is .
right—and I can pray for you!”
Toledo caught her to his breast with-
out speaking : again and again he re-
laxed that fond grasp, and as often clasped
her to him anew. His heart, his eyes, his
voice, all overflowed with tenderness.
At length in a gayer tone, exclaiming
against his own folly, he reminded her

pled with a fervent benediction, he tore.
himself away. .
Camilla, all pale and trembling and
tearless now, caught Cesario's hand as
he was passing her, whispering, “Will it
be a very dangerous service to-night?”
“We can but guess at it,” replied Ce-
sorio hastily; “but I swear to you, the
sword that reaches Toledo shall make its
way through this body:” he kissed her
hand as he spoke, looked on her, and dis-
appeared.
The expectations of the Christians
were not deceived: when day dawned,
a strange and threatening sight presented
itself. -
A numerous fleet of boats, after having
been actually brought across the opposite
mountain, were seen covering the water
of the great port, advancing to the stac-
cado and the Spur, amidst the clash of

warlike instruments and the barbarous
hymns of priests and dervises. - -
Meanwhile Hassan, with the flower of
his new troops, was pouring down like a
torrent, on the land side, through all
those avenues opened by the continued
cannonading of preceding days.
The whole peninsula was thus placed
between two fires; and the destruction
of every thing upon it seemed inevitable.
: The besieged, however, undismayed
by common calculations, met them at
every point, opposing a few invincible
spirits to hosts of mere animal bravery.
Their courage seemed to grow with their
danger. They threw themselves upon the
enemy on the staccado, in the very sea,
upon the ramparts of the town, and the bas-
tions of St. Michael, with a boldness which
amazed and paralised their adversaries.
When at last, overpowered with the
increasing heat of a burning sun, they
were driven for a moment, by mere
weight of numbers, from their lines, they

returned, new-strung with noble shame;
and, rushing upon the infidels, hurled
them headlong from the walls.
How often that day was the same
standard wrested by Turk from Christian,
and from Christian again by Turk, each
time seised by the proud conqueror, in
the vain belief of secure possession
Many were the piles of rival dead that
fell at once under each other’s fire,

Cesario and Toledo fought their way
to the extremest point of the peninsula,

thunder of cannon, the smoke of which
favoured their descent.

commanded them, with desperate deter-
mination to conquer or die ordered back

dered impossible, and his troops find their

only path to their own camp through
the breasts of the enemy.
This daring experiment succeeded:
led on by their savage chief, the Alge-
rines rushed forward to the intrench-
ment with their scaling ladders, and,
clapping them against the wall, attempted
to mount.
The Christians, crowding to the place
threatened, showered death in every
form upon them below: the enemy fell
in masses under their pikes and swords,
But still new battalions succeeded; and
still the fight was renewed with redoubled
animosity.
In a few instants the standards of Ma-
homet were seen flying on the intrench-
ment; but, burning with pious indignation,
that remnant of gallant Christians re-
turned to the charge, and, tearing down
these hated trophies, drove the enemy
from the wall.
In the confusion of that repulse, Ce-

sario and Toledo, who had hitherto fought
side by side, were separated. Cesario
rushed after a Turkish officer who was
carrying off the only standard still in
the enemy's hands; and Toledo followed
the flying steps of Candelissa himself.
That coward renegade was the first
to turn his back, and to cast himself
headlong from the wall: Toledo sprang
after him. He averted his eyes from the
horrible pool of blood into which he
leaped; and, dashing through it, pursued
the fleeter dastard to the shore. - -

Algerines contested with backward step

So determined was their resistance,
and so few the numbers of their brave
enemy, that perhaps the tide of conquest
might have turned again, had not Ce-

a party of fresh soldiers which La Valette

rushing unexpectedly upon the infidels,

. The enemy was now beaten off from
every point round the spur of the penin-
sula; but the tremendous cannonading
and sulphureous clouds above the town
of St. Michael declared that the work
of death was still going on there. .
Cesario thought instantly of Donna
Camilla, who must be then in that scene
of horror; and with a thrill of alarm, he
looked round for her husband. -
He saw him not, and he hurried in
search of him. º
Each knight he questioned was igno-
rant whether the gallant Spaniard had
survived the action. Every one had seen
him in the hottest of the fight; and one
remembered seeing him pursuing the
flying Camdelissa. - - - -
Rodolphe, too, was missing. Cesario's
heart sickened: he paused a moment to
recover his palsied powers, and then he

THE KNIGHT OF ST.JOHN. 113
called loudly on the names of his friend
and his servant.
Nothing answered him but echoes. He
hurried onwards, still repeating at every
change of place those agitating names.
After frequent disappointment in va-
rious parts of the field, at last his cry
was answered by a voice, but not the
voice of either. It proceeded from a
groupe of soldiers at a distance, proceed-
ing in the direction of the town.
Cesario was in the midst of them with
the rapidity of an arrow. What a sight
smote him —the body of Toledo ex-
tended on a bier, hastily formed of the
pikes and clokes of his soldiers.
A ball had struck that noble heart in
the act of following Candelissa, and dis-
missed his soul, without one pang of
conscious death, to the bliss of heaven.
Rodolphe, who had followed Toledo,
and saved his remains from outrage, was
kneeling by the bier, weeping again the

death of his master, in the fall of one who
resembled him in his virtues.
Cesario stood heart-struck over the
bier: his grief had no voice, no tears;
it was deep, deep and silent.
He thought of the moment in which
he had seen that lifeless head reposing on
the lap of his wife : he saw again their
last embrace; he saw Toledo's last smile.
The humid eyes which had fondly hung
upon that smile, gathering from it hope
and confidence in heaven, would never,
never more, light up into joy!
Cesario bowed his spirit before the
unsearchable decrees of God. What
mortal may question them?—what mortal
does not prostrate his rebellious nature
with inward humility, when he thus sees
the judgments of the Most High passing
over himself and others? -
Having stood long in solemn medita-
tion by the remains of his friend, Cesario
stooped down and imprinted a kiss upon
the ice-cold brow; that touch dissolved

his heart; and, gushing into tears, he
rested his head there till the torrent was
exhausted. - v.
When Cesario recovered himself, his
first thought was Camilla; and he was
hastening to order the bearers of the bier
rather to turn back with it into the
fort than proceed to the town, where the
sudden shock of its appearance might
prove fatal to her, when, through the
scattered groupes of soldiers bearing off
the wounded, he discovered a figure
which he could not mistake, running in
the direction towards them.
It was Camilla, whom report had early
informed of her loss. -
She came with the same swiftness with
which Cesario had seen her fly to meet
her husband on her landing; but O, how
different was her countenance' – her
scattered hair blown rudely by the wind
was the only covering of her head; and
her face, stamped with the colours of

death, was filled with the most frightful
distraction. w -
She ran—she flew—she reached the
bier, and gazed an instant on the motion-
less face; then casting one look at Ce-
sario, precipitated herself upon the body
of her husband. -
Her arms locked that insensible body
in a grasp which nothing loosened but
the temporary suspension of her own
life: as those slackening arms fell power-
less down, Cesario caught her sinking
form. His heart yet ached with the wild
reproach of the look she had cast on him:
it seemed to say, “You live, and he is
dead l’”
Alas, in spite of his voluntary promise,
Cesario was not by to shield the rashly
brave Toledo; and if he had been so,
how could he have interposed between
him and the unmarked flight of a bullet?
Motioning for the bier to follow, and
overcome with these ideas, Cesario lifted

her in his arms, and, turning back, carried
her into the fort.
Some nuns, who were charitably assist-
ing in the hospital there, hastened to
receive and succour her. Cesario con-
signed her to them; and having seen the
body of Toledo laid under a pall in the
chapel of the fortress, he turned to go
away.
The solitary priest who officiated in
the place, was preparing to say a mass
over it: Cesario turned back and lifted
the pall. His eyes rested upon that still
and marbled face. The images of his
father, of Giovanni, of Toledo himself
while in life, of Camilla, of all in short
whom he had loved and lost, or might
yet lose, pressed upon his thoughts:
glory, revenge, duty, every other passion
and affection was dead within him at
that moment; he stood suspended in
spirit, till the increasing thunder of the
cannonading round the different posts

beyond the town called him back to
action. -
He rushed from the chapel; and, pass-
ing the chamber of Camilla, saw Ro-
dolphe seated sadly upon the ground
before the door.
“Rodolphe P’ he cried, “you love this
unhappy lady—stay here—I must go,
and I would not leave her without one
familiar face to look on.”
He did not wait for reply; but hast-
ening to the remote post where the
Basha and Hassan were making another
attack, he plunged into the thick of the
combatants.

CHAPTER VII.
From this point, and nearly every
other, the enemy were beaten back, after
several days and nights of continued
fighting: neither party intermitted their
fury but when exhausted nature could
not be urged further.
The shores of the peninsula and the
waters of the port were hideously covered
with dead, amongst which might be
counted the bravest and the noblest of
the Order. As their numbers were hourly
decreasing, and the fortifications of St.
Michael nearly demolished, nothing but
the miraculous appearance of the Sicilian
succours could, it was thought, preserve
them.

holding those heroic men with any sen-
timent of admiration, found their valour
only inflame his rancour; and once more
changing his measures, he determined
to divide his forces, and attack both the
peninsulas of St. Michael and St. Angelo
at the same time.
Each day, after this resolution, new
batteries arose, and swept down every
thing in their line of fire. At the same
moment the Turks assaulted all the
posts of the Christians, thus distracting
their attention, and dividing their shrunk
forces. -
Women and children were now obliged
to lend their feeble aid; and as the in-
fidels scaled the walls of a work, amid
showers of stones and boiling pitch, they
were amazed to find themselves falling
under the hands of such weak adver-
saries.
Night and day this tremendous struggle
continued: the rock resounded with
groans, and flowed with fire; so that

to those who wandered over the seas,
it must have appeared like some super-
natural beacon; or rather like the gulf
of Tartarus yawning to receive them.
Cesario no longer cheered by the so-
ciety of Toledo, and weary with so many
sights of horror, began to repine at his
own safety: in vain he cast himself into
the hottest parts of every action; no
ball had its commission for him. '
Life was now indeed completely deso-
late to him : he had been summoned back
by the Grand Master, to his original
station, the lines of Il Borgo; and was
thus cut off from all information of Donna
Camilla.
But soon, alas, Rodolphe rejoined
him from the isle De la Sangle, after
having seen the widowed Camilla laid
in the same grave with her husband.
Nearly in a state of insensibility she
had given birth to a dead child, a few
hours after Cesario left her; and had

second affliction.
“And this is the world I once coveted
so [* exclaimed Rodolphe, as resting
awhile from their duty, he talked over
the various losses which Cesario and
himself had sustained.
, “’Tis a world of trial, Rodolphe,”
replied Cesario. “I once thought it a
world of happiness, and I was told other-
wise by our Divine Teacher—now, my
soul weeps that mistake in blood!—But
let us rouse ourselves—let us remember
that all we mourn, yet exist, yet behold
us—yet tenderly regard us:–letus make
ourselves worthy of reunion with them.”
“O, that I had never left my caveſ”
was Rodolphe's answer, as, smiting his
breast, he turned a wistful and miserable
look towards France.
At that moment, the explosion of a
mine at a distance terminated their dis-
course. That explosion had blown down
part of the wall at the bastion of Castille,

and the enemy were already mounting
the breach.
Cesario and Rodolphe ran to join the
defenders. They saw the Turkish co-
lours planted at the foot of the parapet;
and heard the remoter roar of cannon
which convinced them that an assault
was making at that very moment upon
the distant castle of St. Michael.
Now seemed the crisis of both im-
portant posts. Cesario started forwards,
and beheld the Grand Master himself,
without helm or cuirrass, or any other
defence than the sword he had snatched
up in haste, rushing upon the enemy,
regardless of those knights who were on
their knees, imploring him to remember
that the existence of Malta depended
upon his life. - -
“What! when ye are all so worthy
to command P’ exclaimed La Valette,
with animation. “Give me way—I or
those standards fall this moment.”
At these words, Cesario boldly pushed

him back; and starting forward with a
few companions, as nobly resolved to
conquer or perish, each seized a flaming
standard, (for they were blazing with
the combustibles thrown on them from
above,) and hurrying back, laid their
trophies at the Grand Master's feet.
. . This daring act inspired general emu-
lation: the Christians rushed upon the
foe with preternatural power, sweeping
them before them like a flood. --
But again and again the human tide
rolled back; and one wide scene of car-
mage presented itself. -
The knights, inspired by the presence
of their Grand Master, were elevated
beyond themselves; they heard the va-
liant resistance at the isle De la Sangle,
and fearing to be outdone in bravery by
the garrison there, not one would quit
the action, even though covered with
wounds, till death had released, or victory
rewarded him. -
Such firmness was sure of conquest.


## p. 125 (#135) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN, 125
The enemy at length sounded a retreat,
leaving some of their most distinguished
officers, and nearly all the troops they
had brought to the assault, dead or dying,
before the disputed bastion.
The Christians' loss was less consider-
able; but La Valette himself was wound-
ed; and the destruction on the isle De
la Sangle, (though there, too, the enemy
had been foiled,) was fearfully great.
. Once more the Grand Master deter-
mined to call upon the viceroy of Sicily;
and hoping that his heart would either
be softened into pity for others by his
own private loss, or inflamed (though
culpably) to revenge, he commissioned
Cesario to sail for Sicily with the sad
news of Don Felix’s fall, and a last
demand for succour. -
A tempestuous wind which lasted dur-
ing the few days in which the breathless
enemy remained quiet, prevented Cesario
from attempting the passage. His own
life he set not “at a pin's fee,” but on

his reaching Messina in safety, hung the
lives of all the inhabitants and defenders
of Malta.
. On the fourth evening, the wind fell,
and immediately seizing this opportunity,
Cesario was hastening through the town,
when, by one lingering gleam of light
which yet contended with evening, he
saw an arrow drop at his feet. It had
evidently been shot from the Turkish
camp, on the heights above; and he
passed it as a danger gone by, and un-
cared for. -
But Rodolphe, observing something
thrust into a part of the shaft, stooped,
and picked it up.
He drew forth a narrow slip of Taffeta
from the arrow, and gave it to Cesario.
The latter took it eagerly, and went with
it to a porch illuminated by a lamp.
When he cast his eye on the silk, he
uttered a piercing cry: there was only
the word “Thursday” written there, but
the characters were the firm and peculiar

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN, 127
ones of that hand, which till now, he had
believed ceased from all its functions.
Pressing these precious characters to
his lips, Cesario dropt upon his knees,
all his faculties suspended in one seizure
of awe and joy. .
Rodolphe wistfully looked at him,
without daring to enquire what all this
meant: “He lives!” cried Cesario, again
pressing the blessed testimony to his
heart, and to his lips, and gushing into
tears, “Your master lives l’’
Rodolphe fell to the ground as if
struck by lightning. -
The mixed transport of doubt and
hope, of incredulity and rapture, which
followed the poor fellow’s recovery of
sense, perhaps enabled Cesario to bear
his own overwhelming happiness. He
repeated his conviction of Giovanni's
existence, both from the characters of
this writing, and the information it was
intended to convey; and, having seen the
delirious joy of Rodolphe, at last melt

into tears and thanksgivings, he left him
in the charge of a sentinel, while he flew
back to the Grand Master with the
arrow and its important freight.
La Valette's feelings were seen in the
bright suffusion of a cheek, long since
rendered pale by many cares and many
griefs.
“ Giovanni Cigala lives P’ was his ex-
clamation after a short and solemn pause
of inward devotion: “we will take his
preservation as a blessed omen for our.
selves. A miracle has been worked for
him — may not the same gracious Pro-
vidence work one for us?”
The intelligence meant to be conveyed
by Giovanni, could not be mistaken.
Thursday was evidently the day fixed on,
for some peculiarly fierce attack from the
enemy; and La Valette assured Cesario,
that thus warned, he would prepare to
meet it with the utmost power of his
mind and means.

Cesario's heart, was once again on
earth and in Malta; but with the great
object upon which he was going, Gio-
vanni's deliverance was bound up ; and
that circumstance animated him to pro-
ceed. - f -
Earnestly beseeching the Grand Mas-
ter to question whatever prisoners might
now fall into his hands, upon the situa-
tion of that beloved friend, he rejoined
the joyfully distracted Rodolphe; and
committing themselves to the mercy of
the winds and waves, happily gained the
open sea, unsuspected and unseen.

CHAPTER VIII.
During their short voyage, one great
joy obliterated, for awhile, the very re-
membrance of past sorrow. Cesario and
Rodolphe talked and thought only of
Giovanni. When compared with his
death, his captivity seemed dust in the
balance; and hoping for miracle upon
miracle, they abandoned themselves to
an intoxication of hope, nearly amount-
ing to the convictions of insanity.
These balmy feelings were not, alas!
of long continuance. When Cesario had
to tell the mournful tale of Toledo and
Camilla to the heart-struck Viceroy,
their happiness so exquisite, yet doomed
to destruction, warned him not to reckon
upon any promised blessing; and when
15

he heard the Viceroy, amid his lamenta-
tions and threatenings, confess his inabi-
lity to move before the arrival of further
instructions from his court, he sunk at
once into despair.
This weakness was brief; he roused
himself anew, and discovering that Don
Garcia's secret wishes were, in fact, to
succour the cause for which his son had
fallen, he set about rousing that spirit of
determination in the troops, which might
afford their leader a plausible pretext for
yielding to his own desire.
This plan succeeded. Inflamed by the
eloquence of Cesario, alternately melted
by the affecting picture which he drew of
the sufferings of the besieged, or stimu-
lated by their heroism, the soldiers burst
the palace-gates, calling on the Viceroy
to lead them to the relief of those de-
voted heroes.
They who had served under Felix di
Toledo, invoked his father, by that affect-
ing name, to aid their vengeance: while

those who had fought under Don Garcia's
banners, on the shores of Africa, called
on him to remember those scenes of his
former fame, nor leave others to reap
the fresh laurels he might win at Malta |
At length, pressed on every side, by
crowds without and friends within ; and
urged, besides, by his own warlike hu-
mour, and parental regrets, Don Garcia
named Syracuse as the rendezvous; and
set out thither to assume the command.
Each different division, headed by ar-
dent and experienced captains, was com-
posed of veteran soldiers, and volunteers,
whose intrepidity made up for their
youth and inexperience in war: to these
were added several brothers of the Order, f
gathered together from distant countries.
All were now hurried on board the
transports by Cesario's influence; his im-
patience not allowing one instant's re-
laxation to the Viceroy. - -
In this he was ably seconded by the
general spirit; so that by the first of

September the whole army was embarked,
and the fleet getting under weigh, amid
the discharge of cannon and the accla-
mations of multitudes.
Scarcely could Cesario and Rodolphe
restrain the most frantic expressions of
joy, when on the fifth night they drew
near the channel of Goza, and heard the
faint reverberation of the Turkish and
Maltese artillery. -
There was the goal of all their hopes
and fears! A few hours would determine
whether those hopes were to end in bless-
ed certainty, or whether those fears were
to be dismally realised.
That dreaded Thursday! — How had
it passed ? - -
. Even as Cesario's eyes were fixed
on the gradually-increasing rock, and
his heart labouring with those anxious
thoughts, the wind changed, and blew
so violent a gale, from an adverse point,
that in an hour or two the fleet was di-

vided; one division entirely losing sight
of the other, and both dispersed.
After long combatting the fury of the
elements, damaged, but not destroyed,
the transports and gallies which the Vice-
roy commanded regained the coast of
Sicily, and cast anchor at Passal:—there
they were joined by the vanguard of the
fleet, under Don Juan Cardona. **.
Impelled by the impetuosity of his
companioms, Cardona had persisted, in
spite of the elements, in steering for
Malta, and had actually landed the troops
he carried.
No sooner was this circumstance pro-
claimed by his appearance with his empty
transports, than the soldiers of Don
Garcia, still doubting his sincerity, sur-
rounded the council-room, where he was
displaying the cruel fetters by which a
newly-arrived mandate from Spain had
bound him; and forcing the entrance,
proceeded in tumultuous heaps into his
presence ; demanding to be re-embarked

immediately, and landed at all risks in
Malta; or threatening, else, to seize the
ships, and command themselves. -
The sparkling looks, and silence of
the officers, whom they called on to
strengthen their party by their coun-
tenance, convinced Don Garcia that
these mutineers would be supported
in their brave rebellion ; he therefore
made a virtue of necessity; and rising
from the council-board, exclaimed,
“My friends, I admire your spirit too
much to punish your rebellion : — see
that you justify this forbearance.”
He then gave orders for the reimbark-
ation of all the troops, and dismissed
the assembly, amid their shouts and ap-
plauses.
Once more, then, they put to sea:
once more they came in sight of Malta.
Cesario stood on the deck of the viceroy’s
vessel, near the viceroy himself, regard-
ing him with a look which deepened in
its sternly-threatening expression: as he

drew nearer the object desired, he dreaded
only the more being again torn from it.
They were now steering for the western
side of the island; having learned off
Goza, that the Turkish fleet, expecting
they would attempt to relieve St. Angelo
by forcing the entrance of the great port,
had drawn up all their fleet there, adding
a huge staccado of impenetrable strength
across its mouth. -
When near the island, the wind had
changed unfavorably, and the vessel was
necessarily obliged to be tacked several
times, to gain the harbour. In making
the last stretch off the land, which the
master of the vessel, apprehensive of the
wind still becoming more contrary, had
lengthened to seemingly an unnecessary
distance, Cesario took alarm: he fancied
this the beginning of a new series of re-
tracting artifices; and turning on the
man with all his suspicions in his aspect,
cried out in a terrible voice, “He that
utters another word of delay, shall find

this sword in his heart—if I perish the
moment afterwards.” -
As he spoke he glanced his eyes upon
the viceroy with a look which needed no
interpreter. “I understand you, young
man!” said Don Garcia, haughtily return-
ing his glance with one of less noble fire:
“command your countenance; or it will
undo you, if you mean to rise in life.”—
“Rather may I fall, than rise basely P’
was Cesario's rash and biting answer.
. The viceroy's hand was instantly upon
his sword. The flash of the weapon, as
he drew it forth, attracted the attention
of the other officers; and immediately
interposing, they gave the two irascible
spirits time to cool.
Even while they closed upon them,
the vessel was casting anchor; and some
lighter ones were disembarking their
CreWS.
That sight subdued Cesario: he re-
turned his sword into its scabbard, with a
crimsoned countenance, as, bowing re-

spectfully to the viceroy, he said, “There
is your excellency’s triumph,” and he
pointed to the anchored gallies.
Don Garcia hesitated an instant, then
held out his hand to him with an altered
countenance: Cesario put the hand to
his lips; and calling on Rodolphe, flew
to assist in lowering the boat which was
to convey them to the land.
Once more on that island, which he
loved for Giovanni's sake, and which he
believed still contained that precious
friend; Cesario felt new life in all his
limbs; and as he counted the stout bat-
talions which drew up on the shore, as
they disembarked, till they formed one
formidable body, he asked himself whe-
ther this were not some wild dream of
sleep or madness 2 -
The viceroy had now stretched his
powers to the utmost : his instructions
were to return immediately to Sicily;
which, of course, its governor could not
in prudence leave for the indeterminate

time to which the siege of Malta might
yet be drawn out.
He reviewed the troops, harangued
them upon their duties, and their illus-
trious cause ; reminded the soldiers of
his gallant son: and, faithfully promising
to dispatch the Prince of Melfi with his
gallies and auxiliaries, the moment he
returned from the Genoese coast; he re-
embarked amongst the acclamations of
his army.
* Ere the army commenced its march
for la Citte Notabile, the centre of the
island, its commanders de Sande and
della Corna, deemed it expedient to
give the Grand Master as early intel-
ligence as possible of their arrival; and
Rodolphe offering himself for the service,
if accompanied by a peasant acquainted
with the country, to take him by the
shortest path to the vicinity of Il Borgo;
he engaged after that to proceed alone,
and get through the enemy's lines un-
perceived, or unsuspected.


## p. 140 (#150) ############################################

140 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
His offer was accepted; for none be-
sides himself and Cesario (whose local
knowledge was required for the march of
the troops) knew the situation of the
Turkish camp; or the circuitous ways
by which it might be skirted.
Cesario briefly commended the zealous
Cahet to Heaven; and charging him
with numerous questions about Giovanni,
shook hands with, and dismissed him. .
The troops had halted; and were en-
camped in a strong position, between a
fortified monastery, and la Citte Notabile
when Rodolphe returned.
The news he brought winged his feet.
He related, that when he entered Il Borgo,
the standard of St. John was flying from
the tower of St. Elmo, and from all the
Turkish batteries round : that panic-
struck, when they heard of the landing
of the Sicilian succours, and magnifying
their numbers in proportion to their own
fears, the enemy had precipitately with-
drawn all their garrisons, spiked their

*
guns, destroyed their stores, and afraid
of being blocked up in the great port
and besieged in their turn, had embarked
on the instant.
La Valette had then lost no time in
seizing the abandoned stations: and
happy it was that he did so, for the in-
fidels, on hearing the real force of the
new troops; and finding it did not ex-
ceed six thousand men; instead of pro-
ceeding to sea, had turned back, and
seeing it vain to attempt repossessing
themselves of the posts they had fled
from, were now landed in the bay of St.
Paul; determining to seek and give bat-
tle to the Christian army.
This was the public news brought by
Rodolphe: his private intelligence, though
scanty, was yet more precious to the ear
for which it was intended.
The Grand Master himself had assured
him, that from one of the wounded left
by the Turks in their hospital, and since
dead, he had heard that Giovanni Cigala

lived, and was a prisoner in their camp :
but how saved he knew not, nor why
preserved. '
Cesario embraced Rodolphe in the
transport of joy with which he heard
these glad tidings, – he did not blush to
yield to his softened and grateful feelings
with one who felt the same, – What now
should damp those hopes, which the
Divine breath itself seemed graciously to
kindle?.
When after his effusion of rapture, the
apprehensive Cahet expressed a fear lest
the infidels should butcher their prisoners
in cold blood, out of revenge for their
present disappointment; Cesario chid his
want of faith in the mercy of that Pro-
vidence, whose arm was now evidently
stretched out to save ; and by a variety
of animating arguments, in favour of the
many possibilities of Giovanni's escape,
during the present confusion in the
enemy's movements; or, at least of his
being preserved unhurt, for the sake of

obtaining their prisoners better terms;
he succeeded in imparting his own con-
fidence.
Impatient for the moment which was
to decide the fate of the infidels, and
terminate his own anxiety, Cesario at-
tended a summons to immediate council.
He found the officers -discussing,
the two questions of whether it were
best to remain in their present strong
position, and there await the enemy, or
advance and give him battle in the
plain 2
Each opinion had its supporters. The
prudent and the timid maintained the
propriety of resting where they were,
behind intrenchments, whence it was
scarcely possible they could be dislodged;
and so waiting till the infidels, who came
unprovided with provisions, and who
must sink under the heat of that open
champaign, were obliged to return to
their ships.
. The rash and the ardent represented,

on the other hand, the disgrace of thus
conquering without striking a blow; they
suggested also, that finding them thus
planted, the enemy might suddenly fall
back either upon Il Borgo or St. Michael;
and, stimulated by despair, carry one or
both these places ere the army could
march to save them.
What then would be the shame and
remorse of all now in the camp 2 It is
true, their numbers did not exceed six
thousand effective men; and the infidels,
even after their losses by war and disease,
yet mustered three times that force : but
the one army was fresh and resolute; the
other, war-wearied and disheartened.
De Sande, who commanded the army
of Naples, was one of those who coun-
selled bold measures: Della Corna, the
representative of the Viceroy, urged the
certainty of success by less hazardous

stant which might restore Giovanni to .
freedom, started from his seat, and, de-
livering his opinion for immediate battle,
with all that eloquence of speech, and
countenance, and gesture, which made
him irresistible in whatever cause he
chose to plead, won over to his side more
than half his adversaries.
No sooner did he perceive the effect
he had produced, than, checking his im-
petuous oratory, he briefly summed up
all the arguments he had adduced; then
added, - “These are the reasons which
weigh with my judgment—you are to
pronounce whether they are sound or not:
but I will confess, that my heart also is
impelled forward, – impelled, not merely
by passionate zeal for the preservation of
an illustrious Order, but with desire to
recover the noblest of warriors, and the
dearest of friends: Giovanni Cigala lives,
and is prisoner to the infidels.”
All the knights present, had known

Giovanni in former days, and not the
meanest soldier but had heard of his
fame: they set up a shout of joy at this
communication; and, tumultuously hur-
rying from the council, declared they
would themselves rush upon the enemy,
accompanied by their military followers,
and cut their way to their captive bro-
ther. - -
“ I opposed your opinions, but I will
share your danger!” exclaimed Della
Corna, mixing with them ; and no other
officer attempting to renew the debate,
orders were given for the whole army to
quit their camp, and march down into
the plain.
No sooner were they in motion, than
they beheld the close battalions of the
Basha advancing slowly towards them.
The meridian sun flamed over the gor-
geous ranks of the infidels: their numbers
and their array were imposing. But
though Cesario, as he eyed them, for the
first time in his life, breathed a prayer


## p. 147 (#157) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JoHN. 147
for his own preservation, he doubted not
the success of his brave companions.
, Life was now dear to him, because
Giovanni was in bondage: and no zeal
for his deliverance could be expected to
equal that of the friend whose happiness
was bound up in his liberation. -
If Cesario were to fall, Giovanni's re-
lease might not be sure. These were the
passing thoughts of a moment; Cesario
turned to Rodolphe by his side, and,
casting on him an inspiring look, he said
as they rushed into the fight, “Now for
the blessed Cross, and your master.” -
Then began the roar of battle—then
flowed the tide of blood. The Turkish
officers fought as if that spirit which had
deserted half their soldiers, was all in-
fused into their breasts. They alone
gave a short and fearful check to the
sweeping torrent of the Christians: but
overwhelmed at last, they sunk under the
weight of the whole Christian force, and
were either borne along with their own

flying squadrons, or trampled under foot
by the hotly-pursuing foe.
The routed infidels fled to the coast,
where they threw themselves into shal-
lops, nay, into the very waves themselves,
in the hope of reaching their ships.
But the knights, jumping into the sea
after them, regardless of the artillery
thundering from the Turkish fleet, turn-
ed those crimsoning waves into another
sanguinary field. -
Many were the struggling wretches
who fell under their eager blades!
Mustapha himself marrowly escaped
death as he scaled the tall side of a
gallion. His safety was the signal for
a second flight: the whole fleet slipped
their cables; and, crowding sail, were
soon far from the scene of their defeat,
and the memorials of their disgrace.
As Cesario, who had been one of Mus-
tapha's pursuers, rose from the water, he
saw an old man clinging to the side of
an overturned shallop on the beach :

a soldier stood over the man, in the act
of cutting him down.
The victim’s white hair and suppli-
cating action were more eloquent with
Cesario than a thousand tongues. He
ran towards him; and, wresting away
the soldier's weapon, called on him to
remember mercy.
The soldier retreated in sullen obe-
dience; and the rescued person uttering
a cry of joy, flung himself at Cesario's
feet. -
“I am not mistaken l’’ he exclaimed :
“ that look—that voice—O, signor, this
is the second time!”
Cesario regarded the man, who spoke
bad Italian with a Jewish accent; and,
believing he had never seen him before,
said gently, “ You mistake me for some
other; but I will nevertheless protect
you from evil treatment. My name is
Cesario Adimari.” ---
The man regarded him earnestly,

while with an agitated voice he proceeded
to recall himself to the recollection of
Cesario.
He announced himself to be a Jew,
belonging to one of the Greek islands
under the dominion of Turkey, declaring
that he had joined the Ottoman camp
merely in the exercise of his business,
as a provider of stores, &c. His first
knowledge of Cesario, he acknowledged
with lively gratitude, to have been at that
period when the latter retook the inha-
bitants of a Tuscan village plundered
by the Algerines. 2.
This person, at that time accompanied
by an only son, was passing through
Italy on a mercantile speculation; and,
halting at this village, was amongst the
prisoners.
“I have since lost that dear Son,”
said the old man, weeping: “he is dead;
but I shall never forget the joy I felt
when our brave deliverer set him free.

And now again he saves these withered
limbs from death or tortures O that
I could repay the debt I owe him ſ”
Cesario was moved by the apparent
sensibility of Reuben (so the Jew was
called); and, assuring him of his protec-
tion till he could learn the Grand
Master's pleasure about the disposal of
prisoners, he transferred him to the care
of some faithful followers, and went in
search of Rodolphe. -
Rodolphe was not far distant; and
though both his own body and that of
Cesario gave bleeding testimony of their
valiant share in the dangers of the day,
they could ill brook the delay which was
necessary for themselves and others, ere
the army could set forth on its victorious
march towards Il Borgo.
The troops loitered on the shore till
the last Turkish sail disappeared from
the horizon: then uttering a shout, some
fell upon their knees in pious transport,

and others sunk to the ground, overcone
with fatigue and pain.
The severely-wounded were then se-
lected and sent off in litters to La Citte
Notabile, the nearest quarters; while the
rest of the troops, and those whose
wounds did not deprive them of the use
of their limbs, after a few hours’ refresh-
ment, began their march.
Thus ended a siege that had lasted
above four months; during which time,
a garrison not exceeding mine thousand
men had withstood the attacks of an
army thrice as numerous, supported too
by a formidable fleet. And what en-
hanced the difficulty of the Christians'
defence, was the determination and valour
of their enemies.
Never had the infidels displayed such
skill and such courage; and never had
they been so valiantly outdone in both.
When the victorious army, after a
short march, entered Il Borgo, they be-
held it with a mixture of admiration and

regret: it seemed as if they came its
conquerors rather than its preservers;
for every where it lay in ruins.
Fallen houses, shattered fortifications,
destroyed magazines, attested the severe
assaults it had sustained since Cesario's
absence. The half-famished inhabitants
slowly crawled among those melan-
choly remains, like so many spectres;
and the little remnant of knights, who,
with their Grand Master, came forth to
meet their more fortunate companions
in arms, were covered with the honour-
able testimonies of their sufferings, and
all pale and neglected, as if they had
neither slept nor rested throughout that
dreadful siege. -
They advanced with slow and some-
what unsteady steps, for they were all
well nigh worn to complete feebleness:
each countenance, however, was bright
with conscious desert, and gratitude to
approving Heaven. At sight of this
sacred band, all the knights who were

mixed with the fresh troops, broke tumul-
tuously from their ranks, and ran to re-
ceive them in their arms. -
Many were the embraces and tears of
that affecting moment! Those who had
gone through the horrors of the siege,
thought of all they had vainly hoped
might have lived to this joyful hour; and
those who came, had each to learn the
fall of friends or relations whom they
had fondly expected to find in life.
As the magnanimous La Valette rested
for a moment upon the shoulder of Ce-
sario, their hearts laboured with the
same sad remembrance: the name of
Toledo was half-breathed between them,
and their mutual tears embalmed his me-
mory. -
“Now, brave spirit!” said Cesario in-
wardly, as he rose in silence from the
Grand Master's embrace, apostrophising
Toledo, “ now thou art satisfied! —
Thy father’s honour is retrieved.”
Wiping his darkened eyes, he gazed
I5

round to note the faces of the surviving
garrison. Only a few were familiar to
him; the Order was nearly annihilated.
But with what respect did he look
upon that band of heroes! With what
overflowing love and admiration did he
contemplate the wasted form and pallid
countenance of La Valette -
That wasted form was still erect in all
the majesty of an unbending mind; and
that countenance, beaming with magna-
nimity, gave assurance that the impreg-
nable part of Malta had lain in the cha-
racter of her prince.
The standards of St.John, floating from
all the Christian and Turkish batteries,
completed this august picture. -
As Cesario's agitated eye ran a second
time over the surrounding knights, he
missed two whom he had left in the
ardour of youth and enthusiasm : their
names escaped him unawares. “Marco
Doria — Henri La Valette l’” he ex-
claimed.

156 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
“ Doria is desperately, I fear mortally
wounded;” said the Grand Master, re-
plying to him in a low firm voice, “ and
Henri's earthly race is done.”
He turned his eyes upwards as he
spoke, with the look of the patriarch
when about to offer up his only son in
sacrifice.
Cesario's blood ran cold — he pressed
his hand upon his eyes: La Valette
looked on him while he did so, with a
powerful expression of affection and sad-
ness; then, struggling against a sigh,
called on all present to attend him to the
church in the town.
After immediate and public thanks-
giving, the foreign and home troops dis-
persed into different quarters; and each
individual was then left free to prosecute
the private enquiries prompted by lin-
gering hopes or mourning affection,

CHAPTER IX.
AFTER having learned the pleasure of
La Valette respecting the prisoners taken
during the late engagement, Cesario's
first act was to seek his Jewish captive,
and place him under the care of Ro-
dolphe. - -
Humanity would have prompted this,
had not hope been there as a stimulant;
he thought it possible to gain some infor-
mation of his friend from Reuben, and
with this view he questioned him.
From the barbarous policy of the
Turks, their number of Christian pri-
soners was so few that such a one as
Giovanni could not be overlooked: Reu-
ben had seen him; Reuben could tell
the story of his miraculous deliverance;

158 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
and the substance of what he related was
briefly this: —
When the ferocious orders of Musta-
pha were executing upon the bodies of
the slain and dying knights at St. Elmo,
a Turkish officer recognised that of
Giovanni, yet warm with life. This
young man, whose name was Morad, had
been second in command of the vessel
captured by Giovanni in the Santa Croce;
and Giovanni's noble treatment of him,
and flattering. admiration of his gallant
conduct upon that occasion, had awak-
ened in his heart perhaps the strongest
sentiment of gratitude ever felt by an
infidel for a Christian.
Morad was retaken by his own coun-
trymen during the siege; and being
nephew to Mustapha himself, was en-
abled to protect the man who had for-
merly protected him. -
With that habitual prostration of mind
as well as body, which is ever found in
the slaves of slaves, he threw himself at

the Basha's feet, kissing the dust, and
imploring him in the humblest terms to
grant him the disposal of this still-bleed-
ing corse: he recapitulated all the obli-
gations he owed to Giovanni; expressing
his abhorrence of treating with indignity
the remains of one who had sheltered
him from insult and degradation. Gio-
vanni's interference, he said truly, had
saved him from the gallies, the usual lot
of prisoners taken in war.
Mustapha was, for a long time, in-
exorable; at length, spurning that noble
and weltering form with his foot, he bade
his nephew do what he chose with it:
Morad eagerly seized this ungracious
permission.
He bore his prize to his tent; and
there, all that a naturally-feeling nature
could dictate was exerted to stop that
effusion of blood which had already re-
duced the beatings of Giovanni's heart
so fearfully, that they were imperceptible

to the hand which so anxiously sought
pulsation.
Morad was assisted in his grateful
task by his own people, and by a sur-
geon of some ability belonging to the
camp. The bleeding once stopped,
(though a work of infinite difficulty,) life
began to re-appear; the arteries slowly
recovered their visible motion, and to-
wards evening Giovanni just opened his
eyes; he closed them again immediately,
his powers being too weak for observa-
tion, may, even for thought.
In this state he remained many
days; but though outwardly the same,
nature was inwardly rallying and repair-
ing all her losses. In a little time after-
wards he became conscious of what was
passing around him, and by slow degrees
recovered the faculty of speech and of
motion.
His protector's life thus preserved,
Morad believed himself more than ever
bound to defend him; and though the

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 161
Basha's hatred of Giovanni, whom he
looked upon as the most formidable indi-
vidual hostile to Mahomet, was unap-
peasable, Morad wrung from him a
promise that Giovanni's life should be
held sacred, even though the chances of
war might take away that of his guardian.
Therefore while Morad lived, Reuben,
who had heard this recital from one of
his slaves, used to see Giovanni, at times,
walking at large through the camp,
shackled only by honour.
But Morad was slain upon that mo-
mentous Thursday which Giovanni had
dreaded for his brethren in Il Borgo:
the Knight of St.John then fell solely
into the hands of Mustapha, after which
Reuben saw him no more. He could
only say, that he heard the Basha
kept his word, and that his prisoner
lived. -
“And where was he, know you, in
the last action?” asked the agitated,
almost despairing Cesario, after having

162 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
listened with gratitude and hope to the
first part of this narration.
“Of course in one of the ships,” was
Reuben’s answer; “the Basha did not
reland his sick nor his prisoners, when
he disembarked his army again.”
“We have no hope then, but in gold,”
exclaimed Cesario, after a long and
troubled train of thought; “and if gold
cannot ransom him, they shall have my
liberty for his.” He went out, after this
vain determination, anxious to perform
his grateful duty to the Prince of Melfi,
by hastening to render every service to
his son.
He found Marco Doria quite delirious
from fever, and in a state of such suffer-
ing, that but for the miraculous instance
of recovery which Reuben had just de-
tailed, Cesario would not have indulged
a thought of his life. He now questioned
the medical persons round, upon their
opinion of him ; and, finding that nearly
all would depend upon the constant

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 163
watchfulness of one person night and
day for a given period, he determined
to be that person; and to save, if pos-
sible, the father’s heart from a second
and a heavier blow.
Ere he entered upon this benevolent
duty, Cesario went to the residence of
the Grand Master, and besought an au-
dience of him. His business was to
speak of Giovanni.
The information he had to give, and
the petition he had to offer, were ad-
dressed to one nearly as warmly inte-
rested in the liberation of Giovanni, as
Cesario was himself. La Valette entered
into every detail with the liveliest interest.
The path they had to pursue was plain
he thought, and would most likely be
successful: it was to negociate with the
Porte for the release of the few prisoners
taken during the siege, and to purchase
Giovanni's freedom at any price.
Although the funds of the Order were
entirely drained by the late ruinous con-

test, and many of their possessions pledg-
ed to different states for monies already
expended, their credit was now higher
than ever; and La Valette assured Cesa-
rio, with generous pride, that neither his
mite in addition, nor any part of Giovan-
ni’s own property would be accepted, to
re-purchase his invaluable life from the
infidels. - -
He further added that a channel of
communication should be immediately
opened between Malta and Constanti-
mople; and that Giovanni'sfreedomshould
be the very first subject of negociation.
Meanwhile the Turkish prisoners were
to be strictly guarded and retained in
the hands of the knights; and the Porte
informed that whatever acts of wanton
severity it might exercise upon the
captive Christians, should be retaliated
upon its own people.
Cheered and satisfied by this liberal
plan, Cesario returned to Marco Doria,
by whose bed he took his station for

fourteen days and nights. At the end
of that time, Marco was pronounced out
of danger, and Cesario rewarded for so
long a period of watching and painful
anxiety by that assurance, and by his
patient's recognition.
No sooner was Marco permitted to
converse, than Cesario found that what-
ever alteration the late great events had
made in him, they had not abated his
passion for desultory talk. He roved
over a thousand different topics in a
moment; passing from the terrible to the
ludicrous, and thence to the sad, with
the rapidity of a mind which had never
dwelt long enough on any one subject
to fatigue or so deeply interest him as to
leave him indisposed for excursions upon
whatever airy nothings might start up in
his way. Among the numerous subjects
which Marco treated, was the character
and conduct of Beatrice Brignoletti.
At the first mention of that name,
Cesario started as if he had trodden

166 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
upon an adder; but, recovering himself
with laudable disdain of his own weak-
ness, he said, “This feeling of shame,
Marco, is only a right penalty for my
past folly: I assure you, I have been
long since cured of my insane passion for
that pernicious, infatuating 92
“Hold, hold | don’t call names, or I’ll
swear your heart is not sound yet,” cried
Marco. “ However, for the comfort of
you lovers of fair and perfect beauty,
I will tell you, that one look at her now
would cure you! A green and yellow
melancholy has eaten up the damask of
her cheek.” -
Cesario’s cheek blanched at this un-
expected information; a thousand pain-
ful recollections thronged on him at
once, and gave a reason for this change
which penetrated his soul.
“When where did you see this?”
asked he, in a voice not quite as steady
as he could have wished,
“I met her last in Sicily,” replied


## p. 167 (#177) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 167
Marco. “Six weeks ago, when I was
soliciting the succours, she and the Mar.
chesa had just returned from a voyage
to Spain, whither she had thought fit to
go, to dissipate past chagrins; and I saw
her not five hours after her landing at
Messina.”
“And there, I suppose, she heard of
Giovanni's reported fall?”
“Yes; I told her.”
“You told her ?—Then, what a scene
you must have witnessed!”—and Cesario
put his hand upon his eyes, as if to shut
out the fancied sight of her agonies.
In spite of his bodily weakness and
real concern for what he believed the
lingering passion of Cesario, Marco burst
into a fit of laughter. When his astonish-
ed friend saw that it was downright
mirth, and not the frightful violence of
an hysterical affection, he turned se-
verely from him, and rose to leave the
TOOnd.
- “Pardon me!” cried the half-alarmed

Marco; “laughter, you know, is the
vice of my nature. Not even the horrors
of this siege have cured me of it;
though,” added he, in a graver tone,
“they have soberized my heart, and
will prevent me from playing the fool
in life's pantomime again: but to look
wise at the folly of others, is more than
I can promise; and it was so irresistibly
ludicrous to compare the picture which
I know your imagination drew of Be-
atrice's conduct, with what I saw in the
reality, that my risible propensity could
not stand it ! At the moment I met
her in Messina, she was in the agonies
of despair for the desertion of a certain
Don Antonio or Alphonso; and so list-
ened to the tale of Giovanni's fate, as if
I were talking of the man in the moon.”
Cesario put his hand over his eyes
again, but from a different feeling.
“ Her Spanish lover,” continued
Marco, “released himself from her chains:
on the pub's report of her former co-

quetries; and she is now, (alas, my poor
cousin () the object of universal ridicule
and contempt. For herself, she may feel;
and that is her punishment: but for any
sympathy, now, with you or Giovanni,
you may as well look for it in that butter-
fly. Depend on it, my dear Adimari,
there are no hearts so cold, when once
chilled, as those which are so soon and
so violently set in a blazeſ”
“That is a very wise apophthegm of
yours,” observed Cesario, trying at a
careless air, but inwardly and deeply
shocked at this indelicacy and hardness
in Beatrice; “and so, I will leave you
to meditate upon it!” He withdrew
abruptly.
“And there are no hearts so impos-
sible to be recalled,” he said to himself,
following up the last remark of Marco's,
“as those which would have adhered to
the chosen object through every change
of time and fortune, had they not been
wantonly repelled. Such hearts bear

much—bear long : but once stung to the
quick by injury or contempt, their keen
sense is not to be dulled by all the opiates
of future artifice, or future acted peni-
tence.” - -
During the many reflections conse-
quent on this conversation with Marco,
Cesario's most powerful conviction was
one which Giovanni had always urged
upon him, That, however we may suffer
under afflictions, the period always comes
in which we recognise their beneficial
effect, either upon our character or our
fate. -
Cesario had lived, as Giovanni used
to prophecy, to consider his loss of Bea-
trice as a blessing rather than a misfor-
tune. What would have been his mi-
sery, had he been united to her, and
waking from the enchantment of imagi-
nation, found himself bound for life to
one whose heart would cease to have any
sympathy with his, the moment it ceased
to regard him with passion ?

... He shuddered at the possibility of
such a situation; and giving a sigh of
commiseration to the fading beauty of
the now-contemned Beatrice, sincerely
prayed that she might from those timely
chastisements be brought to turn her eyes
inwards, and discipline her feelings into
that order which would eventually pro-
duce for her both respect and happiness.
From the image of one who might
well have made all female worth sus-
pected, Cesario naturally reverted to that
of Donna Camilla; and, as the convales-
cence of Marco Doria allowed him to
cross over to the isle De la Sangle, he
went to visit the grave which contained
her and Toledo. *
As he passed over the ground which
he had last trod with that gallant friend,
when side by side they stemmed the
torrent of the infidels, so many recollec-
tions pressed upon him, that he scarcely
knew how he should stand the view of
I 2

the actual spot where that hapless pair
slept their last sleep.
Was it right, he thought, thus to in-
crease the sum of human wretchedness
by courting painful emotions 2
Both his heart and his reason answered,
yes. -
We are told that “it is better to go to
the house of mourning than to the house
of feasting; for by the sadness of the
countenance the heart is made better:”
and if we do not abandon ourselves to
that continued indulgence of sorrow,
which incapacitates us from the perform-
ance of worldly duties, we may be assured
that our dispositions are softened, our
hearts purified, our minds elevated, and
our sympathies extended, by an occa-
sional renewal of such impressions as
strongly revive the images of departed
friends. - n
At the moment of Cesario's entrance
into the cemetery, a clouded moon shone
at intervals through the fir-trees, which

grew near the grave of Toledo and Ca-
milla. The cemetery overlooked the sea,
whence a hollow wind came rushing, and,
shaking the heads of the old fig-trees,
strewed their sun-withered leaves over
the mound below.
No other foot but that of Cesario’s
disturbed the stillness of that narrow
mound: no living object was visible;
and Cesario, solitary in the dreary scene,
felt as if that wailing wind and those
murmuring waves were joining the la-
mentations of his oppressed heart.
Not even the recollection of Giovanni
still living, and preserved most likely to
be more entirely the companion of his
soul than ever, could abate the anguish
with which he cast himself on that grave.
His lips instinctively repeated the names
of Camilla and Toledo, and his arms
vainly embraced the earth which covered
them. *
Nothing replied to that afflicted em-
brace. The deep silence which followed

each sad address, only deepened the com-
viction that they upon whom he called,
were indeed no more.
O the desolation of such convictions !
and how often do we lose them only to
suffer again and again the acute pain of
their renewal
Cesario’s short life had been full of
great calamities; and he did not feel the
deaths of Toledo and Camilla as the
least of them. -
... While he thought over all the comfort
those friends had been to him under his
heaviest affliction, and imagined the hap-
piness which they might have heightened
for him, he could not forbear questioning
the reason for his many trials. He found
it in his own character: for he remem-
bered all the faults of that character,
and he felt its amendment: calamity had
been his teacher,
He then endeavoured to calm his pre-
sent feelings by reflecting how many be-
sides himself were bereaved by this cruel

siege, not only of valued friends, but of
their nearest and dearest relatives. The
chances of war had been comparatively
merciful to him; for he had escaped
himself, and Giovanni survived, to whom
his life was every thing. Rodolphe's
safety too, and the recovery of Marco
Doria, were not mercies of small ac-
COunt.
Subdued by this balance of his pri-
vations and his possessions, Cesario’s
grief at length subsided into that pro-
found but unresisting melancholy which
it is not culpable to feel, and which it is
not misery to indulge. He left the
cemetery, a proof that it is good to go
into the house of mourning; for he left
it with stronger convictions of Heaven's
wisdom and goodness. -
A real pleasure awaited him at I
Borgo: the Prince of Melfi was arrived
there.
When this gallant seaman returned

from Genoa with permission to follow
the dictates of his own brave spirit, (on
his own conditions of indemnifying the
republic for her gallies, if obliged to
abandon them;) he heard there that
the siege was raised: but the joy of this
welcome intelligence was cruelly damped
by the painful account of his son’s
danger; and, re-embarking immediately,
the anxious father set sail in a single
ship for Malta.
Cesario found him by the couch of
Marco, listening to his lively sallies, and
perusing his altered appearance with a
mixture of cheerfulness and apprehen-
sion.
The traces of tears were on the ve-
teran’s weather-darkened cheeks ; but
his eyes smiled; and when he saw Cesario
enter, he started up and clapsed him in
his arms. -
“Welcome, Adimari, welcome!” he
cried, repeating that heart-felt pressure
at every breath. “They tell me Marco

owes his life to your care; what, then,
do I owe you?” -
The father took Cesario’s hand within
both his, as he loosened him from his
embrace; and Cesario then felt that he
had put a ring upon his finger. He
raised his hand to the light, in compli-
ment to the donor; but seeing the dia-
mond which had belonged to his father,
he started and would have torn it off.
Doria held it forcibly on, beseeching
him with such earnestness and affection
to retain it, that Cesario's distress was
insupportable. “You know that I re-
ceived it from you in the earliest hour
of our acquaintance, as a pledge to be
one day redeemed,” continued the ge-
nerous Prince, still keeping his hand
firmly upon that of Cesario. “How
would you have it more nobly won back
than by this second benefit conferred on
me and mine? would it please you better
to buy it with ducats?” -
“And have you the audacity to rate

an effeminate bauble higher than my
soul and body?” asked Marco gaily;
“for, as I mean henceforth to become a
very good-for-something personage; and,
had I died, I must have gone where those
spirits went, which our Dante describes as
——“Wretched souls, who lived,
Without or praise or blame,”
I must be considered as a soul saved
by you. Put the ring fairly upon your
finger, and make my father happy.” .
Cesario turned his eyes upon that re-
spectable father, and met so kind, so
grateful, and entreating a look, that it
quite vanquished him.
He put the ring to his lips, his face
all bright with tears, and his heart all full
of his lamented parent. He then kissed
the Prince's hand without the power of
articulating a reply, and sat down by the
couch of Marco. -
The conversation, when resumed,
turned upon Giovanni. Of his final libe-
ration Doria would not allow himself to

doubt, though he warned Cesario to
prepare for vexatious delays and diffi-
culties which the Turks would certainly
start to enhance the price of his ransom.
Warmly grateful for present hope,
Cesario believed himself prepared for all
future anxieties, provided they did not
threaten that cherished hope with de-
struction; and he now entered with eager
interest into Doria’s calculation of the
time which must elapse before they could
learn the event of their applications at
Constantinople to the Sultan Solyman.
As the negociation had to reach the
still-hostile Porte by a circuitous chan-
... nel, no immediate agent from Malta
being admitted, it must necessarily be
drawn out to some length; a circum-
stance which it required all Cesario's
best reasonings to bear without repining:
but, cheered by the presence and sym-
pathy of Prince Doria, strengthened by
the calmer arguments of La Valette, and
obliged to animate the desponding Ro-

dolphe, he contrived to wear out the
days and weeks which intervened between
the departure of the Turkish fleet and
the arrival of an answer respecting the
redemption of prisoners.
That answer fell like a thunderbolt.
For the few prisoners made by the butch-
ering Turks during the siege, the Porte
were willing to receive their own cap-
tured soldiers, with the addition of suit-
able ransoms: but for Giovanni Cigala,
they would not accept any sum. That
which rendered him inestimable to the
Order made him pernicious to its ene-
mies:, his bravery, his skill, his reputa-
tion made it an act of policy in the
Sultan not to use his authority over
Mustapha.
Mustapha, at this crisis, was in no
humour to yield any thing to humanity:
his passions were all inflamed by defeat
and mortification, and the sharp rebukes
of his master; he therefore swore that no
treasure should buy from him that hated

Christian, whose arm and counsels so
often triumphed over the best heads and
swords of Turkey; that nothing short
of his imperial master’s command should
make him relinquish the savage pleasure
of revenging upon the most esteemed of
the knights, the shame and vexation with
which the Grand Master's victory ha
overwhelmed him. - -
This sentence was definitive; for La
Valette's agent, having previously re-
ceived instructions how to act, in case
such scarcely credible obstinacy should
be opposed to their wishes, had left
neither importunities nor temptations
untried to win the Mussulman from his
fierce determination.
Mustapha, however, was not to be
conquered here; and, repeating his reso-
lution for the last time, never afterwards
admitted the baffled negociator into his
presence. , -
The shock of this disappointment,

caution by the Grand Master himself to
Cesario, almost crushed him : it was long
before his dismayed faculties recovered
their power; and when they did so, he
remained fixed in intense thought for a
much longer period; then abruptly rising,
he left the presence of La Valette, un-
conscious that he had not replied to his
sad communication.
In truth, his friend was absorbed in the
consideration of a project which had
struck him; and solely intent upon that
one object, he forgot every thing else.
He went straight to the place where
his Jewish prisoner was lodged, and en-
tering to him, said precipitately,–" Reu-
ben, you profess to be obliged to me;
your looks express it, even more than
your words; therefore I believe it. —
Would you serve me in return ?”
“With all my means, I am sure,”
replied the old man; “ and I think, with
my life too, if that were absolutely ne-
cessary.” .

Cesario regarded him for a moment
with a countenance expressive of the va-
rious feelings by which he was agitated;
then trying to steady his fluttered breath,
said, “I take you at your word. And
now to tell you of the service I require
of you: — No ransoms will be accepted
for Giovanni Cigala; but if I die, or be-
come a slave myself, he shall be set free.
I tell you openly, that I will immediately
attempt this; though, as yet, I know not
where he may be, nor how to reach him;
nor after that, how to get him away: but
it is my resolution never to rest while he
lives, until I effect his escape. Can you
assist me in this? – Will you do so, if I
procure your enlargement for this ex-
press purpose?”
Reuben’s sallow face brightened with
glad surprise: “O my lord!” he ex-
claimed, “I will do any thing, every
thing, so that your precious life is not-
endangered.” -

Cesario pressed his hand, and more
distinctly stated his wishes.
Several plans were then started and
examined; and at last it was settled, that
Reuben should be set at liberty, and re-
turn into his own country, accompanied
by Cesario disguised as one of the same
race. . - -
Cesario spoke the lingua Franca fami-
liarly ; and had heard enough of the
modern Greek, during his voyage to the
Levant, as warranted his belief of soon
acquiring it entirely, from the instruc-
tions of Reuben. Fortunately, his per-
son was not adverse to the imposture;
for the Asiatic character of his eyes and
complexion, and the Grecian line of his
features, might easily enable him to pass
current for a native of Greece, when it
might be essential for him to be so repre-
sented. - -
During the latter time of the siege,
he, in common with the knights, had suf-
fered his beard to grow uncared for:
15

thus he wanted nothing but a black
gaberdine and a different demeanour to
make him a complete Israelite. The
one was easily procured, and the other
he could possess himself of by con-
tracting his open chest, and substituting
a slow crouching pace for the liberal
air and martial step of his former habits.
Reuben’s house was in Zante; thither
it would be expedient for them to repair,
and there endeavour to learn whether
Mustapha (to whom the vacant govern-
ment of Santa Maura was just given, as
a sort of honourable banishment, by his
irritated master.) had brought his captive
along with him.
That circumstance ascertained, Reu-
ben assured Cesario, that he thought a
liberal command of money for bribes,
and extreme discretion in its use, would
be likely to procure Giovanni's enlarge-
ment from some of Mustapha's inferior
agents; and, if that method failed, they
must then be guided by circumstances in

whatever enterprise they might attempt
for his release by stratagem.
As it was indispensable to the success
of their measures, that no one should
suspect the real character of Cesario,
Reuben warned him that he must accom-
pany him to the synagogue, and conform
in all things to the usages of their wor-
ship. Cesario was at first startled by this
proposal; but a moment's consideration
convinced him that, in complying with
this necessity, he was not violating any
principle; he was not denying the Savi-
our who declared that he came, not to
do away the law, but to fulfil it.
The religion of Moses formed part of
every Christian religion; and Cesario
might therefore, without impiety, join
in a worship which was but imperfect,
not profane.
Having explained this to Reuben, who
bowed in silent respect, they renewed
their league of fidelity to each other.
Transformed into a new creature by

hope and impatience, Cesario flew back
to La Valette, to acquaint him with his
plan, and arrange a mode of obtaining
money whenever it might be wanted for
the great emergency they anticipated.
He had to seek the Grand Master: he
found him in the apartment of Marco
Doria, rewarding him for all his suffer-
ings, by eulogiums given in the presence
of his delighted father.
Not one of the three attempted to
dissuade Cesario from his enterprise; but
the elder ones bade him remember how
much he risked by thus trusting himself
to the good faith of a man almost un-
known to him, a Jew, and the subject of
the very power which opposed Giovanni's
release.
“You may wander for a year or two
among those islands,” said Doria, “with-
out finding out your friend's prison; or
succeeding in his escape. What will be-
come of your prospects in our Marine
meanwhile 2’’. -

“I can have no prospect but one at
present,” replied Cesario with animation,
“ Let me but regain Giovanni, and I’ll
take my chance for my future life.-
The seigniory may efface my name from
the navy of the Republic, but, thank
Heaven, they cannot blot out myservices!
And the man who has had a post here,
may defy neglect or injustice hereafter.”
“Proudly spoken!” exclaimed Marco,
with a laugh. -
“Nobly ſ” observed La Valette,
turning upon the inconsiderate Marco,
“Young man, never be ashamed to show
that you know your own value: for un-
less we estimate our qualities, we shall
not long preserve them. There is no
dignity of character without a modest
consciousness of worth : remember that;
and neither think yourself culpable nor
ridiculous, when you feel a heart-glow
at the mention of the siege of Malta.”
The benignity of La Valette's smile, as
he uttered the last sentence, softened the

effect of his awful eye-beam when he
began this reproof: Marco bowed and
blushed; while his brave father thanked
his instructor in his son’s name, both for
the compliment and the lesson.
The conversation then reverted to the
original subject; and having discussed
it under various points of view, and re-
ceived many valuable hints from his two
elder friends, Cesario departed.
He went out from them with a buoyant
spirit, for he had obtained every thing
he asked. Reuben’s liberty was freely
given; and La Valette had promised to
receive Rodolphe into his own residence,
and be watchful over him during the
absence of Cesario.
Cesario's only hard task remained: the
task of convincing Rodolphe, that in
leaving him behind, Cesario was doing
violence to his own feelings; from a con-
viction that Giovanni's freedom might
depend upon the facility of flight from
whatever place he might be confined in.

Of course the greater the number of
persons to be disguised, the more would
their difficulties be multiplied; conse-
quently Cesario believed it his duty to go
singly.
As he expected, when Rodolphe heard
the projected enterprise, and found that
he was to have no share in it, his dis-
appointment nearly amounted to dis-
traction.
All at once his intellect seemed hope-
lessly, obstinately dull; for still he re-
peated, that he cared not for danger,
that he was ready to die, or yield him-
self to slavery for his master.
“Ready to do every thing, my good
Rodolphe, but the only thing which
you can do to further his cause!” said
Cesario, tenderly, but firmly : “I re-
peat to you, that if I thought your mas-
ter's liberty could be purchased by your
loss of freedom, or by your life, since
you are willing to give either for him, I
would allow you to make the sacrifice.

But I tell you neither will avail: your
total ignorance of the people and places
amongst which I must go, would prevent
you from knowing how to make one
practicable attempt for his service, how-
ever ardent your zeal might be ; there-
fore you could not undertake this en-
terprise alone : and I have already stated
to you, why it is an enterprise for one
person only. -
“You are anxious to evince your at-
tachment and gratitude to your master :
do it by conquering yourself. Believe
me, he will fully estimate the greatness
of the sacrifice: he will know how little
it would cost a brave man to die for
him ; — and how much, a grateful heart,
to refrain from impeding his escape by
indulging in the display of its gratitude.
Consider — after we had managed his
rescue, we might be so circumstanced as
to have a limited mode of getting away—
some boat that could receive only one—
two: some disguise, that could not with

plausibility be assumed by more than
that number. Would your master aban-
don his faithful Rodolphe upon such an
occasion ? No; he would stay, and be
retaken.” -
Poor Rodolphe held down his head.
“ I see it now !” he said, contending
with the bitterness of his disappoint-
ment; “go then, Signor Adimari. —
You are very happy!”
Cesario now pressed his hand with
great kindness; and, soothing this laud-
able sensibility with a mixture of con-
dolence and agreeable prophecies, he
succeeded in calming that extreme tur-
bulence of feeling, which had at first
armed itself even against reason.
His arrangements after that, were
quickly made : Reuben did not loiter;
so that early in October, they set sail for
Sicily, and thence in a neutral ship, with
a favourable wind, for the Ionian sea,

CHAPTER X.
There had been a time, when the mere
prospect of beholding Greece would have
roused the whole soul of Cesario, and
conjured up all those mighty dead, who
yet live in history: but those noble
associations were so troubled now, by
personal knowledge of Grecian degrad-
ation, and by anxiety for the result of
his present enterprise, that he approached
those memorable shores, at first without
enthusiasm; but at length his senses
gradually awakened to new and delight-
ful impressions.
As he entered the channel which di-
vides the Island of Cephalonia from that
of Zante, the perfumed air which is said
to float sensibly from, the bowery shores,

of the latter, stole on his sense, diffusing
a sensation of delicious refreshment and
of soothing tranquillity.
The rising moon shed her tremulous
light above the mountains of the Morea,
illuminating, as she continued to rise, the
distant hills of Epirus, and the shores of
the Peloponnesus.
As his vessel glided through the silver
sea, Reuben pointed out the far-off gulf
of Corinth on one side, and on the other
the verdant steeps of Arcadia. Cesario
gazed on them with a kindlingwish to take
in all those memorable regions at a single
view: he was at once seized by the sud-
den and awful power of the illustrious
Past. - -
What innumerable shades then peopled
the void of air to his entranced sight!—
He saw heroes, and sages, and bards,
pass in majestic review before him; while
his rapid memory ran over, with the
celerity of light, the noble records
which sanctify their names.

The vessel, meanwhile, slowly floated
forwards, passing vineyards, and olive-
grounds, and orange-groves, alternately
embosomed in deep vallies, or glittering
on the sides of hills. When they entered
the bay of Zante, Cesario's thoughts
changed: he remembered the time when
he last passed its chalky boundaries; and
he thought of Genoa. - -
The city, lying along a semicircular
and broken hill, and the bay extending
between steep wooded cliffs, had that
general resemblance to his native place,
which is sufficient to melt the heart with
fond recollections of home.
The waters of the bay were sparkling
like diamonds in the moonlight; and a
solitary wind-instrument, sounding at in-
tervals from the woods on the height
where the castle stands, gave additional
effect to the touching charms of night
and meditation. -
“Beautiful scenes!” involuntarily sigh-
ed Cesario, gazing around, “am I to

remember ye in after days, with aversion,
or with pleasure — are ye to restore to
me my friend ?”
He turned at the troubled voice of
Reuben. The old man had left a daugh-
ter at Zante in such delicate health from
recent affliction, that he dreaded to
ascertain her present state. He now
spoke of this daughter and of her children,
(for she was a widow, with a family,) in so
affectionate a style, that Cesario felt re-
assured upon the subject of his fidelity;
and he thought justly, that strong vir-
tuous affections are, nearly always, the
guarantees of integrity.
Happily, on disembarking and re-
pairing to his home, Reuben found his
daughter in life and comparative health :
her joy at seeing him was an additional
testimony to the worth of her father,
and Cesario failed not to register it.
Reuben had his own plan of policy:
and, presenting Cesario, to her as a young
pman of their own race, whose freedom

friendly attentions and useful talents, he

joint release had been procured.

vanni; and, though perhaps it mattered
little at Zante, should the opinions he
delivered there, be contradicted by what
he must eventually utter at Santa Maura,
the great theatre of his subsequent mea-
sures, the discordance of the two might
defeat his purpose. :
Reuben was sincerely grateful; and
Reuben would indeed have done much
to prove this: but the life for which he
held himself so bound in gratitude, was,
from a certain feebleness of character,
wonderfully dear to him; and he sought
out, therefore, every artifice to prevent
it from being endangered. - - -

convinced, must be effected through the
subordinate agents of the obstinate and
arrogant Basha. They would most pro-
bably be tempted by a great bribe to set
him free; but should it be otherwise, he
deemed it wise to have an extenuating
plea for his own conduct, in-ease that
should be called into question.
This plea was to be necessity; instead
of negociating for the release of the
Christian knight, with an acknowledg-
ment of deep interest in it, Reuben
meant to represent the folly of the Basha
(to those he intrusted with the care of
Giovanni) in refusing the enormous
ransom offered by the Order. He meant
to insinuate to them, that if they would
contrive to deliver the prisoner into
his hands, so as it might appear he had
escaped of himself, he would obtain the
offered ransom from Malta, and faithfully
share it with them. Thus the Basha’s
officer or officers would become masters
of a considerable sum, and Reuben be

enabled out of his slender share to make
up to his family for the grievous price
he had been obliged to give for his own
freedom.
Reuben’s story was not doubted at
Zante; and as Cesario, (though he mar-
velled at the old man’s plausible inven-
tions, and imposing gravity in narrating
them,) never contradicted his fabulous
tortures in the dungeon of St. Angelo,
he passed for a very suffering and in-
censed man, – one, certainly, not in the
least likely to aid the schemes of a Chris-
tian. - - -
To support the character of poverty,
-Reuben lived with marked frugality,
keeping his supposed servant in constant
occupation, for the avowed purpose of
thus working out what the other had laid
down for his purchase. Cesario was thus
obliged to bend his spirit to all but ab-
solutely servile tasks: these, Reuben
had the address to save him from, though
he certainly saw with secret complacency -

all he gained by the forced industry of
his noble associate. -
Nature had given Cesario a strong,
mechanical genius; and during the siege
he had not unfrequently been obliged
to exercise this genius, while sharing
with the other officers the laborious
offices of the common men. ... . . . . .
Amongst these had been the repairing
and cutting down of small vessels: and
now, to afford Cesario regular occupation,
removed from the prying crowd that
frequented his employer’s warehouse in
the city, and to prepare for their antici-
pated emergency, Reuben set about re-
fitting and improving a damaged vessel
which he bought at a low rate, purposing,
he said, to freight her, when completed,
with the products of his currant-vine-
yards and bees, for some friendly port
in Italy. . - - -
Perhaps, he said, he might touch at one
or two of the neighbouring islands, as he
went along, to collect their peculiar mer-

thandise for disposal abroad. Meanwhile
it behoved him to labour at making up
his losses, by getting this vessel put into
a state fit for sea, whenever his cargo
should be ready. .
: The information which Reuben re-
ceived about the Basha rendered this
management necessary: for it was likely
that they must wait some time longer in
Zante; and if all that time no deter-
minate business had been given to Ce-
sario, first curiosity would have been
excited, and next suspicion. r
... The Basha, it was ascertained, had left
Constantinople, and was slowly proceed-
ing through Romania to Albania, where
it was likely he would sojourn at the re-
sidence of his son, before he came to his new
government; and as an escape was easier
made from an island exactly opposite the
Calabrian coast than from the inner land
of Greece, Cesario was obliged to confess
that his best chance of success lay in
waiting patiently at Zante, till they

should hear that the Basha was settled
in Santa Maura. At such a time
Reuben would undertake to transport
himself and his servant thither without
suspicion; for then he would freight his
ship, and proceed to Santa Maura
under pretence of taking in both her
products and those of the country be-
hind, for sale in foreign ports.
- So far every thing went smoothly:
Cesario’s inclination to trust Reuben was
changed into habitual confidence. He
was assured of his prudence, though not
always pleased with the artifices it dic-
+ated; and he often found relief from
over anxious thoughts in the sports and
caresses of Tamar’s children.
Humanity soon supplied him with
another interest, powerful enough to mo-
derate the impatience with which he
counted the days, and at last weeks, of
Mustapha's slow progress.

Through a vista of olive-woods, the sea

were visible ; while on the verdant emi-
nences overhanging the valley, hung
groves of fruit-trees.
His boat-yard lay farther down towards
the shore; and there it joined the unpic-
turesque warehouse and extensive pre-
mises of an opulent female Greek, the
widow of a trader in the natural com-
merce of the island. -
This woman still carried on the same
traffic upon the same scale, employing a
number of persons in the manufacture
of oils and wines, the culture of currant-
vineyards, and the management of bees.
The lowest and most laborious details
of these various branches of trade, she
assigned to slaves of both sexes, pur-
chased out of Turkish corsairs. Some
of these wretched creatures were em-
ployed both in the business of the house
and of the manufactory; and so entirely

were their sex and constitution disre-
garded by their inconsiderate task-mis-
tress, and so miserably were they fed,
that many of them appeared within a few
hours of dissolution. - -
The boat-yard of Reuben, on one side,
opened into a common piece of ground,
in which stood an ancient fountain over-
hung by pomegranates, and a plane-tree
seemingly as ancient as the fountain.
The slaves of Lydia, (so the Greek trader
was called,) often came thither to fetch
water; so that Cesario had frequent op-
portunities of marking their wretched
and fatigued looks, and hearing their
dismal complaints. -- a
- Amongst these unhappy beings, he
particularly noticed one young woman,
whose figure, though more wasted and lan-
guid than any of the others, was distin-
guished by an elegance of air which not
even her coarse garments could entirely
conceal. Exact proportion (that integral -
part of beauty) was to be traced in her

equally slender form; the same sea-
breeze which defined the symmetry of her
slight limbs, sometimes lifting the quan-
tity of dull hair which shaded her sallow
face, discovered features which, if round.
ed by health and happiness, would have
mocked the chissel of Grecian sculpture.
Now, those features were but expressive
of sickness and suffering : the cheeks
were pale and hollow; and the smooth
brow to which nineteen summers would
only have given more smoothness, was
contracted by habitual care and fear. ... "
A mortal weight hung on her half-
closed lids: yet now and then, from
beneath those heavy lids, Cesario marked
a look of dying sweetness steal from her
humid eyes while they wandered from
earth to heaven, as if hopeless of relief
from aught below. . - - -
. . Often did his ear catch, and his heart
feel, the heavy sigh which accompanied
this silent appeal: for Cesario was drawn
to the fountain by solicitude for Tamar's

children, who, attracted by the wild
berries that grew near it, and by the
fruit of the pomegranates which over-
hung the well, pursued their sports,
heedless of danger. -
Cesario often observed the eyes of
Zeila, for by that name he one day
heard the young slave summoned to her
hard toil, fixed tearfully upon those in-
nocent and happy little creatures, while
an expression, at once sad and tender,
softened the wilder character of suffering
which marked her countenance. She
seemed either envying them or regretting
some object they recalled; and though
she never attempted to engage their at-
tention or win from them a single caress,
it was evident she had pleasure in looking
at them. a
With prompt humanity, Cesario soon
discovered Zeila's stated periods of com-
ing to the fountain, and then he always
contrived to be within sight; when he
would run and fill the pitchers for her,
*

accompanying the kind action with ex-
pressions of concern and sympathy.
At first, Zeila received these benevo-
lent attentions in dejected and unaltered
silence, and retired immediately. But by
degrees she evinced more sensibility:
an unsteady colour would flit like super-
natural light over her cheek, and tears
sparkle through the long fringes of her
downcast eyes. - . . ;
The familiar intercourse of near neigh-
bourhood, and the occasional want of
mutual assistance, often drew . Cesario
into the grounds and offices of Lydia's
manufactory; he there saw Zeila almost
constantly, sinking under tasks far, far
beyond her strength; and of so servile a
nature, that when he contrasted them
with her silent dignity of manner and
matchless elegance, he felt assured that
her lot was very different from her birth.
Once he came upon her unexpectedly
at the hour of dinner, and heard her say

rapidly to herself in Italian, “No more!
no more!—though I die!”
… He advanced, and saw her place her
scarcely-tasted portion of food at a dis-
tance; then totter back to a tree, where
she supported herself trembling and
breathless.
… Her ghastly looks and moistened fore-
head, testified the toil that had exhausted
her; he noticed it, and would have put
the little flask of milk to her lips, but she
sprang away with sudden power, repeat-
ing the first words she had ever addressed
to him, - “None! —none!” -
This strange conduct made him ima-
gine her brain disordered; and this
suspicion, with the knowledge that she
must be his countrywoman, only served
to heighten his interest in her dismal
destiny. * * * :
Zeila, however, did not inspire com-
passion only; some things she did, com-
manded esteem. In the cool of evening,
when labour was suspended, Cesario often

met her supporting the feeble steps of a
blind old slave, whose occupation was
the construction of hives and baskets,
and who was dependent upon the kind-
ness of his fellow-slaves for recreation
after his sightless task. - t
The old man, naturally peevish, was
rendered still more so by his infirmities.
and his cruel condition; he therefore re-
ceived Zeila's amiable cares, as if they
had been so many injuries: still, however,
Zeila persisted in rendering them... In
truth, she had habituated herself to minis- .
ter to his age, and submit to his humour,
until he seemed actually to have forgotten
that a feeling of resentment, once strongly
roused in her, might leave him to all the
misery of utter helplessness. -
When Cesario heard that none but
voluntary obligations tied her to this un-
reasonable and thankless person, and saw
that she gently persevered, even in the
midst of tears wrung from her by his un-
just displeasure, he could not but admire

the Christian spirit which thus conquered
matural disgust and lawful indignation,
in compassion to the mental and bodily
infirmities of old age under affliction.
Not long after Cesario's nearer obser-
vation of Zeila, a fire broke out in that
quarter of Lydia's store-houses, where
her male slaves were lodged; it hap-
pened in the night, and but for the
prompt activity of Cesario, who directed
others how to render assistance, and gave
it himself, at the imminent risk of his
life, the whole suite of buildings must
have been consumed, and many lives lost.
Some slaves had been laboriously pre-
paring a cargo late the preceding
night, for a ship that was to sail the
next day, and, over-wearied, did not ob-
serve that they had left a lamp burning
near some sheets of matting. Some ac-
cident of wind, or perhaps the falling of
these mats within reach of the flame of
the lamp, caused them to take fire, and
other light materials catching, soon com-

municated to the quarter where the oils
and pitch were kept: the blaze then
became terrific. Cesario, who saw it
through the olive-woods, from the lattice
of his chamber where he sat reading,
flew to render assistance. His presence
and courage restored their faculties to
the bewildered multitude, who were sur.
rounding their shrieking mistress, inca-
pable of attending to her entreaties that
they would preserve her from utter ruin.
He instructed them what to do, to
hinder the fire from spreading to the
dwelling-house; and, exhorting them to
continue the means already using, he
mounted the flaming walls of the ware-
house, to save the few persons there,
who were unable to escape without help.
Zeila, in common with all the house-
hold of Lydia, was amongst those who
witnessed the generous exertions of Ce-
sario; and, while she ardently ejaculated
a prayer for his preservation, she could
not forbear calling on the name of the

poor blind old man. His infirmity and
his fear had evidently prevented him from
finding the windows by which it was now
ascertained his fellow-sufferers had all sel-
fishly escaped. At Zeila's cry, Cesario
sprang from the ladder on which he was
standing, direct into the open window of
the dormitory: the poor terrified wretch
was raving at the other end of it; but
Cesario soon seized and bore him away.
When he leaped to the ground with his
aged burden from a lower wall on which
the ladder rested, he led him to Zeila,
and, placing the old man's palsied hands
in hers, he said kindly, “I give you one
happy moment, Zeila!” . . . . . .
Zeila answered only by a look, which,
for the instant, effaced every trace of
suffering from her withered cheek. —
Cesario felt the look enter his soul; but
he hurried away to finish his benevolent
duty. -
Happily the fire was finally extinguish-
ed with much less loss of property than

its owner dared to hope; and Lydia, sen-
sible that she owed this blessing to Ce-
sario's activity and courage, desired him
to say in what way she could show her
gratitude.
... He evaded reply at that moment; but
the next day, when he encountered Zeila,
he reminded her of Lydia's enquiry; and
besought her to say whether there were
any thing she desired for herself, which
his solicitation (thus invited) might
obtain. - -
With tears of mournful admiration
Zeila assured him that she was resigned
to her lot; but she noticed several minute
grievances of individuals amongst her
fellow-slaves, beseeching him in the name
of that humanity which seemed to be the
vital, principle of his soul, to plead to
Lydia for a removal of their hardships.
Old age and childhood were the chief
objects of Zeila's compassion; and Ce-
sario, while he looked with passionate
pity upon the condition of the generous

creature, who thus neglected her own
relief for the sake of lightening the bur-
dens of others; promised what she asked;
sought, and after some delay, obtained it.
From that period Cesario's observation
of Zeila, and interest in her fate, occu-
pied him incessantly : he had never, he
thought, pitied any one so much — never
seen any so deserving of pity. He forgot
that there were many of her fellow-slaves
equally worthy of compassion; but they
had neither touched his feelings by the
contrast of their manners and situation,
nor awakened his esteem by any visible
show of generous concern for each other.
Zeila, for her part, was for awhile trans-
formed into a new creature: she came
more frequently to the fountain; she
even loitered there, caressing Tamar's
children, and winning their little hearts
by decorating their uncovered heads and
arms with coronets and bracelets made of
berries and flowers. If Cesario joined
the sportive groupe, she yet remained;

proofs of interest in Cesario, and this

confidence.
: Cesario at first observed this to her;
but finding it continue, he receded in his
turn, and sought her no more.
... But though he sought her no more,
something (he knew not what) brought
him often where she was ; and then the
instant she saw him, she would start
away and vanish in the crowd of her toil-
ing companions. -
Once, however, when Cesario was sit-
ting in deep thought upon a fallen orna-
ment of the fountain, where Zeila had
been hastily getting water undisturbed
by him, he looked up and saw her whom
he fancied gone, lingering near the en-

trance-gate, and regarding him wistfully
and gratefully.
At meeting his eyes she swiftly turned
away, hers, with a blush of more than
modest confusion, of self-censure; and,
gliding through the gate, did not re-
appear before him for some days.
At length, accidentally crossing a nar-
row dell, late one evening, he espied her
on the overhanging bank of a stream
which ran through it.
Treading lightly upon the smooth turf,
which carpeted the ascent she was on, he
came up to her unawares.
She was standing with clasped hands,
gazing upon the water, as though
*
“She sighed, and envied every stone
Which peaceful at the bottom lay."
Never before had Cesario been so struck
with the perfect symmetry of her figure,
which gave grace and almost beauty to
the common foldings of her woollen veil:
but all ideas of admiration were lost in

the-more powerful sentiments of compas-
sion and concern, when he caught sight
of her face : its expression moved his
very soul. “So young, so sad, so hope-
less!” he said inwardly. -
He advanced too hastily; for Zeila,
uttering a shriek of surprise, tottered,
and fell down into the stream. Cesario
was not an instant in leaping after her,
5 and carrying her through the shallow
rivulet to the flat ground on the opposite
! bank. . .
She was somewhat stunned by the fall;
and her head coming first into the water
had got completely wet. As Cesario sat
down under some myrtles, and supported
her on his breast, he officiously wiped
the long locks of her discomposed hair:
he was surprised to see the dull colour of
that hair transferred to his cloak (with
which he had rubbed it), leaving in its
place the hue he loved, because it was
that of Giovanni's, - - +

opened her half-closed lids, and, seeing
his eyes fixed upon her altered hair, she
blushed, and hastily gathered it up under
the veil which had dropped from her head
when she fell.
Without attempting to account for
this circumstance, she tried to break
from him; but she trembled so, through
excessive weakness and emotion, that
she was unable to resist the hand that
gently detained hers. '
“Why would you fly me?” asked
Cesario in Italian, with a voice of ten-
derest pity, and eyes so benevolently
kind, that their expression melted her at
once: “I would serve you, if it were
in my power: — tell me, are you an
Italian 2–I have been in Italy, and I
could perhaps assist—; if you have friends
there, perhaps they might be able to buy
your freedom, if they only knew > →
“ Might be able !” repeated Zeila,
raising her eyes with desperate appeal to
Heaven; “ oh yes! but they leave me to

perish here. Yet I have no right to
complain!” and she threw down her eyes
again, drowned in tears.
There was something inexpressibly
touching in the tone of her voice as well
as in her countenance. “What are your
kindred then 2 where are they 2” asked
Cesario, earnestly regarding her.
“I will never name them,” was Zeila's
allSWer. -
Cesario looked at her still more in-
tently: “They must be monsters, if
they know you are in captivity, and can
ransom you, and will not.”
“O, do not wrong them so P’ ex-
claimed Zeila, bursting into tears, and
trying once more to leave him.
Cesario grasped her trembling hand
more firmly : “I cannot let you leave
me, till you give me some clearer ac-
count of yourself. I do not ask this
from motives of vain curiosity: your
youth, your sex, your cruel sufferings
affect me; and if I could assist in restor-

ing you to your country, it would give
me true happiness. But I must know
your Italian name, and the circumstances
which placed you in this hard situation,
otherwise I can do nothing.” :
“And what are you, that offer thus P”
exclaimed Zeila, interrupting him with
a look of astonishment. Cesario's eyes
fell under the broad and noble light of
hers, which an expression at once grate-
ful, admiring, and expectant, rendered
almost dazzling. He felt that he had
committed himself by the indiscreet im-
petuosity with which he had spoken; and
the idea of Giovanni crossed him with
keen reproach: he was silent. -
Zeila gently withdrew her hand from
his now-slackened grasp, and, looking
earnestly at him, said in a low voice,—“I
see you have your secret, as well as I have
mine,” (and she pointed to her dis-
covered hair.). “Keep mine, as I shall
‘keep yours, and let us pray for each
other.”

The cloud of despair again obscured
her brow, and, waiting not reply, she va-
mished among the trees. .
It was impossible for Cesario to banish
this incident from his thoughts. In the
solitude of night, and the monotonous
self-imposed tasks of the day, it recurred
again and again; often stealing upon
those reveries about Giovanni, which had
hitherto occupied him to the exclusion
of every thing else. . . . . . .
When he recalled the pathetic beauty
of Zeila's eyes and voice, and the
unutterable charms which a strong emo-
tion spread over her whole coun-
tenance, in light, and colour, and ex-
pression, he was amazed to think she
should be devoted to such sordid em-
ployments as those she executed. . .
But what was the alternative P either

lutions of a Haram Cesario felt the

* “Happily,” he thought, “that beauty,
like the soft perfume of an expiring rose,
is too fine to attract the gross sense of men
rioting amongst excess of sweets. Even

The more he reflected upon her evi-
dent wish for utter concealment, from
the disguise of staining her hair, and her
avowed resolution of never declaring her.
Italian connections, the more it perplexed
him. He attempted a variety of solu-
tions of this mystery, but not one satis-
fied him; and only conscious of a most
ardent wish to serve one so helpless and
so deserted, he sought every opportunity
of finding her once more alone.
While seeking this, he came more fre-
quently into the grounds of Lydia; and
being therefore oftener among the slaves,
he heard but the more of Zeila.

They could only tell him, that she was
purchased by their mistress, out of a
Turkish corsair, three years before, with
a few other slaves, who were now dead,
or sold to a different owner. -
All her present companions in misery
described Zeila as kind and succouring
to each ; repeating, how often she had
abridged her own hours of rest and sleep
to attend a sick fellow-sufferer; and how
often she had worked till absolutely de-
prived of every bodily power, for the
sake of relieving some more infirm or
very aged slave from an oppressive task.
“We think she lives upon her tears,”
said one of these persons; “for she is
always weeping when alone; and though
she often seems fainting and famishing
long before sun-set, when our supper
comes, she just tastes her scanty portion,
and leaves it for some one else.”
No one could remember that they
had ever heard her mention the name of
her family, or the place she came from ;

so that Cesario got no further satisfaction
than a clearer view of her misery. . "
So cheaply purchased, and so little
esteemed by her mistress, he thought her
freedom would be procured at a rate
quite within the limits of his own means;
and anxious therefore to know how he
could dispose of her after her purchase;
anxious to have his deep interest in her
justified by her candid confidence, he
redoubled his efforts to find her alone
for a few moments. -
But Zeila avoided him again more
studiously than before; and Cesario, dis-
pirited by continued disappointment, was
often tempted to give the whole matter
up. -
Sometimes he felt unaccountably chafed
and mortified; and then he would re-
probate himself for wasting so much of
his thoughts upon one so strangely per-
verse. “I have no interest in serving
her,” he would say to himself, “I want
only to get her out of this destroying

situation — to save her life in short; and
after that, I should most likely never see
her again. But she opposes herself to
this common Christian feeling, as if she
fancied it, I know not what, — and hated
me — and I am wrong, therefore, to let
her occupy my thoughts, when I should
think of nothing but my Giovanni.”
Cesario was in no danger now, of mis-
taking gratified vanity for love.

CHAPTER XI.
AFTER having made this compact with
himself, Cesario absented himself from
his neighbour's grounds for many days;
and though he saw Zeila as usual come
for water to the fountain, he went on
with his mechanical employment without
offering to go and assist her.
If after just glancing at her unsteady
steps, he found her image still before his
mind's eye, he steadily drove it away,
and rivetted his thoughts upon his friend.
What new interest, indeed, could do
more than detach him at intervals from
this paramount concern ?
The progress of Mustapha seemed
drawn out to intolerable length : he was
heard of in Epirus, slowly approaching

the coast; but how accompanied, mone
could actually learn, till after his settle-
ment at Santa Maura. -
The days, the hours, the minutes,
seemed in Cesario's apprehension to grow
in their duration: his pulses were always
beating with a feverish tumult, occasioned
by increasing anxiety: expectation ever
excited, never gratified, and always
agitated by fear, consumed his strength
so rapidly, that he began to dread lest
it should entirely fail him before he got
within reach of Giovanni. At that time,
the perfect command both of his mind
and body might be essential to his en-
terprise. -
Reuben, the kind but cautious Reuben,
did not act with the rapidity Cesario
asked: he was so very guarded in all his
enquiries, so slow in his advances to
whatever object he sought to reach, and
must reach through hazard, that Ce-
sario sometimes accused him of imbecile
fear. -

Cesario was, in short, restless and dis-
turbed, -secretly at war with himself
for caring about any thing unconnected
with Giovanni; and even now and then
he determined to go alone to Santa
Maura, and learn surer intelligence. He
thought, also, that he should be happier
if removed from the mixed grief and
vexation of observing Zeila's misery,
since she shunned his sympathy: he
thought he needed no new suffering,
added to what tortured him on the score
of his friend. - - -
So determined did he believe himself,
to exclude this minor source of pain from
his harassed thoughts, that one day as he
saw her advancing to the fountain with
another woman, though he was then
drinking at it, he withdrew precipitately,
without assisting, or even addressing
her.
Restless and uneasy after this petu-
lent action, and quarrelling with himself
for yielding to such a humour, merely

because his benevolent intentions were
crossed a little, he could neither eat nor
sleep. He was ashamed of so savage a
proof of anger at conduct, from which
he had no right to draw hasty conclu-
sions. Zeila might have as powerful
and as honourable reasons for the con-
cealment of her name and character, as
he had ; why, then, should he resent her

Was he to be so easily checked in a

have allowed himself to be so affected?—
No | If he had done so in times long
past, where would have been their after
bond of soul?
Cesario blushed at his own impatience,
and resumed his visits to the gardens of
Lydia.
Not long after, he encountered Zeila
by chance.
A perturbed night, and the balmy
breathings of a peculiarly sweet morning,
had invited him out. He wandered from

the confined precincts of the valley into
the open olive-grounds of Lydia, and,
throwing himself under the shade of one
of the trees, yielded himself up to
thought.
Though his eyes were fixed upon the
snowy tops of the distant mountains in
the Morea, his sense took no note of
them, for the images of former happiness
and former suffering were passing before
him.
He thought of his father and of his
friend, of Toledo and Camilla, till his
heart melted with more than melancholy.
Often and deeply did he sigh, while he
lay shading his closed eyelids from the
increasing light of the risen sun; a sigh
heavier than his own, made him start and
look up.
He saw "eila momentarily supporting
herself against a tree, with her melan-
choly but lovely eyes fixed upon him.
She was even thinner and paler than
before, and seemed to have scarcely

strength enough to prevent herself from
sinking upon the earth.
What penetrating sweetness was in her
soft regards! — what a celestial colour
suddenly shot across her cheek! Cesario
sprang from his recumbent posture, and
advanced to meet her. He knew not what
he meant nor what he did; his senses were
all confusion until he found that he had
locked her trembling hands in both his,
and murmured he knew not what, of
kind reproach, and far kinder greeting.
“I thought you meant that we should
never meet again!” he exclaimed.
“I have been ill ; I am—I am still
ill,” was her faltering answer, as she
extricated herself from the ardent pres-
sure of his hands. * - .
Cesario gazed on her emotion with an
increasing pleasure, of the extent of which
he was unconscious. “You have been
ill; and we might, indeed, never have
seen each other again! Zeila, does my
interest in your fate displease you?—

will you not allow me to serve you if
I can 2 I cannot bear to see you thus
wearing out life in slavery: I think
I could gladly lay down my life —”
He stopt, embarrassed, agitated, troubled,
self-betrayed.
If Zeila had been indifferent to him,
she could not have mistaken the senti-
ment of which, as yet, Cesario himself
was not quite sensible, but which spoke
distinctly in his tremulous lips and voice.
Her overwhelmed eyes sunk under the ex-
pression of his ; but, quickly awakening
from that dream of an instant, she averted
her face, and moved a few steps from
him.
During the silence which followed,
Cesario was discovering with consterna-
tion the real nature of his interest in
her; and Zeila was heroically resolving
upon the probable sacrifice of that inter-
est, in justice to him, and severe retribu-
tion of her own errors.
“At this early hour,” she said, “we

are not likely to be interrupted: it is
my hour for peacefully breathing the
reviving breath of these balmy shrubs.
You pity me—you think me more worthy
of that pity than I am in fact. I would
give much to preserve—to deserve that
pity and esteem; but I will not steal,
them.” ... " - - -
A sigh burst out with the last words,
and she looked down. -
Cesario's heart stopped in his breast:
it throbbed again with the arlarming
question, “Could she be conscious of
not deserving pity!” But mastering his
extreme emotion, he retook her hand,
and said in an earnest voice, “If you
trust me at all, be entirely sincere with
me! In the name of our blessed. Re-
deemer, I ask it.” - , 2
Cesario was not conscious of the last
adjuration; and he did not therefore un-
derstand the delightful surprise which
illuminated Zeila's face at this discovery
of his Christian faith: without noticing

it to him, she returned her dewy eyes
downwards, and began. ". -
“I must not tell you the name of my
family, for I have justly forfeited their
affection, and they have been, perhaps, but
rigidly just to me. My sad history is short,
for my life has not been long : I have not
lived nineteen years; and yet I feel as
if an age had passed since my first days
of childish rashness | - .
“My mother died during my infancy;
my father did not conciliate my affection;
and I had but a brother several years
older than myself—but a brother so dear,
so amiable, so incomparable!—O can he
have forgotten me?—can he never have
forgiven me?” - * *
“And where is this brother?” asked:

“Alas, I know not!—perhaps no
longer in the world,” replied Zeila, her.
eyes surcharged with tears. “He became
one of a military order; and then he was
almost entirely removed from me.”

“Of a military order!” repeated Ce-
sario; “ was he ” He stopped, and
eagerly running over her whole person
with his eyes, turned them hastily away
again, bidding her in scarcely articulate
words proceed. . . . . . .
“It was my father's will that I should
marry,” resumed the faltering Zeila,
“ and he chose for my husband a man
more revolting in person, manners, and
acknowledged character, than any de-
scription can realise. I was but fourteen

tion to win a more experienced heart
than mine. Yet I fancied I only yielded

him, and abhorrence of my intended.

wrath was childishly great; my lover's
persuasions were incessant; alarm, pity,
gratitude, ignorance of myself and others,
all assailed me. I had no female friend or
relation to advise me; my brother was

away, and time pressing. In an evil
hour I fled with my lover, and became
his wife.”
As Zeila covered her burning and
tearful face with her hands, Cesario un-
consciously covered his. The agitating
imagination which had struck him at
first, seemed now almost confirmed; and
a confused expression of horror at the
conviction of her belonging to another,
and of joy at her probable relationship to
Giovanni, locked up his power of speech.
At last, fixing his mournful eyes upon
her violently-trembling figure, he said in
a suppressed voice, “You are married,
then P” -
A frightful stillness had succeeded to
that tumult of hopes and fears and un-
defined wishes with which he had listened
to the first part of Zeila's narrative; and
he now drew involuntarily back.
Zeila removed her hands, and looked
on him with eyes in which her whole
distracted soul was painted,—“Oh, you

any extenuation for an act of rebellion

straints of her sex I was culpable; I
confess it, I deplore it daily at the foot

every solitary hour. Heaven did not
let me go unpunished: my father would
never see me again; my husband would
not permit me to seek the mediation of
my distant brother; and the character of
that husband gradually withered all my
hopes in life.
“I have suffered much, kind stranger,”
she added, her brow contracting, and
her cheek turning icy gray. “Think
you that five years, divided between
blighted expectations and bitter suffer-
ings, with repentant penances all that
time, may blot out the transgression of

feelings. Her deep contrition, her pre-

sent situation, the increasing conviction
that she was the long-lost sister of Gio-
vanni; and the idea that, but for her
imprudent marriage he might have be-
come connected with that precious friend
by the nearest ties; the certainty that
she could now never be his ; all these
feelings warred in his breast and on his
countenance. He sighed repeatedly, be-
tween every sigh murmuring some inar-
ticulate expressions of a consoling kind.
Zeila's beautiful features took a sadder
expression. “Alas, all other assurances
are vain : —if my brother deems my
fault unpardonable, it is so: and could
he have forgiven me, would he have suf-
fered me to languish in this wretched
condition ?” -
Cesario was about to utter some hasty
exclamation that would at once have de-
clared his knowledge of Zeila's family;
but checking himself, he enquired in a
hurried voice, how her brother knew of

her situation, and by what means she had
fallen into it?
“My husband had an unsteady tem- ,
per,” she replied, keeping her humbled
eyes fixed upon the ground, and replying
to Cesario's last question: “so, instead
of embarking for France at the usual
sea-port of the Italian State we were in,
he chose, two years after our marriage,
to journey along the coast; there we
were surprised, one luckless night, by a
descent of Turkish pirates, and carried
off with all the young and healthy of the
village where we were sleeping. O
that night of horror! O the days and
mights of yet greater horror which fol-
lowed it! — On the deck of the corsair,

band made fierce resistance and 3 ×

Cesario was unconscious of the vague
expectation (for it must not be called
hope) which now convulsed his heart,

but he drew closer to her : Zeila, per-
haps, read the anxious meaning of his
fixed look, for making a strong effort to
conclude, she gasped out, “I saw him
cut down at my feet!”
Had not Cesario mastered himself, and
drawn hastily back, he must have clasped
her to his breast in the transport of that
moment: happily he had acquired the
habit of commanding his sudden impulses,
and he now only turned on her a look of
fondest compassion,--" And thou, Zeila,
— so young, so lovely, -left defenceless
in such hands — what became of thee?”
A blush, which restored its earliest
beauty to the face he fixed that gaze
on, prefaced the reply of Zeila: that blush
belonged to the feelings his tender look
had awakened; those she had to describe,
were such as blanch the cheek and ice
the heart.
“They did talk to me of my beauty P’
she replied; “and it threatened me with
too many horrors for me to doubt it then:

he saw in the expression of that thrilling

Zeila resumed in a low and embarras-
sed voice:—“The agonies of my mind
soon brought on agonies of body, which
happily caused the death of the infant to
which I had once looked for all my hap-
piness on earth. I could not wish that
my child should live a slave — an impious
Mahometan perhaps! — O no – I blest
the awful Hand that withdrew its un-
spotted soul! I recovered life; but I was
determined never to recover what was to

ness, and the resolution of merely sup-
porting existence, not nourishing myself
into strength and health, changed me en-
tirely: I was seen, and scorned at Con-
stantinople; and brought hither with the
refuse of the prize, to become the pro-
perty of my present mistress. Oblessed
loss of what I never greatly prized!—
These hollow, faded cheeks, these wasted
limbs, have preserved my soul from worse
than death. I shall at least die, Gio-
vanni, without having become the thing
you would shrink from P’
“Giovanni!” echoed Cesario, in a
tone which Amadea (for it was she)
could not comprehend, but which went
to her inmost soul; and he sank at her
feet overpowered by joy.
Amadea raised him with a bewildered
air. “What means this extreme emo-
tion?” she asked; “ you repeat the name
which has escaped me: it is my bro-
ther's. Ask me not to complete it with
- that of our family.” --

, “I will ask you nothing — wish mo-
thing more l’” repeated Cesario, in a
delirium of fast-kindling love and hope
and admiration; “I now comprehend
all your mysteries — that discoloured
hair and skin—that severe abstinence—
that incessant toil—that studious expo-
sure to the disfiguring effects of heat and
cold;—all these have but one object—to
preserve the spirit spotless, though at the
expense of its beauteous temple!— And
thou hast shunned me, Amadea —”
“Amadea!” shrieked his amazed com-
panion, catching his arm with both her
hands, and eagerly looking in his face
with a preposterous expectation—“O
no!—no — his eyes were heavenly
blue !” — She sank back upon the bank
in an agony of disappointment.
Cesario could no longer master his im-
petuous feelings. “It is not Giovanni
that you see before you,” he exclaimed,
throwing himself again at her feet, and
seizing her hand which he covered with
kisses; “but it is his friend—the friend

who will redeem you both, or perish
himself.”
The last expression was caught by
Amadea, whose ardent enquiry extorted
a confirmation of the fear it excited: so
that with the joy of knowing her brother
lived, and had fondly sought her; and
that the only being she could cling to for
life was his friend, came the over-poising
knowledge of his captivity: Perhaps
mercifully came ; for how else could
Amadea have borne the shock of so much
happiness? -
At the information of her father's
death she wept bitterly, for Cesario could
not tell her she had been forgiven;
but the certainty that Giovanni had never
received the only account she had ever
been able to send him of her situation,
consoled and encouraged her. She had
written to her brother by a released Chris-
tian, who had promised faithfully to
transmit her letter to him at Malta; but
whether his absence from that island, or
the forgetfulness of the bearer, had been

to blame, Cesario knew not ; he could
only assure Amadea that no information .
of her existence had ever reached her
relations. - -
The loud bell which called the slaves
of Lydia from their beds, now began to
ring; Amadea started with habitual fear.
“We must part,” she cried.
“ Part,” repeated Cesario, “ and I
have so much to say to you!—Where can
we meet again at this hour, at any hour?
You have shown me your heart, Amadea,
and I would make you a confession of
mine : I, too, would not steal esteem
and confidence; and though your brother
has pardoned and restored me to his
friendship, his dearer sister perhaps 35
Cesario stopt confused, faltering. The
eyes of Amadea met his at that moment:
all her joyfully surprised heart was in
them ; that heart which had really never
loved before, but which dreaded the sen-
timent, yet felt at this instant its fullest
power.

Cesario dared not reply to those speak-
ing eyes: he averted his kindling face,
and giving her hand a fluttering pressure,
repeated his enquiry of where and when
she would meet him the next day?
“ At this hour, in this place,” she
whispered, and withdrawing her hand,
they severally and hastily retreated.
Cesario retired from her into the soli-
tude of his own apartment in Reuben’s
house; there he endeavoured to calm
the turbulent yet delightful agitation of
his mind.
What a view of Paradise was opened
to him 2 Dare he hope to enter there 2–
or were those radiant gates to close and
shut him out for ever ? The bare possi-
bility of being instrumental to the release
both of Giovanni and of Amadea, and
the dearer hope of attaching her to his
fate by the most sacred bonds, was po-
sitive happiness to him. He knew not
that he could bear greater happiness at
that moment.

His thoughts rapidly took in the full
extent of the blessings now promised
him, as well as the retrospect of the
awful events, by which he had been led
to this bright point. The impression
such reflections made on him was inef-
faceable.
It seemed the very hand of Providence
leading him to the summit of earthly de-
sires; and as such he would not allow
himself to question the events of the
future. Of Amadea's surprised feelings
he could not retain a rational doubt;
for when she heard from his own lips
the assurance of his being, what she in
some degree suspected, far other than he
seemed, her heart had escaped its bonds,
love, gratitude, and rapture lightning
from her eyes. Cesario's beating heart
had responded to those thrilling eyes;
and now, while in idea he met their beam
again, he felt the dear conviction that
when he dare seek her love, he would
not fear to sue in vain.

248 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
But where were now his soberer visions
of peace and friendship only? Not three
months since, he had believed it impos-
sible for anything to turn him back to
the world from Giovanni and the Order
of St. John.
Cesario would have blushed at his own
instability, had he not found a ready,
and perhaps sufficient excuse, in the cir-
cumstances under which he had first
known Amadea, and in his subsequent
discovery of her relationship to Giovanni.
By winning her affections, and eventually
making her his wife, he was fulfilling
the earliest, though at that time fruitless,
wishes of her brother; and though the
vows of his Order must still attach Gio-
vanni to its self-denying laws, Cesario
could imagine several allowable means by
which the society of that inestimable
friend might be nearly always secured to
him. -
Cesario saw nothing at this moment
but the future arrayed in smiles. His
mind, indeed, was in such pleasurable

disorder, that it was long before his
views for Amadea could assume a fixed
shape. - -
… At last he came to the resolution of
partially confiding this new secret to
Reuben ; confessing that he had found
in Zeila, one whose relatives he knew in
Italy, and for the sake of whom he
-wished to obtain her freedom. A small
sum (and with a great one, for another
emergency, he was secretly provided by
La Valette,) would most likely purchase
her from her present owner, as if to
share the household duties of Tamar;
after which they must seize some op-
portunity of transmitting her to Italy.
The attachment of Tamar’s children
to Amadea, would afford Reuben a plau-
sible pretext for selecting her as an assist-
ant to his daughter; and his increasing
success in the retail of his trade would
prevent any surprise at his attempting so
slight a purchase. -

Whatever might be the event of Ce-
sario's attempt to liberate Giovanni, he
yet hoped that Amadea would owe her
recovery of life’s best blessing to him.
But, though he felt, that not even Ama-
dea could reconcile him to life, if her
brother were lost to them, he could not
forbear acknowledging, that if, after the
recital of his infatuated bondage to Bea-
trice, and the confession of his struggling
fortunes, she seemed undismayed at the
prospect of trusting her happiness to him,
he should be unable to wait for Gio-
vanni's permission to secure the promise
of her affection. -
Perhaps Cesario felt at this instant
how completely Providence had humbled
his once proud spirit. He must receive
from Giovanni, not only forgiveness, but
the chief blessing of his life — from Gi-
ovanni, whom he had first spurned, and
then insulted — and he was now obliged
to seek the freedom of that injured friend,
not by the honourable paths of open

sordid society and ignoble artifice
“Ah well ! I have deserved it all —
more than all !” he said to himself; |
“ and if a merciful Providence grants me
his liberty, by any mode which is not
really degrading, I shall have escaped
unpunished.” -
Amadea, meanwhile, felt as though she
were awaked in a new world. Even
hope had been so long banished from her
thoughts, that any thing like happiness
was admitted with astonishment. She
had believed herself an outcast from
home and from Heaven: and her own
disciplined mind had so severely con-
demned her only fault, and never-sleep-
ing reflection had so distinctly marked
every moment of her slavery since, that
time seemed lengthened by it. Thus, in
the spring of life, she felt as if she were
reaching the term of existence, and all
earthly prospects closing: now, she was
wafted back to the starting point of

youth and hope, with love and felicity
for her goal!
Could it be possible ! (she thought).
Was she, who had resigned herself with
penitent submission to withered affections
and a suffering life, to become, after all,
the centre of domestic love, bestowing
as much happiness as she received 2 Was
she ever to look round on beauteous
creation, and feel that it made a part of
thatsoul's enjoyments, which forthreelong
years had considered its joyous charms as
mockery? Was she ever to be reinstated in
her own respect, by knowing herself be-
loved and respected by the most estimable
amongst mankind 2 Was she, in short, to
bless the severe dispensation which had
disciplined her into a perfect knowledge
of the value of all those blessings, which,
long withheld, were eventually to be
bestowed upon her ? *
Amadea, the long-suffering, self-con-
demning Amadea, dared not believe it.

Oh, how incredulous are they of hap-
piness, who have known only sorrow !
Suffering seems to them the natural
order of things; and every thing de-
lightful, but passing phenomena.
When Cesario's purely humane atten-
tions to her had shed its first balmy
drop upon Amadea's heart, she thought
but of gratitude; eagerly admitting the
long-estranged feeling of a kindly glow
for her species: but no sooner had his
generous contempt of his own life at the
period of the fire, kindled a livelier ad-
miration in her, and their subsequent
intercourse taught her to suspect the
nature of this feeling, than, starting at
herself, she fled from all indulgence of
so dangerous a sentiment.
Love would have been interdicted to
her by her own severe self judgment,
even amid scenes of peace and equality;
how much more so, therefore, in her pre-
sent degraded state, and when its object
was in a rank so far below hers!

Amadea's solitary heart had silently
and imperceptibly kindled into an un-
quenchable flame by repeated glows of
virtuous admiration: Cesario's singularly
beautiful person might have passed her
unnoticed ; nay, his peculiar assiduity
about herself might only have excited

gratitude; but his active benevolence to
others was not to be contemplated with
moderate emotion : that, seized her soul
with sweet surprise; opening to her an
unsuspected source of pleasure, in the
observation of its exercise, and the con-
templation of its effects.
Dangerous, dangerous pleasure less
dreaded, yet far more destructive than
all the reveries of which outward graces
only, or proofs of preference, are the
objects! What it seems virtue to love,
prudence can scarcely withhold us from
lowing: and as Amadea observed or list-
ened to the numberless proofs of Cesario's
gracious and succouring spirit to all
within its influence, she felt that nothing
could ennoble him more in her eyes;
though the duty she owed her family,
even while deserting her, or unconscious
of her protracted existence, her appre-
hensive mind believed must ever place
a bar between their fates.
This just conviction of the obligation

imposed on her by disparity of birth,
might not, perhaps, have been able to
stand against the continued influence of
manners which made that disparity be
forgotten, united to obvious assiduities
or persuasive pleadings, had Cesario pur-
sued either mode of winning her: but
Cesario's sensibility was so alive to the
slightest repulse, and so abhorrent of
persecuting the thing he loved, that he
unconsciously armed her with weapons to
resist her own heart.
When she saw, that he shunned her
in his turn, that delicate apprehensive-
ness which distinguishes the love of
woman, made Amadea start at the pos-
sibility of her having mistaken pity for a
tenderer interest: it is for man to pursue
and win; woman relinquishes and re-
cedes. Thus, when Amadea loved Ce-
sario best, she shunned him most. But
Cesario guessed it not ; and when her
laudable combat with an alarming feeling
made her assume an air of coldness, he

was far from imagining how many wounds
his proud neglect inflicted on her already
bleeding heart.
Overlooking the surer guide of com-
paring her conduct with his own, and
thence guessing at the motive which
dictated its seeming caprice, Cesario had
at first looked for such proofs of attach-
ment as he had formerly received from
Beatrice; and not finding these, he fan-
cied himself disregarded; but as other
agitating feelings threw Amadea's heart
into disorder, and the joy of that tender
heart at the discovery of his real cha-
racter escaped from her eyes, so perfect
and so delightful was the conviction it
brought, of all that he then was to her,
and all that he might yet be of dearer
and more esteemed, that he felt he had
never before known the prospect of per-
fect happiness.

CHAPTER XII.
CesARIo and Amadea met the next
morning, with . that strange embarrass-
ment which is inseparable from strong
attachment: the former hastened to con-
quer it, by immediately commencing the
history of his friendship with Giovanni.
While Amadealistened to this interest-
ing history, she yielded herself up to the
dear consciousness of sympathy with Ce-
sario: her tender remembrance of Gio-
vanni when she was only a child, was
exalted by admiration and gratitude for
his goodness to the man she now identified
with herself. Delicious tears rained from
her eyes; while those rivetted eyes, unable
to avert themselves from the face of him
who partook in all her feelings, seemed at

once to ask and to promise every thing
which respectful love could desire.
Amadea's crimsoned cheek reflected
the raised colour of Cesario’s, when he
hurried over the torturing avowal of his
passion for Beatrice Brignoletti, and the
madness into which it had transported
him : her heart throbbed intolerably: it
was not jealousy which made it beat; she
did Cesario justice, and believed him in-
capable of retaining one lingering feeling
for a creature so unworthy. She only
grieved that his noble heart should ever
have been the sport of such an incon-
stant; and in proportion to her pity for
him, was her indignant contempt of the
woman who had severed such holy friend-
ship as that between him and Giovanni.
It was impossible for Cesario to go
over the details of this infatuation, and
describe the revolution of feeling which
so quickly followed, without endeavouring
to convince Amadea and himself, that he
had indeed been under the influence of a

spell. He wished to believe that he had
never truly loved till he knew her; and
this belief, at first insinuated, was at last
told by him with ingenuous earnestness.
He followed up this involuntary de-
claration by a hasty sketch of his views
for her transfer from Lydia; and, in case
she should bless his wishes, of his plan for
her removal to Malta; there to await his
arrival with Giovanni, of whose escape
he would not allow her or himself to en-
tertain a single doubt. - - -
What became of Amadea at this mo-
ment? So long miserable !— so long
as if abandoned by Heaven and earth —
so wildly-doubtful of what she wished
—so transported with the sudden view of
all which this affection offered her — her
liberty, her country, her brother —How
was she to master so many struggling
feelings? -
Was it a violation of woman’s best
character, that, instead of a faint and
regulated approval, she cast upon Cesario

aglance full of her consenting, transported
soul, and sank insensible into his arms 2
Cesario indulged himself for an instant
in gazing upon those perfect features,
which only too much happiness had
fixed in temporary insensibility: his eye
glanced, and withdrew directly from that
alabaster throat, which, in his eager at-
tempts at freeing her respiration, he had
partially uncovered ; and his imagination
could not but paint her such as he hoped
one day to see her, when no longer
obliged to stain that snowy skin and
sunny hair which proved her kindred to
Giovanni. -
While he gazed on her, he imagined

happiness, those touching and tearful.
eyes smiling with security of every dear
possession; and though the image his
fancy presented was bright and fair, he
could not help pressing her now-different
form against his breast, fondly exclaim-
ing, “Yet it will not be this Amadea!”

Cesario knew not, that a heart truly
attached, accommodates itself to every
personal change in its object: let the eyes
we love, ever express the same tender-
ness and the same qualities as when they
first charmed us; and, whether they
brighten or grow dim, we shall still joy to
meet them, still think them unchanged
A short time restored Amadea to her-
self, and then her grateful tenderness
showed itself in blushes and tears.
Cesario's plans for her and for Gio-
vanni were more amply discussed; when
it was settled that he should immediately
set about negociating her purchase.
When he mentioned the necessity of
her subsequent removal to a place be-
yond reach of Turkish power, he observed
her countenance change ; but she op-
posed no resistance : reason was con-
vinced, though her heart trembled.
Might she have gone where Cesario
went, she would have found herself
beyond danger; but to encounter the

perils of the sea alone, to incur the pos-
sibility of being again captured!—theidea
was alarming; but as there was no al- -
ternative, and as Giovanni's escape made
up half her dearest hopes, she stifled th
expression of her reluctance. .
... They parted at the morning bell.
After this interview, Cesario's measures
were prompt. Reuben made the appli-
cation to Lydia, prefacing his subject by
remarks upon the increasing fatigues of
his daughter, and the consequent neces-
sity of her being supplied with an as-
sistant.
He thanked Heaven that his own in-
dustry was so far blessed, that he might
now afford this help to Tamar; and
therefore as Zeila had acquired some
power over his volatile grand-children
by her occasional caresses; and, as she
could not be very valuable to her mis-
tress, he wished to know whether her
price would be within his poor ability.

º
264 THE KNIGHT OF ST. John.
Lydia did not rate Zeila as low as
Reuben expected; and with habitual
parsimony refusing to give what she
demanded, he broke off the negociation.
Cesario's anguish and disappointment,
when he heard this, almost hurried him
into an imprudence which might have
proved fatal to his hopes, by awakening
some suspicion of Zeila's original con-
dition, and the present power and will
of her friends to bid high for her liberty.
Reuben bowed under the passing storm;
and when it was over, offered to repair
his fault immediately. -
Cesario took him at his word ; and
Reuben inwardly lamenting that so much
good gold should be given for so good-
for-little a slave, returned to Lydia, bar-
gained with her awhile, and at last pur-
chased Zeila. -
When Cesario first beheld Amadea
under the same roof with the placid and
kind Tamar, even the presence of the

latter could hardly restrain him from
uttering the grateful joy of his heart.
Amadea spoke to him only with her
eyes; but how much did they say as she
stood in the vine-trelliced porch of their
little dwelling, surrounded by the chil-
dren all clambering round her with
boisterous fondness!
From that moment her health and
spirits rapidly changed: Youth’s heart
and health are so elastic | The tasks
Tamar required of her were few and
light: to share her maternal cares, to
attend their bees, and prepare the simple
meals of Reuben and Cesario, were all
her occupations. - .
Amadea performed these with delight:
she loved children; and the humblest
duty had a charm for her, when it was
to administer to the refreshment of him
for whose sake all things were welcome.
Often, as she gave and he received
the homied cakes kneaded by her hand,
their eyes would meet with the same

smile at their mutual and temporary de-
gradation. - . . . . .
Thus, in daily and undisturbed inter-
course, their hearts became more inti-
mately known to each other. In the
general character of tender and noble
qualities, their mutual sympathy was
already evident; but it is only by hourly
intercourse, by seeing each other at every
careless instant, by catching a look, a
word, a movement, when the mind is off
its guard, and circumstances of small or
great moment arise unforeseen, that we
can discover the dearest, because the

ficient difference between them to mark
their individuality; for had Cesario been
less impetuous, or Amadea less timid,
they must have loved their absolute selves
in each other. -
Amadea dared not throw aside the dis-
guise of her hair and skin; but in spite

of this disguise her beauty was breaking
like morning through the clouds. The
kindling blushes of health and hope and
joy irradiated even that stained com-
plexion; and her ivory arms, from which
Cesario sometimes stole aside the thick
foldings of their covering, were assuming
the roundness and polish of their natural
symmetry. -
In that sweet serenity and fulness of
happiness, with which her eyes now met
his more agitated because more impas-
sioned gaze, he fancied they resembled
her brother's: their light was softer per-
haps, for even Friendship has not so
touching a look as Love!—but still they
resembled Giovanni's in colour and in
shape; and the deep sadness which had
once made them almost afflicting eyes,
was gone!—ah! was it gone for ever ?
Cesario sometimes asked himself that
question, when tortured by varying news
from Santa Maura, and crossed by a sud-
den pang of apprehension. He was now
almost the happiest of men : Giovan-

ni's release would make him completely
so; then how dare he expect so match-
less a destiny?
If present blessings were to be the
warrant for expectation of bliss in the
future, if interwoven hearts were to be
so, why were the hearts of Camilla and
Toledo broken 2 Why was their perfect
happiness shattered by the awful bolt of
Heaven 2 -
Cesario durst not dwell upon these dread
imaginings; and, hastening to banish
them by other images, one moment when
they crossed him, he took up a volume
of his native poet; his eye fell upon
those beautiful lines, –
— “For I have seen
The thorn frown rudely all the winter long,
And after bear the rose upon its top;
And bark, that all her way across the sea
Ran straight and speedy, perish at the last,
Een in the haven's mouth.” -

treme emotion, has not felt the influence

of superstition? Cesario shivered at the
omen, and throwing away the book, went
with a disturbed and boding soul to har-
dier employments.
He had scarcely commenced them,
when Reuben appeared: the latter beck-
oning him from his few associates, led
him under the deep shade of an old
chesnut-grove skirting the field of the
fountain.
He had to inform Cesario, that the
brother-in-law of Tamar, a hardy young
man who carried on an illicit trade be-
tween the islands and Sicily, was then
with his vessel in an obscure creek on the
least-frequented shore of Zante. Reu-
ben was certain this man would under-
take, for a proper recompense, to convey
Amadea to Malta itself. -
Nicolai (so this person was called) re-
sided in Maganesi, one of the petty islets
off Santa Maura; and he had brought
intelligence of the Basha's arrival there
with a large suite. - -- *

Maura; and if her recovered beauty
should strike the eye, or come to the ear
of any Turkish tyrant, during their ab-
sence, Cesario knew there was no power
that could preserve her. .
What was he to do? He durst not

her safely landed, and return again; for
* in that time (a period perhaps infinitely
prolonged by the casualties of weather,
or the necessary precautions of their
desperate captain,) Giovanni might be
lost. A captive's life or liberty often
turns upon the event of an instant: it
was therefore Cesario's duty to risk
much, trust Amadea to Providence, and
pursue his chief aim, the acquittal of his
debt of gratitude and repentance to her
brother. * * -
So great was his outward agitation dur.
ing this internal conflict, that Reuben
could not fail of noticing it. “My son,”
he said in a cautious, but kind voice, “I
see you have not quite trusted me, but
I don’t think the worse of you for it:-
I would have you prudent; it is the only
way to thrive. I see you love this young
damsel, and are afraid of trusting her
amongst a set of wild adventurers, as you
fancy Nicolai and his crew; but in truth
he is a good well-meaning fellow that

works hard for his wife and children,
and will not harm a hair of Zeila’s head;
provided you give him something before-
hand, and ensure him a tolerable reward
when he lands her in Malta. I’ll stake
my life on his honest dealing with you.”
“ I cannot, will not, must not trust
her in such hands!” exclaimed the im-
prudent Cesario, in an agony of indeci-
sion: he turned abruptly away, and took
several hasty steps up and down the
grove ; then, suddenly coming up again
to Reuben, he exclaimed, “ Reuben,
it is not above four–six days sail from
this to Malta; the weather is not bois-
terous for the season—Is there any con-
sideration that would tempt Tamar to go
along with Zeila P”
Reuben was too much struck with this
extraordinary proposal to reply instantly;
but after a little consideration, (during
which, it must be confessed, the prospect
of a liberal reward from Zeila's friends

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 273
in Malta had its full weight,) he con-
sented to discuss the subject.
It was then soon settled, that, provided
Tamar would freely consent, she was to
take her three children to give the thing
a colour; and, as if going to visit her
husband’s family in Maganesi, was to
embark with her brother-in-law, accom-
panied by her slave.
After landing Amadea, Nicolai was
then to proceed with his sister-in-law to
Maganesi, which circumstance would
afford an additional reason for Reuben’s
intended traffic at Santa Maura: by that
means, also, Cesario would be satisfied of
Amadea's safety. -
Many other advantages sprung out of
this scheme: by dispatching Amadea di-
rect to Malta, Cesario was enabled to
concert measures with the Grand Master
for facilitating the escape of Giovanni;
since it was necessary for the success of
his plan, that some light gallies of the
Order should be scattered about the

Ionian Sea, within his reach from Santa
Maura. - -
Undertaking to procure Tamar’s con-
sent to the proposed voyage, Reuben
went in search of her; while Cesario
hastened to impart their conversation to
Amadea, and learn whether she would
have the courage, now the moment of
trial came, to trust herself to the mercy
of winds and waves, and a band of un-
known Greeks.
As Cesario suspected, Amadea trembled
when the proposal was made to her: she
feared the chances of a voyage taken with
one of such desperate habits; and, believ-
ing Giovanni at Santa Maura, her heart
yearned to go where he was. For some
time her extreme agitation mocked all
effort to control or conceal it: she wept
violently on the supporting arm of Ce-
sario, whose manly frame trembled with
tender sympathy, and whose faltering
voice but ill seconded the arguments for

hope and resolution, which he tried to
urge on her. * .
:- At length, rousing herself, she said,
with a rainbow smile, “I should lové thee
little, my Cesario, if these tears did not
witness how much I suffer in parting
from thee; but I have no fears for my-
self—at least will not have — if Tamar
will go with me. O no, no,” she added,
more vehemently clasping her hands
together, “what shall I think of, for
whom shall I fear, except for thee and
our Giovanni?”
“Our Giovanni!” repeated Cesario,
in an exstacy at all that little pronoun
implied. -
Amadea faintly extricated herself from
his embrace. “When we meet again,”
she said, alluding to their reunior.

and, averting her fresh-streaming eyes,

trying hour. * >
Tamar’s consent was easily gained :
she had no fear of the sea, and with
amiable pride she wished to show her
children to the venerable parents of her
husband; besides which she loved the
gentle Zeila; and the liberal reward, of
which her father assured her, stimulated
her for her family’s sake to encounter
personal inconvenience. . .
The preparations of the different per-
sons were soon made ; so that by the
next morning’s dawn, Nicolai's little
bark, freighted with half Cesario’s soul,
shot from under the steep cliffs of Monte
Skopo upon her eventful errand.

seized with such a fearful presentiment,
that he would have given his life to have
recalled Amadea ; but the wish was
vain, and the presentiment only fancy;
and resolutely discarding such weakness,
he threw himself prostrate on the solitary
cliff, and there implored for her the pro-
tection of Heaven, and besought the
same divine blessing upon his own medi-
tated enterprise.

CHAPTER XIII.
The agitation and hurry of the ensuing
days gave a fortunate interruption to Ce-
sario's fearful thoughts about Amadea:
Reuben’s little vessel was launched and
freighted; and licensed by the Turkish
commandant, upon condition of paying
him one-third of the profits.
Reuben’s avowed object was Santa
Maura; where the arrival of its magni-
ficent governor, with a large suite of offi-
cers and women, made it a sure market
for the Indian and European rarities
which he confessed to have collected.
With this plausible pretext, he took
leave of his friends in Zante, consigning
his house and few remaining stores to the
care of a relation.

Embarking with Cesario, whose impa-
tient wishes the lagging wind would not
second, they set sail for the island to
which Sappho’s death has given such sad
celebrity.
The navigation of the islands, and the
dulness of the winds, made them very
soon entirely dependent upon their oars;
so that it was the middle of the third day
when they came in sight of the high
chalky shores of Santa Maura.
The less inviting rocks of Ithaca, which
they were then leaving behind, detained
Cesario's thoughts a moment from the
object of his greatest solicitude: he
seemed to hear the sacred lyre of Homer
sounding in the still morning air, match-
ing with its lofty strains the glorious
effects of the rising sun and the kindling
heavens. But the stream bore them on;
Ithaca receded; and four hours after-
wards, Reuben’s vessel was moored in the
road of Santa Maura. -
Cesario had experienced many agitat-

ing moments during his life, but he re-
membered none that exceeded the one in
which he landed on that shore. Never
before had he such a stake to throw for "
A re-union with Giovanni was the only
thing now wanting to make him the most
favoured of mortals. -
He followed the steps of Reuben in
silence ; who, as he led him towards the
busiest quarter of the town of Santa
Maura, pointed out, by significant looks,
unaccompanied by words, the splendid
seraglio or palace of the Basha.
Its magnificent accompaniments of
mosque and kiosk were mixed with the
verdure of the cypress and the cedar;
and the sound of music and laughter came
from its extensive gardens. Marbles, por-
phyries, and gildings glittered over the
long-extending front of the palace itself;
but the sight had no beauty in Cesario's
eyes, for it was the prison of his friend.
At the bazar Reuben encountered a
subordinate Turk whom he had known

in the service of Mustapha, when they
were in the Ottoman camp on Mount
Sceberras.
Seizing the happy chance, or rather
providence of this encounter, he saluted
Yusuf very humbly; and immediately
entering upon his long-practised romance,
of the severity and avarice of the Chris-
tians in his own case, obtained both hear-
ing and credence.
Cesario, who well knew his adroit com-
panion's mode of reaching any point he
aimed at, was prepared for what followed,
the instant this harangue began; and
consequently watched its progress with
seeming indifference, but real anxiety.
Reuben gave Yusuf's pithy description
of his flight from Malta great attention;
seasoning it with many gratifying excla-
mations, at all he had gone through dur-
ing the siege; (for human nature seems
to love superiority, even in suffering ;)
and having, by this means, secured
Yusuf's favour, he ventured to state his

present view in touching at Santa Maura;
which, he said, was to dispose of some ex-
ceeding choice merchandise, with the
profits of which he meant to purchase
other goods to complete the freight of
his vessel for the neutral port of Trieste.
If Yusuf had interest, therefore, to re-
commend him to any officer about the
Basha's own person, so that his rarities
might be shown in the seraglio, perhaps
His Excellency might purchase them for
the ladies of his haram; and in that case,
Reuben’s gratitude would not fail to tes-
tify itself in a substantial form to his
assisting friend. -
Yusuf swallowed the bait immediately;
and, promising to speak to the Basha's
hookha-bearer, whom he represented as
one high in favour from an extraordi-
nary power of amusing his master, he
instructed Reuben in what quarter of the
seraglio to enquire for him on the mor-
row, and took his leave. - *
Cesario saw him depart with inexpres-

sible disappointment; having in vain
waited to hear the name of Giovanni in-
troduced: he now reproached Reuben
with this culpable omission. Reuben
defended himself well ; he represented
the necessity of extreme caution; urging,
that had he made his entreaties to be ad-
mitted with his goods into the palace,
after having enquired about the prisoner
of whose liberty Mustapha was so jealous,
suspicion might have been excited.
“If I hear the details we want to-
morrow by chance,” he said, “it will
be still better; but if I do not, I will
wind round my questions about twenty
different persons, till I come, as if natu-
rally, to enquire what became of the
Christian knight after the death of Morad
Rais.” - -
Cesario yielded, with an ill grace, to
the necessity of this caution. He fancied
that when once he should know that
Giovanni lived, and was indeed in Santa

Maura, his spirit would regain calmness
and strength for every future difficulty.
He forgot how much more anxiety
that circumstance must excite in him, by
immediately opening to him a thousand
new cares, for the success of the different
stages of whatever plan he might adopt
for his friend’s release. - .
Reuben deemed it politic to remove
Cesario as much as possible from obser-
vation, lest his occasional fits of forget-
fulness, by altering his demeanour, (as
they had often done at Zante,) should
excite notice, and stimulate enquiry. He
therefore advised him to remain princi-
pally on board their vessel, as if in charge
of the cargo; and to come only occa-
sionally into the town, there to be in-
structed in its few details, — an ac-
quaintance with the topography of the
town, and indeed of the country round
it, being absolutely requisite, in case any
subsequent emergency should require
such knowledge from Cesario, -

As he threw his eyes across the ford-
able slip of sea, which merely cuts the
island off the main land; and thence
glanced at the deep woods and moun-
tainous ranges behind, he imagined, for
an instant, himself and Giovanni fording
that narrow strait, and vanishing from
pursuit amongst those pathless recesses.
“O that it were come to that!” throbbed
his busy heart; and he turned away, to
pursue his observation of other means.
Having accompanied his agitated com-
panion in the circuit of the city, and se-
cured to himself a lodging on shore, for
the greater facility of selling his goods
and making purchases, Reuben saw Ce-
sario into the boat, which was to recon-
duct him to the ship, faithfully promising
to bring him some satisfactory intelligence
upon the morrow.
The perturbed night which intervened
between this period and that morrow
was spent by Cesario in restless action.
He walked the deck that whole night,

alternately thinking of Amadea and of
Giovanni. . . . . -
So lately all confidence, he was now
all apprehension, — a tender heart is so
variable in its hopes and fears! Every
blast which rushed down from the steep
shores, and swept the dark stretch of
ocean, shook his heart also: on those
viewless wings the fate of Amadea might
be passing over him Then he turned his
eyes towards that part of the island,
where stood the seraglio of the Basha;
and tracing, or fancying he traced, its
irregular outline above the shore, he said
to himself, -“I fancy Giovanni is there;
and, perhaps, he lies mouldering in some
Turkish grave P’ -
The idea was immediately followed by
a train of desponding thoughts, which
insensibly crowded on him one by one,
till hope was excluded. - -
Reuben found him in the middle of
the ensuing day, with all the marks of
this wretched night upon his coun-

tenance. The old man conversed awhile
with seeming earnestness amongst the
few mariners he found on the deck
where Cesario was still walking; then
slowly descending to the cabin, left the
latter to divine that he might follow.
Cesario was not an instant of doing so.
When Reuben saw him enter, and ad-
vance impatiently, he stepped behind
him and closed the door. “Be at peace,
my son!” he whispered; “your friend is
alive.” – “And here !” cried Cesario.
“Yes, here, — in the Basha's palace.”
Cesario fell upon the old man’s neck :
when after some instant's indulgence of
his impetuous joy, he arose again, he saw
tears on Reuben’s cheek: his gratitude
for this sympathy was as energetic in its
expression as his transport; but, hastily
interrupting himself, he demanded the
particulars of Giovanni's situation.
Reuben’s information had been ga-
thered, partly by chance, and partly by

cautious enquiries. He was not admitted
that day to the august presence of Oth-
man the Basha'shookha-bearer; he merely
obtained the prospect of such an honour.
Meanwhile, he made the most of his time
with Yusuf, who, in spite of Turkish ta-
citurnity, was to be courted into con-
versation.
Giovanni, he said, was at that moment
in the eastern end of the palace; he was
placed in a deep dungeon, under the
guard of sentinels relieved every second
hour. - - - -
The Basha, he added, had never yet
treated the Christian with the severity he
merited; contenting himself with the
pleasure of now and then visiting him,
and tantalizing him with hopes of libera-
tion, which the next day destroyed; —
often, indeed, tormenting him with in-
ventions of defeats and losses sustained
by the Christian powers. Mustapha es-
pecially prided himself upon the success
of one idea respecting the cause nearest

his prisoner's heart : he had boasted that
Malta had not been relieved; that it
was now in the hands of the Grand
Seignor, and that the Order of St. John
was therefore finally extirpated.
No one either dared or wished to con-
tradict this story when told to one of
the hated knights; and Giovanni, there-
fore, was left in the painful belief that
all he loved and honoured was indeed
destroyed.
How he bore this bitter conviction,
Yusuf could not tell, nor did he care;
he only knew that the Basha scrupulously
fulfilled his promise to his nephew, of
preserving Giovanni in life, by allowing
him all its vulgar comforts of food and
clothing; but air he breathed only at
night on the terraced roof of part of the
seraglio, where a range of cypresses,
towering from the court below, shrouded
him with their tall heads from obser-
vation.

during his walk, and guards conducting
him to and from his dungeon, rendered
all approach to him by that mode, com-
pletely desperate. . . .
Recreation he had none. Neither
books nor writing implements were al-
lowed him; and he never, conversed
with human being, except when Mus-
tapha himself, or his jesting Tartar,
commissioned to mock him, came with
invented tales of Turkish triumph over
Christian valour. - -
What, then, were Giovanni's occupa-
tions? To make acquaintance with the
sound of winds and waves; to watch the
blasts of the former with an ear nicely
tuned by this habit to all their varie-
ties; and, as he listened to the roar
or murmur of the latter, to image in
fancy the distant shores which those
waves had washed; to think grate-
fully, yet mournfully, of the past; and
to turn his eyes in pious awe from the
interdicted future.

After a brief transport at the certainty
of his friend being still in life, Cesario
found there was no permanent duration of
that feeling for him, till he should have
placed Giovanni beyond the power of such
oppressors. He therefore, more earnestly
than ever, besought Reuben to enter
immediately upon their plan for his
friend’s liberation; to let no slight danger
deter him in the rapid prosecution of it;
nor any sum, within the large means of.
fered for that purpose by the brethren of
St. John, be deemed too immense.
Reuben’s feelings were now so much
interested in this business, that his pru-
dence was less likely to throw obstacles
in the way: he promised all Cesario
asked; and, soon returning to the city,
gave his whole thoughts to the interests
of his preserver and his preserver's friend.
Cesario, thus unavoidably left to his
own oppressive imaginations, missed the
salutary labour of which he was often
wearied in Zante. Through the day he

traversed the deck of the vessel, or
vainly tried to find occupation for him-
self in rowing singly along the steep
coast of Acarnania; and at night he
came to the town, where, after short
conference with Reuben on his daily
progress, he would steal to the precincts
of the seraglio, and there wander round
it like some -
“Lone, benighted wretch, shut out from lodging,
Whose sad groans are answered by whistling
winds.”
It was now mid winter, and all the
chain of Pindus on the opposite con-
timent was topped with snow: the wind
sounded with peculiar hollowness through
the multitude of leafless woods which
hang upon the skirts of that vast range;
and the waves, driven with violence
against the rocks of the coast, joined
their monotonous and dismal roarings to
the continued yelling of the storms.
Cesario's mind insensibly took the same

tone with the melancholy music of na-
ture; and, in spite of all for which he
had to be thankful to a gracious Provi-
dence, he felt despondence fast growing
upon him.
Sometimes, as he looked up to the
high tower on which he was told Gio-
vanni took his midnight walk, and saw
the sparkling stars and the deep-blue
sky shining through openings in the tall
heads of the cypresses, his melancholy
changed to momentary phrenzy, and he
was ready to attempt impossibilities, and
scale that impenetrable height, there at
once to perish by the side of his friend. .
Was it not torture to believe that
friend walking unconsciously above him;
perhaps, believing himself abandoned of
all he loved; while he, Cesario, who was
adventuring everything for his sake, was
only skreened from his sight by a few
trees, which a single axe could at any
moment level with the ground? . . .

. But it was not the momentary grati-
fication of his own sensibility that Cesa-
fio had to seek; and he was bound to
rein-in every impulse, which, if indulged,
might prove fatal to the success of those
plans upon which all his future happiness
depended. He therefore denied him-
self even this melancholy pleasure of
wandering near the prison of his friend,
whenever he felt his impatient or de-
sponding feelings becoming too, strong
for control.
Meanwhile, Reuben for several ensuing
days visited the palace of Mustapha;
and, though never admitted to his pre-
sence, offered him in succession, through
the medium of Othman, all those bro-
cades, and shawls, and European trinkets
which he had collected for that purpose.
In doing this, he wilfully prolonged
their different bargainings, and displayed
much obstimacy in his estimate of the
value of his goods: he did this for the

sake of becoming more intimate with the
talkative Tartar. i .
By dextrous use of these frequent op-
portunities, he was enabled to ascertain
the character of the man, and happily
found it one exactly suited to his purpose.

ornament with remarkable avidity for
money; and perhaps the last inclination.
is the natural fruit of the former : he
was good-tempered from insensibility;
credulous, and little disposed to calculate
remote danger, when present gratification
interposed. Great liveliness, a talent at
extempore tale-telling, and a collection
of burlesque songs, which he sang with
a buffoonery that marvellously delighted
his master, made him, in truth, a person
of all the consequence he was said to
possess. - } . .
By constant admission to the Basha in
his hours of relaxation, Othman had ac-
"quired a habit of familiar merriment
before him, which by degrees enabled

296 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN,
him to say and do things with impunity,
that would have cost another his head.
It was upon these qualities, and their
effects, that Reuben calculated for the
completion of his scheme. Whenever he
visited the seraglio, he took care to dis-
play some peculiarly gaudy article of
dress before Othman, who was as sure
to covet it, and bargain for its possession.
At first, Reuben resisted all attempts to
obtain it for a small sum, stating his
own reduced fortunes, and the certainty
of selling every valuable commodity for
its full worth ; then at last he would let
it go; jocosely blaming Othman’s amusing
talents, (which, to say the truth, were
indefatigable in the cause of his vanity,)
and assuring him that he would be his
poor merchant's ruin if he continued the
same importunities and pleasantries; he
relinquished first one costly article, and
then another, at half its marketable price.
By this means Reuben completely in-
gratiated himself with the vain Tartar;


## p. 297 (#307) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 297
and during their desultory conversations,
found occasions for frequently blaming
the folly of the Basha in preferring the
sterile gratification of shutting up a man
between four stone-walls, to the fruitful
possession of that tempting ransom, which,
when he was a prisoner at Malta, he knew
the Grand Master offered.
From joining in some lively censure of
his master, Othman came at length to the
point of wishing that Giovanni's prison-
door were in one of his hands, and the
bag of piastres in the other, “I’d open
both,” was his laughing remark.
“ And if there were another door to
open,” observed the wily Reuben, “I’d
follow your example, provided you would
give me part of the reward. Yes, yes,
my friend, after all, money is the prime
thing in this world.” And away went the
cautious Israelite to report these favour-
able signs to Cesario.
As he proceeded through the town, he
stopped occasionally to hurry the delivery

of certain commodities which he had or-.
dered to complete the cargo of his vessel;
and which he professed himself enabled
to purchase with the profits of his traffic
at the seraglio. . He was anxious to have
all his new property on board, so that in
case he should be obliged to sail at an
instant’s warning from Santa Maura, he
might do so with as little loss as possible.
On reaching the ship, Reuben found
Cesario agitated by joy and tenderness
and pious gratitude. Nicolai, after land-
ing Tamar and her children at Maganesi,
was then on board with accounts of
Amadea, whom he had safely depo-
sited in Malta, and with most liberal
proofs of the Grand Master's sense of his
and Tamar’s services. -
A letter from La Valette himself as-
sured Cesario that he had placed the in-
-teresting Amadea in the convent of Nuns
Hospitallers, where she would be treated
with all the affection and care of a sister.
He congratulated him upon the bless-

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 299
ing which seemed evidently bestowed on
his present enterprise, by so signal and un-
expected an event as that of discovering
and succouring the sister of his friend.
He next repeated his anxiety for the
result of Cesario’s endeavours to effect
Giovanni's escape, informing him that
certain vessels were dispatched to scatter
themselves among the islands as he di-
rected, as if roaming about to intercept
the Turkish traders. He then stated
what rewards he had bestowed on Tamar
and Nicolai ; and enclosed vouchers,
under his hand and seal, by which the
person presenting them would be en-
titled to receive the sum specified from
the principal mercantile house in the neu-
tral port of Trieste, as a recompense for
liberating Giovanni. -
Reuben’s deep sunken eyes sparkled
on the mere reading of these promissory
notes. “I don’t think he can resist
these!” he exclaimed, thinking of Oth-
man; and then he went on explaining to

would soon arrive at their expected goal.
Cesario's heart and ear was at one in-

and eye were given to the letter of .
Amadea. His impatience would not per-
mit him to leave it unopened; but after
running over its tender and gratifying

well and all-devoted to him, he put it
hastily into his breast, and turned with
a glowing cheek to discuss their more
important interest.
He was now decided for instant mea-
sures; and having convinced his less en-
terprising companion, that no greater be-
nefit could be expected from delay, he
intrusted him with the papers signed by
La Valette, beseeching him to return as
quickly as possible to the seraglio.
Reuben asserted, that if he were to
seek Othman at an unusual hour, it might
excite suspicion of there being too great
confidence between them; he therefore

declined going then, devoting the even-
ing to the entertainment of his daughter's
brother-in-law.
Before night, however, he departed;
having first seen Nicolai on his return to
his islet-home. -
The next day Reuben went on his mo-
mentous errand. He smoothed the path
for the proposal he had to make, by
granting to Othman, at a very low price,
a piece of Genoa velvet glaringly bro-
caded with gold and foils, upon which
the foolish Tartar had set his heart for a
vest. He then prefaced his proposal by
speaking of his relative Nicolai's secret
trips to Sicily and other interdicted
shores; and, finding that Othman ex-
pressed no disapprobation of contraband
trade, he spoke of his relation as having
touched at Malta, and heard there how
much more anxious the Order of St. John
were for the recovery of their brother
Giovanni Cigala. -
Again, Reuben lamented that he and

Othman were not the masters of Giovan-
mi's fate; and fancying themselves so for
a moment, and the knight given in ex-
change for a round ransom, he went on
to describe the different use each would
make of his separate share. - -
Reuben’s own objects of expenditure
were not dazzling to youth or luxurious-
mess; but those on which he imagined
Othman’s treasure lavished, were of a
sort to inflame an effeminate passion for
show and ornament. - -
When Reuben saw that his vivid pic-
tures had raised Othman’s desire for all
those gauds to its utmost height, he first
hinted, and at length told him plainly,
that they might realise, if they chose, the
dream he had been relating.
Othman lent a ready though startled
ear to all he urged: he became serious.
He could not but see that danger attend-
ed this tempting proposal; yet the long-
ing to possess a large sum of money was
irrepressible. It prompted him, after

a little demurring, to start a variety of
possible plans for the release of Giovanni,
though not one of them would stand the
test of Reuben’s cooler consideration.
Reuben indeed discerned, with ex-
treme concern, from canvassing Othman’s
schemes, that none of them had a chance
of success, without the actors in them
were each as ready as Cesario to sacrifice
their lives to save that of the prisoner,
should it be placed in danger during
their attempt at his escape.
With so much jealous care had the
Basha provided against such an event,
that it was only after long consultation
Othman struck out the following plan.
: The eastern end of the seraglio looked
directly upon the sea, and the tower on
the top of which Giovanni took his nightly
walk, was divided from the beach only
by the unfrequented court in which the
cypresses grew, and a high wall beyond
them. If Giovanni could descend from
that tower, and scale that wall, he might

either be received in a boat, or ford the
strait into Acarnania. . .
Othman thought it possible to win over
one of the guards, an Albanian Christian,
who, by reason of his powerful strength,
was appointed to walk by the side of the
prisoner, and seize him should he attempt
to throw himself headlong in despair.
Four other guards were always sta.
tioned on the platform during the hour
allotted for Giovanni's walk; but as they
varied every night, Othman could not
insure them by other means than mixing
a speedy opiate with their coffee and to.
bacco, previous to their going on this
particular duty. -
A night might be selected dark enough
to shroud their measures entirely; so
that while these stupefied guards were
slumbering at one end of the platform,
Giovanni and the Albanian might de-
scend by a rope-ladder; one end of which
the latter could easily fasten to the iron
spikes of the tower, while the other could

be held by Othman himself in the court.
below. The same ladder would help
them over the wall to the sea, where it
would be Reuben’s business to provide
for the security of the Albanian and the
knight. - ... • - -
This scheme involved so much danger
to Othman and the Albanian, that the
former insisted upon the previous secu-
rity of some solid gold. Reuben declared
he could only offer the written bonds of
the Grand Master, which he should con-
sider as good as money, and receive ac-
cordingly.
Othman said he was not of such easy
faith; especially since his neck would be
at stake. He examined the vouchers;
they might, or they might not be the
hand-writing of the Grand Master, he
thought: some inferior person might
have written them to deceive Nicolai
and gull Giovanni's guards into giving
him up. When presented at Trieste
they might turn out good for nothing.

In short, it was evident Othman would
not risk anything till he had gained
largely, and would gain more. -
Convinced of Othman’s sincere desire
to earn the reward held out to him, but
grievously disappointed by his scepticism,
Reuben returned in dismay to Cesario,
detailing to him the particulars of this
conversation, and requesting to receive
his further instructions. -
In an agony of impatience, Cesario,
proposed the testimony of Nicolai him-
self. “ He can positively assure this
man that he saw those papers (though
ignorant of their contents) written by
La Valette’s own hand.” -
- “Stupid people are always obstinate,”
remarked Reuben; “I told him Nicolai
could do this; but still he said, Nicolai
might have been imposed upon by some
one personating the Grand Master. Such
exalted personages, he urged, were not
in the habit of admitting smugglers to
their presence. He wanted some tangible

tres I suspect,”—“My ring! my ring!”.
exclaimed Cesario joyfully, snatching it
from his breast, where he wore suspended
and concealed, the ring twice won, and
now about to be a second time resigned
for a great and meritorious purpose.
“Show him this diamond, Reuben ;
trust it not out of your hands, for it is
more precious to me than my life. The
man who would be supposed to intrust
that to Nicolai, cannot be suspected of
being less than one amply competent to
pay any sum.” - -
Reuben, who saw this diamond for the
first time, surveyed it in silent astonish-
ment; and as he folded it religiously in
a handkerchief, and placed it in , his
breast, he bowed three times more re-
spectfully than ever to Cesario, and left
him. - -
He returned a second time, baffled
from his embassy. The sight of so splendid
and beautiful an ornament had set Oth-

man's cupidity in a blaze; so that, instead
of producing the effect intended, it fixed
him in the determination of refusing to
accept the bonds as payment for his in-
tended service; alleging, that the very
act of obtaining their payment might
render him suspected, and put his life in
danger. -
Cesario was scarcely master of himself
at this second check. “What is it he
wants!” he exclaimed passionately. —
“Can he promise me Giovanni's li-
berty?—let him insure me that, and he
may take even this precious jewel.”
“ This precious jewel, indeed!” re-
peated Reuben, thinking solely of the
intrinsic value of the stone, and placing
it in every point of light to scrutinize
its matchless perfection: “truly it is a
ransom for an emperor . It would go
hard with me, before I would part with
such a stone.” º
“I would not part with it to save my
own life, I can tell you, Reuben,” re-

plied Cesario, casting a watry glance at
the ring, “ for it was my father's; but
I’d give it, and life too, to redeem my
friend.” - - -
He then entered afresh upon the con-
versation which had passed between the
Jew and the Tartar on this eventful
circumstance; impressing upon the mind
of the former, the fact, that, though he
would not lightly resign this treasure, he
would cheerfully give the diamond in
lieu of other reward, provided Othman
actually compassed the escape of Gio-
vanni. - -
Reuben undertook this new negocia-
tion very unwillingly; but he did un-
dertake it; not quite sure whether the
rattling, talkative Tartar were not his
equal in the talent of driving a bargain.
Reuben’s return to the seraglio was,
however, in an evil hour. Every thing
there was in flames. News had just
arrived from Constantinople, of the me-
morable blowing up of the Turkish

arsenal by some undiscovered incendiary.
Public fame gave the detestable action to
the Grand Master of Malta, in revenge
for the injuries his island had sustained
during the siege; and the Basha, mad-
dened by the additional reproaches which
this drew on him from the Sultan for his
failure, now breathed the deadliest venge-
ance against every Christian knight.
He ordered Giovanni Cigala to be
brought immediately before him; and
having reviled him with every opprobrious
name befitting a coward tyrant to bestow .
upon a brave man in bonds, he assured
him that he now thought himself acquit-
ted of his oath to his nephew, and that
he should therefore instantly glut him-
self with the sight of his agonies on the
hook. - -
“That dreadful death!” exclaimed Reu-
ben, who had too often seen the victims
of Turkish barbarity perishing on hooks,
while fiends in human shape tore off their

flesh with burning pincers. “And what
said the prisoner?” -
“Nothing !” replied Othman, with a
thoughtless laugh; “there he stood with
a face as serene as yon sky: neither
moving muscle nor uttering a word, and
not one sentence would he utter for all
the great Mustapha's threatenings; so he
was ordered off, like a dog as he is, to
the condemned hole; and to-morrow, at
moon, he is to be tossed upon the hook
in full assembly of all good Mussulmen.”
Reuben’s yellow skin turned almost
green at this frightful intelligence; he
no longer thought of preserving the dia-
mond for Cesario, but with all the ear-
nestness of sincere concern and compas-
sionate alarm, began to persuade Othman
to interfere.
For the first time in his life, Reuben
found it difficult to conceal his real mo-
tives under the mask of cold calculating
self-interest; but he tried to do so,
and Othman, either easily blinded, or

vantage, suffered himself to be prevailed
O11. - }
Reuben confessed that the precious
diamond came from an immediate agent
of the Grand Master's, then in the island,
who would willingly take any personal
risk, however fearful, upon himself, if by
that means he could be put in a way of
releasing the knight: but that, mean-
while, if Othman could suspend the exe-
cution of Giovanni, the ring should be
his instant reward.
Othman’s bead-like eyes almost emitted
visible rays at this assurance. “Go your
ways then,” he said; “be under the old
locust-tree by the ruin to-night, just
before moon-rise, and I’ll bring you news
of my speeding; I'll win the diamond,
if possible; but my brain and my throat
must work well for it.” -
“Blessed Abraham " thought Reu-
ben, as he stole out of the seraglio, “to

think a good man's life should depend
upon a ribbald song, or monstrous tale !”
and praying that Othman’s talents and
success might this day transcend them-
selves, he went sorrowfully and despond-
ingly to seek Cesario. -
The agony which followed Cesario's
knowledge of his friend’s immediate dan-
ger mocks, description: perfect despair
seized him. Reuben could with difficulty
prevent his frantic bursts from being dis-
tinctly audible to those on deck: he used
every argument to comfort and to instil
hope: the stormy elements were not
deafer than. Cesario to such impotent
reasonings. The wretched young man
alternately upbraided Reuben for having
destroyed his friend by unnecessary cau-
tion; and then besought his pardon for
such unreasonable and ungrateful re-
proaches. .
After having nearly exhausted himself-
by the extravagance of his despair, he.
said in a determined voice, “I must see

this Othman, – and this very night, Reu-
ben: my friend’s life hangs on it. You
shall take me with you, when you give
him the meeting at the ruin.” * ..
... “But consider,” returned the Jew,
“our secret: I have hitherto passed you
off as one of ourselves, a Jew; not at all
concerned in 93. -
... “ No matter | : I take all the risk. I
will avow myself Giovanni's fixed friend.
Othman shall have the diamond—twenty
such, if I possessed them, if he will save
my friend.” - -
• Cesario's impetuous feelings could no.
longer bear contradiction; and Reuben,
silently determining to prepare every
thing for their instant flight from the
island, foreseeing the necessity for it,
yielded to his wish ; and promised, that
after having first conversed with Othman,
and smoothed the way for the appear-
ance of a third in their hazardous con-
fidence, to allow of his introduction.

CHAPTER XIV.
The moon had not risen when Cesario
and Reuben got into the little boat, which
only the latter was to row to shore. Not
even a single star lighted their sullen
track across the waves. The night was
gloomy and tempestuous; but Cesario
on this occasion forgot Reuben's danger,
and at no period ever calculated his own.
Reuben was less hardy; but he ven-
tured not complaint: he only looked
wistfully now and then towards the line
of rocks which they were approaching,
and which the light of their shaded torch.
showed in all their blackness.
. Cesario, however, steered the boat
safely into a narrow creek, where the old
man disembarked with all the haste in

his power; and, taking the torch, pro-
ceeded to the locust-tree.
As Cesario sat in the boat, he per-
ceived a figure cowering under the drop-
ping branches of the ivy, with which the
ruin was overgrown. When Reuben
stopped before the locust-tree, a few paces
off, this person came forth from the old
gateway and joined him.
The violent gesticulations of this per-
son showed that he was conversing with
great vehemence; but Reuben stood so
still, and seemed to take so small a share.
in the dialogue, that Cesario believed
all was over, and Reuben stupefied with
horror.
Unable to endure the intolerable sus-
pense of such a moment, he was hastily
securing his boat with the intention of
joining them at all risks, when Reuben
gave the signal agreed on, of shaking the
torch above his head; and Cesario then,
merely staying to fasten the last noose of
the rope by which he moored his little.

vessel, rushed through the darkness to
the eventful rendezvous. -
As he sprang over the low remains of
an intervening wall, and alighted beside
Reuben, the glare of the torch fell
equally upon his own wild countenance
and upon that of Othman: he gazed
eagerly at the latter, attempting to ask
if Giovanni yet lived; but his lips were
palsied, and he could only seize the Tar-
tar's arm with a convulsive grasp.
“The knight lives — Othman pro-
mises — ” Reuben’s kind address was
broken off by seeing Cesario first flush
vividly, then turn deadly pale, and stagger
back. - -
The old man ran to him; but Cesario,
waving him off with one hand, while with
the other he tightly pressed his heart,
tottered under the shade of the ruin, and
threw himself down upon one of the
fragments.
The joy was too much for him; and
though a smile, almost divine, shone on

his countenance, it seemed as if the
agony of death was on him, and his heart-
strings cracking. . - -
. . Reuben checked the steps of Othman
for a few moments, then went with him
into the ruin. -
. . . They found Cesario still seated on the
broken stone, completely unnerved by
so sudden a transition from despair to
hope. -
“You will swear to me that he lives,”
he cried, addressing Othman, “you will
promise to aid in his escape by all the
means in your power?” and as he spoke,
he laid his hand upon the diamond Oth-
man coveted. “I swear it by Alla!”
replied the other, advancing eagerly
towards the wearer of that precious ring.
Reuben then hastened with all the
quickness his habitual caution would
allow, to explain by what means the
Tartar had procured Giovanni's reprieve
from death. -
The means were briefly these,

THE KNIGHT of St. JoHN. 319
* Very soon after Reuben had quitted
the seraglio that morning, Othman was
summoned to soothe his master's fury
by the exercise of his amusing powers:
in this he had succeeded so well, that
when the Basha condescended to talk
with him of his savage pleasure for the
morrow, Othman noticed the apathy with
which the Christian had heard his sen-
tence; and from that circumstance as-
serted, that death was considered rather
a blessing than a punishment by him.
He advised, therefore, in a halfjesting
way, that the proud hero of St.Johnshould
be degraded to the lowest tasks of a
slave; and, that after having thus gone
through every suffering and indignity, he
might at last be gratified with some
dreadful and public death. . . . . . .
. This idea met with instant approbation:
Mustapha pronounced it exquisite ; and
the prisoner was then ordered to be led
out the next morning, not to execution,
P 4

320 THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN.
but to the dismal banks of a Turkish
galley. -
The scheme for Giovanni's escape was
therefore to be entirely new modelled;
and Othman most willingly left it solely
to the invention of Cesario. -
Leaving Reuben and the Tartar to
their silent ruminations, Cesario buried
his face in his hands, while racking his
mind with a thousand impracticable
"schemes: at length he struck out one
which seemed possible, though extremely
hazardous; but it was the only one he
could imagine; and as a forlorn hope
he detailed it to his two companions.
Othman was to procure him employ-
ment in the same galley with Giovanni
the first time it went off shore, and to
give him such previous notice of its
destined course, that he might provide
means for their secure retreat either by
sea or land.
By concealing a strong hatchet under
his clothes, Cesario felt certain that he


## p. 321 (#331) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 321
could, at the critical moment, sever the
chain which always fastens the right arm
of the galley-slave to his oar, and to the
bank or seat from which he rows. If
this were achieved at dusk, the obscu-
rity, the confusion, and the incapacity
of the surrounding slaves, all fettered by
their chains, would operate in their fa-
vour, and they could then spring into
the sea, and either gain the woods of
Acarnania, by fording the strait, or be
taken up by Nicolai in his boat, and car-
ried out to sea. - - -
Cesario thought of the Maltese cruisers,
now within his call ; and the more he
examined his new project, coupled with
their assistance, the less did he doubt its
success i but he did not mention this last
ground of hope to the Mussulman.
Othman deemed that part of the plan
which was imparted to him, feasible; and
he entered the more willingly into it, be-
cause his own apparent share in the me-
ditated escape, end how it might, was

not likely to be discovered; and cer-
tainly included no personal risk to him-
self during its performance. º
'. He secretly, thought, that both Gio-
vanni and his brother knight, (for such
he believed Cesario to be,) would be cut
peice-meal, by the Turkish guard in the
galley. But that was not his affair; and
promising immediate activity in the busi-
ness, he enquired whether the possession
of the diamond were to depend upon this
meditated rescue; if it were, he jocosely
observed to the agent of Malta, that he
certainly should not swim after him to
obtain it; and that consequently, if it
were not made his beforehand, the whole
matter must stop short. - *
: Without uttering a word, Cesario drew
the ring from his finger, and giving it one
earnest kiss, a kiss as expressive of gra-
titude as of regret, held it out to . Oth-
man. He waited to see it glittering on
the Tartar's finger, then turned away,
his heart quite full of the dear conviction

that his only treasure, not the funds of
the Order, had bought the life of his
friend. - º
Reuben lingered many minutes behind,
to exhort Othman not to allow his vanity
to overmaster his discretion; assuring
him, that if he ever suffered that extra-
ordinary stone to glitter in the eyes of
the Basha, their ruin was certain.'
- Othman promised this very faithfully;
but the transport of admiration with
which he regarded it, and the extra-
vagancies of speech and action into which
this admiration hurried him, made poor
Reuben quake for the event.
“I thought how it would be,” he
muttered to himself, as he stumbled after
Cesario to their boat; “I thought how
it would be, the moment Signor Adimari
insisted upon negociating with. Othman
himself.” .
With the dawn of the next day, Ce-
sario was again in the boat, proceeding
to Meganesi. It was no longer possible

for him to trust to the slow agency of
Reuben, or to calculate any risk of dan-
ger to himself by the failure of those he
must endeavour to gain over to his pur-
pose. Giovanni's precious life hung on
the wing of every passing instant, and it
behoved Cesario, therefore, to dare the
most imminent peril for his immediate
TeSCUle. - -
Regardless of Reuben’s panic-struck
entreaties for consideration, he rowed
direct to Meganesi; then seeking, and
finding out the sheltered hovel of Nicolai,
invited him to a private conference,
Boldly, and without preface, he told
him the work in hand; feeling himself
warranted in this hardy experiment by
that mixture of thoughtless contempt of
public law, and that scrupulous honour
in keeping voluntary engagements, which
Amadea had described as marking the
smuggler’s conduct during their short
voyage.
Nicolai did not disappoint Cesario:
13


## p. 325 (#335) ############################################

THE KNIGHT OF ST. JOHN. 325
his active spirit delighted in danger; and
the gratifying thought of having such
noble partakers in illicit adventure, (he
forgot what different motives sanctified
Cesario's forced deceptions,) was per-
haps one incitement to share the en-
terprise. - -
He pledged himself to be in readiness
with his boat for any station and at any
time Cesario would appoint; and de-
scribing some Secret grottoes, both in-
land and on the coast of the strait, he
asserted, that if Cesario and his friend
would consent to lie there concealed, he
would answer for secreting them as long
as their safety required. Meanwhile, he
did not hesitate to embark immediately
in search of the Maltese cruisers.
Cesario now intrusted him with a let-
ter, requesting whatever cruiser Nicolai
might firstencounter, to advance speedily,
in compliance with the Grand Master's
instructions, and be within reach of fur-
ther call: he then proffered him gold, but

a
Nicolai rejected it with some pride, and,
throwing himself into his little bark,
pushed off to sea. - ... ."
Cesario lingered a few moments after
him, to converse with Tamar upon the
object of his tenderest thoughts. Tamar
spoke with astonishment and respect of
the honours she had seen rendered in
Malta to the Zeila of Zante : but when
she described that Zeila's soothing con-
cern for the suffering children, who had
never before known the motion of a ship,
and the terrors of the sea, the mother’s
grateful heart lost sight of arbitrary dis-
tinctions, and poured forth a full tide of
familiar affection. - -
She was now sufficiently instructed in
Amadea's and Cesario’s real condition to
give a shrewd guess at the nature of their
sympathy; and she ventured, therefore,
with a little of her father's adroitness, to
mix up so many touching proofs of Ama-
dea's constant and fond recollection of
her absent lover, that Cesario, scarcely

knowing what it was that made him so
happy, left Meganesi as if he could tread
on air. . . . . . . . )
- Othman was not slow of performing
his promise: in a few days afterwards,
he sent Reuben to inform Cesario, that
two Maltese galleys having appeared in
those seas, and one of them having al-
ready made prize of a rich merchant-ship,
he had persuaded the Basha to attempt
taking the successful enemy. -
In consequence of this advice, Mus-
tapha had ordered the Sultana (his largest
galley) to be immediately got ready for
sea; and as she was but lately come round
from Constantinople, and in excellent
condition, there was not a doubt of her
being able to get out of port in a very
few days. . . - -
If Cesario thought this galley, Othman
said, a fit ground for the eventful scene
they had to play, as Giovanni would cer-
tainly be placed in her, Othman could

easily obtain an ostensible situation for
s friend in the same vessel.
Cesario's answer was prompt and de-
cisive for instantly seizing this first op-
portunity: he then exhorted Reuben to
provide for his own safety immediately,
by sailing with the first fair wind; leaving
him, (as if they had parted in an ill-
humour,) apparently to seek other em-
ployment, or the means of returning to
his home. . - -
Evident necessity would then afford a
plea for his afterwards accepting a sub-
ordinate station on-board the galley of
the Basha.
Reuben was not easily induced to
abandon Cesario to his fate; but the
other used such earnest entreaties and
solid arguments in support of his anxious
wish, that the old man was at length
prevailed on to give a reluctant consent.
When he did so, he half determined to
yield assent to another of Cesario's pro-
posals, which was, that he would finally

renounce Turkish Greece, and, drawing
round him his daughter and her family,
jointly pursue their habits of industry
under the protection of their Italian
friends.
Some tears were shed on both sides
when they parted; and as Cesario, from
the caverned hut of Nicolai, took his
farewell look of Reuben’s departing ves-
sel, (which was going straight to Malta,
charged with all that love and gratitude
could address to Amadea and La Va-
lette,) his blood thrilled at the awful crisis
to which he had himself arrived.
His life, and that far dearer to him,
the life of Giovanni, lay now between
the faith of a desperate smuggler and the
unprincipled flatterer of a tyrant. What

Cesario, by previous agreement with
Othman, appeared at the landing-place of
the beach of Santa Maura; addressing
himself, as if by chance, to Othman,
who, as if by chance, was then in com-
pany with the head-carpenter of the
Basha.
Having listened to Cesario's very brief
account of his desertion by a master who
had no longer need of him; and having
questioned him on his share in re-fitting
Reuben’s vessel; Othman, in his own
language, congratulated the carpenter on
the wonderful luck of this rencontre,
urging him to take advantage of the
young Jew’s necessity, and make a good
bargain with him : as he could assure
Meshnoul (so the carpenter was called)
that from what he had heard Reuben say,
during his traffic with him, of the young
fellow’s cleverness and industry, he was a
prize worth catching. . - --
Meshnoul was as stupid and sordid as
Othman could desire; and seeing no ob-

ject whatever but gain, he struck an in-
stant bargain with Cesario. -
Othman had now done his part, secretly
glad to get rid of a person who might, if
discontented with his attempts at serving
him, discover the secret of his infidelity
to his master; and, turning his bugle eyes
on Cesario, with a glance which meant,
perhaps, to say as much, and which ex-
cited alarm by its expression of selfish
exultation, he retrod his steps to the
seraglio. . …
“I am in the Rubicon now, and there
is no receding !” exclaimed Cesario in-
wardly, as he followed his new master;
“but at least I shall share the fate of my
friend, be that what it may ; and Ama-
dea is safe l’” * - ".
... A sigh followed the tender image of
her he loved, while his softened heart
imagined all she must suffer, if it were
not in the decrees of Providence that
they should ever meet again.
Only they whose fates are cast among

the storms of life can completely under-
stand the feelings of Cesario. Astonish-
ing reverses and preservations; old friend-
ships vanishing under their weight, and
new ones solicitously running to their sup-
port; a variety of checks and of mercies,
keep their souls in a continual sense of
their own dependence and of their Crea-
tor's authority. These are the charac-
ters which feel, in the fullest tide of
youthful spirits, when elated by un-
expected joy, an awe and a gratitude im-
possible to be comprehended by those
whose fortunate youth has passed without
vicissitude. . -
Thus Cesario, young, animated, in-
trepid, resolute to dare all and to do all
for laudable objects, still felt even those
powers and that resolution as nothing,
without the sanction of Almighty Pro-
vidence. His heart, therefore, gradu-
ally turned from earth to heaven, im-
ploring a blessing and receiving the in-
spiration of hope.

On reaching the Sultana he found her,
as Othman had described, nearly ready
for sea. Most of her people were on
shore, but some inferior officers had got
on board impatient for the chance of a
prize.
Meshnoul went lazily to work, and set
Cesario his task. Cesario gave his soul
to his humble employment; and ad-
vanced, therefore, so rapidly, that the
carpenter did indeed believe he had got
a prize in him. The officers were pleased
with an activity which seconded their
wishes; so that Cesario ventured even
to speed his slower master by volunteer-
ing a variety of useful assistances, all
tending to accelerate the completion of
the Sultana. -
On the fourth morning the vessel was
pronounced perfect, and the slaves ap-
pointed to row in her were then brought,
to take their seats on her banks.
As the galley lay at the usual place of
anchorage, far below the town, the slaves,

were necessarily brought to her in boats.
While these were approaching, Cesario
stood on the deck of the Sultana watch-
ing their progress. - -
All the galley-slaves were stripped to
the waist, as is customary, and their
heads uncovered. Many of them were
Turkish or Greek malefactors, and others
captured enemies, who had toiled so long
at the oar as to be scarcely distinguish-
able from their infidel companions.
Amongst these swarthy and withered
figures, the yet unwasted and spotless
body of Giovanni shone like some sculp-
tured Grecian deity in the midst of
Egyptian idols.
Cesario, with mournful admiration,
recognised his friend in that glorious
form ; but as the boats drew nearer, and
showed him that noble breast covered
with the scars of wounds, a crowd of af.
fecting ideas rushed into his mind.
On those immortalising scars he fixed
his gushing eyes; he stretched out his

arms, while his whole heart seemed well-
ing towards his friend in a thousand
Streams.
Some inarticulate sounds escaped him;
but feeling that in another instant he
should lose all self-command, he fled
from the deck, nor returned to it till
each boat had reached the Sultana, and
deposited its wretched cargo.
The wild tumult of soul which suc-
ceeded in Cesario to those few moments
of softness is indescribable. The heavy
sound of the slaves’ feet above his head,
the horrid clank of their chains, the
threatening voices and echoing whips of
their inhuman masters, the half-uttered
groans of some of the slaves, and the
deep-drawn sighs of others, (sighs, now
as habitual as their breathings,) roused all
that was man in his soul. -
“O, not for thee alone, my Giovanni,”
he exclaimed, feeling every sigh and
groan that reached him enter his very

heart, and trying to shut them out by
burying his head in his hands.
Nothing but the hope of successfully
contending, hereafter, for the liberation
of these unhappy men could have enabled
him to control his transport of virtuous
fury now; that thought calmed him;
and, assured that humanity as well as
friendship would nerve his arm, should
Heaven grant him the opportunity he
prayed for, he waited till he believed the
slaves settled in their places, and then he
slowly ascended to the deck.
Cesario stood at a distance, while his
eager and almost trembling eyes ran over
the dark files of wretches: they rested on
the face of his friend — that face so be-
loved! that face so sanctified by a thou-
sand touching and solemn recollections
He expected to have found it changed;
but it was the same. A soul, serene in
conscious virtue and Christian submission,
shone in that noble countenance, pre-

serving its youth, its clearness, its bright-
ness. - -
To the rivetted gaze of Cesario, it
seemed as if no mortal cloud had dimmed
that heavenly light, since he had seen it
shining from Giovanni's eyes in the
church of St.John. The same expres.
sion, the same light, were still in those
saintly eyes; but as they slowly turned
from the heaven on which they had first
rested, to wander over the miserable
beings around, Cesario saw them gra-
dually fill with tears. - -
His own were ready to gush out with
tenderness and grief: he was rent with
impatient yearnings to run and throw
himself upon the neck of his friend; but
again he conquered himself, and moved
away that he might wind up his soul to
the great exertion before him. .
His agitation would not perhaps have
passed unnoticed, had not the arrival of
the Basha, with his suite, created a con-
fusion which happily screened all other

eccentricities. This event was the signal
for departure. A discharge of musque-
try on board was answered by an equal
number of guns from the castle of Santa
Maura; after which the sails were given
to the wind, the slaves plied their oars,
and the Sultana proceeded on her way.
It was the Basha's intention to proceed
only to the extremity of the island; there
to be relanded, (after a short stretch out
to sea,) while the galley should pursue
her chase of the Maltese cruisers: but
the elements did not acknowledge his
authority: ere they had got a league's
distance, the wind suddenly shifted and
blew so furiously off the island, accom:
panied with hail and rain, that the Sul-
tana was obliged to yield to its power. :
Cesario, scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice or to deprecate this circumstance,
(having meditated that his friend’s rescue
should take place after the re-landing of
the Basha should give them better pro-
spect of escape,) looked anxiously round

for the little bark of Nicolai, which had
hitherto followed their track, secured
from notice by its Turkish appearance:
He saw it still faithfully contending with
the elements; and his heart ached with
a grateful feeling of regret at the despe-
rate habits of him by whom it was so
honestly guided. . . . . . . . .
Hitherto the commander of the Sul-
tana had endeavoured to regain the shore
by dint of rowing; and for this purpose
every, horrid expedient familiar to the
piratical powers in those days, was fully
exercised. Blows, execrations, lashes,
were dealt to such of the unhappy crea-
tures as were incapacitated from great
exertions either by despair or weakness.
One slave dropt fainting under the la-
ceration of the whip; and Cesario, whose
every limb now quivered with strong
abhorrence, started forwards, offering to
take the wretched man’s seat. . . . . ;
. ... Hitherto he had kept far from the
cognisance of Giovanni, who, at a dis-

tance, could not have discovered his
friend under his Jewish disguise, even
had his eye rested on him: Cesario was
now about to come directly under his
notice; ere he did so, he looked up to
the increasing clouds, and as he felt their
chilling torrents driven against him by
the furious blasts, he secretly prayed
that their mingled storm was destined to
aid his friend’s deliverance. *
With unsteady limbs he now took his
seat on the bench next to the only object
which now possessed his thoughts. Gio-
vanmi was at that moment exerting all
his strength to speed the homeward
course of the galley; as on that depended
the temporary deliverance of his weaker
fellow-sufferers from their toil and their
indignities. The motive ennobled the act.
He did not observe who sat down beside
him, while his eyes followed the poor
fainting slave that was borne away.
Every pulse beating almost to bursting,
and his sight obscured as if by a thick

film, Cesario grasped the vacant oar, his
head buried in his breast and shaded by
his clustered locks. Every face was soon
iturned landward, attracted by the rush-
ing of a louder blast: at that moment,
Cesario gently touched Giovanni, and
raising his head, from which he shook
back the hair, turned his face full upon
him. - - r.
Giovanni's eye met his : —half spring-
ing from his seat with a flash of vivid
red, a stifled cry, a glance, Giovanni's
shaking limbs showed his recognition.
A second glance exehanged their souls.
The next instant each head was turned
away, seemingly intent upon their un-
worthy tasks. Could their hearts have
been laid open at that instant, what
powerful and struggling passions had
amazed those who saw them
Giovanni was as if awaked in a new
world; and Cesario, agitated a thousand-
ifold by hopes and fears and tender re-
membrances, was counting every pulse of

the passing hour, conscious that in it
was to be summed up the destinies of
Giovanni, of himself, and of Amadea.
The sleety storm had abated, but the
wind still blew the galley violently out to
sea. Nicolai's little bark, with its single
sail rent to pieces, was now driven be-
yond sight. Only one vessel was visible
in the sea between Santa Maura and
Corfu, pursuing the same course with
the Sultana.
As the vessels neared each other, Ce-
sario's heart beat almost audibly : he
thought he discovered the peculiar form
of a Maltese cruiser; and he was not
wrong. When the Sultana drew near,
the strange vessel suddenly hoisted the
black cross of Malta, and made evident
preparation for action. .
Again Cesario's dark glancing eye
flashed upon that of Giovanni; Giovanni
needed no interpretation of its kindling
meaning: his illuminated countenance-
reflected, the answer his friend's had

sought; and, plying their oars, each
seemed to second the eager wish of the
Basha, to attain the small island of Toxa,
the nearest refuge then open to the
alarmed Mussulmen. - tº
ºn The Basha, who had indeed no incli-
nation to hazard his own person in an en-
gagement by sea, exhorted his people to
avoid an action with the Maltese galley,
intimating that his duty as a governor,
however anxious he might be for the
combat, must prevent his sanctioning a
chase which might carry him from his
government for an indefinite time; he
promised them, that when they should
have landed him at Toxa, they should
have permission to seek the enemy.” His
crew therefore used every exertion to
get beyond reach of the Maltese, but
their exertion was vain. -
So long as Mustapha thought he might
escape without the appearance of an ac-
tual flight, he continued his course to-
wards Toxa, but the determination of

the Maltese to arrest her progress, hav.
ing become too apparent for him to elude
the disgrace which must be attached to
the Turkish flag, should it be made ma-
nifest that he had positively avoided an
action, the Basha, yielding to necessity,
ordered the commander to give the
proper directions for meeting the enemy.
Cesario’s roused soul now flamed in
his eyes, as, half-starting from his oar, he
bent forward, watching the advance of
his Christian coadjutors. Giovanni, mean-
while, preserved a majestic stillness of
action and of look, which imposed some
curb upon the more tumultuous agitation
of his friend.
The opposing vessels soon closed and
boarded; and the respective crews, im-
pelled by their mutual hatred, rushed
to the fight. The combat was obstinate;
but nothing could resist the ardour and
impetuosity of the Maltese, who, ani-
mated with the double motive of liber-
ating their friends, whom they knew

to be on board, and of triumphing again
over their inveterate enemy the Basha,
sprang forward with the dreadful shout
of “Revenge!” -
At that instant, while the Christians
were pouring upon the deck of the
enemy, and the infidels opposing fierce
resistance; amid the crash and the up-
roar, the thunder and volumed smoke
of their mutual firing, Cesario drew
forth the hatchet concealed under his
garment, and with one stroke severed
—the chain that fettered the arm of Gio-
vanni; then, like the lioness rushing
away with her rescued young, he darted
with him into the ranks of their friends.
The names of “Cigala” and “Adi-
mari!” the war-cry of “Liberty and St.
John P’ thrilled through the hearts of
friends and enemies. A well-known
voice echoed those thrilling sounds : it
was the voice of Rodolphe. Giovanni
saw him; recognised him ; but this was
ino time for greetings: all was tumult,

and strife and slaughter; and, plunging
into the thick of the combatants, Gio-
vanni and Cesario ran to attain their
dear sought-for freedom. . . . .
* “Treason —Treachery Pº resounded
from the Basha and his officers, as they
retreated for a moment before the im-
petuous rush of the Christians. - * *
Cesario, with his tremendous hatchet,
and Giovanni with a scymitar snatched
from an enemy, scattered destruction
around: the former darted on the in-
furiate Mustapha, to give him the death
he merited; but another arm than his
was destined to avenge his friend: a ball
from some common musqueteer struck
the Basha on the temple, and he fell.
As the fierce Mustapha dropped, the
captain of the Maltese called on the
remaining Turks to surrender, offering
them their lives and liberties upon that
condition. One instant the infidels he-
sitated; the next, they struck their flag. :

vessel, that Cesario and Giovanni gave
loose to their gushing hearts. After
having hastily exchanged grateful salu-
tations with their Christian brethren, and
severally raised from their feet to their
bosoms, the faithful and weeping Ro-
dolphe, they retired below; and ºthere,
in one sacred embrace, filled up the
mighty measure of their happiness.
: “My Giovanni!” – “Brother of my
soul!” were the first words they uttered,
after a long, long indulgence of over-
powering joy. “Brother!” repeated
Cesario, fixing on him his all-expressing
eyes, “O Giovanni!”. The blissful dis-
closure he had to make was not to be
withheld ; it burst from his heart in
broken, incoherent sentences, which only
the rapid and agitated questions of his
friend forced into an intelligible form.
When, at last, the latter comprehended
all that impetuous narrative included, he
covered his joyfully-suffused face with
his hands, gasping, as he got with dif.

ficulty into another cabin,-" No more-
no more, Cesario, now !” -
As he retreated into the room he closed
the door; there to throw himself, without
even the witness of friendship, before
Him whose bounteous hand was thus
prodigal of blessings. Cesario's grateful
soul was not silent during those solemn
moments: it ascended in the same word-
less thanksgiving to the same Gracious
Power: and when the friends met again,
they needed no explanation of their se-
paration. -
According to the terms of their sur-
render, the Turkish prisoners were all
landed at Corfu ; after which, the Mal-
tese galley, with her prize, and the re-
leased Christians, proceeded on her
homeward way.
Cesario might have enforced a con-
queror's right, and reclaimed the diamond
he had given to Othman; or he might
have bought it back: but he scorned the
meanness of the first act, and the latter he

did not wish for: he cherished the con-
sciousness of having redeemed Giovanni's
life and liberty by a great sacrifice.
In the recapitulation of all their suf.
ferings and sympathies of feeling, Cesario
and Giovanni scarcely noted the days
which passed at sea. The latter thirsted
to hear every circumstance of his sister's
character and appearance; and Cesario
loved but too well to repeat the same
descriptions. When they discussed the
particulars of the siege, (which had been
so mis-stated by the Turks,) Rodolphe
often shared the conversation, ennobled
by his own brave share in those memor-
able scenes, and endeared to both friends
by his tried attachment.
Giovanni's own narrative was barren
of incident. At first, uniform dreariness
and solitude; and finally, insult and de-
gradation made up its annals.
“Yet I had my luxury, my Cesario !”
he said smiling, when the latter uttered
some violent apostrophe at his dismal

situation in Santa Maura. “It was the
hour they allotted me upon the platform
of the tower. The feeling of the pure
air, the view of the splendid heavens, the
glimpses Icaught through the cypresses of
the sea and the islands, and the adjacent
shores, supplied me with some of the.
most delightful emotions I ever remember
to have experienced. I had no other
enjoyment, and I felt its full value.
“When I believed you had perished
with all my brave friends in Malta, how
often did I look on those heavens spark-
ling with stars, and think that in one of
its radiant worlds, perhaps, I should meet
my Cesario again.” * * * *
Giovanni's eyes suffused with tender-
mess, and he stopt a moment, returning
the pressure of his friend's, hand with
equal emotion. Cesario thought of Ama-
dea's yet tenderer eyes, and sighed with
fond impatience. Giovanni resumed,—
“As long as I live, I shall love one or
two particular stars, because they hap-

pened to be the most frequent subjects
of my visionary fancies.”
... In discourses like these passed the
hour. A clear atmosphere, enlivened by
a February sun, made every object cheer-
ful, when the vessel which contained the
friends entered the great port of Malta.
The knight who commanded her had re-
ceived instructions from the Grand Master
when he left him, to announce success, if :
successful, by a certain number of signal
guns: these were no sooner discharged,
than the thundering echo of St. Angelo's
spread the joyful tidings over the whole
island; and when their bravest knight
landed on the shore, he saw collected
there, amongst the crowd of obscurer
persons, all that remained of his own
numerous brethren. * *
A multitude of regrets thronged on
him ; and the shades of all the buried
heroes seemed to rise before his eyes and
those of Cesario; but unwilling to damp
the sacred pleasure of this moment, they

both dismissed their gathering sadness,
and advanced into the eager crowd.
As Giovanni threw himself at the feet
of the Grand Master, the latter raised
him to his breast; and while he held him
there, named him aloud to a vacant
Commandery in Italy: then turning to
Cesario, who was fervently kissing his out-
stretched hand, he added, “Heaven has
united your hearts; I will not divide
your lives!” - . . .
. A burst of sympathy rose from the
surrounding persons; it was repeated
when Giovanni, claiming for Rodolphe
the honour once promised that faithful
follower by the venerable Dueguerras,
obtained for him permission to assume
the inferior habit of the Order, and to
accompany him to Italy.
“ Pardon me, if I now enquire for my
greatest happiness!” said Giovanni, read-
ing the impatient eyes of his agitated
friend: “My sister—” ... º. -
“You will find her in the convent of

our nuns,” replied La Valette; and, re-
Ieasing the hands, which he still affection-
ately held, of both friends, he motioned
them to obey their own wishes.
With this permission they hastened im-
mediately to the convent. Their names
admitted them into a vacant apartment,
to which Amadea was summoned: they
were told, that, already apprised of their
arrival by the long-watched signal guns,
she was now just recovered from the
overpowering effects of her joy and gra-
titude. * * , -
The hearts of both her lover and bro-
ther long beat at the sound of every step
which caught their ear. “Ah, that is
hers P’ exclaimed Cesario at last, spring-
ing to the door in blissful certainty: he
saw her radiant in beauty and joy and
love ; she started back at his different
habit; but once meeting his eyes, she
was just going to throw herself upon his
breast, when, seeing Giovanni by his side,

past error; and sunk into his fondly-
extended arms,
