 Mr. COWLEY, father of Miss Cow- 
 ley, was, at an early age, left an orphan, 
 with an ample inheritance in Jamaica, 
 the place of his birth. He. was consigned 
 by, the will of his father, who had sur- 
 vived his mother, to the guardianship of 
 a gentleman who resided in London, and 
 Avho, in his commercial concerns, had for 
 a course of years evinced an integrity, 
 founded on the liberal principles of an 
 enlightened mind and a cultivated un- 
 derstanding. The care of his estate was 
 left in the hands of a friend, not less

 qualified for this more subordinate office. 
 He lived on the spot; and was enriched 
 by the vigilance and honesty with which 
 he discharged his duty. His first care 
 after his benefactor's decease, was to send 
 the young heir to England, for the pur- 
 pose of his improvement ; and his /Lon- 
 don guardian, not only placed him within 
 the reach of the attainments requisite for 
 his future happiness, but by his truly 
 parental care and tenderness, gave him 
 the fairest example of the influence and 
 benefits resulting from a conduct govern- 
 ed by virtue and solid wisdom. Thus 
 secured on all sides by a gracious Provi- 
 dence, Henry Cowley lived to reach his 
 twenty-first year; when, by the sud- 
 den death of his benevolent friend, 
 he found himself master of his time, his 
 fortune, and his amusements. But love 
 had provided an armour of defence 
 against the seductions of the world; and 
 the difficulties he had to surmount in

 attaining the object of his affections, 
 gave to his youthful ardour pursuits far 
 remote from the clangers of dissipation. To 
 conquer the reluctance of Mrs. Dawson, 
 they oung lady's mother, to her daughter's 
 marrying him, or any other pretender to 
 her favour, was a trial, not only of his 
 patience and perseverance, but also .of 
 her daughter's health and spirits; for she 
 had long since given her heart to young 
 Cowley, and well knew that the only 
 impediment in the way to her union with 
 the man she loved, was the excessive and 
 fond attachment of her mother to her 
 society, and the wish of having no com- 
 petitor for a heart which she conceived 
 to be made only for herself The young 
 lady's declining spirits, and the argu- 
 ments urged by her lover, at length gained 
 a cold consent, to which were annexed 
 conditions that Cowley cheerfully agreed 
 to. These were principally confined to 
 the young couple's residence under her

 roof, and a promise, never to hazard a 
 voyage to Jamaica without her concur- 
 rence. Satisfied on these essential points, 
 she hastened the nuptials, in order to 
 expedite her removal with her daughter 
 to Bristol Hot- Wells, whither she was 
 ordered by her physician; and entirely 
 regardless of procuring settlements, her 
 daughter being an only child, the party 
 proceeded from the altar to their destined 
 abode at Clifton; where health, peace, 
 and gaiety met the happy pair. Mrs. 
 Dawson's apprehensions for the life of her 
 beloved daughter, had not long subsided 
 before she became alarmed for herself: 
 the honey-moon continued longer than 
 her forbearance; she imagined herself 
 neglected. Fears and explanations were 
 succeeded by altercations, and fits of sul- 
 lenness and evenrudenessto poor Cowley; 
 who, in consideration of his wife's 
 tranquillity, redoubled his attentions to 
 her mother. This tribute of true affection

 gained him nothing M^ith Mrs. Dawson, 
 for it unfortunately gave lier daugliter 
 an oppovt unity of observing, more than 
 once, that *' Mr. Cowley's behaviour to 
 her mother was of itself sufficient to en- 
 gage her love, her esteem and gratitude." 
 
 During the space, of three years the 
 amiable wife bore with patience these 
 jealous caprices of her mother ; not so 
 acquiescent was the husband : he was 
 weary of the contest, and the tender 
 Marian trembled for her husband's peace 
 and her owii future happiness. The 
 death of Mr. Cowley's faithful agent in 
 Jamaica, which happened at this period, 
 rendered a voyage thither indispensible 
 to Mr. Cowley. He explicitly placed 
 before his wife and her mother his inten- 
 tions to visit his patrimony; and left 
 them to decide whether he was to go unac- 
 companied by the only person who couIg 
 solace him in his absence from England,

 Mrs. Cowley firmly declared her purpose 
 of going with him, and to every argu- 
 ment and intreaty used by her mother, 
 applied the same answer: â€” **My duty, my 
 affection, my very life, urge me to un- 
 dertake a voyage which my husband 
 hazards; and were it round the world I 
 would cheerfully share the dangers with 
 my Cowley." Let it suffice that Mrs. 
 Cowley persevered, and from the hour of 
 her daughter's departure, her mother 
 nourished an irreconcilable hatred to Mr. 
 Cowley; attributing to his cruelty and 
 undue authority the absence of his wife, 
 "who was not permitted to love even her 
 mother, nor that mother to shelter her 
 from his tyrannical temper." 
 
 Candour as well as the proofs before mc, 
 exact from my pen, however, some quali- 
 fications, which will soften down to the 
 weakness of human nature these severe 
 traits in Mrs. Dawson's character; for it

 favourable lineaments, and amongst seve- 
 ral, it is proper to distinguish one, namely, 
 her generous cares in sheltering under her 
 roof a young lady, who was left an orphan 
 for more than three years, at the end of 
 which period she married happily. As 
 this act of friendship and benevolence on 
 Mrs. Dawson's part produced a course of 
 active and important duties on the young 
 kdy's, and as these are materially con- 
 nected" with my narrative, it must be 
 allowed me to mention more particularly 
 the advantages which had, at this period 
 of my history, accrued to Mrs. Dawson, 
 from her kind protection of Miss Otway.. 
 Her age, her various talents, and her at- 
 tractive virtues, had contributed to form 
 Marian Dawson's mind, and to obviate the 
 evils of her mother's unlimited indul- 
 gence. Till her marriage with Ain 
 Hardcastle, to whom she had been en- 
 gaged before she lost her father, and

ed to marry when deprived of this sup- 
 port, her whole attention had been given 
 to Miss Dawson's education ; and al- 
 though the instructress and the pupil 
 differed not in age more than two or 
 three years, nothing less than the blind- 
 est folly could have overlooked the rich 
 recompence which Mrs. Dav/son derived 
 from her kindness to MissOtway: themost 
 perfect friendship andconfidence subsisted 
 between the young women. Cowley was 
 the intimate friend of Mr. Hardcastle^ 
 though several years younger than him- 
 self, and few of Mrs. Dawson's connec- 
 tions doubted of the share which the 
 Hardcastles had taken in the unhappy 
 dissentions caused by Mrs. Dawson's iil- 
 regulated fondness to her child.. It is 
 certain, that both Mr. and Mrs. Cowley 
 had the concurrence of these friends in 
 regard to the measures they pursued ; 
 and with the most sanguine hopes of 
 succeeding, they both engaged to spare

 no pains in reconciling Mrs. Dawson to the 
 temporary absence of her son and daugh- 
 ter, nor in preparing her to expect Mr. 
 Cowley to have an establishment of Iris 
 own at his return. Faithful to their en- 
 gagements, they in part effected their pur- 
 }>ose. Their attentions soothed the afflict- 
 ed mother. She found that she was not 
 wholly abandoned; she talked of her 
 poor unhappy child till compassion had 
 subdued resentment, and tinie had ba- 
 nished tears and bewailings; and Mrs. 
 Dawson again tasted the comforts of 
 health, affluence, and friendship, altliough 
 still dead to the pleasure of J or given ess^ 
 probably, because it was less painful to 
 hate Cowley than to reproach herself. 
 
 Mr. Hardcastle's succession to his un* 
 cle's estate of about live or six hundred 
 pounds per annum, induced a clmnge 
 in his plans of life. He gave up his pro- 
 fession in the law, and retired to his in-

 infant, Mrs. Dawson suffered little from 
 this change, for she passed months at a 
 time with them in the country, and en- 
 joyed the variety of the seasons with 
 health, and few regrets beyond her 
 usual topic for discontent. " Seven years 
 a wife without the chance of being a 
 Biother," had not been unfrequently ad- 
 verted to by Mrs. Dawson, as a proof of 
 Mr. Cowley's demerits in the sight of 
 Heaven. ** He, that so fervently wished for 
 children ! But his wretched temper would 
 have its punishments." Alas ! his fond 
 and too eager wishes had most unquest- 
 ionably their disappointment in the hour 
 of their fruition; for, in consequence af 
 a fever which no skill could overcome, he 
 lost his wife six weeks after she had given 
 liim a daughter. Mrs. Dawson sunk un- 
 der this heavy stroke. Nothing remain-

 order to gratify this, she made her wilL

 To Rachel Marian Cowley, her grand- 
 daughter, she bequeathed all her property; 
 but subjected it to conditions, which 
 sufficiently marked her hatred to the 
 infant's father. In case Mr. Cowley sub- 
 mitted to relinquish the rights of a 
 parent, and to place his daughter under 
 Mr. and Mrs. Hardcastle's care, the chikl 
 was immediately after her decease to be 
 conveyed to England, and given into 
 their protection. On this condition, she 
 was entitled to the annual interest result- 
 ing from the sum which constituted her 
 fortune, and which was vested in the 
 public funds, to the amount of a capital 
 which produced more than six hundred 
 pt)unds per annum. The father's refusal 
 to concede to these terms, restricted her 
 from the fortune till she was twenty-one, 
 or till she married with the consent of Mr. 
 Hardcastle and the other trustee appoint- 
 ed to this duty. In case of her death

 left to Mr. Hardcastle and his family. Sa- 
 tisfied with this disposition of her worldly 
 possessions, she appeared to have reco- 
 vered her usual health and composure, 
 except when speaking of her grand-child. 
 On these affecting occasions, her only 
 consolation appeared to rise from Mr. 
 and Mrs. Hardcastle's reiterated promises 
 to receive the child, whenever Mr. Cowley 
 should think it proper to claim their 
 kind offices. They repeated this assurance 
 in the most solemn terms, and Mrs. Hard- 
 castle, with ceaseless labour, endeavoured 
 to ^^L on her mind the persuasion, that 
 Mr. Cowley would think of no one but 
 himself for so precious a charge. Mrs. 
 Dawson w^as suddenly removed by an 
 apoplectic fit the following winter; and 
 Counsellor Steadman, her executor and 
 trustee, in communicating to Mr. Hard-

 will and testament, was neither surprised

 and having informed Mr. Cov/ley of thlÂ§

 to determine -at his leisure, on the fitness 
 of Mrs. Dawson's arrangements for his 
 daughter's benefit and security. 
 
 During this period of time, the unhap- 
 py Mr. Cowley was giving the most un- 
 equivocal andjiielancholy proofs to those 
 about him, of the affection he cherished 
 for his amiable and lost Marian. A lone: 
 and dangerous illness had succeeded to 
 lier death, the consequence of his at- 
 tendance, fatigue, and grief; and when 
 rescued from the grave by the vigour of his 
 constitution, his friends found his mind 
 sunk into the deepest gloom.- From this 
 deplorable condition, he was gradually 
 roused by thesightof his infant daughter.

 Happily the child was healthy, and had 
 for its preservation an attendant well 
 qualified to supply a mother's cares. 
 Mrs. Cowley, on quilting England, had 
 fortunately^ secured in the female attend- 
 ant who accompanied her, more than the 
 talents aud fidelity of a domestic. Mrs. 
 Allen was a widow ; she had been well 
 instructed in her youth, and matured in 
 wisdom and knowledge by a natural good 
 sense, and the discipline of adversity.. 
 The femme de chambre was forgotten 
 in the usual friend and companion of the 
 voyage, and Mrs. Cowley introduced 
 Mrs. Allen to her new circle in a manner: 
 suitable to her merits. To this excellent 
 woman she in some sort bequeathed her 
 infant, engaging her, in the most affect- 
 ing terms, to watch over the child till it 
 was safe with Mrs. Hardcastle, who had 
 promised her to be its parent when in 
 England. This request was enforced by 
 Mr. Cowley also ; and Mrs. Allen forgot

 not her obligations in the performance of 
 her duty. From the time of her lady's 
 death, as she always called Mrs. Cowley, 
 she regularly corresponded with Mrs. 
 Hardcastle ; and from her letters to this 
 lady, I have learned to judge both of Mr* 
 Cowley's attachment to his wife and child, 
 and of Mrs. Allen's good sense. I shall 
 transcribe a part of one of the letters she 
 wrote to Mrs. Hardcastle, when the child 
 was something more than three years old: 
 it delineates the condition of a father 
 seeking refuge from sorrow in the indul- 
 gence of fondness, the fruits of which 
 are too often found in bitter repentance. 
 After an account of Mr. Cowley's im* 
 proved health, and incessant demands on 
 her little charge for the cheerfulness he 
 still needed, she thus proceeds: " Judge, 
 my dear Madam, what must be the re- 
 sult of this excessive fondness ! what 
 must be the condition of a being, liable 
 to contradiction and disappointment from

 are laws which no one dare to disobey. 
 Nature, my dear Madam, has formed her 
 for a better purpose, than subduing her 
 fathers judgment by lier atti'active per- 
 son and irresiSLtble vivacity. But with 
 all the sportive charms of infancy, with, 
 I may say, redundant health and activity, 
 with beauty to dazzle all sober judgment 
 that views her in her happy moments, she 
 cannot impose on me, nor quiet my ap- 
 prehensions for her future life; for she has 
 passions which need the curb, and 
 those are hourly strengthening. Already 
 she is more despotic with her father than 
 he is with his slaves ; and my influence 
 with her depends only on her generous 
 nature. She cannot bear to see me

 which she beheld her, soon rendered Mrs. 
 Hardcastle favourably disposed towards a 
 child whose misfortune it had been, to be 
 from her birth the idol of slaves, and the 
 ruler of their master. A few days were 
 given to Mrs. Allen's business and the 
 child's repose in town, when they were 
 conducted to thehome which Heaven had 
 graciously destined for them. 
 
 Mr. Hardcastle's house was a fit abode 
 for its inmates, and from the hour it be-

 castle had given up a profession he never 
 loved, and relinquished the pursuits of 
 the barrister for those of the farmer, and

 dered his habitation an ornament to the 
 adjacent country. The little stranger 
 was met at Worcester by Mr. Hardcastle 
 and his two children. This excursion was

 Lucy Hardcastle had nearly attained 
 her eighth year, when her mother's du-

 Cowley. Horace, her brother, was not

 to that of the little stranger, that he soon 
 engrossed her favour and preference. Of 
 Lucy it might be said, that nature had 
 cast her in a mould so perfect, that for

 a very useful agent in her purposes of

 that Horace learnt, and she became sta-

 ing the probable effects of these early

 sufiice, that it was frequently observed 
 in the family, that the habit of yielding

 easy a lesson to Rachel Cowley, that she 
 practised compliance even with her maid-

 preference became more useful to her, and 
 more noticed by those around her; and

 was gratified by the effects v/hich had 
 resulted from the uniform principles of 
 her pupil's mind, and from which had 
 sprung the most promising of her hopes, 
 as these fondly contemplated the future 
 excellencies and happiness of a young 
 creature endeared to her heart by time,

 light the impetuosity of her dealing's

 of Horace's eye. But Mi\ Hardcastle,

 During this period of Miss Co^\'ley's 
 life, her father had gradually recovered 
 liis health and spirits ; urged by the re- 
 monstrances and arguments of his friends, 
 he had, on parting M'ith his daughter, em- 
 ployed his leisure, and diverted his mind 
 by building a house on a newly purchased 
 plantation nearer to Kingston, and within 
 the reach of a friend to whom he was 
 peculiarly attached. Amused by this 
 object of pursuit, he was led to other 
 improvements of the spot; and in his new 
 abode he saw another Eden bloom, 
 without the sad recollection which had 
 haunted his footsteps in the favourite 
 retreat of his still regreted wife and his 
 beloved child. Mr. Cowley, in conse- 
 quence of his multiplied avocations, and 
 the renewal of his social feelings, became 
 satisfied with mentioning from time to 
 time his intention of visiting England.

 his prudence concealed fram his ward a 
 subject of regret to liimself, and of con- 
 cern to his wife and Mrs. Allen. The 
 negro girl who had been selected, for the 
 sweetness of her temper and the graces 
 of nature, as the playmate in Miss Cow- 
 ley's nursery, had gained the notice of 
 her father, and had enjoyed Mrs. Alien's 
 attentions to her improvement in useful 
 learning. It had been debated wliether 
 Marian might not have been serviceable 
 to her young lady during the voyage : 
 the proposal had been rejected ; for 
 Mrs. Allen perfectly understood that the 
 comphances of a slave were not of that 
 sort which her pupil needed. She there- 
 fore left the girl to the care of the house- 
 keeper, and in a condition of ease and 
 comfort under Mrs. Cowley's roof Poor 
 Cowley was soothed in his first depres- 
 sion of spirits on losing sight of his idol, 
 by finding he had a sharer in his sorrow ;

 and he oTatified liis benevolence by beins^ 
 Marian's consoler. She in her turn 
 solaced his lonely hours by talking of 
 her *' dear missee," and accompanying 
 liini in his walks. Habits of affection 
 and kindness were thus nuitually formed, 
 and gave rise to an attachment incompa- 
 tible with innocence and honour. At an 
 early age jNIarian was formally emanci- 
 pated from her chains as a jiegro slave, 
 in order to bear the shackles of a mistress. 
 But in this deviation from his hitherto 
 regular and moral conduct, Mr. Cowley 
 forgot not decorin?i ; his favourite resided 
 with privacy at the more remote planta- 
 tion, which was called the Creek Savan- 
 nah, and he lived in the new house ah'cafly 
 mentioned. His Friends, who loved him, 
 overlooked a frailty which unfortunate!}- 
 was not particularly Mr. Cowley's weak* 
 ncss: butthey did more; for they attributed 
 his conduct to the steady pur{)0se of re- 
 maining unmarried for his daughters sake.

 Mr. Hard castle's opinions were not of 
 this pliant sort; but he well knew that 
 his arguments would be lost on a man 
 who had silenced his own principles of 
 religious observances : certain that Miss 
 Cowley had experienced no failure of 
 her father's affection or generosity, he 
 contented himself with performing his 
 duty, and providing against the conse- 
 quences so unavoidably connected with 
 Mr. Cowley's absence from his child. 
 He well knew, that without the recipro- 
 cal acts of love and duty, the ties of con- 
 sanguinity would be feeble. He had 
 daily proofs that Miss Cowley was little 
 affected by the protracted promises con- 
 tained in her father's letters; that her 
 happiness was centered in the bosom of 
 his family, and that the thought of being 
 separated from it, never occurred as with- 
 in the line of probability. Every means 
 of prudence had been applied to obviate 
 this evil. Conversations had been pur**

 ness; and her petitions to Heaven includ-

 of wisdom had not been lost on the 
 docile heart of the child. She listened 
 with pleasure to these tales of her ^* good 
 papa," and forgot him when clinging to 
 her *' mamma Hardcastle." As she ad- 
 vanced in age, Mr. and Afrs. Hardcastle 
 more assiduously attended to the views 
 before them; and with the entire persua- 
 sion of their own rninds, that the time 
 was rapidly approaching, vhen Mr. 
 Cowley would recal his daughter, they 
 endeavoured to prepare her for the sum- 
 mons. To this intent, Mrs. Hardcastle 
 sometimes read to her extracts from her 
 mother's letters, in which she described

 the activ^ity and benevolent cares which 
 supplied to her husband an indemnifica- 
 tion for the absence of his London

 Miss Cowley left no doubt on IVIrs. 
 Hardcastle's mind as to the impressions 
 which these letters and her conversa-

 father's settling in London, and a declar- 
 ed repugnance to living in Jamaica, were 
 the constant result of these attempts; 
 and it was now become necessary to call 
 upon a reason sufficiently cultivated to 
 yield an assent to every argument of 
 duty. Alarmed by an earnestness which 
 she considered as immediately springing 
 from Mr. Hardcastle's knowing her fa- 
 ther's intention of recalling her home, 
 she wrote to him a letter expressive of

 will remove her from the protecting arms 
 of " her dear Mrs. Hardcastle." He

 much occupied with different thoughts, 
 or too happy in the presence of her son

 banished him from his home, saw, with- 
 out shewing any inquietude, that time

 convulsively holding their hands in her

 lierself up to tears. The exhausted 
 invalid again dosed ; and she breathed 
 her last sigh, without further confirming 
 the ardent wishes of those to whom her 
 concurrence would have been a sanction 
 for that affection which both believed

 votaries: domestic comfort succeeded; 
 and Mr. Hardcastle in contemplating the

 that she could never have supported his

 will be your security. You stand be- 
 yond the reach of that mahce whicli 
 would dare to conceive that Hardcastle

 experienced the justness of this latter 
 observation ; for, with painful regret, it

 enjoyment of a fellow-commoner's gown. 
 Amongst the number of those who had

 Horace Hardcastle had become an in- 
 mate in Mr, Freeman's house, this noble- 
 man's son was also consigned to his un- 
 cle's care, for the twofold purposes of his 
 education and the preservation of his 
 
 health. Lord William S- had, from his 
 
 cradle, been extremely delicate; and in 
 proportion as he grew up, consumptive 
 symptoms had appeared. Scotland had 
 been judged too unfriendly a climate for 
 so tender a plant, and the duchess had 
 serious arguments to produce against 
 every public seminary of learning. The

 Devonshire promised an amendment in 
 health for his son. Mr. Freeman yielded 
 to a solicitation thus urged; and al- 
 though the pupil was not yet fourteen, 
 and intruded on the fixed number, he 
 was admitted. The amiable boy reach- 
 ed the priory before Horace had ceased 
 to repent his absence from Heathcot- 
 Farm ; and the young nobleman soon 
 found in him a companion more peculi- 
 arly attractive to his gentleness of tertt- 
 per, from the absence of that gaiety and 
 activity of spirit, which was so distin- 
 guished a characteristic of Ilorace/s 
 mind. Grateful to a youth, who, altlitjugh 
 bis senior, did not overlook him, as the 
 more advanced pupils did ; and who was 
 neither too wise for his amusement, nor 
 too insignificant for his associate, he 
 attached himself to Hardcastle, with all 
 the enthusiasm which results from warm 
 affections and an unpjerverted nature;

 and leaving to themselves the young 
 men whose attainments placed them 
 beyond their sphere of action, the newly 
 arrived pupils gradually cemented those 
 .bonds of friendship, which, with the vir- 
 tuous, not unfrequently prove the most 
 indissoluble. When Horace was sum- 
 moned to his mother's sick room, he had 
 left his companion under a severe at- 
 tack of the unrelenting cough ; and so 
 serious were now the symptoms of decay, 
 that it was determined he should try tlie 
 effects of sea-air and a voyage. A ves- 
 sel was prepared with the sole view to his 
 accommodation; a medical gentleman was 
 engaged to accompany him, and a tutor 
 was appointed for his guide and compa- 
 liion. Frequent voyages and short in- 
 tervals of refreshment in more southern 
 latitudes, were the objects of these ap- 
 rangements ; and the mild and uncom-

 at once into the flat and insipid same-

 and immediately applied to Mr. Freeman

 assuring him, that neither the young 
 gentleman's time nor interest should be 
 lost by a compliance with his request. 
 This proposal was the subject of Mr. 
 Freeman's letter to Horace's father; and 
 the plan recommended, was not only 
 favourable to Horace's future views, but 
 also advantageous to his further improve-

 easily imagined : his honour silenced the

 are sound ; I also knoNV', that in the pre- 
 sent delusion of your .senses, there is no 
 mixture of a sordid consideration in re- 
 gard to Miss Cowley's wealth. No, Ho- 
 race, you are too generous for such views, 
 and she is too attractive to need them. 
 But tell me, with what arguments would 
 you confute the charge so strongly to be 
 inferred from tiie circumstances in which 
 we are placed relatively to this young 
 lady, by her grand-mother's will? I 
 know Mr. Cowley, and I believe him to 
 be a liberal-minded man; but would 
 Horace Hardcastle fmd in an extorted 
 consent to his union with his daughter, 
 the approbation needful for his honour ? 
 Recollect, that a gift not freely bestowed, 
 is, and must be, oppressive to a noble 
 mind; and the tenderness and weakness 
 of a parent, who yields to the importu- 
 nities of a fond, love-sick girl, furnish 
 no excuse for the man who has fradu-

 expectations, by gaining an empire over 
 her affections. Be more just to yourself, 
 my son. You want not wealth to ele- 
 vate you, nor firmness to conquer your 
 present feelings. Be not deceived by the 
 enthusiasm which now governs you. 
 The good report of your fellow-creatures 
 is of more importance to your happiness 
 than you believe ; and from the censure 
 M'hich will involve you and myself of 
 having made a property of this lovely 
 girl, and cheated her unsuspecting and 
 generous father, there will be no appeal 
 even to the candid. "I will go," an- 
 swered Horace, his face crimsoned with 
 blushes, ** I will go to the farthest part 
 of the globe, to spare you from such ca- 
 lumny. But I must love Rachel Cowley, 
 or cease to live. Suffer me to depart

 him, if it please him, build hospitals 
 with his money: I shall not want it!" 
 ** Trusting to the effects of time and ab- 
 sence," answered Mr. Hardcastle, '^ I 
 will finish this conversation, by my po- 
 sitive prohibition of your corresponding 
 with Miss Cowley, eitlier directly or in- 
 directly, during your absence. I wish 
 you to receive this command, as qualified

 dear Horace, as well as yourself; trust 
 to your father; you may both change 
 your present sentiments. Leave her to 
 the only test of a permanent aifectionâ€” 
 more acquaintance with the world, and 
 more knowledge of herself. Her situa- 
 tion and sphere in life will soon be very 
 vilifierent from what they are at present. 
 The society and the pleasures of the 
 world will solicit her attention, and al*

 this amiable young woman. You will be 
 engaged in pursuits, which may, without 
 any miracle, direct your thoughts from 
 present objects ; and you may live to 
 feel, that Mr. Cowley's daughter is not 
 necessary to your happiness." Poor 
 Horace's agitations were not concealed. 
 ** Before we part," added the tender fa- 
 ther, ** let me assure you, that were this 
 young creature any but what she is^ I 
 would select her from amidst thousands 
 as a wife for my son. Let this assertion

 A short interval was allotted for the 
 young man's preparations in order to his 
 joining Lord William. Miss Cowley's 
 firmness not only supported this hour, 
 but also her friend Lucy's more tender 
 spirits. She spoke of Horace's departure 
 M'ith calmness, and observed from time 
 to time, that he could not better fill up 
 a year or too than by travelling. On 
 the morning he left the parental roof, 
 she further manifested her resolution and 
 spirit. Poor Horace rose to obey the 
 third or fourth summons which had an- 
 nounced that ^' all was ready." ^' We 
 part," said she, offering him her glowing 
 cheek, ** as brother and sister â€” such be 
 our adieux. But when next wc meet,

 and truth of Rachel Cowley. Thus I

 then darted from the room, leaving Mr.

 Hardcastle to his surprise, and to com- 
 fort his son. 
 
 A few weeks after Horace had quitted 
 England, Miss Cowley's tranquillity was 
 again interrupted. She had sent her 
 father, with some specimens of her own 
 talents in drawing, her picture at full 
 length; this was the w^ork of the first 
 artist in London, and was acknowledged 
 to be not only a capital picture, but also 
 a striking resemblance of her by those 
 friends who had seen it. IVIr. Cowley, 
 on receiving it, appears to have given 
 indulgence to all the feelings of nature, 
 in beholding the portrait of a child so 
 dear to him, an object of delight and 
 admiration to his friends. He praises the 
 design, the attitude; in a word, the skill 
 of the painter in the highest terms. 
 *' But," adds he, *' if such be thy exter- 
 nal endowments, he has had a subject for 
 his labours worthy of them." He cou-

 tinues in this stile of gaiety to inform 
 her, that, notwithstanding *' the hazel 
 eyes," which are said to be his gift, he 
 thinks she so much resembles her mother, 
 that he had placed her picture opposite 
 to her mothers portrait; and that he 
 passes from one to the otiier, with sensa.- 
 tations at once pleasurable and painful. 
 *' Your arriv^al, in the mean time," con- 
 tinues he, *Mias been celebrated by a 
 grand dinner, to which my friends re- 
 sorted in crowds. Curiosity and admira- 
 tion at length gave place to a contest

 pions were Captain Vernon and your 
 old friend Oliver Flint, whom you will 
 remember as your favourite, although 
 you threw your v/ax doll at his head, 
 because he said it was prettier than Ma- 
 rian. As to your other valorous knight,

 had he not been arrack-proof as com- 
 pletely as he is salt-water proof, he had 
 been a dead man; for by maintaining 
 your cause he has had a fever, which 
 frightened his poor wife into a sick bed." 
 This letter finishes by mentioning the 
 arrival of two strangers in Jamaica; 
 namely, a gentleman of the name of 
 Flamall, with his nephew, Mr. Philip 
 Flint, the posthumous brother of Mr. 
 Oliver Flint, the gentleman already men- 
 tioned in his letter. " My worthy old 
 friend," continues Mr. Cowley, ** has 
 drooped ever since the. loss of liis sons. 
 I do not wonder that this has been the 
 case. They had been his support under 
 the severe trials of losing a good wife, 
 and several other children. They ha4 
 attained to an age in which he might, 
 and had reasonably hoped to find in 
 them a support and comfort to his grave.

 In one week an epidemic fever rendered 
 him childless. Poor Oliver was for a time 
 overwhelmed by this dreadful blow; but 
 the constitution of his mind and body 
 have saved him. He turned his thoughts 
 to remedy his grief, not to repinings for 
 an affliction sent him, as he said, * for 
 his good;* and he has found one in this 
 young brother, whom he never knew till 
 lately. This child was the fruit of his 
 father's second marriage, who died at an 
 advanced age, leaving his young widow 
 pregnant. The young man's name is 
 Philip, and liis age nearly that of poor 
 Oliver's eldest son, who was also christ- 
 ened Philip. On this slight conformity 
 the good old man erected his hopes of 
 supplying to himself an heir and a conso- 
 lation. The appearance of this young 
 man, who is accompanied by his ma- 
 ternal uncle Mr. Flam all, has renovated 
 poor Oliver. He is, indeed, a most pro- 
 mising and handsome young man, and

 my friend already fancies he resembles 
 ^lis son: no one contests this point with 
 him; nor is there any one who does not 
 think the young man worthy of his 
 brother's protection. He is well educated, 
 and his manners are pleasing and polite, 
 though rather too reserved and circum- 
 spect for some amongst us. These stran- 
 gers have made a rake of me for som^ 
 time; but I have refused to dine with 
 the heir apparent, in order to write to 
 you more at my leisure. Since your 
 picture has graced my saloon, your old 
 friend Oliver can talk of nothing but 
 getting a wife for his idol; and this 
 morning Mr. Flamall explicitly began a 
 negotiation for my girl, stating his 
 nephew's great expectations from his 
 sister, an old maiden lady, whose name 
 is Lucretia Flint. This, with Mr. Flint's 
 fortune, is a bait, but not one for your 
 father, my child. I have not forgotten 
 your dear mother : to her undivided af-

 fection, not her money, was I indebted 
 for my happiness ; and, instead of years 
 passed in contention and wretchedness, 
 I had the satisfaction of knowing; tliat 
 my wife preferred her husband to his 
 rival, although that rival was her mother, 
 I do not believe you have been instruct- 
 ed to despise a man, simply because he 
 stands well in your father's opinion ; nor 
 will that father, my dear child, bargain 
 away your liappiness, in order to add 
 acre to acre. I told Mr. Flamall, with 
 more jocularity than seriousness, that 
 I meant to see my girl before I gave her 
 away, and to know the value of my 
 merchandise before I sold it. Be not, 
 however, surprised should you see your 
 old friend Mr. Flint; for, coward as he 
 is, I verily beheve lie would cross the 
 Atlantic in a boat to plead with you for 
 his darling Philip." 
 
 Kind as this letter was, it alarmed

 JVIiss Cowley. She once more renewed 
 her entreaties on the subject of her father's 
 leaving Jamaica; and in the most un- 
 equivocal terms declared her repugnance 
 to any matrimonial overtures. " Let me 
 conjure you, my dear Sir," urged the ap- 
 prehensive pleader, " to return to Eng* 
 land, and to renew with me those en- 
 dearing ties of an undivided duty and 
 the purest gratitude. I seek to emulate 
 my mother, but it shall be in first shew- 
 ing that I am your child, and not as a 
 wife. Oh, let me for a time be your own 
 Rachel Cowley !" 
 
 The father's reply to this appeal to his 
 heart restored Miss Cowley to her usual 
 cheerfulness. He good-humouredly ral- 
 lies her on the needless rhetoric she em- 
 ployed to restrain the ardoui^s of a lover, 
 apparently as little disposed to be 
 shackled as her herself. " From the 
 little I have seen of this young philoso-

 left his heart behind hiin ; for our nota- 
 ble mothers, ^vho are nibbling at the 
 prize, can make nothing of him, and the 
 girls already call him the stoic. I M^as

 had been engaged in taking a drawing 
 from your picture whilst I was at Oliver's 
 with a gay party of ladies and gentlemen, 
 and from which young Philip had con- 
 trived to absent himself for a long time. 
 Vernon doubted of this employment of 
 the youngster's time ; ' but ;be this as it 
 may,' added he, with his usual blunt- 
 ness, ' I tell you that young Flint will 
 never do for a suitor for Miss Cowley, 
 whatever he may for her picture ; she 
 would laugh at him.' Mr. Flamall was 
 not much pleased by this frankness, and 
 he coldly replied, that he presumed

 and whilst all the world acknowledge 
 her beauty, she shews them that she will 
 not easily be won.' I shall spare my 
 pen the labour of writing the remainder 
 of his rhapsodies ; but he finished by 
 telling Flamall that he could recommend 
 a wife to his nephew, who would exactly 
 jsuit him; and that was Miss Lucy Hard-

 lady satisfied Flamall that the honest 
 captain did not think his nephew un- 
 deserving of a good wife, though disqua-

 however, reason to believe I shall hear no

 poor Vernon found at his return many 
 niourners to sympathize with him in a 
 sorrow leo^itimatelv founded on his know- 
 ledge of the man, and on gratitude to 
 his benefactor. We will pass over in 
 silence the effects which this melancholy 
 intelligence produced at Heathcot-Farm. 
 Miss Cowley was roused from the deep- 
 est dejection of spirits by the events 
 which succeeded to the first shock. Mr. 
 Steadman summoned her and Mr. Hard- 
 castle to London ; and with precautions, 
 which he judged necessary, placed be- 
 fore the orphan a copy of her late father's 
 will, which, with all its requisite docu- 
 ments, had been formerly sent to him by 
 the executor, Mr. Flamall. 
 
 The contents were, indeed, calculated 
 to astonish and afflict his daughter. She

 These children were boys, the eldest not

 her opinion, and with great firmness said,

 The dignity which she assumed, the 
 acuteness of her observations, and the 
 absence of those feais which the gentle-

 at once to understand that the client was 
 not a minor in good sense. The coun-

 from him without a struggle on his part. 
 The means of justice are slow, and we 
 must contrive to counteract his villany, 
 not to dispute his right to be a villain. 
 Have patience, my dear iMiss Cowley, I 
 have more than once caught a rascal in 
 his own toils. A false will cannot easily 
 be produced without confederates ; some- 
 thing may transpire, for rogues are rare-

 that you are at liberty to refuse the hus- 
 band he has so carefully provided for 
 you. You want nothing from Jamarca, 
 and in a few vears vou will be mistres's

 difficulties with a man certainly disqua- 
 hfied for their guardian. We will know

 Miss Cowley assented to this advice, 
 and determined to be governed by her 
 zealous friend ; secretly hoping, that 
 the restrictions of her father's will, to 
 which she appeared disposed to submit, 
 would at least secure her from the solici- 
 tations of lovers ; and thus silence Mr. 
 Hardcastle's scruples in regard to his 
 son. 
 
 Before she left Mr. Steadman, she saw 
 her formal rejection of Mr. Philip Flint 
 dispatched to her new guardian. Coun- 
 sellor Steadman wrote this letter, and 
 Miss Cowley's attestation of its being 
 dictated by her, satisfied her, that she 
 had crushed the hopes of the insolent 
 pretender to her hand. Her natural 
 cheerfulness returned, and Lucy found 
 her friend the better for the little jour-

 lasted not many months ; a letter from 
 ^Ir. Flaniall, which it is necessary to 
 transcrihe here, will assign the cause of 
 new anxieties at Heath cot- Farm. Mr. 
 Flamall, who seemed to consider Mr. 
 Steadman as the only friend of Miss 
 Cowley, and, as a professional man, the 
 proper medium through which his autho- 
 rity was to he announced to the heiress, 
 thus writes to him : 
 
 '* Bound as I am hy the duties of my 
 appointed trust, and prompted by my 
 veneration and gratitude to fulfd in every 
 point Mr. Cowley's intentions, as these 
 related to his daughter, I think it pro- 
 per to remove Miss Cowley from her 
 present residence. From the period of 
 !Mrs. Hardcastle's death, her father had 
 this intention ; and I have frequently 
 heard him regret, that his delay, and her 
 reluctance to visit Jamaica, had post-

 poned a resolution he thought inclispett- 
 siblj incumbent on him to execute. In 
 his last iUness he requested me to make 
 it my first concern to place bis daughter 
 with a lady qualified to protect and guide 
 her. I have, in consequence, written to 
 my sister, Lady Maclairn, on this subject, 
 and you will prepare my ward fi^r her 
 removal to Tarefield, the place of my 
 sister's residence. I am not discouraged 
 hy Miss Cowley's refusal of my nephew. 
 She does not know Philip Flint, who- 
 will, I am confident, convince her, and 
 her friends, that her father was not les8 
 attentive to her happiness than to her 
 fortune, in selecting him as her protector 
 for fife. More on this subject does not 
 become me to say, less would be injus- 
 tice to anmn whose merits are acknow- 
 ledged wherever he is known. I will not, 
 however, pursue this smhject furthei? at

 good father's wishes. In the mean tim^ 
 my nephew has cheerfnlly acceded to 
 mine ; and flatters himself, that by post- 
 poning his voyage to England for some 
 months, he is not only gratifying Miss 
 Cowley's delicacy in this hour of filial 
 sorrow, but also offering her an homage 
 which will not be unacceptable to her, 
 as it v/ill be of use to her interest ; Mr. 
 Cowley's large concerns requiring an in- 
 spection, and an arrangement which, in 
 the fii'st pressure of business, is more 
 than I am equal to. The retirement iu 
 which Sir Murdock Maclairn's family 
 lives, will not, in the present state of 
 af^Pairs, be irksome to my ward ; the so- 
 ciety of an accomplished woman will, I 
 hope, compensate her for the temporary 
 suspension of more unconfined amuse- 
 ments. Taking it for granted, that you

 by Mrs. Dawson's will, I shall annually 
 remit to Sir Murdock Maclairn the same 
 sum which Mr. Cowley assigned for his 
 daughter's maintenance with Mr. Hard- 
 castle, from the age of infancy. Being 
 willing to shcM^ my respect for Miss Cow- 
 ley's wish, as this relates to Mrs. Allen's 
 continuance in her service, I have pre- 
 pared Lady Maclairn to receive what she 
 might otherwise judge an useless appen- 
 dage in a house regulated as Tarefield-

 forming his correspondent, that Miss 
 Cowley's fortune is very ample ; that he 
 has to encounter the obstinacy of the 
 boys' mother, who will not be parted 
 from the children, nor suffer them to 
 remain in their father's house. Mr. Phi- 
 lip Flint had, however, compromised 
 matters ; and the mother and children 
 were placed by him in the family of a

 had known at the university, in Edin-

 handsome, promising children ; and he 
 had no fears for them, but such as arose 
 from the ignorance and excessive fond- 
 ness of their mother, whom he always 
 thought unworthy of the place she had 
 held in Mr. Cowley's heart. It was, how- 
 ever, his intention to send the children 
 to England for education, with his ne- 
 phew, if he could prevail on the mother 
 to consult their real good. Statements 
 of effects in a general way, and details 
 of his conduct, as regulated by the dy- 
 ing words of Mr. Cov/ley, in regard to 
 the negroes on the plantations, to whom 
 he had been a father, finish Mr. Flamall's

 The truth is, that, as I have only the

 to place before you the history of a family

 hatred. I leave to you to sift and resift 
 tlie documents thus ohtained : for my 
 history includes a number of years and 
 facts which are still the topics of conver- 
 sation in this neighbourhood. 
 
 *' Flamall was, as you have heard, for 
 some years a practitioner in the law; and 
 succeeded his father intlie business of an 
 attorney, with the credit which that father 
 left him, who was a,n honest and an able 
 man. His sister, now Lady Maclairn, was 
 left to his direction, and, to the surprise of 
 old Flamall's connections, to her bro- 
 ther's generosity. She was young and 
 remarkably handsome, had been carefully 
 and liberally educated, and was a virtu- 
 ous and elegant young woman ; but from 
 some proofs of her brother's intentions, 
 of making her subservient to his ambi- 
 tion or vices, she sheltered her own in- 
 nocence by accepting the hand of old 
 j\Ir. Flint, then in his seventieth year;

 and in the full blaze of beauty, not being 
 more than four or five and twenty, she 
 appeared as a bride at Tarefield-hall. 
 Mr. Flint at this period had four chil- 
 dren. Oliver, his eldest son, was settled 
 in Jamaica, had married there, and was 
 the father of a family. Lucretia, the 
 present despot at the hall, was single ; 
 but something older than the bride. 
 Percival Flint, the second son, had just 
 finished his academical studies, and had 
 quitted Oxford. Mary Fhnt, the young- 
 est of the family, was then about seven- 
 teen, and in one word, a paragon of per^ 
 fectmi, for such my authorities proclaim 
 her. Domestic feuds and discontents 
 still kept their ground, in spite of thÂ« 
 young mother-in-law ; who, it appears, 
 was little calculated to maintain even her 
 own rights ; she sunk into a nurse to 
 her husband. Percival Flint left his 
 father's house secretly, and for some

 the neighbourhood to have fallen a vic- 
 tim to misery. Mr. Flamall had an 
 active part in all the transactions at 
 this period. He was useful to the infirm 
 father of the family, in managing his 
 business; and his ill treatment of his 
 own sister, gave him favour with Miss 
 Lucretia Flint. Love now engaged in 
 the struggle for power. A new curate, 
 of the name of Howard, appeared at 
 Tarefield. ]\Iiss Lucretia made love to 
 him ; and he made love to the beautiful 
 Mary Flint. Here again I could fill 
 volumes with the praises and blessings 
 still given to this matchless pair ! After 
 many trials, and the utmost cruelty from 
 the jealous sister, the lovers married. 
 Mr. Flint's death is the next event. He 
 left a will, which utterly excluded Per- 
 cival Flint and Mrs. Howard, his darling 
 child, from any portion of his property 
 beyond a shilling. The Jamaica e.otate

 became his eldest son's, and Miss Lucre- 
 tia became the mistress of Tarefield-hallj 
 with a large sum in money, some say, 
 not less than thirty thousand pounds. 
 The young widow had her provision of 
 four hundred pounds per annum, for her 
 life, on the Tarefield estate, and her name 
 was not even in the will but in order to 
 ascertain this claim. A new wonder suc- 
 ceeded to this. In a short time after the 
 funeral, Mrs. Flint declared herself preg- 
 nant; and to the astonishment of every 
 one, Miss Flint received the intelligence 
 with joy, and observed, it was an event 
 for which Mr. Flint had prepared her. 
 She was happy ; for it would now appear, 
 that her father had chosen her for the 
 stewardship of that fortune destined to 
 be shared with a child who had not 
 offended him. The odious title of mo- 
 ther-in-law was forgotten, and she called 
 Mrs. Flint her friend and sister : by 
 this latter appellation they still call each

 whose health was in a very precarious 
 state, to London^ There PhiHp Fhnt 
 was born ; I need not a(Ul, that this post- 
 liunious child is the young man wlio

 suppressed the affecting stories of Mr.

 untimely death. They left a daughter, 
 who is the idoi of her parents' partia'l 
 friends : till lately, she has lived with a 
 wealthy farmer, where also boards her 
 uncle Percival. She is now, I am told, 
 noticed at the hall, and I believe she is 
 under ]Miss Lucretia's protection. But to 
 proceed.

 Observe here, that the Duke of

 knew the baronet. Miss Flint, whose 
 best actions are viewed only in one di-

 judges, was however useful to the poor 
 widow Flint on this occasion. The 
 union was effected by her mediation, 
 without an open rupture with the domi-

 tlie current report of the hall being

 it ought never to be trusted ; and to the

 Sometimes, a too late conviction that

 permanent affection, is discovered to be 
 nothing more than a flight of youthful

 though disappointed in her wishes of 
 gaining permission to write to her 
 brother Horace, it may be at least 
 conjectured, that the opposition she 
 had been unable to conquer, did the

 that she attributed Mr. Hardcastle's 
 conduct to a pride and scrupulo-

 and deficient in kindness to her.

 The question has been decided, and 
 reason tells me, that in a difficulty which 
 admits of no other alternative but that 
 of either laughing or crying, it is but to 
 take that which will least disagree Math 
 my constitution. You have, my dear 
 Lucy, called me many times a twin

 to repress in me the superabundance of 
 her spirit and flippancy, remains Avith

 with my usual eagerness, and taking his 
 hand, "I bless Providence for conduct-

 forces me to quit Heathcot. I will love

 as the child of my bosom. She will be 
 guarded by a vigilance equal to your 
 own and i\Ir. Hardcas tie's. As a deposit 
 sent by Heaven, I will receive her." Do 
 you know that I was so affected that I 
 wept, and repented of having urged 
 him to this explanation. Mr. Steadman 
 assured him, that he was perfectly satis* 
 fied, and the conversation gradually 
 became less interesting. I mentioned 
 with diffidence my friend Mrs. Allen. 
 " My wife will rejoice to find you bring a 
 companion with you," said he; " she 
 fears that you will think Tarefield very 
 dull. My bad health has produced a 
 love of home in her, as well as myself,

 ** this is folly, neither the weaknesses nor

 and yet he can lay a snare for me. How-

 at, in the subject before me; yet, Lucy, 
 in the dearth of all rational amusement, in 
 a separation from all whom I love, do you 
 think I can want an excuse for my pen,

 neither my compassion nor goodnature

 case, Sir Murdock Maclairn would be 
 the most unsuitable dish for the cravings 
 of my hunger. It is, however, most as-

 surprise, but the most powerful incite-

 tinged by Scotch snuff, which he takes 
 in immoderate quantities; a long crane

 narrow black stock; a few scattered 
 hairs, Avhich still maintain their car- 
 roty colour, tyed in a queue; a sunk, 
 though broad chest, and a plaintive 
 voice, in which however are cadences to 
 please the ear whilst attending to an ar-

 Add to this picture, an abstracted manner, 
 and an air of sadness; and you will not 
 be astonished that I should for a few 
 minutes fancy Malvolio present, and that 
 I looked for *'his yellow stockings and 
 cross garters." The eagerness with which 
 he gazed upon me strengthened my 
 imagination, and I did not dare to smile, 
 lest I should hear him say â€” 
 
 ** Thou canst not chuse but know who I am : 
 If thou entertainest my love, let it appear by thy 
 
 smiling. 
 
 Thy smiles become thee well." 
 
 At this moment my eyes encountered 
 those of Sir Murdock's, and my heart 
 smote me ; for in language more touch- 
 ing than sounds of harmony could im- 
 part, they said, " Pity me, for I am the 
 child of sorrow ; respect me, for I am 
 acquainted with grief." I blushed, and

 For several days, however, I could not 
 reconcile myself to the keenness and pe- 
 culiar attention Avith which these large 
 blue eyes surveyed me. An expression 
 in them of a famished look (I cannot 
 better define its eagerness) yielded, as he 
 continued to gaze on my face, to a 
 melancholy softness, not unfrequently 
 heightened by a tear; but I found that 
 he was subject to an absence of mind, 
 which it appears has resulted from many 
 years bad health and low spirits. Tbis, 
 with his ceremonious demeanour, and the 
 no inconsiderable degree of his national 
 accent, render him pecuharly singular. 
 Not expecting much amusement on the 
 road with a companion to whom you 
 may speak half a score times before he is 
 sensible you expect an answer, I took 
 care to provide myself with a book ; and, 
 by chance, I robbed the counsellor of 
 Macpherson's Ossian. The united libra- 
 ries of the ancient and modern world,

 could not have better supplied me with 
 an author calculated to rouse the atten- 
 tion of Sir Murdock. I was tempted to 
 read aloud some passages, and he listen- 
 ed with a feeling that surprisedma:) 
 the sorrows of Malvina. " Have you 
 never read Ossian ?" asked I. ** If I 
 have," replied he, ^'1 have forgotten 
 him during an indisposition that left me 
 nothing but a capacity to feel my own 
 wretchedness." A deep sigh and the 
 depression of his head silenced me. He 
 soon urged me for more of my book; 
 but I was grieved that I had introduced 
 to his acquaintance a work so powerfully 
 calculated to *' awaken fancy, and to 
 touch the heart'* of the poor baronet. 
 
 I cannot describe to you the enthusi- 
 astic bursts of feeling and admiration 
 which followed every sublime passage 1 
 selected ; and his tears flowed to the pa- 
 thetic touches of the poet^ **I will read

 mour and closing the book : " Ossian is, 
 to a mind like yours, a bad writer." 
 " There is a joy in grief, when peace 
 dwells in the breast of the mourner," an- 
 swered he in a plaintive tone. " It may 
 be so,'' replied I, ** but the mourner 
 ought to remember, ' that sorrow wastes 
 him." *' I do not attribute my faintness 
 to grief," observed Mrs. Allen laughing, 
 *' but to downright hunger; and I must 
 beg to stop at the next stage for some- 
 thing more substantial than Ossian." Sir 
 Murdock instantly began his apology 
 for his omission at the last inn. *' I for- 
 got," said he, " that every one could not 
 hke myself fast twenty-four hours with- 
 out inconvenience. Early habit has 
 made abstemioiisness of no account with 
 me," added he, '^ I have fasted six-and-

 compassion his lank figure. " I had then 
 other cares," answered he; ** my soul,, 
 like that of Oithana,. was not as care-^ 
 less as the sea which lifts its blue waves^ 
 to every wind, and rolls beneath the 
 storm." He fixed his eyes on my face, 
 and spoke no more till we reached our 
 destined post-house. Here Mrs. Allen's 
 orders were quickly obeyed, and we 
 pressed him to take some refreshment 
 with us ; and to judge by the voracious- 
 ness of his appetite, he must have ex- 
 ceeded his usual time of fasting. We 
 were, however, too well pleased with the 
 effects of ham and cold chicken on him, 
 as well as on ourselves, to trust to his 
 memory for a repetition of the cordial ; 
 and Mrs. Allen undertook the manage- 
 ment of us for the remainder of the 
 journey. The replenished baroiiet be- 
 came more and moje conversible as we

 of cheerfulness, and finding that I per- 
 sisted in keeping back the ^' tales of the 
 times of old," till he, like other poor 
 mortals, eat three meals a day, he con-

 western isles of his beloved Scotland ; 
 and with evident delight lie traced a 
 similarity of manners and customs be- 
 tween his country and ancient Greece, 
 marking with precision the common 
 features of resemblance that had struck 
 him between the heroes of Ossian and 
 Homer. From this learned dissertation 
 he condescended to talk of France, in 
 which country he had passed his youth. 
 He praised my accent, and seemed pleas- 
 ed that I knew the language, speaking 
 with rapture some passages from Racine. 
 *'Do you also understand Italian ?" asked 
 he. I replied, '^ As a schoof-girU' He

 when it was as familiar to me as ray

 her persuasions he had yielded reluctant-

 it would be beneficial to my health and 
 spirits; and these are of value to me, 
 because essential to her happiness.'* He 
 spoke with animation of her faithful love, 
 and added, " She is now counting the 
 hours till she sees me."

 Durham we left the road, and pursued our

 any thing cheerful ; and reached Tare-

 as having been originally built in^ that 
 style of architecture for which we are 
 indebted to William the III. and Dutch 
 taste ; but as each successive proprietor 
 conceived his own to be as good, and 
 had money for its indulgence, it exhibits

 embellishes the dull scenery around.

 ception of the heiress; and I was re- 
 ceived with much form and some parade 
 in the best parlour. But as nature had 
 not been consuhed in these arrangements, 
 she chose to spoil them ; for poor lady 
 Maclairn, instead of remembering her 
 compliments, rushed into her husband's 
 arms and wept. It was no longer Mai- 
 volio, Lucy ! No; it was the toil-worn 
 * Ulysses soothing his faithful Penelope. 
 The picture was complete; for an old 
 spaniel was licking his feet at the 
 moment. I cannot take a more favour- 
 able time for giving you a sketch of 
 Lady Maclairn's person ; for whilst her 
 beautiful black eyes w^ere still humid ^ 
 with tears of joy, and her delicate face 
 suffused with the mixed emotions of 
 contentment and a recollection of her 
 neglect of the strangers, I forgot she 
 was Flam all's sister.

 I should judge Lady Maclairn to be 
 nearly fifty years old ; she is of the middle 
 size and elegantly formed. Her beauty 
 is of that sort which I have heard called 
 pure English; namely, hair approaching 
 to black, black eyes, and a complexion 
 of the finest texture and colour. Her 
 features are small and regular. She is 
 extremely pale, but not with the hue of 
 sickness ; and it behoves Lady Maclairn 
 to think aright, for every feeling of her 
 mind is accompanied by a soft blush on 
 lier face. This, with a certain timidity 
 and peculiar gentleness of manners, ren- 
 ders her appearance more feminine and 
 youthful than matronly ; yet she is 
 graceful, and speaks with propriety and 
 judgment So far my conscience ac- 
 quits me of malice. 
 
 She had no sooner finished her flut- 
 tered M^elcome, than she presented to me

 kidnapped him, and made the tour of

 torches was silenced, and I talked with 
 Malcolm Maclairn of a country and a 
 route which he appeared to know perfectly. 
 
 Miss Flint at length with much gra- 
 vity asked how long we should have to 
 wait for supper. Mrs. Allen requested 
 permission to retire to lier room hefore it 
 was. served, pleading a slight sense of 
 fatigue. The cou:teous mistress of the 
 mansion accompanied us to the destined 
 apartments, and with the utmost solici- 
 tude for Mrs. Allen's accommodation, 
 urged her to have a maid-servant to

 In a few minutes my attention was

 with the same light foot, when she hesi-

 I never beheld so lovely a girl !" ** She is 
 indeed, a very beautiful creature," an- 
 swered Lady IMaclairn in an under-toned 
 voice. *' She is Afiss Flint's niece, and

 supping room ; and I eagerl}' looked for 
 the niece, recollecting Mr. Woodley's

 hot lobster, " Mary does not sup with

 as if to whistle, and his knuckles gave 
 the tune of *'The Babes in the Wood." 
 I became tired in a minute, and as dry 
 as the dry toast I swallowed. Willing 
 to reserve my petulant humour for this 
 ungracious aunt's sole use, I retired to my 
 room as soon as the cloth was removed.

 I found, as I had suspected, the inde- 
 fatigable Mrs. Allen still engaged in 
 arranging her pefs clothes. Before I 
 could begin my lecture she eagerly asked 
 mc whether I had seen Miss Flint's or-

 " but after you left me I began to unpack

 were brought and placed on the table. 
 Some little time after, some one tapped

 added slie, placing her dainties on the 
 table, *' let me try to uncord that box 
 whilst you take some refreshment." 
 Thinkino; from her dress that she was a 
 domestic, I complied and sat down to 
 eat my supper: during this interval I 
 looked at her with admiration; which 
 soon changed to pity, Avhen I saw how 
 delicate she was. and what hands I had 
 employed. '* I beg," said I, *' you will 
 cut the cord, you seem no more equal 
 to it than myself. You are not strong,- 
 my poor child ; your labours, I trust are 
 light here." She blushed, and her sweet 
 eyes filled with tears. *' My feebleness 
 is a misfortune," replied she, ** which I 
 owe in part to the tenderness with which 
 I was reared. I lament it, although my 
 station in this family imposes no labour 
 on me: I am Miss Flint's niece." I made 
 a thousand excuses. '^ Indeed, Madam,

 envy the condition of those in every cliass 
 of Hfe, who are able to fill up usefully 
 that station to which Providence calls 
 them ; too much care, too much tender- 
 ness have, I fear, unfitted me for mine." 
 She again dissolved into tears. *' I 
 should not have said thus much," added, 
 she, "for I have nothing to regret, but 
 being a burden to my relations. Your

 form you that Mary Howard lost every

 girl took the friendly hint and hastily 
 withdrew. I now employed the maid to 
 untie the trunk, and, with my praise of 
 Miss Howard, mentioned something of 
 my error. " No wonder," said she, witli 
 honest indignation, '' dressed as she is ! 
 But she is Mr. Howard's child for all 
 that, and would ])e so in rags. Such 
 relations ! say I: I woidd weed in a ditch

 bell sounded, and the girl withdrew, 
 saying, ^* You will soon see, Madau),

 Mrs. Allen, '' what will you do, my dear 
 child, in a house where a niece envies

 found there had been no difference made 
 in the accommodations prepared for the 
 heiress and her /r;e^2^. It was well: for, 
 is she not my friend? Did not my dying

In stature, Miss Howard is about my

 of form, so completely Grecian that you 
 must look for her model in the gallery

 the more, she wears her hght-brown 
 locks, nearly flaxen, braided up and 
 fastened round lier head, whilst a black 
 ribband confines the redundancy of the 
 ringlets from covering her snoivy fore-' 
 head ; her eyes are the darkest blue I ever

 owing that I never yet saw eyes so ex- 
 pressive at once of spirit and softness :

 to the lieart by the imploring l6ok of' 
 infant- trust^and confidence; at another, 
 they bespeak a soul Avithin, equal to the

 the throne, was the common one for the 
 whole multitude of countenances that 
 filled the room. Weary of looking at 
 this odious tapestry, I arose, and explored 
 my way into the garden. Here, indeed, 
 I found the sweet perfumes of nature and 
 the god of day; but for the rest let the 
 poet speak â€”

 And half the platform just reflects the other;

 tapestry in the bed-chamber, soon tired 
 me ; and seeing the servants about, 
 I sauntered into the avenue. Here the 
 horse-chesnut trees, in all their pride, at- 
 tracted my attention for a few minutes; 
 but I was soon allured towards- an object 
 still more inviting. Mary was before mc,

 saluted me with the usual compliments.

 not idle. She said I was very good ;

 her the pleasure of walking in a morning

 She would, however, endeavour to gain

 asked me whether he had not frightened

 easier experiment," replied he, smiling, 
 ** and you will succeed by only engaging 
 to marry her idol." *' Were I but pri- 
 vileged," answered I, *' you should see 
 her perfectly tamed by my employing 
 nothing more than her own arts of tor-^ 
 nienting. I doubt not but in the first in- 
 stance her idol, as you call her young 
 brother, secured his power in this way.'* 
 *' Indeed you are mistaken," said he, 
 ^' Philip Flint was ever mindful of his 
 own honour, though grateful for an af- 
 fection, unbounded in its liberality to 
 him.*' 
 
 Lady Maclairn's appearance prevented 
 more. She came to summons us to break- 
 fast, and with the utmost frankness told 
 me that she had been to pay her respects 
 to Mrs. Allen, who was very busy with

 fast and a maid-servant into her apart- 
 ment. She conducted me, whilst chat- 
 ting, to the '' Old Wing," in which Miss 
 Flint more partic^ularly holds her state; 
 and we found her richly decorated, and 
 waiting for us at a tea-board most splen- 
 didly set out. Sir Murdock had mecha- 
 nically, I suspect, followed our steps, 
 and entered the room with us. Miss 
 Lucretia's face flushed a deeper dye. 
 ** Good God, Sir Murdock!" exclaimed 
 she, you are enough to frighten one in 
 tJ^at trim:' " Did I frighten you?" 
 asked he in a plaintive tone, and with a 
 look which would have softened any 
 Flint but the one before him. He was 
 retreating. ** I will hav^e no infringe- 
 ment of our treaty of amity," cried I 
 gaily, and gently placing him on the 
 sofa beside me. ^* It is my turn to 
 frighten you to-morrow morning, by 
 shewing myself in my wrapping gown

 Avith ceremony and constraint : let those 
 have it who fancy tliey are never dress- 
 ed without white- fingered gloves." I 
 glanced my saucy eyes on Miss Flint's 
 starched muslins; she perceived the ap- 
 plication, hut I was en ti^ain; and affect- 
 ing to he hungry, I took a roll and di- 
 vided it between mv silentneiohbour and 
 myself; and finding I^dy Maclairn was 
 to preside at the silver tea-board, I im- 
 patiently begged a cup of chocolate. 
 Then, with well-counterfeited recollec- 
 tion, I said, "But wheie is Miss Howard } 
 she is better entitled to her breakfast 
 than I am, for she was walking before 
 me." Mary does not breakfast with me,*' 
 replied Miss Flint, " she has it in her own 
 room." *' I am glad I have so good a 
 precedent to produce for my humour,'! 
 answered I, '* though it deprives me of

 swered with much haughtiness. *^ As a 
 stranger, Miss Cowley," said she gravely, 
 ** it may surprise you, to find so near a re- 
 lation of mine under restrictions v/liich I 
 deem proper. ]\Iary knows my views; 
 these extend no farther than to make her 
 riseful, and to qualify her for the station 
 in life which the imprudent conduct of 
 her parents has destined her to fill. She 
 must be humble. " Besides," continued 
 she, relaxing into more civihty, *' your 
 praises of her beauty quite alarm me, 
 and would turn her silly head. She is 
 young, and vain and silly enough to 
 think herself a very pretty girl." -^^ Why,

 **how in the name of common sense, can 
 ]\Iiss Howard think otlierwise of a face 
 and a person so exquisitely formed, and 
 so consonant to every idea she can have 
 of beauty and grace ?" *' Oh, as to that 
 point," answered she with a toss of her 
 liead, "she will soon discover, if her 
 pride do not stand in her way, ** tliat 
 beauty is all fancy, and the face she 
 worsliips may not be tliouglit wortli a 
 second look by another." '^ I grant," 
 answered I, '* tlie justness of your obser- 
 vation in a general way: I know that 
 our ideas of beauty are in many instan- 
 ces local, and depend on taste; I will do 
 more, I will grant, that in many parts of

 sonal charms might be regarded as defor-

 secures her from any competition with

 her, have given the power of attraction 
 and the tribute of admiration." " You 
 may say what you->"6l]/* rephed Miss 
 Lucretia, with an asperity of tone in 
 unsonwith her harsh features;" but I 
 wish from my soul this poor girl had no 
 bsauty. We have had enough of tliat 
 perishable commodity in our family ! 
 Besides," added she^ softening her voice, 
 *^ you appear to have overlooked a lesson 
 which every handsome girl ought to 
 know. I have heard many sensible men^ 
 Miss Cowley, observe, that the best 
 sauce for the relish of beauty, is the 
 ignorance which the possessor has of its 
 power to call forth admiration, or to 
 attract notice and favour." 'â€¢ I should

 I, *^ that I well knew the taste for ^ Mo-^

 Ignorance is more friendly to the sen- 
 sualist than to the moralist; and I always 
 suspect those who wish to see a young- 
 woman unconscious of her own advan- 
 tages. It is also, in my opinion, illiberal^ 
 and unjust to c ^ dude that a woman 
 is vain because she is handsome. A 
 weak understanding has, in numberless 
 instances, given to even uglyrnd deform- 
 ed women a conceit of themselves, which 
 is as pitiable as it is ridiculous; and we 
 See them daily exhibiting faces and per* 
 sons with the most entire persuasion of 
 their being attractive, which excite only 
 disgust and ill-natured animadversions. 
 No, no. Madam," continued I, " beauty 
 does not of necessity make a woman 
 a fool; a plain understanding and a very 
 little experience will teach her to appre* 
 ciate it justly ; but she will, and she 
 ought to bring it into that account of 
 gratitude she owes to her Maker ; for it 
 is a good gift, inasmuch as it renders

 The baronet had not apparently given

 sation, for though his eyes were fixed 
 on me, he seemed totally absorbed in his 
 own reflexions. ** You have not listen-

 those principles which alone can bestow

 esteem. But I am curious to know by

 advantage which it must be confesserV 
 â– with her face and at her age, one would 
 not have expected.'* â€” *' I will convince 
 you," replied I with gravity, '^ that if I 
 am not vain, it is because I am proud. I 
 was educated by a woman, who, to good 
 sense, joined every virtue that adorns 
 the female character. Her example, as 
 much as her precepts, contributed to 
 form me: and such washer influence, 
 that to resemble Mrs. Plardcastle was 
 the purpose of my life, even before I was 
 qualified to judge of her merit, or to 
 Hieasure the ascent I had to gain in my 
 approaches to her perfections. Mrs. 
 Hardcastle was a handsome woman ; but 
 she was neither vain nor affected. Yet 
 I will confess, I wished to be as hand- 
 some as Mrs. Hardcastle, who was indeed 
 a beautiful woman; fori particularly no- 
 ticed the consideration her elegant persoa 
 produced before strangers. But a lesson,

 called Mrs. Hardcastle, when our reading 
 was interrupted by the visit of a neigh-

 er had he received the frank and easy 
 welcome of Mrs. Hardcastle, than he 
 examined me ; and with the most elabo- 
 rate praise spoke of my improvement, 
 growth, and extraordinary beauty. Dur- 
 ing these commendations, which, al- 
 though they made me blush, did not 
 offend me, my maternal friend was good 
 humouredly caressing his dog, which was 
 a very ugly cur. "You have not lost your 
 enthusiasm for beauty I perceive," ob- 
 served she smiling. "But what is become 
 of your pretty Italian grey-hound } and 
 how happens it that her post is filled up 
 by this miserable looking animal?" *'I

 each more beautiful than Fidele. She 
 was not worth the keeping, except as a 
 plaything to my little nephew: but this 
 dog has qualities which are inestimable.'' 
 Mrs. liardcastle laughed, and turning 
 towards me said, with that sweetness 
 which so distinguished her, *'You see, my 
 dear girl, the xcorth of beauty when un- 
 friended by useful talents: remember 
 poor Fidele, and take heed to be some- 
 thing better than a play- thing for a school- 
 boy.'' I did not forget this lesson, and it 
 was the more useful to me, from finding, 
 in the gentleman's subsequent visits, that 
 whether it was a piece of old china, a 
 tulip, or a young lady's eyes or complec- 
 tion, he was equally hberal of his praise, 
 and employed much the same language. 
 I was therefore offended by his enco- 
 miums ; and I am become so proud and 
 fastidious on this point, that I always

 ** All this argues nothing against my 
 opinion,'* said the inflexible virgin. **With 
 your understanding, beauty may not be 
 a dangerous gift, but in ninety and nine 
 instances out of a hundred it is so, and 
 leads the possessor into danger." " So 
 you may say of health, of spirits, of in- 
 tellectual endowments, nay, even of life 
 itself," replied I ; "for each in its turn 
 is abused by the folly and passions of a 
 mind unchecked, and uncultivated. But 
 our neglect of a blessing does not lessen 
 the value of the gift; and for my part, 
 were I in your place, I would recommend

 contented with my face at present, but I 
 do not know what your comparison may

 be mended by cold cream or Spanish

 tion of my gaiety. *' Do with me what

 ^as so entirely engaged by Humphrey 
 Clinker as to forget his office alto- 
 get lier. Lady Maclairn soon after 
 found Mrs. Allen and myself busily 
 enraged in our work. She with alacrity 
 assisted us, and, with a look of sweet and 
 composed tranquillity directed to her 
 husband, she said, in a li'alf whisper, 
 " Are you aware, my dear Miss Cowley, 
 that I am incurring a debt which I can

 Are not these blessed indications of his

 in translating Lady Maclairn's language 
 or expression while she was thus speaking. 
 She loves her husband. Time, your grand 
 specific, will settle my opinions as they 
 relate to this lady ; in the meanwhile, I 
 cannot well account for her secret in 
 making me like and dislike her by turns. 
 Sometimes she appears the most artless 
 and ingenuous of her sex ; her conversa- 
 tion becomes animated, and her thoughts 
 flow with a frankness as unpremeditated 
 as your giddy Rachel's. The next hour 
 I see her, she is silent and ceremonious, 
 conceding to all that is done, trembling- 
 ly alive to all that is said. To-day she 
 oifended me at dinner. Miss Flint sharp-

 in the room before the last bell rang.

 so trifling ? I wish to see more of a de-

 ousness, " with what satisfaction do I 
 now devote my time to his ease and com-

 I have witnessed ! This morning he was

 my little journey, but conversed with 
 me on the subject of it with precision 
 and interest. In time his long habits of 
 seclusion and indolence will yield to the 
 natural energy of his character, and the 
 activity of his mind. I have cherished 
 this hope, Miss Cowley, from the hour I 
 was capable of reflecting on the nature 
 and operations of my fathers malady. I 
 never coitld believe he was what he was 
 called, nor that his case was incurable 
 lunacy. The event has justified my opi- 
 nion. After many years of suffering

 cal attacks, he was suddenly seized by a

 medicine, and repressed every hope; the 
 crisis was favourable. We were prepared 
 to expect not only extreme weakness in 
 his bodily powers, but also that debility 
 of mind wliich inseparably belongs to a 
 state of nearly renovated existence. He 
 remained for a time a mere infant ; but 
 we perceived that with his increasing 
 strength, his mind was clear from those 
 gloomy images which had so long ob- 
 scured it. He continued to gain strength ; 
 but unfortunately his memory, too faith- 
 ful for his advantage, represented the 
 scenes which had passed. He became 
 painfully susceptible to a sense of humi- 
 liation the most unfriendly to his perfect 
 recovery. No arguments could prevail 
 on him to appear, even before the ser^ 
 vants of the family, for a considerable 
 time, lest he should terrify them ; and 
 his persuasion was so strong that he 
 Avas disqualified to appear in society,

 that my dear mother ceased to importune 
 him on the subject. Unsupported, and 
 I may add, friendless as we are on the 
 side of connections, no efforts were made 
 to combat opinions which were more the 
 result of extreme delicacy and habitual 
 indulgence, than of a still disturbed 
 imagination. I was convinced that my 
 father wanted only a stimulus sufficient- 
 ly powerful to rouse his mind, and to 
 recover his native powers of acting. 
 About this time, we received Mr. Fla- 
 mall's letters, with his plan of your be- 
 coming an inmate at the hall. My 
 father was extremely averse to the pro- 
 posal. He affectingly drew a picture of 
 himself, and with tears appealed to 
 his wife to determine whether he was a 
 fit object for the observation of a girl 
 who had no acquaintance with misery, 
 and who would shun him as an object of 
 dread and disgust, or laugh at his eccen- 
 tricities. Miss Flint's wishes were an-

 cheerfuhiess ; '^ my husband wants to see 
 you, and to have your recommendation

 she, ** it was in my power, Miss Cowley,

 also to convince you of my own opinions,

 I can only deplore her aunt's harshness 
 of temper. I have neither the authority 
 nor the influence necessary to remedy 
 the evil. Lucretia must be left to the 
 bitter experience which will result from 
 her temper; and Miss Howard must be 
 satisfied with knowing, that she is not 
 the only one under this roof who suffers 
 from its caprices. I am this poor girFs

 it." The Baronet appeared, and I thought

 You say you do not yet know where to

 the gift of the renowned Puss and her 
 Boots, and take it into your head to step 
 from Heathcot to Tarefield. Conceiving 
 that, in the fancy of the moment, your 
 imagination had conquered the difficulty 
 of the staircases and thresholds, I will 
 in my turn, fancy you are now in my 
 domicile. My apartment forms the south 
 wing of this irregular building, in which 
 are two specious parlours, which command 
 the east and south, by wh;ch means I 
 have the avenue and the garden for my 
 solace. But on discovering that Lady 
 Maclairn had, from indulgence, a more 
 peculiar privilege in the appropriation of 
 these rooms to her own use, I have in- 
 sisted on their being regarded as hers;

 must look for your Rachel Cowley : but 
 you may, if it please you, imagine you 
 are still at home ; for all in this sanctum

 To gratify Sir Murdock, who by no

 cond floor for my domain, I have placed 
 my books and the piano- forte in one of the 
 parlours, which has wonderfully demesti- 
 cated us to that room. He is too well bred 
 to intrude on my private hours; but he often

 pleasure which belongs to sympathy; 
 and when I see the poor baronet's eyes 
 brighten at my approach, I feel the gaiety 
 which I often assume, settling into con- 
 tentment. Have I said enough to satisfy 
 your curiosity ? Will it not be my own

 will be all you wish me to be; but I

 indulgence ; and, to say the truth, I 
 would rather be the " Wet sea-boy" in

 night. Heaven will, in its mercy, receive 
 the petition I offer for all that is clear to 
 Rachel Cowley, for in that confidence do 
 I live. 
 
 P. S. Mrs. Allen bids me tell you that 
 she finds Tarcfield has a worse report 
 than it deserves. It is haunted only by 
 one unquiet spirit, and that may be said 
 of nine hundred and ninety-nine houses 
 out of a thousand. She has, by her usual 
 address, found the means of quieting this 
 nuisance as it approaches her; for Miss 
 Flint affects to have a great veneration 
 for Mrs. Allen's judgment, particularly in 
 physic, in which she is or seems to be an 
 adept. I heartily wish she may be con- 
 verted to Mrs. Allen's creed, of being 
 " good to all," it would do more for her 
 weak newes â€” could you but see this 
 woman! â€” than a [course of valerian and

 have already forgotten that I am a stran-

 mask gown and laced suit, and 1 saw her 
 this morning walking in the garden, in a 
 dishabille not far removed from dirty 
 negligence. By the way, the baronet 
 now exhibits a new wrapping gown with 
 Morocco slippers ; and as we walk be- 
 fore breakfast, he usually continues to 
 take that repast in the parlour with us. 
 This hour is gradually becoming useful to 
 him, and his wife also, for she appears to 
 enjoy it as much as he does. I am now 
 convinced that I have innocently occa- 
 sioned to Miss Hovv^ard the privation of 
 her morning exercise. I caught a glimpse 
 of her to-day m the garden, and instant-

 I was so angry with Lady Maclairn, that 
 I believe she perceived it; for nothing 
 escapes her observation. After dinner 
 we were by ourselves ; and, in the most 
 unqualified terms, I noticed Miss Flint's 
 want of humanity and good manners to

 daughter. ** I am astonished at your 
 forbearance," added I; "for these in-

 dread Miss Flint. She is too much un-

 when with her uncle, to perceive that 
 there is in Lucretia's temper a jealousy in 
 regard to the aifections of those about 
 her. With less timidity, and more ap- 
 parent contentment, she would remove 
 from her aunt's mind the suspicion which 
 interposes between her niece and every 
 act of kindness her natural generosity 
 would prompt. She believes Mary de- 
 tests her." â€”^' Good Heaven!" cried I,

 accuses her of deserving to be hated Iâ€” 
 But, you say, Mary has been tauglit to 
 dread this aunt. Are Miss Flint's tender

 girl trampled upon without pity, were I

 my tale to Mrs. Allen. â€” What a contrast ! 
 The glow of indignation, the look of 
 pity, with which she listened to my

 cold had kept her in her room at the 
 dining hour. 
 
 I had scarcely recovered my sangfroid 
 before Lady Maclairn, with a counte- 
 nance as placid and gentle as the pleased 
 infant's, entered to chat, and enquire 
 about the rebel tooth which had teazed 
 Mrs. Allen ; and, with a calm and easy 
 good humour, she asked my permission 
 for Sir Murdock's visit. " I am going," 
 added she, smiling, ^' to bring Miss

 Well, I will be good, and endeavour to

 What has given you the notion that I am 
 starved at Tarefield ? Please to under- 
 stand that Miss Fhnt prides herself on 
 the goodness and abundance of her table; 
 and although she has not yet acquired a 
 relish for a dinner of herbs seasoned by 
 love and peace, she has an excellent 
 appetite for the stalled ox. Consequently, 
 as the song says,

 Therefore be assured, that if to ^' pine

 had a scythe slung on his shoulder. He 
 joined us with a face glowing with health 
 and exercise; and with the utmost cheer- 
 fulness accosting us, he said he had been

 in the baronet's countenance, and I 
 thought the sahitation between the cap- 
 tain and him more ceremonies than cor- 
 dial. Sir Murdock, however, introduced 
 him to us ; and then, with a forced smile, 
 he asked him why he had so long desert- 
 ed the Hall. The captain said he was 
 sorry he had understood the family to 
 be too much engaged to admit intruders, 
 as it had prevented his visit of congratu- 
 lation on his return home ; and that he 
 had himself been on an excursion for 
 some time since that period. Sir Mur- 
 dock's brow cleared, he gave his hand, â€” 
 " You must be more neighbourly," said 
 he,*'andhelp us to reconcile the retirement 
 of this village to these ladies." He bowed, 
 and I began to talk of Miss Howard.

 complaint of her idleness, and begged he

 or a half-pay captain of marines, I shall 
 continue to inform you of the impression

 we parted that I ventured to tell him, 
 that the sight of a military beau was a

 gaiety and gallantry, that he accepted 
 ray terms, although the time had been, 
 when he" should have conditioned for 
 others ; but that I might depend on his 
 punctuality. 
 
 On our return home I mentioned this 
 arrangement to my companions. Sir Mur- 
 dock, deHghted with his morning walk, 
 said he would be of the evening party ; 
 but instantly recollecting the difficulty 
 of my engagement, he asked me, by 
 what stratagem I intended to free the 
 poor captive Mary from her cage. I 
 was not quite prepared with an answer to 
 this question; and could only reply^

 ingenuity for success. 
 
 The gaiety of the baronet amply in- 
 demnified Lady Maclairn for having 
 waited for her breakfast. Slie was treat-

 of the appointed rendezvous, and of my 
 plot to reach Captain Flint's heart by 
 means of his niece. Would you could 
 see Lady Maclairn in moments like these! 
 Why have I not Ithwriel's spear? For 
 nothing less potent can reach the genu- 
 ine features of this woman's mind ! This 
 morning, for example, she was ingenuous 
 and unconstrained, her sweet eyes con- 
 templating with delight the cheerfulness 
 of Sir Murdock, when in a moment I saw 
 her countenance change, and her eyes 
 cast downwards, from the effects of these

 words : *' My Harriot, you must be of

 tress. Sir Murdoch's gaiety sunk in an 
 instant; but I interposed my influence, 
 and witli assumed spirits said, I would 
 trust to no one for the deliverance of 
 Mary but myself; and that I had already 
 formed my plan of action. Do you not 
 think Lady Maclairn is some what obhged

 suspect she feels her obligations of this 
 sort sometimes too sensibly. 
 
 But to return from this digression. I 
 need not tell you that from the first hour 
 I entered â€¢into this house, I took care to 
 mark with a decided precision, my abso- 
 lute independence, in respect to Miss 
 Flint's v/ill and pleasure. In every com-

 But I found it was necessary either to 
 declare open war with Miss Lucretia on 
 the occasion before me, or to try her la- 
 dyship's mode of bending to the despot. 
 The lesson was a new one, and I felt an 
 inclination to make an attempt in the 
 art of flattery. So prepared, I met Miss 
 Lucretia at dinner: fortunately she was 
 in a pleasant humour; and giving a gulp 
 to my pride, I praised her skill in carving, 
 and told her the story of poor Mrs. Prim- 
 rose's white satin gown, and the unlucky 
 . goose-carver's disgrace, in the best man- 
 ner. I succeeded ; and my next ma- 
 noevre was to overlook the poor girl who 
 silently sat beside me, patiently expect- 
 ing to have her empty plate supplied. 
 My unusual politeness was not lost, for 
 I also talked of Jamaica. Upon this 
 ground, I presume, she called foi a glass 
 of rum and water, 'Mialf and half," and

 invited me and the circle to drink tea in 
 her apartment. Our cheerful accept- 
 ance of her invitation was followed by a 
 recollection of her dress, which was not 
 en Ttgle^ and she left us to prepare the 
 silver tea-board, and to make her toilet. 
 I was delighted to find Sir Muraock had 
 enjoyed this scene: he told his T/f-e I 
 was a plotter, and bade her beware of 
 my Circean-arts. She smiled, and said I 
 needed no auxiliaries, otherwise she would 
 readily join my standard, seeing it was 
 my design to lead tyranny captive. 
 
 On entering Miss Flint's drawing-

 up the lost time. The endless roll of 
 carpethig was now displayed. Miss 
 Cowley coidd not but praise the design; 
 and she heard that three years would 
 finish the furniture of the room in cross- 
 stitch, without one comment that could 
 offend. Can you wonder that Mary was

 ourselves, I begin to suspect that the art 
 of wheedling, is one of our natural pre- 
 rogatives. You cannot imagine with 
 what dexterity I employed my untried 
 weapons ! It was well they served me ; 
 for during the demurs and difficulties 
 Miss Flint opposed to my intreaties, I felt 
 my forbearance was like Acre's courage,

 ends, but with every breath I drew; and

 had she not consented when she did, I 
 should have lost my hard- earned laurels. 
 You will not, however, fail in congratula- 
 ting me on my triumph over myself. 
 But mark me, Lucy, I mean not to twist 
 and turn at the orders of that prudence 
 which is so often practised for wisdom. 
 It is necessary for my purpose that Miss 
 Howard's friends should know more of 
 me before I can effectually oppose Miss 
 Flint's will; but when they do understand 
 that Rachel Cowley can no more live 
 under the same roof with an oppressed 
 orphan, than Miss Lucretia shelter one, 
 without feeding her spleen, and qualifying 
 her malice for the bread she bestows, 
 farev/ell wheedling and coaxing ! My 
 road will be plain, and if perchance I 
 encounter any of Miss Lucretia's 
 frowns in my way, I shall laugh at 
 them.

 Miss Cowley to Miss Ilardcastk. 
 
 We found the party in the hay-field 
 augmented by all farmer Wilson's family, 
 namely, his wife, with a Mrs. and Miss 
 Heartley, their boarders and lodgers, to 
 whom Malcolm introduced us with an 
 eagerness of good- will and pleasure which 
 was flattering to me. The tender greet- 
 ings between those ladies and Mary, evi- 
 dently proved that I had communicated 
 more of joy and gladness than I had 
 foreseen, by my interference; and as this 
 was the case, I took my share of the 
 general satisfaction, which appeared like 
 the sky, cloudless. Mrs. Wlisou soou re-

 said, " And what excuse will you make

 you have monopolized a heart which he

 only answer to this question, which 
 awakened my curiosity. I was however 
 called from further observation by being 
 asked for a song ; but wiUing to make 
 the conversation more general, I allcdged 
 that I was too angry to sing ; and, with 
 assumed resentment, I reproached the 
 captain's want of discretion as well as 
 courage in bringing into the field so 
 many witnesses of my weakness, and so 
 many guards against his own. " You 
 wrong your gallant, by your suspicious, 
 Miss Cowley," answered Mrs. Heartley, 
 with ease and spirit. But what will he

 our walk home she apparently slackened 
 her pace, the more unnoticedly to con-

 ing,'' said she, when entering the road 
 to the hall, ^* on finding that I neglect 
 to pay you my respects at Sir Mur- 
 dock's house ; but I do not visit the

 intimacy with Mrs. Howard, and my

 Flint, have laid me under indelible dis- 
 grace with Miss Flint. Lady Maclairn's

 my children has also its share in keeping 
 alive Miss Flint's animosity. From a 
 child this young man has been regarded, 
 by myself and tlie family at large with 
 whom Lreside, as a cherished and favour- 
 ed guest. This circumstance has, I much 
 fear, been unfavourable to Miss Howard ; 
 it has certainly abridged her in her free- 
 dom. She is not permitted to visit her 
 uncle, because he lives under the same 
 roof with me; and she dares not speak 
 to either Alice or myself, when accident 
 throws her in our path, if she has a ser- 
 vant wnth her. My poor girl murmurs 
 at this refinement in cruelty, and strenu- 
 ously ])leads that I ought to inform 
 Captain Flint of this harsh prohibition;

 Alalcolm is not so reserved with us, and 
 yve are miserable on her account. The 
 captain hopes to soften his sister's heart 
 to a sense of justice at least, and has 
 given up the comfort and prop of his 
 life to the fallacious expectation that 
 Miss Flint will love and provide for the 
 future support of this poor orphan. I 
 did not in the first instance oppose his 
 plan of conciliation. His sister offered to 
 take her; and he yielded her up to her 
 promises of being her friend and pro- 
 tector; but if he knew Miss Howard'a 
 situation she would not remain a hour at 
 Tarefield-hall. Poor Mary understands 
 this perfectly ; and with an heroism which 
 does her credit, suffers without com- 
 plaint, rather than return to be a burden 
 on her uncle. I need not recommend to 
 your favour," continued she, ** this in- 
 nocent and helpless girl. We are told

 Whether it was owing to my dose of 
 flattery, or to the rum bottle, I will not 
 decide; but certain it is, that Miss Lu- 
 cretia received us with good-humour. 
 She was more than commonly loqua- 
 cious; and I, with the patience of a Lady 
 Maclairn, listened to the history of her 
 sprained knee, which had spoiled her for 
 a walker. This disastrous subject gave 
 place to her inviting me to take an airing 
 with her the following morning, when 
 she engaged to shew me a very " pretty 
 country." But this was nothing, fori was 
 even proof against a long story in which 
 her dear brother Philip was the hero, and 
 I was led to approve of his conduct by a 
 direct interrogation. " Was not his be- 
 haviour noble ?"â€” I forgot the tale, but 
 I recollect he saved a young woman's 
 being thrown from her horse. I had, 
 however, my measures to keep, and we

 woman by my address! She would fetch 
 and carry like a spaniel weres^he but ilat- 
 tered. But more of this hereafter. You 
 must know more of Mrs. Hcartley and 
 her fair daughter Alice. Mrs. Heartley 
 is more indebted to an air of fashion 
 and dignity, for the attractions of her 
 person, than either to her features or 
 shape. Her face would be called homely 
 were it not lighted up by her dark and 
 expressive eyes; and although I believe 
 she is defective in her shape, she moves 
 with grace, and is what you would dis- 
 tinguish by the title of an '^ elegant 
 woman." Her daughter would at once 
 be thought by the admirers of half- 
 starved, pale-faced beauties, as too nearly 
 approaching to the dairy maid ; for con- 
 tentment and health have given Ahce an 
 ernhon point beyond the prescribed rules 
 of fashion. She is a clear brunette, and

 pair of large hazel eyes give life and spirit 
 to her round and dimpled face, and wheii 
 she smiles (and Alice has yet to learn 
 that smiles and laughter are vulgar) she 
 is a perfect llehe ; and Mrs. Allen wished 
 Bun bury had seen her, as he would not 
 have omitted to give this laughter-loving 
 nymph in his charming group of rural 
 beauties. She tells me that I have not 
 been just to Alice: perhaps I have not; 
 and that I should have been more lavish 
 of my praise of this handsome girl, had 
 she not been by the side of Miss How* 
 ard. But again I pronounce this young 
 creature to be nature's master-piece! I 
 had not before seen her animated by* 
 pleasure or exercise, nor could I have .

 expressing the vivacity she discovered^ 
 She seemed to tread in air, and, whilst

 young bride ; but I could not desert my 
 post even then with satisfaction to myself. 
 The mother-in-law was a mere child in 
 tlie knowledge proper for the mistress of 
 a family ; and I soon discovered, that my 
 father had only added to my cares by 
 placing at his table an indolent woman, 
 who only married him in order to live 
 at her ease. However, I will be just to 
 Lady Maclairn; as my father's wife, she 
 conducted herself with discretion and 
 modesty, and I have in return been her 
 constant friend. 
 
 Her marriage with Sir Murdock was a 
 foolish business ! Mr. Flamall strongly 
 opposed it; but Hr riot was always ro- 
 mantic ! He predicted thtn, that the 
 baronet would be crazy j and Avell he

 which no one could overlook. But a 
 title, though without a groat, flattered 
 Mrs. Flint's vanity, and I had only to 
 reconcile matters, and to think of pre- 
 venting the evils of this connection as it 
 related to my dear Philip's security. You 
 may judge, Miss Cowley," continued 
 she with augmenting seriousness,'' of my 
 affection for a brother, whom, from the 
 hour of his birth, I considered as con- 
 signed in a peculiar manner to my guar* 
 dianship and care. His mother's second 
 marriage enforced these duties on my 
 heart ; to shelter him, I was determined 
 to offer my house to Lady Maclairn as 
 a residence at once honourable and pru- 
 dent for her. Thus has it happened, that 
 I have had for years a hmatic under my 
 roof. Besides this, I boarded the whole 
 family at so moderate a sum, that with a 
 better regulated economy, Lady Mac- 
 lairn might have saved something for

 Malcolm^s exigencies, for Philip was 
 entirely my charge ; but I cannot ima- 
 gine how she manages her purse, it is 
 never beforehand, and I doubt, IVIalcolm 
 will take care to prevent all accumula- 
 tions. Idleness at his age is a melancho- 
 ly prospect ! I wish Harriot may not 
 live to repent of her confidence in this 
 young man. But now I am on the sub- 
 ject of my family, I will add a few words 
 in explanation of my conduct, as it re- 
 lates to another object of my care. Were 
 you, Miss Cowley, acquainted with all 
 the insults and injuries I have sustained 
 from Mary Howard's parents, you would 
 only wonder to find her under my roof. 
 But when I received her, to relieve my 
 brother Percival from a burden he could 
 ill sustain, I meant not to train her up 
 to any expectations but such as resulted 
 from her mother's imprudence. She it 
 was who entailed poverty on her child ; 
 and I shall fulfil my duty, in teaching

 I musthowev'cr observe that your worthy 
 father, not only evinced his aflection 
 for you in his choice of Philip, but the 
 prudence of a man solicitous for the 
 prosperity of a rising family. On the 
 score of merit and conduct, Philip needs 
 not fear any competitor for your favour. 
 His fortune will be ample and solid, for 
 I consider myself as only his steward. 
 Mr. Flamall's proposal of your residing 
 at the hall, was a matter I heartily con- 
 curred in ; and in order to give Lady 
 Maclairn more consequence in a family 
 you have honoured by your presence, and 
 to which you will belong, I resigned 
 my authority in it, and became, like

 gracious smile. " This is his picture

 She presented me a miniature of the 
 young man, which to say the truth was 
 strikingly handsome. '' Nature has been 
 liberal to your favourite," observed I, ex- 
 amining the portrait. ** He is much im- 
 proved in his person," said she with 
 eagerness, ** since that age. There is 
 not in England a finer made man !

 ridiculous for a serious examination; and

 The evening was too inviting not to 
 tempt us out. Not a breeze ruffled its 
 serenity ; the moon shed her silver radi- 
 ance () er the tranquil scene. Mary, light

 Sir Murdock spouted Ossian with enthu- 
 siastic delight. Your Rachel's spirits

 the question, " Is then Mr. Maclairn a

 one of the most amiable girls in the 
 world, as well as the most virtuous and

 you see, Lucy, these freaks of fancy hap-

 think in another century parents niay 
 discover the force of sympathy, and will 
 think of some remedy for the mischief 
 it may do whilst their children are in the 
 cradle. It is a wretched business, when 
 poor unfortunate beings, whose wealth is 
 unequal, take it into their heads to yield 
 to the attraction of sympathy. It is still 
 worse, when the scale of fortune is empty 
 on both sides. Might not the now use- 
 less sash worn by children round their 
 waists, be usefully worn over their eyes 
 till they are properly mm^ried? I speak

 mortal." His features are still small and 
 regular, and his complexion, naturally 
 fair, is thought less delicate than in the 
 days of his youth, still good; his teeth are 
 white and even, and have suffered nothing

 whenever I see it with a cheerful coun-

 even the mortified Pascal "svould have 
 shrunk; for I think it may be presumed, 
 that by not eating liis soup Pascal's pe- 
 netenlial girdle was bearable; but poor Mr. 
 Snughead cannot be at his ease either full 
 or fasting. He imitates in barbarity the 
 fell Procrastes, for his cloaths arc made 
 by a measure that has never been enlarged 
 since the day of his gentility, and hia 
 unfortunate person, like the victim to tlie 
 iron couch, is doomed to suffer under 
 ligatures as painful as the rack. He 
 seems momentarily in danger of suffo* 
 cation, and I could not, without pity, hear 
 him so often complain of the " melting 
 weather," nor view unmoved his hand in- 
 stinctively raised to his cravat in order to 
 relieve his respiration. But Mr. Snug- 
 head's stoical firmness consoled me, and I 
 next examined his dress. But what pen, 
 my Lucy, can do justice to the elaborate 
 neatness of this canonical beau! Who 
 can describe the glossy black robes, the

 texture of his linen! In what lanouacrp 
 shall I convey to your imagination the 
 honours of his head, his tight, perfumed, 
 well-powdered curls ! I despair, you must 
 even tancy perfection. The frequent ap- 
 plication of a well-scented, delicate cam- 
 bric handkerchief to his face, gave me 
 an opportunity of discovering that it was 
 not his tight lacing which had impelled 
 his hand to his throat, but the desire of 
 exhibiting this precious relic of former 
 beauty; for although somewhat in shape 
 dropsical, it yet retains its Mdiitencss, and 
 is properly distinguished by a sumptuous 
 amethyst ring encircled with brilliaQts. 
 I was diverted from further observation, 
 by his abruptly addressing me with, 
 " Well, my pretty young lady, what say 
 you to our north roads? Is not this a v'ery 
 pleasant one? What do you tliink of that

 I am rather disposed to think that

 of course had the advantage of me, for 
 with much officiousness he endeavoured 
 to be agreeable, I was the 7'ebel Rachel 
 Cowley, â€” I could not help it, Lucy. On 
 reaching the hall, I followed Mr. Snug- 
 head's steps, on whose arm Miss Flint 
 leaned ; and I overheard the puppy say, 
 *' Proud enough in conscience!" *' Incon- 
 ceivably so,'' was the reply. Yes, Lucy, I 
 am proud, I disdain the civility that can 
 simper at the conceits of a Mr. Snughead, 
 and despise the impudence of any clerical 
 man, who forgetting himself, and the re- 
 spect that is due to his profession, fancies 
 his dress is to enforce respect from others. 
 What right has a reptile of this class to 
 the tribute which all pay to a Sedley?

 No, no ! I am too provident " to cast 
 pearls before swine." You know my in- 
 infirmity, Lucy; I have novv^ taken a rooted 
 antipathy to this Mr. Snughead, not only 
 as he is a contemptible creature, but 
 because he irritated me to anger. I wa$ 
 vexed and out of humour with myself. 
 The kindly greetings of the collected 
 family were lost upon me, and I was on 
 the point of quitting the room, when 
 luckily, I observed Sir Murdpck's cold 
 and ceremonious bow to the intruder. 
 A placid and contracted air yielded to a 
 suffusion of his Scotch '* blude/'i^ which 
 for a moment mantled in his cheek : this 
 moment was of use to me, I recollected 
 myself. My gaiety succeeded to this 
 little triumph, and even Mr. Snughead 
 was treated with civility. An excellent 
 dinner was a temptation I should have 
 supposed this gentleman had been proof 
 against ; I will not say that he eat like an 
 epicure, but most assuredly he eat more

 than his waistcoat allowed, far he suddenly 
 complained of a most violent pain in his 
 stomach, and Miss Flint prescribed a glass 
 of rum. My tender heart melted, and 1 
 was just going to recommend slackening 
 his waistcoat, when I saw him have re- 
 course to the remedy. He breathed more 
 freely, and attributing his indisposition 
 to the extreme heat of the day, perfected 
 the cure by untying his cravat. But I 
 am doomed to be incorrigible on certain 
 points ! I have not been able to get rid of 
 my antipathy for this animal. Now attend 
 to the conversation. -^ I hope you found 
 Mrs. Snughead's health improved on 
 yonr return home." This was a question 
 from the lady of the mansion, who, till the 
 cloth was removed, had not found time 
 to talk. ** I cannot flatter myself! She is, 
 my lady, still very ill, very ill indeed : I 
 am in constant anxiety, and have too 
 much reason to fear that she will shorten 
 her days by yielding to her complaint,

 which is merely nervous. She is never out 
 of the apothecary's hands, and it is my 
 opinion, medicine does her more harm 
 than good." The unfeigned sorrow with 
 which Mr. Snughead delivered this opi- 
 nion, induced Miss Flint to take the part 
 of the comforter. " She will soon be 
 better," observed she, " I have no doubt 
 of it, now she is rid of her constant 
 plague. You will see her spirits will mend 
 in a sort time. But what have you done 
 with young graceless?" ** I saw him 
 embarked for the West Indies," replied 
 Mr, Snughead; "he was highly delighted 
 with his uniform, and having gained his 
 point, nothing would do but the army 
 for Banks, and that predilection was, I 
 fear, strengthened by his mother's op- 
 position to it." â€” ** He has .been unfor- 
 tunate in his destination," observed the 
 captain, ^* and will have a bad climate to 
 encounter; it has of late been fatal to 
 thousands." â€” '* He must take his chance

 and trust to Providence," replied Mr. 
 Snughead, with great gravity ; ** pru- 
 dence and sobriety at his age, may 
 preserve him, and I hope he will consi- 
 der this, and be wise.'' â€” '* Wise !" echoed 
 Miss Lucretia, '' he must act otherwise, in 
 that case, than he has hitherto done, and 
 associate with those wiser than himself. 
 However, I commend him for his spirit; 
 for nothing is so ridiculous as to see a 
 young man tied to his mother's apron- 
 string 1 And after all," continued the 
 tender-hearted spinster, *' none of us can 
 die more than once; therefore it is a folly to 
 think of what may happen or not happen 
 to Mr. Banks." â€” Malcolm, who had dur- 
 ing this conversation been biting a cork, 
 with eyes flashing resentment, now burst 
 into a sarcastic laugh. Lady Maciairn 
 instantly rose, and observed, that the 
 heat of the room incommoded her. A,, 
 look of supplication directed to h^r son 
 did not escape me. Every one agreed

 that the garden was preferable, and we 
 left the table. I retired to my room. 
 From the window I soon after saw the 
 party sauntering in the avenue, but as 
 Miss Flint was not with them, I sup- 
 posed she had also chosen her apartment 
 for a tite-d'tcte with Mr. Snughead. I 
 therefore hastened down stairs to join my 
 friends, when to my surprise and vexa- 
 tion, I found the tite-d-iite party quietly 
 enjoying themselves on the garden-seat 
 dose to the door I had to pass. I could 
 not escape them without rudeness. "You 
 have done wisely," observed I languidly, 
 " in being stationary." â€” " I think we 
 have," answered Miss Flint, inviting me 
 to occupy the vacant place by her side, 
 ** and I advise you to follow our ex- 
 ample." â€” I urged that I was going to the 
 avenue. â€” " You look fatigued," observed 
 she witli kindness, still pressing me to 
 sit down, ** and your friends will return

 tions, I took the seat, and with truth ac- 
 knowledged that I liad the head-ach. 
 My silence, or stupidity, if it must be 
 so, probably led J\Iiss Flint to pursue 
 the thread of the conversation which I 
 had interrupted; for, turning to Mr. 
 Snughead, she said â€” " But, as I was" 
 saying, Mr. Snughead, is it not your duty 
 to prevent Wilson and his people from 
 instantly occupying the only pew in the 
 church open to strangers ? It is really 
 ridiculous to see such people so mis- 
 placed I'' â€” *^ I have no authority to pre-

 have purchased it of your father ; and

 Bot ^peak to your brother the captain ? 
 He certainly ought to sit with you on 
 every account. He should not brave 
 public opinion at church. It is, to say 
 no more, indecorous to see him pass you 
 with those ladies^ and make the whole 
 congregation stare, as they do, at his 
 gallantry."â€”" He would be disappointed 
 of his aim if they did not," answered 
 Miss Flint, with anger ; " it is to brave 
 
 me, that he so far forgets decency ." 
 
 " You judge too severely of your bro- 
 ther," observed the rector, in an assum- 
 ed conciliatory tone; " it may be, and 
 probably is, that the lady exacts this 
 homage to her power. The poor captain is 
 not the only one of his class who finds 
 passive obedience and non-resistance an 
 important duty, without the pale of the 
 church as well as within \V â€” ** Who is

 mortals !" cried the exulting Miss Flint, 
 *' but a truce with your wit. You well 
 know my motives for removing Mary 
 from Wilson's. I had solid reasons for 
 thinking the society she had in that house 
 improper for her. I wish to caution 
 Miss Cowley, without offending her. 
 Are you not convinced that, if Sir Mur- 
 dock had been a rational man, he would 
 have judged, as Lady Maclairn and 
 myself have done, that Mrs. Heartley 
 and her daughter had no claims to Miss 
 Cowley's notice ?" 
 
 " Upon my word you perplex me," re- 
 plied the sapient divine, passing his clay-r 
 coloured hand over his violet face, " I 
 know so little of these ladies ! nothing 
 indeed, but from report. My wife from

 and no one can dispute the charms of 
 Miss Alice ! Our young man, Banks, was 
 one of her admirerers ; but his mother did 
 not approve of the intimacy between him 
 and Harry Heartley. This gave offence, 
 and the ladies overlook their pastor. I 
 should imagine Miss Cowley would act 
 with prudence, to be on the reserve with 
 ladies who do not] visit at the hall." â€” 
 The straggling party approached us, and 
 our conversation finished. â€” To my great 
 relief, I found that Miss FHnt only waited 
 their return, to bid adieu to the captain ; 
 pleading her engagenient, and the moon, 
 for passing the evening with ** poor Mrs.

 much formality, the Reverend Mr, Snug-

 freely as well as myself, after Mr. Snug-

 which so often embellished those at

 the avenue, and every one was freed from 
 constraint, and disposed for enjoyment. 
 No, your poor Rachel was not in har-

 I sauntered from the circle. I could not

 I raised my tearful eyes ; the very image 
 of pity binding up the wounded foot of 
 the pilgrim, met them. I recollected 
 myself I remembered it was Mary's 
 holiday ; and that my dejection clouded 
 her hour of satisfaction. I pressed her 
 hand, and joined my friends with assumed 
 alacrity. She understood me, and I was 
 recompensed for my exertions. Gaiety 
 gave place to a rational conversation. 
 Captain Flint talked of America, and my 
 spirits settled into composure; but I have 
 been too busy to-day for sleep, and you

 Note to the Readeu. 
 
 Finding nothing important to my 
 history during the course of several 
 weeks' correspondence, so punctually 
 maintained by Miss Cowley, I have sup- 
 pressed a few letters, to avoid the censure 
 of prolixity. 
 
 Amongst the causes assigned in her 
 letters at this time for her dejection of 
 mind, she mentions the absence of her" 
 friends from the Abbey, who, it appears, 
 were on an excursion to Hartley- Pool, 
 a bathing-place not very remote from 
 them. She dwells, however, with much 
 more inquietude on the condition of Miss 
 Howard. She observes, that her uncle's 
 absence has still more lessened these 
 observances of civility which Miss Flint 
 had practised. Her indignation daily 
 augments, by perceiving Lady Maclairn's 
 increasing reserve on the subject of Miss

 Howard's unworthy treatment. â€” '^ To 
 what purpose ser\e her dov/ncast eyes 
 and varying colour," writes Miss Cowley, 
 '^ when at tahle she hears Miss Flint tell 
 the servant, that Marys plate needs no 
 change? Tlie very ibotman blushes. 
 Why does she not insist on every one's 
 equality at her table? Surely, Luc}^ the 
 Gospel does not recommend with the 
 spirit of peace, an insensibihty to op- 
 pression ! It is, however, too much for 
 me to witness; and I am determined to 
 have some conversation with Captain â€¢ 
 Flint when he returns. Something shall 
 be done to mitigate this poor girl's suf- 
 ferings. I suspect she dares not com- 
 plain to her uncle. I will do it for her, 
 and trust to the event. I disdain that 
 humanity which shrinks from active ser- 
 vice, and can quiet its feelings by exhalt- 
 ing its sighs in useless pity and fretful 
 censures.'' â€” *' But," adds she, renewing 
 her wonted spirit, " I am called to or-

 hearted gentleman, not having yet smooth-

 assure you, that my late indisposition 
 has disappeared. Your accounts from 
 Italy were the specifics for the worst 
 part of it ; and without detracting from 
 the good effects of the new curricle, I 
 must attrihute my cure to your prescrip-

 been less than yours, my dear Lucy, on 
 the subject of medical advice; but I 
 knew the medicine I wantedâ€” it was not 
 in the apothecary's shop. The curricle 
 is, however, still in favour, for it amuses 
 Sir Murdock, and he is proud of being 
 charioteer. You cannot imagine with 
 what tenderness and attention I am treat-

 Joving her; but I wish also to reverence 
 her. It hurts me to see her sink herself 
 and her talents, in order to sooth and 
 keep quiet a Avoman who might be

 of a mere cringing dependent. I find 
 she has by dint of coaxing and tears, 
 obtained permission for Mary to go with 
 us to the Abbey to-morrow, in order to 
 see her uncle. Mrs. Warner, Miss Fhnfs 
 favourite servant, communicated these 
 glad tidings to Mrs. Allen, and conclud- 
 ed by saying, '*Aye, they will never 
 understand my lady's temper. Miss 
 Howard should have gone without asking 
 leave, and Lady Maclairn should have 
 commended her for taking it for granted 
 she had a right to go to see the captain. 
 Miss Flint is not the better for being 
 indulged in her temper. I do my duty ; 
 she knows I am faithful, but she knows 
 also that I w ill not be her slave. It often 
 vexes me to see Miss Howard so much 
 afraid of her ! Why not say from the

 is something to say. The gf^lden-calf

 is well-intentioned to Miss Howard, and, 
 I believe, contributes to her comforts;

 lina to read to Mary whilst she worked.

 left my friends in the parlour in order to 
 finish the day happily with you. Per- 
 haps there was also a little discretion at 
 the bottom of this intention when first 
 suggested. I wished to avoid Mary's 
 first greeting from her aunt, whose or- 
 ders she had disobeyed ; but on inquiry, 
 the lady had retired for the night before 
 cwe reached the hall. Miss Flint's sleep-

 pect ; and Mrs. Patty, our maid, never 
 fails to say on these sudden drowsy fits, 
 *^ Ah, poor lady, she is much to be piti* 
 ed ! for there is nothing like the sleep

 Lucretia to enjoy any repose she can 
 purchase, I will prepare for mine by ah

 sallied forth this mornins: for our visit to

 but she was not in spirits. Jonathan, 
 I\liss Flint's footman, followed our steps. 
 I had my project in my head ; for I had 
 determined that this exertion of Miss 
 Flint's power should not pass unnoticed. 
 We had not proceeded more than half 
 our road to the Abbey, before we were 
 met by the captain and the Heartleys. 
 Mary's philosophy forsook her on per- 
 ceiving them. '* How unpardonable I 
 am," said she, ** now I have no pretence 
 for going farther v/ith you ! I must return 
 with the servant.** You may conclude 
 that this observation was conveyed to 
 the captain's ear. He coloured, and with 
 some quickness in his manner turned to 
 the servant, saying, /'You need go no 
 fartlier. I shall take care of Miss How- 
 ard." The man bovred, and retreating, 
 seemed yet to hesitate. *' Inform your 
 lady, Sir, "added the captain with digni- 
 ty, *' that my niece passes the day with 
 me and her friends, and that I shall call

 on her soon." Jonathan, with a lower 
 bow, quickened his pace. 
 
 "Indeed! indeed!" cried Mary, ^' I 
 must not disobey orders, my aunt will 
 be disobhged !" â€” " I will be answerable 
 for that," replied the captain with gra- 
 vity; ** but in your attention to your 
 aunty Mary, do not forget your uncle, 
 nor what is due to yourself." It was 
 some time before this httle cloud passed ; 
 but it was dissipated by the time M^e 
 reached the farm, and Mary's welcome 
 from Mrs. Wilson apparently banished 
 Miss Flint and her orders from her 
 thoughts. 
 
 I do not remember mentioning to you 
 the noble apartments which Mrs. Heart- 
 ley occupies in the Abbey. But her taste 
 has given to them an appearance of com- 
 fort, light, and cheerfulness, which in 
 my opinion more than supplies the ab- 
 sence of the magnificence, which gave 
 the finish to dark and richly carved wain-

 co}>o*enial with the love of neatness and 
 order of the present inmates of the house. 
 But should it happen that any of the 
 departed spirits of the " Ingram" race 
 still hover near the spot of their glory, 
 they must, if they be placable, acknow- 
 ledge, that although cumbrous greatness 
 is fallen, hospitality still retains her em- 
 pire in the house ; and that those vices 
 which ruined themselves and half the 
 county, are buried in the fallen fabric of 
 Gothic ignorance and superstition. After 
 dinner we had music, which at least vied 
 with the lute and virginal of former 
 times. The Heartleys, I find, are all 
 gifted with a taste for harmony. The

 forgotten all I know for want of prac- 
 tice," said she with a suppressed sigh. 
 ** I will sing with you, my love," replied 
 Mrs. Heartley, " and we shall manage

 timidly sung the little ballad of Prior's,

 with taste and expression. *^ Bravo, my

 with a smile, " you have not forgotten 
 that song at least. You would recover 
 in a month all you have lost." Elated 
 by this commendation, she turned to- 
 wards me, and with eagerness observed, 
 â€¢that Henry Heartley had taught her not 
 only to sing that song, but to admire the 
 poetry and composition; " for," added 
 she, " Henry was an Orpheus, even in 
 his cradle ! I have heard Mrs. Heartley

 prevented jMary from proceeding on a 
 subject which seemed to have placed her

 I forgot not to deliver the counsellor s 
 letter to his old favourite; Mrs. Heartley 
 ran it over with apparent satisfaction, 
 and give it me to peruse. " I will 
 thank him myself," said she, '' for this 
 proof of his remembrance ; I needed 
 none of his candour and justice. He 
 knew me before I was a wife, he knew 
 me as one, and he knows that Heartley *s 
 widow lives to honour his memory, and 
 to perpetuate his virtues in his children." 
 She pressed my hand with emotion, and 
 smiling through the tears which escaped 
 her, observed that she >vas yet selfish and 
 weak.

 Wilson, followed by the young people, 
 made the circuit of her domains. The dai- 
 ry, the cheese-chamber, the poultry-yard 
 were explored, and poor Malcohn \vas

 for his daring crime of attempting to 
 give Alice a green gown. By means of 
 that secret intelligence at which you so 
 wickedly laugh, Mrs. Wilson and myself 
 were old friends in half an hour. She 
 found out that Miss Cowley was not a 
 iine lady ; and Miss Cowley discovered 
 that the farmer's wife was worth all the 
 fine ladies that have ever swarmed as but- 
 terflies of the hour. She brought to my 
 mind the very image of the good woman 
 before Rhadamanthus, and I doubt not 
 but she could as satisfactorily demand 
 his passport ; for though she has not a

 She seconded my motion for the fami-

 around us. We sauntered,, rather than 
 walked, and insensibly the party sepa- 
 rated, and our chat was broken into se- 
 veral divisions. Mrs. Heartley and my- 
 self, with the captain, had even lost sight 
 of our company, which had advanced 
 before us. Mr. Flint with enthusiasm 
 supported the opinion of a plurality of 
 worlds; and I sung a verse of Addison's 
 sublime hymn. â€” " The spacious firma- 
 ment on high." My companions partook 
 with me in the pious fervour of the poet; 
 and we moved so slowly, that had not 
 the sound of an horse's feet accelerated 
 our steps, the traveller might have 
 thought us statues, or ghosts. An an- 
 gle in the road was in our path, and on 
 turning it, Mr. Snughead appeared. He 
 paid his compliments tome with a fami- 
 liarity which even startled me. ^' This 
 is fortunate !" cried he, stopping his horse 
 and endeavouring to dismount, " now 
 my incredulity is corrected ! for will you

 tening to the seraphic strains you sung, 
 I said, 
 
 ** Can any mortal mixture of earth's mould 
 Breathe such divine inchanting ravishment?" 
 
 But I am convinced, and you must sing 
 again." I instantly concluded that Mr. 
 Snughead had not dined e?2 famille: re- 
 treating therefore from his impatient 
 horse, I observed with good humour, 
 that it did not appear that his horse had 
 heard of the convention â€” *' no sons:, 
 no supper,*' and was not disposed to 
 loiter on his road. " I am already too 
 late," added I, '^ but at your next visit 
 at the hall, I will sing." This prudence 
 on my part was rewarded; he recollected 
 himself, bowed to the captain, and 
 wishing me good night, spurred his 
 horse.

 altliough tlie curricle has not been over- 
 set, nor have I had a cold and sore throat 
 in consequence of my night walk. 
 
 In my last I mentioned that poor Mary 
 had suffered from being out so late; but 
 that her aunt wisely recollecting that 
 Sunday was the captain's visiting day, 
 graciously admitted Mrs. Allen's evi- 
 dence in favour of the poor culprit; and 
 that our Sabbath was a day of peace as. 
 well as rest. I heard nothing of colds 
 or rheums that day. â€” On Monday, Mary 
 was kept hard at work upon the odious 
 carpet. I p<^de out with Sir Murdock 
 in the morning of the following day, and 
 on our return found your dear letter. 
 All was peace, in consequence, in your 
 Rachel's bosom. But at dinner no 
 counterfeiting could conceal from me

 such pains to hide. It is incredible to 
 conceive, what a command of features.

 this woman has acquired! But I detest her 
 when she dares not speak with frankness. 
 There is a tremulous play of the muscles 
 round her mouth, and a slowness in her 
 utterance that mark the struggle within. 
 On enquiring for Miss Flint and Mary, 
 who did not appear, we were told that 
 Miss Fhnt had a most oppressive ner- 
 vous head-ach, and that Miss Howard 
 had gotten a sore throat. â€” On Wednes- 
 day, hoth the invalids were worse ;. for the 
 aunt was uneasy on Mary's account who 
 was feverish. ^^SirMurdockwas, however, 
 to be amused." He might fancy it would 
 turn to a putrid sore throat and be alarm- 
 ed. It is a pity, thought I, whilst 
 Lady Maclairn made all these excuses 
 for imposition, that nature had not given 
 you a different complexion ! I was cer- 
 tain, Lucy, that there was some mystery 
 in this business. Warner kept close, and

 sudden change in the weather, and his 
 lady's frequent desertion of him in order 
 to attend the sick, I engaged him to 
 settle us in our winter quarters, and to 
 make shelves for the books lately sent 
 me from town. Two days incessant rain 
 were thus passed; and we learned tliat 
 the valetudinarians were recovcrino*. â€” On 
 Sunday, Mrs. Allen and myself went to 
 church in the morning ; and I was re-

 Alary had been indisposed with a colcL'

 much distressed on her account. They 
 mean to dine below to-day, lest the cap- 
 tain should be uneasy,"

 I delivered my commission with the 
 same precaution it was given me, and 
 whilst I was satisfying Mary's friends on 
 the subject, Mr. Snughead passed 'me 
 with a supercilious bow, without taking 
 off his hat. On entering the parlour we 
 found it heated by a large fire ; it was 
 really suffocating. Miss Fhnt, huddled 
 up in wrappers, had taken possession of 
 the great chair on one side of it. Mary, 
 with a face as pale as death, in a close 
 morning cap, a muslin cravat, and a 
 shawl closely pinned up, had her ap- 
 pointed station on the other side. Her ^ 
 cheek glowed however on seeing us ; 
 but she appeared fluttered and weak. 
 Our congratulations followed, Avhilst the 
 captain looking with much seriousness at 
 her, said, '* My dear child, why was I not 
 informed of your being ill.^ â€” ** It was 
 only a cold. Sir," answered Mary with a 
 faint blush. **And a cold she has to 
 thank you for," said the sister. ** Night

 walks in October do not suit Mary. It 
 is well it was no worse, I expected only 
 a putrid fever." The servants, for we 
 are old fashioned people on a Sunday, 
 had by this time covered the table ; and 
 a smoaking sirloin graced the bottom of 
 it. Mary rose from her seat in visible 
 disorder, oppressed, as I thought, by the 
 heat of the room, and the savoury steams 
 of the dinner ; but as she tottered to the 
 door, she burst into hysterical sobbings, 
 and Malcolm and myself prevented her 
 falling, for she fainted in our arms. 
 Malcolm placed her in a chair in the 
 vestibule. All was hurry and alarm. 
 Whilst others were searching for reme- 
 dies, and her uncle was supporting her 
 head, I hazarded to open the door into 
 the garden, observing that the air Avas 
 mild, and would restore her. It evi- 
 dently was useful, for she gave signs of 
 returning consciousness, but again re- 
 lapsed. "Take oif that cravat," said I,

 "and let her have more air. I opened the 
 sash, . which was nearer to her than the 
 door. Whilst giving this direction, the 
 captain obeyed. Judge of our sensations 1 
 Her throat was black and bruised by a 
 violent grasp, and her bosom lacerated 
 hy what appeared to be the strokes of a 
 cane or horse-whip. " God of Heavca 
 and of earth !" groaned out the captain, 
 " what means all this ? To what am I 
 doomed 1" â€” '^ My dear captain," said 
 the almost breathless Lady Maclairn, 
 who now approached with some remedy,

 Your sister has been to blame; she is 
 sensible of it: she bitterly repents of her 
 violence: she has suffered, severely suf- 
 fered for it; all will still be well, only 
 have patience." He heeded her not, but 
 with a look of horror and apparent calm- 
 ness, he surveyed for some moments 
 the marks of the outrage which had 
 been committed ; then wrapping the

 shawl round the still insensihle girl, he 
 attempted to raise her in liis arms; but 
 they refused the office. Miss Flint now 
 ventured to open the door, to order the 
 servants to be summoned, and to carry 
 Mary upstairs, loudly reprehending us 
 for exposing her to the air. " Shame to 
 thy sex, begone!" cried the captain 
 vvith fury. " Urge me not, thou barba- 
 rian ! But art thou not here to exult 
 over thy victim?" He again drew off the 
 shawl. '' This is Howard's child, Lucre- 
 tia'" continued he, " this is thy sister's 
 orphan!" A heavy sigh from Mary drew 
 his attention again ; he attempted to 
 raise her; but his limbs trembled to that 
 degree, that he was forced to desist. 
 The prompt, the ever-succouring Allen 
 gave ]\Ialcolm a sign. He took Mary in his 
 arms, and carried her to my room, follow- 
 ed by ^Irs. Allen. The captain was on the 
 point of doing so likewise, when J\Iiss

 expression with which he replied. '' Yes â€¢ 
 I doubt it not ! So did her hapless vir- 
 tuous mother ! so did her noble-minded

 to Heaven, moved his lips as though in 
 silent ejaculation. ** No," said he in a 
 solemn tone of voice, ** I will not curse

 tia, will call you to answer for this deed!" 
 *'Hear me ! only hear me !" screamed she. 
 " I only punished her insolence. I will 
 justify myself!" â€” '' Never canst thou do 
 ^/?Â«if," replied he, *^ where humanity re- 
 sides." He broke from her and turned 
 into the garden. A violent fit succeeded 
 to Miss Flint's efforts ; the servants with 
 difficulty conveyed her, in her struggles, 
 to her apartment, from whence even I 
 'heard her screams. On entering my 
 room, I found Miss Howard laid on the

 not get up stairs!" â€” '' Say not so," ob- 
 served the soothing ]\Irs. Allen, " but 
 rather, my dear child, be thankful to Pro- 
 vidence who has thus seasonably checked 
 your aunt's violence ; such a temper re- 
 quired it.'* Mr. Flint entered the room, 
 no longer was his face gloomy, and his 
 eyes sparkling with rage. He was pale 
 and languid, and sitting down by his 
 uiece, he shed tears like an infant. " The 
 coach is preparing," said he at length, 
 *' can you make the effort my child ? 
 I leave' not this accursed house without 
 you." â€” *^I am much better, I am able to 
 go any where with you," replied the poor 
 girl ; ** but my dear, dear uncle ! leave

 tion; **go to your parents' grave; see her 
 w^ork there! Remember_ the protection 
 she promised youl But I will be just/' 
 continued he, suppressing his rising pas- 
 sions, ^^ to my credulity, to my easy 
 faith, you must attribute these scourges. 
 But who," continued he, turning to us, 
 " could have conceived that any hand 
 could have inflicted such cruelty on a

 But we will depart, my child, tothat home 
 where your bruises will be healed, and I 
 shall be justly reproved for the pride and 
 ambition which caused them. Your 
 asylum is secure, and you will have bread

 My hitherto restrained tears now flowed 
 abundantly : it was well for me they did, 
 for the throbbing in my temples was ex- 
 cruciating. I attempted to speak ; but I

 could only say witli extreme emotion, 
 ** Dismiss your fears for her, her happi-

 thanks I received. The coach drew up, 
 and ^lalcolm entered the room. Whilst 
 Mrs. Alkn prepared Mary, he said in a 
 whisper, ''- I leave my father to you. 
 Miss Flhit is in strong convulsions, the 
 doctor is sent for, and my mother is 
 dreadfully alarmed." He carried Mary 
 to the carriage, and accompanied her and 
 the captain to the Abbey.

 I recollected this circumstance with a 
 sensation of terror undefinable at this 
 moment ; and quickening my steps, met 
 a servant whom I believe I frightened by 
 my eagerness, for in reply to my question, 
 he said, with some hesitation of manner,

 with me to look for him. I saw the 
 conclusion he had drawn, and therefore, 
 with collected ease, rephed that I should 
 soon meet him. 
 
 For sometime, however, the object of 
 my search eluded me ; at last I perceived 
 him sitting in a nook so concealed, that 
 it serves the gardener for his rollers, &c. 
 He resembled a statue rather than a living 
 creature ; and was so lost in thought, vhat 
 he neither heard my steps nor saw me 
 when I stood before him. He was speak- 
 ing, however, and I heard him say, 
 " Are there no remedies? Is she dead? 
 Will not Heaven spare her? Destruction 
 must have monsters for its work!" â€” I 
 took his hand and he started. '* I come 
 to seek you," said * in a cheerful tone; 
 " Miss Howard is recovered, and gone 
 home with her uncle. I want you to 
 give me some coffee.'' He looked at me.â€”

 spoke. ** Your daughter, 3^our adopted 
 daughter, my dear Sir Murdock, is near 
 you," observed I, *' but you do not heed 
 her. It is cold here, and she begs you to 
 enter tlie house." I gently took him by 
 tlie arm ; he again started as from a 
 dream. â€” '' My dear Miss Cowley," said 
 he, rising, *' is it you that I see here !"' â€” 
 I repeated my entreaties, and he instantly 
 took the way to the house and inquired 
 whether Miss Howard had seen his wife 
 before she left the hall. " Lady Mac- 
 lairn has been with Miss Flint," replied 
 I, ^' who is ill; but we shall all rejoice at 
 the events of this day when more com- 
 posed. Mary Howard shall never want

 cence has been oppressed and ill-used? 
 My supposed infirmity of mind, â€” would 
 to God it were only supposition ! â€” -may 
 screen me from ignominy with the cha- 
 ritable. But can generosity or candour 
 find an apology for my wife? Will it

 which Miss Howard received from her

 that, in order to spare the offender, she 
 concealed it from tlie poor suffering-

in her family would not refute it, and 
 bear witness to her gentleness and huma- 
 nity. Every one has seen her unremit- 
 ting attentions to Miss Howard's com- 
 fort, and her endeavours to render her 
 aunt kinder to her. She trusted that 
 Mary's assiduities would, in time, soften 
 down the asperities of Miss Flint's tem- 
 per. She knew that her interference 
 would be liable to misconstructions ; and 
 though she has suffered but little less than 
 Miss Howard, since her residence here, 
 yet she has not dared to oppose her 
 remaining, lest it should be thought that 
 she feared her influence might be un- 
 friendly to her son's interest. I have 
 seen Lady Maclairn's difficulties from 
 the first hour of my being here," con- 
 tinued I, "I have seen her miserable on

 a scene of such violence would have been 
 death. But is it not incomprehensi-

 should have retained for this woman an 
 affection so determined and so constant? 
 Why does she persist in living with her? 
 Why subject herself to mortifications and 
 degradations to please her caprice ? 
 ** Lady Maclairn is human ;" replied I 
 with a smile, " she is a mother, and

 more exalted, which prompt her zeal.

 What would she be without Lady Mac-

 little humanity which she does shew?" â€” 
 The baronet appeared silently to ac- 
 quiesce in my sentiments ; but I found he 
 was again withdrawn into his own mind. 
 I, however, found it not difficult to 
 rouse him; for on my observing that

 poor Lady Maclaim would be anxious 
 for his safety in so chilling an air, he 
 quickened his steps. His wife was in- 
 deed anxious ! She burst into tears on 
 seeing him, and the interesting Sir Mur- 
 dock seemed to have no care but that of 
 soothing her distress. '^ You must listen 
 to Miss Cowley, my Harriot," said he, 
 *' she will teach you to rejoice at the 
 captive's deliverance." â€” '* I could and 
 should rejoice," answered she, ^' that 
 poor Mary is freed from the hardest of 
 all servitudes, did I not see Lucretia so 
 struck with a sense of her fault and dis- 
 grace as to be in danger of her life. She 
 is an unhappy woman," added she, with 
 emotion, " and I cannot help pitying 
 her." No reply was made. Mrs. Allen 
 now entered with the coffee, and I found 
 by her report, that in getting Miss Flint 
 to her room, the servants, unable to 
 hold her in her struggles, had let her slip 
 from their arms, and she had hurt her knee 
 very much ; she was, liowever, asleep ;

 the doctor had seen her, and the servants 
 had got a respite. Mary was composed 
 and much better. I retired to my 
 room, and continued to solace my 
 mind by viewing this day of Mary's 
 emancipation as a happy event. I really 
 considered the horse- whipping part of 
 the business with the stoical indifference 
 of a mail-coach driver, when 1 contrasted 
 it with the good effects it was likely to 
 produce. In a week Mary may forget 
 the discipline, and all will be well ; but I 
 sincerely wish it may lead Miss Fhnt to 
 consider whether it might not turn to 
 good account to scourge herself, ]Mo- 
 derate flagellation would neither hurt /jer

 Miss Cowley to Miss Hardcastle, 
 
 Wednesday Evening. 
 
 X Know, my dear Lucy, that you will 
 expect the sequel of the disastrous tale 
 contained in my last letter ; and that you 
 will very ingeniously contrive to muster 
 up many conclusive arguments to prove 
 that Rachel Cowley's health will be ab- 
 solutely ruined at Tarefield. Facts are, 
 however, stubborn things. She has 
 passed this trial of her strength without

 a fever on her nerves, notwithstanding 
 a cold which, on Monday and yesterday, 
 gave her a pretence for keeping her apart- 
 ment and nursing the poor baronet. 
 
 On the Monday morning Malcolm 
 gave me to understand, with visible un- 
 easiness, that his father had betaken him- 
 self to the lately deserted room, with the 
 grated windows, and he implored me to 
 endeavour to allure him from it. I wrote 
 a card instantly, informing him I waited 
 breakfast for him, and that I had a new 
 book for his perusal. It succeeded; 
 but I was shocked to see the effects of 
 one night's disturbance of that mind, 
 which we had exultingly seen settling into 
 tranquillity. He was shivering and lan- 
 guid, and told his wife he had taken cold ; 
 but she perceived, as well as myself, that 
 he was dispirited and extremely nervous. 
 Nothing can equal this woman ! To see 
 her at this moment, I could not but love 
 her. She was calm and cheerful ; sooth-

 various ways she diverted his attention ; 
 and although I knew she had watched at 
 ]\Iiss Fhnt's bedside from three o'clock, 
 she did not name her, nor did she ap- 
 pear fatigued. I took my turn to be good, 
 and, dismissing her, said, that as I had 
 also a cold, the valetudinarians would 
 have but one infirmary ; that she might 
 dispose of Mrs. Allen, for we meant to be 
 in the sullens and read. Sir Murdock 
 raised his dejected head ; the eye was ani- 
 mated, and 1 was contented. I took my 
 work and placed before him the Vicar 
 of Wakefield. '* Shall I not read it 
 aloud?" asked he. â€” '* No," replied I, 
 *' unless you find a passage that particu- 
 larly strikes you." He bowed, for Sir 
 Murdock Maclairn is the truly polite 
 man. I soon perceived that his atten- 
 tion was engaged. Whose is not, Lucy,

 fatal grief which will, whilst he lives, 
 oppress his mind. Mrs. Allen soon 
 joined us; she Avas also the invalid; 
 but it slackened not her industry. She 
 took up your hearth-rug. Her dose of 
 camphor-julap went round, and Gold- 
 smith had too many beauties for the 
 baronet to be long silent. The morning 
 thus glided away, and we dined where 
 we were. Malcolm, with undissembled 
 joy, found us comfortable, and the 
 evening was given to the chess-board. I 
 slept, Lucy, for I had passed the day in 
 blunting the barbed arrow, which, if I 
 am not much mistaken, still wounds 
 SirMurdock. â€” Tuesday was fair ; I want- 
 ed a ride ; the curricle and my knight 
 were in readiness ; and we returned home 
 the better for our long airing. This 
 morning it was Mrs. Allen's turn to wish 
 for a ride, and the good Sir Murdock 
 with alacrity indulged her wish.

 Malcolm and myself, immediately after 
 their departure, took the road to the 
 Abbey. To say the truth, I felt a little 
 fine-ladyish, and walked not with my 
 usual alertness. My good naturcd es- 
 cort, perceived it. " I am astonished/* 
 observed he, slackening his pace, and 
 offering me his arm, " to see your spirits 
 and perseverance ! You are now so fa- 
 tigued, that any other but yourself would 
 fancy this walk improper for you.'' â€” "The 
 sun cheers me," replied I, " and idleness 
 will yield to this bracing air." â€” " Your 
 motives," answered he, *' will always give 
 animation and vigour to your mind ; for 
 it seems to me, that it is the business of 
 your life to communicate joy or con- 
 solation to all around you ! Tell me," 
 continued he, " that your recompence is

 fercnce you must feel for them, I see you 
 cheerful, and apparently contented, in a 
 situation marked for the residence of 
 care; but my admiration of your mag- 
 nanimity, Miss Cowley, has not, nor 
 cannot lessen my regrets at seeing you 
 sacrificed to these duties by an usurped 
 authority over your freedom. Tarefield 
 cannot be otherwise than a place of ba- 
 nishment to you." â€” "Spare your com- 
 passion, my good friend,'' answered I, 
 '* till you have my warrant for indulging 
 it I should be ungrateful, as well as 
 childish, were I discontented in your

 selves; but, notwithstanding your ge- 
 nerous assertion, I have myself witnessed 
 your surprise and vexation at my mo- 
 ther's submissions to Miss Flint, and at 
 the subordinate station she fills in her 
 own house, for such is at present Tarefield- 
 hall. It cannot but appear extraordinary 
 to you, to see two women so diametri- 
 cally opposite in character and temper 
 as my mother and this woman, so con- 
 nected, that neither the capricious ex- 
 actions on the one part, nor the decided . 
 love of praise and independence on the 
 other, can Aveaken the ties which have 
 united them. It is by no means a solu- 
 tion of this enigma with me, to be re- 
 minded, that my mother submits to this 
 galling yoke from the consideration of 
 her son Philip's interest. I know she is 
 neither sordid nor designing ; and that 
 she would prefer poverty, were she at 
 liberty to chuse, rather than invade on 
 the least of my father's wishes, much less

 for years Tarefield has been irksome to 
 him. Sometimes I think," continued 
 Malcolm, *^ that my mother conceives 
 herself bound to the fulfilment of a pro- 
 mise made to her first husband, to remain 
 for her life with his favourite daughter. 
 Mr. Flint might, without any miraculous 
 powers, have foreseen that neither his 
 wealth nor Lucretias qualities, could se- 
 cure her, ifdestitue of a friend like my 
 mother, who has incessantly laboured to 
 lumianize her. But I am persuaded, that 
 if such a promise had paused her lips, she 
 would have thought it sacred ; and yet 
 she was once on the point of breaking her 
 chains." â€” Malcolm paused, as expecting 
 my answer. *'I have been told," ob- 
 served I, "that Miss Flint once loved 
 your uncle; may not this circumstance 
 have had its weight with Lady Maclairn?" 
 *' It has not been overlooked by me,'* 
 answered Malcolm; ** but if there eve

 did exist a mutaal passion between Fla- 
 mall and Miss Flint, it was worn out be- 
 fore I could discover it, or rather con- 
 verted into mutual hatred; except on ono 
 point of agreemeut, that of favouring 
 their idol Philip, and tormenting jne. 
 Their marked partiality was one means 
 employed to render my mother miserable; 
 and as for myself, I can with truth affirm 
 that my infant enjoyments, my youthful 
 pleasures, and I might add, the best af- 
 fections of my nature, were contracted 
 and checked by the influence of Mr- 
 Flamall and the jealousy of Miss Flint. 
 It is the peculiar privilege of my cun- 
 ning uncle, Miss Cowley, to eifect his 
 purposes by exciting fear ; and, extra- 
 ordinary as it may appear to you, he had 
 not only established its empire over my 
 meek mother, but also, over the tir- 
 magant Miss Flint. She was taught by 
 him, to consider me, even when in my 
 cradle, as an intruder on Philip's rights.

1*2 LADY MACLAIRN, 
 
 She regarded my mother's attachment to 
 me as unjust, and defrauding that child 
 of its exclusive claims to love. My mother 
 suckled me herself; her health had not 
 admitted of this duty when Philip was 
 born; and from this advantage, I con- 
 ceive, resulted her apprehensions, that 
 my dear mother loved me better than she 
 did my brother. How little was this 
 woman qualified to judge of lady Mac- 
 lairn !" continued Malcolm with emo- 
 tion. ^'Her wisdom alone counteracted the 
 pernicious effects of these prejudices, 
 longer than could have been expected. 
 Philip was my senior by nearly two years: 
 he was a sweet-tempered child, and, di- 
 rected by his mother, constantly disposed 
 to play with me; but I was a sturdy, 
 active boy, and soon equal to Philip in 
 strength and stature. His compliances 
 with my wishes were checked by his 
 uncle and aunt, as being improper, and 
 leading him into mischief. My daring

 spirit was called an insolent one, and my 
 careless indifference to favour, was stiled 
 obduracy and stubbornness. Secure of my 
 mother's protection, and contented with 
 my own pursuits, I continued to live 
 with Philip on good terms, till I saw 
 preparations going forward for his being 
 placed at Harrow school. Conscious that 
 I had abilities for learning, I felt mor- 
 tified, that no plan for my improvement 
 had been thought of; and I saw Philip 
 depart with emotions not remote from 
 envy. 
 
 " From that hour, I felt ill-will towards 
 my unoffending brother, and was sti- 
 mulated by a proud sense of injustice, to 
 shun his kindness, and to refuse his good 
 offices. At this junction, I found a 
 welcome at Mr. Wilson's house, and a 
 companion and friend in Henry Heartley. 
 Mr. Flamall and Miss Flint were displeased 
 with the frequency of my visits. I was 
 lectured by my uncle, and sternly ad-

 mother approves of my going there,* 
 rephed I, * and as I am not sent to school 
 hke my brother, it is my business to get 
 learning where I can find it/ * And Avho 
 prevents your mother sending you to 
 school?' replied he with a sneer: 'some 
 of your Scotch relations would find and 
 instruct you for ten pounds a year, and 
 get money by you.' VThey could not for 
 any sum,' answered I, * give me the 
 lessons I receive from you: for, if like my 
 father, they must be gentlemen and ho- 
 nourable men,' His rage was exhausted 
 by the usual epithets, I was * an insolent 
 puppy, a stubborn dog,' and my pride 
 was that of beggary. I may have merited 
 som^ of this censure; for certain it is that 
 not even my mother could prevail upon 
 me to bend to my supercilious uncle, or 
 to pay my court to Miss Lucretia, even 
 when she relaxed into good humour. I 
 carefully shunned her, and was silent in

 her presence. ]\Iy father's unhappy ma- 
 lady quickened my sensibiUty, and gave 
 poignancy to the reflections which were 
 forced upon me. Flamall's tone of au- 
 thority cut me to the soul ; and his want 
 of tenderness to my wretched mother, 
 produced in my mind a rooted an aver- 
 sion to this man, which I can neither con- 
 quer, nor do I wish to conquer it. *0h Miss 
 Cowley 1" continued he, " it is impossi- 
 ble for me to say what my mother's suf- 
 ferings have been ! Unsupported, she 
 watched over her husband with unremit- 
 ting care, patience, and love ! She has 
 been his saving angel i And when dis- 
 ease and despair triumphed over their 
 victim, her soothings and her faithfulness, 
 were the healing balm that lulled him to 
 repose.

 I found my mother in the garden iii an 
 agony of tears ; and on my urging her to 
 tell me what had so affected her, she 
 informed me, that Mr. Flamall had been 
 talking to her of the absolute necessity 
 of placing my father in a private mad- 
 house near Durham ; insisting upon it, 
 that her indulgence was pernicious and 
 would render him incurable. M have 
 told Lucretia,' added she, ' that I wish 
 to be any where, rather than be a burden 
 to her, or further ex posed to my brother's 
 unfeeling advice in a business with which 
 he has nothing to do. She has gene- f 
 rously resented this conduct of your 
 uncle's, and they have had a very serious 
 quarrel ; but it will be settled, as most 
 are, at my expence !'â€” * But is there no

 sentment, ' but a mad-house ? Even that

 judgment and skill than any here, must 
 pronounce my father a lunatic, before 
 even his wife has the right of confining 
 him to a mad-house. Sir Murdock Mac- 
 lairn needs neither a cell nor the strait 
 waistcoat.' My uncle aimed a blow at 
 my head with a stout cudgel he had in 
 his hand, by way of reply to my obser- 
 vation ; and the first and only favour I 
 have to acknowledge to Miss Flint, was 
 probably, saving me from a fractured 
 skull, for the weapon was heavy and 
 knobbed. She not only warded off the 
 stroke/ but with amazing strength held 
 his arms. I smiled with contempt at his 
 fury. * Your mode of attack,' said I 
 with cool scorn, ' is consistent with 
 yourself; but remember I am Maclairri's 
 son for the future, and that I am not 
 enfeebled by sickness, nor mad. I fear 
 you not ; for I despise you.' My poor 
 mother franticly implored me to retire : 
 I was deaf to her intreaties. Miss Flint's

 rhetoric and amazonian power prevailed. 
 She dragged Mr. Flamall from the spot, 
 foaming with rage, and bestowing his 
 maledictions, instead of his cudgel^ on 
 my head. From that hour we never ex- 
 changed a word, beyond the few which 
 were necessary at our meals. 
 
 ** I have reason to believe that Miss Flint 
 on this occasion was not displeased with 
 the * stubborn dog.' It is certain, that 
 she behaved to me with more civility 
 than ordinary for some time after this 
 proof of my obstinacy: the mad-house 
 was never mentioned from that period. 
 
 ** It may not be improper to account to 
 you. Miss Cowley, for the resentment 
 I felt on the mere proposal of this mea-

 ginated from a dreadful illness, brought 
 on by a sudden stroke of adversity when 
 he was a young man ; to this, was to be

 attributed a peculiarity in his general 
 habits of hfe, and a tincture of sadness, 
 which shaded his character, and repress- 
 ed his activity. But during his long 
 confinement he constantly knew me, 
 and his wife ; and was apparently easy, 
 and even tranquil, when we were by his 
 side, though terror and alarm followed 
 on every intrusion by others ; and an 
 unusual noise, or step, produced silence 
 and dejection on him for hours ; nay, 
 sometimes days. At other times, we had the 
 cheering consolations of hope to support 
 us. He would examine my little draw- 
 ings, sketch with a pencil a more cor- 
 rect outline, check me when playing out 
 of time on my flute, and beat the mea-

 my mother, he would listen, and ob- 
 serve, * I remember something of that

 had disappeared, yet it confirmed me in 
 my hopes that time would restore my

 father. Under this conviction you may 
 judge that I was not disposed to hsten 
 with patience to the opinion and brother- 
 ly counsel of Flamall, who had by a 
 thousand indications, shewn me that my 
 father's fate was perfectly indifferent to

 sistance; and in the fulness of my heart, 
 I mentioned my difficulty to Captaia

 from the first of my intimacy with Henry 
 Heartley, whom he educated : but from 
 this time, he wrote to my mother, and

 " My brother's recall from Edinburgh 
 was, in the course of events, the next 
 occurrence of importance to me. This 
 summons was in consequence of Mr. 
 Oliver Flint's earnest wish to see his 
 young brother. Death had bereaved him 
 of his two last surviving children, boys, 
 nearly of Phihp's age; and to this invita- 
 tion to my brother, were added promises 
 of receidng him as his heir. Mr. Fla- 
 mall's opinion had weight with my mo- 
 ther, for it included his resolution of 
 going with his nephew to Jamaica, the 
 better to understand, and to secure to 
 him the advantages held out. Miss Flint 
 calculated her brother Oliver's age and 
 fortune, and recalled to her memory the 
 extensive and beautiful plantation on 
 which she had first seen the light. Ava- 
 rice combated with fondness; and she

 yielded, trusting to Mr. Flamall's care, 
 and the declining state of health of this 
 poor afflicted father, for her idol's return 
 to England. Phihp arrived at Tarefield 
 from the university ; I had not seen him 
 for a year and a half; and I was struck 
 by the improvement of his person. *He 
 was always handsome/ added Malcolm 
 smiling; * but the Adonis had given 
 place to more masculine comeliness ; and 
 his deportment was become serious, and 
 rather reserved. We had mutually at- 
 tained to those years which precluded 
 rudeness, and I was treated as a gentle- 
 man, and I hope I shewed him that I 
 was one ; yet I saw Philip's advances to 
 more familiarity like * a stubborn dog/ 
 for my heart receded from his civilities.

 avenue, in my way from the Abbey. He 
 appeared to be lost in thought, and I 
 fancied he was weeping. On perceiving

 I received his offered love ungraciously.

 conscience-struck, I cursed those Avhose

 lous to the pleadings of nature. I was 
 ashamed of my conduct ; and lest I 
 should afflict my mother, forbore to 
 mention this incident. From that hour

 I shunned Philip's eyes; for I felt his 
 superiority of temper a reproach; and 
 his increasing sadness became an intole- 
 rable weight on my spirits. Miss Flint's 
 dejection at this time appeared to have 
 changed her nature ; my mother's firm- 
 ness seemed to have the direction of her 
 will; and her fondness for * Harriot' 
 rose in proportion as the hour approach- 
 ed, when she was to lose sight of her 
 Philip. On the morning of Philip's de- 
 parture, I and my mother breakfasted 
 with him, at a very early hour, in Miss 
 Flint's apartment. Mr. Flamall vainly 
 tried to render the repast cheerful. The 
 servant announced that all was in readi- 
 ness. Philip rose with extreme agita- 
 tion, ' One embrace,' said he, * ex- 
 tending his arms and turning towards 
 me, * one embrace, Malcolm ! It may be 
 a brother's last request!, Let me depart 
 with the hope that if we do meet again,

 bosom with energy. ' We are united!' 
 cried I; * no distance or time shall sepa-

 I had ill chosen my time for pathetics, 
 and gravely reminded Philip to behave 
 like a man; but his lessons were useless; 
 for our attention was now called to Miss

 I should Hke to ride a horse of his. * 'Tis

 Flint. She paused, and after a struggle 
 with her feelings, said with some bitter- 
 ness, ' time must shew, how this bro-

 and determined not to invade on the 
 tranquillity which succeeded his absence, 
 I settled into reserve and civility with 
 Miss Lucretia Flint; and perhaps her 
 dislike of me might have settled into mere 
 indifference; but my sin was ever before 
 her ; for I persisted in loving my friends 
 at the Abbey : and in due time she was 
 informed, * that I courted Miss Heart-

 his whole hfe to his duty as a child, and 
 who was perfectly competent to judge of 
 his own situation in the world, should

 which his own prudence and regai'd to

 disturbance had roused my angry pas-

 Last night I told her with frankness, that 
 I would carry a musket for my bread, 
 rather than live in an abode in which my 
 father's peace was interrupted, and in 
 which she was a passive slave. â€” " And 
 what was her answer?" asked I. " Tears," 
 replied he, " tears, which when I behold,

 and to spare her on the only subject in 
 which she must contradict and oppose 
 me. * You will, I trust,' added she, * soon 
 have a home of your own : so do I fer- 
 vently hope /shall ; but when I quit this 
 house, Malcolm, it will be for the shelter 
 of my grave.' I was so struck by her 
 manner, that I am determined to press 
 her no farther on the subject, if I can 
 help it. In the mean time, I sometimes 
 think, that my dear mother is secretly 
 governed in this abject submission, from 
 her wish to promote my union with 
 AHce : it may be, Miss Flint has pro- 
 mised her to advance a sum of money 
 for my establishment. Yet, my dear 
 Miss Cowley, never did there exist a 
 more noble and disinterested woman, 
 than Lady Maclairn ! and she well knows 
 that both Miss Heartley and myself 
 would reject Miss Flint's favours with 
 scorn. We have comforts which she 
 cannot invade, nor could we relish any

 Malcolm had touched a chord in my 
 bosom. ** You are to be envied," said I 
 with eagerness. ** How many are there^ 
 with your honour and fidelity, who 
 have not your consolations ! Alice is a 
 happy creature to some I could name." 
 He pressed my arm to his breast. '' Nei- 
 ther Miss Heartley, nor her Malcolm 
 deserves to be happy," said he, '* if they 
 could be so, knowing you otherwise.' 
 I blushed : '* I know your difficulties," 
 added he, '* if I be condemned for hating 
 with a perfect hatred, I must look to 
 you for my excuses. But I have omitted 
 to tell you, that I wrote to Philip before

 kind letter. To one I wrote him after his 
 arrival in Jamaica, I have had no an- 
 swer. Mr. Flamall is at the bottom of 
 this mischief; and trusting to this con- 
 jecture, I wrote again to my brother, 
 and by this means gave Mr. Flamall a 
 full evidence of being still incorrigible in 
 respect to my duty as his nephezv. But, 
 my dear Miss Cowley, the reign of a 
 Flamall is short ; we sliall see him in a 
 very different point of view, before he 
 quits the stage, or I am much deceived." 
 â€” "And I shall be much disappointed," 
 said I with emotion ; '^and what is more, 
 Mr. Maclairn, it shall not be my fault 
 if he does not repent." The girls now 
 perceiving us, advanced to meet us; and 
 Malcolm forgot his dear uncle. 
 
 What will you say of a mother so 
 beloved, and so extolled as Lady Mac- 
 lairn? She is still an enigma to me. I

 no influence, but what is supported by

 hard that I must hear my brother is well, 
 &c. &c. by a breach of duty on your

 you could keep to the letter of your fa- 
 ther's harsh law ? He, above all men,

 The captain, after our first greetings, 
 the other morning, drew me aside, and 
 with some solemnity thanked me for the 
 " generous" concern I had shewn in fa- 
 vour of his niece. ^' I feel," added he, 
 that my honour demands its acquittal 
 from you : and till you know my mo- 
 tives for resigning up an orphan commit- 
 ted to my care, to the authority and di- 
 rection of Miss Flint, I am certain you 
 must blame me. I am however unequal 
 to the recital of events, which ought to 
 have forewarned me, that hatred and 
 envy were incurable. My error arose 
 from my ignorance of tlieir unbridled 
 power over minds in which they have 
 once taken up their abode. Heaven be 
 ])raised ! my poor girl is once more in

 when I quit her, she will find her ]Maker

 in that hope," answered I, with serious- 
 ness ; " for already hath he appointed 
 an agent for the purposes of his fatherly 
 goodness : and when I forsake this young 
 and innocent heing, may his bounteous

 ent, and more worthy channel ! I want 
 a sister," said I smiling ** and you must 
 give me one !" He bowed, and without 
 replying hastily retired. 
 
 Mary, with her muslin wrappers, and 
 still languid complexion, never appeared 
 more amiable: she assumed however 
 more gaiety than she felt ; for I saw with 
 satisfiiction, that she was anxious about 
 her uncle. '^ I will shew you my little 
 chamber," said she in a caressing tone ;

 ing myself on her little white dimity bed,

 that, by concealing so long your aunt's

 barely sufficient for himself! I was un- 
 fortunately not fitted for labour, and too 
 young to encounter the M^orld without 
 friends, in any situation. I thought I 
 had reasonable claims on my aunt; and 
 how was it possible for me to conceive 
 that she would be unkind to me, because 
 she had been cruel to my parents?" Her 
 tears flowed unrestrainedly. ** When she 
 proposed taking me," continued the art- 
 less girl, ^'and said, I should no longer be 
 a burden on my uncle, I felt I loved her; 
 and as she had no longer Mr. Philip to 
 comfort her in her solitude, I hoped to 
 render myself both useful and agreeable

 lot was not harder than that of thou-

 was harsh, and her behaviour discourag- 
 ing, I met with kindness from all be- 
 sides, and was sheltered from evil. Was 
 I not right to submit, and keep my se-

 hither ; and then my uncle would have 
 had me on his hands again, and his dif- 
 ficulties would have been renewed : so I 
 own, I always made the best of every 
 thing, and parried as well as I could 
 Mr. Malcolm's accounts, which often 
 grieved Mrs. Heartley and Alice. My 
 unlucky fainting fit has spoiled all ! and 
 what is worse, again separated Miss Flint 
 from my uncle's favour! He says," whis- 
 pered she, '' that he cannot forgive her : 
 and tills grieves me to the heart ; for my 
 dear mother did forgive her ; and I long 
 to tell my aunt that her brother will for- 
 get this offence." â€” " What could urge

 behind us. Mr. Snughead slackened his 
 pace and accosted Mr. Wilson, by say- 
 ing, ' If you be not as happy as the tur- 
 tles I have passed, you seem more g ay ^ Mr. 
 Wilson ;' and he fixed his eyes with 
 curiosity on me. * A man must needs 
 have a bad conscience indeed !' replied 
 Mr. Wilson, with good-humour, *'ifin 
 so fine a night as this, and with such a 
 companion as I have, he were not gay.' 
 â€” ' You say right !' answered Mr. Snug- 
 head, still looking at me; '* you say 
 right,' repeated he, ' quite right,'' laugh- 
 ing loud, and winking his eyes strangely 
 at me ; ' such a companion would make 
 any night di fine night, without the aid 
 of the moon!' â€” ' That is a text, Mr. Par- 
 son," answered Mr. Wilson, angrily, 
 * that suits yoii better than your hearers. 
 I wish you safe home.' â€” * You are witty

 cent!' replied he, with another loud 
 lauo'h ; * but you are in good hands, there 
 is a time for all things !' So saying he 
 spurred his horse forwards. I was alarmed, 
 and told jNIr. Wilson I feared he had dis- 
 pleased Mr. Snughead. He said he had got 
 no more than he deserved ; that he was a 
 dirty rascal ; and he believed he was then 
 tipsy. Well, my dread of meeting my 
 aunt put all this out of my head ! You 
 know, my dear Miss Cowley, how for- 
 tunately that business finished. My pa- 
 tience on Monday conquered my aunt's 
 sullenness. On the Tuesday morning Mr. 
 Snughead came to visit her. He staid a 
 long time ; and I, well knowing how he 
 hates Mr. Wilson, became uneasy. At 
 length my aunt entered my chamber, 
 which is, as you know, over her's ; and

 banged the door with such violence as to 
 make that tremble also. ' A fine tale

 claimed she â€¢ * you can laugh and hoy-

 ' No, Madam,' answered I, * I have

 speech which occasioned his resentment. 
 He conceiv^ed, I presume, that it did not 
 become a clergyman ; and, to speak the 
 truth, I was of his opinion ; yet I was

 my face, * and I will teach you to un-

 struggling, for she grasped my throat so 
 hard that she hurt me. â€” ' What! you

 They gave me nothing but water-gruel 
 for three days, but their kindness and 
 compassion sweetened it. I sliali njver

 but I answered that I was determined, 
 for her honour, as much as my own safe-

 you may, at your pleasure, make me yours. 
 Treat me with kindness and I must be

 *'for I forgot to consult Miss Heartley's

 as she is herself the emblem of constancy, 
 she may prefer your favourite colour, 
 Mary: and in that case, what is to be 
 done? You must wear the true blue." 
 ** Just as she pleases," cried she from the 
 looking glass, before which she was fitting 
 her lawful prize ; "only I doubt, whether 
 Mr. Malcolm will not prefer the true 
 blue, and I can do without it." The 
 gratified uncle smiled on her, and said, 
 ** I beheve you, my love." Alice pre- 
 ferred her own colour, and each dis- 
 appeared with their fashions and finery.

56 LADY MACLAlRlJf, 
 
 I have engaged to meet Mary's friends 
 on Sunday; Mr. Greenwood, her god- 
 father, and a doctor Douglas, who an- 
 nually celebrate her birth-day at Mrs. 
 Wilson's table. She will be seventeen on 
 that day. On my leaving her, she fondly 
 kissed my cheek, and whispered, '' Does 
 my sister wish me to be dressed on Sun- 
 day like her happy protegee?'' â€” '' Always 
 as 7?ii/ sister ought to appear," answered I, 
 with emotion: '^ and as she will be enabled 
 to appear ; for the rest, she is to direct her 
 own toilet." '^Then 1 think on my birth- 
 day, it will be proper to wear' '' the 
 
 lilac," cried I gaily, retreating, having 
 exceeded my promised hour of returning 
 home. 
 
 On reaching the hall, I instantly enter- 
 ed the dining-parlour, in order to make 
 my peace with my friends ; but instead 
 of them, I found Miss Fhnt and the Re- 
 verend Mr. Snughead tite-a-tete. I 
 slightly curtseyed, and said I was glad to

 all possible speed, when Sir Murdock, with 
 his wife and Mrs. Allen, entered from my 
 apartment. The "truant" was welcomed; 
 and supper serv^ed up immediately. Mal- 
 colm, with head erect, and glowing face, 
 joined us; and our repast was coldly and 
 ceremoniously finished. The servants 
 M^ere no sooner withdrawn, than Mr.Snug- 
 liead pressed Miss Lucretia to drink a 
 glass of Mountain wine. " He was afraid 
 she lived too low." â€” '^ He was sorry to 
 see her so out of spirits." The restrained 
 tears gushed from her eyes. Yes, Lucy, 
 genuine salt tears came from the eyes of 
 this Flint! The miracle I can attest; 
 and you may believe it with the same faith 
 which you give toMoses's striking the rock, 
 and causing the water to flow. I am the 
 veriest fool in nature ; for I found, hke

 Snughead, looking round him with an 
 air which he thought dignified, and 
 which I pronounced insolent, '* I am 
 grieved, my dear Madam, to see you give 
 so much importance to a circumstance of 
 so little consequence to your character 
 and station ! I always foresaw what 
 would be the result of your generosity in 
 interfering in Miss Howard's concerns: 
 all your 7^eal friends were of my opinion.'* 
 â€” He looked at Lady Maclairn. â€” ''I know 
 you are quick in feeling, and warm in 
 your temper, and that on perceiving your 
 goodness slighted, you must be unhap- 
 py." â€” Malcolm left the room. ^' Pursue

 and leave her to those friends whom she

 I am sorry I struck her; it was wrong; 
 and although she provoked me, I ought 
 not to have done so. Indeed, Miss 
 Cowley, if you knew all, you would pity, 
 as well as blame me. But I see how it is; 
 my forgetfulness of myself has confirm- 
 ed in your mind all that my enemies 
 have said to my prejudice. Mary has 
 her revenge, and the Heartleys their 
 triumph !" â€” *' I am sorry. Madam," said 
 I, '* to be called lipon in a question of 
 this kind ; but qualified as I am to sup- 
 port the innocent, it behoves me to en- 
 deavour at least to rectify your opinions. 
 Miss Howard, whatever were her discon- 
 tents under this roof, kept them from her 
 friends at the Abbey. She never has di- 
 rectly, nor indirectly, discovered them to 
 me since I have been here. She is at this 
 hour more concerned by the discovery 
 of your harsh treatment, than for the

 loss of your favciur. She speaks of you 
 with respect, nay more, with tenderness 
 and sorrow. She dwells with eagerness 
 on the concessions which you generously 
 made; and attributes your warmth of re- 
 sentment, to your misconception of the 
 supposed offence. Mrs. Heartley sup- 
 ports her. Madam, in this moderation, 
 and labours to convince Mr. Flint that 
 lie has taken up this n^atter too painfully. 
 Mary Howard cannot balance m.any fa- 
 vours with one offence. She is aff'ecti- 
 otiate, placable, and unoffending; her 
 heart is too pure for malice or ill-will; 
 and her principles are too solid to permit 
 her to slander you. To Mrs. Heartley's 
 lessons and example she is principally in. 
 debted for these excellencies ; â€” to nature, 
 for a temper unrivalled in meekness."

 contemptuous eyes. '^ It is sufficient for 
 me to know her; and were other eviden- 
 ces of the excellencies of her character

 Mr, Steadman, He will probably satisfy 
 you, that Captain Flint has been singu-

 Mrs. Heartley is a kept mistress of as

 an aukvvard laugh; '' you are an excellent 
 encomiast." â€” " I can be no otherwise 
 Mdth such a subject for praise," retorted 
 I ; *' but what I most admire in Mrs. 
 Heartley's character, is her contempt of 
 malice, and her compassion for igno- 
 rance: with me, this is the test, not only of 
 her understanding, but of the purity of 
 her life. With a steady hand, Lucy, I 
 took my taper, and calmly w^ishing the 
 company a good night, retired ; the con- 
 founded Mr. Snughead, receiving my last 
 look as he stood erect to let me pass. He

 so ve?y young a lady, I had a "very de- 
 cided spirit; *' and to say the truth," 
 added he, rising and turning to the ba-

 of Miss Cowley's Avarmth, on a subject 
 of so little concern to me." Sir Mur-

 I am surprised, that a lady of her quick-

 conduct there, and also to night." â€” *' So 
 should I be," returned the baronet, " if she 
 did not, for they were pretty obvious ; and 
 Miss Cowley is not often dull in her ob-

 The servant announced the parson's

 not amount to that which this reptile 
 Mr. Snughead has produced in Rachel 
 Cowley's mind. Perhaps I was too 
 warm ; but what is to be done witli 
 antipathies ? I have no talent at a faint- 
 ing fit; I cannot scream, and look terri- 
 fied when I v>'ant only the strength of a 
 man, in order to grasp a despicable foe. 
 Nature, nature, my Lucy, is my divini- 
 ty ! to her do I owe my aversion of the 
 Snuo-heads' race; and wlien thev do fall 
 in my way, what is to be done? I cannot 
 crush them, as many do a poor harmless 
 spider; but I would probe them to the 
 quick, without flinching. Some vices I 
 can pity, but a spirit of defamation is 
 my abhorrence ; and an unworthy mi- 
 nister of a religion to which I am attach- 
 ed, as my suprenie good, is my antipathy. 
 So I beg you will recollect yours to a

 of heart as the one that stared me in the 
 face, would have called from our chris-

 abuse of his gifts, but even in tins hfe 
 you will be miserable by so doing; for

 lest she should have an hysteric fit: her 
 tears were, however, its preventive ; 
 and when somewhat more con^posed, she 
 requested me to give the servant the

 also my attempts to divert lier. These 
 succeeded so well, that she dined in the

 visits here; and every means should be 
 employed to effect a reconciliation be-

 Memoirs of the Flint Family, 
 
 My father, Mr. Oliver Flint, by a dili- 
 gent and persevering attention, and a 
 constant residence on his estate in Jamai- 
 ca, not only enlarged his property and in- 
 creased his wealth, but also acquired so 
 confirmed a predilection for the ])Iace in 
 which his prosperity had been always 
 flourishing, that he imagined the island 
 of Jamaica to be the most healthy spot in 
 the habitable globe ; and it was a frequent 
 topic of conversation with my mother,

 to prove to her, that the air was sahitary, 
 and that no one died at Jamaica, whom 
 intemperance did not conduct to the 
 grave. My mother was sensible that her 
 health had suffered in this ** terrestrial 
 paradise," and that it was hourly sinking 
 into debility ; but she left to her counte- 
 nance the office of confuting my father's 
 arguments, and suffered in silence. A 
 very dangerous fever with which my fa- 
 ther in his fiftieth year was attacked, in 
 spite of his sobriety and precautions, 
 effected a change in his opinions, and 
 probably preserved to my mother some 
 years of existence in this world. Jamaica 
 was no longer conceived to be without 
 the inconveniences of its tropical situa- 
 tion, and my father hastened his prepa- 
 rations to leave it. 
 
 Our family, at the period we embark- 
 ed for England, consisted of my brother 
 Oliver, my sister Lucretia, and myself, 
 who was the youngest.

 My mother, in her MJsh to return to 
 England, had been governed by motives 
 of advantage to her cliildrcn, as power- 
 fully as by a consideration for her own 
 liealth. The uncontrouied indulgence 
 which m} faiher granted us, bounded 
 his views ; our improvement constituted 
 no part of his cares; and the consequence 
 was, thai: Oliver and Lucretia, to use 
 his own words, had never been ill a day 
 in their lives. I was born less robufct, 
 and was reared with more difficulty. 
 My mother, in her tender cares, kept me 
 in her sight, and my mind was formed 
 to docility, and my sports to more quiet- 
 ness, than suited the vigorous Oliver, 
 and the romp my sister. I thus became 
 my mother's amusement; and to her 
 taste I am indebted for my love of lite- 
 rature and science. Our voyage was 
 pleasant, though tedious, Our accom- 
 modations were easy, for the vessel was 
 my father's; and in, the delights of the

 We settled in London; and a time wiis 
 given to repose and amusements; when, 
 again my mother's cheek faded, and I 
 took the alarm. Her maid-servant told 
 me, as a secret, that we should soon have 
 a nursery and a cradle to provide, and 
 that her master was looking out for a 
 â– country-house, in oj-kr that my mother 
 might be quiet. This plan was effected ; 
 the family removed to a handsome, spa- 
 cious house near Chelsea ; and such was 
 my father's solicitude for the quiet of his 
 wife, that he placed Oliver, then thir- 
 teen, in a commercial academy in the

 and in conformity with the wishes of his 
 Avife, Vvho was not to be contradicted, I 
 was sent to the Charter-house. 
 
 My father, who loved children, and 
 coveted them with as much avidity as 
 he did money, received the promised 
 blessing with transports of joy; and my 
 sister Mary's birth was commen; orated as 
 the renewal of his own life. With fond 
 delight he shewed the infant to his 
 friends, and exultingly pointed out to 
 them the promises of a face which was, 
 indeed, angelic ! She did not disappoint 
 these early presages. As she advanced 
 in age, she exhibited a form and face 
 which perfectly corresponded Mith a 
 temper of unequalled sweetness; and 
 with such graces, it was no wonder she 
 was beloved even to adulation by my 
 father, and the whole Jiouse. 
 
 An artist of some celebrity, and more 
 skill, requested permission to take her

 picture. She was then in her eighth year, 
 and the painter succeeded so happily, 
 that he gained credit by exhibiting his 
 work, and induced my father to have a 
 full-length portrait of my mother, with 
 Mary. This picture was my father's 
 pride ; an engraving was made from it, 
 and scores of prints were sent to Jamaica, 
 in order to convince our friends there, 
 that the elaborate praises they had lieard 
 of this paragon of nature, did not exceed 
 her beauty. 
 
 This instance of my father's fond ad- 
 miration of Ids child, and in which he 
 was countenanced by all who knew her, 
 would not have found a place here, but 
 for the inferences I drew from it. I liad 
 long perceived that Lucretia did not 
 partake with us in the partiality we ma- 
 nifested for the innocent and bewitching 
 Mary. I had seen the envy with which 
 she regarded every proof of kindness and 
 favour shewn to her; the spiteful misre-

 presentations wliicli she gave of her dis- 
 position to strangers; and the contempt 
 she discovered for the weakness of my 
 father's adulation of his darling. During 
 the time she was sitting for her picture, 
 the artist was become a favoured guest at 
 our table; and, with apparent sincerity, he 
 observed one day, that a Guido alone 
 could do justice to Mary's style of beauty. 
 I saw Lucretia colour with vexation; and 
 that very afternoon 1 rescued the poor 
 child from her correcting hands, to whom 
 with some resentment, I said, that I 
 should inform my father and i^other of 
 her severity and violence. *^ Do so !" 
 answered she, bursting into tears, " tell

 gave the beauty a sound box on the ear,

 never excuse her faults with me." The

 oifended her, imploring her forgiveness 
 and soUciting to be friends. 
 
 I believe my prudent mother had ob- 
 served the discontents of her eldest 
 daughter as soon as myself; and in order 
 to preserve the peace of the family, she 
 studied to give Lucretia a consequence 
 in it which she judged might satisfy, at 
 least, her love of power. On her leaving 
 school, my mother treated her as a young- 
 woman on whom she depended for as- 
 sistance in the domestic concerns of the 
 family. Oliver and myself were ordered 
 to treat her with deference, and the ser- 
 vants were taught to respect Miss Flint's 
 orders as her own. She continually prais- 
 ed her good qualities, and treated her 
 with the utmost kindness and confidence. 
 But Lucretia exercised her authority ra- 
 ther too much like a despot; my brother 
 and myself were not always passive sub- 
 jects; and the servants murmured under 
 the controul of the young house-keeper.

 My father's tranquillity was thus in- 
 vaded, and he determined on a measure, 
 Avhich, had it succeeded, would have re- 
 stored order in his house. But Miss Flint 
 was a plain girl; and my good father 
 found that neither the frequent intima- 
 tions M'hich he gave of his liberal fortune, 
 and designs in her favour, nor the com- 
 mendations he bestowed on her good sense 
 and notability, produced any overtures of 
 a matrimonial kind for his daughter. Lu- 
 cretia, estimating her fortune and pre- 
 tensions, was too proud ^\ to undervalue 
 herself," and with manners never pleas- 
 ing, she was overlooked by men whose 
 fortune needed not trafficking for awife. 
 This period of her youth, of course, pas- 
 sed unpleasantly; and conscious that she 
 was neither a favourite with her own sex 
 nor the other, she disdained both, and 
 acquired a severity of speech, and a point- 
 ed incivility of behaviour to all around 
 her.

 I had in the course of these events 
 quitted my situation at the Charter- 
 house. ]\Iy partiality towards my sister 
 Mary had not been unnoticed. Lucretia 
 classed me with those whom she despised; 
 and I met this indifference, it may be, 
 with too much carelessness. In the mean 
 time, my dear mother's influence was 
 again exerted in my favour; but she 
 gained her point with some difficulty. 
 My father ungraciously observing, that 
 he saw she was determined to have me 
 learned and useless. He had no interest 
 but such as his commercial concerns 
 gave him; and he only Avished, that I 
 might not in the end blame her for an 
 ambition so little profitable to my future 
 fortune in life. My mother prevailed, 
 and I was sent to Oxford. Satisfied wuth 
 this extorted compliance, she saw me for 
 two or three years happy in my pur- 
 suits, and the friend of my tutor; and 
 wherefore, my dear Madam, should I

 suppress the glory of iny life ? She saw 
 nie her pride and hope ! Her discernment 
 in chosing the moment propitious to her 
 applications in my behalf, and her gentle 
 arguments in my favour had their effect; 
 they could not make my father generous; 
 but they prevented him from being mean; 
 and my oeconomy rendered his bounty 
 sufficient. 
 
 At this period of my history, I received 
 the melancholy summons to attend my 
 mother, whose life was in danger. Too 
 soon were these apprehensions verified ! I 
 will pass over a sorrow which your feehng 
 heart has known, and which Avas the tri- 
 bute tliat every child must pay to the 
 loss of a good parent. My mother ap- 
 peared to have settled her accounts with 
 this world, but as they related to Mary, 
 then nearly fourteen. She spoke of her 
 approaching dissolution with calmness 
 and the hopes of a christian. '* I have/' 
 said she to me, ^*only one anxiety to

 myself up to my merciful maker. But 
 the mother is yet too busy for my re- 
 signation. You Pereival, are my hope ; 
 you see the fpartial hand of nature has 
 endowed your sister Mary with a beauty, 
 which all must acknowledge; I dread 
 it, as her misfortune. You know her 
 artless, unsuspecting natnre, the cheerful 
 gaiety of her temper, and her soft, com- 
 pliant disposition. Guard her, as you 
 'wish for a mother's blessing ! Your fa- 
 ther's pursuits in life, his excessive fond- 
 ness for his dear girl, and, I may say it to 
 you, liis want of mental attainments, 
 must disqualify him for the guide of her 
 youthful career. Your brother will soon be 
 so remote from her, that were he capable 
 of protecting her, his situation will render 
 him useless to her. Lucretia loves her 
 not, and from the violence of her temper 
 and the authority she will assume, every 
 thing pernicious is to be feared. Watch

 will end well for those who faint not. 
 The distance is short, and the recom-

 Tuggedness of the path, nor be dis-

 But I am forgetting my purpose, Madam, 
 in recalling the last words of my guardian 
 angel ! 
 
 My brother Oliver's voyage to Ja- 
 maica took place soon after my mother's 
 death, and his marriage and final settle- 
 ment in the island succeeded to these 
 events. In the following year, my father 
 purchased the estate of Tarefield, and 
 giving up his business to my brother, 
 and his old and faithful clerk, retired ta 
 the hall. His first sorrow for my mother's 
 loss, was so violent as to give us fears 
 for his hfe. His constitution was shaken 
 by a fever of some danger and duration. 
 On recovering from this peril, I could 
 not help perceiving that the gloom which 
 
 1 
 


## p. 97 (#101) #############################################

THE VICTIM OF VILLANY. 97 
 
 hung on his spirits, was tending to that 
 state of discontent which invariably pre- 
 cludes all the '' uses of adversity." Ac- 
 customed to seek, in the cheerful' and 
 conciliating temper of my mother, a 
 relief in all the httle petulancy of his own 
 unequal disposition, he lamented her loss 
 without ceasing, as a cojiveniejice, rather 
 than a blessing, which he had seen torn 
 from him. Lucretia, with unremitting 
 attention, endeavoured to regulate his 
 domestic comforts. Mary alone possessed 
 the power to calm and compose his fret- 
 ful hours ; she was indulged as a child, in 
 return for her tender solicitude to amuse 
 and please him. I was useful to him iu 
 no way, and sunk into a cypher. 
 
 My father, in liis sorrow, had forgotten 
 to lament the loss of that benign influ- 
 ence, which had so skilfully counteracted 
 the encroachments of avarice. Left to his 
 natural bias, these soon appeared, and 
 Lucretia failed not to make an advantage

 of a weakness which her mother had 
 checked and restrained. Every reform in 
 the expences of the family met with ap- 
 probation, and my father insensibly gave 
 his confidence *' to his excellent ma- 
 nager." I silently submitted to the new 
 order of things. The time approached 
 for my emancipation from the restraints 
 of my father's house; I had taken my 
 degrees, and wished to pass one term 
 more at the university, before I so- 
 licited my ordination. I spoke to my 
 father on the subject, explaining to him 
 my motives for the request I urged. *^ I 
 have withdrawn your name from the 
 college books," said he, ^'more than a 
 week since. I see no good that can 
 result from your losing your time, and 
 spending my money there." I ventured 
 to remonstrate, urged my disappointment, 
 and added, that I had not been idle, but 
 had worked both for honour and inde- 
 pendence. ** Pray, Sir," asked he with a

 make yearly, of your learned lahouvsV 
 '* Even in deacon's orders," replied I, cut 
 to the very soul, '* I might have eaten 
 my own bread, and gratified my love of 
 learning!' â€” " That you may do here,'' 
 replied he roughly, " by being Mary's 
 schoolmaster; and at my table, with 
 forty pounds per annum, I presume yoa 
 will be a> well oiF as with a curacy." 
 My mother's blqssed spirit saved me from 
 uttering the reproaches which were on 
 my lips. I remembered her dying advice, 
 I bowed, and was retiring. ^' Hark ye, 
 Sir !" cried he, '' I see I have offended 
 your classical pride, but you ought to 
 remember, that I never wished to see you 
 brought up in idleness. It was your 
 mother's pleasure to see you the gentle- 
 man of the family. I always told her, I 
 W-ould not buy you a Iking', earn one, as 
 I have done before you. Go to your bro-

 do something for you that will not be

 multiplication table into the bargain.'^ 
 I bowed, and said, that my part required 
 no time for a resolution: I was not edu- 
 cated for commerce ; nor should I go to 
 Jamaica; but I should consider that time 
 well employed, which was devoted to 
 Mary's improvement: for the rest, I re- 
 lied on his goodness and favour*' " As 
 you please," answered he, somewhat sof- 
 tened: "at least, you will be useful, and 
 you will have no wants under my roof." 
 I bowed, and was permitted to retire. 
 Lucretia exulted in this my defeat; but I 
 Icept my temper. Mary with delight, now 
 listened to my plans of instruction. Young 
 as she was, she entered into my vex- 
 ations. "Be but contented here," said 
 she, " and I shall be happy. My father's

 love is not yet diverted from his play- 
 thing; leave me to manage, you shall be 
 comfortable." Every device which in- 
 nocence and affection could suggest, was 
 now practised in her playful hours with 
 her doating father. She could not study 
 in the common parlour, she should never 
 think herself at school. My father or- 
 dered Mr. Percival to choose his own 
 apartment; and a room was dignified with 
 the name of my study. It were endless 
 to enumerate the means this "spoiled 
 child," to use Miss Flint's epithet, em- 
 ployed to lesson the mortifying circum- 
 stances of my situation. Her winning 
 smiles, her sweet persuasions, her playful 
 vivacity, had in appearance but one sti- 
 mulus ; â€” my ease and comfort. She rode 
 on horseback, because this produced a 
 horse for Percival's use, who was to attend 
 her. She loved only what he preferred 
 at table, and even in her application to 
 my lessons, she was excited by the desire

 of serving me. My father soon dis- 
 coveied by Mary's proficiency in arith-

 was not ignorant in the multiphcatiou 
 table ; and I, satisfied with my dear pu- 
 pil's improvement, and gratified by her 
 affection, became more reconcded to my 
 situation. Mary's age, when in her 
 seventeenth year, produced lier a new 
 title. ''The spoiled child" was dismissed 
 for ''the idle girl, ' and lectures on the 
 loss of time were not spared. With 
 serious remembrance of my mother's too 
 prophetic words, I laboured incessantly 
 to implant in my lovely sister those prin- 
 ciples of conduct, which in female life,, 
 particularly, are of more worth than all 
 the learning of the schools. The re- 
 gulation of her heart, and the strength- 
 ening her judgment, neither deprived her 
 of her native simplicity, nor diverted 
 her attention from the occupations of 
 her sex. She continued to be my father's

 source of joy and comfort ; and with a 
 temper and an address, whieh it must 
 be confessed, peculiarly marks the fair 
 sex, and which, when employed as Hea- 
 ven intended, renders a woman irresist- 
 ible, she converted at her pleasure, the 
 ungracious refusal into kindness, gloom 
 into social content, and fretful com- 
 plainings into laughter and delight. One 
 triumph of this angel in form and mind, 
 I cannot omit. She had by her innocent 
 exertions to please her father, persuaded 
 him, that at seventeen years of age, it 
 was time for her to begin to economize 
 her own little purse. *' It is now three 
 months since I was as old as my sister, 
 when she had her regular allowance/' 
 ^dded she, ^'and it would be the means 
 of making me more careful and indus- 
 trious, like Lucretia, had I the manage- 
 ment of my clothes and expences. My

 twenty guineas. She gratefully received 
 them, and with bewitching grace and 
 gaiety, wrote him in much form, an ac- 
 quittance. He laughed, but was not dis- 
 pleased vv'ilh her accuracy. '* If,"- said 
 he, *'you can keep your accounts as well

 fear," cried she, '* you shall see how ex^

 then keep day-book and ledger of what 
 remains." My father, surprised, asked 
 what debts she could probly have incurred 
 '*They are those," replied she, "not only 
 of gratiude, but of justice: my brother 
 Percival has purchased books for my use, 
 which he needed not for his own, and I

 gave her a note for five and twenty

 *' you may as well say nothing of this ta

 transports when she related this incident 
 to me. "Take it," said she, pushing the 
 whole sum toward me," take it as the 
 first fruits of that affection, which my

 were but left to his own goodness of 
 heart! how happy should we be, and how 
 happy would he be himself! But have 
 courage, my dear Percival, we shall suc- 
 ceed, for we will merit his love; and he 
 will be just." I received my present with 
 more contentment of heart than I can 
 express; and Mary begged I would be 
 her purse-bearer for the greater part of 
 her treasure, adding, that she had no 
 other means of securing it from her sis- 
 ter's enquiry, who took upon her to eX'

 XT was soon after this little event that 
 my enjoyments were augmented by the 
 arrival of Mr. Howard, who served the

 spectable tutor. Howard was my senior.

 and unquestionably my superior in learn- 
 ing : I had experienced the advantages 
 resulting from this circumstance ; for his 
 attainments were a fund on which I drew 
 for my own benefit. The external graces 
 of this young man corresponded with the 
 endowments of his mind ; and the ele- 
 gant scholar and unaffected gentleman 
 was distinguished at the university, as 
 the handsom.est man there. 
 
 Comliness in form and feature, was the 
 hereditary donation which Howard had 
 received from his family, with its high 
 pretensions to ancient splendour and 
 honours. Fortune had so sunk its pros- 
 perity, that his father had earned his 
 bread by his sword; and on his death, 
 in the field of battle, left to his young 
 widow, with a small life annuity, and a 
 pension from government, this only child, 
 then an infant at the breast. The spirit 
 of Howard animated the partner of his 
 adverse fortune; slie devoted herself to

 the care of her son; but with anxious 
 sohcitude implanted in him her own sen- 
 timents in regard to a mihtary Hfe ; and 
 by a rigid oeconomy, and the sacrifice of 
 her own comforts, she was enabled to 
 place him in a profession, which united 
 the ideas of honour and safety for him, 
 with peace of mind to herself To invite 
 a guest to my father's table, was not 
 amongst the privileges which I enjoyed 
 at Tarefield. Satisfied by finding myself 
 received at Mr. Wilson's with hospitality, 
 and the frankness so inherent in the mind 
 of this worthy man, I neither regretted 
 the apparently uncivil omission which 
 rendered my friend a stranger to my 
 home, nor wished to see him received 
 there. Mary, approaching to her eigh- 
 teenth year, was a dangerous object for 
 Howard's sensibility; and he was formed 
 to please her. These precautions of pru- 
 dence and consideration settled my mode 
 of eonduct during the first week or two

 of Howard's residence; but nothing was 
 talked of at the hall but *' the handso^ne 
 curate''' *' the fine 'prtachtr^'' who was 
 come to Tarefield." My father, never a 
 punctual church-goer, and who had been 
 long disgusted by the old curate's York- 
 shire dialect, and his ignorance, to which 
 was unluckily added, his not playing 
 either at cribbage or back-gammon, had, 
 when disposed to say his prayers in a 
 church, preferred that in the next parish, 
 now in the hands, as it was then, of Mr. 
 Greenwood; who was also a friend of 
 Mr. Howard's, and who had been the 
 principal inducement for his acceptance 
 of the curacy of Tarefield. I was called 
 upon for my report of my friend's merits, 
 and truth dictated my answer. ''It is 
 very strange you never mentioned his ar- 
 rival," observed Miss Flint; *' your 
 friend must entertain a poor opinion of 
 the hospitality of Tarefield-hall from the 
 neglect he has received from us. It is

 rather odd, that he should not have call 
 ed on your father; such an attention 
 would have been proper; but I suppose 
 he was prevented." This remark was not 
 intended to fall to the ground ; and con- 
 trary to my usual custom, I took care it 
 should not. ** It has never been a ques- 
 tion," replied I, '^ between Howard and 
 myself, under which of our roofs we 
 should enjoy each others society. I nei- 
 ther invited, nor repulsed his appearance 
 here; for he never mentioned the subject: 
 if he had, I should have told him, that 
 his introduction did not depend upon 
 me. My father sees no company ; and I 
 should not have presumed to ask to his 
 table, a guest, who had no better title to 
 his notice than being my friend,''' â€” 
 "I am not unwilling, Percival," said my 
 father, *'to receive him with that title^ 
 whatever you may think, provided I 
 can understand him better than the last 
 dunderhead that was here. Does How-

 ard playback-gammon?" I could only 
 answer for the purity of his English, and 
 his cheerful temper. The conference 
 concluded by my being desired to engage 
 Mr. Howard and Mr. Greenwood to dine 
 at the hall on the following Sunday. 
 Nearly a week's penance was softened to 
 IVliss Flint by the preparations needful for 
 the expected guests. To the important 
 concerns of the table were superadded 
 those which regarded her personal de- 
 corations; for, as she observed, she had 
 lived such a recluse, that she was hardly 
 fit to be seen by a gentleman. 
 
 From the day of this visit, Tarefield 
 experienced unknown delights. My 
 father found the curate an excellent hand 
 at back-gammon, " when he minded 
 what he was doing." The honey of 
 Hybla was on Miss Lucretia's lips; and 
 her smiles were the signal for every one's 
 merriment. My father became good 
 humoured, and of course less the invalid.

 He now thought himself equal to a jour- 
 ney to London, which he had long 
 meditated, and which he considered as 
 indispensibly necessary to his affairs. 
 My sister earne^stly seconded his inten- 
 tion, demonstrating that he would be 
 the better for a change of scene, and the 
 exercise it would give him. ** Take your 
 pet with you," added she with a gracious 
 nod, " shew her London for a month, 
 and you will return home a young man, 
 and leave behind you those habits of re- 
 tirement, which have contributed more 
 to make you an old one than either your 
 years or your infirmities.'* My father 
 observed that he should have too much 
 business on his hands to permit him to 
 shew Mary "the lions,'' but that the en- 
 suing winter, it was probable, he should 
 pass some weeks in London, and carry 
 \vith him his whole family. Miss Lucre- 
 tia s logic had been too conclusive to be 
 recanted ; and she saw my father depart

 for London without his pet. Hope how- 
 ever, remained at Tarefield, and so whis- 
 pered success, that this defeat was 
 apparently forgotten in new expedients. 
 These were of that sort which it was 
 impossible for poor Howard to overlook 
 or mistake. He confessed his embarrass- 
 ment to me ; and with that integrity of 
 mind which marked his course through 
 life, he declared his love for my angelic 
 Mary. I did not forget my duty, Miss 
 Cowley, although I well knew there was 
 not a man on earth better qualified to be 
 her protector and to render her happy, 
 I failed not to place before my friend the 
 insuperable obstacles which would oppose 
 his wishes, from his want of fortune, and 
 from the influence of the disappointed, 
 and already too envious sister. I pointed 
 out to him the necessity of his being less 
 frequently at the hall, and pleaded 
 Mary's peace as endangered by his per- 
 sisting in a passion so calculated to reach

 iier innocent bosom. Mr. Greenwood 
 engaged to do his parochial duty for him 
 for a month ; in which time my father 
 would be at home, and a more guarded 
 iiitercourse could be established. Mary 
 affected no concealments with me on the 
 subject of her dejection when Howard 
 left us. Love had made her quick- 
 sighted ; and attributing my friend's 
 absence to its true cause, she lamented 
 Miss Lucretia's folly as the only impedi* 
 ment to her happiness, *' being certain 
 that no father could reject such a man 
 as Mr. Howard." 
 
 I will not prolong my narrative with 
 the arguments which you will naturally 
 suppose I urged against this fond and 
 fallacious belief. Her tears subdued 
 much more than her promises satisfied 
 me, although she repeatedly engaged 
 '^ to act with a prudence which I should 
 approve ; to wait patiently for years ; 
 never to cause the least vexation to her

 dear father, and even to avoid offending 
 her sister by an acknowledgment of How- 
 ard's preference." All was easy ! time 
 would do every thing for Mary, except 
 to render her indifferent to Mr. Howard ! 
 I promised to be neuter, and I kept my 
 word. The lovers, as it will appear, 
 found an expedient to keep up a cor- 
 respondence, without implicating my 
 honour, or alarming my vigilance. My 
 father's unaccountable detention in Lon- 
 don was forgotten by the curate's return, 
 and unable to resist the attraction which 
 drew him to the hall, poor Howard ac- 
 celerated those measures which it had 
 cost him so many hours of privation to 
 retard. He was present when my fa- 
 ther's letter to Miss Fhnt announced his 
 marriage, with orders to prepare the 
 house for the reception of its new mis- 
 tress. Our astonishment at this intelli-' 
 gence was succeeded by our cares for 
 Lucretia, who from fury, sunk into

 violent fits. When restored to more com- 
 posure, she hung faintly on Howard's 
 arm, and said, "Be not discouraged, my 
 dear lioward ! I will convince my father 
 that I have as good a right as himself to 
 be happy. Let the minx whom he has 
 married, be his slave. My duty shall be 
 devoted to a husband, who will not dis- 
 grace his family. â€” He shall, Howard, 
 consent to the justice of my demand. I 
 will force him to be generous ; you shall 
 have no reason to complain of fortune !" 
 Poor Howard, sinking with confusion and 
 unable to speak, was relieved by my 
 calling him to assist me. Mary, who in 
 stupid silence had witnessed this scene, 
 fainted ; and he w^as permitted to retire, 
 after having assisted me in conveying 
 her to her room.

 children. The more attractive charms 
 of her youth may still be traced in the 
 modest and pensive expression of hev 
 countenance. She was extremely agi- 
 tated on her first appearance, and seemed 
 intimidated to a painful degree. Her 
 brother, Mr. Flamall, accompanied her 
 to the Hall; and by an affected gaiety, 
 endeavoured to encourage his sister, and 
 to recommend himself. Her mannerg 
 succeeded much better to reconcile us to 
 the stepmother. A quiet melancholy, 
 a mild and endearing attention to every 
 one around her, indicated the sweetness 
 of her temper, and the authority by 
 which she had been compelled to marry 
 a man of seventy. For some days Miss 
 Flint refused to quit her room. My 
 father's resentment was appeased by his 
 gentle help-mate; and she entreated him 
 to assure his daughter, that she neither 
 meant to interfere m her management of 
 his family, nor to lessen her influenceo

 *' Tell Miss Flint," added she, '' that my 
 office in this house will be confined to 
 my duty, as it regards your ease and 
 comfort ; and that in order to be happy 
 myself, it is incumbent upon me to ren- 
 der your children so. I come not as a 
 rival, but as a friend, to this abode." 
 She looked at us with emotion, and a 
 tear escaped. Some concessions pro- 
 duced the submission which my father 
 wished for; a general amnesty took place, 
 and Mr. Flamall so entirely diverted Miss 
 Flint's ^sentments, that, to my astonish- 
 ment, she was obsequiously polite to Mrs. 
 Flint. How^ard paid his visit of cere- 
 mony; my father received him with his 
 usual cordiality; but his general absence 
 was unnoticed. Flamall played at back- 
 gammon with my father, and his young 
 wife engaged his attention. A hasty call 
 from time to time prevented curiosity or 
 enquiry; and I secretly rejoiced that How- 
 ard was less in Mary's sight. She was

 every day more pleased with my fathers 
 choice; and considering her as the victim 
 of a brother's interested view^s, she loved 
 her as being unfortunate, and approached 
 her by a sympathy apparently well un- 
 derstood. 
 
 Amiable and uniformly correct as Mrs. 
 Flint's conduct was, you will not he 
 surprised, that I endeavoured, not only 
 as a son, but as a gentleman^ to shew 
 her that respect and those attentions to 
 which she was entitled. She loved read- 
 ing, and my library was hers. Some- 
 times she would steal an hour from her 
 tiresome duties, and with her needle- 
 work join Mary; and I read to them. 
 She loved flowers and plants; and I be- 
 came diligent in the culture of them. 
 My father was pleased with this acqui- 
 escence on my part, and one morning 
 he asked whether I was not satisfied that 
 he had augmented his comforts. I re- 
 plied with sincerity, saying that I had

 no doubt of it ; and that I was also con- 
 vinced, that in his wife Mary would 
 find a guide and a friend. ** So I think," 
 returned he smiHng, "I saw from the 
 first hour that they would suit each 
 other." A few weeks passed in peace 
 and comfort, when suddenly my father 
 relapsed into ill-humour, and was still 
 more harsh and abrupt with me than 
 ever. Stung by some rudeness of this 
 sort, I asked him what had offended him. 
 ** Your conduct," said he roughly. " I 
 do not want you to make love to my 
 wife."â€”" I am sorry," answered I, *Hhat 
 you so little understand me, Sir ; you 
 make me wretched by your suspicions, 
 and injure a woman whom I believe to be 
 truly virtuous." â€” '* I believe her so," 
 returned he, ** but I want no rival under 
 my roof." He left me. I was confound- 
 ed and astonished beyond conception,

 by recalling my most indifferent actions, 
 to find a clew by which to unravel this 
 unaccountable jealousy which my father 
 had shewn. Conscious that I had never 
 in the most remote manner, either expe- 
 rienced or discovered a sentiment beyond 
 that good-will and respect which my 
 mictions had -evinced, I mentioned, in the 
 course of my conversation with Howard, 
 an incident of a recent date, which at 
 the moment struck me, and which then 
 appeared to explain, in some sort, my 
 father's ill-humour, though not his sus- 
 picions. 
 
 Mrs. Flint, at the breakfast- table, a 
 few days before, had, with cheerfulness, 
 reminded my father of a promise he had 
 made her in town. *^ He told me," said 
 she, smiling on my sisters, ** that you 
 would like current coin better than 
 fashionable tinsel; and thus prevented 
 me from adding to the incumbrances of 
 band-boxes ; but he must keep his word,

 somely; otherwise, if you will help me, 
 we will pick his pocket now, for I know 
 we shah meet with a good booty." The 
 poor fond old man kissed her, and said 
 she could do what she pleased with him 
 without assistance. She blushed with 
 genuine modesty, took the offered purse, 
 and gratefully gave us each a twenty 
 pound note. I thought at the moment 
 that my father's brow clouded; and I be- 
 lieve vshe thought so likewise, for, with a 
 sweet smile, she thanked him for his 
 goodness to her. I received, however, 
 my gift with a bow of acknowledgment^ 
 not unmixed with the painful idea of my 
 dependance. Howard listened to this 
 little account; but he informed me that 
 Mary had mentioned to him a conversa- 
 tion she had accidentally heard before 
 the wedding gift was mentioned; and 
 that from what had passed between Miss 
 Flint and her maid, she was certain her

 father suspected the motives of my civi- 
 lities to the young mother-in law. Let 
 it suffice, Madam, I determined to leave 
 Tarefield; nor did my friend Howard 
 endeavour to oppose my resolution. He 
 saw that it was impossible I could live at 
 the hall, and that jj my health and ta- 
 lents were sinking under the continual 
 checks imposed on my activity and 
 spirits. 
 
 He solemnly engaged to watch over 
 the only object of my tender regrets, 
 and to maintain his pretentions to her at 
 the point of his life; to guard her as 
 a sacred deposit left in his hands, and 
 never to urge her to commit an act that 
 I could not approve. I knew Howard, 
 Miss Cowley, and I was satisfied. The 
 remainder of the day was given to my 
 secret preparations, and the following 
 morning I was on the road to London ;

 ceeded in getting me a lieutenancy of

 reproached me with having gained an 
 interest in his wife's heart. She had sor- 
 rowed for me, and had even soh cited for 
 my return. He neither wished for my 
 success, nor sent me a guinea. I em- 
 barked with my regiment for Canada;

 Nothing, however, could detain me in 
 town ; and with all my worldly wealth, 
 namely, thirty guineas in my purse, I 
 took my place in a northern stage-coach;

 spot, endeavoured to hire a horse. Some 
 difficulty arising, to which my impatience 
 could not submit, I deteruiined to leave 
 my portmanteau at the inn, and to walk. 
 I set forward, but was soon overtaken by 
 a heavy rain, A stage- waggon was in 
 sight, and knowing that I had no clothes 
 with me, I accepted the shelter. A neat- 
 ly-dressed country woman was the only 
 passenger. The rain poured down in 
 torrents, and she began her chat by ob- 
 serving that I had been lucky. I sighed. 
 '* Mayhap, Sir,'' continued she curiously 
 examining my uniform, "you are not used 
 to ride in waggon; but is it not better 
 than being wet to the skin.?" I said I

 Master Flint for his own advantage. 
 They are a precious set ! I would sooner

 of my once lovely and blooming sister. 
 I dare not recall the anguish of our first 
 embrace ! Let it suffice ; it appeared that 
 Heaven in its mercy conducted me to 
 them for their consolation. Howard's 
 spirits were renewed, the cherub Mary 
 smiled inher cradle, and we forgot thepast 
 in our present comforts. Tarefield-hall 
 was shunned ; for I feared my impetuo- 
 sity, and dreaded to disturb the tran- 
 quillity of my dear invalids. Heartley 
 gained me three months leave of absence 
 beyond the term allotted me, and I was 
 happy; â€” yes, Miss Cowley, happy ! for I 
 perceived that I was the cordial of health 
 to tliose whom I loved more than myself. 
 Howard's cough disappeared; and he 
 began to talk of freeing Mr. Greenwood 
 from his fatigue of going through the 
 parochial duties. This led him to expa- 
 tiate on that gentleman's generous and

 '' You have seen detailed in my Mary's

 exulted at his success, as it promised, 
 that by directing Miss Flint's unfortu- 
 nate fancy from me to himself, we should 
 be released from a serious obstacle to 
 our wishes. On the death of my dear 
 mother, and after a month's absence, I 
 pleaded business and want of spirits for 
 neglecting to visit my kind friends at

 strong-hold, I consulted Greenwood; 
 and made a full confession of my attach- 
 ment to my sweet Mary, not omitting 
 your fatherly counsels and her trust in 
 my devoted heart. He could only repeat 
 your sage exhortations, and pity me. 
 Mrs. Wilson was a more useful confidant, 
 for I had notice of the enemy's approach ; 
 and my escapes were so well managed, 
 that, foiled in the purpose of her frequent 
 visits, Miss Lucretia forgot her dear 
 
 Mrs. Wilson, and at once made known 
 her intentions to her father. Mr. Tlint's 
 
 letter contained a very civil approbation 
 of my conduct, " in as much as I had 
 practised a prudence w^hich did honour 
 to my principles, it certainly being an 
 improbable event, that he should favour 
 an union so unequal in regard to for- 
 tune ; but finding his daughter's happi-

 plying to him from an honest scruple, 
 he informed me that I was secure of his 
 consent, that he should allow Lucretia 
 four hundred pounds per annum, and 
 on the death of the rector induct me to 
 the living of Tarefield. For his further 
 consideration he made no doubt, I would

 of my aifections, in Miss Flint's pre- 
 sence'; and that my hehaviour had never 
 for an instant contradicted my words ; 
 nor could any motives of interest dis- 
 pose me to relinquish a woman whom I 
 loved. You will conclude that my fa- 
 vour at the hall ceased ; and in my dis- 
 grace, even my pulpit eloquence was 
 forgotten ; for the family, when they 
 were disposed to enter a place of public 
 worship, went to Greenwood's parish. 
 Secure as we mutually were on the side of 
 faith and love, my dear Mary and myself 
 contrived with the help of the faithful 
 old oak and those hopes to which we 
 fondly cleaved, to support those little 
 trials of our patience. I had Avarned her 
 never to keep my letters, and to be pre- 
 pared for the inspection of a jealous wo-

 occasions she was alarmed by hearing 
 some one at the Mandow calling her gent- 
 ly by name; despair rendered her fear- 
 less, and, on approaching it, she found it- 
 was a young man who iiued in the house 
 as groom. *I come to serve you Miss/

 strength to descend from the room two 
 stories high by means of a ladder. Frank

 gave himself no trouble to remove tlie 
 means of her escape. She recollected her 
 concealed treasure, and he disinterred it. 
 Greenwood was at the avenue gate with 
 a decent looking man and a chaise. He 
 told her she was safe, and that her guide 
 would protect her. She instantly got into 
 the carriage, which was an open, old- 
 fashioned vehicle, with two stout horses, 
 and driven by her conductor. They soon 
 lost sight of the village. Frank retired 
 to his pillow in the stable-chamber : and 
 Greenwood returned home. I have

 mance," continued Howard, smiHng,

 said, * Go to Mr. Greenwood's,' and he 
 instantly joined some people at the

 perceived there was more in his manner, 
 than could be understood by a common 
 observer; with a palpitating heart I took

 the road to my friend's house. I had not 
 proceeded far, when Frank, breathless 
 with speed, overtook me. ' She is safe, 
 Sir!' said he, * blessed be God, she is 
 safe. Mr. Greenwood will tell you all 
 all about it. They cannot murder her 
 now.' He darted from me. * I miUst

 and to inform me of the obligations she 
 was under to Mary's mother. These 
 were fully stated, and Frank proceeded 
 to his own confession. He preferred 
 being a sailor to working with his bro- 
 tber-ih-law, a \vealthy farmer, who lived 
 five miles from Newcastle; he left his good 
 friends secretly, and by chance stopped 
 at the Ram for refreshment. There he 
 met a groom just discharged from the 
 hall, and who disgusted by Miss Flint, 
 entertained Frank with the history of 
 the family, and gave vent to his own 
 resentments. Miss Mary was the heroine 
 of this history. She was an * angel^^ 
 but with the rest, made miserable by the 
 ^ she-devir who ruled in the house; and 
 he had left the ball in a fine 'kick tfp ;' 
 for they had found" out that Miss Mary 
 had been writing a love-letter to the cu- 
 rate her sister's sweetheart. Curiosity 
 appears to have been the first stimulus

 to Frank's project ; he won on the land- 
 lord to recommend him to the vacated 
 post, and Tarefield being in no great re- 
 pute for kitchen comforts, he was en- 
 gaged on trial, and entered into the 
 family as groom, under the name of 
 Frank Armstrong. In a few days Frank 
 was in the family secrets, the kitchen 
 account wasin the captive's favour. Anne, 
 the chamber-maid, to use Frank's words, 
 made his blood boil in his veins. lie 
 wrote to his mother, promising he would 
 never go to sea, if she would come and 
 take away Miss Mary. The good wo- 
 man's letter to me, was an undeniable 
 proof of her principles and prudence. I 
 observed, that the only difficulty was 
 to remove Mary from the house. * Leave 
 that to me, Sir,' said he, exultingly,

 than she should ! only, as Miss does not

 next evening he called upon me. * All

 he. ' My brother will be here. I have 
 contrived it.'â€” I stared with surprise. 
 * Why you know, Sir,' said he, '1 could 
 not do without a ladder, seeing Miss 
 Mary is locked into a chamber two sto-

 barring, were she even below stairs that 
 would be impossible, without making

 provided ladders in plenty, and what is 
 better, as high as the house. He laughed 
 immoderately. It was a good thought, 
 cried he, though I say it; for I have 
 made them a job which will put money 
 into their pockets for the use of the lad-

 that Frank could reason on causes and 
 effects. A six weeks drought, said he,

 other I could have gone with her. I

 he. First your honour must know, that 
 Sunday is a Sabbath of rest with our 
 folks at the hall ; I had them safe in their 
 beds till eight or nine o'clock, and there 
 was time gained. Secondly, Mr. Webstep, 
 my brother, could not so well come on 
 any other day, because of his horses: and 
 in the last place, said he, rubbing his 
 hands with vivacity, I shall never as long-

 then gave me with amotion the account 
 of her treatment which he had learned 
 from Anne the chamber-' maid, who was 
 as he said Miss Mary's *' true friend.'' 
 
 " Yesterday evening Mr. Webster 
 made his appearance, we concerted our 
 measures, and all has succeeded. The 
 rescued prisoner is now on the road to a

 with dignity, ** perfectly satisfied with 
 my own motives for an interference in 
 this business. It is the duty of every 
 man to assist the oppressed. Mr. Flint 
 by his imbecility and injustice has for- 
 feited the rights of a parent; he has given 
 up his authority into the hands of an en- 
 raged and disappointed woman, whom he 
 well knew to be ungovernable in her pas^ 
 sions, and under whose power he himself 
 groans. I have acted for this father, Mr.

 Howard ; he may one day thank nie, as 
 the dehverer of his child. It requires 
 but a superficial knowledge of human 
 nature, and little experience in Hfe, to 
 know the fatal effects of counteracted 
 and opposed passion, in a youthful mind, 
 when cruelty is the means employed to 
 accomplish the purpose. I am not dis- 
 posed to believe that many girls die of 
 love ; but I have seen many examples of 
 an evil more to be dreaded than death, 
 by an improper and harsh opposition to 
 this passion, as well as others ; and when 
 I saw your Mary I was convinced that I 
 was acting in favour of humanity and 
 justice. I have, however," continued he, 
 *' engaged her promise of obedience to 
 my directions ; and I now claim your 
 word of honour, to be governed by me.

 A month passed. Greenwood found 
 Mr. Flint inaccessible. He desired to 
 see Miss Flint ; ai.d at length gained his 
 point. . Wiih well affected concern she 
 mentioned her father's illness as the rea- 
 son of his refusing his friendly visits, 
 adding, that no consolation could at that 
 moment reach a mind sunk to despair, 
 by the conduct of an ungrateful and too 
 tenderly beloved child. She entered into 
 the detail of my infamous duplicity, and 
 Mary's as infamous advances to my pre- 
 ference. I wave however, continued che, 
 my own injuries, bitterly as I still feel 
 them ; but the letters now in my father's 
 hands I can never forget. The cruel 
 mockery, the insolence of them, as they 
 relate to him, is unpardonable ! Would

 has convinced him, that she was in Per- 
 civaFs secrets; and that she favoured him 
 in his profligate inchnation for Mrs. 
 Flint, telling him, that in time she might 
 listen to him more kindly. Could you 
 give credit to this report Mr. Greenwood 
 asked she, on a less certain evidence than 
 mine? Even yours, replied Mr. Green- 
 wood, is insufficient ; for I will maintain 
 every syllable you have uttered to bcfalse^

 fronted them with the declaration of the 
 supposed writers. When I see Mr. Flint less

 fidence than you have at present. If

 informed, Miss Flint, and I caution you, 
 as the minister of a master avIio ** hateth 
 the oppressor, and ahhorreth the workers 
 in iniquity," to consider what you have 
 done to offend him ; and what you still 
 meditate to do, in order to min that in- 
 nocent which is God's peculiar care. 
 
 He instantly quitted the rx)om, leaving' 
 her confounded or choaked with rage. 
 Mr. Greenwood soon after gave me my 
 leave of absence. I flew to my every 
 earthly good. Mrs. Croft had conducted 
 her to Berwick, and on my joining her, 
 we were united in the presence of as 
 many witnesses as curiosity and the ad- 
 miration of Mary's beauty collected. We 
 passed a. week with Mr. Webster, and 
 finally settled here, with a welcome of a 
 long hoped for blessing. Frank was 
 early in his visit of congratulation, and

 thusiasm, which has for its object, a

 dately gave us the particulars of the 
 discovery of Mary's escape, which, you 
 will easily imagine, produced the utmost 
 confusion: I was naturally the first per- 
 son suspected as having aided her; but 
 I had, fortunately, passed the Saturday at 
 Bishop's- Auckland, and had slept there. 
 This alibi proved, and my remaining 
 quiet at Wilson's perplexed them, and 
 lost in conjectures, they gave up the 
 fruitless question. Frank was requested 
 to convey our letters to Mr. Flint. My 
 master keeps his room, said he, sorrowful- 
 ly ; and Madam Flint no more dares to act 
 in the matter, than to swallow fire, or 
 poison, poor soul ! But do not cry, my 
 dear lady, all will turn out well in time. 
 Let me consider, I will contrive ! Anne 
 goes into the room, and there is nothing 
 she can refuse me, she is as honest as the 
 the day is light, and loves you, Madam.

 Never fear, you have got Mr. Howard at

 never ends, let them take that who like it,

 exclaimed poor Howard, lifting up his 
 expressive eyes to Heaven, " what is man

 mitted to his faithful hands. Two or three 
 days after, he came to make his farewell 
 visit, and to request Mary to write to his 
 mother, that she was satisfied with his 
 conduct. Our letters to the hall were

 with me, nor I with you, Mr. Fiamall. I 
 spoke as I felt, Sir, added he, nodding to 
 me. He warned me if I valued a whole 
 skin, not to be insolent; but I told him 
 that neither my skin nor my honrsty 
 would be in danger from him. He said,

 said I, keeping my ground, of a scound- 
 rel who was not low, though he tacked 
 ^guire or counsellor to his name. He ad- 
 vanced to strike me, but he thought 
 better of it, I believe, for he turned on his 
 heel. I wish to the Lord lie had, he 
 would have met with his match at a hai'd 
 blow, though he will never find one in his 
 roguery. Anne says there are fine doings 
 scoino* on between him and Miss Flint.

 swing, till their own noose catches theiti !

 Mrs. Flint, ''the inclosed trifle; this is all

 On reaching London after a delay thus 
 imposed, I found Heartley an his dying 
 bed; this trial did not accelerate my 
 recovery. A fever succeeded to his last 
 embrace. Alas, his virtues suited not the 
 world he had escaped ! Its cold and un- 
 genial maxims could not find admis- 
 sion into a heart glowing with every 
 noble affection. Trusting to vigorous 
 health, and scorning the prudence which 
 gives but to receive, he lived honourably 
 and died poor, leaving his widow with a 
 jointure of barely two hundred pounds 
 per annum, for the support of herself 
 and two children. This inestimable 
 woman found in her difficulties and 
 principles resources for ennobling her 
 character. Her sorrows were reserved for 
 her pillow; and with a calm and col- 
 lected mind, she disposed of her effects, 
 paid every outstanding debt; and then 
 declared to her friends, her intention of 
 quitting London, in order to give m

 retirement those habits to her children, 
 which alone could render them content-

 me she saw the guardian whom her hus-

 Heaven had spared me. Our tranquillity 
 met with no disturbance from the hall. I 
 had been settled more than a month, when 
 one morning, in passing the hall gate, I 
 saw Miss Flint and Mr. Flamall standing 
 in the road opposite to it, as though 
 waiting for some one from the house. I 
 passed them as an absolute stranger. Mr. 
 Flamall called me by name, and added, 
 *'Miss Flint, Sir, wishes to speak to you." 
 She advanced, and I stopped. *^ I should 
 have sent my attorney to you, Sir," said 
 she haughtily, ^^ if I had not thought 
 that you would in less than a month have 
 found leisure to call at the hall." â€” "When 
 I have any business at the hall, or interest 
 in those who reside there, I shall find 
 leisure to call," replied I, with ill -sup- 
 pressed emotion. "I neither expected, 
 nor desired your visit," answered she, '^on 
 my own account ; but I beg to know 
 your pleasure in regard to the books you 
 left behind you, when you deserted it." â€”

 " Consult yoMV lawyer,'" replied I; *^ if it 
 be allowed that I have a right to more 
 than a shilHng, send them ; I will pay the 
 carriage, as I did the bookseller of whom 
 they were purchased." I walked on, and 
 soon saw that she was joined by Mr. 
 Snughead, to whom she had recently 
 given the living of Tarefield. This cir- 
 cumstance did not contribute ta restore 
 my equanimity. Poor Howard pressed 
 on my memory and I returned home 
 dejected. 
 
 My books made their appearance oh 
 the following day ; and contributed to 
 my success as a tutor. Malcolm, Mac- 
 lairn, and Henry Heartley were my pupils; 
 and neither of them have disgraced me. 
 I pass-over all the fluctuations of a malady 
 so fallacious as my sister^s. Her approach 
 to the grave was so gradual, that at times 
 she laughed at our precautions, and be- 
 guiled us of our fears ; but when on the

 spoke of her dissolution with serenity. 
 
 One day she told me that she had been 
 writing to Lucretia, and wished me to 
 read the letter before she sealed it. I 
 >vaved my hand, and turned away my 
 weeping eyes. " Well, I will not urge 
 it," said she putting in a wafer; "but 
 I cannot die in peace, without assuring 
 ier, that I sincerely forgive her. I am 
 hastening to an abode, into which no 
 animosities can enter. I have none to 
 impede my entrance; and the time may 
 come, when poor Lucretia will find a 
 consolation in this assurance. I have 
 even recommended my poor child to her 
 regard, as a proof that I have pardoned 
 her unkindness to me. The only senti- 
 ment I now can feel for an offending fellow- 
 creature," added she, wiping away a 
 starting tear, " is compassion; and I leave 
 you to judge, Percival> of that which

 But were I wholly to omit her in a letter

 my child. Her aunt is rich in this world's 
 wealth, she is poor. Lucretia may Hve

 bed of death. These violent agitations 
 subsided to a more collected and deter- 
 mined purpose of thought. I was inca- 
 pable of receiving Greenwood's argu- 
 ments, and I was soothed by being left 
 to my design. Greenwood performed 
 the last sad office. Preparations were 
 made for receiving the remains of Mrs.

 his church, where her husband was bu- 
 ried; but the hearse and coach stopped 
 short of the halL Following the coffin 
 I proceeded on foot to the great gate of

 stop, I rang the bell with fury. A man- 
 servant answered my hasty summons; 
 and, appalled by the object in view, he 
 stood motionless before me. '^ Tell Miss

 that I am the bearer of a commission 
 from the deady and that I will be num- 
 bered with the dead before I leave this 
 spot if she refuses to admit me." Some

 little time elapsed : I was admitted ; and 
 the trembling heiress, surrounded by her 
 maid-servants, and protected by Mr. 
 Flaniall, with terror met my slow ap- 
 proach. Flamall broke the silence. He 
 asked me what I had to say to Miss 
 Flint. I waved my hand. ** Be wise!" 
 said I, *^ this is no time for you." â€” He 
 took the advice and shrunk from my 
 eye. I presented the packet to Lucretia ; 
 slie attempted to retreat on seeing the 
 address. " You must take it," said I 
 calmly : " nay, more, Lucretia, you must 
 read the contents in my presence : such 
 are my orders ; and before my Maker, 
 have I sworn to fulfil them." â€” *'Give it 
 to some one," cried she, covering her 
 iuce; "I promise to read it when 1 am 
 able." â€” ** That will not suffice," replied 
 I, sitting down and bursting into ago- 
 nizing tears ; ** I have no apprehensions : 
 a sister's dying blessing cannot injure, 
 a sister s forgiveness cannot wound you."

 hastily glancing her eyes over the two 
 letters it contained, asked me, with 
 rising anger, ** whether I was satisfied 
 with having insulted her under ^her

 answered I, sternly ; '' my business was 
 not to compliment. I leave you with a 
 remedy you need. Profit from it, lest a 
 worse thing befal you than my insults.'^ 
 I instantly left her; and on my sainted 
 Mary's grave wept my feelings down to 
 composure, Time, and my remaining 
 comforts, healed, to a certain degree, 
 these breaches in my peace. I was at 
 length summoned to town with young 
 Heartley, by his friend, to prepare for 
 his voyage to Calcutta. A month was 
 employed in my cares for Heartley's son, 
 and my gratitude had its turn. I saw 
 him embark with all the sanguine hopes 
 of youth, qualified by my care, for an 
 honourable destination ; and gifted by

 nature with every virtuous and noble trait 
 of his father's character. He was under 
 the protection of a man who loved that 
 father, and I contentedly went back to my 
 lodgings in order to prepare for my re- 
 turn home. My demands on my banker 
 had been extended beyond their usual 
 course; and I had to settle my account 
 with his books before my departure. I 
 called at his house, it had stopped pay- 
 ment; and in a week or ten days deten- 
 tion in town I learned, that I might ex- 
 pect for the remaining sum of five hun- 
 dred pounds in his hands, a dividend of 
 *^ five shillings in the pound." 
 
 Mrs. Heartley was informed of this 
 event by her London correspondents. 
 My philosophy did not console her ; but it 
 was shared by the Wilsons, who observed

 not to fret about it, for that his comforts 
 were in no danger of a bankruptcy." â€”

 Maclairn. ^* She wished to see me, hav- 
 ing something to propose which she 
 trusted would heal the differences be- 
 tween us/' Mrs. Heartley's and Green- 
 wood's arguments prevailed. I went, 
 and, after some prelude, she told me, 
 that she had been informed of the 
 banker's insolvency, and was willing to 
 relieve me from the burden of supporting 
 Mary. I coldly replied that I had never 
 found her such. " Be it so," answered she, 
 *1 mean not in thils interview to offend 
 you. I will take another mode of ex- 
 pression. Consider whether a girl may 
 not be as safe under an aunt's protection 
 as under an uncle's, and that you may 
 die and leave her destitute. I have lost 
 sight of my brother Philip ; I think she

 proposal send her, I will instruct her to

 cried I, "you may at this hour render her 
 so ! Let this precious girl be the cement 
 of our renewed ties of nature !" â€” ^' I must 
 first be assured that she has not been 
 taught to hate wze," answered she, colour- 
 ing: " neither my intentions nor your 
 wishes can be effected, if this be the case. 
 Let her come ; I wish to know her, and 
 she must remain a stranger to me whilst 
 she is at Wilson's ; but we will at present 
 drop the subject : in a week I shall ex- 
 pect an answer." 
 
 She then detailed to me the miserable 
 state of Sir Murdock Maclairn, pitying 
 his wife, who lived nearly altogether in 
 his apartment. I will pass over the 
 struggles which ensued. Mary eagerly 
 solicited my consent. I saw her motive, 
 and clasped her to my bosom. MiSo

 P. S. I had intended to suppress one

 mind unchecked by reason or religion. 
 You will be tempted to think it insanity. 
 It might be as well could I think thus. 
 
 On Mr. Howard's bringing his wife to 
 Wilson's, Miss Flint, in transports of 
 fury, flew to the apartment in which hung 
 my mother's picture, and with a hand 
 animated by an iln placable ferocity, she 
 cut and defaced the cherub face, which 
 was its beauty. My sister Howard, who 
 yf2LS ignorant of this impotent act of 
 revenge, often wished for this picture; 
 and I employed Malcolm's good offices 
 with his brother Philip to gain it. By 
 this means I learned the incident, and 
 consequently diverted my sister's direct 
 application from being made*

 and the captain, I presume, will, in. liis 
 letter, find room to tell you when you 
 may look for your guests. We have 
 now something else to do ; and which is 
 doing with April faces. Mary is so busy

 to her as I had done, how happy vv^ould 
 be her lot ! Her dear uncle's heart w^ould 
 be at rest, and she in a course of im-

 I was pleased on Thursday morning to 
 find that my good baronet had not final-

 vinced that in a moderate use of them, 
 he will be in less danger of corruption,

 "which Mrs. Allen and myself were pre- 
 pared for the carriage, with an erect air^ 
 and as I thought a firmer step than usual, 
 to ask when the coach should draw up. 
 He wore his bridal suit, somewhat mo- 
 dernized ; an embroidered waistcoat, and, 
 as Mrs. Allen and myself both believe, a 
 rich diamond stock buckle; a new hat,

 remarks on his finery ; he prevented it, 
 by instantly adverting to my robe, which 
 was the one we embroidered together; 
 and paid it many compHments. Mrs. 
 Allen observed, that her grey silk gown 
 and black bonnet would disgrace the 
 well-dressed party. " No," replied he, 
 with easy politeness, '' that can never 
 happen, till you keep bad company. 
 Wisdom acknowledges her children under 
 any attire; and sober matron grace is 
 3^our ornament. But Malcolm means to 
 leave his boots behind him, and begs a 
 corner in the carriage with us," added 
 he, taking a pinch of snuiFfrom a superb 
 gold box ; '' i am not sorry to see him 
 now and then lay aside the farmer for 
 the ge7itleman, as of the latter class he 
 may always be, though of the former, 
 without sinking his character; whereas^ 
 I have seen farmers, and rich ones, who 
 were not, nor could be i^'ef^llemen.''

 Malcolm's entrance and dress produced 
 the consequences to be drawn from Sir 
 Murdock's inferences. He smiled on 
 him with complacence, and said, ''Why, 
 now, indeed, you look like a lover, and 
 a MadairnP' â€” *' When I forget what 
 either of those titles claim," rephed he, 
 gaily, " hang a calf skin on my recreant

 Thus attired we reached the Abbey. 
 The captain in his best regimentals was 
 prepared to receive his guests ; and leav- 
 ing the baronet to survey at his pleasure, 
 those stationary friends which lined the 
 room, Mrs. Allen and myself went to 
 Mrs, Heartley's. Mrs. Wilson was w^ith 
 her ; the girls were with Malcolm in the 
 garden, and in our view. ** Poor Miss

 observed the good woman, looking atten-

 rising; ''but in the mean time what is 
 become of our young folks. They do 
 not consider how cold it is turned." She 
 disappeared in order to give them the

 there are some of our fellow- creatures, so 
 richly endowed with virtuous propensi- 
 ties, that they appear to me to be pecu-

 pride of human reason ; and to exhibit 
 virtue in her native dignity and simpU* 
 city. What system of education, or what 
 refinements of the polite world, could 
 have better taught this woman the art 
 of conferring benefits without oppressing 
 the receiver, than her own heart, and the 
 precepts in the gospel. That which 
 thousands in the world would consider 
 as a work of supererogation and superla- 
 tive merit, she is firmly persuaded, is 
 doing no more than what Mr. and Mrs.

 was rich to an independent and wise man. 
 From that hour his plans have beea.

 LETTER XXIV. 
 
 From Rachel Coxvley to Mis^ Hurdcastle. 
 
 XT has fallen out exactly as Mrs. Allen 
 predicted ; my restlessness has done no 
 more than to Av^eary my body ; my mind 
 travels to you, and I must humour it. 
 We will not talk however of those, who, 
 with palpitating hearts, are, as they jour- 
 ney on, thinking of their first reception, 
 and the embarrassments of an introduc- 
 tion to beings of an higher order than 
 such poor mortals as croud this busy 
 scene. How I should enjoy your defeat, 
 Lucy, when your eyes, for the first time, 
 behold ** My fairest amongst women,'*

 an epithet you have so unmercifully ral- 
 lied. You will be candid, and I shall 
 forgive you ; only in future acknowledge 
 that I can. praise accurately^ and, in this 
 instance, have praised soberly. It is an 
 age since I have examined my talents in 
 this way ; but so confident am I that the 
 sight of Miss Howard and her uncle will 
 establish my. excellence as a painter, 
 whose hand is guided by truth and na- 
 ture, that I fearlessly send you two other 
 portraits, which ought long since to have 
 graced your cabinet. I wish Sedley was 
 thirty years older than he is, it would 
 save me the time necessary to delineate 
 not only the features, but the character 
 of Mr. Greenwood, who, 
 
 '' In manners gentle, in affection mild^ 
 In wit a man, simplicity a child," 
 
 brings to my fancy what Sedley will be 
 when a grandfather, and whom I already 
 reverence as one every time Mr. Green-

 wood speaks. They certainly are near 
 relations ; only nature, always provident 
 as well as kind in her donations, thought 
 that one at a time would be sufficient for 
 her honour; and one in a country enough 
 to allure mankind to a love of goodness 
 and simplicity of heart. One trait which 
 they possess in common, convinces mc 
 that my hypothesis is not altogether fal- 
 lacious ; for I dare not be saucy with 
 either, though I love them both. You 
 who are deeper than myself in metaphy- 
 sics, will descover the cause for my respect 
 and good behaviour with them, when, 
 with others, " my lips utter folly," and 
 lamas " a bubbling brook." 
 
 Doctor Douglas is the delight of my 
 eyes, and, like FalstafF, not only witty 
 himself, but the cause of wit in me; and 
 although it may not be Attic salt to all 
 palates, it supplies a seasoning necessary 
 to my hard fare. Douglas is a true and

 ^ London watchman than a physician. His 
 dress is the result of system, raised pro- 
 bably vipon his early modes of attire, and 
 abhorrence of hgatures. Cold bathing 
 and Bath-coating, a sort of cloth, sUcli 
 as your curricle wrapping-coat, are with 
 him the essentials health and longevi-

 either a carriage, a carpet, turtle soup, 
 crutches, or an apothecary. He is a wi- 
 dower, Lucy, and has too great boys, 
 whom he has rendered, as I am told by 
 himself, fit for any climate, and taught 
 to be contented with even barley-broth 
 and a knapsack. A healthy countenance,

 youth is past. These several defects and 
 impediments haVe preserved me from the 
 sin of inconstancy ; for I was in danger 
 of admiring, for the first time in my hfe 
 that I can recollect, one of tliose figures 
 which you would expect to find at the 
 head of a banditti, in the scenery of a 
 Salvator Rosa. After dinner 'Mr. Green- 
 wood, observing him making his dessert 
 of a piece of sea-biscuit, which he took 
 from his pocket, could not help expres- 
 sing his surprise, that he should hazard 
 the loss of such teeth as he envied. *' I 
 have every grinder," replied he, *' as 
 sound as when Nature gave them me." â€” 
 **0f this fact I needed no better evidence,'* 
 answered Mr. Greenwood, "than the 
 seeing you grind that flinty biscuit ; but

 by the loss of two or three of your fore- 
 teeth, to understand that j^ours, like your 
 neighbour's, were perishable." â€” *' Why

 remarked I ; '^ and what is more, they 
 would, like every thing artificial about 
 you, be disgraced by the gifts of Nature, 
 You can bite close enough with the 
 teeth vou have, whilst a fool and a sea- 
 rusk cost you so little to reduce them to 
 dust." He laughed, and displayed from 
 ear to ear, the snowy white and even 
 teeth ; not of Lucy Hardcastle's sort, be- 
 cause one would make four of her pearls, 
 but yet as well adapted to the mouth 
 they reside in. So much for the doctors 
 teeth ; now for his humour. Some one 
 asked him whether he had lately seen a 
 certain Sir Peregrine Lofley, a gentle- 
 man of consequence somewhere in the 
 neighbourhood. " No,." replied he,, with 
 a peculiar expression of contempt. ^' He 
 has not had the cholic of late; and when 
 he has, he will not apply to the Scotch 
 quack for physic ; he found mine unpala-

 Mr. Greenwood ; " when I last saw Sir

 Peregrine he told me you had saved his 
 life, and that the London physicians 
 Avere fit only to beat your pestle and 
 mortar." â€” ** That opinion speaks the 
 fool," answered he ; *^ but neither the 
 Scotch nor English physicians can cure 
 him of a radical want of brains. You 
 saw him three or four days after I had 
 accomphshed the same business which 
 they had done more than once; the only 
 difference consisted in the mode. This 
 fellow," continued he, turning to Sir 
 Murdock, " had, by his gluttony, pro- 
 duced a malady, which, without a mi- 
 racle, might have killed him in twenty 
 Lours ; and having heard of * one Dou- 
 glas,'' who had saved a man from a mor- 
 tification of the bowels, I was sent for. 
 The danger of Sir Peregrine was not less 
 imminent, but happily yielded to medi- 
 cine. Perfectly knowing the cause of the 
 malady, I became the friend of nature 
 and of him ; and for a few days longer

 than was absolutely necessary, kept him 
 on a very spare diet. He had been ter- 
 rified into docility, and, on enlarging his 
 bill of fare, I honestly told him, that his 
 health was in his own hands; that tem- 
 perance would preserve it, and that excess 
 in eating would shorten his life. From 
 this well-meant caution he drew an in- 
 ference perfectly useless. He would eat 
 nothing that Doctor Douglas did not 
 order; and during the course of a fort- 
 night I received my fee, for directing his- 
 cook to boil his mutton and make his 
 panada. I saw the machine was going^ 
 on well ; and, without farther concern, 
 took his superfluous gold for advice and 
 controul so beneficial to him. Not, how- 
 ever, classing him with my sick patients, 
 I one morning omitted my visit. The fol- 
 lowing evening as I called on passing his 
 door,^^ I was questioned on the cause of 
 viy neglect. He had expected me in the 
 morning. * I had a great desire for a

 with a disturbed air, * but I did not dare 
 to eat of it without your permission/ â€” 
 * It is not my intention, my good Sir,' 
 replied I, to play le docteur Pedro Rezio

 petite of le governeur Sancho Panca, all 
 things are lawful with one sauce, moder- 
 ation and exercise. Eat like a plough- 
 man if it please you, on condition you 
 work like one.' He graciously smiled, 
 and said he would try what he could do 
 when stronger. I now mentioned the 
 melancholy accident Avhich had engaged 
 me the whole of the day. A man work- 
 ing" on the roof-beams of a house had 
 fallen ; he had broken his thigh, and, as 
 it was supposed, had fractured his head. 
 It appeared that this unfortunate man 
 had been Sir Peregrine's carpenter, but 
 had incurred his sore displeasure by two 
 offences equally unpardonable. The first 
 was, refusing him his vote for the candi-

 could read ; and with this dangerous talent 
 he had discovered, that he was not alto- 
 gether a piece of elm or oak. ' And was it 
 for this fellow, doctor, that Sir Peregrine 
 Lofley was neglected?* said he, rising 
 from an easy- chair, with much resent- 
 ment; i surely you must know that he 
 is a notorious Jacobin! a rascal who 
 reads newspapers and seditious tracts-, at 
 alehouses; and prates, of magna- charta 
 and the liberty of the press I He is the 
 veriest dog in the neighbourhood a 
 common nuisance! Surely you must have 
 known this !' â€” ' I was perfectly acquaint- 
 ed with the man's reputed character,' an- 
 swered I, drily; ' but I was called upon 
 to judge of his fractured skull, not of his 
 political creed. It happens, however, for- 
 tunately for my hopes of saving his life, 
 which is not unuseful to his wife and 
 six children, that he has loved poHtics

 haughtiness, ' to place my health in any 
 man's hands^ on whom I cannot depend 
 for punctuality as well cls judgment ; and 
 1 should conceive that Doctor Douglas 
 has had no reason to complain of my 
 want of attention to his visits.' He of- 
 fered his guinea : I declined it. ' This 
 was a call en passant,' observed I, * but 
 it has led to an explanation of your ex- 
 pectations. These, Sir Peregrine, may, 
 on certain occasions, be regarded by me, 
 as not less incumbent on your medical at- 
 tendant's observance, than they appear 
 useless at this moment. All are men, 
 without distinction, on my list of pa- 
 tients ; the urgency of the case settles 
 their precedence. You want not medical

 the Tweed.* I left him swelHng with 
 rage, and have never seen him since; 
 and finding that I am neither a demo- 
 crat, nor a nuisance, he calls me a ^pre- 
 tending quack P â€” ^' And yet," observed the 
 delighted Sir Murdock, ** the united suf- 
 frages of every university in Europe 
 could not have better qualified a man for 
 the purposes of healing the sick. Your 
 remedies must be infallible, doctor, if you 
 can prescribe to other diseases as well as 
 you have done to pride and narrowness 
 of spirit." â€” '' The patient was heartily 
 welcome to it," replied he, with invincible 
 gravity. *' I am not an ill-natured man, 
 Sir Murdock, and when a good action of 
 this sort falls in my way I conceive it to 
 be my duty to be useful. It is true that 
 my nostrums, on such occasions, are like

 ** I wish I could give you a special 
 diploma, Douglas, for prescribing your 
 physic to those who do not ask for it," 
 observed the mild Greenwood ; *' you 
 might find plenty of patients, who, not 
 ihmking * they need a physician, become 
 incurable by neglect."â€”'* Is not that your 
 fault," asked he, smiling; ** you are too 
 tender and compassionate. The diet you 
 prescribe ot self-knowledge and self-dis- 
 cipline, will not do for all constitutions. 
 Some ;need caustics and the probcy and 
 with such patients will Douglas exercise 
 his functions without interfering in your 
 trade." The good doctor had, however, 
 as I thought, been rather too tender of 
 a foible of his own. His national preju- 
 dices had not been pruned. " Scotland 
 was the genial soil of philosophy, cour- 
 age, and honour," The conversation

 took, from some assertions of this sort, 
 an argumentative form. Malcolm with 
 delight listened to his father's eloquence. 
 Stimulated hy his opponents, Mr. Green- 
 wood and the captain, and supporting 
 Douglas's arguments, he forgot the past; 
 and brought forth his long-concealed 
 stories of knowledge, with an animation 
 which marked the acuteness of his mind 
 and the strength of his memory. 
 
 Wherefore is it, my dear Lucy, that so 
 many are found who, in the pride of 
 reason, appear to forget the feeble tenure 
 on which depends their boasted privileges; 
 their justly prized prerogatives ? The pul- 
 sation of an artery more or less rapid 
 than suits our fragile frame, may, in a 
 moment suspend, and, for a 'time, anni- 
 hilate those faculties that distinguish us 
 from the brute that perishes. Are we 
 not liable to diseases, to accidents, to 
 sorrows, which no human skill can reme- 
 dy, no human prudence can prevent^

 UURING an interval of three or four 
 weeks, the period during which Captain 
 Flint was on his excursion to Heathcot, 
 no occurences of importance to this l)is- 
 tory appear in Miss Co\vJey's letters to 
 her friend. It is my duty to supply this 
 chasm by detailing a few particulars re- 
 lative to Mr. Horace Hardcastle's situ- 
 ation and pursuits, these being so im- 
 mediately connected with the thread of 
 the narrative as to claim attention. 
 
 The young nobleman, his friend, with 
 whom he went abroad, continued gra- 
 dually to yield to the slow, but fatal ma- 
 lady which had so long menaced the

 hopes of his family. Intervals of com- 
 parative ease, with that flow of spirits 
 which commonly attends this disease, 
 and which was further sustained by his 
 patience and principles, had, from time 
 to time, beguiled him in the course of 
 his unprofitable search after health. He 
 became weary of the sea, and disgusted 
 by the confinement of a -ship's cabin ; 
 and he expressed much reluctance to quit- 
 ting Lisbon, where he had wintered. His 
 friends about him strongly recommended 
 to him a retreat from the heat of the 
 summer, which was within their reach, 
 and the accustomed resort of the society 
 to which he was attached and endeared. 
 Doctor Innes, his tutor, convinced of 
 the inutility of the many cruises he had 
 patiently submitted to undertake, and 
 the necessity of amusing his mind, im- 
 mediately secured, in this delightful 
 asylum, a convenient house for his re- 
 ception, to which the family repaired in 
 the early months of the summer.

 The mutual confidence which subsisted 
 between Lord William and Horace Hard- 
 castle, was of that nature which pre- 
 cludes all concealment ; and the dejec* 
 tion of the lover's spirits was not only 
 a subject of disquietude to Lord William, 
 but of anxiety to Doctor Innes. He was 
 influenced, by the account given him of 
 the young man's difficulties, to write to 
 his uncle, Mr. Freeman ; and, stating to 
 him his fears for his nephew's health, he 
 with much earnestness expatiated at 
 large on the effects of a domineering pas- 
 sion. '' I have, my good friend," added 
 the doctor, *' said thus much of Mr. 
 Hardcastle's inclination, because I well 
 know it was implanted, and is nourished, 
 by the purest affections of his nature. 
 Oppositionr ^ill never destroy it; but it 
 checks his activity, preys on his spirits, 
 and may blast the hopes of his family. It 
 is time his father should know this. Some 
 indulgence is necessary^ unless he means

 to sacrifice his happiness to a point of 
 honour." Alarmed by the seriousness of 
 this application, Mr. Freeman determined 
 to quit his beloved home, and to plead 
 in person for the lovers ; conceiving 
 that Mr. Hardcastle Avould be more ac- 
 cessible to his remonstrances, when urged 
 by an affection which had led him to 
 think Horace a match for the first woman 
 breathing, in point of merit. He was 
 successful, or rather Doctor Innes's let- 
 ter prevailed. The interdiction of wri- 
 ting was removed ; and Horace was in- 
 formed that he had only to be cheerful 
 till Miss Cowley ceased to love; knd to 
 wait patiently for Counsellor Steadman's 
 operations with the redoubtable Mr. 
 Fiamall. These letters, and the change 
 of measures which Mr. Hardcastle had 
 adopted, were carefully concealed from 
 Miss Cowley. Horace had been mentioned 
 as not only depressed but indisposed ^ and 
 the confederacy who had jointly aided in

 the victory over his good father, con- 
 curred with Miss Hardcastle that it was 
 more prudent to leave Miss Cowley in 
 repose, and to Horace the pleasure of 
 telling his own tale. Mr. Freeman, con- 
 tented with these advantages, and en- 
 couraged by JMr. Steadman's concur- 
 rence, with whom he had an interview 
 in London, in his way to Heathcot, re- 
 turned home. Captain Flint and Miss 
 Howard's arrival immediately followed. 
 Some conversation, relative to her be- 
 loved brother, led Miss Hardcastle to say 
 to her guests, that she had been very 
 unhappy from the time he had left Eng- 
 land : *' but Heaven be praised," added 
 .she, with unguarded warmth, *' we shall 
 be happy soon !" â€” '' Do you expect your 
 brother home ?" asked the captain. *' No, 
 but he will be more comfortable than 
 he has been abroad," answered she, with 
 viv'acily ; " and it has been his dejection

 Im allotted space. We have been con- 
 staÂ«t residents in this terrestrial paradise 
 pnly since the first of June. Our spa- 
 cious house and elevated situation at 
 Lisbon, being perfectly adapted to our 
 dear invalid's comforts ; and to say the 
 truth, we quitted the view of the noblest 
 harbour in Europe, with an intire per- 
 suasion, that we might have remained 
 with safety under its protection and the 
 the sea-breeze, which blew on our faces 
 from every balcony. But Lord William 
 had not then seen Cintra 1 He had not 
 then seen from the Cabo de Penah, nor 
 from Cape Rogue, the sublime objects of 
 nature which surround them. Rocks 
 and mountains ; the expanded ocean ; 
 the wide-stretching Tagus ; plains rich in 
 cultivation; impending woods; bubbling 
 fountains, and falling cascades ! Nor had 
 he then traced the footsteps of havoc and 
 confusion, left by the earthquake, and

 my Lucy the names of those writers who 
 have embelHshed their works with a de-

 an adventure much more interesting to 
 myself. Twiss, Baretti, Southby's Tours

 your curiosity, as to the spot in which 
 I met with my good genii. You will 
 not wonder, that your brother seeks soli- 
 tude. My Curro *, who knows his mas- 
 ter for his friend, is no less hnpatient 
 than he is, for the early dawn ; about 
 that hour he conducts me daily to some 
 otherwise almost inaccessible haunt, and 
 contentedly browzes the verdant paths in 
 his way. The sun had gained upon us,

 who has heen hanished by the superior

 elegant girl, seated on a fragment of a

 her, and she in evident distress. The 
 narrow path admitted of no deviation; 
 I was obliged to pass the supposed

 stopped, and learned, that fearful of 
 trusting herself to the sagacious 'animal 
 she had rode, she had left her party at 
 the Cork convent*, preferring to walk.

 gentleman producing a green satin 
 slipper, which might have rivalled Cin-

 our disaster ; the heel snapped, and here 
 we are, with a sprained ancle ! The 
 husband, rather than the lover, appeared 
 in this observation; and my idea was 
 confirmed ; for the pretty creature, rub- 
 hing the ancle with a hand which did 
 not disgrace it, displayed a wedding 
 ling; and with assumed gaiety, said,

 would be well." The gentleman, as in 
 duty bound, assisted her in mounting his 
 own; and with the utmost caution, we 
 proceeded down to the village. Having

 timid charge unaffectedly thanked me 
 for my goodness ; and in reply to her 
 companion's raillery on being such ai 
 coward, she remarked the superiority of 
 the beast she was on, to the wretched 
 animal they had lent her at the hotel ; 
 adding, that the satisfaction of leaving 
 him feeding, was one motive for hec 
 preferring to walk. " I might have 
 guessed as much," replied her companion;; 
 "but after all, my dear Margaret, yoa 
 have been more charitable than fortunate.

 cheerfulness, " but I shall have time to 
 rest on ship-board." This observation 
 led to my being informed tliat she was 
 going with her brother to Jamaica, 
 where her husband was expecting her. 
 ** It will be a long and a tedious time 
 before we shall meet," added she with 
 tenderness: ** and when I think of the

 plied she with emotion. 
 
 We reached the hotel, and I took my

 sister, and another lady whom I recol- 
 lected as being the -wife of a merchant 
 resident in Lisbon. The name of Flint 
 had visibly discomposed me; and for 
 some moments I had only to Hsten to the 
 reiterated acknowledgments of the deh- 
 cate Mrs. Flint. She was still at the 
 breakfast- table, and with the most per- 
 fect contentment she told me that her 
 friend had not only enjoined her the 
 penance of remaining in her bed longer, 
 by some hours, than was her custom, but 
 had doomed her to the sofa for the 
 whole day.; and with a sw^et and amiable 
 frankness of manner she reminded me of 
 my little services ; intreatingme to assist 
 her again, and by dining with them to 
 make her peace with her brother, who 
 had threatened to reduce her to a pigmy- 
 height by obliging her to wear flat-heeled

 up resolution to ask her, whether she 
 was connected with the Flints of Tare-

 brother, without hesitation, answered^ 
 that his sister was the wife of Mr. Philip.

 , trembling with agitation, " you know 
 she is atTarefield with Lady Maclairn?" 
 â€” " Margaret knows little of her hus- 
 band's family," answered he, ** having 
 always resided in Scotland." I was 
 silenced, and a certain air of embarrass- 
 ment was dispelled from Mrs. Flint's, 
 countenance by the lady's asking her 
 brother, whether it was still his intention? 
 to leave Lisbon on the Saturday. He 
 replied in the affirmative, allowing for 
 winds and tides ; then turning to me, he

 sallying out we found the potent rays of 
 the mid-day sun inconvenient ; and al- 
 lured by a fountain within two hundred 
 paces of the hotel, we took our seats by 
 it, under the umbrageous shelter of the 
 cork and elm-trees. 
 
 I immediately began the conversa- 
 tion by apologizing for the warmth and 
 earnestness of my interrogations relative 
 to Tarefield ; and proceeded to inform 
 him of so much of Miss Cowley's his- 
 tory as was needful, in order to account 
 for the interest I had discovered in 
 relation to her. In the course of my 
 little narrative, I spoke of Mr. Flamall, 
 as having by his authority removed his 
 ward from friends devoted to her, and to 
 "whom she Avas attached; and I added that, 
 having learned from you the repugnance 
 with which Miss Cowley had quitted her 
 wonted asylum, I wish to know, that, 
 with Lady Maclairn, her situation had

 been such as slie merited. ' " We know 
 none of Philip's connections," answered 
 he, carelessly lading* the Hmpid water 
 with a brass bason attached by a chain 
 to the fountain; " but if Philip's mother 
 resembles him, she mast be worthy of 
 the guest you have described ; for he is a 
 good and an Jionest man. For the rest of 
 his relations, to give you my honest 
 opinion of them, I do not beheve they 
 would give this cup of water towards the 
 happiness of any one. As for his precious 
 uncle Flamall, he is a complete scoun- 
 drel." â€” ** Then vou know him !" obser- 
 ved I, eagerly. *' Yes, yes," answered 
 he, with warmth, ** I know him, and I

 jt should strengthen his own." I now, 
 my deiir Lucy, more expHcitiy detailed 
 to him Miss Cowley's connection with 
 this villain: and if my own wretched 
 anxieties appeared, I could not help it. 
 He listened to me with the deepest atten- 
 tion, and grasping my hand, swore a 
 solemn oath, to search to the bottom of 
 a business so perfectly consonant to the 
 man's character and conduct. " Hear 
 my story, Mr. Hardcastle, and then 
 judge whether your Miss Cowley's cause 
 can be in better hands,'* added he, in an 
 impressive tone. ** I do not believe she 
 would need a defender whilst an honest 
 man can be found ; but to me she shall be

 having destined me to the same pursuits 
 in life, from which he had risen to re- 
 spectable opulence. I had quitted my 
 father's study, who was a minister of the 
 kirk of Scotland, some time before his 
 decease; and under the favour of my 
 good uncle had then risen nearly to my 
 present station, to wit, commander of 
 one of his ships, instead of one of my 
 <rwn, which is at present in this port. I 
 was fortunately not too remote from my 
 father for his last blessing and embrace. 
 I had also the consolation to find, that 
 my uncle was disposed to render my 
 mother and sister comfortable ; an atten- 
 tion pecuharly necessary in the low con- 
 dition of my father's finances. I am eight 
 or nine years older than Margaret, and, 
 both in principles and affection, disposed 
 to perform the relative duties of a father 
 and a brother. Such were my sentiments 
 when I left her, after tlie events which I

 have mentioned, to return to America. 
 During au absence of three years from 
 my native home, I heard with content- 
 ment of my mother's tranquillity, and of 
 the improvement of the poor little girl 
 you have seen. She was, Mr. Hardcastle, 
 my delight and pride from her cradle; 
 and I knew that in my mother's care, her 
 innocence was secure. This spring 1 had 
 an opportunity I had long desired ; and 
 I failed not to avail myself of it to visit 
 my mother. I was so pressed for time, 
 and urged by impatience^ that I arrived 
 unexpectedly ; and with some surprise I 
 found that my mother had given up her 
 house in Edinburgh, and lived near it, at 
 a small village indicated to me. On 
 reaching her abode, the cause of her 
 removal was apparent in the emaciated 
 form which poor Margaret exhibited. I 
 was told she had been some months de- 
 clining in health ; and tha^country air

 had been judged more favourable to her, 
 than that of the town. AVe are no adepts 
 at hypocrisy. My mother's agitations 
 betrayed her. On my asking whether any 
 love disappointment had laid the founda- 
 tlni of the illness, she burst into tears; 
 and unable to contain the secret, told me 
 the sorrows of her aching heart. 
 
 '* My sister had for a playmate and 
 friend an amiable girl, somewhat older 
 than herself, of the name of Montrose. 
 They Avere near neighbours, and their 
 parents were in the habits of familiar 
 and friendly intercourse. On the death

 to give up her house, received, but with

 for the suitable inmate of a house re- 
 inaikaWy sober and well regulated. 
 Young Montrose was a pupil of the 
 same gentleman, and had already distin- 
 guished himself for talents and applica- 
 tion. I will abridge my romance, by 
 telling you at once the result of his love 
 advances to Margaret. Their measures 
 were wonderfully prudent, when you 
 take into the account the age of the 
 lovers, who could only reckon eight or 
 nine and thirty years between them ; and 
 those of their faitliful and zealous confi- 
 dants, who, in their calculation might 
 have a right to four or five more. With 
 the assistance of Montrose, they were 
 married, and with the consummate pru- 
 dence of an old civilian this young man 
 saw, that the marriage was duly and 
 legally valid, according to the laws of 
 Scotland, his friend being anxiously 
 solicitous on this point; pleading his 
 dread of his despotical uncle, and the

 influence he maintained over every branch 
 of his family. A few short weeks of 
 pej^fect happiness were the prelude to 
 Margaret's cares. The fond husband 
 took all the blame on himself like an 
 honest fellow ; and at my mother's feet 
 made a confession which subdued her,; 
 for it finished by imploring her pity and 
 consideration of his wife's condition; 
 urging her to permit the marriage cere- 
 mony to be renewed in her presence, if 
 she were dissatisfied with the proofs 
 which her daughter could produce of the- 
 legality of those vows which had united 
 them. ^ My own marriage was not more 
 binding,' added my dear mother, *and 
 what could I do, Henry ?' * Exactly that 
 which you have done,' answered I. ^ Pro- 
 ceed.' * Nothing could be more amiable 
 than his conduct was to Margaret and

 certain he should have a friend- in his 
 mother, and that his sister Lucretia 
 would make him independent the day he 
 was of age; for that she hated to see 
 him controuled by a man so tyrannical 
 as Mr. Flamall.' A letter from this sister, 
 broke in upon our comforts : it was af- 
 fectionate and tender in the extreme ; it 
 contained bank notes to the amount of 
 a hundred and twenty pounds, and a 
 letter from Mr. Oliver Flint, his eldest 
 brother, with an invitation to come over 
 to him to Jamaica.' My mother then men- 
 tioned Philip's being a posthumous child, 
 with those particulars which you know 
 relative to his father's second marriage, 
 and extraordinary will," continued Mr. 
 Sinclair, " which particulars I pass over. 
 Miss Flint urged him, in th'^ letter, to 
 avail himself of his brother's good inten- 
 tions. ' You will,' added she, ' by this 
 means shake off the yoke, which now 
 oppresses you more than it serves you.

 to my mother by the servant-maid, in

 had been employed to destroy him, had

 ample instructions, to repair immediately 
 to London ; where his brother's agent

 what I could collect from Margaret

 having been tlie cause of all the mischief.

 conniving at the shedding of innocent 
 blood, I will proceed to inform you that 
 I am deserted for ^plmn-cake, which will 
 not be eaten till Twelfth-day at Dur-

 train annually assit to cut up, I am, how-

 the intense coldness of the atmosphere. 
 Wisely, however, reflecting that I had not

 snow-shoes and India-shawl, I scudded 
 away to the village, in order to see dame

 wind at my heels, sent me forward with 
 a blithsome heart. I found her hearth

 eottoned up with Mary's comforts, that 
 even the rheumatism is kept in check. 
 She was quite amazed how I could 
 " brave such deadly cold weather ; and 
 yet I looked like a full-blown rose, and 
 so cheerful ! But that did not amaze her, 
 for in warming other people's hearts my 
 own would always be gay." On leaving her 
 cottage the whim took me to visit some 
 friends of my own ; and cheered by a ft\^ 
 benedictions, and as many welcomes, I re- 
 solved to return home, by taking the cir- 
 cuit of the mill. Now, knowing that 
 the finest description of a frost-piece 
 that the most poetical imagination ever 
 composed, would not please Mary, at 
 least so well as one of my long stories, I 
 will spare myself the disgrace of being 
 censured as the dullest of mortals in this 
 art ; and the shame of feeling, that this is 
 probably one reason for my yawning over 
 descriptive subjects, except with a crayon 
 at my fingers' ends. But we have all our

 lection of oneof Quarles's emblems. You 
 ma}^, if your less retentive memory need 
 it, still borrow the book from Deborah ; 
 and with the pictures recall the days 
 when the restless Rachel stood for hours 
 quietly listening to her expounding his-

 devices, if I be not mistaken, exhibits a 
 youth borne on the wing of Hope, Fancy, 
 and Desire, to an elevation remote from 
 his safe abode. Careless of the approach- 
 ing stoiTn he still advances in his heed- 
 less career, till nature, exhausted, prompts 
 him to pause. He does so, and with 
 terror and amasement beholds the black- 
 ened sky, and hears the threatening 
 thunder roll over his defenceless head*

 friendly sun, from time to time warned 
 her, by his retiring brightness, that he 
 had something else to do besides gladden- 
 ing her path. At length I took the 
 alarm, and on looking towards his late 
 refulgent road, saw him covered with a 
 black curtain, which, from time to time, 
 he put aside, to see whether the heedless 
 wanderer had wisdom and was seeking a 
 refuge. 1 had the wisdom to speed as 
 fast as I could to the miller's house, which 
 was the nearest; but, like my emblem, 
 I had not learned to know, that sailing 
 with a fair wind, and an adverse one, 
 made some difference in the course of the 
 ship. I had now a north-easter in my 
 teeth ; and as if in return for my temerity, 
 he rattled with his rude blast a shower of 
 hailstones about my ears, which, though 
 they did not subdue my courage, greatly 
 discomfited me. The gracious luminary 
 once more peeped through his veil and 
 smiled on me. I had gained the last

 field between me and my retreat M^hen I 
 took advantage of the hedge in order to 
 adjust my shawl more about my face, 
 which smarted with the keen blasts, and 
 to recover my panting breath for renew- 
 ed buifettings. At this providential mor 
 ment I heard a child, concealed from my 
 view by some hurdles, crying most lar 
 mentably, and repeatedly sayuig, '^ Get 
 up, Johnny! pray get up! let us go. home! 
 I will go without you !" I removed this 
 hurdle, and perceived the mourner in the 
 hollow path. He was a stout boy of 
 about nine years old,^ and was endea- 
 vouring to raise from the ground one of 
 about seven, who appeared insensible. 
 The danger was apparent ; I flew to the 
 children. *' Where is your home?" asked 
 I. '* At the mill," answered the shivering 
 boy. *' Pray wake brother Johnny, he 
 does not mind me ; and my granny will 
 scold me if leave him, because I took 
 him out without leave," Unmindful of

 this petition, with the sturdy boy's help, 
 I wrapped the torpid child in my shawl, 
 which, as you know, is of the largest size, 
 and I hastened to the house, with the of- 
 fending and terrified culprit. He com- 
 plained that he was weary and must rest; 
 M'hilst I, with an air of authority, dragged 
 him on till I became nearly exhausted 
 myself, though remote from his danger; 
 for I did not even feel it was cold, so great 
 was my terror respecting the poor child 
 I had left behind me, and the dread of 
 seeing the one with me refuse to advance; 
 for he hung back from time to time, say- 
 ing that I hurt him, that he would sit 
 down a while, and bade me go on with- 
 out him. 
 
 From this terrible dilemma I >vas re- 
 lieved by meeting with a servant of the 
 house, who was looking for the vagrants. 
 He called to another, and I was soon 
 reheved from my burden, who had con- 
 quered me, and had composedly laid

 person who bore the child in his arms to 
 the house, and the other man went for- 
 wards to the succour of the poor aban- 
 doned boy. 
 
 A neat and genteel-looking woman 
 met us in the yard, M'hom, from her terror 
 and grief, I supposed to be their mother. 
 I tried to allay her fears, but finding 
 that was not possible, contented myself 
 with supplying her duty. She carried 
 the boy to the kitchen fire, and, weeping 
 bitterly, began to chafe his hands. My 
 authoritative voice was at length heard, 
 and in spite of his outcries he was put to 
 bed in the blankets. Happily the village 
 farrier was present, and supported me in my 
 opinion. He said he had read some publish- 
 ed cases of the Humane Society, and that he 
 would answer for the other child if they 
 would trust to him. The child appeared, 
 and my shawl having been useful, he was 
 judged to be in no danger by the doctor,

 with snow. The children being consi- 
 dered as safe, I was next thought of. 
 Wit;h many excuses the young woman 
 led me through a large brick-floored par- 
 lour to a neat staircase, which conducted 
 us to a very pretty snug room, in v/hich 
 was quietly seated an old lady knitting; 
 and who had, as it appeared, escaped 
 the general horror of the family in the 
 kitchen, by being somewhat deaf and 
 lame. She looked surprised by my m?. 
 trusion, but instantly enquired whether 
 the children were returned. The daughter, 
 with more self-command than I expect- 
 ed, replied in tne affirmative, adding 
 that I had been so good as to lead them 
 liome. Her face betrayed, however, in 
 part, the disaster, and I assured the grand- 
 mother that the danger was past and both 
 children doino' well. Her thanks for mv 
 services were followed by her ** being-

 she thought something warm and com- 
 fortable better for me than wine. I was 
 entirely of the same opinion. Susan was 
 dispatched to hasten matters below stairs; 
 whilst with officious zeal I was placed 
 in her own white dimity easy chair, and 
 the hearth was replenished with fuel. 
 The neatness of the apartment, the order 
 which presided at the dining-tahle, the

 which was served a boiled fowl with ve-

 opulence did not belong to the miller's

 of my famished stomach, than 1 thought 
 of my friends at the hall, and dispatched

 â‚¬oach came for me. I added a verbal 
 commission- to the note, and desired that 
 the person who was to carry it, might 
 be cautioned to say nothing of the cause 
 of my delay. The old lady heard more 
 of this message than I intended. She 
 turned pale, and with much emotion 
 said, she was sure the truth had been 
 kept from her : she vv^ould see her chil- 
 dren, and if they could not come to her 
 she would be carried to them. A more 
 particular detail of the disaster followed ; 
 and her daughter assured her both her 
 boys were in a fine perspiration, and 
 the apothecary had no doubt but they 
 would be fit to truant again on the mor- 
 row. The grandmother still looked incre- 
 dulous. ** My dear Madam," observed I,

 satisfied that the children are doing well : 
 why should you now doubt of their

 ourselves." She wept. '* However," 
 added she, ** their aunt is father and

 sort of apology for her carelessness, that 
 the eldest boy had persuaded Johnny to 
 leave the mill-chamber where they were 
 playing, to go and slide with some boys

 she, ** this wing can hardly be said to

 came up. In summer we enter by the gar-

 quickness. *' What business does your 
 daughter follow ?" asked I. *' She was

 her that she gave me credit for more 
 courage than I had, for that on sallying 
 out I had turned my back on the enemy,, 
 forgetting that he would not turn his on 
 me on my return home. But he shall 
 not intimidate me," added I ; *' fori will

 said the sight of me would do her good

 now entered to say that the carriage was 
 in sight, and I instantly took my leave of 
 the good woman, whose spirits did not 
 appear quite composed enough to receive 
 more guests ; and as I perceived Mrs.

 Before night her philanthropy cooled. 
 My colour oifended her : I was, (she in- 
 sisted it should be so,) feverish : and she 
 gave the most solid reasons in the world 
 for the partinacity of her opinion : *' it 
 was impossihle I should be otherwise." 
 As my stiff joints and aching head were 
 rather too stubborn evidences in her fa- 
 vour ; and, being moreover too sleepy for 
 a debate, I ' passively suffered her to 
 make me up like a bale of flannel; and 
 drinking with docility a treacle posset, 
 to her great contentment I fell asleep ; 
 when, lo and behold ! the fever had dis-

 my existence ; for not a dream had found 
 access to my fancy in all those dormant 
 hours. The dear and too tender Allen 
 is now only anxious for my complexion.

 me not to write any longer. The second

 " Poor naked wretches, with houseless

 cies it admits of no limitation, and that

 It may therefore be as well to inform her,

 you will say, that even Horace Hardcas- 
 tle must fall short of that elevation to 
 which my fond imagination has raised 
 him. You are deceived ; I neither ex- 
 pect, nor even wish for absolute perfec-

 too strong a light would but dazzle and 
 confound them. But I love Horace even 
 in his foibles ; twelve years acquaintance 
 with them have made them my own, as 
 well as his virtues. But to be serious, tell 
 me to whose influence was your dear 
 mother indebted for a docihty on my 
 part which she did not even expect from 
 the untamed rebel to all constraint. To 
 whom am I indebted for patience, and 
 forbearance now? What moral attain- 
 ment, what acquired knowledge do I 
 possess, that has not been encouraged by 
 Horace's example ? I never was, nor ever 
 shall be, one of your sentimental misses

 I think, if I can judge of myself, that I 
 am ungentle by nature, and so fond of 
 freedom, as to love but little the shackles 
 which some so eagerly seek. I am con- 
 fident however, that I have one ingredi- 
 ent necessary for perfect love ifor Ifear^ 
 and I always have feared Horace. How 
 often has his reproving eye recalled me 
 to obedience and submission ! What has 
 been the delight, when by my little ex- 
 ertions, and petty triumphs over my tur- 
 bulent spirit, I have seen his face glowing 
 with pleasure, and heard his joy express- 
 ed by his saying, " Rachel Cowley will 
 be as gentle and amiable as my mother !" 
 I am persuaded that Heaven has destined 
 Horace Hardcastle to be my guide and 
 my protector. I should faint and tire 
 in the road of duty with a companion 
 whose paths I had to chuse and point 
 out. But with Horace Hardcastle I shall 
 be safe, for he will neither loiter himself,

 Finding I began to be weary of my good 
 friend Eolus(foronemay be tired of what 
 is good, by having too much of it,) I de- 
 termined, in order to vary the scene, to 
 pay a morning visit to my new friends at 
 the mill. " I should like," said I, ** to see 
 these boys now warmed into life by a 
 pinch of snuff and snow water." The 
 whole junto took the alarin. The roads 
 were impassable; I should get my death 
 of cold. I only laughed at their prognos- 
 tics, and persisted in my intention, urg- 
 ing that the thaw, which has began here, 
 had moderated the severity of the air. 
 Lady Maclairn, always ready at an ex- 
 pedienty recollected that the coach- wheels 
 wanted some repair, and her cook some 
 corn to be ground for the fowls ; and 
 that at all events it waÂ§ better for nie to 
 ride than to walk in the dirt. I readily 
 conceded to this opinion, and, being 
 wrapped up in pelisses and shawls, to the 
 exact resemblance of the bag of corn, I

 my opinion, more indicativ^e of good 
 sense than a habit of order. But let us 
 go on.. The old lady was giving the boys 
 their reading-lesion when I entered, in a 
 bible which was before them. Susan was 
 making a muslin gown. My entrance iti^ 
 terrupted them ; and my notice of the 
 children was followed by their being dis- 
 missed, but not before the grandmother, 
 with unaffected anxiety, dictated to them 
 their speech of gratitude to the dear 
 good young lady who had saved their 
 lives. This ceremony performed, they 
 with plowing cheeks retired to enjoy^ 
 unconstrainedly, their existence. My 
 observations were next directed to the

 beautiful muslin robe Susan ^vas trim- 
 ming with very iiue edging: it was made 
 with taste, in the Circassian stile, as the 
 fasliion has named it. '' It is intended 
 for a bride who lives in this neighbour- 
 hood/' observed Susan, with a suppressed 
 smile ; ** perhaps you may have seen the 
 young lady : she rides frequently on 
 horseback." Finding this insufficient for 
 my information, she proceeded to tell me 
 tliat it was Miss Gubbins she meant, who 
 was going to be married to a young 
 farmer. * 'Her father," added she, '*k ows 
 what is to be done in that line of busiuess 
 by experience : he has got a good fortune 
 by the plow." I instantly recollected 
 having met this Miss Gubbins on her 
 road ; and the idea of her singularly short 
 and corpulent person, in a Circassian 
 robe, was too ludicrous for my gravity. 
 *' Dear me ! " observed the old lady, who 
 had joined in my laugh with great glee,

 straw or black silk bonnet is supplied by 
 velvet, flowers, and feathers. It was 
 only yesterday that a dairy-maid was here 
 to get Susan to shorten the waist of her 
 Sunday-gown, and to make it draw round 
 the neck with a frill like the ladies'." â€” 
 " My mother makes very free with my 
 customers, Madam," observed Susan, 
 smiling; " she forgets that those who 
 keep a stall in "oanity fair live by the 
 folly of those who buy; and to say the 
 truth, so do I sometimes, for it is amaz- 
 ing to see the money now expended by a 
 class of people who, a few years since were

 Susan folded up the robe, and made her 
 apology for quitthig me. She was going 
 to her shop with ]\Iiss Gubbins in the 
 gig, which was in sight, and she left us. 
 I mentioned my intention of employing 
 her to the good old lady, and engaged 
 to speak to the ladies of the hall, not 
 doubting but we should want Circassian 
 robes with the rest of our neighbours.

 amazing rapidity, '* one can hardly be-

 the day or two after I had seen my hus- 
 band a corpse, that she came to succour 
 me. Susan Avas then at my breast, and I 
 had a boy and a girl besides her to sup- 
 port. My poor husband," continued she, 
 brushing away a tear, " was well known 
 at Chelsea; he was a boatman, and always 
 called * honest Frank' by the gentry ; 
 for he was sober, diligent, and civil. He 
 lost his precious life in endeavouring to 
 save a man from drowning who was in- 
 toxicated, and could do nothing forhim* 
 selÂ£ A subscription was raised for my 
 relief. But it w^as Mrs. Flint who poured 
 the oil into my wounds. She it was 
 who raised my eyes to God, and bade 
 me trust to the never- failing friend of 
 the widow and the fatherless. She found 
 I was expert at needle- work, and she 
 furnished me with plenty of it, besides 
 assisting me with money, for my rent and 
 -coals. I got on with comfort like this. 
 When my daughter Jenny was fourteen,

 she fixed her with an old lady, a widow, 
 with whom she went to live at Newcas- 
 tle. Jane was a clever, active girl, and could 
 read and write well. Her lady became so 
 fond of her that she made her, as one may 
 say, her favoured child, and when she 
 died left her all her clothes and Hnen 
 with three hundred pounds. She was 
 too well trained to forget her mother in 
 her prosperity ; and on her marrying a 
 farmer, to whom she had been sometime 
 engaged, I removed, and settled at New- 
 castle, Jane being fixed near that town. 
 Thus I lost sight of Mrs. Flint, and 
 escaped, in part, the sorrow of her death, 
 which happened soon after. But I 
 shall never forget her ! No, nor the 
 angel who used to accompany her to 
 see us, w^ith her pockets filled with cakes 
 for Frank, who was nearly of her own age. 
 I think I now see her putting on Susan's 
 new shoes, and exulting over her, be- 
 cause she could step alone* But she waÂ«

 a beauty ! I do not think Miss Howard 
 altogether so beautiful as her mother; 
 for Mrs. Howard liad height, and more 
 vivacity; but if she is as good, it will be 
 well for her that she has lived in this 
 world of trial I Well, my dear young 
 lady, time went on with me, sometimes 
 sunshine, sometimes cloudy; but the 
 widow's friend was always near me ! My 
 Susan was an apprentice to a milliner and 
 mantua-maker. Mr. Webster, my son-in- 
 law, grew wealthy every day ; and acted 
 by me like a child. Frank gave us some 
 sorrow ; he was discontented with living 
 at the farm, and wished to be a sailor. I 
 had suffered enough from water ! and I 
 could not be brought to consent. Be- 
 sides, his brother loved him, and had 
 promised to make a man of him, if he 
 would continue to be diligent and sober;

 Frank secretly left us, and for a. time 
 my sorrows were renewed. At last I

 he had not forgotten his poor mother, 
 nor his gratitude to her benefactress and 
 his own. He was actually groom at the 
 hall under another name, whilst I thought 
 him exposed to the dangers of the sea. 
 The account he gave me of Mrs. How-

 situation, in her father's house, and left as 
 it were to the mercy of the merciless,

 I was not surprised, when 1 saw the

 Miss Flint should want to marry him, for

 discontented one ; and when, in the even-

 she took delight in helping Susan in 
 her work, at which she was not less ex- 
 pert than herself. She never quitted 
 her room, but to go to morning prayers, 
 and sometimes to Mr. Lloyd's ; but these 
 visits were rare. Thus passed three years, 
 and her increasing fondness for Susan

 went again to the attorney's, and again 
 we fancied that she returned home more 
 cheerful. Some few days after she went 
 again, teUing us that we should think her 
 a gossip ; but that she should drink tea 
 at home. We consequently waited some 
 little time for her; but concluding her 
 friends had detained her, were just set 
 down, when she arrived in a sedan chair, 
 and as we thought, in a dying condition.

 she had been seized with a fit in the shop,

 awoke composed. Wc had soon the sa-

 melancholy was more apparent than ever ; 
 and from that time she never left her 
 room.â€” On her sending me one day to

 recovery, I asked her why she would not

 God has created in her a new heart ; and 
 it is not for me to judge her. She wept 
 most grievously ; and from what I could 
 gather, I thought she had been seduced 
 by Mr. Flamall when a young woman, 
 and had thus become subservient to Miss 
 Flint's cruel purposes. She perceived my 
 suspicions, and redoubling her tears, told 
 me that I was quite wide of the mark; 
 for that she had been always too homely 
 for his pleasures, though not so for pur- 
 poses more base and wicked than I sus- 
 pected. * But,' added she, with a look of

 not be the ruin of more of her dear lady's

 always chose that either myself or Susan 
 should be present, and he was struck by 
 her piety and submission. She never got 
 the better of the surprise of meeting with 
 Flamall. The doctor said, she died of a 
 consumption ; but I know it was of a 
 troubled conscience, and a broken heart ; 
 although a penitent one. I was with her

 coffin ! put me in ! put me in, they will 
 not find me thei^e /' said she. Another 
 time, she called on Mr. Philip Flint. 
 * Oh, do not let him hang me!' said 
 she, strugghng and tearing off the cap 
 on her head, * I nursed you ; I was faith- 
 ful to you ; I loved you as the child of 
 my own body ! Poor child ! you could 
 not help it!' 'Help what!' asked I. 
 ' That Mrs. Howard died for want of 
 bread,' answered she. Then followed 
 another struggle for breath. Then she 
 knew me, and said, ' Pray for me, I am 
 dying. All is over with me !' So, I 
 soothed her ; and she pressed my hand, 
 and held it so fast I could not get it 
 from her. Then she whispered so 
 low, I could understand only these 
 words : â€” ' They told me it was * a deed ! 
 In this manner she continued till fiwe. 
 o'clock in the morning. When, poor, 
 poor soul ! she sunk into her last sleep,

 she never could do : at nine her suffer- 
 ings closed. 
 
 " You will not wonder, after this ac- 
 count,'at my opinion of Miss Flint," con- 
 tinued the good woman. ** I am not the 
 only one in this neighbourhood who 
 believes she has no more rio-h t to the wealth 
 she enjoys than I have ; though but few 
 have my reasons for this belief How- 
 ever, what I think I keep to myself, not 
 even Susan knows what I have told you ; 
 M'ho, like an angel, have taken care to re- 
 move from this vile woman a niece whom 
 she hated; for the wicked can never bear 
 the sight of those whom they have de- 
 frauded. God is just. Madam, even in 
 this world. Let Miss Flint try to pur- 
 chase, with her ill-gotten wealth, one sleep 
 like yours, when you close your eyes, 
 thinking of the innocent lamb you have 
 protected ! Poor wretch ! poor wretch !'* 
 added she, shaking her venerable head,

 ** I pity her. But to proceed, you may 
 guess at our surprise, when we found 
 tliat INIrs. Barnes had left to us every 
 shilling she had ; and you may judge 
 of what passed in my mind, when I found 
 she had signed her will that very day on 
 which she so accidentally met Mr. Fla- 
 mall and his nephew. This estate was 
 left me only for my life. Susan had her 
 legacy, in the furniture and clothes. The 
 <lear children are my heirs. They are 
 orphans, Miss Cowley," added she, sink- 
 ing her voice to a whisper, '' poor or- 
 phans ! What could I do in such a strait ! 
 But I often think of the price my poor 
 friend gave for the means of these chil- 
 dren's future bread. How do I know 
 that the wages of sin will prosper even 
 in the hands of the innocent ?" â€” '^ Leave 
 that consideration," replied I, ^' to the 
 Providence Avhich directed its uses to the 
 innocent. Forbear to consider too mi-

 mercy to you, do not forget the con-

 courage me," rephed she, ** to trust every 
 thing that troubles me on this subject to 
 your better reason. I have a paper or 
 two of poor Mrs. Barnes's that do me no 
 good at times. I found them by cliance, 
 and even Susan knows not of them. I 
 do not hke to destroy them, lest it 
 should be improper; and yet I should be 
 sorry to leave them for other's finding, 
 when I am gone. You shall see them." 
 She turned towards a bureau at her hand, 
 and from a private drawer produced the 
 papers. ^* I found them Acre," said she, 
 placing them in my hand ; ** put them in 
 your pocket, and at your leisure read 
 them. Keep them, or destroy them as

 were much depressed from the probabiH- 
 ty of his remaining in Jamaica with his

 Howard's child will be secure of com- 
 fort. I do not wish to see the proverb 
 verified," added she, " which says, * out

 heard any one speak ill of young Mr. 
 FHnt; but there is money enough to 
 make more happy than one ; and whether 
 I am right or wrong in what I think, I

 a time, filled my thoughts. It was finish-

 my whote frame, and an oppression on

 and again I dosed. I was now, in ima-

 coffin, and striving to put aside her 
 mouldering bones, when a voice bade 
 me repent and live. To this appalling 
 admonition succeeded new terrors. I 
 thought I was flying from my habitation, 
 which was falling, from the convulsion 
 of the ground, in a dreadfid earthquake. 
 I sought the hall ; it was levelled to the 
 dust. Mrs. Howard, like an angel bright 
 in glory, stood before it. She turned 
 towards me, and said, * Behold ! and 
 tremble!' I started at the loudness of her 
 voice, and the severity of her counte- 
 nance. The bed trembled under me with 
 my agitations. I dreaded to slumber 
 again. The morning sun rose bright;

 After a safe and speedy passage

 sister had nothing for doubts or fears, I

 better I should not see him. In the 
 mean time, I have succeeded in gaining 
 the good will and entire confidence of

 the good old Oliver Flint. I took an 
 opportunity when he was exulting at the

 her shoe-heels were of the same stuff;

 Margaret's adventure, and your knight-

 a time I respected. You need pot be 
 told my reasons for desiring my brother 
 Philip to visit me. My last surviving- 
 ]K)pe was nearly of his age, and bore the 
 same name. I had lost sight of my 
 family in England ; and for many years 
 had considered this as no misfortune, 
 having been led to conclude that the 
 conduct of some amongst them, had 
 proclaimed their unworthiness. JM}^ sis- 
 ter Lucretia was the only one of my 
 fathers children with Avhom I had any 
 intercourse by letter, and she constantly 
 mentioned this posthumous child with 
 tenderness and promising hopes. Her 
 adoption of him pleased me, even be- 
 fore I was childless myself; and as it 
 Avas obvious she had an influence wnth 
 }}is mother, I wrote to her, stating my 
 wishes and intentions in this boy's fa- 
 vour. Her answer was satisfactory ; but 
 I was informed that Philip had an uncle, 
 who claimed, his rights in a cliild who

 from his cradle had been his care and 
 comfort ; and that he intended to share 
 with his nephew the hazards of the voy- 
 age, and the pleasure of seeing me; and 
 in this arrangeu.ent his mother had con- 
 curred. They arrived ; and I soon show- 
 ed Mr. Flam all that I was satisfied with 
 my heir. He, on his part, convincing 
 me by his conduct, of the part he had 
 taken in formino; him for a worth v one. 
 My friend Mr. Cowley, the father of the 
 young lady for whom you are interested, 
 was not less pleased with tliis serpent in 
 disguise, than myself; and indeed, I 
 know of none to whom his company 
 was not acceptable. He \Vas, or affected 
 to be, charmed with his situation, and 
 from certain hints and well-timed dis- 
 plays of his capacity for business, my 
 friend made him very advantageous of- 
 fers of employing him in the regulation 
 of his accounts. He accepted them, and 
 from that time resided (with Mr. Cowley,

 who became attached to him more and 
 more. About this period my poor friend 
 received his daughter's picture from 
 England ; and I was summoned to cele- 
 brate its arrival with others of his ac- 
 quaintance. Curious to see the change 
 which time had produced, on an infant 
 I had carried in my arms many and many 
 a time, I went at an early hour, and 
 found poor Cowley fondly surveying it. 
 I was struck by the beauty of the image 
 before me; but it had recalled to poor 
 Henry his lost wife, and he yielded with- 
 out restraint to his tender regrets. I 
 endeavoured to soothe him, and amongst 
 other things said, that his girl pleased 
 me, though she had his saucy eyes, add- 
 ing, ' Suppose, Henry, we make up a 
 match between us ? My boy is as hand- 
 some as your girl ; and he will have 
 reason to be satisfied, if she is only half 
 as good and as beautiful as her mother 
 was.' *She has my saucy eyes, you say/

 replied he, fixing his own on the picture; 
 * if she liave my spirit also, she will 
 wish to chiise a husband for herself; 
 and I am very certain, she is well quali- 
 fied to chuse wisely.' He continued to 
 expatiate to Mr. Flamall, on her good 
 fortune in having been brought up by 
 Mrs, Hardcastky and with much satis- 
 faction continued to enumerate his daugh- 
 ter's various attainments, and the proofs 
 he had in his letters from her, of good 
 sense and discernment. This merely ac- 
 cidental conversation produced on Fla- 
 mall's mind the first suggestions of his 
 ambition ; I have no doubt of this ; for 
 he frequently mentioned to me the ad- 
 vantages which would result from an 
 alliance with my old friend ; and withal 
 intimated, that he was certain that Philip 
 was a favourite with Mr. Cowley. More- 
 over, he frequently joked with us on the 
 subject, and advised Cowley to send for 
 his daughter. I had, however, by this

 time seen enough of my youngster, to 
 suspect that he was in love elsewhere. I 
 ohserved, that whenever Miss Cowley's 
 picture was the theme of praise, Philip 
 paid his tribute of admiration as much , 
 to the drapery as tht face; and that with 
 the young ladies, he was more pensive, 
 than with their mothers. But hourly, 
 my dear Sir, did he gain upon my heart ; 
 for in every thouglit, word, and. f^ee(\, 
 he brought to my remembrance my own

 seeing Mr. Cowley seized with his first 
 apoplectic fit at my table. He recovered 
 from this attack; but he was a changed 
 man. He was not insensible of his dimi- 
 nished strength; and his conversations 
 frequently turned on his settling his 
 worldly affairs, before he left me. On

 evil as themselves. I have appointed them

 be a security for my honour, when I am

 you for my substitute in duty. Tell me,

 my appointed executor, and the destined

 well managed the talents given me.' This 
 conversation finished by his repeatedly 
 thanking me for the comfort I had given 
 to his dejected spirits ; and some short 
 time after, he told me that he had finish- 
 ed his most important concerns ; and 
 should, whenever he embarked, leave 
 Marian and her little ones under my 
 roof; which promise had reconciled her 
 to his voyage. 
 
 The second shock to his enfeebled 
 frame left us little for hope. Yet he 
 again rallied; but with the loss of all 
 power in his legs, and with a general de- 
 bility, that rendered every exertion fa- 
 tiguing. He did not quit his apartment, 
 and rarely his bed, for much time toge- 
 ther. His faculties were notwithstand- 
 ing less oppressed, than after his first 
 attack ; for he was more cheerful and 
 equal in his spirits. During this term 
 of his trial, how often have I heard him

 bless me for being the agent in the hands 
 of Providence, in conducting to him 
 Mr. Flamall, who so ably went through 
 the business he was no longer in a con- 
 dition to superintend, and whose society 
 was a comfort to him ! To say the truth, 
 I was no less pleased with his conduct 
 than my friend ; ' for this fellow's talents 
 are up to every thing but honesty ,' 
 
 One morning I went as usual to Cow- 
 ley's; he was still in his bed, and the sun- 
 blinds were down in the bow- windows of 
 his spacious apartment. I stumbled on 
 entering, from the sudden transition from 
 light to darkness, against some moveable; 
 and with the utmost cheerfulness, my 
 friend said, ^VvHiy, how now, Oliver! 
 you are one of those * who love dark- 
 ness rather than light because your deeds 
 are evil ;' therefore take care of your 
 shins.' Rubbing the one offended, I 
 approached the bed, and then only per-

 his station near it to receive me. ' You 
 are busy," observed I, thinking he was, 
 adding a codicil to his will, for such the 
 lessening obscurity discovered the parch- 
 ment to be. â€” ' I will call this evening.' 
 â€” * I had finished, my dear Oliver,' replied 
 he, grasping my hand. ' We have wish- 
 ed for your appearance ; I have only to 
 sign and seal.' He rung the bell and de- 
 sired the servant to show the gentlemen 
 into the room. His physician, with one 
 of the most respectable men at Kingston, 
 entered. â€” I retreated to the bow, and 
 passing the blind, stood in the balcony. 
 I heard him say something as an excuse 
 for having so long detained them ; and 
 he added, * I have been hearing Mr. 
 Flamall read my will once more. I now, 
 in a sound mind, declare it to be last

 business was performed with all due for- 
 malities; and his faithful Juba, to whom 
 he had given good learning when he was 
 in England, witnessed this act of his be- 
 loved master with such emotions, that he 
 left the room the moment he had written 
 his name. Mr. Flam all asked him where 
 he should deposit the will ; and Cowley 
 answered, * in tlie cabinet.' The gen- 
 tlemen saw him place it in the cabinet, 
 which stood opposite to the foot of the 
 bed, and Cowley received the key, which 
 was attached to the chain of his watch. 
 He now called me from my post, and for 
 some time chatted with us At length 
 the gentlemen departed ; and Juba, re- 
 covered from his grief, entered with some 
 refreshment for his master. * Try and 
 get off this key/ said Cowley to him, 
 giving him the watch. He did so with- 
 out difficulty. 'There, my dear OHver,' 
 said my friend, giving it me, ' you will

 had like to have forgotten ; you will

 sent them to her long since, but that I 
 could not bear to see them. There is a 
 pearl necklace amongst them ; her mo-

 His voice sunk, and he burst into tears. 
 * Come, come,' said I, *my dear fellow- 
 sufferer, let us have no more of this ; get 
 well, and carry your daughter this neck- 
 lace yourself. You will find, when plac- 
 ing it on her neck as a bride, that God 
 has many comforts for you yet in store.' 
 He shook his head. â€” * I trust he has,' 
 replied he, * but they are not in this

 with the visitors, returned, and my friend

 the contents of the will, when called upon 
 to produce it. Mr. Flamall acted his part 
 to the life, but with me his villany stood 
 confessed ! I need not tell you his power 
 over poor Miss Cowley, nor Philip's sur- 
 prise that he was involved in her fate. 
 His spirits, which had visibly declined 
 from the time he had been with me, be- 
 came totally dejected, arid he passed his 
 time here in solitude. I was>certain he 
 had the same suspicions with myself; 
 and, although it went to my heart to vex 
 him, I determined to open my mind to 
 him : I did so by relating to him all I 
 have told you ; and I added, that if he 
 preferred going to England, I would go 
 witJi him and leave Tlamall * to the 
 devil's care.' â€” ' I have no wish to return 
 to England,' answered he with emotion 
 * I wish to die here, and would this hour 
 resign my breath willingly were it not 
 for you!' The po^r boy clung to my

 I, ' we now understand one another. I 
 would sooner see you dead than Miss 
 Cowley's husband : but you may be her 
 friend; we also zvill ty^y to be cu7mmg. 
 Flam all is your uncle ; so much the worse 
 for you, and the better for him, accord-

 will leave him to an arm which will, in 
 its own time, reach him to his cost. Show 
 some alacrity in the post your uncle has 
 assigned you, and be vigilant over etc- 
 counts which relate to the heiress he has 
 gained for you. Inventories will not be 
 marriage articles, Philip, but they may 
 be evidences of Avhat I^Iiss Cowley is

 Miss Cowley, but complained bitterly 
 that his uncle persecuted him daily on 
 the subject of the marriage, and highly 
 resented his reluctance to the voyage to 
 England. About this time the partner 
 of an old and respectable house of cor- 
 respondence I had in London, arrived 
 here. He met Flam all at my table, for I 
 was a cunning man you will observe, and 
 preserved appearances on many accounts. 
 The stranger, before he quitted me, asked 
 me how long I had known Flamall. I 
 ansv.'cred; adding that he was nearly 
 related to my brother Philip. ' I should 
 be sorry for the young gentleman,' re- 
 plied he, ' were I not assured that I 
 must have heard a false representation of 
 Mr. Flamall's conduct in England.' I 
 urged him to explain himself; he evaded 
 for a time my enquiries, saying that he 
 had only common report to produce as 
 an apology for W07ide7'ing at seeing 
 Flamall in good company^ and in an

 honourable station of trust ; bat," added 
 he, *' I am safe with you ; I have heai'd 
 that he writes too well, therefore take 
 care of him, my good old friend." I 
 smiled and shook his hand : we under- 
 stood each other. Well! I am making 
 this a long story ! but now for the con- 
 clusion. One evening Philip returned 
 from Kingston so ill that I thought he 
 was dying. I say nothing of what passed 
 in my mind. Here was my last hope 
 within sight of the grave ! He grew 
 better, however, towards the morning, and 
 the doctor told me his disorder was not 
 the cruel fever which had made me 
 childless. Philip was moved to see my 
 distress, and he at once told me that he 
 did not deserve my love and goodness, for 
 that he had been afraid to trust me. He 
 then told me all about his marriage 
 with that poor little girl of ours, and the 
 
 roguery which that d d Flamall had 
 
 practised to make him believe she was a

 faithless bagg-age. He had met Miss 
 Lindsey by chance at his friend Dahym- 
 ple's, where he had persuaded Flamall to 
 place the two little Cowleys and their 
 mother ; and, as you may suppose, poor 
 Margaret's innocence was cleared up. It 
 was well Flamall was then beyond my 
 reach ! He was at the large plantation, 
 twenty miles from hence ; so instead of 
 shooting him through the head I em- 
 ployed my time in getting my poor boy 
 well ; and a contented mind hastened his 
 cure. I shall never forget what passed in 
 my mind when this affectionate, and very 
 anxious uncle came on the wings of the 
 wind to see his ** dear Philip !" I met 
 him, however, with my cunning face in 
 the hall, and told him the patient was 
 doing well, for he was asleep; and he 
 followed me into the eating room. A 
 thousand questions ensued, which were 
 all answered by assuring him that he 
 was in the road to better health than he

 I, gaily, '' he will do very well here when

 on you if you please, and introduce to 
 you Mrs. Lindsey, who wishes to send a

 ther shall not see you to-day." 
 
 He followed me, without uttering a 
 word, and, mounting his horse, left the 
 house. Poor Philip, who is the most af- 
 fectionate of creatures, was vexed when 
 I told him of this visit. lie wrote to his 
 uncle, who sent back the letter, and

 now at the other, and lives hke an angry

 he, rising to meet him and Lindsey. 
 ** Be sure to advise him not to regard 
 this fellow's stubborn pride; he has been 
 too humble with him, in my opinion, but 
 his mother's peace is always uppermost, 
 and I cannot bear to see him uneasv, so 
 I never name Flamall." 
 
 Thus far, my dear Sir, you have seen 
 Mr. Flamall as tht guardian j the friend^ 
 and the relative. I leav^ to you to 
 draw your own conclusions ;' but as the 
 detention of the vessel permits me, I 
 will continue my history by informing 
 you that they have amongst them made

 of Henry Sinclair.

 she saw me look serious. Our party, the 
 following day, was augmented by two fa-

 ceremonious intrusion. I was in no hu- 
 mour for such company, and, pleading 
 a head-ach, I kept close in my own apart- 
 ment. Thus retired, I had just finished 
 my solitary di,nner when Lindsey entered 
 the room; and, sitting down, commended 
 myprudence and good fortune in escaping 
 the people who were yet in the house. '' I 
 can do no more for Philip," added he, 
 yawning, *^and it may do him good if they 
 teach him that nohappiness here isperma- 
 ent." I made no reply. '^ I find,'' continued 
 Lindsey, *' it is exactly as my wife had 
 foreseen, you have taken ofltence, and 
 Philip's caution is misconstrued. I M^ill 
 follow her counsels, for I have never had 
 reason yet to repent of so doing. Listen 
 to me, and then be angry if you please. 
 During your brother's voyage hither his 
 uncle informed him that he had long- 
 known of his intrigue with Miss l^lxiclaira

 ner kept his secret, and listened in pa- 
 tience. One letter from Miss Sinclair, 
 enclosed in one from Montrose, reached 
 poor Philip soon after his arrival here ; 
 and the reception he met with from his 
 brother cheered his drooping spirits. At 
 length his intelligence from Scotland 
 failed ; and his uncle gave him seriously 
 to understand that Mr. Cowley wished 
 to secure him for a husband for his 
 daughter. PhiHp endeavoured to laugh 
 at his uncle's having taken up a few 
 random jokes as a premeditated design,, 
 but this evasion failing, he firmly told 
 him that his aifections were engaged, 
 and that his honour, without other mo- 
 tives, would oblige him to refuse even 
 Miss Cowley's offered hand. " I would 
 have spared you, Sir,'' rephed Mr. Flamall, 
 with sternness, '' the pain of blushing be- 
 fore a man whose authority you have of 
 late cast oif, although from the hour of 
 your birth he has lived for the purpose

 of making you a reasonable being. I had 
 hoped to have seen you long since re- 
 claimed from the weakness and infatua- 
 tion of a boy deluded by his vanity and 
 passions ; but I see you require harsher 
 remedies than mine since you have found 
 your path to fortune smooth. Read that 
 letter, and then judge of the nature Â®f 
 those engagements which your delicate 
 honour opposes to a situation the most 
 enviable." He threw a letter on the table, 
 and abruptly left the room. Philip found 
 that it was one from his college tutor, 
 Doctor Macleod, to his uncle; and, 
 from its contents, it appeared that the 
 discovery of his attachment to your sister 
 had been made hy him to Mr. Flamall ; 
 for, after his approbation of the measures 
 which Mr. Flamall had pursued of re- 
 moving the lover from so dangerous a 
 predicament, he proceeds in detailing the 
 conduct of the deserted fiir one.

 Doctor, *' soon supplied Mr. Flint's ab- 
 sence by admitting the visits of Â« nexo 
 lover. He was more experienced in the 
 wiles of the sex; of her class at least; and, 
 being an independent man, of considera- 
 ble fortune, she was prevailed upon to 
 quit her mother, and to place herself un- 
 der his protection at his seat near Dublin, 
 without the name of a* wife. I am told 
 that Montrose, her Jir^t lover, shares with 
 her in the generosity of her gallant ; and 
 that he is in Dublin, and supported by 
 this unhappy girl. Mrs. Sinclair has left 
 Edinburgh. Mrs. Montrose did not, at 
 her death, leave sufficient to pay her 
 debts. No wonder : her daughter is 
 somewhere in service : I hope it is an 
 honest one. When your nephew learns 
 these particulars he will be convinced of 
 the danger he has escaped, for he wants 
 not understanding ; nor will his gratitude 
 fail in the acknowledgments due to 
 those who, from their interest in his wel-

 Flamall not to forget that the assumed 
 mask of a Miss Sinclair, and the design- 
 ing friendship of h Montrose, had been 
 the destruction of men much more expe- 
 rienced in life than his nephew, &c. â€” 
 Philip's state of mind, on perusing this 
 letter, was such as I shall not attempt 
 to describe. In the confusion and tu- 
 mult of his thoughts he crushed it in 
 his hand, and putting it into his bosom 
 he left Flamalls house. He wrote to me: 
 no answer was returned. He then wrote 
 to a young man for general information, 
 respecting his old friends, the Montroses 
 and Miss Sinclair, To this letter he liad 
 a reply. It was such as confinned, in 
 part, his tutor's intelligence; for the 
 death of Mrs. Montrose had broken up 
 her Uttle family, and the writer knew 
 not where her son and daughter were.

 reached this place with my wife; 'and 
 my friend, on whom I relied for my 
 present establishment, placed us in the 
 house of our countryman, Mr. Dalrymple,

 his plantation. You may judge that my 
 Fanny had formed her designs in favour 
 of her injured friend, and she was not 
 long without information in regard to 
 Mr. Flint's situation and favour with his 
 rich brother Oliver. She listened to his 
 praises, and the Dalrymples were not 
 sparing of them. His conduct in his 
 visits to the Cowleys and their mother; 
 his friendship to themselves, entered into 
 these details; and, finally, the disap- 
 pointment of certain young ladies who 
 were said to be in love with the hand-

 into her reproaches or Philip's distress, I 
 will finish my narrative by telling you, 
 thatDoctor Macleod's friendly epistle and 
 fatherly advise, was da,ted just sLv months 
 after his death. The result was much 
 happier than my poor wife had reason to 
 expect, for she had nearly been the 
 death of Philip in her indiscreet zeal for 
 friendship. We are all at present' in the 
 right road," continued Lindsey, " and 
 happy; but in our apprehensions of your, 
 warmth ; for Flamall is without import- 
 ance to us."â€” "I must see him," replied 
 I, " were it only to thank him for all his 
 good intentions. It will not, I presume, 
 disturb the peace of the world, if I should 
 improve Mr. Flamairs art of ' writing 
 letters from the dead to the hving,' or

 over my defeat. All I know is, that I was 
 subdued by her tears and pathetic represen- 
 tation of the misery I should introduce, 
 by my noticing this rascal. And so well 
 did she plead the cause of mercy and 
 forbearance, that I do not think I could 
 have shot at a sparrow whilst within hear- 
 ing of her voice. " Promise me," said 
 the syren, '* promise me, Mr. Sinclair,

 uncle's deviations from honour and in-

 has been vigilantly employed for liis be-

 Mrs. Dormer, my fair enslaver, keeps a 
 watchful eye over me, and what with 
 balls, feasts, and her smiles, I am a lost 
 man, though yet a steady friend ; and 
 if you give the word of command I will 
 kidnap Flamall, and send him to you 
 for the recompence of his deserts. 
 Yours, most faithfully, 
 
 Henry Sinclair. 
 P. .5. I have not room for my sisters 
 prayers for Mr. Hardcastle's and Miss 
 Cowley's felicity.

 Miss Cowley to Miss Hardcastle, 
 
 Wednesday Evening. 
 
 X Know, my dear Lucy, that you will 
 expect the sequel of the disastrous tale 
 contained in my last letter ; and that you 
 will very ingeniously contrive to muster 
 up many conclusive arguments to prove 
 that Rachel Cowley's health will be ab- 
 solutely ruined at Tarefield. Facts are, 
 however, stubborn things. She has 
 passed this trial of her strength without

 a fever on her nerves, notwithstanding 
 a cold which, on Monday and yesterday, 
 gave her a pretence for keeping her apart- 
 ment and nursing the poor baronet. 
 
 On the Monday morning Malcolm 
 gave me to understand, with visible un- 
 easiness, that his father had betaken him- 
 self to the lately deserted room, with the 
 grated windows, and he implored me to 
 endeavour to allure him from it. I wrote 
 a card instantly, informing him I waited 
 breakfast for him, and that I had a new 
 book for his perusal. It succeeded; 
 but I was shocked to see the effects of 
 one night's disturbance of that mind, 
 which we had exultingly seen settling into 
 tranquillity. He was shivering and lan- 
 guid, and told his wife he had taken cold ; 
 but she perceived, as well as myself, that 
 he was dispirited and extremely nervous. 
 Nothing can equal this woman ! To see 
 her at this moment, I could not but love 
 her. She was calm and cheerful ; sooth-

 iiig and tender; whilst in a thousand 
 various ways she diverted his attention ; 
 and although I knew she had watched at 
 ]\Iiss Fhnt's bedside from three o'clock, 
 she did not name her, nor did she ap- 
 pear fatigued. I took my turn to be good, 
 and, dismissing her, said, that as I had 
 also a cold, the valetudinarians would 
 have but one infirmary ; that she might 
 dispose of Mrs. Allen, for we meant to be 
 in the sullens and read. Sir Murdock 
 raised his dejected head ; the eye was ani- 
 mated, and 1 was contented. I took my 
 work and placed before him the Vicar 
 of Wakefield. '* Shall I not read it 
 aloud?" asked he. â€” '* No," replied I, 
 *' unless you find a passage that particu- 
 larly strikes you." He bowed, for Sir 
 Murdock Maclairn is the truly polite 
 man. I soon perceived that his atten- 
 tion was engaged. Whose is not, Lucy, 
 by that work } This made me happy ; yes, 
 happy, I repeat, for I reverence this in-

 teresting man ; and I believe there is a 
 fatal grief which will, whilst he lives, 
 oppress his mind. Mrs. Allen soon 
 joined us; she Avas also the invalid; 
 but it slackened not her industry. She 
 took up your hearth-rug. Her dose of 
 camphor-julap went round, and Gold- 
 smith had too many beauties for the 
 baronet to be long silent. The morning 
 thus glided away, and we dined where 
 we were. Malcolm, with undissembled 
 joy, found us comfortable, and the 
 evening was given to the chess-board. I 
 slept, Lucy, for I had passed the day in 
 blunting the barbed arrow, which, if I 
 am not much mistaken, still wounds 
 SirMurdock. â€” Tuesday was fair ; I want- 
 ed a ride ; the curricle and my knight 
 were in readiness ; and we returned home 
 the better for our long airing. This 
 morning it was Mrs. Allen's turn to wish 
 for a ride, and the good Sir Murdock 
 with alacrity indulged her wish.

 Malcolm and myself, immediately after 
 their departure, took the road to the 
 Abbey. To say the truth, I felt a little 
 fine-ladyish, and walked not with my 
 usual alertness. My good naturcd es- 
 cort, perceived it. " I am astonished/* 
 observed he, slackening his pace, and 
 offering me his arm, " to see your spirits 
 and perseverance ! You are now so fa- 
 tigued, that any other but yourself would 
 fancy this walk improper for you.'' â€” "The 
 sun cheers me," replied I, " and idleness 
 will yield to this bracing air." â€” " Your 
 motives," answered he, *' will always give 
 animation and vigour to your mind ; for 
 it seems to me, that it is the business of 
 your life to communicate joy or con- 
 solation to all around you ! Tell me," 
 continued he, " that your recompence is 
 adequate to your labours. In the absence 
 of your accustomed amusements, remote 
 from friends endeared to you by time and 
 experience, and qualified for that pre*

 fercnce you must feel for them, I see you 
 cheerful, and apparently contented, in a 
 situation marked for the residence of 
 care; but my admiration of your mag- 
 nanimity, Miss Cowley, has not, nor 
 cannot lessen my regrets at seeing you 
 sacrificed to these duties by an usurped 
 authority over your freedom. Tarefield 
 cannot be otherwise than a place of ba- 
 nishment to you." â€” "Spare your com- 
 passion, my good friend,'' answered I, 
 '* till you have my warrant for indulging 
 it I should be ungrateful, as well as 
 childish, were I discontented in your 
 mother's society, I am sensible of the 
 constant attention paid to my comforts 
 by every individual in your family; and 
 I do most sincerely assure you, that I am 
 as happy at Tarefield, as I should be any 
 where, under the peculiar circumstances 
 in which I am at present." â€” '* We might 
 be more worthy of you," replied he with 
 seriousness, " were we not slaves our-

 selves; but, notwithstanding your ge- 
 nerous assertion, I have myself witnessed 
 your surprise and vexation at my mo- 
 ther's submissions to Miss Flint, and at 
 the subordinate station she fills in her 
 own house, for such is at present Tarefield- 
 hall. It cannot but appear extraordinary 
 to you, to see two women so diametri- 
 cally opposite in character and temper 
 as my mother and this woman, so con- 
 nected, that neither the capricious ex- 
 actions on the one part, nor the decided . 
 love of praise and independence on the 
 other, can Aveaken the ties which have 
 united them. It is by no means a solu- 
 tion of this enigma with me, to be re- 
 minded, that my mother submits to this 
 galling yoke from the consideration of 
 her son Philip's interest. I know she is 
 neither sordid nor designing ; and that 
 she would prefer poverty, were she at 
 liberty to chuse, rather than invade on 
 the least of my father's wishes, much less

 his happiness ; yet she is well aware, that 
 for years Tarefield has been irksome to 
 him. Sometimes I think," continued 
 Malcolm, *^ that my mother conceives 
 herself bound to the fulfilment of a pro- 
 mise made to her first husband, to remain 
 for her life with his favourite daughter. 
 Mr. Flint might, without any miraculous 
 powers, have foreseen that neither his 
 wealth nor Lucretias qualities, could se- 
 cure her, ifdestitue of a friend like my 
 mother, who has incessantly laboured to 
 lumianize her. But I am persuaded, that 
 if such a promise had paused her lips, she 
 would have thought it sacred ; and yet 
 she was once on the point of breaking her 
 chains." â€” Malcolm paused, as expecting 
 my answer. *'I have been told," ob- 
 served I, "that Miss Flint once loved 
 your uncle; may not this circumstance 
 have had its weight with Lady Maclairn?" 
 *' It has not been overlooked by me,'* 
 answered Malcolm; ** but if there eve

 did exist a mutaal passion between Fla- 
 mall and Miss Flint, it was worn out be- 
 fore I could discover it, or rather con- 
 verted into mutual hatred; except on ono 
 point of agreemeut, that of favouring 
 their idol Philip, and tormenting jne. 
 Their marked partiality was one means 
 employed to render my mother miserable; 
 and as for myself, I can with truth affirm 
 that my infant enjoyments, my youthful 
 pleasures, and I might add, the best af- 
 fections of my nature, were contracted 
 and checked by the influence of Mr- 
 Flamall and the jealousy of Miss Flint. 
 It is the peculiar privilege of my cun- 
 ning uncle, Miss Cowley, to eifect his 
 purposes by exciting fear ; and, extra- 
 ordinary as it may appear to you, he had 
 not only established its empire over my 
 meek mother, but also, over the tir- 
 magant Miss Flint. She was taught by 
 him, to consider me, even when in my 
 cradle, as an intruder on Philip's rights. 
 


## p. 12 (#16) ##############################################

1*2 LADY MACLAIRN, 
 
 She regarded my mother's attachment to 
 me as unjust, and defrauding that child 
 of its exclusive claims to love. My mother 
 suckled me herself; her health had not 
 admitted of this duty when Philip was 
 born; and from this advantage, I con- 
 ceive, resulted her apprehensions, that 
 my dear mother loved me better than she 
 did my brother. How little was this 
 woman qualified to judge of lady Mac- 
 lairn !" continued Malcolm with emo- 
 tion. ^'Her wisdom alone counteracted the 
 pernicious effects of these prejudices, 
 longer than could have been expected. 
 Philip was my senior by nearly two years: 
 he was a sweet-tempered child, and, di- 
 rected by his mother, constantly disposed 
 to play with me; but I was a sturdy, 
 active boy, and soon equal to Philip in 
 strength and stature. His compliances 
 with my wishes were checked by his 
 uncle and aunt, as being improper, and 
 leading him into mischief. My daring

 spirit was called an insolent one, and my 
 careless indifference to favour, was stiled 
 obduracy and stubbornness. Secure of my 
 mother's protection, and contented with 
 my own pursuits, I continued to live 
 with Philip on good terms, till I saw 
 preparations going forward for his being 
 placed at Harrow school. Conscious that 
 I had abilities for learning, I felt mor- 
 tified, that no plan for my improvement 
 had been thought of; and I saw Philip 
 depart with emotions not remote from 
 envy. 
 
 " From that hour, I felt ill-will towards 
 my unoffending brother, and was sti- 
 mulated by a proud sense of injustice, to 
 shun his kindness, and to refuse his good 
 offices. At this junction, I found a 
 welcome at Mr. Wilson's house, and a 
 companion and friend in Henry Heartley. 
 Mr. Flamall and Miss Flint were displeased 
 with the frequency of my visits. I was 
 lectured by my uncle, and sternly ad-

 monlsliecl not to go to the Abbey. ' My 
 mother approves of my going there,* 
 rephed I, * and as I am not sent to school 
 hke my brother, it is my business to get 
 learning where I can find it/ * And Avho 
 prevents your mother sending you to 
 school?' replied he with a sneer: 'some 
 of your Scotch relations would find and 
 instruct you for ten pounds a year, and 
 get money by you.' VThey could not for 
 any sum,' answered I, * give me the 
 lessons I receive from you: for, if like my 
 father, they must be gentlemen and ho- 
 nourable men,' His rage was exhausted 
 by the usual epithets, I was * an insolent 
 puppy, a stubborn dog,' and my pride 
 was that of beggary. I may have merited 
 som^ of this censure; for certain it is that 
 not even my mother could prevail upon 
 me to bend to my supercilious uncle, or 
 to pay my court to Miss Lucretia, even 
 when she relaxed into good humour. I 
 carefully shunned her, and was silent in

 her presence. ]\Iy father's unhappy ma- 
 lady quickened my sensibiUty, and gave 
 poignancy to the reflections which were 
 forced upon me. Flamall's tone of au- 
 thority cut me to the soul ; and his want 
 of tenderness to my wretched mother, 
 produced in my mind a rooted an aver- 
 sion to this man, which I can neither con- 
 quer, nor do I wish to conquer it. *0h Miss 
 Cowley 1" continued he, " it is impossi- 
 ble for me to say what my mother's suf- 
 ferings have been ! Unsupported, she 
 watched over her husband with unremit- 
 ting care, patience, and love ! She has 
 been his saving angel i And when dis- 
 ease and despair triumphed over their 
 victim, her soothings and her faithfulness, 
 were the healing balm that lulled him to 
 repose. 
 
 " One day, shortly after Philip's re- 
 moval to the university at Edinburgh, 
 whither he was sent to finish his studies, 
 


## p. 16 (#20) ##############################################

16 LADY MACLAIRN, 
 
 I found my mother in the garden iii an 
 agony of tears ; and on my urging her to 
 tell me what had so affected her, she 
 informed me, that Mr. Flamall had been 
 talking to her of the absolute necessity 
 of placing my father in a private mad- 
 house near Durham ; insisting upon it, 
 that her indulgence was pernicious and 
 would render him incurable. M have 
 told Lucretia,' added she, ' that I wish 
 to be any where, rather than be a burden 
 to her, or further ex posed to my brother's 
 unfeeling advice in a business with which 
 he has nothing to do. She has gene- f 
 rously resented this conduct of your 
 uncle's, and they have had a very serious 
 quarrel ; but it will be settled, as most 
 are, at my expence !'â€” * But is there no 
 place of refuge for us,' asked I with re- 
 sentment, ' but a mad-house ? Even that 
 or a gaol would be a paradise to me, 
 could we call our cell our own. Let us 
 leave this house; my industry'- She

 prevented my proceeding, by saying with 
 solemnity, ' / cannot^ Malcohn P Miss 
 Flint is not weary of me ; and she only 
 can break the chains that keep me under 
 this roof. Your father has comforts 
 here. She wishes him to have an asylum 
 in her house. You know not this wo- 
 man ; I do : and I know also, that my 
 brother is jealous of her affection for me. 
 To this meanness, I attribute the barba- 
 rity of his advice this morning, and the 
 inhumanity with which he urged^^me to 
 remove the ' manaic'' where he would be

 ance with Mr. Flamall, still more discon- 
 certed me. She asked me what was the 
 matter, and whether my mother was ill. 
 * I understand, Madam,' answered I, 
 ' that Mr. Flamall's project had been 
 communicated to you, as well as it is 
 now to me. But,' added I, fixing my 
 indignant eyes on the stately gentleman,

 convinced her, that a more equitable 
 judgment and skill than any here, must 
 pronounce my father a lunatic, before 
 even his wife has the right of confining 
 him to a mad-house. Sir Murdock Mac- 
 lairn needs neither a cell nor the strait 
 waistcoat.' My uncle aimed a blow at 
 my head with a stout cudgel he had in 
 his hand, by way of reply to my obser- 
 vation ; and the first and only favour I 
 have to acknowledge to Miss Flint, was 
 probably, saving me from a fractured 
 skull, for the weapon was heavy and 
 knobbed. She not only warded off the 
 stroke/ but with amazing strength held 
 his arms. I smiled with contempt at his 
 fury. * Your mode of attack,' said I 
 with cool scorn, ' is consistent with 
 yourself; but remember I am Maclairri's 
 son for the future, and that I am not 
 enfeebled by sickness, nor mad. I fear 
 you not ; for I despise you.' My poor 
 mother franticly implored me to retire : 
 I was deaf to her intreaties. Miss Flint's

 rhetoric and amazonian power prevailed. 
 She dragged Mr. Flamall from the spot, 
 foaming with rage, and bestowing his 
 maledictions, instead of his cudgel^ on 
 my head. From that hour we never ex- 
 changed a word, beyond the few which 
 were necessary at our meals. 
 
 ** I have reason to believe that Miss Flint 
 on this occasion was not displeased with 
 the * stubborn dog.' It is certain, that 
 she behaved to me with more civility 
 than ordinary for some time after this 
 proof of my obstinacy: the mad-house 
 was never mentioned from that period. 
 
 ** It may not be improper to account to 
 you. Miss Cowley, for the resentment 
 I felt on the mere proposal of this mea- 
 sure. I did not think my father's intel- 
 lects in a state that required such treat- 
 ment. I knew that his malady had ori- 
 ginated from a dreadful illness, brought 
 on by a sudden stroke of adversity when 
 he was a young man ; to this, was to be

 attributed a peculiarity in his general 
 habits of hfe, and a tincture of sadness, 
 which shaded his character, and repress- 
 ed his activity. But during his long 
 confinement he constantly knew me, 
 and his wife ; and was apparently easy, 
 and even tranquil, when we were by his 
 side, though terror and alarm followed 
 on every intrusion by others ; and an 
 unusual noise, or step, produced silence 
 and dejection on him for hours ; nay, 
 sometimes days. At other times, we had the 
 cheering consolations of hope to support 
 us. He would examine my little draw- 
 ings, sketch with a pencil a more cor- 
 rect outline, check me when playing out 
 of time on my flute, and beat the mea- 
 sure with his hand. When reading to 
 my mother, he would listen, and ob- 
 serve, * I remember something of that 
 passage, read it again.' I did so, and 
 although I perceived the fleeting image 
 had disappeared, yet it confirmed me in 
 my hopes that time would restore my

 father. Under this conviction you may 
 judge that I was not disposed to hsten 
 with patience to the opinion and brother- 
 ly counsel of Flamall, who had by a 
 thousand indications, shewn me that my 
 father's fate was perfectly indifferent to 
 him, 
 
 *' Engaged in my duty to my parents, 
 and considering from day to day, that 
 young as I was, my mother had no pro- 
 tector but myself, I refused to accept of 
 her proposal of going to the free-school 
 at Durham. She was vexed by my re- 
 sistance; and in the fulness of my heart, 
 I mentioned my difficulty to Captaia 
 Flint. He had been very useful to me, 
 from the first of my intimacy with Henry 
 Heartley, whom he educated : but from 
 this time, he wrote to my mother, and 
 undertook my defence, engaging to be 
 my preceptor. If I have not profited 
 by his talents, it is my own fault; but 
 I have gained from him one lesson, and

 " My brother's recall from Edinburgh 
 was, in the course of events, the next 
 occurrence of importance to me. This 
 summons was in consequence of Mr. 
 Oliver Flint's earnest wish to see his 
 young brother. Death had bereaved him 
 of his two last surviving children, boys, 
 nearly of Phihp's age; and to this invita- 
 tion to my brother, were added promises 
 of receidng him as his heir. Mr. Fla- 
 mall's opinion had weight with my mo- 
 ther, for it included his resolution of 
 going with his nephew to Jamaica, the 
 better to understand, and to secure to 
 him the advantages held out. Miss Flint 
 calculated her brother Oliver's age and 
 fortune, and recalled to her memory the 
 extensive and beautiful plantation on 
 which she had first seen the light. Ava- 
 rice combated with fondness; and she

 yielded, trusting to Mr. Flamall's care, 
 and the declining state of health of this 
 poor afflicted father, for her idol's return 
 to England. Phihp arrived at Tarefield 
 from the university ; I had not seen him 
 for a year and a half; and I was struck 
 by the improvement of his person. *He 
 was always handsome/ added Malcolm 
 smiling; * but the Adonis had given 
 place to more masculine comeliness ; and 
 his deportment was become serious, and 
 rather reserved. We had mutually at- 
 tained to those years which precluded 
 rudeness, and I was treated as a gentle- 
 man, and I hope I shewed him that I 
 was one ; yet I saw Philip's advances to 
 more familiarity like * a stubborn dog/ 
 for my heart receded from his civilities. 
 
 *' One morning I met my brother in the 
 avenue, in my way from the Abbey. He 
 appeared to be lost in thought, and I 
 fancied he was weeping. On perceiving 
 me, he assumed a gay air, and asked me

 where I had been rambling. ' I have 
 been no where,' answered I, ' but with 
 my friends at Wilson's.' â€” ' Am I never, 
 Malcolm,' said he >vith emotion, * to 
 have the comfort of finding my name in 
 that list? Shall I never hear the voice of 
 affection from a brother whom I love, 
 and who is only unjust to me? Let me 
 at least,' added he, offering me his hand, 
 * have this consolation before I leave 
 England. I need it !' I did not refuse 
 it, Madam, but my heart smote me; for 
 I received his offered love ungraciously. 
 *Isee,' said he, his fine face glowing, 
 and his voice trembling, ' that I have 
 no brother ! Malcolm Maclairn is lost to 
 me !' He turned away abruptly, whilst 
 conscience-struck, I cursed those Avhose 
 folly and injustice had rendered me cal- 
 lous to the pleadings of nature. I was 
 ashamed of my conduct ; and lest I 
 should afflict my mother, forbore to 
 mention this incident. From that hour

 I shunned Philip's eyes; for I felt his 
 superiority of temper a reproach; and 
 his increasing sadness became an intole- 
 rable weight on my spirits. Miss Flint's 
 dejection at this time appeared to have 
 changed her nature ; my mother's firm- 
 ness seemed to have the direction of her 
 will; and her fondness for * Harriot' 
 rose in proportion as the hour approach- 
 ed, when she was to lose sight of her 
 Philip. On the morning of Philip's de-

 with him, at a very early hour, in Miss 
 Flint's apartment. Mr. Flamall vainly 
 tried to render the repast cheerful. The

 tion, ' One embrace,' said he, * ex- 
 tending his arms and turning towards 
 me, * one embrace, Malcolm ! It may be 
 a brother's last request!, Let me depart

 bosom with energy. ' We are united!' 
 cried I; * no distance or time shall sepa- 
 rate us ! on earth or in heaven we will 
 be brothers !' Mr. Flamall remarked, that 
 I had ill chosen my time for pathetics, 
 and gravely reminded Philip to behave 
 like a man; but his lessons were useless; 
 for our attention was now called to Miss 
 Flint, who was in hysterics, and my 
 weeping but collected mother urged her 
 son to depart. I have somehow or other 
 slid into a narrative, and I may as well 
 finish my story," continued Malcolm.

 obvious reasons, delivered his commis- 
 sion before Miss Flint, adding, that his

 I should Hke to ride a horse of his. * 'Tis 
 hke my noble boy P exclaimed Miss 
 Flint. She paused, and after a struggle 
 with her feelings, said with some bitter- 
 ness, ' time must shew, how this bro- 
 ther's gift is received.' My heart prompt- 
 ed the reply ; but my mother M^as pre- 
 sent. Freed from Mr. FlamalFs influence, 
 and determined not to invade on the 
 tranquillity which succeeded his absence, 
 I settled into reserve and civility with 
 Miss Lucretia Flint; and perhaps her 
 dislike of me might have settled into mere 
 indifference; but my sin was ever before 
 her ; for I persisted in loving my friends 
 at the Abbey : and in due time she was 
 informed, * that I courted Miss Heart- 
 ley.' My mother, who well knew my 
 attachment to Alice, behaved with firm- 
 ness on this occasion, as she had always 
 done in my behalf. She instantly gave

 understand, that a son who had devoted 
 his whole hfe to his duty as a child, and 
 who was perfectly competent to judge of 
 his own situation in the world, should 
 meet with no controul, beyond that 
 which his own prudence and regai'd to 
 his parents enforced. ^' So," added Mal- 
 colm, smiling, '^ I still go a courting, in 
 spite of Miss Lucretia. But this late 
 disturbance had roused my angry pas- 
 sions ; and I was serious with my mother. 
 Last night I told her with frankness, that 
 I would carry a musket for my bread, 
 rather than live in an abode in which my 
 father's peace was interrupted, and in 
 which she was a passive slave. â€” " And 
 what was her answer?" asked I. " Tears," 
 replied he, " tears, which when I behold, 
 unman me, and which 1 reproach my- 
 self for having caused.' She says. Miss 
 Flint upbraids herself more than I can 
 do ; that she is miserable ; and sums up 
 all, by imploring me to have patience.

 and to spare her on the only subject in 
 which she must contradict and oppose 
 me. * You will, I trust,' added she, * soon 
 have a home of your own : so do I fer- 
 vently hope /shall ; but when I quit this 
 house, Malcolm, it will be for the shelter 
 of my grave.' I was so struck by her 
 manner, that I am determined to press 
 her no farther on the subject, if I can 
 help it. In the mean time, I sometimes 
 think, that my dear mother is secretly 
 governed in this abject submission, from 
 her wish to promote my union with 
 AHce : it may be, Miss Flint has pro- 
 mised her to advance a sum of money 
 for my establishment. Yet, my dear 
 Miss Cowley, never did there exist a 
 more noble and disinterested woman, 
 than Lady Maclairn ! and she well knows 
 that both Miss Heartley and myself 
 would reject Miss Flint's favours with 
 scorn. We have comforts which she 
 cannot invade, nor could we relish any

 see each other without restraint, and by 
 a reciprocal confidence, and solid affec- 
 tion, we mutually soften the delay, 
 which prudence exacts, of a union in 
 which we shall be more completely

 Malcolm had touched a chord in my 
 bosom. ** You are to be envied," said I 
 with eagerness. ** How many are there^ 
 with your honour and fidelity, who 
 have not your consolations ! Alice is a 
 happy creature to some I could name." 
 He pressed my arm to his breast. '' Nei- 
 ther Miss Heartley, nor her Malcolm 
 deserves to be happy," said he, '* if they 
 could be so, knowing you otherwise.' 
 I blushed : '* I know your difficulties," 
 added he, '* if I be condemned for hating 
 with a perfect hatred, I must look to 
 you for my excuses. But I have omitted 
 to tell you, that I wrote to Philip before

 kind letter. To one I wrote him after his 
 arrival in Jamaica, I have had no an- 
 swer. Mr. Flamall is at the bottom of 
 this mischief; and trusting to this con- 
 jecture, I wrote again to my brother, 
 and by this means gave Mr. Flamall a 
 full evidence of being still incorrigible in 
 respect to my duty as his nephezv. But, 
 my dear Miss Cowley, the reign of a 
 Flamall is short ; we sliall see him in a 
 very different point of view, before he 
 quits the stage, or I am much deceived." 
 â€” "And I shall be much disappointed," 
 said I with emotion ; '^and what is more, 
 Mr. Maclairn, it shall not be my fault 
 if he does not repent." The girls now 
 perceiving us, advanced to meet us; and 
 Malcolm forgot his dear uncle. 
 
 What will you say of a mother so 
 beloved, and so extolled as Lady Mac- 
 lairn? She is still an enigma to me. I

 no influence, but what is supported by

 you could keep to the letter of your fa-

 The captain, after our first greetings, 
 the other morning, drew me aside, and 
 with some solemnity thanked me for the 
 " generous" concern I had shewn in fa- 
 vour of his niece. ^' I feel," added he, 
 that my honour demands its acquittal 
 from you : and till you know my mo- 
 tives for resigning up an orphan commit- 
 ted to my care, to the authority and di- 
 rection of Miss Flint, I am certain you 
 must blame me. I am however unequal 
 to the recital of events, which ought to 
 have forewarned me, that hatred and 
 envy were incurable. My error arose 
 from my ignorance of tlieir unbridled 
 power over minds in which they have 
 once taken up their abode. Heaven be

 in that hope," answered I, with serious- 
 ness ; " for already hath he appointed 
 an agent for the purposes of his fatherly 
 goodness : and when I forsake this young 
 and innocent heing, may his bounteous

 a sister," said I smiling ** and you must 
 give me one !" He bowed, and without 
 replying hastily retired. 
 
 Mary, with her muslin wrappers, and 
 still languid complexion, never appeared 
 more amiable: she assumed however 
 more gaiety than she felt ; for I saw with 
 satisfiiction, that she was anxious about 
 her uncle. '^ I will shew you my little 
 chamber," said she in a caressing tone ;

 barely sufficient for himself! I was un- 
 fortunately not fitted for labour, and too 
 young to encounter the M^orld without 
 friends, in any situation. I thought I 
 had reasonable claims on my aunt; and 
 how was it possible for me to conceive 
 that she would be unkind to me, because 
 she had been cruel to my parents?" Her 
 tears flowed unrestrainedly. ** When she 
 proposed taking me," continued the art-

 a burden on my uncle, I felt I loved her; 
 and as she had no longer Mr. Philip to 
 comfort her in her solitude, I hoped to 
 render myself both useful and agreeable

 lot was not harder than that of thou-

 was harsh, and her behaviour discourag- 
 ing, I met with kindness from all be- 
 sides, and was sheltered from evil. Was 
 I not right to submit, and keep my se-

 hither ; and then my uncle would have 
 had me on his hands again, and his dif- 
 ficulties would have been renewed : so I 
 own, I always made the best of every 
 thing, and parried as well as I could 
 Mr. Malcolm's accounts, which often 
 grieved Mrs. Heartley and Alice. My 
 unlucky fainting fit has spoiled all ! and 
 what is worse, again separated Miss Flint 
 from my uncle's favour! He says," whis- 
 pered she, '' that he cannot forgive her : 
 and tills grieves me to the heart ; for my 
 dear mother did forgive her ; and I long 
 to tell my aunt that her brother will for- 
 get this offence." â€” " What could urge 
 her to such an outrage ?" asked I.

 behind us. Mr. Snughead slackened his 
 pace and accosted Mr. Wilson, by say- 
 ing, ' If you be not as happy as the tur- 
 tles I have passed, you seem more g ay ^ Mr. 
 Wilson ;' and he fixed his eyes with 
 curiosity on me. * A man must needs 
 have a bad conscience indeed !' replied 
 Mr. Wilson, with good-humour, *'ifin 
 so fine a night as this, and with such a 
 companion as I have, he were not gay.' 
 â€” ' You say right !' answered Mr. Snug- 
 head, still looking at me; '* you say 
 right,' repeated he, ' quite right,'' laugh- 
 ing loud, and winking his eyes strangely 
 at me ; ' such a companion would make 
 any night di fine night, without the aid 
 of the moon!' â€” ' That is a text, Mr. Par- 
 son," answered Mr. Wilson, angrily,

 lauo'h ; * but you are in good hands, there 
 is a time for all things !' So saying he 
 spurred his horse forwards. I was alarmed, 
 and told jNIr. Wilson I feared he had dis- 
 pleased Mr. Snughead. He said he had got 
 no more than he deserved ; that he was a 
 dirty rascal ; and he believed he was then 
 tipsy. Well, my dread of meeting my 
 aunt put all this out of my head ! You 
 know, my dear Miss Cowley, how for- 
 tunately that business finished. My pa- 
 tience on Monday conquered my aunt's 
 sullenness. On the Tuesday morning Mr. 
 Snughead came to visit her. He staid a 
 long time ; and I, well knowing how he 
 hates Mr. Wilson, became uneasy. At 
 length my aunt entered my chamber, 
 which is, as you know, over her's ; and

 banged the door with such violence as to 
 make that tremble also. ' A fine tale

 claimed she â€¢ * you can laugh and hoy-

 ' No, Madam,' answered I, * I have

 He conceiv^ed, I presume, that it did not 
 become a clergyman ; and, to speak the

 incessant rain without, and the dearth of 
 amusement within, had led me to hope 
 you would have sympathetically felt that 
 I wanted a cordial. I am disappointed, 
 and I have yet to learn where to find 
 your grand and infallible nostrum, ^r/- 
 tience: nay, what is more, I am disposed 
 to think at this moment, that it resembles 
 many other quack medicines, and pro- 
 mises more than it can perform. All con- 
 stitutions are not alike, and I believe 
 this specific, would do me mÂ©re harm 
 than good, from the quantity I should 
 be forced to take in the experiment : so 
 you must be Contented with me, and re- 
 collect, that a fire may burn cheerfully 
 and usefully, although from time to time 
 a coal bounces out, and startles you; 
 you have only to move from the annoy- 
 ance a moment, the transient danger 
 passes, and you may return again in 
 safety to the snug warm corner you had 
 left. I was much disposed last Sunday

 to say with Miss Trotter, '' that fifty fair- 
 weather Sundays were scarcely an equi- 
 valent for two rainy ones." Ours was. 
 dreary : the poor baronet was out of spi- 
 rit, and remarked twice at dinner, that we 
 ^ did not need so large a table for four 
 people. Fie might have added, nor half the 
 dishes for three, for he ate nothing. My 
 harp and Handel's music, did something, 
 but I could not sing hymns and psalms 
 forever. We therefore each took up a 
 book. Lady Maclairn soon after entered 
 from her visit to her sister. " How is 
 Miss Flint?" asked Mrs. Allen, raisiuir 
 her meek eyes from her bible. *' Much 
 better," answered her ladyship, in a low 
 key. *' She would have dined below to- 
 day, but she was afraid of catching cold." 
 *' I should hope that shame had its share 
 in this discretion," said Sir Murdock with 
 vivacity. â€” *^I am certain it had," replied 
 she, with mildness, " and not only shame, 
 but repentance." â€” There is no resisting

 this woman, Lucy 1 la saying these few 
 words, she disarm ed me, and 1 refrained 
 from saying what would have hurt her, 
 and done the offender no good. But, for 
 the hundreth time, I will not say she is 
 undefinable! no, but she is unfathomable! 
 After tea, she surprised me by her un- 
 wonted gaiety and spirit in conversation; 
 she drew me into arguments and debates 
 with an address nearly equal to your 
 father's, and, between ourselves, seemed 
 to have liis art of angling to perfection; 
 for when she found the poor fish floun- 
 cing with fatigue, she gently set it free, 
 and restored it to the clear stream. 
 Malcolm, like a dutiful son, was with us 
 at supper ; and a dessert of politics, and 
 about manuring sterile land, sent us to 
 bed cheerful, if not gay. 
 
 I passed yesterday at the Abbey. Our 
 commissions were arrived from Durham; 
 and no one was permitted *' to see the fash* 
 ions" till Miss Cowley arrived. She had

 taken the whim of decorating two pup- 
 pets, instead of one ; and she was paid 
 cent, per cent, for her money. The same 
 robes, the same bonnets, cloaks, sashes, 
 shoes, &c. ** And so elegant !" exclaimed 
 Mary. *^ How kind! how considerate is 
 our sister!" â€” "Not exactly so," replied L 
 *'for I forgot to consult Miss Heartley's 
 taste in regard to the ribbands for her 
 hat, and her milHner has sent blue ; but 
 as she is herself the emblem of constancy, 
 she may prefer your favourite colour, 
 Mary: and in that case, what is to be 
 done? You must wear the true blue." 
 ** Just as she pleases," cried she from the 
 looking glass, before which she was fitting 
 her lawful prize ; "only I doubt, whether 
 Mr. Malcolm will not prefer the true 
 blue, and I can do without it." The 
 gratified uncle smiled on her, and said, 
 ** I beheve you, my love." Alice pre- 
 ferred her own colour, and each dis- 
 appeared with their fashions and finery.

56 LADY MACLAlRlJf, 
 
 I have engaged to meet Mary's friends 
 on Sunday; Mr. Greenwood, her god- 
 father, and a doctor Douglas, who an- 
 nually celebrate her birth-day at Mrs. 
 Wilson's table. She will be seventeen on 
 that day. On my leaving her, she fondly 
 kissed my cheek, and whispered, '' Does 
 my sister wish me to be dressed on Sun- 
 day like her happy protegee?'' â€” '' Always 
 as 7?ii/ sister ought to appear," answered I, 
 with emotion: '^ and as she will be enabled 
 to appear ; for the rest, she is to direct her 
 own toilet." '^Then 1 think on my birth- 
 day, it will be proper to wear' '' the 
 
 lilac," cried I gaily, retreating, having 
 exceeded my promised hour of returning 
 home. 
 
 On reaching the hall, I instantly enter- 
 ed the dining-parlour, in order to make 
 my peace with my friends ; but instead 
 of them, I found Miss Fhnt and the Re- 
 verend Mr. Snughead tite-a-tete. I 
 slightly curtseyed, and said I was glad to

 see her below stairs: and was retirino; M'ith 
 all possible speed, when Sir Murdock, with 
 his wife and Mrs. Allen, entered from my 
 apartment. The "truant" was welcomed; 
 and supper serv^ed up immediately. Mal- 
 colm, with head erect, and glowing face, 
 joined us; and our repast was coldly and 
 ceremoniously finished. The servants 
 M^ere no sooner withdrawn, than Mr.Snug- 
 liead pressed Miss Lucretia to drink a 
 glass of Mountain wine. " He was afraid 
 she lived too low." â€” '^ He was sorry to 
 see her so out of spirits." The restrained 
 tears gushed from her eyes. Yes, Lucy, 
 genuine salt tears came from the eyes of 
 this Flint! The miracle I can attest; 
 and you may believe it with the same faith 
 which you give toMoses's striking the rock, 
 and causing the water to flow. I am the 
 veriest fool in nature ; for I found, hke 
 the obdurate Jews, that my heart softened:

 could appear ? 
 
 ^^ I am astonished/' observed Mr. 
 Snughead, looking round him with an 
 air which he thought dignified, and 
 which I pronounced insolent, '* I am 
 grieved, my dear Madam, to see you give 
 so much importance to a circumstance of 
 so little consequence to your character 
 and station ! I always foresaw what 
 would be the result of your generosity in 
 interfering in Miss Howard's concerns: 
 all your 7^eal friends were of my opinion.'* 
 â€” He looked at Lady Maclairn. â€” ''I know 
 you are quick in feeling, and warm in 
 your temper, and that on perceiving your 
 goodness slighted, you must be unhap- 
 py." â€” Malcolm left the room. ^' Pursue 
 your good intentions," continued he, 
 ** allow this niece a trifle for her supj)ort, 
 and leave her to those friends whom she 
 so unhappily prefers to your protection 
 and prudence. She has been taught to

 hate you from her cradle.'' â€” ^' I know it, I 
 know it well!" said she sobbing; ** but 
 I am sorry I struck her; it was wrong; 
 and although she provoked me, I ought 
 not to have done so. Indeed, Miss 
 Cowley, if you knew all, you would pity, 
 as well as blame me. But I see how it is; 
 my forgetfulness of myself has confirm- 
 ed in your mind all that my enemies 
 have said to my prejudice. Mary has 
 her revenge, and the Heartleys their 
 triumph !" â€” *' I am sorry. Madam," said 
 I, '* to be called lipon in a question of 
 this kind ; but qualified as I am to sup- 
 port the innocent, it behoves me to en- 
 deavour at least to rectify your opinions. 
 Miss Howard, whatever were her discon- 
 tents under this roof, kept them from her 
 friends at the Abbey. She never has di- 
 rectly, nor indirectly, discovered them to 
 me since I have been here. She is at this 
 hour more concerned by the discovery 
 of your harsh treatment, than for the

 loss of your favciur. She speaks of you 
 with respect, nay more, with tenderness 
 and sorrow. She dwells with eagerness 
 on the concessions which you generously 
 made; and attributes your warmth of re- 
 sentment, to your misconception of the 
 supposed offence. Mrs. Heartley sup- 
 ports her. Madam, in this moderation, 
 and labours to convince Mr. Flint that 
 lie has taken up this n^atter too painfully. 
 Mary Howard cannot balance m.any fa- 
 vours with one offence. She is aff'ecti- 
 otiate, placable, and unoffending; her 
 heart is too pure for malice or ill-will; 
 and her principles are too solid to permit 
 her to slander you. To Mrs. Heartley's 
 lessons and example she is principally in. 
 debted for these excellencies ; â€” to nature, 
 for a temper unrivalled in meekness." 
 â€” " You appear," observed the puppy at 
 my left hand, and on whom I had turned 
 my back, " to be as able an advocate for 
 Mrs. Heartley, as for Miss Howard. May

 1 presume to ask you, how long you have 
 known this all-accomplished Lady, to 
 whom Miss Mary is obliged for her sen- 
 timents of love and veneration for her 
 aunt?" â€” *'Mrs. Heartley wants no advo^ 
 cate," replied I, darting upon him my 
 contemptuous eyes. '^ It is sufficient for 
 me to know her; and were other eviden- 
 ces of the excellencies of her character 
 necessary^ I should find them in the soli- 
 citude of my guardian. Counsellor Stead- 
 man, to recommend me to her favour 
 and notice. He has known Mi^s. Heart- 
 ley from a girl; and if you are still curi- 
 ous, Sir, in regard to a person whom you 
 appear to wish to know, I refer you to 
 Mr, Steadman, He will probably satisfy 
 you, that Captain Flint has been singu- 
 larly fortunate in his amours ; and that 
 Mrs. Heartley is a kept mistress of as 
 singular a kind. Are you satisfied, Sir ? 
 or shall I give you any farther indica- 
 tions of Mrs. Heartley's singularities V

 â€” ^'Oh, by all means!" cried he, affecting 
 an aukvvard laugh; '' you are an excellent 
 encomiast." â€” " I can be no otherwise 
 Mdth such a subject for praise," retorted 
 I ; *' but what I most admire in Mrs. 
 Heartley's character, is her contempt of 
 malice, and her compassion for igno- 
 rance: with me, this is the test, not only of 
 her understanding, but of the purity of 
 her life. With a steady hand, Lucy, I 
 took my taper, and calmly w^ishing the 
 company a good night, retired ; the con- 
 founded Mr. Snughead, receiving my last 
 look as he stood erect to let me pass. He 
 observed, when I was departed, that for 
 so ve?y young a lady, I had a "very de- 
 cided spirit; *' and to say the truth," 
 added he, rising and turning to the ba- 
 ronet, '1 am sorry I called out so much 
 of Miss Cowley's Avarmth, on a subject 
 of so little concern to me." Sir Mur- 
 dock coldly bowed. " Miss Cowley 
 must remember," continued he, " my

 having declared that I knew nothing of 
 Mrs. lieartley but from common report. 
 I am surprised, that a lady of her quick- 
 ness, could not see the motives for my 
 conduct there, and also to night." â€” *' So 
 should I be," returned the baronet, " if she 
 did not, for they were pretty obvious ; and 
 Miss Cowley is not often dull in her ob- 
 servations, nor slow in her conclusions. 
 The servant announced the parson's 
 horse, who recommending to Miss Fhnt 
 to think no more of such nonsense^ 
 retreated. 
 
 I will spare you the trouble of writing 
 me an essay on anger. I know all you 
 would say on such a topic, but it would 
 be out of season; for I was not angry, 
 Lucy : I am never angry, but where I 
 could like, and love, were it necessary. 
 You must demonstrate some specific re- 
 medy for antipathies, before I can be

 prompted to send me. Now, collect all

 the antlpatliics in nature, and they will 
 not amount to that which this reptile 
 Mr. Snughead has produced in Rachel 
 Cowley's mind. Perhaps I was too 
 warm ; but what is to be done witli 
 antipathies ? I have no talent at a faint- 
 ing fit; I cannot scream, and look terri- 
 fied when I v>'ant only the strength of a 
 man, in order to grasp a despicable foe. 
 Nature, nature, my Lucy, is my divini- 
 ty ! to her do I owe my aversion of the 
 Snuo-heads' race; and wlien thev do fall 
 in my way, what is to be done? I cannot 
 crush them, as many do a poor harmless 
 spider; but I would probe them to the 
 quick, without flinching. Some vices I 
 can pity, but a spirit of defamation is 
 my abhorrence ; and an unworthy mi- 
 nister of a religion to which I am attach- 
 ed, as my suprenie good, is my antipathy. 
 So I beg you will recollect yours to a 
 toad, and pardon your 
 
 Rachel Cow^ley.

 P. S. I admire Seneca; but what was 
 his age when he turned philos(3p]ier ? In 
 the name of good sense I implore you to 
 ask your father how long a term he gives 
 to infancy. I am now an inf^^mt of 
 twenty years and twelve days, and I am 
 a better philosopher than Seneca. Is it 
 not astonishing that your father does 
 not yet know Rachel Cowley! I pray 
 every day for him, and with patient hope, 
 trust he will one day repent of his crueHy^ 
 and see with his own clear-sighted un- 
 derstanding, instead of the borrowed 
 light of a squint-eyed worldly pru-

 ladies. Sir Murdock was out of the

 the broad stare from the benches, and 
 took our seats in the pew. Soon after en-

 and in their new attire. As they passed 
 to their seat the woman all rose, as if by 
 common consent, and curteseyed to Miss 
 Howard with marked respect. The cap- 
 tain received this compliment with more 
 surprise than gratitude, whilst Mary's 
 cheeks were dyed with blushes. Her

 roughly than the zephyrs of the spring,

 of her person, clad in her unsullied white 
 robes, had however acquired a more ele-

 on the inefficacy of good works with-

 which such an instance of my ohduracy 
 of heart as the one that stared me in the 
 face, would have called from our chris- 
 tian mother. Unable to reach the purity, 
 and I had almost said the divine elo- 
 quence which flowed in her lessons, I 
 endeavoured to recall her often repeated 
 words: " You have, Rachel," would 
 she say, "an erring, but a faithful admo- 
 nitress in your bosom ; you will nev^er 
 act wrong without feeling that you are 
 deviating. Never, for an instant, resist 
 the intimation your conscience will give

 eminence in virtue. You may subvert 
 the intentions of your Maker by an 
 abuse of his gifts, but even in tins hfe 
 you will be miserable by so doing; for 
 you will never be able to stifle the re-

 of the beautiful niece, who preceded her, 
 she overheard one old woman say, '* Aye,

 arm with emotion ; and on reaching the 
 carriage, wept so bitterly that I dreaded 
 lest she should have an hysteric fit: her 
 tears were, however, its preventive ; 
 and when somewhat more con^posed, she 
 requested me to give the servant the 
 order to stop at the Abbey. I an- 
 swered, with the compassion she had 
 excited, that I should not go ; adding, 
 ** Let us extend our ride, the morning is

 also my attempts to divert lier. These 
 succeeded so well, that she dined in the 
 parlour; and on quittino- us to rest tor 
 an hour, asked us to drirdc our tea in 
 her apartment. I pleaded my engage- 
 nient; she coloured, and said, *^Then,

 stick, left the room. Lady Maclairn, who 
 had attended her, returned in a ftw mi-

 to get a nap ; and cheerfully turning to

 answerable for the injustice. **Hc3w so?"

 sed, Sir Murdock ought to visit Captain 
 Flint. He cannot otherwise renew his 
 visits here; and every means should be 
 employed to effect a reconciliation be- 
 tween him and his sister, who appears to 
 me truly concerned for this recent breach 
 between her and her brother: besides 
 these inducements, for a compHment of 
 this sort, I think Sir Murdock owes this 
 advance to himself and you^ as much as

 that, in the present object of her favour, 
 there is both innocence and virtue as

 Memoirs of the Flint Family, 
 
 My father, Mr. Oliver Flint, by a dili- 
 gent and persevering attention, and a 
 constant residence on his estate in Jamai- 
 ca, not only enlarged his property and in- 
 creased his wealth, but also acquired so 
 confirmed a predilection for the ])Iace in 
 which his prosperity had been always 
 flourishing, that he imagined the island 
 of Jamaica to be the most healthy spot in 
 the habitable globe ; and it was a frequent 
 topic of conversation with my mother,

 to prove to her, that the air was sahitary, 
 and that no one died at Jamaica, whom 
 intemperance did not conduct to the 
 grave. My mother was sensible that her 
 health had suffered in this ** terrestrial 
 paradise," and that it was hourly sinking 
 into debility ; but she left to her counte- 
 nance the office of confuting my father's 
 arguments, and suffered in silence. A 
 very dangerous fever with which my fa- 
 ther in his fiftieth year was attacked, in 
 spite of his sobriety and precautions, 
 effected a change in his opinions, and 
 probably preserved to my mother some 
 years of existence in this world. Jamaica 
 was no longer conceived to be without 
 the inconveniences of its tropical situa- 
 tion, and my father hastened his prepa- 
 rations to leave it. 
 
 Our family, at the period we embark- 
 ed for England, consisted of my brother 
 Oliver, my sister Lucretia, and myself, 
 who was the youngest.

 My mother, in her MJsh to return to 
 England, had been governed by motives 
 of advantage to her cliildrcn, as power- 
 fully as by a consideration for her own 
 liealth. The uncontrouied indulgence 
 which m} faiher granted us, bounded 
 his views ; our improvement constituted 
 no part of his cares; and the consequence 
 was, thai: Oliver and Lucretia, to use 
 his own words, had never been ill a day 
 in their lives. I was born less robufct, 
 and was reared with more difficulty. 
 My mother, in her tender cares, kept me 
 in her sight, and my mind was formed 
 to docility, and my sports to more quiet- 
 ness, than suited the vigorous Oliver, 
 and the romp my sister. I thus became 
 my mother's amusement; and to her 
 taste I am indebted for my love of lite- 
 rature and science. Our voyage was 
 pleasant, though tedious, Our accom- 
 modations were easy, for the vessel was

 We settled in London; and a time wiis 
 given to repose and amusements; when, 
 again my mother's cheek faded, and I 
 took the alarm. Her maid-servant told 
 me, as a secret, that we should soon have 
 a nursery and a cradle to provide, and 
 that her master was looking out for a 
 â– country-house, in oj-kr that my mother 
 might be quiet. This plan was effected ; 
 the family removed to a handsome, spa- 
 cious house near Chelsea ; and such was 
 my father's solicitude for the quiet of his 
 wife, that he placed Oliver, then thir- 
 teen, in a commercial academy in the

 and in conformity with the wishes of his 
 Avife, Vvho was not to be contradicted, I 
 was sent to the Charter-house. 
 
 My father, who loved children, and 
 coveted them with as much avidity as 
 he did money, received the promised 
 blessing with transports of joy; and my 
 sister Mary's birth was commen; orated as 
 the renewal of his own life. With fond 
 delight he shewed the infant to his 
 friends, and exultingly pointed out to 
 them the promises of a face which was, 
 indeed, angelic ! She did not disappoint 
 these early presages. As she advanced 
 in age, she exhibited a form and face 
 which perfectly corresponded Mith a 
 temper of unequalled sweetness; and 
 with such graces, it was no wonder she 
 was beloved even to adulation by my 
 father, and the whole Jiouse. 
 
 An artist of some celebrity, and more 
 skill, requested permission to take her

 picture. She was then in her eighth year, 
 and the painter succeeded so happily, 
 that he gained credit by exhibiting his 
 work, and induced my father to have a 
 full-length portrait of my mother, with 
 Mary. This picture was my father's 
 pride ; an engraving was made from it, 
 and scores of prints were sent to Jamaica, 
 in order to convince our friends there, 
 that the elaborate praises they had lieard 
 of this paragon of nature, did not exceed 
 her beauty. 
 
 This instance of my father's fond ad- 
 miration of Ids child, and in which he 
 was countenanced by all who knew her, 
 would not have found a place here, but 
 for the inferences I drew from it. I liad 
 long perceived that Lucretia did not 
 partake with us in the partiality we ma- 
 nifested for the innocent and bewitching 
 Mary. I had seen the envy with which 
 she regarded every proof of kindness and 
 favour shewn to her; the spiteful misre-

 presentations wliicli she gave of her dis- 
 position to strangers; and the contempt 
 she discovered for the weakness of my 
 father's adulation of his darling. During 
 the time she was sitting for her picture, 
 the artist was become a favoured guest at 
 our table; and, with apparent sincerity, he 
 observed one day, that a Guido alone 
 could do justice to Mary's style of beauty. 
 I saw Lucretia colour with vexation; and 
 that very afternoon 1 rescued the poor 
 child from her correcting hands, to whom 
 with some resentment, I said, that I 
 should inform my father and i^other of 
 her severity and violence. *^ Do so !"

 never excuse her faults with me." The

 oifended her, imploring her forgiveness 
 and soUciting to be friends. 
 
 I believe my prudent mother had ob- 
 served the discontents of her eldest 
 daughter as soon as myself; and in order 
 to preserve the peace of the family, she 
 studied to give Lucretia a consequence 
 in it which she judged might satisfy, at 
 least, her love of power. On her leaving 
 school, my mother treated her as a young- 
 woman on whom she depended for as- 
 sistance in the domestic concerns of the 
 family. Oliver and myself were ordered 
 to treat her with deference, and the ser- 
 vants were taught to respect Miss Flint's 
 orders as her own. She continually prais- 
 ed her good qualities, and treated her 
 with the utmost kindness and confidence. 
 But Lucretia exercised her authority ra- 
 ther too much like a despot; my brother 
 and myself were not always passive sub- 
 jects; and the servants murmured under 
 the controul of the young house-keeper.

 My father's tranquillity was thus in- 
 vaded, and he determined on a measure, 
 Avhich, had it succeeded, would have re- 
 stored order in his house. But Miss Flint 
 was a plain girl; and my good father 
 found that neither the frequent intima- 
 tions M'hich he gave of his liberal fortune, 
 and designs in her favour, nor the com- 
 mendations he bestowed on her good sense 
 and notability, produced any overtures of 
 a matrimonial kind for his daughter. Lu- 
 cretia, estimating her fortune and pre- 
 tensions, was too proud ^\ to undervalue 
 herself," and with manners never pleas- 
 ing, she was overlooked by men whose 
 fortune needed not trafficking for awife. 
 This period of her youth, of course, pas- 
 sed unpleasantly; and conscious that she 
 was neither a favourite with her own sex 
 nor the other, she disdained both, and 
 acquired a severity of speech, and a point- 
 ed incivility of behaviour to all around 
 her.

 I had in the course of these events 
 quitted my situation at the Charter- 
 house. ]\Iy partiality towards my sister 
 Mary had not been unnoticed. Lucretia 
 classed me with those whom she despised; 
 and I met this indifference, it may be, 
 with too much carelessness. In the mean 
 time, my dear mother's influence was 
 again exerted in my favour; but she 
 gained her point with some difficulty. 
 My father ungraciously observing, that 
 he saw she was determined to have me 
 learned and useless. He had no interest 
 but such as his commercial concerns 
 gave him; and he only Avished, that I 
 might not in the end blame her for an 
 ambition so little profitable to my future 
 fortune in life. My mother prevailed, 
 and I was sent to Oxford. Satisfied wuth 
 this extorted compliance, she saw me for 
 two or three years happy in my pur- 
 suits, and the friend of my tutor; and 
 wherefore, my dear Madam, should I

 suppress the glory of iny life ? She saw 
 nie her pride and hope ! Her discernment 
 in chosing the moment propitious to her 
 applications in my behalf, and her gentle 
 arguments in my favour had their effect; 
 they could not make my father generous; 
 but they prevented him from being mean; 
 and my oeconomy rendered his bounty 
 sufficient. 
 
 At this period of my history, I received 
 the melancholy summons to attend my 
 mother, whose life was in danger. Too 
 soon were these apprehensions verified ! I 
 will pass over a sorrow which your feehng 
 heart has known, and which Avas the tri- 
 bute tliat every child must pay to the 
 loss of a good parent. My mother ap- 
 peared to have settled her accounts with 
 this world, but as they related to Mary, 
 then nearly fourteen. She spoke of her 
 approaching dissolution with calmness 
 and the hopes of a christian. '* I have/' 
 said she to me, ^*only one anxiety to

 myself up to my merciful maker. But 
 the mother is yet too busy for my re- 
 signation. You Pereival, are my hope ; 
 you see the fpartial hand of nature has 
 endowed your sister Mary with a beauty, 
 which all must acknowledge; I dread 
 it, as her misfortune. You know her 
 artless, unsuspecting natnre, the cheerful 
 gaiety of her temper, and her soft, com- 
 pliant disposition. Guard her, as you 
 'wish for a mother's blessing ! Your fa- 
 ther's pursuits in life, his excessive fond- 
 ness for his dear girl, and, I may say it to 
 you, liis want of mental attainments, 
 must disqualify him for the guide of her 
 youthful career. Your brother will soon be 
 so remote from her, that were he capable 
 of protecting her, his situation will render 
 him useless to her. Lucretia loves her 
 not, and from the violence of her temper 
 and the authority she will assume, every 
 thing pernicious is to be feared. Watch

 The distance is short, and the recom-

 Tuggedness of the path, nor be dis-

 But I am forgetting my purpose, Madam, 
 in recalling the last words of my guardian 
 angel ! 
 
 My brother Oliver's voyage to Ja- 
 maica took place soon after my mother's 
 death, and his marriage and final settle- 
 ment in the island succeeded to these 
 events. In the following year, my father 
 purchased the estate of Tarefield, and 
 giving up his business to my brother, 
 and his old and faithful clerk, retired ta 
 the hall. His first sorrow for my mother's 
 loss, was so violent as to give us fears 
 for his hfe. His constitution was shaken 
 by a fever of some danger and duration. 
 On recovering from this peril, I could 
 not help perceiving that the gloom which 
 
 1 
 


## p. 97 (#101) #############################################

THE VICTIM OF VILLANY. 97 
 
 hung on his spirits, was tending to that 
 state of discontent which invariably pre- 
 cludes all the '' uses of adversity." Ac- 
 customed to seek, in the cheerful' and 
 conciliating temper of my mother, a 
 relief in all the httle petulancy of his own 
 unequal disposition, he lamented her loss 
 without ceasing, as a cojiveniejice, rather 
 than a blessing, which he had seen torn 
 from him. Lucretia, with unremitting 
 attention, endeavoured to regulate his 
 domestic comforts. Mary alone possessed 
 the power to calm and compose his fret- 
 ful hours ; she was indulged as a child, in 
 return for her tender solicitude to amuse 
 and please him. I was useful to him iu 
 no way, and sunk into a cypher. 
 
 My father, in liis sorrow, had forgotten 
 to lament the loss of that benign influ- 
 ence, which had so skilfully counteracted 
 the encroachments of avarice. Left to his 
 natural bias, these soon appeared, and 
 Lucretia failed not to make an advantage

 of a weakness which her mother had 
 checked and restrained. Every reform in 
 the expences of the family met with ap- 
 probation, and my father insensibly gave 
 his confidence *' to his excellent ma- 
 nager." I silently submitted to the new 
 order of things. The time approached 
 for my emancipation from the restraints 
 of my father's house; I had taken my 
 degrees, and wished to pass one term 
 more at the university, before I so- 
 licited my ordination. I spoke to my 
 father on the subject, explaining to him 
 my motives for the request I urged. *^ I 
 have withdrawn your name from the 
 college books," said he, ^'more than a 
 week since. I see no good that can 
 result from your losing your time, and 
 spending my money there." I ventured 
 to remonstrate, urged my disappointment, 
 and added, that I had not been idle, but 
 had worked both for honour and inde- 
 pendence. ** Pray, Sir," asked he with a

 make yearly, of your learned lahouvsV 
 '* Even in deacon's orders," replied I, cut 
 to the very soul, '* I might have eaten 
 my own bread, and gratified my love of

 replied he roughly, " by being Mary's 
 schoolmaster; and at my table, with 
 forty pounds per annum, I presume yoa 
 will be a> well oiF as with a curacy." 
 My mother's blqssed spirit saved me from 
 uttering the reproaches which were on 
 my lips. I remembered her dying advice, 
 I bowed, and was retiring. ^' Hark ye, 
 Sir !" cried he, '' I see I have offended 
 your classical pride, but you ought to 
 remember, that I never wished to see you 
 brought up in idleness. It was your 
 mother's pleasure to see you the gentle- 
 man of the family. I always told her, I 
 W-ould not buy you a Iking', earn one, as 
 I have done before you. Go to your bro-

 I bowed, and said, that my part required 
 no time for a resolution: I was not edu- 
 cated for commerce ; nor should I go to 
 Jamaica; but I should consider that time 
 well employed, which was devoted to 
 Mary's improvement: for the rest, I re- 
 lied on his goodness and favour*' " As 
 you please," answered he, somewhat sof- 
 tened: "at least, you will be useful, and 
 you will have no wants under my roof." 
 I bowed, and was permitted to retire. 
 Lucretia exulted in this my defeat; but I 
 Icept my temper. Mary with delight, now 
 listened to my plans of instruction. Young 
 as she was, she entered into my vex- 
 ations. "Be but contented here," said 
 she, " and I shall be happy. My father's

 love is not yet diverted from his play- 
 thing; leave me to manage, you shall be 
 comfortable." Every device which in- 
 nocence and affection could suggest, was 
 now practised in her playful hours with 
 her doating father. She could not study 
 in the common parlour, she should never 
 think herself at school. My father or- 
 dered Mr. Percival to choose his own 
 apartment; and a room was dignified with 
 the name of my study. It were endless 
 to enumerate the means this "spoiled 
 child," to use Miss Flint's epithet, em- 
 ployed to lesson the mortifying circum- 
 stances of my situation. Her winning 
 smiles, her sweet persuasions, her playful 
 vivacity, had in appearance but one sti- 
 mulus ; â€” my ease and comfort. She rode 
 on horseback, because this produced a 
 horse for Percival's use, who was to attend 
 her. She loved only what he preferred 
 at table, and even in her application to 
 my lessons, she was excited by the desire

 of serving me. My father soon dis- 
 coveied by Mary's proficiency in arith-

 was not ignorant in the multiphcatiou 
 table ; and I, satisfied with my dear pu- 
 pil's improvement, and gratified by her 
 affection, became more reconcded to my 
 situation. Mary's age, when in her 
 seventeenth year, produced lier a new 
 title. ''The spoiled child" was dismissed 
 for ''the idle girl, ' and lectures on the 
 loss of time were not spared. With 
 serious remembrance of my mother's too 
 prophetic words, I laboured incessantly 
 to implant in my lovely sister those prin- 
 ciples of conduct, which in female life,, 
 particularly, are of more worth than all 
 the learning of the schools. The re- 
 gulation of her heart, and the strength- 
 ening her judgment, neither deprived her 
 of her native simplicity, nor diverted 
 her attention from the occupations of 
 her sex. She continued to be my father's

 temper and an address, whieh it must 
 be confessed, peculiarly marks the fair 
 sex, and which, when employed as Hea- 
 ven intended, renders a woman irresist- 
 ible, she converted at her pleasure, the 
 ungracious refusal into kindness, gloom 
 into social content, and fretful com- 
 plainings into laughter and delight. One 
 triumph of this angel in form and mind, 
 I cannot omit. She had by her innocent 
 exertions to please her father, persuaded 
 him, that at seventeen years of age, it 
 was time for her to begin to economize 
 her own little purse. *' It is now three

 warmed her own, *' that nothing was 
 more useful to a girl, than committing to 
 her care the annual sum requisite to her

 ably bestowed, immediately gave her 
 twenty guineas. She gratefully received 
 them, and with bewitching grace and 
 gaiety, wrote him in much form, an ac- 
 quittance. He laughed, but was not dis- 
 pleased vv'ilh her accuracy. '* If,"- said 
 he, *'you can keep your accounts as well 
 as you have done this, you will be fit for 
 a merchant's wife in time." â€” " Never 
 fear," cried she, '* you shall see how ex^ 
 pert I am: I will first pay my debts, and 
 then keep day-book and ledger of what 
 remains." My father, surprised, asked 
 what debts she could probly have incurred 
 '*They are those," replied she, "not only 
 of gratiude, but of justice: my brother 
 Percival has purchased books for my use, 
 which he needed not for his own, and I 
 know he wishes to enlarge his little store, 
 but has not the means. Have I my dear 
 and tender father's permission to share 
 with ]\\m this his bounty? I shall have 
 sufficient remaining.'* Conscience, or

 gave her a note for five and twenty 
 pounds for me, and finished by saying , 
 *' you may as well say nothing of this ta 
 your sister." Neve^ shall I forget her 
 transports when she related this incident 
 to me. "Take it," said she, pushing the 
 whole sum toward me," take it as the 
 first fruits of that affection, which my 
 father will soon shew you. Oh ! if he 
 were but left to his own goodness of 
 heart! how happy should we be, and how 
 happy would he be himself! But have 
 courage, my dear Percival, we shall suc- 
 ceed, for we will merit his love; and he 
 will be just." I received my present with 
 more contentment of heart than I can 
 express; and Mary begged I would be 
 her purse-bearer for the greater part of 
 her treasure, adding, that she had no 
 other means of securing it from her sis- 
 ter's enquiry, who took upon her to eX' 
 amine her drawers at her pleasure.

 XT was soon after this little event that 
 my enjoyments were augmented by the 
 arrival of Mr. Howard, who served the 
 parish of Tarefield as curate to Mr. 
 Snughead's predecessor, and who took 
 up his residence as a boarder and lodger 
 at Mr. Wilson's. Few circumstances 
 could have more elated my spirits. The 
 most intimate friendship had united us 
 at Oxford. We were of the same Col- 
 lege, and had enjoyed the instructions, 
 and the good opinion of the same re- 
 spectable tutor. Howard was my senior.

 and unquestionably my superior in learn- 
 ing : I had experienced the advantages 
 resulting from this circumstance ; for his 
 attainments were a fund on which I drew 
 for my own benefit. The external graces 
 of this young man corresponded with the 
 endowments of his mind ; and the ele- 
 gant scholar and unaffected gentleman 
 was distinguished at the university, as 
 the handsom.est man there. 
 
 Comliness in form and feature, was the 
 hereditary donation which Howard had 
 received from his family, with its high 
 pretensions to ancient splendour and 
 honours. Fortune had so sunk its pros- 
 perity, that his father had earned his 
 bread by his sword; and on his death, 
 in the field of battle, left to his young 
 widow, with a small life annuity, and a 
 pension from government, this only child, 
 then an infant at the breast. The spirit 
 of Howard animated the partner of his 
 adverse fortune; slie devoted herself to

 the care of her son; but with anxious 
 sohcitude implanted in him her own sen- 
 timents in regard to a mihtary Hfe ; and 
 by a rigid oeconomy, and the sacrifice of 
 her own comforts, she was enabled to 
 place him in a profession, which united 
 the ideas of honour and safety for him, 
 with peace of mind to herself To invite 
 a guest to my father's table, was not 
 amongst the privileges which I enjoyed 
 at Tarefield. Satisfied by finding myself 
 received at Mr. Wilson's with hospitality, 
 and the frankness so inherent in the mind 
 of this worthy man, I neither regretted 
 the apparently uncivil omission which 
 rendered my friend a stranger to my 
 home, nor wished to see him received 
 there. Mary, approaching to her eigh- 
 teenth year, was a dangerous object for 
 Howard's sensibility; and he was formed 
 to please her. These precautions of pru- 
 dence and consideration settled my mode 
 of eonduct during the first week or two

 of Howard's residence; but nothing was 
 talked of at the hall but *' the handso^ne 
 curate''' *' the fine 'prtachtr^'' who was 
 come to Tarefield." My father, never a 
 punctual church-goer, and who had been 
 long disgusted by the old curate's York- 
 shire dialect, and his ignorance, to which 
 was unluckily added, his not playing 
 either at cribbage or back-gammon, had, 
 when disposed to say his prayers in a 
 church, preferred that in the next parish, 
 now in the hands, as it was then, of Mr. 
 Greenwood; who was also a friend of 
 Mr. Howard's, and who had been the 
 principal inducement for his acceptance 
 of the curacy of Tarefield. I was called 
 upon for my report of my friend's merits, 
 and truth dictated my answer. ''It is 
 very strange you never mentioned his ar- 
 rival," observed Miss Flint; *' your 
 friend must entertain a poor opinion of 
 the hospitality of Tarefield-hall from the 
 neglect he has received from us. It is

 rather odd, that he should not have call 
 ed on your father; such an attention 
 would have been proper; but I suppose 
 he was prevented." This remark was not 
 intended to fall to the ground ; and con- 
 trary to my usual custom, I took care it 
 should not. ** It has never been a ques- 
 tion," replied I, '^ between Howard and 
 myself, under which of our roofs we 
 should enjoy each others society. I nei- 
 ther invited, nor repulsed his appearance 
 here; for he never mentioned the subject: 
 if he had, I should have told him, that 
 his introduction did not depend upon 
 me. My father sees no company ; and I 
 should not have presumed to ask to his 
 table, a guest, who had no better title to 
 his notice than being my friend,''' â€” 
 "I am not unwilling, Percival," said my 
 father, *'to receive him with that title^ 
 whatever you may think, provided I 
 can understand him better than the last 
 dunderhead that was here. Does How-

 ard playback-gammon?" I could only 
 answer for the purity of his English, and 
 his cheerful temper. The conference 
 concluded by my being desired to engage 
 Mr. Howard and Mr. Greenwood to dine 
 at the hall on the following Sunday. 
 Nearly a week's penance was softened to 
 IVliss Flint by the preparations needful for 
 the expected guests. To the important 
 concerns of the table were superadded 
 those which regarded her personal de- 
 corations; for, as she observed, she had 
 lived such a recluse, that she was hardly 
 fit to be seen by a gentleman. 
 
 From the day of this visit, Tarefield 
 experienced unknown delights. My 
 father found the curate an excellent hand 
 at back-gammon, " when he minded 
 what he was doing." The honey of 
 Hybla was on Miss Lucretia's lips; and 
 her smiles were the signal for every one's 
 merriment. My father became good 
 humoured, and of course less the invalid.

 He now thought himself equal to a jour- 
 ney to London, which he had long 
 meditated, and which he considered as 
 indispensibly necessary to his affairs. 
 My sister earne^stly seconded his inten- 
 tion, demonstrating that he would be 
 the better for a change of scene, and the 
 exercise it would give him. ** Take your 
 pet with you," added she with a gracious 
 nod, " shew her London for a month, 
 and you will return home a young man, 
 and leave behind you those habits of re- 
 tirement, which have contributed more 
 to make you an old one than either your 
 years or your infirmities.'* My father 
 observed that he should have too much 
 business on his hands to permit him to 
 shew Mary "the lions,'' but that the en- 
 suing winter, it was probable, he should 
 pass some weeks in London, and carry 
 \vith him his whole family. Miss Lucre- 
 tia s logic had been too conclusive to be 
 recanted ; and she saw my father depart

 for London without his pet. Hope how- 
 ever, remained at Tarefield, and so whis- 
 pered success, that this defeat was 
 apparently forgotten in new expedients. 
 These were of that sort which it was 
 impossible for poor Howard to overlook 
 or mistake. He confessed his embarrass- 
 ment to me ; and with that integrity of 
 mind which marked his course through 
 life, he declared his love for my angelic 
 Mary. I did not forget my duty, Miss 
 Cowley, although I well knew there was 
 not a man on earth better qualified to be 
 her protector and to render her happy, 
 I failed not to place before my friend the 
 insuperable obstacles which would oppose 
 his wishes, from his want of fortune, and 
 from the influence of the disappointed, 
 and already too envious sister. I pointed 
 out to him the necessity of his being less 
 frequently at the hall, and pleaded 
 Mary's peace as endangered by his per- 
 sisting in a passion so calculated to reach

 iier innocent bosom. Mr. Greenwood 
 engaged to do his parochial duty for him 
 for a month ; in which time my father 
 would be at home, and a more guarded 
 iiitercourse could be established. Mary 
 affected no concealments with me on the 
 subject of her dejection when Howard 
 left us. Love had made her quick- 
 sighted ; and attributing my friend's 
 absence to its true cause, she lamented 
 Miss Lucretia's folly as the only impedi* 
 ment to her happiness, *' being certain 
 that no father could reject such a man 
 as Mr. Howard." 
 
 I will not prolong my narrative with 
 the arguments which you will naturally 
 suppose I urged against this fond and 
 fallacious belief. Her tears subdued 
 much more than her promises satisfied 
 me, although she repeatedly engaged 
 '^ to act with a prudence which I should 
 approve ; to wait patiently for years ; 
 never to cause the least vexation to her

 dear father, and even to avoid offending 
 her sister by an acknowledgment of How- 
 ard's preference." All was easy ! time 
 would do every thing for Mary, except 
 to render her indifferent to Mr. Howard ! 
 I promised to be neuter, and I kept my 
 word. The lovers, as it will appear, 
 found an expedient to keep up a cor- 
 respondence, without implicating my 
 honour, or alarming my vigilance. My 
 father's unaccountable detention in Lon- 
 don was forgotten by the curate's return, 
 and unable to resist the attraction which 
 drew him to the hall, poor Howard ac- 
 celerated those measures which it had 
 cost him so many hours of privation to 
 retard. He was present when my fa- 
 ther's letter to Miss Fhnt announced his 
 marriage, with orders to prepare the 
 house for the reception of its new mis- 
 tress. Our astonishment at this intelli-' 
 gence was succeeded by our cares for 
 Lucretia, who from fury, sunk into

 violent fits. When restored to more com- 
 posure, she hung faintly on Howard's 
 arm, and said, "Be not discouraged, my 
 dear lioward ! I will convince my father 
 that I have as good a right as himself to 
 be happy. Let the minx whom he has 
 married, be his slave. My duty shall be 
 devoted to a husband, who will not dis- 
 grace his family. â€” He shall, Howard, 
 consent to the justice of my demand. I 
 will force him to be generous ; you shall 
 have no reason to complain of fortune !" 
 Poor Howard, sinking with confusion and 
 unable to speak, was relieved by my 
 calling him to assist me. Mary, who in 
 stupid silence had witnessed this scene, 
 fainted ; and he w^as permitted to retire, 
 after having assisted me in conveying 
 her to her room.

 children. The more attractive charms 
 of her youth may still be traced in the 
 modest and pensive expression of hev 
 countenance. She was extremely agi- 
 tated on her first appearance, and seemed 
 intimidated to a painful degree. Her 
 brother, Mr. Flamall, accompanied her 
 to the Hall; and by an affected gaiety, 
 endeavoured to encourage his sister, and 
 to recommend himself. Her mannerg 
 succeeded much better to reconcile us to 
 the stepmother. A quiet melancholy, 
 a mild and endearing attention to every 
 one around her, indicated the sweetness 
 of her temper, and the authority by 
 which she had been compelled to marry 
 a man of seventy. For some days Miss 
 Flint refused to quit her room. My 
 father's resentment was appeased by his 
 gentle help-mate; and she entreated him 
 to assure his daughter, that she neither 
 meant to interfere m her management of 
 his family, nor to lessen her influenceo

 *' Tell Miss Flint," added she, '' that my 
 office in this house will be confined to 
 my duty, as it regards your ease and 
 comfort ; and that in order to be happy 
 myself, it is incumbent upon me to ren- 
 der your children so. I come not as a 
 rival, but as a friend, to this abode." 
 She looked at us with emotion, and a 
 tear escaped. Some concessions pro- 
 duced the submission which my father 
 wished for; a general amnesty took place, 
 and Mr. Flamall so entirely diverted Miss 
 Flint's ^sentments, that, to my astonish- 
 ment, she was obsequiously polite to Mrs. 
 Flint. How^ard paid his visit of cere- 
 mony; my father received him with his 
 usual cordiality; but his general absence 
 was unnoticed. Flamall played at back- 
 gammon with my father, and his young 
 wife engaged his attention. A hasty call 
 from time to time prevented curiosity or 
 enquiry; and I secretly rejoiced that How- 
 ard was less in Mary's sight. She was

 every day more pleased with my fathers 
 choice; and considering her as the victim 
 of a brother's interested view^s, she loved 
 her as being unfortunate, and approached 
 her by a sympathy apparently well un- 
 derstood. 
 
 Amiable and uniformly correct as Mrs. 
 Flint's conduct was, you will not he 
 surprised, that I endeavoured, not only 
 as a son, but as a gentleman^ to shew 
 her that respect and those attentions to 
 which she was entitled. She loved read- 
 ing, and my library was hers. Some- 
 times she would steal an hour from her 
 tiresome duties, and with her needle- 
 work join Mary; and I read to them. 
 She loved flowers and plants; and I be- 
 came diligent in the culture of them. 
 My father was pleased with this acqui- 
 escence on my part, and one morning 
 he asked whether I was not satisfied that 
 he had augmented his comforts. I re- 
 plied with sincerity, saying that I had

 no doubt of it ; and that I was also con- 
 vinced, that in his wife Mary would 
 find a guide and a friend. ** So I think," 
 returned he smiHng, "I saw from the 
 first hour that they would suit each 
 other." A few weeks passed in peace 
 and comfort, when suddenly my father 
 relapsed into ill-humour, and was still 
 more harsh and abrupt with me than 
 ever. Stung by some rudeness of this 
 sort, I asked him what had offended him. 
 ** Your conduct," said he roughly. " I 
 do not want you to make love to my 
 wife."â€”" I am sorry," answered I, *Hhat 
 you so little understand me, Sir ; you 
 make me wretched by your suspicions, 
 and injure a woman whom I believe to be 
 truly virtuous." â€” '* I believe her so," 
 returned he, ** but I want no rival under 
 my roof." He left me. I was confound- 
 ed and astonished beyond conception, 
 and in my road to my friend Ho ward *s,

 by recalling my most indifferent actions, 
 to find a clew by which to unravel this 
 unaccountable jealousy which my father 
 had shewn. Conscious that I had never 
 in the most remote manner, either expe- 
 rienced or discovered a sentiment beyond 
 that good-will and respect which my 
 mictions had -evinced, I mentioned, in the 
 course of my conversation with Howard, 
 an incident of a recent date, which at 
 the moment struck me, and which then 
 appeared to explain, in some sort, my 
 father's ill-humour, though not his sus- 
 picions. 
 
 Mrs. Flint, at the breakfast- table, a 
 few days before, had, with cheerfulness, 
 reminded my father of a promise he had 
 made her in town. *^ He told me," said 
 she, smiling on my sisters, ** that you 
 would like current coin better than 
 fashionable tinsel; and thus prevented 
 me from adding to the incumbrances of 
 band-boxes ; but he must keep his word,

 somely; otherwise, if you will help me, 
 we will pick his pocket now, for I know 
 we shah meet with a good booty." The 
 poor fond old man kissed her, and said 
 she could do what she pleased with him 
 without assistance. She blushed with 
 genuine modesty, took the offered purse, 
 and gratefully gave us each a twenty 
 pound note. I thought at the moment 
 that my father's brow clouded; and I be- 
 lieve vshe thought so likewise, for, with a 
 sweet smile, she thanked him for his 
 goodness to her. I received, however, 
 my gift with a bow of acknowledgment^ 
 not unmixed with the painful idea of my 
 dependance. Howard listened to this 
 little account; but he informed me that 
 Mary had mentioned to him a conversa- 
 tion she had accidentally heard before 
 the wedding gift was mentioned; and 
 that from what had passed between Miss 
 Flint and her maid, she was certain her

 father suspected the motives of my civi- 
 lities to the young mother-in law. Let 
 it suffice, Madam, I determined to leave 
 Tarefield; nor did my friend Howard 
 endeavour to oppose my resolution. He 
 saw that it was impossible I could live at 
 the hall, and that jj my health and ta- 
 lents were sinking under the continual 
 checks imposed on my activity and 
 spirits. 
 
 He solemnly engaged to watch over 
 the only object of my tender regrets, 
 and to maintain his pretentions to her at 
 the point of his life; to guard her as 
 a sacred deposit left in his hands, and 
 never to urge her to commit an act that 
 I could not approve. I knew Howard, 
 Miss Cowley, and I was satisfied. The 
 remainder of the day was given to my 
 secret preparations, and the following 
 morning I was on the road to London ;

 purse, and my blessed mother's pocket-

 delayed from motives of prudence. A 
 patron of merit appeared, and Heartley 
 gave up the possession of the law for a

 ceeded in getting me a lieutenancy of

 ment, my dear mother's dying gift was

 when your father graciously pressed me

 Nothing, however, could detain me in 
 town ; and with all my worldly wealth, 
 namely, thirty guineas in my purse, I 
 took my place in a northern stage-coach; 
 and quitting it w^ithin a few miles of this 
 spot, endeavoured to hire a horse. Some 
 difficulty arising, to which my impatience 
 could not submit, I deteruiined to leave 
 my portmanteau at the inn, and to walk. 
 I set forward, but was soon overtaken by 
 a heavy rain, A stage- waggon was in 
 sight, and knowing that I had no clothes 
 with me, I accepted the shelter. A neat- 
 ly-dressed country woman was the only 
 passenger. The rain poured down in 
 torrents, and she began her chat by ob- 
 serving that I had been lucky. I sighed. 
 '* Mayhap, Sir,'' continued she curiously 
 examining my uniform, "you are not used 
 to ride in waggon; but is it not better 
 than being wet to the skin.?" I said I

 " who does not, that lives in the parish,

 sorry to hear she is ill,'' observed I, 
 
 anxious for more intelHgence " Why 
 
 as for the matter of health," returned 
 she, " thank God, she has no reason to 
 complain ; but she is sadly troubled to 
 see the curate so poorly. I suppose. Sir, 
 you know Mr. and Madam Howard, who

 I dare not recall the anguish of our first 
 embrace ! Let it suffice ; it appeared that 
 Heaven in its mercy conducted me to 
 them for their consolation. Howard's 
 spirits were renewed, the cherub Mary 
 smiled inher cradle, and we forgot thepast 
 in our present comforts. Tarefield-hall 
 was shunned ; for I feared my impetuo- 
 sity, and dreaded to disturb the tran- 
 quillity of my dear invalids. Heartley 
 gained me three months leave of absence 
 beyond the term allotted me, and I was 
 happy; â€” yes, Miss Cowley, happy ! for I 
 perceived that I was the cordial of health 
 to tliose whom I loved more than myself. 
 Howard's cough disappeared; and he 
 began to talk of freeing Mr. Greenwood 
 from his fatigue of going through the 
 parochial duties. This led him to expa- 
 tiate on that gentleman's generous and

 nate fancy from me to himself, we should 
 be released from a serious obstacle to 
 our wishes. On the death of my dear

 pleaded business and want of spirits for

 and made a full confession of my attach- 
 ment to my sweet Mary, not omitting 
 your fatherly counsels and her trust in 
 my devoted heart. He could only repeat 
 your sage exhortations, and pity me. 
 Mrs. Wilson was a more useful confidant, 
 for I had notice of the enemy's approach ; 
 and my escapes were so well managed, 
 that, foiled in the purpose of her frequent 
 visits, Miss Lucretia forgot her dear 
 
 Mrs. Wilson, and at once made known 
 her intentions to her father. Mr. Tlint's 
 
 letter contained a very civil approbation 
 of my conduct, " in as much as I had 
 practised a prudence w^hich did honour 
 to my principles, it certainly being an 
 improbable event, that he should favour 
 an union so unequal in regard to for-

 plying to him from an honest scruple, 
 he informed me that I was secure of his 
 consent, that he should allow Lucretia 
 four hundred pounds per annum, and

 the living of Tarefield. For his further 
 consideration he made no doubt, I would

 of my aifections, in Miss Flint's pre-

 for an instant contradicted my words ; 
 nor could any motives of interest dis- 
 pose me to relinquish a woman whom I 
 loved. You will conclude that my fa- 
 vour at the hall ceased ; and in my dis- 
 grace, even my pulpit eloquence was 
 forgotten ; for the family, when they 
 were disposed to enter a place of public 
 worship, went to Greenwood's parish. 
 Secure as we mutually were on the side of 
 faith and love, my dear Mary and myself 
 contrived with the help of the faithful 
 old oak and those hopes to which we 
 fondly cleaved, to support those little 
 trials of our patience. I had Avarned her 
 never to keep my letters, and to be pre- 
 pared for the inspection of a jealous wo-

 occasions she was alarmed by hearing 
 some one at the Mandow calling her gent- 
 ly by name; despair rendered her fear- 
 less, and, on approaching it, she found it- 
 was a young man who iiued in the house

 means of her escape. She recollected her 
 concealed treasure, and he disinterred it. 
 Greenwood was at the avenue gate with 
 a decent looking man and a chaise. He 
 told her she was safe, and that her guide 
 would protect her. She instantly got into 
 the carriage, which was an open, old- 
 fashioned vehicle, with two stout horses, 
 and driven by her conductor. They soon 
 lost sight of the village. Frank retired 
 to his pillow in the stable-chamber : and 
 Greenwood returned home. I have

 perceived there was more in his manner,

 the road to my friend's house. I had not 
 proceeded far, when Frank, breathless 
 with speed, overtook me. ' She is safe, 
 Sir!' said he, * blessed be God, she is 
 safe. Mr. Greenwood will tell you all 
 all about it. They cannot murder her 
 now.' He darted from me. * I miUst

 and to inform me of the obligations she 
 was under to Mary's mother. These 
 were fully stated, and Frank proceeded 
 to his own confession. He preferred 
 being a sailor to working with his bro- 
 tber-ih-law, a \vealthy farmer, who lived 
 five miles from Newcastle; he left his good 
 friends secretly, and by chance stopped 
 at the Ram for refreshment. There he 
 met a groom just discharged from the 
 hall, and who disgusted by Miss Flint, 
 entertained Frank with the history of 
 the family, and gave vent to his own 
 resentments. Miss Mary was the heroine 
 of this history. She was an * angel^^ 
 but with the rest, made miserable by the 
 ^ she-devir who ruled in the house; and 
 he had left the ball in a fine 'kick tfp ;' 
 for they had found" out that Miss Mary 
 had been writing a love-letter to the cu- 
 rate her sister's sweetheart. Curiosity

 to Frank's project ; he won on the land- 
 lord to recommend him to the vacated 
 post, and Tarefield being in no great re- 
 pute for kitchen comforts, he was en- 
 gaged on trial, and entered into the 
 family as groom, under the name of 
 Frank Armstrong. In a few days Frank 
 was in the family secrets, the kitchen 
 account wasin the captive's favour. Anne, 
 the chamber-maid, to use Frank's words, 
 made his blood boil in his veins. lie 
 wrote to his mother, promising he would 
 never go to sea, if she would come and 
 take away Miss Mary. The good wo- 
 man's letter to me, was an undeniable 
 proof of her principles and prudence. I 
 observed, that the only difficulty was 
 to remove Mary from the house. * Leave 
 that to me, Sir,' said he, exultingly,

 Sunday is a Sabbath of rest with our 
 folks at the hall ; I had them safe in their 
 beds till eight or nine o'clock, and there 
 was time gained. Secondly, Mr. Webstep, 
 my brother, could not so well come on 
 any other day, because of his horses: and

 feited the rights of a parent; he has given

 Howard ; he may one day thank nie, as 
 the dehverer of his child. It requires 
 but a superficial knowledge of human 
 nature, and little experience in Hfe, to 
 know the fatal effects of counteracted 
 and opposed passion, in a youthful mind, 
 when cruelty is the means employed to 
 accomplish the purpose. I am not dis- 
 posed to believe that many girls die of 
 love ; but I have seen many examples of 
 an evil more to be dreaded than death, 
 by an improper and harsh opposition to 
 this passion, as well as others ; and when 
 I saw your Mary I was convinced that I 
 was acting in favour of humanity and 
 justice. I have, however," continued he,

 A month passed. Greenwood found 
 Mr. Flint inaccessible. He desired to

 point. . Wiih well affected concern she 
 mentioned her father's illness as the rea- 
 son of his refusing his friendly visits, 
 adding, that no consolation could at that

 by the conduct of an ungrateful and too 
 tenderly beloved child. She entered into 
 the detail of my infamous duplicity, and 
 Mary's as infamous advances to my pre- 
 ference. I wave however, continued che,

 them ; but the letters now in my father's

 has convinced him, that she was in Per-

 in his profligate inchnation for Mrs. 
 Flint, telling him, that in time she might

 informed, Miss Flint, and I caution you, 
 as the minister of a master avIio ** hateth

 done to offend him ; and what you still 
 meditate to do, in order to min that in-

 He instantly quitted the rx)om, leaving'

 Mr. Greenwood soon after gave me my 
 leave of absence. I flew to my every 
 earthly good. Mrs. Croft had conducted 
 her to Berwick, and on my joining her, 
 we were united in the presence of as 
 many witnesses as curiosity and the ad- 
 miration of Mary's beauty collected. We 
 passed a. week with Mr. Webster, and 
 finally settled here, with a welcome of a

 character like this,'' He at length, se- 
 dately gave us the particulars of the 
 discovery of Mary's escape, which, you 
 will easily imagine, produced the utmost 
 confusion: I was naturally the first per- 
 son suspected as having aided her; but 
 I had, fortunately, passed the Saturday at 
 Bishop's- Auckland, and had slept there. 
 This alibi proved, and my remaining 
 quiet at Wilson's perplexed them, and 
 lost in conjectures, they gave up the 
 fruitless question. Frank was requested 
 to convey our letters to Mr. Flint. My 
 master keeps his room, said he, sorrowful- 
 ly ; and Madam Flint no more dares to act 
 in the matter, than to swallow fire, or 
 poison, poor soul ! But do not cry, my 
 dear lady, all will turn out well in time. 
 Let me consider, I will contrive ! Anne 
 goes into the room, and there is nothing 
 she can refuse me, she is as honest as the 
 the day is light, and loves you, Madam.

 Never fear, you have got Mr. Howard at 
 your side, and it is a long lane indeed 
 that has no end. I know but of one that 
 never ends, let them take that who like it, 
 say I; but yours is a sure road, Madam, 
 and never mind, altho' it is not, at pre- 
 sent, all on the nail. '* Oh Percival," 
 exclaimed poor Howard, lifting up his 
 expressive eyes to Heaven, " what is man 
 when true to his endowments ! He is in- 
 deed but little lower than the angels, and 
 worthy of the all-perfect hand which 
 made him ! But I shall meet this fellow- 
 mortal, and rejoice with him in his glo- 
 rious recompence! Our letters were com- 
 mitted to his faithful hands. Two or three 
 days after, he came to make his farewell 
 visit, and to request Mary to write to his 
 mother, that she was satisfied with his 
 conduct. Our letters to the hall were 
 returned, the seals unbroken. Anne was 
 discharged at a moment. Mr. Flamall, 
 said Frank, paid me my wages, and told

 me I did not suit my place nor the fa- 
 mily. I could have told you that, said I, 
 long ago ; but you had nothing to do 
 with me, nor I with you, Mr. Fiamall. I 
 spoke as I felt, Sir, added he, nodding to 
 me. He warned me if I valued a whole 
 skin, not to be insolent; but I told him 
 that neither my skin nor my honrsty 
 would be in danger from him. He said, 
 I was a low scoundrel. I never heard, 
 said I, keeping my ground, of a scound- 
 rel who was not low, though he tacked 
 ^guire or counsellor to his name. He ad- 
 vanced to strike me, but he thought 
 better of it, I believe, for he turned on his 
 heel. I wish to the Lord lie had, he 
 would have met with his match at a hai'd 
 blow, though he will never find one in his 
 roguery. Anne says there are fine doings 
 scoino* on between him and Miss Flint.

 swing, till their own noose catches theiti !

 that his snares were of our own making,

 M'Ould hind his, if we were disposed to use 
 them. But I must go, added he, to

 He bowed, and hastily left us, penetrated 
 with admiration and gratitude. 
 
 From this time we have not seen him ;

 of their roof, I should have forgotten 
 Tarefield-hall, with its inmates, but my 
 poor Mary heard continually of her 
 father's declining health, and prompted 
 by her tenderness, she was as continually 
 making attempts to see him. A letter 
 she sent to Mrs. Flint,, reached her, and 
 in a few days we were surprised by the 
 sight of Mary's clothes and linen, which 
 were left without a message. In ar- 
 ranging them, with the sweet hope which 
 this consideration inspired, a note dropped 
 from a gown sleeve; it was from Mrs. 
 Flint, and contained a bank bill of twenty- 
 five pounds. " I send you as a token of 
 my love, my dear and injured girl," wrote 
 Mrs. Flint, ''the inclosed trifle; this is all 
 I am able to do. M}^ interference in

 this time covered her face from obser- 
 vation, now rose with emotion, and stop-

 On reaching London after a delay thus 
 imposed, I found Heartley an his dying 
 bed; this trial did not accelerate my 
 recovery. A fever succeeded to his last 
 embrace. Alas, his virtues suited not the 
 world he had escaped ! Its cold and un- 
 genial maxims could not find admis- 
 sion into a heart glowing with every 
 noble affection. Trusting to vigorous 
 health, and scorning the prudence which 
 gives but to receive, he lived honourably 
 and died poor, leaving his widow with a 
 jointure of barely two hundred pounds 
 per annum, for the support of herself 
 and two children. This inestimable 
 woman found in her difficulties and 
 principles resources for ennobling her 
 character. Her sorrows were reserved for 
 her pillow; and with a calm and col- 
 lected mind, she disposed of her effects, 
 paid every outstanding debt; and then 
 declared to her friends, her intention of 
 quitting London, in order to give m

 retirement those habits to her children, 
 which alone could render them content-

 house was the asylum she chose; and in 
 me she saw the guardian whom her hus- 
 band had named for his son. My dear

 Being ! thou wilt not in rigour remember

 over my fainting sister,' I called down for 
 vengeance on her destroyer ! For some 
 days my soul sickened whilst I contem- 
 plated in her emaciated form, the triumph 
 of cruelty and the ravages of sorrow. 
 But she smiled me to resignation; and 
 my heart received the blessings which

 Heaven had spared me. Our tranquillity 
 met with no disturbance from the hall. I 
 had been settled more than a month, when 
 one morning, in passing the hall gate, I 
 saw Miss Flint and Mr. Flamall standing 
 in the road opposite to it, as though 
 waiting for some one from the house. I 
 passed them as an absolute stranger. Mr. 
 Flamall called me by name, and added, 
 *'Miss Flint, Sir, wishes to speak to you." 
 She advanced, and I stopped. *^ I should 
 have sent my attorney to you, Sir," said 
 she haughtily, ^^ if I had not thought 
 that you would in less than a month have 
 found leisure to call at the hall." â€” "When 
 I have any business at the hall, or interest 
 in those who reside there, I shall find 
 leisure to call," replied I, with ill -sup- 
 pressed emotion. "I neither expected, 
 nor desired your visit," answered she, '^on 
 my own account ; but I beg to know 
 your pleasure in regard to the books you 
 left behind you, when you deserted it." â€”

 " Consult yoMV lawyer,'" replied I; *^ if it 
 be allowed that I have a right to more 
 than a shilHng, send them ; I will pay the 
 carriage, as I did the bookseller of whom 
 they were purchased." I walked on, and 
 soon saw that she was joined by Mr. 
 Snughead, to whom she had recently 
 given the living of Tarefield. This cir- 
 cumstance did not contribute ta restore 
 my equanimity. Poor Howard pressed 
 on my memory and I returned home 
 dejected. 
 
 My books made their appearance oh 
 the following day ; and contributed to 
 my success as a tutor. Malcolm, Mac- 
 lairn, and Henry Heartley were my pupils; 
 and neither of them have disgraced me. 
 I pass-over all the fluctuations of a malady 
 so fallacious as my sister^s. Her approach 
 to the grave was so gradual, that at times 
 she laughed at our precautions, and be- 
 guiled us of our fears ; but when on the

 spoke of her dissolution with serenity. 
 
 One day she told me that she had been 
 writing to Lucretia, and wished me to 
 read the letter before she sealed it. I 
 >vaved my hand, and turned away my 
 weeping eyes. " Well, I will not urge 
 it," said she putting in a wafer; "but 
 I cannot die in peace, without assuring 
 ier, that I sincerely forgive her. I am 
 hastening to an abode, into which no 
 animosities can enter. I have none to 
 impede my entrance; and the time may 
 come, when poor Lucretia will find a 
 consolation in this assurance. I have 
 even recommended my poor child to her 
 regard, as a proof that I have pardoned 
 her unkindness to me. The only senti- 
 ment I now can feel for an offending fellow- 
 creature," added she, wiping away a 
 starting tear, " is compassion; and I leave 
 you to judge, Percival> of that which

 But were I wholly to omit her in a letter 
 of this kind, it would, I think, have shewn 
 a spirit of pride, and of indiffeience to 
 my child. Her aunt is rich in this world's 
 wealth, she is poor. Lucretia may Hve

 titute girl find ah object who^ without

 sary that she should know I neither meant

 form. I swore solemnly that she should

 and that I would drag her to Mary's

 bed of death. These violent agitations 
 subsided to a more collected and deter- 
 mined purpose of thought. I was inca- 
 pable of receiving Greenwood's argu- 
 ments, and I was soothed by being left 
 to my design. Greenwood performed 
 the last sad office. Preparations were 
 made for receiving the remains of Mrs.

 his church, where her husband was bu- 
 ried; but the hearse and coach stopped 
 short of the halL Following the coffin 
 I proceeded on foot to the great gate of

 stop, I rang the bell with fury. A man- 
 servant answered my hasty summons; 
 and, appalled by the object in view, he 
 stood motionless before me. '^ Tell Miss

 that I am the bearer of a commission 
 from the deady and that I will be num- 
 bered with the dead before I leave this 
 spot if she refuses to admit me." Some

 little time elapsed : I was admitted ; and 
 the trembling heiress, surrounded by her 
 maid-servants, and protected by Mr. 
 Flaniall, with terror met my slow ap- 
 proach. Flamall broke the silence. He 
 asked me what I had to say to Miss 
 Flint. I waved my hand. ** Be wise!" 
 said I, *^ this is no time for you." â€” He 
 took the advice and shrunk from my 
 eye. I presented the packet to Lucretia ; 
 slie attempted to retreat on seeing the 
 address. " You must take it," said I 
 calmly : " nay, more, Lucretia, you must 
 read the contents in my presence : such 
 are my orders ; and before my Maker, 
 have I sworn to fulfil them." â€” *'Give it 
 to some one," cried she, covering her 
 iuce; "I promise to read it when 1 am 
 able." â€” ** That will not suffice," replied 
 I, sitting down and bursting into ago- 
 nizing tears ; ** I have no apprehensions : 
 a sister's dying blessing cannot injure, 
 a sister s forgiveness cannot wound you."

 hastily glancing her eyes over the two 
 letters it contained, asked me, with 
 rising anger, ** whether I was satisfied 
 with having insulted her under ^her 
 cwn roof?'" â€” Call it as you please,'^ 
 answered I, sternly ; '' my business was 
 not to compliment. I leave you with a 
 remedy you need. Profit from it, lest a 
 worse thing befal you than my insults.'^ 
 I instantly left her; and on my sainted 
 Mary's grave wept my feelings down to 
 composure, Time, and my remaining 
 comforts, healed, to a certain degree, 
 these breaches in my peace. I was at 
 length summoned to town with young 
 Heartley, by his friend, to prepare for 
 his voyage to Calcutta. A month was 
 employed in my cares for Heartley's son, 
 and my gratitude had its turn. I saw 
 him embark with all the sanguine hopes 
 of youth, qualified by my care, for an 
 honourable destination ; and gifted by

 nature with every virtuous and noble trait 
 of his father's character. He was under 
 the protection of a man who loved that 
 father, and I contentedly went back to my 
 lodgings in order to prepare for my re- 
 turn home. My demands on my banker 
 had been extended beyond their usual 
 course; and I had to settle my account 
 with his books before my departure. I 
 called at his house, it had stopped pay- 
 ment; and in a week or ten days deten- 
 tion in town I learned, that I might ex- 
 pect for the remaining sum of five hun- 
 dred pounds in his hands, a dividend of 
 *^ five shillings in the pound." 
 
 Mrs. Heartley was informed of this 
 event by her London correspondents. 
 My philosophy did not console her ; but it 
 was shared by the Wilsons, who observed

 not to fret about it, for that his comforts

 Maclairn. ^* She wished to see me, hav- 
 ing something to propose which she 
 trusted would heal the differences be- 
 tween us/' Mrs. Heartley's and Green- 
 wood's arguments prevailed. I went, 
 and, after some prelude, she told me, 
 that she had been informed of the 
 banker's insolvency, and was willing to 
 relieve me from the burden of supporting 
 Mary. I coldly replied that I had never 
 found her such. " Be it so," answered she, 
 *1 mean not in thils interview to offend 
 you. I will take another mode of ex- 
 pression. Consider whether a girl may 
 not be as safe under an aunt's protection 
 as under an uncle's, and that you may 
 die and leave her destitute. I have lost

 proposal send her, I will instruct her to

 cried I, "you may at this hour render her 
 so ! Let this precious girl be the cement 
 of our renewed ties of nature !" â€” ^' I must 
 first be assured that she has not been

 ing: " neither my intentions nor your

 Let her come ; I wish to know her, and 
 she must remain a stranger to me whilst 
 she is at Wilson's ; but we will at present 
 drop the subject : in a week I shall ex- 
 pect an answer." 
 
 She then detailed to me the miserable 
 state of Sir Murdock Maclairn, pitying 
 his wife, who lived nearly altogether in 
 his apartment. I will pass over the 
 struggles which ensued. Mary eagerly 
 solicited my consent. I saw her motive, 
 and clasped her to my bosom. MiSo

 she will love me." Mrs.Heartley approved 
 of Mary's conduct, adding ^* Miss How- 
 ard must subdue that inflexible woman, 
 Â©r she is lost to all hope." 
 
 You have seen the result ! You have 
 witnessed her aunt's obduracy ! I accept, 
 with gratitude, your offered protection. 
 Heaven has given you the means, and a 
 mind worthy of the donor! The time 
 may not be far remote when this desti- 
 tute young woman will present herself be- 
 foreyou, weak in her youth, in her beauty, 
 and in her purity. Shelter her. Madam ; 
 the work will be honourable, and the re- 
 compence beyond what my most fervent 
 prayers of gratitude can reach. 
 
 I remain respectfully, 
 Your obliged humble servant, 
 
 Peiicival Flint.

182 LADY MACLAIRN, 
 
 P. S. I had intended to suppress one 
 instance of the power of passion over a 
 mind unchecked by reason or religion. 
 You will be tempted to think it insanity. 
 It might be as well could I think thus. 
 
 On Mr. Howard's bringing his wife to 
 Wilson's, Miss Flint, in transports of 
 fury, flew to the apartment in which hung 
 my mother's picture, and with a hand 
 animated by an iln placable ferocity, she 
 cut and defaced the cherub face, which 
 was its beauty. My sister Howard, who 
 yf2LS ignorant of this impotent act of 
 revenge, often wished for this picture; 
 and I employed Malcolm's good offices 
 with his brother Philip to gain it. By 
 this means I learned the incident, and 
 consequently diverted my sister's direct 
 application from being made*

 her good uncle. I wish to prepare her for 
 a situation under the roof of her sister 
 Rachel Cowley, when with the name of 
 Hardcastle I shall be quahfied to act as 
 a mother to her. She would by remain- 
 ing at the Abbey be precluded from 
 those improvements she needs for the 
 world ; and Mrs. Heartley, whom I have 
 consulted, is of my opinion, that her 
 mind might be strengthened and bene- 
 fited by being placed more remote from 
 Tarefield, and the extreme tenderness 
 of the Wilsons. She must, whilst with 
 them, experience an attention which 
 tends to confirm the habits of depend- 
 ance, and to increase the natural timi- 
 dity of her mind. But I wish to see 
 Mary Howard my equal and friend. Let 
 xne have your opinion on this point ; con- 
 sult my dear father. Ask him whether 
 his Rachel Cowley is right in her judg- 
 ment, â€” that, with a simplicity Avhich 
 knoweth no evil, and a humility which

 ought to be produced, and as her future 
 provision will render necessary. You 
 know me, Lucy ; and you will not call

 and the captain, I presume, will, in. liis 
 letter, find room to tell you when you 
 may look for your guests. We have 
 now something else to do ; and which is 
 doing with April faces. Mary is so busy 
 that she does nothing. I am asked over 
 and over again, *^ whether Miss Hard- 
 castle will not think she dresses too much 
 for a young creature in her condition of 
 fortune; whether, I think Miss Hard- 
 castle will not find her aukward for her 
 age." Then comes hope, to dispel her 
 doubts and fears. " If she should please, 
 if IVIiss Hardcastle should take a fancy 
 to her as I had done, how happy vv^ould 
 be her lot ! Her dear uncle's heart w^ould 
 be at rest, and she in a course of im-

 he will be in less danger of corruption,

 "which Mrs. Allen and myself were pre-

 and as I thought a firmer step than usual, 
 to ask when the coach should draw up. 
 He wore his bridal suit, somewhat mo- 
 dernized ; an embroidered waistcoat, and, 
 as Mrs. Allen and myself both believe, a 
 rich diamond stock buckle; a new hat,

 by instantly adverting to my robe, which 
 was the one we embroidered together; 
 and paid it many compHments. Mrs. 
 Allen observed, that her grey silk gown 
 and black bonnet would disgrace the 
 well-dressed party. " No," replied he, 
 with easy politeness, '' that can never 
 happen, till you keep bad company. 
 Wisdom acknowledges her children under 
 any attire; and sober matron grace is 
 3^our ornament. But Malcolm means to 
 leave his boots behind him, and begs a 
 corner in the carriage with us," added 
 he, taking a pinch of snuiFfrom a superb 
 gold box ; '' i am not sorry to see him 
 now and then lay aside the farmer for

 may always be, though of the former,

 Malcolm's entrance and dress produced

 him with complacence, and said, ''Why, 
 now, indeed, you look like a lover, and

 either of those titles claim," rephed he, 
 gaily, " hang a calf skin on my recreant

 those stationary friends which lined the

 there are some of our fellow- creatures, so 
 richly endowed with virtuous propensi-

 refinements of the polite world, could 
 have better taught this woman the art 
 of conferring benefits without oppressing 
 the receiver, than her own heart, and the

 thousands in the world would consider 
 as a work of supererogation and superla-

 Wilson presiding at the head of Captain 
 Flint's table. The^i^^^^, for such it was, 
 was in her parlour. A noble room, with 
 a dark wainscoat, and a profusion of 
 carv^ing, gave dignity to the repast, and 
 also a contrast peculiarly striking to the 
 appearance of the guests; for we ought ta 
 have been dressed in farthingales and 
 Queen Bess's ruifs; and the donor of 
 the feast, as we suspect, to have had 
 pages and gentlemen ushers. Simplicity, 
 gaiety, and ease, supplied the place of 
 ancient ceremonials ; and I could not 
 help recalling, in remarking the modest 
 but independent farmer Wilson, the 
 times of vassalage, when pride and ab- 
 ject submission bound the human race 
 in the fetters of ignorance. Mrs. Allen, 
 who appeared to be particularly Mrs. 
 Wilson's favourite of the day, assures

 Miss Hardcastle's character has effected 
 this lenity on Mrs. Wilson's part. '^ Her 
 gentleness is exactly the thing ; for to 
 Mary Howard, geiitleness is meat, drink, 
 and clothing. She hopes Miss Hardcastle 
 will attend to the little cough, which 
 from time to tim.e alarms her fears, 
 INIary's dear parents having died of con- 
 sumptions; but then indeed these were 
 brought on by sorrow and the barbarity 
 of the wicked. Miss Howard will have 
 no such troubles ; yet she has given her 
 the recipe for the cough, which was 
 always useful. How so tender a creature 
 got through her hardship at the hall is 
 beyond her conception ! It appears to 
 her a miracle ! She who never went to 
 bed or rose without a fire in her room, 
 and who was reared like a cot-lamb T 
 Mrs. Allen received these hints with due 
 attention, and with good-natured seri-

 graced your cabinet. I wish Sedley was 
 thirty years older than he is, it would 
 save me the time necessary to delineate 
 not only the features, but the character 
 of Mr. Greenwood, who,

 relations ; only nature, always provident 
 as well as kind in her donations, thought 
 that one at a time would be sufficient for 
 her honour; and one in a country enough

 of admiring, for the first time in my hfe

 from his pocket, could not help expres- 
 sing his surprise, that he should hazard 
 the loss of such teeth as he envied. *' I

 would, like every thing artificial about 
 you, be disgraced by the gifts of Nature,

 ear to ear, the snowy white and even 
 teeth ; not of Lucy Hardcastle's sort, be- 
 cause one would make four of her pearls, 
 but yet as well adapted to the mouth 
 they reside in. So much for the doctors 
 teeth ; now for his humour. Some one 
 asked him whether he had lately seen a 
 certain Sir Peregrine Lofley, a gentle- 
 man of consequence somewhere in the 
 neighbourhood. " No,." replied he,, with 
 a peculiar expression of contempt. ^' He 
 has not had the cholic of late; and when 
 he has, he will not apply to the Scotch 
 quack for physic ; he found mine unpala-

 mortar." â€” ** That opinion speaks the 
 fool," answered he ; *^ but neither the 
 Scotch nor English physicians can cure 
 him of a radical want of brains. You 
 saw him three or four days after I had 
 accomphshed the same business which 
 they had done more than once; the only 
 difference consisted in the mode. This 
 fellow," continued he, turning to Sir 
 Murdock, " had, by his gluttony, pro-

 racle, might have killed him in twenty 
 Lours ; and having heard of * one Dou- 
 glas,'' who had saved a man from a mor- 
 tification of the bowels, I was sent for. 
 The danger of Sir Peregrine was not less 
 imminent, but happily yielded to medi- 
 cine. Perfectly knowing the cause of the 
 malady, I became the friend of nature

 than was absolutely necessary, kept him 
 on a very spare diet. He had been ter- 
 rified into docility, and, on enlarging his 
 bill of fare, I honestly told him, that his 
 health was in his own hands; that tem- 
 perance would preserve it, and that excess 
 in eating would shorten his life. From 
 this well-meant caution he drew an in- 
 ference perfectly useless. He would eat 
 nothing that Doctor Douglas did not 
 order; and during the course of a fort- 
 night I received my fee, for directing his- 
 cook to boil his mutton and make his 
 panada. I saw the machine was going^ 
 on well ; and, without farther concern, 
 took his superfluous gold for advice and 
 controul so beneficial to him. Not, how- 
 ever, classing him with my sick patients, 
 I one morning omitted my visit. The fol- 
 lowing evening as I called on passing his 
 door,^^ I was questioned on the cause of 
 viy neglect. He had expected me in the 
 morning. * I had a great desire for a

 when stronger. I now mentioned the 
 melancholy accident Avhich had engaged 
 me the whole of the day. A man work- 
 ing" on the roof-beams of a house had 
 fallen ; he had broken his thigh, and, as 
 it was supposed, had fractured his head. 
 It appeared that this unfortunate man 
 had been Sir Peregrine's carpenter, but 
 had incurred his sore displeasure by two 
 offences equally unpardonable. The first 
 was, refusing him his vote for the candi-

 could read ; and with this dangerous talent 
 he had discovered, that he was not alto- 
 gether a piece of elm or oak. ' And was it 
 for this fellow, doctor, that Sir Peregrine 
 Lofley was neglected?* said he, rising 
 from an easy- chair, with much resent- 
 ment; i surely you must know that he

 to judge of his fractured skull, not of his

 want of attention to his visits.' He of- 
 fered his guinea : I declined it. ' This 
 was a call en passant,' observed I, * but 
 it has led to an explanation of your ex- 
 pectations. These, Sir Peregrine, may, 
 on certain occasions, be regarded by me, 
 as not less incumbent on your medical at- 
 tendant's observance, than they appear 
 useless at this moment. All are men,

 delighted Sir Murdock, ** the united suf- 
 frages of every university in Europe

 can prescribe to other diseases as well as 
 you have done to pride and narrowness 
 of spirit." â€” '' The patient was heartily 
 welcome to it," replied he, with invincible 
 gravity. *' I am not an ill-natured man, 
 Sir Murdock, and when a good action of 
 this sort falls in my way I conceive it to

 ** I wish I could give you a special

 physic to those who do not ask for it," 
 observed the mild Greenwood ; *' you

 incurable by neglect."â€”'* Is not that your 
 fault," asked he, smiling; ** you are too 
 tender and compassionate. The diet you 
 prescribe ot self-knowledge and self-dis- 
 cipline, will not do for all constitutions. 
 Some ;need caustics and the probcy and 
 with such patients will Douglas exercise

 as I thought, been rather too tender of 
 a foible of his own. His national preju- 
 dices had not been pruned. " Scotland 
 was the genial soil of philosophy, cour- 
 age, and honour," The conversation

 an argumentative form. Malcolm with 
 delight listened to his father's eloquence. 
 Stimulated hy his opponents, Mr. Green- 
 wood and the captain, and supporting 
 Douglas's arguments, he forgot the past; 
 and brought forth his long-concealed 
 stories of knowledge, with an animation 
 which marked the acuteness of his mind 
 and the strength of his memory. 
 
 Wherefore is it, my dear Lucy, that so 
 many are found who, in the pride of 
 reason, appear to forget the feeble tenure 
 on which depends their boasted privileges; 
 their justly prized prerogatives ? The pul- 
 sation of an artery more or less rapid

 moment suspend, and, for a 'time, anni- 
 hilate those faculties that distinguish us 
 from the brute that perishes. Are we

 UURING an interval of three or four 
 weeks, the period during which Captain 
 Flint was on his excursion to Heathcot, 
 no occurences of importance to this l)is-

 hopes of his family. Intervals of com- 
 parative ease, with that flow of spirits 
 which commonly attends this disease, 
 and which was further sustained by his 
 patience and principles, had, from time 
 to time, beguiled him in the course of 
 his unprofitable search after health. He 
 became weary of the sea, and disgusted 
 by the confinement of a -ship's cabin ; 
 and he expressed much reluctance to quit- 
 ting Lisbon, where he had wintered. His 
 friends about him strongly recommended 
 to him a retreat from the heat of the 
 summer, which was within their reach, 
 and the accustomed resort of the society 
 to which he was attached and endeared. 
 Doctor Innes, his tutor, convinced of 
 the inutility of the many cruises he had 
 patiently submitted to undertake, and 
 the necessity of amusing his mind, im- 
 mediately secured, in this delightful 
 asylum, a convenient house for his re- 
 ception, to which the family repaired in 
 the early months of the summer.

 The mutual confidence which subsisted 
 between Lord William and Horace Hard- 
 castle, was of that nature which pre- 
 cludes all concealment ; and the dejec* 
 tion of the lover's spirits was not only 
 a subject of disquietude to Lord William, 
 but of anxiety to Doctor Innes. He was 
 influenced, by the account given him of 
 the young man's difficulties, to write to 
 his uncle, Mr. Freeman ; and, stating to 
 him his fears for his nephew's health, he 
 with much earnestness expatiated at 
 large on the effects of a domineering pas- 
 sion. '' I have, my good friend," added 
 the doctor, *' said thus much of Mr. 
 Hardcastle's inclination, because I well 
 know it was implanted, and is nourished, 
 by the purest affections of his nature. 
 Oppositionr ^ill never destroy it; but it 
 checks his activity, preys on his spirits, 
 and may blast the hopes of his family. It 
 is time his father should know this. Some

 to sacrifice his happiness to a point of 
 honour." Alarmed by the seriousness of 
 this application, Mr. Freeman determined 
 to quit his beloved home, and to plead 
 in person for the lovers ; conceiving 
 that Mr. Hardcastle Avould be more ac- 
 cessible to his remonstrances, when urged 
 by an affection which had led him to 
 think Horace a match for the first woman 
 breathing, in point of merit. He was 
 successful, or rather Doctor Innes's let- 
 ter prevailed. The interdiction of wri- 
 ting was removed ; and Horace was in- 
 formed that he had only to be cheerful 
 till Miss Cowley ceased to love; knd to 
 wait patiently for Counsellor Steadman's 
 operations with the redoubtable Mr. 
 Fiamall. These letters, and the change 
 of measures which Mr. Hardcastle had 
 adopted, were carefully concealed from 
 Miss Cowley. Horace had been mentioned 
 as not only depressed but indisposed ^ and 
 the confederacy who had jointly aided in

 the victory over his good father, con- 
 curred with Miss Hardcastle that it was 
 more prudent to leave Miss Cowley in 
 repose, and to Horace the pleasure of 
 telling his own tale. Mr. Freeman, con- 
 tented with these advantages, and en- 
 couraged by JMr. Steadman's concur- 
 rence, with whom he had an interview 
 in London, in his way to Heathcot, re- 
 turned home. Captain Flint and Miss 
 Howard's arrival immediately followed. 
 Some conversation, relative to her be- 
 loved brother, led Miss Hardcastle to say 
 to her guests, that she had been very 
 unhappy from the time he had left Eng- 
 land : *' but Heaven be praised," added 
 .she, with unguarded warmth, *' we shall 
 be happy soon !" â€” '' Do you expect your

 From Miss Cowley to Miss Hardcastle. 
 
 Pray, Lucy, by M'hat enchantment 
 has it happened that Captain Flint, with 
 the loss of his idolized niece, has also 
 lost his care-worn face ? How has it hap- 
 pened that in a mail-coach, and exposed 
 to cold and fatigue, he has contrived to 
 leave behind him his rheumatic pains 
 and nervous head-achs? But our first in- 
 terview gave me a nervous head-ach, and

 Cintra, Sept. 20ih, 
 MV dear LUCY, 
 
 My last letter informed you of onr 
 intention of remaining stationary for 
 some months ; and I have now the satis- 
 faction of telling you, that I think Lord 
 William has, on the whole, gained more 
 from this climate than from any he has 
 tried, and that hitherto we have had no rea- 
 son to regret the plan we have adopted. 
 An assured refuge from the heats of 
 summer and the advantages hoped for 
 from his vicinity to the sea, have not 
 altogether failed. He has been amused, 
 his thouo'hts divested from what he calls 
 *' a cowardly flight from death," and 
 free from the inconveniences of Lisbon,

 Im allotted space. We have been con- 
 staÂ«t residents in this terrestrial paradise

 cious house and elevated situation at 
 Lisbon, being perfectly adapted to our 
 dear invalid's comforts ; and to say the 
 truth, we quitted the view of the noblest

 had not then seen Cintra 1 He had not 
 then seen from the Cabo de Penah, nor 
 from Cape Rogue, the sublime objects of 
 nature which surround them. Rocks 
 and mountains ; the expanded ocean ; 
 the wide-stretching Tagus ; plains rich in 
 cultivation; impending woods; bubbling 
 fountains, and falling cascades ! Nor had

 an adventure much more interesting to 
 myself. Twiss, Baretti, Southby's Tours

 your curiosity, as to the spot in which 
 I met with my good genii. You will 
 not wonder, that your brother seeks soli- 
 tude. My Curro *, who knows his mas-

 than he is, for the early dawn ; about 
 that hour he conducts me daily to some 
 otherwise almost inaccessible haunt, and

 elegant girl, seated on a fragment of a 
 rock ; a gentleman on his knees before 
 her, and she in evident distress. The 
 narrow path admitted of no deviation; 
 I was obliged to pass the supposed

 stopped, and learned, that fearful of 
 trusting herself to the sagacious 'animal 
 she had rode, she had left her party at 
 the Cork convent*, preferring to walk. 
 With a shoe of this fashion,'' added the 
 gentleman producing a green satin 
 slipper, which might have rivalled Cin-

 our disaster ; the heel snapped, and here 
 we are, with a sprained ancle ! The 
 husband, rather than the lover, appeared 
 in this observation; and my idea was 
 confirmed ; for the pretty creature, rub- 
 hing the ancle with a hand which did 
 not disgrace it, displayed a wedding 
 ling; and with assumed gaiety, said,

 would be well." The gentleman, as in 
 duty bound, assisted her in mounting his 
 own; and with the utmost caution, we 
 proceeded down to the village. Having

 timid charge unaffectedly thanked me 
 for my goodness ; and in reply to her 
 companion's raillery on being such ai 
 coward, she remarked the superiority of 
 the beast she was on, to the wretched 
 animal they had lent her at the hotel ; 
 adding, that the satisfaction of leaving 
 him feeding, was one motive for hec 
 preferring to walk. " I might have 
 guessed as much," replied her companion;; 
 "but after all, my dear Margaret, yoa 
 have been more charitable than fortunate.

244 LADY MACLAIRN, 
 
 â€” ** That may be," answered she with 
 cheerfulness, " but I shall have time to 
 rest on ship-board." This observation 
 led to my being informed tliat she was 
 going with her brother to Jamaica, 
 where her husband was expecting her. 
 ** It will be a long and a tedious time 
 before we shall meet," added she with 
 tenderness: ** and when I think of the

 a good sailor, Margaret, and with fair 
 winds we shall go quicker than we do at

 plied she with emotion. 
 
 We reached the hotel, and I took my 
 leave of the strangers. The following

 to the next room, introduced me to his 
 sister, and another lady whom I recol- 
 lected as being the -wife of a merchant 
 resident in Lisbon. The name of Flint 
 had visibly discomposed me; and for 
 some moments I had only to Hsten to the 
 reiterated acknowledgments of the deh- 
 cate Mrs. Flint. She was still at the 
 breakfast- table, and with the most per- 
 fect contentment she told me that her 
 friend had not only enjoined her the 
 penance of remaining in her bed longer, 
 by some hours, than was her custom, but 
 had doomed her to the sofa for the 
 whole day.; and with a sw^et and amiable 
 frankness of manner she reminded me of 
 my little services ; intreatingme to assist 
 her again, and by dining with them to 
 make her peace with her brother, who 
 had threatened to reduce her to a pigmy- 
 height by obliging her to wear flat-heeled 
 shoes. I bowTd my .acceptance of this

 me to my seat. At length I summoned 
 up resolution to ask her, whether she 
 was connected with the Flints of Tare-

 brother, without hesitation, answered^ 
 that his sister was the wife of Mr. Philip.

 ** Then you know Miss Cowley," said I 
 
 , trembling with agitation, " you know 
 she is atTarefield with Lady Maclairn?" 
 â€” " Margaret knows little of her hus- 
 band's family," answered he, ** having 
 always resided in Scotland." I was 
 silenced, and a certain air of embarrass- 
 ment was dispelled from Mrs. Flint's, 
 countenance by the lady's asking her 
 brother, whether it was still his intention? 
 to leave Lisbon on the Saturday. He 
 replied in the affirmative, allowing for 
 winds and tides ; then turning to me, he 
 asked me to take a ramble in the gardens 
 of Penab Yerde, I complied ; but onj

 sallying out we found the potent rays of 
 the mid-day sun inconvenient ; and al- 
 lured by a fountain within two hundred 
 paces of the hotel, we took our seats by 
 it, under the umbrageous shelter of the 
 cork and elm-trees. 
 
 I immediately began the conversa- 
 tion by apologizing for the warmth and 
 earnestness of my interrogations relative 
 to Tarefield ; and proceeded to inform 
 him of so much of Miss Cowley's his- 
 tory as was needful, in order to account 
 for the interest I had discovered in 
 relation to her. In the course of my 
 little narrative, I spoke of Mr. Flamall, 
 as having by his authority removed his 
 ward from friends devoted to her, and to 
 "whom she Avas attached; and I added that, 
 having learned from you the repugnance 
 with which Miss Cowley had quitted her 
 wonted asylum, I wish to know, that, 
 with Lady Maclairn, her situation had

 been such as slie merited. ' " We know 
 none of Philip's connections," answered 
 he, carelessly lading* the Hmpid water 
 with a brass bason attached by a chain 
 to the fountain; " but if Philip's mother 
 resembles him, she mast be worthy of 
 the guest you have described ; for he is a 
 good and an Jionest man. For the rest of 
 his relations, to give you my honest 
 opinion of them, I do not beheve they 
 would give this cup of water towards the 
 happiness of any one. As for his precious 
 uncle Flamall, he is a complete scoun- 
 drel." â€” ** Then vou know him !" obser- 
 ved I, eagerly. *' Yes, yes," answered 
 he, with warmth, ** I know him, and I 
 trust he will know Sincla'u^ before many 
 months elapse. Pie will not be the first 
 rascal this arm has chastised !" â€” " Would 
 to God," cried I, ** that mine could

 jt should strengthen his own." I now, 
 my deiir Lucy, more expHcitiy detailed 
 to him Miss Cowley's connection with 
 this villain: and if my own wretched 
 anxieties appeared, I could not help it. 
 He listened to me with the deepest atten- 
 tion, and grasping my hand, swore a 
 solemn oath, to search to the bottom of 
 a business so perfectly consonant to the 
 man's character and conduct. " Hear 
 my story, Mr. Hardcastle, and then 
 judge whether your Miss Cowley's cause 
 can be in better hands,'* added he, in an 
 impressive tone. ** I do not believe she 
 would need a defender whilst an honest 
 man can be found ; but to me she shall be 
 another sister, and with Margaret's 
 injuries will I remember Miss Cowley's!

 having destined me to the same pursuits 
 in life, from which he had risen to re- 
 spectable opulence. I had quitted my 
 father's study, who was a minister of the 
 kirk of Scotland, some time before his 
 decease; and under the favour of my 
 good uncle had then risen nearly to my 
 present station, to wit, commander of 
 one of his ships, instead of one of my 
 <rwn, which is at present in this port. I 
 was fortunately not too remote from my 
 father for his last blessing and embrace. 
 I had also the consolation to find, that 
 my uncle was disposed to render my 
 mother and sister comfortable ; an atten- 
 tion pecuharly necessary in the low con- 
 dition of my father's finances. I am eight 
 or nine years older than Margaret, and, 
 both in principles and affection, disposed 
 to perform the relative duties of a father 
 and a brother. Such were my sentiments 
 when I left her, after tlie events which I

 have mentioned, to return to America. 
 During au absence of three years from 
 my native home, I heard with content- 
 ment of my mother's tranquillity, and of 
 the improvement of the poor little girl 
 you have seen. She was, Mr. Hardcastle, 
 my delight and pride from her cradle; 
 and I knew that in my mother's care, her 
 innocence was secure. This spring 1 had 
 an opportunity I had long desired ; and 
 I failed not to avail myself of it to visit 
 my mother. I was so pressed for time, 
 and urged by impatience^ that I arrived 
 unexpectedly ; and with some surprise I 
 found that my mother had given up her 
 house in Edinburgh, and lived near it, at 
 a small village indicated to me. On 
 reaching her abode, the cause of her 
 removal was apparent in the emaciated 
 form which poor Margaret exhibited. I 
 was told she had been some months de- 
 clining in health ; and tha^country air

 had been judged more favourable to her, 
 than that of the town. AVe are no adepts 
 at hypocrisy. My mother's agitations 
 betrayed her. On my asking whether any 
 love disappointment had laid the founda- 
 tlni of the illness, she burst into tears; 
 and unable to contain the secret, told me 
 the sorrows of her aching heart. 
 
 '* My sister had for a playmate and 
 friend an amiable girl, somewhat older 
 than herself, of the name of Montrose. 
 They Avere near neighbours, and their 
 parents were in the habits of familiar 
 and friendly intercourse. On the death 
 of Mr. Montrose, his widoAv, unwilling 
 to give up her house, received, but with 
 extreme circumspection, boarders. Phi- 
 lip Flint was recommended to her by her 
 usual adviser, an old friend of her bus- 
 band and a professor in the college.

 for the suitable inmate of a house re- 
 inaikaWy sober and well regulated. 
 Young Montrose was a pupil of the 
 same gentleman, and had already distin- 
 guished himself for talents and applica- 
 tion. I will abridge my romance, by 
 telling you at once the result of his love 
 advances to Margaret. Their measures 
 were wonderfully prudent, when you 
 take into the account the age of the 
 lovers, who could only reckon eight or 
 nine and thirty years between them ; and 
 those of their faitliful and zealous confi- 
 dants, who, in their calculation might 
 have a right to four or five more. With 
 the assistance of Montrose, they were 
 married, and with the consummate pru- 
 dence of an old civilian this young man 
 saw, that the marriage was duly and 
 legally valid, according to the laws of 
 Scotland, his friend being anxiously 
 solicitous on this point; pleading his 
 dread of his despotical uncle, and the

 influence he maintained over every branch 
 of his family. A few short weeks of 
 pej^fect happiness were the prelude to 
 Margaret's cares. The fond husband 
 took all the blame on himself like an 
 honest fellow ; and at my mother's feet 
 made a confession which subdued her,; 
 for it finished by imploring her pity and 
 consideration of his wife's condition; 
 urging her to permit the marriage cere- 
 mony to be renewed in her presence, if 
 she were dissatisfied with the proofs 
 which her daughter could produce of the- 
 legality of those vows which had united 
 them. ^ My own marriage was not more 
 binding,' added my dear mother, *and 
 what could I do, Henry ?' * Exactly that 
 which you have done,' answered I. ^ Pro- 
 ceed.' * Nothing could be more amiable 
 than his conduct was to Margaret and 
 myself,' continued my mother,' nor more 
 prudent. He explained his situation to

 certain he should have a friend- in his 
 mother, and that his sister Lucretia 
 would make him independent the day he 
 was of age; for that she hated to see 
 him controuled by a man so tyrannical 
 as Mr. Flamall.' A letter from this sister, 
 broke in upon our comforts : it was af- 
 fectionate and tender in the extreme ; it 
 contained bank notes to the amount of 
 a hundred and twenty pounds, and a 
 letter from Mr. Oliver Flint, his eldest 
 brother, with an invitation to come over 
 to him to Jamaica.' My mother then men- 
 tioned Philip's being a posthumous child, 
 with those particulars which you know 
 relative to his father's second marriage, 
 and extraordinary will," continued Mr. 
 Sinclair, " which particulars I pass over. 
 Miss Flint urged him, in th'^ letter, to 
 avail himself of his brother's good inten- 
 tions. ' You will,' added she, ' by this 
 means shake off the yoke, which now 
 oppresses you more than it serves you.

 amply for him, on condition he paid

 sustained. A double letter was delivered 
 to my mother by the servant-maid, in 
 my sister's presence. She saw the ad- 
 dress, and uttering a faint scream, in- 
 stantly fainted. The contents of Philip's 
 letter will better please you, than a . de- 
 scription of the alarm which it produced," 
 added Sinclair smiling. ** To my mother 
 he recommends the utmost caution in 
 the delivery of the one enclosed ' to his 
 beloved wife, to his long. lost and only 
 blessing.' To Margaret he writes with 
 incoherent joy. His brother Oliver was 
 stiled * his saving angel,' *his more than 
 father:' * Providence in rescuing him from 
 the blackest treachery, had in its mercy, 
 he confidently trusted, preserved her.

 she could have believed him a faithless

 had been employed to destroy him, had 
 reached her.' This letter concluded with 
 ample instructions, to repair immediately 
 to London ; where his brother's agent 
 would receive her, and provide for her 
 immediate passage to him. An unlimit- 
 ed credit on this gentleman, with a draft 
 for two hundred pounds on a banker at 
 Edinburgh, were inclosed, with a posi- 
 tive injunction written by the good old 
 man, to take care of herself as well as of

 inquiries respecting this Flamall. From 
 what I could collect from Margaret 
 relative to her husband's opinion of this 
 worthy uncle, I made no doubt of his 
 having been tlie cause of all the mischief. 
 The character he bears in London justif

 I am deserted for ^plmn-cake, which will 
 not be eaten till Twelfth-day at Dur-

 Wisely, however, reflecting that I had not

 even the rheumatism is kept in check. 
 She was quite amazed how I could 
 " brave such deadly cold weather ; and 
 yet I looked like a full-blown rose, and 
 so cheerful ! But that did not amaze her, 
 for in warming other people's hearts my 
 own would always be gay." On leaving her

 friends of my own ; and cheered by a ft\^

 the finest description of a frost-piece 
 that the most poetical imagination ever 
 composed, would not please Mary, at

 will spare myself the disgrace of being 
 censured as the dullest of mortals in this

 probably one reason for my yawning over

 it, still borrow the book from Deborah ; 
 and with the pictures recall the days 
 when the restless Rachel stood for hours 
 quietly listening to her expounding his-

 youth borne on the wing of Hope, Fancy, 
 and Desire, to an elevation remote from 
 his safe abode. Careless of the approach- 
 ing stoiTn he still advances in his heed- 
 less career, till nature, exhausted, prompts 
 him to pause. He does so, and with 
 terror and amasement beholds the black-

 thunder roll over his defenceless head*

 friendly sun, from time to time warned 
 her, by his retiring brightness, that he 
 had something else to do besides gladden- 
 ing her path. At length I took the 
 alarm, and on looking towards his late 
 refulgent road, saw him covered with a 
 black curtain, which, from time to time, 
 he put aside, to see whether the heedless 
 wanderer had wisdom and was seeking a 
 refuge. 1 had the wisdom to speed as 
 fast as I could to the miller's house, which 
 was the nearest; but, like my emblem, 
 I had not learned to know, that sailing 
 with a fair wind, and an adverse one, 
 made some difference in the course of the 
 ship. I had now a north-easter in my 
 teeth ; and as if in return for my temerity, 
 he rattled with his rude blast a shower of 
 hailstones about my ears, which, though 
 they did not subdue my courage, greatly 
 discomfited me. The gracious luminary 
 once more peeped through his veil and 
 smiled on me. I had gained the last

 field between me and my retreat M^hen I 
 took advantage of the hedge in order to 
 adjust my shawl more about my face, 
 which smarted with the keen blasts, and 
 to recover my panting breath for renew- 
 ed buifettings. At this providential mor

 view by some hurdles, crying most lar 
 mentably, and repeatedly sayuig, '^ Get 
 up, Johnny! pray get up! let us go. home! 
 I will go without you !" I removed this 
 hurdle, and perceived the mourner in the 
 hollow path. He was a stout boy of 
 about nine years old,^ and was endea- 
 vouring to raise from the ground one of 
 about seven, who appeared insensible. 
 The danger was apparent ; I flew to the 
 children. *' Where is your home?" asked 
 I. '* At the mill," answered the shivering 
 boy. *' Pray wake brother Johnny, he 
 does not mind me ; and my granny will 
 scold me if leave him, because I took 
 him out without leave," Unmindful of

 this petition, with the sturdy boy's help, 
 I wrapped the torpid child in my shawl, 
 which, as you know, is of the largest size, 
 and I hastened to the house, with the of- 
 fending and terrified culprit. He com- 
 plained that he was weary and must rest; 
 M'hilst I, with an air of authority, dragged 
 him on till I became nearly exhausted 
 myself, though remote from his danger; 
 for I did not even feel it was cold, so great 
 was my terror respecting the poor child 
 I had left behind me, and the dread of 
 seeing the one with me refuse to advance; 
 for he hung back from time to time, say- 
 ing that I hurt him, that he would sit 
 down a while, and bade me go on with- 
 out him. 
 
 From this terrible dilemma I >vas re- 
 lieved by meeting with a servant of the 
 house, who was looking for the vagrants. 
 He called to another, and I was soon 
 reheved from my burden, who had con- 
 quered me, and had composedly laid

 person who bore the child in his arms to 
 the house, and the other man went for- 
 wards to the succour of the poor aban- 
 doned boy. 
 
 A neat and genteel-looking woman 
 met us in the yard, M'hom, from her terror 
 and grief, I supposed to be their mother. 
 I tried to allay her fears, but finding 
 that was not possible, contented myself 
 with supplying her duty. She carried 
 the boy to the kitchen fire, and, weeping 
 bitterly, began to chafe his hands. My 
 authoritative voice was at length heard, 
 and in spite of his outcries he was put to 
 bed in the blankets. Happily the village 
 farrier was present, and supported me in my 
 opinion. He said he had read some publish- 
 ed cases of the Humane Society, and that he 
 would answer for the other child if they 
 would trust to him. The child appeared, 
 and my shawl having been useful, he was 
 judged to be in no danger by the doctor,

 with snow. The children being consi- 
 dered as safe, I was next thought of. 
 Wit;h many excuses the young woman 
 led me through a large brick-floored par- 
 lour to a neat staircase, which conducted 
 us to a very pretty snug room, in v/hich 
 was quietly seated an old lady knitting; 
 and who had, as it appeared, escaped 
 the general horror of the family in the 
 kitchen, by being somewhat deaf and 
 lame. She looked surprised by my m?. 
 trusion, but instantly enquired whether 
 the children were returned. The daughter, 
 with more self-command than I expect- 
 ed, replied in tne affirmative, adding 
 that I had been so good as to lead them 
 liome. Her face betrayed, however, in 
 part, the disaster, and I assured the grand- 
 mother that the danger was past and both 
 children doino' well. Her thanks for mv 
 services were followed by her ** being-

 she thought something warm and com-

 entirely of the same opinion. Susan was 
 dispatched to hasten matters below stairs; 
 whilst with officious zeal I was placed 
 in her own white dimity easy chair, and 
 the hearth was replenished with fuel. 
 The neatness of the apartment, the order 
 which presided at the dining-tahle, the

 of my friends at the hall, and dispatched

 â‚¬oach came for me. I added a verbal 
 commission- to the note, and desired that 
 the person who was to carry it, might 
 be cautioned to say nothing of the cause 
 of my delay. The old lady heard more 
 of this message than I intended. She 
 turned pale, and with much emotion 
 said, she was sure the truth had been 
 kept from her : she vv^ould see her chil- 
 dren, and if they could not come to her 
 she would be carried to them. A more 
 particular detail of the disaster followed ; 
 and her daughter assured her both her 
 boys were in a fine perspiration, and 
 the apothecary had no doubt but they 
 would be fit to truant again on the mor- 
 row. The grandmother still looked incre- 
 dulous. ** My dear Madam," observed I,

 added she, ** their aunt is father and

 sort of apology for her carelessness, that 
 the eldest boy had persuaded Johnny to 
 leave the mill-chamber where they were 
 playing, to go and slide with some boys

 now entered to say that the carriage was

 forgotten my wrappers this morning, in 
 crossing the passage to Lady Maclairn's 
 apartment. She appealed to Lady Mac-

 blood could be in a state to resist cold. 
 I had just finished my last moral infer- 
 ence, and I could not at once be made 
 to tremble at the tempered breeze of a 
 covered passage. I argued in favour of 
 my own theory ; she maintained that I

 had more confidence in my strength than 
 was prudent. "Alas!" replied I, "how 
 many wretches, more feeble than my- 
 self, bide the pelting of the" pitiless 
 storm !" 
 
 " Poor naked wretches, with houseless 
 heads and unfed sides who protects 
 them from cold, my dear friend ?" "Who 
 indeed !" replied she, with the glow of 
 pity we hav'C so often remarked, " who 
 but that Being whose providential care 
 is M'ith many a subject of speculation, 
 with some a doubt, and with multi- 
 tudes neither remembered nor acknow-

 Do you know I begin to suspect that 
 Mrs. Allen has taken an unfair advantage 
 of me ; for seeing since the arrival of the 
 Lisbon packet that my charity is enlarg- 
 ed to " good will to all men," she fan- 
 cies it admits of no limitation, and that 
 Miss Flint stands a chance of coming in 
 for a share. She has therefore trepanned

 if I am to credit Mrs. Alien, it has some-

 But I am becoming more placable, and

 you will say, that even Horace Hardcas-

 which my fond imagination has raised

 me to whose influence was your dear 
 mother indebted for a docihty on my

 the untamed rebel to all constraint. To 
 whom am I indebted for patience, and 
 forbearance now? What moral attain-

 I think, if I can judge of myself, that I 
 am ungentle by nature, and so fond of 
 freedom, as to love but little the shackles 
 which some so eagerly seek. I am con- 
 fident however, that I have one ingredi-

 often has his reproving eye recalled me 
 to obedience and submission ! What has

 ertions, and petty triumphs over my tur-

 with pleasure, and heard his joy express-

 be as gentle and amiable as my mother !" 
 I am persuaded that Heaven has destined 
 Horace Hardcastle to be my guide and 
 my protector. I should faint and tire 
 in the road of duty with a companion 
 whose paths I had to chuse and point 
 out. But with Horace Hardcastle I shall

 Finding I began to be weary of my good 
 friend Eolus(foronemay be tired of what 
 is good, by having too much of it,) I de- 
 termined, in order to vary the scene, to 
 pay a morning visit to my new friends at 
 the mill. " I should like," said I, ** to see 
 these boys now warmed into life by a 
 pinch of snuff and snow water." The 
 whole junto took the alarin. The roads 
 were impassable; I should get my death 
 of cold. I only laughed at their prognos- 
 tics, and persisted in my intention, urg- 
 ing that the thaw, which has began here, 
 had moderated the severity of the air. 
 Lady Maclairn, always ready at an ex- 
 pedienty recollected that the coach- wheels 
 wanted some repair, and her cook some 
 corn to be ground for the fowls ; and 
 that at all events it waÂ§ better for nie to 
 ride than to walk in the dirt. I readily 
 conceded to this opinion, and, being 
 wrapped up in pelisses and shawls, to the 
 exact resemblance of the bag of corn, I

 my opinion, more indicativ^e of good

 go on.. The old lady was giving the boys 
 their reading-lesion when I entered, in a

 making a muslin gown. My entrance iti^

 children was followed by their being dis-

 with unaffected anxiety, dictated to them 
 their speech of gratitude to the dear 
 good young lady who had saved their 
 lives. This ceremony performed, they 
 with plowing cheeks retired to enjoy^ 
 unconstrainedly, their existence. My 
 observations were next directed to the

 beautiful muslin robe Susan ^vas trim- 
 ming with very iiue edging: it was made 
 with taste, in the Circassian stile, as the 
 fasliion has named it. '' It is intended 
 for a bride who lives in this neighbour- 
 hood/' observed Susan, with a suppressed 
 smile ; ** perhaps you may have seen the 
 young lady : she rides frequently on 
 horseback." Finding this insufficient for 
 my information, she proceeded to tell me 
 tliat it was Miss Gubbins she meant, who 
 was going to be married to a young 
 farmer. * 'Her father," added she, '*k ows 
 what is to be done in that line of busiuess 
 by experience : he has got a good fortune 
 by the plow." I instantly recollected 
 having met this Miss Gubbins on her 
 road ; and the idea of her singularly short 
 and corpulent person, in a Circassian 
 robe, was too ludicrous for my gravity. 
 *' Dear me ! " observed the old lady, who 
 had joined in my laugh with great glee,

 straw or black silk bonnet is supplied by 
 velvet, flowers, and feathers. It was 
 only yesterday that a dairy-maid was here 
 to get Susan to shorten the waist of her 
 Sunday-gown, and to make it draw round 
 the neck with a frill like the ladies'." â€” 
 " My mother makes very free with my 
 customers, Madam," observed Susan, 
 smiling; " she forgets that those who 
 keep a stall in "oanity fair live by the 
 folly of those who buy; and to say the 
 truth, so do I sometimes, for it is amaz- 
 ing to see the money now expended by a 
 class of people who, a few years since were

 Susan folded up the robe, and made her 
 apology for quitthig me. She was going 
 to her shop with ]\Iiss Gubbins in the 
 gig, which was in sight, and she left us. 
 I mentioned my intention of employing 
 her to the good old lady, and engaged 
 to speak to the ladies of the hall, not 
 doubting but we should want Circassian 
 robes with the rest of our neighbours.

 amazing rapidity, '* one can hardly be-

 the day or two after I had seen my hus-

 port. My poor husband," continued she, 
 brushing away a tear, " was well known 
 at Chelsea; he was a boatman, and always 
 called * honest Frank' by the gentry ; 
 for he was sober, diligent, and civil. He 
 lost his precious life in endeavouring to 
 save a man from drowning who was in- 
 toxicated, and could do nothing forhim*

 relief. But it w^as Mrs. Flint who poured 
 the oil into my wounds. She it was 
 who raised my eyes to God, and bade 
 me trust to the never- failing friend of 
 the widow and the fatherless. She found 
 I was expert at needle- work, and she 
 furnished me with plenty of it, besides 
 assisting me with money, for my rent and

 When my daughter Jenny was fourteen,

 she fixed her with an old lady, a widow, 
 with whom she went to live at Newcas- 
 tle. Jane was a clever, active girl, and could 
 read and write well. Her lady became so 
 fond of her that she made her, as one may 
 say, her favoured child, and when she 
 died left her all her clothes and Hnen 
 with three hundred pounds. She was 
 too well trained to forget her mother in 
 her prosperity ; and on her marrying a 
 farmer, to whom she had been sometime 
 engaged, I removed, and settled at New- 
 castle, Jane being fixed near that town. 
 Thus I lost sight of Mrs. Flint, and 
 escaped, in part, the sorrow of her death, 
 which happened soon after. But I 
 shall never forget her ! No, nor the 
 angel who used to accompany her to 
 see us, w^ith her pockets filled with cakes 
 for Frank, who was nearly of her own age. 
 I think I now see her putting on Susan's 
 new shoes, and exulting over her, be- 
 cause she could step alone* But she waÂ«

 altogether so beautiful as her mother; 
 for Mrs. Howard liad height, and more 
 vivacity; but if she is as good, it will be

 lady, time went on with me, sometimes 
 sunshine, sometimes cloudy; but the 
 widow's friend was always near me ! My 
 Susan was an apprentice to a milliner and 
 mantua-maker. Mr. Webster, my son-in- 
 law, grew wealthy every day ; and acted 
 by me like a child. Frank gave us some 
 sorrow ; he was discontented with living 
 at the farm, and wished to be a sailor. I 
 had suffered enough from water ! and I 
 could not be brought to consent. Be- 
 sides, his brother loved him, and had 
 promised to make a man of him, if he 
 would continue to be diligent and sober;

 Frank secretly left us, and for a. time

 The account he gave me of Mrs. How-

 she took delight in helping Susan in

 always been, desponding; and we changed 
 the subject. That very day week, she 
 went again to the attorney's, and again 
 we fancied that she returned home more 
 cheerful. Some few days after she went 
 again, teUing us that we should think her 
 a gossip ; but that she should drink tea 
 at home. We consequently waited some 
 little time for her; but concluding her 
 friends had detained her, were just set 
 down, when she arrived in a sedan chair, 
 and as we thought, in a dying condition. 
 The people who attended her, kept a

 she had been seized with a fit in the shop,

 Stranger. She was hurried and confused 
 till near morning, when she slept, and 
 awoke composed. Wc had soon the sa- 
 tisfaction of seeing her better ; but her 
 melancholy was more apparent than ever ; 
 and from that time she never left her 
 room.â€” On her sending me one day to 
 I\f r. Lloyd's on business, soon after her 
 recovery, I asked her why she would not 
 take my arm and try to go herself, the 
 morning being so pleasant. * No, nol'

 surprise ; for I said to myself, assuredly 
 God has created in her a new heart ; and 
 it is not for me to judge her. She wept 
 most grievously ; and from what I could 
 gather, I thought she had been seduced 
 by Mr. Flamall when a young woman, 
 and had thus become subservient to Miss 
 Flint's cruel purposes. She perceived my 
 suspicions, and redoubling her tears, told 
 me that I was quite wide of the mark; 
 for that she had been always too homely 
 for his pleasures, though not so for pur- 
 poses more base and wicked than I sus- 
 pected. * But,' added she, with a look of 
 despair, and wringing her poor hands, 
 *for God's sake, do not question me far- 
 ther. I cannot shew the villain without 
 bringing destruction on the heads of the 
 innocent : and that I will never do ! Be-

 in such a way, that I persuaded her to 
 open her mind to a clergyman ; but slie 
 always said, that God would bring the 
 truth to hght in his own time ; she would 
 not be the ruin of more of her dear lady's 
 children. She even solicited the visits of 
 the minister notwithstanding this; but 
 always chose that either myself or Susan 
 should be present, and he was struck by 
 her piety and submission. She never got 
 the better of the surprise of meeting with 
 Flamall. The doctor said, she died of a 
 consumption ; but I know it was of a 
 troubled conscience, and a broken heart ; 
 although a penitent one. I was with her 
 the last night she breathed in this world. 
 I shall never forget her 1 Such a dying-

 * Oh, do not let him hang me!' said 
 she, strugghng and tearing off the cap 
 on her head, * I nursed you ; I was faith- 
 ful to you ; I loved you as the child of 
 my own body ! Poor child ! you could 
 not help it!' 'Help what!' asked I. 
 ' That Mrs. Howard died for want of

 another struggle for breath. Then she 
 knew me, and said, ' Pray for me, I am 
 dying. All is over with me !' So, I 
 soothed her ; and she pressed my hand,

 of what passed in my mind, when I found

 proclaimed their unworthiness. JM}^ sis-

 mentioned this posthumous child with 
 tenderness and promising hopes. Her 
 adoption of him pleased me, even be- 
 fore I was childless myself; and as it 
 Avas obvious she had an influence wnth

 was not acceptable. He \Vas, or affected 
 to be, charmed with his situation, and 
 from certain hints and well-timed dis- 
 plays of his capacity for business, my 
 friend made him very advantageous of- 
 fers of employing him in the regulation 
 of his accounts. He accepted them, and 
 from that time resided (with Mr. Cowley,

 who became attached to him more and 
 more. About this period my poor friend 
 received his daughter's picture from 
 England ; and I was summoned to cele- 
 brate its arrival with others of his ac- 
 quaintance. Curious to see the change 
 which time had produced, on an infant 
 I had carried in my arms many and many 
 a time, I went at an early hour, and 
 found poor Cowley fondly surveying it. 
 I was struck by the beauty of the image 
 before me; but it had recalled to poor 
 Henry his lost wife, and he yielded with- 
 out restraint to his tender regrets. I 
 endeavoured to soothe him, and amongst 
 other things said, that his girl pleased 
 me, though she had his saucy eyes, add- 
 ing, ' Suppose, Henry, we make up a 
 match between us ? My boy is as hand- 
 some as your girl ; and he will have 
 reason to be satisfied, if she is only half 
 as good and as beautiful as her mother 
 was.' *She has my saucy eyes, you say/

 replied he, fixing his own on the picture; 
 * if she liave my spirit also, she will 
 wish to chiise a husband for herself; 
 and I am very certain, she is well quali- 
 fied to chuse wisely.' He continued to 
 expatiate to Mr. Flamall, on her good 
 fortune in having been brought up by 
 Mrs, Hardcastky and with much satis- 
 faction continued to enumerate his daugh- 
 ter's various attainments, and the proofs 
 he had in his letters from her, of good 
 sense and discernment. This merely ac- 
 cidental conversation produced on Fla- 
 mall's mind the first suggestions of his 
 ambition ; I have no doubt of this ; for 
 he frequently mentioned to me the ad- 
 vantages which would result from an 
 alliance with my old friend ; and withal 
 intimated, that he was certain that Philip 
 was a favourite with Mr. Cowley. More- 
 over, he frequently joked with us on the 
 subject, and advised Cowley to send for 
 his daughter. I had, however, by this

 time seen enough of my youngster, to 
 suspect that he was in love elsewhere. I 
 ohserved, that whenever Miss Cowley's 
 picture was the theme of praise, Philip 
 paid his tribute of admiration as much , 
 to the drapery as tht face; and that with 
 the young ladies, he was more pensive, 
 than with their mothers. But hourly, 
 my dear Sir, did he gain upon my heart ; 
 for in every thouglit, word, and. f^ee(\, 
 he brought to my remembrance my own 
 dear boy, the last of my mortal bless- 
 ings 1 But let this pass : you will soon 
 know this worthy lad. I had soon after, 
 having given up listening to Flamall's 
 match-making scheme, the shock of 
 seeing Mr. Cowley seized with his first 
 apoplectic fit at my table. He recovered 
 from this attack; but he was a changed 
 man. He was not insensible of his dimi- 
 nished strength; and his conversations 
 frequently turned on his settling his 
 worldly affairs, before he left me. On

 two natural children. * They are mine,

 ' and their mother is as unconscious of 
 evil as themselves. I have appointed them 
 a provision and a guardian which will 
 be a security for my honour, when I am 
 dust. They will perceive that I was in 
 affection a parent, when I thought of 
 you for my substitute in duty. Tell me, 
 have I taxed your friendship too hea- 
 vily?' â€” ' You have always been more 
 than a match for me, Henry,' said I 
 taking his trembling hand; * but for 
 once, I have the ascendency; for without 
 consulting you, or having a doubt of 
 your friendship, you have for years been 
 my appointed executor, and the destined

 he; * Hardcastle will continue to watch

 pursued he, ' of whom my dear girl has

 father has for some years banished this

 never dropped a hint of this suspicion

 live to reach England, and find this

 well managed the talents given me.' This 
 conversation finished by his repeatedly 
 thanking me for the comfort I had given 
 to his dejected spirits ; and some short 
 time after, he told me that he had finish- 
 ed his most important concerns ; and 
 should, whenever he embarked, leave 
 Marian and her little ones under my 
 roof; which promise had reconciled her 
 to his voyage. 
 
 The second shock to his enfeebled 
 frame left us little for hope. Yet he 
 again rallied; but with the loss of all 
 power in his legs, and with a general de- 
 bility, that rendered every exertion fa- 
 tiguing. He did not quit his apartment, 
 and rarely his bed, for much time toge- 
 ther. His faculties were notwithstand- 
 ing less oppressed, than after his first 
 attack ; for he was more cheerful and 
 equal in his spirits. During this term 
 of his trial, how often have I heard him

 bless me for being the agent in the hands 
 of Providence, in conducting to him 
 Mr. Flamall, who so ably went through 
 the business he was no longer in a con- 
 dition to superintend, and whose society 
 was a comfort to him ! To say the truth, 
 I was no less pleased with his conduct 
 than my friend ; ' for this fellow's talents 
 are up to every thing but honesty ,' 
 
 One morning I went as usual to Cow- 
 ley's; he was still in his bed, and the sun- 
 blinds were down in the bow- windows of 
 his spacious apartment. I stumbled on 
 entering, from the sudden transition from 
 light to darkness, against some moveable; 
 and with the utmost cheerfulness, my 
 friend said, ^VvHiy, how now, Oliver! 
 you are one of those * who love dark- 
 ness rather than light because your deeds 
 are evil ;' therefore take care of your 
 shins.' Rubbing the one offended, I 
 approached the bed, and then only per-

 and ink, and that Flamall had quitted 
 his station near it to receive me. ' You 
 are busy," observed I, thinking he was, 
 adding a codicil to his will, for such the 
 lessening obscurity discovered the parch- 
 ment to be. â€” ' I will call this evening.' 
 â€” * I had finished, my dear Oliver,' replied 
 he, grasping my hand. ' We have wish- 
 ed for your appearance ; I have only to 
 sign and seal.' He rung the bell and de- 
 sired the servant to show the gentlemen 
 into the room. His physician, with one 
 of the most respectable men at Kingston, 
 entered. â€” I retreated to the bow, and 
 passing the blind, stood in the balcony. 
 I heard him say something as an excuse 
 for having so long detained them ; and 
 he added, * I have been hearing Mr. 
 Flamall read my will once more. I now, 
 in a sound mind, declare it to be last

 about to sign in your presence.' The

 business was performed with all due for- 
 malities; and his faithful Juba, to whom 
 he had given good learning when he was 
 in England, witnessed this act of his be- 
 loved master with such emotions, that he 
 left the room the moment he had written 
 his name. Mr. Flam all asked him where 
 he should deposit the will ; and Cowley 
 answered, * in tlie cabinet.' The gen- 
 tlemen saw him place it in the cabinet, 
 which stood opposite to the foot of the 
 bed, and Cowley received the key, which 
 was attached to the chain of his watch. 
 He now called me from my post, and for 
 some time chatted with us At length 
 the gentlemen departed ; and Juba, re- 
 covered from his grief, entered with some 
 refreshment for his master. * Try and 
 get off this key/ said Cowley to him, 
 giving him the watch. He did so with- 
 out difficulty. 'There, my dear OHver,' 
 said my friend, giving it me, ' you will

 is one thing,' resumed he, * Avhich I 
 had like to have forgotten ; you will 
 find my wife's jewels and trinkets m that

 sent them to her long since, but that I 
 could not bear to see them. There is a 
 pearl necklace amongst them ; her mo- 
 ther wore it the day she was married.' 
 His voice sunk, and he burst into tears. 
 * Come, come,' said I, *my dear fellow- 
 sufferer, let us have no more of this ; get 
 well, and carry your daughter this neck- 
 lace yourself. You will find, when plac- 
 ing it on her neck as a bride, that God 
 has many comforts for you yet in store.' 
 He shook his head. â€” * I trust he has,' 
 replied he, * but they are not in this 
 world.' Flamall, who had left the room 
 with the visitors, returned, and my friend 
 changed the subject of conversation.

 tei view^. You may judge of my surprise at 
 the contents of the will, when called upon 
 to produce it. Mr. Flamall acted his part 
 to the life, but with me his villany stood 
 confessed ! I need not tell you his power 
 over poor Miss Cowley, nor Philip's sur- 
 prise that he was involved in her fate. 
 His spirits, which had visibly declined 
 from the time he had been with me, be- 
 came totally dejected, arid he passed his 
 time here in solitude. I was>certain he 
 had the same suspicions with myself; 
 and, although it went to my heart to vex 
 him, I determined to open my mind to 
 him : I did so by relating to him all I 
 have told you ; and I added, that if he 
 preferred going to England, I would go 
 witJi him and leave Tlamall * to the 
 devil's care.' â€” ' I have no wish to return 
 to England,' answered he with emotion 
 * I wish to die here, and would this hour 
 resign my breath willingly were it not 
 for you!' The po^r boy clung to my

 bosom, and wept bitterly. â€” ' Well,' said 
 I, ' we now understand one another. I 
 would sooner see you dead than Miss 
 Cowley's husband : but you may be her 
 friend; we also zvill ty^y to be cu7mmg. 
 Flam all is your uncle ; so much the worse 
 for you, and the better for him, accord-

 will leave him to an arm which will, in 
 its own time, reach him to his cost. Show 
 some alacrity in the post your uncle has 
 assigned you, and be vigilant over etc- 
 counts which relate to the heiress he has 
 gained for you. Inventories will not be 
 marriage articles, Philip, but they may 
 be evidences of Avhat I^Iiss Cowley is

 man, though not as a suitor forced upon 
 her. We do not Mant her money, but

 Miss Cowley, but complained bitterly 
 that his uncle persecuted him daily on 
 the subject of the marriage, and highly 
 resented his reluctance to the voyage to 
 England. About this time the partner 
 of an old and respectable house of cor- 
 respondence I had in London, arrived 
 here. He met Flam all at my table, for I 
 was a cunning man you will observe, and 
 preserved appearances on many accounts. 
 The stranger, before he quitted me, asked 
 me how long I had known Flamall. I 
 ansv.'cred; adding that he was nearly 
 related to my brother Philip. ' I should 
 be sorry for the young gentleman,' re- 
 plied he, ' were I not assured that I 
 must have heard a false representation of 
 Mr. Flamall's conduct in England.' I 
 urged him to explain himself; he evaded 
 for a time my enquiries, saying that he 
 had only common report to produce as 
 an apology for W07ide7'ing at seeing 
 Flamall in good company^ and in an

 honourable station of trust ; bat," added 
 he, *' I am safe with you ; I have heai'd 
 that he writes too well, therefore take 
 care of him, my good old friend." I 
 smiled and shook his hand : we under- 
 stood each other. Well! I am making 
 this a long story ! but now for the con- 
 clusion. One evening Philip returned 
 from Kingston so ill that I thought he 
 was dying. I say nothing of what passed 
 in my mind. Here was my last hope 
 within sight of the grave ! He grew 
 better, however, towards the morning, and 
 the doctor told me his disorder was not 
 the cruel fever which had made me 
 childless. Philip was moved to see my 
 distress, and he at once told me that he 
 did not deserve my love and goodness, for 
 that he had been afraid to trust me. He 
 then told me all about his marriage 
 with that poor little girl of ours, and the 
 
 roguery which that d d Flamall had 
 
 practised to make him believe she was a

 faithless bagg-age. He had met Miss 
 Lindsey by chance at his friend Dahym- 
 ple's, where he had persuaded Flamall to 
 place the two little Cowleys and their 
 mother ; and, as you may suppose, poor 
 Margaret's innocence was cleared up. It 
 was well Flamall was then beyond my 
 reach ! He was at the large plantation, 
 twenty miles from hence ; so instead of 
 shooting him through the head I em- 
 ployed my time in getting my poor boy 
 well ; and a contented mind hastened his 
 cure. I shall never forget what passed in 
 my mind when this affectionate, and very 
 anxious uncle came on the wings of the 
 wind to see his ** dear Philip !" I met 
 him, however, with my cunning face in 
 the hall, and told him the patient was 
 doing well, for he was asleep; and he 
 followed me into the eating room. A 
 thousand questions ensued, which were 
 all answered by assuring him that he 
 was in the road to better health than he

 I, gaily, '' he will do very well here when

 word, and, mounting his horse, left the 
 house. Poor Philip, who is the most af- 
 fectionate of creatures, was vexed when 
 I told him of this visit. lie wrote to his

 ** Be sure to advise him not to regard 
 this fellow's stubborn pride; he has been 
 too humble with him, in my opinion, but 
 his mother's peace is always uppermost, 
 and I cannot bear to see him uneasv, so

 Thus far, my dear Sir, you have seen 
 Mr. Flamall as tht guardian j the friend^ 
 and the relative. I leav^ to you to

 detention of the vessel permits me, I 
 will continue my history by informing 
 you that they have amongst them made

 of Henry Sinclair.

 gree of anxiety and confusion whenever 
 she saw me look serious. Our party, the

 ceremonious intrusion. I was in no hu- 
 mour for such company, and, pleading 
 a head-ach, I kept close in my own apart- 
 ment. Thus retired, I had just finished 
 my solitary di,nner when Lindsey entered 
 the room; and, sitting down, commended 
 myprudence and good fortune in escaping 
 the people who were yet in the house. '' I 
 can do no more for Philip," added he, 
 yawning, *^and it may do him good if they 
 teach him that nohappiness here isperma- 
 ent." I made no reply. '^ I find,'' continued 
 Lindsey, *' it is exactly as my wife had 
 foreseen, you have taken ofltence, and 
 Philip's caution is misconstrued. I M^ill 
 follow her counsels, for I have never had 
 reason yet to repent of so doing. Listen 
 to me, and then be angry if you please.

 ner kept his secret, and listened in pa- 
 tience. One letter from Miss Sinclair, 
 enclosed in one from Montrose, reached 
 poor Philip soon after his arrival here ; 
 and the reception he met with from his 
 brother cheered his drooping spirits. At 
 length his intelligence from Scotland 
 failed ; and his uncle gave him seriously 
 to understand that Mr. Cowley wished 
 to secure him for a husband for his 
 daughter. PhiHp endeavoured to laugh 
 at his uncle's having taken up a few 
 random jokes as a premeditated design,, 
 but this evasion failing, he firmly told 
 him that his aifections were engaged, 
 and that his honour, without other mo- 
 tives, would oblige him to refuse even 
 Miss Cowley's offered hand. " I would 
 have spared you, Sir,'' rephed Mr. Flamall, 
 with sternness, '' the pain of blushing be- 
 fore a man whose authority you have of 
 late cast oif, although from the hour of 
 your birth he has lived for the purpose

 of making you a reasonable being. I had 
 hoped to have seen you long since re- 
 claimed from the weakness and infatua- 
 tion of a boy deluded by his vanity and 
 passions ; but I see you require harsher 
 remedies than mine since you have found 
 your path to fortune smooth. Read that 
 letter, and then judge of the nature Â®f 
 those engagements which your delicate 
 honour opposes to a situation the most 
 enviable." He threw a letter on the table, 
 and abruptly left the room. Philip found 
 that it was one from his college tutor, 
 Doctor Macleod, to his uncle; and, 
 from its contents, it appeared that the 
 discovery of his attachment to your sister 
 had been made hy him to Mr. Flamall ; 
 for, after his approbation of the measures 
 which Mr. Flamall had pursued of re- 
 moving the lover from so dangerous a 
 predicament, he proceeds in detailing the 
 conduct of the deserted fiir one. 
 *' This imprudent girl," writes the good

 Doctor, *' soon supplied Mr. Flint's ab- 
 sence by admitting the visits of Â« nexo 
 lover. He was more experienced in the 
 wiles of the sex; of her class at least; and, 
 being an independent man, of considera- 
 ble fortune, she was prevailed upon to 
 quit her mother, and to place herself un- 
 der his protection at his seat near Dublin, 
 without the name of a* wife. I am told 
 that Montrose, her Jir^t lover, shares with 
 her in the generosity of her gallant ; and 
 that he is in Dublin, and supported by 
 this unhappy girl. Mrs. Sinclair has left 
 Edinburgh. Mrs. Montrose did not, at 
 her death, leave sufficient to pay her 
 debts. No wonder : her daughter is 
 somewhere in service : I hope it is an 
 honest one. When your nephew learns 
 these particulars he will be convinced of 
 the danger he has escaped, for he wants 
 not understanding ; nor will his gratitude 
 fail in the acknowledgments due to 
 those who, from their interest in his wel-

 *' finished with latin, and cautions Mr. 
 Flamall not to forget that the assumed 
 mask of a Miss Sinclair, and the design- 
 ing friendship of h Montrose, had been 
 the destruction of men much more expe- 
 rienced in life than his nephew, &c. â€” 
 Philip's state of mind, on perusing this 
 letter, was such as I shall not attempt 
 to describe. In the confusion and tu- 
 mult of his thoughts he crushed it in 
 his hand, and putting it into his bosom 
 he left Flamalls house. He wrote to me: 
 no answer was returned. He then wrote 
 to a young man for general information, 
 respecting his old friends, the Montroses 
 and Miss Sinclair, To this letter he liad 
 a reply. It was such as confinned, in 
 part, his tutor's intelligence; for the 
 death of Mrs. Montrose had broken up 
 her Uttle family, and the writer knew 
 not where her son and daughter were.

 reached this place with my wife; 'and 
 my friend, on whom I relied for my 
 present establishment, placed us in the 
 house of our countryman, Mr. Dalrymple,

 Fanny had formed her designs in favour 
 of her injured friend, and she was not 
 long without information in regard to 
 Mr. Flint's situation and favour with his 
 rich brother Oliver. She listened to his 
 praises, and the Dalrymples were not 
 sparing of them. His conduct in his 
 visits to the Cowleys and their mother; 
 his friendship to themselves, entered into 
 these details; and, finally, the disap- 
 pointment of certain young ladies who 
 were said to be in love with the hand-

 into her reproaches or Philip's distress, I 
 will finish my narrative by telling you, 
 thatDoctor Macleod's friendly epistle and 
 fatherly advise, was da,ted just sLv months 
 after his death. The result was much 
 happier than my poor wife had reason to 
 expect, for she had nearly been the 
 death of Philip in her indiscreet zeal for 
 friendship. We are all at present' in the 
 right road," continued Lindsey, " and 
 happy; but in our apprehensions of your, 
 warmth ; for Flamall is without import- 
 ance to us."â€” "I must see him," replied 
 I, " were it only to thank him for all his 
 good intentions. It will not, I presume, 
 disturb the peace of the world, if I should 
 improve Mr. Flamairs art of ' writing

 over my defeat. All I know is, that I was 
 subdued by her tears and pathetic represen-

 by my noticing this rascal. And so well 
 did she plead the cause of mercy and 
 forbearance, that I do not think I could 
 have shot at a sparrow whilst within hear-

 the syren, '* promise me, Mr. Sinclair, 
 that you will leave this miserable man 
 to the up braidings of his own conscience. 
 Indeed you are not made for a murderer;

 him just in regard to Miss Cowley's

 uncle's deviations from honour and in-

 affection for him, and an ambition which,

 he had first seen Duncan at Amsterdam ; 
 had there learned enough of his story to

 passage/' added this man, " more and more

 had the means of so doing, for I recom- 
 mended him to a merchant there, who re- 
 ceived him into his counting house. But 
 the fever of the climate seized him before 
 he had been a fortnight on shore. He saw 
 his danger, and had, as it appears, been 
 preparing for it. He gave into my hands 
 the picture of a young lady, which he 
 wore in his bosom, with a parcel, in which 
 he informed me was contained some letters 
 of the lady's, with one for you. He con-

 serve bis instructions, and I have only 
 further to add, Sir, that knowing, as T do, 
 the love he cherished for the lady, whom 
 he blessed with his last breath, I think it 
 right to hint to you some precautions in 
 acquainting her with my poor friend's 
 death." '^ You may suppose I satisfied

 happy business," observed I, *^ that obliged 
 this unfortunate young man to quit Eng- 
 land and his friends, who were able and 
 not indisposed to serve him, had he not 
 been too precipitate : his flight was nearly 
 the "death of the young woman in ques-

 replied he, '^ Nor do I even know her 
 name or address. When, in nearly his 
 last hour^ he gave me her picture frorrr 
 his bosom, and said, Mr. Flamall knows 
 for whom it is destined. He will take 
 care to tell the unfortunate injured object 
 of my love, that Charles Duncan has ex- 
 piated all his errors, by dying, and leaving'

 the most fatal of Duncan's errors had been 
 that of not knowing his best friend ; a 
 mistake, however, which had not been 
 shared by the young lady, whose heart 
 he had gained ; for, that she still looked 
 up to me for friendship and consolation. 
 Our conversation finished by settling our

 himself. There is your picture and this

 general health; fori certainly was less liable 
 to illness, after this crisis, I experienced 
 something of those sentiments, which the 
 dying Duncan had suggested. I rejoiced 
 that he was at peace ; and considered my 
 fate as ascertained. I could not know more 
 of grief, than I had experienced ; and in 
 a submission, which necessity, and, I hope 
 also, religion enforced, I settled into a calm

 and resigned frame of mind. My extreme 
 bodily weakness favoured for a time this 
 more placid condition of my spirits ; and 
 my rec ve"^' promised to my tender and 
 assiduous brother, a renewal of his com- 
 forts. He soon mentioned Mr. Duncan's 
 donation. He told me, ^' that knowing, as 
 I did, that both Keith and his wife were 
 dead ; fie thoug'it it was much the most 
 prudent measure to let the property remain 
 on the stock books, as it had done from 
 the time of Mrs. Duncan's committing her 
 money and her reputed son to his trust, 
 till such time, as he should become of age. 
 His quitting England within three or fovir 
 months of his being so," continued my 
 brother, '' prevented any settlement or 
 transfer of the stock, b\it he was mistaken 
 in his opinion of his fortune ; for it amount'? 
 to no more than two thousand pounds." 
 I answered with sincerity that I regarded 
 it, whatever it might be, as a common

 sal of It as most useful to our common 
 comfort ; and being persuaded that I 
 should not live long, I thought it could 
 not be better than as it was. He laughed 
 at my prophetic fears, assuring me that 
 the physician had told him I stood a bet- 
 ter chance of being well than when at 
 Kensington ; and he left me with a chear- 
 fulness, which soothed me. His atten- 
 tions did not slacken. He saw with satis- 
 faction my returning activity, and fre- 
 quently observed, that I was never more 
 beautiful. By degrees he prevailed on my 
 reluctance to visit, and receive his friends ; 
 ^nd I as clearly discovered, that my bro- 
 ther wished to see me married, as I mani- 
 fested a repugnance to the very idea of ex- 
 changing my condition for any other. I 
 thus attained my -twenty-third year. 
 From this period, the calmness of my 
 mind was disturbed, by the change I per- 
 ceived in my brother's modes of life. 
 With anguish of soul I discovered^ that he

 was tired of having a sister without ambi-

 his hands, who was deaf to flattery, and 
 who scorned infamy, however decorated* 
 I Was stiled '' a romantic idiot," '' a cold 
 and unempassioned statue, proud of a 
 form that was daily becoming useless." I 
 became resolute ; and told him, that with 
 any. form I would endeavour to gain honest 
 bread. My spirit silenced him. He 
 begged my pardon, and pleaded his con- 
 viction, that it would be in my power to 
 marry the libertine, whom he had condi- 
 tioned with on easy terms, though not less 
 profitable to his views. His fears, his re- 
 grets at seeing me waste my youth in una- 
 vailing sorrow; his belief, that my lover 
 would marry me at the death of an old 
 grandfather; his wishes to do so secretly ^ 
 were placed before me. I relented, 
 though without yielding to his dishonour- 
 able views, and all was again peace be-

 honour. Under this conviction I soon af- 
 ter saw Mr. Flint, for the first time. He 
 came to the house, as it appeared, on bu- 
 siness ; and finding Phihp absent, seemed 
 desirous of waiting for his expected retuÂ»n ; 
 h^- WIS accordingly conducted to me, as a 
 cHent of too much consequence to remain 
 unnoticed in the office. His age and re- 
 spectable appearance, induced me to shew 
 him every mark of respect. I recollected 
 my father's opinion of Mr. Flint and his 
 family- and I tried to please him by my 
 attentions. My guest contentedly main- 
 tained his post till my brother returned 
 at the dining hour; fortunately we were 
 alone that day ; and Mr. Fhnt, who ac- 
 cepted at once of the invitation, found 
 only a tabic at which economy presided; I

 appear, I succeeded. 
 
 Some days after, my brother with much 
 seriousness informed me, that my modest 
 and composed deportment had pleased Mr. 
 Flint. '* He has not only made his pro- 
 posals to me of jointuring you in tour hun- 
 dred pounds J)er annjim,'' added he, " but 
 he has also, on hearing the precise state of 
 my fortune, engaged to befriend me, by 
 lending me a sum of money which may 
 turn to good account. He knew my fa-

 ties in which he left me involved." â€” I at- 
 tempted to speak â€” '' Hear me to the end," 
 pursued he, '' before you condemn a bro-

 We quitted London a few days after

 had leisure to repent of my weakness 
 and timidity. My introduction to my 
 husband*s family was humiliating and pain- 
 ful to the last degree of suftcring sensibi-

 was an usurper of the rights I claimed ; 
 and I felt that, in my assumed title of Mrs,

 covered me with confusion every time I 
 heard it pronounced. My only consolati-

 my life to the man, whom I had thus de- 
 ceived. He was fond of me, and I studi- 
 ed incessantly to make him contented with 
 his wife. I foolishly began to think that

 I should contribute to the slender stock of 
 domestic comfort which I found at Fare-

 amiable sister Mary appeared to treat me 
 as one destined to enlarge their, and their 
 father's happiness : even Miss Flint seem- 
 ed reconcilied to the young mother-in-law, 
 who had,, in no instance abridged her in 
 her authority. I was fond of flowers, and 
 already began to enjoy the amusement of 
 the garden. Mr. Percival one morning 
 entered my dressing room, where Lucretia 
 and myself were at our needle work, my 
 husband having taken his darling Mary 
 with him in his airing ; his hands were 
 filled with some rare and beauti'ul plants, 
 and I found that this was a tribute to my 
 peculiar taste. My thanks followed, and 
 Percival withdrew, in order to see the plants 
 properly disposed of. ^' You have, con-

 unrequited, nay, ahufed love." She pro- 
 ceeded to inform me of Mr. Howard's per- 
 fidy, who^ after having gained her affec- 
 tions, had voluntarily given himself up to 
 the arts of her sister, who with a pretty 
 face, and the years of a child had basely 
 supplanted her in the opinion of a man, 
 whom she well knew was necessary to her 
 happiness ; and who had from her very 
 cradle shown the greatest cunning and ad-

 time of her absolute power over my hus- 
 band. 
 
 Subdued by conscience, and uncertain

 innocent girl ruined in her father's love. 
 My husband was incensed by some letters 
 of Mr. HowarS's, which fell into Lucretia's 
 hands ; these were incautiously preserved 
 by the fond girl, and they were certainly 
 such, as Mr. Howard had done much 
 more wisely not to have written. I en- 
 deavoured to soften my husband's resent- 
 ment ; and I should have succeeded ; for 
 he loved his daughter Mary, even, if I may 
 be allowed to speak, to a degree of weak- 
 ness ; and he was wretched because she 
 was unhappy. He spoke to my brother 
 on the subject, and discovered an inclina- 
 tion to unity and forgiveness, requesting 
 hmi to employ his influence with Lucretia 
 to give up to a sister a man whom she 
 could not win for herself; adding, that not- 
 withstanding Mr. Howard had so highly 
 offended him, he would pass over every 
 thing for the sake of peace, and to con-

 my influence was sedulously watched ; 
 and every time he expressed the regrets lie 
 experienced from being prevented seeing 
 his child^ I was suspected of having pro- 
 duced those relentings of nature in her fa- 
 vour, an^ was reproached by Mr. Flamall 
 for my folly in being blind to my own in- 
 terest ; and I was told that I had nothing 
 to do but to attend to my husband. I per- 
 fectly understood this language, and I cfid 
 attend to my husland ; but it was not to 
 deceive, or insult him. He was too weak 
 to be advised by me ; and unhappily feel- 
 ing at rimes the state of abject slavery, to 
 which his own weakness had reduced him, 
 he vented his resentments in peevish com- 
 plaints, and angry reproaches, that I was 
 too passive and indifferent to defend him

 an infant, he would beg me not to leave 
 him, for that I was his only comfort. 
 
 One day he mentioned the disposition 
 he had made of his property, adding, that 
 his children would think of him when he 
 was dead, although they had abandoned 
 him whilst living. ^^ As to you, my poor

 leave you enough for your ambition,

 of your health, which will be destroyed 
 by your attendance on me. You will find, 
 besides your jointure, a legacy of three 
 thousand pounds, with which you may 
 settle yourself comfortably when they send 
 you from hence : this sum is in your bro-

 when you shew him the bond, that he is 
 in arrears for the interest ever since your 
 marriage. He was a needy man, my Har- ^,

 with convulsions. I pass over an interval 
 of suffering which was terminated by his 
 death. 
 
 I will not attempt to describe my asto^ 
 nishment on hearing the deceased Mr. 
 Flint's will read. Let it suffice that its 
 contents were such as astonished every one. 
 My name only appeared in it, as having 
 been provided for at my marriage ; and as 
 it was necessary to specify that the join- 
 ture which had so provided for me, was to 
 revert to Miss Flint at my decease, on 
 failure of issue. I retired to my apartment 
 overwhelmed with grief and confusion. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Howard might be said to 
 have haunted my imagination ; I had wit-

 me ; an4 innocent as I was, I felt my

 which pressed upon nse, that all was not 
 honourable, yet a suspicion of my bro- 
 ther reached only to another enigma. 
 What was become of the bond ? This 
 question was on my lips more than once ; 
 but Philip had succeeded in making him- 
 self more the object of my dread than con- 
 fidence. To retire from the Hall ; to as- 
 sert the independence which I had so 
 dearly purchased ; to share with the How- 
 ards their father^s bounty, were the pur- 
 poses of my mind, audits support. In the 
 mean time I was treated with unusual 
 respect and attention by Miss Flint, 
 who repeatedly assured me, that the 
 object of her father's affections would al- 
 ways have claims on her own ; that she 
 could not bear to sec me so depressed by 
 an event which was to be expected in the 
 common course of nature ; and that if I 
 thought I had not been sufficiently con- 
 aidered for the sacrifices of health and plea-

 omission resulted from his firm persuasion

 and domestic comforts. I blu'.j;ied, and 
 replied, that I had every reason to be con- 
 tented with Mr. Flint's generosity and af- 
 fection. '' Had the provision allotted nie/'

 fourth part of what it is, I should have

 ence." She looked disappointed^ and chang- 
 ed the subject of conversation. 
 
 My brother paid me a visit the following 
 morning ; and having in vain requested 
 me to take an airing, grew angry. 
 '* Wherefore is it^ Harriet/' said he with 
 a petulant air, *^ that you affect to play the 
 Ephesian Matron with me ? It is mipossi-

 than I deserved." '* I was not of that opi- 
 nion/' replied he, *^ and soon after your 
 marriage gave Mr. Flint to understand 
 that I thought his widow was but slender- 
 ly provided for, unless further considered. 
 He told me that he had thought as I did, 
 and had acted accordingly. He added 
 that you were the only comfort he had in 
 this world ; that he had to thank me for 
 the blessing, and that I should find he had 
 not forgotten my kindness. I have rea-

 ness, that I had gone already too far into 
 concealments, not to dicover the danger 
 of the road ; that I meant to quit the 
 Hall, and had already formed my plans 
 for my future life. ''These," added I, 
 bursting into tears, '^ will not, nor can be

 sternly, ^^ when I tell you, that, what you

 Flint has known the particulars of your 
 first marriage from the day you appeared 
 here as her father's wife. Moreover she 
 insists upon it, that you have no legal 
 proofs of Duncan's death, nor any claim 
 to your jointure, from its having been 
 granted under a name and character to 
 which you had no right. You .will do well 
 to reflect on her temper, and on your con-

 dition, under a prosecution for ligamy. 
 My evidence, in your favour amounts 
 simply to the Dutchman's verbal attesta- 
 tion of being at Duncan's funeral, and his 
 letters and will written at Surinam. These 
 with me are conclusive proofs ; but I 
 know not how far they would be so 
 thought in a court at Doctor's Commons ;

 your marrying when a widow under your 
 maiden name may be attended." â€” ^' My

 ment, appeared to have secured Miss Flint's 
 reputation. Thus betrayed by others^ I 
 had some palliations to offer to my up- 
 braiding conscience. The innocent being 
 I had adopted as my own, pleaded still 
 more powerfully. I loved him with a pa- 
 rent's love, and I sheltered him from un- 
 just reproach and scorn. In this temper of' 
 mind I became acquainted with Sir Mur- 
 doch Maclairn. Alas ! in the society of 
 truth and honour I was a dissembler ! How 
 often have I forgotten, whilst listening to 
 his tale of woe, in which all was faithful-

 heart and tongue spoke his language, that 
 my life had been for months a falsehood, 
 my affections now betrayed me : I loved,

 period of my life. We had, however, so 
 far conquered the opposition to our re- 
 moval ; the time was fixed for our journey, 
 and even our trunks v ere preparing Miss 
 Flint saw these preparations with unfeign- 
 ed grief; for let me be just, she knew 
 me, and she loved me. I left your dear 
 father busily engaged in examining some 
 papers, contained *in a cabinet which had 
 been recently sent him from Scotland, and 
 with my work bag, sought the dejected 
 Lucretia. She was alone, in the bow par- 
 lour, and weeping ; I was employed in 
 consoling her by those arguments which 
 had been a thousand times repeated, when 
 Philip, your uncle, entered, and sullenly 
 took up a book without noticing me. In 
 a few minutes after, your father entered 
 the room, and with a placid air said, ^' I 
 have brought you something to see, and 
 admire ;" and placing a small ebony box 
 richly inlaid with silver on the table before 
 us, he succeeded in exciting our curiosity.

 '^The casket is nothing to its contents,*' 
 said he, smiling at our admiration of the 
 box, and taking from it a shagreen pic- 
 ture-case which he opened. " What say 
 you to this portrait ?** said he shewing us 
 a pretty large miniature of a gentleman in 
 a Spanish habit ; ** did you ever see a more 
 manly, gracious countenance ?'* We ex- 
 amined it, and to the praise due to the 
 artist, and the noble Hneaments he had 
 preserved, v/as added our admiration of 
 the rich diamonds which encircled it. '* It 
 ought to have a companion/' observed 
 your father, taking up another shagreen 
 case, similar to the one before us ; but it 
 might have been as well if the picture of 
 the lady had never reached my hand ; for 
 Harriet may be jealous of its superlative 
 beauty. He added, that the story of the 
 lovers was long and disastrous ; and might 
 be the ground work of a tragedy not un- 
 like in many particulars to '' the Fatal 
 Marriage.''^ 'â€¢ I remember," continued

 he, " that when my father many years 
 since shewed me the two pictures, he 
 briefly mentioned some circumstances, 
 which touched me to the soul. He was 
 the friend intrusted with these portraits, and 
 with the care of seeking out an infant son, 
 who had been conveyed from Madrid when 
 no more than three days old ; and who 
 had unaccountably eluded all the enquiries 
 which my father had, at that time, been 
 able to make. ''My absence from Scotland, 
 and myfather's death with other events,'* 
 he sighed â€” '^ obliterated from my me- 
 mory this box and the particulars I ha\e

 father previously to his death in the hands

 sition made by my father^ and addressed 
 to myself. He informs me, that having 
 traced, as he believes, the invaluable child 
 of his noble friends, he had sent his mo- 
 ther's picture to the faithful woman who 
 had been the only person privy to his birth, 
 and who passed for his mother. This I 
 was instructed to do, added my father ; 
 and the test of the boy's identity, rested on 
 the woman's returning the picture, with 
 the name of her lady annexed to it. She 
 received it from faithful hands ; for I was 
 already on that bed of death, from which 
 I am permitted to write this. She said she 
 should write to me from London, having 
 in her turn instructions to follow ; and that 
 with the witnesses of her integrity she 
 should present herself before me with her 
 precious charge, and with transports of 
 joy make over to my care a youth worthy 
 of the Duke and Dutchess ; she signed 
 herself S, Duncan. Philip advanced to

 tively. " Does your romance finish here ?" 
 asked he, '' So it appears^" replied my 
 husband, '' otherwise that picture, and the 
 letters would have been reclaimed." ^* I 
 should think no one will at present be 
 found to claim them," observed Mr. Flam- 
 all. '' I fear so also," answered Sir 
 Murdoch ; '' but when I am on the con- 
 tinent, I shall lose no opportunity of giv- 
 ing up my important trust to the family." 
 '^ I would be d â€” d," cried my brother 
 laughing, *' if I went a league out of my 
 road on such an errand !" *' Perhaps not," 
 answered my husband coldly ; ^' you may 
 not think it necessary." He folded up the 
 portrait,and, replacing it,withdrew.^* What 
 a pity it is," cried Flamall, as he followed 
 him with his eye, '* that Maclairn is not a 
 Spanish Grandee ! His gravity would have 
 suited admirably with their dignity ; and 
 his honour with their pride ; some people, 
 and honest ones too, would think the dia- 
 monds at least a lawful prize in this case ;

 and without a doubt, they have long been 
 cons: dered as lost. They would pay for your 
 journey, Harriet, or usefully decorate the 
 'poor Baronet's ladj'^ I made no answer, 
 for I was nearly fainting with emotion and 
 surprise ; but finding Miss Flint well dis- 
 posed to reply for me, I left the room, 
 and retreated from the scene of alterca- 
 tion which ensued, and which was but too 
 familiar to my ears. Your father's iDness 
 succeeded to this occurrence, my dear 
 Malcolm. I will hasten to inform you, and 
 him of the reasons which led me to give 
 this incident a place in my narrative. 
 
 It is now something more than five 
 years since, that I was called upon to feel 
 the full weight of the penalty afhxed by 
 eternal justice, to the violation of truth 
 and rectitude of conduct. In the duties 
 before me, the remembrance of the un- 
 fortunate Duncan had been softened down 
 into the placid hope of his being at peace.

 Miss Flint had apparently forgotten that 
 such a being had ever existed. A more 
 immediate concern engaged her mind^ and 
 from her excessive fondness of her son^ 
 grew up a disUke to you, and a jealousy 
 of your mother, which harassed me and 
 rendered her unhappy. Several circum- 
 stances, which I need not recall to youi* 
 memory, proved to her, that the slave of 
 Mr. Flamall, and her own sheltered de- 
 pendent, was not without the animal in- 
 stinct of defending her offspring ; and 
 even in these contests, the name of Dun- 
 can never escaped her lips. This genero- 
 sity was not lost upon me, who had to 
 sustain the cruel and barbarous hints, not 
 unfrequently dropped by my brother, in 
 regard to a subject, too painful to be en- 
 larged upon ; and which produced no 
 other effect, than that of making me, more 
 and more, the inmate of your father's 
 apartment.

 I had, as usual, seen my beloved pa- 
 tient quietly tasting that repose which his 
 agitated mind required ; and I left him, 
 to take my accustomed walk in the ave- 
 nue. A radiant moon, with the soft 
 evening breeze, which had succeeded to 
 a sultry day, cheered me^, and I sauntered 
 until you met me on your return from 
 your friends at the farm. We enjoyed 
 -the scene around us; and, for some time, 
 conversed at our ease, on the seat round 
 the oak^ but hearing the turret clock: 
 chiming the three quarters after ten, I rose 
 to return to the house ; when suddenly, a 
 wretched looking man, sprang from the 
 covert near us, and ran with swiftness 
 down the avenue. You instantly dissi- 
 pated my alarm, by telling me it was a 
 sick sailor, whom you had met and re- 
 lieved that afternoon, on your way to Mr. 
 Wilson's. He had, it appeared, been 
 ship- wrecked, and was begging his way to 
 his friends in London. You finished

 your little story, by adding, that you 
 supposed he had strolled into the avenue, 
 and had fallen asleep. We parted for 
 the night, and I thought no more of 
 the mendicant sailor. The following 
 evening I again repaired to the avenue, 
 it was about eight o'clock, and again I 
 took my seat at the oak. -Aga n, did I 
 see this miserable object slowly advancing 
 towards me ; his ghastly countenance ex- 
 cited my compassion, not my fears, and I 
 rose to meet him, with some silver in my 
 handr He stopped, leaning himself against 
 a tree ; and wiping his face, as though 
 faint with hunger, gazed upon me. '^ Do 
 not advance," cried I, quickening my pace, 
 " honest friend I am coming to give you a 
 trifle." He groaned, dropped a sealed 
 packet, and darted from me with speed. 
 
 Terrors too powerful for language as- 
 sailed me ! I gasped for breath, and, for 
 some minutes, stood motionless, gazing

 he seemed. At the stile he turned ; and 
 from its elevation still saw me, he struck 
 his breast and head ; then vanished. A 
 sudden conviction, shot through my con- 
 founded senses; I seized the parcel; it 
 was addressed to Lady Maclairn, and in 
 the well remembered characters of Charles 
 Duncan. I placed it in my bosom ; and 
 was, 1 believe, indebted to the air for the 
 preservation of life ; for I did not faint, al- 
 though unconscious of time. Your cheer- 
 ful voice^ Malcolm, as you approached me 
 singing, rouzed me, and I attempted to 
 rise ; but again I sunk on the seat I had 
 quitted, and burst into tears. You saw 
 my emotion, my dear son, and in reply 
 to your enquiries I made the usual an- 
 swer, for the dejection of my spirits, ad- 
 ding, that I had again seen the vagabond 
 in the avenue, at a distance, and not 
 chusing to advance, had kept near the 
 house^ not altogether without fear. '^ I

 that he was trespassing, and that he must 
 not be seen in the avenue. He said, he 
 hoped he should be many miles from it in 
 twenty-four hours, meaning to pursue his 
 route before sun-rise the next morning. 
 He begged my pardon ; he had been in- 
 duced to seek the relief his miseries need- 
 ed^ but finding the lady was alarmed had 
 retreated. I commended him for his at- 
 tention, and rewarded him with some sil- 
 ver/' '^ He has done me no harm," re- 
 plied T, '^ for I was not much disposed to

 acknowledge it to be such ; and he will 
 applaud the woman, who, although shrink-

 avow her veneration^ and love for virtue. 
 She must indeed be sunk, who. could erase 
 from her memory a man like Charles Dun-

 you of those tender fears and apprehensi- 
 ons which resulted from our union ! Oh 
 no ! you cannot have forgotten them, 
 nor my arguments for your immediately 
 leaving a house, in which you were sub- 
 jected to perpetual alarms. You will also 
 recollect, that we both believed our liber- 
 ality to the Keiths had bound them to our 
 interest; particularly Mrs. Keith, who 
 had gratefully acknowledged my gift of 
 Mrs. Duncan's apparel, and the little ad- 
 vantages which her slender purse derived 
 from her being my laundress. 
 
 Passing near her house one morning, 
 just before you left London with your 
 friends, the Hatchways, a dray- man so 
 completely bespattered me, that, in order 
 to shun the laughter of the diverted 
 witnesses of this mischance, I took refuge 
 at Mrs. Keith's : knowing that I could there 
 change my linen, &c. During her kind 
 offices about me, I observed, that she had 
 been weeping ; and, whilst waiting for my

 her what had disturbed her. " Only the 
 old story /'answered she, weeping anew, ^'I 
 am weary of my life; my husband was never 
 good ; but of late he is a brute, and beats 
 me, because I cannot go to market without 
 money. God help me, I am too honest 
 for Patrick !" ^' He ought to husband his 
 money better," replied I, '' he is in con- 
 stant employment with Mr. Flamall I find, . 
 and he is a good copier." '' He will never 
 find that any thing he gains from that 
 quarter will thrive," answered she, colour^ 
 ing wi'th resentment; '' the good. 
 old proverb is against him. What is 
 got by the devil's means will go as it 
 came." " You ought not to blame Mr. 
 Flamall," observed I, prolonging my toi- 
 let, " that he cannot teach your husband 
 to -take care of the money he earns : Flam- 
 alLis not a spendthrift." '^ He is too cun- 
 ning for you to understand," replied she, 
 nodding her head significantly, '* but he

 to become of you, when your wife wants 
 a cradle for her poor babe ? Patrick swears 
 that I shall not take her in : the Lord help 
 you both ; there will be such doings^ and 
 no Mrs. Duncan to stand by you with 
 her purse!" '' I defy Mr. Flamall/' an- 
 swered I, ^' and will soon let him know that 
 I can protect my wife ; in less than four 
 months I shall be master of my dear mo- 
 ther's little provision, and with that, and 
 industry, my Harriet shall have a cradle 
 for our infant." She shook her head de- 
 spondingly, "" Poor soul !" said she ; 'Mt 
 is perhaps happy for her that she is remov- 
 ed, she loved you better than many real 
 mothers do their children ; it would have 
 grieved her to see you set fast so young."

 asked I, without betraying my emotions.

 this, I could say more if I pleased ; but I 
 do not wish to bring Patrick to the gallowsj

 ing, and uncovering her bosom. It was 
 bruised. My compassion soothed her ; but 
 she became more guarded ; and only con- 
 fessed that I had not been well used, add- 
 ing, '^ I have said enough to you, and 
 should my husband know it, he would 
 murder me. But the time may come, vvhen 
 you will be able to take care of me. I 
 have not forgotten the black pocket book, 
 nor the letters on it, studded with silver, 
 nor what is more, the bank notes it con- 
 tained. I know that ten hundred make a 
 thousand y as well as the lawyer. Betty 
 Keith is neither deaf nor blind." In vain 
 did I urge her to be more explicit. ^' So I 
 will, when I am upon oath," answered 
 she ; ^' but you can do nothing at present.

 grating, as he calls it, when I do but turn 
 the tongue in my head." I took the hint, 
 and g v.pg er a guinea, left the room. 
 You were on the eve of your little voyage, 
 ill and dejected, and I forbore to add to 
 your inquietude. Your departure followed, 
 and Duncan's fate advanced to the crisis 
 which terminated his hopes and prospects 
 in this world, A few days passed. My 
 bosom was relieved of its fears for your 
 safety ; you wrote in spirits ; and you con- 
 curred in your second letter, in my plan of 
 
 removing you from Y^ th to the north ; 
 
 and from thence declaring your marriage 
 to your brother. At this juncture I re- 
 ceived an anonymous letter ; it was dated 
 from Helvoetsluys^ tlie language English, 
 with foreign idioms. The writer signified 
 that he was dcp-.ited by my parents to in- 
 form me, that the mystery in which my 
 birth had been involved was removed;

 but for many cogent reasons, which should 
 be expliined, he was commissioned to 
 meet me at Harwich ; that he should per- 
 haps he there as soon as his letter ; but 
 at all hazards in a few days^ and should' 
 wait my arrival at the Ship inn. '^ Be 
 only anxious," added he, '^ to be punc- 
 tual to this rendezvous. Measures for 
 your future destination in the world will 
 result from this interview. Be on the re- 
 serve with those about you, and above 
 all, trust not the man who calls himself 
 your guardian ; he has an eye over him 
 which he little suspects, and he will have 
 an account to settle, not with the obscure 
 s.nd friendless Charles Duncan^ but with 
 an arm of power, which shall crush him, 
 as the spoiler of the widow and the or- 
 phan." 
 
 You will imagine that my whole soul 
 was fixed on accomplishing the journey 
 to Harwich. It so eiuirely engaged my 
 thoughts, that I spoke of my intention to

 Simons, saying I should ask Mr. Flamall 
 for a week or ten days holiday, in order to 
 meet a friend at Harwich. "He will re- 
 fuse you," replied he, " for he w^ants you 
 in the office to supply his own absence. 
 He can find leisure for his own jaunts, 
 but he thinks not of us." ^' l.will not be 
 refused," replievl I eagerly, *' then do as I 
 do in such cases," said he ; *' Send your 
 trunk off before you, and take a French 
 leave when you can, in order to bring.

 end of his objections !" 
 
 I availed myself of Simons's counsel, and 
 sent a small portmanteau to the Harwich 
 coach that evening. On the followmg 
 morning I civilly requested your brother 
 to spare me ten days or a fortnight, ex- 
 plaining to him my wishes in part, by say- 
 ing, that I expected to meet a friend at 
 Harwich, and we should probably make a 
 little excursion together. Good God, 
 how delightful- were my prospects ! for

 these were boanded by seeing you and an- 
 nouncing my parents to you : Some 
 questions, for which I was prepared, fol- 
 lowed : reluctance gradually yielded, 
 ^^ He thought it but an idle expence ; but 
 I had been frugal, and therefore he should 
 not refuse me;" and, opening his desk, 
 he paid me my quarterly stipend of twenty 
 guineas, which had been due nearly a 
 month. He soon after told Simons, that 
 he was going with a party of friends to 
 Windsor, and should not return for a day 
 or two ; then carelessly asking me, when 
 and how I intended to journey, he left us ; 
 shaking me by the hand, arid with a Ju- 
 das' s smile, he bade me '^ remember 
 that my purse had not the virtue of For- 
 tunatus's." Simons boasted much of a 
 horse which a friend of his let out ; and so 
 strongly pointed out to me the advantages 
 of travelling in this mode, that I went 
 with him to the livery stable, in order to 
 see the animal thus recommended. It had

 been a fine one : but had been ridden' 
 down, and I should have given up my 
 project of riding on horseba1*k but for his 
 persuasions. He was certain the beast 
 would travel well with ine, and return bet- 
 ter than when he set out ; the terms were: 
 easy^ and to please Simons, I consented to- 
 please his friend, the proprietor of th^ 
 horse. Amongst the various arguments- 
 he used was one^ which had probably 
 turned the scale. I could run down to 
 Rumford that night; the horse had been 
 at the manger the whole day, and the re- 
 mainder of the road to Harwich was light, 
 work. This project was adopted; but a. 
 heavy rain stopped me for some hours ; 
 and it was nine o'clock in the evening 
 when I mounted and parted with my offir 
 cious friend at the livery stable. The 
 clouds were dispersed, and the moon, 
 though not in her zenith, favouring me, 
 I proceeded on gently. The horse was 
 Stiff with fatigue^ and I found that SIt

 mons had ^^ taken me in," to use his own 
 quaint langfiage. I was within half a mile 
 of Woodford,^ village on the Epping 
 road^ when I was accosted by name^ by a 
 man whom I recollected having seen once 
 or twice in your brother's office. He 
 checked the bridle, and civility obliged 
 me to stop. Enquiries after Mr. Flamall's 
 health, were followed by wondering to 
 meet me so late on such a road. '' I may 
 wonder in my turn," answered I, for you 
 have more to apprehend from this damp 
 evening than I have. But you will excuse 
 me, I am hastening to Stretham, still some 
 miles from hence. I spurred my horse and 
 bowing, wished him a good night. He 
 shouting after me, *' Look to your pistols, 
 young man." I had pistols with me, but 
 I needed them not. I proceeded unmo- 
 lested in my journey till within a mile of 
 Rumford ; when the miserable beast I 
 rode making a trip, fell ; and I received a 
 contusion on my knee, that, for a time.

 prevented my rising, and totally disabled 
 me from mounting again. With much 
 difficulty I reached an inn at KuLiiford, 
 leading the horse, and in my wish to find 
 shelter, I became indifferent to accom- 
 modations. I took the first house that 
 was open, and found, with civility, a bed,, 
 to which I instantly repaired. The next 
 morning I found the injury I had received 
 too serious to allow me to prosecute 
 my journey, without hazard, on Siinons's 
 vaunted horse. I therefore sent the beast 
 home, with a note to Simoas, mentioning 
 my accident, and the necessity Iwas un^ 
 der of pursuing my journey i^ a post 
 chaise, as it v^as absolutely my purpose to 
 be at Harwich on the Saturday. My 
 hostess, had, in the mean time, with much 
 humanity apphed her infallible nostrum 
 to my knee ; and, on my quitting her the 
 following day, she generously insisted on 
 piy taking some of the ointment with me^ 
 assuring me, that by being repeated, it.

 would relieve not only the tumour, but the 
 pain. In this point*, she was however 
 mistaken, and, on reaching the appointed 
 inn at Harwich, I could not stand on my 
 legs. The waiter, who assisted me inta 
 the house, asked me, whether my name 
 was Duncan ; and being answered in the 
 affirmative, he proceeded to tell me, that 
 a person had called twice, within the hour^ 
 to enquire for me. Not doubting but 
 this was my incognito friend, and that he 
 would return to the house, I ordered him 
 to be conducted to me, and dismissed 
 the man for some coffee. During this 
 interval of suspense and curiosity my knee 
 soUcited my attention ; It was extremely 
 painful, and I had recourse to my Rumford 
 landlady's specific for a bruise. Whilst 
 employed in applying most assuredly what 
 most assuredly augmented the evil, the 
 door of the apartment was suddenly 
 opened ; and to my inconceivable surprise 
 Simons hastily entered, '^ You are come

 at last," said he with an oath, " I have 
 been on the rack these two hours.'* " And 
 1 for near four and twenty," repHed I, in- 
 terrupting him, and directing his attention 
 to my employment; '' but what brings 
 you hither ?" He grasped my hand with 
 eagerness, and in a low voice told me, 
 that he came to save my life. I laughed, 
 I believe, for he swore most horridly, and 
 concluded by saying, that he had not 
 time to see me play the fool. *' The 
 person," added he, *' commissioned by 
 your father to meet you here, is no stranger 
 to me. Let it suffice, I am in his secret. 
 He is, it may be, at this instant dying at 
 Helvoetsluys of a fever, and I am ordered 
 to conduct you there to him ; all is pre- 
 pared ; and you must go this instant on 
 board the packet. There is not a mo- 
 ment to lose." I hesitated, for 1 thought 
 of my Harriet ; but he urged me with a 
 vehemence that confounded my delibera- 
 tions ; and eoiicluded by saying, that my

 honour, and even my life, depended on 
 my following him. With ins help and 
 a porter's 1 was conveyed to the water-side, 
 and there found the boat, in which we 
 reached the packet, then, getting under 
 sail, I threw myself on the bed reserved 
 for me, subdued by the pain in my knee, 
 and soon after was seized with the sea- sick- 
 ness. I saw no more of my companion 
 that night : and learned that, fearing to 
 share in the common malady, he preferred 
 being on deck, it was with difficulty that 
 I supported myself to the public-house at 
 the Sluys ; but overcome, as I was, with 
 pain, I failed not to remark, that Simons 
 spoke the Dutch language fluently. '^ It 
 is well I can," answered he roughly to my 
 observation, for your iriend is not here; 
 we must proceed to Rotterdam ; and you 
 must bear up as well as you can ; the pas- 
 sage-boat is an easy conveyance for you. 
 This boat was shared by others as well as 
 ourselves ; and with an irritation of mind.

 senses, which had been suspended for 
 some time, I saw a well dressed man en- 
 gaged in giving mc succour, and I con- 
 cluded that this was the person I was to 
 meet. On asking- Simons whether he was 
 the dying man I had been led to expect, 
 he answered, that he was a surgeon, 
 and that my knee required some better 
 remedy than I had applied. I sub- 
 mitted to his orders, and was carried to 
 bed. At length Simons was at leisure to 
 satisfy my curiosity. He began the sub- 
 ject himself, by observing with some ill- 
 humour that it was unlucky â€” I omit the 
 epithets, my Harriet, with which he in- 
 terlarded even his expressions of kindness, 
 that, what with the indisposition of my 
 friend, and my accident, which he found 
 from the surgeon would unavoidably de- 
 tain me some days in m.y bed. he should

 Idc forced to prolong his stay. I have writ-

 I find the sick man wis advised to remain ; 
 to-morrow or the next day, we siiall have 
 letters." Need, I say, inwh it anncr .1 in- 
 terval was filled up by me ! I wrote you acir- 
 cumstantial account of these various events; 
 and the fond wish of making my Harriet 
 easy under a separation so unexpected, im- 
 parted to my bosom a portion of those 
 hopes which were necessary for hrr sup- 
 port as well as mine. This lerter I in- 
 trusted to the surgeon^s care, not chusing 
 to employ Simons. I made him compre- 
 hend, that It was of importance to me ; 
 and, with a good-natured smile, he satisfied 
 me, that he would faithfully discharge his 
 trust. It was under cover to Mrs. Keith. 
 Too fatally certain is it, that you never 
 saw this letter ! In the mean time, my 
 soul was on the rack, from havins no in- 
 teliigence of you. Again, and again, I 
 wrote to Mrs. Keith, and to you. I had 
 no letters^ and I began to suspect the sur-

 geon had given Simons my letters, instead 
 of putting them into the post-office. In 
 the mean time his attention to my accom- , 
 modations and health had nothing in them 
 to surprize me ; for he constantly talked 
 of his being commissioned by the 
 gentleman at Amsterdam, to be careful 
 of his " precious charge^^ and sometimes 
 he translated passages from his letters ex- 
 pressive of the importance of my person 
 and his anxiety in not being in a state to 
 attend me himself. I was now on crutches, 
 and free from pain ; and I was told that it 
 was proper for me to proceed to Amster- 
 dam. I decidedly refused, saying that I 
 was determined to return to England ; and 
 he might inform his correspondent of my 
 resolution, it being indispensibly necessary 
 for my peace, to have news from thence. 
 *^ I will furnish you with a newspaper," 
 said he gravely ; '^ that will, I trust, make 
 you change your mind ; but it may not 
 be amiss to prepare you for news that will

 surprise you more than you are aware.'* 
 He began his narrative of the high- 
 way robbery charged on me, and finished 
 by placing before me the article in the 
 day's paper, which, with a detail of the 
 particulars, included a description of my 
 person, situation, and even the initials of 
 my name, and of the master with whom 
 I served as clerk. You will judge, my Har- 
 riet, of the effect which this intelligence 
 produced. I solemnly s.vore that nopowef 
 on earth should prevent my immediately 
 appearing and confronting the base and false 
 accuser. ^' You know best," replied 
 Simons, ^^ the proofs with vxdiich you can 
 invalidate this man's positive oath." But 
 I would advise you rather to secure such a 
 condition of fortune, as will of itself, with 
 nine hundred and ninety-nine outof a thou- 
 sand, prove that you are slandered. In a 
 word," continued he, vvitli a serious air,

 than you are able to do yourself. Your 
 parents are rich and powerful, and, trust 
 me, more than o^ie will be calle-d to a 
 strict account for their conduct in regard 
 to you.'* I was still resolved on my mea- 
 sures ; for my wife's deplorable condition 
 solely engaged me. "' It is well, Sir," 
 observed he, with a tone of authority, " I 
 shall proceed without you, and even if it 
 be necessary to Cadiz, and inform your 
 noble parents, that you preferred a gibbet 
 to them. But you are a simpleton, Dun- 
 can," added he, with more kindness, *' I 
 know your motive for this headstrong 
 folly. Will your appearance, and the 
 charge which will be brought against you, 
 lessen the distress of the girl you love ?" 
 I started. " I know miore than you think 
 of that business also," continued he ; 
 '^ and I advise yoa to write to her, and 
 inftantly make )our way to your parents. 
 You will then be able to offer herthe pro- 
 tection she needs." I burst into tears, and

 reproached him with having stopped my 
 letters. He vehemently denied the charge ; 
 adding, '' that he pitied Miss Flamall^, and 
 was better pleased to serve her than to in- 
 jure her. 
 
 Unable to extract more from a man who 
 hourly assumed with me more of respect 
 as well as of autJwrity, I yielded to his 
 control. I was still lame and helpless ; and 
 except the diminished sum with which your 
 brother had furnished me, I had no re- 
 sources for my premeditated plan. Simons 
 soothed me, by conducting me to the post- 
 office, where I deposited a letter for you, 
 and his orders taken, to f brward all letters 
 to our address at Cadiz, to a house of

 again surprised. This Proteus spoke the 
 Spanish tongue well, and in his conver- 
 sation with the captain of a Sj^anish ship 
 bound for Cadiz, I perceived that he as- 
 aumed the gravity and statelmess of a 
 Spanish grandee. On the man's leaving

 on finding him so qualified for a traveller.

 his lack of brains, forgot to pay me for the 
 five years use he made of mine ; he taught 
 me a lesson however which f wanted," 
 continued he with a malicious grin.

 regard every man either as a fool or a 
 knave." It required very little judgment, 
 my dear Harriet, to determine the class to â–  
 which Simons belonged; yet in spite of his 
 habitual vulgarity, and coarse language, 
 I hourly perceived that he had moved in a 
 different sphere, and could at his pleasure 
 assume the gentleman. He spoke of me 
 as a Spaniard by birth, and by the respect 
 he showed me, taught those about me to 
 consider me as of importance ; performing 
 the part of my governor; and making no 
 secret of my having been a stranger to my 
 rank, parents, and country, from nearly 
 the hour I was born. These hints were 
 needless, to stimulate a curiosity constantly 
 on the fullest stretch. To my questions 
 I received only one answer : " I am bound 
 to secresy, and it i% for my interest to be 
 faithful. Have patience, time will dis- 
 cover all to you." Thus goaded on, and 
 convinced of niy inability of securing him

 in my interest ;-, having exhausted my own 
 little stock of money, and depending, in 
 .'v^range country upon Simons for pecu- 
 niary assistance, I left Amsterdam with- 
 out having received letters from you; and 
 in tlie anguish of my soul I sought relief 
 from the hope of meeting with protection, 
 iind being placed in a situation to succour 
 you ; for I made no doubt of your bro- 
 ther's interference with your wishes to write 
 to me. Our navigation was for a time 
 pleasant. The gentle breezes which filled 
 our sails soon exempted me from sea sick- 
 ness ; rest restored my knee, and my hours 
 were beguiled by my assiduously studying 
 the Spanish language ; for which, Si'mons 
 having proposed it for my amusenient, I 
 had purchased a few needful books. 
 
 At this period, however, one incidental 
 cause of sorrow was added to my oppres- 
 sive burden. Two or three days after your 
 departure from town, I had began to bathe, 
 trusting to its relieving me from a portion, 
 at least, of that languor which I experi-

 enced ; and, cautiously guarded in all 
 that related to my Harriet, had taken your 
 picture from my bosom, and placed it in 
 my port-folio with your letters, which I 
 carefully kept locked in a large trunk, with 
 articles that were not of every day's use. 
 I had seen on reaching Helvoetsluys 
 that this trunk made the greatest part of 
 our bag^agf ; and on noticing it to Simons, 
 he replied, that he expected my thanks 
 for his zeal in my service in bringing it, 
 as he supposed it was kept as lumber in 
 my room, and that I should have no ob- 
 jection to a change of linen. To this 
 necessity I had been hitherto a stranger, 
 and the trunk remaitied corded till I was 
 settled in my cabin on board the Spanish 
 ship. The treasure it contained was too 
 precious to be forgotten. I searched for 
 it in vain. Neither your letters nor your 
 portrait were to be found. I did not con- 
 ceal my suspicions, nor my distress from 
 Simons, who as usual, with the most horrid

 imprecations afiirmed that he had not open- 
 ed the trunk ; nor had any other motive 
 in removing it^ but that of contributing 
 to my comforts and amusement, knowing 
 that I had some books in it. To contest 
 with Simons was a vain attempt. I was 
 silenced, and bore this trial, to use my 
 master's words like a ^* whining puppy.'* 
 Yet in spite of himself I perceived that he 
 had an interest in preserving my health 
 and tranquillity, and that he never ceased 
 to recommend to me patience; hinting 
 continually that I should soon be in a con- 
 dition to take ample vengeance on those 
 who had injured me, and to protect you, 
 who had been so unjustly dealt with. 
 These conversations with his avowed good 
 will for you, and pity for me had their 
 effect. 
 
 We were within thirty or forty league* 
 of our post when we were boarded by a 
 large, well-armed Algerine corsair, and 
 taken without resistance; for such was

 the inferiority of our force, that it v^as 
 not possible for us to escape. Surprised 
 and confounded by an event for which I 
 was altogether unprepared, my compas- 
 sion was notwithstanding exerted in com 
 forting my. terrified companion. I strove 
 to e^icourage him by the same hopes which 
 had calmed my own spirits ; and with con- 
 fidence I assured him, that as subjects of 
 Great Britain we should be enlarged at 
 Algiers ; and that we had only to apply 
 to the Eritish consul resident there, in 
 order to be protected. In this expectation 
 we were cruelly disappointed, by tlie mea- 
 sures which the pirate pursued; who 
 from, motives we could not fathom, after 
 having treated mewith extraordinarydenity, 
 and Simons without rigour, landed us with 
 great circumspection during the night at 
 some distance from the harbour ; and to 
 our amazement and consternation we werev 
 with our chests, placed in a covered vehicle,

 manacled and vigilantly concealed from 
 every eye by those who were charged with 
 us ; who still maintained their claims to 
 our gratitude, by offering us no violence 
 or harshness. 1 had not been much sur- 
 prised at seeing Simons relpasing into the 
 pusillanimity he had betrayed in the first 
 moments of our capture ; but I was asto- 
 nished to find that, with his grief for him- 
 self and the most bitter execrations on his 
 folly, he bemoaned my hard fate in terms 
 which I little expected from him. '' Take 
 courage,'' said I, willing to relieve his sor- 
 row, '-' you have nothing to reproach your- 
 self with in this misfortune, and I am 
 sorry, that your good intentions and zeal 
 for my service have led you into this diffi- 
 culty ; but we may yet find the means of 
 applying to the consul, or purchasing our 
 freedom. Do not despair." ^'I must,'*

 wept in agonies, and I was alarmed. " I

 ineffectual attempts to soothe his agita-

 Mrs. Pcachley, who, having calkd to s^ 
 her relations, discovered that she had 
 found a prey worth pursuing ; and finding 
 that her brother had inmates not likely to 
 cavil at the price of his lodgings, she re- 
 doubled her attentions, by several times 
 calling on Mrs. Duncan, to enquire after 
 you, and, as she said, to see that the 
 Keiths were assiduOus in their attendance. 
 Your poor mother, who knew not a being 
 in London ; but the person she had met 
 the day of her arrival, and who was out of 
 town, mentioned, with extreme distress, 
 that in an hour of such difficulty, she had 
 the additional misfortune of finding, that 
 her only friend had left London and was 
 gone abroad. This confidence became 
 more enlarged, in proportion as your dan- 
 ger was more imminent. She incessantly 
 lamented the absence of this Mr. Joseph 
 Jago; and in her illness, she consulted 
 Mrs. Ptachky, on the means she should

 take to secure to you the little property 
 which her death would give you in case 
 you survived her. Mr. FlamaU's good 
 offices were employed ; and she made her 
 will, which was witnessed by her two 
 doctors. You were left to Mr. FlamaU's 
 care, and your money into the bargain, 
 until such une as his trust should be set 
 aside by your natural guardians, who lived 
 abroad ; or until you were of age, in case 
 these relations did not appear. Hitherto 
 all went well, but Keith's wife, either from 
 hatred of her sister, or the spirit of contra- 
 diction common to her, thought it a good 
 opportunity of acting like an honest wo* 
 man ; she was careful of you during your 
 delirium ; and also attentive to your poor 
 mother. Your generosity when you left 
 her house for Mr. FlamaU's, confirmed her 
 good dispositions towards you. I had not

 trust, which had thus devolved on him ; 
 brought home with him on the night of 
 the funeral, some papers which belonged 
 to the deceased Mrs. Duncan, in order for 
 their better security as he said, and he 
 then mentioned you and your condition, 
 adding, that he did not think you could 
 survive your mother ; and that he had no 
 clue to any of your connexions. He spoke 
 of 5^our liitle property in the funds ; and 
 the suspicion he entertained, that Mrs. 
 Duncan was not your real mother. ''Why 
 do you not examine her letters ?" asked 
 I. " I have/' answered he ; '' but they

 this observation was made, and he gave 
 me three or four letters from a pocket 
 book, which he said, the defunct had in 
 her trunk, and which constituted all the 
 papers, that could lead to an explanation 
 of a secret, which she had too long de- 
 ferred to communicate. I shall only no- 
 tice to you,'* continued Simons, ^^ those 
 passages which struck me the most. Two 
 or three of the letters contained little more 
 than most tender expressions of maternal 
 affection ; and the most pathetic descrip- 
 tion of the writer's hopes and fears, as 
 these related to you. One of a later date 
 informed Mrs. Duncan that Jachimo de 
 Castros had been summoned by the Duke 
 to , his agency being more impor- 
 tant there, than in England ; that his ser- 
 vices were supplied by the orders he had 
 left with a fried ftiencJ, Joseph Jago, a 
 merchant in the Minories, to whom she 
 was to apply in every exigency, and who 
 would forward her letters. Another, of a

 Much was said of a picture which hcavtn

 with a thousand pounds, '' Her Henrico''

 knowledge of a mother, whose miseries 
 were forgotten, in the hopes of clasping 
 her son, her long lost blessing, to her bo-

 contents; and he observed, that thev

 would do you more harm than good ; for 
 it was clear you were a bastard ; and had 
 lost your best friend, who had happily left 
 you enough for bread, assisted by your 
 industry. I was soon the friend of Keith ; 
 from him I only got hints, that quickened 
 my curiosity. His wife was more pliant. 
 She informed me, that Mrs. Duncan had 
 written a long letter to Joseph Jago four 
 da}'S before she died ; and had, in her 
 hearing, desired that Mr. Flamall should 
 send it to his house* Her husband was 
 entrusted with it, and the gentleman was 
 told, that his partner had received it, and. 
 had promised to forward it without delay. 
 Now, added she, I know this was a lic^ 
 for it was in Mr. Flamall's pocket at the 
 time, and this is nothing to what I could 
 say if I chose. '^ I was, as yet/' conti- 
 nued Simons, '' only on the threshold ;" 
 and I forbore to press my questions.

 in cash. Keith had also money; and it

 what was in the pocket case ; and so does 
 my wife ; one, of ten, only of the notes,

 could not get more from him ; but I knew

 Jew merchant, and I found his house

 office of business, where several clerks 
 were at the desk, and one who appeared 
 to take the lead, civilly asked me my bu-

 be favoured with his address?" ** Cer- 
 tainly, but he had reason to believe his

 He courteously desired one of the young 
 men to write the address, and presenting 
 it to me, I withdrew. 
 
 So far all went well for my purpose ; 
 and I was doing you no mischief; bull 
 will at once tell you, that I had motives 
 for my conduct, in which you had not 
 the least concern. Flamall had not only 
 kept this whole transaction from me ; but 
 had refused to assist me in a difficulty of 
 my own ; and it behoved me to have him 
 in my power. Had he knov/n your 
 chances in life, he would not have sworn

 you made love to his sister, nor would he 
 have effected it, but for his wife. Your

 saw there was a plot brewing to ruin your 
 poor wife, as well as yourself; for that

 this occasion, whose rage was checked by 
 my arguments. Let it be noted by you

 You may judge, my Harriet, of the 
 sensations which assailed me, when he pro- 
 duced from its concealment, this evidence 
 of my birth, and irreparable ruin. It was 
 indeed the countenance of an angel which 
 met my eyes ! She was in a Spanish lia- 
 bit, the painting exquisitely finished and 
 enamelled. My expressions of grief and 
 despair touched Simons. '^ I am cursed," 
 said he, grasping my hand, '^ you recant, 
 you cannot forgive me ! but believe me, 
 or not, I wished to serve you. I was fully 
 convinced that I shoiild succeed in tracing 
 these men, whom I have nuntioned ; and 
 by this means your father and mother. 
 They are noble and rich, the picture 
 frame was finished by a ducal coronet ; it 
 grieved me to break it; but it was una- 
 voidable. 1 could have proved your iden- 
 tity, and given such evidences of Mrs. 
 Duncan's death, and the circumstances 
 which had thrown you into the hands of 
 villains as would have been unanswerable.

 But I am taken In my own tolls," added 
 he, with vehement and dreadful imprecati-

 I wished to be so." I again soothed him, 
 and by dwelling on my hopes of procur- 
 ing my liberty, I solemnly engaged to take 
 care of him to the utmost of my power.

 with more composure. " You have con- 
 vinced me that virtue is not a convention 
 of interest, nor religion a lie. There was 
 a time, when my conduct disgraced 
 neither ; but I was young, and had passions 
 to gratify which your creed did not suit.

 Misery, my Harriet, does not harden

 for this unhappy creature's recovery and 
 comfort; and insensibly he beca- e my 
 consolation, for, with a fertility of inven- 
 tion, he suggested so many ways of reach- 
 ing Gibraltar, and from thence the ob- 
 ject of my wishes, that hope was renewed. 
 His communications from time to time 
 gratified my curiosity ; although the sub- 
 ject of it was diverted to a less interesting 
 concern than you, my beloved wife. Si- 
 mons spoke of you, in term's of kindness 
 and pity. " Then again/* said he, " I 
 was a rascal ; for 1 knew tliat her worthy 
 father died in good circumstances, though 
 without having secured to her a provision ; 
 yet I held my tongue ; and was continued 
 in my office with an advanced stipend.

 advantage ; and with this scheme in his 
 head, she was treated with kindness un-

 of his wife, who had hoped to see herself 
 acknowledged as Mrs. Flamall.** ^' And 
 wherefore does he keep his marriage a 
 secret, even from his sister ?'* asked I. 
 â€¢'He has solid reasons," replied he, "for 
 keeping the lady in the back ground ; her 
 alliance is not the most honourable. Some 
 business in which she and her uncle were 
 useful to Mr. Flamall, obliged him to 
 purchase her uncle's evidence, and to si- 
 lence hers as being his wife ; but in return 
 Flamall can any day lie pleases hang old 
 Peachley." I was now, my Harriet, cir- 
 cumstantially informed of a transaction 
 which I shall spare my pen the task of going 
 over with you. But it opened such a 
 scene of wickedness as to leave no doubts 
 on my mind, that your brother was fully

 you were in the power of a man, who^ to 
 use Simons's words, "wrote more hands 
 than any .i an in the profession ; and with 
 an exactness so unrivalled, that he could 
 impose on the Devil himself.'* 
 
 On the evening of our fourth day's tedi-

 could speak a few words of English, and as 
 many of Spanish. He examined me with 
 attention. My youth and appearance 
 pleased him^ but unfortunately the people 
 who had conducted us from the ship^, had 
 received an impression which they gave to 
 him, and poor Simons was judged to be my 
 domestic. You know that his person is 
 not conciliating, and it was in vain that I 
 discovered the interest I took in his fate. 
 We were separated ; my master taking me 
 with him tlie next morning to a house and 
 garden, several leagues from the town, in 
 which he was ruler. Here my philosophy 
 was checked. I was seized by an ardent

 fever, and for many days they thought me 
 dying. Nature resisted the attack^ I was 
 treated humanely, and till I had strength 
 to crawl into the garden^ and to seek the 
 shade, they assiduously carried me to the 
 fountain, which tliey perceived I liked. 
 But my grief was beyond tfieir kind 
 offices ; I had Jost my mother's picture, 
 and I understood that my patron had it. 
 He at length condescended to visit me ; 
 for I believe he thought me a man above 
 tlie common sort. My tears and intreaties 
 produced nothing. He replied, that the 
 lady pleased him, ** it was pretty/' and by 
 Mohammed he would keep the painting. 
 To soften this obduracy he sent me my 
 books and linen ; and' I was given to un-

 my bondage in the mean time kept hope 
 ahve ; for although I had the habit, and 
 tlie badge of slavery, I had no cause for 
 complaint. As my strength recruited, I 
 was employed in light labour in the garden, 
 and my mind \^as engaged by assiduously 
 learning the Moorish language. Again, 
 and again, I pleaded for the society of my 
 friend, but in vain. At length I was told 
 that he was dead ; and the first use I made 
 of my more familiar knowledge of the lan- 
 guage, gave me the detailed circumstances 
 of his miserable end. His grief and im- 
 patience on being separated from me was 
 shown in a manner which the people about 
 him neither understood, nor pitied. He 
 refused food, and they chastised his obsti- 
 nacy. He became more determined, and 
 he was left to himself and time^for the 
 remedy. Nature at length conquered ; 
 he asked for food by signs expressive of 
 his wants and submission ; and they in-

 rice and water^ of which he ate and drank 
 so voraciously^ that he died in great ago- 
 nies, a few hours after. 
 
 I found in this relation, my Harriet, 
 my last human tie disolved; and I deplor- 
 ed the loss of a man, whom in happier 
 circumstances of forlunCj I should, it is 
 probable, have scorned for his vices, and 
 condemned as a being, lost to every virtu- 
 ous feeling; but isolated as I stood, Si- 
 mons was a prop, and I could not think of 
 him as a man who had outlived humanity. 
 But to return to my more immediate pur- 
 pose. My patron, pleased with my rapid 
 progress in his language, now became a 
 pupil for mine, and with much curiosity 
 he would listen to my reading and imper- 
 fect translations of tiic English authors - 
 but he soon relaxed fron: his ardour, the

 duced no compassion, he had long desired 
 to have anEnghshman in his house, and as 
 such I should by any apphcation at Algiers 
 have brought him into trouble with the 
 Dey ; he therefore chose to believe that 1 
 was of Spanish origin. My mother's 
 picture was an evidence of this, for he had 
 seen Spanish ladies, although none so 
 beautiful. Judge of the torments I en- 
 dured, when in saying this he would pro- 
 duce the picture, and comaient on its 
 superlative beauties. Thus passed the 
 first three ^^ears of my captivity, and my 
 incessant and defeated projects of escaping 
 to Algiers. At this period my patron re- 
 moved to a more distant province ; and I 
 was further removed from every hope. 
 Two years more were passed in that lan- 
 gour. of mind, which the annihilation of 
 hope occasioned. My master discovered, 
 that he had gained no advantage from hav- 
 ing an English^ slave. I was too feeble 
 for labour, and too pensive for his amuse-

 ment ; and without a scruple of conscience, 
 or a mark of regret, he exchanged me for 
 a fine Arabian horse which pleased him ; 
 and with the most unpitying indifference 
 refused to restore to me my mothers's pic- 
 ture, saying, that I had been a costly 
 bargain. 
 
 With my new master, my toils were in- 
 cessant ; but to what purpose should I lie- 
 tail these years of misery to my Harriet ? 
 Wherefore should I attempt to delineate 
 chaos^ in which nothing of my former 
 train of thought appeared, but the remem- 
 brance of the wife whom I had left in the 
 power of a demon ? It would be a fruit- 
 less attempt to give language to feelings, 
 which at times overpowered my reason. 
 But man, my Harriet, is no less incom- 
 prehensible, than the power which has enâ€ž 
 dued him with the force to resist suffer- 
 ing. In the days of ease and enjoyment;

 I had so laboriously served, during his 
 wandering desultory journeys, in his traf- 
 fic of buying female slaves. To my un- 
 speakable relief, I found that I was, with 
 others in my master's suite, furnished with 
 a horse for our journey, of which each 
 rider had the care, and my good for- 
 tune for once appeared. One of the most 
 valuable of these beautiful animals was 
 suddenly seized with an indisposition, 
 which must, in a few hours, have proved 
 fatal from the means used to preserve his 
 life. My master despaired of his recovery ; 
 and I ventured to propose copious bleed- 
 ing. My advice was taken, and I was the 
 operator; the horse recovered, and my 
 favour was established. Our journey ter- 
 minated at my master's home, and we be- 
 came stationary. His only son, a youth

 him, not displeased by the modes of in-

 out hope, that my example and precepts

 a common man, adding, that I knew all

 and our eyes met. Good God ! when I

 and I saw, yes, my Harriet ! I saw 
 the tear roll down his venerable face. 
 Here, for a time, was my harbour of re-

 listened to my tale of woe, and whether it 
 arose from the suggestion of an enlightened 
 reason, or from the benevolence of his 
 heart, he neither blamed me for adhering 
 to my rehgion, nor recommended to me

 with a smile, '^ be discreet Ibrahim, and

 bowed in silence, and I gave no offence by

 you freedom, and the means of returni ig

 here, and close my eyes." I, with grati- 
 tude, accepted of those lerms ; and, some 
 months before he died, he had, in pre- 
 sence of the official magistrate, formally 
 registered my freedom. He had, more- 
 over, the precaution to give me a purse of 
 gold, which he ordered me to secrete, 
 saying, that his death might leave m.e pen- 
 nyless, as he could not trust to the gene- 
 rosity of those who might succeed him. I 
 was faithful to my benefactor ; and in hea- 
 ven we shall again be friends ! 
 
 I met with no impediment after his de- 
 cease in the steps I took for my farther 
 enlargement, and at length with my little 
 treasure I reached Alexandria, where I 
 found a French vessel ready to sail for 
 Marseilles, in which I embarked as a pas-

 expert seaman. Our navigation was te- 
 dious, and the captain an ignorant babbler. 
 For amusement, I had recourse to my ac- 
 tivity; and, in the exercise on deck, I saw 
 that the vessel was badly manoeuvred, and 
 in a crazy condition ; keeping us con- 
 stantly at the pump, and under apprehen- 
 sions for ovir safety. Inured to labour, 
 and cheerfully giving my time to the com- 
 mon relief of all, I became a favourite 
 v/ith the sailors, which providentially saved 
 their lives and my own. Within a few 
 leagues of our port we met with rough 
 weather ; and a swelling sea succeeded the 
 gale, which was only formidable to a ship 
 in the condition of ours. The leak gained 
 upon us rapidly, and the captain, in de- 
 spair, gave orders for the longboat to be 
 prepared, and for each man to think of 
 his preservation. The night was dark, 
 and the peril obvious, in an attempt to 
 reach land in the boat. My argamients

 to the boat^ aud saw her sink before we 
 had gone half a furlong. We reached, 
 however, the port, and the shipwrecked 
 Duncan, once more saw himself poor and 
 friendless; but I was/r^^. I looked at my 
 muscular arms and I smiled ; for I was in^ 
 dependent ; and quitting my companions, 
 who were reheved from their necessities by 
 the charity they solicited, I repaired to a 
 house, in order to replenish my strength 
 with bread of my own. My slender purse 
 sufficed, however, for my wants. I had 
 enough to buy me the dress of a seaman, 
 and fortunately finding an American ship 
 bound for London, I offered myself as a 
 shipwrecked Englishman, uiilingto worlc 
 my passage hojne. Something in n.y voice 
 and manner betrayed my feelings, when I 
 pronounced the word home. The captain 
 had the heart of a man, and I was told, to 
 take my birth '^ on board" that very even-

 for he pitied me. During the voyage my 
 quiet melancholy and some accidental dis- 
 courses of '^ my learningr^ to use the wor- 
 thy captain's word, so augmented the in- 
 terest his benevolence_ had excited in my 
 behalf, that, on reaching our port, he aiked 
 ine what were my intentions respecting my 
 future employment. I replied that my first 
 care would be to seek out di. friend ^ who, if 
 found, would determine my fate, and pro- 
 bably place me beyond the reach of pe- 
 nury. " But you may not find him," re- 
 plied he, viewing with attention emotions 
 which I was unable to check. " Let me 
 advise you to keep where you are, till you 
 can do better. I like you, and will retain 
 you as ship steward ; you are a good sea- 
 man and an honest capable man ; and may 
 be the maker of your own fortune." I 
 rejected this offer, saying, that I knew not 
 whether my private concerns would permit 
 me to leave England so soon as he would.

 me when we met. You have more than 
 done that fellow's duty, and you are justly 
 entitled to your wages." He placed ten 
 guineas in my hand, and added, that whilst 
 the ship was at her moorings, he thought 
 I might as well make her my '' head quar- 
 ters," as she would give me a bed and

 blished themselves in the square ; and even 
 that had changed, in many respects, its 
 former aspect ; for I scarcely saw on the 
 doors a name that I could recall to my 
 memory. Yet to this spot was I irresistibly 
 drawn, and for hours together have I 
 paced it. One day, and towards its close, 
 I perceived that I excited the curiosity of 
 the people who passed me ; and that one 
 person in particular was observing me 
 from the window of that abode, in which 
 I had tasted of the cup of bliss, in order, as 
 it should seem, to know more acutely that 
 of v/retchedness. I instinctively turned 
 down a passage leading into Ormond 
 Street. In passing a small sliop, the win- 
 dow of which displayed, with the food of 
 the poor, the humble luxuries of penny 
 pies and tarts, I stopped with others, in

 whose property had been invaded by a child

 tected in stealing a tart. Her fury was 
 subdued by some one who paid for the de- 
 linquent's trespass ; and the collected 
 persons continued their way with the 
 weeping and terrified girl. From the train 
 of thought which this little incident had 
 produced in my mind, I was recalled to 
 the consideration of the Harridan's face, 
 who wondering probably at mine, and my 
 remaining before her door, asked me what 
 I wished for. I instantly recognized the 
 girl, when in former times I had daily 
 passed at her station near the passage I was 
 then in, where sitting by, a wheelbarrow, 
 she sold her similar commodities, and 
 exhibited a face, which time could not 
 change ; for a claret coloured mark so 
 completely covered one side of it, as to 
 form a half mask; and with this defect she

 was often a visitor in a family, who then 
 resided in Red Lion vSquare ; but that I

 From the hour that Maclairn's wife has

 I had incurred ; for I felt that the woman

 Heaven, in compassion to my contrition-

 opinion, there can be no criminality In a 
 concealment which secures to the inno-

 to me with more confidence; and I liope 
 in time to convince 'her, that to di^chjse a 
 secret which cannot produce, pitiier di- 
 rectly or indirectly, any benefic .li effect 
 to those who must, on ihe contra. ., suf- 
 fer from such a disclosure, would partake 
 more of folly than wisricn. 
 
 In this conclusion I am guided by the

 moreover, I cannot help 'placing in the 
 balance, the whole train of eve-its which 
 have led astray from the paths of rectitude, 
 a mind constituted hke Lady Maclairn's ;

 gest, without a crime, the reasonableness 
 and utility of suppressing that '' truth 
 which ought not to be spoken at all times;" 
 the produce which regulates oar zeal, and 
 imposes silence, is no violation of truth. 
 These are my arguments with poor Lady

 insist, that she has for years been practising

 lence^ to preserve the peace and tranquillity 
 of her husband and son.

 nalty annexed to the concealment of error 
 and duplicity by an ingenuous mind, even 
 when that concealment is quabfied by the 
 powerful motives of preserving the peace 
 and interest of all around us, what, I 
 ask, must be the horrors of the mind, 
 which covers, with a veil of darkness, the 
 fraud intended to ruin the innocent, to 
 betray the unsuspecting, and to defraud 
 the ignorant ? What must be the state 
 and condition of those whose life is a lie?

 I cannot form a more appalling idea of a 
 state of future punishment, than in the 
 contemplation of the hypocrite's terrors 
 even in this hfe. What must be the life 
 of a person, whom deceit and treachery 
 have made responsible for his safety to a 
 confederate, as ^lepraved and dishonest as 
 h:n self ; living under the dread of the 
 chance of every moment fur open detec- 
 tion ; harassed with the conviction that 
 a more immediate interest, or m.ore spe- 
 cious promises, will convert the sharer of 
 his cri res into an informer and accuser, 
 whom he dares not confront ? "What can 
 equal the pang which must at times pierce 
 his bosom v/hen be recollects, tl'at he en- 
 joys the confider.ce and favoifr of his fel- 
 low creatures, only because they do not

 she is his rival with Rachel Cowley. We

 of a master we both wish to serve and obey, 
 that the ^' strong help the weak." God

 both have their use, when in the discharge 
 of that duty, which I am bound to perform

 her dear sister thinking, as she told me, 
 that the poor girl was losing her spirits. 
 I, knowing that she thought of every one's 
 comforts, consented to my good friend's 
 wish of showing Lydia some kindness. 
 The very evening they left us, Caroline 
 turned her discourse on Nora, praising 
 the letters she had written to us, and, with 
 her perfect charity, hoping all things. '* I 
 do not repent, my good child," said

 around me, Sir Murdoch, and weeping, 
 added, '^ to shelter her from reproach and 
 shame." I turned faint and giddy ; and 
 my daughter gave me her salts. Oh ! if 
 you could but have heard what she said, 
 you would not wonder at what I "have

 and she lives to tell me again, that she was 
 going to a Heavenly Father, from one who 
 imitated him in lenity to his offending off- 
 spring. There was, in her look, some- 
 thing which poured joy and comfort into 
 my broken heart. I only wish I could go

 time before we went to Bath. She said 
 he was like many foolish young men, tired 
 of being remote from temptation ; and 
 that he had gained, with much difficulty, 
 her father's consent to seek a place in 
 London, as a valet, or a butler, being well 
 qualified for both ; she was quite unhappy 
 that he should be left to his own guidance 
 till he was fixed in a sober family ; seeing 
 he was a very likely young man, and quite 
 a stranger. So my wife, who never is be-

 hind hand in good nature, said he might 
 come to Putney, and we were well pleased 
 with him, and engaged him to attend us 
 to Bath. Poor Lydia has been honest 
 with Mrs. Tomkins. The young fellow 
 was not so much in fault as herself : she 
 confessed that she sought him. However, 
 this was not the question with me ; we 
 might perhaps have hushed up this busi- 
 ness ; such things are done, as they say, 
 every day : but what follows? a crime, 
 in my opinion, ten times worse than Ly- 
 dia*s ; being, as it were, committed in cool 
 blood ; for what can be more dishonest 
 than passing off a deluded girl for a chaste 
 one ? and depriving a poor innocent babe 
 of a father, and a name. I could not do 
 such an act of injustice ; being convinced 
 that it would be doing what I should 
 not think just in another to do by me.

 proud of as one may say, yet it went some 
 how to my heart, that a child of mine 
 should be pointed at by scorn and derision. 
 He is a worthy and a wise man, and agrees 
 with Mr. Tomkins, that the best thing I 
 can do, is to let these young simpletons 
 be married ; the girl being half distracted 
 with the fear of losing sight of Vv^illiam ; 
 and he being willing to take her, as he 
 told the friend we employed, Mrs. Tom- 
 kins's mother, that he would work for her 
 to his life's end, and show his good master 
 that it was not his money he wished for. 
 I find his parents are honest people, though 
 low in the world ; they had a farm within 
 six miJes of York, but by losses amongst 
 their cattle things went backward, and 
 being in arrears for rent when their lease 
 expired, they lost the farm. William 
 was then about eighteen, had received 
 good learning, and was a sober, steady 
 lad ; but a Utde pride made him discon- 
 tented ; and he did not hke to work as a

 father cultivated in that way, near York, 
 and which, as he says, in excuse for his 
 leaving his parents, could only produce a 
 maintainance for them, and that he was 
 only a burden on the ground. So all was 
 fixed for the marriage, and we thought 
 no time was to be lost. 
 
 I am not quite pleased with my wife, 
 Sir Murdoch, although I know she is as 
 harmless as^an infant ; yet it grieves me 
 to see that she will always be an infant. 
 She was absent a whole month from Put- 
 ney ; and whilst Caroline was thus em- 
 ployed, and thus disturbed, she was taking 
 her pleas 1,1 re with people she knew nothing 
 of, arKl who!n all honest and sober mind- 
 ed persons would shun. During eight 
 days she waited forsooth, for the cap-

 Mrs. Serge to travel without an escort, as 
 he calls a puppy. I remembered the time,

 I shall say nothing of my poor wife's 
 hysterics, when I told her how matters 
 stood with Lydia. She was terribly bad 
 indeed ! But, thank God, these fits are 
 not dangerous, as the doctors say ; and ex-

 opinion ; for, I know one .of my wife's 
 old friends, who has been subject to them 
 twenty years. No sooner had my poor 
 Lydia got the better of hers on this trying 
 occasion, than she lamented her hard case, 
 saying, with many tears and much anger, 
 that she should never be able to shew her 
 face again amongst fashionable people ; 
 and that no one but myself would ever 
 have thought of sinking their family by

 always doing for the best, and who is said 
 never to do right. And I very roundly 
 told her^ that all the plagues of my life 
 were owing to fashionable people^ as ^\q 
 called gabblers and pickpockets; and if, 
 added I, that were all the mischief, I 
 should be tempted to thank William Wil-

 might have learned a lesson of more value

 looked confounded, and wept in silence* 
 No man loves peace more than I do ; my

 that I would do ; and that the following

 does not run away with her simple under-

 call upon me for diligence in the settling

 left you, and my dear friend Mr. Malcolm

 for the support of the ignorant and help- 
 less, and a wall of defence for the innocents 
 who may spring from my daughter's im- 
 prudent marriages. I a^m led to'hope that 
 you will not refuse me this kindness. You

 prepared. He has been my right-hand

156 LADY MACLAIRN, 
 
 with me is the basis of affection. The 
 relief which she finds in communicating 
 her thoughts to me, has given to her very- 
 language a frankness which appears to be 
 her natural character ; and in her account 
 of the various occurrences of her life, 
 since she married Sir Murdoch, she omits 
 not even her conjectures, as these arose 
 from the circumstances in which she has 
 been placed. " I long since had proofs,'' 
 said she this morning, when speaking of 
 the suffering Miss Fhnt, "^ that Lucretia 
 was not devoid of feehng. My brother? 
 for reasons of his own, had so contrived 
 it, that she firmly held an opinion which 
 he^ it is probable, only affected to have. 
 Illegitimate birth he considered as an inde- 
 lible disgrace on the innoceni ; and Miss 
 Flint adopted this notion, firmly believ- 
 ing that neither fortune, talents, nor even 
 virtue could screen an unfortunate being, 
 who stood in this predicament, from th^e 
 reproach and insults of the malicious.

 Her affection for her child was unbound- 
 ed ; and I saw with comfort, that I had 
 at least gained her gratitude^ by my apos- 
 tacy from truth. The conduct she main- 
 tained with my brother, in the mean time, 
 puzzled me. It was obvious, he was no 
 longer the favoured lover ; and one day, 
 observing Philip much disturbed from an 
 interview he had with her in the garden 
 at Kensington, I ventured to say to Lu- 
 cretia, that I was sorry to see Philip un- 
 happy. ^' I understand you/' replied 
 she, " and I will be explicit with you. I 
 shall never be his wife ; nor will I be to 
 him what I unfortunately have been. I am 
 a mother^ Harriet, and I will prove myself 
 one, by remaining what I am, and what I 
 can contrive to be, the guardian of my 
 son. I have no passions to gratify, no de- 
 sires to control, since I beheld the face of 
 my child ; to love and cherish him, and 
 to bless you for your goodness, shall fill 
 up the measure of my miserable days."

 She burst into tears and left me abruptly. 
 Her sincerity wanted no evidence stronger 
 than her conduct, continued Lady Mac- 
 lairn. For some time all went well. I 
 was made haj>py through her mediation, 
 and amongst the delusive hopes, which 
 led me to Farefield Hall as Maclairn's 
 M ife, was the flattering one, that, by the 
 influence I had acquired over Lucretia, I 
 might in time reconcile her to Mrs. How- 
 ard. Mr. Flamall frustrated these designs. 
 His affections, as a parent, were so artfully, 
 so effectually brought forward, and his 
 conduct was so specious, that Lucretia in- 
 sensibly gave him a confidence, which as 
 gradually subjected her to his will and 
 pleasure as myself; and she observed, that 
 nature had yet preserved one strong hold 
 in Flamall's bosom ; for that he loved his 
 child ; and that would prove to ,her a 
 source of future comfort ; for that no man 
 was more capable of the office of precep- 
 tor. Even I assented to this opinion. Miss

 Cowley as it related to his talents ; and I 
 was still the dupe of that affection, which 
 nature had interwoven with my frame for 
 my brother. He became more serious and 
 reserved from the hour of Philij)'s birth^ 
 and in the regularity of his conduct, and 
 the instances 1 had of his growing parsi- 
 mony, I scrupled not to think that he was 
 a changed man in many respects, although 
 still unsubdued in his love of power. As 
 Philip became of an age to receive his les- 
 son s, his visits at the hall might be called 
 a residence ; but you know already how 
 little these visits were productive of com- 
 fort to me, and, I may likewise add, of 
 comfort to Miss Flint; for my brother 
 was a rigid disciplinarian ; and had not 
 the child's temper been one of the most 
 docile and sweet, he would have been mi- 
 serable ; for my brother, guided by his 
 acquaintance with vice, understood not 
 that the path to virtue is pleasant, and to 
 unperverted fcet^ and a pure hearty has al-

 time, that it was best for me to be " pru-

 his tone and manner were sufficient, and 
 he repeatedly roused Lucretia to stand 
 forth as my chim[:^ion, on a ground which 
 had made me a coward, and the slave of the 
 wretch who had icd m.e into the crooked 
 path. " Her conduct v>as, at least, uni- 
 formly generous on this point," continued 
 Lady Maclairn ; " she never, directly nor 
 indirectly, mentioned Duncan, nor did I, 
 till very lately, know to what extent her 
 knowledge went of this unhappy at^'air. I

 time I Ijad the unfortunate Mr. Duncan'j 
 narrative before me, my soul abhorred the 
 sight of my brother; and I so entirely se- 
 cluded myself in my husband's apartment^, 
 that we did not meet twice in a week, and 
 his reserve and coldness when we did, went 
 not beyond mine. Again, my dear Miss 
 Cowley, truth obliges me to give a good 
 report of Miss Flint. In proportion as my 
 spirits flagged she redoubled her attention 
 to my wants, and her purse was ever open 
 to me. I believe, that my brother's rea- 
 son for going to Jamaica, originally sprung 
 from a serious quarrel with Lucretia. The 
 death of his wicked wife left him free to 
 marry, and he was very pressing on that 
 subject with Miss Flint. Lucretia had 
 her secrets as well as myself; but accident 
 led me within, reach of hearing her say, 
 '' Never ; urge me no further ; for by all 
 that is sacred, if you do, Percival shall 
 know all." I retreated, fearing to be dis- 
 covered ; and, from that time, his voyage

 my brother's departure, Lncretia fatigued

 from my husband's room. ** I should have 
 a servant to watch him ; and one I could

 of her niece, and 1 was consulted on the 
 expediency of her inviting this poor girl 
 to live with htr ; I was distressed for a re- 
 ply ; knowing the bitter resentment which 
 she had nourished even to the name of 
 Howard ; an'd her hatred to those who had 
 sheltered this unfortunate and excellent 
 couple. I evaded the question as well as 
 I could, contenting myself with observing, 
 that I had always thought it an act of duty 
 on her part to take care of her niece. *' I 
 am willing to do so ;" answered she co- 
 louring ; "but I must first know what 
 she is good for ; and whether the people 
 with whom she lives have not taught her to

 storm, and timidly shrunk from it^ saying, 
 that 1 could not give her my advice, with- 
 out incurring the censure of being swayed 
 by a sordid consideration for my reputed 
 son. '' But you know/' added I, " that 
 you can provide for both these young peo- 
 ple ; and you -must determine their- re- 
 spective claims." Poor Mary soon after 
 exchanged her abode of peace, for this, 
 and the event has confirmed my fears. 
 Ti>e gentle and timid Mary neither gained 
 spirits here, nor strove to amuse her aunt's. 
 She had but one path, it was to submit in 
 silence to her aunt's temper, and to antici- 
 pate her commands by her diligence. She 
 soon perceived the fatal habit which Lu- 
 cretia indulged ; and this produced terror 
 and disgust in her innocent mind, which, as 
 you will believe, did not tend to conciliate 
 her to her aunt's hardships. I did all that 
 I could do, to soften the one and encou- 
 rage the other; but my interference was

 allied to her enemies, and blinded by 
 Malcolm to favour the Heartleys. 
 
 I was temjited, Lucy, to hazard some 
 questions, with a direct reference to Sir 
 Murdoch's suspicion of having been poi- 
 soned ; but a moment's reflection checked 
 my curiosity ; and I diverted her attention 
 from perceiving my cmbarassmcnt, by 
 asking her, whether she knew what was 
 become of the gentleman's poi trait, and 
 the papers, which so obviously appeared 
 to have belonged to Mr. Duncan's story ? 
 She unaffectedly answered, that, Sir Mur- 
 doch had, when in London to m.cet me, 
 consigned them into the hands of the Spa- 
 nish minister, then resident there ; and in 
 the interview," added she, '' he learned 
 that this nobleman was not totally 'a stranger 
 to the fate of Duncan's parents ; they were 
 dead ; and a distant branch of the family 
 was in possession of the title and immense

 which no time nor repentance can reme-

 every law of justice ! I endeavour to hope

 brother's dress, she said, I hope, Percival, 
 you do not mourn that poor OUver has 
 given to a brother who stood by him as a 
 son, an inheritance that ought in the eye 
 of justice to have been yours. The cap- 
 tain coloured, and replied with eagerness, 
 that he was perfectly contented with the 
 proofs he had received of his brother's 
 consideration. He has rendered me com- 
 fortable, added he, for the remainder of, 
 my life, and has placed Mary in a condi-

 She spoke this with agony. 
 
 My dear Lucretia, said the captain 
 hastily, and startled at the disorder she 
 was in, let us drop a subject so useless. I 
 have no wants, no wishes ungratified, but 
 that of seeing you well. 1 cannot bear 
 your kindness, replied the poor weeping- 
 Miss Flint ; I have not deserved it ! Say 
 not so to me, answered the brother with 
 tenderness. We have all, my dear 
 sister, to make this acknowledgment to 
 our Maker. We have all of us errors to 
 regret, and something for contrition, but 
 wc have a merciful Judge, who knows that 
 we are weak and fr.Uible : let me conjure 
 you to endcjvour to recover your spirits.

 that your malady is augmented 1 :y the de-

 you are in the hands of a Being infinite in 
 mercy. Would you like to have Mary 
 with you ? She wishes to see you, and 
 might be useful to you. I could not bear 
 to see her, answered Miss Fhnt with a 
 voice broken by sorrow ; but it is not from 
 unkindness, that I reject her, it is not 
 hatred nor cruelty that govern me. I am 
 certain it is not, replied the captain ; No : 
 my dear sister ! their empire is over; and 
 a temper, to which worlds would be no- 
 thing in the balance, has now a place in 
 your heart. Oh ! live to enjoy the blessed 
 exchange ! live for my comfort ! 
 
 " I thought his sister must have fainted," 
 continued Mrs. Allen, wiping the tears of 
 sympathy from her honest face ; and I 
 hinted that she wanted her cordial. The 
 captain understood me, and 1 believe 
 would have gladly retired himself and left 
 her to my care ; for he rose and observed, 
 he had staid too long, and that she needed 
 rest. Rest, repeated she, detaining him,

 composure observed, that she had pro- 
 mised him coffee : and that he would re- 
 main, on condition she would try to be 
 quiet and listen to our chat. She smiled, 
 and I took my post. 
 
 Again he offered to leave her, when, 
 with composure, she said, my dear Perci-

 distress you ; but I shall not be easy until 
 I have finally settled my concerns with

 presence. 
 
 Here is a present for my niece. May it 
 prove to her, what of late it has been to 
 me, a blessing ! The captain paced the 
 room in silence. This picture, my dear 
 and invaluable friend, continued she, ad- 
 dressing me, you will see buried with me. 
 She gazed intently on the m.iniature of 
 Mr. Philip Flint, which she wears in her 
 bosom. Poor fellow ! added she mourn- 
 fully, he will not soon forget Lucretia ! 
 He will regret that he was not with me.â€” ^ 
 I cannot stand this ! said the agitated cap- 
 tain, and were I not convinced, Lucretia, 
 that even in this depression of your mind, 
 there is a healing power more potent than 
 all human aids, you would break my 
 heart. â€” I will spare your feelings, answered 
 she, only let me say a few words more : I 
 wish to have your concurrence. I have 
 nominated Mr. Greenwood to succeed 
 Snughead in the Farcfield living ; but if

 you think he would like rhe presentation 
 better from you, speak, and it shall be so 
 managed. '' I do not believe/' added 
 Mrs. Allen, '' that the captain could have 
 uttered a word, had his friend's being 
 made an archbishop depended on it ; he 
 was quite overcome by his feelings." 
 
 '^ At length he ventured to say, should 
 you like to see Mr. Greenwood ? He 
 would be f-orry to see me, replied she ; he 
 is a good man, and will pity me ; but I 
 wish not to see him. I have no want of 
 his assistance ; she raised her eyes to Hea- 
 ven, and paused. " You may imagine," 
 continued Mrs. Allen, *' that her exer- 
 tions had subdued her. The captain no 
 sooner left her, than she went to her bed ; 
 and I have the comfort of quitting her in 
 a peaceful sleep." 
 
 This recital, my Lucy, will affect poor 
 Mary ; but it will do her no harm hereaf- 
 ter. Her mind wants firmness for the 
 trials of life ; and she must acquire strength

 by the usual means. I have occasion for 
 more patience and fortitude than I possess, 
 I tremble for the consequences which will 
 result to Mrs. Allen, should Miss Flint 
 continue long in her present condition. 
 What will you say to the cares and atten- 
 tion that devote my dear friend to her 
 room the whole day ? What will you say 
 to her swelled legs, got by watching her 
 through half the night ? Will it be any 
 comfort to you, wlien she is on a sick bed, 
 to be told that her piety and prayers are 
 the cordials that quiet the perturbed spirit 
 of tlie miserable invalid } I have yet 
 much to do with my rebellious one ; and I 
 honestly confess^ that, sincerely as I rejoice 
 at Miss FHnt's present temper of mind, I 
 should murmur to give a saint to her fu- 
 neral obsequies. My serious remonstrances 
 have answered ; Mrs. Allen is gone to 
 bed, and I will take care she shall not quit 
 it to-night, to traverse half clothed, the 
 passages to that of another.

 Malcolm; all the business which occa-

 had exerted himself too much ; and the 
 gout had overtaken him. Malcolm adds, 
 that the doctor regards this indisposition 
 as favourable to his friend's general 
 health, and that he is chief nurse ; Mrs- 
 Fairly attends her mother with assiduity, 
 though unwell herself; she is, he says, 
 the shadow of the Leonora we 4cnow, and 
 he thinks her in a consurnption. Her

 nued to read and chat with my friend till' 
 near the dining hour. The appearance 
 of Doctor Douglass was nothing new ; 
 but we were equally struck with his man- 
 ner and countenance ; and her ladyship, 
 with alarm, asked him, whether Lucretia 
 was worse. '^ No/' rephed he, with vi- 
 sible distress, '^ there is no material 
 change ; but she has asked for you." La- 
 dy Maclairn immediately quitted us to go 
 to her sister's room. '' She is dying," 
 observed I, *' you think so, lam certain ; 
 why do you flatter Lady Maclairn with 
 hopes ?" *' Poor creature !" answered he,

 port, there would then be little to justify 
 my fears for her ; but I am a coward,

 compassion, ^' that you seem destined,

 iTiy strength of mind is no virtue." He 
 grasped my hand, and said some words, 
 expressive of his approbation, then pro- 
 ceeded to inform me, that Captain Flint 
 had found on his table the preceding even- 
 ing, on returning from his sister's, the

 sent for," added the doctor, '^ and we 
 passed nearly the whole night in reading 
 the contents, and consuhino- the best 
 means of communicating them to Lady 
 Maclairn. The captain declared he wag 
 unable to do it ; and thought himself pe- 
 culiarly disqualified for the office, it be- 
 ing no secret, that he despised the man, 
 and was not surprised at his end. '' I have 
 no heart on such occasions," continued 
 Douglass, rising and pacing the room. I

 death of the wicked. There are the let- 
 ters ; I will leave ^^ou for an hour and then 
 return ; you may want me as a physician.'* 
 To the hasty perusal of them, followed 
 my thanks to Providence for the absence 
 of Sir Murdoch ; and without suffering 
 the energy of my mind to relax, I sent for 
 Lady Maclairn to my room. She instantly 
 perceived my emotion, and I at once ac- 
 knowledged that I had bad news to com- 
 municate from Jamaica ; and which Cap- 
 tain Flint was unequal to the task of do- 
 ing. She gasped for breath. " Nothing 
 can equal," continued I, '^ Mr. Philip

 I was terrified, for she did not faint as I 
 expected, but with her eyes fixed, and 
 with a deadly groan she articulated the 
 name of Duncan. I immediately per- 
 ceived the dreadful idea, which had ta- 
 ken possession of her mind. He is at 
 rest, my dear friend," said T, "and now 
 blessed for his faithfulness to you." I was 
 proceeding, but she heard me not. Hor- 
 ror had transfixed her to her seat. She 
 was as cold as marble, and not a tear 
 fell. I rang the bell with violence. The 
 doctor entered at the same m.oment ; he 
 instandy bled her, and she was put into 
 my bed. Douglass watched her, under 
 great uneasiness, until she appeared to me 
 to be dead. I really thought she w^as, 
 when her eyes closed and her stiffened 
 limbs relaxed. *' Take courage," said 
 he, '* the worst is passed ; she will reco-

 sobbings, and the death-like coldness of 
 her hand gave place to a friendly perspi- 
 ration. He guve her a cordial ; and or- 
 dering no one to disturb her by speaking, 
 I was left with her. By his orders, I net- 
 ther checked her tears^, nor evaded her en- 
 quiries. I believe, however, that she dosed 
 for some time, as not a sigh escaped her. 
 At length, putting aside the curtain, she 
 spoke, and I approached her. *^ Angel

 my hand, *' tell me^ has no one seen my

 she with anxiety, ^' Did nothing escape

 point, and at her request briefiy, and I

 more than his own. To Lady Maclairn 
 he sacrificed his fondest hopes, his venge- 
 ance on his oppressor, his ease in life, 
 and even the name of her faithful Duncan 
 to his last moments. Weep for him ! 
 continued I, with my eyes streaming ; 
 neither religion nor virtue forbid this tri- 
 bute to his memory ; but live to preserve 
 Sir Murdoch Maclairn's peace. " I 
 would die rather than dismrb it," said she 
 with agony. " It is my misery, my past 
 punishment, that whilst my soul mourns 
 the fate of a man ruined by my affection, 
 another not less worthy, not less beloved

 She promised me to be all I wished, 
 and to brace every nerve against her hus- 
 band's return. I think she is more com- 
 posed to day ; and at her request I have 
 been with Miss Flint. As I expected, she 
 began by lamenting her ladyship's sudden 
 indisposition, and added, that Percivai 
 also had a cold which prevented her see- 
 ing him. I gave her hopes of her sister's 
 speedy recovery, and endeavoured to keep 
 lip the conversation ; but she soon dosed, 
 which I find she again does half her time, 
 and I left her without being noticed.

 the first agitation of his spirits ; his amia- 
 ble wife is well, and as yet a stranger to 
 the shocking tale. I will now begin my 
 melancholy task. 
 
 The arrival of a large vessel in this port, 
 from New York, and commanded by 'a 
 Captain Nelson, may be assigned as one 
 of those cases which have produced the 
 event before me. In consequence of Mr. 
 Flamall's having a concern in the cargo, 
 he was induced to quit his retirement; 
 and to come to the Creek plantation, near 
 this place. To this circumstance I was a 
 stranger, however, having, as Mr. FHnt's 
 friend, dropped a man, generally con- 
 demned for his inflexibihty ; and at pre-, 
 sent forgotten by that society, which for 
 some time he had so carefully, and gloomi- 
 ly avoided. 
 
 I happened to be at the general rendez- 
 vous, a coffee-house here, when a mer- 
 chant, of the name of Gilpin, an inti- 
 mate friend of mine, entered, with Cap-

 tain Nelson, the newly arrived stranger. 
 I was presented to him by my friend : and, 
 in a way, which the captain and myself 
 both appeared to understand. I found, 
 that Mr. Gilpin had long known this 
 gentleman ; and in a few minutes 
 I thought I had long known him my- 
 self, from the frankness of his manner. 
 We were settling our plan for dining to- 
 gether ; when one of the waiters told Mr. 
 Nelson, that *^ Mr. Flamall was on horse- 
 back at the door, and wished to speak to 
 him for a minute." The captain instantly 
 obeyed the summons, and, in a few mi- 
 nutes, he returned to the room, and I 
 saw Flamall pass the window. I remarked 
 to some one near me, that he looked ill 
 and dejected. The captain, was now dis- 
 turbed by a more serious business. Some 
 one in the passage called loudly for assist- 
 ance ; and the captain was told, that '' his 
 steward was in the agonies of death in the 
 corridor." We flew to the spot ; and, as 
 a medical man, it became my duty to sue-

 cour the sick one. He had been suddenly 
 surprised, by the bursting of a large 
 blood vessel, and the case was critical and 
 justly alarming. I was, however, struck 
 by the uncommon interest which the 
 captain appeared to take in the poor man's 
 preservation. Every accommodation the 
 house could afford v/as speedily procured ; 
 and I saw my patient in a ^spacious bed- 
 room, with a negro woman for Iiis attend- 
 ant, whom I knew was a good nurse. 
 Some abatement of the haemorrhage, hav- 
 ing succeeded to bleeding in the arm, and 
 other remedies, I left him to his repose ; 
 and joined my friends at Mr. Gilpin's, 
 whose house was not remote from my pa- 
 tient. Captain Nelson listened to my ac- 
 count of him with the utmost anxiety. 
 ^' I would give half! am worth," said he, 
 grasping my hand, *^ to save tlirs man.'* 
 This complaint came on in a moment, 
 they tell me : he was apparently well when 
 I passed him ; and that was not five mi-

 ^ay it was a lit ; for they heard him groan, 
 and he rose from his seat, as if to seek 
 air, when he fell back and the blood 
 gushed from his mouth.'* 1 saw, in this 
 account, his hopes of the man's recovery ; 
 which I could not eacourage, and wished 
 not to depress. 
 
 After dinner he attended me to visit 
 him. ** I have known this man many 
 years/' said he. *' I have nodoaibt of his 
 having been unfortunate; his education 
 and manners speak the gentleman : his 
 conduct and industry the honest man. 
 His -reserve and dejection have imposed 
 on me a' respect for his misfortunes ; and 
 to this hour I only know, that his name 
 is Charles, and that he is a very extraord'i^ 
 nary man\ for his fidelity to me, has not 
 lessened his influence with my people; 
 who all love him as their best friend. To- 
 morrow morning, I shall bring his boy on 
 shore to be with him.'* ^' Then he has a

 Â«on ?" observed I. ^^ One of his adoption," 
 answered he ; '^ and his motives for -j(& 
 doing, will give you his character. I had 
 lost sight of him for some years, having 
 left him in London. In his passage from 
 thence to New York, where, as it appears, 
 he was as poor as when I first saw him, he 
 was a common seaman : one of the crew, 
 a native of New York fell sick and died on 
 the passage, recommending to Charles 
 his aged mother, and his child, this hoy. 
 He promised to take care of them, and he 
 kept his word ; for taking up his abode in 
 the old woman's miserable hovel, he sup- 
 ported the family by his labour. In this 
 situation, I again met him. The death of 
 the woman, and my offer to take the boy 
 with him, induced him to accept the post 
 of ship-steward on board my ship ; where 
 he has been several years. You will judge 
 oF him as a schoolmaster, when you see 
 George. ^* Poor lad !" continued the

 captain, '' he will break his heart ; but I 
 will be his friend." 
 
 I returned, to my patient, but did not 
 allow him to speak ; he was told that his 
 George would be with him in the morn- 
 ing, and his hand only was offered to the 
 captain. 
 
 On entering the room the following 
 day, I found George at his ' post. The 
 patient was raised by his pillows ; and one 
 of the finest youths, my eyes ever beheld, 
 filled the space they had left. He was 
 bending over the sick man, in an attitude 
 convenient for his head to rest on the 
 lad's shoulder, who was, as I judged, be- 
 -tween fifteen and sixteen, and in the full 
 vigour of youth. He raised his penetrat- 
 ing large black eyes to my face, whilst I 
 made my enquiries of the woman, relative 
 to the condition of his flither. Her replies 
 were not unfavourable ; and never shall I 
 forget the look of gratitude I then re- 
 ceived ! But overcome by his sensibility,

 he wept most bitterly, and hid his face. 
 Captain Nelson entered at this moment. 
 *' Why. how is this, my boy," cried he 
 endeavouring to hide his feelings, '' Did 
 you not promise to have a good heart ! 
 The doctor will soon set us all to rights 
 again ; so have courage." Tiie doctor^ 
 my dear Sir, was not so sanguine ; but 
 recommending silence and repose took his 
 leave : George assuring me, that he would 
 watch his father's eyes^ and those would 
 tell him what he wanted. In the evening 
 I was with him again. All was in order, 
 and a silence, like death, prevailed in the 
 room. George was reading a French Te- 
 lemachus ; the patient was dosing ; and 
 the negro woman was dismissed for some 
 hours of needful rest. The next day I 
 had hopes, that my patient had a chance ; 
 but the following morning I found, to my 
 surprise, only the nurse with him. On en- 
 quiry, I learned from her, that his father 
 had sent him with a letter to the Creek

 plantation. '^ Why did you not find a 
 porter r" asked I. " Because he said," 
 answered she, in a low whisper, '^ he 
 could not die contented^ unless he knew 
 that it was delivered to Mr. Fiamall." 
 Though by no means pleased with this ex- 
 ertion of writing, I said but little to the 
 sick mai, contenting myself with his an- 
 swer. ^' / shall write no more."" I pro- 
 longed my stay, partly to supply nurse's 
 absence, whom I sent for something need- 
 ful, and partly to gratify my curiosity. 
 The sick man's person was calculated to 
 excite it. His physiognomy was noble ; 
 his features regular ; dark blue eyes, which? 
 though sunk and dimmed by his condi- 
 tion, were expressive of manly fortitude* 
 his hair was of a light chestnut colour, but 
 in places, striped with the signs of age, 
 for it was even changed to nearly white ; 
 he was extremely fair ; and the paleness 
 of death was relieved, by a lingering co- 
 lour in his lips. Observing the beauty of

 his teeth, I asked hkn his age. He re- 
 plied, that he believed he was turned of 
 fifty. He was neatly dressed in a blue 
 and white cotton waistcoat and trowsers ; 
 and reclined on the outside of the matrass. 
 A statuary would not have wished for a 
 more perfect model of the human form ! 
 He was in height, I should think, within 
 six feet. I observed to him, that his 
 chest was not made to oppress his lungs ; 
 and that I flattered myself, the malady 
 which had so suddenly overtaken him, 
 might have for its course, a less dange- 
 rous source. He smiled, and said,- he had 
 never had any tendency to consumptive 
 symptoms ; nor did he ever attribute his 
 want of health to a weak constitution. At 
 this instant George entered, covered with 
 dust, and exhausted by heat and fatigue. 
 He approached the bed, and said, *' I 
 have seen Mr. Flamall, and given your 
 letter into his own hand." '^ It is 
 well :", replied my patient^ with an

 emotion that alarmed me ; for I was still 
 feeling the pulse, and those would have 
 betrayed it, without ,the suffusion which 
 passed his cheek. I turned towards George, 
 and after lecturing him witli kindness, for 
 his imprudent speed, I insisted on his 
 leaving the room, and laying down for 
 some hours. A sign, from his father 
 wliich he understood, made him docile, 
 arid he retired. Soon after I left the sick 
 room, cautioning the nurse, neither to ad- 
 mit Mr. Flamall nor any message from him 
 or others to reach her charge ; and taking 
 some sherbet in my hand^ I sought 
 George's little room. He had obeyed me, 
 and had taken off his clothes. I told him 
 the consequences which would result from 
 any exertion or surprise to his father ; 
 warning him to be on the watch. He 
 said, he did not believe his father expected 
 either a visit, or an answer from the gen- 
 tleman in question. He had told him not 
 to wait for any orders ; and had appeared

 only anxious, that his own letter should 
 reach him safely. 
 
 I proceeded to the cofFec-house, where, 
 as I expected, I met Captain Nelson. I 
 ga^e him this detail ; and he thought no 
 more of it, I believe, for lie was surround- 
 ed by busy faces ; and he told me, that he 
 should be with Charles soon, and would 
 meet me at Mr. Gilpin's before sunset. 
 
 I dined with my friend ; and we were 
 quietly conversing, when Captain Nelson 
 bursting into the room, said with agony, 
 '' it is all over with him! nothing can now 
 save him !'* I waited not for more intelli- 
 gence, but seizing my hat, hastily made 
 my way to the sick man. Nelson follow- 
 ing me. It was, indeed, ^^all over with 
 him ;" all our care and attention availed 
 nothing! For in a few hours he died. 
 Poor Nelson, during this scene of painful 
 suspense, lamented, in terms of the bit- 
 terest grief, that he had caused the re- 
 lapse. He said, that he had found him

 quiet and apparently easy. The nurse 
 said George was sound asleep, and men- 
 tioned your orders," added the captain. 
 ^' I asked Charles what were his conncK- 
 ions with Mr. Flamall ;" he calmly replied, 
 that he had known liim in his youth. 
 ^^ And was that all ?" asked I ; ^- come, 
 be open with me, you have had George in 
 your head, I dare say, and fancying to 
 make a friend for the poor lad ; but givg 
 yourself no concern ^about him. Let the 
 worst come to the worst, he will never want 
 a father whilst I have a guinea ; so try and 
 be a man again, and the brother of one 
 who loves you as a brother." He grasped 
 my hand with convulsive strength. '^ My 
 God !" said he aloud, ^^ I thank thee, and 
 die satisfied that thou art a God, mer- 
 ciful and gracious !" '^The blood again 
 gushed from his mouth ; and I flew to 
 Gilpin's." 
 
 I will pass over the sorrow of his poor 
 George, in order to hasten to the next still

 more serious and shocking event. Mr, Sin^ 
 clair^ the brother of my'patient, Mrs. FUnt, 
 brought me a summons to ^^ Upland/* the 
 residence of the family^ prepared to ex- 
 pect hourly the lady's want of my assist- 
 ance. I accompanied her brother home ; 
 but found Mrs. Flint, though in her own 
 apartment, with her female friends, per- 
 fectly contented with my being within the 
 house. The interval was devoted to my 
 friend Philip's amusement, whose anxiety 
 for the safety of his wife was apparent. 
 We were rallying him on this subject ; 
 and drinking to the health of his expected 
 blessing, when Mr. Sinclair was called 
 from the table. I will pass over the detail. 
 Juba, an old and freed slave of the late 
 Mr. Cowley's, but who has from his mas- 
 ter's death remained in his post of super- 
 intendant at the Creek house, was the 
 bearer of the intelligence which follows ; 
 and which you will conceive produced the 
 most dreadful sensations of horror and

 by his own hand!" Sinclair and myself 
 lost no time, in returning with Juba, 
 leaving Mr. Flint to the care of Mr. 
 Lindsey, and Mr. Montrose, his friends, 
 ^nd inmates. 
 
 On the road Juba gave us the following 
 particulars. On the preceding morning, 
 he it was, who saw George, who enquired 
 of him for Mr. Flamall, saying, he had 
 a letter to deliver to him, which he was 
 ordered to give to no other person. ^^ I 
 asked the lad from whom he had received 
 his commission,'* continued the faithful 
 Juba, and he replied, from Captain Nel- 
 son's steward. Knowing that we had many 
 bales in his ship, I immediately conclud- 
 ed, that the letter referred to business, 
 relative to these goods ; and I was on the 
 point of telling the young man, that I 
 would be answerable for the safety of the 
 letter ; but at that moment, Mr. Flamall 
 appeared, and took it himself, I shall be

 and was retreating ; when Mr. Flamall 
 asked him to rest, and take some refresh- 
 ment. He decHned the offer, replying 
 that his father would want him. I entered 
 the house ; and he departed. Mr. Flamall 
 was not long, I believe, before he went to 
 his apartment. He saw no one for some 
 hours ; at length he rang his bell, and or- 
 dered his horse to be prepared. We have 
 lately observed him as a man struggling 
 with something wrong in his mind. He 
 has been very odd at times ; and his groom 
 said, he was in one of his silent fits ; and 
 â– chose to go by himself. He did not re- 
 turn home, till a late hour in the evening. 
 The horse appeared heated and fatigued. 
 He went to his bed room, saying, that he 
 wanted nothing then, and should ring in 
 the morning, when he did. Hour suc-

 the library ; and we began to fear that all 
 was not right with him. His servant was 
 curious^ as well as uneasy ; he stopped 
 me on the staircase, to tell me, that he 
 had peeped through the key hole, that 
 his master was in his wrapping gown and 
 night cap, and was writing, and with a 
 countenance that made him tremble : 
 another servant was going to make his ob- 
 servations by the same means," continued 
 poor Juba, ^^ when the report of a pistol 
 checked him, and appalled us all. We 
 burst into the room. It was too late ! you 
 will see such a corpse ! I lost not, however, 
 my presence of mind ; one look at the 
 shattered mangled head of the poor wretch 
 was enough for me ! But whilst others 
 were gazing on the scene of horror, I se- 
 cured the written papers on his desk ; 
 which 1 will now give you."

 from his bosom, and presented them to 
 Mr, Sinclair. It is needless for me to

 oar part, acted with caution. Captain 
 Nelson has been questioned closely, as to

 his knowledge of the person, supposed to 
 have been the cause of the dreadful end of 
 Mr. Flamall. He repeated, on oath, his 
 evidence in favour of this unknown, and 
 adhered to the account he had before gi- 
 ven me of his acquaintance with him ; 
 adding, that he had not a doubt of his 
 h-aving been an injured man. His sorrow^ 
 for his loss, was not concealed ; for he 
 even shed tears, and with an oath affirmed, 
 that not only himself but every man in his 
 ship had lost a brother. Poor George was 
 with him, and looked the picture of de- 
 spair : he was examined also : he had ne- 
 ver heard liis father and protector name 
 Mr. Flamall until the morning he gave 
 him th^ letter. Not a single paper was

 he gives, with his blessing, his little pro-

 Captain Nelson means to protect the lad In

 Mr. Flamall has been careful to leave 
 no traces behind him, that may help to 
 elucidate this mystery, or throw a light 
 an any other of his private concerns. 
 Not a paper, nor a letter escaped his vigi- 
 lant cautions. Juba tells us, that from 
 the time his nephew's marriage was an- 
 nounced, he has suspected his mind to 
 have been deranged at times, and that he 
 was continually reading and burning let- 
 ters and papers when in his room. One 
 striking proof of his former connexion 
 with the unfortunate stranger, Charles, is 
 much talked of. He called at the house 
 where he lodged and died ; and to the 
 enquiries he made concerning the sick 
 man, one of the servants answered, that 
 he was dead. He said, he wished to see 
 him, having known him in his youth.

 But such was the impression the object 
 before him had produced, that he left the

 been occasioned by her seeing her hus- 
 band's dejection, which was but too ap- 
 parent, in spite of his endeavours. We 
 must give him credit for more sensibility

 means, which Flamall employed for the 
 purpose, are appalling to nature and to 
 the Christian. It is a happy circumstance 
 for my brother, that he has uniformly con-

 count of Lady Maclairn's healthy as also 
 Miss Flint's. 
 
 Let Miss Cowley be assured, that her 
 concerns will suffer nothing from the loss 
 o^ her agent. We have been fortunate in 
 having with us a Mr, Montrose ; this gen- 
 tleman is the early friend of Philip and 
 Margaret; and is brother to Mrs. Lind- 
 sey, my sister's first nurse, and constant 
 companion at present. 
 
 Montrose makes a better consoler than 
 myself. I therefore yield up to him this 
 office ; as being his by profession ; and 
 no man can better know, and perform his 
 duty. I have not, however, been idle. 
 The attested papers you will receive with 
 this, will inform you that all has been done 
 that could be done. Flamairs late gloom

 and the evidence of the servants, induced 
 the coroner's inquest to give in a verdict of . 
 lunacy. We have discovered no letters 
 nor papers of consequence, to his private 
 concerns; and one letter excepted, of a 
 Tecent date, from his banker, which men- 
 tions his having received the half year's 
 interest of five thousand pounds Bank 
 stock : this of course devolves to his sister. 
 I cannot conclude this letter, without tell- 
 ing you, that I believe, from the order in 
 which ail Flamall's accounts were, that he 
 has, for sometime, been meditating how- 
 to escape from a world, in which he knew 
 he was regarded with contempt. You 
 may think me too harsh ; be it so. But 
 believe me sincere and honest, and

234 LADY MACLAIRN^ 
 
 LETTER LXIX. 
 From Dr. Douglass to Mr. Hardcastle, 
 
 Fafejieid, Dec, 30. 
 
 I conjure yoti^ my dear Sir, to rely on 
 my assurances. Miss Cowley is entirely 
 out of danger. We have a decided in- 
 termission, and are hourly gaining on the 
 enemy. But I will not disguise my fears, 
 for the consequences which will probably 
 result from you and Miss Hardcastle's visit 
 here at this time. The truth is, that as terÂ« 
 ror and exertions beyond Miss Cowley's 
 strength, produced the feyer, it is my 
 opinion, that joy, and a new demand on 
 her feelings, will produce a return of it. 
 Calmness and repose are necessary to give 
 efficacy to the medicines which have hi- 
 therto been useful, and I entreat of you.

 To say what this young creature's forti-

 You will easily imagine, how little pre- 
 pared she was, after the attention and ex- 
 ertions she had shown to Lady Maclairn, 
 to sustain the sudden terror, which Miss 
 Flint's death produced. Every precau- 
 tion had been used to prevent the intelli- 
 gence of Mr. Flamall's death, from reach- 
 ing the dying woman. She was so weak, 
 as to bear with apathy her sister's absence 
 from the room ; indeed, she noticed lit- 
 tle those who were about her, being for 
 the most part in a lethargic stupor, and 
 gradually sinking. In the neighbourhood 
 it was, however, no secret that Mr. Flam- 
 all had died suddenly, Warner, Miss 
 Flint's woman, had in the morning left

 Miss Fhnt was heavily dosing, and the

 say, talked of poor Lady Maclairn's ill-

 which has circulated here, and which a 
 London newspaper has communicated to 
 the public. Namely, that, '' Mr. Flam- 
 all was assassinated by a negro, whom he 
 had too severely treated." I suspect the 
 precaution of whispering this tale was 
 forgotten_, in the eagerness of curiosity 
 and the love of the marvellous. Suddenly, 
 they were alarmed by a faint scream from

 From the first hour I knew Mr. MaU

 this goodwill was, in part, owing to the 
 favourable character I had of him from my 
 excellent friend, Counsellor Steadman.

 fies, that, in consideration of her brother 
 Olivers donation to Philip Flint, it ap- 
 pears to be an incumbent duty on her part, 
 to provide for those of her family, who 
 have been too long neglected^ and to the 
 last moment of her mortal life, will she 
 bless Philip Flint, for having seconded 
 her in this act of justice, by his advice 
 and concurrence. 
 
 The Farefield estate, with the movea- 
 bles, besides a considerable sum in mo- 
 ney, which will devolve on him as residu- 
 ary legatee, are left to Captain Flint for 
 his life ; at his decease they go to Philip 
 Flint, to whom she has only bequeathed 
 five thousand pounds *' as a token of her 
 love." To her niece Mary the same sum, 
 payable when she is of age, and five more 
 at her uncle's decease. To Malcolm Mac- 
 lairn two thousand pounds, *' as 3. mark of 
 Jier esteem for him, and gratitude to his 
 mother." By the way, poor Malcolm

 was nearly overpowered by this mark^ for 
 he had not mourned as one who needed 
 comfort ; and I suspect that his conscience 
 was not quite prepared for the legacy. 
 
 To the poor of the parish she has left 
 a liberal peace offering : to her servants 
 she has been generous and just: to Warner, 
 her woman, she leaves a thousand pounds. 
 
 FlamalVs execrable name does not ap- 
 pear in any paper that is left ; and yet the 
 contents of the cabinet left to Lady Mac- 
 lairn's inspection, clearly prove that Miss 
 Flint had long been engaged by the 
 thoughts of death. Not d. friend has been 
 overlooked but Flamall, and it is evident 
 to me, that she ceased to regard him even 
 in that point of view, from the time he 
 declared his marriage. I suspect she was 
 informed of his baseness in that business. 
 All her little donations were marked and 
 ticketed by her own hand. To Sir Mur- 
 doch she leaves a rery fine seal ; its anti- 
 quity as well as beauty^ make it valuable.

 ambition in regard to his son's marriage 
 with Miss Cowley. Let it suffice, that 
 they were such ag did not surprise me. I

 Should he ever dare to disturb the com-

 farther to invade on your peace ; he knows

 her eyes to Heaven ; '' I have not outlived

 AGAIN I am permitted to take a bet-

 fully explained to us the mystery relative 
 to the portraits in Miss Flint's possession. 
 It appears that Mrs. Howard, apprehending 
 that they would be more pernicious to her 
 brother, than consolatory, requested Mrs. 
 Heartley to secrete them from his search. 
 She obeyed her dying friend. "But," 
 added Mrs. Heartley, *'my feelings at this 
 juncture were nearly as little under the 
 controul of my reason, as poor PercivaVs. 
 I wrote a letter to Miss Fhnt, which was 
 dictated by my sorrow, and the romantic

 sulting his best friend. I heard no more 
 from Miss Flint ; and I concluded that she 
 had destroyed the portraits in a similar 
 manner as she had that of her mother. 
 Frustrated in my project, I was forced to 
 conceal this occurrence ; and the pictures 
 were supposed to be irrecoverably and un* 
 accountably lost.'* 
 
 Although my conscience reproached 
 me frequently wdien hearing the captain 
 bewail this loss, it never did so as to the 
 motive from which I had acted : but it is 
 to be feared, that my zeal in the cause of 
 the injured, disqualified me for making a 
 convert to justice and humanity. It is 
 most probable that I irritated where I 
 wished to heal ; and it is certain, that I 
 was from that time the object of Miss 
 Flint's implacable resentment. Poor wo-

 Neither her spirit of resentment, nor any 
 entrenchment from her prosperous fortune, 
 could shield her from the voice within her 
 bosom. It spoke my language with ten*

 she knew I was in unison with her con-

 dread arises. That Miss Flint was sen- 
 sible of its power is certain. Nor do I 
 believe, with some, that it is possible for 
 us to outlive its authority. When I hear 
 of such, who are said to be hardened by 
 sin, and become callous by guilt, I no

 I AM, my dear friend, so powerfully

 this delusion of feeling ! My reason and 
 my faith point out this disembodied spi-

 trembling awe I follow it to the tribunal

 not be unwise, to direct our thoughts 
 from such shocking depravity of crea- 
 tures like ourselves. I wish so to do ; 
 and yet not lose the lesson of wisdom as 
 applicable to myself. In what, I would 
 ask you, consisted the dilference between 
 Miss Flint and Rachel Cowley at two 
 years of age. The general lineaments of 
 our minds have a near affinity. What 
 has produced the moral differences which 
 from that period have discriminated us ? 
 Education, and the habits resulting from 
 our respective situations : in the one in- 
 stance, the soil was left uncultured ; in the 
 other, it was judiciously cultivated. Lu- 
 cretia had been overlooked by her mo- 
 ther in the early period of her life. In- 
 dolence and indulgence v/ere this mother's 
 faults. She found, in cultivating the do- 
 cile and mild Percival, a gratification of 
 her own taste, and an object of amuse- 
 ment, as well as for exclusive tenderness,

270 LADY MACLAIRN, 
 
 This mother wanted firmness, and the vi- 
 gilance necessary for her duty. When 
 passion had taken its root, this unhappy 
 creature was consigned over to the care 
 and tuition of a schoolmistress. I mean 
 not to be iUiberal ; for I believe many 
 women in that class of life are not only ac- 
 complished women, but conscientiously 
 disposed to be useful to their pupils ; 
 but I cannot think that in a large school, 
 either the temper, or peculiar moral de- 
 fects of a girl are likely to meet with that 
 nice and accurate observation which are 
 necessary for their correction. I will 
 however admit that in this seminary Miss 
 Flint acquired the outvvard habits of de- 
 corum, and that knowledge, which, with 
 experience, and a different temper, might 
 have conducted her, as it does multitudes 
 of our sex, in the common routine of pri- 
 vate and domestic life. She then returned 
 to her parents, slenderly furnished by the 
 gifts of nature., with a spirit unsubdued^

 and a mind without any fixed principle of 
 action, beyond a confidence in herself. 
 She was next a candidate for favour in- 
 the world ; and she proudly conceived 
 tjiat no one would dare refuse it ; but 
 she found a rival, even in the cradle, 
 and under the parental roof. Is it to be ex- 
 pected, that from such a disposition, and 
 under such circumstances, envy and malice 
 could be long a stranger to her ? The 
 mother perceived their baneful influence ; 
 and she opposed to their growth, nothing 
 but remedies wbich relieved herself from 
 trouble and vexation. She flattered inÂ» 
 stead of reproving, and gave -to her daugh- 
 ter an authority which she knew she would 
 abuse. Uncontrouled and domineering 
 over those about her ; irritated by the neg- 
 lect of those whom she could not subju- 
 gate to her imperious will, she became 
 soured, disappointed, and vindictive ; and 
 she finished by becemingthe fit instrument

 grounds ; for Alice Heartley and Ra-

 would be only so much labour lost. But 
 it may not be amiss for you to begin to 
 accustom yourself to fewer petticoats. We 
 wear here only one. But we have found 
 out vays and means to obviate the mischief 
 of going unclothed, and we contrive to 
 keep ourselves warm ; but this, as Mrs. 
 Dangle says, is a secret haunter nu ; for if 
 the gentlemen knew you were in the habit 
 of wearing small clothes whilst single, they 
 might fear for their privileges when you 
 married. You will be dehghted with this 
 charming woman. She is the counter-part 
 of you, only she has seen more of polite 
 life, since her marriage, than you have 
 been in the vay of seeing at Farefield ; 
 which, to say the truth, is a sad place for 
 such a young lady as Miss Cowley. 
 
 I remain in the expectation of hearing 
 from you the time fixed for seeing you ; 
 and I shall be impatient till I can show 
 you tliat I am your affectionate friend, 
 
 Lydia Serge,

 P. S. You need not be under any fear 
 of meeting that dis:;race to me, Lydia. I 
 have not seen her since her leaving Put- 
 ney, nor will I ever again hacknowledgt her 
 as my child, Jerry may be as obstinate 
 as he please. So will I, on this point. 
 You will be astonished to hear, that he 
 have set up the feller who married her like 
 a gentleman^ and even sent down a post- 
 chay for his lady's use. I see into this 
 malice. It is all done to spite the cap- 
 tain, whom he hate. I am sorry to say, 
 Nora's foolish complaints have done no 
 good. I am sure, I can see nothing in 
 the captain that would not please any rea- 
 sonable woman ; and to me, his behaviour 
 is always hattentive and respecijuL You

 CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 
 
 JTlAVING faithfully performed my 
 pleasing task, and exerted my best abili- 
 ties to recommend myself to my readers, 
 I do honestly confess, that I am gratified 
 by finding that something remains, in 
 which my services may be useful to their 
 curiosity. Except two letters, from Miss 
 Cowley to her correspondents at Heathcot, 
 nothing appears of sufficient consequence 
 to this work, they being confined solely 
 to Miss Hardcastle's and Miss Howard's 
 journey to Farefield ; which they reached 
 in the month of February. 
 
 It remains with me, consequently to 
 supply a few pages to this, otherwise

 abrupt conclusion of a work^ already re- 
 prehensible in the critic's eje. 
 
 My readers may be able to recollect the 
 name of Montrose, the early friend of 
 Mr. Philip Flint, who, with his sister, the 
 wife of Mr. Lindsey, shared in his confi- 
 dence, with the truth and ardour of youth- 
 ful zeal and friendship, during his progress 
 to Miss Sinclair's heart. 
 
 To this gentleman am I at present in- 
 debted for a situation in life which I 
 would not exchange for the most brilliant 
 which this world has to give. For I am 
 sheltered from ^' the proud man's con- 
 tumely," and *^ the pang which the 
 worthy of the unworthy takes." I was in my 
 friend's hospitable house at the shocking 
 termination of Mr. Flamall's life. This 
 event produced many changes in favour of 
 those, to whom he had been more obnox- 
 ious than useful. My brother Lindsey, 
 was immediately placed in Mr, FiamalTs 
 office, as this regarded Miss Cowley's

 property on the island ; and Mr. Flint, 
 with Counsellor Stead man's advice and 
 concurrence^ relieved her, by an appeal to 
 Chancery, from the restrictive clauses in her 
 father's will, they being her appointed 
 guardians until she was of age. 
 
 In the mean time, I was judged capable 
 of educating the young Cowley's. Their 
 gentle and interesting mother had formed 
 an intimacy with my sister Lindsey, dur- 
 ing the time they resided under the same 
 roof, at Mr. Dalrymple's ; and to judge 
 of the future by the present, these friends 
 will never have but one and the same roof. 
 
 In the hours of confidence, which suc- 
 ceeded to their first acquaintance, Marian 
 informed Mrs. Lindsey, of lier motives 
 for withdrawing from Mr. Flamall's au- 
 thority and power, by quitting an abode 
 she Icved. He had importuned her with 
 his passion even before Mr. Cowley's 
 death ; and she held him in abhorrence 
 'and terror. She made no doubt of the il-

 kgality of Mr. Cowley's will, he having 
 repeatedly told her, that she would find 
 a protector and a giuirdian for her soi.s ia 
 Mr. Oliver Flint ; and from the inonicnt 
 she was informed of Mr. Flamall's autho- 
 rity, she determined never to lose sight of 
 her children. Mr. Philip FHnt befriended 
 her, because Juba had told' him that I 
 was afraid of his uncle. Her entire con- 
 currence in committing her children to m}^ 
 care ; her confidence in my integrity, led 
 her cheerfully to part with them, and we 
 reached England in safety ; where my 
 trust was sanctioned by their expecting 
 sister and maternal friend. 
 
 From that hour I have experienced the 
 comforts of a home, endeared to me by 
 all that can give zest to rational pleasure 
 with an undepraved heart. Montrose was 
 understood as a man to be trusted ; al- 
 though, to say the truth,, my friends ap- 
 pear to be governed by motives, not un-

 In giving up to my discretion her cor- 
 respondence with Miss Hardcastle, during 
 her residence at Farefield, Mrs. Hardcastle 
 added those occurrences which had taken 
 place after the day which terminated 
 *^ her captivity." '^ You will easily be-

 Steadman was as ready to resign the heir- 
 ess^ as I was to be rid of the plagues of 
 heirship ; but AHce was a wife before I

 its blessings ; and, that the human heart 
 can never want an inlet to joy, until it has 
 banished affection for others. She was 
 right in saying this ; and she knows, and 
 feels it to be truth. Mary has. neither

 you say, the whole tissue of events before 
 you have confirmed you in your belief of 
 a retributive justice, it is well : as it is dis- 
 played in this scene of action, it may be 
 useful to others ; although I am of opi- 
 nion, that not a day passes^ that does not 
 add to our conviction, that the sinner is 
 taken in his own snare, and the virtuous 
 kept from falling by a power beyond our 
 finite rtason. But as your intention and 
 labour will have little aid from fiction, 
 let your fidelity, as an historian, compen- 
 sate for the absence of the marvellous. 
 Do not omit to say, that Philip Flint and 
 Malcolm Maclairn are brothers, whose 
 hearts are not divided by the ocean which 
 separates them. They live in hopes of 
 being re-united ; but Mr. Flint has inhe- 
 rited from his grandfather so strong a pre- 
 dilection in favour of the island of Jamaica, 
 that it would not surprise me, if he re- 
 mained there until he could man a ship

 added she, ^' we are happy now at Wen -

 To these instructions I have paid 
 due obedience; but! have passed some 
 weeks at Farefield Hall since writing the

 And I think it will be no matter of sur-

 indulge myself with a supernumerary page 
 or two, for the sole purpose of paying my

 gotten by her, when she became Mrs. 
 Hardcastle. " You will see my favourite 
 when you go toFarefield, said she, ^' and 
 yoQ will judge of my hasty sketches of 
 the most simple-hearted man who Hves. 
 Supported by the rectitude of his own mind, 
 and a piety which rests solely on the good- 
 ne'ss of God, he has sustained very severe 
 trials, with a patience and resignation that 
 ought to put philosophy to the blush. 
 The loss of his favourite daughter, the 
 prop of his comforts, was followed by the 
 death of Mrs. Fairly, who, in consequence 
 of a severe cold taken at a place of public 
 amusement, to which she was reluctantly 
 hurried, after an indisposition of a danger- 
 ous kind, fell into a rapid decline, and 
 was consigned to the grave before she was 
 one and twenty. Her, giddy, thought- 
 less mother was at this melancholy period 
 on a tour of pleasure with Mrs. Dangle, 
 recently become a widow ; and CapLaia

 Fairly, with another military beau were 
 their escorts. 
 
 Poor Mr. Serge, assisted by his friends 
 the Tomkins's, supported this scene, and 
 without designing to write to his unfeeling 
 son, or to his foolish misled wife, shelter- 
 ed his sorrows at his daughter Mrs. Wil- 
 let's, leaving to the public papers to an- 
 nounce to the travellers the event, which 
 they might have foreseen before they left 
 home. " But the claims of the disconso- 
 late widow, Mrs. Dangle, could not be 
 overlooked." Mr. Maclairn and his wife 
 joined the dejected Mr. Serge at his daugh- 
 ter VV^iUet's ; and by diverting his thoughts 
 to the final estabhshment of this child', 
 they had the satisfaction of seeing him im- 
 prove in heakh and spirits. He had not, 
 however, lost his resentment in regard to 
 his wife's desertion ; but with firmness de- 
 clared, that he meant to give up his house 
 at Putney, and to live remote from Lon- 
 don. With these resolutions he returned

 to town; and it appears that he was steady. 
 The lady returned also from her excursion, 
 somewhat humbled by the reception he 
 gave her ; and probably, shocked by the 
 death of her child, she made concessions 
 which fiiiled in their effect ; for she would 
 not submit to give up her dear Mrs. Dan- 
 gle, nor refuse Captain Fairly's visits â€” 
 points ohslinately enforced by her husband. 
 He again returned to Mrs. Willet's, and 
 found consolation. His grandson amused 
 him ; and '' honest William," as he calls 
 Mr. Willet, hourly rose in his estimation. 
 Some months passed : he resolutely re- 
 fused to return home, without an assurance 
 that he should find his wife willing to give 
 up her son, Fairly, and Mrs. Bangle's so- 
 ciety. But this poor, weak, and misguid- 
 ed woman, had too promptly acquired 
 the lessons they had taught her ; and she 
 was hastening on to destruction, when an 
 accident deprived her of life. A Major 
 Ogle, who had his hopes and projects^

 flattered by the age and vexations ^^ of the 
 rich old taylor," drove one morning Mrs. 
 Serge an airing In his tandem from Dangle 
 Park, leaving his friend the noble Captain 
 Fairly to amuse Mrs. Dangle. Though a 
 proficient in gallantry and gaming, the 
 major could not manage two high fed and 
 spirited horses. Some linen drying on a 
 hedge by a cottage, frightened the lead- 
 er ; he became ungovernable, the carriage 
 was overset, and Mrs. Serge received a 
 blow on the temple from the liorsc's foot, 
 which killed her on the spot ; her admirer 
 was quit with a broken arm. Mr. Serge 
 received the intelligence of this shocking 
 accident with silent sorrow : he took to 
 his bed, and Malcolm was^soon his nurse- 
 " I have outlived my feelings !" said the 
 poor man to him ; '' I dare not tell you 
 what are my thoughts at this hour ; but I 
 sometimes think, it would be sinful to sor- 
 row, for the loss of a woman, who, had 
 she lived; would have lived only to have

 disgraced herself. She is taken from the 
 evil company of those who have perverted 
 her simpHcity, and made her the laugh of 
 their dissolute hours. But the day will 
 come, when they will remember having 
 corrupted innocence, and misled igno- 
 rance : her cause, and mine will be heard 
 at a tribunal, they will tremble to ap- 
 proach.'* He now determined on his 
 plans for his future life, and with his usual 
 munificence kft his house and furniture at 
 Putney for Mrs. Tomkins's use ; and he 
 has from that time resided at Mr. Wil- 
 son's, in Captain Flint's deserted apart- 
 ments ; where, in the comforts of a family 
 attached to him, and in the society of Mrs. 
 Heartley, who still lives at the Abbey, he 
 is cheerful and contented. '^ When you 
 know him," continued Mrs. Hardcastle, 
 ** it will not surprise you to find him, treat- 
 ed by his friends with an affectionate 
 fondness, resembling that which is given 
 to a cherished child ; but although he

 may be called the pest of every house he 
 frequents, such is the genuine goodness of 
 his nature, that indulgence cannot make 
 him forward or capricious. He does not 
 even claim the respect due to his age and 
 station ; and whilst the poor around him 
 regard him as their tutelary divinity, they 
 love him as a neighbour, and he con- 
 verses with them like one. His loquacity 
 will amuse you^ for he may be said to 
 think aloud ; and his gratitude to those 
 who, in his own words^, '' are kind to him," 
 is displayed by the minutest attention to 
 their ease. Though he greatly prefers an 
 open carriage to a coach, he keeps one be- 
 cause his ladies want it in bad weather ;'' 
 and Mrs. Wilson is not permitted to take 
 cold when she goes to church, for he in- 
 sists on using it as a family convenience.^'' 
 
 My recommendations were too powerful 
 to be overlooked by Mr. Serge. We 
 we were intimate friends in an hour ; and 
 it has been a source both of satisfaction and 
 curiosity to me, to profit from the frank-

 ness and openness of a mind so uncom- 
 mon. I have seen that the encroach- 
 ments of age and natural infirmities may- 
 find a barrier, without the aid of philo- 
 sophy-j and that in a cheerful piety a man 
 may find a safe refuge from the cold apa- 
 thy and querulous temper of near fourscore 
 years_, without other aid than his Bible, and 
 a good heart. 
 
 Our conversations are long, though de- 
 sultory. He frequently, however, talks of 
 his past sorrows and troubles. Speaking 
 of his daughter, Mrs. Fairly, he observed, 
 ^' that from the time she married, she re- 
 sembled a poor unfledged bird, who had 
 been ensnared within sight of the nest, 
 and the wing which had cherished her." 
 ^' Poor thing," added he, '^ she told me 
 once that het husha?id had taught her to 
 love me." I spoke of his satisfaction in 
 regard to Mr. Willet, with whom Mr. 
 Maclairn was so pleased. "Yes," replied 
 he, '' thank God, Lydia is the wife of an 
 honest man. I do not wish him to be such

 a gentleman as Fairly. Plain cloth suits 
 me, Mr. Montrose : I have worn no other^ 
 since I was born ; except the trimmings 
 are, like Malcolm's, of pure gold, they 
 are not ornamental in my opinion : tinsel 
 may decorate a fool, and set off a knave, 
 whilst it lasts ; but it will be for a very 
 little time. Mark what I tell you ; Fairly 
 will die in in a goal ; and his wife, late 
 Mrs. Dangle, will want bread, and pity 
 into the bargain. But I forgive them ; 
 it is my duty ; and like all my Master's 
 burthens, easy ; for what should I gain 
 by being unforgiving ? 
 
 The other day he with much jocularity 
 asked me whether the witnessing so much 
 of conjugal felicity had not put matrimony 
 into my head ? I replied, that, on the 
 contrary, it v/ould probably stamp me a 
 batchelor for life. ^' How so," asked he, 
 *' Why," answered I, *^ I see that in this 
 lottery of life, there are some capital prizes;

 my money for a blank, and I am become 
 too ambitious to be contented with a petty 
 prize." He laughed, warning me, that I 
 might change my mind. " For such things 
 do happen," continued he ; " at your age 
 I' was in no hurry to marry, yet when turn- 
 ed of forty, I married, without consulting 
 my register, or my reason. My good 
 aunt who lived with me, perceived, I sup- 
 pose, that I was thinking of changing my 
 condition, and she was much pleased; 
 recommending perpetually to my notice, 
 a very worthy young v/oman of her ac- 
 quaintance ; but I know not how it fell 
 out, after seeing two or three times my 
 poor, artless, good humoured Lydia, I 
 was not easy in my mind ; and thought 
 my aunt's favourite. Miss Welldon. looked 
 of a fretful temper, and was of too cere- 
 monious a turn for me, though she v/as 
 comely, and only six and thirty, which 
 certainly was a more suitable age for mine, 
 and I might have been comfortable with 
 her. I soon found that Lydia was too

 young a wife for me," continued he, 
 thoughtfully, *' but I loved her, and I 
 well knew what kindness would do with 
 her. She was contented, and all was 
 peace with us, till she was perverted by 
 bad company. Whenever, you marry, 
 Mr. Montrose, take care to know what 
 company the lady keeps ; much depends 
 on that ; and avoid a disproportion in 
 years : there is hazard in trusting too 
 much, in some cases.*' 
 
 He is very curious in his questions re- 
 lative to my two pupils, who are his fa- 
 vourites. '' It is all in good time yet/' 
 observed he, " but we must be careful 
 not to neglect our blessings. My grand- 
 son, Jerry, is a fine boy, and little William 
 very active and promising. Their mother 
 is an excellent nurse^ and Mrs. Maclairn 
 was quite surprised at seeing her a notable 
 housewife. She has been favoured, Mr.

 be a 'â€¢ fruitful vine." So the nursing will 
 be transferred. I mean to give my chil- 
 dren a good education^ Mr. Montrose. It 
 shall not be my faulty if they lack know- 
 ledge. I cannot reproach myself with 
 having wilfully neglected my duty ; but 
 with a more enlarged ^knowledge I might 
 have performed it better, and shunned 
 many errors in conduct. I have, of late, 
 been of opinion, that I had, in commoa 
 with other men better instructed, a capa- 
 city that might have been improved by 
 learning ; and I will tell you the reason 
 for this seeming presumption," added he, 
 suddenly stopping and facing me ; " it is 
 this : that, although I cannot talk, nor 
 argue like you, and our friends within, 
 yet I very often comprehend the drift of 
 your discourse, and am entertained by 
 your debates." Before I could make any 
 answer to this observation, Mr. Hard^

 castle called him, and reminded him of 
 the dam^^ness of the evening, adding, 
 that he was waited for at the loo-table. 
 He nodded in sign of obedience, and 
 said to me, '^ you may think I am vain, 
 but I must tell you, that I perceive uhat

 all the kindness of their good hearts ! It 
 is well for me that I know that my

 He entered the house, and with bustling 
 cheerfulness claimed his privilege of sit- 
 ting next Mrs. Hardcastle. 
 
 Should these touches of my pencil be 
 judged injurious to a portrait alre;^cly so 
 faithfully delineated by a more skillful 
 hand, I have only to request the censurer 
 to place the mistake, and others as glaring,

 The death of Lady Maclairn this spring, 
 has saddened every heart ; whilst, from 
 her dying lessons and calm resignation, 
 have resulted a consolation which all have 
 found useful. Sir Murdoch yielded to 
 Mrs. Hardcastle's entreaties,, to join her 
 in London soon after this melancholy 
 event. Again has she been to him the 
 <' angel of peace,'' and, with renewed 
 health and spirits, he accompanied the 
 family to Heathcot in June. 
 
 It is at Heathcot, according to Sir Mur-

 be seen, in order to be justly viewed.. I 
 think as he does ; for it is here, and here

 her mind^ appear to yield to the satis- 
 factions of her heart. She is always amia- 
 ble ; but a^ Heathcot she is more placid, 
 more affectionate, and, to use her own 
 words, " never from home." 
 
 I conceived, that this was the season for 
 renewing my petition relative to her and 
 Mr. Hardcastle's letters. I could not suc- 
 ceed. She saw that I was disappointed. 
 '^ Be comforted/' said she smiling ; " I 
 will, if you please, formally announce to 
 the public, what will satisfy half your 
 readers, as well as tlie best written love 
 letters extant. I can assert, that Horace 
 Hardcastle is still obstinate in error ; and 
 that he yet worships the idol formed by 
 iiis own hand ; an acquaintance with its 
 defects, serves only to augment his attach- 
 ment, for he pretends to find, even in 
 these, grounds foi' his faith and motives 
 for his love."

 passion built on so noble a basis!" 
 
 She interrupted me. ^^ Enough has ap- 
 peared/' said she, '^ to justify my pre- 
 ference and affection for my husband. My 
 principle of conduct is at the service of my 
 sex. The young cannot adopt a better. 
 The moment they know, that every ap- 
 proach to vice and libertinism is contagi- 
 ous, they will shun them, however deco- 
 rated ; and when they know, that by 
 marrying a fool, their own gold will be 
 mingled with an alloy which must sink its 
 value and obscure its brightness, they 
 will be safe, and preserve a heart worthy 
 of a good husband.'* 
 
 " I cannot help having my fears," said
